        "text": "Peter Tork, the guitarist and wise-cracking character in the 1960s teen-pop sensation the Monkees, died today at the age of 77, a rep for the group confirmed to Variety. Speaking with the Washington Post, Tork’s sister Anne Thorkelson did not specify a cause of death, although the guitarist had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer a decade ago.\n\nTork wrote a blog piece for the Post about his diagnosis with adenoid cystic carcinoma after beginning treatment in 2009. Through most of the 10 years since, he had been able to resume an active musical life, participating in Monkees reunion shows as recently as 2016, and recording his own solo blues albums, the last of which, “Relax Your Mind,” a Lead Belly tribute, came out in early 2018.\n\n“It is with beyond-heavy and broken hearts that we share the devastating news that our friend, mentor, teacher, and amazing soul, Peter Tork, has passed from this world,” read a statement on Tork’s official Facebook page, attributed to “the team of Peter’s friends, family and colleagues” that maintained his social media presence. “Please know that Peter was extremely appreciative of you, his Torkees.”\n\nThe Monkees’ legacy is a complicated one that even today polarizes serious rock fans, many of whom argue that their transformation from an assembled group to a real one deserves at least as much credit as anything with more organic beginnings. “Sometimes the question of the [Rock and Roll] Hall of Fame comes up, and I’ve been thinking lately that I don’t know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame,” Tork said, modestly, to the Baltimore Sun in 2016. “I mean, I would vote for us if I had a vote. But what I can say is if there was a hall of fame for television casts who became pop groups in their own right, we would be the only candidate.”\n\nWhile the Monkees were a manufactured, television-centric, American version of the Beatles as depicted in “A Hard Day’s Night,” Tork and fellow guitarist Mike Nesmith were serious musicians who paid their dues on the folk and rock scenes of the early 1960s; vocalist Davy Jones and singer/drummer Micky Dolenz were former child actors. Tork played the “Ringo” role in the group, as a charming and goofy comic foil.\n\nTork had been part of the Greenwich Village folk scene before becoming instantly famous. “To be in Greenwich Village in the ’60s was pure joy; to be young was pure bliss,” he said in an interview with UK Music Reviews. “When I talk about having a well favored life, I went from Greenwich Village almost directly into The Monkees. … I had first heard about the Monkees in the early summer of 1965 from a good friend of mine, one Mr. Stephen Stills,” who had apparently been considered for the show himself and made a call to Tork, whom he figured would be better suited.\n\n“With the Monkees, it was timing that a lot of kids came up and they were the younger brothers and sisters of the kids who loved the Beatles and they wanted something of their own,” Tork said in an interview with Rock Cellar in 2016. “And along came the Monkees and they had something of their own, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. They were like, You can keep your damn Beatles, I’ve got The Monkees! A lot of kids grew up that way and some of them became musicians,” he added, explaining why younger rockers like Rivers Cuomo, Ben Gibbard and Noel Gallagher had eagerly agreed to write songs for the Monkees’ 2016 comeback album, “Good Times.”\n\nTork attributed the huge initial success of the Monkees to two factors. “We were lucky to lock into one of the greatest song writing gangs of all time. … We had Carole King writing songs for us. Please, there has never been a better songwriter — really, come on,” he said to UK Music Reviews. “Secondly there was television. When you got to see the guys playing off of each other, even if they were reading scripts and playing parts, you still got a sense of who they were. There was a much more personal connection to us as people with the audience than there was with even the Beatles or the Stones, or even the more recent boy bands.”\n\nWhile the Monkees enjoyed enormous chart and box-office success in the wake of the television show, which launched in 1966 and was created by producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, the group grew weary of not being taken seriously. They gradually took on the instrumental and songwriting work on their recordings and made a dramatic split with their past on the uneven and very psychedelic 1968 album and film “Head,” which baffled fans and largely failed to introduce them to a new audience. (The movie became a cult favorite and drew a sold-out audience to a Hollywood screening in November, at which Dolenz and Nesmith appeared but Tork did not.)\n\n“The TV show had this huge ad campaign, and everybody went for all the hype,” Tork told the Los Angeles Times in 2008, when he was participating in a 40th anniversary screening of “Head” at the Egyptian. “The ‘Head’ campaign was designed to be Postmodernist, and the commercials were off-putting. The hip thought it was going to be another bubble-gum movie, and they didn’t want to see it. And the bubble-gum kids thought it was going to be a freak-out movie, and they didn’t want to see it. I think if the movie had been thoroughly promoted in an appropriate way, it would have done much better.”\n\nTork was by some accounts the most musically proficient member of the Monkees, and someone comfortable with a variety of instruments. In the 1960s, George Harrison invited him to play banjo on his first solo album, the “Wonder Wall” soundtrack, although his picking reportedly only appears on bootleg outtakes and in the film itself. Although he was usually seen playing guitar in his solo acoustic or blues-band shows, in his spare time, he played piano, telling Medium in a 2017 interview that a typical day for him included some casual classical music. “I enjoy playing Johann Sebastian Bach for a hobby, just to take my mind into different places,” he said.\n\nAll four members of the Monkees had rarely played together since Tork left the group in 1968 and the band officially broke up two years later. But after MTV reruns made the band newly hip, Tork regularly participated in reunion tours that began in 1986 and included all of the original members except for Michael Nesmith, who rejoined briefly for a 1996 album and ’97 UK tour. After Davey Jones died in 2012, Nesmith warmed up more to participating in reunion events. Tork, Nesmith and Micky Dolenz made their last appearance together at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood on Sept. 26, 2016.\n\nIn 2018, Nesmith and Dolenz went out on the road as a duo, leading many fans to question why Tork was not participating. “I have in general made no secret of the fact that all these recent years of Monkees-related projects, as fun as they’ve been, have taken up a lot of my time and energy,” he said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Moving forward, I have blues projects that I want to give my attention to…I’m shifting gears for now, but I wish the boys well, and I’ve learned to never say never on things further down the line.” But, Nesmith told the magazine at the time, “I’m afraid I would betray a confidence if I said any more than, ‘This is not a right time for him.’ He has his reasons. They are very private.” However, Tork did add one last song to a new Monkees Christmas album released last fall, a banjo-fueled version of “Angels, We Have Heard On High,” with Dolenz citing health issues as a reason Tork couldn’t contribute more.\n\nIn 2015, Tork discussed his illness with UK Music Reviews, prior to a London Monkees show. “It is pretty common knowledge that I had a surprise gift from a cancerous growth a number of years ago,” he said. “They carved it out of me and I have recovered solely from all of that. However it still requires attention on a regular basis; it doesn’t interfere terribly but that’s life. What I am trying to say is that I am as well as could be hoped for; life goes on like this. In fact I have to say that I am an extraordinarily well favored human on the face of the earth, and I am very grateful for that.”\n\n© 2019 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC"
