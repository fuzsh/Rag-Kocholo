He wrote or co-wrote on a slew of great, underappreciated songs for the \"fake\" band including \"Sunny Girlfriend,\" \"Circle Sky,\" \"Papa Gene’s Blues,\" \"Tapioca Tundra,\" and more. Over time, he was the Monkee most fed up with the band’s manufactured image, and split in 1970 with three years left on his contract. Free to do his own thing, Nesmith delved head-first into his appealingly dusty brand of country-rock, both solo (usually as Michael Nesmith) and with the First National Band, turning out classics like \"Winonah\" and \"Joanne\"; there was also a late '70s foray into delightful weirdness with \"Cruisin'\" and the yacht-rock-ish \"Rio.\" Nesmith’s feelings toward the Monkees softened over time, joining his old bandmates for the occasional reunion as well as touring with drummer Micky Dolenz for a revue called The Mike and Micky Show. In 2021, Dolenz released his own covers album of Nesmith’s songs; it turned out to be a fitting farewell, as Nesmith passed away in December 2021—leaving behind a wild and woolly legacy of music.\n\nPhoto: Michael Nesmith © Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images"
