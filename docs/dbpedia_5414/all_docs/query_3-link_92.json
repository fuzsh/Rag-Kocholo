        "text": "Singer, composer, heart throb, pioneer – all are accurate descriptions of Robert Michael Nesmith. Most easily identified by his trademark bluish wool hat with pompom, Nesmith fashioned a diversified career within music and also in film.\n\nMichael Nesmith was born on December 30, 1942 in Houston, Texas. His parents had divorced when he was only 3 years old and he and his mother Bette moved to Dallas. Nesmith attended Thomas Jefferson High School, where he performed in musicals and in the school’s choir.\n\nMichael’s mother, Bette Nesmith, was a legal secretary in Houston, Texas. Due to her hobby of painting, she came up with the idea and invented Liquid Paper typing correction fluid and made an enormous fortune overnight. He inherited half his mother’s $50 million estate from the sale of Liquid Paper; the rest finances a private think tank.\n\nMichael spent fourteen months in the U.S. Air Force where he tipped over a general’s airplane while cleaning it.\n\nAfter his tour of duty, Nesmith was given a guitar as a Christmas present from his mother and stepfather. Learning as he went, he played solo and in a series of working bands, performing folk, country, and occasionally rock and roll. His verse poems became the basis for song lyrics, and after moving to Los Angeles with his first wife and friend John London, he signed a publishing deal for his songs. Nesmith’s “Mary, Mary” was recorded by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, while “Different Drum” and “Some of Shelly’s Blues” were recorded by Linda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys. “Pretty Little Princess,” written in 1965, was recorded by Frankie Laine and released as a single in 1968 on ABC Records. Later, “Some of Shelly’s Blues” and “Propinquity (I’ve Just Begun to Care)” were made popular by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on their 1970 album Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy.\n\nNesmith was a self-described “failure” growing up. “I just didn’t do anything,” he said in his famous 1965 screen test for _The Monkees (1966)_ ; he expanded on this in a 1968 Australian radio interview by noting, “I was just starving and writing music.” He got work as a session guitarist up and down the East Coast before moving to Los Angeles with his wife Phyllis Barbour in 1965. He managed to get a record contract with Colpix Records and released several 45s as well as appearing on ‘Lloyd Thaxton’s’ syndicated teen dance show.\n\nHe had actually been “labelmates” with Davy Jones earlier, as both were signed to the Colpix Records label, though they’d apparently never met. His first professional recording (under the pseudonym “Michael Blessing”) was a folk music single entitled “What Seems To Be the Problem, Officer? While Jones had released a modestly successful LP and single by 1965, Nesmith’s two singles hadn’t gotten far past the promotional stage. The Colpix label (belonging to Columbia Pictures, and controlled by Screen Gems) was dissolved in 1966, to make way for the new Colgems label–with The Monkees as its centerpiece.\n\nMichael published several songs through different companies before signing his contracts for The Monkees. Since he was already signed to Screen Gems as a songwriter, the company next bought up Nesmith’s earlier publishing, so his songs could be used for the Monkees\n\nHe arrived for his first interview for The Monkees wearing a wool cap, to keep the hair out of his eyes while driving his motorcycle around town (Nesmith also carried a bag of laundry, to be done at a nearby laundromat on his way home). Producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered him as “Wool Hat”; they wanted to name his Monkees character that, but Nesmith refused.\n\nIn describing his famous wool hat”It had a life of its own. I used to take it off and put it in a little house, feed it . . . ”\n\nWhen Nesmith won the role for The Monkees (1966) he was the first of all involved to see where the show and the music would go. Nesmith produced tracks for The Monkees even before TV series filming began; he has said “about a hundred” tracks were made by himself, Micky, Peter, and Davy in the first half of 1966, and among the songs recorded was his composition “The Girl I Knew Somewhere.”\n\nThe Gretsch guitar company built a one-off natural finish 12-string electric guitar for Nesmith when he was performing with The Monkees (Gretsch had a promotional deal with the group). He earlier played a customized Gretsch twelve-string, which had originally been a six-string model. Nesmith used this guitar for his appearances on the television series, as well as The Monkees’ live appearances in 1966 and 1967. Beginning in 1968, Nesmith used a white 6-string Gibson SG for his live appearances with The Monkees. He would use that guitar in their motion picture Head for the live version of “Circle Sky,” and also for the final original Monkees tour in 1969 with Davy Jones and Micky Dolenz. In a post on his Facebook page in 2011, Nesmith reported that both guitars were stolen in the early 1970s.\n\nThe hiring of Don Kirshner quashed this group gestation, but Nesmith continued to produce tracks for the group, usually with Micky Dolenz providing co-lead or harmony vocals; the trademark of Nesmith’s 1966-produced tracks was the stellar deep bass work of Robert West.\n\nBeing the leader of the group by virtue of having the strongest musical vision and polish, Nesmith challenged the controlling powers, culminating in the famous “That could have been your head!” near-brawl with Columbia executives in late 1966-early 1967 that left a wall torn open.\n\nThe Monkees succeeded in ousting supervisor Don Kirshner and took control of their records and song choices, but they worked as a four-man group on only one album, 1967’s Headquarters. The band never overcame the credibility problems they faced when word spread that they had not played on their first records; Nesmith instigated this when he called the band’s first non-studio press conference and called More of The Monkees “probably the worst record in the history of the world”. However, their singles and albums continued to sell well, until the disastrous release of Head, filmed with much assistance from Frank Zappa.\n\nThe Monkees went off the air in 1968, the same year as their only feature film, Head, premiered to poor reviews and box office results. Tork soon left the group, but Nesmith and the others made one more album together as the Monkees. Nesmith took a controlling involvement in the group’s albums, but given the strong egos of each member, and breakage was inevitable. Nesmith finally left in 1970.\n\nNesmith’s last contractual Monkees commitment was a commercial for Kool-Aid and Nerf balls, in April 1970 (fittingly, the spot ends with Nesmith frowning and saying, “Enerf’s enerf!”). With the band’s fortunes continuing to fall, Nesmith asked to be released from his contract, and had to pay a default: “I had three years left… at $150,000 a year,” which he had to pay back. He continued to feel the financial bite for years afterwards, until his inheritance from his mother’s Liquid Paper fortune in 1980 eased those concerns. In a 1980 interview with Playboy he said of that time, “I had to start telling little tales to the tax man while they were putting tags on the furniture.” While Nesmith had continued to produce his compositions with the Monkees, he withheld many of the songs from the final Monkees albums, only to release them on his post-Monkees solo records.\n\nMichael & Ringo\n\nIn the 1960’s, Michael enjoyed his fame and struck up friendships with fellow musicians in the U.S. and abroad.Interestingly, he attended the famous orchestral session for “A Day In The Life” by John Lennon..\n\nHe joined longtime bassist friend John London and pedal steel ace ‘Orville “Red” Rhodes’ for The First National Band, a group that pioneered the mixture of country music with rock-&-roll. The song “Joanne” off of their first album, “Magnetic South”, became a big hit. Though the FNB broke after three albums, Nesmith and Rhodes kept on going with the Second National Band. Their records were critical successes, but unfortunately were not big hits.\n\nNesmith then invented and sold the concept 24 hour music television to Time Warner. He produced a proof of concept called “Pop Clips” which Time-Warner aired on the Nickelodeon channel as a test. It was an instant success. From there was developed the MTV network.\n\nHe also branched into TV and film production, with such works as Elephant Parts (1981), Timerider (1983), Repo Man (1984), Square Dance and Tapeheads, as well as several TV specials.\n\nAs to why he didn’t rejoin The Monkees when Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones re-formed the group, c. 1986 “It would be kind of like Ronald Reagan making another movie.”\n\nNesmith continued to make records on a sporadic basis, 13 solo albums in total. He reunited with Red Rhodes in 1992 and a Latin-flavored masterpiece called “Tropical Campfires”. He was nominated for a Grammy for his 1994 album “The Garden”. – He reunited with the Monkees in 1996 for the “Justus” album. In 1997 he wrote and directed an ABC television Monkees special. In 1998 St. Martins Press published his first novel, “The Long Sandy Hair of Neftoon Zamora”. In 2005 he finished his second novel, “The America Gene”. He also started a small video game development company called Zoomo Productions, based in Monterey, California.\n\nAn opportunistic lookalike from the U.S. cashed in on his similarity to Nesmith by appearing on talk shows and doing interviews in Australia during the 1980s. The scam was successful, the lookalike being far enough from America to avoid detection as a fraud (which is less likely in the U.S., where the real Nesmith has made many media and show-business acquaintances). An entertaining interviewee, the impersonator’s charade was not discovered until after he had vanished from the public eye. The imposter, Barry Faulkner, who had pulled various fraudulent scams for 40 years, was finally apprehended and sent to jail in 2009.\n\nIn 2012, Nesmith briefly toured Europe prior to re-joining The Monkees for their tours of the United States. Intermixing the Monkees concerts, Nesmith also launched solo tours of the U.S. Unlike his 1992 U.S. tour, which predominantly featured music from his RCA recordings, Nesmith stated his 2013 tour featured songs that he considers “thematic, chronological and most often requested by fans”.\n\nMichael was married (and divorced) three times and has four children.\n\nMichael recently was quoted as saying, “I’m clearly in my endgame.

The group’s success inspired the formation of a number of youthful black vocal groups, from the Students in the late ’50s to the Jackson Five in the ’60s. The group’s sound influenced young singers such as Ronnie Bennett and Diana Ross, and served as prototype for both the girl groups and early Motown groups of the ’60s.\n\nHis wise-beyond-his-years vocal and performing abilities not only made the Teenagers a group several notches above the competition but made Lymon the first black teenage pop star. Though only together for a brief 18-month period, Lymon & the Teenagers exerted an enormous influence, spawning several “kid” vocal groups and providing initial inspiration to Berry Gordy to model his entire Motown production approach around Lymon’s original vocal style.\n\nFormed in the Washington Heights section of New York, the half-black, half-Puerto Rican Teenagers began as an assemblage of schoolmates and neighbors practicing popular R&B in the hallways of their respective apartment buildings. A performance at Edward W. Stitt Junior High School got the attention of 12-year-old Frankie Lymon, there to play bongos in his brothers’ mambo band. His seemingly innocent falsetto was a perfect fit, and he was soon singing with the group — but not always as lead. They called themselves the Premiers and hoped some day to make a record.\n\nAn apartment neighbor gave the group some poems his girlfriend had written to him as letters — partly in an attempt to get them to practice something new. One poem was worked into a song called “Why Do Birds Sing So Gay,” and when a member of the doo-wop group The Valentines got the Teenagers an audition with the Rama label, it was further morphed into “Why Do Fools Fall In Love,” featuring Lymon on lead. It was a smash, and the group followed up with hits like “I’m Not a Juvenile Delinquent.”\n\nUnfortunately, despite the squeaky-clean image of the group, they were no innocents — Harlem native Lymon had been a pimp at ten.\n\nThe Valentines were under contract to Rama Records owned by George Goldner. Barrett a talent scout for Goldner arranged an audition. Goldner was impressed. At subsequent recording sessions bandleader Jimmy Wright suggested a name change to the Teenagers to reflect the members ages.\n\nEarly February, 1956 “Why Do Fools Fall in Love” was released. With Lymon on boyish soprano lead, the song became an instant smash on Gee Records. The song was subsequently covered by the Diamonds and Gale Storm, but unlike most songs rendered by white artists, the original proved to be the biggest hit. The Teenagers were on their way. Lymon was credited with writing this, their first big hit, However, in the early ’90s, a federal judge ruled after a lengthy trial that Lymon hadn’t written the song — another member of the Teenagers had.\n\nSporting a clean-cut wholesome image, the appeal of the Teenagers was their youth. On stage they were very energetic. The group was well choreographed by Cholly Atkins who would go onto greater fame with the Temptations. The Teenagers were packaged so as not to upset middle lass American parents. They even appeared in letter sweaters.\n\nMarch, 1956 they were booked by Alan Freed in one of his rock and roll reviews at the Brooklyn Paramount. They appeared with the Platters and Bill Haley and His Comets. A second single “I Want You To Be My Girl” was released in April. A week later they appeared on CBS-TV’s Shower of Stars. By the end of April they were touring with “The Biggest Rock and Roll Show of 1956”\n\nIn August production was begun on a movie called Rock. Rock, Rock in which the Teenagers made a cameo appearance. In September they appeared on Alan Freed’s radio show. While headlining the Apollo “ABC’s of Love” was released. After that they went back to Hollywood to film a cameo for Don’t Knock the Rock. In late September they began a tour with Bill Haley that lasted until late November. In November their fifth single “Baby, Baby” was released and their first album Meet the Teenagers was released in December. The Teenagers were enrolled in the School for Professionals. and on the road they took correspondence courses and had traveling tutors. However, they were falling behind in their education and the group stayed at home the first of months of 1957. During this time “Paper Castles” was released.\n\nAfter appearing in a carnival in Panama in March they began a three month tour of England beginning at the London Palladium. While in London, the Teenagers recorded a second album Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the London Palladium.\n\nGeorge Goldner had been trying to convince Lymon to go solo and after the success in Great Britain he agreed to do so. On Alan Freed’s weekly television show in July, Lymon appeared solo. “Goody Goody,” his the last record with the Teenager was released in July.\n\nIn September Lymon began an 80 day tour with the Biggest Show Stars for 1957 as a solo act. His first record without the Teenagers, “My Girl” was released.. In November Lymon’s “Little Girl” appeared on Roulette and the Teenagers “Flip-Flop” on Gee\n\nJanuary 1958 Lymon released “Thumb, Thumb” Lymon and the Teenagers reunited to sing “Goody Goody” on Dick Clark’s “American Bandstand. In June he appeared with the Coasters at the Apollo Theater.\n\nLosing his youthful soprano voice, at the age of fifteen Lymon’s career was in decline. After the initial success of the first two records sales had slipped with each release. “Goody, Goody” was the last record by Lymon or the Teenagers to have any significant sales.\n\nLymon had experimented with drugs since 1958. On June 21, 1966 he was arrested on a heroin charge. Lymon entered the army in lieu of a jail sentence but, received a less then honorable discharge a short time later. He moved to Fort Gordon, Georgia where he married a local school teacher Emira Eagle and stayed in the Augusta area appearing at a local lounge. In mid-February he told his wife he had a weekend job in New York. On February 27, 1968 he died in the same house he had grown up in with an empty syringe by his side.\n\nAs with most young performers of the era, the Teenagers lost rights to their material. Goldner’s publishing firm had handled the song, taking fifty percent off the top. Originally Frankie Lymon, Herman Santiago and George Goldner were listed as “Why Do fools Fall In Love” composers. Santiago’s name was soon dropped and in the mid-sixties Lymon and Goldner sold off their rights to the song.\n\nIn 1984, on behalf of Emira Lymon, a lawyer and artist’s agent sued to wrest the copyright away from the current owner. The case became confused when it looked like Lymon had a second and possibly a third widow. Elizabeth Waters claimed to have married Lymon in 1964 in Virginia. However, it turned out she had been married to someone else at the time. As Water’s claim went to court, Zola Taylor ex-member of the Platters, claimed that she had been sexually active with Lymon as early as the “Biggest Rock “n” Roll Show of 1956″ tour. She claimed to have married Lymon in Tijuana about 1965, but could produce no certificate. The first hearing, held in Philadelphia, was decided in favor of Miss Waters being Lymon’s first wife. Emira appealed and won a reversal based on her claim that she was Lymon’s last wife.\n\nHerman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant also pursued their claim to the songs rights in federal court. In December, 1992, the two singers and Emira Lymon, received complete rights to the song.\n\nBy 1980, Sherman Garnes (heart attack) and Joe Negroni (cerebral hemmrage) had both died when the remaining Teenagers decided to rebuild the group. Santiago and Merchant performed with Garnes’ brother, while the high tenor parts were handled by Pearl McKinnon of the Kodiaks, and later by Frankie’s brother, Lewis Lymon\n\nFrankie Lymon has been called the “father” of the girl group sound. He was a direct influence on Arlene Smith of the Chantels, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and the Isley Brothers, all who recorded for George Goldner.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nYesterday, August 20, was John Hiatt’s 64th birthday (as well as Robert Plant, Country -Rock guitar whiz Sneaky Pete Kleinow, Country legend Jim Reeves, Phil Lynott from Thin Lizzy, as well as Soul Man Isaac Hayes.\n\nHiatt was born in 1952 to Ruth and Robert Hiatt, the sixth of seven children in a Roman Catholic family from Indianapolis. When he was nine years old, Hiatt’s 21-year-old brother Michael committed suicide. Only two years later, his father died after a long sickness. To escape from the stress of his early life, Hiatt watched IndyCar racing and listened to Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, and the blues. In his youth, Hiatt reports that he and several others stole a Ford Thunderbird, a crime for which he was caught by the owners but got away with, posing as a hitchhiker. He learned to play the guitar when he was eleven, and began his musical career in Indianapolis, Indiana as a teenager. He played in a variety of local clubs, most notably the Hummingbird. Hiatt played with a variety of bands, including The Four-Fifths and John Lynch & the Hangmen He began drinking around this time which eventually led to alcoholism that dogged him for many years\n\nJohn Hiatt’s sales have never quite matched his reputation. Hiatt’s songs were covered successfully by everyone from Bonnie Raitt, Ronnie Milsap, and Dr. Feelgood to Iggy Pop, Three Dog Night, and the Neville Brothers, yet it took him 13 years to reach the charts himself. Of course, it took him nearly that long to find his own style. Hiatt began his solo career in 1974, and over the next decade he ran through a number of different styles, from rock & roll to new wave pop, before he finally settled on a rootsy fusion of rock & roll, country, blues, and folk with his 1987 album Bring the Family. Though the album didn’t set the charts on fire, it became his first album to reach the charts, and several of the songs on the record became hits for other artists, including Raitt and Milsap. Following its success, Hiatt became a reliable hit songwriter for other artists, and he developed a strong cult following that continued to gain strength into the mid-’90s.\n\nWhile he was growing up in his hometown of Indianapolis, Indiana, Hiatt played in a number of garage bands. Initially, he was inspired by the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, and the music of those two artists would echo strongly throughout his work. Out of all the bar bands he played with in the late ’60s, a group called the White Ducks was the one that received the most attention. He wrote his first song in 1963 entitled “Beth Ann.”\n\nHe moved to Nashville, Tennessee when he was 18 years old and got a job as a songwriter for the Tree-Music Publishing Company for $25 a week. Hiatt, who was unable to read or write scores, had to record all 250 songs he wrote for the company.Following his high school graduation, he moved to Nashville at the age of 18, where he landed a job as a songwriter for Tree Publishing. Since then he has released 21 studio albums, two compilation albums and one live album. His songs have been covered by a variety of artists in multiple genres, including Bob Dylan, The Searchers, Delbert McClinton, Willy DeVille, Ry Cooder, Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, B.B. King, Joe Bonamassa, Willie Nelson, Three Dog Night, Joan Baez, Paula Abdul, Buddy Guy, the Desert Rose Band, Jimmy Buffett, Mandy Moore, Iggy Pop, Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, Dave Edmunds, Nick Lowe, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Rosanne Cash, Suzy Bogguss, Jewel,Aaron Neville, Jeff Healey, Keith Urban, Joe Cocker, Chaka Khan, Paulini and many others. The Dutch singer/songwriter Ilse DeLange recorded the album Dear John with nine of his songs. and Three Dog Night, who took Hiatt’s “Sure as I’m Sittin’ Here” to number 16 in the summer of 1974. Eventually, his manager secured him an audition at Epic Records, and the label signed him in 1974, releasing his debut album, Hangin’ Around the Observatory, later that year. Despite their critical acclaim, neither Hangin’ Around the Observatory nor its 1975 follow-up, Overcoats, sold many copies, and he was dropped by the label. By the end of the year, Tree Publishing had let him go as well.\n\nFollowing his failure in Nashville, Hiatt moved out to California. By the summer of 1978 he had settled in Los Angeles, where began playing in clubs, opening for folk musicians including Leo Kottke. With Kottke’s assistance, Hiatt hired a new manager, Denny Bruce, who helped him secure a record contract with MCA Records. Slug Line, his first record for MCA, was released in the summer of 1979. Where his first two records were straight-ahead rock & roll and folk-rock, Slug Line was in the new wave vein of angry English singer/songwriters like Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, and Joe Jackson, as if Hiatt was vying for the role of the American angry young man. The new approach earned some strong reviews, yet it failed to generate any sales. Two Bit Monsters, his second MCA album, faced the same situation. Although it was well received critically upon its 1980 release, it made no impression on the charts, and the label dropped him.\n\nApart from working on Two Bit Monsters, Hiatt spent most of 1980 as a member of Ry Cooder’s backing band, playing rhythm guitar on the Borderline album and touring with the guitarist. Hiatt stayed with Cooder throughout 1981, signing a new contract with Geffen Records by the end of the year. Produced by Tony Visconti (David Bowie, T. Rex), his Geffen debut All of a Sudden was released in 1982, followed by the Nick Lowe/Scott Matthews and Ron Nagel-produced Riding with the King in 1983. As with his previous records for Epic and MCA, neither of his first two Geffen releases sold well. By this time, Hiatt’s personal life was beginning to spin out of control as he was sinking deep into alcoholism. Around the time he completed 1985’s Warming Up to the Ice Age, his second wife committed suicide. Following the release of Warming Up to the Ice Age, Hiatt was dropped by Geffen. By the end of 1985, he had entered a rehabilitation program. During 1986, he remarried and signed a new deal with A&M Records.\n\nFor his A&M debut, Hiatt assembled a small band comprised of his former associates Ry Cooder (guitar), Nick Lowe (bass), and Jim Keltner (drums). Recorded over the course of a handful of days, the resulting album, Bring the Family, had a direct, stripped-down rootsy sound that differed greatly from his earlier albums. Upon its summer 1987 release, Bring the Family received the best reviews of his career and, for once, the reviews began to pay off, as the album turned into a cult hit, peaking at 107 on the U.S. charts; it was his first charting album. Hiatt attempted to record a follow-up with Cooder, Lowe, and Keltner, but the musicians failed to agree on the financial terms for the sessions. Undaunted, he recorded an album with John Doe, David Lindley, and Dave Mattacks, but he scrapped the completed project, deciding that the result was too forced. Hiatt’s final attempt at recording the follow-up to Bring the Family was orchestrated by veteran producer Glyn Johns, who had him record with his touring band the Goners. Despite all of the behind-the-scenes troubles behind its recording, the follow-up album, Slow Turning, actually appeared rather quickly, arriving in the summer of 1988.\n\nSlow Turning, like Bring the Family before it, received nearly unanimous positive reviews and it was fairly well received commercially, spending 31 weeks on the U.S. charts and peaking at 98. Within the next year, Hiatt successfully toured throughout America and Europe, strengthening his fan base along the way. Inspired by the success of Hiatt’s two A&M albums, Geffen released the compilation Y’ All Caught? The Ones That Got Away 1979-85 in 1989. That same year, other artists began digging through Hiatt’s catalog of songs, most notably Bonnie Raitt, who covered “Thing Called Love” for her multi-platinum comeback album, Nick of Time.\n\nIn 1990, Hiatt returned with Stolen Moments, which was nearly as successful as Slow Turning, both critically and commercially. “Bring Back Your Love to Me,” an album track from Stolen Moments that was also recorded by Earl Thomas Conley, won BMI’s 1991 Country Music Award. By the time “Bring Back Your Love to Me” won that award, it had become a standard practice for artists to cover Hiatt’s songs, as artists as diverse as Bob Dylan, Ronnie Milsap, Suzy Bogguss, and Iggy Pop all covered his songs in the early ’90s. In 1993, Rhino Records released Love Gets Strange: The Songs of John Hiatt, which collected many of the cover versions that were recorded during the ’80s and ’90s.\n\nDuring 1991, the group that recorded Bring the Family — Hiatt, Cooder, Lowe, and Keltner — re-formed as a band called Little Village, releasing their eponymous debut in early 1992. Based on the success of Bring the Family and Hiatt’s A&M albums, expectations for Little Village were quite high, yet the record and its supporting tour were considered a major disappointment. Later, the individual members would agree that the band was a failure, mainly due to conflicting egos.\n\nHiatt decided to back away from the superstar nature of Little Village for his next album, 1993’s Perfectly Good Guitar. Recorded in just two weeks with a backing band comprised of members of alternative rock bands School of Fish and Wire Train, the album was looser than any record since Bring the Family, but it didn’t quite have the staying power of its two predecessors, spending only 11 weeks on the charts and peaking at number 47. The following year, he released his first live album, Hiatt Comes Alive at Budokan? Hiatt left A&M Records after the release of the record, signing with Capitol Records the following year.\n\nWalk On, Hiatt’s first Capitol album, was recorded during his supporting tour for Perfectly Good Guitar and featured guest appearances by the Jayhawks and Bonnie Raitt. The record entered the charts at 48, but slipped from there in nine weeks, indicating that his audience had settled into a dedicated cult following. Fittingly, after 1997’s Little Head quickly came and went in the marketplace, Hiatt parted ways with Capitol, and his next album, 2000’s Crossing Muddy Waters, was released on the established independent imprint Vanguard Records. After a second album with Vanguard, The Tiki Bar Is Open, Hiatt aligned himself with another independent label, New West, for the release of his 2003 set, Beneath This Gruff Exterior. Master of Disaster, along with CD and DVD versions of Live from Austin, TX, followed in 2005 but his 18th studio album, Same Old Man, didn’t appear until 2008.\n\nHowever, when The Open Road arrived early in 2010, it signified the start of a prolific period for the artist, and featured Patty Griffin collaborator Doug Lancio on guitar. Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns followed in 2010 and was recorded and produced in Nashville by Kevin Shirley (Aerosmith, the Black Crowes). Next, Mystic Pinball arrived in the fall of 2012; again produced by Shirley, it debuted at 39 on the Billboard 200. Lancio oversaw the sessions for Hiatt’s subsequent album, a largely acoustic-based set entitled Terms of My Surrender, which was released by New West on July 15, 2014.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSlashing his speakers to create that distorted “You Really Got Me” sound, Davies has clearly been thinking outside the box from the early Kinks days onward. In the late Seventies, Davies became deeply interested in telepathy and mental visualization, and claims to have used these concepts to energize or heal concert audiences many times since then. In 1982, he was telepathically contacted by “five distinct intelligences” from another dimension, who significantly enhanced his consciousness and taught him the principles of “etheric magnetism.” Davies loves to scan the skies for UFOs, and extraterrestrial elements abound on Purusha and the Spiritual Planet, the techno/dance/New Age record he recorded in 1998 with his son Russell. DD is going strong in 2016.\n\nDavies was born at 6 Denmark Terrace, Muswell Hill, North London on February 3, 1947.He was born the last of eight children, including six older sisters and an older brother, later band mate Ray. As children, the Davies brothers were immersed in a world of different musical styles, from the music hall of their parents’ generation, to the jazz and early rock n’ roll that their older sisters listened to. The siblings developed a rivalry early on, with both brothers competing for their parents’ and sisters’ attention.\n\nDavies learned the guitar and played his first show with his older brother, Ray Davies, at the age of 13.\n\nDavies grew up playing skiffle, but soon bought an electric guitar and started experimenting with rock. The Davies brothers and friend Pete Quaife jammed together in the front room of their house. Activities in the Davies household centred around this front room, culminating in large parties, where Davies’ parents would sing and play piano together. The front room and these parties were musically nurturing to the Davies brothers, later influencing the Kinks’ interpretations of the traditional British music hall style. Dave and his brother worked out the famous two-chord riff of their 1964 hit, “You Really Got Me”, on the piano in the front room.\n\nRay and Dave Davies remained the only two steady members of the band (with the exception of Avory until his departure) throughout their run together. They were accompanied by an oft-changing roster of bassists and keyboardists. Davies played a largely subordinate role to his brother, often staying behind the scenes. Davies would make occasional contributions on Kinks records as lead vocalist and songwriter, with classics such as “Party Line” (the lyrics were written by Ray Davies and the song has been attributed to Ray on many editions of “Face to Face”) and “Death of a Clown.”\n\nDavies was solely responsible for the signature distorted power chord sound on the Kinks’ first hit, “You Really Got Me”. He achieved the sound by using a razor blade to slit the speaker cone on his Elpico amplifier, which he then ran through a larger Vox as a “pre-amp.” This sound was one of the first mainstream appearances of guitar distortion, which was to have a major influence on many later musicians, especially in heavy metal and punk rock.\n\n“You Really Got Me” was the group’s third released single, after two previous recordings that failed to chart. They had a three-single contract with Pye Records, and needed a hit to get another. Pye didn’t like the song and refused to pay for studio time.The band arranged other financial support to cut the single, which became a massive hit, topping the charts in the UK and reaching #7 in the U.S.\n\nThe Kinks released their self-titled debut album in 1964, and embarked on a world tour a year later. While the band came together seamlessly enough, conflict was always in the background. A rivalry had festered between the Davies brothers since childhood, and Dave Davies and drummer Mick Avory soon developed a tumultuous relationship, as well. They fought on stage during their first tour, when, after playing one song, Davies insulted Avory and toppled his drum set. Avory struck Davies with his cymbal stand, knocked him unconscious and caused a gash that required 16 stitches. Later that year, the American Federation of Musicians denied the group the permits required to play in the United States, and although they didn’t specify the reason, many believed it was because of these kinds of incidents.\n\nIn spite of internal feuds, the band was garnering both commercial and critical acclaim. Although he often took a backseat to his brother, Dave Davies was an excellent musician in his own right. With his signature, dissonant chord in “You’ve Really Got Me,” he influenced musicians of the day by being the first mainstream guitarist to use distortion on an album. In the past, as a member of the Kinks, Dave Davies had only released his own compositions on B-sides and as part of albums. The Kinks’record label sensed potential sales in a solo release from the overlooked Davies, and issued “Death of a Clown” as his debut. Although credited to Davies, it was technically a Kinks recording, as his backing band was the Kinks.\n\nThe Kinks released three albums and several EPs in the next two years. They also performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours with the likes of the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn, which caused tension within the band. Some legendary on-stage fights erupted during this time as well. The most notorious incident was at the Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales, in May 1965, involving drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies. The fight broke out during the second number of the set, “Beautiful Delilah”. It culminated with Davies insulting Avory and kicking over his drum set after finishing the first song, “You Really Got Me”. Avory responded by knocking down Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious. He then fled from the scene, and Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to the head. Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other.\n\nDuring the late 1960s the group steadily evolved, as Ray’s songwriting skills developed and he began to lead the group in a whole new direction.The group abandoned the traditional R&B/blues sound and adopted a more nostalgic, reflective style of music, as showcased on songs like “Autumn Almanac” and “Waterloo Sunset”, as well as their albums, such as Something Else by the Kinks and The Village Green Preservation Society.\n\nIn spite of internal feuds, the band was garnering both commercial and critical acclaim. Although he often took a backseat to his brother, Dave Davies was an excellent musician in his own right. With his signature, dissonant chord in “You’ve Really Got Me,” he influenced musicians of the day by being the first mainstream guitarist to use distortion on an album. In the past, as a member of the Kinks, Dave Davies had only released his own compositions on B-sides and as part of albums. The Kinks’record label sensed potential sales in a solo release from the overlooked Davies, and issued “Death of a Clown” as his debut. Although credited to Davies, it was technically a Kinks recording, as his backing band was the Kinks.\n\nUpon its release, “Death of a Clown” rose to number three on the UK Singles Chart. Wanting to profit off of the new buzz suddenly surrounding Davies, a solo LP was slated for release some time in 1968 or 1969. The follow-up single, “Susannah’s Still Alive”, was released in November 1967; however, it only reached #20 on the Melody Maker chart. The release of the solo album was held back, and it was decided to wait and see how another single would fare. As anticipation grew for the release of the new LP, it was nicknamed A Hole in the Sock Of.] “Lincoln County” was chosen as the next single, but failed to chart. By the time a fourth single “Hold My Hand” met with the same result, a combination of Davies’ own lack of interest in continuing and Pye’s decision to stop killed off any hopes of an album.\n\nEventually the tracks intended for Davies’ first solo album were assembled for a 2011 compilation by Andrew Sandoval entitled Hidden Treasures. It combined the singles, B-sides that were released for various Kinks singles and a handful of album tracks that Dave had recorded for Kinks albums. Three tracks included on “Hidden Treasures” had never been released before until this compilation “Do You Wish To Be A Man”, “Crying” and “Are You Ready”. Many of these tracks had been assembled previously for “The Album That Never Was” released in 1987 but this album primarily consisted of the released singles and b-sides that Davies recorded and released from 1967-1969.\n\nIn 1970, the Kinks scored a massive international hit with :Lola.” The story of a transvestite was very controversial at that time, and many stations, particularly below the Mason Dixon Line. In spite of that, it was a huge success. In 1980 a version of this song on the “One for the Road – Kinks Live” got enormous airplay resulting in a Billboard Top 10 Album.\n\nThe Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society and Arthur were released in 1968 and 1969, respectively. Although they received unanimous acclaim,Village Green failed to chart internationally, and Arthur was met with a mediocre commercial reception. These records, although praised by critics and the rock press, were commercial failures.\n\nin 1970. Dave recorded two songs of his own for this LP, the acoustic “Strangers” and the hard-rocking “Rats”. The rootsy country-rock, and Americana themed Muswell Hillbillies was released in late 1971, and was well-received with critics, but failed to sell strongly. Their next five albums, Everybody’s in Show-Biz,Preservation: Act 1, Preservation: Act 2, The Kinks Present A Soap Opera and Schoolboys in Disgrace, which added a large theatrical ensemble, were critical and commercial failures.\n\nDavies made several attempts at solo albums throughout the ’70s, but he never felt enough enthusiasm or interest to see the projects through. He would often act as the producer and engineer at the Kinks’ main studio, Konk, in his spare time, producing albums for the likes of several popular rockers of the day. Ray Davies commented on his brother’s studio and solo work in a November 1975 interview:\n\nMy brother is all right, his life is dedicated to getting the [Konk] studio together. He’s really into that. He’s started recording, but I might even have to get a contract with him and say he’s got to deliver [a solo] album. It may be the only way he’s going to record is at gunpoint.\n\n— in Hit Parader Magazine\n\nThe Kinks left RCA Records in 1977, switching to Arista. The group shed all of the extra backing vocalists and brass instrumentalists that had accompanied them throughout their theatrical years, and reverted to a five-piece rock group again. Their debut LP for Arista was entitled Sleepwalker, and was a commercial and critical comeback for the group. It was the first album in what critics usually call the “arena rock” phase of the group, in which more commercial and mainstream production techniques would be employed.Dave later commented that he was glad to be back to more guitar-oriented songs, and he has listed Sleepwalker as one of his favourites. His composition and earnest, almost desperate lead vocals, not to mention his particularly ripping lead guitar sound, led to airplay — especially on college stations — for his idealistic “Trust Your Heart” on the 1978 Misfits album.\n\nDavies would see the group through both success and failure, as they reached their commercial peak in the early 1980s. The group began adjusting their commercial methods, embracing the MTV culture that was selling records at the time. The music video for their 1982/83 single “Come Dancing” helped hoist the record to #12 on the UK charts, and #6 in the U.S — their biggest hit since “Tired of Waiting for You” in 1965. The song was a nostalgic look back at childhood memories of the Davies brothers, remembering their elder sisters going out to dance at the local palais, and coming back home to the front room at 6 Denmark Terrace.\n\nThe Kinks’ popularity faltered in 1985, and soon their records ceased to chart altogether. Mick Avory left the band after the Kinks’ last album for Arista, Word of Mouth, mainly due to the growing animosity between him and Dave Davies.Ray Davies said that Avory was his best friend in the band and he unwillingly had to choose sides, as said later in a 1989 interview:\n\nThe saddest day for me was when Mick left. Dave and Mick didn’t get along. There were terrible fights, and I got to the point where I couldn’t cope with it any more…Mick had an important sound. Mick wasn’t a great drummer, but he was a jazz drummer — same school, same era as Charlie Watts.\n\nBob Henrit was brought in to take Avory’s place. At Ray Davies’ invitation Avory agreed to manage Konk Studios, where he also served as a producer and occasional contributor on later Kinks albums.\n\nThe group switched to MCA (US) and London (UK) records in late 1985, and began work on their next album, Think Visual. The record was released in 1986, but only reached #81 on the Billboard charts. Critics were lukewarm towards it, and it did not receive significant radio play. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic.com later commented that the album “represented an artistic dead end for the Kinks, as Ray Davies continued to crank out a series of competent, but undistinguished hard rockers.” Dave Davies contributed two songs to Think Visual, “Rock ‘n’ Roll Cities” and “When You were a Child”. Rock ‘n’ Roll Cities was chosen in the US as the lead single for Think Visual, and at its release it received a fair amount of play on mainstream rock radio. Davies and Mick Avory seemingly reconciled, as Davies asked him back to play drums on this track.\n\nThe group recorded several more records for MCA, their last studio effort for them being 1989’s UK Jive. UK Jive was received slightly better than Think Visual, but it failed to enter into the Top 100. Dave Davies contributed the song “Dear Margaret” to the vinyl record — the cassette and CD of the album also contained two further Dave Davies songs, “Bright Lights” and “Perfect Strangers”.\n\nThe group left MCA and struggled to find a record label that would accept them. All four original members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990, but this failed to revive their career. Eventually the Kinks signed to Columbia records, who released their final studio album together, Phobia, on 13 April 1993. Despite lots of publicity pushing and press attention, the record was unsuccessful, peaking at #166. Singles released failed to chart as well, mainly due to a record label mix-up that delivered the records to store a few weeks late. To Phobia Davies contributed the songs “It’s Alright (Don’t Think About It)” and “Close to the Wire”.\n\nColumbia dropped the group in 1994, forcing them to retreat back to their old Konk Records. The group released To The Bone on the small independent Grapevine Records in 1994.\n\nThe Kinks took a break from recording and touring in 1996. Ray and Dave reunited onstage to perform “You Really Got Me” onstage at the Islington Assembly Hall in London on 18 December 2015. Rolling Stone magazine called their performance “rousing”.\n\nAfter the aborted solo effort, Davies’ solo career was not revived until 1980, with the release of Dave Davies (AFL1-3603), which featured Davies performing all the instruments by himself. The album, named after its own serial number, peaked at #42 on the Billboard 200. He went on to release Glamour (1981), which charted at #152. Davies brought in a back-up band to play with him on this record. Chosen People was released in 1983, but failed to crack the Billboard 200.\n\nDavies had a stroke in 2004 while leaving an interview at the BBC. He has since recovered almost completely and continues to write and record music.\n\nDavies released his first true solo studio album in twenty years, Bug, in 2002. Fractured Mindz followed in January 2007, his first album of all new material in nearly five years. It was also his first new studio effort since his stroke in the summer of 2004 besides the track “God in my Brain” (which was recorded and released on the compilation album Kinked in January 2006).\n\nTwo Worlds was recorded throughout 2010 by The Aschere Project, the production team of Dave Davies and his son Russ Davies. Both members wrote, produced, and recorded all the tracks. About the album’s genre, Dave stated “it’s a mixture of rock, kinda classical and electronic music.” In February 2010, Davies released an autobiographical DVD filmed by his other son, titled Mystical Journey. His planned US tour in support of the release was postponed per doctor’s advice.It was announced in February 2013 that on 4 June 2013, Davies would be releasing his sixth studio album entitled I Will Be Me worldwide. Davies undertook a short tour of the US to promote the album Dave Davies performed his first UK show in thirteen years in February 2014.In October 2014, to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Kinks, a new album by Davies, with many tracks looking back to the start of the band, titled Rippin’ Up Time was released. Davies appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to promote the album in 2014. This episode was the highest rated Tonight Show episode in 2014.\n\nIn 2015 the Dave Davies solo album Rippin Up New York City was released on Red River Entertainment. Dave Davies embarked on a solo tour to promote the album in the USA in October and November. On 18 December he was joined onstage by brother Ray Davies to perform the Kinks’ hit ‘You Really Got Me’ together at Dave Davies’ concert in London at the Islington Assembly Hall. This marked the first time in nearly 20 years that the brothers had appeared and performed together.Other band members included Jonathan Lea on second guitar, Tom Currier on bass, Dennis Diken of the Smithereens on drums and Debi Doss and Rebecca Wilson on backing vocals.\n\nIn 1990, Graham Nash inducted The Kinks into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and performed a rockin’ version of “All Day and All of the Night.”\n\nAt age 15, Davies was caught having sex with his girlfriend at his high school, and was subsequently expelled from school. He later discovered that she was pregnant, and their families forced them apart. He didn’t meet his daughter until 1993, and the experience deeply affected him and his work. He wrote a number of songs about the struggle, including “Funny Face,” “Susannah’s Still Alive” and “Mindless Child of Motherhood.”In addition to the daughter he fathered at 15, Davies married in 1967 and had four sons. He and his wife divorced in 1990. He also has three children from another relationship.\n\nDavies is bisexual, a fact that he discusses at-length in his 1996 autobiography, Kink.\n\n.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
