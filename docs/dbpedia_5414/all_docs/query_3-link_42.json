        "text": "Country Rock 1973: To Be Or Not To Be March 22, 2010\n\nPosted by vsap in Blogroll.\n\nTags: Bob Dylan, Byrds, Chet Atkins, Country rock music, Flying Burrito Brothers, Gram Parsons, Jerry Jeff Walker, Michael Nesmith, NRPS, Poco, Ricky Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson\n\nIt can be argued when rock music started to be infused with country music. I have taken readers back as far as 1964 with the Beatles but others could argue for Elvis, Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, and the like, and possibly make a case IF there was no discernible difference between genres (i.e., Rockabilly and Country Rock). I believe there is a difference and I have, based on that position, fundamentally ignored certain artists who some might believe need to be included. Furthermore, there is a country music side of the equation I have not addressed, along with some notable female artists, and I will try to rectify that in this and the next installments.\n\nThere was an enormous wave of influential music produced to propel country rock as a genre from 1968-1972. As rock bands re-shaped themselves (e.g., Byrds) or crumbled and new creations arose (e.g., Buffalo Springfield), or artists simply wanted another creative outlet (e.g., Jerry Garcia with NRPS), the genre built a firm footing and seemed poised to grow. However, 1973 would bring a storm that seemed to begin to scatter some bands while the creative juices seemed to be running out or not so sweet.\n\nLet’s take a look at the releases that shaped 1973:\n\nGram Parsons, GP, January 1973\n\nWaylon Jennings, Lonesome, On’ry and Mean, March 1973\n\nByrds, self-titled (Reunion), March 7, 1973\n\nMichael Nesmith, Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash, Recorded in March 1973\n\nEagles, Desperado, April 17, 1973\n\nBob Dylan, Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid (soundtrack), July 16, 1973\n\nWaylon Jennings, Honky Tonk Heroes, July 1973\n\nGram Parsons, Grievous Angel, recorded in July 1973, released January 1974\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd, Pronounced…, August 13, 1973\n\nJerry Jeff Walker, Viva Terlingua, Recorded August 18, 1973\n\nPoco, Crazy Eyes, September 15, 1973\n\nNeil Young, Time Fades Away, October 15, 1973\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival, Live In Europe, October 16, 1973 (recorded in 1971)\n\nCommander Cody, Country Casanova, November 1973\n\nNew Riders of the Purple Sage, The Adventures of Panama Red, December 1973\n\nWillie Nelson, Shotgun Willie, Unknown date 1973\n\nEverly Brothers, Pass The Chicken & Listen, Unknown date 1973\n\nRicky Nelson, Garden Party, Unknown date 1973\n\nCharlie Daniels, Honey In The Rock, Unknown date 1973\n\nChet Atkins, Alone, Unknown date 1973\n\nGram Parsons\n\nMuch has been written and tributes paid to Gram Parsons (November 5, 1946 – September 19, 1973). For whatever he was or was not, one thing is certain to my ear: he had an evocative voice and style. He wanted to create what he called a “Cosmic American Music”. Most people could interpret that as simply drug-enhanced hippie cowboy music and, in truth, that’s fairly accurate. As I have stated in another installment of this trilogy, the post-Sweetheart Byrds were probably the best at fulfilling Parson’s concept. Bands like The New Riders of the Purple Sage and Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen and Michael Nesmith did it, too, I believe, but put more of a country kick to it.\n\nGP assembled the best available musicians at the time. How could it be a mediocre recording with the likes of Emmy Lou Harris, James Burton, Buddy Emmons, Al Perkins, Glen D. Hardin, Byron Berline, Alan Munde, and Ric Grech? It could not even when Parsons tried.\n\nGrievous Angel saw Harris, Perkins, Berline and Hardin (along with Ronnie Tutt who had done some drum work on GP) return, and added Emory Gordy on bass, Linda Ronstadt (on harmony vocal for “In My Hour of Darkness”), Herb Pederson and Bernie Leadon. Again, even if Parsons had tried this could not have been a mediocre record. This was another one of those rare albums where it’s difficult to find a clinker. It’s just that good. Unfortunately, it would be the last we’d hear from Parsons except through compilations of previously unreleased material like on Sleepless Nights (1976) with the Burritos and Live 1973 (1982) or The Complete Reprise Sessions (GP and Grievous Angel combined with other material, 2006) and Live At The Avalon Ballroom 1969 (with the Burritos, 2007).\n\nByrds\n\nIn an earlier installment I called the Byrds reunion album a disappointment. It was in the sense that few original songs were included notwithstanding the fact that all five original members were present. Two Neil Young songs, one Joni Mitchell song and a David Crosby re-make is too much unoriginal material for the likes of the Byrds at that moment in time. They did sound good in spite of it. “Born To Rock N Roll” and “Long Live The King” were the major clunkers while “Cowgirl In The Sand” was anemic at best. The Byrds were done and it wasn’t the high note fans might have hoped for.\n\nPoco\n\n“A Good Feelin’ To Know” (1972) was supposed to catapult Poco to the next level: an Eagles-like stardom, an enduring legacy. When it did not, “Crazy Eyes” signaled the end of the Richie Furay era for the band. In fact, “Crazy Eyes” was a better record than “Good Feelin’ To Know” but, like “From The Inside”, it had an ominous feel.\n\nThere was plenty to love for the country fan: “Blue Water”, Fool’s Gold”, “Brass Buttons” (by Gram Parsons), and “Magnolia” (by J.J. Cale). There was plenty to love for the rock fan: “A Right Along”, “Let’s Dance Tonight”, and “Here We Go Again”. Then there was the title track: all 9 minutes and thirty-nine seconds of symphonic bombast interspersed with Rusty Young’s banjo respites. I thought it was majestic and a fitting tribute to Gram Parsons. One reviewer at the time said the music of the song “Crazy Eyes” moved like a giant robot through a city. That’s accurate. Yet, all the elements were there: tight harmonies and superb musicianship. And it would be all-in for Richie Furay, who would leave to form the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band with Chris Hillman and J.D. Souther. Poco would survive losing both founding fathers (Furay and Messina) and there will be more about them in the next installment.\n\nThey Don’t Belong At All\n\nAdmittedly there are some odd entries for 1973. In my opinion, it is in part due to the rise of “outlaw country”. That electrified brand of country that was personified by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson in the 1970s, but brought to us by a rather unexpected source: Chet Atkins. One writer said that Atkins, while a record producer for RCA on Nashville’s “Music Row”, kept Waylon and Willie in the fold not because of brisk sales, but because he believed in them – he believed they would “catch on”. And catch they did!\n\nAs the rock side of the equation had its member leaning over to country, the country side had its members leaning over to rock. Lynyrd Skynrd is no more country rock than Bruce Springsteen EXCEPT for “Give Me Three Steps” from their 1973 debut album. Waylon and Willie and one-offs like Skynrd’s “3Steps” helped make the Toby Keith’s and Big & Rich’s of the contemporary country world possible.\n\nWhat is mainstream country music now would have seemed incredible, impossible, to Music Row execs at the time…except Atkins, of course.\n\nOutlaw Country, Southern Rock, Hippie/Slacker/Doper Cowboy, even Southern California Rock, all piled on to help make 1973 a wild year.\n\nJerry Jeff Walker\n\nIn the middle of the hot summer of 1973 came Jerry Jeff Walker with “Viva Terlingua”. This was an odd combination of New Riders of the Purple Sage, Panama Red vintage, Waylon and Willie, drinkin’ and carousin’ vintage, with a self-effacing sense of humor. There are several memorable tunes, not to mention Gary P. Nunn’s “London Homesick Blues” that has had quite a run as the theme song for the PBS show “Austin City Limits”. “Up Against The Wall, Redneck Mother”, “Backslider’s Wine”, “Gettin’ By” and “Desperadoes Waiting for a Train” were all in the lazy country rock wheelhouse, even if not originally intended as such. And played live, well, there is a relaxed nature in this recording that doesn’t allow you to feel bad. And in the summer of 1973, that was quite an achievement.\n\nWhat now?\n\nGram Parsons had died of a drug overdose in September. “PigPen” of the Grateful Dead died of a stomach hemorrhage. Jim Croce died in a plane crash. The Everly Brothers broke up on stage at Knot’s Berry Farm. The Byrds and Burritos were gone and Poco was unraveling. Yet, there was hope.\n\nNew Riders of the Purple Sage\n\nYou could almost hear fans and casual listeners say, “We waited all year for this”, when “The Adventures of Panama Red” finally made it to the record stores in December 1973. While this was a studio album, it was a perfect mate to Walker’s “Viva Terlingua”. With more humor, if that’s possible. New Riders of the Purple Sage, flying without Jerry Garcia, hit their stride with David Nelson, John Dawson, Dave Torbert, Spencer Dryden and Buddy Cage taking over on steel guitar. It was the up-tick needed to leave an odd year.\n\nThe next installment will take us into 1974. Maybe things will be better.\n\nCollision Course 2: Country and Rock Music 1971-1972 March 15, 2010\n\nPosted by vsap in Blogroll.\n\nTags: Byrds, Country rock music, Eagles, Flying Burrito Brothers, Manassas, Michael Nesmith, Neil Young, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Poco, Pure Prairie League, Stephen Stills\n\nThe country rock music genre flourished in the early 1970s. It had some stiff competition, especially with rock, R&B and jazz albums recorded and/or released in 1971 and 1972, but it came to be part of an audiophile’s collection, if not a staple.\n\nHere’s a sample and I’m sure readers can add their own recollections:\n\nElton John, Tumbleweed Connection, October 30, 1970 (in UK, 1971 USA)\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young, 4-Way Street, April 7, 1971 (recorded live July 2-5, 1970)\n\nMichael Nesmith & The First National Band, Nevada Fighter, May 9, 1971\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers, self-titled, June 1971\n\nByrds, Byrdmaniax, June 23, 1971\n\nNew Riders of the Purple Sage, self-titled, August 1971\n\nPoco, From The Inside, September 5, 1971\n\nRick Nelson, Rudy The Fifth, October 1971\n\nByrds, Farther Along, November 17, 1971\n\nAmerica, self-titled, December 31, 1971\n\nCommander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen, Lost In The Ozone,\n\n– recorded April-July 1971, release date Unknown 1971\n\nCharlie Daniels, self-titled, Unknown date 1971\n\nNeil Young, Harvest, February 14, 1972\n\nNew Riders of the Purple Sage, Powerglide, March 1972\n\nPure Prairie League, self-titled, March 1972\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival, Mardi Gras, April 11, 1972\n\nStephen Stills & Manassas, self-titled, April 12, 1972\n\nElton John, Honky Chateau, May 12, 1972\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers, Last of the Red Hot Burritos, May 1972\n\nCommander Cody, Hot Licks, Cold Steel & Trucker Favorites, May 1972\n\nRick Nelson, “Garden Party” single, June 1972\n\nEagles, self-titled, June 17, 1972\n\nPure Prairie League, Bustin’ Out, August 1972\n\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band, May The Circle Be Unbroken, August 1972\n\nPoco, A Good Feelin’ To Know, September 25, 1972\n\nNew Riders of the Purple Sage, Gypsy Cowboy, December 1972\n\nEverly Brothers, Stories We Could Tell, Unknown date 1972\n\nMichael Nesmith & The Second National Band, Tantamount to Treason Vol. 1, 1972\n\nDan Fogelberg, Home Free, Unknown date 1972\n\nCharlie Daniels, John, Grease & Wolfman, Unknown date 1972\n\nHeartsfield, self-titled, Unknown date 1972\n\nElton John?\n\nYes, not even Elton John was unaffected by the emerging country rock genre. Though I don’t believe Tumbleweed Connection or Honky Chateau were true country rock albums, I do believe his affinity (or lack of same, depending on how you read his songs) for the Old American South, compelled him to write songs like “Ballad of the Well-Known Gun”, “Country Comfort”, and “My Father’s Gun”, on Tumbleweed Connection and “Slave”, “Honky Cat” and “Salvation” on Honky Chateau. There will be those justified in excluding such selections from discussion of country rock, but I respectfully disagree and include the now Sir Elton here for your consideration.\n\nBack to the Real Deal\n\nThis two-year period, 1971-72, produced about 10 more country rock albums than the previous two years. New additions included Michael Nesmith’s First & Second National Bands, New Riders of the Purple Sage, America, Charlie Daniels, Pure Prairie League, Eagles, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Rick Nelson, Dan Fogelberg and Heartsfield. Before we visit some of them, let’s look at how some of the originators fared during this time.\n\nByrds\n\nThe first resurrection of the Byrds was on 1969’s Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde. Roger McGuinn had apparently lost it all: Chris Hillman, Gram Parsons and Michael Clarke all landing with the Burritos. However, there was a brief before his exit that Hillman saw two exemplary musicians come aboard: Clarence White and Gene Parsons. The Byrds had risen from the “firing” of David Crosby in October 1967 to begin to re-make themselves with The Notorious Byrd Brothers. Of course, that didn’t do it but what followed, Sweetheart of the Rodeo, did. With the departure from pure rock or pop music, McGuinn risked leading his new Byrds in a slightly different direction. That journey began with Dr. Byrds in 1969 and would include, Untitled (1970), Byrdmaniax and Farther Along (1971). McGuinn, White and Parsons would endure this period with John York on bass for Dr. Byrds and Ballad only to be replaced by Skip Battin who would finish out the string. In reality, this flock of Byrds didn’t make it passed 1971. Nevertheless, the bright spot was White’s guitar.\n\nTo sample Clarence White’s superb work with the Byrds you need only listen to these: “Ballad of Easy Rider”, “It’s All Over Now Baby Blue”, “Jesus Is Just Alright”, “This Wheel’s On Fire”, Old Blue”, “Drug Store Truck Drivin’ Man”, “Chestnut Mare”, “Take A Whiff”, and “Farther Along”. You’ll want to hear the rest of his work with the Kentucky Colonels, Nashville West, and the Muleskinners.\n\nAnd, that guitar work was made even more memorable due to the B-Bender. It was an innovation that, in large measure, allowed the Byrds (and subsequent bands) to get that country feel without a pedal steel guitar player. As mentioned previously, the B-Bender was invented in 1967 by Gene Parsons and White. The device was originally the Parsons/White Pull-String, then the StringBender, but now known as the B-Bender. Parson’s early work included bending devices for the E, B, G and D strings, but White preferred a single B string bender. The best explanation I found came from an April 2004 Vintage Guitar magazine article by Dan Forte and Edward Driscoll. It stated:\n\n“The B string is bent up a full tone by pulling the guitar neck down. This puts pressure on the strap, which is attached to a spring-loaded lever at the base of the neck. The lever arm passes through the body of the guitar and is connected to the B string behind the bridge. White’s 1956 Telecaster with the original Pull-String is now owned and regularly played by Marty Stuart.”\n\nCritics at the time panned both Byrdmaniax and Farther Along. To my ear, the Byrds were the creators of the lazy/stoner/slacker or hippie country rock you would come to know from New Riders of the Purple Sage and Commander Cody. Unfortunately, the Byrds didn’t seem to have nearly the fun with it that NRPS or Commander Cody did. We can argue whether or not the Byrds left us on a down note with the immensely talented core of McGuin, White, Parsons and Battin, but we cannot deny their imprint on the genre and the others that came after them.\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers\n\nThe Burritos added Bernie Leadon after the departure of Chris Ethridge for 1970’s Burrito Deluxe, then replaced Gram Parson with Rick Roberts for 1971’s self-titled final studio album. Leadon made an immediate impact by co-writing three songs (“Man In The Fog”, “Older Guys” and “Cody, Cody”) and contributing “God’s Own Singer” by his own hand on Deluxe. He contributed no songs to the 1971 effort but allowed his guitar and banjo to do the work with exceptional results especially on “Hand To Mouth,” “Four Days of Rain” and “Why Are You Crying?” The latter two songs were written by Roberts and the former co-written by Roberts with Hillman. Leadon and Roberts softened the rough edges of the Burritos. By contrast, this was an understated and mostly underappreciated effort. Even Merle Haggard’s “White Line Fever” and “Can’t You Hear Me Callin’” managed to hint at the raucous nature of the original Burritos line up. Underpinning it all was still Sneaky Pete Kleinow’s evolving steel guitar playing and Michael Clarke, easily “King of the 4/4 Beat” (so dubbed by Jim Dickson).\n\nKleinow and Leadon wouldn’t make it to the last Burritos album of the era, Last of the Red Hot Burritos, a live album released in 1972. Al Perkins took up the pedal steel, lead guitar and pull-string guitar duties, assisted by members of the Country Gazette: Kenny Wertz on banjo and guitar, Byron Berline on fiddle, and Roger Bush on stand-up bass. A turn toward bluegrass but not from rock, this album is excellent for those who would like to get the feel of the Burritos live performance. It’s not Altamont, thankfully, but with the exception of “Don’t Fight It” and “Losing Game” this album summed up the energy the Burritos brought to the genre.\n\nPoco\n\nBy way of full disclosure: I am a Poconut. It is a challenge for me not to skew the reporting toward Poco. Thus, if I seem to lavish the praise when it would appear by any objective measure that I’ve gone “over the top”, the reader will understand the reason why.\n\nJim Messina led Poco away from its country rock roots almost immediately with the release of its self-titled album in 1970. Dallas Frazier’s “Barmaid In The Honky Tonk Downstairs”, Messina’s “You Better Think Twice” and Richie Furay’s “Don’t Let It Pass By” being the notable exceptions. The 18+ minute “Nobody’s Fool/El Tonto de Nadie, Regresa” explored nearly all the musical elements we would experience in Messina’s musical career. The rock bent is obvious on other songs and Poco even ventured into the blues with “Anyway Bye-Bye”.\n\nLike the Burritos, Poco changed bassists after it first album. Randy Meisner, (who, depending on which history of the band you believe, was really not a member but his bass and vocal work appeared on the debut album) was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit. There’s no question both offered the “soaring” vocals or high harmony that helped drive the band. Schmit’s voice and personality simply mixed better with George Grantham (drums), Furay and Messina. As with the Burritos, it was the pedal steel work that set them apart from the Byrds and others who approached it without pedal steel. That’s a credit to Rusty Young. The major difference between Poco’s Young and the Burritos Kleinow was the Leslie attached to Young’s steel guitar.\n\nWhat is the Leslie? Clifford A. Hendericksen explained it in the April 1981 edition of Recording Engineer/Producer magazine under the title “Unearthing the mysteries of the Leslie cabinet”. He wrote: “The Leslie speaker is a specially constructed amplifier and loudspeaker used to create special audio Doppler effects. Named after its inventor, Donald Leslie, it is particularly associated with the Hammond organ.” If your first encounter with Poco was their second album or a live performance, you may have wondered how that pedal steel sounded so much like an organ. There’s your answer.\n\nAnd, the Doppler effect? Researcher Alec Eden wrote this about it in 1992: “Named after Austrian physicist Christian Doppler who proposed it in 1842, the Doppler Effect (or Doppler Shift) is the change in frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. It is commonly heard when a vehicle sounding a siren or horn approaches, passes, and recedes from an observer. The received frequency is higher (compared to the emitted frequency) during the approach, it is identical at the instant of passing by, and it is lower during the recession.”\n\nClarence White adds a B-Bender. Rusty Young adds a Leslie. And you discover not only the delightful results of the collision of country and rock music, you discover there were true musical pioneers inventing new ways of delivering the sound of the new genre to the audience.\n\nThe energy of Poco’s live performances was captured with January 1971’s release of Deliverin’ which was recorded September 22-23, 1970. What most of us didn’t know at the time is that Messina was heading out and (ever the shrewd businessman and not wanting to see Poco crumble after his departure) his replacement, Paul Cotton, traveled with the group during the recording of Deliverin’. Cotton took over the lead guitar work with September 1971’s release of From The Inside.\n\nDeliverin’ set a standard that would make From The Inside appear to be a major disappointment by contrast. It was not. In fact, it was the re-birth of the country bent for Poco’s music. There is no question that From The Inside is an understated recording, but not “dark” as some have opined. Songs like “Hoedown”, “Just For me And You” and “You Are The One” displayed the optimism associated with Poco’s debut album. However, it was Cotton’s song “Bad Weather,” a slower-paced remake of a song originally recorded by his band Illinois Speed Press in 1969, remains a “hit” with audiences even today.\n\nAs far as “charting” on Billboard, Poco’s Deliverin’ did best, peaking at #26. From The Inside and A Good Feelin’ To Know peaked at #52 and #69, respectively. The latter peak was a head-scratcher at the time with the title song being so popular.\n\nA Good Feelin’ To Know was supposed to push Poco over the top, the recognition for a band that so thoroughly integrated country and rock, essentially crashed and burned at its finest moment. There was no internal wrangling. There was no artistic disagreement. The band’s live performances were improving. As the Byrds and Burritos were going by the boards, Poco was just cranking up. With the possible exception of the indulgent “Sweet Lovin’”, A Good Feelin’ To Know was perfection, or that perfect moment in time we like to remember about our favorite bands or artists.\n\nPoco was kicked to the curb in 1972 by up-starts (Billboard album peaks listed next to each) like Eagles (#22), Pure Prairie League (#34), America (#1), and veterans Neil Young (#1) and Stephen Stills & Manassas (#4).\n\nLet’s take a look at a couple of the “up-starts”.\n\nNew Riders of the Purple Sage\n\nIf the Burritos were a branch of the Byrds, then NRPS were a creek off the river of the Grateful Dead. The hippie fringe of the genre would come to fusion as famously San Francisco musicians Jerry Garcia (pedal steel) and Spencer Dryden (ex-Jefferson Airplane drummer), joined forces with like-minded John Dawson, David Nelson and Dave Tolbert to generate one of the more memorable debut albums of 1972, New Riders of the Purple Sage. It can be said of few albums, where is the weakest song? and the listener replies, there isn’t one. Garcia needed an outlet for music that simply didn’t fit with the Dead. He found a fertile, albeit brief, refuge for his art with NRPS. The music frolicked (“Henry”, “Glendale Train”, “I Don’t Know You”), was tender (“All I Ever Wanted”), mournful (“Last Lonely Eagle”) and political (“Garden of Eden”, “Dirty Business”) while preserving and furthering the fledging genre. It could have been easy for Garcia to “send up” the genre, making it look cartoonish and even foolish, but he didn’t. In contrast to the Byrds, Garcia and NRPS had fun with it and it showed.\n\nEagles\n\nGlenn Frey, Don Henley, Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon were the most polished to enter the genre with their self-titled debut album in 1972. Whether a listener preferred “Take it Easy”, “A Train Leaves Here This Morning”, “Most Of Us Are Sad”, or “Peaceful Easy Feeling” (which Leadon used the B-Bender on lead guitar work), there was plenty of country flavor to enjoy. Leadon brought his mandolin and banjo acumen along with his guitar to polish the edges of the Eagles so it would suit a mainstream palate. It is my opinion that even the rocking “Chug All Night”, “Tryin’” and “Witchy Woman” were made memorable at least in part by Leadon’s approach. Of course, the singing of Frey, Henley and Meisner dominated. They weren’t the wide-eyed optimists like Poco. They didn’t mind displaying their demons in a more “road weary” way like the Byrds and Burritos. Another difference: they could all sing lead capably and with distinction, not to mention the harmonies by this time a necessity for a country rock band.\n\nPrior to forming the Eagles, they had played as Linda Ronstadt’s backing group. Leadon is familiar to the reader from his work with Dillard & Clark and the Burritos and Meisner with Poco. Henley did some time with Shiloh while Frey (with J.D. Souther) came from Longbranch Pennywhistle.\n\nHistory has much to say about the Eagles and their various iterations, but at this moment in history they did much to bring country rock into the mainstream.\n\nAmerica\n\nIt has been said that nature abhors a vacuum. With the last Crosby, Still & Nash studio album quickly receding into the musical rear view mirror, along came America with “A Horse With No Name” in 1972. This is not truly a country rock album except that the lead vocal on this song sounded like Neil Young and the tight harmony resembled CS&N. The song was a #1 hit and the band made its living from the Southern California soft rock sound.\n\nNeil Young\n\nA recent retrospective on “Biography” (A&E Network) explained that Harvest was created in a time of new love and calm in Young’s life. “Harvest”, “Out On The Weekend”, “Old Man”, “Are You Ready For The Country” and “Heart of Gold”, helped Young keep his country ground staked out for a generation. There are the oddities: “A Man Needs A Maid” and “There’s A World”. There are the political and life commentaries: “Alabama”, “The Needle And The Damage Done”, and “Words”. Those were sufficient to warn the listener that they were still getting a record that would defy a single genre label from “Shakey”.\n\nStephen Stills & Manassas\n\nIf there was a “supergroup” for the genre, Stephen Stills & Manassas qualify on two levels: quantity (7 members) and depth (both of musicianship and of space on the record). It can be argued that only 25% of the four sides of this double-album set were set aside for country rock, but it would have been 50% or more of the single albums of most country rock bands produced in 1972. Each album side had a name and the country side is entitled “The Wilderness”. A couple on the side entitled “Consider”, “It Doesn’t Matter” and “How Far”, could be included as well.\n\nAlong for the ride with Stills (vocals, guitar, bottleneck guitar, piano, organ, electric piano, clavinette) were Chris Hillman (vocals, guitar, mandolin), Al Perkins (steel guitar, guitar, vocals), Calvin “Fuzzy” Samuels (bass), Paul Harris (organ, tack piano, piano, organ, electric piano, clavinette), Dallas Taylor (drums), and Joe Lala (percussion, vocals). Additional help came from Sydney George (harmonica), Jerry Aiello (piano, organ, electric piano, clavinette), Bill Wyman (bass), Roger Bush (acoustic bass), and Byron Berline (fiddle). All the influences from the Stones to Burritos to CS&N to Joe Walsh and beyond packed on to this record.\n\nI was present at one of their performances (Mississippi River Festival, Edwardsville, IL), when Rick Roberts appeared with them to do his song “Colorado” and Joe Walsh, the opening act, came on stage to trade some licks with Stills and Perkins. As The Outlaws would exclaim in 1975: “Green Grass and High Tides”! Indeed, for the genre this moment was its high tide.\n\nPure Prairie League\n\nSometimes it seems odd to think this band hailed from Cincinnati. Craig Fuller, Tom McGrail, Jim Caughlan and John David Call formed the original nucleus. Phil Stokes was added on bass but he and McGrail left prior to recording the first album. Jim Lanham replaced Stokes. Then, after the debut album, Caughlan and Lanham left. Fuller, George Ed Powell (guitar and vocals), William Frank (Billy) Hinds (drums, percussion) and Michael Connor (piano) filled the line-up card for the second album. James Rolleston played bass on Bustin’ Out but was not considered a member.\n\nThe debut self-titled album and the second, Bustin’ Out, were led by Fuller. “Tears”, “Take It Before You Go” and “Country Song” were the strength of the debut. While we can argue “You’re Between Me” is the strongest song on the record, I considered it more a rock song but I will acknowledge anyone who would challenge that opinion. On Bustin’ Out, of course, “Amie” put the band on the map. I believe Fred Holstein’s “Jazzman” was a folk rock song and “Call Me, Tell Me” a classic bit of Fuller cynicism that didn’t fit the genre but all others were certainly sweet and exciting additions to a strong 1972.\n\nFinal notes on 1971-1972\n\nI would be remiss if I didn’t mention the likes of “newcomers” Charlie Daniels, Dan Fogelberg along with “old hands” Michael Nesmith and Ricky Nelson. It’s hard to think of Daniels as anything but legendary today. It’s equally hard to believe we lost both Fogelberg (died December 16, 2007 from prostate cancer) and Nelson (died December 31, 1985 in a plane crash near Texarkana, TX) so early.\n\nNelson’s “Garden Party” was memorable for its line “If memories were all I sang, I’d rather drive a truck.” Makes you wonder how he would feel about all the country rock bands on the nostalgia tours today.\n\nFogelberg’s debut, Home Free, went platinum, but as a re-issue many years later. A fitting tribute nonetheless.\n\nMichael Nesmith was covered in the previous thesis but suffice it to say he continued to contribute with inventive albums form his First and Second National Bands during this period. Nevada Fighter featured musicians Red Rhodes, James Burton and Glen D. Hardin. Tantamount featured Rhodes and Jose Feliciano on congas. Nesmith founded Pacific Arts Corporation in 1974 and continues to operate it today.\n\nCollision course: Country and Rock Music, 1968-1969 March 7, 2010\n\nPosted by vsap in Blogroll, Uncategorized.\n\nTags: Buffalo Springfield, Byrds, Country rock music, Country rock music released from 1964-1970, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Crosby, Dillard & Clark, Flying Burrito Brothers, Gene Clark, Gram Parsons, Michael Nesmith, Neil Young, Poco, Stills & Nash, The Grateful Dead\n\nI wrote a Master’s thesis on the origins of “country rock” music in 1995. As we know from Richie Furay’s song, if not from experience, “nothin’ happens in the past”, so those thing fixed in history are more compliant than things of the future. I have decided to share an update of that 1995 work here.\n\nThe reason for this brief dissertation is to uncover who was truly first at this fusion of country and rock music. Separating who was merely a rock band playing country from those who actually fused the genres.\n\nArguments will ensure from this, no doubt. One thing is certain in the recording industry and that is release dates. We can dispute on most other issues but when a recording was released, especially in the era of the emergence of country rock, 1965-1975, cannot be disputed. It signals who did what and when and we can pursue the rabbit trails from there if we so choose.\n\nThe widely accepted seminal albums signally the emergence of country rock began with the Byrds’ “Sweetheart of the Rodeo”, released on August 30, 1968. I have often heard it said that Bob Dylan’s “Nashville Skyline” was actually first but Dylan’s album was released on April 9, 1969. Dylan and the Byrds were Columbia recording artists at the time so I believe there is little dispute about who was first to release. And, in February 1969, the first off-shoot of the Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers, debuted its “Gilded Palace of Sin” album, which demonstrates two albums trumped Dylan without question.\n\nA little more than a month after Dylan’s “Nashville Skyline” was released, on May 19, 1969, Poco released “Pickin’ Up the Pieces” on Epic Records, a sister recording company of Columbia.\n\nWe will re-visit all of these a little later. Now, let’s step back to the rock groups who added country to their mix, but were by no means country rock bands.\n\nThe Beatles\n\nWhat could they not do? “Beatles For Sale” was released on December 4, 1964 in England, and might be best remembered as the USA release, “Beatles 1965”. With songs like “I’m A Loser”, “Baby’s In Black” and “Honey Don’t” (USA release), The Beatles demonstrated they were fond of the country music they heard. “What Goes On” (from UK “Rubber Soul” album released December 5, 1965), and “Act Naturally” (from UK “Help!” album release August 6, 1965) can be added to the list of the music The Beatles brought before a mainstream rock & roll audience.\n\nWhy not Elvis?\n\nCall it a local prejudice: I think of Elvis as rockabilly, at best, in his early years. Similarly, Buddy Holly had country influences but he took his music in such a way that it simply doesn’t make it into the country rock genre. This is the highly subjective part of criticism or parsing out the past, but if you want to read about rockabilly, it won’t be here.\n\nBuffalo Springfield\n\nReleased on December 5, 1966, “Buffalo Springfield” immediately showed its country bent with Stephen Stills songs “Hot Dusty Roads” and “Pay The Price”. Those would be followed by Richie Furay’s “A Child’s Claim To Fame” on “Buffalo Springfield Again”, released October 30, 1967. Then, on “Last Time Around”, released on July 30, 1968, there are three songs with distinct country flavor: “Four Days Gone” (Stills), “Carefree Country Day” (Jim Messina) and Furay’s gem “Kind Woman”.\n\nByrds\n\nWe can argue about the Byrds actually starting earlier with their country flare. There is plenty of fodder for that fire! We could pick “Old John Robertson” or even “Wasn’t Born To Follow” from “The Notorious Byrd Brothers”, released January 15, 1968, or Chris Hillman’s “Time Between” from “Younger Than Yesterday”, released February 6, 1967. But, like The Beatles, the Byrds weren’t ready to shuck rock in those albums. But you could see it was an influence. And, albums that followed “Sweetheart”, “Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde”, released March 5, 1969 (still ahead of Dylan), and “Ballad of Easy Rider”, released on November 10, 1969, both took the genre further before the dawn of the 1970s.\n\nMonkees/Michael Nesmith\n\nSurprised? You shouldn’t be if you know Michael Nesmith’s background. The November 6, 1967 release of “Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.” featured his song “What Am I Doin’ Hangin’ Round”. Also, he wrote “Different Drum” made famous by Linda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys on their “Evergreen Volume 2” album released in June 1967. Steve Aldrich offers this: “If given a chance on his own, Nesmith might have beat Gram Parsons in a race to invent country-rock. When he ceased to be “Monkee Mike,” Nesmith created rootsy country music, unaffected by the often cynical approach of numerous contemporaries.” Nesmith and his First National Band released perhaps his largest selling song, “Joanne” from their album “Magnetic South” in August, 1970. It was Nesmith’s first release after leaving the Monkees. The songs “What Am I Don’ Hangin’ Round” and “Different Drum” put Nesmith squarely in the “Buffalo Springfield Again”/”Younger Than Yesterday” timeframe that would build awareness of the genre.\n\nNow we can take a look at the musicians who did most to push the genre forward in 1968-1969.\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers\n\nIt might be enough to explain that the backgrounds of the various players in the first generation of Burritos could leave no doubt as to the creation of a purely country rock band. Gram Parsons had a vision for “Cosmic American Music” and the power of Chris Hillman, Sneaky Pete Kleinow, and Chris Ethridge (not to mention a number of drummers prior to settling on Michael Clarke) to put it to the test. “Gilded Palace of Sin” was the first album to bring original country-style lyrics into a rock beat. With the exception of “Hippie Boy” (and some people might take exception to that exception) this was a genre-creating record. Where the Byrds didn’t rely on original songs for “Sweetheart of the Rodeo” but re-created the soul of well-known country songs, the Burritos relied mostly on Parsons & Hillman along with Parsons & Ethridge to claim new musical territory.\n\nDillard & Clark\n\nWe can argue that at their leading edges the Byrds, Nesmith, Stone Poneys, Dylan, and even Neil Young were bent more toward folk rock than country rock. As we discovered, folk and anything is a beginning or bridge to something else. No one stays there (in folk) for long unless by their own volition. Doug Dillard (late of The Dillards) and Gene Clark (floating around after his departure from the Byrds), bent it a different direction: bluegrass. Nevertheless, this was a fusion of folk and rock (Clark’s background) and bluegrass (Dillard’s roots) that made this more closely resemble Gram Parson’s vision of “Cosmic American Music” he espoused during his life. “The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark” released in October 1968 and “Through The Morning, Through The Night” released in August 1969, places Doug Dillard and Gene Clark in the midst of the aforementioned “ground breaking” releases from the Byrds (August 1968), Dylan (April 1969), The Flying Burrito Brothers (February 1969) and Poco (April 1969). Dillard & Clark had its share of Burrito/Byrds influence with Chris Hillman, Bernie Leadon, Sneaky Pete Kleinow and Michael Clarke appearing on both albums\n\nWorth a mention, although it was considered a folk rock venture, is “Gene Clark and the Gosdin Brothers” which was released in February 1967. This was Gene’s first album after departing the Byrds and it, too, had a good deal of help from the aforementioned friends: Doug Dillard, Hillman, and Clarke. Notable cameos were delivered from Leon Russell, Glen Campbell and Van Dyke Parks. An early version of “Tried So Hard” is on this release as well.\n\nAfter Dillard & Clark dissolved, Dillard went back to his bluegrass roots. Clark recorded “Tried So Hard” and “Here Tonight” with the Flying Burrito Brothers. “Tried So Hard” was released without Clark’s vocals on the band’s last studio album, “The Flying Burrito Brothers”, in June 1971. “Here Tonight” wasn’t released until 1974’s Burritos compilation album “Close Up The Honky Tonks”.\n\nAlthough an argument can be made against it, Clark’s next releases “White Light” and “Roadmaster”, (August 1971 and January 1973 respectively) delved back into a more common folk rock, or straight folk ballads, where he seemed most comfortable. He didn’t return to the country rock genre until the Byrds reunion album released March 7, 1973. He contributed two strong tracks in an otherwise dismal reunion attempt: “Full Circle” and “Changing Heart”.\n\nPoco\n\nHistory has shown that much excellent music has been derived from the former members of Buffalo Springfield. Jim Messina, Stephen Stills and Neil Young have had extraordinarily successful careers spanning decades. Richie Furay found modest success, along with Jim Messina, Randy Meisner, Rusty Young and George Grantham as original members of Poco. But, if they didn’t find the commercial success of the yet to be born Eagles, they set the table, along with the Burritos, so others could take the genre they helped create and make it commercially viable.\n\nIf the Beatles were the “good boys” and the Rolling Stones the “bad boys” of British rock in the 1960s, then Poco were the Beatles to the Burritos Rolling Stones of country rock. There would be no songs like “What A Day”, “Make Me a Smile”, “Pickin’ Up The Pieces”, “Grand Junction” or “Just In Case It Happens, Yes Indeed” on “Gilded Palace of Sin”. Poco were the bright-eyed optimists to the Burritos world-weary realists. This was Furay’s influence and it proved infectious. At a time when there were war protests and young people were thumbing their noses at elders and all authority, Poco stuck to the tried-and-true country formula: relationships. And it did it with the thumping of a rock beat. Furay and Messina rose from the ashes of Buffalo Springfield to create an enthusiasm for the genre that has endured.\n\nCrosby, Still & Nash/Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nWhy so far down the list? Well, all except for Graham Nash have appeared on the list in one form or the other. Admittedly, David Crosby isn’t much of a country rock musician but a folk/protest/ballad writer and singer of considerable talent. He appeared on the Byrds reunion album with a strong delivery of Joni Mitchell’s song “For Free”. Nash, late of the Hollies, and British, was not then nor is today what one would consider a country rock musician. Nevertheless, his high harmonies drove many of the best songs produced by CSN and CSNY during the time considered in this writing.\n\nOn May 28, 1969, opening the summer of discontent that would put them front and center at Woodstock, NY in August, “Crosby, Stills and Nash” arrived to the record store bins. As with most of the arrivals from the country rock genre, not all songs had a country flavor. To that end, this album was all over the map. “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes”, “Helplessly Hoping”, “49 Bye-Byes” and “You Don’t Have To Cry” had the hallmarks of Stills’ country orientation. He had done this in songs with Buffalo Springfield.\n\nIn the meantime, on-again-off-again cohort, Neil Young was busy releasing “Neil Young” on November 12, 1968 followed by the first album with his new backing group, Crazy Horse, “Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere” on May 14, 1969. The albums only had one song each (“Emperor of Wyoming” and “Losing End”) that threw a bone to some country twang, but that’s it.\n\nEven if you waited for the March 11, 1970 release of “Deja Vu”, you’d be hard-pressed to find country influence beyond “Teach Your Children” (with Jerry Garcia’s cameo steel guitar play) and, maybe, Stills’ solo “4+20”. After that, what? Well, nothing. It was enough to bring them in as a footnote to the genre. Stephen Stills would do the most to further the genre with his April 12, 1972 release “Stephen Stills & Manassas”. More on that at another time. Let’s get back to the 1968-1969 era.\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\n\nAn odd choice? At first glance, yes. CCR came at country rock from the other side of the spectrum: R&B. John Fogerty and the band seemed to put the Cajun into rock music with soulful results. They will not be best remembered as a country rock band but they deserve more than a passing mention when the body of work is assessed.\n\nTheir first album was released on July 5, 1968 and aside from “The Working Man” and “Porterville” there’s not much country rock here. “Bayou Country”, released on January 5, 1969, brought us “Proud Mary”, of course, but, more important to this dissertation, “Bootleg”, “Graveyard Train” and “Keep On Chooglin’”, which set CCR as a player in the country rock game.\n\n“Green River”, released on August 3, 1969, contained the title track plus “Lodi”, “Bad Moon Rising” and “Cross-Tie Walker”, which put CCR well ahead of CSN or CSNY in carving a niche in the genre.\n\nOn November 2, 1969, making it three album releases in one year, “Willy And The Poor-Boys” was released. It contained country-flavored gems “Down On The Corner”, “It Came Out of the Sky”, “Cotton Fields” and “Don’t Look Now”, all of which could be recorded by country stars today without a second thought…if they or their producers ever worked up a first thought.\n\n1968-1969 release dates\n\nByrds, Sweetheart of the Rodeo, August 30, 1968\n\nDillard & Clark, The Fantastic Expedition of…, October 1968\n\nNeil Young, self-titled, November 12, 1968\n\nNashville West, self-titled, Unknown release date in 1968\n\nCCR, Bayou Country, January 5, 1969\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers, Gilded Palace of Sin, February 1969\n\nByrds, Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde, March 5, 1969\n\nBob Dylan, Nashville Skyline, April 9, 1969\n\nNeil Young & Crazy Horse, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, May 14, 1969\n\nPoco, Pickin’ Up The Pieces, May 19, 1969\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash, self-titled, May 26, 1969\n\nCCR, Green River, August 3, 1969\n\nDillard & Clark, Through The Morning…, August 1969\n\nCCR, Willy And The Poor-Boys, November 2, 1969\n\nByrds, Ballad of Easy Rider, November 10, 1969\n\nLongbranch Pennywhistle (J D Souther & Glenn Frey), 1969\n\nConclusion\n\nAt least two dozen recordings, from 1964 through 1969, built the foundation for what was then called country rock. It is this era where today’s Nashville-produced country music was born. What was unacceptable at the time, hippies mixing country music with rock music (often in the Mecca of the country industry’s establishment, Nashville) has become the institution itself.\n\nWe will visit the expansion of the genre at another time, but we can take a look at the recordings released in 1970, many of which were recorded in 1969 (at least in part), for a glimpse into the future:\n\nCSN&Y, Déjà vu, March 11, 1970\n\nThe Flying Burrito Brothers, Burrito Deluxe, April 1970\n\nPoco, self-titled, May 16, 1970\n\nThe Grateful Dead, Workingman’s Dead, June 14, 1970\n\nCCR, Cosmos Factory, July 25, 1970\n\nMichael Nesmith & The First National Band, Magnetic South, August 1970\n\nNeil Young, After The Goldrush, August 31, 1970\n\nByrds, Untitled, September 16, 1970\n\nPoco, Deliverin’, recorded live September 22-23, 1970, released January 13, 1971\n\nThe Grateful Dead, American Beauty, November 1, 1970\n\nStephen Stills, self-titled, November 16, 1970\n\nCCR, Pendulum, December 7, 1970\n\nThe list was growing with the notable inclusion of The Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia’s interest in the genre. He would contribute to the creation of New Riders of the Purple Sage, which began recording its debut album in December 1970. It would not be released until August 1971. Also, he contributed steel guitar work on CSN&Y’s “Teach Your Children” (from Déjà vu), which demonstrated his interest in expanding the genre beyond The Grateful Dead.\n\nThe expansion of the genre, whether from R&B, Cajun, Bluegrass, or even the original slacker/hippie/doper angles, would accelerate in the 1970s, affixing a rock beat to country music that both shocked and appalled industry executives even if it came as no surprise to the artists."
