I don't drink usually and not enough to know what is considered a great or a mediocre spirit beverage. I ask people who do know.\n\nSomeone who knew tasted it said the champagne was \"Excellent! Very, very good\". She spoke from an understanding of the difference between one and two \"very's\".\n\nThe band quite enjoyed it. I drank a sip in support and appreciation of the band and the gift. It was a thoughtful gift.\n\nThe idea was offered that one of the great rewards -- reciprocations -- is to be in extraordinary and fine company -- to be among lovely and beautiful things, engaged in endeavors that are satisfying and pleasing, because we provide a similar high quality of goods and services. Because we belong there.\n\nThe champagne came from someone who loved the show. The band plays exceptionally well and deserved that recognition. They are all high-value musicians and players because of the way they play: precisely, positively, and beautifully.\n\nUsually as a society and civilization we exchange money -- but the symbol of money is only in support of the quality of those things we choose to live with and for and only valuable when it is exchanged for those high pursuits. Civilization and Society.\n\nI spent the day in Warcraft yesterday with some friends in our Guilds -- Videoranch Guild for Alliance and Welach for the Horde. We battled other teams and collected artifacts and frolicked and joked and romped in the Virtual World. World of Warcraft, for those who don't know, is a game that builds a society based on team play in a mythical land of dungeons and dragons, and cities and societies.\n\nWOW is nothing at all like VR3D, a virtual world I have built, which has no game play, no cities, dungeons or dragons. No weapons, or combat, or quests.\n\nVR3D is a virtual world that exists purely to share experiences. One of the components that makes that happen is a live video feed that is embedded in the 3D world and streams different content -- from teaching, to concerts, and conversations.\n\nIt is open to the public but is not active all the time. and only works on a few computers. So it is not as robust or persistent as WOW. There is still much development that is going on in VR3D. Right now it only functions in my studio and lab. One of my WOW team mates has a video show in there on weekends for a few hours. Doontube.\n\nVR3D is still nascent but the seeds are planted and the roots are digging themselves deeper even as I write. WOW and VR3D and many of the other Massively Multiplayer Online games share the same goal. To gather people together to expand what we can share with each other. Like very, very good champagnes.\n\nBesides being at work on VR3D, playing on our Guild teams in WOW, I am also preparing for the Monkees tour that starts on the 18th with rehearsals in Nashville.\n\nAn exciting tour."
