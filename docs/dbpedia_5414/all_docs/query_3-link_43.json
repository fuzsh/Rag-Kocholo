        "text": "Sometimes a story isnât a culmination of knowledge or reporting, but rather a passageway into the subject. Being a Michael Nesmith fan since my musical adolescence of the 1970s didnât prepare me for my new obsession: the Monkees through a prism of Papa Nez.\n\nWhen I bought my first Monkees LPs in the used record emporiums of Berkeley, they were in the same batch as the Beatles, Stones, Kinks, Cream, and the Who. There was no discernible difference in a sense. They were all good.\n\nâWhat Am I Doing Hanging âRound?â from 1967âs Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones LTD turned me onto the tall, side-burned Texan on The Monkees television show, already into its second or third life in syndication by the time my best friend Steve and I chortled along. Nesmithâs ringing vocal and the songâs jangle emptied into a knockout chorus begging for listener harmonies. Only in revisiting the song for this weekâs Music feature did I discover that unlike most Nesmith vocals on Monkees records, he didnât actually write the tune. Now Iâm gonna have to pick Michael Martin Murpheyâs Geronimoâs Cadillac.\n\nMoreover, the three other Nesmith vocals on the same LP â also penned by others â were entirely new to me. âSalesmanâ opens Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones with a tangy kick, while âThe Door Into Summerâ summons CSNY. Best of all other than âWhat Am I Doing Hanging âRound?,â Nesmithâs summer of love vocal on âDonât Call On Meâ floats.\n\nâPropinquity (Iâve Just Begun to Care),â one of Nezâs post-Monkees twang standards, already sounds like a million dollars as an early demo on the 2-CD deluxe version of More of the Monkees, but the groupâs Nashville sessions around the time of Head, uncovered on Rhinoâs Listen to the Band box set, roll out one gem after another. âCarlisle Wheeling,â with its tender banjo, meets the fiddle hootenanny of âSt. Matthew,â and both belong on their own Nesmith-centric Monkees collection.\n\nListen to the Band also titles a roundup of Nesmithâs cowboy 1970s, while Rio: The Best of Michael Nesmith catches up his later catalog with an infusion of Lone Star tropicalia. Live at the Palais, a few pesos at Waterloo Records recently, dusts up another vinyl Nesmith treat easily uncovered around town. There's myriad Nesmith discs in the ether. Unlike Gram Parsons, Nesmith could â and can â sing, and his wealth of releases always yields previously unknown treasure. That most Monkees reissues boast the fat roots of such work makes one wonder what music lost when Gram Parsons left the Byrds after making only Sweetheart of the Rodeo.\n\nHereâs a Papa Nez playlist drawn from the Monkees' classic period, LPs one through six â 22 songs in 59 minutes:"
