        "text": "Back to Issue 501\n\nMichael Nesmith\n\nCan I buy that picture behind you? $8?” Michael Nesmith’s face grins at me from the laptop screen as our Skype chat commences, linking your RC correspondent in Dorset with Nez’s home in Carmel Valley, CA. It’s fair to say that this one has been a long time coming; and it’s a source of some professional pride that I managed not to blurt forth a confession that only The Monkees were capable of replacing Batman in my affections as\n\na five-year-old in late 1966. Nor did I mention that it was playing Monkees albums back-to-back which provided solace a decade or so later during my first hangover, on a rainy Sunday following a toga party the previous night that had seen me plummet rather disgracefully out of a loft, clad only in a dog blanket. I also successfully neglected to mention that, later still, I bought a cream-coloured SG Custom guitar in partial tribute to the one Nesmith played during the live Circle Sky footage in the film Head. I wouldn’t want anyone to think I was, you know, obsessed with one tiny sliver of his career: a surreally vivid three-year interlude which saw puppets somehow developing a life and a legitimacy of their own.\n\nOur conversation found Nez in a playfully expansive frame of mind, punctuating his recollections with hearty laughter. His first order of business was sparking up a spliff – “OK, now I’m heading off into legal cannabis land, it’s been legal here for some time now” – which probably wouldn’t have hindered the tangential turns our dialogue ended up taking. It almost felt discourteous to tie him down to the set questions I’d prepared, so I let happenstance take the reins. Nez’s insights were always illuminating; and it was a privilege to accompany him round the houses as he plucked memories from the ether.\n\nAt one point, as the morning sun slowly filled his room, Nez’s face became completely obscured on my screen.\n\nAll I could see were bright pinpoints of light and billowing dope smoke, as though Nez himself had deliquesced into the air, leaving behind only his disembodied voice.\n\nAs depictions of becoming one with the cosmos go, this was pretty on-the-nose, and gratifyingly appropriate.\n\nOnce it was established that this writer is of Scottish-Italian descent (“I may retire in Glasgow,” Nez mused), our talk was prefaced with a pleasingly arbitrary digression in which Nesmith explained that he was in the process of buying an Italian truffle dog. “They’re raised to hunt truffles. Ah, ‘hunt’ is the wrong word! I think the truffle is an aphrodisiac, is that right?\n\nI read that it was, which is always of interest to me…”In the sleevenotes to Cosmic Partners, you say: “At McCabe’s, the thing that distinguishes my and Red Rhodes’ dance moves is that he’s high and I’m not. During those days, I didn’t work high.”\n\nWell, I’ll tell you the story about how Red started smoking. I was over at his house, and Red was the perfect model of an American redneck. I mean, he was not a hard-right conservative politico; he was just a redneck because… he was! [laughs.] I didn’t notice any abnormal hate or condescension or anything like that, but I always stayed away from talking about things like [marijuana] around him. We’d play as a duo from time to time because we had so much fun playing with each other, we were perfectly in sync. And I’d thought about it a while, like, “How do I get this going with the other guy?”\n\nSo, he was in the middle of a solo, and he started coughing so badly that he couldn’t play. And I thought, “Wow.” I said, “Red, what is that cough? That’s debilitating.”\n\nAnd he replied, “Well, it’s not really, it’s just these goddamn cigarettes.” I said, “Stop smoking them, then! Cigarettes are deadly poison!” He said, “Aw, I can’t, it’s just too hard to quit.” Now, I’ve never smoked tobacco, so I don’t really know, but I do know that the little bit of dope I smoke is salutary: it’s a good night’s sleep, it’s…\n\na fun afternoon at the beach! [laughs].\n\nNow, I don’t play high: I would if I could! I talked to John Lennon about it once, and he said, “Ohh, I remember when we went onstage loaded. I went over to Paul and said… never again.” Anyway, Red said, “Well, I guess I could try it.” I said, “Do you have any grass around here?” He replied, “Yeah, I have about 100 plants.” [Nez laughs heartily] “A hundred plants?! Wait a minute, where are they?” He said, “Aw, I keep them in the closet.” He goes over and opens the closet, and there’s a room, the size of a bedroom, loaded floor to ceiling with these big, beautiful, fully mature marijuana plants! It was illegal at the time, so I don’t know what kind of penalty there would have been; it would have been bad.\n\nI said to Red, “That’s 100 plants, you can’t have all this around here! What do you do with them if you don’t smoke it?”\n\nHe said, “I sell it to the neighbours.” [Nez guffaws] I said, “Red, that’s dealing, you can’t do that!” He said, “I know, I keep it a secret.” I wouldn’t be telling you this now if Red hadn’t passed. Anyway, I said to him, “Take a toke, and let’s play high.” And when we did, it was just celestial. I mean, I’d never played music like that, never heard music like that… and I thought, “Man, I’ve stepped off into the coolest, best, most well-hidden lagoon on the whole planet, and here I am, happily swimming along with the neon fishes. And one of my best friends, Red, one of the greatest players I know, is with me!”\n\nCan you remember how you met Red in the first place? Was it at his Palomino Club residency in Hollywood?\n\nYes. Red was the bandleader there. It was jaw-dropping. I mean, this was a little band playing some of the best… dare I call it country music? I can’t really, because it wasn’t. It was inspired on some level that\n\nI’d never reached. But I wanted to know: I thought, “Who is that guy playing the steel guitar?” I was watching him play it; how he rolled his foot on the pedal, and so forth.\n\nSo, I introduced myself to him after the show, and it was all convivial and friendly.When Johnny Ware [drummer] suggested I start The First National Band, he said: “If you could have anybody that you want, cost no object, anywhere in the world, the only reality being that they have to be alive, who would you get?” I thought, and I thought, and I thought… and I felt, well, it would be Paul and John! [laughs] But clearly, that ain’t gonna happen. I was a crazy fan of The Beatles; the music was just astounding to me. But what I said was, “I guess Red Rhodes, the steel player over at the Pal.” Johnny said, “I’ll call him.” So, Johnny called him up, then told me:\n\n“I talked to Red: he’s on.” That was the beginning of it. Then I went over to Red’s house in the Valley: he had a pool, and a rec room, and a place where we could play. And, as you know, 100 marijuana plants in a bedroom closet!\n\nDid the rapport you achieved with Red happen quickly?\n\nIt was love at first sight. I mean, I just loved Red, and I loved the way that he thought, musically. All of what he plays on the First National Band records, and anytime he was playing with me, he was unbridled. I just said: “Go your way, and I will follow you.”\n\nSo he did, and I did. A lot of what you see is a band kind of turned around on itself, where I was following the musical mind of Red Rhodes, who was by any argument a sideman. But I hate to even say that in the context of his contribution, because…\n\nI mean, I’m biting my tongue, but The First National Band would not have existed without Red Rhodes. And when he started playing those things, it just put the music in another space.\n\nThe steel player I’m working with now,\n\na guy named Pete Finney, was hanging out at Red’s shop in Hollywood, and was part of the pedal steel scene: kind of a head himself, a smoker, a toker, and he was okay to step into Red’s shoes. And I realised, “Oh, this is as much about the instrument as it is about the player.” Pete said something to me which I still use as a joke, which is: “As long as the bar’s moving, it’s not out of tune.” [laughs] Which I think is hilarious. [Calls out] “Pete, does that sound a little pitchy\n\nto you?” [drawls in response] “As long as\n\nthe bar’s moving, Nez…” Which is his way of telling me to shut up! Pete and I go out\n\nnow sometimes as a duet, just like Red and\n\nI used to, and it’s glorious.\n\nHow did you feel about your fellow country-rock pioneers, Gram Parsons, The Byrds, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Poco? Did you feel a kinship with any of them, or did it feel more as though you were on your own distinct path?\n\nI did not feel a kinship with them. I didn’t know any of them. I had not heard Gram with the Burritos, or anything like that:\n\nI was off in a corner, all by myself, and I felt very much isolated from that. Though Roger McGuinn called me up once. He said,\n\n“I hear you play the pedal steel?” I said,\n\n“No, no, no. I don’t play pedal steel: I have\n\na pedal steel player!” But he said, “Would you come and play with us? We’re going to kind of do a rehash of Sweetheart Of The Rodeo.” I replied, “Well, I love that album, but Roger, I can’t play the pedal steel.” He said, “Aw, yeah, I’ve heard you play!” I said, “No you haven’t, I don’t know anything about it: it starts life as a card table then goes into some other place I don’t understand…” But he said, “Will you just come, and sit on the stage and play?” I said, “Well, as long as you don’t have any barriers I have to cross, or things I have to play that I can’t play… you should know, I don’t know how to play the steel!” He just said, “Right, we’ll see you up there!”\n\nSo, I went along, and sat down through the rehearsal and everything… and I think it maybe took eight minutes for the front-of-house mixer to just turn me off! [laughs]\n\nI thought, “Well, I rest my case.” And\n\nI turned to Rog and said, “I don’t know\n\nhow to play this thing!” I have an abiding respect for people who can do this, because it’s so hard to play. But to play it in the sky, like Red did, you have to understand the instrument on a spiritual basis. And I do not. I understand it as a consumer, and as\n\na writer, as an artist: I can hear those sounds and think, “Oh, man, that would be great.”\n\nBut it belongs to the player. And if the player lifts the instrument into another realm, from what I can tell, the instrument takes over. It impresses itself on whatever you’re trying to play. You hear people who say that having a steel-player in a band you’re with makes it sound like a country band, but if it’s played differently, it doesn’t. It sounds like something from, you know, the Red Bull spaceship or something.\n\nI don’t know what it is. It’s something out there that I know is there now. That’s how I distinguish country-rock from country. Country-rock comes from the stars; from some other place, rather than drinking from a jug and eating in the backyard! [laughs] Cosmic Partners is a gorgeous thing: intimate and vibey versions of great songs, immaculately recorded. I also love the fact that you didn’t fade Silver Moon, but left in the sound of the tape abruptly running out: it just gives the album this very direct sense of being a little window onto a moment in time, and that window has just been suddenly closed…\n\nYeah! It’s great that you noticed that.\n\nI did it as a thing that I picked up from John [Lennon], that I’d just got from visiting him when they were doing Sgt Pepper’s. It’s a nice thing, because I love the way the sudden silence just rearranges the room. You’re sitting there, happy, sappy, drifting along, and suddenly… “Wow, what was that?” Well, that’s the music stopping!\n\nThere’s a great thing you say in the sleevenotes to Cosmic Partners with reference to Red’s under-the-influence playing, that it goes “off into places that you don’t think up musically, but you can think up cosmically.” I’ve always heard in your compositions and chord progressions a propensity to veer off in unusual directions. Is that a conscious thing? Is it just the way you’re wired, or do you avoid cliché when you’re writing?\n\nWell, it’s more the latter than the former: I’m not wired that way that I know of, but I have studied certain instruments and the sounds they make, the confluence of those sounds, and so forth, and it has given me\n\na platform to work with in doing the music.\n\nNow, I was listening to one of our albums a few days ago: I can’t think which one it is, but Red played a solo on one of the songs, and it’s like the whole room… You see filmmakers try to replicate the psychedelic experience, so they go… [makes warping motion] Everything turns upside down, something like that. Well, this is what actually started to happen! [laughs] And it makes you laugh, because it’s like a ride at the fair, there’s never a sense of falling or anything like that.\n\nThere are very few people who play at this level. I guess a master was Hendrix, and then John and Paul would write at this level: I don’t mean to act like I know these guys intimately because I don’t, but I think they would write at this level. You’d get extraordinary things from Paul, and John was always in this space, which was a space that he and I shared…\n\nSo it became worthy of study. It became worthy of saying, See what you can learn about this so that you can communicate with these guys that are actually doing it.\n\nI don’t think I’ve been successful at that: I think I’ve been happy at it, and I’ve been giving it a try, and I still will, I’ll continue to do it. I’m curious about how important the presence of cannabis is, because I really don’t know! I can’t really tell when it’s fallen off the psychedelic pony; when it’s just not there anymore, when it’s just slipped back into some Luddite sense of the music.\n\nBut I know when it’s on the pony! You’ve nominated Bo Diddley as a formative influence, picking up on the otherworldly quality of his music;\n\nand that otherworldliness seems to be a characteristic close to your heart.\n\nBo came into my life at about the same time music did. So they were welded, joined together, at the hip: that makes it sound freakish, but like twins. In all music from then onwards, somewhere, depending on\n\nmy state of mind, I’ll begin to hear the slow pulse, or fast pulse, of Bo Diddley. [Gently sings Bo Diddley “shave and a haircut, two bits” rhythm.] And nine times out of 10, it’s there: from U2 to No 2, everybody\n\nplays it, and we kind of don’t know that we are. I’m not sure that Bo was sitting down and thinking, “I know what I’m gonna do, I’m gonna revolutionise the way music is conceived.”\n\nI knew I couldn’t do it, but I wanted to, and still do. I really wish I could have the influence… and I’m not sure where that comes from, it sounds kind of egotistical when I say it… but I wish I could have\n\nan effect on music. I haven’t, as you know!\n\nBut I think it’s somewhere there, buried down in the bowels of music. I’ve just finished a book; it’s the third album of a trilogy I’ve just completed called The Ocean, and it starts with Bo’s beat, and that’s absorbed in that music as it goes on. That to me is worthy of everybody knowing where it came from. I know that the people who do know where it came from play better than the people who don’t. At a microcosmic level, they just play better.\n\nIt’s like, the reason Keith Richards’ guitar sounds better than any other Keith Richards-style guitar in the world is because he knows how to play it. It sounds so obvious. It’s like Lord Buckley – are you hip to Lord Buckley?\n\nYes, indeed.\n\nHe said, “Well, sometimes, when you get to it, and you can’t do it… then, there you jolly well are!” [Bursts out laughing] And the people who can do it, can use it creatively. Whatever you want, you can have. And that is not empowerment, because you don’t have any control over it, you realise that? The Great Controller is controlling it! And so you yield to that, you give in to it, and if you do that as a musician, certain music comes out. For John and Paul, thankfully that music came out. And, you know, I can listen to it in wonder, and just say to myself: “This is celestial. This is coming from the stars.”\n\nHow does that compare to the influence of, say, Johnny Cash, on your music?\n\nI list him as inspirational, but he was not foundational. Those other guys I just mentioned were foundational. If you don’t mind us going right back, was Paul Butterfield’s version of Mary Mary the first relatively high-profile cover version of one of your songs?\n\n[Laughs] It wasn’t exactly high-profile!\n\nRelatively!\n\nJac Holzman told me, when we were on a boat trip – he was running Elektra at the time – he said he kept getting phone calls from total strangers, who would say: “My name is so-and-so, and you don’t know me, but do you know that Mike Nesmith of The Monkees is taking credit for Mary Mary?\n\nI just thought you ought to know that, ’cos we all know those guys are crooked.” Click.\n\nAnd I said, “Jesus, Jac, that’s horrible, I’m so sorry.” He said, “Well, no, I just thought I’d tell you. It doesn’t bother me, of course.” And there it is, out there floating around. It was connected, ephemerally and ineffably, with The Monkees, because the Reverend Frazier Mohawk, who gave me the [Monkees audition] ad that appeared in Variety, was also the courier of Mary Mary to Butterfield. And the publisher was Randy Sparks [New Christy Minstrels founder].\n\nDo you remember anything about your Monkees audition?\n\nWell, I knew something was up. That kind of a production overhead doesn’t go unnoticed: 7th and Gower was the intersection of major streets in downtown Hollywood – that’s where the studio was.\n\nIt was not trivial at all for us. And there were other clues around that something was about to happen. But I couldn’t see at the time that the backlash from it would be so virulent and mean-spirited. Look, you know, The Monkees were simple, and they were for kids: it was coming on to life’s first light and love’s first kiss. It’s good to have somebody around explaining that! And music is great for it, you know: “Turn the page when you hear the chime.” You know those books?\n\nCan you remember your first impressions of your fellow Monkees? Did you all click as personalities quite quickly, or was it something you felt you had to work at?\n\nYeah, the latter. I don’t know how to describe what happened with me and the other three guys. It’s just that they did not like me at first sight. What a difference between that and love at first sight! David and Peter began an immediate plot to try to get rid of me, and I started acting like Donald Trump: how do I get rid of them? [laughs]. There was very little love lost, so\n\nI retreated. The friendship was pretty well non-existent: you know, we were not a band. We were a group of guys who showed up and got a part as members of a band. It took a lot of adjusting, and the guy who seemed to be able to adjust, and do it, was Mick. And he couldn’t play! [laughs] But he had his sense of rhythm, and he had a good poppy voice, maybe a little pitchy at times, but who cares… and he was out of the Hollywood child movie star mould. He’d been in front of the camera a few times. So, I started just watching him, you know, what’s he doing? How does this thing work? What’s going on here? And to the degree that I was able to suppress my own pride and ego – which was not very much! – I was able to learn that this show was not a show starring a band about\n\na band. This was literature, if you’ll give me that word: or at least, it was about the narrative, not about who the personalities were, and what their talent was, linked to a far more inspirational source. It wasn’t about that; it was about a television show.\n\nThe Monkees’ peak popularity coincided with the so-called Summer Of Love.\n\nWere you influenced by the attitudes and culture of that era?\n\nOh, yeah, very much so. It was a tsunami: this was something that was wiping out, wholesale, the edifices of my thought. What it didn’t do was bring in a set of battery-powered drills, saws and hammers, and rebuild. I was out there, swimming around in the ponds, and the ponds slip into other ponds through tributaries, and the next thing you know you’re in a little lagoon.\n\nIt’s all due to the ever-present gravity that’s taking you down the slopes of the sphere. It starts to dawn on you, your head opens up, and you realise, “I’m in the middle of, what is this, a galaxy?” That’s right. “And the galaxy is in the middle of something?” Yes, it is. “What is it?” Well, the Milky Way. “Wow!” And this goes on and never stops. And nine times out of 10, when these things get popular, the people who get popular with it think they invented it: and then they think, “Oh, well, I know everything about it: what else is it that you want to know?” [laughs] And it’s absurd, they don’t know anything about it. They’re just up there wearing the clothes, and singing the songs, and doing the dance, pretending to be it. When I was in The Monkees, I had been asked to pretend I was a member of a band. “But wait a minute, I…” And it was like, “Sit down, Nez: shut up. You just had a nice thing offered to you from the universe. Just take a bite.” And I did. At that point I thought, “Ohh, this is about pretending to be a band. You don’t have to play all those licks that these first-call session cats have been playing on these records: you just have to stand up there and bang on it like the folk guitarist you are.”\n\nQuite testing, though, in a performance situation…\n\nMicky would say, “I can’t hear the time,” and I’d say, “Mick, you are the time!” He’d reply, “I don’t know where the time is,” so I’d say, “Well, watch the heel of my boot.” Because we couldn’t hear each other at all. I’d strike my boot and he’d hit the snare drum, and that was the great rhythm section of The Monkees. It was as simple and chaotic as Ringo’s was elegant and complex.\n\nThe thing that always amazes me is the “palace revolution” that occurred within The Monkees, which resulted in Headquarters becoming a legitimate “band” album. How much was this to do with a perception from the music community and media that your records lacked credibility?\n\nWell, that was ever-present. It was like an ugly friend that ate too much and was a kleptomaniac, but you had to take him with you everywhere you went! Just this… opprobrium that followed you everywhere. There wasn’t anything you were going to do, or say, or be, that wasn’t going to be ridiculed. Somebody, maybe one of the goofballs at Rolling Stone, named Mike of The Monkees “the smart Monkee,”\n\nand I almost copyrighted that one for my own stationery, because I thought it was so insightful! Mike of The Monkees was one of the great know-nothings of the world, and for him to be the smart Monkee… [laughs].\n\nOn the recording of the McCabe’s Guitar Shop gig, you tell a couple of great stories about out-of-control adulation from fans. Was the idolatry you received from screaming fans a thrill, or did it quickly become intrusive and/or scary?\n\nIt was scary from the first, from the downbeat. I don’t care if you had three people running at you or 300; it’s still the sound of thundering hooves, or jet fighters, and it puts your heart right in your throat. And in this case, you’re having this direct experience and you know that these people are, number one, alive, and number two, people who have an agenda: and that agenda consists of getting stuff from and off you! It doesn’t make any difference whether God put it there, or it grew there by DNA, it’s coming off: and if it’s your little finger, say goodbye. That can’t make you any more frightened than it made me: I think we both share the same sense of fear. It just made me immediately turn and run in blind panic.\n\nThe only person I ever talked to about it was John [Lennon], and he said that it never really turned into much of a problem except when he was onstage. How can you play if you can’t hear? And it’s true. If you want to listen to music and know what it’s like to stand in front of the adulation of 20,000 14-year-old girls all screaming at the top of their voice in a closed arena, then turn up your stereo to white noise, about 146dB – that’s gunshot level – and then try to talk to somebody. You can’t hear yourself think, let alone hear anything they’re saying: it’s maddening. And when you realise it’s a big part of the control surface, you’re screwed.\n\nHead is one of the defining psychedelic artefacts: were you and the other Monkees completely on board with director Bob Rafelson and co-screenwriter Jack Nicholson’s evident determination to blow apart The Monkees’ image?\n\nI was down for it, and so were the other guys. By that time, we were regular tokers, exchanging the dialogue of rocksters and media-sters, and parties into the dawn, so it was an easy jump to make. It was weird the way it was written: we all just got together, five or six of us, and wrote it by just telling each other a bunch of jokes. That was fine with me, that’s what Bob and Jack wanted to do, so we thought, “Let’s do that.” They were like goofy jokes that you’d tell in a welding shop when you’re building a car.\n\nWould it be fair to suggest that it was your experience of TV and film setups with The Monkees that planted the seed for what would later become projects such as PopClips and Television Parts?\n\nWell, what you’ve done there is conflate two things, and they’re in the wrong order. The first was Elephant Parts, and [the ideas for] that came long before the goofball stuff with The Monkees, when I was watching television as a six-year-old in the 50s. So, when I came into The Monkees I thought, “Oh, I know this territory.” The only other guy who caught any ball or item that I threw towards him was Mick, and he would catch them sometimes: truly funny. So, I thought, “I can riff with this guy, this is fun.”\n\nI guess it was when we went to Japan [3-4 October 1968 – Ed] that Mick and I really bonded, sitting on a catwalk at the Budokan in Japan. I don’t know what we were doing there, we might have been playing there as far as I can remember.\n\nI had just taken a massive hit of this massive spliff, and I looked over at Mick and said something like… I did not say this, I’m having to make this up… But I said something like, “Boy, it’s really high up here, what would happen if you fell down, I wonder if you could survive a fall like that, do you see these stunt guys who are like jumping off Mount Everest and they just\n\nfall and fall, and, wow, just get up and dust themselves off? Whatever, do those guys build to make that happen…?” And Micky turns to me very slowly and goes… [Softly and disinterestedly] “Rap, rap, rap, rap…”\n\nI lost it: I just started laughing so hard because he had completely encapsulated the moment. So I knew that because he could do that and I could do that, that we could do that together: and that’s why he and I, as far as I know, danced through The Monkees.\n\nSpeaking of Mr Dolenz, on the dates you’ve been doing with him, how does it feel to be performing those songs again?\n\nIs there a significant emotional subtext – or text! – to the endeavour? Those songs matter a lot to people, they’re generational markers…\n\nI take the point of your question. Mick and I made kind of an early decision back before the show was starting, but certainly when we started to go out on tour, which was that we had to recognise where the songs we were playing fit into the lives of the people who came to see us. And that we, unlike most rock’n’roll bands, were not attracting peers. Not attracting people who loved us because of who we are or because of the way we played, or because of the way we thought and dressed and because of our sense of style: none of that was in play with us.\n\nWe were surrounded by professionals who were creating that, and we had an audience of people who expected it; but we couldn’t do it. So, what do we do, do we stand there like marionettes or sock puppets? Well, what we do is we work on authenticity. I was never able to spread this too much further than my own idiot winds, but that’s what I thought it was, and Mick seemed to agree with that. That as long as the goofiness and the fun was delivered with the same innocence and easy-going style that we tried to do on The Monkees, it would play as real, as authentic. And it did, and here we are!\n\nDid you assume, back in the day, that The Monkees would just be an ephemeral, here-today-gone-tomorrow phenomenon? Did you have any inkling that the records would prove to have such longevity?\n\nI guess the most concise answer is that I did not have a clue of the way The Monkees were going and would go. Frankly, I still don’t. There’s very little in the current exposure of a TV show to hint at what the next step might be. I’m pretty sure that Micky and I don’t know it, but maybe somebody else will and we can light the fire under it.\n\nAny new projects in the pipeline?\n\nI’m working with Pete Finney, as I explained, and I want to see how high I can take this stuff. You know, I don’t want to die by my own hands or somebody else’s, but then I don’t want to die at all, so one way to not do that is to find the lift of life and, as the gliders say, once you’ve found it, pick it up.\n\nFinally, can you nominate any outstanding moments or achievements from your life to date? It’s been quite the ride…\n\n[Long pause] I mean, I look back at my life, and the things that have happened, and they’ve been astounding. I don’t really have a metric for saying it was more important when John Lennon called me back than it was when I threw out the first pitch at the Yankees game: I never threw out the first pitch at the Yankees game! [laughs] I think, when I step back far enough – which, just to give you a sense of it, is farther than the sun – I can get a picture or a feeling sometimes which is enhanced if I’m high on smoke and degraded terribly if I’m high on alcohol, so I don’t drink anymore… but in some altered states of mind, there are things to be seen that you can’t see if you’re not altered. And that’s very appealing to me,\n\nit’s beguiling, in a way: not like the sirens, but beguiling in the way of the beautiful woman in the lagoon, who I have already met and married and call her my muse…\n\nso you leave her alone!\n\nCosmic Partners by Michael Nesmith with Red Rhodes is on 7a Records.\n\nReviewed by Oregano Rathbone\n\nBack to Issue 501"
