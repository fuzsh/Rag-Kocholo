        "text": "On the Road Again: The Monkees, after Davy\n\nForty-five years after the end of their TV series, the three surviving members of The Monkees — Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork — are headed back out on the road. A Midsummer's Night With The Monkees, a 25-city tour, begins July 15 in Port Chester, N.Y. \"Last November, we had such a successful tour and such great reviews,\" says Dolenz, 68. \"And it was so great playing with Mike again.\" Those fall shows marked the first time Nesmith, 70, had toured with the group in 15 years.\n\nDaydream nation: The November tour also paid tribute to frontman Davy Jones, who died Feb. 29, 2012, of a heart attack at age 66. The shows featured a singalong on Jones' signature hit, Daydream Believer, with Dolenz telling audiences, \"We can't sing it, because it doesn't belong to us. It belongs to you now.\" Expect that moment to be part of the summer tour as well. \"What we do with I Wanna Be Free is we run the video, with him singing it,\" says Tork, 71. \"It was only an album cut, but it's an iconic cut for us, so we have Davy doing it, throwing sticks with the kids on the beach, looking young and fit in his boxer swim trunks.\"\n\nFrom the small screen to the big stage: When the members of The Monkees made their debut live performance in Hawaii in 1966, they went from having Los Angeles' finest session musicians playing on such records as Last Train to Clarksville and I'm a Believer to being a four-piece garage band playing the tunes. \"The closest thing that has come along as a paradigm is Glee, where it's a TV show about an imaginary glee club, but they can actually all do it,\" Dolenz says. For Tork, \"it was a little weird being the cover band for our own records,\" but since each band member had musical training, they made do. \"When it came to Clarksville, Michael could play the whole lick, no problem. He had to work on it, but he got it,\" Tork says. \"For I'm a Believer, I got out the organ. Once we had the record and knew what we had to do, we rocked it.\"\n\nHaze-y days: Live recordings from 1967 show the band starting (I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone with the opening guitar riff from Jimi Hendrix's Purple Haze, a combination that, in light of more than 45 years of history, seems both very funny and perfectly fitting. Hendrix's song would have been brand-new that summer. \"We had these big Vox amps, and there was a great big transistor fuzz tone, one of the better solid-state fuzz tones I've ever heard,\" Tork recalls. \"So, sure, let it rip. And then do Steppin' Stone.\"\n\nNo Experience necessary: Hendrix actually opened a few 1967 dates for The Monkees, at the suggestion of Dolenz, who had seen the guitarist with bluesman John Hammond in New York and at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. The opening sets didn't sit well with young Monkees fans, so the bill was short-lived. \"I remember once at the Whisky (a Go Go), Jim Morrison and The Doors were booed off the stage because they were opening for Johnny Rivers,\" Dolenz says. \"The same thing happened with us and Jimi.\" Hendrix's opening slot may have become pop-culture legend, but he wasn't the group's only well-known support act. Other, more successful openers included the 5th Dimension and Ike and Tina Turner, says Dolenz. \"But to go early to the show, and to listen to Jimi play, that was fabulous,\" Tork says.\n\nMonkee-ing around: Having come to popularity on television, The Monkees' comedic style — a little bit Marx Brothers, a little Benny Hill — was as important to their appeal as the music. Striking the proper balance between music and comedy during the concerts is key. \"We can't do routines with musical interludes,\" Tork says. \"We have to do songs with a few jokes attached, if we can.\" In addition to the hits, Dolenz, Nesmith and Tork play a mini-set of tunes from 1967's Headquarters album, the first to which the group's members made substantial musical contributions beyond singing. \"Then there's a lot of video,\" Dolenz says. \"A lot of stuff from the show, a lot of outtakes. The very early screen tests, from before we were cast. And then bits from the show that, over the years, have become classics. Which, at the time, we probably just improvised.\""
