        "text": "(Originally published in 2015.)\n\nEvery now and then something really amazing happens ‚Äì people with different perspectives on life will get beyond biases, prejudices, and stereotypes and have a real conversation with each other! I love when that happens‚Ä¶\n\nHere are excerpts from a recent conversation about Christian Science on an Amazon Discussion Forum:\n\nMustaaaaard says:\n\nYeah. Christian Science. The people who let their children die because they don‚Äôt believe in Tylenol. Eff off.\n\nKaren says:\n\nI was raised by a CS mom (now 87) and a non-religious dad (will be 97 in a month), and I could not have asked for better parents. My parents maybe didn‚Äôt share the same religious beliefs, but they shared the same values and taught their children to take care of the environment, to appreciate the beauty of nature, to look for the good in people, to play fair, to not be quick to judge others, to not buy into every piece of hearsay, rumor, and gossip that comes our way, but to do our own research, and question our own beliefs and biases, and recognize the biases of others, too. I‚Äôm really grateful they are still in my life.\n\nThe Weasel asks:\n\nKaren, can the core beliefs of CS be boiled down to a few bullet points? Can you try to list them as far as you understand them to be please?\n\nKaren says:\n\nHi Weasel, It‚Äôs probably important to note that I am not an official spokesperson for the CS church or anything ‚Äì and I do not speak for any other CSists ‚Äì just for myself. CSists come in all shapes and sizes and colors and political parties and most professions (I even knew a CSist who was a dentist üôÇ ). There‚Äôs no one in our church leadership telling us how to vote or who to vote for or where to stand on social-political issues ‚Äì that is left up to individual conscience. Some CSists are religious. Some are not. I am not. In my mind I make a distinction between the religion of Christian Science, and Christian Science as a way of living, and a way of looking at the world.\n\nIt might actually be easier to start with what CSists don‚Äôt believe:\n\n‚Äì CSists don‚Äôt believe in an anthropomorphic god\n\n‚Äì CSists don‚Äôt believe the world was literally created in a week\n\n‚Äì CSists don‚Äôt believe in literal places of hell and heaven\n\n‚Äì CSists don‚Äôt believe in pleading, cajoling, and begging a capricious supernatural god who might choose to heal, or might choose to not heal his children\n\n‚Äì CSists don‚Äôt believe in Original Sin, or that God‚Äôs children are sinners.\n\nWhat CSists believe:\n\n‚Äì Mary Baker Eddy, the discover of CS, offers these synonyms for God: Principle, Mind, Soul, Spirit, Life, Truth, and Love.\n\n‚Äì CSists believe that Jesus‚Äô mission here was to show us how to heal. In the CS textbook, Eddy writes: ‚ÄúAtonement is the exemplification of man‚Äôs unity with God, whereby man reflects divine Truth, Life, and Love. Jesus of Nazareth taught and demonstrated man‚Äôs oneness with the Father, and for this we owe him endless homage. His mission was both individual and collective. He did life‚Äôs work aright not only in justice to himself, but in mercy to mortals,- to show them how to do theirs, but not to do it for them nor to relieve them of a single responsibility.‚Äù\n\nWhat *I* have experienced: ‚Äì I have found that when I‚Äôm able to draw my thoughts close to Love ‚Äì to fill my thoughts up with joy, hope, and love (and eliminate fear, hate, and anger) ‚Äì I experience healing in my life. I don‚Äôt have to plead with Love to heal me ‚Äì it‚Äôs the nature of Love to heal. I don‚Äôt consider these healings ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù ‚Äì I consider them natural. I apologize. I realize this was kind of long. I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to explain an entire way of life in a pithy post. Hope this helps you understand how at least ONE Christian Scientist looks at the world. And thanks for asking! üôÇ\n\nKaren\n\nLifelong Atheist says:\n\nThere is no evidence whatsoever that prayer works at all (and no, ‚ÄúI prayed and God healed my little girl‚Äù is not evidence). There is plenty of evidence that medical care works, preventable errors notwithstanding. I can personally testify to that. Christian Science parents who deliberately withhold medical care from their children in favor of prayer are potential murderers. If their child then dies, they‚Äôre actual murderers. That‚Äôs the bottom line for me.\n\nKaren says:\n\nLifelong, I suppose there may be CSists who view medical science as The Enemy. I am not one of them. My brother-in-law is an anesthesiologist, my sister-in-law is an emergency room nurse, a niece is a medical doctor, a nephew just graduated from med school ‚Äì and these are all people I love and respect very much ‚Äì they are not my enemies ‚Äì they work very hard to do what they can to help their patients. But they are also all people of integrity and honesty ‚Äì and I don‚Äôt doubt that they‚Äôd be the first to tell you that medical science is not perfect ‚Äì theories about cause and cure are constantly in flux; medications that help one person might kill another; what seems like ‚Äúgood medical practice‚Äù today might prove to be the source of woe tomorrow. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôve all had friends and family members for whom the medical treatment that was supposed to cure them actually ended up killing them ‚Äì I know I have. And I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôve all seen those commercials on television that tell us about the side effects of drugs that might include liver problems, depression, vulnerability to infections, diarrhea, nausea, death, etc. ‚Äì I‚Äôm always wondering who is running out to get those medications, you know? I think a healthy skepticism in regards to medical science ‚Äì as well as Christian Science, faith healing, religious beliefs, mass media, and political propoganda ‚Äì is a good thing. Blind and unquestioning trust in any form of treatment does not seem very healthy to me.\n\nHave you ever read Norman Cousins‚Äôs Anatomy of an Illness As Perceived by the Patient? I would highly recommend it. Here‚Äôs my review for it:\n\nIn the beginning of the book, Cousins tells us about the illness from which he was told by medical specialists he wouldn‚Äôt be able to recover. He briefly describes how he declined to accept this medical verdict for himself, and with the support of his personal physician, set about putting into action a plan of treatment for himself which included plying himself with high doses of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and humor (Candid Camera episodes, and Marx Brothers movies).Cousins was able to recover from his illness and later wrote a story about his treatment and recovery for the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe remainder of the book shares communication from doctors and medical research that supports Cousins‚Äôs belief that medical care is both a science and an art ‚Äì and that positive human emotions play a big part in recovery from an illness. Cousins talks about the importance of a healthy doctor-patient partnership when treating disease, the part creativity and a ‚Äúrobust will to live‚Äù plays in longevity, and the power found in placebos. Cousins writes: ‚ÄúIt is doubtful whether the placebo ‚Äì or any drug, for that matter ‚Äì would get very far without a patient‚Äôs robust will to live‚Ä¶ The placebo is only a tangible object made essential in an age that feels uncomfortable with intangibles‚Ä¶ The placebo, then, is an emissary between the will to live and the body. But the emissary is expendable.‚Äù\n\nCousins talks about the need so many seem to have to see their doctor DOing something, and giving them something tangible to help them. But Cousins suggests there may come a time when these ‚Äútangibles‚Äù are no longer needed.\n\nNear the end of the book, Cousins asks the question: ‚ÄúIs there a conflict at times between the treatment of disease and the treatment of human beings?‚Äù What a great question! If a doctor treats his patient as just a lump of flesh to be prodded, injected, weighed, measured, and tested then, I think, a really important part of the healing process is missing. The best doctors, to my way of thinking, are the ones who are able to listen to their patients, reassure them, provide confidence in their healing, and value them as partners in the process. In my life I have encountered several practitioners with these fine qualities. After reading Cousins‚Äôs book, and the letters he included from doctors around the country, I am encouraged to believe that there is a growing number of medical physicians ready and willing to treat human beings, rather than just disease.\n\nArt asks:\n\n‚ÄúIt might actually be easier to start with what CSists don‚Äôt believe: ‚Äì CSists don‚Äôt believe in an anthropomorphic god ‚Äì CSists don‚Äôt believe in pleading, cajoling, and begging a capricious supernatural god who might choose to heal, or might choose to not heal his children‚Äù OK, final question for now Karen: I always thought that Christian Scientists WERE praying and pleading with a capricious supernatural god to heal illnesses rather than take a family member to a doctor. If not, what is the exact nature of the prayer involved?\n\nKaren replies:\n\nArt, you ask: ‚ÄúI always thought that Christian Scientists WERE praying and pleading with a capricious supernatural god to heal illnesses rather than take a family member to a doctor. If not, what is the exact nature of the prayer involved?‚Äù\n\nThank you for asking this question. Christian Scientists have been lumped in with ‚Äúfaith healers‚Äù a couple times on this thread. Faith healers would not appreciate this ‚Äì I‚Äôm pretty sure they consider CS a cult and its members ‚Äúun-Christian‚Äù ‚Äì and CSists don‚Äôt consider themselves faith healers. You wouldn‚Äôt hear a CSist ever saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs God‚Äôs will‚Äù that someone died, or ‚ÄúGod wanted that child with Him in heaven.‚Äù CSists don‚Äôt do the talking in tongues thing, or the laying on of hands thing, or the handling serpents thing. CSists may be crazy, but they are a totally different kind of crazy. üôÇ\n\nMary Baker Eddy‚Äôs written a whole chapter on ‚ÄúPrayer‚Äù in the CS textbook, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures. Here are some thoughts about prayer from that chapter:\n\n‚ÄúGod is not moved by the breath of praise to do more than He has already done, nor can the infinite do less than bestow all good, since He is unchanging wisdom and Love‚Ä¶ Prayer cannot change the Science of being, but it tends to bring us into harmony with it‚Ä¶ The mere habit of pleading with the divine Mind, as one pleads with a human being, perpetuates the belief in God as humanly circumscribed,- an error which impedes spiritual growth.\n\n‚ÄúGod is Love. Can we ask Him to be more? God is intelligence. Can we inform the infinite Mind of anything He does not already comprehend? Do we expect to change perfection? Shall we plead for more at the open fount, which is pouring forth more than we accept?‚Ä¶ Are we really grateful for the good already received? ‚Ä¶The habitual struggle to be always good is unceasing prayer‚Ä¶\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòGod is Love.‚Äô More than this we cannot ask, higher we cannot look, farther we cannot go‚Ä¶ In divine Science, where prayers are mental, all may avail themselves of God as ‚Äòa very present help in trouble.‚Äô Love is impartial and universal in its adaptation and bestowals.‚Äù\n\nWhat prayer feels like, for me, is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like waking up to a beautiful sunrise in the morning or listening to an inspiring piece of music, or looking at the stars on a clear night ‚Äì it‚Äôs a feeling of uplift ‚Äì of thoughts soaring, of fear dissipating, of a consciousness full of joy and good will. Often times my prayers come with humor ‚Äì laughing always seems to help get rid of fear for me ‚Äì and for me, fear is always a part of whatever problem I‚Äôm facing. And Love is always a part of the healing. I‚Äôve sometimes known I was healed before I saw the healing manifested humanly ‚Äì I could feel the change in my thoughts.\n\nArt asks:\n\nPersonal question Karen: you don‚Äôt believe as your parents do but you still self-identify as a Christian Scientist?\n\nKaren responds:\n\nMy dad is non-religious. My mom is‚Ä¶ she is simply wonderful. My mom wasn‚Äôt raised in CS ‚Äì she found Christian Science not long before she married my dad ‚Äì she was attracted to this way of life because she liked the idea of a God who is Love ‚Äì a Love that heals. She never had any kind of official position in the church or anything ‚Äì like me, she is not really a very religious person. She is an independent thinker and a free spirit ‚Äì not into group-think.\n\nI identify as a Christian Scientist because I really like the ideas and thoughts found in the CS textbook ‚Äì I believe in God as Love, and I‚Äôve experienced healing through my understanding of Love.\n\nArt responds:\n\n‚ÄúI identify as a Christian Scientist because I really like the ideas and thoughts found in the CS textbook ‚Äì I believe in God as Love, and I‚Äôve experienced healing through my understanding of Love.‚Äù Thanks for the insight Karen. Anyways, like many here I‚Äôve always had a negative opinion of Christian Scientists so I appreciate an intelligent perspective from somebody like yourself.\n\nKaren replies:\n\nArt, You write: ‚ÄúAnyways, like many here I‚Äôve always had a negative opinion of Christian Scientists so I appreciate an intelligent perspective from somebody like yourself.‚Äù Thank you.\n\nAnd thank you for asking questions with a genuine interest in learning what I had to say. That felt really good. üôÇ\n\nBuck ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù Buckaw says:\n\nMichael Nesmith is a devout CS (as I‚Äôve mentioned to you on a previous occasion) but you wouldn‚Äôt know it by listening to his music. It didn‚Äôt come to my notice until I read a biography about him.\n\nKaren responds:\n\nBuck ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù Buckaw ‚Äì I do remember our talking about Michael Nesmith ‚Äì and I remember enjoying that conversation very much. üôÇ\n\nAnother one of my favorite people ‚Äì an atheist, not a Christian Scientist ‚Äì had this to say about Michael Nesmith: ‚ÄúSo then, a few years ago, I was introduced to someone who became a great friend of mine, Michael Nesmith, who has done a number of different things in his career: In addition to being a film producer, he was originally one of the Monkees. Which is kind of odd when you get to know him, because he‚Äôs such a serious, thoughtful, quiet chap, but with quiet reserves of impish glee‚Ä¶ I just hope that there will be other projects in the future that he and I will work on together, because I like him enormously and we got on very well together.‚Äù ‚Äì Douglas Adams (Adams died not long after that and I don‚Äôt think he was able to work with Nesmith again ‚Äì but it really meant something to me that Adams saw those qualities in Nesmith, a CSist.)\n\nAnd no, you will not hear a CSist knocking at your door. üôÇ Frankly, it took me a long time before I felt comfortable ‚Äúadmitting‚Äù I was a CSist or talking about my way of life in an open and honest way. I know there is a lot of‚Ä¶ not sure what the word is‚Ä¶ misinformation? bias? prejudice?‚Ä¶ about CS, and I‚Äôm not always eager to enter discussions about CS‚Ä¶ sometimes ‚Äì if I sense that nobody is really interested in having their minds relieved of their prejudices ‚Äì I choose not to enter those discussions at all. But it felt to me like there were people on this thread who were genuine and sincere in their questions about CS. It is good to hear your voice again, my friend. Karen\n\nBuck ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù Buckaw says:\n\nThank you so much for your kind words, I always enjoy our exchanges immensely and recall them with fondness. Regardless of what belief system you might adhere to, you are a shining light. Keep on shining brightly.\n\nKaren says:\n\nOh, Buck ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù Buckaw ‚Äì thank you. You don‚Äôt know what your kind words mean to me tonight. Thank you. I am so glad to know you are in the world.\n\nBuck ‚ÄúBuck‚Äù Buckaw says:\n\nOK, that‚Äôs enough of the mutual admiration society. We risk turning the whole thing into some sort of giant hug fest and that just won‚Äôt do, particularly for the more jaundiced participants of this thrill ride. Now, what were we talking about? Oh yeah‚Ä¶..Christian Scientists hey? What a kooky bunch."
