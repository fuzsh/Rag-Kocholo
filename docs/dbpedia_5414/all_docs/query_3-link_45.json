        "text": "Nesmith was effectively cast as the group’s Lennon, cerebral and witty. He was also the most accomplished musician and songwriter in the make-believe group, who asserted his own creativity by persuading the band to record his original material. The early Monkees hits were composed by some of the best American songwriters of the era and played by musicians of the calibre of the legendary Wrecking Crew, with the actors just taking vocal parts.\n\nNeil Diamond gave them I’m A Believer, Gerry Goffin & Carole King wrote Pleasant Valley Sunday, while the hit making team of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart wrote their theme song and Last Train to Clarksville, which Nesmith sang. But as time went on, Nesmith brought in The Girl I Knew Somewhere, Mary, Mary and Listen to the Band, rich and colourful songs that married their beat group drive with Nesmith’s country and folk leanings.\n\nAlthough initially cast as actor-musicians, the group started playing live concerts and introducing more of their own songs. “Mike was the one who spearheaded the palace revolt,” according to drummer and vocalist Mickey Dolenz. “He was a talented singer-songwriter and he was very frustrated.”\n\nWhen I spoke to Nesmith in 2016, he didn’t quite remember it the same way. An erudite and philosophical man, he felt the Monkees' growing self-sufficiency and accomplishment was a natural progression. “I wasn't rebelling against the winter palace or feeling that we had to fight under the oppressive boots of some despots. We had been hired to play and sing and write, so I just thought let’s embrace it. Music was our foundation, so let’s make the effort. And I had some luck with it, with great songs and great productions, and whether it was somebody else playing guitar or me playing guitar, it didn’t matter. The whole thing was valid and authentic and genuine either way.”\n\nCritics of the time didn’t feel the same. The Monkees were attacked for being fake, criticised for not playing on their own hits then mocked when they did. “That was confusing to me,” Nesmith admitted. “There was an attempt by a certain class of thinking in the critical community to see this as an aberration, a monstrous idea that must be exterminated. To me it was anything but. It was the work of talented people, actors, producers and craftsmen. There was no officiating myth maker who had some magic Satanic plan to enslave the youth of the world. It was a nice work environment. It was fun.”\n\nEmbattled and confused by becoming the object of such critical opprobrium, The Monkees made a madcap self-satirizing movie, Head, and imploded in a psychedelic haze, their last television performance in 1969 degenerating into a frenetic 10-minute improvised hippy jazz rock wig out of Nesmith’s Listen to the Band. Whilst the other members floundered to different degrees, Nesmith went on to an artistically creative and credible career both solo and as founder of seminal country rock group The First National Band, who had a hit with Joanne in 1970.\n\nEven before the Monkees, Nesmith had composed Different Drum, a bluegrass song that has become something of a country standard, recorded by PP Arnold, Carrie Underwood, The Jayhawks, Lemonheads and a hit for Linda Rondstadt in 1967 with her group Stone Poneys. Nesmith played 12-string-guitar and crafted thoughtful, quirky, slightly left of field songs.\n\nIt is worth seeking out his stark and lovely 1972 solo album, misleadingly titled And The Hits Just Keep on Comin’. Nesmith’s musical career was fitful, but he also started a small record label, Countryside, wrote several novels, was a pioneer in the American home video market with his company Pacific Arts Corporation, produced pop videos (including Lionel Richie’s All Night Long), created award winning 1981 comedy show Elephant Parts and was executive producer of the cult 1984 movie Repo Man.\n\nNesmith’s mother, Bettie Nesmith-Graham, was a former secretary who made a fortune by inventing typewriter correction fluid (essentially Tippex, although her original version was known as Liquid Paper). When she died in 1980, Nesmith (her only son) inherited half his mother’s estate, of over $50 million (the other half going to charity).\n\nBeing independently wealthy and a successful businessman and producer in his own right did not stop Nesmith occasionally participating in Monkees reunions. “When I’ve gone off and pursued my own artistic muse, sometimes that’s been interpreted as being indifferent or uncomfortable with the Monkees mantle, but I’m not,” he told me in 2016. “It’s been part of my life for a long time and it’s always been a pleasant thing. Playing concerts with the Monkees evokes an easy-going happy time, for us and the audience. The crowds, and the joy show the value that the Monkees brought to so many people, us included.”\n\nThere is only one Monkee still swinging now, the great Mickey Dolenz (76). Heart-throb English singer Davey Jones died aged 65 in 2012, and bassist Peter Tork died aged 77 in 2019. Nesmith and Dolenz had recently toured together as The Monkees Present: The Mike and Mickey Show. “I’m heartbroken,” Dolenz said on Twitter. “I’ve lost a dear friend and partner. I’m so grateful that we could spend the last couple of months together doing what we loved best – singing, laughing, and doing shtick. I’ll miss it all so much. Especially the shtick. Rest in peace, Nez.”\n\nThe Monkees belonged to a certain moment in time but they have so many perfectly formed hits and they created such fantastically amusing TV shows, their avatars will play on in pop culture for some time to come. I leave you with something that Nesmith said to me, talking about how their TV show gave them a kind of eternal appeal that has kept renewing their audience, bringing in younger fans with every passing year as kids discover its madcap joy for themselves.\n\n“It was fun in the Sixties and its fun now. It just persists,” he explained. “We’re not like some old rock and roll band that has to get together and tour every 18 months in order to keep the fire alive. This fire burns all the time.”"
