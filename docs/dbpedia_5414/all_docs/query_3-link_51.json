        "text": "Rio\n\nWhen presenting Michael Nesmithâ€™s Rio as the first music video, the foremost idea up for debate is the definition of a music video. Chris Blackwell from Island Records asked Nez to make a \"clip\" to promote his new record in Europe.\n\nNez had no idea what a clip was -- and rather than understand it as a low-budget recording of an artist miming their song on a stage, he recalled Hollywood musicals, Beatles and Disney films, and even The Monkees romps. While editing, director Bill Dear and Nez discovered that music can take over the narrative to create continuity even when placed over discontinuous images.\n\nThat continuity is what makes a music video as Nez defines it in Infinite Tuesday: An Autobiographical Riff. Today there is little distinction between performance videos and music videos -- any video footage set to a single and released by an artist is called a music video. But in 1977, there was a clear difference and the artform in Rio was unique because of this found continuity.\n\nNez created the \"video record\" with his wife at the time, Kathryn, and director Bill Dear in 1977. This band, as he calls the trio in Infinite Tuesday: An Autobiographical Riff, went on to create the longform Elephant Parts, which featured Rio, and won the first Grammy ever given for a music video.\n\nNez writes more about the emergence of the music video in Infinite Tuesday: An Autobiographical Riff. Signed copies are available from Videoranch.com http://www.videoranch3d.com/category/...\n\nThis is a strong playlist! Very nice. I modified it very slightly to add two Nez favorites that were missing (and noted a few track source corrections, I think?) for a 14 track album clocking in at 39 minutes.\n\nAlso, I substituted the alternate, more \"country\" mix of \"Listen to the Band\".\n\nListen to the Band (Alternate Version) (The Monkees Present)\n\nGood Clean Fun (The Monkees Present)\n\nNine Times Blue (Missing Links)\n\nLittle Red Rider (Missing Links, Vol. 3)\n\nWhile I Cry (Instant Replay)\n\nHow Insensitive (Missing Links, Vol. 3)\n\nDon't Wait for Me (Instant Replay)\n\n-\n\nHollywood (Missing Links, Vol. 3)\n\nSome of Shelly's Blues (Missing Links, Vol. 2)\n\nPropinquity (Missing Links, Vol. 3)\n\nSt. Matthew (Missing Links, Vol. 2)\n\nCarlisle Wheeling (Missing Links)\n\nThe Crippled Lion (Missing Links, Vol. 2)\n\nAngel Band (Missing Links, Vol. 3)\n\nMany are posting in the thread regarding Nez passing. This is the Michael Nesmith Appreciation Thread so it belongs here.\n\nThank You Nez for the following:\n\nAs a nearly 7 year old I sat and watched the Monkees. My sister, 18 months older had the LP's and two songs from the first LP stood out for me even back then. Then and there I became a Nezhead. 5 LP's with great tunes but we moved to a more rural area, it was 1968, we might has well be off the end of the earth. I played those 5 records all the time. Mid 70's, I see a commercial for Laurel House LP with songs I had not heard. But with songs I remembered vaguely from the show and these, I knew there was more Monkees out there. Bought the Laurel House, Listen to the Band, Good Clean Fun more great Nez music. Another couple years and when I could drive I was still in search of what else the Monkees may have done. Go into a Record and Tape Traders and not only were there other Monkees records but Nesmith records as well! Started purchasing, the trilogy first, And the Hits, etc. Then Radio Engine, the Prison, Live at the Palais. For years and years would go to sleep with one of those LP's playing on my turntable. Music info was still hard to come by especially for someone like Nez, not generally on the radio. Saw a review of Infinite Rider comparing that release to the Bowie release of the same period. After that one night sitting in my car with my girlfriend and my friend comes out screaming Nez is on TV - a music video and Nez had one. Went to 1986 concerts hoping Nez would show up as a surprises but it wasn't until 1991/2 Nez came to a little club. About 3 hours away but my Monkee/Nez cohort and I bought tickets and went. Reading through Goldmine buying rarity tapes - How Can You Kiss Me and dozens more on cassette!! Tropical Campfires, Justus, Rays! Got to see Nez in 2012 and the Mike and Micky Show with my wife. Just yesterday I laid down for a nap and put on side 2 of The Prison, today the sad news as my favorite entertainer has passed. RIP you will be missed and will always be appreciated!\n\nWhile the sadness continues to permeate of losing one of the most interesting and vital persons from my younger days, and acknowledging just how talented, focused, difficult and visionary he was, I am somewhat comforted by all of the heartfelt memorials posted by fellow professional musicians, some of whom I had no idea would even have thought of him in the glowing terms that they have recently made public. It's not worth your time for me to enumerate just how many tribute comments have come to light, but it is well-worth it for y'all to go have a look (if you haven't already).\n\nAnd, due solely to the above post, I have just acquired a copy of the above mentioned Papa Nez tribute disc. It is on playback RIGHT NOW and I highly recommend it. Even if, like me, I have a vast collection of The Monkees group and solo output efforts, I will add this one gladly as a great representation of his work.\n\nIt's pretty darn decent, I must say.\n\nIt is a pretty good tribute album.\n\nAlways wondered why they put a picture of Waylon Jennings on the cover though."
