        "text": "Robert Michael Nesmith was an American musician, songwriter, actor, producer, and novelist. He is best-known as the lead guitarist for the 1960s group the Monkees. He was born in Houston, Texas, on December 30, 1942, the only child of Warren Audrey Nesmith and Bette Claire McMurray (later known as Bette Graham, inventor of the corrective fluid known as Liquid Paper). In 1946 his parents divorced and soon after he moved with his mother to Dallas to be closer to his mother’s family. Nesmith, who went by the name Michael, received his first musical influence from church hymns. In Dallas he attended Thomas Jefferson High School where that influence was reinforced through music, choir, and drama classes; he played Andrew Carnes in a school production of Oklahoma. In a 2019 interview with Australian Musician magazine, Nesmith stated that seeing Bo Diddley play guitar made a profound difference in how he viewed music. His initial goal was to try to match Diddley’s pattern and rhythm.\n\nNesmith did not graduate from high school; instead, he enlisted in the U. S. Air Force in 1960. He completed his basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio before transferring to Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls to train as an aircraft mechanic. He was stationed at Clinton-Sherman Air Force Base in Burn Flats, Oklahoma. During that time he earned his G.E.D. and in 1962 received an honorable discharge.\n\nNesmith enrolled in San Antonio College in San Antonio. He brought along a guitar that was a gift from his mother and, under the pseudonym Michael Blessing, began writing and singing folk music with friend John Kuehne. In 1963 Nesmith released his first single, “Wanderin’,” but with little success. While in college he met Phyllis Ann Barbour, a fellow student, and the two married in San Antonio on June 27, 1964. They had three children—Christian, Jonathan, and Jessica—but later divorced. A 1968 affair with Israeli-born socialite and photographer Nurit Wilde resulted in Nesmith’s fourth child, a son named Jason.\n\nSoon after marrying, Nesmith, his new bride, and musical partner John Kuehne (who performed under the moniker John London) moved to Los Angeles to seek their fortunes. Nesmith sometimes performed his songs and was a host for open mic nights at the famed Troubadour club in Los Angeles. He also wrote songs, one of which was “Different Drum.” In September 1965 Nesmith saw a Hollywood trade paper advertisement looking for “4 insane boys” for a new television show. He responded and got an audition. He arrived on a motorcycle and carrying a guitar, harmonica, and a bag of dirty laundry he claimed he would wash afterward. Tall and thin, Nesmith was engaging, nonchalant, and funny. The producers were impressed and offered him one of the four spots. One detail, however, required attention and would become a key element of his television character—a green wool hat. Riding his motorcycle, he used the cap to keep his long hair out of his eyes. Producers suggested calling his character “Wool Hat,” but Nesmith vehemently refused and after some debate agreed his character would be called Mike as long as he kept the wool hat. It would not be the last time that Nesmith rebelled against producer constraints.\n\nThe Monkees television show debuted on September 12, 1966, in the prime time slot of 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time on NBC. Along with Nesmith (often dubbed the “quiet Monkee” or “cerebral Monkee”) the group consisted of Davy Jones (vocals), Mickey Dolenz (drums and vocals), and Peter Tork (bass). The situation comedy revolved around the crazy antics of a rock-and-roll band as they tried to make it big. Their first album, The Monkees, debuted on October 8, 1966, on Colgems Records and shot to Number 1 for thirteen weeks on Billboard’s Top 200 chart. Unknown to the public at the time, the Monkees themselves only sang vocals. Session musicians played the instruments, and leading industry songwriters wrote most of the songs. Nesmith wrote and produced two songs: “Papa Gene’s Blues” and “Sweet Young Thing” (co-written with Gerry Goffin and Carol King). With their overnight success, the Monkees went through marathon rehearsal sessions before embarking on a tour in late 1966. Critics later often described Nesmith as the “only ‘real’ musician in the group”—a characterization that he disputed.\n\nTheir second album, More of the Monkees, was released in early 1967 and went to Number 1 on Billboard for eighteen weeks. Nesmith wrote and produced “Mary, Mary” and co-wrote (with Roger Atkins) and produced “The Kind of Girl I Could Love.” Due to legendary record producer Don Kirshner’s strict rule, the group again was limited to vocals. Nesmith grew concerned with the group’s limited role in creating and performing their own music. “The music had nothing to do with us,” he was infamously quoted in the January 28, 1967, issue of the Saturday Evening Post. “It was totally dishonest.” He strongly advocated that the band have creative control over their music and write and perform their own songs rather than have material provided by industry writers and session musicians. He had approached producers with his song “Different Drum,” for example, but they declined. He later offered the song to Linda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys who had a hit with it in late 1967 when the tune hit Number 13 on Billboard. Over time, he convinced the Monkees to take more control, and in February 1967 they met with Kirshner and expressed their frustration, particularly Nesmith. Eventually, Nesmith got his way, and Kirshner was fired. The band won the right to choose their own musical direction.\n\nIn June 1967 the group released Headquarters—their third album and their first release since taking control of their music. It reached Number 1 on the Billboard 200 and went double platinum. That summer their television show won Emmys for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy. The group followed up in fall 1967 with the release of Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd., which sold more than two million copies and became their fourth album to reach Number 1 on Billboard. But their fifth album, The Birds, the Bees & the Monkees, released in 1968, peaked at Number 3. The band’s popularity declined, and less than a year after winning their Emmys, the show was cancelled, airing its last episode on March 25, 1968. Their satirical, musical movie, Head, was released later that year but was a commercial failure. Nesmith released his first solo album, The Wichita Train Whistle Sings, in 1968. The album was recorded during a two-day session and included a full orchestra; it reached 144 on the Billboard album chart.\n\nBy 1969 Nesmith was frustrated and tired of the group. Though he had contributed the majority of original Monkees compositions, he had higher musical aspirations. Despite the fact that it would ruin him financially, he bought out the remainder of his contract in 1970 and formed the First National Band, consisting of John Ware (drums), John Kuehne (John London, bass), and O. J. “Red” Rhodes (pedal steel guitar). The band produced three albums: Magnetic South (1970), which included the heartfelt country ballad “Joanne” that reached Number 21; Loose Salute (1970); and Nevada Fighter (1971). Though these albums did not rise in the charts, musicologists in retrospect have acknowledged their fusion of genres, and Nesmith has been credited with helping to lay the foundation for country rock, soon personified by such groups as the Eagles.\n\nIn 1972 Nesmith founded the Second National Band consisting of Nesmith, Rhodes, Michael Cohen (keyboards), Jack Ranelli (drummer), Johnny Meeks (bass), and Jose Feliciano (congas), and they released the album Tantamount to Treason: Volume 1. That same year Nesmith released And the Hits Just Keep on Coming, an album of ten tracks, all which were written during his time with the Monkees. One track was Nesmith’s own version of “Different Drum.” He sang lead vocals and played guitar along with longtime collaborator “Red” Rhodes.\n\nPretty Much Your Standard Ranch Trash, his last album with RCA Records, came out in 1973. Nesmith became interested in producing, and his connection with Jac Holtzman, founder of Elektra Records, led to Nesmith being put in charge of Countryside Records, a division of Elektra. The label focused on artists overlooked by the mainstream music industry such as Garland Farley, “Red” Rhodes, and Steve Fromholz. However, when David Geffen replaced Holtzman, he did not see enough profitability in Countryside and shut it down.\n\nNesmith founded Pacific Arts Productions, Inc. (later known as Pacific Arts Corporation), in 1974 and released his concept album, The Prison: A Book with a Soundtrack, packaged with a companion short story. In 1975 his song “I’ve Never Loved Anyone More,” co-written with country songwriter Linda Hargrove, was sung by Lynn Anderson and reached Number 14 on the country music charts. Nesmith married Kathryn Bild on February 29, 1976; they divorced in 1988.\n\nNesmith’s single, “Rio,” from his 1976 album From a Radio Engine to the Photon Wing found success overseas, and its promotion included a video that was aired in Australia. This marriage of imagery and music inspired Nesmith to expand on the idea, and, with financial backing from Norman Lear, in 1979 he produced a pilot series—PopClips—consisting of six half-hour shows that included music clips introduced by “veejays” (video jockeys). PopClips represented the concept of a twenty-four-hour music television channel, and Nesmith eventually took the project to John Lack, the CEO of Warner Amex Satellite Entertainment Company. Lack was impressed with the concept and tested it on the Nickelodeon channel. It was so successful that he purchased PopClips from Nesmith in 1980, and, after crafting it to suit the Top 40, Lack went on to create MTV.\n\nAfter the death of his mother in 1980, Nesmith inherited her fortune of $48 million and took over the foundations that she had established: the Gihon Foundation, which promoted women in the arts, and the Bette Clair McMurray Foundation, which promoted women in business. He used his inheritance to produce Elephant Parts (1981), a program that featured comedy sketches and music videos. The show earned him the first Grammy Award for Video of the Year, his only award out of six nominations.\n\nNesmith did not claim to be the inventor of MTV, but he did acknowledge credit as one of the “architects” of the concept. He continued his work with music videos and also began to produce films. In 1982 he was executive producer of the science fiction Western Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swan. He served as executive producer for the dark comedy film Repo Man (1984) and produced Tapeheads (1988). His short-lived thirty-minute variety show Michael Nesmith in Television Parts aired on NBC in summer 1985, and its format was similar to Elephant Parts, with comedy sketches and music videos. The show featured up-and-coming comedians such as Garry Shandling and Whoopi Goldberg. Nesmith also produced music videos for other artists, including Lionel Richie’s “All Night Long” (1983) and Michael Jackson’s “The Way You Make Me Feel” (1987). Through his Pacific Arts Corporation, he acquired a sizable catalog of programs for the growing home video market throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s. This included a distribution contract with PBS—an arrangement that later ended in several years of back-and-forth litigation between the two parties over rights and royalties. Ultimately, Nesmith won the lawsuit and a large settlement in 1999 and by that time was already operating a new multimedia enterprise called VideoRanch.\n\nFellow Monkee Peter Tork reached out to Nesmith to see if he would join them for the group’s twentieth anniversary tour in 1986. Though interested, Nesmith cited contractual obligations and declined. He did agree, however, to perform at any Los Angeles concerts. On September 7, 1986, he appeared for an encore with the group at the Greek Theatre. In 1989 the four reunited and performed at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. The following day on July 10, 1989, they attended the unveiling of the group’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nNesmith embarked on a North American tour to promote the release of his RCA solo albums on CD in 1992. He subsequently released Live at the Britt Festival from his performance on that tour at the Britt Festival in Jacksonville, Oregon. He once again reunited with the Monkees to record an album titled Justus which was released in 1996 in conjunction with their thirtieth anniversary. Nesmith also wrote and directed a one-hour ABC special, Hey, Hey…It’s the Monkees, that aired on February 17, 1997. To promote Justus, they embarked on a tour of the United Kingdom; it was the last time all four would play together.\n\nNesmith published his first novel, The Long Sandy Hair of Neftoon Zamora, in 1998. His second novel, The American Gene, was released in 2009. He married Victoria Kennedy in 2000, but they divorced in 2011.\n\nNesmith continued to periodically release albums and perform at concerts into the twenty-first century. He released Rays in 2005 and the live album Movies of the Mind in 2014. He also returned to television and guest starred in an episode of the comedy Portlandia. Between 2012 and 2014 Nesmith and the remaining Monkees (Davy Jones died in February 2012) played concerts across the U. S. In 2016 he joined Mickey Dolenz and Peter Tork to record the Monkees fiftieth anniversary album, Good Times, which was generally well-received. A tour followed, but Nesmith did not appear with the group for a majority of the dates. On two occasions, he filled in for Peter Tork, who was fighting cancer. The three performed at the final show of the tour—it was the last time all three would appear together.\n\nIn 2017 Nesmith wrote his autobiography, Infinite Tuesday: An Autobiographical Riff, which the New York Times called “beautifully written.” In 2018 Nesmith performed on a short tour with a new version of the First National Band, and he toured with fellow Monkee Mickey Dolenz on The Monkees Present: The Mike and Micky Show tour. The last four dates of the tour were indefinitely postponed due to Nesmith’s poor health. He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and underwent quadruple bypass heart surgery. Christmas Party, the final studio album released by the Monkees, came out in fall 2018. Peter Tork died in February 2019.\n\nNesmith toured with steel guitarist Pete Finney in 2019 and was later joined by guitarists Ben Gibbard and Scott McCaughey. In the same year, Nesmith and Dolenz reunited to perform the dates that were cancelled by Nesmith’s surgery, and they planned one more tour at the beginning of 2020 and the release of The Monkees—The Mike & Micky Show Live, an album recorded live in 2019 and featuring a number of Nesmith compositions. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was delayed. In May 2021 both announced the group’s final tour—The Monkees Farewell Tour. The American tour would include approximately forty dates between September and November. The final Monkees performance was held at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles on November 14, 2021. On December 10, 2021, Michael Nesmith passed away from heart failure at his home in Carmel Valley, California. He was seventy-eight years old."
