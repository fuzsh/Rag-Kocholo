        "text": "__Philanthropist Michael Nesmith (yeah, the ex-Monkee) brings five big brains to his New Mexico ranch every two years to solve the world's most pressing problems. And then not tell anyone about it. __\n\nOn a high-desert morning soon to be hot as hell, Michael Nesmith - former Monkee, current philanthropist, and perpetual man-with-a-mission - enters a cool room just big enough to comfortably hold five brains. Not the organs, of course, but five live, gifted thinkers, ranging from professor Nikki Giovanni, one of the few famous living poets with street cred, to Nobel Prize winner Murray Gell-Mann, the father of quarks.\n\nNesmith's sandals shuffle quietly as he takes his place at the head of a conference table. His thinning silvery hair is mussed; his golf shirt needs tucking in. No matter. He is here this bright morning to give a pep talk, and the brains listen closely, for good reason. Nesmith, once known as the \"smart Monkee,\" will soon turn 58, putting him a full 32 years away from his TV days of knit caps and sideburns. Today, he is a serious grown-up, an intellectual ringmaster who has given these thinkers $5,000 apiece, put them up in a snazzy hotel in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and paid their way to his 7-acre outpost in Nambe, 20 miles to the north. In these parts, Nesmith is the head wrangler, the foreman of the frontal lobe. And it's his intention that the brains will cogitate for the good of humankind - spending 12 hours in hot debate until they find the answer to a single, nigh-impossible question: What is the most important issue of our time?\n\nThe name of this biennial exercise, which Nesmith invented and has hosted since 1990, is the Council on Ideas. It's an oddball gathering of intellectuals otherwise about as likely to run in the same circles as Jesse Ventura and Margaret Thatcher. Here, they are nudged into artificial convergence - a kind of in vitro fertilization whose outcome, if all goes brilliantly, will be a strong, viable idea that, as Nesmith puts it, \"changes everything.\"\n\nThis year, Giovanni and Gell-Mann are joined by Bosnian Serb war crimes investigator M. Cherif Bassiouni, inveterate advocate of an international criminal court; anthropologist Anna Roosevelt, great-granddaughter of Teddy and a MacArthur grant recipient for her work on Amazonian Indians and the tropics; and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Stanley Karnow, Vietnam War correspondent and foreign affairs curmudgeon, who was added at the last minute because novelist Carlos Fuentes took ill.\n\n__The Council's goal: one \"extraordinary moment\" of insight. Unlike bedrock pragmatists, Nez says the value of the idea itself will make ripples. __\n\nOnce the council begins, only the five brains will be allowed in this room. I, however, will experience the next best thing. After much wheedling, Nesmith set aside his inherent distaste for reporters and agreed to let a select few hear snippets of council musings through headphones outside the room. And when the retreat ends, I alone will watch the meetings on videotape - the most extensive press access ever granted.\n\nHerein lies the weirdness, at least for people who believe that an idea without hype is like a bee without buzz. The Council on Ideas seeks the world's most hot-button issue, but uses no infomercials, billboards, blimps, or any other forms of advertising to announce the results. The nonprofit that oversees the council - the Gihon Foundation - posts bios of council wonks and full texts of their \"position statements\" on its Web site (www.gihon.com). Period. The only other nod to the information age is a meager press conference tacked on at the council's end, mostly because Nesmith - Nez, to his friends - thought the brains would focus better if they knew public scrutiny loomed. Beyond that, Nez prefers the cocklebur method of IT: Have host, will travel.\n\nHe's heard the snickers. What's the point of identifying the most important issue of our time if you don't let anyone know about it? Why pay attention to a man known mostly for his dry wit and facial hair?\n\nThe news media, it's true, sticks to Nesmith's Monkee-ness like gum on a go-go boot. Never mind that Nez helped invent MTV and country rock, that he published a novel and pioneered a home-video distribution business, and that he cut 13 post-Monkees albums and produced cult film classics like Repo Man. And never mind that Nesmith - who could choose to be as ostentatious and narcissistic as the next gazillionaire rock star - instead carries on the philanthropic traditions of his mother, Bette Graham, the inventor of Liquid Paper typing-correction fluid.\n\nNope. Except for the mom bit, reporters don't care about Nesmith's real accomplishments. Give the press entrée, and what do they ask? Whether Nesmith still talks to ex-simians Davy Jones, Peter Tork, and Micky Dolenz. And who needs another pun headline? \"Nesmith's Not Monkee-ing Around.\" \"Hey! Hey! Ex-Monkee Is Also a Novelist.\"\n\nHey, hey. The brains are waiting.\n\n\"I have no idea whether you can do this,\" Nesmith tells them flatly. He warns that they'll bicker and possibly even brawl. Two brains in the 1990 council argued so bitterly about Fidel Castro, he says, that the entire group walked out. He encourages them to start with easy ideas (\"It may be something as simple as 'be kind to animals' or 'ripe fruit is best'\") and work up to the hard stuff.\n\n\"This idea - that five people of your caliber and your degree of thought would agree on something - is significant,\" he says, inspiring the brains to be all they can be. \"What is important,\" he concludes, \"is that you try.\"\n\nThe road to Nambe, population 1,246, cuts through Pojoaque Pueblo, past a turnoff for the Los Alamos National Laboratory and a casino where Chubby Checker is playing. A few miles down a twisting dirt road off the highway, Casa Nez sits against a backdrop of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. I arrive on Friday morning, well ahead of the council's evening kickoff reception, to get a jump on the brains.\n\nI crunch down a gravel drive through a raised electronic gate and park near the one-story Gihon Foundation headquarters, out of which emerges a smiling woman in shorts and a T-shirt. She's Victoria Kennedy, Nesmith's main squeeze. They met 13 years ago, when Kennedy was a 19-year-old model and Nez was a 45-year-old recovered pop icon with two dissolved marriages. Kennedy is Nesmith's archivist and extremely low-key publicist; she also runs Videoranch.com (www.videoranch.com), a cyber cowboy world with a 3-D component that lets guests mosey into a \"ranchscape,\"listen to music, and watch comedy clips on floating TVs. Originally set up to sell out-of-print Nez albums, Videoranch now offers Nez videos and collectibles and a Gene Autry-meets-Desiderata ambience, complete with the kind of musings usually heard when there's a bong nearby. (\"Are you a butterfly dreaming you're a person, or a person dreaming you're a butterfly?\") Nez also uses the site to sell a few more copies of his 1998 novel, The Long Sandy Hair of Neftoon Zamora.\n\nKennedy gives me a quick tour. Here, she points, is the house: a modest adobe with a hammock out front and, except for an industrial-size cappuccino maker, few luxuries inside. There's a pool: a no-frills suburban rectangular model. There's also a studio filled with guitars, computer equipment, and the Monkees' shiny platinum records.\n\nDown a slope sits the guest house, where Douglas Adams, author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Nesmith's good friend, is staying for the weekend. Turning to her left, Kennedy points to the old steel trailer in which Nesmith's mother whipped up batches of Liquid Paper. Kennedy calls it an informal museum, but it's really more of a family shrine, complete with the rusty mixer Graham used when inventing the goo, along with photographs telling her story.\n\nIn the early '50s, as the tale goes, Graham was a divorced single mom in Dallas struggling to raise young Michael on a paltry bank secretary's salary. A commercial artist in her spare time, Graham wondered why she couldn't just use white paint to hide all the typos she made at the bank. She experimented with tempera and various formulas until - ka-boom - \"Mistake Out\" was born. She first mixed the recipe in the kitchen, helped by teenage Mike, and later expanded to a trailer in the backyard. In 1968 (by then Nez was already a superstar Monkee), Graham opened an 11,000-square-foot Dallas production facility and renamed her product Liquid Paper. She later used the profits to start the Gihon Foundation, named after an Old Testament river. In 1979, the year before she died, Graham sold her business to Gillette for $47.5 million.\n\n__Nez inherited a lot more from his mother than fortune. Like her, he is a Christian Scientist, an artist, and an inventor with chutzpah. __\n\nNesmith inherited a lot more from his mother than fortune and foundation. Like her, he is a devout Christian Scientist, an artist, and an inventor with entrepreneurial chutzpah. Like his munificent mother, Nez made it big without the benefits of early privilege or even a high school diploma (he says he dropped out). And like his mother, he seriously craves the serious.\n\nBut their passions differed. Graham's foundation gave grants to support women artists and entrepreneurs. Nesmith thought grant-giving didn't do enough. When Betty Friedan addressed the foundation in the '80s, he'd seen how even one big thinker could set neurons afire. A council of thinkers, he figured, might stumble upon what the world is short on these days: the truth.\n\nThe council's headquarters is a refurbished barn in Nesmith's compound that also houses the Gihon Foundation and a gallery for Graham's art collection (works by Georgia O'Keeffe, Helen Frankenthaler, Grandma Moses, and others). Adjacent to the gallery is the big-windowed thinkers' room. And in a windowless space nearby, Marcia Summers - Gihon's part-time director and the only staffer - tackles the details of conferencedom. Guest lists. Portapotties. Name tags.\n\nThe toughest part of Summers' job - recruiting the brains - takes a year to accomplish. Gihon members, council alumni, and community leaders in designated cities compile a list of as many as 100 nominees, who vary in race, gender, culture, discipline, and nationality. The list is whittled down through a series of votes, with final approval coming from the Gihon trustees: Nesmith, Kennedy, Mary Anne Henneberger (Graham's former secretary), and Patricia Hill (Graham's former attorney).\n\nReasoned though the process sounds, you have to wonder: Does a bigthink exercise like this really get you anywhere? Kennedy plants me in the thinking room, and I search for an answer in the \"position statements\" disgorged by past councils: \"A world civilization is emerging\" (1992); \"The enemy is bureaucracy rather than bureaucrats\" ('94); \"Humankind is still in grade school\" ('96); \"We are living in a time of change unprecedented in both extent and rapidity on a planet now so filled by our presence that little further space exists to accommodate serious mistakes\" ('98).\n\n\"Nez will be with you shortly,\" Kennedy tells me. Maybe he can translate.\n\nNez wants to talk on the patio overlooking a patch of lawn that seems much too lush for the high desert. The grass thrives courtesy of a neighboring farmer who lets Nesmith's groundskeeper draw sprinkling water from a nearby irrigation canal. It doesn't take a MacArthur grant to wonder why Nez's global concerns don't extend to water conservation, but that's probably dissecting too much. For now, Nesmith sits in a green chair, clean-shaven and Buddha-bellied, red-framed eyeglasses propped above his forehead. Kennedy joins us with the couple's panting German shorthairs, Roy and Lily.\n\nFirst, the rules. No small talk, and I can't sit in the council room. (Nobody from the outside can, not even Nesmith.) On Monday, I can view every minute as recorded on the four video cameras and a DAT machine. And I can use The Chair: a white wooden chair positioned outside the council room, where people can sit and listen to the sounds of snapping synapses. In fact, Nez tells me, someone must sit in The Chair at all times so he or she can hear if a brain needs anything: a pencil, research materials, more Pepsi in the mini fridge. Shifts are limited to 20 minutes.\n\nThe Chair raises its own set of questions: Why enslave people to a butt-numbing seat rotation over a day and a half? What's wrong with an intercom, or with letting the brains stick their heads out and holler? But Nesmith is 100 paces ahead of me already, talking about the five thinkers and the need to protect them from distractions. Because there's a possibility that they'll go ... far.\n\n\"They might even come up with something that is so insightful, it changes everything. It would be an extraordinary moment,\" he says, as if he's seeing film clips in his head. \"Imagine if the five of them stood up there and said, 'This is the most important issue of our time' - and they were absolutely right! And we all sat there and looked and said, 'My gosh, that's it! We as a people have to get busy and think about this!'\n\n\"That moment is probably not going to happen at the opera. It's probably not going to happen at Macworld or at the Supreme Court,\" he says. When he pauses, I hear the crunch-crunch of either Roy or Lily ecstatically gnawing a chew toy. \"This,\" Nesmith says - crunch - \"is the forum it will happen in.\"\n\nBut doesn't someone need to put the idea into action?\n\n__Alumni at the precouncil party include Pulitzer-winning writers and bioinformatics researchers. A network has been created. __\n\nNesmith manages to refrain from rolling his eyes. There's one class of thinker, he explains, who believes an idea has little value \"unless you take it and actually go do something - build a building, make a car, invade Poland.\" He, on the other hand, believes ideas are useful on a spiritual basis, that the idea itself has value.\n\n\"Once it has occurred, once it has come forward into thought and is acknowledged,\" he says, \"it's there for all of us to use.\"\n\nWouldn't press coverage at least help spread the good news?\n\nNope. The media manipulate and subvert, Nez says. And there's no great need for advertising, either. As is, every council has managed to be \"waaaay ahead of the curve,\" as he put it to me in an email before I came to Nambe. He suggested I check the council statements against subsequent world events and see for myself.\n\nI tried. I failed. The council statements are so broad and world events so infinite that I could find no logical way to trace cause and effect. The 1990 council, for example, imploded over Castro and never wrote its statement, and then ... the Gulf War broke out the next winter? (Nez says the meltdown foreshadowed something else: disputes over multiculturalism.) The 1992 council burbled with optimism about a dawning new age \"sustained by a transnational myth structure,\" and ... Bill Clinton's campaign theme song was \"Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow)\"? The '94 brains saw the need to reform government - a generic idea if there ever was one. Equally platitudinal, though admirably proverbial, were the '96ers, who called lack of learning the top problem, stating: \"We are not what we know, but what we are willing to learn.\" And finally, the '98ers foresaw danger in helter-skelter techno advancements. \"The greater the pace of change, and the less the margin for error, the more important becomes the experience of history,\" they concluded.\n\nBingo. That statement, Nesmith says, was two years ahead of the essay by Sun chief scientist Bill Joy, who warned that technology untempered by humanity could spell doom. (See \"Why the Future Doesn't Need Us,\" Wired 8.04, page 238.) \"The idea stated - that's all that has to happen,\" Nez says. Toss a thought into the human pond, and even though it sinks like a stone, it makes ripples that reach the shore.\n\nBut first, cocktails. The 2000 council participants and various alumni - Nez flies in any veterans who wish to attend - gather in Santa Fe on Friday night for a precouncil party, the calm before the brainstorm. And what better place than the Inn of the Anasazi, with its sandstone walls, four-poster beds, and toilet paper made of cedar pulp?\n\nNesmith rents out the two private back rooms that make up the Inn's library. Scattered about in various stages of chatter are Mexican physicist Ana Maria Cetto, known for work in theoretical physics (council of '98); Todd Siler, MIT-bred artist/author/management guru ('96); and cultural anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, daughter of Margaret Mead ('96). There's also law professor and former Washington Post writer Garrett Epps ('94). And from '92, Dallas Morning News columnist Lee Cullum, bioinformatics researcher Stuart Kauffman, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer N. Scott Momaday, and USA Today columnist Walter Shapiro.\n\nA few weeks ago, Nesmith described this cocktail party to me in near-cosmic terms. In 1998, without the slightest nudge, he said, the thinkers formed a \"conversation circle\" - a kind of mental hackey-sack ring in which each person tossed an idea into the ether, another picked it up, kicked it around, added a mutation, offered it back.\n\nMaybe the room tonight is too cramped or the drinks are too strong. But as the waiters pass through with trays of caviar and grilled shrimp on sugarcane sticks, the scene looks suspiciously like a cocktail party.\n\nGell-Mann and Karnow commiserate about McNamara, 'Nam, the press. Gospel-rapper Giovanni mingles with Gihon investment manager Bruce Tyson, who tells anyone who will listen that his wife is former Cheers star Shelley Long. Law prof Bassiouni sits in a corner, beaming with his wife.\n\nKauffman, a star at the Santa Fe Institute, an elite science and tech research center, gets downright misty. \"Scott, do you have any idea how powerful a moment that was to me?\" he asks Momaday, referring to a line Momaday had uttered during the '92 council: \"The highest human purpose is always to reinvent and celebrate the sacred.\"\n\nKarnow is less reverent. Why, he wonders, should the council be closed-door? \"This is not the president of the United States coming out of a National Security Council meeting and issuing a communiqué,\" he says.\n\n\"Look,\" says journalist Shapiro, giving me his take on the councils. \"Nobody's going to read the Council on Ideas 2000 statement and say, 'You know, I've been running General Motors in an exploitative way in the Third World. But now that I know that the Gihon Foundation is concerned about the governing of multinational corporations, I'm going to change my behavior.'\n\n\"What has happened here,\" he says, \"is that a network has been created.\"\n\nWhich pretty much follows the model of most global-issue confabs, places where the cerebral set can forge connections - if not with the common man they're supposed to be helping, then at least with one another and various unemployed heads of state. Often as not, these events feature former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, who's found a second life as a globetrotting networker. In March, for example, attendees of the Earth Charter meeting in Paris (sponsored by Gorbachev) penned a blueprint for a better world. In November 1999, Gorbachev addressed the State of the Planet Conference in New York. As far back as 1995, the State of the World Forum in San Francisco (sponsored by the Gorbachev Foundation) inspired San Francisco Examiner columnist Rob Morse to remark that the city was now \"drawing a new class of tourists. Instead of Instamatics, they have Nobel Prizes around their necks.\"\n\nIn New Mexico, there's no Gorby. (Nesmith won't divulge whether the former president has ever been invited.) But there are local luminaries, including Kauffman, whose Bios Group turned complexity theory into a cash cow; Gell-Mann, who does \"plectics\" research at the Santa Fe Institute; and Dave Weininger, whose company, Daylight Chemical Information Systems, translates chemical data for computers. (See \"Greetings From Info Mesa,\" Wired 8.06, page 336.)\n\nAnna Roosevelt, for her part, seeks out an equally-famous-anthropologist-descendant-of-a-famous-person to talk strategy. What should I do tomorrow? she asks Bateson. Any advice?\n\n__\"How about making fun of white males sometimes, please?\" someone asks Karnow. So he tells a nostalgic story about Tammany Hall. __\n\nGrab a pen, Bateson tells her. Play secretary. If you want to take control and keep the council on track, write down the skeleton that becomes the draft. Plus, you can influence the final product. Carpe Bic.\n\n\"Sex,\" says Nikki Giovanni, heaving the words like an Olympic shot-putter, \"is the new nigger.\"\n\nThe council is officially in session, and Roosevelt is clutching her pen hard enough to make it bleed. Giovanni describes the killings of gay college student Matthew Shepard, beaten, tied to a fence and left to die, and black teenager Emmett Till, beaten and shot to death in 1950s Mississippi for talking to a white woman. Homophobia, she explains, is the new excuse for the kind of violence historically unleashed on blacks.\n\nHer colleagues, for a moment, are too stunned to speak. But that won't last long. Already this morning, Roosevelt has launched into a breathless, 15-minute monologue that touched on human rights, pygmies, and grandmothers. Gell-Mann jumped in with Islamic groups and female genital mutilation. Bassiouni expounded on globalization. Karnow discussed war, peace, poverty, and the relative stupidity of Chicagoans (a touchy subject - Roosevelt and Bassiouni happen to live there).\n\nGiovanni wants to abolish death row and compares GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush to Hitler. Later, she compares Republican Senator Jesse Helms to Hitler.\n\nKarnow interrupts. \"Helms is no Hitler.\"\n\nGiovanni: \"Depends on which tree you're swinging from.\"\n\nKarnow, disgusted: \"Come on!\"\n\nRoosevelt is fraying. Karnow is annoying her with all his quips, anecdotes, and Chicago-slagging. \"Institutional racism is dead,\" Karnow declares at one point. He also tells the story of a young boy in Vietnam who \"knew everything\" about computers. This inspires Roosevelt to lament that a lot of Chicago kids haven't had the chance to get computer-savvy.\n\n\"Vietnamese are smarter than Chicagoans,\" Karnow shrugs.\n\nAt which point, Giovanni jumps in. \"I know you were trying to joke,\" she says, \"but I'm compelled to say for whoever listens to this in 3000 that what you said was a terribly racist statement.\"\n\nKarnow: \"How about my saying the Vietnamese are smarter than Brooklynites?\"\n\nGiovanni soon decides to shut down and stay mum: Nothing personal, she's simply figured out that this group is like all the rest. People only want to hear themselves talk. But Roosevelt keeps trying.\n\n\"If you're going to crack jokes,\" she tells Karnow, \"how about making fun of white males sometimes, please?\"\n\nSo Karnow tells a nostalgic story about Tammany Hall, the corrupt-to-the-core political machine. \"Look at the services that Tammany provided,\" he says. \"The school system in New York City in the '30s was magnificent!\n\n\"I asked my mother one time, 'How do you vote?'\" Karnow continues. \"She said, 'I vote the way Irving tells me to vote.' I said, 'Who's Irving?' She said, 'Irving's the precinct captain. When the garbage is piled up on the sidewalk, do you think I'm going to call the Department of Sanitation to take it away? I call Irving, it gets taken away.'\"\n\n\"That's precisely what's objectionable!\" Bassiouni declares. \"Your mother, who has a connection with Irving, gets the service, and so-and-so who has no connection doesn't?\" And, yes, he says, there are people who miss Stalin and Hitler, too. \"That's the big joke in Europe,\" Bassiouni cries. \"Under Benito Mussolini, the trains ran on time!\"\n\nTo which Roosevelt replies: \"Trains run on time now.\"\n\nIt's easy to forget how big Nesmith was in his prime: an international pop star who was chums with John Lennon and whose image appeared on T-shirts and lunch boxes. His lanky frame and semi-subversive wisecracks made him the favorite Monkee of millions. He was a guitar-playing kid who left Dallas for Los Angeles in 1964 and two years later was in a band with record sales that rivaled the Beatles.\n\nNesmith had just released a pair of 45s under the name Michael Blessing (which went nowhere) when he heard an ad for \"four insane boys, age 17 to 21.\" Nez topped the age limit, but beat out some 400 applicants, including Stephen Stills (rejected for bad teeth and hair).\n\nThe concept was this: Four faux bandmates would play tunes provided by songwriters like Tommy Boyce, Bobby Hart, Neil Diamond, and Carole King. Crack studio musicians would record the music. Micky (a former child actor), Davy (a former thespian), and Peter and Mike (the musicians) would sing on their records, lip-sync on TV, and never play their own instruments. To help prime the pop-hit pump, Monkees creators Bert Schneider and Bob Rafelson (who later directed Five Easy Pieces) brought in über-producer Don Kirshner, the head of Screen Gems Music Publishing.\n\nThe concept rocked. The television show, which aired from 1966 to 1968, blended the frantic energy of A Hard Day's Night with Marx Brothers wit, and earned an Emmy in its first year. In their heyday, the Monkees sold 16 million albums.\n\nBut for Nesmith, who during this period penned the Linda Ronstadt hit \"Different Drum,\" letting other people write and play while the Monkees mimed soon became unbearable. Even worse, in 1967, when the Monkees were no longer prefab - the actual band was performing to sellout crowds - Kirshner still refused to let the quartet do anything more than sing on an album. Nesmith began to complain openly, and the cover was blown: America's Fab Four were fakes.\n\nThe Monkees won artistic control of their third album, Headquarters, but the golden days were over. And if Headquarters marked the start of the band's commercial decline, the 1968 film Head, its first feature-length movie, was the denouement.\n\nProduced by Rafelson with help from Jack Nicholson, Head was a dark, trippy box-office debacle in which the four heroes become, among many things, flecks of dandruff sucked out of Victor Mature's hair by a vacuum cleaner. It was the last train to quitsville. By 1969, the Monkees' TV show was kaput, and Peter Tork had left the group. By 1970, the Monkees were no more.\n\n__The walls around him were self-imposed limits, Nez realized. He produced a proto music-video show, sold it to Warner Bros., and MTV was born. __\n\nCut loose from the group, Nesmith did little but thrive. He formed the First National Band (and later, the Second National Band). He wrote a hit single, \"Joanne,\" and with the 1970 albums Magnetic South and Loose Salute helped to define, alongside Gram Parsons and the Byrds, the genre of country rock.\n\n\"Mike Nesmith? Why the hell not?\" Rolling Stone wrote, calling Loose Salute \"one of the hippest country rock albums in some time.\"\n\nIn the mid-'70s, Nesmith formed his own communications and record company, Pacific Arts. He signed unknowns and let them keep their master recordings - a practice unheard of in the record industry. He treated his own recordings like chemistry experiments, darting from acoustic country and New Wave to calypso and early rap. At the height of arena rock, he put out an album with a 64-page short story that he urged people to read while they listened. The Prison focused on Jason, a young man who finds freedom only when he realizes that the walls surrounding him are merely his self-imposed limits.\n\nThe Prison would remain Nesmith's guiding metaphor. Of course, after inheriting his mother's fortune, he could afford to take risks. \"The dude has a kachillion billion dollars,\" says George Steele, vice president of Pacific Arts from 1985 to 1995.\n\nBut Nez wanted to jump the curb more than buy the street. When a 1977 phone call came from his record company's European distributor (a new cable channel in Europe was looking for film clips of rock songs; did Nesmith have anything?), he didn't send in the standard promo clip of his band lip-syncing against a white backdrop. He asked a friend, Bill Dear, to direct a short film for his song \"Rio.\" Inspired by the Fred Astaire movies he loved, Nesmith crafted a seven-minute musical in which he crooned in a tuxedo, flew through the sky with mambo girls on his back, and slapsticked his way through a ballroom dance. The clip drove \"Rio\" up the pop charts in England; it also convinced Nesmith to produce Popclips, half-hour prototypes of Top 40 video shows, which aired in 1979. Nesmith later sold the concept and the shows to Warner Bros., and MTV was born.\n\nNesmith's next project was Elephant Parts, a mix of music videos and Saturday Night Live-styled skits that in 1982 won the first Grammy for best video. He produced a TV comedy show, Television Parts, that was praised by critics but swiftly yanked. More successfully, he produced movies: Repo Man, Tapeheads, Square Dance, and Timerider (the last of which he also cowrote and scored).\n\nAnd in 1990, Nez's Pacific Arts struck a deal with PBS to distribute home videos of the network's most popular shows. Several years later, the business began to look so promising that PBS tried to muscle Pacific Arts out so it could grab the profits. A 1999 federal court found PBS guilty of fraud and breach of contract, and awarded Nesmith $47 million.\n\nLife for his three former cohorts, meanwhile, was less dramatic. Dolenz spent 12 years in London directing British television, music videos, and a movie, and he played occasional small-town gigs. Jones returned to the stage in Oliver! and Godspell, moved to Pennsylvania, wrote a book, and joined a Teen Idols tour with Bobby Sherman and Herman's Hermits' Peter Noone. Tork, the group's most versatile musician, continued to play guitar, bass, banjo, and keyboards, and also worked as a waiter and teacher. Over the decades, the ex-bandmates sent Nesmith a steady stream of reunion offers, which, aside from playing two concerts in the '80s, he always declined. Then in 1996, Nesmith suddenly agreed to a tour, a new Monkees album (Justus), and an ABC television special. He finished the UK portion of the tour, but backed out before it reached the US.\n\nThis didn't do much for band member relations. Jones and Dolenz refused my requests to talk about Nesmith. Tork called, still sounding peeved.\n\n\"At the very best, it was impolite,\" says Tork, currently touring with his band Shoe Suede Blues. \"Mike has this idea about who he wants to be and what he wants to do. He wants to be a serious thinker, to be seen as somebody who is significant in the world of ideas.\"\n\n\"At some point,\" Tork figures, \"he decided it wasn't a good idea to act as if the Monkees was a wonderful thing - because it would trap him. And I'll have to say this for him: There's nothing to prove to me that he was wrong.\"\n\nMentioning the Monkees to him, in other words, is risky. But what mortal, given the gift of several minutes of Nez access, can resist? I wait for a calm moment when Nesmith is relatively alone (only three people hover nearby, instead of the usual herd).\n\nI choose my words carefully.\n\nME: How do you feel about being identified with the Monkees?\n\nNESMITH: (Silence.) I don't understand the question.\n\nME: How do you feel about the way that you're identified with the Monkees?\n\nNESMITH: (Pause.) I sort of don't think about it all. People identify me in all kinds of ways.\n\n__The brains cheated. The statement isn't a bold consensus on one premier issue - it's a global laundry list. No one minds. Lunch is served. __\n\nSo much for timing. If eyes are the window to the soul, Ijust saw the shutters slam shut.\n\nA honey truck - Hollywood-speak for portable toilets - parks near the entrance to Chez Nez. Valets with matching shirts and pants work the gate. But the rent-a-cops canceled, the printer is broken, and there are so many cars rolling in that Nesmith has to direct the overflow to the side of a dirt road. He's not perturbed. It's Sunday afternoon, and all will be OK.\n\nWhen it's almost noon, Anna Roosevelt emerges from the foundation building in a navy business suit, holding an iBook. The laptop belongs to Gell-Mann: He took over as secretary that morning to type up the position statement.\n\nTwo tents gleam in the sun - one is where the brains will announce their position statement, and the other is where Los Angeles chef-to-the-stars Celestino Drago has been flown in to prepare Maine lobster and Piedmontese beef for lunch.\n\nAbout 100 people fill the audience. Shortly after noon, the council members step smartly out of the foundation building. They assemble in Right Stuff style, a line of thinkers, each with his or her own microphone. The crowd is handed stapled copies of the three-page statement - one of the longest in council history - while Roosevelt begins to read: \"We are living in a time of accelerating globalization, and not only in commerce, finance, and communications. Moreover, we now have the ability to make very significant changes on a global scale that ...\"\n\nRoosevelt proceeds through a scattershot discourse that grazes a wide range of topics, from weapons of mass destruction (\"a very serious danger\") to unpunished international violence (\"without justice there can be no peace\") to democracy (encourage it) to social justice (expand it) to environmental protections, education, health care, protections for children, sustainable resource management, and a gill net's catch of other challenges: \"War and peace, extremes of poverty and wealth, intolerance and tolerance, resource exploitation and biological diversity, and crime and the rule of law.\"\n\nThe brains cheated. The statement isn't a bold consensus on one premier issue. It's a global laundry list.\n\nNo one minds. The post-statement Q&A mainly features softballs. One by one, the council members expound on the statement. Only Giovanni remains silent. Until, that is, a local reporter presses her for a comment.\n\n\"Sex,\" she declares, leaning toward the microphone, \"is the new nigger.\"\n\nThe crowd draws a collective breath. Giovanni tells the audience about homophobic violence and the lynchings of yesteryear, laying out the logic of her words. There are relieved \"oh-yes-I-see\" sighs. And then ... lunch is served.\n\nNesmith and Kennedy sit on the patio, happily watching their party unfold. When it's over, he'll wonder whether the whole gathering was a bit too lavish, too busy-busy, a little too full of itself. Oh well, he decides, that's how things unfold. We can make changes as we go.\n\nAnd then Nesmith spies Douglas Adams and Roosevelt in deep discussion at a table. Like a kid sneaking into a second movie, he slides into the tent to sit near them. The conversation is classically Gihonian: Adams is talking of aquatic apes and the Danakil hypothesis, a theory placing our ancestors in a watery environment off the coast of Africa. Roosevelt doesn't buy it. She tells him how one could determine whether a particular animal spent much time in the water. Look for an exostosis, a bony growth on the outside of the ear developed from diving, she says.\n\nAt the next table, Todd Siler gabs with physicist Ana Maria Ceto and mentions Jacob Bronowski, the scientist host of the 1970s BBC series The Ascent of Man. \"I've always loved his wonderful statement that all of science was the search for unity and hidden likenesses,\" he says.\n\nBack in the council office, Giovanni hands Summers, the Gihon Foundation staffer, a stack of signed poetry collections that the foundation has purchased. They will be placed on shelves in the hallway, where each council member's work remains under a framed glossy photo. Assessing her experience here, Giovanni says that there's a lot she found disappointing, from the \"closed minds\" of her council colleagues to the gourmet lunch. The risotto was undercooked, and don't get her started on the insensitivity of the tomato and orange faux martini. \"Some people are alcoholic,\" she says, referring to a tablemate who was terrified of touching the \"cocktail\" until someone assured him it was virgin.\n\nThen Giovanni softens. She has a question. When she met Nesmith for the first time, he summarized his history. Mother's success with Liquid Paper. Her desire to use the money for good. Then he mentioned his television show.\n\n\"Oh, my God,\" said Giovanni, unable to hold back. \"You're a Monkee.\"\n\nNow she looks at Summers. \"Do you think,\" Giovanni asks, \"he's angry that I didn't know who he was?\"\n\n\"No,\" Summers tells her. \"I don't think he minded at all.\""
