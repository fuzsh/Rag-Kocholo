        "text": "Michael Nesmith, who achieved global fame as a member of the pop group The Monkees, has died aged 78.\n\n“With infinite love we announce that Michael Nesmith has passed away this morning in his home, surrounded by family, peacefully and of natural causes,” his family said in a statement. “We ask that you respect our privacy at this time and we thank you for the love and light that all of you have shown him and us.”\n\nNesmith was the group’s guitarist, and also one of its songwriters, for tracks including The Girl I Knew Somewhere, Listen to the Band and Mary, Mary.\n\nAlongside Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones and Peter Tork, the group had huge hits including US chart-toppers Daydream Believer and I'm a Believer, having been formed for a TV sitcom about a rock'n'roll band. Nesmith successfully auditioned for the role of \"Mike\" in the show, in October 1965, having begun his music career as a jobbing folk music performer in Los Angeles.\n\nThe nature of The Monkees as a manufactured band became something of a millstone for the group, who fractured in the late 1960s following their psychedelic album Head. Nesmith left in 1970, following Tork’s departure in 1968.\n\nIn recent months, he had performed a reunion tour with the group. – Guardian"
