        "text": "His Majesty King Adulyadej Bhumibol The Great first met His future Queen in Paris in 1947, when she was an extremely beautiful teen-aged girl. The daughter of the Thai Ambassador in London, she was in Paris to study French and classical music. M.R. Sirikit could not have been more aptly named - Sirikit meaning beauty and honor. The 20-year-old King-to-be was enraptured by Sirikit whom he plied with music and poetry, composing a waltz in her honor entitled I Dream of You.\n\nThe lyrics for that blues number which Bhumibol dedicated to his bride-to-be, In the kingdom of my dreams, you are my queen... Please make my dreams come true, were soon to be real. The couple were married in Bangkok on 28 April 1950. At the auspicious time of 10:24, chosen by the Buddhist Astrologers, the 22-year-old King of Thailand married the love of his life, M.R. Sirikit Kitiyakara.\n\nPortrait of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit painted by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej.\n\nNot even a King, however, can escape bureaucracy and, after paying the 10-baht marriage fee, the young couple received a traditional blessing from his grandmother, Sawang Vadhana, who anointed them and sprinkled them with holy water which had been blessed daily by four Buddhist monks for more than 160 years.\n\nThe young newlyweds, like any other just-married couple, escaped to the privacy of their honeymoon hideaway - in their case the Klai Kangwol (Far from Worry) Palace on the Western Gulf, hardly pausing to examine their wedding gifts from many of the worlds leaders.\n\nA week later, on the fifth of May 1950, Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej was crowned King, the Ninth Rama of the Chakri Dynasty. Towards the end of the splendid coronation ceremonies, the young King elevated his new bride Sirikit to become Queen Somdej Phranang Chao.\n\nThailands King, the worlds longest-reigning Monarch, and His lovely Queen are known universally as the quintessence of devotion, dedication and tireless application to the development and well-being of each and every one of Their subjects."
