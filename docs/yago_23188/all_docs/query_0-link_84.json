        "text": "The late King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand was the first non-British monarch to make an official tour of Australia.\n\nHe flew into Canberra towards the end of August 1962, accompanied by his wife, Queen Sirikit.\n\nDespite the icy weather, The Canberra Times reported that 5,000 people packed into the Fairbairn airbase and a further 7,000 lined the route to Government House in Yarralumla.\n\nHundreds were waving the Thai flag, though only \"scores of Thai people\" were described among the crowds.\n\nThe White Australia Policy was still extant in 1962 and only a tiny minority of the 1.6 million migrants to arrive between 1945 and 1960 were from Asia, but there were Thai students in Canberra as a result of the Colombo Plan and a nascent interest in regional affairs beginning to appear â€” especially in academic circles.\n\nThis might explain some of the interest in this visit, but the glamour of 30-year-old Queen Sirikit, regularly included in lists of the world's most beautiful women, was thought to be the main attraction for many observers, who were reported to have gasped as she emerged from the plane in a rather divine mink coat.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1967, the English-speaking King and Queen left their four children at home while they undertook an intense and almost continuous mission to promote trade and goodwill between Thailand and the rest of the world. They were also seeking military and diplomatic support in these years of communist activity in South-East Asia.\n\nIn the era of the \"domino theory\", Thailand was regarded as a crucial bulwark against the spread of communism into countries including Indonesia and Australia itself. In May 1962, Australia had sent a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) squadron to Thailand when insurgents from Laos had crossed into the country from the north.\n\nThe welcome ceremony in 1962 demonstrated the importance of the relationship. Attended by the most senior politicians, the diplomatic corps, the service chiefs and a full complement of wives, it included a 21-gun salute, a fly-past and the Thai national anthem. The RAAF band even played a series of jazz numbers composed by the King, a keen amateur musician.\n\nAt the state banquet that night, the King thanked Australia for its prompt assistance during the Laotian crisis, reminded his audience that Thailand was not the 'Far East' as the British called it, but actually the 'Near North', and called for the number of Thai students to be greatly increased.\n\nPrime Minister Robert Menzies replied saying Australia and Thailand were not only friends through the joint membership of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO), but were also that \"better thing\", a \"friend of the heart, the spirit and the mind\".\n\n\"We have also a profound love of peace in our hearts,\" he said.\n\nIn the 17 days that followed, the royal couple visited the Australian National University (ANU), a preschool and a Girl Guide training centre, where 2,500 girls assembled to see the Queen.\n\nShe also drew a crowd of more than 1,000 when she watched a donor giving blood at the Red Cross.\n\nAt the steelworks in Port Kembla, the King caused a stir by walking away from a carefully selected row of workers in well-laundered white overalls towards a gang of fitters and foundry hands. It was reported that \"some were embarrassed by their hands being greasy from their work, but the King carried through with his handshakes without pause\".\n\nKing Bhumipol travelled in Western suits and military dress, but his wife was famous for her haute couture, enhanced by subtle but exotic Eastern flair.\n\nIn 1962, her day clothes were made from Australian wool by French designer Pierre Balmain and her exquisite evening dresses in dazzling Thai silk.\n\nThe Australian Women's Weekly had sent a photographer to Bangkok prior to the tour and featured the Queen and her beautiful clothes on the cover and inside pages of several editions. But not everyone was gushing.\n\nThe Secretary of the New South Wales Labor Council said it was vulgar to display expensive jewellery (reported to be worth 240,000 pounds, or roughly $6.5m in today's terms) and that \"his heart went out to the poor people of her country\".\n\nThe King and Queen later sent their son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, to the Royal Military College in Canberra. Queen Sirikit returned here briefly in 1975 to attend his graduation."
