        "text": "Thailand's Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn has asked the government to strip his wife's family of their royally bestowed name.\n\nIt comes after seven of her close relatives were arrested in a purge of officials allegedly involved in corruption.\n\nPrincess Srirasmi Akrapongpreecha is Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn's third wife, and the pair married in 2001.\n\nThe move is widely expected to be a first step to divorce.\n\nHe was already known to be estranged from the princess, although they continued to attend official functions together.\n\nThe purge of Princess Srirasmi's family over the past 10 days has been widely reported in Thailand.\n\nHowever, until now the severity of the lese majeste law criminalising any critical comment about the monarchy meant that no Thai media had pointed out the family connection.\n\nThe princess's uncle, a senior police general, was arrested over accusations of amassing vast wealth through smuggling and gambling rackets.\n\nFour of her siblings and two other relatives have also been held.\n\nThe office of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn has now sent a letter to the interior ministry ordering her family to be stripped of the royal name he bestowed on them when he married her.\n\nThe dramatic downfall of Princess Srirasmi comes at a very sensitive time, analysts say, with the 86 year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej in poor health.\n\nAs the Crown Prince's wife, she would have been expected to become Queen when he succeeds his father, a potentially very powerful position given the exalted status of the monarchy in Thailand.\n\nThe pivotal position of the monarchy in Thailand's political order makes the succession an extremely sensitive issue, many aspects of which still cannot be reported from inside the country.\n\nThe world's longest-reigning monarch, King Bhumibol has been on the throne in Thailand since 1946."
