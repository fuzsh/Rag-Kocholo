        "text": "BANGKOK — Really now, I start to sound like a broken record everytime I’m in this “amazing” (to quote the country’s tourism pitch) city where temples rise in all their magnificence in the vicinity of bars that sizzle with fleshy shows as night falls, competing for the tourists’ attention and greenbacks with the tiangge — and more skin shows — which turns that narrow eskinita called Phat Pong into a bustling little city by itself.\n\nEverywhere I go, whether on a Canal Cruise or at the Crocodile Farm (with an eye-popping elephant show) or at the lobby of the Baiyoke Sky Hotel nice place to stay; for inquiries and/or reservations, call 66 (0) 2656-3000 or 66 (0) 2656-3456 at the Paragon (or any of the malls selling items at very affordable, as in “bargain,” prices), the first question I invariably ask a Thai, young and old alike is, “How is Apasra Hongsakula?” Preceded by an approving smile, a Thai would usually answer, “She’s okay, still very beautiful!”\n\nThat is, 42 years after she won Miss Universe.\n\nHere’s a backgrounder from Funfare contributor Dave Enriquez: Apasra Hongsakula was born in 1948 in Bangkok. She was the first from Thailand to capture the Miss Universe crown in 1965 (the same year Gemma Cruz won for the Philippines its first Miss International crown). Apasra was raised in Bangkok and was sent to a boarding school in Singapore. She later married a military man who was the first cousin of Queen Sirikit. (Apasra and her husband are divorced; he’s now married to Emma Ruth Yulo, a beauty queen from the Philippines. — RFL) Like the Royal Thai family, Apasra is still very much revered figure in Thailand.\n\nAt 5’4”, Apasra is the shortest Miss Universe; until Gloria Diaz, also a petite 5’4”, won the same title (the first for the Philippines). Before going to Miami for the pageant, Apasra received precious pointers from Queen Sirikit, herself an icon of beauty not only in Thailand but in the whole world, on how to strike a pose and how to walk with grace. In 1992 when Thailand hosted the pageant, Apasra was crowned again at a private function by the Miss Universe Organization, with 1991 Miss Universe Lupita Jones (of Mexico) doing the honors. (In the old days, most of the title-holders didn’t get to keep the crown.)\n\nRecently, my friend Raoul Tidalgo and I were in this city for a three-day holiday and, guess what, we were able to set foot in the beauty-slimming spa owned and operated by Apasra herself, after whom the spa is named, at a quiet area of the city (#95, Soi Ladprao, 23 Bangkok 10900; tel. no. 02-930-5444). Unfortunately, Apasra was unseen but strongly felt. She was just a gracious beautiful voice on the phone.\n\nIt was like this: Raoul and I were walk-in customers (meaning we didn’t make any appointment) but even then, we were very nicely received, ushered into a waiting room downstairs and served green tea, with cookies to boot. The secretary asked what services we wanted (Supreme Vitamin C Treatment, Supreme Collagen Lift, Whitening Treatment, Cellulite Massage, Body Scrub, Milk Bath, etc.) and when we told her that we came to have a brief interview with Apasra (who, the secretary said, was upstairs busy with a client), she asked for our press ID. We didn’t bring any. The secretary told us to wait, anyway, went upstairs and was profuse with apologies when she came back, saying that “Miss Apasra” was much too busy to see us.\n\nUndaunted, Raoul and I said we could wait. The secretary who, by this time, must be suspecting that we were “stalkers” pretending to be journalists (remember, we didn’t have press IDs with us), brought us magazine to browse. Thirty minutes passed, and another 30 minutes, but still no Apasra. When the secretary came back, we begged her if we could talk to Apasra even just on the phone and, after conferring with “Miss Apasra” upstairs, we got our wish.\n\n“So now that you’ve talked to me, you will leave now?” Apasra said in a very soft voice, very lady-like, very malumanay, still very nice, very gracious and “very Miss Universe” on the phone. (If I were in her shoes, I’d be “suspicious,” too. Imagine two strangers showing up at your spa sans appointment. He, he, he!)\n\nYes, Raoul and I told her, thanking her for letting us hear her voice even if we didn’t see her, although we did strongly feel her presence.\n\n“Thank you very much for being so nice,” we repeated, “and for the nice reception and the refreshing green tea and the delicious cookies.”\n\n(Postscript: First thing I do this morning is send via Fedex copies of today’s STAR to “Miss Apasra.” By the way, Raoul and I would like to thank the following: PAL PR 730 guys for making our trip back to Manila a wonderful experience; FLT purser Rowena Paderna; and cabin crew members Jojo Adarme, Dingdong Tabuena, Wilma Garcia, Matet Gueco, Michelle Herrera, Joy Panopio, Esther Sanchez, Mae Sian and Jackie Torralba.)\n\nUpcoming stars in int’l beauty contests\n\nSpeaking of beauties, here’s a report from Funfare’s “beauty experts” Felix Manuel, Joey Cezeare, Gery Yumping and Francis Calubaquib:\n\nThree upcoming TV stars were chosen to represent the country in international beauty contests scheduled in the last quarter of the year. They are:\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â Annrhea Macapagal, 17 and 5’7” tall, to the Miss Bikini World in China in December. A native of Rizal, Annrhea began her modeling career when she won Miss Bikini Summit 2007: Battle of the Sexiest. She was also one of the winners of Circle of Ten Teen Model Search and one of the 26k of ABS-CBN’s Kapamilya Deal or No Deal.\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â Princess Ryan, 18 and 5’6”, to the Miss Bikini International in Taiwan next month. A Leytena, she began her TV career when she became a finalist at the Global Pinay Pageant on ABS-CBN’s Magandang Tanghali Bayan and became a member of the station’s Star Circle Batch 13. The ramp/commercial model is a regular host of TEEN and a semi-regular on A.S.A.P. ’07.\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ÂÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â Steff Prescot, 17 and 5’5”, to the Miss Internet World 2007 (won last year by Carlene Ang Aguilar). A StarStruck 4 Avenger (on GMA 7), she’s half-Filipina and half-American who grew up in Seattle, Washington. She moved in the Philippines in July 2003 and stays with her parents in La Union. Under contract with the GMA Artist Center, she is currently a mainstay of Boys Nxt Door.\n\nMore Insiang playdates\n\nTanghalang Pilipino, in cooperation with Bright Eyed Boys Event Ideas, Inc., brings back the Aliw Awards Best Play for 2003 Insiang. The stage production also bagged the Best Stage Actor, Best Stage Actress, Best Director and nominations for the Best Supporting Actor. From Oct. 12 to 14, Insiang will have another limited run at the Tanghalang Huseng Batute (CCP Studio Theater) with matinees at 3 p.m. (Saturdays/Sundays) and evening shows at 8 p.m. (Fridays/Saturdays/Sundays).\n\nAward-winning writer, director and actor, Mario O’Hara’s masterpiece was originally written for radio then developed as a teleplay for the TV series Hilda directed by Lino Brocka. It was adapted by O’Hara into a screenplay for the 1976 Manila Film Festival, starring Hilda Koronel in the title role, with Mona Lisa, Ruel Vernal and Rez Cortez playing key roles. The movie version became the first Filipino film to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival and went on to win plum awards for its director and leading actress Hilda Koronel.\n\nNearly 30 years after, Tanghalang Pilipino mounted the stage version in 2002 as part of its 16th Theater season. Directed by Chris Milado, the “live” theater version attracted full houses and became the box office hit of the season.\n\nSheenly Vee Gener (Insiang), Ricky Davao (Dado), and Mae Paner (Toyang) and the Tanghalang Pilipino Actors Company reprise their award winning performances. Mailes Kanapi joins the production as Pacing, the mother of Insiang.\n\nDirector Chris Millado leads the creative team in recreating the riveting 2002 production from the ensemble acting down to the highly detailed “hyper-real” staging. Hesus Bobot Lota designs the wrap-around set, with Joey Nombres and Jethro Joaquin doing lighting design and soundscape respectively. The production also includes fight scenes skillfully choreographed by Jack Yabut.\n\nInsiang is a stirring drama about the transformation of a teenage girl from innocence to malevolence as she finds herself trapped by a life of poverty in the slums. Abused by the very people she trusts, Insiang rises from destitution and takes revenge against her abusers.\n\nDue to strong language, adult themes and brief nudity, parental discretion is advised.\n\nOn each performance a limited number of seats are available which offer an exciting and unique way to experience the performance with the action of the show taking place all around the viewer. A Q&A session with select members of the cast and creatives can be arranged specially for class, community or company groups regarding themes in Insiang i.e. gender, women, poverty, “soap opera” and advertising, design, stage fight, and corruption.\n\n(For tickets, reservations, group bookings and special discounts, please call the Bright Eyed Boys at 521-0412 or 0922-8712007. Tickets are also available at all Ticketworld outlets.)"
