        "text": "Born a second son on December 5, 1927, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at a time when the world was lurching towards the Great Depression, Bhumibol Adulyadej was never meant to rule. His father, Songkla Mahidol, was by all accounts a courteous and unassuming medical student at Harvard whose young wife, Mom Sangwan, was taking courses in nursing and nutrition.\n\nA commoner, she must have had little inkling that not one but two of her sons would within a few years of each other accede to the throne of the Royal House of Chakri, the dynasty founded in Bangkok in 1782.\n\nHer husband was in fact a half-brother to Thailand's then king and the 69th of 77 children of the dynasty's modernising King Chulalongkorn, who had died in 1910.\n\nThe dynasty was drifting by 1932, when a bloodless coup ended absolute monarchy and King Prajadhipok, who was childless, fled to England and abdicated three years later, pushing the royals further to the margins.\n\nDespite the fact that King Chulalongkorn had fathered 32 sons and 45 daughters by 36 different queens or consorts by the time he had reached 40, the pool of princes had drained during and after his reign.\n\nPrince Ananda found himself first in line for the throne and was recognised as king by the Thai National Assembly in March 1935.\n\nThe king and his younger brother Prince Bhumibol were inseparable as they grew up in Switzerland after the death of their father in 1929, sharing a passion for fast cars, setting up electric train sets or poring over magazines or board games.\n\n\"They were like twins â€“ buddies, who were fond of one another more than they were of other friends,\" their elder sister Princess Galyani recalled later. The royal brothers remained constant companions after they returned to Thailand in December 1945, on Prince Bhumibol's 18th birthday.\n\nPrince Bhumibol became King Ananda's shadow and official photographer, earning a small monthly stipend as contributing photographer to a royal family-owned magazine. The brothers acquired a surplus US army jeep for their less formal outings and started a gun collection. In the afternoons they would conduct target practice on the Grand Palace's lawn.\n\nIt was not until 33 years after King Ananda's death that King Bhumibol spoke publicly about the tragedy. \"Many people wanted to advance not theories but facts to clear up the affair. They were suppressed - and they were suppressed by influential people in this country or in international politics,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThree months after acceding to the throne, King Bhumibol left Thailand to study political science and law in Switzerland, telling his subjects \"it is essential that I re-create myself\". He made regular trips to Paris, where he fell in love with a cousin, Sirikit Kitiyakara, an aspiring pianist who was the daughter of the leading Thai diplomat in Europe. He announced his engagement to the future queen on her 17th birthday on July 19, 1949, in London.\n\n\"I'm still too young and have never been in love before ... it also excites me,\" Sirikit said at the time.\n\nKing Bhumibol was 24 when he finished his education and returned to Thailand permanently in 1951, as Thais were trying to put their wartime occupation by Japan behind them and rebuild ties with the West.\n\nThe early years of his reign were marred by friction with the country's postwar government. \"When I'd open my mouth and suggest something, they'd say: 'Your Majesty, you don't know anything',\" he recalled in an interview in 1989. \"So I shut my mouth. I know things, but I shut my mouth.\"\n\nBut despite having little actual power in those early days, King Bhumibol worked to revive abandoned Chakri traditions and through many appearances around the country boosted the royal prestige. Senior courtiers and others helped him steer the monarchy into being the country's central institution.\n\nThe king created foundations that became operational bases for his philanthropy and development work. His patronage spread through thousands of projects, such as tackling leprosy and tuberculosis and establishing hospitals and clinics and schemes including fish breeding and dairying in rural areas.\n\nHe presented scholarships and awards to improve the country's poor healthcare system. He helped the poor and disadvantaged, creating the belief among many Thais that he was the source of his kingdom's harmony and Buddhist spirit. He became particularly preoccupied with improving the lives of farmers.\n\nRemaining on the throne during 29 changes of prime minister, 16 coups and 16 constitutions, his stature and political acumen grew while communist revolutions and other turmoil toppled the ancient monarchies of neighbouring Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. By the 1960s royalists allied with the Thai military had resecured the monarchy's financial base and resacralised the institution.\n\nAlthough Thailand is a constitutional monarchy, the king retained more power than the Queen or other constitutional monarchs. He could veto laws passed by parliament, pardon convicted criminals and approve or disapprove cabinet ministers. His pet development projects received priority funding.\n\n\"With his image of devotion to the peasantry, constant ceremonial presence, promotion as the centrepiece of national identity and increasing longevity, the king's baramee (accumulated merit) steadily increased,\" historians Chris Baker and Pasuk Phongpaichit wrote, referring to the 1980s.\n\nThais overwhelmingly saw the king as an earnest, hardworking and gentle ruler with an impeccably simple lifestyle. Slim and impassive, he cut an imposing public figure in royal ceremonies until ill health confined him to a wheelchair when he was in his 80s. He spoke five languages and was a musician, sailor, painter, writer, inventor and photographer. His picture hangs in many Thai homes and offices and Thais stand in respect when a video of him is shown in movie theatres. They prostrated themselves when they were presented before him. Schools taught respect for him and the notion of his near-infallibility and beneficence.\n\nOne of the king's greatest loves was music. He played the clarinet and saxophone and was a composer. For many years musicians gathered at Bangkok's Chitralada Palace for jam sessions. He always carried his trademark camera.\n\nHe took in a stray dog called Thongdaeng and wrote a book about her that was seen as a parable on many social topics and became a bestseller.\n\nMillions of Thais streamed onto the streets to celebrate the 60th anniversary of his accession to the throne in 2006, the high point of his reign. The public reverence for him was carefully nurtured over decades by a formidable palace public relations machine and harsh lese-majeste laws that punish criticism of the monarchy.\n\nThais have never pried too far into the private life of the king or his family, given that even a casual comment on the privileged way of life in the palace could lead to 15 years' imprisonment on each count of lese-majeste. Use of the charge has skyrocketed in recent years, from an average of five cases in 1992 to a high of 478 in 2010.\n\nThai media and foreign journalists based in Thailand have reported on the king and other members of the royal family under the law's severe restrictions, including this article, which includes quotes and information from the palace-approved book King Bhumibol Adulyadej, A Life's Work, published in 2011.\n\nAfter an increase in politically-inspired lese-majeste complaints in 2005, King Bhumibol used his birthday address to criticise use of the law, saying the British phrase \"the king can do no wrong\" implied the king was not human. \"But the king can do wrong,\" he said, arguing that when the king is not subject to criticism he is \"in trouble\".\n\nAlthough the king's comments were unambiguous, authorities dropped few cases and freed none of those already in jail. Former prime minister Anand Panyarachun, who chaired a board that advised on A Life's Work, told the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand in 2007 that \"you have to go by the will of the people ... I am sure that the king does not mind whether the [lese-majeste] law exists or not but the Thai people never, never tolerate criticism of the king ... I believe that Thais are more royalist than the king.\"\n\nIn 2005 Duncan McCargo, professor of political science at the University of Leeds, published an article on what he called the \"network monarchy\" in Thailand, making the case that the Thai monarchy is not merely the royal family but an entire network of relationships stretching into the Privy Council and the top ranks of the military.\n\nThrough a little-known agency called the Crown Property Bureau, King Bhumibol controlled investments and properties worth an estimated $US30billion, including vast land holdings and controlling stakes in some of the country's biggest companies. In Bangkok alone the bureau owns 8400 hectares, mostly in the historic part of the city. The assets belong to the monarchy as an institution which continues from reign to reign, not in the monarch's private capacity, A Life's Work says.\n\nPalace officials have long insisted the king remained above Thailand's politics as constitutional monarch while his behind-the-scenes roles have been the subject of debate among royal watchers, historians and commentators. The king endorsed at least half a dozen coups between 1957 and 1991.\n\nThe king was suffering ongoing health issues from the early 2000s as a power struggle emerged between a dominant rural-based majority and a mostly urban middle class minority frustrated by its inability to win elections or influence national politics.\n\nEven when he was ageing and frail, his opaque public utterances were minutely dissected for advice to the nation. But amid the current bitter divide in Thai society, the king chose not to intervene directly, urging Thais to work together for the common good.\n\nOn May 26, 2014, the king signed a letter endorsing army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha, who had seized power in a bloodless coup four days earlier, but made no public comment or public appearance.\n\nOutside a Bangkok hospital where the king died peacefully at 3.52pm Thailand time on Thursday, thousands of Thais gazed skyward with tear-filled eyes.\n\nLoading\n\n\"Long live the king! Long Live the King!\" they cried.\n\nThis article includes quotes and information from the palace-approved book King Bhumibol Adulyadej: A Life's Work, published in 2011, and was written under the restrictions of Thailand's lese-majeste laws."
