        "text": "THE HELICOPTER HAS JUST touched down, stirring the dust of a parched land waiting for summer rains, when its door opens and silk parasols, borne by guards in the costumes of an ancient Asian court, float above the head of the slender, solemn man in military uniform emerging from the aircraft. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Rama\n\nIX of the 207-year-old Chakri Dynasty, has arrived in Thailand's eastern Chonburi Province to consecrate a temple and to visit a small corner of his realm.\n\nDuring this not-untypical day, he rewards 350 people who have contributed in some way to the building of Wat Nyanasangvararam Varamahavihara, a Buddhist meditation retreat under royal patronage. (One by one, they kneel at his feet to accept a citation.) He tours a model farm and agricultural training center for poor rural children, where he talks for nearly two hours with agronomists on choices of crops. He accepts from a European businessman the gift of a small Swiss-style chalet on the bank of a new reservoir, which the King had built to ease water shortages in the arid area. In the evening, he dines with regional military commanders and provincial government leaders.\n\nIt is midnight when King Bhumibol, Queen Sirikit, their daughter Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn and a convoy of royal guards and officials return, by car, to Chitralada Palace in Bangkok, about 100 miles away.\n\nThere is much that is mysterious about how Thailand's monarchy works and how its royal family lives, and much that is not said because of the strictest lese-majeste laws in the world. Even a casual comment on the privileged way of palace life, as a politician found out recently, can result in arrest and imprisonment; and members of the domestic and foreign press are careful not to overstep the unwritten but clearly understood limits of what can be written about the King and his family.\n\nLittle, therefore, is known about the private life of the longest reigning monarch in Siamese history and, since Emperor Hirohito's death early this year, the longest-reigning living monarch anywhere. However, it is evident that the 61-year-old King - a constitutional monarch but the inheritor of a mystical power still keenly sensed and fiercely defended by most Thais - has understood and used his heritage skillfully.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
