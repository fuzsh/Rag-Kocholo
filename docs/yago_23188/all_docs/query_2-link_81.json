        "text": "Constitutional Monarchy\n\nA constitutional monarch is above politics. He lives under the law of the kingdom, but cannot be involved in politics. In fact, all royals with the ranks of Mom Chao (Serene Highnesses) up cannot be involved in politics, nor have any voting rights, including not being able to join political parties nor become politicians. In addition, the royals should not show their slant towards any particular political parties.\n\nHis Majesty King Bhumibol has acted righteously in all of the political events of Thailand from past to present. He has only become involved during extreme situations involving bloodshed, and then only as a mediator between two or more factions, trying to get to a solution of calm and peace. Lately, many has forgotten the role of the King, and tried to drag his good name into the political mess. The King continues to stand tall, and has not involved himself. He neither denies nor accepts any misconceptions thrown out at him, as the modern Thai people continues to show their ignorance in not knowing what a constitutional king can or cannot do. Even political individuals have also forgotten this, and tries to drag the King’s good name to their sides, only with the sole intention of trying to win over the voice of the people. Many descendants of the different royal houses (rankings of Mom Rajawongse down) have also become involved in the different sides, and have dragged the King’s good name with them as well. They are in fact not counted as royals, but as citizens of the kingdom, who are descendants of royalty, but now have rights to vote and make known their political views. Even they have forgotten the role of a constitutional monarch, as well as how their fathers (Mom Chaos), as royals, were expected to act in the good name of the Thai Royal Family. In truth, at least one Mom Chaos has sided with political persons in the past, for individual gains. These types of action are degrading to the monarchy, as well as the good memories of past kings.\n\nThe King and His People\n\nHis Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej was undoubtedly his people’s King; the Father of the Land. When he moved back to Thailand for good in 1951, he began his visits to his people almost straight away. He is the first Thai King, and Thai individual, to see every single corners of his kingdom. He has visited far-reaching places. Where there were no roads, he used helicopters; where there were no place for helicopters to land, he went by jeeps, horses, as well as on foot. It is said that he is the only individual in Thailand, past and present, and most probably the future, to see every single square inch of his land. With his visits, he brought medical teams as well as surveyors to plan the connection of all towns and villages, a route to prosperity. He helped with irrigation problems as the majority of the Thai people were farmers, depending solely on their crops for their income. He has also eradicated the opium growing culture of many hilltribes of the north, and proposed substitutions with valuable crops. During the time of natural crisis, the King has always been the first person to be on the scene. Only until recently that the King has not been able to travel to the affected places due to health problems, nevertheless, his team has continued to visit and help out according to the King’s instructions. In addition, he has continued to contribute personal funds quick and fast to the needy, as seen most recently with the flooding disaster around the Kingdom in late 2010, when the King’s team was the first to act the fastest, while government team became the slowest, especially with all the bureaucracies they had to go through before help could be dispatch to the flooding victims. With the continual disputes within the political world, the Thai people are becoming more and more dependent on their King to guide them through everyday lives; a source of simple strength needed to lead a happy life in this ancient Kingdom.\n\nThe Thai Concept of Kingship\n\nA King is the Father of the Land. It’s quite a simple concept, really. A father is expected to look after his children and give them the basic needs to live on, and provide good basic education for them, as foundation to make a living when they are grown up. The good children will then look after their father in old age, so that he will have a comfortable life after he retires.\n\nHis older and wiser children were to form a group that would continue their father’s work, to better the lives of the younger children and bring peace and prosperity to the family and their home. The King, though, is father to over 60 million children, and growing. He has looked after his millions of children quite well, as witnessed by his actions through his visits, his projects, and his personal funds, all for the betterment of his country. I have to say that he has been the hardest working monarch in the world, as his subjects were not as healthy as others, nor were living in good conditions. But, the Thai people were happy back then, as they had simpler lives, and had the very basic needs. The ones that were quite lost, and lived away from developed areas were looked after by the King, and they were then slowly but surely connected to the civilization that make up the Kingdom. He has tried to improve education by setting up schools in rural, unreachable areas, and provided funds for their continuations. It is so much a single person can do for the 60 million subjects. It could have been quite easy for the government, the supposedly wiser and mature children, to continue these projects, as the basic foundation have been laid. With sound education, the Thai subjects could have moved to a better life working in jobs that were provided by the government and the private sector. The subjects would have been happy, with better lives, and no quarrels in politics. The subjects, in turn, will come to look after their King as a child to a father. Unfortunately, the King does not get to retire. And, it seems no one is looking after him when he has entered old age.\n\nA Father is also expected to be the pillar of strength for his children. Indeed, the King has certainly been a very strong pillar. With the cumbersome bickering between political parties, unending it seems, since Thailand changed from absolute monarchy to a constitutional one, with what is called the system of democracy introduced to the land. This constant bickering has not benefited the country much, though Bangkok has seen huge developments in terms of infrastructures and much else, the rural areas are still in need of catching up, where some far-reaching areas are still without electricity. So, the King travelled again and again, and tried to bring developments to these areas. Personal funds can never be enough without the government’s additional monetary help. So, with the King going it alone, the underdeveloped parts will be slow to see their light-of-day.\n\nThe Thai people, especially the rural Thais, need someone who really cares just to be there as a comfort among chaos. The King has been just that. Photos of the King and Queen adorn the walls of most homes in Thailand, for that reason. When they feel bad, they look up to the King’s photo for comforting thoughts. When they are happy, they look up to the King’s photo to thank him for having been their King.\n\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej died peacefully on 13 October 2016, after a long illness. He was 83 years old. As most Thai people have known only him as their benevolent king, the new era is a big change for everyone. But the late king as set a strong path for the monarchy, and his children will continue to carry on the good works under a new guiding light of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, Rama X of the Chakri Dynasty.\n\nHis Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn (Rama X of the Chakri Dynasty)\n\nHis Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn was born on 28 July 1952, the only son of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit. His Majesty was invested the title of Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Thailand on 28 December 1972. He received his education at Kings Mead and Millfield Schools in Great Britain, and at the King's School and the Royal Military College at Duntroon, Australia. He also received the Degree of Bachelor of Laws from Sukhothai Thammatirat University, Thailand.\n\nSince he was young, he was inclined towards the life in the military, and has since shown himself to be a great Military Man. After his father, he has immersed himself in activities in promotion of the general welfare and economic betterment of his people as well as activities in promotion of public health through the Crown Prince Hospital and the Maha Vajiralongkorn Foundation. He has also represented his father on numerous State Visits abroad, far too many to list in just a page.\n\nHis Majesty first married in 1977 M.L. Somsavali Kitiyakara, a cousin from Queen Sirikit's side, who then became HRH (Pra Chao Vorawongse Ther Pra Ong Chao) Princess Somsavali. They have one daughter.* His second marriage was to Yuvadhida Polpraserth in 1994, hence she became Mom Sujarinee Mahidol Na Ayudhya. After their divorce, she became Sujarinee Vivacharawongse. They had 4 sons and one daughter.** The then Crown Prince then was married to HRH Princess Sri Rasmi, The Royal Consort, formerly Srirasmi Akharaphongpreecha and now known as Thanpuying Busaba Suwadi, from 10 February 2004 to 11 December 2014. They have one son.*** In 2019, a few days before his coronation, the king married Suthida Tidjai on 1 May 2019. At his Coronation Ceremony on 4 May, the king bestowed the title of Queen Consort on his wife, and decalred her HM Queen Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana.\n\nThe Children of King Maha Vajiralongkorn are:\n\nHRH Princess Bajrakitiyabha Narendira Debyavati, the Princess Rajasarinisiribajra (7 December 1978)*\n\nHSH Mom Chao (Prince) Juthavachara (29 August 1979)**\n\nHSH Mom Chao (Prince) Vacharaesorn (27 May 1981)**\n\nHSH Mom Chao (Prince) Chakriwat (26 February 1983)**\n\nHSH Mom Chao (Prince) Vatchrawee (14 June 1985)**\n\nHRH Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana Rajakanya (8 January 1987) (previously HSH Mom Chao Busya Nambejara)**\n\nHRH Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti Sirivibulyarajakumar (29 April 2005)***\n\nAs King Rama X of the Chakri Dynasty, a long tradition of kingship in the ancient Kingdom of Thailand continues on, shaping the country and its people in ways that are uniquely Thai.\n\nToolkramom Ying Ubolratana Rajakanya\n\nToolkramom Ying Ubolratana was born HRH Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya on 5 April 1951, eldest child of Their Majesties King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit. After finishing her education in the United States of America, she relinquished her royal title to marry an American commoner. She has since been bestowed royal decorations entitling her to use the title of \"Thanpuying.\" The Thai people though uses the courtesy title of \"Toolkramom Ying,\" an informal way of addressing a \"Chao Fa\" in Thai. She has lived most of her life in the United States with her then husband, Peter Jensen, and their three children,\n\nMiss Ploypailin Jensen (13 February 1981)\n\nMr. Bhumi (Poom) Jensen (1983-2004)\n\nMiss Sirikitiya Jensen (19 March 1985)\n\nAfter her divorce, the princess has moved back to Thailand, and has embarked on many activities for the betterment of the Thai people. One notable project is the \"To Be Number One\" project which deals with the drug problems in the kingdom.\n\nIn December 2004, the Toolkramom Ying visited Phuket for an official function and a private holiday with her family, and witnessed first hand the Tsunami that devastated the South of Thailand. In the event, she lost her son, Khun Poom, to the waves. She has since set up the Khun Poom Foundation to help autistic children in Thailand."
