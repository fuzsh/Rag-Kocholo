He mentioned the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, signed in St Petersburg in 1897. The President handed to King Bhumibol Adulyadej a copy of a letter by King Rama V to Emperor Nicholas II.\n\nMr Putin said that however old Thailand and Russia might be, they were dynamically developing countries and that stability and security everywhere from Europe to the Pacific were not only indispensable for domestic achievements but also globally significant."
