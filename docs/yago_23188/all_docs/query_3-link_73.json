        "text": "The Chakri dynasty (Thai: ราชวงศ์จักรี, RTGS: Ratchawong Chakkri, pronounced [râːt.t͡ɕʰā.wōŋ t͡ɕàk.krīː], listen (help·info)) is the current reigning dynasty of the Kingdom of Thailand, the head of the house is the king, who is head of state. The family has ruled Thailand since the founding of the Rattanakosin Era and the city of Bangkok in 1782; following the end of Taksin Thonburi's reign, when the capital of Siam shifted to Bangkok. The royal house was founded by Rama I, an Ayutthaya military leader of Sino-Mon descent.\n\nPrior to his accession to the throne, Rama I held for years the title Chakri, the civil chancellor. In founding the dynasty, the king himself chose \"Chakri\" as the name for it. The emblem of the house is composed of the discus (Chakra) and the trident (Trisula), the celestial weapons of gods Vishnu and Shiva, of whom the Thai sovereign is seen as an incarnation.\n\nThe current head of the house is Maha Vajiralongkorn who was proclaimed king on 1 December 2016, but has reigned with retroactive effect since 13 October 2016 after the death of his father Bhumibol Adulyadej. The house's current seat is the Grand Palace. On Saturday, 4 May 2019, the coronation of Vajiralongkorn, with the traditional ceremony, occurred in Bangkok. Sadly Vajiralongkorn has a bad reputation and due to this, Crown Prince Juthavachara Mahidol is now campaigning to oust his father from the throne of Thailand and become the new King, and this resulted in the royal throne of Thailand being disputed between Vajiralongkorn and Juthavachara.\n\nBranches[]\n\nHouse of Mahidol (Main Branch)[]\n\nMahidol Adulyadej (1892-1929), married Sangwan
