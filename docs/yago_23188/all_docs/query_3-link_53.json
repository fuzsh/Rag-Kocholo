        "text": "This article attempts to illuminate Duncan McCargo's influential yet ambiguous concept of ‘network monarchy’ — the source of political power wielded by Thailand's royalist establishment. Drawing on Thai-language primary sources, especially cremation volumes, I argue, first, that many individuals who have made up various institutional components of the network monarchy come from a constellation of traditional royalist families that have intermarried with each other. Contrary to what McCargo suggests, these people are not just bound by their devotion to the monarchy alone, but also by their families’ pervasive intermarriage ties forged over many decades. These ties have given the network monarchy additional resilience, even though not all its members toe the ideological line all the time. My second argument concerns the temporal context in which the network monarchy has come into being. Although McCargo makes it seem that the late King Bhumibol developed the network monarchy — his personal patronage network — as a political tool from scratch in the post-1973 period, it has actually grown, in part, out of the pre-existing elite family networks. I develop these twin arguments by using the case of one royalist prime minister — Anand Panyarachun — as a focal point of analysis.\n\n8 There might be disagreements about the scope of network monarchy, which McCargo has left vague. According to one interpretation, network monarchy refers to a small, exclusionary cabal consisting of the king and his top aides, who were regularly granted an audience with him. Most observers of Thailand including myself, however, view network monarchy as a much larger, if loosely organised, pyramid of royalists, extending downward from the king to the Privy Council and then to various other institutions and individuals at lower rungs. As in other patron–client networks, some of the people involved may not have met each other or their supreme patron (the king) in person, but it does not mean that they do not belong to the same network.\n\n200 The Amatayakuls and Emasiris, in fact, are descended from the same ancestor: Bunkert, who served the court during the late Ayutthaya period, and was awarded a phraya title in the Bangkok period.

Sala's father Siri, a Ministry of Justice official with a phraya title, had the Emasiris family name bestowed in 1913. Thep, นามสกุลพระราชทาน, pp. 65, 73."
