        "text": "Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn announced he has married his consort, General Suthida Vajiralongkorn, and named her Queen Suthida.\n\nThe announcement, carried in the Royal Gazette, came just before the official coronation of the 66-year-old king which will take place on Saturday, May 4.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn, also known by the title King Rama X, became constitutional monarch after the death of his revered father King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in October 2016, after 70 years on the throne.\n\nIn 2014, King Maha Vajiralongkorn appointed Suthida Tidjai, as a deputy commander of his bodyguard unit.\n\nThere has been little official information about her, but she is reported to be 40 years old and to have previously worked as a flight attendant for Thai Airways International.\n\nSome royal observers and foreign media have linked Queen Suthida romantically with the king, but the palace had never previously acknowledged a relationship between them.\n\nThe king made Queen Suthida a full general in December 2016, and the deputy commander of the king's personal guard in 2017.\n\nHe also made her a Thanpuying, a royal title meaning Lady.\n\nThai television, which broadcast the royal order Wednesday evening, showed a video of Queen Suthida prostrating herself before the king.\n\nAccording to the announcer, she presented a tray of flowers and joss sticks, and in return was bestowed traditional gifts associated with royal power.\n\nIt also showed the king in a white uniform and his bride in a pink silk traditional dress formally registering their marriage at his palace residence in the capital of Bangkok.\n\nThe king's sister, Princess Sirindhorn, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and other senior officials were also in attendance.\n\nKing Maha Vajiralongkorn is the only son of the late King Bhumibol and was previously married three times.\n\nWhile the king took the throne after the death of his father, his formal coronation follows a mourning period for King Bhumibol, whose royal cremation was held a year after his death."
