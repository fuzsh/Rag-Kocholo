        "text": "Compared to the various scandals and intrigues in the English royal family, the palace drama that has been going on for decades in the Thai royal family may seem much more exciting, and the initiator of all these events was Queen Sirikit.\n\nFor example, one of the most notorious scandals is related to the fact that the wife of the Thai emperor (in fact) openly cheated on her husband, King Bhumibol Adulyadej with a royal bodyguard.\n\nBut do you know what the king did when he learned about his wife’s betrayal?\n\nA Brief History of Bhumibol's Ascension to the Throne\n\nKing Bhumibol\n\nOn June 9, 1946, the eighth king of Thailand, Rama VIII, aka Ananda Mahidon, was assassinated in the palace. The death of the eighth Thai king remains a mystery to this day, and the main suspect in this incident was Ananda's brother, who succeeded him, Rama IX, aka Bhumibol Adulyadej.\n\nSuddenly on the throne, 18-year-old Bhumibol faces not only suspicion from all sides, but also how to find a way to survive the power struggle between the Thai government and the royal family.\n\nAlthough Bhumibol ascended the throne, he was not officially crowned. His uncle Prince Rangsit was appointed regent, and Bhumibol himself returned to Switzerland, where he continued his university studies until 1951.\n\nIn October 1948, Bhumibol was involved in a serious car accident on the Geneva-Lausanne highway. He injured his spine, leaving half of his face paralyzed and his right eye unable to see.\n\nThe king had an artificial eye installed, and from then on he always wore glasses.\n\nMeeting his future wife Sirikit\n\nKing Bhumibol and Sirikit in his youth\n\nThe two most important things for any man in this life are to have a good career and marry a good woman. But the king did not need a career. Therefore, at the French airport, when Bhumibol first saw Sirikit, the daughter of the Thai ambassador to France, greeting him with her father, the bright and sweet girl immediately won the heart of the young king.\n\nSoon a whirlwind romance broke out between the couple. Because of the young girl's common interests and charm, Bhumibol was confident that he had found the one with whom he was ready to spend the rest of his days.\n\nIn 1950, Bhumibol even swore an oath to Sirikit to love her alone for the rest of his life and never marry a concubine.\n\nAt that time, Sirikit was only twenty years old, but she became the wife and right hand of Bhumibol, thanks to her good education received from childhood, her command of English and other foreign languages, she quickly showed talent in diplomatic activities, because of her family in the government and helped the king to gain all real power over the Thai army and government.\n\nKing Bhumibol and Sirikit in adulthood\n\nBut of course, such a rapidly developing relationship began to cool a few years after marriage. King Bhumibol devoted himself to political activities and governing the country, and Sirikit felt that her husband did not pay enough attention to her.\n\nSo she found a replacement for her husband.\n\nThis man turned out to be Bhumibol's chief bodyguard named Nalund, who was responsible for all the king's security.\n\nBodyguard Nalund\n\nThe Queen, after talking with her bodyguard Nalund, learned that she loves photography and composing music. Such unusual hobbies for a bodyguard interested her very much, since she herself loved music.\n\nAfter several meetings, the queen openly seduced the bodyguard.\n\nSince he was the head of the security service, this bodyguard knew very well when King Bhumibol was at home and when he was busy with government affairs or attending important meetings and various meetings. Therefore, on certain days, Nalund gave orders for bodyguards to attend these meetings along with the king, while he himself was engaged in the personal “security” of Queen Sirikit.\n\nTaking photographs in public places, Sirikit began to take a bodyguard with her everywhere, and also forced her husband to assign this bodyguard personally to her.\n\nMoreover, Sirikit soon decided that she was not doing anything wrong and theyWith their guard Nalund, they stopped hiding their affair and openly held hands in public, not paying any attention to those around them.\n\nQueen Sirikit with bodyguard\n\nThis went on for a long time, because the public did not dare to make random guesses about the drama between the queen and her bodyguard. However, certain rumors began to appear.\n\nBut in 1985, King Bhumibol learned about his wife’s infidelity and, when asked directly, heard an honest answer that she was making love with another man and did not see any problem in this, but had the right to it, since her husband had stopped paying his attention to her.\n\nWhat did King Bhumibol do when he learned about his wife's betrayal?\n\nUpon learning that the secret had been revealed to the king, the bodyguard panicked, came to bow to Bhumibol and fell to his knees to beg for forgiveness.\n\nHowever, soon after this, Nalund's bodyguard was found dead. The bodyguard's official cause of death was a sudden heart attack.\n\nThe next time Queen Sirikit saw the bodyguard again, he was already dead. Seeing his body, Sirikit lost consciousness several times and began to sob.\n\nWhatever the truth, in the queen's thoughts, her husband Bhumibol was the killer of her new lover, and that same eternal love between the king and queen, which lasted almost 30 years, turned into mutual hatred.\n\nSirikit later asked members of the royal family to attend the bodyguard's funeral, ignored all rules of conduct (and decency) and personally said goodbye to Nalund while her husband Bhumibol looked on indifferently.\n\nSirikit at the funeral of bodyguard Nalunda\n\nAfter the death of the bodyguard, Queen Sirikit began to live an even more depraved life and began to bring a huge number of different men to her palace.\n\nBut the king did not tolerate such humiliation.\n\nBhumibol publicly stated that the queen needed to be “cured” and forcibly sent her to the clinic, which undoubtedly became a public humiliation for her and confirmation of all those unpleasant rumors.\n\nSince then, the queen, who once had respect and prestige, has lost all her love and reputation in Thailand.\n\nAfter several months in the hospital, an exhausted Sirikit gained a lot of excess weight, returned to the palace and knelt before Bhumibol with flowers in her hands and begging for his forgiveness.\n\nThe king accepted his wife's apology and allowed her to take part in various events because he did not want a divorce, but tried to preserve the dignity of the royal family. Since then, the relationship between King Bhumibol and his wife Sirikit has been very tense, with the king publicly proving his authority by reining in his wife's reckless and shameful behavior."
