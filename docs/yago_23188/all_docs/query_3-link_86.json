        "text": "Thailand’s Princess Chulabhorn has been admitted to a hospital in Thailand’s capital of Bangkok.\n\nThe 61-year-old Princess entered the Ramathibodi University Hospital on Monday according to a press release sent out by the Royal Household Bureau. Princess Chulabhorn was suffering from back pain and blurriness in both eyes. She will receive treatment for both conditions.\n\nExaminations were conducted, and Thai doctors determined further extensive tests were required to determine the course of treatment for Her Royal Highness.\n\nAs a result, the Princess’s public engagements are cancelled for the foreseeable future.\n\nHer Royal Highness also has an auto-immune disease, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), that was revealed in 2014. At the same time, the royal was also dealing with pancreatitis. She has had other health issues over the past several years, as well, including problems with inflammation and low oxygen.\n\nPrincess Chulabhorn, who has required assistance in walking lately, is the youngest child of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej (or Rama IX) and Queen Sirikit. She is the sister to Thailand’s reigning monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun (or Rama X). Besides her older brother, the King, she has two older sisters, Princesses Ubolratana and Sirindhorn.\n\nThe Princess was previously married to Virayudh Tishyasarin with whom she had two daughters, Princesses Ribha and Dita.\n\nShe is not the only Thai royal to enter the hospital this week. On Saturday, the Royal Household Bureau announced Princess Soamsawali had suffered a brain haemorrhage and had high blood pressure which resulted in treatment at Chulalongkorn Hospital. Further details of her prognosis were not released.\n\nPrincess Soamsawali is the eldest child of Mom Rajawongse Adulyakit Kitiyakara (the elder brother of Queen Sirikit) and Princess Bandhu Savali Yugala. On 3 January 1977, she married her first cousin, the current King and became known as Her Royal Highness Princess Soamsawali, Royal Consort of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand. They later divorced, but she still performs royal duties on behalf of His Majesty."
