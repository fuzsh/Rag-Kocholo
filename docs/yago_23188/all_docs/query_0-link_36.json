        "text": "(1927–2016). Thailand’s longest-serving monarch was King Bhumibol Adulyadej (or Rama IX), whose reign lasted from 1946 until his death in 2016. He was the ninth king of the Chakkri dynasty, Thailand’s ruling house from 1782.\n\nBhumibol was born on December 5, 1927, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. At that time his father, Prince Mahidol of Songkhla, was a student at Harvard University. A grandson of King Chulalongkorn, Bhumibol succeeded to the throne after his older brother, King Ananda Mahidol, was found dead in his bed of a gunshot wound on June 9, 1946. (The circumstances of Ananda’s death were never explained.) Bhumibol married a distant cousin, Sirikit Kitiyakara, in April 1950 and was formally crowned on May 5 of that year.\n\nAs a constitutional monarch, Bhumibol functioned as the ceremonial head of state, but his influence was enormous. During his 70-year reign, he enjoyed near-universal public support. His immense popularity allowed him on several occasions to play a crucial role in mediations that either resolved or helped to avoid a political crisis. One of those instances came in 1973, when the military violently suppressed a student-led uprising, and Bhumibol was able to persuade the leaders of the military junta to go into exile. In 1992 Bhumibol again intervened after a military junta led by Suchinda Kraprayoon had overthrown the Thai government and mass protests once again were brutally suppressed. The king summoned Suchinda and opposition leader Chamlong Srimuang to a meeting, after which Suchinda resigned and a caretaker government was appointed.\n\nIn May 2006 United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan presented the UN’s first Human Development Lifetime Achievement Award to Bhumibol. The following month national celebrations were held in Thailand to mark the 60th anniversary of Bhumibol’s ascension to the throne.\n\nIn September 2006 Bhumibol faced a new crisis after opposition parties boycotted elections called by the prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. The Constitutional Court invalidated the results, and on September 19, before new elections could be held, the Thai military engineered a coup while Thaksin was out of the country. It was widely assumed that Thaksin had fallen out of favor with Bhumibol, who quickly endorsed the coup leader and gave royal assent to an interim prime minister’s cabinet. In May 2014 Bhumibol also endorsed the military government that took power after the ouster of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin’s younger sister.\n\nBhumibol died on October 13, 2016, in Bangkok, Thailand. The designated heir to the throne was his only son, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn."
