During his tenure in Orange County, Mines helped the club to the 2021 USLC title, scoring three goals in 11 matches.\n\nHe joined Miami prior to the 2023 season and saw action in 26 matches, making seven starts.\n\nOriginally signed by New York Red Bulls II on a USL Academy Contract in 2016, Mines played in 48 matches (18 starts) and tallied two goals and three assists across five seasons of USL and USL Championship action.\n\nMines signed as a Homegrown Player for the Red Bulls (MLS) in 2018 and made six appearances with the side, scoring two goals and adding one assist.\n\nTyler Gibson | #22\n\nPosition: MF\n\nHeight: 5’8”\n\nWeight: 151 lbs.\n\nDOB: 12/01/1991\n\nBirthplace: Knoxville, Tennessee\n\nAcquired: 01/29/2024\n\nPrevious club: Louisville City FC (USL Championship)\n\nPronunciation\n\nIndy Eleven announced that midfielder Tyler Gibson is returning to the Boys in Blue lineup for the 2024 USL Championship season.\n\nGibson has played in nearly 12,000 minutes of USL action across six seasons, also spending time with FC Cincinnati (2018) and Louisville City FC (2021-23).\n\nIn two seasons (2019-20) with Indy Eleven, Gibson started all 53 matches played, including 37 during the Boys in Blue’s 2019 season that saw the club win 19 regular-season games and reach the USL Championship Eastern Conference Final. Gibson played in 3,353 minutes of a possible 3,360 of action in 2019 and registered a goal and an assist.\n\nNo stranger to USL playoff action during his time with Louisville City FC, Gibson played in 87 matches with 70 starts, helping the club to the USL Championship Final in 2022 and USL Conference Finals in 2021 and 2023.\n\nIn his one season with FC Cincinnati, the franchise won the USL regular season and made an appearance in the conference semifinals.\n\nPrior to his time in the USL, Gibson played three seasons in the NASL with San Antonio (2015), Rayo OKC (2016) and SF Deltas (2017). San Francisco won the 2017 NASL Championship, the final year for the league.\n\nAodhan Quinn | #14\n\nPosition: MF\n\nHeight: 6’1″\n\nWeight: 170 lbs.\n\nDOB: 03/22/1992\n\nBirthplace: San Diego, Calif.\n\nNationality: USA\n\nAcquired: via Transfer from Phoenix Rising FC on 01/19/2023\n\nPrevious club: Phoenix Rising FC (USLC)\n\nPronunciation\n\n2023: Saw action in 28 games, starting 28 of them… 2nd in goals for the team with 9… Assisted on 2 goals… Scored 2 goals in a match in 2 different games… Joined the USL Championship 50G/50A club against Miami on 8.12.23… Became the second player in league history to surpass 20,000 regular season minutes against Tampa Bay on 7.22.23.\n\nIndy Eleven continued to make over its midfield in impressive fashion in mid-January with its transfer acquisition of veteran playmaker Aodhan Quinn from Phoenix Rising FC.\n\nQuinn is quite simply one of the most productive players in USL Championship history, as he enters his tenth season on the circuit ranked on or near the league’s top ten career charts with 48 assists (3rd); 210 starts (3rd); 223 games played (11th); and 18,416 minutes played (4th) to go along with an impressive 45 goals (26th). When combined with his goal and four assists tallied during 11 USL Championship Playoffs appearances spread across six postseasons, Quinn’s resulting 51 overall assists place second in league annals, while his 220 starts (3rd); 19,415 minutes played (4th), and 234 games played (11th) also rank among the best in league history.\n\nThe 30-year-old native of San Diego has accrued those stats across stints with some of the league’s top performing sides, including Orlando City SC (2014), Louisville City FC (2015-16), FC Cincinnati (2017), Orange County SC (2018-20), and Phoenix Rising FC (2021-22). Following a standout three seasons with the University of Akron Zips from 2011-13, Quinn was selected in the 2014 MLS SuperDraft by the Philadelphia Union, but ultimately began his professional career by signing with the then USL-outfit Orlando City.\n\nQuinn joins the Boys in Blue on the heels of two solid seasons with Phoenix, where he contributed 15 goals, 18 assists, and a league-best 167 key passes while playing in 62 contests (31 each season). He landed his second USL Championship First Team selection of his career following a 2021 campaign that saw him notch six goals, 11 assists, and 84 key passes – with the latter two figures ranking second across the league. Quinn crossed paths with his new Eleven teammate Solomon Asante that season, and the\n\nQuinn’s initial USL First Team accolade followed his first campaign with Orange County in 2018, when he again finished second in the league with 15 assists to go along with 12 goals and a league-high 103 chances created, figures that also landed him on the three-person shortlist for that season’s USL Championship Most Valuable Player award.\n\nThe durable midfielder has crossed the 2,500 minutes played mark in five of the last six full USL Championship seasons – which does not include the 2020 campaign that saw Quinn play all 1,440 minutes of Orange County’s COVID shortened schedule.\n\nThey Said It …\n\nQuinn Upon Joining the Boys in Blue:\n\n“I am ecstatic to be joining Indy Eleven and am ready to play in front of all the fans, especially the Brickyard Battalion. The club has made great signings this year while bringing back key players from last year. I’m excited to work with Coach [Mark] Lowry and his staff, and believe this club has everything it needs to be successful.”\n\nJack Blake | #8\n\nPosition: MF\n\nHeight: 5’11″\n\nWeight: 172 lbs.\n\nDOB: 09/22/1994\n\nBirthplace: Nottingham, England\n\nNationality: England/Scotland\n\nAcquired: signed on 01/06/2023\n\nPrevious club: San Diego Loyal SC (USLC)\n\nPronunciation\n\n2023: Saw action in 30 matches, starting 28 of them… Scored 3 goals… Contributed 34 shots with 17 shots on target… Assisted on 1 goal against Monterey Bay on 4.22.23… Tallied 7 shots against Tulsa on 7.8.23.\n\nIndy Eleven made a big impression with its first new signing of the 2023 calendar year in veteran midfielder Jack Blake on January 6.\n\nThe 28-year-old native of Nottingham, England, joins Indiana’s Team after contributing 22 goals and 17 assists across 117 combined regular season and playoff appearances in five seasons of USL Championship action since 2018. Blake spent the past two seasons with San Diego Loyal SC, scoring eight goals and adding 10 assists – including a career-high six helpers in 2022 – in 52 appearances for then-Head Coach Landon Donovan’s side.\n\nAfter joining the ranks of the Championship with the Tampa Bay Rowdies leading up to the 2018 season, that June Blake went on loan to Real Monarchs SLC in a move that jumpstarted his status as a full-time starter in the league. His two-and-a-half year stay with Real included a standout 11-goal campaign in 2019 that also featured three tallies in postseason play and an equalizing assist in the Monarchs’ 3-1 victory at Louisville City FC in the USL Championship Final.\n\nPrior to his time in the Championship, Blake spent two seasons acclimating to soccer stateside – including getting a glimpse of Indy Eleven – in the North American Soccer League, starting with an 11-game stint with Minnesota United in 2016. Blake headed south for the 2017 season with Jacksonville Armada FC, where he bagged nine goals and added three assists in 27 games under the guidance of Lowry on the sideline.\n\nBlake was reared in the youth development systems of Notts County and Nottingham Forest before joining the Academy set-up of the latter. He made his professional debut whilst on loan to League Two side Mansfield Town in late 2013, which fell in between stints with Forest’s reserve side from 2013-15. Through his grandfather’s lineage Blake was eligible to represent Scotland in international play, and he earned five “caps” with the country’s Under-19 side from 2011-12.\n\nThey Said It …\n\nBlake Upon Signing with the Boys in Blue:\n\n“I am very excited for a new adventure and chapter in my career.
