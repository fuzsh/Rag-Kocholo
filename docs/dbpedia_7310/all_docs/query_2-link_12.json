        "text": "Clark Cup Championships\n\n2012 CLARK CUP CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nDerek Lalonde in his first season behind the bench led the Green Bay Gamblers to a 47-9-4 record (98 points) . The 47 wins are the most in team history as well as for a first-year USHL head coach. The 98 points established a new USHL record, breaking the mark of 97 points recorded by the Des Moines Buccaneers during the 1998-99 season. The Gamblers earned their third Anderson Cup over the past four seasons.\n\nDuring the second to last game of the regular season, Green Bay’s 7-1 victory over the Youngstown Phantoms set a USHL record for road wins in a season (25). The Gamblers never lost consecutive games during the regular season and set a Tier 1 record with just 9 losses. The team led the USHL in offense (250 goals) and gave up the fewest goals (138). The goal differential of +112 was the largest in the USHL Tier 1 era (2002-present). The second best goal differential was Lincoln at +52.\n\nThird-year goaltender Ryan McKay posted career bests in wins (27), losses (5) and goals-against-average (2.18). McKay was named USHL Goaltender of the Year and finished his career as the Gamblers all-time leader in victories (66), GAA (2.11), and SV% (.921).\n\nAndy Welinski, a 2011 NHL Draft selection of the Anaheim Ducks, was named 2011-12 USHL Defenseman of the Year and garnered All-USHL First Team honors. Alex Broadhurst, a 2011 NHL Draft pick of the Chicago Blackhawks, also earned a spot on the All-USHL First team. Broadhurst finished third overall in USHL scoring with 73 points (26g, 47a) and led the team in playoff scoring with 16 points (8g, 8a) in 12 postseason contests. Finishing the trio of All-USHL first teamers, was defenseman Jordan Schmaltz. The Verona, Wisconsin product finished tied for second among USHL defensemen in scoring with 41 points (10g, 31a) in 55 regular season games. Schmaltz was selected 25th overall by the St. Louis Blues in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nThe Gamblers as a team combined for a +434 rating. Eleven Gamblers were a +20 or better.\n\nThe Green Bay Gamblers captured the franchise’s 4th Clark Cup Championship with a 5-2 win over the Waterloo Black Hawks in Game 5 of the Clark Cup Finals. The decisive game was played at the Resch Center in front of 7,007. The Clark Cup was the team’s second in three years."
