Founded in 2009 as the Missouri Mavericks of the CHL, the team plays in Independence, Missouri, a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri, at the Cable Dahmer Arena.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOn April 16, 2009, the Central Hockey League announced an expansion team for Independence, to begin play in the 2009–10 season.[4] The new organization teamed up with local newspaper The Examiner to hold a name-the-team contest until May 11. The Missouri Mavericks' name, logo, and colors were unveiled on June 24.[5] On May 29, 2009, it was reported that Scott Hillman would be the Mavericks' first head coach, resigning from his same position with the Southern Professional Hockey League's Knoxville Ice Bears to do so. In his time with the Ice Bears, Hillman led them to two consecutive SPHL President's Cup championships and Coffey Trophies (awarded for the most regular-season points).[6][7] On November 13, 2009, the team played their home opener before a crowd of 5,760 people at the Independence Events Center.[8]\n\nOn September 17, 2011, the Mavericks announced an affiliation agreement with the Chicago Wolves of the American Hockey League for the 2011–12 season.[9] This agreement would be renewed in one-year contracts until 2015.[10][11][12]\n\nOn May 24, 2012, the Mavericks extended head coach Scott Hillman's contract for two additional years through the 2013–14 season.[13] On July 31, 2012, the Mavericks announced an agreement with Entercom to have all 66 games for the 2012-13 season broadcast on the radio on 1660 KUDL.[14]\n\nOn May 21, 2014, Hillman announced his resignation from the Mavericks[15][16] and soon after was named as the first head coach for the expansion Indy Fuel of the ECHL.[17] In June, the Mavericks hired Richard Matvichuk as the organization's new coach.[18]\n\nOn October 7, 2014, shortly before the 2014–15 Central Hockey League season was set to begin, it was announced that the CHL had ceased operations and the Mavericks, along with the Allen Americans, Brampton Beast, Quad City Mallards, Rapid City Rush, Tulsa Oilers and Wichita Thunder, were all approved for expansion membership application into the ECHL for the 2014-15 season.[19][20]\n\nOn February 5, 2015, Lamar Hunt Jr., son of Kansas City Chiefs' founder Lamar Hunt, bought a 100 percent ownership stake in the Missouri Mavericks.[21]\n\nOn June 11, 2015, the Mavericks announced they had signed a two-year affiliation deal with the New York Islanders. The Mavericks then served as the Islanders' secondary minor league affiliate, behind the Bridgeport Islanders of the American Hockey League.[22]\n\nOn June 2, 2016, head coach Richard Matvichuk resigned after leading the Mavericks for two seasons, a regular season championship, and named ECHL coach of the year in 2015–16. He left the organization to become the head coach of the Western Hockey League's Prince George Cougars.[23] He was replaced by John-Scott Dickson,[24] who had played for the team from 2011 to 2015 before joining the coaching staff as an assistant coach in 2015–16.[25] Also, beginning with the 2016–17 season, the Mavericks and St. Louis Blues entered into a working agreement for cross-promoting hockey in Missouri and Kansas.[26] However, the Islanders/Tigers organization still remained the Mavericks affiliate for player development.\n\nOn March 11, 2017, the Missouri Mavericks announced the team would be renamed the Kansas City Mavericks beginning in the 2017–18 season.[27] Also prior to the 2017–18 season, their affiliation with the Islanders ended when that organization affiliated with the expansion Worcester Railers. On June 8, 2017, Kansas City affiliated with the Calgary Flames (NHL) and the Stockton Heat (AHL).[28]\n\nIn his fourth season as head coach, Dickson was fired on January 30, 2020, while the team was in last place in their division.[29] After the season ended, the Mavericks hired Florida Everblades' assistant Tad O'Had as the head coach.[30]\n\nOn July 28, 2022, the Mavericks announced a new affiliation with the Seattle Kraken and Seattle's AHL affiliate, the Coachella Valley Firebirds.[31]\n\nSeason-by-season records[]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season GP W L OTL SOL Pts GF GA PIM Standing Year 1st round 2nd round 3rd round Kelly Cup 2009–10 (CHL) 64 31 27 6 — 68 200 220 1589 5th, Northern Conf. 2010[32] W, 2–1, MRK L, 0–4, RC — — 2010–11 (CHL) 66 37 23 6 — 80 213 173 1197 4th, Turner Conf. 2011[33] W, 3–2, WIC L, 1–3, COL — — 2011–12 (CHL) 66 39 21 6 — 84 223 200 1048 3rd, Turner Conf. 2012[34] — W, 4–0, EVN L, 3–4, FW — 2012–13 (CHL) 66 35 25 6 — 76 217 222 991 5th, CHL 2013[35] — W, 4–2, RC L, 3–4, ALN — 2013–14 (CHL) 66 44 20 2 — 90 238 184 1012 1st, CHL 2014[36] — L, 2–4, ARZ — — 2014–15 (ECHL) 72 28 35 5 4 65 192 231 1426 6th, Central Div. 2015[37] did not qualify 2015–16 (ECHL) 72 52 15 3 2 109 234 162 855 1st, Central Div. 2016 W, 4–0, QC L, 2–4, ALN — — 2016–17 (ECHL) 72 33 30 4 5 75 233 241 1040 5th, Mountain Div. 2017 did not qualify 2017–18 (ECHL) 72 34 32 4 2 74 204 223 904 6th, Central Div. 2018 did not qualify 2018–19 (ECHL) 72 36 30 4 2 78 234 228 993 4th, Mountain Div. 2019 L, 3–4, TUL — — — 2019–20 (ECHL) 61 24 32 4 1 53 167 217 721 7th, Mountain Div. 2020 Season cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic 2020–21 (ECHL) 72 31 31 8 2 72 205 226 806 6th, Western Conf. 2021 did not qualify 2021–22 (ECHL) 72 32 33 5 2 71 210 243 1482 6th, Mountain Div. 2022 did not qualify 2022–23 (ECHL) 72 34 30 6 2 76 222 224 939 3rd, Mountain Div. 2023 L, 2–4, ALN — — — 2023-24 (ECHL) 72 54 12 4 2 114 305 202 688 1st, Mountain Div. 2024 W, 4–0, TUL W, 4–1, IDH W, 4–2, TOL L, 1-4, - FLA CHL totals 328 186 116 26 — 398 1091 999 5837 ECHL totals 709 358 280 47 24 787 2206 2197 9854\n\nPlayers and personnel[]\n\nCurrent roster[]\n\nAs of February 20, 2024.[38][39]\n\n# Nat Player Pos S/G Age Acquired Birthplace Contract 44 Russia Andreev, MaxMax Andreev 3.0 F L 25 2023 Moscow, Russia Firebirds 28 United States Borchardt, CadeCade Borchardt 3.0 F R 26 2023 Burnsville, Minnesota Mavericks 26 United States Brandt, JaredJared Brandt 2.0 D L 28 2023 St. Louis, Missouri Mavericks 7 United States Calvas, TheoTheo Calvas 2.0 D R 26 2021 Southfield, Michigan Mavericks 22 United States Carreau, CaseyCasey Carreau 3.0 F R 26 2023 Acushnet, Massachusetts Mavericks 49 United States Coskey, ColeCole Coskey 7.0 RW R 25 2022 Zion, Illinois Mavericks 13 United States Cotton, DavidDavid Cotton 4.0 C L 26 2023 Parker, Texas Mavericks 17 United States Curry, PatrickPatrick Curry 3.0 F L 28 2023 Schaumburg, Illinois Firebirds 25 United States Devine, RyanRyan Devine 2.0 D L 32 2023 Wayne, Pennsylvania Mavericks 24 Canada Duquette, Marc-OlivierMarc-Olivier Duquette 2.0 D L 26 2023 Chateauguay, Quebec Mavericks 21 United States Hampton, BobbyBobby Hampton 4.0 C R 26 2023 Middletown, New Jersey Mavericks 14 Canada Hayhurst, JacobJacob Hayhurst 4.0 C L 27 2023 Mississauga, Ontario Firebirds 8 Canada Jackson, KyleKyle Jackson 6.0 LW L 21 2023 Ottawa, Ontario Firebirds 15 United States Jaremko, JakeJake Jaremko 4.0 C L 27 2022 Nowthen, Minnesota Mavericks 6 Sweden Karlsson, JoshuaJoshua Karlsson 2.0 D L 23 2024 Stockholm, Sweden Mavericks 60 United States Kelley, DillonDillon Kelley 1.0 G L 29 2022 Petoskey, Michigan Mavericks 1 Canada LaFontaine, JackJack LaFontaine 1.0 G L 26 2023 Mississauga, Ontario Firebirds 12 Canada McKenna, JeremyJeremy McKenna 7.0 RW R 25 2022 Canmore, Alberta Firebirds 27 United States McLaughlin, JakeJake McLaughlin 2.0 D L 28 2022 Hinsdale, Illinois Firebirds 33 United States Morris, CaleCale Morris 1.0 G L 28 2023 Larkspur, Colorado Mavericks 32 Canada Nachbaur, JustinJustin Nachbaur 6.0 LW L 24 2023 Cross Lake, Manitoba Firebirds 29 Canada Robertson, TuckerTucker Robertson 4.0 C R 21 2024 Toronto, Ontario Kraken 10 Canada Schoonbaert, BradBrad Schoonbaert 3.0 F L 26 2023 Brandon, Manitoba Mavericks 20 United States Walker, NolanNolan Walker 4.0 C R 25 2023 Anchorage, Alaska Mavericks\n\nTeam captains[]\n\nNotable alumni[]\n\nKyle Burroughs\n\nVille Husso\n\nRoss Johnston\n\nMaxime Lagace\n\nJed Ortmeyer\n\nCarter Verhaeghe\n\nPrevious Logos[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial Website\n\nKansas City Mavericks Page on Eurohockey.com\n\nMissouri Mavericks Page on EliteProspects.com\n\nMissouri Mavericks Page on HockeyDB.com\n\nPreceded by\n\nToledo Walleye Brabham Cup\n\nChampions\n\n2015–16 Succeeded by\n\nToledo Walleye"
