        "text": "Based in St. Louis, Missouri, the Blues are a professional ice hockey team that plays in the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). They have appeared in four Stanley Cup finals (1968–70 and 2019) and have won one championship (2019).\n\nThe Blues joined the NHL during the 1967–68 season as one of the six teams added to the league when it expanded from the so-called “Original Six” franchises. They were named for musician W.C. Handy’s classic composition “St. Louis Blues.” Led by head coach Scotty Bowman and featuring defenseman Barclay Plager, the Blues advanced to the Stanley Cup finals in their first season but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens. The Blues won the NHL West Division—composed of the six expansion franchises—in each of the following two seasons as well, only to be swept by the winner of the East Division in the Stanley Cup finals (Montreal again in 1969, the Boston Bruins in 1970). The Blues were much less successful during the 1970s. Between 1970–71 and 1979–80, St. Louis posted just two winning records and advanced past the opening play-off round only once.\n\nIn 1980–81 the Blues, behind the play of left wing Brian Sutter and center Bernie Federko, won 45 games—the best record in team history up to that point—and captured a division title. Their play-off struggles continued, however, as they were eliminated in the second round of the postseason. The Blues finished with a losing record six times over the following eight seasons but still qualified for the play-offs each year. During the 1987–88 season St. Louis acquired future star right wing Brett Hull. He would go on to score the most goals in franchise history over the course of his 10 full seasons with the Blues—and eventually follow his father, Bobby Hull, into the Hall of Fame—but he led the team no further than the second round of the play-offs.\n\nIn 1999–2000 the Blues posted the best record in the NHL behind the play of right wing Pavol Demitra and defensemen Chris Pronger and Al MacInnis, but St. Louis was upset in the first round of the play-offs by the San Jose Sharks. In the following season the Blues advanced to the conference finals, which they lost to the eventual champion Colorado Avalanche. St. Louis continued to qualify for the postseason through the 2003–04 season, which brought the team’s run of consecutive play-off appearances to 25 seasons—the third longest such streak in league history at the time. Over that period, however, the Blues failed to reach the Stanley Cup finals and only advanced past the second play-off series twice.\n\nIn the six seasons following the end of the streak, the Blues earned just one play-off berth—a first-round loss in 2008–09. The struggling team brought in head coach Ken Hitchcock early in the 2011–12 season. The Blues rallied behind his leadership, winning 49 games and capturing the franchise’s first division title in 11 years. However, St. Louis continued to falter in the play-offs, losing in the second round that year and in the first round in each of the next three seasons.\n\nIn 2015–16 St. Louis advanced to its first conference final in 14 years, but the Blues were eliminated by the San Jose Sharks. St. Louis staged a dramatic turnaround during the 2018–19 season, rising from last place in the Central Division in January to end the regular season with a second-place divisional finish. Led by interim head coach Craig Berube and a stellar defense, the Blues then advanced through the play-offs to reach the Stanley Cup finals for the first time in 49 years. St. Louis defeated the Boston Bruins in a seven-game series to claim the first championship in franchise history."
