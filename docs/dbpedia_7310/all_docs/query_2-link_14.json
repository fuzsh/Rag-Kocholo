        "text": "An incredible season for the St. Louis Blues came to a disappointing end over the weekend.\n\nSince Ken Hitchcock took over as the Blues head coach on November 6, the Blues were one of the NHL’s best teams. St. Louis led the league in goals against average, thanks to stellar net play from both Brian Elliott and Jaroslav Halak. For much of the season, the Blues were in contention for the Presidents’ Trophy, awarded to the team with the best record.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular season with the best home record in the NHL, but stumbled into the playoffs. The team was never able to recapture that home magic in the postseason, losing three of five at Scottrade Center. Although the second-seeded Blues got by the San Jose Sharks in the first round, the team was eliminated by the Los Angeles Kings, who completed a four-game sweep on Sunday.\n\nThe Kings, led by Vezina Trophy finalist Jonathan Quick, had lost three of the team's final four games of the regular season—two in shootouts and one in overtime—and were lucky to even get into the playoffs. But once in, Quick was an impenetrable wall. His 1.55 goals against average in the postseason is a big reason that L.A. was able to knock off top-seeded Vancouver in five games, before the first playoff sweep in franchise history. Although the Kings are in the Western Conference finals for the first time since 1993, this is the team's third straight trip to the postseason.\n\nThe Blues, green with playoff experience, showed their youth in the postseason. The team was completely outplayed by the Kings, who are growing in confidence and appear to be on their way to the Stanley Cup Finals."
