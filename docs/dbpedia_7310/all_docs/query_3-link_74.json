With Christmas right around the corner, it'll be a light weekend for the team, as there is just one game on the schedule.\n\nThe full Blues schedule is here, while their weekend schedule begins and ends in Phoenix.\n\nDec. 23: at Phoenix Coyotes (8:00 p.m. CT, Fox Sports Midwest)\n\nPhoenix enters Friday night's game in a three-way tie for first in the Pacific, and they'll be looking to extend their current winning streak to three games. The Coyotes have been pretty good defensively this year -- they're 10th in the NHL in goals against average -- but their offense has been middling."
