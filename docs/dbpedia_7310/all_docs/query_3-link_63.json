        "text": "July 14, 2010\n\nNotre Dame, Ind. – University of Notre Dame hockey coach Jeff Jackson today announced the 2010-11 Notre Dame hockey schedule. The 37-game schedule opens on Sunday, Oct. 3 with a preseason tilt versus the University of Guelph at the Joyce Center Ice Rink. The regular season starts on Fri., Oct. 8 in St. Louis, Mo., versus Holy Cross in the Ice Breaker Tournament at the Scottrade Center.\n\nThe Irish open the final home regular-season schedule at the Joyce Center Ice Rink on Thur., Oct. 14 with the start of a CCHA weekend series versus the Lake Superior State Lakers with game two set for Fri., Oct. 15.\n\nThe schedule features teams from five conferences – Holy Cross and Canisius (Atlantic Hockey), Boston College and Boston University (Hockey East), Brown (ECAC), Wisconsin, North Dakota and Minnesota State (WCHA) along with 28 CCHA regular-season games.\n\nIn making the schedule announcement, Jackson said, “We look forward to a very challenging slate of non-conference and CCHA games in 2010-11, our last full season in the Joyce Center. The Irish intend to leave the north dome on a good note, as it has been our home, a place that we’ve taken great pride in for many years and have had a great deal of success over the last five seasons.”\n\nIncluded in the 2010-11 schedule are two in-season tournament appearances – the 2010 Ice Breaker Tournament that will be held in St. Louis, Mo., at the Scottrade Center, home of the NHL’s St. Louis Blues. The tournament will open on Friday, Oct. 8 with the Irish playing Holy Cross and Boston University playing Wisconsin in the two semifinal games. After a day off, the third-place and championship games will be played on Sunday, Oct. 10.\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Irish will host the Shillelagh Tournament at the Sears Centre in Hoffman Estates, Ill., this season on Jan. 1 and 2. Notre Dame will face Minnesota State on Jan. 1 at 6:05 p.m. (CT) with Boston University and Brown playing in the opener at 3:05 p.m. (CT). Game times on Sunday, Jan. 2 are 2:05 p.m. (CT) and 5:05 p.m. (CT) with the Irish playing in the 5:05 p.m. contest.\n\nIncluding the preseason opener with the University of Guelph on Oct. 3, Notre Dame will play 17 home games in the final season for the Joyce Center Rink. The Irish will have non-conference home games versus Boston College (Oct. 23) and Canisius College (Dec. 29) with the remainder of the home schedule made up of CCHA conference games. Lake Superior, Western Michigan (two home-and-home weekends), Michigan State, Northern Michigan, Alaska, Miami and Bowling Green will each visit the Joyce Center for two games each during the regular season.\n\nThe Irish will play two non-conference games at WCHA power North Dakota on Nov. 26 and 27 and 14 road games versus CCHA opponents to round out the regular season. A pair of home-and-home series with Western Michigan plus two games at Bowling Green, Michigan, Miami, Northern Michigan, Ohio State and Ferris State gives Notre Dame 16 road tests for the year.\n\nWith 11 teams in the CCHA this year, the Irish will play Bowling Green, Northern Michigan, Western Michigan and Miami four times each with two games apiece versus the remaining six teams.\n\nWeeknight games (Thur.-Fri.) for Notre Dame will start at 7:35 p.m. while Saturday games have a 7:05 p.m. starting time except for the Nov. 20 game with Michigan State that has a 5:05 p.m. opening faceoff. The preseason opener on Sunday, Oct. 3 will start at 5:05 p.m., and the Sunday, Dec. 12 game with Northern Michigan will start at 4:05 p.m. All times are subject to change when television announces its schedule.\n\nThe public sale of season tickets will start in August for the final year at the Joyce Center. In 2009-10, the Irish played in front of 14 sellout crowds. Season tickets start as low as $107 for youth, are $193 for Faculty/Staff and $212 for adults and feature a 10% discount versus purchasing tickets on an individual game basis. Multi-year purchasers will have priority on seat assignments at the new Notre Dame Ice Arena when the new building opens for the 2011-12 campaign.\n\nFor all Notre Dame hockey ticket and season ticket information please contact the Notre Dame ticket office at (574) 631-7356."
