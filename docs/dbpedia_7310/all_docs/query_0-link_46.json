        "text": "Patrick Maroon (born April 23, 1988) is an American professional ice hockey left winger who plays for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). Nicknamed the “Big Rig” or more recently, “Hometown Hero”, Maroon has previously played for the Anaheim Ducks, Edmonton Oilers, New Jersey Devils, St. Louis Blues, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Minnesota Wild.\n\nGrowing up in St. Louis, Maroon attended Oakville High School where he was recruited to play in the North American Hockey League (NAHL) by Kelly Chase and Al MacInnis. Following two standout seasons with the Texarkana Bandits, he was drafted 161st overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft. He spent three years within their organization before being traded to the Anaheim Ducks and subsequently making his NHL debut in the 2011–12 season.\n\nMaroon played three seasons at the NHL level with the Ducks where he made an impact during their 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs run. Due to inconsistency, he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers and New Jersey Devils before landing in St. Louis Blues in 2018.\n\nIn his only season with the Blues, he helped them win the Stanley Cup for the first time in franchise history. He would win the Stanley Cup the next two years with the Lightning, becoming the first player since Cory Stillman in 2006 to win back-to-back Stanley Cups on different teams and the fourth player in NHL history to win the Cup three years in a row with two different teams.\n\nPat Maroon Statistics\n\nTrade Tracker\n\nDeeper Dive\n\nThe Lightning & Pat Maroon Are a Really Good Fit…For Now\n\nPat Maroon Leaves Golden Legacy with the St. Louis Blues\n\nPat Maroon Finding His Niche with Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nAll-Time Missouri-Born NHL Lineup\n\n7 Biggest NHL Players in Today’s Game\n\nPatrick Maroon Is Earning His Place in St. Louis Blues’ History\n\nOilers’ Last 5 Trade Deadlines Have Led to Mediocre Results\n\nAchievements\n\n3x Stanley Cup Champion (2019 – Blues, 2020, 2021 – Lightning)\n\nNAHL First All-Star Team (2007)\n\nNAHL Most Valuable Player (2007)\n\nNAHL Robertson Cup Champion (2007)\n\nNAHL All-Rookie First Team (2006)\n\nSources"
