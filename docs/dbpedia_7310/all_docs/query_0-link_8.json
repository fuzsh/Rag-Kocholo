The Maineiacs won the President's Cup and participated in the Memorial Cup.\n\nOn October 2, 2007, it was confirmed that David would start the season with the St. Louis Blues after an impressive training camp.\n\nDavid's progression was impressive because less than three years before playing his first NHL game, he was still playing at the Midget B level in his hometown of Fleurimont.\n\nOn November 3, 2007, David scored his first career goal against the Chicago Blackhawks. He played throughout the season and scored his first NHL hat trick on November 10, 2009 against the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, David signed a 2-year contract worth $4.3 million with the Blues.\n\nHe scored 5 goals in his first 10 games of the 2010-11 season. An injury-shortened 2011–12 NHL season saw him score 42 points in 57 games played.\n\nOn July 5, 2012, David signed a four-year, $15.25 million contract with the Blues.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, he was traded to the Edmonton Oilers on July 10, 2013 in exchange for Magnus Paajarvi and a 2014 2nd round draft pick.\n\nCareer Statistics[]"
