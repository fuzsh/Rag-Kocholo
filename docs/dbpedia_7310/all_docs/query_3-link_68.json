        "text": "NBC and VERSUS released their 2011-12 NHL regular season television schedules on Thursday, only there won't be a VERSUS as of Jan. 2, which makes for an awkward press release. (The schedules were also released for NHL Network U.S., CBC, TSN and TSN 2.)\n\nHere are the essentials from NBC:\n\nWell, that's a lot of Pierre McGuire hockey right there.\n\nBut, as in every season, there are bound to be some teams that get a wee more attention than others. With that, we bring you the winners and losers of the 2011-12 NHL schedule on NBC and VERSUS.\n\nHere are the team-by-team totals for the VERSUS/NBC Sports Network schedule next season, including NBC Flex Games, in which the VERSUS game selection for that date will depend upon the game that NBC chooses for their broadcast window. So, essential, this is all the potential appearances for the teams. In brackets are the total number of appearances last season from the initial schedule.\n\nAnaheim Ducks: 6 (1)\n\nBoston Bruins: 14 (11)\n\nBuffalo Sabres: 11 (9)\n\nCalgary Flames: 0 (1, which was the Heritage Classic)\n\nCarolina Hurricanes: 4 (4)\n\nChicago Blackhawks: 11 (11)\n\nColorado Avalanche: 9 (5)\n\nColumbus Blue Jackets: 2 (3)\n\nDallas Stars: 7 (3)\n\nDetroit Red Wings: 14 (11)\n\nEdmonton Oilers: Zero (Zero)\n\nFlorida Panthers: 1 (Zero)\n\nLos Angeles Kings: 6 (5)\n\nMinnesota Wild: 9 (9)\n\nMontreal Canadiens: 6 (6)\n\nNashville Predators: 2 (1)\n\nNew Jersey Devils: 7 (5)\n\nNew York Islanders: 1 (2)\n\nNew York Rangers: 16 (11)\n\nOttawa Senators: Zero (Zero)\n\nPhiladelphia Flyers: 11 (9)\n\nPhoenix Coyotes: 4 (5)\n\nPittsburgh Penguins: 14 (11)\n\nSan Jose Sharks: 5 (8)\n\nSt. Louis Blues: 8 (5)\n\nTampa Bay Lightning: 11 (6)\n\nToronto Maple Leafs: 2 (1)\n\nVancouver Canucks: 2 (1)\n\nWashington Capitals: 14 (11)\n\nWinnipeg Jets: 1 (1, as the Atlanta Thrashers)\n\nHere is the broadcast schedule on NBC:\n\nHere are the total number of appearances for each NHL team on the NBC Sports Groups networks:\n\nSome winners and losers …\n\nWinner: The American Four, a.k.a. the U.S. Original Six teams. There are 23 games in the mix for NBC, meaning there are 46 teams in that mix. Of those 46 possible appearances, 22 are either by the New York Rangers, Boston Bruins, Detroit Red Wings or Chicago Blackhawks. Combine that with the gaudy appearance numbers for cable and it's good to be old school.\n\nLoser: California. As Steve Lepore of Puck The Media notes, there will be exactly one game between NBC and VERSUS/NBCSN that will be held in the state of California: The Anaheim Ducks hosting the Chicago Blackhawks on Feb. 26. California has the same number of home games as Winnipeg and one less than Vancouver.\n\nWinner: Steven Stamkos. The Lightning see a considerable jump in coverage after last season, even if they couldn't crack the NBC lineup. The Bolts face the Washington Capitals three times on VERSUS/NBCSN. In total between those networks and NHLN, the Bolts are on 21 times. Wow.\n\nLoser: Taylor Hall, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Jordan Eberle. For the second straight season, the Edmonton Oilers will not be featured on NBC or VERSUS, despite potentially featuring the first overall picks from the last two drafts that VERSUS aired. They couldn't even have a little generational throwdown between the Oilers and the Red Wings on the docket?\n\nWinner: Playoff Bubble Watchers. The overload of games from March 25 through April 7 is going to feel like the unofficial start of the postseason. Give the schedule-makers credit: With teams like the St. Louis Blues, Columbus Blue Jackets and Nashville Predators all featured, we could be watching the playoff life or death of these teams on a national level.\n\nLoser: Anyone Who Loved The 2011 Stanley Cup Final. Yes, we know it's nice to toss a bone to NHL Network with the Jan. 7 game between the Boston Bruins and the Vancouver Canucks in Boston. But to not have that game on NBC or NBCSN is a whiff.\n\nWhat are your impressions of the 2011-12 NHL schedule on NBC?"
