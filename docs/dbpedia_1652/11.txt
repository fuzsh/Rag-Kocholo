Soros Justice Media Fellow Amy Bach, an attorney and journalist, spent eight years investigating the courtroom lapses that each day upend lives across America. The book that resulted from her work—Ordinary Injustice: How America Holds Court—has been awarded the 2010 RFK Book Award from the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights.

John Seigenthaler, the center’s book award chair, said of the book:

With Ordinary Injustice, Amy Bach has given us a keenly insightful and profoundly disturbing exposition of the flawed and failing culture of the nation's administration of justice. Her detailed and documented account, enhanced by her own professional experience as a lawyer, presents a damning indictment of those within the system whose insensitivity, indifference, and ignorance endanger the very ideal of justice under law.

Bach will be honored in Washington, DC, on May 26.
