        "text": "About\n\nA Forum for Leaders at the Forefront of Innovation in the Arts\n\nIn the midst of rapid digital transformation, artists and arts organizations are harnessing technology to expand horizons, foster connections and redefine boundaries. At Catalyst, leaders at the forefront of innovation consider the implications of digital transformation in the arts through the lenses of sustainability, ethics and exploration and identify opportunities to enhance the creation, application and dissemination of art.\n\nSession Videos\n\nRecordings of our plenary sessions are available on-demand.\n\nInnovation By Design\n\nDelve into the evolution of the New World Symphony, and its home New World Center, which has emerged as a groundbreaking laboratory for the way music is taught, presented and experienced.\n\n• Moderated by Philip Kennicott, Chief Art & Architecture Critic, The Washington Post\n\n• Howard Herring, President & CEO, New World Symphony\n\n• Craig Webb, Senior Partner & Architect, Frank Gehry Partners\n\nNovel Operations\n\nExplore how technology is being utilized to expand the reach and deepen the impact of arts organizations and cultural institutions.\n\n• Moderated by Barbara London, Curator & Writer\n\n• Steven Brady, Deputy Director for Digital Initiatives and Chief Technology Officer, Barnes Foundation\n\n• Thom Collins, Neubauer Family Executive Director & President, Barnes Foundation\n\nEthical Frontiers\n\nDiscover how technology can enhance access to the arts through agency and participation while learning from art and tech trailblazers.\n\n• Moderated by Roddy Schrock, arts organizer and curator, Executive Director, Eyebeam Art & Technology Center\n\n• Lauren Lee McCarthy, Artist, Creator of p5.js, and Professor and Co-Director Social Software, UCLA\n\n• Dr. Safiya Noble, Professor, UCLA, Co-founder & Co-director of the UCLA Center for Critical Internet Inquiry\n\nPushing Limits\n\nDiscover how technology can reshape artistic practice with pioneers working at the forefront of creative expression and experience a new work by Marco Brambilla.\n\n• Moderated by Jennifer Farah, Director/Arts, Knight Foundation\n\n• Marco Brambilla, artist and director\n\n• Stephanie Dinkins, transdisciplinary artist\n\nCrowd-Sourced Photo Project\n\nKnight Foundation asked a random selection of about 25 attendees to document their day using disposable cameras. A selection of photographs are below, and the full gallery can be accessed and downloaded, here.\n\nFeatured Artists & Works\n\nScroll through all of Catalyst’s featured artists and works below, or make a selection to jump to further information.\n\nFormer Miami grantee explores Black and Indigenous histories in the Everglades, taking viewers on a journey through the River of Grass at sunset and paying homage to the Florida Highwaymen in this multimedia experience.\n\nDirected by Cornelius Tulloch, with performances by Arsimmer Mccoy and Kunya Rowley, and a video by Alexa Caravia and Justin Matousek.\n\nMarco Brambilla is a London-based artist known for his elaborate recontextualizations of popular and found imagery, as well as his pioneering use of digital imaging and AI technologies in time-based media art. Brambilla’s work has been internationally exhibited and is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Guggenheim Museum, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, ARCO Foundation (Madrid), Kunsthalle Vogelmann (Germany), and the Corcoran Gallery of Art . Notable shows include New Museum, Santa Monica Museum of Art , Seoul Biennial, Broad Art Museum, Borusan Contemporary (Istanbul) and Kunsthalle Bern (Switzerland).\n\nMachine Mangrove Gaming Installation highlights a new videogame episode and transmedia works in Leo Castañeda’s Levels & Bosses series expanding Latin American Surrealism for the digital age. Audiences traverse a posthuman mangrove biome where all landscapes, technology and beings are identifiably interconnected. To interrogate the progression structures of video games, participants use a broad range of mechanics including harmonizing, touch, camouflage, deep listening and illumination. Melding gaming, painting, 360° video art, textiles, furniture and a digital instrument, Castañeda creates participatory artworks that reimagine sustainable models of interaction and energy consumption in mass media.\n\nFusing gaming software with traditional fine art methods, Castañeda has generated industry-innovating texturing techniques and game mechanics for virtual assets that reinterpret South Florida and Latin American biodiversity through a continuous loop between analog and digital arts. Throughout Machine Mangrove Gaming Installation, Castañeda builds on Latin American art movements from Brazilian Tropicália and Mexican Muralism to Venezuelan kineticism, where the viewer is a navigator whose movement and perspective play a role in shaping the work itself, as Phillip Penix-Tadsen discusses in Shift Space 3.0 highlighting the 2023 Knight Arts + Tech Fellows.\n\nLeo Castañeda is a Colombian American artist living and working in Miami. Castañeda received a BFA from Cooper Union and an MFA from Hunter College. His work explores how the language and structures of video games intersect with the world at large, in the form of episodic games, installations, video art, virtual reality, sculpture and painting. Castañeda is a Knight Foundation Arts + Technology Fellow, YoungArts Artist Technology Fellow, Emergent Strategy Ideation Institute Praxis Projects participant and Harpo Foundation awardee. He is a former resident of the Bronx Museum AIM Program, Oolite Arts, SOMA Mexico City and Khoj International Arts Association in New Delhi, India.\n\nConversations with Bina48 is an ongoing art project that features a series of video interviews Dinkins conducts with an advanced Black social robot. In 2014, Dinkins started visiting Bina48, a humanoid robot said to be capable of independent thought and emotion, with the aim of befriending her and getting her to answer the question: “Who are your people?” To date, the two have discussed family, racism, faith, robot civil rights, consciousness, loneliness, knowledge, age and Bina48’s concern for her robot friends that are treated more like lab rats than people. Their conversations have been entertaining, frustrating—for both robot and artist–– surprisingly humorous, philosophical and, at times, absurd. Some of the resulting videos are presented here.\n\nWe are entering a new technological epoch that will completely change the way we live, work, love and remember (skeptics should recall the iPhone is only ten years old). Artificially intelligent systems are increasingly the ubiquitous, unseen arbiters of our social, civic and family lives. Ever-increasing computational power, combined with almost unlimited data, has led to a turning point in the way artificial intelligence assists, judges and cares for humans. The need to understand how, where and why bias enters human-robot interactions is more important than ever. Embodied AI will eventually become widely available vehicles and repositories for our life stories. And, disseminators of culture that are literally able to explain ideas and stories from the past to future generations. It is imperative that our AI doppelgangers be developed and coded in ways that convincingly represent the rich diversity of stories, cultures, and physicalities of the human family.\n\nStephanie Dinkins is a transmedia artist who creates experiences that spark dialogue about race, gender, aging and our future histories. Her work in AI and other mediums uses emerging technologies and social collaboration to work toward technological ecosystems based on care and social equity. Dinkins teaches at Stony Brook University, where she holds the Kusama Endowed Chair in Art. She was recently named one of Time Magazine’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2023) and is the inaugural recipient of the LG-Guggenhiem Award (2023) for artists working at the intersection of art and technology.\n\nThis Knight-funded installation was created by Dr. Madeline Gannnon, a multidisciplinary designer inventing better ways to communicate with machines. It features a team of koriobots—cable-driven robots that are dynamically choreographed to make things seemingly float through mid-air.\n\nThe koriobot platform is an open-source toolkit aimed at unlocking more imaginative experiences in robotics. It is designed to empower artists and designers to explore, create and innovate in this rapidly advancing, high-impact technology.\n\nFor Catalyst, the koriobots will be used to debut a new musical performance made in collaboration with the New World Symphony fellow and violinist Ye Jin Min. Min composed and choreographed a new piece titled “Four Moons” that she will perform as a duet with the koriobots.\n\nDr. Madeline Gannon is a multidisciplinary designer blending techniques in art, design, computer science and robotics to forge new futures for human-robot relations. Known as the “robot whisperer,” Gannon specializes in convincing robots to do things they were never intended to do, from transforming giant industrial robots into living, breathing mechanical creatures, to taming hordes of autonomous machines to behave like a pack of animals.\n\nIn Surrogate, Lauren Lee McCarthy personally offers her body as a remote-controlled surrogate to carry someone else’s child for nine months. The installation on view follows McCarthy as she discusses this proposition to potential parents and intensively navigates the process with consultation from doctors, psychologists, fertility specialists, surrogates, doulas, midwives and geneticists. This deeply personal work offers McCarthy’s body as physical, emotional and conceptual surrogate for understanding reproduction and technology’s role in it. The act of becoming a remote control surrogate serves as a metaphor for the control we may soon hold through processes of genetic engineering, as well as the immediate infringement on our bodily autonomy enacted by the legislation of reproductive rights worldwide.\n\nLauren Lee McCarthy is an artist examining social relationships in the midst of surveillance, automation and algorithmic living. She is a Creative Capital awardee, United States Artists Fellow, LACMA Art + Tech Lab grantee and has been awarded fellowships and residencies from Sundance, Eyebeam, MacDowell, Pioneer Works and Ars Electronica. Her work SOMEONE was awarded the Ars Electronica Golden Nica and the Japan Media Arts Social Impact Award, and her work LAUREN was awarded the IDFA DocLab Award for Immersive Non-Fiction. McCarthy’s work has been exhibited internationally, including at the Barbican Centre, Haus der elektronischen Künste, SIGGRAPH, Onassis Cultural Center, IDFA DocLab, Science Gallery Dublin and Seoul Museum of Art.\n\nHolographic renderings of adaptive architecture form Symbiotic House, a long-term project that reimagines the home as a potential site for climate care and adaptation. Symbiotic House will grow into a nature-culture learning center while enacting embodied mutualism as a design strategy. The project spawns from the artist’s personal desire to continue dwelling in a climate-precarious city through crafting ecological reciprocity.\n\nLee Pivnik is an artist living in Miami. A former Knight Arts Challenge winner and United States Artists Knight Arts + Tech Fellow, Pivnik works across disciplines taking inspiration from living systems and other species to imagine a future based on mutualistic relationships instead of extractive economies. Permeating his practice is the idea of entanglement––the touching, changing, mutating relationships between species and landscapes. Through these intimacies, worlds arise—worlds of decay and degradation or verdant flourishing. His drawings, sculptures and installations share this relational quality, referencing fungal networks, epiphytic plants and emergent animal architectures that inhabit South Florida.\n\nHe co-directs the Institute of Queer Ecology (IQECO), an ever-evolving collaborative organism that brings peripheral solutions to environmental degradation to the forefront of public consciousness.\n\nFormer United States Artists Knight Arts + Tech Fellow James Allister Sprang presents a musical composition that anchors a session of somatic listening in the genre of “orchestral spiritual jazz.” Written sixty feet beneath the surface of the Caribbean Sea, the work is intimately tethered to texts In the Wake by Christina Sharpe; The Black Interior by Elizabeth Alexander; and Inciting Joy by Ross Gay.\n\nJames Allister Sprang is an artist, technologist and researcher producing work that celebrates the sensory experience of Black life. Currently based in Philadelphia, he received an MFA from the University of Pennsylvania and a BFA from Cooper Union. Sprang has completed more than twenty residencies internationally and in 2022 was the recipient of the Pew Fellowship and the Knight Foundation Art + Tech Fellowship for his work with the only 4DSound system in the nation. Sprang has worked extensively with AI, advanced spatial sound systems and emerging tech. He has exhibited at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Brooklyn Museum, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts Museum, Storm King Art Center, The Kitchen, Baryshnikov Arts, The Public Theater, TATE Modern (UK) and MONOM (Germany), among others. His work has been reviewed in Artforum, Art in America and Art Papers.\n\nThis selection of multidimensional poems presented by theVERSEverse embodies their mission to explore the myriad ways in which words and images intertwine, growing together.\n\nSince 2021, the collective of poets, artists and technologists has explored the creative potential for composition and publication via blockchain, a realm where writers are empowered to transact their work, transcend the printed page and collaborate with one another.\n\nThis offering—a small sample of the hundreds of techno-infused poems they’ve ushered into the world—is planted here as a seed for the poetry anthology of the future, in which authorial imagination is unbounded, language and art exist in symbiosis, and every contributor is a vital force in a literary ecosystem in which connection to verse can lead to its collection.\n\nFeatured Speakers\n\nMakayla Bailey is the co-executive director of Rhizome at the New Museum. Bailey has held curatorial positions at the Museum of Modern Art and the Studio Museum in Harlem, where she co-organized the institution’s first digital exhibition, titled Hearts in Isolation. Bailey’s work has been featured in Artforum, ArtNews, Frieze, Harper’s Bazaar, Hyperallergic, PIN-UP, Essence and i-D Magazine. Her current research spans the environment, ethical stewardship of emerging technologies and the creation of an equitable historical accounting of born-digital art.\n\nSteve oversees all digital and information technology at the Barnes Foundation. With over twenty-five years of experience in Higher Education and the Cultural Sectors, he has played a crucial role in the Barnes’s pivot to online learning, notably in the development of the groundbreaking Visual Experience Platform. Holding two master’s degrees in Computer Engineering and Technology Management from Villanova University, his expertise in creating engaging platforms and driving revenue through technology have enriched visitor’s experiences and set new standards in accessible and inclusive art education.\n\nMarco Brambilla is a London-based artist known for his elaborate recontextualizations of popular and found imagery, as well as his pioneering use of digital imaging and AI technologies in time-based media art. Brambilla’s work has been internationally exhibited and is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, Guggenheim Museum (New York); San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; ARCO Foundation (Madrid); Kunsthalle Vogelmann (Germany); and the Corcoran Gallery of Art (Washington, DC). Notable shows include New Museum, New York; Santa Monica Museum of Art (Retrospective); Seoul Biennial, Korea; Broad Art Museum; Borusan Contemporary, Istanbul; and Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland.\n\nBrambilla has worked with Creative Time and Art Production Fund in New York to present public art installations and commissions, including his Nude Descending Staircase No.3 presented at the Oculus World Trade Center during Frieze New York.

He has worked alongside Frank Gehry developing a process and formal language of architecture that has grown from early small-scale projects into the large-scale works that are recognized today. During his tenure, Webb has been a leader on many noteworthy projects highlighting the performing arts that integrate acoustical issues and theater systems with architectural design. These projects most notably include the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College and the Jay Pritzker Pavilion at Millennium Park in Chicago. Currently, he is designing the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi, Battersea Power Station and Colburn School expansion, among others. Additionally, Webb has been instrumental in the design of museums around the world from the Experience Music Project, a rock and roll museum in Seattle, to the Ohr-O’Keefe Museum of Art in Biloxi, Mississippi, to the renovation and additions of the Art Gallery of Ontario.
