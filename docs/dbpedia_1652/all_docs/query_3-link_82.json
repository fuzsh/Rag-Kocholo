A wood bow and truss ceiling system, striking in its design, creates large, open areas within the facility that benefit AEA staff.

Despite this history, Covenant House’s New York City shelter comprised three adjacent found spaces that did not reflect the high-quality support that Covenant House provides to its youth. The organization initially engaged Denham Wolf to identify possible redevelopment options that addressed this disparity and advanced Covenant House’s long-term goals. The growing need for capital improvements favorably aligned with the rising property values in the newly defined Hudson Yards special district. Denham Wolf supported Covenant House in creating an actionable plan that would employ the organization’s underused development rights. The team explored a range of deal structures to implement this plan, including a complex public-private partnership with the City of New York, and ultimately guided Covenant House in the selection of a top private developer through a highly competitive RFP process.
