        "text": "The Clergy\n\nHonorary Clergy\n\nThe Music Office\n\nParish Office Staff\n\nThe Vestry\n\nThe Clergy\n\nThe Reverend Canon Carl F. Turner, B.A., M.Th.\n\nRector\n\nCanon Turner became XIII Rector of Saint Thomas Church in July 2014.\n\nPrior to coming to Saint Thomas, Fr Turner was Canon Precentor of Exeter Cathedral for thirteen years. He led the Department of Liturgy and Music and worked with the 850-year-old Cathedral School. Canon Turner was responsible for all the Cathedral’s worship and music, including Diocesan liturgy, and advised the Bishop and clergy in many areas of pastoral liturgy. He is a former member of the Church of England’s Liturgical Commission and was a Director of the Association of English Cathedrals.\n\nPrior to his time in Exeter, Canon Turner served two curacies in Essex at Leigh-on-Sea and Brentwood. He then became Rector of the Parish of the Divine Compassion, a large urban parish in Plaistow and Canning Town in the East End of London. All of his parishes have been Anglo-Catholic in tradition with a strong love of music and liturgy as well as a strong commitment to the communities that they serve. His parish in East London was part of the revival of the religious life in the Church of England and the first Franciscan Friary since the reformation was founded there.\n\nCanon Turner is a Fellow of Woodard Schools, a member of the Order of Saint John, a Chaplain to the Order of St Lazarus, and a Priest Associate of the Holy House of Our Lady of Walsingham. The Bishop of Exeter made him Canon Emeritus in recognition of his service to the Diocese and the wider Church. In the Spring of 2014, he was elected to the Board of Trustees of Nashotah House but has, since, also formed active links with Berkeley School of Divinity at Yale and the General Theological Seminary.\n\nCanon Turner was born in Kingston upon Hull, East Yorkshire, in the United Kingdom in 1960. By happy coincidence, this was also the hometown of the XI Rector, Father John Andrew who had been Chaplain to Archbishop Michael Ramsey. When retired, Michael Ramsey became Canon Turner’s mentor and friend when he studied at Durham University and then at Oxford and he arranged for two formative years in the United States when he was a seminarian. Canon Turner married his wife, Alison, in 1990. Alison is a teacher and a priest and, until Easter 2015 was Headmistress of Exeter Junior School, a leading independent preparatory school in the Southwest of England. Canon Turner and Alison have three adopted children who are now young adults; they also have a Cairn Terrier called Bertie.

While pursuing his studies at Davidson College, Father Moretz discerned a call to the priesthood. After college, his first job was in lay ministry where he served as Director of Youth Formation at Christ Church, Frederica in St. Simon’s Island, Georgia (where Charles Wesley once served). He then received his Masters of Divinity at the General Theological Seminary in New York City and was ordained a priest by the Right Reverend Henry Louttit of the Diocese of Georgia in 2006.\n\nFor his first years of ordained ministry, Father Moretz served in Yonkers, New York for multiple parishes there: St. Paul’s and La Iglesia Memorial de San Andres. He was then called to be Curate of Christ’s Church in Rye, New York. In that time, Father Moretz began a light-hearted online video series introducing the life and teaching of the Episcopal Church called “Father Matthew Presents.”\n\nIn 2012, Father Moretz returned to New York City to become Associate Rector for Christian Formation at St. Bartholomew’s Church. In 2018, he joined the team of clergy at St. Thomas Church. He was appointed Vicar and Chief Operating Officer in 2021.\n\nHe is married to Megan Brandt-Meyer, who works for the financial services company, TP ICAP. They are the loving parents of two sons, Samuel and Gabriel.\n\nEmail Fr Moretz\n\nThe Reverend Alison Joan Turner\n\nAssociate for Children & Family Ministry and School Chaplain\n\nThe Rev. Alison Turner became Associate for Children & Family Ministry at Saint Thomas Church in 2018.
