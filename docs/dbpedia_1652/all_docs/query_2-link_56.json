        "text": "Cellist and composer Tomeka Reid has emerged as one of the most original, versatile, and curious musicians in Chicago's bustling jazz and improvised music community. A 2022 MacArthur and Herb Alpert awardee, 2021 USA Fellow, 2019 Foundation of the Arts and 2016 3Arts recipient, Reid received her doctorate in music from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 2017. From 2019-2021 Tomeka Reid received a teaching appointment at Mills College as the Darius Milhaud chair in composition.\n\nTaylor Ho Bynum is a musician, teacher, and writer, with a background including work in composition, performance, interdisciplinary collaboration, production, organizing and advocacy. His expressionistic playing on cornet and other brass instruments, his expansive vision as composer and conductor, and his idiosyncratic improvisational approach have been documented on over 20 recordings as a bandleader and over 100 as a sideperson. His past endeavors include his Acoustic Bicycle Tours (where he traveled to concerts solely by bike across thousands of miles) and his stewardship of Anthony Braxton's Tri-Centric Foundation (which he served as executive director from 2010-2018, producing and performing on many major Braxton projects, including two operas and multiple festivals). Bynum has worked with other legendary figures such as Bill Dixon and Cecil Taylor and currently enjoys playing with friends in collective ensembles like his duo with Tomas Fujiwara, Illegal Crowns (with Fujiwara, Benoit Delbecq and Mary Halvorson) and Geometry (with Kyoko Kitamura, Tomeka Reid and Joe Morris), and as a sideperson in groups led by Fujiwara, Reid, Jim Hobbs, Bill Lowe and William Parker, among others. His writings on music have been published in The New Yorker, The Baffler, Point of Departure and Sound American.\n\nNow residing in Philadelphia, multidisciplinary artist Mikel Patrick Avery had been actively working out of Chicago and New Orleans for the past 17 years. Established as a jazz drummer, he is commonly recognized for his orchestral and melodic drumming style that often involves unconventional \"non-musical\" objects. Avery is also a dedicated filmmaker, composer, photographer, designer and educator, whose body of work invariably draws upon ideas of 'unstructured play' commonly applied to learning environments found in early education.In recent years, Avery has become an integral voice in varying ensembles as well as leading several of his own projects, including 1/2 Size Piano Trio, Wazella, Sore Thumb, PARADE and MPA 'PLAY'. Mikel has had the privilege to perform and exhibit either his own work or in accompaniment to others at a variety of venues and cultural institutions around the world. Most notably at The Art Institute of Chicago, New Museum NYC, Art Basel (Switzerland), Hyde Park Jazz Festival, The Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago), Documenta, Drunk Lunch Gallery, Pitchfork Music Festival, Oto (London), & White Cube (London).\n\nViolinist Sam Bardfeld is a member of The Jazz Passengers and a frequent collaborator of Bruce Springsteen.

Bardfeld's latest recording, The Great Enthusiasms (BJUR, 2017), earned acclaim from top critics including Nate Chinen who called it \"brilliantly odd and altogether lovely\" (WBGO) and Bill Milkowski, who said he \"combines a touch of Stuff Smith's playfulness with a Charles Ives aesthetic – 4 Stars!\" (DownBeat). His book, Latin Violin (Hal Leonard, 2002), is considered the authoritative work on the Afro-Cuban violin tradition. Bardfeld has also toured Europe multiple times with his own group. Some recent projects include performances in Chicago and Berlin with a string quartet with cellist Tomeka Reid devoted to the music of the late, great saxophonist Julius Hemphill; and a collaborative trio with legendary drummer Barry Altschul and bassist Joe Fonda.\n\nSarah Bernstein is a New York-based violinist/composer whose work blurs the lines between innovative jazz, new chamber music, experimental pop and noise music.
