Johnson | patricia.johnson@curtis.edu | (215) 717-3190\n\nRyan Scott Lathan | ryan.lathan@curtis.edu | (215) 717-3145\n\nDownload PDF\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PA—August 26, 2024—With the start of its centennial year, Curtis Institute of Music proudly announces the appointment of four new faculty members. Soloist, chamber musician, and multifaceted artist Nicholas Canellakis (Cello ’06); The Philadelphia Orchestra assistant principal Yumi Kendall (Cello ’04); Boston Symphony Orchestra member Christine Jeonghyoun Lee (Cello ’13); and Baltimore Symphony Orchestra principal clarinet YaoGuang Zhai (Clarinet ’09) will join Curtis’ celebrated faculty beginning this fall.\n\nThe addition of these new positions expands the faculty size in both departments, providing greater flexibility and more personalized learning opportunities. In the clarinet department, Mr. Zhai joins current faculty member Anthony McGill (’00), the school’s William R. and Hyunah Yu Brody Distinguished Chair and principal clarinetist of the New York Philharmonic. Curtis students also work with the chamber music clarinet faculty: Mark Dover of the Imani Winds and Michael Rusinek (’92), Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra principal.\n\nSays Mr. McGill, “I’m excited to work alongside my colleague YaoGuang Zhai at Curtis. We will continue to uphold the beautiful traditions we hold dear while looking toward the future of training the most talented young clarinetists in the world.”\n\n“It is truly an honor to return to Curtis as a member of the clarinet faculty, and especially to collaborate with such an exceptional musician as Anthony McGill,” says Mr. Zhai. “I am both moved and motivated by this unique opportunity to guide and help shape future generations of clarinetists at such a prestigious institution. As Curtis celebrates its 100th anniversary it is exciting and at the same time humbling to be able to contribute to this rich legacy and tradition of excellence.”\n\nIn the cello department, Mr. Canellakis, Ms. Kendall, and Ms. Lee will join current faculty members Gary Hoffman—the Nina and Billy Albert Chair in Cello Studies—and Peter Wiley (’74)—the Bruce Jay Gould, M.D. Chair, in honor of Orlando Cole. Cello students also work with chamber music faculty, including Camden Shaw (Cello ’10, ’11, and String Quartet ’14) of the Dover Quartet, the school’s Penelope P. Watkins Ensemble in Residence. With the addition of Mr. Canellakis, Ms. Kendall, and Ms. Lee, the cello department will operate on a more collaborative studio model, enabling students to benefit from each teacher’s unique expertise and perspective.\n\n“Curtis’ commitment to innovation is evident in this unique approach to the traditional studio structure,” says Yumi Kendall. “It empowers us as faculty to continually adapt to the needs of our students at an individual level, using our respective strengths and experiences to nurture the next generation of artists and leaders.”\n\nEach with a distinctive career as active performers, these new faculty members bring to their Curtis students a lived understanding of what it takes to forge a personal path through today’s field. They will join Curtis’ celebrated faculty of world-renowned musician-teachers, mentoring the next generation of artists through intensive, personalized study.\n\n“Curtis has meant the world to me since I first entered its doors as a student over twenty years ago, and I’ve taken its ethos, spirit, and musical traditions with me throughout my life,” says Mr. Canellakis. “I can’t express enough how much pride and joy I feel to now be joining the school as a member of the cello faculty, alongside my mentor Peter Wiley, Gary Hoffman, and my fellow new faculty Yumi and Christine. I’m honored and humbled to be a part of Curtis’s extraordinary legacy, and to carry on everything I’ve learned to the next generation of musicians.”\n\nSince it first opened its doors in October 1924, Curtis has sought to equip its students with the inspiration and the tools to forge successful careers—now and in the future. In addition to their outstanding artistry, these new Curtis faculty members provide an array of examples of the entrepreneurial spirit, leadership, and adaptability, blazing their own professional paths and making a meaningful impact in their communities on and off the stage.\n\n“I am thrilled to return to Curtis, a place that has profoundly shaped my musical journey,” says Ms. Lee. “Curtis is not just where my musical foundation was built; it is a treasured home of both tradition and exploration. This esteemed school has long been a beacon of excellence in music education, and I am excited to contribute to its rich legacy. I look forward to working with the talented students and collaborating with my distinguished colleagues and mentors, sharing my passion and fostering an environment of creativity and artistic growth.”\n\nABOUT THE NEW FACULTY\n\nNicholas Canellakis (Cello ’06)\n\nA sought-after and multifaceted artist, Nicholas Canellakis has forged a unique voice combining his talents as soloist, chamber musician, curator, filmmaker, and composer/arranger.\n\nRecent concert highlights include concerto appearances with the Virginia, Albany, Delaware, Stamford, Richardson, Lansing, and Bangor symphonies, the Erie Philharmonic, The Orchestra Now, the New Haven Symphony as artist-in-residence, and the American Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall.
