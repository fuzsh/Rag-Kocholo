        "text": "\"Music for me is an embrace of the world â a way to open myself up to being alive in the world in my body, in my sounds, and in my mind.\"  Augusta Read Thomas\n\nBiography\n\nThe music of Augusta Read Thomas (b. 1964 in New York) is nuanced, majestic, elegant, capricious, lyrical, and colorful â \"it is boldly considered music that celebrates the sound of the instruments and reaffirms the vitality of orchestral music\" (Philadelphia Inquirer).\n\nA composer featured on a Grammy winning CD by Chanticleer and Pulitzer Prize finalist, Thomas’ impressive body of works “embodies unbridled passion and fierce poetry” (American Academy of Arts and Letters). The New Yorker magazine called her \"a true virtuoso composer.\" Championed by such luminaries as Barenboim, Rostropovich, Boulez, Eschenbach, Salonen, Maazel, Ozawa, and Knussen, she rose early to the top of her profession. The American Academy of Arts and Letters described Thomas as “one of the most recognizable and widely loved figures in American Music.\"\n\nShe is a University Professor of Composition in Music and the College at The University of Chicago. Thomas was the longest-serving Mead Composer-in-Residence with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for conductors Daniel Barenboim and Pierre Boulez (1997-2006). This residency culminated in the premiere of Astral Canticle, one of two finalists for the 2007 Pulitzer Prize in Music. During her residency, Thomas not only premiered nine commissioned orchestral works, but was also central in establishing the thriving MusicNOW series, through which she commissioned and programmed the work of many living composers. For the 2017-2018 concert season, Thomas was the Composer-in-Residence with the Eugene Symphony Orchestra, while Francesco Lecce-Chong served as Music Director and Scott Freck as Executive Director. Thomas was MUSICALIVE Composer-in-Residence with the New Haven Symphony, a national residency program of The League of American Orchestras and Meet the Composer.\n\nThomas won the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize, among many other coveted awards. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Thomas was named the 2016 Chicagoan of the Year.\n\nIn 2016, Augusta Read Thomas founded the University of Chicago’s Center for Contemporary Composition, which is a dynamic, collaborative, and interdisciplinary environment for the creation, performance and study of new music and for the advancement of the careers of emerging and established composers, performers, and scholars. Distinguished by its formation within an uncompromising, relentlessly searching, and ceaselessly innovative scholarly environment, which celebrates excellence and presents new possibilities for intellectual dialogue, the Center comprises ten integrated entities: annual concert series featuring the Grossman Ensemble, CHIME, visiting ensembles, distinguished guest composers, performances, recordings, research, student-led projects, workshops and postdoctoral fellowships.\n\nNot only is Thomas one of the most active composers in the world, but she is a long-standing, exemplary citizen with an extensive history of being deeply committed to her community. She is the former Chairperson for the American Music Center; Vice President for Music, The American Academy of Arts and Letters; and Member of the Conseil Musical de la Foundation Prince Pierre de Monaco.\n\nIn February 2015, music critic Edward Reichel wrote, \"Augusta Read Thomas has secured for herself a permanent place in the pantheon of American composers of the 20th and 21st centuries. She is without question one of the best and most important composers that this country has today. Her music has substance and depth and a sense of purpose. She has a lot to say and she knows how to say it â and say it in a way that is intelligent yet appealing and sophisticated.\"\n\nRecent and upcoming commissions include those from the Santa Fe Opera in collaboration with the San Francisco Opera and other opera companies, PEAK Performances at Montclair State University and the Martha Graham Dance Company, The Cathedral Choral Society of Washington D.C., The Indianapolis Symphony, Tanglewood, The Kaleidoscope Chamber Orchestra, Des Moines Symphony, Boston Symphony, the Utah Symphony, Wigmore Hall in London, JACK quartet, Third Coast Percussion, Spektral Quartet, Chicago Philharmonic, Eugene Symphony, the Danish Chamber Players, Notre Dame University, Janet Sung, Lorelei Vocal Ensemble, and the Fromm Foundation.\n\nThomas has the distinction of having her work performed more frequently in 2013-2014 than any other living ASCAP composer, according to statistics from the performing rights organization (New York Times). Her discography includes 90 commercially recorded CDs.\n\n\"One central metaphor of my lifeâs creative work is that of light refracting. Of interest to me, for my work, is to build, sculpt, and compose clean, clear, transparent, translucent, luminous, radiant, shining, resounding, and resonant musical materials.\"  Augusta Read Thomas, quoted from her program note for Bebop Kaleidoscope, Homage to Duke Ellington, for orchestra, commissioned by the New York Philharmonic.\n\n\"I think of myself, and have been described as, a poet-composer. I sculpt my music akin to how poets create, refine, and polish their poems.\"  Augusta Read Thomas, transcribed from the Collage New Music âThe Composer Speaksâ Video Interview\n\n\"I am never listening for aesthetic categories. Rather, I am listening for excellence of the piece on its own terms no matter what style, language, aesthetic.\"  Augusta Read Thomas\n\nCollaborative Efforts\n\nFounder and Director of The Chicago Center for Contemporary Composition\n\nFounded and runs the Grossman Ensemble for which she commissions and premieres the works of numerous other composers.\n\nVice President for Music, The American Academy of Arts and Letters\n\nMember of the Board of Directors of The Koussevitzky Foundation\n\nMember of the Board of Directors of The Aaron Copland Fund for Music, Inc.\n\nMember of the Board of Directors of the Alice M.

Unbreakable is the power of art to build community. Humanity has and will always work together to further musicâs flexible, diverse capacity and innate power.\"  Augusta Read Thomas\n\n\"Inspired by prose and poem, myth and lore, philosophy and religion, modern dance and jazz improvisation, Thomasâ composition is informed by layers of drawings, charts, and colorful visual artistry.\"  R.J. Weick from her Feature Article in Great Lakes ByÂ Design Magazine\n\nAwards and Honors\n\nIn 2007, Thomas's composition, ASTRAL CANTICLE, was one of two finalists for the Pulitzer Prize in Music. Her work was also featured on the Grammy-winning CD Colors of Love by Chanticleer.\n\nAugusta Read Thomas won the Lancaster Symphony Orchestra's Composer Award for 2015-16. This is the oldest award of its kind in the nation, intended \"to recognize and honor living composers who reside in the US who are making a particularly significant contribution in the field of symphonic music, not only through their own creative efforts, but also as effective personal advocates of new approaches to the broadening of critical and appreciative standards.\" Former winners include Howard Hanson, William Schuman, Walter Piston, Morton Gould, Ned Rorem, David Del Tredici, John Corigliano, Joan Tower, and others.\n\nThe Sovereign Prince of Monaco awarded Augusta CHEVALIER of the Order of Cultural Merit. The insignia of this distinction was given by S.A.R. Princess of Hanover at the Prince's Palace on 18 November 2015.\n\nThomas' chamber opera LIGEIA (librettist: Leslie Dunton-Downer, based on the short story by Poe of the same title) was awarded the International Orpheus Prize (Luciano Berio, President of the jury) and performed in Spoleto, Italy (Luca Ronconi, stage director). LIGEIA, commissioned by Mstislav Rostropovich and Rencontres Musicales d'Evian, was premiered by Rostropovich at the 1994 Evian Festival. The American premiere took place at the Aspen Music Festival on July 27, 1995.\n\nThomas has received many awards and fellowships.\n\n\"I love composing. In a good way, my nerve endings for sound are always dialed up high â actually, they are on perpetual alert. If I hear one note or chord or if, for example, I play one on an instrument, I get lit up as if electric shock ribbons instantly race from my ears and fingertips to my imagination and then my creativity and craft play high-speed ping-pong where the ball is bouncing back and forth 100 times a second. Itâs like living inside of a poem.\n\nThe outcomes are unpredictable to me. I stay absolutely flexible. Everything is malleable, springy, stretchy, coil-able, color-able, twistable, bouncing, zig-zagging, and splinter-able. It feels like I am dancing with contrapuntal flickering sonic lights that accumulate into a spinning pinwheel spawning sound and form. I slide, skate, swivel, and spin with my materials - crafting nuance and finesse - and then I sculpt, shape, chisel, fashion, and form.\n\nAt the end of all of that, I feel as if the piece wrote me â not as if I wrote the piece! My music has its own inner life. If I listen carefully, the piece I am composing will tell me what it next needs.\"  Augusta Read Thomas, transcribed from the Miller Theatre at Columbia University MISSION COMMISSION Podcast interview\n\nSelected Awards\n\nCentennial Award from the Eastman School of Music (2022)\n\nSiemens Foundation in Munich (2001)\n\nThomasâ album Of Being is a Bird received BBC Music Magazine's Chamber Choice award in 2016.\n\nLincoln Academy of Illinois awarded Thomas the Order of Lincoln in 2014.\n\nASCAP Rudolph Nissim Award (1999)\n\nCeremonial, for orchestra, was chosen as a Recommended Work at the UNESCO International Rostrum of Composers in 2001.\n\nChanticleer's album Colors of Love, featuring two works by Thomas, won a Grammy in 2000.\n\nBMI (1990)\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts Grants (1988, 1992, 1994)\n\nAmerican Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Awards (1989, 1994, 2001)\n\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation [1988]\n\nKoussevitzky Foundation Commission (1999, 2011)\n\nNew York Foundation for the Arts (1998)\n\nJohn W.

Its inventiveness, its lyric turns seem almost magically sustained; and, unfaillingly, result in a beautiful immediacy.\"  American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Citation when winning the Academy Award\n\n\"Some of her long-standing preoccupations include: the love of dance which propels the music into a tirelessly evolving voyage in both rhythmic and narrative terms; the iridescent, bell-saturated sonic environment that fills her musical landscapes with light and clarity; the sense of jazz auras acting as guiding spirits propelling the music on its course with its restless, hocketing rhythms and penetrating harmonic flavours; a celebration and understanding of instrumental virtuosity; and the overall sense of her music engaged in a deep-seated interaction between the present and the past.\"  Paul Pellay\n\nAround Chicago\n\nChicago Center for Contemporary Composition at the University of Chicago\n\nIn 2016, Augusta Read Thomas founded the University of Chicago’s Center for Contemporary Composition, which is a dynamic, collaborative, and interdisciplinary environment for the creation, performance and study of new music and for the advancement of the careers of emerging and established composers, performers, and scholars.

The festival was made possible, in part, by major support from the Alice M. Ditson Fund of Columbia University.\n\nCrainâs Business Magazine: Chicagoâs 40 under 40 (2002)\n\nAugusta was named one of Chicago’s most important citizens under the age of 40.\n\n\"...unique among the worldâs most prominent living composers for the consistent attention she [Thomas] devotes to projects on the broad behalf of other composers and curious listeners. The envisioning is not only meticulous in detail but also breathtakingly big in scope.\"  Nancy Malitz, Classical Voice North America\n\n\"Augusta Read Thomas is one of the most important composers in the USA today.\"  Dance International Magazine, 2020\n\nTeaching\n\nAugusta is a passionate and devoted teacher. Teaching is a natural extension of her creative process and of her avid enthusiasm for the music of others. She is a devoted listener to the music of all kinds and as such has a broad and deep knowledge of the music of our time. For Augusta, working with students is a joy, a deeply felt commitment, and an integrated part of her creative existence. She has said, \"Teaching is a natural extension of my creative process and of my enthusiasm for the music of others.\"\n\nAugusta was an assistant, then associate professor of composition at the Eastman School of Music from 1993-2001, and was the Wyatt Professor of Music (Endowed Chair) at Northwestern University from 2001 until 2006. She currently continues her involvement with Northwestern University by serving on the Dean's Music Advisory Board. In 2010, Thomas became the 16th ever University Professor (one of nine current University Professors) at The University of Chicago.\n\nIn the summers she often teaches at the Tanglewood Music Center and the Aspen Music Festival. Thomas was the Director of the Festival of Contemporary Music at Tanglewood in 2009. Thomas frequently undertakes residencies in colleges, universities, and festivals across the country and in Europe and Asia. From time to time, she teaches private composition lessons for advanced students. From 2009-2011 she taught and mentored 10 high school-aged composers in the state of Connecticut. Each composer had their new piece premiered by the New Haven Symphony in May 2011.\n\nThomas studied composition with Oliver Knussen at Tanglewood (1986, 1987, 1989); Jacob Druckman at Yale University (1988); Alan Stout and Bill Karlins at Northwestern University (1983-1987); and at the Royal Academy of Music in London (1989). She was a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University (1991-94), and a Bunting Fellow at Radcliffe College (1990-91). She considers J.S. Bach to be among her most important teachers.\n\nâThomas' music, particularly her orchestral music, fairly explodes with an extroverted boldness of utterance audiences and musicians alike find challenging yet immediate. It's music that doesn't sound like anybody else's â music that insists you pay attention.â  John von Rhein, Chicago Tribune\n\nWritings by and about Augusta Read Thomas\n\nAugusta on her MAPS-OF-FORM drawings\n\nCommencement Speech by Augusta\n\nEssay by Seth Brodsky\n\nAugusta on Jazz Influences on her Work\n\nAugusta on J.S.
