        "text": "Revelle College Faculty Fellows\n\nRevelle College honor individuals who have made exceptional and sustained contributions to Revelle College, in particular its students, in the form of education, service, and/or research. Candidates who meet these high standards will be of two types: Fellows will be Revelle Faculty or Revelle Emeritus Faculty while Honorary Fellows will be members of the UCSD community more broadly.\n\nIn addition to honoring those who have already greatly contributed to the mission of Revelle College, we hope this program will also\n\nfoster greater interaction between Revelle faculty and the student body (which can help overcome some of the depersonalization that can occur in large institutions)\n\nencourage creative ways to further education in and outside traditional academic settings\n\nhelp produce a stronger sense of community between all members of Revelle College\n\nAmy Adler\n\nProfessor, Visual Arts\n\nRichard Attiyeh\n\nProfessor Emeritus, Department of Economics\n\nDr. Attiyeh received his Ph.D. in Economics from Yale University.\n\nBrenda Bloodgood\n\nAssociate Professor in the Division of Biological Sciences, Neurobiology Section at the UC San Diego\n\nKavli Faculty Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind\n\nResearch in the Bloodgood lab aims to understand how the function of neural circuits changes in response to an animal’s interaction with its environment. She is approaching this question by investigating how activity-dependent gene expression regulates the connectivity between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hippocampal microcircuit with the goal of understanding how these processes relate to animal behavior and disease.\n\nDr. Bloodgood earned her B.Sc. in Animal Physiology and Neuroscience from UC San Diego in 2001 and her Ph.D. from the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School in 2006. She continued at Harvard Medical School as a postdoctoral fellow before establishing her own lab in 2012. She is a Searle and Pew Biomedical Scholar, the recipient of a NIH Director’s New Innovator Award.\n\nF. Thomas Bond\n\nRevelle College Provost Emeritus (1983-2003)\n\nProfessor Emeritus, Department of Chemistry\n\nDr. Bond, received a B.S. degree in chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1958 and a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from Berkeley in 1962. He served on the faculty at Oregon State University for five years before moving to San Diego.\n\nDr. Bond was selected as acting provost of Revelle College in 1983, subsequently serving as provost for 20 years. He was named to receive the Revelle College Excellence in Teaching Award in 1971 and 1973 and received the UCSD Excellence in Teaching Award from the Chancellor's Associates in 1979. In presenting the award, the Associates cited Bond's \"extraordinary effort outside the classroom that includes careful preparation, good organization, reflection on aims and goals, fairness in grading, and a genuine concern for the well-being of his students.\"\n\nStanley Chodorow\n\nProfessor Emeritus, Department of History\n\nStephen D. Cox\n\nDistinguished Professor, Literatures in English\n\nDirector, Revelle College Humanities Writing Program\n\n\"In academic life one does many things at the same time, and one research or teaching interest may develop into many others. I have been fortunate to have found an audience for a great variety of work, little of which I ever predicted I would do. One thing led to another. I plan to keep on in this way, in the hope that what I write will continue to be read.\"\n\nEdward Dennis\n\nDistinguished Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Emeritus\n\nDistinguished Professor of Pharmacology Emeritus\n\nKathleen French\n\nProfessor Emeritus, Division of Biological Sciences\n\nDr. French's research interests focus at the intersection between the study of how a nervous system is assembled during embryonic development and how activity in the nervous system allows an animal to produce behavior appropriate to its circumstances. She studies these questions in an annelid worm--the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis--because it has a relatively simple nervous system, yet it produces complex behaviors. In addition, leech embryos are quite robust, allowing us to do a variety of experiments.\n\nSarah Gille\n\nProfessor of Physical Oceanography at Scripps Institution of Oceanography\n\nProf. Gille's research focuses on the ocean's role in climate. Her research group makes use of satellite observations and autonomous instruments to study processes across the planet, including in the Southern Ocean and in the California Current.

Wayne\n\nProvost Emeritus, Revelle College (2009-13) /Chair Emeritus, Department of Literature (2005-2009)\n\nGuggenheim Fellow\n\nI am an alumnus of UC San Diego where I completed my PhD after having studied with faculty in Literature, Philosophy, Linguistics and Sociology. I arrived as a graduate student in 1969 and my first office on campus, shared with another student, was in Galbraith Hall. So, when I was invited to become the Provost of Revelle College in 2009, it was both an honor and a homecoming. I believe I am the first UCSD alumnus to have served as a college provost, and the first faculty member from outside the STEM fields to have served as Revelle Provost. I like to think that my appointment was consistent with the ideals of the founders, including Roger Revelle, John S. Galbraith, and Herbert York, who devised the curriculum of Revelle College, and who took a stand at that time against a notion, then gaining currency, that in the 20th century Western intellectual culture had split into \"Two Cultures,\" one of science and technology, the other of the humanities and arts. I have always been interested in transdisciplinary research and teaching and in my early years on the faculty I worked closely with two pioneering figures in UCSD's history, Aaron Cicourel, a founder of UCSD's Cognitive Science Department, and Michael Cole, Professor of Communication and Psychology and Director of the Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition.\n\nMy current research is a development from that earlier collaboration and involves the history of epistemology in relation to public policy. Topics range from early 17th century literary relations with the \"new science,\" to current issues in college admissions and equity of access to higher education, a question I consider of paramount importance today. For the latter, I've drawn gratefully from my experience at UCSD as a department chair and as Revelle Provost, and especially from what I have learned from our students over the years.\n\nAntony Lyon\n\nAssistant Teaching Professor, Director, Humanities Program at Revelle College\n\nAntony Lyon received his Ph.D. in Political Science from UC San Diego. He joined the Humanities Program in 2010, becoming Director in 2022. He teaches all five courses in the Humanities sequence.\n\nKristina Markman\n\nAssociate Director, Humanities Program at Revelle College\n\nDr. Markman received her Ph.D. in Medieval History from UCLA in 2015. Before joining the Revelle College Humanities Program she taught at UCLA, Loyola Marymount University, and West Los Angeles Community College. Her primary research interests are intellectual and cultural history with an emphasis on frontier interactions in the High Middle Ages.\n\nAs a member of the Humanities Program, Dr. Markman’s mission is to empower students to become productive and engaged community members by reflecting on the human experience and considering key issues that have shaped today’s world from a variety of perspectives—history, philosophy, religion, literature, and art. In 2021, Dr. Markman received the Revelle College Outstanding Teaching Award in Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences.\n\nM.
