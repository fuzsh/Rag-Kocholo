        "text": "Sangria sometimes get a bad rap that is not always undeserving. Like any cocktail, if it is made with pre-mixed ingredients, you will end up with a syrupy sweet concoction that just doesn’t do this historical drink justice. I always endorse the use of fresh, quality ingredients in any cocktail, but that’s because I spend too many years behind a bar making them both ways. The drinks that always got a “Wow!” were the ones that made to order with fresh juices, fruit and garnishes.\n\nSangria should be no different. Yes, it had a humble beginning in Spain but it has grown world-wide to be a refreshing party drink. For you Jane Austen fans out there, The Claret Cup Punch she wrote about is, in fact, a sangria. Mrs. Bennet served it after her mischevious daughter Lydia ran off with Wickham to celebrate their marriage, despite the scandal it caused in Pride & Prejudice. In addition, Mr. Weston served it at his Christmas party, you know, the one where Mr. Elton imbibed too much and revealed his true feelings for the heroine in Emma. Nearly everyone of Miss Austen’s stories has a party scene in which sangria was served. And as it should be, sangria is a drink meant to be shared with friends over a punch bowl at a summer party.\n\nBut I digress….\n\nAlthough Sangria is traditionally a punch made from red wine, modern recipes have evolved that use white wine and roses as well. Rioja has been the most popular base but increasingly we’ve seen on restaurant menus white, rose and sparkling. So I have decided to share with you my personal recipes for crowd pleasing cocktails. I know that some people like to add fizz to their sangria so feel free to add seltzer to any of these still wine recipes.\n\nRed Sangria:\n\n1 BIG punch bowl\n\n1 bottle of red wine. Doesn’t have to be expensive. I suggest Grenache or Rioja\n\n½ cup of Clement Creole Shrubb (Orange liqeuor…can substitute Grand Marnier or Cointreau)\n\n½ cup of raspberry or citrus flavored rum-depends on how fruity you like it.\n\n¼ cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice\n\n1/3 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice\n\n1/3 cup freshly pureed raspberries\n\nSoak overnight in the wine: sliced orange, lime, lemon, raspberries, blueberries, apples and red grapes (halved). Then mix the rest the ingredients in before serving. Garnish with a slice of orange and a raspberry skewered.\n\nWhite Sangria:\n\n**This recipe also goes great with a sparkling wine like a Cava Brut or Prosecco.\n\n1 BIG punch bowl\n\n1 bottle of white wine. I like Vinho Verde for the crisp flavors it adds.\n\n½ cup of pear brandy\n\n½ cup of peach flavored rum\n\n¼ cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice\n\n1/3 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice\n\n1/3 cup freshly pureed peaches (for something more tropical use mangoes instead)\n\nSoak overnight in the wine: sliced orange, lime, lemon, peach, apple, red and green grapes (halved). Mix the rest of the ingredients in before serving. Garnish with a slice of peach and a raspberry skewered.\n\nRose Sangria:\n\n1 BIG punch bowl\n\n1 bottle of rose. Something dry and crisp like a rose from Provence.\n\n½ cup of red berry flavored rum\n\n½ cup of fruit liqueur. I like Thatcher’s Blueberry or Yumberry\n\n¼ cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice\n\n1/3 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice\n\n1/3 Cup of freshly pureed strawberries\n\nSoak overnight in the wine: sliced orange, lime, lemon, strawberries (halved), red and green grapes (halved). Mix the rest of the ingredients in before serving. Garnish with a slice of strawberry. Add basil for a delicious kick!\n\nI know these recipes may seem like a lot of work but trust me, the end result is worth the effort. Get your friends slicing up the fruit and you have got yourself a pre-party!\n\nHappy Sangria making everyone!\n\nIt’s the summer of Riesling according to Matt Reiser, the sommelier and beverage director at Upstairs on the Square, and I couldn’t be happier about it! In celebration of this spectacular idea, we had a tasting on Thursday of international Rieslings with City Table in the Lenox Hotel. It was the inaugural Chef’s Series event in Bauer and we were ready to eat great food and drink our way through the wines. For those of you who haven’t heard of the Chef’s Series yet, Bauer is inviting Back Bay chefs into our store for special tasting events. The chef brings in their specialty and we pair our wines for a tasting event that won’t soon be forgotten.\n\nSous Chef Sean MacAlpine prepared his Dynamite Shrimp Kabobs with pineapple BBQ sauce and salsa verde. Just picture it… Jumbo shrimp on cane skewers brushed with Sean’s homemade BBQ sauce and grilled. On the side, corn bread with hints of chili with a pineapple tomatillo salsa verde. Are you drooling yet? Sean’s dish was utterly delicious. The slight spiciness of the shrimp kabobs was offset by the the Rieslings perfectly. Definitely a match made in heaven.\n\nFor our end we offered our faithful followers who trudged through the rain to attend, four Rieslings from around the world: 2010 Frisk Naturally Prickly Riesling from Victoria, Australia, 2010 Weingut Karl Erbes Riesling out of Mosel, Germany, 2008 Ravines Dry Riesling from the Finger Lakes in New York and lastly a 2009 Hugel Riesling from Alsace, France.\n\nA great big thank you goes out to City Table’s General Manager Robert George and Sous Chef Sean MacAlpine for a wonderful event! They were both great to work with and they certainly charmed all who walked through the door. We hope to be able to work with them in the near future again!\n\nCheck out some of our attendees! Thank you to everyone who came out on a Thursday for helping us make this a successful and fun night.\n\nYes, I know it sounds crazy but on Tuesday I watched people have dog food and beer. The Fish & Bone (217 Newbury St) hosted a tasting of The Honest Kitchen for both dogs and their humans. Kathy Palmer, the owner, and her crew put out quite a spread for everyone. From doggie beer and beer bones for the pooches to human beer, chicken sausage and chips for everyone else, Kathy made sure no one would go hungry.\n\nThis was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. Yes, I love dogs and I was excited to see them drinking their Bowser Beer and trying a new food. So I offered to come down and talk about the beers that Kathy was offering her guests. My job was to just tell people about the Avery’s IPA, Avery’s White Rascal, Smuttynose Old Brown Dog and Lagunitas New Dogtown American Pale Ale. These four delicious beers I paired with the dog foods from The Honest Kitchen. Little did I know that people would actually take me up on these pairings. It isn’t as gross as it sounds. The Honest Kitchen’s dog food is made from meat, vegetables and fruit only; there’s even a vegetarian choice. They are gluten free and most of them contain no grain. I would equate it to putting your dinner in the blender before you eat it. Surprisingly, there wasn’t a single taster, human or canine, that didn’t enjoy every bite.\n\nOverall, the dogs and their humans had a great time. I am thrilled that I could be a part of their event and promote some of Bauer’s beer. The big hit of the hour was definitely Avery’s White Rascal. A truly authentic Belgian style wheat or “white” ale, that is unfiltered (yup, that’s yeast on the bottom) and cleverly spiced with coriander and Curacao orange peel producing a refreshingly fruity thirst quencher.\n\nLet’s play a word association game. I say the word Bordeaux and what do you immediately say back to me. My friends fired back with “expensive” and “wine snob.” It got me thinking about the world of wine and how certain areas are perceived. Bordeaux has been given the distinction of having some of the best terroir in the world and therefore produce the best wines at a very expensive price. This myth, however, is only partially true. Bordeaux still has the distinction of having the best terroir and the best wines, but they don’t have to be out of the average person’s league in price.\n\nAlthough the elites are still around and still expensive, many have second label wines that are made with newer vines on the same terroir as their premier crus. These second label wines, unlike their expensive, older sisters, don’t have to be cellared for 10-30 years. They are meant to be enjoyed now. Of course, they are less polished, less structured and less complex but these second labels are no less drinkable.\n\nSo how do we know one of these second labels when we see them? Most often, the chateau’s name will not be on the label but the name will probably be close enough to reveal the winery. For example, I would love to buy a bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild from the Pauillac region of Bordeaux. But seriously, $750-$1,250 for a single bottle of wine is a little out of my price range. Instead I brought home with me Baron de Rothschild Reserve Speciale Bordeaux. With its delicate tannins, this Bordeaux is easy drinking and delicious at the affordable price of $12.99 a bottle. Ripe red fruit, especially cherry, with just a hint of vanilla from the oak made me feel like I was drinking an expensive bottle nonetheless. This 2009 Bordeaux has 70% Merlot and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon. It is soft, well-rounded with just enough acidity to go well with food. Roasted lamb would be my first choice but I know there are many out there that say no to lamb. So as a back-up choice I would suggest entre cote bordelaise, or in English, a steak that is topped with carmelized shallots.\n\nOther second label wines to look out for are Bahans Haut-Brion from Chateau Haut-Brion, Les Forts de Latour from Chateau Latour, and Pavillon Rouge du Chateau Margaux from Chateau Margaux. When I see these wines on the shelf I just grab them. You get the name of a big Bordeaux without the price tag that goes with it. These wines certainly take the expense and snobbery out of Bordeaux.\n\nThere aren’t many places I’ve been to that are as beautiful as Oregon is, especially in late May when almost everything was in full bloom. The weather was, as I was told by the locals, unusually nice for this part of the country with sunshine pretty much everyday. The city of Portland is a nice mix of city and rural wilderness with great hikes just a few subway stops away from downtown. After one of those hikes one day on a hot, sunny afternoon we decided to take advantage of one of Portland’s best brew pubs, Deschutes, where we enjoyed a sampling of what they had on draft that day. The highlight was definitely their 21st anniversary Barrel Aged Black Butte Porter, with a couple years age on it, was drinking real nice with those delicious, sweet bourbon notes.\n\nGoing out to dinner in City of Roses was awesome too, we never had a bad meal at any of the restaurants that we ate at. It seemed that all the places that we went to really focused on the farm to table concept and it really comes through in the flavors of the food. Everything from the cheese plates to the cuts of meat to simple sandwiches were all really fresh and flavorful whether it was served from one of the many food trucks or on top of a linen covered table.\n\nAfter a short day trip out to the coast to Cannon Beach and another hike along the coastline with views that can’t be described in words we made our way about an hour south to the Willamette Valley for a weekend in wine country. The hospitable folks over at Argyle Winery were gracious enough to host us in their guest house, The Nuthouse, a cozy house within walking distance to many great restaurants in Dundee. However if you go to Oregon Wine Country, go to the small town of Lafayette and go to Martha’s Tacos. A life changing experience and where a lot of the vineyard and winery workers go after a long day in the fields. We ordered a few menu items a shared every last bite, hands down one of the best meals I’ve had with the stand out being their wet burrito.\n\nOn our first full day in Dundee we started out with a full tour of Argyle. They are renown for their sparkling wines but as they told me and from what I tasted, you can’t make good sparkling wine without making good still wines first. And they sure make good wine. Sourcing their fruit from four vineyard sites in Willamette they make top notch Chardonnay and Pinot Noir and small amount of Riesling as well as some dessert wine. We happened to be there on the day that they were disgorging their 2001 Extended Triage Sparkling which was an absolute treat to taste something that is almost 10 years old and is just ready to be released. After going to the barrel room and tasting some samples of the 2010 vintage right out of the barrel, our tour had come to an end but the day of tasting had just started. The rest of the afternoon we drove to Carlton and around Dundee visiting wineries such as Lemelson, Carton Wine Makers Studio, Lange, Tori Mor and finished up the day with a glass of wine on Anne Amie’s patio overlooking the entire Valley. The only regret I have about this whole trip is that it was only a week long, I could’ve stayed for another couple weeks.\n\nThere are moments in life where food, wine and circumstances blend so perfectly you end up with tornado warnings and an impressive storm. Last night I took my fiancée to dinner at Aquitaine in the South End for his big birthday, had an amazing dinner and ended up with a spectacular light show outside the window.\n\nAquitaine has always been a solid restaurant for dinner, but last night I was able to see just how special they are. I had made my reservation using Open Table and simply asked for nice spot because I was celebrating a birthday. We arrived and were received warmly by the host. For me, having been in the restaurant business for 15 years, that was a big deal. I have been in places where the host is unpleasant and all I want to do is turn around and leave. Thankfully, Acquitaine recognizes that a welcoming host is the best first impression a restaurant can make. She sat us down in the back by the big window and put a birthday card down next to Matt’s menu. What a nice personal touch!\n\nOur server, Chris, was phenomenal. He wished Matt a happy birthday right off the bat, introduced himself and gave us a few minutes to decide on wine. He knew his menu, knew his wine and exuded a quiet charm and confidence.\n\nI, being obsessed with big Bordeauxs recently, chose the 2004 Chateau Compassant. From rising Bordeaux Star Jean-Luc Thunevin, the Chateau Compassant is a right bank blend of 80% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. Jean-Luc first came to fame with his “garage” Chateau Valandraud project, focusing on micro cuvees, and work on their vineyard to lower the yields and produce the ripest fruits possible. While Jean-Luc might be the new bad boy of Bordeaux, this right bank offering from just east of St. Emilion is very traditional with some earthy funk, luscious fruit, and firm tannins. This Bordeaux needed some air and by the time our dinners arrived it was opening up beautifully. An hour of decanting would have made this wine perfect from the start, but we didn’t have that kind of time. I let my glass breathe during our appetizer salads and when my steak frittes arrived all I could say was-delicious!\n\nAs Matt and I slid into the dessert course, I asked Chris for a recommendation for the Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse. The menu suggested the Graham’s Six Grape Ruby Reserve, which I have had and wanted something new. I asked about a cognac and he was quick to point out that the cognac would overpower the delicate flavors of my dessert. Chris said “Banyuls…that’s what you want.” Perfect. I am always happy when a server has a better suggestion. Matt quickly ordered his Crème Brulee and the Muscat de Baumes de Venise to go with it.\n\nWhat can I say? Our meal was heavenly, from top to bottom. The light show from the sky started during dessert and was the perfect ending. An awe-inspiring meal and an awe-inspiring act of nature. Happy Birthday Matt!\n\nSometimes it is just necessary to hang out with the co-workers outside of the office and last Thursday night that meant that a trip to the Marriot Copley Hotel for the Wine Spectator Grand Tour. For someone like me, who is new to the Bauer team, I was able to get to know Sue, Howie and John on a different level than I had in the store. I learned more about who they were as individuals (and no-I am not going to divulge any of their secrets to you!) and how they came to be the great people they are. It was nice talking to them on a more personal level, rather than discussing store events, inventory and sales. I definitely feel more bonded to them and, consequently, to Bauer as well. Although we did discuss the store to some degree, we mainly sipped and slurped our way through the 216 wines that were offered, laughing and joking along the way.\n\nSue and I bee-lined for Chateau Margeaux and Mouton Rothschild first. Legendary wines such as those needed my attention first as I have never had the chance to taste them before. Once we linked up with Howie and John, the four of us tasted Barolos, big California reds, Super Tuscans, Bordeauxs and more. Once our lips were stained red, we slid over to the white wines. Sauvignon Blancs and Viogniers delighted me. St. Urbans-Hof Weingut’s Spatlese earned a huge star…especially considering Nik Weiss was coming to Bauer the following day to have a tasting with us. BUT the big star of the night as far as I was concerned was the 1995 Femme Champagne from the Deval-Leroy winery. This was what Champagne was meant to taste like. Great acidity, complex, citrus-y with hints of marzipan and a yeasty biscuit flavor. This one stole the show from the big Bordeauxs.\n\nAt the end of this wonderful evening with my crew, I realized that most of you probably don’t know who I am because I am usually found in the office chained to the computer. If you visit our website site, I am the one who makes sure our products are current (and in process of a redesign that is more user friendly). You may have seen me in the store though, usually walking back and forth between the office and the counter with papers in my hand. I may have even rung up your purchases with smile. So perhaps it is time for me to formally introduce myself to you all. My name is Corinne and I\n\nam the Marketing Director. Hi. I came to Bauer about six weeks ago to take over their social media writing. So anytime you read our blog, get an email, visit Facebook or receive a Tweet, it is coming from me. It has certainly kept me busy and I love it. Most of my friends tell me I have the greatest job in the world; I can’t disagree. I taste and write about wine, beer and spirits for an amazing company.\n\nHi everyone! Now I know that having a cat in our store is something special but I never realized how special until Gris became ill on Saturday. Since then, we have had people everyday inquiring where Gris is because he is not in his usual spot soaking up the sun in our front window. So here is a quick rundown as to what happened to Newbury Street’s favorite working feline.\n\nGris developed bladder stones and had to be transported from the Back Bay Veterinary Clinic (BIG thanks to them) to Angell Memorial Animal Hospital in Jamaica Plain on Saturday. While his stones were serious, it hadn’t progressed enough to affect his kidneys. That has to be because of Howie, one of Gris best buddies. You know him as Howie Rubin, Bauer’s wine expert, but Gris also knows him as friend, feeder and ultimate hugger. Thankfully Howie noticed there was something wrong early on Saturday and brought him immediately to BBVC, who in their expertise, diagnosed him immediately.\n\nAfter a quick surgery at Angell to remove his stones, Gris was able to come home on Sunday but with some heavy pain medication. I don’t know if you have spent any time at home post-surgery, but it is enough to make anyone out of sorts. Gris decided that due to his drugs, discomfort and the need to use the litter box frequently it was best to move his bed to the back. We are letting him decide when he is ready to return to the front window. On an up note, Gris certainly doesn’t want to let his public down and does still come out to the sales floor to say hello.\n\nAll in all, thank you so much Back Bay neighbors for your concern about Gris and your support. Especially, a huge thank you to both Back Bay Veterinary Clinic and Angell Memorial for their quick response. You have no idea how much Bauer’s staff and clientele appreciates your taking such good care of our boy. It won’t be long before you see that adorable gray face in the front again!!! Trust me, Gris misses his fans as well!\n\nPerhaps I’m backwards. When it comes to planning a dinner at home or a meal at a restaurant I always choose my wine first and my meal to match second. In my wine soaked world, that makes sense. I stand in front of my 48 bottle wine rack or stare at the wine menu and ask myself “What do I want to drink tonight?” Yes, dinner is still important but my wine choice takes precedence. Don’t get me wrong, a meal where the wine takes center-stage does not mean that the food is an afterthought. It is just as important but when I am in a restaurant I often hear other tables ask to hang onto the wine menu until they make their dinner choices. I wonder silently if I am doing it all wrong. I am the girl who takes her first sip of a wine and based on that flavor profile, I make my dinner selection.\n\nWhere does this idea of wine and food pairing come from and is it really all that important?\n\nCountless sites on the Web pay homage to food and wine pairing and they always start with specific food and then talk about general wine varietals to go with them. Not a single one I looked at started with specific wines and matched them with food. Even within a specific grape varietal there is a vast difference in taste and aroma. I’m not just talking about country and region, but two vineyards next to one another can be so different. Is it snobbery to chose my wine first and plan my meal accordingly? Do waiters and guests consider it “showing off?” Probably but I am not playing at pretension, I just take my wine choice seriously.\n\nThe whole idea between wine and food pairing comes from the French. For centuries, the French drank their local wines with their local foods so they are choosy about which wines goes well with their specific recipe. But in today’s wine market, there is little reason to be that selective about your choices. There are literally thousands of great wines out there that will go well with your dinner.\n\nBut let’s get real. Opening a bottle of wine for each course when it is only the two of you just doesn’t make sense. Either there will be a lot of left over wine or two happily passed out people on the couch after dinner. Problem solved: half bottles. There is just two glasses in a half bottle, so having a multiple course meal with different wines is possible.\n\nLast night, once again, I pondered: what am I in the mood for? I chose a 2007 Argyle Wines Brut sparkling wine and paired it with a smoked salmon on brioche as my appetizer. I was really in the mood for a sparkling wine and I can’t think of any better that is on the market right now than the Argyle Winery Brut. The creamy texture and ripe citrus flavor melded beautifully with the smoked salmon and the acidity cut through the buttery brioche.\n\nFor the main course I opened up a half bottle of Argyle’s 2007 Reserve Pinot Noir. Even though it is technically spring, the nights are still chilly and a silky Pinot Noir was just what I needed for dinner. I let the wine breathe for a little bit while I put the finishing touches on my mushroom risotto. As I chopped up the fresh herbs to mix in, I couldn’t wait for that first taste of my selected wine. I made myself and my finacee a mushroom risotto from a recipe courtesy of my co-worker and wine guru, John.\n\nJohn’s Mushroom Risotto:\n\n6 oz of shitake mushrooms\n\n6oz of cremini Mushrooms\n\n6 cups of chicken stock\n\n½ cup of dry white wine\n\n½ of a white onion or shallots\n\n1 package of aborio rice\n\nChopped parsley, Thyme and chives\n\nButter\n\n½ cup of Parmesan Reggiano cheese\n\nBegin by mincing a small volume of onion, mushrooms and the other herbs.\n\nSauté the mixture in abundant olive oil or unsalted butter, and when it has browned remove it with a slotted spoon to a plate, leaving the drippings in the pot.\n\nStir in the rice and sauté it too until it becomes translucent (~7-10 minutes), stirring constantly to keep it from sticking.\n\nReturn the sautéed seasonings to the pot and stir in a half of a cup of room temperature dry white wine.\n\nOnce the wine has evaporated completely, add a ladle of simmering broth; stir in the next before all the liquid is absorbed, because if the grains get too dry they will flake.\n\nContinue cooking, stirring and adding broth as the rice absorbs it, until the rice barely reaches the al dente stage.\n\nAt this point stir in a tablespoon of butter and the grated cheese (if the recipe calls for it), cover the risotto, and turn off the flame. Let it sit, covered, for two to three minutes, and serve.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nI know that there are many out there who will think that I am crazy when I say this…but I am not a big fan of Chardonnay. In my defense, most of my experience with this varietal is the overly oaked, rich Chardonnay that California made so popular. Too heavy and too buttery for my tastes but I know plenty of people who will drink nothing else. Believe me, I have tried different regions, different countries but to no avail. This regal grape that is so beloved confounds me. The un-oaked Chards from France tickled my taste buds but I have rarely had one that made me stand up and WOW! Australian Chardonnay has good structure with peach and nectarine nuances, but still nothing that stood out. South African, Italy-I’ve tried them all in an effort to find a white grape that I love as much as Sauvignon Blanc. I know that certain foods would pair better with Chardonnay and therefore my quest continues.\n\nSo it makes me beg the question, is there a good in-between for someone like me?\n\nIn my research, I have found a real world solution to my Chardonnay dilemma and a dreamer’s solution. One I have tasted and the other…well, few can get their hands on it.\n\nIn reality, there are a ton of great Chardonnays on the market but I found one that a finicky palate like mine can enjoy. Rodney Strong’s Chalk Hill Chardonnay has sophistication with a hint of butter cream and vanilla from oak but yet is crisply acidic. This wine is well balanced with tropical fruit, pear and mineral elegance. The best part is that you get all the flavor of a 90-point rated wine on Wine Enthusiast for only $20 a bottle.\n\nRodney Strong’s Chalk Hill Chardonnay’s easy availability is another reason this wine is so great. But there is something about a wine that no one can get. A wine that is so exclusive that even when accepted to their mailing list, you still may have to wait 3 or more years before being invited to buy a bottle. No, these aren’t $200 bottles of wine, but a mere $65-70 a bottle. Aubert Wines in California is not about mass production. They average around 4000 cases a year and the Aubert label is not available in wine shops and very rarely in restaurants (one in California and one in NYC that I found). Although after some research I did manage to find an online wine store that sold their Chardonnay but at an inflated price of $150 and must have been obtained through questionable means. Although Aubert Wines produces four different Chardonnays: Ritchie, Lauren, Rueling and Quarry, the Ritchie is the one that intrigues me to no end. Tasting notes from both the winemaker and those lucky enough to have had it say that it is full-bodied but not excessive. Ritchie’s complex flavors range from lush fruit to a steel minerality. That sounds like it could be just what I have been looking for.\n\nAfter all my research, I put myself on the mailing list and can only hope that in 3 years time I will be invited to buy a bottle or two. Until then, I will gladly drink my Rodney Strong Chalk Hill Chardonnay with a smile."
