He believes that patients should play an active role in bringing about treatments for their own conditions, and that patients represent a largely untapped source of funding, energy, and know-how in the treatment development process. Josh was a freshman at Duke University studying environmental engineering when he was diagnosed with chordoma. Soon after his diagnosis, Josh joined the lab of Dr. Michael Kelley, a Duke oncologist studying the genetic basis of chordoma, and the only federally funded chordoma researcher. His research in Dr. Kelley’s lab included cell line characterization, gene-expression microarray analysis, candidate gene knockdown using RNA interference, and in vitro drug screening. To support his work in the lab, Josh switched majors to a self-designed bioengineering curriculum focused on modeling and solving biological “problems” that lead to disease. After finishing his junior year in May 2008, Josh was awarded a two-year Echoing Green fellowship for social entrepreneurs, and subsequently has taken a leave of absence from Duke to lead the Chordoma Foundation with Dr. Simone Sommer. To complement his work for the Chordoma Foundation, Josh has joined Duke’s Program on Global Health and Technology Access as a Fellow in Strategic Philanthropy and Health. In addition, Josh continues to participate in research in Dr. Kelley’s lab, and helps coordinate collaborations with a network of chordoma researchers at other institutions around the world. In school Josh received numerous honors and awards including the USA Today All-USA Academic First Team Award, Prudential Spirit of Community Award, CocaCola Scholarship, and AXA Achievement National Award.\n\nSimone Sommer, M.D., M.P.H., is president of the Chordoma Foundation, which she formed in February 2007 after her only child, Josh, was diagnosed with a chordoma in 2006.

Under her direction, the Chordoma Foundation has launched a coordinated international research effort that has invigorated the field of chordoma research. Dr. Sommer and her son Josh, who is now an Echoing Green Social Entrepreneur fellow, take an active role in every aspect of the research process by formulating research priorities, recruiting the best researchers, initiating new projects, brokering collaborations, and breaking down barriers to progress. Dr. Sommer is a graduate of George Washington University School of Medicine. She completed her internship at Duke University Medical Center and completed a residency and faculty development fellowship in family medicine at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.

Stead, M.D., is associate vice chancellor for health affairs and chief strategy and information officer at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He also serves as chief information architect for the university and as director of the Informatics Center. Dr. Stead received his B.A. and M.D. degrees from Duke University where he also completed specialty and subspecialty training in internal medicine and nephrology. As a faculty member in nephrology, he was the physician in the physician-engineer partnership that developed the Medical Record (TMR), one of the first practical electronic medical record systems. He helped Duke build one of the first patient-centered hospital information systems (IBM’s PCS/ASDS). He came to Vanderbilt in 1991 to work out how to link information to workflow to help people make better decisions at an enterprise scale. His team has shown how to translate techniques from the science of biomedical informatics into novel approaches to information infrastructure that reduce costs to implement and barriers to adoption. The resulting enterprise-wide electronic patient chart and communication and decision support tools promote his current focus on system-supported, evidence-based practice and research leading toward personalized medicine. Dr. Stead is McKesson Foundation Professor of Biomedical Informatics and professor of medicine. He is a founding fellow of both the American College of Medical Informatics and the American Institute for Engineering in Biology and Medicine and is an elected member of both the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and the American Clinical and Climatological Association.
