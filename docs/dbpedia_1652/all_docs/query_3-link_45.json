Thanks.\n\nThe Spirit of Justice: True Stories of Faith, Race, and Resistance Jemar Tisby (Zondervan) $29.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $23.99 RELEASE DATE SEPTEMBER 3, 2024\n\nI hope you know Jemar Tisby, PhD — the popular, if controversial, scholar / activist from Mississippi who has done great work educating church folks (and others) about American history and fighting racism. (Dr. Tisby’s PhD is in history from the University of Mississippi, an esteemed, Southern institution of higher learning and he has been an active Christian leader and spokesperson for racial justice for a long time. We respect him greatly.)\n\nTisby’s first book (and excellent, accompanying video curriculum), The Color of Compromise, explored the ways in which church people of various sorts compromised at strategic times throughout American history to accommodate themselves to the racial animus at the heart of much of the American experiment. It was well-researched, honest (about both the good and the bad) and a real wake-up call for those who may not have realized just how very implicated and complicit many Christian churches were to both overtly evil racism and more subtle sorts of institutional discrimination and systemic harms. It garnered some push back, I suppose, but was most very highly regarded. I helped lead an online group using the videos and it was a fabulous learning experience.\n\nThe second book picked up where the last chapter of The Color of Compromise ended, with the natural question of what we are to do; how shall we then live, to use Biblical language. It was called How to Fight Racism and was excellent. There is a video curriculum for that as well with a lively study/participants guide. How To…came out in 2021 (with a paperback release in 2023) and by then the harsh voices of the evangelical right were now on higher alert, making (foolish) public accusations that Tisby was a Marxist, that he was teaching a pagan sort of CRT, etc. etc. (Yes, as if you couldn’t guess, the sloppy, attack journalist Megan Basham makes an inaccurate statement about him in her recent, disreputable, Shepherds for Sale.) We have promoted Jemar’s work gladly here and we are grateful for his research, his prophetic clarity, and his steadfastness. You should order this book and support this brother.\n\nThe soon to be released, The Spirit of Justice is, in a way, a return to his first passion, telling the stories of the history of race and racial justice in the US. Pitched as a follow-up to The Color of Compromise, it is, in a way, the reverse: this is the story of those who stood up to be counted, who did the right thing. Just as there were those who perpetuated racist ideas and unjust policies, those who compromised, so, too, there are those who told a better story. There were those who created positive proposals, whose churches took stands, who raised the bar, paid the price, made a difference. These true stories are extraordinary examples of those who realized their faith demanded that they (in various ways in various places) agitated for justice.\n\nThe back cover gives one great reason why this book is so very urgent. It says:\n\nWhen the struggle for racial justice gets discouraging, history can give us hope. These true stories from the past will inspire you to keep up the fight.\n\nAs Tisby notes, “we cannot be passive in our efforts to learn the lessons from the past. We must recommit ourselves to gaining hope, inspiration, and wisdom from our ancestors…”\n\nThis historical survey covers a lot. There is some stuff about the colonial era, the pre-Civil War years full of colorful characters and abolitionists; this is all very, very interesting and inspiring. He moves to an era of “building black institution” and names leaders and organizations that were thrilling to learn about. He has the requisite (and always fascinating) stuff on King and the others of the largely faith-based civil rights movement. He names women, of course, all along the way, but has one chapter dedicated to “women of the movement.” His section on the latter days the civil rights movement (the late 1960s into the 70s) introduces us to amazing stories of the theologians like James Cone and political leaders like Shirley Chisholm, and the extraordinary Myrlie Evers-Williams who brought renewal to the troubled NAACP in the 1990s. I was only a little surprised and really delighted to see his tribute to famous Roman Catholic sister Thea Bowman. This guy knows his stuff!\n\nNear the end of the book Tisby looks at the rising generation of young Christian activists and writers (and, again, we were delighted to see that he honors Cole Arthur Riley and offers a sampling of some of the other great Black Christian writers who have emerged in recent years. His curation of who to highlight and his explanations about why they are important is beautiful.) All of this gives me great hope. I bet it will for you, too.\n\nA short review like this can only hint at the great amount of good content in this book, and we invite you to get it on your shelf as soon as possible. Sure there are other books on black history, even others on black Christian leaders. Not long ago I celebrated Awakening to Justice: Faithful Voices from the Abolitionist Past from the “Dialogue on Race and Faith Project” published by IVP Academic ($28.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $22.40. And just a day ago we got the brand new book Yonder Come the Day: Exploring the Collective Witness of the Formerly Enslaved by Jasmine L. Holmes (Baker Books; $18.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $15.19.) We’ve got so much to learn from our American past and the “great cloud of witnesses” of people of faith who have gone before are cheering us on. Let’s get on with it. Don’t worry if somebody calls you woke. This is a path for the righteous, and this soon-to-be-released book by Jemar Tisby will help us all. Highly recommended.\n\nThe Road to Wisdom: On Truth, Science, Faith, and Trust Francis S. Collins (Little, Brown and Company) $30.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $24.00RELEASE DATE SEPTEMBER 17, 2024\n\nI trust that you have at least heard of the great scientist, physician, public health leader (and exceptionally gracious Christian) Dr. Francis Collins. Known world-wide as an advocate for the disabled and sick (he discovered the gene issue that causes Cystic Fibrosis) and for a part of his public life was the director of the NIH program that was mapping the human genome. His work has been groundbreaking and he gives the credit to God for his abilities and for the ways in which science and medicine can be a blessing.\n\nHe wrote a lovely, powerful book about how the glories of science can point to God (The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief) and a popular-level but somewhat detailed study of genetics in 2011 entitled The Language of Life: DNA and the Revolution in Personalized Medicine. As his fame grew and he had more opportunities to share his faith with the watching world, and, importantly, colleagues in labs and research institutions, he put together a reader, a great collection of essays or book excerpts that presents the Christian faith for smart skeptics. (That fabulous anthology is called Belief: Readings on the Reason for Faith.) Eventually, his team successfully sequenced all three billion letters of our DNA. He went on to serve three presidents as the director of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nCollins was instrumental with a few other Christians whose vocations had them working in the field of science to start a think-tank and resource center that proclaimed a perspective on the integration of faith and science that is called BioLogies. Rejecting “young Earth creationism” for a more nuanced sort of Christian appreciation for evolutionary data, he co-authored a very helpful guidebook for understanding this congenial sort of Christian worldview that “thinks Christianly” about the task of science. It is called Language of Science and Faith: Straight Answers to Genuine Questions, published in hardcover by IVP in 2011.\n\nWhen Covid hit and the pandemic ravaged the world, his work increasingly became focused on public health; even though at one point 3,000 people were dying each day, some people (including those who identified as evangelicals) resisted taking precautions and we know many agitated citizens got very angry about the government’s efforts to mitigate the crisis. (My recent study of a handful of books about the rise of the far right and the militias and what led to the attack on the Capitol on January 6 of 2021 are connected to this.) It grieves me to think that one of the finest scientists and public voices of evangelical faith in our day has been maligned and attacked…\n\nAnd so, this forthcoming book is not only a sight for sore eyes — it has been a while since Collins has published anything new — but it was written from and speaks about these last hard years and into this cultural moment as wisely as anything I’ve read lately. Yes, there are stories of science and the ways in which we should or shouldn’t “trust the science” (and what that even means.) But besides his hope to reinvigorate a similar (if somewhat more generic) public conversation as has BioLogos about what science is and isn’t, The Road to Wisdom does something more profound: it is inviting us to question what we mean by truth. And how we might even get beyond the mere reliability of facts and data, to a deeper sense of truthfulness, something akin to fidelity, to deep knowledge, to wisdom. Yes, the title is apt: Collins sees these four components of his subtitle (truth, science, faith, and trust) as part of a path towards wisdom.\n\nIt is just lovely to see a book that has such a wide and prestigious list of endorsers. From cellist Yo-Yo Ma to Kay Redfield Jamison (author of the An Unquiet Mind) to Jennifer Doudna, the Nobel laureate who wrote A Crack in Creation, to the aging statesman former President Bill Clinton, to Philip Yancey who calls him “a national treasure.” Listen to Jane Goodall, certainly one of the most known scholars of our era:\n\nThis book should be read by anyone, Christian or non-Christian alike, who is seeking meaning or trying to make sense of our troubled times. — Jane Goodall\n\nThe Goodall quote is an indication of a few good things: The Road to Wisdom could be enjoyed by nearly anyone, regardless of their own faith or philosophical views. In a way, there is a bit in here on our deepest beliefs — what is truth is religiously-laden, of course — and his call to faith is potent but gracious. I’d give this book to anyone who is even mildly open to religious reading.\n\nBut, more, a bit of the book is about trust, and he mostly means trusting one another as a culture, as fellows in our land. He addresses our polarized society directly and he tells some tragic stories about the hostility he faced as he stood nearly at the center of the storm about Covid regulations, masking, vaccines, and more. I could write a review just on the penultimate “trust” chapter…\n\nThe last section is called “Hope and a Plan of Action.” I’ve read it twice. I will revise it again — it’s very good. It is not rocket science, and he could have gone deeper, but it is a lovely and powerful message, a good guide, a helpful plan for moving forward.\n\nThe book is dedicated “to the memory of my friend and spiritual mentor the Reverend Tim Keller.” Order it today and we’ll send it out promptly. Thanks for caring.\n\nTo Gaze Upon God: The Beatific Vision in Doctrine, Tradition, and Practice Samuel Parkison (IVP Academic) $30.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $24.00 RELEASE DATE SEPTEMBER 9, 2024\n\nI know not everybody who reads our BookNotes cares about hefty historical theology, but I was excited about this as soon as I saw it announced. The publisher entices us to work through this serious stuff — which has fabulous advanced reviews — by saying this:\n\nThough the doctrine of the beatific vision has woefully been forgotten in the church today, Samuel Parkison argues that the beatific vision is central for the life of the church today. Through close readings of Aquinas, Dante, Calvin, and more, Parkison reminds us of the beatific vision’s historical and contemporary significance.\n\nI’m very eager to see this and hope some of you may be, too. I just want to make one concern — not really a disclaimer, since I haven’t seen the book.\n\nOne of the things that has most transformed much of the best evangelical thinking and living these days has been a recovery of the full gospel story — which is the announcement of the Kingdom of God, inaugurated in Christ — and the trajectory that the Bible gives us towards the renewal of all creation. Since we are not going to spend eternity in heaven, but Christ comes down to be with us (see the last chapters of the Bible!) that is, since everything in life matters, we need a piety which embraces the spirituality of the ordinary and worldview that affirms our embodied, day-to-day living in a good, if broken, creation that is truly being restored in Christ Jesus.\n\nAlthough eschatology isn’t the most important matter in theological knowledge, I suppose, it could be argued that what we think of how our story ends, where we and history are going, what our lives are about as we hope in the future, decisively effects how we live now. And if we are right about what (just for instance) Richard Middleton so beautifully lays out in his major work, A New Heaven and a New Earth: Reclaiming Biblical Eschatology or, about what N.T. Wright invites us to in Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church, we will have a missional vision that is gritty and down-to-earth, seeing the connections between creation and re-creation, between incarnation and resurrection. All of life is redeemed as Christ Himself is glorified by summing up “all things in Himself” as it is allusively put in Ephesians 1:10. So I want nothing to distract us from our calling as stewards of creation and nothing to detract from the Bible’s own narrative trajectory of creation regained. Behold, it says at the end of Good Book, God is making “all things (re)new(ed.) Right? You betcha!\n\nNow the notion of the beatific vision, insofar as I understand it (which I probably don’t — another big reason why I’m eager for this book to release soon) is that we are caught up at the End with the beautiful vision of Jesus, upon whom we will gaze in extraordinary splendor. In heaven we will see Him face-to-face. What a hope! Who doesn’t want that?\n\nI do hope, though, that this author and his book, Gaze Upon God, does not pit one aspect of the true story of the whole world that says we will live in a renewed Paradise, enjoying God’s world as God wanted us to in the beginning, as if seeing Jesus somehow removes the context (what Al Wolter’s once called “the circumference”) of the scope of redemption. I hope it is not either/or but both/and (we see the glories of the new creation and we see God face to face, in the very face of Jesus.)\n\nSome who have taken great inspiration and have staked their very lives on a transforming vision from pondering the implications of a conviction about a (re)new(ed) creation (and the consequential affirmations of cultural duties and enjoyments in the creation that God so loves, here and now) have needed to get past an otherworldly sort of spirituality and an ethereal eschatology. Speculating about the rapture and fixating too much about heaven, have, in fact, crippled many of us and we have learned to resist such misguidedness. Rather, with a proper understanding of God’s story, we’ve championed books with titles like Heaven Is Not My Home: Living in the Now of God’s Creation by Paul Marshall and Heaven Is a Place on Earth: Why Everything You Do Matters to God by Michael Wittmer. Both of these, by the way, are by authors who love Jesus with all they’ve got and I’m sure are eager for his promised return to heal the “vandalization of shalom” that sin has caused.\n\nSo what should we believe about the mystical significance of this encounter with the face of God? What even is the beatific vision? Is it mostly a Roman Catholic thing? Can its insights and power and solace and hope be harnessed for more faithful living in these complicated days? I’m sure that Parkison will show us how a retrieval of this doctrine will inform our daily Christian lives. (In fact, see chapter 6 for this exact theme.) We must resist (as G-C professor Adonis Vida puts it, “a captivity to a pragmatist and naturalist understanding” of the nature of our faith and salvation. Perhaps this is — to draw the matter very broadly — part of our need to think about “re-enchantment” in a so-called secular age. Hmmm.\n\nHere’s the table of contents:\n\nWhat Is the Beatific Vision?\n\nBiblical Foundations for the Beatific Vision\n\nA Cloud of Witnesses, Part One: Pre-Reformation Historical Witness\n\nA Cloud of Witnesses, Part Two: Reformation and Post-Reformation Historical Witness\n\nRetrieval for Reformed Evangelicals\n\nThe Beatific Vision and the Christian Life\n\nPostscript: The Beatific Vision and Global Christianity\n\nIt makes perfect sense that one of the great ecumenical, historical, and dare I say sacramental theologians of today, Hans Boersma, likes this book and heartily commends it. Boersma says:\n\nThis is easily the best primer on the beatific vision today. Samuel Parkison’s scholarly yet wide-ranging treatment — Scripture, history, philosophy, theology — makes To Gaze upon God a valuable resource and accessible textbook. Grounded in a realist metaphysic, Parkison’s moderate Reformed approach judiciously encourages evangelicals to take seriously the tradition’s teaching on the transformative vision of God. Parkison effectively puts to rest the notion that the Reformation did away with belief in the beatific vision. Here is a book sure to rekindle our longing for happiness in God. — Hans Boersma, Nashotah House Theological Seminary, author of Heavenly Participation: The Weaving of a Sacramental Tapestry\n\nListen to Michael Haykin, a Baptist church history prof and scholar of the Puritans, who seems to anticipate my own concerns and makes me think that Gaze Upon God is not going to fall into the things I worry about (above.) It might have proven nice for author Sam Parkison, too, since he himself writes, as a Baptist, “Should I even be talking like this?” Ha. Check this out:\n\nThis overview of the history of Christian reflection on the beatific vision is an extremely important study, for it rightly reveals the central place that the hunger to gaze upon God has had in Christian tradition. But this is a hunger that far too many Western evangelicals in this ‘Secular Age,’ as Charles Taylor has termed it, seem to have lost and even rejected as pie-in-the-sky pietism. May this study be used by God to reawaken this hunger and so empower our witness to the ever-present God in this day! — Michael Haykin, professor of church history\n\nHey, one other nifty thing about this forthcoming title. The author — who has penned several other books on God, the Trinity, and such — is a theology professor in (get this): The United Arab Emirates. Did you even know there is a seminary there? Hooray for this.\n\nNIV Upside-Down Kingdom Bible edited by Preston Sprinkle (Zondervan)\n\ngray hardcover $49.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $39.99\n\ntan imitation leather $79.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $63.99\n\nWhen ordering don’t forget to tell us which edition you want.\n\nRELEASE DATE SEPTEMBER 10, 2024\n\nThe Zondervan company that manages the rights to the NIV translation does many nice study Bibles, and we stock a lot, from the seeker-oriented Quest Study Bible to the rigorously evangelical Biblical Theology Study Bible edited by D.A. Carson, from the excellent globally-minded Justice Study Bible to the gospel-centered The Jesus Bible, from the NIV Faith & Work Study Bible (where there is even a sidebar entry about me, believe it or not) to the lovely Encouraging Word Bible by Max Lucado, from the various artful ones that have room for coloring (Journal the Word for Woman, for instance) to the useful Cultural Background Study Bible. Of course, by far, the best-selling, classic study Bible is the NIV Study Bible which has been around for decades and updated several times. Each of these many study edition comes in hardback or softer, nice imitation leather-bound editions, so there are plenty of solid options.\n\n[And these are only some of the ones available in the popular NIV translation. Give us a holler if you want to know about other good translations, from the NLT, NRSVue, ESV, CEB, NASB, KJV or NKJ, or the Roman Catholic American Standard translation, among others. And we are fond of Peterson’s great paraphrase The Message. We have a lot!\n\nAnd now, one more in the NIV family of study Bible editions.\n\nThe NIV Upside-Down Kingdom Bible draws its name from a often-used trope in various quarters that God’s coming but not fully here yet Kingdom is “upside down” from the ways of this world. I’m pretty sure that Preston Sprinkle, who edits this multi-author, major Bible resource, read the classic on the Sermon on the Mount, The Upside Down Kingdom by Donald Kraybill, a remarkable book published by a Mennonite publisher, Herald Press, decades ago. I think of Kraybill’s provocative study whenever I hear the phrase, but I know it has been used by all manner of speakers and preachers. There is no doubt that it rings true: everything about Jesus’s ways is counterintuitive. Let’s hope the notes of this study edition bring that out, showing the alternative community God’s people are to be shaped into if we allow the unfolding drama of God’s Word to color and form our posture and imagination, our faith and our practice. I’m assuming the notes will be mostly centrist evangelical in their theological persuasion, using writers from a variety of denominations, informed by up-to-date scholarship without being overly critical or trendy. They promise to pick up on themes in the Biblical text that point us to ways we are to — as their marketing slogan puts it — “Think Deeply // Love Widely.”\n\nLike any good study edition the soon to be released Upside-Down Kingdom Bible will have hundreds of side-column notes, good introductions to each book of the Bible, full-page articles throughout. Zondervan Bibles uses a type font that has proven to be easy on the eye for sustained reading and this is in an 8.5 font. There is a two-color page design and ribbon markers.\n\nYou know that we believe that God calls believers to (as the promo for this study edition puts it) “live faithfully in a way that flips the wisdom of worldly kingdoms on its head.” We are excited about this one, for sure.\n\nI’m sure it will have textual notes that open up our understanding of a Biblical perspective on topics such as race and ethnicity, creation care, the arts, leadership and power, science, abortion, wealth and poverty, lament and grief, gender and sexuality, politics, baptism, singleness and friendship, technology, immigration, mental health, social justice, violence and warfare, and many others contemporary topics. Few study Bibles offer comment on big social issues of this sort and I’m hoping this will help some of us who are have developed habits/instincts of using a more personal sort of interpretive impulse to see how the Bible shapes even the most public and social of concerns. These notes and essays alongside the Scripture are all indexed in a large set of pages in the pack, too. Hooray.\n\nI haven’t seen it yet (and not everyone always agrees with Sprinkle, the team’s project overseer; for instance he has written a book about being committed to Biblical nonviolence, which puts him at odds with most evangelicals, and he is as gracious as he can be while still holding conventional views of sexuality and gender, which puts him at odds with most mainline churches that are inclusive of LGTBQ sisters and brothers.) I don’t know all of the contributors, but they will surely be men and women of depth and integrity. It’s a great idea for a study edition and we look forward to having it here at the shop soon. Here is what their marketing team says about it:\n\nIn a culture that has become exponentially polarized, it can be difficult to think deeply and love widely. The NIV Upside-Down Kingdom Bible provides readers with thoughtful, Scripture-based notes from a diverse set of trusted Christian voices and explores difficult issues facing Christians today, with features that are honest, nuanced, and filled with grace.\n\nThe Book of Belonging: Bible Stories for Kind and Contemplative KidsMariko Clark & Rachel Eleanor (Convergent Books) $24.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $19.99 RELEASE DATE SEPTEMBER 24, 2024\n\nThere are so many great new children’s books coming that it is hard to know what to highlight but we certainly want to celebrate this forthcoming release that already has considerable buzz. The Book of Belonging is (as they explain) designed for families seeking a Bible storybook that reflects the diversity of God’s people and for every reader seeking a more expansive and wondrous view of God. I don’t want to label it “progressive”, really, and many religious books these days feature a multiethnic caste of colorful characters. But the exceptionally thoughtful text and rich illustrations present “some of Scripture’s most important and overlooked stories — including many female-centered ones — alongside old favorites reimagined to convey greater inclusivity, diversity, and historical representation.”\n\nTaking a cue, perhaps, from the “wondering” approach of resources like “Godly Play” or the lovely children’s Bible Growing in God’s Love: A Story Bible by esteemed educators Elisabeth Caldwell and Carol Wehrheim, this Book of Belonging offers more than narratives, but and guided wonder moments, mindful practices, and other creative ways to engage the text of Scripture. With this theme of “belovedness” that appears, children will learn who God is and much about God’s heart and the fact of their being loved and delighted in. As the authors like to say, “When it comes to the love of God, everyone belongs.”\n\nThis gentle, gracious Bible story book offers forty-two Bible stories with aesthetically-pleasing colorful illustrations on every page.They would want you to know that the art showcases a variety of body shapes, ages, abilities, and skin colors and, also, uses historically accurate depictions of Jesus and God’s people, including original Hebrew and Greek names with historically accurate depictions. This is going to be great.\n\nHere is what the publishers tell us about the creators of this long-awaited resource:\n\nMariko Clark is a Japanese American author, mother, and storyteller on a mission to help kids embrace diversity and wonder. Her time as an editor with National Geographic Learning sharpened her ability to make complex topics accessible and engaging. She lives near Indianapolis where she equips kids and caregivers with spiritual resources to navigate the messy middle, wrestle with tough questions, and find community in the journey.\n\nRachel Eleanor is an illustrator known for doodles of questing travelers, friendly spirits, and all manner of creatures. She uses drawing as a way to explore the wilderness within and without, focusing on themes of spirituality and mindfulness. Her whimsical characters have inhabited books and stationery, championed brands, and even bedecked beverages. She lives in Atlanta.\n\nNRSVue Westminster Study Bible with the Deuterocanonical/Apocryphal Books (Westminster/John Knox) hardcover $55.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $44.00 RELEASE DATE OCTOBER 1, 2024\n\nIf the above NIV “Upside Down Kingdom” Bible has a contemporary feel, it is surely upbeat and useful for ordinary readers. It is not aimed at scholars or those that follow postmodern literary devices or critical theory. Although it is interdenominational, it will no doubt tilt evangelical and theological traditional.\n\nNo so, the Westminster Study Bible. I haven’t seen this, yet, either, but my hunch is that it will be geared to a much higher academic level (not unlike the NRSVue, the translation it uses, which is a tad more demanding to read, unlike the more colloquial NIV (or, even more so, the New Living Translation, say.)\n\nThe New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) has been the chosen translation in many mainline denominational churches for decades, so PCUSA, Episopalians, Lutherans, most United Methodist and UCC folks would all know this translation as their pastor’s preaching Bible. As of last year, the NRSV has itself been updated — the “ue” at the end stands for “updated edition” making it the NRSVue.\n\nNot only is this study Bible a bit more on the scholarly side, the social context of the interpreters and the theological persuasions of those writing the notes are, it seems, more mainline denominational and therefore more open to fresh, even critical, takes on the meaning of a given text.\n\nListen carefully how the publisher puts it:\n\nThe first entirely new study Bible to utilize the recently released New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition (NRSVue), The Westminster Study Bible includes interpretive materials from over eighty leading biblical experts who, as teachers in a variety of educational settings, are sensitive to how the biblical texts have been received, what their cultural and social consequences have been, and how readers might hear them now in multiple contexts. Paying close attention to interdisciplinary connections, contemporary students, teachers, and other readers from diverse backgrounds will find the WSB both useful and relevant.\n\nThey continue:\n\nThe key features of the WSB attend to the cultural impact of the Bible in its original setting as well as its impact on later readers and communities, up to and including the present day. Study notes open up the biblical texts and explore cultural insights from the ancient world as well as help readers to grasp how certain texts may have functioned in much later periods and far different settings. Together, these two points of access—back then and since then—allow readers to have a richer, fuller discussion about the meanings of the Bible.\n\nThere are plenty of articles and sidebars as well. Some of the pieces will be on topics such as:\n\nThe Bible, Gender, and Sexuality, The Bible, Race, and Ethnicity, The Bible and Social Justice, The Bible and Visual Art, The Bible in Film and Media, The Bible in Music, The Bible in Literature, The Bible in Museums, The Bible, Science, and the Environment.\n\nUnique, eh? And fascinating.\n\nThere are excursus topics, too, on themes such as “woman wisdom” and “Black and beautiful” and “Slut-shaming as Prophetic Discourse” and one called “Frederick Douglass, Paul, and Onesiumus.” Whether you are interested in questions about “the divine mandate to exterminate the Canaanites” or examples of feminine imagery for God or Revelation in popular culture, there are all kinds of these extra features to help readers grapple with how the Bible has inspired certain attitudes and practices and how maybe we need deeper conversation about what these texts actually say and how they can be faithfully construed.\n\nThere are nearly 100 ecumenical scholars who have contributed to this major new study Bible. The general editors are :\n\nEmerson B. Powery, Professor of Biblical Studies and Dean of the School of Arts, Culture, and Society at Messiah University\n\nStacy Davis, Professor of Religious Studies and Theology and Professor of Gender and Women’s Studies at Saint Mary’s College\n\nMary F. Foskett, Wake Forest Kahle Professor of Religious Studies and John Thomas Albritton, Fellow at Wake Forest University\n\nBrent A. Strawn, Professor of Old Testament and Professor of Law at Duke\n\nGo Forward in Love: A Year of Daily Readings from Timothy Keller Timothy Keller (Zondervan) $26.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $21.59 RELEASE DATE OCTOBER 1, 2024\n\nThis book will arrive late in September and since most of the world is just learning about it now, we are delighted to be able to assure you that we will stock it. We’re so grateful to get to write a bit about it here, now, and, of course, offer it at our BookNotes 20% off.\n\nI do not have to reiterate the importance of this eloquent, thoughtful, and widely-read, generous thinker. Keller was a pastor who came to a deeper faith during his college years here in central Pennsylvania and studied at Westminster Theological Seminary near Philadelphia. His own intellectual journey and that which most influenced him is beautifully explored in the fascinating biography by Collin Hansen, Timothy Keller: His Spiritual and Intellectual Formation (Zondervan; $26.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $21.59.) Keller was honored in a book of tribute testimonials (that are fantastic, by the way) called The City for God: Essays Honoring the Work of Timothy Keller edited by Ned Bustard (Square Halo Books; $24.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $19.99) and it is a book Tim saw before his death last Spring. He loved it, and so will you.\n\nIn any case, this new collection is compiled from selected excerpts of his many beloved works. Like most devotionals, it offers a thought for each day, on the many things he wrote about, from prayer to cultural engagement, from forgiveness to our callings in the work world. He has written about Bible characters, about evangelistic encounters, about social justice, about love for God and love for neighbor. He is known both for tender stories of grace (as seen in one of his most popular, The Prodigal God) and for rigorous, culturally-wise apologetics for the modern world, like in his important Making Sense of God. And, of course, there are pieces drawn from a book he wrote while dying of cancer on hope in the power of the resurrection. Once can hardly go wrong.\n\nSome folks may not have the time or energy or capacity to read through his many books which, while not academic, may be a bit more rigorous than many books on Christian living. This way to dip in to his body of written work in very short snippets is ideal. 365 days of Keller. Hooray. It would, it seems to me, make a great Christmas gift for anyone who might be longing for an intellectually respectable and yet deeply spiritual book.

Let us know your hopes.\n\nThe weight and destination of your package varies but you can use this as a quick, general guide:\n\nThere are generally two kinds of US Mail options and, of course, UPS. If necessary, we can do overnight and other expedited methods, too. Just ask.\n\nUnited States Postal Service has an option called “Media Mail” which is cheapest but can be a little slower. For one typical book, usually, it’s $4.83; 2 lbs would be $5.58. This is the cheapest method available and sometimes is quicker than UPS, but not always.\n\nUnited States Postal Service has another, quicker option called “Priority Mail” which is $8.70, if it fits in a flat-rate envelope. Many children’s books and some Bibles are oversized so that might take the next size up which is $9.50. “Priority Mail” gets more attention than does “Media Mail” and is often just a few days to anywhere in the US.\n\nUPS Ground is reliable but varies by weight and distance and may take longer than USPS. Sometimes they are cheaper than Priority. We’re happy to figure out your options for you once we know what you want.\n\nIf you just want to say “cheapest” that is fine.

There were creative books on the Christian life but before I listed those I briefly listed 10 very different kinds of books on sharing faith with others. I know using the “e” word (evangelism) doesn’t sell books, but at least I tried, right? Check it out and note how I explained the tone of each.\n\nThis week I’m in a bit of funk — it’s been going on a while, I know — in part because of my research into the history of the Republican Party and how the far, extremist right wing (many who are armed and dangerous) has infiltrated the party that was once known for traditional family values and the free market. For a variety of reasons that vex political scientists, social analysts, and contemporary historians the MAGA movement has become the ideological home for militias, border vigilantes, skinheads, the KKK and newer Trumpians like the Boogaloo Boys and the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters. How did that happen? What are we to do?\n\n(For those that wonder, by the way, I find no comparable infiltration of violent far left extremists into the Democratic Party. This is not to say that there is nothing to criticize about the Left or the Dems, but I am not, here, describing books about either Party. I’ve been reading for more than a year about the violent extremists found in unholy organizations such as the KKK and Aryan Nation and Oathkeepers. Black-masked (anarco-leftist) Antifa has been disruptive in some cities, usually countering the far right, but they have not been involved in party politics, as such. As far as I can tell Homeland Security are not documenting much of a threat from domestic terrorists on the left; in this era, at least, the threat is from the fringes of conservative moments.)\n\nIn this BookNotes I want to highly recommend several important books, including two riveting reads each about brave undercover cops who infiltrated these dangerous (and sometime murderous) extremist groups. These are fingernail-biting, page-turning books that will keep you up at night. I can’t say which is better so get ‘em both. They are both remarkable. Let’s start with those. And then we’ll explore another very different book called We Become What We Normalize by David Dark. As always, here, they are all on sale – 20% off.\n\nThe Hate Next Door: Why White Supremacists Are All Around Us — and How to Spot Them by Mason Browning, with his wife Tawny Browning (Sourcebooks) $17.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $14.32\n\nThis came out a year ago and I’ve just discovered it and I burned through it, staying up late on work nights, as I was so drawn in to his wild expose of the cult-like “changing face of hate.” A good-hearted Mormon cop becomes (with only minimal support from his PD) an undercover detective hanging out with various sorts of skinheads and neo-Nazis which lead him to ever more dangerous militias — some which were not necessarily driven by racism but were seriously anti-government and some who were explicitly racist, even organizing “hunting trips” to murder immigrants sneaking across the Arizona border. These seemingly fringe groups (well, not the skinheads) were often involved in Republican politics and had covers as community minded legitimate civic groups. These militas and their training camps (some affiliated with churches) were often overlapping with other White Power groups and Matt Browning, under a pseudonym, got to know most of the major players in the Western US. After eventually being outed, and having jailed many of the violent offenders, he and his wife became international experts, serving law enforcement all over the world about the growing scourge of hate groups.\n\nPart way through his career, when bumping into violent border militias or skinheads at the local Walmart, say, his wife got involved and became, curiously enough, an unofficial gatherer of intel. Tawny was serving as a producer of a TV series on fundamentalist Mormon cults that engaged in polygamy and was helping women and girls escape that scene when she realized the overlap — one of the reason a particularly fearsome cult of polygamists practice their incestuous worldview was to keep their “seed” racially pure. She was as passionate as her husband to study and learn and connect the dots of these groups. Together they had a front-row seat to the rise of White supremacy. From learning about the sorts of Doc Martens favored by real skinheads to the various symbols, tattoos, numbers, patches and slogans of the various iterations of the Klan or the militias, The Hate Next Door is eye opening, well told, and — at times — inspirational.\n\nInspirational? Browning works hard to be a good dad and husband and speaks about the stress of undercover work and the PTSD that set in as he lived with so much evil. He worries, still, about guys that got away, about murders he maybe could have prevented, about losing ground in the work to expose these dangers. He’s a good guy and there is a light touch as he chats about all this. There is even some humor. I’d like to meet this guy; after reporting about all the groups he infiltrated and all the tension, you feel like you know him. His writing style is super approachable. And I’d love to meet Tawni, too. If they made a movie of this I wondered who would play her?\n\nThe book offers some good advice near the end, offering wisdom on coping if you know somebody in one of these hateful cults. He ends with a balanced (if brief) treatment of attending Trump rallies and noticing “so many guns” — guns among the leftist protestors and, even more, among those with racist slogans and anti-Jewish sentiments in plain view. He recognized the tattoos and symbols and patches on many of the January 6 insurrectionists, proof that many who attacked the Capitol had extremist connections; he and his wife were on a first name basis with the head-dressed QAnon Shaman. (Browning is quick to remind us, by the way, that many fellow-citizens who think the 2019 election was rigged are not therefore racist nor necessarily violent.) He loves his country, he loves seeing the good in things, and yet he has this passionate calling to inform us about this crazy, alarming stuff happening, often under our noses.\n\nAt the Trump rally in Harrisburg a few weeks ago the local news team covered the large lines waiting to get in to the rally on an exceptionally hot day and had footage of those at the event before they entered the building. As often happens, happy folks mugged for the camera, knowing they’d appear in the background of the newscaster. One guy walked by and flashed an odd hand symbol. It was weird. Having read this book, I now know what it was; I have gone back and watched it over and over. Right at our central PA Republican Party event, there it was. I wasn’t shocked. Hate next door, indeed.\n\nWhite Robes and Broken Badges: Infiltrating the KKK and Exposing the Evil Among Us Joe Moore (Harper) $32.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $25.60\n\nHoly smokes, what a book. (It’s brand new – maybe you heard him on Fresh Air earlier this week.) Joe Moore is a fine, clear, writer. He clearly tells a story that I just couldn’t put down. Like the above-mentioned The Hate Next Door, it is a page-turner and one that I think is vitally important for us to read and talk about. I’ve mentioned before our own run-in with the Klan here at our shop in Dallastown, and although racist hate groups have changed much over the years, they remain the granddaddy of all the variations of hate groups. Like most of the far right groups, they hate blacks, Latinos, Asians, gays, Jews, Muslims, immigrants, and nearly anyone who does’t fit their view of conservative, American rightness.\n\nTheir story has been well told. You know about their rise after the Civil War and then their revival in numbers and hatefulness in the early 20th century. (One of the great, award-winning books we highlighted a year or so ago is A Fever in the Heartland: The Ku Klux Klan’s Plot to Take Over American, and the Woman Who Stopped Them by the great nonfiction scholar and bestselling author, Timothy Egan (Penguin; $18.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $14.40.) I suppose you know some Klan chapters — often called klaverns — view themselves as explicitly Christian. (Ahh, remember that book I highlighted last month called Another Gospel: Christian Nationalism and the Crisis of Evangelical Identity by Joel Looper – duh.) Some groups seem more taken by their anti-Semitism than being anti-Black and most use the Heil Hitler salute as much as their other secret codes, like KIGY. Many are willing to commit heinous acts of intimidation and perhaps murder.\n\nJoe Moore was an Army Special ops guy. He was a sniper and notes that he served in locations that are sealed and he may not tell us. Throughout the book he draws on his military training — skills of observation, ways to drive, ways to enter a room, and obvious hand-to-hand combat strategies. When he was working as a welder — coping with PTSD from what he suggests included the sorts of shootouts and killings you see on TV shows about spies that he encountered in special operations — he was recruited, almost out of the blue, by a Florida FBI guy. They asked him how he liked rednecks.\n\nSo begins his complex plan to become a Klansman which, in Central Florida, in this secret organization, it isn’t simple. The initiation ceremony (held out on a side road in the middle of no-where, near Lochloosa Lake, which made him think he had been found out and they were going to kill him) was described in detail as he became a Knight. This outfit was different than the Klansman we got to know in the amazing Everything You Love Will Burn: Inside the Rebirth of White Nationalism in America by Vegas Tenfold, who, as a left-wing journalist somehow got embedded in a whole gang of alt-right groups, including the guys who planned the infamous Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville VA. In that story some of the KKK guys were nearly bumpkins, as I recall, and their cross burning ceremony was almost laughable. Not so the armed men Moore was getting to know, who met under the Saltire Cross, the older mystic insignia of the KKK, also known as the Blood Drop Cross. Some guys were friendly enough, but Joe had seen Mississippi Burning that is based on the investigation of the 1964 murders of civil rights workers. He knew what these guys could do. And they had the firepower to back up the horrendous stories they told him.\n\nJoe’s awareness of makes and models of weapons certainly helped him earn cred within this new circle of brothers. He was often “carrying”, himself — he had no back up in this undercover work — but his appreciation for rare weapons (including old German pistols and handguns) made it clear that he could be an asset to the Klan. I won’t spoil all the details but he is assigned a major assassination attempt on a candidate running for US President that they especially hated: one Barack Obama. As the day approached they gave Moore a high-end Barrett M107A1 sniper rifle and he had to somehow figure out how to botch the job without his cover being blown. He had done all the necessary recon and various associates were going to be in place, including a getaway car with false plates gathered from a Klansman in the Department of Transportation. It was, as they say, down to the wire.\n\nAs it ends up, they did not kill Obama that day during the Kissimmee Florida campaign stop, he was soon enough elected, and the network of various sorts of Klansmen were elated. The election of our nation’s first Black President caused an immediate, almost overnight, increase in interest in the Klan. As the KKK learned the art of the deal (by using the internet and changing their image a bit) they recruited, in nearly every state of the union, hundreds and hundreds of angry, white men.\n\nI do not want to blow the story for you as it unfolds like a novel and you’ll be on the edge of your seat as he attempt to balance this real-world life of being undercover among serious haters — some redneck rural guys, some who went to church, maybe, and others who were fairly sophisticated workers in law enforcement, themselves! There is a reason Moore hates bullies and why he took this job so seriously. The book explores the interior life of such a detective and the psychic wear it does being around foul-mouthed and despicably hateful people much of his working days. That he had a wife and kids and was trying to keep them safe is part of the story. It doesn’t always go well, and, as you will see, there are issues with the feds, local cops, the FBI, and more. If only he had a pal like Matt Browning.\n\nJoe Moore gets out of the undercover biz for a while and, when an opportunity presents itself, he is sucked back in. There is family drama, concern about his kids, obviously questions about his safety and his mental health. The extended connection with border militias and white supremacy groups and KKK klaverns, who are not unlike the New York mafia families, is dreadfully stressful. His spy work put him in danger. (Did you know that when the government puts you into a witness protection program you can only take a limited amount of your stuff; family heirlooms, pictures, his children’s beloved toys were all lost as they were rushed to another state.) Moore’s passion to help expose these thugs.\n\nAs he puts it, “I watched a group that had long proclaimed itself he “Invisible Empire” gradually emerge from the shadows to unite the disparate forces that continue to roil this country today.”\n\nBest-selling author Brad Meltzer says “White Robes and Broken Badges is a gut-punch of a book… this is one you shouldn’t miss.”\n\nThe forward is by Congressman Jamie Raskin who was a member of the House Select Committee on the January 6th attack. He obviously knows much about these radical groups that have become part of a political assault on America. He compliments Joe Moore’s bravery, and notes that Joe shows how there are sheriff offices and police departments that allow the Klan to work and sometimes commit crimes with impunity. (Hence the “Broken Badges” of the title. That is a theme in The Hate Next Door as well.) Some of these groups have toned down their hate-speech a bit and have found welcome in the Republican Party which should be concerning to all Americans, but especially morally-serious conservatives. Moore, like Browning, is a military guy, a law-and-order type, and not particularly interested in liberal activists, let alone anti-police rhetoric or Marxist stuff.\n\nThey want the facts and they have risked their lives to bring us these dramatic stories. Moore, like Browning, is convinced we must know about the danger. There is much to learn.\n\nWe Are Proud Boys: How a Right-Wing Street Gang Ushered in a New Era of American Extremism Andy Campbell (Hatchette) $29.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $23.20\n\nI won’t say much about this because I’ve highlighted it before at BookNotes. It is a brave book, a book that tells exactly who this right-wing fight club is and what they are about. It starts with an exceptionally vulgar overview of the early cable show Gavin McInnes (founder of The Proud Boys) ran and how show after show he spewed anti-gay, anti-immigrant, anti-women, sexual politics, mocking men who did not live into his views about exceedingly toxic masculinity.\n\nIt is, as a former FBI special agent Ali Soufan puts it, “an investigative feat” and “essential reading for those wrestling to understand how homegrown extremist movements take hold and wreak havoc in America.”\n\nThis study of creeping fascism and violent extremism is so unbelievable it is almost funny at times — indeed, Vegas Tenfold, who knows extremist groups as well as nearly any reporter in America, says it is hilarious. I don’t know about that, it does explain how this movement with their cute little uniforms became popular among nationalists and more conventional white supremacists, and how they came to become enforcers for many in the MAGA movement and even the Trump campaigns. Beyond just normalizing street violence and crude attacks, they are endangering much of what we value as Americans. This book will be hard to forget.\n\nConsumed by Hate, Redeemed by Love: How a Violent Klansman Became a Champion of Racial Reconciliation Thomas A. Tarrants (Nelson Books) $18.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $15.19\n\nFor those who wonder how one can get out of the depths of the far-right worldview, I should remind you of an older book we have highlighted before, but that we still happily stock. It is written by a friend who I’ve admired for his kindness and grace and gentleness and his gospel-centered missional vision. Thomas Tarrants (formerly of the C.S. Lewis Institute in DC) writes in Consumed by Hate, Redeemed by Love of his own deep, dark involvement in anti-semitic and racist actions affiliated with one of the most violent of KKK chapters in the Mississippi Klan. You’ll have to read the almost unbelievable story yourself, but in 1968 Tom was arrested — after a bloody shoot-out — for attempting to bomb a Jewish leaders home. The short version is that Tom went to jail and while in prison started thinking and reading and he became a Christian. After many years his sentence was commuted and he ended up co-pastoring a bi-racial church with a black pastor. This book tells, as the subtitle puts it, “how a violent Klansman Became a Champion of Racial Reconciliation.”\n\nAnother book he wrote that is now out of print was done with his friend and mentor John Perkins, each pondering how they hated the other race and how God changed their attitudes. In this one, he more fully and candidly tells his terrible story and gives glory to the God who is able to change the heart and life of an extremist turned terrorist. What a story! Tom is quick to say that God’s work in his life is “undeserved mercy.” What a testimony!\n\nConsumed by Hate Redeemed by Love come with rave reviews and heartfelt endorsements. John Perkins, of course, has said much about it, including that it is “amazing.” Mark Batterson calls it “simply astonishing.” Os Guinness writes that, “…in showing how grace and forgiveness broke into his own life to give him a second chance, Tom Tarrants points the way for all who strive to rid America of this terrible scourge and the hatred that breeds it.” Exactly.\n\nListen to this from novelist John Grisham writes:\n\nAs a kid in Mississippi in the late 1960’s, I remember the men of our church discussing the Klan’s bombing campaign against the Jews. The men did not disapprove. Later, I would use this fascinating chapter of civil rights history as the backdrop for my novel The Chamber. Now, one of the bombers, Thomas Tarrants, tells the real story in this remarkable memoir. It is riveting, inspiring, at times hard to believe but utterly true, and it gives some measure of hope in these rancorous times.\n\nCherie Harder of the Trinity Forum beautifully notes:\n\nTom Tarrant’s extraordinary, often horrifying, and miraculous story offers both insight and instruction. He shows the ways in which hate warps the mind and corrupts the heart, as well as the allure of scapegoating and rigid ideology and the human carnage left in their wake. But this is ultimately a story of amazing grace — how one blinded by hate learned to see, to love, to reconcile. And it offers hope, showing the possibilities for the flowering of such grace, even on the cultural battlefields of our own riven land.\n\nThe Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War Jeff Sharlet (Norton) $18.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $15.19\n\nAgain, just a reminder of this eloquent, elegant, and expansive bit of reportorial courage that we have highlighted before. Highly acclaimed, it is not mostly about the KKK or skinheads; it doesn’t focus on high-profile Proud Boys or anti-semitic stars such as President Trump’s, on-again/off-again friend Nick Fuentes, but rather, ordinary people in small towns and seemingly inconsequential places. A master of the art of compelling, creative non-fiction expose, this is “attempting to capture the mood of the nation at this fraught moment, that others in the future may know how it felt to live through the present…”\n\nThe Undertow explores the religious dimensions of many who are unhappy with the culture as it is and are deeply troubled and troubling people. This is beyond what he explored in his books on “The Family.” As the back cover notes, Sharlet “journeys into corners of our national psyche where others fear to tread.” And yet this book isn’t only an expose of dark stuff. They say this book explores “a geography of grief and uncertainty amid rising fascism, and reckons with a decade of American failures — all while celebrating the courage of those who sing a different song of community, of an American long drama of and yet to be born.”\n\nAcross the country men “of God” glorify guns while citing Scripture and preparing for civil war. Political rallies are aflame with giddy expectations as religious revivals. On the Far Right every thing is heightened — love into adulteration, fear into vengeance, anger into white-hot rage. Here, in the undertow, our forty-fifth president, a vessel of conspiratorial fears and fantasies, continues to rise to sainthood, and the insurrectionist Ashli Babbitt, killed January 6 at the Capitol, is beatified as a martyr of white womanhood.\n\nJeff Sharlet has written for many major publications, teaches writing at Dartmouth, and had his book The Family turned into a popular Netflix documentary. What a glimpse this is of the “slow civil war” brewing, about which we should all be concerned.\n\nDemocracy and Solidarity: On the Cultural Roots of America’s Political Crisis James Davison Hunter (Yale University Press) $40.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $32.00\n\nOkay, we’ve highlighted this one before as well and we are pleased to have sold a few. But I wanted it on this list, even if it is different in style and tone than these other gripping page-turners described above. If those keep you up late waiting to see what the hell happens next, this might put you to sleep. But, no matter: keep trying to wade through this. It has been a struggle for me, I’ll admit, but I know enough to know that Hunter is always on to something. He does a major, academic, book about once a decade or so — his last was Science and the Good: The Tragic Quest for the Foundations of Morality (Yale University Press in 2018) but before that the much-discussed To Change the World: The Irony, Tragedy, and Possibility of Christianity in the Late Modern World on Oxford University Press released in 2010, I think.)\n\nDemocracy and Solidarity is not a boots-on-the-ground look at white supremacy or a memoir about investigating goons racists. It isn’t even a spicy survey of the vile stuff coming from the extremes these days, but, rather, it is a scholar’s deep search into the underlying currents that give shape to civic life within our Republic. Can our democratic ways be sustained, and if so, what is needed? For those who are alarmed by the far right, as we all should be, this will put it into a deeper, and perhaps, finally, even more alarming context.\n\nFrom various quarters, from the far right and the moderate right, to the moderate liberal view to the progressive left, there is a breakdown in shared assumptions about what makes our pluralistic culture tick. Can we renew the cultural assumptions of classical liberal democracy? Call it, as some have, a “sweeping history of American culture wars” or “a fresh and challenging interpretation of American in crisis”, this book is insightful and wise, a cry against the nihilism that seems to be an undercurrent of much of the breakdown of our discourse and shared values.\n\nIf you are the sort that likes to read one or two major, challenging books a year, this should be on your list. If you are a scholar, political scientist, professional theologian, or cultural critic, this obviously is a must. If you read the likes of Aaron Renn, Carl Trueman, Os Guinness, the late Jean Bethke Elshtain, Yuval Levin, Patrick Deenen or even Hannah Arendt, you should read Hunter. By the way, he thanks Tim Keller in the acknowledgments.\n\nI especially liked this paragraph from Democracy and Solidarity:\n\nAs it was at time of the Founding, so it is now: liberal democracy in the late modern world will not find renewal without the moral imagination to envision a public life that transcends the present warring binaries, and with it, a fresh vocabulary with which to talk about and pragmatically address the genuine problems the nation and the world face. It would be a renewed ethical vision for the re-formation of public life, for the institutions that sustain it, and for the citizens who put it into place. This vision would be embedded in a mythos that doesn’t deny the story of America, but reframes it toward what it could yet be. Democratic politics would not be that vision, as I say, but it would serve it all the same. To imagine it and to give it voice would require poets more than power brokers\n\n+++\n\nI am sure most of us have heard of neo-Nazis and other cult-like extremist groups and maybe have had first hand encounters. Certainly we know those who have fallen under the sway of conspiracies and far-out propaganda. (Just a day or two ago online I saw a comment on a friend’s Facebook page alleging the Democratic Party of sexual trafficking. Really??) It is hard to know what to do; certainly, despite Sharlet’s language of an approaching “slow civil war” we should pray for no government shoot-outs like at Ruby Ridge or the terrible horror of the government bombing of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas or the infamous police fire-bombing of the black MOVE headquarters in a Philadelphia neighborhood in1985. There has to be a better way (and one such way, centering the gospel of Jesus Christ to so-called Christian nationalists, is explained in Disarming Leviathan, which I have mentioned several times last month.)\n\nOf course, most of us just have to cope with ordinary relational conflicts, awkward conversations, daily questions of when to speak up and when to stay silent, how to care well for others and steward our own agency and use our moral compass in helpful ways. Maybe we are called to resist the Nazis and protest candidates who give them cover, but, for many of us, our fidelity will be less dramatic. Reading up about the dangers of the alt-right is an urgent matter for us all, I think, but pondering how to respond — beyond the obvious of being kind to all, trying to “speak the truth in love” and speaking graciously — is tricky. I think one way to consider that big question, one of the puzzle pieces, comes from the pen and big heart of a good friend, David Dark. The title of his book (which we’ve highlighted previously but would invite you to consider once again) is We Become What We Normalize. That is a phrase worth pondering.\n\nWe Become What We Normalize: What We Owe Each Other in Worlds That Demand Our Silence David Dark (Broadleaf Books) $26.99 / OUR SALE PRICE = $21.59\n\nThis is another book that we’ve highlighted before and yet I want to revisit again, here, now, too quickly. It is a book to read more than once and it is a book to ponder, maybe discuss with others. If the brave Joe Moore and Matt & Tawni Browning (above) are right that we must be vigilante and speak out against racism and anti-semitism and violent militias, and if the scholar Hunter is right that we need poets more than power-brokering pols in this fraying culture, then this book may be the life-line we need. It will poke and prod and — as a poet often does — make us scratch our heads. I can’t say that enough, and it is mostly a good thing; this book is a bit weird. In a good way.\n\nAnd there are so many great lines to underline, commit to heart. “Courage is contagious”, he says. Yup. Our “presumed consent functions as a free pass for abuse.” “In the land of the free, what do I owe people whose lives are endangered by my silence?\n\nI’ve alluded to this before and I trust it doesn’t scare anybody off. He uses some funny words and he writes creatively. He’s deeply rooted in popular culture and can cite Bono and Kendrick and his friend Jessica Hopper (we carry her amazingly thoughtful work, The First Collection of Criticism by a Living Female Rock Critic) and he goes on about Octavia Butler, who, among other things, was a highly-awarded a black sci fi writer. Ya dig? No, he doesn’t say that, but he does invite us to “slow your roll” and offers, in a beautiful section about Fred Rogers, what he calls a “psychic blast of care.” He recommends what he calls “observational candor.” He thinks basic self-respect demands of us that we, at least, “not disgrace oneself” by being aware of our “embodied particularity.”\n\nIs this thing on? Yes, he says that often, and explains exactly what he means.\n\nYa dig?\n\nHere is one of the provocative and vital chapter titles: “What Does Apocalypse Want From Me?” In other words, as he also puts it, we are called to “the prophetic task of naming what’s happening.” And ponder what it calls forth from us.\n\nYou see, what we allow to pass as speakable and acceptable will become normalized. Think of it simply: when we don’t protest a racist quip, racism becomes, or at least joking about racism becomes, acceptable. Normal. Our decision to not resist this has normalized it, for the room, and, perhaps — is this thing on? — for ourselves. Who is watching and listening as we make decisions? Certainly at least our own souls. David knows that as Biblical people we are called to conversions, to be transformed. We are called to be prophetic, to be open to the Spirit as the Spirit moves us to care for the common good, to create beloved community.\n\nHe is from the South, a former fundamentalist (and Limbaugh ditto-head, which he owns beautifully) and having discovered Southern folks like MLK and John Lewis, Clarence Jordan and Will Campbell, Fannie Lou Hamer and Wendell Berry, R. E. M. and Anthony Ray Hinton, plus a host of others who were religiously motivated agents of justice and goodness, he took into his worldview writers and activists from outside his culture of birth — Dorothy Day and Daniel Berrigan and James Baldwin and Larycia Hawkins, all agents of shalom.\n\nYou know me and my book-evaluating habits: I love seeing who informs the authors we commend and their footnotes are usually a good sign of how interesting the book is. David is a goldmine. He contains multitudes (a line he swipes from Whitman.) He’s a literature prof, too, so he knows his Jane Austin and his Thoreau and his Shakespeare. Just saying. Right next to LaBron James and rocker poet Pattie Smith. What a fun, fun book.\n\nThere is a method in the madness and it is this: we must learn to see the brokenness and the sin in ourselves and in our culture, and make wise decisions when and how to speak up against it. We become what we “sit still for” he says. What we “let slide.” We become what we abide and the culture reflects the very ideologies and bad spirits we allow free reign. To use the language of Berrigan, we must resist.\n\nAs Dark puts it, “Honoring and remaining fully alive to your own conscience is the human assignment.”\n\nCall it a postmodern riff on the old Edmund Burke quote about how all that really evil needs is for decent folks to remain quiet.\n\nAgain, what do we owe people whose lives are endangered by our silence?\n\nWe are, many of us, deeply aware of that, knowing we are implicated; wanting to be faithful, we may even be used to saying out loud what we think, of bearing witness, of letting our lights shine, but, David suggests, only up to a point.\n\nAnd then he notes,\n\n“Moving past that point is the risk of drama and the privilege of comedy. Both serve as a form of catharsis and both, at their most intense, can be difficult to categorize. …”\n\nThat is interesting, I think, but just an illustration of how he invites us to consider the arts — classic and contemporary, written or live — to help us see what we may not want to see. His own appreciation for artists and poets has helped him, and it could help us. (For a more conventionally written study of this, just for instance, see Mary McCampbell’s Imagining Our Neighbors as Ourselves: How Art Shapes Empathy Fortress Press; $28.00 / OUR SALE PRICE = $22.40. She too is a Southern Christian thinker who writes about the poppiest of pop culture and seriously classic European lit.)\n\nCan we grow? Can we learn about the violence poured out on the least of these, the way public figures have become complicit with abuse and injustice, how we have become complicit? Want to do something about the rising dangers explored in the above books? David notes, “We don’t want to know what we don’t want to know until we do.”\n\nThat’s why we do what we do here at the bookshop: we believe God’s Spirit is alive and well, inviting people, wooing people, to be so full of the awareness of the grace God gives and so full of regenerate wonder at the goodness all around — I don’t like Blake as much as David does, but I get it, a little at least —that we can’t help but sing along with “How Can I Keep From Singing?” We break out in awe and become something new, the new humanity of peacemakers (described so beautifully at the end of Ephesians 2, for instance.) Which means, maybe slowly, maybe suddenly, we now want to know more. We are ready to take new steps. We just can’t normalize the bad stuff any more.\n\nBad stuff within our own lives (perhaps our apathy) or that the complex sorrows and damages of the world.\n\nDavid gives us in this book a lot of stories, some wild speculations, his own vivid ruminations, some candid confessions about his mistakes and confusions. It is beautiful to see an outspoken voice for justice, a witty teacher who nicely embodies that old saying that good religion should “comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.” On Twitter and in this book Dark boldly calls us to confront the powers, even as he admits his own complicity and failures. That sort of honesty isn’t in every book you pick up, ya know. We Become What We Normalize is a very rare book, indeed. I am happy to recommend it.\n\nDavid uses two words that I wish he’d define a bit better — I’m slow, I guess, or not fluent in his spiel. I stuck with it and it all made good sense (so I guess he might say, what’s the problem, then? Fair enough.) But, still, a heads up. He talks a lot about being a reactive person or a responsive one. There’s a difference. One is not so good, the other is more richly human and humane and righteous. The goal of this book is to resist the shame and ego and fear and whatever else is causing us to be reactive and to “slow our roll” and consider our own lives, our own hearts, our own motives and concerns, and to be responsible humans, using our God-given agency, even on and in God’s good internet and what more formal guys call the public square. Can we do that? I suspect we all need some help.\n\nYou know that I’ve commended thoughtful tools for helping us be faithful in how we speak (a key component of a peacemaking lifestyle) that respects others well. Titles like Speaking Peace in a Climate of Conflict by the poet and writer Marilyn McEntyre, Love is the Resistance by Ashley Abercrombie, Six Conversations by Heather Holleman, Learning to Disagree by John Inazu, and the fabulous, one-of-kind Loving Disagreement: Fighting for Community Through the Fruit of the Spirit by Kathy Khang & Matt Mikalatos, are some of our favs that we suggest. These days we all need some extra skills in this area.\n\nBut We Become What We Normalize by David Dark is on another level — playful and creative, yes, deadly serious, indeed, full of humble stories and holding up heros who might inspire our own creative resistance. For instance, he tells about Bree Newsome, that brave woman who shimmed up that South Carolina Capitol flagpole and removed the pro-slavery rebel flag, “in the name of Jesus.” Yes, she was arrested, but so? She also made history.\n\nDavid also lifts up the testimony of Greta Thunberg, his own Sunday school teacher dad, Tami Sawyer (of Shelby County, Memphis, TN who campaigned to make more public a public park by removing statues of terrorist Nathan Bedford Forrest), the whistleblower Reality Winner, alongside the aforementioned Fred Rogers, and others who are, in his memorable phrase, “artisans of moral seriousness.”\n\nThere is one thing that I think I highlighted in the BookNotes review I did previously. I wrote about what may be his two most remarkable chapters. First, he describes how to be more discerning about what he playfully calls “White Supremacist AntiChrist Poltergeist.” That’s a mouthful and a headful and you’ve got to read it. What a chapter! (Later, he also names these as “reigning deceptions.”) Then he writes about what he playfully calls “Robot Soft Exorcism.” It is a bit odd but exceedingly curious in how it explains and explores what the Bible calls principalities and powers. (See Michael Bird and N.T. Wright’s recent Jesus and the Powers for a sensible, book-length treatment.) I like how in this chapter about exercising robots, David largely explores how to delineate the humans within the robots.\n\nTo be, as some put it, both pastoral and prophetic.\n\nHe writes,\n\nI wrestle not against flesh and blood. But I do get a little punchy with our reigning robots. I owe it to the flesh and blood within the robots to get punchy. I owe it to myself. This calls for discernment.\n\nWith enough care (breathing and speaking slowly) I can choose contemplation over projection, responsiveness over reactivity. I can gather my wits and remember, The robots aren’t people, but they do contain them. They, in fact, are powered by them…\n\nHe wants our engagement “to bend towards love.” He wants us to “address our fellow human beings as something other than their robots.” I don’t know any other book that struggles to make clear our complex contexts and milieu, laden as they are with idols and ideologies, in zeitgeists and social imaginaries, our decisions shaping institutions and bureaucracies, that then in turn shape (captivate?) us. Ha — you’ll be glad he doesn’t write like that! He does say “reactivity can’t drive out reactivity.” He doesn’t want “power-over” another, but shared humanness, “power-with.” It is not “us vs them.” “There is no them, as the healing mantra has it,” he says.\n\nA line to share from his chapter 6, a bit more than half-way through: “beauty prepares the heart for justice.” He writes movingly about the famous story of contralto Marian Anderson not being allowed to sing at a DAR event in 1939 when Eleanor Roosevelt gave up her spot among the DAR and invited Anderson to sing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for an integrated audience.\n\nNear the end of the book Dark quotes one of my favorite Wendell Berry books, Berry’s study of poet (and doctor) William Carlos Williams of Rutherford, New Jersey. Berry expands on William’s adage “No ideas but in things.” Again, this is granular.\n\nDid I mention that this book uses a lot of poetry and visionary stuff to make some very profound points? Or at least to raise up stuff that might become profound points for us? Bringing our most responsible selves into the world (“especially when we feel belittled, shut down, or silenced” ) is, again, as David suggests, “our most essential task.”\n\nHe closes the book with this great and hopeful and generous line: “Let’s have at it together.”\n\nWhat do you say? Order one today, please, and maybe spread the word.\n\n+++\n\nTO PLACE AN ORDER\n\nPLEASE READ, THEN SCROLL DOWN TO CLICK ON THE “ORDER” LINK BELOW.\n\nIt is helpful if you tell us how you want us to ship your orders.

If necessary, we can do overnight and other expedited methods, too. Just ask.\n\nUnited States Postal Service has an option called “Media Mail” which is cheapest but can be a little slower. For one typical book, usually, it’s $4.83; 2 lbs would be $5.58. This is the cheapest method available and sometimes is quicker than UPS, but not always.\n\nUnited States Postal Service has another, quicker option called “Priority Mail” which is $8.70, if it fits in a flat-rate envelope. Many children’s books and some Bibles are oversized so that might take the next size up which is $9.50. “Priority Mail” gets more attention than does “Media Mail” and is often just a few days to anywhere in the US.\n\nUPS Ground is reliable but varies by weight and distance and may take longer than USPS. Sometimes they are cheaper than Priority. We’re happy to figure out your options for you once we know what you want.\n\nIf you just want to say “cheapest” that is fine. If you are eager and don’t want the slowest method, do say so. It really helps us serve you well so let us know.

You can read the whole story and my discussion of the book by finding the last BookNotes here. (All of our previous BookNotes are archived at the website, by the way.)\n\nThe book, as I explained in great detail in last week’s BookNotes, clearly and with great pastoral care, critiques the unBiblical ideologies behind the extremist, often conspiratorial, far-right wing in American politics these days. Not unlike the new N.T. Wright paperback (Jesus and the Powers: Christian Political Witness in an Age of Totalitarian Terror and Dysfunctional Democracies) it asserts that while good Christian folks can disagree about any number of policy recommendations and party affiliations, nowadays, much of the Republican Party in the US has become implicated in what must be named as ethically unacceptable views of race and economics and governance and truthfulness and has failed to distance itself with some exceptionally bad actors (from former President Trump’s friend (of infowar fame) Alex Jones, who viciously accused the families of murdered children at Sandy Hook of being involved in a hoax, to the guy with the proud Nixon tattoo, Roger Stone, to those with violent intentions (like the KKK and the Proud Boys and several popular militia groups) even to — my God! — holocaust deniers. The book is about that sort of extremist ideology that is an important part of the MAGA movement these days.\n\nI tried hard in my big essay last week to explain that I do not think that all conservatives are part of the monstrous “Leviathan” that Campbell describes when he exposes the cult-like vibe of QAnon-tainted Christian Nationalism. Not at all. I’ve held multiple party affiliations in my own years as a citizen and most serious Christians, I am sure, are fully aware that they may not personally endorse every plank of their party’s platform, let alone like every person who is a media celebrity or political operative for that party. Maybe not even their primary candidate. Granted.\n\nStill, I recommended another new book Another Gospel: Christian Nationalism and the Crisis of Evangelical Identity by Joel Looper (now out from Eerdmans) who does a careful reading of Pauline texts about not falling for a false gospel to show how so-called Christian Nationalism could be understood not as a tawdry, alt-right sort of populism nor as a legitimate Christian political option as an acceptable part of a Christian worldview, but as a false gospel. Looper is a conservative evangelical, a Bonhoeffer scholar, and theology prof at a Baptist university and his assertion of heresy is profound.\n\nDisarming Leviathan agrees, but Campbell writes as a brokenhearted pastor who has realized that some of his flock have simply gone off the deep end, confusing their former faith with MAGA ideology and fear-filled, politicized activism. This phenomenon of allowing the faith to be co-opted by political / cultural forces has been a constant threat in America — Reinhold Niebuhr wrote about it in several chapters of Christ and Culture in 1951 — but it has not been seen so weirdly with such vigor, in my lifetime. (You know the news, stuff one can hardly make up like the prayer of the Shaman during the Capitol riots and the President who pays off porn stars and uses tear gas to disperse protestors so he could get a photo op at a church he doesn’t attend, getting blessed by prosperity preachers.)\n\nPastor Campbell realizes, and explains in his new book, that having more gracious “common ground” conversations and being more civil so we learn to disagree well (as important as that is) isn’t enough for a time such as this.\n\nFolks who have lost their way need to be called to faith, back to their first love (if they once were Christians) and, in any case, to Christ-centered discipleship. Serious social science shows that, oddly, many who self-identify as evangelicals in the polls who are fans of the MAGA movement are, in fact, often not familiar with basic Christian doctrines and rarely go to church. The very word evangelical has oddly come to stand for a certain sort of extreme politics similar to what we used to call civil religion, on steroids. While the political polarization concerns us all, Rev. Campbell wants us to see Christian Nationalists mostly as an unreached people group (as missionaries call such subcultures) and for us to learn how to be caring evangelists of the gospel. As I said last week, there is no other book like it.\n\nThis week I’d like to list a handful of books that I think can be transformative for those who need to hear a fresh articulation of the true gospel in a way that is profound, deep, serious (and readable.) I’ve shortened the list to just twelve, each a winner in its own way, books that might grab you or someone you are in discussion with. But first, ten books on evangelism, quickly highlighted for you, since that was the main point of Disarming Leviathan.\n\nFIRST, TEN BOOKS ABOUT EVANGELISM\n\nDisarming Leviathan is remarkable in suggesting that the answer to some of the problems plaguing our culture is introducing folks anew to the gospel of Jesus Christ and His Kingdom. Which is to say, evangelism. He gives some helpful advice, and the last chapters of that book are wise and dear.\n\nI thought it might be helpful to name just a few more that go into more helpful detail about sharing the gospel. Many of us are not terribly well-practiced at this and we understandably shy away from anything that seems pushy. While these are not set in the context of the various political ideologies of our culture, they are books that could inspire almost anyone. Talking about faith and “telling a better story” is a perennial question yet it seems especially urgent now. Anyway, here are a few — if you haven’t read in this genre, any of these would be a good start. ALL ARE 20% OFF.\n\nGrowing Your Faith by Giving It Away: Telling the Gospel Story with Grace and Passion York Moore (IVP) $17.99 // OUR SALE PRICE = $14.39\n\nI appreciate this older book that invites us to grow in our own faith by learning to articulate it, share it graciously, invite others to receive God’s gift of salvation. The chapters are short, there are good stories, and exceptionally helpful extra books and resources recommended. The second half has remarkable insights about sharing the gospel with “those who don’t like you” and another on sharing with “those you don’t like.” Ha. This covers a variety of settings and invites us all to stretch a bit for the sake of loving others well. York is a friend and a thoughtful leader; I like this book a lot.\n\nEvangelism: Doing Justice and Preaching Grace Harvie M. Conn (P&R) $10.99 // OUR SALE PRICE = $8.79\n\nIf you read the very interesting recent biography of the late Timothy Keller (Timothy Keller: His Spiritual and Intellectual Formation by Collin Hansen) a good number of books and authors stand out. You won’t miss Harvie Conn, a Reformed thinker and missionary (who ministered among abused women in the sex industry in Asia back in the 60s.) He came back to Pennsylvania and taught a very wholistic, Kingdom-centered view of evangelism at Westminster Theological Seminary which particularly caught Keller’s attention. This little book emerged from Conn in those years and it is astute and visionary, passionate about living out the gospel by caring for people’s lives. It is sophisticated in bringing together “word and deed” and yet not overly complex. As he notes, evangelism includes the ministry of listening and serving as well as speaking. As we used to say in those days we must “meet people where they are.”\n\nAs Harvie put in it his classic little preface:\n\n“My prayer is that this book will not emerge as one more exercise in blackboard evangelism, one more excuse to learn a little bit more and do a little bit less, to keep off the streets and out of the kitchen. May it direct us to the streets and not, pray God, to the study.”\n\nOf course he was teaching this in an exceptionally rigorous academic community (so he didn’t object to time in the study) but his heart for others and his ground-breaking, wholistic, missional theology was captivating. Could this old book stimulate a new generation to be more passionate about both justice and grace, about word and deed?\n\nOut of the Saltshaker and Into the World: Evangelism as a Way of Life Becky Pippert (IVP) $22.99 // OUR SALE PRICE = $18.39\n\nThis is one of the most read and beloved Christian books of the last 50 years. It is not hard to read but it covers a lot (it’s over 300 pages) and I’d say it is a true classic. I hope you know it. She spoke at our Pittsburgh Jubilee conference decades ago and we at Hearts & Minds hosted her here for a series of workshops in our early years. She is charming and alert, a clear, thoughtful writer, and loves good stories. She is confident we can share the gospel easily with others if we just do it and suggests that folks are actually more interested than we realize.\n\nPippert’s more recent one is called Stay Salt: The World Has Changed: Our Message Must Not (published by Good Books; $16.99 // OUR SALE PRICE = $13.59) and it is very good, too. I highly recommend it. The late Timothy Keller wrote:\n\nOut of the Saltshaker was one of the most important books on evangelism written over the last generation. Stay Salt may be the best book on witness for the next generation. I don’t know of a more lucid or penetrating book on evangelism to put into the hands of a Christian.\n\nQuestioning Evangelism: Engaging People’s Hearts the Way Jesus Did Randy Newman (Kregel Publications) $19.99 // OUR SALE PRICE = $15.99\n\nRandy, who sadly died about a month or so ago, used to work for Cru in the DC area; we crossed paths several times and he was a gem of a guy — a great, funny, thoughtfully well-read, Christian leader. (His last book offered lessons from C.S. Lewis on evangelism, cleverly entitled Mere Evangelism.) For years, years ago in his evangelism with college age students, he had a fairly simplistic approach, clear and earnest, and he led many to make a profession of faith in Christ. Then a few decades ago, seemingly suddenly one year, it just didn’t work any more. Students were aloof or disinterested or would agree with everything he shared about God’s love and Jesus’s sacrifice, and, yet, walk away. He was ready to give up campus evangelism and he wrote this book as a way to rethink how to share the good news, mostly around asking questions and listening well. It’s the perfect sort of postmodern turn away from easy answers and formulas to remind us of the social context of seekers and to ask good questions. He is “questioning” old styles of rigid and simplistic evangelistic tactics and he is replacing them with earnest conversation and listening well. We carry all of his interesting books and we recommend them all.\n\nThe Invitational Christian Dave Daubert (Day 8 Strategies) $9.99 // OUR SALE PRICE = $\n\nI enjoy mentioning this small book from time to time because it is so winsome and useful (and short, making it ideal for a small group study or adult class or for an outreach committee.) For those who don’t read heady theology or missional theory, it’s a fabulous little read.\n\nHere’s what’s unique about it. Dave is a Lutheran who has worked as a mainline church consultant for years. He knows his way around older, mainline churches — our buildings, the styles of our life together, our worship, our financial anxieties, our concerns. Further, while many of the books on this list are about engaging others in conversations about God’s love and Christ’s Kingdom, about personal faith and conversion, this is less about inviting people to faith and discipleship but about inviting people to church.\n\nLet’s face it: that is a big ask for many of us but, frankly, a little less intimidating than inviting them to receive Christ’s grace anew and commit to trusting him. Yep, this is a simple book inviting people to become invitational even as their congregations form that sort of ethos. As our local congregations become hubs of meaning and purpose and service and spiritual renewal, it’s natural to want others to join in. With lots of stories from original research and great Bible and discussion questions after each chapter, The Invitational Christian is a very nice book about being more invitational, and why things might be holding us back. Can ordinary churches that are pretty non-dramatic learn to be more invitational in ways that truly recruits folks to join in our (admittedly low-key) fun? Yes, yes indeed. This book can help.\n\nTrauma-Informed Evangelism Cultivating Communities of Wounded Healers Charles Kiser & Elaine A. Heath (Eerdmans) $19.99 // OUR SALE PRICE = $15.99\n\nI hope you saw my longer review of this when it first came out. We commended it, glad for how it integrates a trauma-informed instinct, and is so deeply aware of the hurt people carry in their very bodies and how often bad religion has been part of their deep pain. Many are scarred and scared and reluctant to trust those who dare to speak of God or the church when they have been hurt, demeaned, maybe even traumatized by less than gracious encounters with toxic faith.\n\nNaturally this includes those who have walked away from faith, including some who have done so reluctantly, out of self-preservation. For instance, this book asks how we can gently share good news with LGTBQ persons and others that have been shamed and mocked and rejected. This is not a simple book (it explains what we mean by trauma-informed psychology and struggles to understand what evangelism has been and could be) and it invites an expansive and generous alternative to the sorts of messages that too often seem to carry shame and rejection. This is about caring and appreciating “Christ’s own relatable human suffering.” There is much to ponder here.\n\nTongue-Tied: Learning the Lost Art of Talking About Faith Sarah Wenger Shenk (Herald Press) $16.99 // OUR SALE PRICE = $13.59\n\nKudos to Herald Press, a Mennonite publisher that has released some very provocative, thoughtful, culturally-engaged, and surprisingly fresh books of late. I wrote about this when it came out a few years ago, noting that it really does invite us to think about the words we use to describe our faith and how to regain a refreshing sort of vibrant way to describe theology and truth and Bible and spirituality. There are no cliches, no easy answers, and her lovely project is both prophetic and sophisticated and yet so very down-to-earth and caring, so much that Walter Brueggemann says it is a “wise, much-needed book.” Indeed.\n\nPerhaps our most tender faith stories are really love stories, she suggests, and amidst polarizing cultural arguments, maybe this is just what we need: deeper conversations about our shared humanity and things that matter. Words made fresh.\n\nAs it says on the back cover, we don’t need to “relearn Christianese or brush up on churchy cliches. We need a language of faith that is authentic, candid, and robust enough to last.”\n\nLearning to Speak God from Scratch: Why Sacred Words Are Vanishing–And How We Can Revive Them Jonathan Merritt (Convergent Books) $17.00 // OUR SALE PRICE = $13.60\n\nHere is another that observes that many in our post-Christian culture simply don’t know anything about church or Christian faith and we have less of a need to convince them of its truth but to invite them into a sense of belonging to a story they’ve never really encountered. But how can we do that when the words we have learned to use to explain our faith and our convictions and our experiences are themselves unfamiliar to our post-Christian friends?\n\nSometimes (at least in many sophisticated urban areas) folks know our words — grace, sin, gospel — and they are turned off. Our God-talk (fairly or unfairly) has less than “good news” connotations. How do we learn to speak a faith language from scratch? Jonathan (raised a preacher’s kid in a Southern Baptist culture is now a New Yorker and an occasional writer for the Atlantic) has learned a thing or two about this. His story is fascinating.\n\nAs we all know, to further complicate things, not only is there sometimes negative baggage, sometimes people may truly not know what our “sacred” words mean. Other words they simply haven’t heard. For some, I’m guessing especially in middle America, they may be inoculated against them, too familiar with the lingo so as to fail to realize their stunning brilliance. How do we rethink how we talk about faith? As the old hymn puts it, “what language can I offer?”\n\nThere’s a very nicely written foreword by Shauna Niequist, an artful writer who knows well this quandary of using words in fresh ways.\n\nIn a time when thoughtless opinions run rampant, Jonathan uses his brilliance to help us think better. He is a masterful writer, who has a gift for language and communication. How fitting that he would use his gifts to help us communicate on the highest level! — Lecrae Moore, two-time Grammy winning hip-hop artist, author, I Am Restored: How I Lost My Religion But Found My Faith\n\nFool’s Talk: Recovering the Art of Christian Persuasion Os Guinness (IVP) $24.99 // OUR SALE PRICE = $19.99\n\nI did a long review of this one when it first came out, noting how exceptional it was; Dr. Guinness is an amazingly smart and erudite scholar and social critic (who is related to the Guinness beer people and thinks deeply about vocation and calling and business and society.) This is the most sophisticated, important, serious study of how to actually convince others of things, and, also, is one of the most detailed and fresh takes on serious apologetics I’ve ever read. It’s quite a book, thoughtful and profound, drawing on insights from three huge influences on his own life and thoughts over the years: C.S. Lewis, Francis Schaeffer, and sociologist Peter Berger. These were important writers who Guinness reports were the three most important figures in his own faith formation. In a way, he spent most of his life preparing to write this magnificent book.\n\nFools Talk is informative and wise. It attends to cultural forces and the plausibility of conversation with folks and reminds us of the importance of the power of persuasion, never coercion. It insists that the gospel of grace must always be presented gracefully. It is very highly recommended.\n\nMany Christian leaders and ordinary readers have said to us that it is one of the most influential books they’ve ever read. Here is a nice blurb (among many) that captures some of what it is about:\n\nIn a day when Christian apologetics seems to win battles but lose wars, when evangelism is abandoned by the church and biblical strategies are ignored, Fool’s Talk by Os Guinness is necessary and vitally important. Insightfully, he not only guides in the use of wit and weightiness, but also restores winsomeness to the art of communicating Christ. He teaches the reader to ‘relativize the relativists’ and build on the ‘signals of transcendence’ with brilliance. He acknowledges his debts to Peter Berger, C. S. Lewis, Francis Schaeffer, G. K. Chesterton and many others. Readers will be indebted to Guinness for the syntheses and wisdom we have come to expect from him. The benefits of the past are freshly and insightfully applied to the present. All people need to know they are deeply loved and forgiven by God. Fool’s Talk will better equip us to tell them. I heartily endorse this book. — Jerry Root, professor of evangelism, Wheaton College, aut"
