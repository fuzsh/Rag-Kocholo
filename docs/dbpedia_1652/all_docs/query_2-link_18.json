        "text": "Amy Domingues is an ardent performer, whether it be on the cello, viola da gamba, baryton or vielle. Her early career honed her ensemble skills as a session cellist, recording and touring with rock and experimental bands in the USA, Europe, and Japan. Later, armed with a relentless interest in music history, Amy turned her focus to the viola da gamba. She holds a master’s degree in Historical Performance (Viola da Gamba) from Peabody Conservatory and has performed in masterclasses for Wieland Kuijken, Paolo Pandolfo, and Philippe Pierlot. She appears with groups as varied as The Valencia Baryton Project, The Folger Consort, Hesperus, and The Washington Bach Consort. Amy is a founding member of Sonnambula (Ensemble in Residence at the Metropolitan Museum of Art 2018-2019). She is an avid educator, maintaining a private studio of cello and gamba students, and has served as faculty at the Madison Early Music Festival and the Conclave of the Viola da Gamba Society of America. She appears on over 70 albums in multiple genres, most recently Sonnambula’s world premiere of Leonora Duarte’s Sinfonias (Centaur Records). She is a multiple recipient of the District of Columbia Commission on the Arts and Humanities Fellowship Grant as well as grants from the Viola da Gamba Society of America for teaching and performance. Amy resides in Washington, DC with her husband and two cats."
