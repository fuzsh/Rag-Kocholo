        "text": "Matthew Bengtson (piano) has been an active recitalist: he gave 14 performances from August to November 2023 in locations ranging from Busan, South Korea, to New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Apart from modern pianos, he has performed on copies of 18th-century Viennese pianos and Romantic pianos from Pleyel and Blüthner. The repertoire has been wide-ranging and diverse, running from William Byrd through the sons of JS Bach, to Mozart, Schubert, and Chopin, to a full program of all contemporary works, including a premiere of Roberto Sierra’s 13th piano sonata, written for him.\n\nColleen Conway (music education) was the keynote research presenter for the Gordon Institute for Music Learning in Chicago in August 2023 and presented two papers last fall at the Society for Music Teacher Education, one with three current PhD students and the other with three recent PhD alumni. She recently contributed the foreword to Teaching Instrumental Music: Perspectives and Pedagogies for the 21st Century (Oxford, 2023). Fall 2023 also included a residency at the Ohio State University. Conway continues to be the faculty coordinator for the Crescendo Detroit Pathways program, which brings 40 K-12 students to the Ann Arbor campus on Saturdays.\n\nCelebrating 15 Years of Center Stage Strings\n\nCenter Stage Strings (CSS), led by faculty director Danielle Belen (violin), will be celebrating its 15th anniversary in summer 2024. CSS attracts over 70 young artists from across the country to study and perform on campus during an intensive four-week program focusing on solo and chamber music. Belen founded CSS in 2010 in Three Rivers, California, growing the family-run program to become one of the foremost summer destinations for string players, eventually joining the roster of MPulse Institutes at the University of Michigan.\n\nAntonio C. Cuyler (entrepreneurship & leadership) moderated “Truth-Telling: The Kinship of Critical Race Theory & Hip Hop” during the 2023 DEI Summit, and “More Than 8-Mile: Detroit’s Quest for Hip-Hop Glory” at the U-M Detroit Center. He presented papers in Canada, Chile, Denmark, Ghana, and Poland, and at the International Conference on Cultural Economics, International Congress on Qualitative Inquiry, and the Social Theory, Politics & the Arts conference. He led a plenary at the Chorus America conference and presented at the League of American Orchestras conference. OPERA America invited him to join its board. He will moderate a panel for the Lyric Opera of Chicago on its production of Champion.\n\nIn September 2023, Aaron Dworkin (entrepreneurship & leadership) released a unique recording of poetry, The Poetjournalist, which captures the tapestry of our diverse society through the lens of a MacArthur Fellow, author, filmmaker, and social entrepreneur. This collection explores six overarching pillars – African American history, the arts, the power of women, identity, mental health, and childhood – through the unique prism of poetjournalism, a term originated by Dworkin, in which a news story or other experience is expressed in poetic form, incorporating elements of emotion, opinion, and creative illustration.\n\nKate Fitzpatrick, associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs and associate professor of music, recently contributed to the development of a white paper for the National Association for Music Education, “Blueprint for Strengthening the Music Teacher Profession,” which focuses on increasing access and removing boundaries to music teaching. Her research article, “Motherhood in the Music Academy: Perspectives of Early, Mid, and Late Career Faculty,” appeared in the January 2024 issue of the Journal of Research in Music Education. This year, Fitzpatrick will be presenting her work at the Symposium on Music Teacher Education, the Michigan Music Conference, and the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association.\n\nVIM VIGOR, the dance company of Shannon Gillen (dance) was commissioned to premiere PUNCHLINE at the b12 festival in Berlin, Germany, in July 2023. This latest work was co-choreographed by VIM VIGOR member and SMTD MFA student Jason Cianciulli and also involved collaborator Tzveta Kassabova (theatre & drama). PUNCHLINE had its US premiere at the Arthur Miller Theatre at U-M in September before touring to New York City for sold-out performances at Gibney Presents. Gillen was also commissioned to create new work for Vassar College this fall and will travel to Reykjavik, Iceland, in April 2024 to choreograph new work for the Iceland University of the Arts.\n\nArtists Join Amy Chavasse for Arts & Resistance Theme Semester Events\n\nAs a recipient of grants from U-M’s Arts & Resistance theme semester, along with support from the Center for World Performance Studies (CWPS), Amy Chavasse (dance) was able to invite an illustrious slate of nationally and internationally recognized artists to campus in fall 2023: Al Evangelista, a queer Filipino performance artist and activist, and two renowned choreographer/performers from Hong Kong – Terry Tsang King Fai and Jay Peng Zhang. The artists conducted residencies in Chavasse’s “Performance Practice” class, and on November 4, Tsang King Fai and Peng Zhang joined Chavasse and BFA dance alums Stephanie Gennusa and Rowan Janusiak for a performance in the Dance Performance Studio Theatre. The production, soul / over / encounter, included guest performances by Michael Gould (percussion) and percussion graduate student James Koo. Chavasse performed a new solo, Death in Dreams, and presented her 2019 duet, Plunder Thunder. Tsang King Fai and Peng Zhang also presented their work and research at the Keene Theater, sponsored by CWPS. Additionally, they visited Malcolm Tulip’s “Creating Original Theatre” class and had the opportunity to collaborate with guest artist John Jarboe. “An embarrassment of artistic riches,” Chavasse said, “only begins to capture the excitement this past semester brought.”\n\nRealized from a manuscript written by concentration camp prisoners in Auschwitz I and researched by Patricia Hall (music theory), “Chinesische Strassenserenade” (Chinese Street Serenade) was performed by SMTD students, along with nine other Auschwitz arrangements, in a series of concerts in May 2022. The Zone of Interest, a feature film that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2023, includes the audio of SMTD students’ Ann Arbor performance of “Chinesische Strassenserenade” in its soundtrack. The Zone of Interest, which the BBC described as “Jonathan Glazer’s Holocaust masterpiece,” won the Grand Prix at Cannes and was nominated for five Academy Awards, including a nod for Best Picture. SMTD has published an album of several of these arrangements, Music from Auschwitz, on Spotify. A performance of these works by SMTD students will take place in Britton Recital Hall on May 7, 2024, preceding a European tour. Hall was interviewed for a PBS NewsHour segment about her efforts to preserve the music performed by prisoners in Auschwitz.\n\nCaroline Helton (musical theatre) and her co-author, voice DMA alum Emery Stephens, proudly announced the publication of Singing Down the Barriers: A Guide to Centering African American Song for Concert Performers. Released in July 2023 by Rowman & Littlefield, the book is a resource for voice teachers, voice students, collaborative pianists, and all who have questions about approaching, centering, and amplifying the foundational contributions of African American creators to the fabric of American vocal music. Stephens and Helton also serve as core faculty with Louise Toppin (voice) and Christie Finn for U-M’s Singing Down the Barriers Institute, a summer program for singers and pianists.\n\nHaving performed the world premiere of Miguel del Aguila’s Concierto con brio with clarinet alum Ryan J. King and the Michigan Philharmonic in October 2023, Nancy Ambrose King (oboe) subsequently performed that work with the Indianapolis Chamber Orchestra. She presented master classes and/or recitals at University of Missouri–Kansas City, Indiana University, Butler University, and Grand Valley State University. She returned as faculty of the Round Top Music Festival, Sarasota Music Festival, and Michigan City Chamber Music Festival. Celebrating her 20th year as a Sarasota Music Festival faculty, King was featured in a profile interview. She served as adjudicator for the Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestras Young Artist competitions.\n\nCurrent and Former Students Join Tyler Driskill for Kerrytown Concert\n\nTyler Driskill (musical theatre) presented a program highlighting lesser-known songs of Johnny Mercer at Ann Arbor’s Kerrytown Concert House on November 17, 2023. Joining him were SMTD graduate Olivia Hernandez (who can be seen on Broadway in Adam Guettel’s Days of Wine and Roses) and current SMTD students Kate Cummings, Annie Hayes, Carly Meyer, and Diego Rodriguez. The concert was the first in a series celebrating Great American Songbook writers; the next program, in May 2024, will feature the lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein II.\n\nMarie McCarthy (music education) presented several sessions at the National Symposium on the History of Music Education held in Normal, Illinois, and was an invited speaker at the NAfME National Leadership Assembly held in Reston, Virginia. She serves on the 70th Anniversary Committee of the International Society for Music Education, and as external examiner for music education at the University of Limerick. In September 2023, she hosted the second workshop in the Phyllis Kaplan Leadership Series in General Music at SMTD. She is author of the chapter “Centering Black Music, Culture and Education in the Decades Leading up to Brown v. Board of Education” in Milestones in Music Education (Routledge, 2023).\n\nDance professor Fangfei Miao’s Chinese translation of her article “Mis-step as Global Encounter: The American Dance Festival in Reform Era China” was published in Contemporary Research in Dance, China’s leading dance studies journal, in January 2024. She invited Kate Jewett, rehearsal director of the world-renowned Shen Wei Dance Arts, to have a residency at the Department of Dance. Miao served as a panelist for “Dance Transcending the Demonic Woman: A Performance and Conversation with Yasuko Yokoshi” by the Center for Japanese Studies, and she invited the dance master Yasuko to teach workshops on Japanese traditional theatre at the dance department.\n\nAndy Milne (jazz & contemporary improvisation) composed the score to the CBC-TV documentary Black Life: Untold Stories. He also contributed arrangements and compositions to Showtime’s sharp historical epic miniseries Fellow Travelers and served as the show’s musical director. Milne’s newest recording, Time Will Tell, will be released in 2024. He is currently collaborating with SMTD alum Carlos Simon, who earned a DMA in composition, contributing orchestral arrangements for the John Coltrane: Legacy project, premiering with the Toronto Symphony in 2024.\n\nEllis and Hall Honored with Teaching Awards\n\nIn November 2023, SMTD named John Ellis (piano) and Patricia Hall (music theory) as the recipients of the 2024 SMTD teaching awards. Ellis has been named the recipient of the 2024 Harold Haugh Award for excellence in studio teaching; this award is named in honor of Haugh, former professor of music and a leading oratorio soloist. As specified in the award guidelines, Ellis will present a recital and lecture during the fall 2024 term. Hall has been awarded the 2024 SMTD Teaching Excellence Award, which recognizes outstanding teaching in any SMTD department.\n\nProfessor of organ and carillon Tiffany Ng‘s summer 2023 performance of organ works by Sarah Davachi drew an at-capacity crowd at the Sunnuhvoll Festival in Iceland. She also made concert and master class appearances at York Minster, England; Berlin, Germany; and Porto, Portugal. During the fall, she performed the rededication recital of the newly expanded carillon at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and made carillon and organ teaching and concert appearances at Berea College, Kentucky. For the 63rd annual U-M Organ Conference, Ng, Joseph Gascho (harpsichord), and Nicole Keller (organ) performed the world premiere of TIME PLAY for organ, harpsichord, and carillon, by Roshanne Etezady (composition).\n\nIn September 2023, René Rusch (music theory) published a new book, Schubert’s Instrumental Music and Poetics of Interpretation, with Indiana University Press. The book draws on a range of philosophical, hermeneutic, historical, biographical, theoretical, and analytical sources as a means to explore the poetics of contemporary analyses of Schubert’s instrumental music and propose new ways to engage with this repertoire.\n\nAmy Porter Celebrates 25 Years of Teaching at SMTD\n\nAmy Porter (flute) celebrated her 25th anniversary teaching at SMTD in September 2023. She performed the Sonatas and the Attributions by J.S. Bach with Joseph Gascho (harpsichord) and Leo Singer, who earned a master’s degree and DMA in cello at SMTD. The complete recital can be found on the SMTD YouTube channel.

He also performed at Edgefest, an annual avant-garde music festival in Ann Arbor. Rush led his 16th student trip to India last summer, and he led an all-campus development event on creativity with President Santa Ono.\n\nLast summer, Ed Sarath (jazz & contemporary improvisation) traveled to Manaus for the Brazilian premiere of his five-movement work, His Day Is Done, for orchestra, choir, and soloists. The Amazonas Philharmonic performed the piece, which featured NEA jazz master Regina Carter as well as South African legend Dizu Plaatjies, both of whom also joined Sarath in a performance with the newly formed Global Jazz Collective. Sarath’s newest book, Music Studies and Its Moment of Truth, was published as part of the new Routledge/CMS series. In the coming months, Sarath will launch the International Consortium for Academic Societal Transformation, predicated on an arts-driven revolution in creativity and consciousness.\n\nSMTD Wellness Program manager and lecturer Paola Savvidou – along with Sarah Erlewine, marketing & communications director for ticketed performances, and Becky Olsen, academic advisor – has received the LaVaughn Palma Davis Wellness Committee Award through MHealthy for work promoting faculty and staff well-being. Savvidou has been invited to deliver the keynote address on mental health in the music lesson setting for the Music Teachers National Association Collegiate Symposium. She will also co-present with Kristen Schuyten (dance), SMTD lecturer and physical therapist, on the topic of screening university dancers for injury at the National Dance Education Association Conference.\n\nJeremy Sortore (theatre & drama) presented on recent pedagogical innovations at the joint conference of the Voice and Speech Trainers Association and Centro de Estudios para el Uso de la Voz in La Paz, Mexico, in July. In August, he spoke on two panels at the Association for Theatre in Higher Education conference in Austin, Texas, and co-led a two-day workshop in Fitzmaurice Voicework in Toronto, Canada.
