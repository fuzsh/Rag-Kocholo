The impact of his bi-racial upbringing and its divergence in the home guides his creative process. He currently resides in Utah and shows his work in regional, national, and international exhibitions. Fidalis is an Associate Professor of Art and Brigham Young University.“My work represents identity seen through the complexity of American culture and South Pacific traditions - calling attention to confrontations and conflicting realities; straddling the line between levity and earnest devotion. My work is a self-portrait seen through forms of expanded and contracted narratives. Image making is a ritual performed through playful conjuring – reassembling personal histories and inventing mythologies laden with fear, anxiety, dreams, revelations, magic, and mysticism.”\n\nSterling Clydesdale. Inspired largely by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat, as well as many other iconic artists lost to time, I’ve married silk screening, solar printing and graphite portraiture with mixed medias to create unique pop culture pieces. Speaking to the LGBTQ community and addressing mental health stigma through my artwork, most of my subjects are of lost icons - people who made their mark during their time here on Earth but also of those still here, blazing a path and being a change. I am inspired by people and what drives them and our faces will always tell such a tale. I enjoy dabbling in expressionism and abstract - playing with my love for color. Telling my story and the stories of others one piece at a time - hoping to leave a mark in history.\n\nGregg Deal is a husband, a father, an artist and a member of the Paiute Tribe of Pyramid Lake. As a provocative contemporary artist/activist and 15 year resident of the DC metro area, much of Gregg’s work deals with indigenous identity and pop-culture, touching on issues of race relations, historical consideration and stereotype.
