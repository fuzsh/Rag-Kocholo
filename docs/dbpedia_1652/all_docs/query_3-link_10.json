        "text": "Measures for Justice (MFJ) is a Rochester, New York-based nonprofit that collects, organizes, and publicizes criminal justice data from around the United States. Founded in 2011 by attorney and journalist Amy Bach, MFJ received funding from the Bureau for Justice Assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice for its first large-scale data collection expedition in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. MFJ also receives funding from numerous left-of-center philanthropies, including the MacArthur Foundation, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the Pershing Square Foundation, Open Society Foundations, and the Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation.\n\nResults\n\nAccording to Measures for Justice, its work grew out of in-person research conducted by Amy Bach for her book examining the U.S. criminal justice system. MFJ’s pilot program began with a $50,000 grant from the U.S. government to collect criminal justice-related data in a single Wisconsin county, gradually expanding to cover the entire state. It has since grown to more than 1,200 counties in 20 states.\n\nAccording to Bach, MFJ is intended to be nonpartisan. In fact, its communications director Fiona Maazel stated, “We don’t infer something or give explanations…. our hope is that people do the due diligence required to get to the bottom of what the numbers are suggesting.” Nevertheless, the data presented sometimes display a racial and socioeconomic dimension. For example, one author pointed out that in Florida’s rural Wakulla County, data showed that non-white offenders with no prior violent criminal history who are convicted of nonviolent felonies received prison sentences at nearly four times the rate of white offenders.\n\nIn another study conducted in Alabama, MFJ noted that those considered “indigent,” and less likely to be able to afford fines and court costs, were also 30 times more likely to be forced to pay those costs instead of having their cases “diverted” through non-judicial processes.\n\nOne data set from its Wisconsin study showed that poorer defendants were often unable to afford even low bail costs, resulting in longer detention over weekends and holidays. As a result of MFJ’s intervention, Winnebago County, Wisconsin shifted its rules to allow judges to release some of these defendants without requiring a prosecutor to present a probable cause hearing.\n\nData Portal and “Commons”\n\nIn 2017, Measures for Justice launched a data portal on its website that displays various criminal justice statistics across 20 states. MFJ also launched the pilot version of its community-accessible “Commons” project, which provides more detailed, local statistics by county.\n\nThe pilot program, launched in Yolo County, California, was preceded by a study conducted by MFJ and the Stanford Criminal Justice Center, which suggested a deliberate lack of transparency in California’s data reporting procedures, as reported by Los Angeles Times.\n\nAs part of her plan to increase data transparency in Marin County, California, local district attorney Lori Frugoli announced in April 2022 that she would be collaborating with MFJ and intended to request funding to launch a Commons portal for that county. Further Commons for Louisiana and New York are planned.\n\nFlorida Legislation\n\nIn the fall of 2017, Florida state Rep. Chris Sprowls (R-Palm Harbor) invited Amy Bach to present the results of Measures for Justice’s years-long data collection in Florida. The information presented spurred Sprowls to successfully advance legislation in 2018 that would eventually require all 67 of Florida’s counties to collect and standardize data according to the parameters developed by MFJ. MFJ also supported similar legislation in California, which was enacted in 2019.\n\nLeadership"
