        "text": "Asher B. Edelman Professor of Composition, Bard College-Conservatory of Music\n\nJoan Tower is widely regarded as one of the most important American composers living today. During a career spanning more than sixty years, she has made lasting contributions to musical life in the United States as composer, performer, conductor, and educator. Her works have been commissioned by major ensembles, soloists, and orchestras, including the Emerson, Tokyo, and Muir quartets; soloists Alisa Weilerstein, Evelyn Glennie, Carol Wincenc, David Shifrin, Paul Neubauer, and John Browning; and the orchestras of Chicago, New York, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Nashville, Albany NY, and Washington DC among others. Her recent commissioned premieres include the cello concerto A New Day, the orchestral 1920/2019, and the chamber Into the Night.\n\nIn 2020 Chamber Music America honored her with its Richard J. Bogomolny National Service Award; Musical America chose her to be its 2020 Composer of the Year; in 2019 the League of American Orchestras awarded her its highest honor, the Gold Baton. Tower is the first composer chosen for a Ford Made in America consortium commission of sixty-five orchestras. Leonard Slatkin and the Nashville Symphony recorded Made in America in 2006 (along with Tambor and Concerto for Orchestra). In 2008 the album collected three Grammy awards: Best Contemporary Classical Composition, Best Classical Album, and Best Orchestral Performance. Nashville’s latest all-Tower recording includes Stroke, which received a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Classical Composition.\n\nIn 1990 she became the first woman to win the prestigious Grawemeyer Award for Silver Ladders, a piece she wrote for the St. Louis Symphony where she was Composer-in-Residence from 1985-88. Other residencies with orchestras include a 10-year residency with the Orchestra of St. Luke's (1997-2007) and the Pittsburgh Symphony (2010-11). She was the Albany Symphony’s Mentor Composer partner in the 2013-14 season. Tower was co-founder and pianist for the Naumburg Award-winning Da Capo Chamber Players from 1970-85. She has received honorary doctorates from Smith College, the New England Conservatory, and Illinois State University. She is Asher B. Edelman Professor in the Arts at Bard College, where she has taught since 1972.\n\nProfessor of Composition, The Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute of Music\n\nAmy Beth Kirsten, “…one of America’s most innovative and visionary composers,” (BBC Music Magazine, March 2019) has cast herself in roles as varied as composer, librettist, vocalist, filmmaker, and director and is currently composing new works for Sandbox Percussion, the Bergamot Quartet, and Alarm Will Sound. She has been recognized with awards and fellowships from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Barlow Endowment for Music Composition, the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the Koussevitzky Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation. An obsession with ‘composed theatre’ – an alchemy of storytelling fusing music with all the theatrical stage has to offer – has led Ms. Kirsten to create works that delight in a variety of subjects from Shakespeare’s Ophelia, to Don Quixote of La Mancha, to Joan of Arc, and, most recently, to the ever-chained Jacob Marley from Charles Dickens’ A\n\nChristmas Carol. Ms. Kirsten is drawn to stories in which the human will collides with its real or imagined surrounding world.\n\nHer new opera, meditating on the relationship between Joan of Arc and Gilles de Rais, premieres in May of 2025 at the Curtis Institute where she is on the composition faculty. In 2022, she was also appointed to the composition faculty at the Juilliard School where she maintains a private studio and teaches a two-semester course called “Theatre Etudes.” A published poet, she is currently working on a couple of short stories, as well as a book of essays, doodles, shadow art, and musical sketches entitled Something Beautiful in the Dark: Impractical Advice for Makers and Dreamers – coming in 2025!\n\nYou can learn more about her stage works, concert music, writing, visual art, and more at her website: www.amybethkirsten.com\n\nProfessional composer/yangqin performer, co-director of the TengKoh Academy\n\nWriting music characterized by “lyrical centers,” that “channeled spirituality” and “vehemence” (The Straits Times), Singaporean composer and Yangqin/violin performer Cheng Jin Koh strives to transcend boundaries through the reinvention of musical meanings.\n\nHer accolades include the BMI Foundation Young Composer (William Schuman) Prize, an ASCAP Morton Gould Young Composer Award, a Society of New Music Brian Israel Prize, the Palmer Dixon Award and Gena Raps Chamber Music Prize (both from the Juilliard School), and the Margaret Blackburn and Boston New Music Initiative (BNMI) Prizes. She was recently the commissioned composer for the 2022 Singapore International Violin Competition and was also commissioned by the Smithsonian National Museum of Asian Art for their centennial celebrations. Groups she has worked with include the Verona Quartet, Bergamot Quartet, New Thread Quartet, Mirror Visions Ensemble, Central Conservatory of Music and China Conservatory of Music in China, Singapore Symphony Orchestra, Singapore Chinese Orchestra, Singapore National Chinese Youth Orchestra, and Ding Yi Music Company.\n\nAs a Yangqin musician, she was one of the youngest grand prize winners of the Singapore Chinese Music Competition and performed as a soloist with the Singapore Chinese Orchestra at eighteen. A member of the Chinese Music Ensemble of New York, she also regularly premieres her own music, which mostly involve multicultural and interdisciplinary explorations. Having completed her undergraduate and graduate studies at the Juilliard School, she is currently a PhD MacCracken fellow and a teaching assistant at New York University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.\n\nContemporary performer and Professor of Guitar, Jacobs School of Music\n\nPraised by The Washington Post for her “mesmerizing” and “stirring” performances, JIJI is an adventurous guitarist known for her virtuosity and command of diverse repertoire.

Set to release UNBOUND in 2023, the culmination of a multiyear commissioning and recording project, JIJI has also collaborated with esteemed ensembles and musicians, including the New York Philharmonic, Cuarteto Latinoamericano,\n\nVerona Quartet, Wildup, Duo Linu, and violinist Danbi Um. During the 2023–24 season, JIJI will make her debut at Verizon Hall with the Curtis Symphony Orchestra, premiering a new guitar concerto by Grammy-winning composer Steven Mackey.\n\nAn esteemed educator, JIJI serves as an Associate Professor of Guitar at Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, conducting master classes and workshops at prestigious institutions worldwide, including the Peabody Institute, Yale University, and Dublin’s National Concert Hall.

He is a proud recipient of the Juilliard School Kovner Fellowship Award.\n\nProfessor of Composition, Jacobs School of Music\n\nDon Freund has been described as “a composer thoughtful in approach and imaginative in style” (The Washington Post), whose music is “exciting, amusing, disturbing, beautiful, and always fascinating” (Music and Musicians, London).

Many of his\n\nworks are available on commercial CD.\n\nThe recipient of numerous awards and commissions, including two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and a Guggenheim Fellowship, Freund has served as guest composer at a vast array of universities and music festivals, and presented master classes throughout Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa, and South America.
