Her first book, The People’s Lobby: Organizational Innovation and the Rise of Interest Group Politics in the United States, 1890-1925, was recognized by the American Sociological Association as an exceptional work of both organizational sociology and political sociology. Clemens has co-edited multiple volumes, including Politics and Partnerships: Voluntary Associations in America’s Political Past and Present (2010), which won a research prize from the Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations and Voluntary Action.\n\nHer forthcoming book, Civic Gifts, will examine how benevolence and liberalism shaped the development of the American nation-state.\n\nClemens is a former president of the Social Science History Association. She is also past chair of UChicago’s Department of Sociology and master of the Social Sciences Collegiate Division. She is currently editor of the American Journal of Sociology.\n\nMichael Greenstone has been named the Milton Friedman Distinguished Service Professor in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics and the College.\n\nGreenstone directs the Becker Friedman Institute and the interdisciplinary Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. His research appears in leading economics and scientific journals and has influenced policy globally. The primary motivation of his research is the global energy challenge that aims to balance society’s need for inexpensive and reliable energy for robust economic growth, without unduly harming human health or the environment or increasing the probability of disruptive climate change. Recently, he created the Air Quality Life Index®, which enables people globally to understand the impact of air pollution on life expectancy.\n\nHe previously served as the chief economist for President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, where he co-led the development of the U.S. government’s social cost of carbon. He is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the Econometric Society and a former editor of the Journal of Political Economy.\n\nDerek Neal has been named the William C. Norby Professor in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics and the College.\n\nShortly after arriving at UChicago, Neal began work on a series of papers that document the causes and consequences of basic skill gaps that develop between black and white youth as they progress through childhood and early adolescence. Over the past decade, he has worked on the design of incentive and accountability systems for educators. In 2018, he published Information, Incentives and Education Policy (Harvard University Press). His current work explores how U.S. criminal justice policy impacts black-white inequality.\n\nHe is a past president of the Midwest Economics Association, a fellow of the Society of Labor Economists, and a former editor of the Journal of Human Resources, the Journal of Labor Economics and the Journal of Political Economy.\n\nBooth School of Business\n\nRalph S.J.
