        "text": "The greatest problem we face both inside and outside the Church is: the loss of the sense of the sacred. In a busy and distracted society, people from all walks of life hunger for deep meaning, for the timeless, for the transcendent. They hunger for the presence of God.\n\nThe Benedict XVI Institute for Sacred Music and Divine Worship’s unique mission is to open the door of Beauty to God.\n\nWe pursue this mission through two great strategies: providing practical resources for more beautiful and reverent liturgies and energizing a Catholic culture of the arts.\n\nOur core vision: The greatest art, the greatest liturgy the Catholic Church has ever produced is yet to come.\n\nFrank La Rocca is Composer-in-Residence at the Benedict Institute. The recent winner of the ORTUS international choral composition competition, he was named a 2018 American Prize winner for his “A Rose In Winter – the life of St. Rita of Cascia”, a major work for chorus, orchestra and soloists commissioned by Alfred Calabrese, Director of Music at St. Rita’s Catholic Community, Dallas.\n\nTrained as an academic modernist during his degree studies at Yale and University of California, Berkeley, La Rocca came to see this approach as a barrier to authentic musical expression, and spent many years in search of a personal creative language. His catalog includes works in all genres, with an emphasis on a cappella sacred choral works. At a recent University of Notre Dame conference, “James MacMillan: The Musical Modes of Mary and the Cross”, La Rocca presented a talk entitled, The Apologetics of Beauty: a Musical Theology of the Incarnation, based upon his choral work O Magnum Mysterium.\n\nA three-part article in Catholic Arts Today chronicles his journey:\n\nFrank La Rocca’s Search for the Sacred (Part I)\n\nFrank La Rocca: The Crucifix and the Crack in the Door (Part 2)\n\nFrank La Rocca Comes Home (Part 3)\n\nMore can be learned about Frank La Rocca on his personal website, www.franklarocca.com.\n\nJames Matthew Wilson is Associate Professor of Religion and Literature in the Department of Humanities and Augustinian Traditions at Villanova University. An award-winning scholar of philosophical-theology and literature, he has authored dozens of essays, articles, and reviews on all manner of subjects secular and divine, and especially on those where we see the two in their intrinsic relation, as truth, goodness, beauty, and being disclose themselves in art and culture, in the political and intellectual life, in our quest for self knowledge and the contemplation of God. His scholarly work especially focuses on the meeting of aesthetic and ontological form, where the craftsmanship of art-work discloses the truth about being.\n\nWilson is a poet and critic of contemporary poetry, whose work appears regularly in such magazines and journals as First Things, The Hudson Review, Modern Age, The New Criterion, Dappled Things, Measure, The Weekly Standard, Front Porch Republic, The Raintown Review, National Review, and The American Conservative.\n\nHe has published eight books, including The Vision of the Soul: Truth, Goodness, and Beauty in the Western Tradition (CUA, 2017); the major critical study, The Fortunes of Poetry in an Age of Unmaking (Wiseblood, 2015); a collection of poems, Some Permanent Things; and a monograph, The Catholic Imagination in Modern American Poetry (both Wiseblood Books, 2014). Wilson is the Poetry Editor of Modern Age magazine, and also serves on the boards of several learned journals and societies. His most recent book is The Hanging God (Angelico, 2018).\n\nTwice, Wilson has been awarded the Lionel Basney Award by the Conference for Christianity and Literature; he has been a runner up for both the Foley Prize for Poetry by America magazine and the Jacques Maritain Essay Prize by Dappled Things magazine. The Dallas Institute of Humanities and Culture awarded him the 2017 Hiett Prize in the Humanities, the largest award of its kind.\n\nWilson was educated at the University of Michigan (B.A.), the University of Massachusetts (M.A.), and the University of Notre Dame (M.F.A., Ph.D.), where he subsequently held a Sorin Research Fellowship.

He has also guest conducted the Santa Fe Desert Chorale, Vocal Arts Ensemble of Cincinnati, and the Anchorage Music Festival among many others.\n\nArchbishop Cordileone and the Benedict XVI Institute for Sacred Music and Divine Worship are honored that Richard Sparks brings his distinguished talents to the B16 mission of offering great and elevating works of sacred music, both old and new, in the context in which they were made to be heard: as prayer, not performance.\n\nPreview some of Richard Sparks’ works here:\n\nVADIS VR was founded by Amy Giuliano, a recent Yale graduate trained in virtual reality technologies at Yale’s Center for Collaborative Arts & Media and credentialed in Art History & Religious Studies at Yale’s Institute of Sacred Music & Divinity School. A dual citizen of the United States and Italy, Amy studied Theology at the Angelicum in Rome for several years where she also worked as an art historical guide. Upon her return to the States, Amy’s work as a university lecturer prompted her to seek ways to provide her U.S.-based students with transformative access to historic, religious & artistic sites abroad. She especially wished to open the Catholic Church’s rich artistic patrimony to students who may otherwise never explore it. Ever since Amy began creating these virtual tours and using them in her own classroom, she has dedicated her time to building a virtual tour inventory covering sites in Rome, Jerusalem, and beyond. This inventory includes sites from the following periods: Early Christian, Byzantine, Carolingian, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, and Modern. It is available to educational and religious groups for didactic and catechetical purposes. VADIS VR also creates tours on commission; see the Cathedral Basilica in Newark, NJ, as a recent example. VADIS VR was awarded the TSAI Center for Innovation Prize with funding at Yale in 2018.\n\nSalvatore Joseph Cordileone was born in San Diego in 1956. His roots run deep in San Diego.
