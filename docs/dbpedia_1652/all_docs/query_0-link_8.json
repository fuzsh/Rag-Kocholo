        "text": "News\n\nThree Days in Raiford Prison ~ 1939\n\nThe Lineage of a Song: John A. Lomax, Ruby Terrill Lomax\n\n& The Archives of American Folklife Center\n\nCopyright 2020 Joe Jencks, Turtle Bear Music\n\nPlease Note: Following this article are additional Lyrics & Notes for all five songs I ressurrected from the archives of The American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, for the 2020 Homegrown at Home virtual concert series.\n\nWe Don't Have No Payday Here\n\nTouble Is Hard\n\nOh, Ye Prodigal Son\n\nBattle Ax\n\nTake 'Dis Hammer\n\nYou can listen to the \"concert\" here:\n\nhttps://www.loc.gov/concerts/folklife/joe-jencks.html\n\nI have on several occasions been asked to be a part of the Library of Congress, Folk Archives Challenge at the Folk Alliance International Conference. It’s always an honor and a good time. It is fun, relaxed, musically interesting and always educational. Musicians from all over the US and a few from other countries dive into the L.O.C. Folk Archives and resurrect some song that has fallen by the wayside. Or they render a new version of an old chestnut, and in so doing help us hear an old song in a new way. I always enjoy the concert that is assembled from musicians who have chosen to participate. It never fails to enlighten and delight.\n\nI have to admit in all honesty that at least once, I trolled the archives for songs I already knew, and picked one of them. Based on looking at people’s albums/ song titles and comparing that to what was performed in concerts at the conference, I am clearly not the only one who has taken the road more traveled now and then.\n\nBut this year, this year I dove deep. I looked through dozens of songs and went deep down the rabbit hole of songs relating to work and chain gangs in the south, and prison yard songs. And the song I emerged with was, “Take Dis Hammer.” I am glad I did not know that it was a song well known in Blues and Bluegrass circles. If so, I might have stopped there with a rendition offered by Lead Belly or Odetta, or Flatt & Scruggs. Or one of a dozen other versions done by blues artists over the last 80 years. But because I found it in the archives of The American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress and in a Lomax field recording first, that was what I listened to.\n\nI was moved by the voices I heard in those old John Lomax recordings, from a prison yard in Florida in 1939. He captured something powerful. As I listened, I imagined things that had not yet transpired when these songs were recorded. Nelson Mandela on a chain gang in a prison yard on Robben Island, in South Africa. Mohandas Gandhi and the peak of the Satyagraha movement, Martin Luther King Jr. and the marches, rallies and movements for Civil Rights yet to emerge. Black Lives Matter, and so much more.\n\nJohn A. Lomax was a pioneering and visionary musicologist. Much of what we know about American Folk music from various eras before recording technology was accessible to most people, is because of John Lomax, his wives Bess & Ruby and his sons John Lomax Jr., Alan Lomax and daughter Bess Lomax. They transcribed by hand, and made field recordings of countless songs in a multitude of genres, preserving the musical styles that were endemic to certain regions or trades, or cultural sub-sets. And the Library of Congress Folk Archives are a true treasure trove of the extraordinary, including but by no means limited to the Lomax Collections.\n\nJohn A. Lomax co-founded the Texas Folklore Society at the University of Texas in Austin in about 1908. The date is disputed, but in 1909, he nominated co-founder Professor Leonidas Payne to be President of the society. John A Lomax went on to help found Folklore Societies across the United States. His direct mentor at Harvard (which was at the time the center of American Folklore Studies, a field of study considered a subset of English Literature) was George Lyman Kittredge. Kittredge was a scholar of Shakespearean Literature and of Chaucer. He had inherited the position of Professor of English Literature from none other than Francis James Child. Child is known for his 8-volume lifetime work: Popular Ballads of England and Scotland. The work was unfinished at the time of Child’s passing, and Kittredge finished the work as well as continuing to teach several of the courses Child had taught. Lomax had a fine pedigree in sound research methods, and was likely the first to transcend the idea of American Folklore as a subset of English Literature and thus is appreciated in many circles as the progenitor of a new discipline: American Folklore a.k.a. American Ethnomusicology.\n\nIn 1910, Lomax published: Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, with a forward by none other than the recently retired President of the United States and aficionado of the American West, Theodore Roosevelt. It was quite a feather in the cap of a relatively young Lomax. But his truest musical love were songs that rose out of African American culture. And he was soon to find his way into the pursuit of many more forms of American Folklore. Lomax was the first to present papers to the Modern Language Association about American Literature in the form of uniquely American Ballads and Songs. He took to the lecture circuit while continuing to teach, publish, and make field recordings eventually with the help of his sons Alan and John Jr., and daughter Bess. Spanning several decades, John Lomax contributed over ten-thousand recordings to the Archive of American Folksong, at the Library of Congress.\n\nAt first the recordings were in the form of transcriptions and transliterations of the oral traditions he encountered. Old school. Lomax wrote them down. But as recording technologies improved and became more portable, Lomax was always on the leading edge of the latest capacity to record. In 1917, he was let go from his university position in Texas, over broader political battles within the institution, and was forced to take a job in the banking industry for several years in Chicago. But he became life-long friends with poet Carl Sandburg while he was there, and is referenced many times in Sandburg’s book Songbag (1927). In 1925, Lomax moved back to Texas to work for a larger bank there, but obviously being in banking became disastrous in the fall of 1929. In 1931, his beloved wife Bess Lomax died at age 50, and Lomax also lost his job when the bank for which he worked, failed as a result of The Great Depression.\n\nIn 1933, John A. Lomax got a grant from the American Society of Learned Studies and acquired a state-of-the-art phonograph, an uncoated aluminum disc recorder. At 315 pounds, he and Alan mounted it in the trunk of the family Ford sedan, and went off adventuring. John was finally able to pursue the archiving the musical and narrative memory of a quickly passing generation of African Americans. Many of his subjects were in prisons, but that was by no means the sum of his contact with the African American community. He did however recognize that Jim Crow and other racist practices had created a situation where a disproportionate number of African American men were imprisoned. And because many had been there for a long time, they had not been influenced by radio and recordings. The oral traditions were still alive in the prisons of the south in particular, and in ways that they were no longer present in other parts of the country.\n\nIt was in one such prison that Lomax met Lead Belly. And while many have accused John Lomax of somehow misappropriating ideas from Lead Belly, history from many angles suggests that Lomax was a staunch advocate for Lead Belly. Lomax advocated earnestly for Lead Belly’s release from prison, and while causality is hard to trace, Lead Belly was in fact released in August of 1934. The Lomax Family helped Lead Belly get work singing African American songs throughout the North Eastern US, and with the advice of legendary Western singer Tex Ritter, also helped Lead Belly get his first recording contract. John Lomax and Lead Belly had a falling out over the managing of finances in 1935, and never spoke to one another again. Alan Lomax however, remained a stalwart friend and an advocate of Lead Belly’s for the next 15 years, until Lead Belly’s death in 1949.\n\nThough it is not clearly documented, it is very likely that Lead Belly himself learned Take Dis Hammer from the Lomax field recordings. He however only sang a few of the traditional verses, and invented his own version. He was prone to personalize many of the songs he sang and recorded, and was known to embellish on the historic record from time to time if it made a good story. In short, he was a Folksinger and Bluesman in good standing.\n\nMy version of Take Dis Hammer was derived mostly from the field recordings made by John, Alan, and Ruby Terrill Lomax, John’s second wife. There was no available transcription of the original field recordings which were made in 1939 at the Florida State Prison known as Raiford Penitentiary. These recordings were part of a series from the Southern States Recording Trip. So I listened, and listened, and listened again, at least 100 times. And I still could not discern certain words and phrases.\n\nSo, I spoke with Jennifer Cutting and Dr. Stephen Winick (with whom I am occasionally confused in public gatherings and always take it as a compliment) at The American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. I explained the problem in trying to resurrect the original recorded version. They responded kindly that I should consider recovering as many of the original words as possible, and use my knowledge of the idiom, the period, and my capacity as a songwriter to fill in the gaps. So, I did. I also included a re-write of a verse that I traced to one of the Flatt & Scruggs recordings, and as a proper homage, I included a slight adaptation of one of Lead Belly’s verses. But the last verse was largely unintelligible. As such, I lifted what I could and made up the rest with knowledge of the context. Words I wrote to infill for inaudible words, or just invented to fit the context are italicized and in bold.\n\nMuch to my honor and delight I was asked to expand my research and offerr a longer program for the 2020 Homegrown Concerts (September 2nd, 2020) sponsred by the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. I resurrected and researched a dozen additional recordings from those three days in Raiford, and chose four of those additional songs for a presentation on the songs from the Raiford Prison (FL) in 1939. I engaged in what I will call anthropological songwriting where necessisary, to fill in the gaps in the verses or narrative. Lyrics and notes below, as well as links to the origianl field recordings that were my primary reference material.\n\nYou can listen to the \"concert\" here: https://www.loc.gov/concerts/folklife/joe-jencks.html\n\nDo yourself a favor, troll around the Library of Congress Folk Archives and the Archive of American Folksong.

With vacations behind and a new season of show ahead, Helena and I start the touring seasong tonight in Cleveland, OH with a house concert at the home of some dear friends Amy & Jeff Chatlos.\n\nWell, actually we started it last night with a concert here in Cincinnati. It was sort of a shake-down cruise for our new enterprise as a performing duo. It was a fun show attended by friends and family and neighbors. I hope you get to come see Helena Nash and myself give a concert together some time. It is really magical. We are having fun and enjoying the constant evolution of our artistic mingling.\n\nAs you can see the website is still under construction, but we are slowly getting it up to speed.\n\nThanks for your patience and support. We hope to see you soon at one of our upcomming performances!\n\nIn Gratitude and Song...\n\n•Joe\n\nNew Website\n\nHowdy all...\n\nWelcome to JOE JENCKS dot COM. This is a new web site. Please be patient for the next few weeks while we are under construction. It is presently 3:00 AM and Lynn & I are trying to get out of town to go on a much needed rest and writing retreat. Camping along the Michigan coast! Looking for cooler weather. It got to 101 degreees in Cincinnati today. Here's hoping a little breeze off of Lake Michigan will be just the ticket to spawn creativity and de-compression.\n\nDe-compression from what you ask?\n\nWell, first and foremost, I have a brand new CD \"The Candle And The Flame\" which I just released at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival at the end of July! The CD totally ROCKS!!!. I had a great deal of help assembling this one from an amazing team of engineers and musicians... several of whom have won grammys for their past work. Nice to have that kind fo talent and skill and thoughtfulness on a project.\n\nGuests include:\n\nJon Carroll (Mary Chapin Carpenters pianist) on keyboards\n\nPat Wictor on slide guitars\n\nSiobhan Quinn on backing vocals\n\nJim Robeson on electric bass\n\nCharlie Pilzer on upright bass\n\nBob Beach on harmonica\n\nCharlie Bernhardt on vocals\n\nThe Jencks Family on vocals\n\nI will get proper links up here when I get back from vacation, so you all can surf easily to their respective web sites and check out their stuff.\n\nIn addition to all this, I was part of the Emerging Artist Showcase at Falcon Ridge Folk Festival a few weeks ago. It was a great experience. In spite of some adversity (busted a string in the first 35 seconds I was on stage and had no time to replace it) I gave a GREAT performance... and had a great time. That's what counts!\n\nAnd, there is a new performing partnership that is evolving between myself and Helena Nash (of Butterfly Sky). This project is fun. I have been on the road full time as a solo artist for seven years. i look forward to sharing the road and the stage with Helena, who is a MARVELOUS singer... and seeing where our respective creativity take us.\n\nAnd... of course if you are reading this you have noticed that there is a new site. Please be patient and stay tuned as this will be a really cool place one I get all moved in... so to speak. You have caught me on moving week to carry the metaphore forward. So do come back and stay for a while once all the boxes have been unpacked!\n\nI am really silly for want of sleep... so I will sign off for now. Please check back frequently as the new site will have regular up-dates and new pics, news etc. Thanks to Slab Media for the great job in a super hurry!\n\nAnd thanks to all of you for all the kind support!\n\nIn Peace & Song...\n\n•Joe\n\nJoe Jencks Tour News ~ June '24 + Essay: Deep In The Heart of Texas\n\nDear Friends in Music,\n\nI have just returned from the Kerrville Folk Festival. It was as always, a marvelous experience. And it has me thinking about a great many things. Please see the essay below Deep in The Heart of Texas, for more reflections on my most recent visit to Texas.\n\nBut first, I have a marvelous run of shows in the coming weeks, wrapping up with the Old Songs Festival at the end of June! More detailed concert listings and shows throughout the coming year can be found at: https://www.joejencks.com/calendar.\n\nUp Next…\n\n5-31-24 ~ The Troubadour Coffee House – Morristown, NJ (w/ guest Carol Crittendon)\n\n6-1-24 ~ The Linden Tree Coffee House – Wakefield, MA\n\n6-8-24 ~ Coastal Virginia UU – Virginia Beach, VA\n\n6-15-24 ~ Soup & Song Concerts – Marriottsville, MD\n\n6-20-24 ~ Kendal Quaker Communities – Kennett Square, PA\n\n6-21-24 ~ Kendal Quaker Communities – Kennett Square, PA\n\n6-23-24 ~ Susquehanna Summer Solstice Festival – French Azylum, PA\n\n6-27-24 ~ La La Land Concerts – Ithaca, NY\n\n6-28-24 ~ Old Songs Festival – Altamont, NY (Main Stage Performance)\n\n6-29-24 ~ Old Songs Festival – Altamont, NY (Workshops & Performances)\n\n6-30-24 ~ Old Songs Festival – Altamont, NY (Workshops & Performances)\n\nI hope to see many of you at one of these concerts or festivals. It has been an abundant and also rigorous first half of 2024. I am exceedingly happy to see so many people returning to live music venues and festivals. It feels like the Folk world is finding a new and engaged post-Pandemic normal. And I am grateful beyond measure to the countless people in the Folk scene in North America who have remained committed to LIVE music. Fans, Presenters, Producers, Promoters, Venue Owners and Operators, Artistic & Executive Directors, and Folk DJs have all had a hand in bringing us back. Thank you!\n\nIn Gratitude & Song,\n\n~ Joe Jencks\n\nDeep in The Heart of Texas\n\nCopyright 2024 ~ Joe Jencks, Turtle Bear Music\n\nI just spent eight days and seven nights at the Kerrville Folk Festival in Kerrville, TX. It is a songwriter’s festival to be sure. And as I reflect on my own involvement in this community over the last two decades, I am grateful and surprised in probably equal measure. Grateful for the ways in which this community of people have had an impact on my career. Grateful for the people I have been privileged to know as a result of my time there, year after year. Grateful for the doors that have opened professionally and personally, and for the life-long friends I have met there. Grateful for the main-stage performances as well as the song circles and sharing among peers.\n\nAnd, I am surprised that I have found a loyal audience in Texas in large part because of the exposure the Kerrville Festival has afforded me over the last 20 years. It was not obvious to me earlier in my life and career that Texas was a good fit for my music. Mostly, because what news outlets reflect about Texas politics vs. the reality of the majority of the Texans I know, are incongruous. I have jokingly described Texas Liberals as having Tie-Dyed gun racks in their trucks. It is an incredibly incomplete description, but it’s not wrong in an allegorical sense. It captures the uncategorizable elements of Texas. The peculiarities. It makes Texas a great place for Folk music, because folk music is based in narrative. And Texans love a good story.\n\nTexas is a big place. And the stars at night are big and bright. But it is also a complex place. It was for a period of time, an independent nation. In round numbers – Texas is 260,000 square miles. For comparison, France is 213,000 square miles. Imagine the impact France has had on the world. Why are we surprised then that Texas has its own complex and distinct culture?\n\nTexas is an amalgamation of so many different cultures past and present. Indigenous, early Spanish colonial, Mexican colonial, German immigrant, African American, Irish immigrant, and Anglo immigrant influences have all had an impact. Each have left their mark on Texas. But everywhere I go in Texas, I meet good people. I meet people who lead with hospitality and gracious welcome. I meet people who mostly don’t discuss politics with their neighbors. Because in a state that big, especially in the more rural communities, you need good neighbors. Don’t let politics ruin that.\n\nOne fellow at the festival said that Austin used to be a brilliant kind of weird. Then people from all over decided they wanted to be where it was hip and cool. Then signs popped up on bumper stickers and billboards saying, Keep Austin Weird. That contingent has mostly lost. Like San Francisco, Seattle, and many other destination cities, the people who kept it weird have been priced out. And the more affluent bourgeoise who have taken over have subtly changed the culture of the city. It’s still cool, but different. Still, there are other beautifully weird parts of Texas, and people from those places also come to the Kerrville Folk Festival.\n\nAnother thing that surprises me about The Kerrville Festival and Texas in general, is how many solid friends I have made there. I first went to Texas because it was a gig. And I was busy saying YES to anyone who wanted to put me in front of a listening audience. But I keep going back, because there is a lifetime worth of history and current culture to explore, and now countless genuine friends with whom I want to spend time. Amazing.\n\nI made some new friends at this year’s Kerrville Festival. One fellow with whom I hope to keep in touch, was part of the Nashville hit factory. We talked about the Industry of music. He said the dream of Nashville is massive success. But the number of people who find it are few and far between. He said that talent plus hard work plus an incredible amount of luck will keep you working. But the extent to which luck is the key element in that equation is really soft-pedaled. And it toxically contributes to the mythology of people moving to Nashville seeking their dreams. And it misses the part of the story where they lose their way, get chewed up, and then spit out the other side, and forgotten. It contributes to the number of people who have their hearts broken and then quit making music altogether. That is heart breaking.\n\nWe talked about how workers in a more traditional industrial workplace are more able to see that they are in fact, workers. And therefore, they organize as laborers for the betterment of their working conditions. But aspiring writers and performers in Nashville and even Austin want a taste of the big time so badly, that they rarely work collectively to organize the workplace as people would in other industries. They don’t want to overturn the apple cart or the mythology of overnight success.\n\nRecently, many people in varied context have asked me why I am not more famous. I have many thoughts on the matter. But as my colleague and I were talking, I came to understand that the single biggest reason is that I don’t want to be famous. It is burdensome. It is expensive, it costs a great deal of money and time to be famous, and I would rather keep my eye on the art, on community, and on the stories that come to me and through me as a writer.\n\nA number of people with whom I went to conservatory, went to Nashville after they got out of school. Many of whom no longer play music at all. It is too painful. I knew I NEVER wanted that to be my story.\n\nThere is minimal obsolescence in Folk music. It is a community of artists and listeners who value what Utah Phillips used to call, the long memory. There is no specific bar (like top 40 radio) that determines if you are a success in Folk music. If you can keep doing what you love to do, mostly on your own terms, you are a success. As with Jazz, the number of Folkies still making music into their 70s, 80s, even into their 90s is remarkable.\n\nI heard the hit factory man say that it is hard to be in the back half of life, and know in truth that the best days of your career are behind you.\n\nIt made me sad and grateful. Because in Folk music, every year of my career has been better then that last. I am on a slow and steady trajectory of growth and evolution as a recording artist, performer, writer, and record producer. I look forward to the next thing that will capture my mind or heart in the world and become a part of my art. That is hopeful. That is a pathway of experimentation and of exploration. That is the sort of career I want. Slow and steady growth professionally and creatively.\n\nThis is why I am not more famous. Because I continue to choose people over radical advancement. I have chosen to keep evolving and trying to make each year better than the last. And I am grateful to all of you for supporting Folk music and valuing the cottage industry that is the career of most of the artists you know. We do it because it is what is in our souls. And I do it this way, because I wanted to keep building a career modeled on the ideas of the early Labor Movement in the U.S. and Canada. Workers should maintain control over the means of production, and workers deserve a fair share of the profits generated by their labors. I have been immensely privileged to do both of these things in fair measure in my career. But the price tag for me is a more obscure career than some. But it is a career in service to my beliefs and the communities I love. It’s a good trade.\n\nMy time at Kerrville this year sitting in song circles and listening to colleagues both on stage and in camps reminded me of why I set out on a particular professional pathway 25+ years ago with clear intent. And it reminded me that it is still a pathway to which I am called. I love making music, I love collaborating with friends and colleagues, and I am richly blessed to still be doing this so many years after I took a flying leap out of my last day job.\n\nI could not do it without you. If you are reading this, then you are part of why I am still making music. You affirm the value of it every time you come to a show, buy a recording, or write a note that expresses why the music means something specific to you. Thank you!\n\nMay the journey continue for a long time to come, and may we each find ways to inhabit our passions, musical or otherwise. Not because they bring fame or fortune, but because they bring meaning and joy.\n\n~ Joe Jencks (5-30-24)\n\nJoe in 2023 with friend and beloved Kerrville stalwart, Liz Rouse. Sadly we lost Liz earlier this year. She is missed and loved.\n\nJoe Jencks Tour News ~ May 2024\n\nDear Friends in Music,\n\nIt is my honor and joy to return to Caffe Lena this week for two concerts on Saturday, May 4th. Star Wars Day! May the Fourth be with you! I remember seeing all three original trilogy films in the theater as a kid. A hopeful, heroic story where good, hard-working people triumph over the advance of Totalitarianism and Fascism. Hmmm….Still seems like a useful story.\n\nOn May 4th, I’ll be offering a free “Little Folks” show at Caffe Lena at 3:00 PM and a full concert at 8:00 PM. Many thanks to all of the staff and volunteers who keep the wheels on the bus at Caffe Lena. It is the oldest continuously-operating Folk music coffeehouse in the country. Always a marvelous experience. The evening concert will be live-streamed as well, so, if you can’t make it to Saratoga Springs, NY, you can still join us. Go to https://www.caffelena.org for information about how to tap into the stream. I’ll also be debuting a brand-new song!\n\nOn Sunday, May 5th, at 4:00 PM, I’ll be performing for Music at The Ridge concert series. It is a marvelous new Folk music series in Danbury, CT. https://musicattheridge.org. Check out their whole lineup. They have some marvelous performers rolling through.\n\nThe next two weeks will have me sharing concerts with my beloved friend and colleague, Deidre McCalla. We’re calling this The Allies Tour. Aptly named; we are indeed genuine allies and friends. It’s always a privilege to make music with Deidre. We share songs, harmonies, and plenty of good laughs. We’re doing five concerts on this swing:\n\n5-9-24 ~ Flying Cat Concerts in Indianapolis, IN\n\n5-10-24 ~ The Ark in Ann Arbor, MI\n\n5-11-24 ~ Six String Concerts in Columbus, OH\n\n5-18-24 ~ Renaissance Concerts in Hinsdale, IL\n\n5-19-24 ~ Madison Folk Music Society, Madison, WI\n\nFull concert listings and links can be found under Tour Dates on: https://www.joejencks.com/calendar\n\nOn Sunday, May 26th, I will be helping to remember Rev. Charlie Sumners at the Kerrville Folk Festival. A genuine friend and stalwart advocate for so many people over his amazing life.\n\nI hope you had a good May Day. Whether you celebrate International Workers’ Memorial Day, Beltane (one of the four cardinal Celtic/Pagan holidays), or other traditions, I hope the advance of Spring into Summer is bringing you joy! Some good walks in nature have been helping me center in the wonders of the natural world. Good food, good friends, good music, and time connecting to the Earth are a guaranteed way for me to find hopefulness and strength.

And Eclipse! (Yeah. That!)\n\nI am writing today from sunny Seattle, and looking out the window across Green Lake past flowering trees toward the Cascade Mountains. It is a fabulous week to be in this part of the country.\n\nApril & May will include some beautiful collaboration with several friends and colleagues. This weekend it is my distinct joy to be returning to Seattle and Bellingham, WA. A great show on Saturday 4-13 for the incomparable Seattle Folklore Society, and a shared show on 4-14 with my friend, Linda Allen. She is a genuine treasure of the Pacific Northwest. And her music has been sung by people all over the world.\n\nThen I am off to the semi-annual Labor Notes Conference in Chicago. This is a gathering of 4500 of the most forward-thinking people in the Labor Movements from the U.S., Canada, Australia, and beyond. It is my honor to be performing, facilitating, and presenting as a panelist.\n\nLater in April I will be returning to the Lansdowne Folk Club (Lansdowne, PA) w/ guest Jessica Smucker, and then on to Abingdon, MD for the fabulous Heart & Soul concert series.\n\nThe first weekend in May I am delighted and honored to return to the one and only, Caffe Lena!\n\nI am sad to say that the Climate Justice retreat I discussed in my last newsletter has been postponed until 2025. But we are planning a monthly Zoom lecture and Q & A moving forward, featuring some of the panelists who would have been at the event. Stay tuned for more details.\n\nAlso, on Sunday April 14, my radio show ~ My Highway Home ~ will be on Folk Music Notebook (.com). This week’s episode features an interview with Janet Stecher, a marvelous Seattle based musician, organizer, performing artist, and founding director of the Seattle Labor Chorus.\n\nLast but not least, I want to wish my beloved friend, mentor, occasional performing partner, and brother in solidarity—Si Kahn, a happy 80th Birthday! April 23, 1944 was a good day for working people, and brought to the world a very gifted and committed musician, songwriter, ally, and organizer. Happy Birthday, buddy!\n\nPlease note below some reflections on the Eclipse. I was privileged to see it in Totality from start to finish at a rest area off of I-90. Stunning.\n\nIn Gratitude & Song,\n\n~ Joe Jencks\n\nEclipse Camaraderie on I-90\n\nCopyright ~ Joe Jencks 2024\n\nOn Monday April 8th, I needed to drive from Albany, NY to Chicago. I was sad to be traveling on the day of the Solar Eclipse. I had wanted to be with friends in Texas. But life has its own plans, and this was how it worked out. As I traced the pathway of Totality, I was delighted to see that it would include a long stretch of I-90 from west of Cleveland, OH through the northern tip of PA, on through the Buffalo, NY region. I figured if I could get in that zone, I would see the Eclipse somehow. But it was a calculated leap of faith.\n\nThe day arrived. I was about 15-20 minutes late hitting the road (not bad for me). And the skies were clear until I got west of Syracuse. Then it started clouding over. By time I was south of Rochester, full cloud cover. Buffalo was socked in as well. I was getting anxious. For many of us this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. And a few science friends had pressed upon me the profound difference between being in the path of total Eclipse (Totality) vs. partial. They were right.\n\nWith total coverage where I was at about 3:18 PM ET, I kept waiting for a break in the clouds. And then I crossed into Pennsylvania and saw a welcome center rest area at mile marker 2. I looked up and the clouds were thinning considerably. I hopped off the road to find nearly every parking space full (and then some) save for one. I pulled in, grabbed my Eclipse glasses and hopped out of the car with enthusiasm. Sure enough, I could see the dark arc of the Moon moving across the sky, obscuring the Sun with surprising swiftness. I made it. The sky was clearing and I was in a good place 20+ minutes ahead of the big event.\n\nI found a fellow there with an array of equipment set up. He had a telescope on one tripod with a cable running to a computer on another, a still photography camera on yet another tripod, and a third camera in his hand. Then I noticed the insignia on his polo shirt. NASA. I asked if he worked for NASA, he did. I asked why he was at a rest area. He was supposed to be in Buffalo, but he made a last-minute dash for the farthest west point he could get and still have time to set up all of his gear. Turns out he was recording hi-def video from the telescope which was viewing the infrared spectrum. The still camera on a tripod was doing its own thing. The rest was just luck. We both waited with hopeful anticipation for the clouds to fully disperse and for the magic to happen.\n\nAs it got darker, it also got colder. A woman who worked for the welcome center (and who had been passing out Eclipse glasses) was also checking on the temperature. It was dropping fast. A couple of minutes before the point of Totality was reached, the last of the clouds were gone. And in perfect clarity, we saw the last few bits of light before the Moon completely occluded the Sun.\n\nIt had been getting darker on a gradient that was fairly consistent until the big moment. Then all of a sudden, it was like someone flipped a switch and it got nearly nighttime dark. And then I looked up at the silhouette of the Moon with the Sun’s Corona shimmering around the entire circumference. I was awestruck. This moment was unlike anything I have ever witnessed or felt, and it was not oversold by my science friends who were adamant that if I wanted the full experience, I needed to get into the pathway of Totality.\n\nI expected the Moon to look black. It did not. It appeared a beautiful midnight blue. Deep. Fathomless. And easily four times bigger than I expected. It looked like someone had turned a blue star sapphire inside out. The rich impenetrable center surrounded by the shimmering and ethereal circle of blue-white light that appeared to the eye to dance in slow motion. A large red solar flare (Coronal-mass ejection?) was visible to the naked eye, and my sense of wonder for the universe in which we exist was turned up to eleven.\n\nThe quality of light was beautiful. Low but still articulating the shape of everything. Luminous but minimal. Unlike dusk or nighttime, unlike a full moon on a clear night, it was as if the world had become the leading character in an old silver-screen film. Yet somehow, infinitely more dimensional.\n\nI kept looking up at the massive inverted sapphire in the sky, and my guy from NASA was occasionally explaining what I was seeing through the lens of his perspective, as well as his camera. I felt blessed. Lucky beyond measure to have made it to this place at just the right time, and to stumble on a photographer working for NASA who was my docent through the whole experience.\n\nIt is frequently my inclination to draw attention to some deeper meaning buried in a story like this. I am still sitting with it. I had three Eclipse specific dreams leading up to the event, and a couple of dreams after that were clearly related. Against the odds, I made it to a perfect place from which to view this extraordinary event in Totality, cloud and traffic free. Grateful. Clearly this is deep in my conscious, unconscious and subconscious mind. It will keep tumbling.\n\nWhen the Eclipse moved into Totality there was no cheering at the rest area along I-90. There was quiet joy and reverence for the wonders of the universe. People gasped and were collectively awed by this phenomenal sight which we all seemed to observe with gentle respect. But around us, in nearby towns and parks, on farms, and on Lake Erie, there were people setting off fireworks. I was surprised. The NASA guy was annoyed. He muttered something about this being a once in a lifetime event for most people, and wondered why humans can’t let that be enough? Indeed, there was nothing about the majesty of the moment that required anything extra. It was complete all by itself.\n\n~ Joe Jencks (4-9-24)\n\nMarch Tour Dates & Let It Breathe ~ Song & Essay\n\nDear Friends in Music,\n\nIt is my joy to be on the road a great deal this year. I traveled nearly coast to coast just in the month of January. February had me touring in Canada. And March has me traversing a broad swath of the U.S. I hope to see you at one or another of my upcoming shows.\n\nMarch 8-10 in Texas: Georgetown, Austin, and San Antonio.\n\nMarch 15-18 in Illinois and Wisconsin: Downers Grove, Kenosha, Shawano, and Rockford.\n\nMarch 22-24 in Virginia: Residency at Averett University and a concert in Charlottesville.\n\nMarch 26-27 in New York: Artist in Residence at SUNY Oneonta.\n\nHere is a link to a new song, one that many of you have been asking for since I debuted the song last summer at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival. A studio single will follow later this year, and I will be working on a new record this year as well. Stay tuned. For now, please enjoy this LIVE performance recorded earlier this week on FOX 7 - Good Day Austin.\n\nLink: https://www.fox7austin.com/video/1422315\n\nPlease check the Tour Dates page for full concert listings\n\nLink: https://www.joejencks.com/calendar\n\nPlease also see the essay below: Let It Breathe – offering some thoughts about what it means to me to be revolutionary by offering compassion, and how some words written and spoken by friends and colleagues helped me make a hard decision.\n\nI look forward to seeing many of you at concerts, in the coming weeks!\n\nIn Gratitude & Song,\n\n~ Joe\n\nLet It Breathe\n\nCopyright 2024, Joe Jencks, Turtle Bear Music\n\nI received an invitation to sing live on a FOX News affiliate: Good Day Austin, on FOX 7. I was delighted. Major network air in a place like Austin is a thing. I was honored. And then they asked me in advance, what I wanted to sing. One song. What do I want to say? The temptation to be the activist is ever-present. The chance to do so on a FOX station? Nearly irresistible. But there are many ways to be an activist. Many ways to offer contradiction to the difficulties of the moment. And as much as I wanted to sing about immigration issues, labor, gun violence, environmental issues, racism, and more; I got one song. What to do?\n\nThere is no way you can put yourself into the world, authentically, and not take risks. And art, all by itself, is risky and revolutionary. Pete Seeger said many times in general and a couple of times to me in particular, “A song does not need to be about the revolution to be revolutionary.” That is to say, if what is needed is a lullaby, or a love song, that too is part of the evolution and revolution of that moment.\n\nBaked into the cake of what we think of as the role of a Folksinger (at least in much of North America) is to be a champion of the downtrodden. Many have followed in these footsteps, and many have blazed new trails as variations on a theme, uplifting complex social issues and those who are most affected by them. And yet we find ourselves in a time when the divisiveness is becoming so toxic that we are pitted neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, and sometimes family member against family member. And as we defend our views, ideas, and perspectives, actual progress seems always just out of reach.\n\nI am all for rigorous debate, and I am definitely for social justice, racial and gender equity, the right of laborers to organize, the staunch defense of Civil Rights, the advancement of climate justice and awareness, the deconstruction of exploitative economic models, and the sovereignty of one’s body – especially as pertains to women’s reproductive rights. And yet, there is a need for the healing power of music in ways that sometimes needs to sidestep one idea of what it means to be a Folksinger to uplift another: Making people feel welcome, and deciding not to “other” another person. There is a tacit call to build a relationship of some form, and then carry the dialogue forward having first humanized another person and bothering to know some piece of their story.\n\nCrys Matthews wrote a beautiful song released on her Changemakers album that I have been privileged to sing with her on several occasions: Exactly Where You Are. Look it up. Stunning. It is invitational but not sidestepping differences.\n\nPlains and trains and buses too\n\nNo us and them just me and you.\n\nAnd every person’s like a book with a story yet to tell,\n\nA hidden gem buried deep within the depths of their well,\n\nHello how’s it going, how’s your journey been so far,\n\nNice to meet you, nice to meet you, exactly where you are.\n\nNearly 20 years ago, John Flynn wrote a song speaking to these differences, and a desire to overcome them. A choice to see what we share rather than what divides us. Not that the differences don’t matter, they do. Our stories and lived experiences are real, and our need to give voice to them and be witnessed for the lives we have lived is real. But maybe we get to a better place by offering compassion as we are able to cultivate it, rather than continuing the endless back and forth volley of assertions and assumptions.\n\nThere’s No Them There\n\nCopyright - John Flynn (used by permission)\n\nChorus:\n\nI want to\n\nGo where there’s no them there\n\nThere’s no us there, somewhere we share\n\nWhat we’re given, This ain’t livin’\n\nand I’m dying to go\n\nIt’s more than intuition,\n\nor a strong suspicion\n\nA whole lot more than wishin’\n\nI know it in my heart\n\nRaces, creeds and nations\n\nare false separations\n\nand we can replace them\n\nwith love it’s time to start (Chorus)\n\nColors of the rainbow\n\nbend together and show\n\nhow we can blend also\n\nIf we look beyond\n\nthe things that divide us\n\nto what is inside us\n\nMay their beauty guide us\n\nfrom this dark road we’re on (Chorus)\n\nFrom fear we’ve learned to cherish\n\nand hate we’re taught to nourish\n\nthe light of hope may perish\n\nif soon we do not find\n\na brand new way of seeing-\n\na brand new way of freeing-\n\nour fellow human beings\n\nby simply being kind (Chorus)\n\nThinking of these two beloved colleagues, and thinking to myself, “What would Pete do in this moment?” I decided to sing a new song of mine called, Let It Breathe (Love Has You Surrounded) for my one moment of fame on FOX 7 in Austin. I wrote the song last summer, in part inspired by a Haiku written by my friend and colleague Jenny Bienemann. I expect to release it as a single sometime this spring or summer. But so many people have been asking for the song after hearing it in concert. So many people have asked for lyrics and for permission to learn the song. Sometimes the world tells us what is needed. Not a protest or a lullaby, but a song of welcome. A song inviting compassion for the self and others. And that is a good place to start when figuring out how to move forward.\n\nSometimes the most revolutionary act we can engage in, is compassion. This song comes from that place, a place of compassion for others and for self. We are all in need of mercy and compassion. May you find some in this song.\n\n~ Joe Jencks (3-8-24, Austin, TX)\n\nJoe Jencks ~ Let It Breathe (Copyright 2023, Joe Jencks, Turtle Bear Music, ASCAP)\n\nLink to the FOX 7 broadcast performance: https://www.fox7austin.com/video/1422315\n\nLyrics below.\n\nLet It Breathe (Love Has You Surrounded) Copyright 2023 – Joe Jencks, Turtle Bear Music, ASCAP\n\nLay down your weapons\n\nLove has you surrounded\n\nThere is no easy way out\n\nLay down your shield, and\n\nLet your heart break, just a little\n\nLet Love remove all doubt\n\nYou go through the world\n\nEverybody’s sweetheart\n\nKeeping up a front that wears you down\n\nBut in a quiet moment\n\nThe truth comes out, Somedays you\n\nFeel like you’re about to drown\n\nThere is no reason\n\nTo play this charade\n\nYou can be loved for who you are\n\nAnd for every troubled thought\n\nThat crosses your mind, please hold that\n\nYou are someone else’s shining star\n\nWhat do you need?\n\nBy what measure would you know, that\n\nYou are more than what you achieve\n\nWhen you look in the mirror, Is it\n\nPossible to see that\n\nYou are enough, so let it breathe\n\nJoe Jencks February '24 ~ On The Road\n\nDear Friends in Music,\n\nWhat a joy it has been to be on tour in western Canada this last week. Reconnecting with dear friends, making new friends, and sharing some wonderful performances with my beloved colleague and friend, Maria Dunn. Continuing this weekend, Maria & I will be performing tonight in Calgary for the Calgary Folk Club. This is my 5th performance for the club, spanning the last 12 years. It is always a joyous night of music.\n\nFor those at a distance - the concert tonight (2-16-24) will also be Live-Streamed. You can get your link to the Live-Stream, here - and it will be good for 48 hours: www.showpass.com/double-bill-maria-dunn-ab-joe-jencks-us-livestream\n\nTomorrow night - Maria and I will be up in Edmonton at The Roxy Theater. More details below and on the Tour Dates section of my web-site: www.joejencks.com.\n\nContinuing into March and April, I will be on the road solo, coast-to-coast in the U.S. Multiple performances upcoming in: Texas, Illinois, Wisconsin, Virginia, New York, Washington state, and more. And in late April, I will be co-facilitating a Conference/ Retreat on Climate Justice at The Mountain retreat center in Highlands, NC. Stay tuned for more info.\n\nMy January tours in the U.S. SW and out east were remarkable. Amazing people, music, and sights of the natural world. I just crossed 316,000 miles on my Toyota Camry before I flew to Canada. I bought that car brand new with 57 miles on it, in December of 2014. Still going like a champ. And I am grateful beyond measure to see audiences eagerly returning to concert venues across the continent.\n\nI will send out a more detailed list of dates at the top of March. But for now - please accept my gratitude for your continued support, not only of my music, but of the music scene in total. There is a palpable eagerness in the communities in which I have been traveling, to re-engage with LIVE music. And that says to me that the whole scene is back. Thanks for your part in supporting so many artists in so many places. \"There ain't nothing like the real thing...\"\n\nIn Gratitude & Song,\n\n~ Joe Jencks (2-16-24)\n\nSunset over Taos, NM\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR...

It was inspired by a recent interview in which I was asked, “What is your legacy?” While feeling entirely unqualified to answer, I suddenly remembered standing under a Saturn V rocket at the Johnson Space Center with my friend Jim Noble. I remembered a question he asked me at the time, “Do you understand the difference between complicated and complex?” The ensuing conversation was fascinating.\n\nWishing you all the best as we head into the holidays.\n\nMay they be gentle and restorative.\n\nAnd may your Yule log burn brightly!\n\nIn Gratitude & Song,\n\n~ Joe Jencks (12-17-23)\n\nComplex, Not Complicated\n\nCopyright 2023 Joe Jencks, Turtle Bear Music\n\nMy friend Jim Noble is an architect, inventor, and ipso-facto engineer. One of his designs was adapted by NASA to house an experiment that was towed behind a space shuttle on an orbital mission. How cool is that? He and I are both ardent fans of the space program, and of human exploration of our solar system, galaxy, and of interstellar space. We are both fascinated by the many extraordinary things humans have achieved, and the boundless things humans yet need to achieve, environmentally and otherwise. The world needs problem solvers who can work together, especially when it comes to environmental issues that touch on every aspect of human life and every society on this planet. We need big idea people. And we need people who know how to translate that into pragmatic process-driven solutions.\n\nJim Noble took me on a personally guided tour of the Johnson Space Center near Houston. As we were walking through the exhibits, he explained a great deal to me that that was not included in the kiosk write-ups about how and why certain things happened. He explained how specific problems were solved, and talked about some of the sub-processes (both successes and failures) that led to workable solutions.\n\nAt one point during our visit Jim asked me, “Do you understand the difference between complicated and complex?”\n\nI said, “I think I do, but please explain it to me from your perspective.”\n\nJim looked at me with a twinkle in his eye that suggested, maybe I did not in fact understand the difference. And patiently, with his beautiful Texan accent and graciousness, he dove into an explanation. This is what I remember him saying to me that day, while standing under a Saturn V rocket laying on its side at the Johnson Space Center.\n\nJim began, “Any great undertaking is necessarily complex. There are many stages. A rocket has many stages from the time it launches until the capsule, satellite, scientific package, or other piece of hardware or habitat is doing what it was intended to do. Whether in orbit, on its way to the Moon or Mars, or out of our solar system, there are many stages. But every one of those stages is made up of thousands of parts and pieces, of hardware and constructed machinery, and required process. Each step and component is essential to the success of the process and the objective.”\n\nHe continued, “Each one of those parts and pieces had to be invented and fabricated by people who understood their work with precision, and had an ability to grasp how their work would relate to the work of others. So, there are stages not just in the rocket, but in every part and piece, in every aspect of conception, creation, and assembly. At every stage in the process, there is trial and error as materials are tested, reconsidered based on experimentation, and re-created to compensate for unexpected outcomes. This is necessarily complex work. But it only becomes complicated when there are non-essential steps and stages included in the process. The job of a good inventor, designer, engineer, project coordinator, or fabricator is to remove every step of the process that does not NEED to be there. In this way, complicated is reduced to merely complex. It is the art of reducing a process to the most elemental and elegant number of steps required to meet the objective, while still doing so with reasonably assured outcomes and safety.”\n\nHis implications were clear, though understated. And my take-away is ever unfolding.\n\nWe live in a necessarily complex world. But there is a lot we could do personally and collectively to make it less complicated. We can reduce complicated to merely complex. Whether putting people on the Moon or solving problems of climate change, homelessness and poverty, or a lack of access to food, water, sanitary conditions, or healthcare. There is a way. There is always a way. If we get enough people working together for common purpose and check our egos at the door (and throughout the process), we can find solutions. Furthermore, just because we have not found the solution yet, does not mean that it does not exist. Persistence in the face of failure is not always foolhardy. Sometimes it’s just common-sense scientific process, applied to things outside of obvious science.\n\nI am a musician. I am a songwriter. I try with great effort in my art, in my performances, in my composing and songwriting to shine light on the stories of other people, sometimes in a precise moment of action or effort. Because it exemplifies a character trait that I respect and that could be emulated by more people.\n\nI can write a song about a Labor strike, about racial justice, homelessness, about the Shoah (the Holocaust), about fisherman, immigration, about the wonders of love, the splendor of nature, or the enthusiastic joy of a child. But if it is not framed as an invitation into the story and the lives of other people, if it is not framed as an invitation into ourselves, it falls short. Somehow a song, or the story that precedes a song needs to be an invitation - palms up and heart open - into a deeper consideration of something. Sometimes that something is joy! So, whimsy also has a place in the conversation.\n\nI have been a story teller. I have been an advocate for all sorts of social work, causes, justice movements, and laborers. I have been an advocate through my music for human rights, civil rights, climate justice, and civil discourse. And I have been a singer of love songs and lullabies.\n\nBut I have also been a minister of sorts, not of a given faith practice but as a spiritual humanist, ever interested in letting the power music give people permission to feel whatever they need to feel, in order to eventually arrive at a place of increased hopefulness. Music, art, dance, poetry, theater, singing together, being together, being in nature, having a good meal in the company of good people, all of these things can lead to greater hopefulness. They can also lead to tears and release. Laughter and release. Discomfort and release. Awareness and Ah-Ha!\n\nArt has the power to allow us to express what we do not know how to express in any other way, whether we have created the art or are witness to it and in the presence of it.\n\nSo, as a personal tool, as a personal practice, art is invaluable. But as a community practice, shared performance, shared singing, shared dancing, shared jamming, shared art of all forms can re-connect us to one another and to ourselves in unique and needed ways.\n\nMusic is the path I have chosen, it is what comes most naturally. And I see myself as a crafts-person engaged in an honorable trade. I am grateful for the skills and the tools I have been given and have been privileged to develop. I am grateful for the many people who have helped me along the way, who saw potential and passion in the same place and decided to support it within me. I am grateful to have grown up in a musical family where I was surrounded by the ongoing and exploratory relationship that all of my older siblings had with music. I am grateful that I had the chance to go to a marvelous music conservatory and to study with other committed and accomplished practitioners of music, in all of its many forms. I am grateful for that diversity and the awareness of how BIG music is.\n\nFrom the camaraderie I feel with other working musicians and artists, to the people like Jim Noble who share their world views and learned perspective with me, I continue to be a student. I am in the world, ever curious about nature, science, other cultures, other people, and what they know that I do not!\n\nI was asked recently in an interview what my legacy might be? I am hard pressed to define it. In part because I sincerely hope that at 51, my best and most creative years are still in front of me. I hope that my capacity for organizing, problem solving, and collaboration is just finding its legs. I hope that I will be blessed to work with friends I don’t yet know, in places I have yet to go, to be a part of exploring and helping to solve problems I cannot yet comprehend, or may not yet be aware of in this moment.\n\nBut I hope my legacy also includes some of the following: I hope my legacy begins and ends with a deep and abiding love for humanity in all of our failings and striving, in all of our dreams and successes. I hope that I am remembered as a lover of people. Because for all of the difficulties in the world and the people who seem to thrive on discord, my experience has been that the vast majority of people in the world are really decent. And given the chance to self-actualize, the chance to chase their dreams or dare to grow, most people will choose to do so. If I can encourage that in any way through my music, what a beautiful thing to have helped foster.\n\nI hope that I am recognized for the thoughtful and purposeful songwriter that I am and that I aspire to continue becoming. I hope that more musicians will look at my life and career (unorthodox as it is even for the music industry), and consider that they too do not need to fit into a specific mold in order to have an extraordinary life making music and bringing goodness into the world.\n\nI hope to be a bridgebuilder, a peace maker, a journalist of sorts through the music and stories I choose to put on stage and on my albums. I hope that part of my legacy is that more people are curious about the world around them and the people in it, and bother to know something about their neighbors. I hope that people understand that my purpose was never to win a Grammy. (Though it would be nice. HA!) My purpose was and is not commercial. My purpose is HUMAN. My process is relational, rather than transactional. My hope is to shine light on the good that I see in other people and in the world. And to lift up that goodness and reflect it back to the people who listen, that we all might see each other with less suspicion and greater hope for understanding and acceptance.\n\nWe may never witness the whole picture of what has been affected by our art or work. But we see evidence that people have been affected by our work in useful ways. And when someone is willing to share how they have been specifically impacted, through that one person we can reasonably see that many more people are being positively affected by our efforts.\n\nI don’t know what my legacy will be, but I hope it will be a legacy of hope. A discipline of hope. A hope carried forward by a lot of great music, good people, right relations, and productive collaborations. A hope that acknowledges complexity, while graciously side-stepping irrelevant complications. A belief that hope is not a Quixotic or Pollyannaish way of being. Rather, hope is how we find the strength to envision a world where positive change is possible, and in which we get to be a part of making that change happen.\n\n~ Joe Jencks\n\n(Written on a SW Flight from Chicago to Seattle 11-29-23.

It was inspired by a recent interview in which I was asked, “What is your legacy?” While feeling entirely unqualified to answer, I suddenly remembered standing under a Saturn V rocket at the Johnson Space Center with my friend Jim Noble. I remembered a question he asked me at the time, “Do you understand the difference between complicated and complex?” The ensuing conversation was fascinating.\n\nWishing you all the best as we head into the holidays. May they be gentle and restorative.\n\nIn Gratitude & Song,\n\n~ Joe Jencks (12-7-23)\n\nComplex, Not Complicated\n\nCopyright 2023 Joe Jencks, Turtle Bear Music\n\nMy friend Jim Noble is an architect, inventor, and ipso-facto engineer. One of his patented structural designs was adapted and used by NASA to house an experiment that needed to fly a couple miles behind the space shuttle on an orbital mission. How cool is that? He and I are both ardent fans of the space program, and of human exploration of our solar system, galaxy, and of interstellar space. We are both fascinated by the many extraordinary things humans have achieved, and the boundless things humans yet need to achieve, environmentally and otherwise. The world needs problem solvers who can work together, especially when it comes to environmental issues that touch on every aspect of human life and every society on this planet. We need big idea people. And we need people who know how to translate that into pragmatic process-driven solutions.\n\nJim Noble took me on a personally guided tour of the Johnson Space Center near Houston. As we were walking through the exhibits, he explained a great deal to me that that was not included in the kiosk write-ups about how and why certain things happened. He explained how specific problems were solved, and talked about some of the sub-processes (both successes and failures) that led to workable solutions.\n\nAt one point during our visit Jim asked me, “Do you understand the difference between complicated and complex?”\n\nI said, “I think I do, but please explain it to me from your perspective.”\n\nJim looked at me with a twinkle in his eye that suggested, maybe I did not in fact understand the difference. And patiently, with his beautiful Texan accent and graciousness, he dove into an explanation. This is what I remember him saying to me that day, while standing under a Saturn V rocket laying on its side at the Johnson Space Center.\n\nJim began, “Any great undertaking is necessarily complex. There are many stages. A rocket has many stages from the time it launches until the capsule, satellite, scientific package, or other piece of hardware or habitat is doing what it was intended to do. Whether in orbit, on its way to the Moon or Mars, or out of our solar system, there are many stages. But every one of those stages is made up of thousands of parts and pieces, of hardware and constructed machinery, and required process. Each step and component is essential to the success of the process and the objective.”\n\nHe continued, “Each one of those parts and pieces had to be invented and fabricated by people who understood their work with precision, and had an ability to grasp how their work would relate to the work of others. So, there are stages not just in the rocket, but in every part and piece, in every aspect of conception, creation, and assembly. At every stage in the process, there is trial and error as materials are tested, reconsidered based on experimentation, and re-created to compensate for unexpected outcomes. This is necessarily complex work. But it only becomes complicated when there are non-essential steps and stages included in the process. The job of a good inventor, designer, engineer, project coordinator, or fabricator is to remove every step of the process that does not NEED to be there. In this way, complicated is reduced to merely complex. It is the art of reducing a process to the most elemental and elegant number of steps required to meet the objective, while still doing so with reasonably assured outcomes and safety.”\n\nHis implications were clear, though understated. And my take-away is ever unfolding.\n\nWe live in a necessarily complex world. But there is a lot we could do personally and collectively to make it less complicated. We can reduce complicated to merely complex. Whether putting people on the Moon or solving problems of climate change, homelessness and poverty, or a lack of access to food, water, sanitary conditions, or healthcare. There is a way. There is always a way. If we get enough people working together for common purpose and check our egos at the door (and throughout the process), we can find solutions. Furthermore, just because we have not found the solution yet, does not mean that it does not exist. Persistence in the face of failure is not always foolhardy. Sometimes it’s just common-sense scientific process, applied to things outside of obvious science.\n\nI am a musician. I am a songwriter. I try with great effort in my art, in my performances, in my composing and songwriting to shine light on the stories of other people, sometimes in a precise moment of action or effort. Because it exemplifies a character trait that I respect and that could be emulated by more people.\n\nI can write a song about a Labor strike, about racial justice, homelessness, about the Shoah (the Holocaust), about fisherman, immigration, about the wonders of love, the splendor of nature, or the enthusiastic joy of a child. But if it is not framed as an invitation into the story and the lives of other people, if it is not framed as an invitation into ourselves, it falls short. Somehow a song, or the story that precedes a song needs to be an invitation - palms up and heart open - into a deeper consideration of something. Sometimes that something is joy! So, whimsy also has a place in the conversation.\n\nI have been a story teller. I have been an advocate for all sorts of social work, causes, justice movements, and laborers. I have been an advocate through my music for human rights, civil rights, climate justice, and civil discourse. And I have been a singer of love songs and lullabies.\n\nBut I have also been a minister of sorts, not of a given faith practice but as a spiritual humanist, ever interested in letting the power music give people permission to feel whatever they need to feel, in order to eventually arrive at a place of increased hopefulness. Music, art, dance, poetry, theater, singing together, being together, being in nature, having a good meal in the company of good people, all of these things can lead to greater hopefulness. They can also lead to tears and release. Laughter and release. Discomfort and release. Awareness and Ah-Ha!\n\nArt has the power to allow us to express what we do not know how to express in any other way, whether we have created the art or are witness to it and in the presence of it.\n\nSo, as a personal tool, as a personal practice, art is invaluable. But as a community practice, shared performance, shared singing, shared dancing, shared jamming, shared art of all forms can re-connect us to one another and to ourselves in unique and needed ways.\n\nMusic is the path I have chosen, it is what comes most naturally. And I see myself as a crafts-person engaged in an honorable trade. I am grateful for the skills and the tools I have been given and have been privileged to develop. I am grateful for the many people who have helped me along the way, who saw potential and passion in the same place and decided to support it within me. I am grateful to have grown up in a musical family where I was surrounded by the ongoing and exploratory relationship that all of my older siblings had with music. I am grateful that I had the chance to go to a marvelous music conservatory and to study with other committed and accomplished practitioners of music, in all of its many forms. I am grateful for that diversity and the awareness of how BIG music is.\n\nFrom the camaraderie I feel with other working musicians and artists, to the people like Jim Noble who share their world views and learned perspective with me, I continue to be a student. I am in the world, ever curious about nature, science, other cultures, other people, and what they know that I do not!\n\nI was asked recently in an interview what my legacy might be? I am hard pressed to define it. In part because I sincerely hope that at 51, my best and most creative years are still in front of me. I hope that my capacity for organizing, problem solving, and collaboration is just finding its legs. I hope that I will be blessed to work with friends I don’t yet know, in places I have yet to go, to be a part of exploring and helping to solve problems I cannot yet comprehend, or may not yet be aware of in this moment.\n\nBut I hope my legacy also includes some of the following: I hope my legacy begins and ends with a deep and abiding love for humanity in all of our failings and striving, in all of our dreams and successes. I hope that I am remembered as a lover of people. Because for all of the difficulties in the world and the people who seem to thrive on discord, my experience has been that the vast majority of people in the world are really decent. And given the chance to self-actualize, the chance to chase their dreams or dare to grow, most people will choose to do so. If I can encourage that in any way through my music, what a beautiful thing to have helped foster.\n\nI hope that I am recognized for the thoughtful and purposeful songwriter that I am and that I aspire to continue becoming. I hope that more musicians will look at my life and career (unorthodox as it is even for the music industry), and consider that they too do not need to fit into a specific mold in order to have an extraordinary life making music and bringing goodness into the world.\n\nI hope to be a bridgebuilder, a peace maker, a journalist of sorts through the music and stories I choose to put on stage and on my albums. I hope that part of my legacy is that more people are curious about the world around them and the people in it, and bother to know something about their neighbors. I hope that people understand that my purpose was never to win a Grammy. (Though it would be nice. HA!) My purpose was and is not commercial. My purpose is HUMAN. My process is relational, rather than transactional. My hope is to shine light on the good that I see in other people and in the world. And to lift up that goodness and reflect it back to the people who listen, that we all might see each other with less suspicion and greater hope for understanding and acceptance.\n\nWe may never witness the whole picture of what has been affected by our art or work. But we see evidence that people have been affected by our work in useful ways. And when someone is willing to share how they have been specifically impacted, through that one person we can reasonably see that many more people are being positively affected by our efforts.\n\nI don’t know what my legacy will be, but I hope it will be a legacy of hope.

Meath, IRE.\n\nAnne Feeney, Pete Seeger & Dia de Los Muertos\n\nCopyright - 2023 Joe Jencks, Turtle Bear Music\n\nI awoke one morning last week from a dream that was so real, that it took me some time to draw the delicate boundary between the waking and the dreaming worlds. In the dream, I was performing a songwriter-in-the-round concert with Anne Feeney and Pete Seeger. It was a wonderful sharing of music in community. We went the whole evening just trading songs, and singing and playing with each other as the song called for it. It was so genuinely joyful to spend an evening in the presence of these two cherished colleagues and friends.\n\nIn the dream, we were playing a concert for a Folk Music series at a Unitarian Universalist church in Cincinnati. I know it was Cincinnati, because many of my Cincinnati friends and audience were there. I could call them out by name, even now. I could see their faces, know their stories in the waking world. Toshi (Pete’s wife) was sitting in the audience as well. Every once in a while, she would look at her watch and then at Pete who was singing away, seemingly without a care in the world. And then she would settle back in, knowing Pete was in his happy place and we were going to be here for a while.\n\nAnne, Pete, and I sang songs of peace, hope, and possibility alongside some stronger indictments of certain issues and practices. But the tone of the show was uplifting and empowering. I was so unbelievably happy to be making music again with these two power-houses of progressive Folk. And the audience was rapt, lingering on every word and melody. We sang with each other and the audience sang along. It was a perfect night of music, together.\n\nWhen I awoke, I was still humming something to myself. I don’t now recall what it was. But I kept remembering moments from the evening as if it were a concert I had actually given, the night before. I got out of bed, and it was solidly 10 minutes into my day before I remembered the implausibility of this scenario. I’m the only one of the three of us in that song-swap performance who is still alive on this plain of existence. With a certain solemnity, I reconciled myself to the realities while still holding the warmth and joy of the night before.\n\nIt was all so plausible, because I was privileged to perform with Pete Seeger on several occasions. I gratefully played at least a dozen co-bill concerts with Anne Feeney. And I was on shared stages at Festivals and Social Justice events another dozen times with Anne and a few times with Pete and Anne. The whole dream was 100% plausible. Until I remembered that the price tag for joining that song circle would be high. I had a melancholy moment, remembering fondly my time in musical and activist community with both Anne Feeney and Pete Seeger. And then I set to the tasks and projects of my day.\n\nOn Dia de Los Muertos, I usually set out an ofrenda. Photos of loved ones, bits of festival and treat food, maybe a bit of something each person on the altar of memory liked in particular. I even got a bottle of Barley Wine to pour a toast to my brother Jerry on this year’s ofrenda. I just took a look at the tour schedule. It turns out that I will be home for one evening next week, and it’s Dia de Los Muertos. I will set out a photo of Anne and one of Pete, alongside those of family of origin and other friends, and play a few of their songs, just because.\n\nIt is said that on the night of Dia de Los Muertos (Samhain in the Irish Pagan traditions) that the veil that separates the spirit world from this one is at the thinnest point of the entire year. Every year I hope to feel the connection with the ancestors who have passed. Parents, my brother Jerry, dear friends, and beloved colleagues. But this year, I will be listening especially closely to see if Anne Feeney and Pete Seeger have something specific to say to me. Their visit in the dreamscape being so close to this time when the veil thins, seems meaningful. Whatever they have to say to me, sure they must have said to me a dozen of times while they were alive. I just need to listen with special care, that I might hear their wisdom one more time. I need to listen so that I remember why I was walking in their footsteps in the first place. And then share in the power of music, healing, community, and positive change bestowed by these beloved friends departed with the ones who are here now, with me on the journey.\n\nAs we approach Dia de Los Muertos, I invite the question: Whose wisdom are you missing, right now? And, how might you make room in your mind and heart and life, for them to give you a few signs of comfort and guidance?\n\n~ Joe Jencks\n\nA midwest autumn sunset... reflected off the roof of my car. ~ JJ\n\nFall 2023 Tour Dates & Thoughts on Radical Hospitality\n\nDear Friends in Music,\n\nIt has been far too long since I have written, and that means it was a busy summer and early fall.

Kildare, IRE)\n\nChoosing Radical Hospitality, Regardless\n\nCopyright, 2023 - Joe Jencks, Turtle Bear Music\n\nI was born (unbeknownst to me until my late teens) a citizen of The Republic of Ireland. A Republic which from its inception was defined by stories of heroes and villains, patriots and traitors, laborers and radicals, alongside the ordinary and the innocent. A country whose history is complex and whose people are gracious in spite of countless generations of challenge and struggle. It was not until I was in my late 20s that I truly heard the call of this other motherland. But when I did hear her clarion call, I knew that my future was inextricably linked with my Granddad’s past, in Ireland.\n\nI am returned via Aer Lingus from Shannon to Boston. I look up in the terminal and immediately see a sign with a “male” stick figure and an arrow denoting the direction to a men’s room. I am surprised not to read the words “An Fir.” Irish for The Man. I don’t speak Irish. I understand a few words, phrases, and idioms. And yet after 2 and ½ weeks in this other motherland, it is odd to return to the U.S. and see signs only in English.\n\nLess than 5% of Ireland speaks Irish as their native tongue (though about 40% can speak some of the language). But this is enough to have bi-lingual signs everywhere. Roughly 20% of Canada speaks Quebecois (French Canadian) and they acknowledge that they are a bi-lingual nation. Nearly 15% of the U.S. speaks Spanish as their native tongue, with countless more speaking it as a learned language. And still, we refuse to acknowledge that we are bi-lingual. Food for thought.\n\nWhen I am in Ireland, I hear the Irish language spoken and some part of me still expects to understand it. It is the language of generations of my ancestors. I understand its cadence, its musicality, its emotional content. But I don’t know the words. Even less so than was my mother, am I a child of two cultures. I am an American. What claim do I have to this extraordinary land? And yet the laws of The Republic declare me a Citizen of Ireland by birth. And I claim it with pride, with confusion, and with gratitude.\n\nI am a dual U.S. / Irish citizen. And in some parts of the world I will be confused for being Irish first. Usually I am tagged as being Canadian. I’ll take that too, if someone is offering. I have roots in Quebec. But I am, by cultural inculcation, an American. That is a complex thing to own these days. Especially when traveling abroad. But we must each reconcile our contradictions and complexities of identity in some fashion, and this is part of mine: to be of multiple cultures and ideas, and to keep finding a way to feel at home both in my locations and in my own skin.\n\nI love the ocean and I love mountains. I could not wait to move to Seattle after my senior year at music conservatory. Both mountains and ocean in one place. Marvelous! I met a lot of Irish ex-pats there. Then I began traveling in Ireland, and my love of the Puget Sound region made more sense to me. I go to Ireland now, and I am struck by how many parts of the island remind me either of where I grew up in northern, Illinois or they remind me of Washington State. Both places feel like home to me.\n\nAnd still, I have lived much of my life on the road. I live a life seeking a deeper understanding of MANY cultures and places. Through friendships with people from other lands and cultures, by getting to know people from different cultures within the United States, and through cuisine and music and literature and spiritual practice, I seek to know more. I seek to understand my place in this world, and to understand better, how I can help others feel more welcome.\n\nAnd for now, this is my détente with the complex notions of cultural identity. We are all strangers, born into a complex social system we did not choose, and over which we hold little or no sway. But we do get to choose how we act in the world. We can choose to be gracious, hospitable, welcoming, inclusive, generous, and aware. And in doing so, we are a part of transforming the idea of r"
