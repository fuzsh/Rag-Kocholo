        "text": "Uncategorized\n\nPittsburgh Ballet Theatre Welcomes Two New Apprentices\n\nPittsburgh Ballet Theatre (PBT) is pleased to welcome two promising young dancers as company apprentices for the 2022 – 2023 season. Ariana Chernyshev and Maria Eduarda Pinto will gain exceptional professional experience and enjoy exciting performance opportunities with the PBT company under the leadership of Artistic Director Susan Jaffe.\n\n“After the success of the inaugural year of the apprenticeship program, I am excited at the possibilities inherent in these dancers’ futures,” Ms. Jaffe says. “I look forward to nurturing them throughout the course of the 2022 – 2023 season and helping them take their artistry to new heights.”\n\nIn addition to the invaluable experience of rehearsing and performing alongside PBT company dancers, the apprentices will have the option to pursue certificate or college degree programs through partnerships with Point Park University, Seton Hill University, Community College of Allegheny County and Chatham University. PBT is grateful to Leslie Fleischner and her late husband Hans for their thoughtful support of young dancers pursuing careers in the arts.\n\nAbout the Apprentices\n\nAriana Chernyshev\n\nAriana Chernyshev was born in Pittsburgh and trained at Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre School (PBT School) from Pre-Ballet all the way through to the Graduate program. Additionally, she attended summer programs at Pacific Northwest Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Cincinnati Ballet and The Washington School of Ballet. In 2019, Ariana accepted a trainee position at The Washington School of Ballet, where she performed with the company and danced lead roles in classical and contemporary works with the school. As a Graduate student at PBT School, she has had the honor of performing with the company in George Balanchine’s Rubies, Terrence S. Orr’s The Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty. In 2022, Ariana performed as a guest artist of Tulsa Ballet’s Swan Lake. Ariana enjoys teaching yoga to the high school students at PBT School and is thrilled to perform Susan Jaffe’s Swan Lake in May!\n\n“Pittsburgh is home, and I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to perform for my beautiful city and its vibrant community,” Ariana says. “We are so lucky to have Susan Jaffe as artistic director and I’m beyond excited to be a part of this new chapter for PBT!”\n\nMaria Eduarda Pinto\n\nMaria Eduarda Pinto was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she started taking ballet class at the age of two. She joined the Maria Olenewa Dance School and finished her studies at the Lyceu Dance School supervised by Lorena Boaventura. In 2020, she trained at Miami City Ballet with Aranxta Ochoa and Alexander Iziliaev. She won several awards in competitions in Brazil and was a finalist in the Latin America Selections of the Prix de Lausanne and the Youth America Grand Prix, in addition to participating in several international competitions such as Tanzolymp, ADCIBC, WBC and VKIBC.\n\n“I am very happy and excited to join Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre as an apprentice because it has always been my dream as a dancer to start a professional career in a company with several renowned masters and excellent dancers,” Maria says. “It makes me very excited to give my best this season.”\n\nPrincipal Dancer Alexandra Kochis Prepares to Take Her Final Bow\n\nAfter 27 years as a professional dancer and 16 years at Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Principal Dancer Alexandra Kochis has announced that she will be retiring at the end of the 2021-2022 season. Her performance as Odette-Odile in Swan Lake with the PBT Orchestra on Saturday, May 14 at 7:30 p.m. will be her last with the company. Alexa has been a principal dancer with PBT since 2009.\n\n“It has been a pleasure to have the chance to work with Alexa over these last two years,” says Artistic Director Susan Jaffe. “The exquisite artistry of her performances will truly be missed by all of us. We wish her well on her next chapter.”\n\nOriginally from North Andover, Massachusetts, Alexa began her ballet training at the age of 5, and studied six days a week throughout her childhood. After graduating high school, she planned to attend college at Georgetown University, but changed her mind when Boston Ballet’s Artistic Director of the time Anna Marie Holmes offered her a position with Boston Ballet II in the corps de ballet. Alexa joined Boston Ballet II in 1995 and the company in 1998, where she met her husband Christopher Budzynski.\n\nIn 2006, Alexa and Chris relocated to Pittsburgh and both joined Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre — Alexa as a member of the corps de ballet and Chris as a soloist. Alexa became a principal dancer in 2009.\n\n“I felt very supported and valued by Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre for the dancer that I was,” she says. “That allowed me to put myself out there more. Because the repertoire was so diverse, it was really food for growth. I certainly have danced roles and worked with choreographers that I never dreamed I would.”\n\nFavorite productions for Alexa from her career include Don Quixote, Giselle, Jean-Christophe Maillot’s Romeo et Juliette, George Balanchine’s Diamonds, Jerome Robbins’ The Concert, William Forsythe’s In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated, Jiří Kylián’s Petite Mort and John Neumeier’s A Streetcar Named Desire, a production that she calls “a seminal moment for PBT.”\n\n“What a wonderful experience it has been to watch Alexa’s journey through this art form,” says Alexa’s husband and PBT School Faculty member Chris. “She has touched many lives and souls as she transcended the boundaries of the technique.”\n\nOf her final performance in Swan Lake this May, Alexa says she is thankful for the technically difficult, physically demanding nature of the role of Odette-Odile. “The technique takes my mind off the emotional aspect of retiring because I focus on the work,” Alexa says. “I’m a big dramatic enthusiast, so it’s always nice when I get to die at the end of a ballet,” she adds.\n\nAfter retiring, Alexa says there are many new possibilities on the horizon that she looks forward to, including teaching dance, writing fiction — an endeavor she began investigating during the pandemic — and lots of travel and camping trips in the mix.\n\n“Throughout my career, I feel like PBT has preserved a familial ethos. I’m really glad to have been a part of it,” Alexa says.\n\nAudiences can see Alexa’s final performances with Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre at Swan Lake with the PBT Orchestra, running May 6 – 15 at the Benedum Center. Her retirement will be recognized at her final performance on Saturday, May 14 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nSwan Queen Spotlight: Alexandra Kochis\n\nSince she began her professional dance career in 1995, Principal Dancer Alexandra Kochis has danced six full length productions of Swan Lake, including two productions with Boston Ballet and four with Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. She has danced a variety of roles, from a guest in the First Act and Swan Corps to the Pas de Trois, Cygnets, Neopolitan and Odette-Odile. As she prepares to play the Swan Queen for her fourth and final time, Alexa shares with us why this production is special to her and why you should go see it!\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nWhat has it been like to learn Swan Lake under the direction of Susan Jaffe, who was such an iconic Swan Queen?\n\nThe experience of being coached by Susan has been very inspiring. I love that she comes at the role of the Swan Queen from such a human perspective. She very much wants us to convey the underlying emotions — of uneasiness, trepidation, elation and, ultimately, betrayal and heartbreak — that make up Odette’s character arc throughout the story. Because, underneath it all, Odette is a woman who has been transformed into a swan, but she still thinks and feels and loves like you and I. Susan also has such a lush and full style that really encourages us to bend and move and use our entire bodies to fully depict the emotions we are trying to convey.\n\nWhat part of the ballet holds a special place in your heart?\n\nI feel like there are too many favorite moments to pick just one! I love the moment, in the second act adagio when Odette chooses to submit to falling in love with Seigfried. She clasps Seigfried’s hand to her cheek and turns to face him. It’s an intimate and still moment I get to share with my partner — in this case William Moore — in the midst of all this difficult technique. I love when we can speak to each other with our eyes and convey how full our hearts are across the vast expanses of the theater.\n\nI love that the music builds to a frenzied crescendo during the coda of the second act. It is intensely empowering to stand in the wings as the corps de ballet charges across the stage in their final arabesque chugs and then, as I run out for my coda, the music hushes and the conductor seems to hover on my very breath.\n\nI love dancing as Odile in the end of the third act pas de deux when Siegfried kneels before me and I know that I have succeeded in my seduction. I throw my head back in a movement full of wicked, maniacal triumph and I am soaring on this wave of physical endorphins and music-induced euphoria. It’s pretty incredible.\n\nAnd, I always love dying on stage, so getting to hurl myself into the lake at the end of this marathon of a ballet that I have just run — that’s pretty great, too.\n\nHow do you prepare for this role?\n\nBallet class everyday. Many hours of rehearsals and coaching with Susan and our rehearsal directors Steven Annegarn and Marianna Tcherkassy for the pas de deuxs and variations. Then, as we get closer to the shows, we start putting the acts together with the corps and other dancers. Finally, we run through the whole ballet to get a feeling of the stamina and pacing required. I also try to work in cross training with pilates, gyrotonics and cardio.\n\nWe are also fortunate to be working with a dramaturg, Byam Stevens, for this production. Byam is focusing on the acting, mime and character development for each individual partnership.\n\nWalk us through what it is like to embody both Odette and Odile.\n\nSwan Lake is special because I get to work on two very different flavors of movement — the slow, soft lyricism of Odette as well as the crisp, sharp dynamism of Odile. It allows a dancer to tap into two different sides of themself because, really, everyone has a little of both characters within.\n\nHow many pairs of pointe shoes have you used during the rehearsal process?\n\nIt’s hard to calculate exactly how many pairs of pointe shoes I’ve used to rehearse Swan Lake because we have been working on it off and on for a while (since about January, I believe). I try to keep a rotation of shoes going so that each individual pair will have time to dry out and be re-glued between wearings so they last a bit longer. Plus, the different acts of the ballet require shoes to be slightly harder or softer depending on the types of steps I’ll be doing. All told, I will probably go through 20 pairs or so by the time May 14th rolls around.\n\nCan you talk about your pre-show ritual?\n\nMy pre-show ritual is pretty straightforward. I like to allow myself lots of time. I don’t like to rush. I’ll take company warmup onstage with the rest of the company. I love taking class onstage. There is a hallowed-ness about it — the darkened theater, the space. Then I’ll wrap myself up in a warm blanket, put on some chill, feel-good music and do my makeup. Then, about a half hour before showtime, I’ll start putting my shoes and costume on to warm them up and get settled in them. It takes a bit of body heat to soften everything up and get them feeling like a part of my own body. At about 15 minutes out, I’ll head to the stage, check any props, pre-set water and tissues, feel the floor a bit and maybe practice any tricky moments with my partner. Then, I just take a few deep breaths and try to savor every moment.\n\nWhat does it mean to you for Swan Lake to be your final performance before you retire?\n\nI love that I am able to dance a full-length story ballet for my final performance because portraying a character and the dramatic side of ballet has always been one of my favorite things about this art form.\n\nBeing able to dance full-length Swan Lake — a big, beautiful ballet — on the Benedum Center stage — a big, beautiful theater — to music played by a live orchestra is truly one of the pinnacles of any dancer’s career. It will be somewhat of a “full circle moment” for me as I can still VISCERALLY feel what it was like to stand on the side of the stage in my pose as a member of corps de ballet in my second year as a professional dancer. I remember how it felt to hear that gorgeous Tchaikovsky score soaring out of the pit during the second act adagio. It gave me absolute goosebumps back then, and now that I am the one dancing that adagio as Swan Queen — well, it feels that much richer, I suppose.\n\nAlexa will perform as Odette-Odile on Saturday, May 7 at 2 p.m. and her final performance will be Saturday, May 14 at 7:30 p.m. Don’t miss your chance to see her final bow with Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre!\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nSusan Jaffe: Swan Queen\n\nWhen Susan Jaffe was 19 years old, she danced the lead role in Swan Lake for the first time with American Ballet Theatre. Forty years later, Susan’s journey with Swan Lake has come full circle as she finishes out her first full season as artistic director of Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre with her own choreography of this iconic show. Read on to learn more about how Susan’s extensive experience informed her choreography for this new production, running May 6 – 15 at the Benedum Center!\n\nBuy Swan Lake Tickets\n\nIt all started when Susan’s coach at American Ballet Theatre (ABT) Elena Tchernichova taught her Swan Lake behind closed doors. As a very young member of the corps de ballet, Susan had to learn the role in secret for fear that the company members would be upset that someone so young was learning the role. At the age of 19, she danced the first of what would be many performances of Swan Lake as Odette-Odile while on tour with ABT in Miami, with Mikhail Baryshnikov playing Prince Siegfried.\n\nWhen she danced Swan Lake for the first time in New York City on April 28, 1982, The New York Times published a glowing review of her performance. “Susan Jaffe is the American Ballet Theatre’s wonderful new discovery, the star of the future who radiates a star quality so vibrantly now at the age of 19 that one is dazzled at the prospect of her development,” wrote New York Times Dance Critic Anna Kisselgoff. The review continues, “[Susan’s performance] was a beautiful triumph, a performance of amazing depth for a novice, but also thrilling in itself, in a young dancer’s understanding of this great Tchaikovsky ballet.” Read the full review here.\n\nSusan danced Swan Lake every year after that, and was coached by some amazing people, including the legendary ballerina Natalia Makarova. In 1989, Susan was introduced to Irina Kolpakova, who had been Baryshnikov’s mentor and was the last student of the great Russian pedagogue Agrippina Vaganova.\n\n“I wanted to learn from Kolpakova so much, I would’ve done anything,” Susan says. “So I basically stood in front of her with my arms at my side and said, ‘I don’t know anything. Teach me from scratch.’ I learned so much more than technique from her. She was one of the most brilliant, heartfelt performers that the world has ever seen.”\n\nSusan went on to dance Swan Lake all around the world, guesting with companies in Sweden, England, Vienna and more. “I got to work with a lot of brilliant partners and experience other companies dancing Swan Lake as well,” Susan says.\n\nWatch Susan performing the role of the Black Swan for American Ballet Theatre here:\n\nHaving danced the role of Odette-Odile so many times, Susan developed a keen understanding of the characters’ motivation, the symbolism in the music and dancing, and the themes of the ballet.\n\n“It’s a great story of love and betrayal, and it really reflects our humanity,” Susan says. “When I sit in the audience and watch it, there are so many moments that I am moved to the depth of my soul.”\n\nSusan says that one of the reasons why she loves Swan Lake is because of the wide range of emotions that the dancer portraying Odette-Odile has to convey. “It is the ultimate test of a ballerina’s powers, not only in character, but in physicality,” Susan says. “The dancer must show the softness and vulnerability of Odette, and the attack of Odile, a femme fatale. You have to develop all of those things in order to be a real interpreter of this role.\n\nSusan is bringing her expertise to this new production with her own choreography created after the original choreography by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. “It feels incredibly scary, but also incredibly exhilarating to be choreographing my own Swan Lake,” Susan says. While the storyline in Susan’s production will remain traditional, the new production coming to the Benedum this May will be her own rendition.\n\nFor example, Susan’s critical eye has adjusted Odile’s choreography. “When I was growing up, I saw a lot of Odiles that were just plain mean, and I thought, ‘The prince isn’t that stupid,’” Susan says. “If you’re going to be deceptive, you’re going to be alluring, kind, everything that the prince wants. So, I think that honors that the prince is truly deceived, not just by magic but by intention. I think, in that way, it’s almost more evil.”\n\nOf course, when the prince isn’t looking, Susan says Odile will be glancing an eye at Rothbart, letting the audience in on the trickery happening onstage. “That’s how I interpreted the Black Swan — not as being mean spirited, but as being a siren,” Susan says. “I certainly had a lot of fun with that.”\n\nThe ending is another place where Susan has added her personal touch. “There are many endings to Swan Lake,” she says. “Mine is one of tragedy and redemption all at the same time.

Elizabeth Devanney, Sujanya Dhillon, Madeline Gradle and Jacob Patrick Miller will receive access to academic programs through university partnerships along with performance opportunities with the PBT company. Apprenticeship positions have been made possible through a generous gift from Hans and Leslie Fleischner.\n\n“We received hundreds of applications from young dancers around the country,” Jaffe said, “and I truly believe these four have exceptional talent. I’m thrilled to have them join our team.”\n\nDevanney, Dhillon and Miller were chosen from among virtual applications. Gradle is a student in Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre School’s (PBT School) graduate program.\n\nIn addition to attending company class and rehearsals with PBT, apprentices will be able to continue their academic education through partnerships with Seton Hill University, Community College of Allegheny County and Chatham University. Apprentices will be offered the opportunity to take courses toward certifications, like entrepreneurship and exercise science, that can be applied to a degree.\n\nApprentices will start their positions with PBT in the 2021-2022 Season. A fifth apprentice will be chosen from among PBT School’s summer program students.\n\nAbout the Apprentices\n\nElizabeth Devanney\n\nLiz Devanney, of Bel Air, Maryland, began her training with Dance Conservatory of Maryland and continued with University of North Carolina School of the Arts (UNCSA.) After graduating from high school in 2019, she was invited to join the professional division at Pacific Northwest Ballet (PNB). She has attended summer programs at Pacific Northwest Ballet, Carolina Ballet, Boston Ballet SDP, School of American Ballet, and Next Generation Ballet. In 2020, she was selected for the Royal Danish Ballet – PNB Exchange Program and was one of 25 young dancers awarded a scholarship from the American Friends of the Paris Opera & Ballet to support her continued training. Her repertoire includes Kent Stowell’s Cinderella, Ethan Steifel’s The Nutcracker, Susan Jaffe’s Carmina Terra, Helen Pickett’s Petal, Kingdom of the Shade’s from Natalia Makarova’s La Bayadére and George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker, Concerto Barocco and Serenade.\n\nSujanya Dhillon\n\nSujanya Dhillon, from Vancouver, Canada, has trained with Goh Ballet Academy, Miami City Ballet School and San Francisco Ballet School and has attended summer programs at all three. She received First Place Scholarships from Coastal Capital Savings and Affinity Dance in 2017, was awarded the Shakti Award for Artistic Achievement in 2019, and received the British Columbia Arts Council Grant in both 2018 and 2020. She also received a Young Artists Relief Fund grant from The American Friends of the Paris Opera & Ballet in 2020, created to support artists during the times of COVID-19. Her repertoire includes excerpts from La Bayadére, Don Quixote and George Balanchine’s Coppélia, as well as Goh Ballet Academy’s Four Seasons, Peter and the Wolf and The Nutcracker.\n\nMadeline Gradle\n\nMadeline Gradle, of Falls Church, Virginia, joins Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre from the PBT School Graduate Program. She received early dance training with Arlington Center for Dance and The Washington School of Ballet, and attended summer programs with American Ballet Theatre: New York, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, and Exploring Ballet with Suzanne Farrell. Madeline danced as an apprentice with The Suzanne Farrell Ballet for four years, expanding her repertoire with George Balanchine’s Chaconne, Stars and Stripes, Tzigane, and Walpurgisnacht, among others. She has performed with Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre in productions of George Balanchine’s Rubies, Giselle, The Sleeping Beauty, and Terrence S. Orr’s The Nutcracker. Additionally, Madeline enjoys teaching in the PBT School’s Children and Community Divisions.\n\nJacob Patrick Miller\n\nJacob Miller began his ballet training at Northeast Dance Center in Lawrence,Massachusetts. He left home to continue his training at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts (UNSCA) in 2016, where he was awarded the Gillian Murphy Scholarship. After receiving his high school diploma in dance, Miller stayed at UNCSA for college and is currently working toward his BFA in Dance Performance. While at school, Miller worked with many renowned choreographers, such as Goyo Montero, Aszure Barton and Susan Jaffe. He has also performed principal roles in classical and neoclassical ballets, such as Marius Petipa’s The Sleeping Beauty and George Balanchine’s Concerto Barocco. Miller is thrilled to join Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre as an apprentice after graduation!\n\nConnecting in New Ways in the Time of COVID-19\n\nSince March 2020, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre (PBT) School has transformed ballet learning into a virtual experience. Home Zoom classes became the norm for the end of the 2019-2020 school year, and continued into the fall even as studios reopened with limited capacity. During the pandemic, PBT School Instructor Jamie Erin Murphy seized the opportunity in remote learning as a chance to connect PBT School Pre-professional students (ages 13+) to a rich array of local artists and teachers.\n\nIn September 2020, Murphy created the Pittsburgh Connections Class Series, calling on the relationships she forged in her career as a modern, contemporary and jazz instructor for PBT School, accessibility program instructor for PBT’s education department, and freelance artist in the Pittsburgh dance community. Each Saturday, Pre-professional students – who spent most of their week in the studio – were digitally introduced to one of 18 guest teachers and artists, ranging in style from contemporary ballet and jazz to West African, Latin ballroom and Indian Kathak.\n\nGuest artists slowdanger, a multidisciplinary performance entity co-founded by Anna Thompson and Taylor Knight, feel that exposure to diversified styles of dance is vital to the learning experience – especially within a ballet-focused curriculum.\n\n“Codified dance training focused on Western forms of dance can often view or categorize embodied experiences through a hierarchical lens,” they said. “As we continue to examine how our worlds must be reoriented towards more equitable change, this series provided young dancers with a broad range of moving experiences. This is essential in setting young dancers up for the many possibilities that are currently unfolding within the dance field.”\n\n“The breadth and depth of what other dance forms have to offer can be so enriching and expansive to one’s ballet training and to the formation of one’s burgeoning artistic voice,” added Former PBT Principal Julia Erickson. “Even if these students go on to join classical ballet companies, they will absolutely utilize these skills as they dance myriad styles within the scope of a modern day ballet company repertory.”\n\nWhile learning new ideas and dance styles, students and teachers were also exploring what it meant to be physically apart. Despite the distance, guest artist Gia Cacalano still felt like connections were strong. Cacalano, a movement and visual artist, choreographer, instant composer, educator and performer, presented a unique class exploring a keener sensory awareness using proprioception, interoception and experiential anatomy.\n\n“It was an honor to connect with the students and be challenged within the ‘limitations’ of our current situation in distance,” Cacalano said. “Our greatest opportunities to invent, evolve, explore and create derive from the challenges and perceived obstacles in which to problem solve.”\n\nShannon Murphy, a dance artist and educator living in Philadelphia, also used her class to connect the students to their body. Shannon is a certified practitioner of the Franklin Method, a somatic practice that combines Dynamic Neuro-cognitive Imagery™, functional anatomy and movement practices – and she’s Jamie Erin Murphy’s sister. Her class utilized the constraints of learning remotely by focusing on slowing down, noticing bodily sensations and sharing experiences. After a COVID-influenced year, it helped to relieve stress, take a break from the screens and focus inwardly in the moment.\n\n“A career in dance has surprises and opportunities that change our lives just as much as the disappointments that make us question everything,” Shannon said. “Today’s dancer is a dancer that responds to the stresses of life, that takes care of themselves as much as they care for the dancer next to them, and can still see and feel the magic of dance. I hope that we can reflect on this past year from the future and understand that this did not ruin us but gave us skills to adapt, heal and thrive.”\n\n“I think it’s important for not only the students to be able to learn from [the guest artists],” Jamie Erin Murphy said, “but also the staff and the organization can learn and grow from these different artists explaining their backgrounds and what we don’t know about what they do and what’s happening in Pittsburgh.”\n\nGuest artist Naina Green, founding director of Courtyard Dancers of Pittsburgh, connected to PBT staff and faculty as well as PBT School students. She shared the history and future of Kathak dance around the world and in Pittsburgh through a virtual lunch and learn hosted by the PBT Equity Project Transformation Team, which strives to discuss and implement Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility (IDEA) practices into the organization.\n\nKatrina Chen, a 16-year-old Level 8 student from San Francisco, recognized the unique opportunity learning from Pittsburgh Connections Class Series guest teachers and artists.\n\n“Not only does learning from a different dancer enhance one’s personal repertoire,” Chen said, “but learning the deep rooted culture that is embedded within the dance form is a way of honoring and passing down the tradition through dance. I am more intrigued with the sharing of cultural experiences through dance as a way to educate myself on another’s culture. The more we as a community can respect each other’s differences, the more we are able to unite as a society.”\n\nIn addition to learning different styles of dance, Murphy hoped the series would bring greater awareness to the dance scene outside of the PBT bubble. PBT School is eager to make the Pittsburgh Connections Class Series a Pre-professional tradition – a milestone for PBT School students in the Student Division to look forward to as they become Pre-professionals.\n\nThe series serves as a connection between students and teachers, staff and artists, and PBT and the community. Guest artists, such as Shanna Simons Dance collaborators Shanna Simons and Brady Sanders, and Michele de la Reza of Attack Theatre, will be part of Open Air: A Series in Celebration of the Performing Arts, a two-week outdoor series featuring more than 20 local performing arts organizations.\n\nAfter a year of darkened theaters, supporting Pittsburgh’s performing arts community is more crucial than ever.\n\n“It is getting the awareness out for our dance community that has struggled in the last year,” Murphy said. “We don’t have performances. If we get more awareness of what is happening with smaller companies or independent artists in the city, that’s huge for the dance community here. That’s one new face in an audience and or watching an online performance.”\n\nQ&A – The Students’ Experience\n\nWhy is it important for you as a student to learn from dancers of different voices, styles and cultures?\n\nTaking classes in such a wide selection of styles has the power to develop students’ ballet dancing. Different teachers may have a new way of explaining an idea that didn’t make sense before, make you think about your dancing in a new way, challenge you to really examine your relationship with the space around you. Every Pittsburgh Connections Class I attended, I was amazed at how each teacher brought something new to the table; every class added a new element to my dancing as well as myself as a person.\n\n– Amelia Bandy, PBT School Level 6 student from the Greater Pittsburgh Area\n\nWhy do you think this type of learning and networking experience is important for ballet-focused students?\n\nBallet-focused students are usually very keen on becoming professional ballet dancers specifically. For some, this path is perfect. But, even among the small community of Pre-professional dancers, many will go into companies or performances that are not strictly ballet. It is important for these students to be exposed to other styles and artists in their area that can help expand their interest and artistic palette for non-classical styles. This way the students can start interacting with outside influences early on and enter other artistic communities in their area. They can then take part in educational opportunities and watch performances in other styles that they might end up auditioning for and performing in later in their careers.\n\n– Caterina Baker, PBT School Level 8 student from Rochester, NY\n\nDid you find connections with different dance styles throughout the series that you hadn’t experienced before?\n\nYes. I have definitely found many styles of dance that I enjoyed very much doing that I had never done before, like commercial jazz/musical theatre, learning how to move my body and help it heal if it’s sore, and improv class. These were some of my favorite classes that we learned, because they all taught me something that really interested me.\n\n– Brady Allen, PBT School Level 8 student from Pleasantville, NY\n\nGuest Artists Involved:\n\nChrisala Brown\n\nGia Cacalano\n\nMichia Carmack\n\nKaitlin Dann\n\nMichele de la Reza\n\nJulia Erickson\n\nNaina Green\n\nMadeline Kendall\n\nKiki Lucas\n\nJames Washington Manning\n\nJamie Erin Murphy\n\nShannon Murphy\n\nPearlann Porter\n\nMario Quinn\n\nBrady Sanders\n\nShana Simmons\n\nRozana Sweeney\n\nAnna Thompson/Taylor Knight\n\nThe Profound Impact of a PBT School Scholarship\n\nMeet Kaila Lewis!\n\nIf you’ve followed Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre School on social media over the past year, you’ve witnessed the evolution of dance instruction from studios to screens and back again. Here PBT School’s Children’s Division Coordinator Kaila Lewis talks about her history at PBT and what it’s been like to teach ballet fundamentals virtually.\n\nQ: What ignited your passion for ballet?\n\nA: My parents enrolled me in ballet classes when I was two years old, because I was not old enough for preschool at the time. I immediately fell in love with it and have fond memories of performing from a young age.\n\nQ: Even with a mask on, your face is a familiar one at Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre. How has your journey unfolded here?\n\nA: I’ve actually been involved with PBT School for almost 23 years, and it all started because of a scholarship. I began as a student in 1998 and started assisting younger classes while training in the Grad program. Every year, I gained more experience which led to more responsibilities. I’ve been a full-time faculty member since 2017.\n\nQ: What do you teach now?\n\nA: I teach the majority of the Children’s Division classes from Grown-Up and Me through our Pre-Ballet 6 and Ballet Foundations classes. I also teach the Preparatory level and Levels 1, 2 and 3 in the Student Division.\n\nQ: You must love your job. What’s your favorite part?\n\nA: My favorite part of teaching ballet, especially to the younger dancers is getting to create the magic. Ballet can be so magical, and the early years are so important to be able to put the love for the art form in motion.\n\nQ: This time last year, the faculty and staff at PBT School were faced with major challenges. What was that like?\n\nA: I started with making videos for all of the levels in March 2020, and by April we started Zoom classes. It was so refreshing to get to see my students’ faces. I think that during an uncertain time, keeping up with their ballet training gave the students a sense of normalcy as well as a movement and creative outlet. It certainly is not easy but I am proud of how the school has kept going and how the students have remained committed.\n\nQ: It must have been so nice to see your students, but that comes at a cost that many can’t afford, especially during times like this. Gratefully, PBT offers donor-funded scholarships to students in Levels 6 and above so that they can continue to pursue their dreams. Why would you encourage someone to contribute to scholarships?\n\nA: Ballet promotes structure, discipline and passion. And while not all of my students will have the same path as me, I believe that it sets children up for success in all areas. It is usually evident during their school years because of how they learn to manage their time between school and ballet. They also tend to do well in school because they have been trained to work hard, accept constructive criticism and be attentive. I think these skills carry with them into college and even into their future careers. From training to performance opportunities, PBT can make a significant impact on a young dancer’s life.\n\nLast season, PBT was able to offer scholarships to 174 students with demonstrated need. Can our families count on your support so that our students are able to continue exploring their talent this year and for years to come?\n\nDonate Today\n\nAnnouncing the Cast of PBT’s Fireside Nutcracker!\n\nThis year, the magic of PBT’s The Nutcracker is coming to you streaming for the first time ever!

Last month, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre made a small but triumphant return to live performances outside at our Strip District studios, and I had the honor of introducing our company dancers on stage as the new artistic director. What a humbling and emotional experience. One word best describes how I got here – serendipity.\n\nAs some of you may already know, former Artistic Director Terrence S. Orr was a mentor of mine when he was a rehearsal coach at American Ballet Theatre. What you may not know is that his guidance influenced not only the trajectory of my career, but also how I approached performing.\n\nI recall it so well. I was standing backstage before a performance, visibly nervous. Upon noticing, Terrence approached me and asked, “Have you heard what golfers do? They see the hole-in-one before they take the stroke.“\n\nThat wisdom prompted me to learn how to retrain my mind and visualize my performances going well. This idea was life-changing! A positive mindset is crucial, especially during times of challenge and adversity.\n\nMaintaining positivity resonates now more than ever.\n\nThe more I get to know the dancers of PBT and the people who hold them in such high esteem, the easier I can visualize us rising from these challenging times even stronger than before.\n\nAs evident in our recent television broadcast at Hartwood Acres and at our Open Air Series, our dancers are hungry to move their bodies freely again and perform for more intimate audiences this fall. We’re also lucky to have an industrious and talented staff working behind the scenes to deliver the kind of creativity and energy that only arts organizations can provide.\n\nThe key to our success now lies with you, our patrons. I am inspired by your Pittsburgh pride and loyalty to PBT, and I look forward to seeing how our company, school and community partnerships can transform. With your support, the possibilities to keep us dancing are limitless.\n\nWhether it be outside in your neighborhood, at our Strip District campus or at the Benedum Center, I look forward to sharing the beauty of ballet with you this season!\n\nOn behalf of all of us at PBT, we thank you for all you do.\n\nWarmly,\n\nSusan Jaffe\n\nMake a Gift Today\n\nPittsburgh Ballet Theatre Announces Changes to 2020-2021 Fall Season; Alternative Programming\n\nIn response to public health guidance and restrictions on public assembly due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre (PBT) will present an updated 2020-2021 Season, beginning Sept. 10 with a series of outdoor performances at PBT Studios in the Strip District.\n\nPBT’s performances of “Balanchine + Tchaikovsky” and “The Nutcracker” will not take place at the Benedum Center as scheduled. In lieu of traditional theater performances, PBT will offer ticket holders to “Balanchine + Tchaikovsky” a socially distanced, outdoor ballet experience presented PBT’s new mobile performing arts venue at PBT’s Strip District campus. PBT is exploring options to reimagine “The Nutcracker” for audiences in December. Programs scheduled for 2021 remain unchanged.\n\n“While this isn’t the season we had planned, we’re thrilled to be able to connect with our audience outdoors and online,” Artistic Director Susan Jaffe, who took the helm of the company at the height of the pandemic in July, said. “It’s our mission to provide Pittsburgh with extraordinary ballet experiences, and the adaptability and creativity of our company and staff makes that possible, even within the limitations of a COVID-19 world.”\n\nPBT is also exploring options for an additional performance in the fall and more opportunities to make use of the mobile performing arts venue throughout the year.\n\nOpen Air Series & Mobile Performing Arts Venue\n\nOn Sept. 10-14, PBT will launch its Open Air Series at PBT, an outdoor performing arts series at PBT Studios. The parking lot of PBT’s Strip District campus will be converted into a performance space with socially distanced audience seating and performances on PBT’s new Stageline SAM450 mobile performing arts venue.\n\n“Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre is thrilled to move forward with the purchase of the Stageline SAM450 mobile stage with 85 percent of the funds raised,” Executive Director Harris Ferris said, “and we are encouraged by strong interest from additional partners to complete the funding. Major gifts received so far are from the Richard King Mellon Foundation, the Edith L. Trees Charitable Trust and the Jack Buncher Foundation. With the SAM450 capable of mounting full-scale ballet, opera, symphony, and all manner of performing arts productions, it provides a solution in the current pandemic and a window to the future. We are looking toward a future of performing arts that engages people in their own communities, expanding our reach and increasing access to the arts for audiences throughout the region.”\n\nPatrons with tickets to “Balanchine + Tchaikovsky” will be offered the option to use their tickets to attend a mixed-repertory production held for a small, socially distanced audience. These PBT performances will not be open to the broader public, but the ballet intends to use the mobile performing arts venue and the Open Air Series to continue to connect audiences to the performing arts through outdoor events throughout the region.\n\nFor the Open Air Series inaugural performances, safety protocols such as mandatory masks, socially distanced seating, digital playbills and limited access to the PBT building will be enforced during performances.\n\nIn addition to PBT, several other arts organizations in Pittsburgh will host performances during the Open Air Series from Sept. 10-14. Pittsburgh CLO will present solo performances featuring students from the CLO Academy Professional Development Program on Sept. 12. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra will perform a concert of popular classical works performed by ensembles of its musicians on Sept. 13. Also on Sept. 13, Pittsburgh Opera will present a short program that Sunday evening, with details to follow. The August Wilson African American Cultural Center will present live jazz with the Jevon Rushton Group and special guests on Sept. 14. Details about these performances and ticket information will be available soon on each organization’s website.\n\nPBT’s performance will include performances of excerpts from “Coppelia,” “Swan Lake,” “Who Cares?,” “The Sleeping Beauty” and more.\n\n“The Nutcracker” Experience\n\nThe magic of “The Nutcracker” will be transformed in December 2020 when PBT presents a reimagined “Nutcracker” experience. The reimagining, which will include educational programs and special at-home offerings, will be available to existing “Nutcracker” ticket holders and the public. Details about PBT’s “Nutcracker” experience will be announced this fall.\n\nPBT School Reopening\n\nPittsburgh Ballet Theatre School will welcome students back to the studios this fall with in-person, online and hybrid programs. PBT School programming has been entirely virtual since the building closed in March. Beginning in September, after three weeks of remote learning, PBT School students of all levels will have options for in-person, virtual or hybrid programs. Safety protocols, including limited class sizes, enforced social distancing and limited time spent in the building will be part of PBT School’s reopening.\n\nFor more information on PBT School’s fall programs, visit the PBT School webpage here.\n\nTicket Information & FAQ\n\nSubscribers and ticket holders to performances of “Balanchine + Tchaikovsky” and “The Nutcracker” will receive an email from PBT patron services outlining several options for tickets. Patrons with tickets to “Balanchine + Tchaikovsky” will have the opportunity to use their ticket to attend the Open Air Series, request a refund, save their ticket for a future PBT performance or donate the cost of the ticket to PBT.\n\nSubscribers and ticket holders with tickets to “The Nutcracker” will be contacted in the coming weeks with options for their ticket and details about PBT’s reimagined “Nutcracker” experience.\n\nFor frequently asked questions regarding ticket options and subscriptions, please visit PBT’s website.\n\nA Conversation with Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre School Alumna Amy Herchenroether\n\nPittsburgh native Amy Herchenroether began training with Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre School in the late 1990’s in Creative Movement classes, eventually working her way up to the full time high school program. After attending the Boston Ballet School Trainee program for 2 years, she returned to PBT School as a Graduate student before being hired into St. Louis Ballet. Experiences such as performing The Nutcracker onstage with PBT company and training a variety of dance forms in the School helped to prepare her for the repertoire and roles she performed in her professional career.\n\nPBT School caught up with Amy about her experiences as a student at PBT and as a professional at St. Louis Ballet. Listen to the interview below!\n\nWhat I really appreciated about my training at PBT was just how well rounded it is. I think I see that now looking back, even more than when I was a student. You get a really strong classical ballet training, but you’re also exposed to contemporary, jazz and character, plus Pilates, conditioning. Looking back, I think the training is just unbelievable.\n\nCover Photo by Pratt Kreidich Photography"
