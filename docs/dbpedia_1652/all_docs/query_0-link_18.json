He used it again in Atlanta, before a crowd of Georgia legislators and at another fundraiser in Atlantic City, where he spoke from the same stage at which he would later that year accept his party’s nomination for a full term. What exactly it meant, no one could say for sure. It was used too off-handedly, with no speciﬁcs and no explanation. It was little more than a placeholder, “a fragment of rhetorical stufﬁng,” as his speechwriter later called it, a phrase in search of a meaning.1 In that way, it mirrored the new administration. Burdened by the doubt and suspicion of Kennedy supporters both in and out of the White House, Johnson worked to assure them not only that he shared their ideals but that he could make them a legislative reality. In his ﬁrst State of the Union speech in January 1964, he committed himself to Kennedy’s nascent antipoverty and civil rights programs. In February, he signed Kennedy’s longproposed tax cut. It had been, by those measures, an exuberant and accomplished few months. But Johnson could claim only partial credit for those successes. The need to distinguish his presidency from the previous one, to at once fulﬁll Kennedy’s promise and go beyond it, weighed on him heavily. He said as much one day in early April 1964, while skinny-dipping in the White House pool with his speechwriter and a close aide. He asked them to craft a vision of his presidency that would deﬁne a new national purpose and outline a plan to aggressively pursue it. The deadline, he explained, was May 22, when he would address a crowd of about eighty-ﬁve thousand in the University of Michigan football stadium.2\n\n2 / Introduction\n\n1. Newark in the mid-1960s, with key locations, including four of the city’s antipoverty area boards. (Michael Siegel, Rutgers Cartography)\n\nAt Ann Arbor, Johnson relaunched his administration and pulled it out of his predecessor’s shadow with a repurposed phrase, ceasing its casual use and hanging his presidency ﬁrmly on it. After tentatively circling each other for several months, the administration committed itself to “the Great Society,” and “the Great Society” became the inescapable byword of the administration. The vision contained therein and offered to Michigan’s graduating class—and soon to the rest of the nation—was ﬁrmly planted in the historic dilemmas of the moment. Johnson asked Americans what they would do with their hard-won postwar afﬂuence: would they place their\n\nIntroduction / 3\n\nriches in the service of their higher aspirations, or would they allow “unbridled growth” and base commercial desires to trump those ambitions? The Great Society would result if they chose the ﬁrst path, the merely rich and powerful society if the second.3 To get there, though, the nation would have to alleviate the needs of all Americans. In this vision, afﬂuence was widespread but not perfectly distributed. The work of building the Great Society, Johnson suggested, should begin where the need was greatest, where the dire costs of runaway growth were clearest. It would begin, he said, in the cities. By that point, a large literature, growing out of an even longer tradition of writing on the possibilities and pitfalls of metropolitan expansion, had established America’s inner cities as the capitals of economic contradiction, spaces at the center of dynamic regional conurbations that only rarely shared in their wealth. By the time Lyndon Johnson stepped on the stage in Ann Arbor, Detroit’s creeping urban agglomeration on the horizon, there was widespread agreement that we had reached a moment of decision—of crisis—in the cities.4 When the president debuted the Great Society that sunny day in May 1964, he staked the future of his administration on what might become of the cities. But he didn’t stake it on what his administration could accomplish alone. On the contrary, he acknowledged that, while there were numerous federal programs targeting the problems that stood in the way of the Great Society—the following year a congressional committee would count thirteen different federal departments and agencies involved in at least forty different urban development programs—“I do not pretend that we have the full answer to those problems.” But he did promise one thing: “We are going to assemble the best thought and the broadest knowledge from all over the world to ﬁnd those answers for America.” These best minds would generate the experimentation sorely needed in a nation facing the contradictions of postwar prosperity. Because those contradictions were most evident in the cities, the work would start there, on what the president called “the frontier of imagination and innovation.”5 From its outset, then, the Great Society sought to address a problem of knowledge production. Despite its expanded postwar activity and its apparent success in fostering widespread afﬂuence, the federal bureaucracy did not know how to bring that prosperity to the remaining redoubts of poverty. Newer, fresher knowledge would need to be found and brought into the workings of the state. In Ann Arbor, President Johnson called for a “creative federalism,” a new concept of cooperation “between the national capital and the leaders of local communities” to achieve those ends. Most\n\n4 / Introduction\n\nimmediately, he announced the formation of various “working groups” to begin that effort.6\n\nSeated behind President Johnson on the dais in Michigan Stadium, listening to him lay out his plans, Roger Lowenstein turned to a friend and rolled his eyes. He was among those Americans who were very skeptical of the Texan. As student-body president, it was his duty to recommend a commencement speaker to the university president, and he had really wanted John F. Kennedy there that day. But after the assassination, the invitation had passed to Kennedy’s successor.7 Skepticism of the man may have been warranted, but the Great Society was much bigger than the president. Launching it via a set of small ad hoc working groups, Johnson yoked the Great Society to a class of administrative tools that would quickly carry its work well beyond the White House, to a greater pool of knowledge, new ways of thinking, and new political desires. In the search for the new knowledge out of which the Great Society would be built, those administrative structures took hold in speciﬁc places, where they encountered the particularities of local history and politics. Through such encounters, the state would be stretched in new directions, pulled by the innovation and imagination that Johnson called for but whose consequences he could not foresee. Nowhere was this truer than in Roger Lowenstein’s hometown of Newark, New Jersey, where the work of local reformers and activists (Roger’s father among them) had laid groundwork that would make Newark the Great Society’s greatest laboratory, where its imagination would be stretched to its frontier. Newark was no stranger to the midcentury depredations then being gathered under the label “urban crisis.” It lay at the exact center of what Yale researchers in 1955 described as a six-hundred-mile-long urban agglomeration that stretched from Maine to Virginia.8 And it was one of the nation’s most densely populated cities, 438,000 people crammed into its roughly 23.5 square miles, much of that uninhabited marshes, industrial and port areas, and an airport. With that came a host of urban ills now commonly associated with America’s postwar years: an aging housing stock and subsequent slum clearance projects, employment competition in the midst of a dwindling job base, and the growing racial segregation of the inner city.9 Residents were not quiescent in the face of such challenges, and they recognized, as President Johnson would more than a decade later, that the very administrative form of government helped shape the possible re-\n\nIntroduction / 5\n\nsponses to them. In the mid-1950s, they took advantage of a new state law providing residents the tools to reform their local government. In signing the legislation in 1950, Governor Alfred Driscoll had celebrated the way it kept “government as close to the people as possible.”10 In Newark, where the existing municipal charter had produced a city hall bogged down in patronage and corruption, reformers sought a modernized government, one that would be more responsive to the urban challenges of the moment and to the city’s changing population. They believed that administration mattered, that the form government took and the way it interacted with its people were important factors in determining its ability to address postwar ills. And after Newark voters approved a referendum establishing a municipal charter reform commission, Alan Lowenstein—Roger’s father and fellow Wolverine—was chosen as its chairman. Many of Newark’s midcentury administrative thinkers were exceptionally attuned to the racial implications of their work, especially as the city’s black population grew and spread. Since around World War I and the ﬁrst mass wave of migration, Newark’s black community had been concentrated in the Third Ward, in roughly the geographic center of the city. Yet that geographic density, under the existing municipal charter, did not translate into political representation. So proponents of reform successfully pushed for a\n\n2. Over the course of the 1950s, Newark’s black population spread outward from the Central Ward. The consciousness of an imminent black majority would powerfully shape local politics in the 1960s. (Michael Siegel, Rutgers Cartography)\n\n6 / Introduction\n\nredrawing of voting-ward boundaries to ensure, for the ﬁrst time, political representation for residents of the expanding black ghetto. Among the beneﬁts of this upturn in black political opportunity was the election of the city’s ﬁrst black councilman in 1954. Another was an intensifying attention to race relations in city hall. In a landmark 1959 report, the Mayor’s Commission on Group Relations revealed that, should current demographic trends continue, Newark would soon be a majority-black city.11 That year, the impending demographic shift was front-page and national news.12 Four years later, the New York Times reported that Newark had “the largest proportional Negro population of any major metropolitan center north of the Mason-Dixon line.”13 In 1965, one new arrival, a native of Richmond, passed through downtown and thought that the only other place he’d seen so many black people was Nairobi.14 Though municipal charter reform brought new opportunities for black political power, local outposts of the black freedom struggle continued to battle racial discrimination in both the public and private sectors. And as the consciousness of a black majority grew on either side of Newark’s color line, movements to pry open the institutional structures of local government and admit the voices and knowledge of that population accelerated, while movements to secure those structures against such incursions attempted to keep pace. Parties to this struggle sought assistance wherever they could. When the Great Society’s administrative structures snaked their way out beyond the capital, Newarkers grabbed hold and bent them to their own desires.\n\nThe urban crisis—variously conﬁgured as uncontrolled metropolitan expansion, human migrations, the ﬁnancial and demographic depletion of inner cities, and the political and physical conﬂicts engendered in particular places by those broad social phenomena—is often traced to the apparent contradictions of postwar American liberalism: how, despite its commitments to integration and widespread economic security, liberalism had produced segregated cities and decimated their economies. Newark appeared the most profound symbol of that failing, an impoverished, deeply divided city where liberalism’s promise had gone up in ﬂames during the summer of 1967.15 But that’s not the end of the story. In the face of those contradictions— made abundantly clear by the black freedom struggle and the “discovery” of poverty amid postwar plenty—Great Society liberalism fostered a critique of the modern liberal state that looked beyond the politics of eco-\n\nIntroduction / 7\n\nnomic growth and entertained the anxieties growth had produced. While a range of social critics denounced the conventionality and shortsightedness of postwar afﬂuence, Great Society liberalism acknowledged that the state itself had grown similarly staid and inadequate to the challenges of the period. Insisting that the state, in order to address its contradictions, look outside itself for ideas, it cultivated an antibureaucratic and communityoriented ethic that valued experimentation, ﬂexibility, and decenteredness. It sought the guidance of elite experts, to be sure, but it also sought out the knowledge and desires of “the other America,” those communities left behind by growth politics. And voices emanating from that “community” would prove the most consequential, as a growing body of work on the Great Society has begun to appreciate.16 Much of the drama in this story is produced by the fact that “the community,” so broadly rendered in much discourse of the day (community action, community participation, community development, community control), was necessarily and, to an extent, knowingly illegible to the state that was calling it into duty.17 That, after all, was the idea: the administration wanted innovation, new ideas, new imaginations. It didn’t have the answers and didn’t know what would come of attempts to ﬁnd them. Opening up the state to a broad, abstract “community,” illegible, full of difference, and, especially in the years of the modern black freedom struggle, dissenting and protestant, was an invitation to conﬂict. That opening in Newark—a city keyed to its imminent black majority, whether out of desire or fear—became liberalism’s leading edge. More speciﬁcally, the drama here is often generated by encounters between ofﬁcial state agents and those communities whose knowledge would be the new stuff of governing. The medium for such encounters was a profusion of decentered administrative forms that reached out beyond the halls of federal power: the ad hoc task forces and working groups that sought new ways of looking at the problems of the postwar years, for example; grant programs that encouraged unique, locally appropriate approaches to locally deﬁned problems; and investigative commissions that constructed knowledge out of an often intractable range of sources. These forms were not entirely new, but they were newly popular. They had exploded in the postwar years, out of a desire to balance new demands on the state with American democratic traditions, to face, in other words, the challenges of the times without succumbing to totalitarianism.18 Theirs was a model of government well suited to the ironic social style of postwar liberalism rather than its bureaucratic tendencies, to the desire for experimentation rather than purer, unpolluted forms of statism.19 They grew in\n\n8 / Introduction\n\nsheer numbers during the Johnson years, and more and more of the work of government was accomplished through them.20 When such administrative forms arrived in Newark, they provided unprecedented resources, opportunities, and allies to those engaged with its urban crisis and the particular political struggles it engendered. The speciﬁc forms that play central roles here—the War on Poverty’s Community Action Program (CAP), the executive commissions that investigated Newark’s civil disorder, and various congressional hearings on the War on Poverty and violence—gave local activists new operational spaces and new pathways by which they could inject their voices into both local and national politics. For the most part, this was to the beneﬁt of those seeking greater power for Newark’s black majority. But one of the ironies of this story is that the community action ethic, as I will call it, and the administrative forms that embodied it also contained opportunities for Newarkers more interested in maintaining the prevailing political order, opportunities most manifest in the politics of local law enforcement. In addition to the ethic and the administrative structures of the Great Society, then, were the people who populated them and gave them speciﬁc meanings and purposes. Newarkers were uncommonly prepared for the Great Society, whether they had an appreciation for the importance of administrative form because they had participated in the recent municipal charter change; because they were concerned about the ills plaguing their city and convinced that local government was impotent or too incompetent to deal with them; because their racial consciousness had reached new heights with the news of the impending black majority and believed the time had come for that majority to exercise its full political power; because they felt threatened by the shifting demographics and sought to secure whatever power they had; or because of some combination of these factors. These were the people—from black power militants to the most conservative upholders of “law and order,” and the many, many Newarkers in between—who sought and used the opportunities and resources afforded by Great Society liberalism.21 With that access, they struggled against the fallout of the larger social forces that liberalism had, at best, left unaddressed and, at worst, fostered. Ultimately, the conﬂicts produced by those struggles rendered the experiment unsustainable. The postwar liberal state and its guardians, it turned out, did not have sufﬁcient stores of the improvisatory and pragmatic qualities needed to deal with such an inﬂux of “community.” The Great Society’s earliest and most vociferous critics, Daniel Patrick Moynihan most prominent among them, decried the local conﬂicts generated\n\nIntroduction / 9\n\nby the Community Action Program. But many others, especially the local people who made use of it, believed protest and conﬂict were eminently reasonable uses of federal resources and institutional and political change its most desirable outcome.22 The Great Society thus proved a brief attempt to rebalance the relationship between the state and “the community,” when it became apparent that the former, despite postwar growth, had not done well by the latter. It linked modern American liberalism’s commitment to state action and the unprecedented spending permitted by postwar afﬂuence to calls for political empowerment and economic citizenship from some of the nation’s most marginalized peoples, whether in the hollows of Appalachia, the reservations of the Great Plains, or the declining cities of the Rust Belt. The agents of that linkage were the decentered administrative structures that spread out from Washington to those places and residents who took hold of them and, in stretching them toward participatory democracy, brought postwar liberalism to its frontier.\n\nThe story here plays out on either side of Newark’s “riots.” One of the reasons those ﬁve days in July 1967 have resonated so deeply is that they contained, as some observers quickly recognized, two phases of violence: the initial black rebellion and the state suppression thereof. I ﬁnd “riots” a useful term worth preserving—though I use it carefully and not exclusively— for several reasons. First, it has the capacity to include both the insurrectionary and reactionary forms of violence. Second, for me it invokes a scholarly tradition that, far from seeing mass violence as politically unmotivated, insists exactly the opposite.23 Finally, and most important, those ﬁve days appear in this book more as narrative than as fact, though fact the violence and its awful toll surely were. In the years afterward—even to today—the riots were used as a particularly powerful political and cultural bludgeon, an immediately usable past that was enlisted in much longer racial-political struggles of which it was surely a part, but not the whole. It’s that use of the violence that I want to emphasize by calling it a “riot.” Though there are glimpses of events from earlier in the century, the story proper begins in the early 1960s, as community action began to take shape amid small task force and executive committee meetings in the Kennedy administration and came to full legislative fruition under Lyndon Johnson. It then moves quickly to Newark, one of the ﬁrst cities to ﬁle a grant application under the new Community Action Program and arguably the city in which it most quickly reached the heights of national controversy. In\n\n10 / Introduction\n\nNewark, community action encountered, changed, and was changed by the existing struggles for and against greater black political power, with which it became intimately intertwined. But it also came to town in other forms, including a greater attention among some municipal and police leaders to the relationship between the city’s police department and what had taken shape as “the community,” a byword that had come to stand in for the coming black majority. That relationship, though never generally warm, had recently taken a turn for the worse, through a series of events that lent more cohesion not only to “the community” but to a nascent alliance between the police department and many white Newarkers facing the reality of their shrinking numbers and looking to the department as their last municipal stronghold. They forged their own brand of community action, a warping of the black community’s version, as if in a funhouse mirror. The riots that occurred in and grew out of this context provided ammunition for all sides in these struggles. But ﬁrst, their chaos and death and destruction had to be given some order. They had to be made to yield some useful meaning. The problem of doing this is seen most clearly in two investigative commissions established to do just that: to make the violence make sense. The challenge for the liberal government-sponsored commissions considered here was that, if they were to be taken seriously and their investigation and conclusions and recommendations were to have any legitimacy, they would have to hew closely to the ethic of community action. That is, they would have to make sure that they considered a wide array of knowledge and perspectives. This was not only immensely difﬁcult but, in the case of one commission, almost fatal. For the emerging politics of law and order, this was a problem to be avoided by appearing to take it seriously. When the state Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association launched its own investigation and responded harshly to the others, it wore a cloak of commissionness but refused a commitment to community action and, therefore, its epistemological pitfalls. Its report was the most conﬁdent yet, and it arrived just as more and more Americans—white Americans especially—were becoming more and more convinced that the politics of community action, as it had played out in Newark especially, had led only to mass disorder and violence. The response was a growing willingness to give law enforcement agencies what they wanted in order to guard the social order, a dialing back of the concern with police-community relations, and an expanded sense of solidarity with the police, as more and more civilians took to the streets in defense of their neighborhoods and what they considered the American way of life. For two public intellectuals of national stature in the late 1960s, the\n\nIntroduction / 11\n\nNewark riots demonstrated not the dangers of community action but its essential impotence. The state needed neither to be defended nor opened up but to be the target of a revolution. Soon after the violence ended, Tom Hayden, whose articulations of participatory democracy had brought him to Newark and its Community Action Program, left the city to work full-time in the antiwar movement, where he would increasingly dabble in the politics of guerilla violence, convinced that the American rot was so complete that the system might need to be burned down rather than made more accessible. For Nathan Wright Jr., the black Episcopal priest and former Freedom Rider who chaired the organizing committee for the ﬁrst National Conference on Black Power in Newark, American liberalism could never countenance true black power. So the state needed to be remade in what he called a politics of black self-empowerment, which would ultimately merge with the rising New Right and its romance with market, rather than participatory, democracy. While Hayden and Wright left Newark before the close of the decade, their faith in the possibilities of the Great Society shattered, the struggle to pull and stretch its mechanisms toward local desires and goals continued apace. If nothing else, the riots had demonstrated the great inability of the local power structure to maintain order and, once order had been lost, to deal with the situation in a humane way. Among veterans of the city’s community action struggles, the goal shifted from opening up that structure to taking it over. The politics of participation yielded to a politics of control, with consequences that continue to shape Newark today.\n\nPA R T O N E\n\nThe Rise of Community Action\n\nONE\n\nThe Construction of Community Action in the Great Society\n\nWhat sparked President John F.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, several public intellectuals and journalists—chief among them John Kenneth Galbraith, Leon Keyserling, Michael Harrington, Harry Caudill, and Homer Bigart— rediscovered American poverty and hauled its ugly visage before the American public.1 Poverty had largely been a partisan Democratic issue—Senator Paul Douglass of Illinois, for example, had repeatedly led the charge for area redevelopment legislation in the 1950s—and Kennedy had made poverty and unemployment a signiﬁcant theme during his West Virginia primary campaign. But the broader message of the campaign, the one he deployed regardless of where he stumped, was that the Republican Party had done very little to foster national economic growth. Once in ofﬁce, then, his number one domestic priority was to pass a tax cut and get more capital circulating, a Keynesian ploy promoted most stridently by the head of his Council of Economic Advisors, Walter Heller. Once the tax cut was passed, Kennedy turned to Heller in late 1962 and asked him to investigate the claims about which he had been reading: that postwar conventional wisdom (as Galbraith called it) was beset by gaping holes in our national self-perception, that the golden age of American afﬂuence was in fact run through with stubborn strands of poverty.2 Though Kennedy maintained a public optimism that, as he would put it almost a year later, “a rising tide would lift all boats,” Heller and other presidential staffers furiously searched for ideas well into the fall of 1963.3 They established a process that now appears, looking back, a good model of what was to become the Great Society’s attention to community action. Their search began in the established halls of power, collecting ideas\n\n16 / Chapter One\n\nfrom the old-line federal departments, but soon reached out beyond them, pulling new actors and new ideas into the process. Eventually, that process spiraled out beyond bureaucratic places and ways of knowing and incorporated ideas from academia, private foundations, and, crucially, local communities of impoverished Americans and brought those ideas back into the administration. In the end, the process itself proved the answer to Kennedy’s question about how to deal with the contradictions of growth liberalism. If the solution could not be found in the tide and the state actions that lifted it, maybe the administration had to look beyond the state. The story of how this was done, then, begins with the president, but it soon leaves him behind to follow the administrative routes by which new ideas about how to confront poverty were found and brought into the workings of the state.4\n\nDuring the summer of 1963, the Council of Economic Advisors convened an informal working group of staff from several cabinet departments and executive agencies to consider the problem of poverty, which was, Walter Heller came to believe, even more widespread and intractable than ﬁrst anticipated. They met every few weeks on Saturdays and discussed both broad diagnostic issues (how is poverty deﬁned? how is it measured?) and speciﬁc program proposals. They spoke not only of economics but of politics and race. The results were discouraging. The existing bureaucracy, it turned out, had little imagination. Many of the proposals involved little more than money for existing programs. None conjured as comprehensive and experimental an approach as the problem of poverty demanded. “It was quickly clear,” one council staffer later recalled, “that we were getting old categorical program ideas warmed over.”5 Heller extended the council’s search into the fall of 1963 and, with Kennedy’s blessing, established a formal task force on poverty. The president’s closest advisors were canvassing for program ideas that would take them into the 1964 campaign season, and Heller was determined that a broad antipoverty effort be on their list. The task force issued a formal call for proposals, but the results were no better than the summer’s products. “I got back, predictably, garbage,” the head of the task force said. “People went into their ﬁle drawers and pulled out old programs that they had been ﬂoating around or that they had been trying to ﬂoat before.” There were lots of bits and pieces but no overarching theme. Even worse, several departments began to resent this new, annoyingly picky task force and to assert their deeply rooted bureaucratic interests. The Department of Labor\n\nThe Construction of Community Action in the Great Society / 17\n\ninsisted on a jobs program, while the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare advocated programs in the ﬁelds of health, education, and welfare.6 The youthful energy and idealism of Kennedy’s closest advisors had been slowed by the tangled bureaucratic morass of the mainline federal agencies. Those in the Bureau of the Budget were particularly disgusted. In the 1930s, Congress had moved the bureau from the Treasury Department to the newly created Executive Ofﬁce of the President. With the bureau nearby, proponents of the move argued, the administrator in chief would be free of contending bureaucratic interests and would have direct access to the best organization and management research available. It was practically designed to rufﬂe bureaucratic feathers, and the bureau quickly garnered a reputation as a hotbed of administrative experimentation.7 When he interviewed for the job with the president-elect, Kennedy’s eventual budget director insisted that the bureau was meant to be the strongest arm of the executive with oversight of all other departments and agencies. Under him, he promised, the bureau would be particularly active.8 It was a bureau staffer, then, who ﬁnally led the task force through the federal bureaucratic tangle and its unoriginal proposals. He knew David Hackett, who had recently led the President’s Committee on Juvenile Delinquency. “I knew Hackett and his crew were around and I thought they had some fresh ideas,” the bureau staffer recalled. “At least they weren’t the ideas coming in from the line agencies.” In early November 1963, he asked Hackett to submit a memo outlining his ideas for the administration’s proposed antipoverty program.9\n\nDavid Hackett was in his sophomore year at the Milton Academy in Massachusetts when Robert Kennedy entered the class one year ahead of him. Hackett considered himself something of a misﬁt at the school, more interested in hitting the athletic ﬁelds than the books. When John Knowles, who attended Milton rival Philips Exeter, later wrote his novel A Separate Peace, he modeled the character Phineas, who “considered authority the necessary evil against which happiness was achieved by reaction,” on Hackett.10 He immediately befriended Kennedy, whom he regarded as a fellow oddball. And when, in the late 1950s, Bobby’s older brother ran for president, Hackett worked on the nomination and then the general election campaign. He later commended the campaign’s youth and ingenuity: while Senator Lyndon Johnson built his support by rallying his fellow senators, Hackett said, the Kennedy campaign built support state by state\n\n18 / Chapter One\n\nand from the ground up. “It proved perhaps the single most interesting thing,” he said, “that this group, in effect, was smarter and had better political instincts” than its much older and more experienced competitors. They developed a different system and they won. When President-elect Kennedy named his younger brother attorney general, Hackett agreed to join the Department of Justice as his special assistant.11 Before the inauguration, Robert Kennedy asked Hackett to begin studying up on juvenile delinquency. The problem had sparked a national moral panic in the 1950s, and that may have been enough to attract the attention of the soon-to-be attorney general. But Kennedy also knew of the problem from his older sister Eunice, who in the late 1940s, after their father funded the establishment of a delinquency bureau in the Justice Department, became the department’s ﬁrst executive secretary for juvenile delinquency. Then, in the early 1950s, Eunice—who was sometimes called “the conscience of the Kennedy family”—had gone to work at the Federal Penitentiary for Women in Alderson, West Virginia, where she encountered and befriended some of the nation’s most notorious criminals, including Tokyo Rose and the queen of Washington, DC’s, numbers game.12 Eunice’s younger brother and his old prep-school friend had comparatively little experience with America’s down-and-out, but they were eager to get some. “I think that he and I were quite similar in that we’d never been involved with close poverty before,” Hackett later said, “and certainly never had been involved up-close with Negroes.” In the early months of their work on delinquency and over the next year or so, they traveled around the country to see American poverty ﬁrsthand. The experience was eye-opening. They visited poor white mountaineers in Appalachia, Chicanos in East Los Angeles, and black Angelenos in Watts. Kennedy visited schools, playgrounds, and swimming pools in neighborhoods surrounding the capitol building in Washington.13 The new attorney general hoped to keep these trips out of the public spotlight, but the press caught up with him in New York in March 1961. He and Hackett took a walk up Manhattan’s East Side. The tour had been arranged by a contact at the New York Youth Board, who arranged several meetings between the nation’s chief law enforcement ofﬁcer and members of the Puerto Rican Viceroys and the Italian Redwings, some of them drug addicts and robbery suspects. Kennedy took off his coat and rolled up his sleeves. When he asked the gang members about the problems they faced, some spoke about the lack of jobs and places to play. Others were more reluctant to engage the suspicious tousle-haired white guy with the Brahmin accent. “What do you want to know for?” they demanded. “What are you\n\nThe Construction of Community Action in the Great Society / 19\n\ndoing here?” Kennedy responded simply—“I’m interested, I’m the Attorney General”—and they spent over two hours talking.14 Whatever the source of Kennedy’s interest in juvenile delinquency, it was only that: an interest. There was no method yet, no ideas for how to address the problem. Hackett had been given no speciﬁc instructions, so he spent about six months traveling and talking to people, asking everyone he met what they would do if given $30 million to solve the problem of juvenile delinquency. First, he hit up federal agencies, including colleagues in the Justice Department, the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons, and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. He later estimated that he found about ten people working on youth and youth programs in the entire federal government, “and what was very striking was the lack of coordination” between any of them. “That was true even within the Justice Department,” he said, where “the Bureau of Prisons never talked to the FBI and vice versa.” Hackett recommended, therefore, that the administration establish a new cabinet-level committee to address the problem, a body that would coordinate federal efforts rather than leave them scattered in the established departments.15 While casting about for ideas, Hackett asked the head of youth affairs at the Ford Foundation if he knew anyone who could get a juvenile delinquency program up and running. The ofﬁcial turned to a recent foundation hire named Richard Boone, and Richard Boone suggested Lloyd Ohlin. Hackett had heard the name before, and on a subsequent visit to New York City he met Boone in a bar to learn more.16 Boone had ﬁrst met Ohlin in the 1950s at the University of Chicago, where Boone had worked on a project tracking felons who were released into the Illinois Selective Service. Upon leaving the university, he worked at the Illinois State Reformatory during the Adlai Stevenson administration, and when one of his Chicago faculty members became the sheriff of Cook County, Boone became a captain in the county juvenile bureau. While there, he served as a consultant to the Chicago YMCA’s “detached worker” program, which recruited community residents to work closely with gang members. Boone quickly came to believe that social welfare professionals—especially psychiatric caseworkers—were frauds with little ability to help delinquents. In seeking alternative personnel for the program, he experimented with hiring the gang members themselves. They rose to the task, Boone found, with impressive results, and he decided to toss the professional caseworkers out of the program altogether. Since the predominant approach toward delinquency was at that point psychiatric, the program’s initial funding had come from the National Institute of\n\n20 / Chapter One\n\nMental Health. But after his successful experiment with hiring gang members, Boone poured his new ideas into a funding application that he sent to the Ford Foundation.17 While working on the detached worker program, Boone frequently sought Lloyd Ohlin’s advice. Ohlin and his Columbia University colleague Richard Cloward had devised a theory that turned conventional thinking about delinquency on its head. They argued that delinquency was the product of a systemic rather than personal pathology and that delinquents, rather than pursuing lives of crime, would take advantage of better (and legal) opportunities if their communities provided them. The individual delinquent, therefore, was not a deviant who needed to adjust (or be adjusted) to the system. Rather, the system was dysfunctional and had to be reformed. Furthermore, rather than unilaterally swooping down with some social science derring-do to rescue the denizens of impoverished neighborhoods, Ohlin and Cloward insisted that residents themselves participate in that reformation.18 Ohlin’s ideas received their ﬁrst real tryout on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, in a multiracial neighborhood marked by high unemployment rates and increasing youth crime. In 1958, after a local businessman offered the neighborhood’s Henry Street Settlement seed money to begin planning a delinquency program, the esteemed and long-standing social service agency submitted a grant application to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for a project they called Mobilization for Youth (MFY). The plan was to mobilize existing agencies and saturate the area with social services. But the NIMH rejected this initial proposal and insisted that the project engage more with community organizing (rather than organizing among the local social-service agencies), with local institutions like the schools, and with current social science research.19 That is where Ohlin and Cloward came in. The application of their research fulﬁlled the NIMH’s demand for a more modern and scholarly approach. Together, they advocated the organizing of residents to advocate on their own behalf, not by incorporating them into existing power structures—which, after all, did not seem to be doing much for them— but by challenging them directly. While reworking MFY’s funding application, Ohlin went to see Saul Alinsky and came away “enormously impressed” with the veteran organizer’s vision of social conﬂict. But because he thought MFY’s reliance on federal funds made it unwise to foster such conﬂict, Ohlin insisted the project pursue a middle course between conﬂict and cooptation: community participation.20 When the NIMH approved the revised grant in 1959, the contrast be-\n\nThe Construction of Community Action in the Great Society / 21\n\ntween the social-service and community-organizing approaches had not been completely worked out in some people’s mind, so the two simply existed side by side. The president of the Henry Street Settlement told the New York Times, for example, that the project would “emphasize all-out community organization” but that efforts would also be made “to strengthen many of the services now being carried on in the lower East Side community.” Other project leaders took care not to perturb existing neighborhood agencies, so they emphasized that MFY would not replace but only supplement them.21 Nonetheless, MFY generated anxiety and tension among existing social service agencies. A local Catholic priest wondered if his mission’s explicitly religious approach to local delinquents—“we tell them frankly that we’re interested in their souls”—would clash with MFY’s more secular aims. On the other hand, he also wondered if the project’s “service saturation” approach wasn’t really just a stopgap. “Maybe we should think in terms of a genuine people’s movement in the area,” he suggested. “A parish cannot successfully operate in a neighborhood like this until its power structure can challenge the other existing power structures—the real estate operators, the housing authority, the police.” Perhaps that was the answer to the neighborhood’s problems, he concluded, “rather than the manipulation of people by professional social workers.”22 Hackett later described Ohlin, who was brought onto the newly formed President’s Committee on Juvenile Delinquency (PCJD), as “the key architect of both the bill and the philosophy behind the program.”23 The committee’s proposed legislation authorizing the distribution of funds for demonstration projects combating delinquency passed Congress in September 1961. Mobilization for Youth was among the ﬁrst organizations to win a grant the following spring. It proposed a range of antidelinquency work in its effort to transform the local opportunity structure on the Lower East Side: neighborhood service centers, a Boys Adventure Corps, a preschool program, Homework Helpers, and youth cultural centers housed in local coffee shops. But tucked among such proposals was a participatory element that elevated the program beyond the original plan to saturate the area with social services: a “community development program which will seek to organize the unafﬁliated to take a greater part in civic affairs.”24\n\nSoon after MFY received the bundle of grants that would make it perhaps the most studied and inﬂuential demonstration project of the decade, the Kennedy administration began work on another idea: a domestic version of its popular Peace Corps. (Once again, it might have been Eunice who\n\n22 / Chapter One\n\nplanted the seed.) The idea was soon swept up in the stream of New Frontier thinking: it suggested that current service structures were inadequate to the tasks at hand and asked young Americans to selﬂessly consider what they might do for their country. The president kicked it over to Bobby who, in turn, gave it to David Hackett.25 Hackett had recently asked Richard Boone to leave the Ford Foundation, where Boone had been a busy advocate for Mobilization for Youth, and join the PCJD. But within a month of settling in at the Department of Justice, Boone was asked to develop a program for the proposed domestic peace corps.26 By November 1962, Boone and other Justice staffers had prepared a preliminary report for the president. They recommended providing “visible avenues for service” to Americans wishing to serve their country. The program would be relatively small, about two to ﬁve thousand volunteers. They imagined volunteers working in schools, mental hospitals, slum neighborhoods, prisons, migrant-labor camps, and Indian reservations. And, importantly, they suggested that any projects serviced by the volunteers be initiated by local communities and institutions rather than the federal government, just as in the Peace Corps. It was a way, in effect, to help those communities help themselves.27 In the middle of November, the president announced the formation of a cabinet-level task force to determine the need for and the viability of such a program. Bobby Kennedy would head the task force, and he, in turn, made Richard Boone a Justice Department representative on it. Boone had been trying to sell the Committee on Juvenile Delinquency on the participation of the poor in local decision making (one PCJD member who later interviewed Boone for a study on the committee wrote in his notes, “Boone becomes a Mau Mau on this issue”), but he redoubled his efforts as a member of the Task Force on the National Service Corps.28 When the Council of the Southern Mountains, a community development organization headquartered at Berea College in Kentucky, expressed interest in having young volunteers come to Appalachia, Boone warmly greeted their proposal and later visited the area. The following year, when the council began organizing an emergency winter program to help mountaineers cope with colder temperatures, Boone and a local community development expert argued that the mountain residents themselves should be involved not only as receivers of aid but as dispensers of it. “A program based on the traditional concept of charity—giving aid to enable subsistence, but without requiring a commitment by those receiving the aid—will not be complete,” they wrote. “And aid based on the concept of charity tends to drive the poor more deeply into dependency.” They wanted the federal program to leave a legacy in\n\nThe Construction of Community Action in the Great Society / 23\n\nAppalachia in the form of a citizenry more active in the work of their communities, especially after federal assistance inevitably disappeared.29 In addition to the mountains of Appalachia, whose dire conditions were documented in inﬂuential writings by Harry Caudill and Homer Bigart in 1962 and 1963, task force staffers visited migrant-labor camps, inner-city neighborhoods, and Indian reservations, and representatives from these areas sometimes visited Washington to speak to the task force. Boone later said that a common theme ran through their testimony: “Very, very early in the game, they began to hit us, saying, ‘For God’s sake, quit planning for us. If you really want us involved, then don’t play games with us.’”30 One time, when Bobby Kennedy called representatives from all executive departments to a Saturday-morning meeting, among the representatives of the poor was a group of Native American leaders who, in addition to advocating for local program development, blasted the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. One in particular made an impassioned speech against the bureaucratic paternalism under which his people had been forced to live, then turned to the attorney general and pointedly asked him what he was going to do about it. Boone felt that this was a turning point for Bobby Kennedy (already primed, no doubt, by his visits to Appalachia, Harlem, and other poor areas), who then became the administration’s highest-ranking advocate for opening up federal antipoverty programs to participation from the poor communities they served.31 The Bureau of Indian Affairs might have been the most egregious example of federal bureaucratic insensitivity— “probably the most ingrown and destructive bureaucratic enclave in the federal establishment,” Boone once called it—but it was only one entryway into a much larger world of bureaucratic tyranny and inefﬁciency, a world that new ideas about community action would seek to pry open.32\n\nOver the several years he worked on the delinquency and domestic service corps programs, Hackett had pulled together a close circle of like-minded administrators who met regularly in his ofﬁce. He called them his “guerillas” for the bureaucratic insurrection they were waging, several of them forming a sort of ﬁfth column in established federal agencies and departments.33 One of the insurgents—an accomplished social worker whose dissertation on the welfare power structure had concluded that greater political involvement by welfare recipients was needed—felt that delinquency staffers had been encouraged to feel as though they were different from the stuffy and tired federal bureaucrats among whom they worked and whose laziness became a running joke.34\n\n24 / Chapter One\n\nAt one of the meetings of the guerillas, someone pointed out that they were talking about a lot more than delinquency—that they were, in fact, discussing a broad antipoverty program.35 So when in the fall of 1963— after Kennedy had done some disturbing reading, after the tax cut had passed, and after the Council of Economic Advisors had given up on ﬁnding innovative ideas among existing departments—Hackett heard from his friend at the Bureau of the Budget that the administration was casting about for new ideas on how to ﬁght poverty, he campaigned hard for those generated by his close circle of bureaucratic insurgents.36 The idea of community action, in all its antibureaucratic bravado, caught the attention of the White House in ways that proposals from the old-line departments and agencies had not. It suited the administration’s penchant for experimentation, its calls for service, and its suspicion of the federal bureaucracy, which the president once reportedly compared to an intractable whale: he tried to grasp it but could never get a ﬁrm hold for all the blubber.37 One senior staffer from the Council of Economic Advisors recalled the heavy inﬂuence Hackett and Boone had on the council’s thinking. In their search for ideas, he said, “We were bewildered by the complete disarray of the nominal professionals in the ﬁeld of poverty.” They had become convinced that giving money to existing agencies “was not worth a damn.” When he met with Hackett and Boone, he said, “I was always sort of swept off my feet.” And when Walter Heller himself met with them, he came out of the conversation buzzing about their ideas. Later, after being pulled aside by Robert Kennedy, who “made some very encouraging noises” about community action, his course was set.38 By the time Heller, frustrated by the warmed-over conventional wisdom of the federal antipoverty bureaucracy, encountered David Hackett and learned about the work of the executive committees considering juvenile delinquency and a domestic peace corps, the thinking on poverty within those committees had been shaped by numerous encounters between key administration liberals and representatives of the poor: Richard Boone and Chicago gang members, Appalachian mountaineers, and the Native Americans he brought to Washington; Robert Kennedy and the Viceroys and Redwings he met on Manhattan’s East Side; the various other people Kennedy and Hackett visited, including their ﬁrst encounters “up-close with Negroes.” The parties to these encounters traveled along the administrative routes—the interagency committees and task forces—established by the need to open the bureaucratic state to fresh ideas. Federal antipoverty policy began to emerge as community action not only because those routes connected Washington with social scientiﬁc theories about delinquency\n\nThe Construction of Community Action in the Great Society / 25\n\nand community development (both domestic and international) but also because they extended deep into the other America.39 The task force experience taught those liberals that local knowledge among the poor and alienated had value. What may have begun as patrician senses of noblesse oblige were soon taken out beyond the personal and made structural. Administrative structures then carried the ethic of community action out into the world, energized it with material resources, and produced unpredictable outcomes. In that process, liberalism was stretched beyond its bureaucratic and paternalistic tendencies toward something more radical.\n\nOn the day President Kennedy was assassinated, administration stalwarts found a sticking place for their emerging antipoverty ideas. The interagency task force that had turned up Hackett and Boone and their ideas of community action prepared a statement on the proposed program, and Walter Heller brought it to a meeting with the new president the next day.40 Heller took detailed notes on their conversation. He told Johnson that, though the program hadn’t taken clear shape yet, it had already garnered a lot of support within the administration. The president, Heller wrote, “said we should push ahead full-tilt on this project.”41 At the beginning of December, Hackett prepared a memo outlining the community action idea. According to Boone, Hackett saw the coming poverty program as a way to fund all the projects that the PCJD could not and to broaden the committee’s work beyond the speciﬁcs of delinquency to larger structures of poverty.42 In the December memo, the central values and lessons developed in the crucibles of the PCJD and National Service Corps experiences, among a host of social scientists, federal bureaucrats, and poor Americans, were pithily stated. There were three main points: (1) because the problem of poverty was structural and comprehensive, so too must be the approach to ﬁghting it; (2) this required a shaking up of current bureaucratic structures at both the federal and local levels; and (3) the poor themselves, as a source of competent knowledge concerning their own situation, had to participate in the creation of any program. The way to give these ideas structure, Hackett suggested, would be to create a series of task forces that would study local situations in consultation with the local poor and make legislative recommendations.43 Though the proposed series of task forces never materialized, President Johnson did establish a single antipoverty task force shortly after declaring, in his ﬁrst State of the Union message in January 1964, an “unconditional war on poverty.” He asked Peace Corps director Sargent Shriver to lead the effort.\n\n26 / Chapter One\n\nAt the end of January, Walter Heller briefed Shriver and his deputy director, Adam Yarmolinsky, on the notion of community action. During a bathroom break, Shriver and Yarmolinsky exchanged their ﬁrst impressions of the proposed antipoverty effort. Neither was terribly impressed, and they agreed that the program’s political prospects were not promising. Community action contained too few fruits for those within the administration who would need to sign off on it. They needed a more diverse package of elements, they thought, if the War on Poverty had any chance of getting off the ground. So Shriver and Yarmolinsky quickly invited a large number of other administrators to attend the task force’s ﬁrst formal meeting, held a couple of days later.44 Participants included representatives of the PCJD, Labor, and the Bureau of the Budget. Shriver told them that community action could be included in whatever legislative package they proposed, but it couldn’t be the whole War on Poverty.45 Nonetheless, the architects of community action pushed their case. Richard Boone repeatedly insisted on the participation of the poor in the planning and implementation of local poverty programs. And when Shriver once remarked that Boone had already made his point, Boone responded by saying he would keep bringing it up until it was included in the task force’s proposed program. There was some discussion of the extent to which the poor could be involved, and the group eventually agreed on a linguistic compromise offered by Boone: the legislation would call for their “maximum feasible participation.” The phrase was included in the very ﬁrst draft of the legislation, written just after the task force’s ﬁrst meeting, and it survived all subsequent revisions.46 The antibureaucratic thrust of community action had rufﬂed feathers in the old-line executive departments since the earliest days of Kennedy’s PCJD, and those tensions erupted once again in Johnson’s antipoverty task force. The speciﬁc battle was over whether community action or jobs would take center stage in the legislation. On one side of the battle line stood the veterans of the PCJD (especially Boone, Hackett, and RFK), and on the other were those who wanted community action either decentered (Shriver) or gutted in favor of employment programs (Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz and his representative on the task force, Daniel Patrick Moynihan). The inﬁghting on the task force was, as one participant recalled, “terribly sharp.”47 Richard Boone later wrote that, in his mind, the community action program was to be the antipoverty program, but that other elements, like the Job Corps, were added by advocates who had tried for years to get congressional support for massive youth employment pro-\n\nThe Construction of Community Action in the Great Society / 27\n\ngrams.48 Bobby Kennedy intervened on behalf of community action and reportedly laid down the gauntlet to his frustrated brother-in-law, telling him that if community action was not included in the Economic Opportunity Act, he wouldn’t support the legislation and he’d refuse to testify on its behalf to Congress.49 In the end, the legislation incorporated both viewpoints. Title I contained its youth employment programs, including the Job Corps, worktraining, and work-study programs. Title II established the Community Action Program, which would provide grants to local agencies that developed antipoverty programs with the maximum feasible participation of the poor. But Title II also established an adult basic education program that made grants directly to states and a voluntary assistance program for needy children that worked through local social welfare agencies. Other sections of the legislation provided loans to small businesses and impoverished rural families, provided assistance to migrant farm workers, and established work experience programs through the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Of the legislation’s other provisions, only VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America), through which the Ofﬁce of Economic Opportunity (OEO) trained young volunteers and referred them to local social agencies, shared community action’s potential for disruption.50 Hackett, for one, thought this was a betrayal of the work done in the Kennedy administration to reform the federal bureaucracy. Instead of launching a poverty program that would enable and coordinate locally derived efforts, the new OEO now threatened to become just another old-line executive department, jealously running its programs and resources. If JFK had not been killed, Hackett later mused, community action would have been the whole War on Poverty.51 As it was, it emerged as only one part of it. By the spring, several community action proponents—including Boone —had been formed into their own small task force within a task force to write the community action section of the legislation. Shriver appointed Jack Conway to head the group. Conway had come from the United Auto Workers (UAW), where, as a sociology graduate student at the University of Chicago, he had been a successful wartime organizer at the Buick plant in Melrose Park. After the war, he became a close assistant to Walter Reuther and acted as the labor leader’s liaison with President Kennedy. Conway brieﬂy served in the Housing and Home Finance Agency before leaving, frustrated at the slow pace of political life, to head the UAW’s industrial union department in early 1963. In that capacity, he also served as the UAW’s representative on the March on Washington organizing commit-\n\n28 / Chapter One\n\n3. The intensely local work of community action was promoted as a challenge to those enjoying the fruits of postwar afﬂuence—and perhaps growing apathetic because of them—as seen in this college recruitment poster for the Community Action Program. (National Archives 381-PX-2)\n\ntee, worked to raise bail for those arrested in the Birmingham protests that year, and served on the National Service Corps task force, where he ﬁrst met David Hackett and Richard Boone.52 Walter Reuther was a steadfast supporter of community action. The only criticism he had of the program, as it was emerging in the spring of 1964, was that it didn’t do enough. So in April, after a visit with Lyndon Johnson, he announced that the UAW executive board had dedicated $1.1 million to what he called the Citizens’ Crusade Against Poverty.53 CCAP’s aim was twofold: to lobby Congress and the public for the antipoverty legislation\n\nThe Construction of Community Action in the Great Society / 29\n\nand to identify and train local community leaders to work in the poverty program. Reuther saw the local community action agencies that would be established by the legislation as the rough equivalent of trade union locals, and Conway recruited UAW labor educators to do the training. In arguing for the creation of CCAP before the UAW’s executive board, Reuther said that “what we really have to do is to train people in the poor neighborhoods to do in terms of their problems what we did thirty years ago. . . . John Lewis didn’t go into a single General Motors plant. . . . The guys in the plants did the job and that is what has got to be done with the poverty neighborhoods.”54 But while Reuther gave the hard sell, his protégé on the community action task force sent a mixed message about the role of the poor in the program. In meetings and speeches, Conway often declared the centrality of poor people’s involvement in the design and implementation of the antipoverty effort. Three days after Reuther met with President Johnson, testifying on behalf of the legislation to a House committee, Conway promoted the maximum feasible participation of the poor by noting its basis in the “belief that local citizens understand their communities best and that they will seize the initiative and provide sustained, vigorous leadership.” But he also popularized the image of a three-legged stool to explain the participation component: community action was a single program supported by city hall, private organizations, and members of the community to be served. He ﬁrst deployed that image when speaking to a group of visiting mayors.55\n\nThe tension between Conway’s presentations—would the poor lead local antipoverty efforts, or be one equal leg of the stool?—preﬁgured much of the drama to come as community action was rolled out in speciﬁc cities. But that tension had already emerged in the one place that had served as a laboratory for the participatory ethic: the Lower East Side. While antipoverty ofﬁcials like Conway stumped for the legislation on Capitol Hill, they had to contend with the drama that broke out when Mobilization for Youth took a social-activist turn and when that turn made it the target of an antiradical backlash. When rioting broke out in New York City that summer, the MFY drama was refracted through it and given higher stakes and greater urgency. The administrative routes along which funds and ideas had traveled to create community action proved equally adept at transmitting local controversies onto the national stage. This was a sign of things to come.\n\n30 / Chapter One\n\nThe trouble began in August 1963, at a meeting of the Mobilization for Youth staff. They were called together to discuss the possibility of offering their explicit support to the upcoming March on Washington and of moving beyond what some regarded as a narrow conception of antidelinquency work. If the goal, following Ohlin and Cloward’s theory, was to reform the local power structure and to do that with a heavy dose of resident participation, then, some proposed, maybe it was time to expand their efforts to political organizing. The question before them, according to Cloward, was how to “ride with this groundswell” of the civil rights movement. “The institutional resistances to change, to a redistribution of social and economic resources, to a greater sharing of power with dispossessed groups—these changes do not come about simply because we believe they should or simply because somebody gives us a great deal of money to develop programs to achieve them,” he told the meeting. “In the end . . . a broad political thrust—not just a professional one—is needed to bring about basic changes.”56 In response, the staff voted to endorse the march and to launch a voter-registration campaign. Shortly thereafter, the FBI, responding to a request from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, initiated a loyalty check of MFY members.57 By then, though, MFY had already begun to stir things up on the Lower East Side. Its Visiting Homemakers program, made up of one “indigenous homemaker” from each neighborhood housing project, for example, had taught local women how to stand up for themselves as the central consumers and caregivers in their households. They mapped out reputable stores and health clinics and learned how to confront the local butcher, who regularly sold them bad meat, and how to call the housing authority to demand new kitchen appliances.58 As part of its social action work, MFY invited established low-income neighborhood groups to use its facilities and resources. In the process, it formed relationships with local protest movements. At the end of 1963, MFY joined a broad city rent-strike movement and organized local tenant organizations against landlords and city housing agencies.59 In January, it hosted a three-hour meeting at which a rent-strike coordinating committee was formed by representatives of several Lower East Side neighborhood organizations, including the East Side Tenants Council, the Negro Action Group, the University Settlement Housing Clinic, the Council of Puerto Rican Organizations, and a chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality.60 As with housing, so with the local schools: MFY staff members became convinced that the key to reform was to exert pressure on those who controlled the system. One staffer helped organize a group of ﬁfteen Puerto Ri-\n\nThe Construction of Community Action in the Great Society / 31\n\ncan women into what they called Mobilization of Mothers (MOM). In the fall of 1963, MOM rented out a school auditorium and called friends and neighbors to a meeting to discuss the educational needs of their children. They invited a local principal, who came only after complaining that the PTA was really the proper channel for such discussion. When he met the parents in the auditorium, he told them that he’d speak very brieﬂy, since they wouldn’t understand him anyway. “Look at how hard it is for me to talk to you,” he said. “Imagine how difﬁcult it is then for a teacher to handle a class full of children who can’t speak English.” The meeting ended in a volley of angry vituperation, and MOM soon organized a petition drive demanding that the principal be ﬁred.61 At the end of January 1964, twenty-six school principals on the Lower East Side signed a statement demanding that the city superintendent of schools, the president of the board of education, and MFY’s sponsors investigate the group’s promotion of a “war against individual schools and their leaders.” The principals charged that the head of MFY’s action program had turned his workers into “full-time paid agitators and organizers for extremist groups.” They deemed these actions “an abuse of the noble purpose for which great sums of federal and municipal money were originally appropriated.” Instead of ﬁghting juvenile delinquency, residents organized by MFY were complaining about racial discrimination and the lack of appropriate textbooks.62 The chairman of the MFY board voiced his support for the program. He understood that the community action approach was bound to move MFY in unexpected directions. Its staff, he told the New York Times, was paid to work with “independent self-directed groups of low-income residents on the Lower East Side. These are groups who know their own minds, who are aware that they and their children have serious problems in education, housing, employment and discrimination generally. Mobilization gives them the staff work they need to voice their concerns effectively.”63 Similarly, members of the local school board districts agreed to hold hearings on the matter but noted that the actions of these parents, rather than marking them as extremist agitators, “may be the normal response of concerned minority group people who simply seek a better education for their children.”64 Undaunted by the controversy, MFY members joined the citywide school boycott, in which nearly half of the city’s school children stayed home. Absences on the Lower East Side were said to be particularly heavy, around 80 percent.65 As the Economic Opportunity Act made its way through Congress during the summer of 1964, the controversy over MFY heated up even more.\n\n32 / Chapter One\n\nThe fatal shooting of a black teenager by police lieutenant Thomas Gilligan on the Upper East Side led to a week of protests, violent confrontations between police and residents, and large-scale looting and vandalism that began in Harlem and spread to Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn.66 As the violence subsided on the sixth day, a reporter for the Times noted a lingering “air of militancy.” He described “a neatly dressed young woman [walking] determinedly along 125th Street,” a leaﬂet with a picture of Lieutenant Gilligan attached to her shirt. The leaﬂet read: “Wanted for Murder—Gilligan the Cop.” Rioting broke out again that night.67 A month later, on the morning of August 16, a mayoral aide announced that the city’s Department of Investigation was looking into charges that “left-wingers by the score” had inﬁltrated Mobilization for Youth “and diverted its funds and even its mimeograph machines to disruptive agitation.” That night, the mayor and the city council president conﬁrmed the investigation. That councilman was also the coordinator of the city’s Poverty Council, which controlled the municipal share of MFY’s budget, and he said the council would approve no expenditures to MFY until the charges were proven untrue. The most serious of them, he said, was that a leaﬂet reading “Wanted for Murder—Gilligan the Cop” had been printed at one of MFY’s neighborhood centers.68 Winslow Carlton, the chair of MFY’s board, ﬂew back from his vacation on Cape Cod to respond to the charges. At a press conference at East Second Street headquarters, he denied that Communists had taken over the organization and said that he’d spoken to David Hackett in the Justice Department and that Hackett knew nothing of any complaints against MFY, let alone a possible FBI investigation. Carlton also denied that their mimeograph machines had been used in connection with the recent rioting but, when pressed, admitted that someone could have entered one of the neighborhood centers at night and turned out the leaﬂets without his knowing. Later, a spokesman said that the organization’s mimeograph machines would have been incapable of producing the type of leaﬂets ascribed to them and claimed that a local branch of the Progressive Labor Movement had actually printed and distributed the ﬂiers. The next day, an expert printer examined the leaﬂet and concluded it was printed on an offset press, a piece of equipment MFY did not own.69 But the charges and countercharges continued to ﬂy. The FBI revealed that its loyalty check of MFY had turned up fourteen former members of the Communist Party or Communist-front organizations. Upon learning that, Barry Goldwater’s vice presidential pick made it an issue in their national campaign, saying that if the Republican ticket was being accused\n\nThe Construction of Community Action in the Great Society / 33\n\nof extremism, it was only fair that the extremism fostered by the opposing party should be publicized.70\n\nThe timing of the MFY controversy could not have been worse, and ofﬁcials involved with the creation and shuttling through Congress of the Economic Opportunity Act were reportedly in a panic. The New York Times called MFY the “prototype” of the local agencies that would be created by the Community Action Program and reported that its ofﬁcials regarded the legislation as a mandate to support local rent strikes, school boycotts, and other social action campaigns.71 The same day the paper ran that story, Sargent Shriver wrote the Times a letter stridently denying that MFY was a community action prototype. In fact, he wrote, there couldn’t be any prototypes for a program designed to generate countless unique programs, each tailored to the needs of a particular community. He insisted that “local innovation will be the watchword.”72 Two days after Shriver penned his missive, Lyndon Johnson signed the Economic Opportunity Act into law, and community action became ofﬁcial US policy. Johnson himself seemed to know little about it. Adam Yarmolinsky, the antipoverty task force deputy director, later recalled that he had had a conversation with Bill Moyers, Johnson’s special assistant, during which he mentioned that local antipoverty agencies would be receiving grants under the new program. Moyers asked him what he was talking about. Johnson, Moyers said, had been thinking the War on Poverty was like the New Deal’s National Youth Administration, which had provided job training and schooling to hundreds of thousands of young Americans.73 If the president seemed clueless and potentially alarmed by community action, ofﬁcials at Mobilization for Youth and the Committee on Juvenile Delinquency had developed a keen understanding of its possibilities and pitfalls. When asked by a reporter whether its programs supporting rent strikes, school boycotts, and MOM protests could be run “without alienating established community leaders,” MFY’s director said, “It can’t be done. These programs involved shifts in power and prestige. If somebody’s gaining something, somebody else is giving something up.” While others questioned whether such activities should be supported by public funds, one member of the PCJD who had become convinced that the reorganization of local opportunity structures had to be led by the poor themselves said that an important part of the work agencies like MFY could do was to identify “a community’s indigenous leadership.” He had watched this pro-\n\n34 / Chapter One\n\ncess on the Lower East Side. The programs supported by the presidential panel need not organize protests or any other direct actions themselves, he said, but should help residents organize themselves around their own wishes and desires. “When you deal in this way with a population that has a lot of pent-up frustration,” he admitted shortly after the legislation was signed, “you’re bound to have various kinds of explosions that are regarded as unfortunate.”74 By that time, antipoverty ofﬁcials had already fanned out across the country to jump-start the War on Poverty in other cities and regions. They met with local community leaders and told them about the grants that would soon be available under the Community Action Program. In July, a small delegation visited Newark, New Jersey, barely twelve miles from the fracas on the Lower East Side.\n\nT WO\n\nCommunity Action Comes to Newark\n\nAt the end of July 1964, a member of Sargent Shriver’s antipoverty taskforce (and one of David Hackett’s former guerillas) visited Newark. The legislation launching President Johnson’s proposed War on Poverty had already passed the Senate, and as cities across the country prepared proposals for local community action agencies, some sought the guidance of federal antipoverty ofﬁcials. In Newark, the proposal was drawn up by the dean of the Rutgers University School of Law, Willard Heckel, and submitted to Mayor Hugh Addonizio at a meeting in the mayor’s downtown ofﬁce attended by Shriver’s representative and a small band of civic leaders, “all people certainly of outstanding reputation, whom I believe[d] to be very sincere in their desire to do something worthwhile for the city,” Addonizio later recalled. Shriver’s man informed the Newarkers that the nascent Ofﬁce of Economic Opportunity had included their city on a funding priority list and he had come to Newark to help jump-start the process. Addonizio, like many of his colleagues across the nation, was thrilled by the potential ﬁnancial boon awaiting his city, whose Division of Welfare was barely scraping by on emergency appropriations.1 Dean Heckel no doubt shared the mayor’s enthusiasm for increased federal aid, but the antipoverty proposal he submitted that day reﬂected his long-standing interest in municipal reform and civil rights. Over the past decade, he had been intimately involved in several efforts, including the midcentury charter reform movement, to open Newark’s political and economic structures to those largely shut out of it, especially the city’s burgeoning black population.2 His antipoverty proposal was based on a joint effort by the city and Rutgers to create a “social renewal” project in Newark, a project designed to think beyond well-entrenched processes of urban renewal, which many deemed too focused on buildings rather than people,\n\n36 / Chapter Two\n\nas well as beyond existing social welfare agencies, which served more to belittle than empower the people they served.3 In September 1962, the Rutgers Urban Studies Center chose the neighborhood surrounding South Side High School, an area catching much of the black population overﬂow from Newark’s crowded center and whose population of sixty-ﬁve thousand was two-thirds nonwhite, to launch a demonstration project. The South Side Project’s board included representatives from city, county, and state government, Rutgers, the Urban League, and the Newark Housing Authority, but they tasked its director with ensuring that all programs “remain as much as possible in the hands of the youths themselves, and not become dominated by the preconceived ideas of outsiders concerning what kinds of programs and rules are best.”4 One city ofﬁcial visited Washington in February 1963 for a two-day meeting with the President’s Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and, upon his return, reported that the creation of a local nonproﬁt corporation would be the best way for the project to win federal grants. He had learned about the Lower East Side’s Mobilization for Youth and felt it would be a great model for Newark.5 A year later, progress on the project had stalled. Despite the prospect of federal dollars and the impressive amount of work already accomplished, Mayor Addonizio did little to rally support. But the project also ran into opposition from the local Welfare Federation, which accused it of duplicating work it was already doing. Enthusiasm waned, and the project languished.6 So when the news of a federal Community Action Program reached the city, Dean Heckel recognized an opportunity to revive the project and its goals, not only for the South Side, but for the whole city. At the meeting in the mayor’s ofﬁce that July, the gathered group endorsed Heckel’s plan and made it the foundation of the antipoverty effort in Newark. Community action under the War on Poverty was essentially a grants program, and it is part of the logic of grants that a transfer of funds is also a transfer of power. That transaction took place between the federal Ofﬁce of Economic Opportunity and, in Newark’s case, the United Community Corporation (UCC), the city’s ofﬁcially designated community action agency. In some cities, the local agency was controlled by city hall or existing social welfare agencies. In others, the local agency was largely independent of those power centers. More common was some movement between or hybrid of the two possibilities. In Newark, Mayor Addonizio and other members of his political establishment saw great promise in the funds and jobs that would come through the program and, believing he had nothing to worry about from the people of “outstanding reputation” he met with in his ofﬁce that day, granted the UCC independent status.\n\nCommunity Action Comes to Newark / 37\n\nAs on Mobilization for Youth’s Lower East Side, so in Newark. Community action did not land on a political blank slate, but among multiple existing movements for racial justice and political power, of which Dean Heckel’s work was but one small part. Those existing struggles were refracted through community action, which provided them new resources, allies, and directions. An established class of civil rights activists—especially a young generation inspired more by the direct action tactics of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) than the comparatively staid work of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which for years had served a handful of black Newarkers as the pathway into local machine politics—recognized in community action an opportunity to further their struggle against a city government that was proving remarkably inattentive to the demands of the growing black population. This group of activists formed a large part of the UCC’s leadership. As the program spread out from the UCC’s downtown headquarters and into the neighborhoods, however, a third party came into play: the ill-deﬁned “community” called into being by the Community Action Program, those people whose maximum feasible participation was mandated by the Economic Opportunity Act. When it came to programming, Newark’s antipoverty agency was certainly active, but its importance went well beyond the jobs it produced or for which it trained people, the educational head start it provided to thousands of preschoolers, the small business loans it provided, or the play streets it blocked off for children in the summer. It opened a space in which poor Newarkers gained a political and cultural self-awareness, where they constructed a potent sense of peoplehood vis-à-vis city government, and where they forged a political vision in which economic disadvantage did not equal political alienation. In several neighborhoods, residents and organizers pushed hard to maintain community action’s broad participatory ethic, especially as city ofﬁcials and their own communities of supporters, who cherished established political structures, began to ﬁght back. Political wrangling over community action occurred in many cities, of course. But in a city newly attentive to the potentials and shortcomings of municipal administrative form and newly cognizant of an impending black majority, community action’s commitments to bureaucratic disruption and local knowledge were pushed to their limits. Community action was embattled from its earliest days, well before, as the story is often told, the Vietnam War diminished its resources. The earliest controversies over its implementation concerned as much the proper deﬁnition of “feasible” as they did the proper level of funding. Would that deﬁnition be left up to\n\n38 / Chapter Two\n\nthe inhabitants of impoverished areas themselves, to be deﬁned, in effect, by how much they decided to participate? Or would it be determined elsewhere, by city ofﬁcials, federal administrators, or legislative decree? Events in Newark, which drove much of this discussion, demonstrated that, even if the participatory ethic were gutted legislatively, residents could preserve it at a local level. While ofﬁcials in Washington began a retreat from community action, Newarkers continued to forge its frontier.\n\nThe roots of Dean Heckel’s interest in community action stretched back even further than the early-1960s experiments with “social renewal.” He had played several roles in the postwar wave of administrative modernization in New Jersey, which began with a state constitutional convention in 1947 and continued through a statewide surge of municipal charter reform. As a young Rutgers law professor he had submitted a monograph on a potential bill of rights to the 1947 convention, in which he not only ruminated broadly on the relationship between state forms and democracy but also speciﬁcally recommended that an antidiscrimination clause be included in the new state constitution.7 Given such expertise, he was chosen six years later to chair the Newark Citizens Committee on Municipal Government. The committee gathered enough support to organize a formal Newark Charter Commission (this time headed by prominent Newark lawyer Alan Lowenstein, whose son Roger would later invite the president to the university commencement in Ann Arbor).8 In the commission’s subsequent study of alternative government forms, invocations of racial democracy came in the same breath as those of honesty and efﬁciency.9 The existing municipal commission had been established just as the numbers of black migrants to Newark exploded during World War I. As the potential voting power of the predominantly black Third Ward—“The Roaring Third,” it was called—was about to take off, ward-based elections were abolished. Up into the early 1950s, even as black political protest in Newark grew more and more vigorous, taking on discrimination in Depression-era relief programs and union halls, unfair treatment at local retail outlets, and segregation in public swimming pools and City Hospital, for example, and despite a few electoral successes on the county and state level, black Newarkers’ access to city hall was largely limited to patronage positions handed out by city commissioners chosen in citywide voting.10 Reform proponents, including the Urban League, NAACP, and Congress of Industrial Organiza-\n\nCommunity Action Comes to Newark / 39\n\ntions (CIO), therefore argued that municipal charter reform would provide black Newarkers new opportunities for political representation.11 In its ﬁnal report, the Charter Commission proposed a hybrid system of representation. Under its plan, a city council would consist of nine members, ﬁve elected from ﬁve new wards (north, south, east, west, and central) and four elected at large. This proposal, the commissioners wrote, would meet six principles “deemed essential to efﬁcient and responsive local government,” the sixth of which spoke directly to the democratic demands of an ever-diversifying city. “For the ﬁrst time in years,” the report said, “the principal areas of the city and the important elements of its population will be assured representation.”12 In November, Newark voters approved the new charter plan by a nearly two to one margin, and the ﬁrst new elections were scheduled for spring 1954. In the nascent Central Ward—consolidating the old Third and Seventh Wards, along with pieces of several others—the voting was preceded by wrangling between two prospective councilmen, one endorsed by charter reformers and the other Irvine Turner, a Newark native who had twice before run for city commission and lost. Turner had beneﬁted as much as any black Newarker from the older form of government, aligning himself with any commissioner who supported his political and career ambitions. In return, he offered his knack for consolidating the black vote through a mixture of backroom dealing and ﬁery racial rhetoric. When an early electoral plan proposed expansive ward lines that would have diluted black voting power in the Central Ward, Turner dispatched supporters to the Census Bureau in Washington, where they discovered that the proposal was based on faulty data provided by the city clerk. Turner brought suit against the commission, won a revision to its lines, and assured his victory as Newark’s ﬁrst black councilman.13 Once in ofﬁce, Turner consolidated his power by skillfully trading black votes in the Central Ward to local, county, and state politicians for patronage positions and money. He grew close to the head of the Newark Housing Authority and supported the construction of dense high-rise housing that would, at least potentially, provide him more votes to trade. He attacked slumlords, pushed for fairer sentencing in city courts, and called for increased black presence on the police force, on the bench, and in city services.14 The political ﬁefdoms that reigned in Newark under the commission form of government, it seemed, had not been eliminated with charter reform. Rather, they had transmogriﬁed into ward-based systems of political trade with political beneﬁts for Newarkers who had rarely enjoyed them before.\n\n40 / Chapter Two\n\nIn 1962, black Newarkers swung their votes behind US representative Hugh Addonizio, who was running for mayor without the backing of the county Democratic machine against the city’s two-term incumbent. He had garnered Irvine Turner’s endorsement by promising, among other things, action on police brutality and an integrated city hall. He coupled that with blatant ethnic appeals to the city’s Italian American community, to whom he represented an end of Irish-dominated machine control. Together, Italian American and black residents constituted nearly two-thirds of the city’s population, and Addonizio tailored his campaign promises accordingly, lashing out especially at his opponent’s record on urban renewal, which had displaced so many black and Italian American residents. To some observers, this was the end of local municipal reform and a return to the blatant racial and ethnic politics of the commission era. But it worked.15 To many, Addonizio’s victory was a long time coming, but it quickly proved limited. No single city administration could hope to solve the litany of problems that came bundled as “the urban crisis,” and Newark’s growing black militancy did not fade for the presence of a potential ally behind the mayor’s desk. Under Addonizio, city hall became racially integrated like never before, but that hardly appeased all of Newark’s civil rights activists.16 In the summer of 1964, halfway through Addonizio’s ﬁrst term, violent disorders in Harlem, barely twenty miles away, suggested the terrifying cost of failing to address racial concerns and tensions. In response, two black civic leaders, from the Central Ward Democrats and the Labor-Negro Vanguard Conference, a local civil rights group closely allied with the Democratic Party, organized a rally for black voter registration. Two hundred people gathered in the courtyard of the Douglass-Harrison apartments, near the southern edge of the Central Ward. Five speakers addressed the crowd from a sound truck, encouraging them to assert their voting power in the fall. One declared that it was time for a black mayor in Newark. Plainclothes black police ofﬁcers kept watch, and several local businesses boarded up their windows. But the crowd calmly dispersed after only half an hour, when a thunderstorm rolled in.17\n\nEarlier that day, before the storm began and as if in answer to multiple prayers—for help against the urban crisis, for increased black political power—a federal ofﬁcial, one of David Hackett’s guerillas, came to Newark to help launch the local avatar of the Community Action Program. He explained that, once the antipoverty legislation went into effect, Newark could expect the new Ofﬁce of Economic Opportunity to provide 90 per-\n\nCommunity Action Comes to Newark / 41\n\ncent of its community action funding, so long as the project guaranteed broad-based community participation. Mayor Addonizio spent the afternoon gathering pledges of ﬁnancial support from the city council and the municipal boards of education and welfare to cover the remaining 10 percent.18 With the local share of start-up costs covered, Willard Heckel quickly set about the task of recruiting a new class of antipoverty leadership to sign the UCC’s incorporation papers. The group he established contained a mix of government, business, and civic leaders, but the two largest blocks consisted of a group of Addonizio loyalists and a group of activists fresh off recent struggles with the city administration over police brutality and discrimination in the construction trades, struggles that mark the start of the modern civil rights movement in Newark. Most prominent among this latter group was a man named George Richardson.19 As a New Jersey state assemblyman representing Newark and other parts of Essex County in the early 1960s, Richardson had risen from Central Ward bartender to a vital position in the local Democratic machine. At one time, he could count among his closest allies county political boss Dennis F. Carey and Congressman Addonizio. So tight was he with the latter that when Addonizio decided to run for mayor of Newark, he tapped Richardson to be one of his campaign managers. As such, he was instrumental in harnessing the voting power of local civil rights organizations and constructing the alliance of liberals, old-line Democrats, and black Newarkers that swept Addonizio into ofﬁce in 1962. For this, Richardson received a $9,000-a-year position in the new administration.20 The honeymoon, however, was short lived. In Richardson’s view, black community leaders saw their relationship with Addonizio as a means to an end. Well aware of the political possibilities that inhered in recent black migrations to Newark, they viewed Addonizio’s election as a step toward the eventual (and inevitable) election of a predominantly black city administration. Under Addonizio, black supporters and appointees would gain the political education and connections that would help produce future black candidates. But Addonizio, sensing the potential danger, refused many of them jobs in his new administration. Richardson later recalled that that was when black political disenchantment with the Addonizio administration began. Soon after, he became its most visible spokesman. Through a series of confrontations with city hall, he emerged in the mid1960s as a ﬁgurehead of a local campaign for independent black political power, a campaign driven in large part by Addonizio’s broken promises.21 The ﬁrst of these confrontations came in early 1963. Local civil rights\n\n42 / Chapter Two\n\ngroups, led by Richardson and the local CORE chapter, agitated for a civilian review board to investigate complaints of police brutality and present recommendations for action to the mayor. Initially supportive of the idea, Addonizio commissioned a team of city ofﬁcials, including Richardson, to make a study of Philadelphia’s review board and report on its applicability to Newark. In the time it took to make the trip and prepare a favorable recommendation, however, the police department got wind of the plan and launched a fervent campaign against it. Addonizio, ignoring the recommendation of the city’s Human Rights Commission, reversed course, and the director of the commission resigned in protest. Richardson w"
