Ending violence against women is Deer’s life’s goal. A lawyer by training but an advocate in practice, her scholarship focuses on the intersection of federal Indian law and victims’ rights, using indigenous feminist principles as a framework.\n\nDeer is a co-author of four textbooks on tribal law and has been published in a wide variety of law journals. Her 2015 book, The Beginning and End of Rape: Confronting Sexual Violence in Native America, is the culmination of over 25 years of experience working with survivors, and has received several awards, including the Best First Book award from the Native American Indigenous Studies Association.\n\nDeer has testified before Congress on two occasions regarding violence against Native women and was appointed by Attorney General Eric Holder to chair a federal advisory committee on sexual violence in Indian country. Her work to end violence against Native women has received national recognition from the American Bar Association and the Department of Justice, and she was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow in 2014.\n\nDeer currently teaches at the University of Kansas (her alma mater), where she holds a joint appointment in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies and the School of Public Affairs and Administration. Deer is also the Chief Justice for the Prairie Island Indian Community Court of Appeals.\n\nShani C. Mitchell was born and raised in southwest Rochester, NY. She matriculated through the Rochester Public Schools. In 1991, she graduated from Joseph C. Wilson Magnet High School. In 1995, she graduated from Spelman College with a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics. She continued her education, after college, by obtaining her law degree from Florida State University College of Law, in Tallahassee, Florida. After graduating from law school, she joined the Office of the Fulton County District Attorney in Atlanta, Georgia, where she prosecuted felony crimes for seven years. While in this office, she was awarded the Ahmed Dabarran Community Service Award for her commitment to serving the community.\n\nAfter leaving the District Attorney’s Office, she opened her own law practice. Her law practice included the practice of criminal defense, family law, and personal injury. While in private practice, she obtained her Master’s in Criminal Justice from Boston University (2009). After two and a half years of private practice, she realized that her heart lied with prosecution. Thus, she returned to prosecution by joining the Office of the Clayton County Solicitor General, in Jonesboro, Georgia (southern suburb of Atlanta).\n\nWhile in private practice, she began teaching part-time (Southern Polytechnic State University, Marietta, Georgia). When an opportunity arose, she decided to try her hand at teaching full-time. First, as paralegal instructor, Atlanta Technical College. Then, as a professor of criminal justice at SUNY Canton for more than three years.\n\nHer desire to return to her hometown of Rochester, NY, led her back to her first love of prosecution. At 40 years old, in February 2013, I sat for the New York State Bar Exam. She spent more than five years as an Assistant District Attorney for the Office of the Monroe County District Attorney. First, prosecuting misdemeanors, then as sole prosecutor of the office’s auto theft and insurance fraud cases under its grant program. Currently, she is a Municipal Attorney with the City of Rochester.\n\nShani is married and is the mother of a seventeen-year-old son, and a bonus mother to four wonderful daughters. She has been past-President of the Rochester Black Bar Association, an organization that supports the efforts of African-American and other minority attorneys in Monroe County. Currently, she is a member of the Foundation Board of the Monroe County Bar Association. In 2018, she received the Daily Record’s Women in Excellence Award for her work in law and the community.
