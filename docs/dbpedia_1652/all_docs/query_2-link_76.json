        "text": "100 years of innovators and inventors, game-changers, trailblazers, humanitarians—inspirations to us all\n\nEntries and profiles by Mark Matassa (BS '82, journalism)\n\nwith contributions from staff writers in University Communications\n\nHappy 100th birthday to . . . us! Oregon Quarterly was born in March 1919 as Old Oregon, “issued for Alumni and Former Students of the University.” The 56-page publication opened with a remembrance of the UO’s early days and included campus happenings, marriages, and—then as now—class notes. The fledgling magazine was challenged to become a symbol for the inspiration created by the university.\n\nWell, look no farther for inspiration. In celebration of our 100th anniversary, we asked you to nominate 100 Ducks Who Made a Difference: alumni, students, faculty, staff, administrators, and friends of the university, from 1919 to present, who, through grit, talent, compassion, or creativity have made our world better.\n\nAnd you delivered. We narrowed hundreds of your worthy submissions into a list of 100 barrier breakers and change makers. What you’ll see is not a ranking of the top, the best, the richest, or the famous. (Indeed, even Phil Knight is not on the list.) Rather, thanks to your ideas, it displays, in alphabetical order, a diverse range of Ducks—a few familiar, many unexpected—who represent the impact the UO has made over the last century.\n\nWe think this list makes good on the challenge issued to the magazine 100 years ago. Thank you for your submissions . . . and Go Ducks!\n\n—George Evano, publisher, Oregon Quarterly\n\nShare your achievements\n\nSubscribe to OQ\n\nJump to Section: A-B, C-D, E-F, G-H, I-J, K-L, M-N, O-P, Q-R, S-T, U-V, W-X, Y-Z\n\nPaula Gunn Allen\n\nBA ’66 ENGLISH, MFA ’68 CREATIVE WRITING, D. 2008\n\nThe Native American poet and scholar wrote award-winning novels and inspired a generation of feminist writers.\n\nAisha Almana\n\nBS ’70 SOCIOLOGY\n\nThe hospital executive’s vision and generosity is creating opportunities for women through the UO Global Health program.\n\nCorazón Aquino\n\nHONORARY PHD ’95, D. 2009\n\nThe first female president of the Philippines, she restored democracy after the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos.

As the internet threatens to stamp out newspapers, Bottomly is leading the Oregonian’s transformation to a digital-first newsroom, a capstone accomplishment in a 35-year tenure at the newspaper. Along the way, she has also fought to protect public access to government records in board positions with Open Oregon and the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association. “She’s got the editing of a surgeon, the mind of an attorney, and the soul of a philosopher,” says Tom Hallman, an Oregonian colleague. Bottomly adds: “I would not have had the career I have had without people at UO looking out for me.”\n\nTherese Bottomly\n\nAs a manager and now top editor at the Oregonian, Therese Bottomly (BA ’83, journalism) has had a hand in grooming a generation of journalists and in Pulitzer Prize-winning stories— including the fascinating journey of a French fry from farmland to fast-food delicacy.

She collaborated with sociologist W. E. B. DuBois and worked with President Franklin Roosevelt’s National Industrial Recovery Act programs, supervising the implementation of codes designed to ensure equal pay, working conditions, and employment opportunities for African Americans.\n\nAs a research assistant at Fisk University in Nashville, Byrd investigated conditions in segregated schools. While there, she risked her position by confronting the university president at a public meeting, demanding to know why all the freshman advisors were white. In a question that echoed her own housing experience at the UO, she asked why the university had “built new houses for white faculty while asking black professors to live in dormitories with students.”\n\nMabel Byrd 1895-1988\n\nWhen Mabel Byrd enrolled in 1917 she was not only the UO’s first African American student but also the only black person in Eugene.

Undeterred, she took up wheelchair basketball, made two USA Paralympic teams, worked in humanitarian aid in Iraq, and dedicated herself to raising awareness of disability issues.\n\nThrough her humanitarian program, Tozer taught disabled Iraqis how to advocate for themselves and 10,000 women learned to read and write. The university named her a 2010 outstanding young alumna.\n\nAfter 35 surgeries and four years of rehabilitation, Tozer refers to herself as “the walking wounded.”\n\nA self-described realistic optimist, she believes her scars may reveal where she has been, but they don’t define her—or where she is going.\n\nTiana Tozer\n\nHer website tells Tiana Tozer’s story in eight words: “One car crash, two Paralympics, three war zones.”\n\nThe crash, when she was a college sophomore, left Tozer (BA ’90, Romance languages) without the use of her legs.

He left his mark in Eugene and on campus, as well—Unthank Jr. designed the Lane County Courthouse complex and UO’s McKenzie and Bean halls and taught in the architecture school from 1965 to 1982.\n\nHe was a partner at Wilmsen, Endicott, and Unthank architects and in 1968 cofounded the firm Unthank, Seder, and Poticha. As a designer, he carried himself with class—just as he had as a college student, overcoming fierce racist attacks for dating a white woman who later became his wife. Upon renaming Dunn Hall for Unthank Jr., UO president Michael Schill said it honors “achievement, tolerance, and equity.”\n\nDeNorval Unthank Jr. 1929-2000\n\nBy the time Dunn Hall was renamed in his honor in 2017, DeNorval Unthank Jr. had designed himself quite a reputation as an architect.\n\nThe first African American graduate of the architecture school (BARC ’52) designed schools, banks, houses, medical clinics, and hospitals across the country and around the world.

Inspired by the region’s potential to produce teas on par with neighboring Darjeeling, Vable promised Avani if they would plant tea, he would buy their entire harvest; the partners received a grant to get started and Young Mountain Tea was born.\n\nVable later secured a fellowship to open a Young Mountain Tea store in the US, now in Springfield. Since then, he’s won a World Tea award for building India’s next generation of tea producers and his company has secured national distribution for Kumaon teas.\n\nRaj Vable\n\nRaj Vable’s passion for his parents’ homeland, community development, and white tea is bringing quality jobs to a remote region of India.\n\nVable, MS ’12 (environmental studies), launched Young Mountain Tea in 2013 while on a Fulbright Fellowship in the Kumaon region.\n\nAt the time he was working with Avani, a Himalayan nonprofit that converts dead pine needles to fuel, giving people an alternative to chopping down trees.
