All students at Curtis receive merit-based, full-tuition scholarships, and Mr. Gullett is the Edwin B. Garrigues Fellow.\n\nIt was at age 12 that he began his studies on the trombone.

During his studies at Lake High School in Uniontown, Ohio, Derek was a part of the school’s marching band, concert band, and jazz orchestra. Outside of school hours, he was the principal trombonist of numerous youth ensembles such as the Canton Youth Symphony Advanced Orchestra, Akron Youth Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra Youth Orchestra, and Ohio All-State Orchestra. Halfway through high school, he began to study trombone under Richard Stout, second trombonist of the Cleveland Orchestra. In addition to being a part of many youth ensembles, he also had professional engagements, such as being the principal trombonist of both the Akron Civic Theater Orchestra and the Freedom Brass Band of Akron, Ohio.\n\nFollowing high school, Derek enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music to further his studies with Nitzan Haroz and Matthew Vaughn, principal, and co-principal trombonists of the Philadelphia Orchestra, respectively. Partway into his studies at Curtis, he began to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra and can be heard in numerous video and recording projects of theirs.

Another major influence in his development as a trombonist is Joseph Alessi, principal trombonist of the New York Philharmonic. Currently, Derek is pursuing his bachelor’s degree at Curtis, where he is a recipient of the Edwin B. Garrigues fellowship.\n\nOver the course of his career thus far, Derek has had the opportunity to tour the world with numerous ensembles and has performed in coveted halls such as Verizon Hall, Severance Hall, Stift St. Florian, Musikverein Wien, and Carnegie Hall. He has also had the pleasure of collaborating with many world-renowned conductors such as Vinay Parameswaran, Franz Welser-Möst, Teddy Abrams, Michael Tilson-Thomas, Osmo Vänskä, Peter Oundjian, Michael Stern, Andrew Grams, and Yannick Nezet-Seguin.\n\nIn addition to being a passionate performer, Derek is equally at home in a teaching environment.

All students at Curtis receive merit-based, full-tuition scholarships, and Ms. Gleason is the Rita E. Hauser Conducting Fellow.\n\nMs. Gleason has been recognized for her diverse performance abilities as a conductor, vocal soloist, and chamber musician. Interdisciplinary collaboration and community building are at the core of her music-making. She is curious about the most effective ways to disrupt the stasis and comfort of the modern concert hall; to examine how the disciplines of music research, performance, and perception can grow more aware of each other, and how artists across disciplines, activists, and researchers can most effectively collaborate. She holds a Bachelor of Music degree in vocal performance from the Chicago College of Performing Arts and Master of Music degrees in conducting and vocal arts from the Bard College Conservatory of Music.\n\nAn alumna of several notable training programs, including the Aspen Music Festival and the Conducting Institute at Oxford, Ms. Gleason was one of eight inaugural vocal fellows at the Crested Butte Music Festival. Her output as a vocal soloist ranges from concert appearances, including alto soloist in Handel’s Messiah and Mozart’s Requiem, multiple operatic roles, and an extensive song and chamber music repertoire. She also served as the alto artist in residence at the University of Chicago for two years, where she was a regularly featured soloist. As a conductor, Ms. Gleason has led notable ensembles such as The Orchestra Now and the Eastern Festival Orchestra.\n\nWhile obtaining her degrees at Bard College Conservatory of Music, studying under James Bagwell and Stephanie Blythe respectively, she served as the assistant conductor of the Bard Symphonic Chorus, conductor of the Bard Opera Workshop, and the assistant conductor of the Bard Graduate Vocal Arts Program’s main stage production of Janáček’s The Cunning Little Vixen, in collaboration with The Orchestra Now. In July 2022, Ms. Gleason served as the music director for the world premiere of the opera The Final Veil during its residency at The Cell Theater in New York City.\n\nAlongside mezzo-soprano Joanne Evans, she is a co-founder of Loam, an artistic partnership presenting semi-immersive musical works. Current projects include co-conceiving, producing, and performing as a featured singer in The Fragile Femme, collaborating with director George Miller and choreographer Matilda Sakamoto.\n\nMs. Gleason was named a 2021 conducting fellow at the Eastern Music Festival, where she studied with Gerard Schwarz, received the 2021 Emerging Conductor Award from The Gena Branscombe Project, and was named a National Finalist for The American Prize in Conducting."
