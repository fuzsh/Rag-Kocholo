        "text": "George Lepauw\n\n“A prodigious pianist” (Chicago Tribune) recognized for his “singing tone” (New York Times), and someone who “likes to shake it up” (Chicago Tribune), George Lepauw is an artist and cultural activist who uses music to inspire and bring people together. He has performed across the United States as a recitalist, soloist with orchestra and chamber musician, and has toured internationally as far as Asia, South America, and Europe presenting a wide range of repertoire covering five hundred years of music up to our day, all guided by his insatiable musical curiosity.\n\nNamed Chicagoan of the Year (2012) for Classical Music (Chicago Tribune), George represents the ideal 21st century musician, intensely focused on his art and wholly engaged with the world. In 2009 he had the honour of giving the World Premiere performance of a newly-discovered and long-lost piano trio of Beethoven’s to great acclaim, which was followed by a highly-praised first recording with the Beethoven Project Trio for Cedille Records.\n\nAlong with his trio recording, George Lepauw has released several solo albums, including the monumental Well-Tempered Clavier by J.S. Bach. Given five stars by BBC Music Magazine, the publication noted that his “journey through these wonderful pieces is contemplative, commendably articulate and enhanced by unfailing linear clarity.” His other albums are Debussy’s complete Préludes for piano, and Beethoven’s Diabelli Variations, all for the London-based Orchid Classics label.\n\nIn addition to his performance career, George is a cultural activist and organiser. He is the Founder of the International Beethoven Project (IBP), a non-profit organisation based in Chicago and focused on innovation in the arts through which he has organised multi-disciplinary festivals, special events, educational programs and annual “Beethoven Birthday Bashes”. Additionally, George was Executive Director of the Chicago International Movies & Music Festival (CIMMfest) from 2016 to 2018, which allowed him to deepen his passion for film, an artform he has occasionally participated in as a producer, composer, and musician for over a decade. In 2020, he led an initiative for the Beethoven-Haus in Bonn, Germany to collect thousands of birthday messages to Beethoven from around the world for his 250th anniversary.\n\nGeorge was born in France into a musical family and spent his childhood attending orchestra rehearsals and concerts: his grandfather Roger Lepauw was Principal Viola of the Paris Opera Orchestra as well as of the Orchestre de Paris and his father Didier Lepauw was First Violin with the Orchestre de Paris. He began piano studies at the age of three in Paris with Aïda Barenboim (mother of pianist and conductor Daniel Barenboim) and furthered his studies with Elena Varvarova, Brigitte Engerer, Vladimir Krainev, Rena Shereshevskaya, James Giles, Ursula Oppens and Earl Wild. He earned degrees from Georgetown University (B.A. in Literature, Film Studies and History) and from Northwestern University (M.M. in Piano Performance). George is a frequent speaker and guest teacher at universities and conferences as well as on radio and television. He also does occasional arts consulting for cultural institutions and festivals and teaches piano to a select number of private students and through master classes. After living for many years in the United States, George is now again primarily based in his native city of Paris.\n\nPhoto credit: Tatiana Gorilovsky\n\nDr. Rebecca Davis\n\nDr. Rebecca Davis spends her time looking at models of things we can’t see to try to explain why one yellow liquid turns into another yellow liquid. To put it another way, Dr. Davis is a Professor specializing in Organic and Computational Chemistry at the University of Manitoba. Rebecca was born in Torrance, California, in 1984 and grew up across the west coast of the US. Being socially awkward and bad at sports, she gravitated toward education and received an Associate’s Degree of Fine Arts at the age of 17, with a specialization in photography, from Lower Columbia College, Longview, WA. Realizing that her passion for photography was largely driven by the chemical processes involved in developing film, she switched focuses and earned a B.Sc. degree in Chemistry at Washington State University. She went on to complete a Ph.D. in Computational Chemistry at the University of California, Davis, using quantum mechanical models to examine unexpected reactivity in transition metal catalyzed reactions. While completing her Ph.D., she received highly competitive and prestigious funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Emerging Leaders in the Americas program. Wanting to expand her horizons and diversify her skill sets, Dr. Davis accepted a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Center for Catalysis at Aarhus University, Denmark. While there, she applied her skills in the development of metal free catalysts that expand the arsenal of chemical transformations available for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. In 2014, she joined the faculty in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Manitoba as an Assistant Professor and was promoted to Full Professor in 2024. Dr. Davis is leading one of the leading research groups worldwide that combine extensive experience in computational modelling with state-of-the-art experimental synthetic chemistry to address the massive ecological footprint and enormous resource demands of the chemical industry by making processes in organic chemistry more efficient.\n\nAt the University of Manitoba, Dr. Davis has worked to build an innovative, interdisciplinary, and internationally recognized research program, producing significant peer reviewed contributions and a supportive training environment for student researchers. Given the fundamental nature of her research program, her group has been able to apply their methodology to advanced research in a number of areas including antibiotic discovery, early detection of Parkinson’s disease, sustainability in chemical synthesis, feature development for the accelerated discovery of drug compounds, and the total synthesis of shard steroids.\n\nDr. Davis is passionate for the advancement of science and has a vocabulary that appears to lack the word “no”. As a result, she has served the scientific community, university, her department, and the general public with her efforts in building and developing scientific communities and networks, shaping future scientific strategies as well as public science outreach. On the national level, she actively supports researchers across Canada by serving on the Researcher Council for the National Digital Research Alliance. She has also served the chemistry community in Canada as an inaugural member of the NSERC–Chemistry Liaison Committee, as a member of the Executive board of the Organic Division of the Canadian Society for Chemistry, and as an Associate Editor for the Canadian Journal of Chemistry. In addition to these roles, Dr. Davis works to support and advocate for women and minorities in the sciences. For example, she co-founded the Working for Inclusivity in Chemical Sciences group at the University of Manitoba and participates in outreach events to promote science to young women and children. The results of her efforts in research and outreach have led to her being named one of Canada’s most Powerful Women in 2023.\n\nOutside of her work, Rebecca spends her time raising her son, renovating her home, and playing board games. In the summer, she enjoys waking up before sunrise to sit in fields waiting for the right wind conditions to fly her powered paraglider with the other members of the Prairies Powered Paragliding group.\n\nMatt Hay\n\nMatt Hay, MBA has a long journey toward deafness and even longer journey toward learning to “hear” again with an experimental brainstem implant. He first publicly shared his story on a National Public Radio (NPR) podcast titled Soundtrack of Silence. The intimate, funny and authentic peek at what it’s like to start a career, fall in love and build a life while battling a rare disease inspired actor Channing Tatum and Paramount Pictures to option the motion picture rights to Matt’s life story. Matt’s memoir Soundtrack of Silence was released in January 2024 by St. Martin’s Press, an imprint of Macmillan. Publishers Weekly said Hay’s “moving memoir makes magic out of facing the music” and it immediately earned a spot as an Amazon Best Seller within the Disability category.\n\nWhen Matt isn’t adding tracks to the soundtrack of his life, he passionately supports the hearing loss community as a member of the Columbia University Genetic Counseling Advisory Board and previously as a consultant to the St. Joseph Institute for the Deaf. He proudly served as a Congressional lobbyist for neurofibromatosis (NF) research funding, the genetic disorder that caused his hearing loss, and has raised money for NF research by doing endurance events, including an Ironman Triathlon and most recently, the Boston Marathon.\n\nMatt currentlyserves the rare disease community as the US Director of Advocacy for a global biopharmaceutical company and is a doctoral candidate at the Indiana University School of Public Health with a focus on global health leadership. He lives in Westfield, Indiana, with his wife (whom he’s quick to point out is the hero of his story) and three children.\n\nBrooke Skinner Ricketts\n\nBrooke Skinner Ricketts is a growth strategist devoted to transforming possibility into performance.\n\nBrooke is an experienced queer executive who went from doing market research at truck stops to sitting in the c-suite and on the boards of public companies before her 40th birthday.
