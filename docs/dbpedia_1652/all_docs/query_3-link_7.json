        "text": "A note from CEO, Amy Bach\n\nOur Board Chair, Edwin Schallert, passed away on December 7, 2021, after a three-year fight against ALS.\n\nEd was a leading litigation partner at Debevoise & Plimpton and had more accolades and honors than most. Prior to joining the firm he served as a Law Clerk to Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall, US Supreme Court, and to the Honorable J. Skelly Wright, US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nI first met Ed in his office at Debevoise almost ten years ago. His demeanor was low key, but as I showed him some early drafts of our data, his eyes lit up. He immediately understood the power of criminal justice data transparency. He said he would like to do whatever he could for us. And he joined our Board.\n\nOver the next eight years Ed was often our first call. His equanimity and judgment were unparallelled. We could be transparent with Ed. After every meeting with him, every call, we always left with clearer thinking and the feeling that he had our backs. I have heard many clients and friends feel the same way. How privileged we were to be able to ask: What would Ed do?\n\nEd loved to run and even as he was experiencing early symptoms, a good run had him feeling optimistic about his chances. But when he was officially diagnosed, we immediately knew we wanted to begin honoring him. We named our conference room after him. We also established “Ed Talks,” designed to bring thought leaders together to discuss key topics in criminal justice. During our first Ed Talk, so many people expressed what we knew first hand: Ed was an amazing person all around. He was a mentor to so many.\n\nWe never doubted his dedication to our organization. He remained our Board chair until he died. He lost his ability to speak but he still typed in his thoughts and feelings, and he could be very funny, typing just a single word so we could understand him.\n\nAll of us at MFJ have been the recipients of his kindness and superb judgment. Ed, we pray you’re up in heaven having a good long run. Thank you for giving us your best. We are much better for having you in our lives. We miss you all the time. Ed Talks will continue.\n\nLenny Mendonca was the Chief Economic and Business Advisor to Governor Gavin Newsom of California and Chair of the California High Speed Rail Authority. He is a Senior Partner Emeritus of McKinsey & Company and a Lecturer on Inequality at the Stanford Business School.\n\nHe founded McKinsey’s U.S. state and local public sector consulting practice. He also oversaw their knowledge development, Chairing the McKinsey Global Institute and the Firm’s communications, including the McKinsey Quarterly. He served for a decade on the McKinsey Shareholder Council (its Board of Directors). He retired from McKinsey in 2014.\n\nHe is the Chair of Fidelity Charitable and New America. He was the Chair of Children Now, co-Chair of California Forward, and co-founder and Chair of Fusecorps. He was the Vice-Chair of Common Cause. He is the Chair Emeritus of the Bay Area Council and their Economic Institute, and was vice-chair of the Stanford GSB Advisory Council. He was a trustee at the Committee for Economic Development. He has served on the boards of Western Governors University, UC Merced, The Educational Results Partnership, The College Futures Foundation, California Competes, The Opportunity Institute, Commonwealth Club, National Association of NonPartisan Reformers, Measures for Justice, and The Guardian.org. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He served on the Board of Trustees for Junior Statesmen of America, and the Advisory Boards of Y Analytics, QB3, the Haas Center at Stanford, Third Sector Capital, The CA Community College Chancellor’s Office, Measures for Justice, and the Public Policy Institute of California.\n\nHe received his MBA and certificate in public management from Stanford. He holds an AB, magna cum laude, in economics from Harvard.\n\nHe lives on the Half Moon Bay coast with his wife, Christine. They raised their two daughters, Allie and Rebecca, there and are the founders and owners of the Half Moon Bay Brewing Company and The Inn at Mavericks. He is also the Founding Chair of the Coastside News Group (Half Moon Bay Review and Pacifica Tribune)."
