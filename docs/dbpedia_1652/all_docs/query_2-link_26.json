        "text": "New Year's Eve Concert: Program Notes\n\nVoices of Afghanistan\n\nAs America, after twenty years of waging a war that should never have begun, finally withdrew from Afghanistan, leaving chaos in its wake, it brought home to me that my country is incorrigible, doomed to ignore the lessons of the past and endlessly repeat the same mistakes. Feeling so powerless to effect any positive change, I turned, as always, to music. With the world focused on all of the turmoil in Afghanistan, I knew that the greatness of Afghanistan's past was being overlooked - a country so rich in poetic and musical tradition. It was to that voice that I wanted to give expression and turned to poems, both ancient and contemporary, to set this music with hope that after so many years of horrific violence, the poetic soul of Afghanistan can one day be reborn without oppression, whether imposed from without or within. - Stanley Grill\n\nAdinu\n\nAdinu is a traditional Sufi melody, the text of which is attributed to the Andalusian Moorish Sufi mystic, philosopher, poet, and sage, Abu 'Abdillah Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn Muhammad ibn 'Arabi (1165-1240). Born and brought up in Spain and traveling widely in Asia Minor, he died in Damascus. Regarded as one of the most influential figures in world spirituality, his writings numbering more than 350 books, which he considered to be divinely inspired by the prophets Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, have been studied by theologians and scholars of all religions. Known as \"The Greatest Master,\" he believed that love was the dominant existential and universal force. Accordingly, he is, even today, a powerful symbol of inter-religious harmony.\n\nQudduus means \"Holy\" and is a text from Isaiah 6:3, that is central to Christian, Islamic and Jewish worship. In Islam, Qudduus refers to one of the ninety-rune names (or attributes) of God as found in the Qur'an. The text is strikingly similar to the Christian Sanctus (Latin for \"Holy\") and is a precursor to it. The melody is derived from a Christian Maronite hymn.\n\nShalom Aleichem\n\nShalom Aleichem (Hebrew: שָׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם, 'Peace be upon you') is a traditional song sung by many Jews every Friday night upon returning home from synagogue prayer. It signals the arrival of the Shabbat, welcoming the angels who accompany a person home on the eve of the Shabbat.\n\nNew Year's Eve Concert: Artist Bios\n\nJudy Collins has long inspired audiences with sublime vocals, boldly vulnerable songwriting, personal life triumphs, and a firm commitment to social activism. In the 1960s, she evoked both the idealism and steely determination of a generation united against social and environmental injustices. Five decades later, her luminescent presence shines brightly as new generations bask in the glow of her iconic 55-album body of work, and heed inspiration from her spiritual discipline to thrive in the music industry for half a century.\n\nThe award-winning singer-songwriter is esteemed for her imaginative interpretations of traditional and contemporary folk standards and her own poetically poignant original compositions. Her stunning rendition of Joni Mitchell's “Both Sides Now” from her landmark 1967 album, Wildflowers, has been entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Judy’s dreamy and sweetly intimate version of “Send in the Clowns,” a ballad written by Stephen Sondheim for the Broadway musical A Little Night Music, won \"Song of the Year” at the 1975 Grammy Awards. She’s garnered several top-ten hits gold- and platinum-selling albums. Recently, contemporary and classic artists such as Rufus Wainwright, Shawn Colvin, Dolly Parton, Joan Baez, and Leonard Cohen honored her legacy with the album Born to the Breed: A Tribute to Judy Collins.\n\nThe cultural treasure’s 55th album, Spellbound, was released in February 2022, finds Judy enjoying an artistic renaissance. The 13 song album is a special entry in her oeuvre. It marks the first time ever she wrote all the songs on one of her albums. It features 12 new modern folk songs, and a bonus track of her evergreen, “The Blizzard.” Spellbound is an introspective and impressionistic album. It unfolds as if Judy curated a museum exhibit of her life, and welcomed us into a retrospective of her most formative moments, some big and public, and some intensely personal and intimate. Spellbound has been nominated in the Best Folk Album category at the 65th Recording Academy Grammy Awards in 2023.\n\nHarry Smith is an NBC News Correspondent and recognized as one of television’s most distinguished journalists.

Stan’s passion for medieval and Renaissance music has greatly influenced his writing – a contemporary expression of ageless techniques based on melody, modal harmonies, and contrapuntal, extended, interweaving lines. Two main themes permeate many of his works – music composed in an attempt to translate something about the nature of the physical world, and music composed to inspire and promote world peace.\n\nStan’s music has been performed the world over – from Ecuador to Poland; Toulouse to Tokyo; Brooklyn to Vienna – by such artists as New World Symphony, Camerata Philadelphia, Camerata Arkos, Duo+ Ensemble, Englewinds, Pandolfis Consort, Umbria Ensemble, Diderot Quartet, the Bronx Arts Ensemble, One World Symphony, violists Brett Deubner and Ralph Farris, and violinist Jorge Avila.\n\nA native of San Diego, violinist Alex Fortes is recognized for his versatility and warmth.

He can also be heard on a forthcoming album with the Henschel Quartett and pianist Donald Berman featuring the music of Chris Theofanidis.\n\nFortes holds a strong interest in finding new contexts in which to experience familiar music. His recent arrangements of Schubert lieder and chamber music were hailed by the Boston Globe as “uniformly resourceful and complementary…smart, subtle.” In May 2016, A Far Cry premiered his arrangement with Sarah Darling of Bach’s Goldberg Variations in collaboration with pianist Simone Dinnerstein.\n\nAlex has participated in educational residencies in both English and Spanish related to entrepreneurship, music performance and education, at colleges and public schools throughout the United States.

Improvements in construction and tone, increasingly accurate mandal (moveable bridge) systems, and innovative new techniques have dramatically expanded the instrument’s impact on music. No player has had as much influence on this revolution of kanun playing as Tamer Pinarbaȿi. Tamer was born in Karaman, Turkey in 1970. He began his kanun lessons at the age of 10, appeared in the film “Haci Arif Bey” at 11, performed with Necdet Yaşar at 12, and made his first of hundreds of recordings at 13, with artists such as Orhan Gencebay, İbrahim Tatlıses, and Sibel Can. He attended the Istanbul Technical University State Conservatory of Turkish Music where he developed his unique approach of playing with all ten fingers instead of the traditional method of using plectrums (mızrap) on the two pointer fingers. This technique, as well as his knowledge of both the eastern modal (makam) system and western harmony, paved the way for him becoming one of the world’s greatest kanun virtuosos. After attending ITU, he began giving solo concerts throughout Europe. In 1994, Tamer moved to America, where he has continued to develop his compositional and performance styles in many diverse musical environments, including New York Gypsy All-Stars and The Secret Trio."
