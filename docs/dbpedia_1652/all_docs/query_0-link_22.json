F. Skinner\n\nIf we can be open we find that life's unpredictability is full of interesting and invigorating challenges. These challenges engage us in unexpected and unanticipated ways and allow for the freedom of unscripted responsiveness. Right Action is more than just a reaction. It springs from an attunement to the moment that the confines of convention obscure.\n\nMark Epstein\n\nEach instance of craving involved an escape from the here and now, a desire for becoming or being something or someplace other than what the present moment offered. But to seek ceaselessly some new state of being while at the same time striving for permanence was to expose oneself to frustration.\n\nPankaj Mishra\n\nSome people are content in the midst of deprivation and danger, while others are miserable despite having all the luck in the world. This is not to say that external circumstances do not matter. But it is your mind, rather than circumstances themselves, that determines the quality of your life. Your mind is the basis of everything you experience and of every contribution you make to the lives of others. Given this fact, it makes sense to train it\n\nSam Harris\n\nWhen I was younger, I didn't believe in brainwashing. I though to myself, How could anyone be that stupid. And then I moved to America, and realized I was living amongst a populace that widely defended capitalism, yet none of them had any capital.\n\nKeith Richards\n\nIn the rush to return to normal, use this tim to consider which parts of normal are worth rushing back to.\n\nDave Hollis\n\nI too am untranslatable, I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\n\nWalt Whitman\n\nNormal is not something to aspire to, it's something to get away from.\n\nJodie Foster\n\nIt is so high and so wide and so vast and so deep and goes around so many kinds of corners.\n\nUnknown\n\nYou will lose everything. Your money, your power, your fame, your success, perhaps even your memories. Your looks will go. Loved ones will die. Your body will fall apart. Everything that seems permanent is impermanent and will be smashed. Experience will gradually, or not so gradually, strip away everything that it can strip away. Waking up means facing this reality with open eyes and no longer turning away.\n\nBut right now, we stand on sacred and holy ground, for that which will be lost has not yet been lost, and realizing this is the key to unspeakable joy. Whoever or whatever is in your life right now has not yet been taken away from you. This may sound trivial, obvious, like nothing, but really it is the key to everything, the why and how and wherefore of existence. Impermanence has already rendered everything and everyone around you so deeply holy and significant and worthy of your heartbreaking gratitude.\n\nLoss has already transfigured your life into an altar.\n\nJeff Foster\n\nThe heart is just the heart; thoughts and feelings are just thoughts and feelings. Let things be just as they are.\n\nAjahn Chah\n\nIf more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien\n\n人虽有南北，佛性本无南北。 -慧能\n\nAlthough people have north and south, Buddha nature has no north or south.\n\nHuineng\n\nWe have to cultivate contentment with what we have. We really don't need much. When you know this, the mind settles down. Cultivate generosity. Delight in giving. Learn to live lightly. In this way, we can begin to transform what is negative into what is positive. This is how we start to grow up.\n\nTenzin Palmo\n\nSo, friends, every day do something that won't compute\n\nGive your approval to all you cannot understand\n\nAsk the questions that have no answers.\n\nInvest in the millennium. Plant sequoias.\n\nSay that your main crop is the forest that you did not plant,\n\nthat you will not live to harvest.\n\nSay that the leaves are harvested when they have rotted into the mold.\n\nCall that profit. Prophesy such returns.\n\nPut your faith in the two inches of humus that will build\n\nunder the trees every thousand years.\n\nListen to carrion--put your ear close,\n\nand hear the faint chattering of the songs that are to come.\n\nExpect the end of the world.\n\nLaugh. Laughter is immeasurable.\n\nBe joyful though you have considered all the facts.\n\nSo long as women do not go cheap\n\nfor power, please women more than men\n\nSwear allegiance to what is nighest your thoughts.\n\nBe like the fox who makes more tracks than necessary,\n\nsome in the wrong direction.\n\nPractice resurrection.\n\nWendell Berry, Manifesto, edited\n\nHope remains only in the most difficult task of all: to reconsider everything from the ground up, so as to shape a living society inside a dying society.\n\nAlbert Camus\n\nAs a species, we immediately forget what is lost and only see what exists right here, right now as the new normal. Every generation is experiencing huge shifts in what passes for a natural system. These changes have become more extreme over the last few generations. What we see as dead landscapes, our kids will see as natural and normal. There is a phrase for this and most of us these days suffer from it. Its called Shifting Baseline Syndrome.\n\nGenerational amnesia is when knowledge is not passed down from generation to generation. For example, people may think of as pristine wilderness, the wild places that they experienced during their childhood, but with every generation this baseline becomes more and more degraded.\n\nDr. E.J. Milner-Gullan\n\nWith most men, unbelief in one thing springs from blind belief in another.\n\nGeorg Christoph Lichtenberg\n\nThere was no point in seeking to convert the intellectuals. For intellectuals would never be converted and would anyway always yield to the stronger, and this will always be the man in the street. Arguments must therefore be crude, clear and forcible, and appeal to emotions and instincts, not the intellect. Truth was unimportant and entirely subordinate to tactics and psychology.\n\nHugh Trevor Roper, summarizing Joseph Goebbels thinking\n\nCertainly witchcraft has very little to do with magic as people generally understand it. It has an awful lot to do with taking responsibility for yourself and taking responsibility also for the less able people and, up to a certain point, guarding your society. This is based on how witchcraft really was, I suspect. The witch was the village herbalist, the midwife, the person who knew things. She would sit up with the dying, lay out the corpses, deliver the newborn. Witches tended to be needed when human beings were meeting the dangerous edges of their lives, the places where there is no map. They don't mess around with tinkly spells; they get their hands dirty.\n\nTerry Pratchett\n\nThe power and majesty of nature in all its aspects is lost on one who contemplates it merely in the detail of its parts and not as a whole.\n\nPliny the Elder\n\nThe best investment for one year is to grow grains; the best investment for ten years is to grow trees; the best investment for a lifetime is to educate people.\n\nGuan Zong. A version is attributed to Kongzi.\n\nGrief is just love with no place to go.\n\nJamie Anderson\n\nWhen youre accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.\n\nUnknown\n\nFear is a far more dominant force in human behavior than euphoria.\n\nAlan Greenspan\n\nAll of our food comes from soil. So, when we begin to destroy the biology of the soil we destroy the food networks that give us life.\n\nPaul Stamets\n\nI used to dislike being sensitive. I thought it made me weak. But take away that single trait and you take away the very essence of who I am. You take away my conscience, my ability to empathize, my intuition, my creativity, my deep appreciation of the little things, my vivid inner life, my keen awareness for others pain and my passion for it all.\n\nCaitlin Japa\n\nDo yall remember, before the internet, that people thought the cause of stupidity was the lack of access to information? Yeah. It wasn't that.\n\nBamaLu\n\nHe suffers more than necessary who suffers before it is necessary.\n\nSeneca\n\nPerfer et obdura, dolor hic tibi proderit olim.\n\nBe patient and tough. Some day this pain will be useful to you.\n\nOvid\n\nWhen things arent adding up in your life, start subtracting.\n\nRichard Feynman\n\nIt is the most terrible and effective thing you, as a helper, can dostop helping. If I had one regret it would be that I enabled him. I allowed him to not feel the consequences and robbed him of the opportunity to build his self-esteem through addressing his mistakes himself.\n\nAdria Lopour\n\nWe have become a Nazi monster in the eyes of the whole worlda nation of bullies and bastards who would rather kill than live peacefully. We are not just Whores for power and oil, but killer whores with hate and fear in our hearts. We are human scum, and that is how history will judge us. . . . No redeeming social value. Just whores. Get out of our way, or well kill you.\n\nHunter S. Thompson\n\nDiscontent is a flame and one suppresses it by childish acts, by momentary satisfactions; but discontent when you let it flower, arise, it burns away everything that is not true.\n\nJiddu Krishnamurti\n\nA population may be too crowded, though all be amply supplied with food and raiment. It is not good for man to be kept perforce at all times in the presence of his species.\n\nJohn Stuart Mill\n\nThe biggest danger is not inaction. The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR.\n\nGreta Thunberg\n\nDisobedience, in the eyes of anyone who has read history, is humanity's original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience and through rebellion.\n\nOscar Wilde\n\nNo is a necessary magic. No draws a circle around you with chalk and says\n\nI have given enough.\n\nMckayla Robbin, Boundaries\n\nThe emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable, and it cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference.\n\nGeorge Henry Lewes, 1875\n\nThe output of a complex probabilistic system (such as a society) is a function of a self regulating, self organizing organization in which regulatory power is not vested in a controller but in the structure of that organization itself.\n\nStafford Beer\n\nIt is terribly important to appreciate that some things remain obscure to the bitter end.\n\nStafford Beer\n\nRelation is the stuff of system.\n\nStafford Beer\n\nA lie doesn't become truth, wrong doesn't become right, and evil doesn't become good, just because it's accepted by a majority.\n\nBooker T. Washington\n\nWhen a flower doesnt bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.\n\nAlexander Den Heijer\n\nIf you live for people's acceptance, you'll die from their rejection.\n\nLecrae Moore\n\nThe essence of capitalism is to turn nature into commodities and commodities into capital. The live green earth is transformed into dead gold bricks, with luxury items for the few and toxic slag heaps for the many. The glittering mansion overlooks a vast sprawl of shanty towns, wherein a desperate, demoralized humanity is kept in line with drugs, television, and armed force.\n\nMichael Parenti\n\nThe less you think, the more people agree with you.\n\nMontesquieu\n\nThe most important decision you make is to be in a good mood.\n\nVoltaire\n\nTo see we must forget the name of the thing we are looking at.\n\nClaude Monet\n\nIt's a little weird that I'm getting an award for being nice and generous and kind... which is what we're all supposed to do for one another. Thats the point of being human.\n\nEllen Degeneres\n\nThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those that speak it.\n\nGeorge Orwell\n\nInstead of buying your children all the things you never had, you should teach them all the things you were never taught. Material wears out but knowledge stays.\n\nBruce Lee\n\nTeaching is the essential profession, the one that makes all other professions possible.\n\nDavid Haselkorn\n\nIt takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, but even more to stand up to your friends.\n\nJ. K. Rowling\n\nI find that a great part of the information I have was acquired by looking up something and finding something else on the way.\n\nFranklin P. Adams\n\nAfter all is said and done, a lot more will be said than done.\n\nUnknown\n\nLight thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it.\n\nTerry Pratchett\n\nBeware of overconcern for money, or position, or glory. Someday you will meet a man who cares for none of these things. Then you will know how poor you are.\n\nRudyard Kipling\n\nThe saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.\n\nIsaac Asimov\n\nThere's no way I can single-handedly save the world or, perhaps, even make a perceptible difference - but how ashamed I would be to let a day pass without making one more effort.\n\nIsaac Asimov\n\nThe child who is not embraced by the village will burn that village down to feel its warmth.\n\nAfrican proverb\n\nThere was a farmer who grew excellent quality corn. Every year he won the award for the best grown corn. One year a newspaper reporter interviewed him and learned something interesting about how he grew it. The reporter discovered that the farmer shared his seed corn with his neighbors. How can you afford to share your best seed corn with your neighbors when they are entering corn in competition with yours each year? the reporter asked.\n\nWhy sir, said the farmer, Didnt you know? The wind picks up pollen from the ripening corn and swirls it from field to field. If my neighbors grow inferior corn, cross-pollination will steadily degrade the quality of my corn. If I am to grow good corn, I must help my neighbors grow good corn.\n\nUnknown\n\nThe loneliest moment in someones life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nEvery miserable fool who has nothing at all of which he can be proud, adopts as a last resource pride in the nation to which he belongs; he is ready and happy to defend all its faults and follies tooth and nail, thus reimbursing himself for his own inferiority.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer\n\nYou are in prison. If you wish to get out of prison, the first thing you must do is realize that you are in prison. If you think you are free, you cant escape.\n\nG.I. Gurdjieff\n\nThe Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command\n\nGeorge Orwell, 1984 (1949)\n\nJust remember, what youre seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening\n\nDonald Trump, 2018\n\nHuman history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.\n\nH. G. Wells\n\nThe world is governed more by appearances than realities, so that it is fully as necessary to seem to know something as to know it.\n\nDaniel Webster\n\nWhoever ceases to be a student has never been a student.\n\nGeorge Iles\n\nIt is manifest, therefore, that the jury must judge of and try the whole case, and every part and parcel of the case, free of any dictation or authority on the part of the government. They must judge of the existence of the law; of the true exposition of the law; of the justice of the law; and of the admissibility and weight of all the evidence offered; otherwise the government will have everything its own way; the jury will be mere puppets in the hands of the government; and the trial will be, in reality, a trial by the government, and not a trial by the country. By such trials the government will determine its own powers over the people, instead of the peoples determining their own liberties against the government; and it will be an entire delusion to talk, as for centuries we have done, of the trial by jury, as a palladium of liberty, or as any protection to the people against the oppression and tyranny of the government.\n\nLysander Spooner\n\nA hidden connection is stronger than an obvious one.\n\nHeraclitus\n\nFor every action there is an equal and opposite government program.\n\nBob Wells\n\nA mistake that makes you humble is better than an achievement that makes you arrogant.\n\nUnknown\n\nWhen you ask a question it makes you look stupid for 5 minutes - but if you don't ask - you stay stupid forever.\n\nSir Isaac Newton\n\nBefore a war military science seems a real science, like astronomy; but after a war it seems more like astrology.\n\nRebecca West\n\nWhen one admits that nothing is certain one must, I think, also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others.\n\nBertrand Russell\n\nNo one has to teach people how to pursue happiness. Unless impeded, people form communities that allow them to get the most satisfaction from the material resources they have. Unless impeded, they enforce norms of safety that they find adequate. Unless impeded, they develop norms of self-respect that are satisfying and realistic for the members of that community. Unless impeded, people engage in activities that they find to be intrinsically rewarding, and they know (without being taught) how to invest uninteresting activities with intrinsic rewards.\n\nCharles Murray\n\nLets assume that there are no oughts or shoulds in this universe. There is only what *is*the totality of actual (and possible) facts. Among the myriad things that exist are conscious minds, susceptible to a vast range of actual (and possible) experiences. Unfortunately, many experiences suck. And they dont just suck as a matter of cultural convention or personal biasthey really and truly suck. (If you doubt this, place your hand on a hot stove and report back.) If we *should* to do anything in this life, we should avoid what really and truly sucks. (If you consider this question-begging, consult your stove, as above.)\n\nSam Harris (2018)\n\nThe wilderness holds answers to questions man has not yet learned to ask.\n\nNancy Newhall\n\nA poem is no place for an idea.\n\nEdgar Watson Howe\n\nNo matter how cynical you get, it is impossible to keep up.\n\nLily Tomlin\n\nThese are the final days, this is the darkness, this is the flood. The catastrophe has already happened and the question we now face is: what is the appropriate behavior in a catastrophe?\n\nLeonard Cohen\n\nIm almost alive, Im almost at home,\n\nNo one to follow, and nothing to teach,\n\nExcept that the goal falls short of the reach.\n\nLeonard Cohen\n\nThere was a young man\n\nFrom Cork who got limericks\n\nAnd haikus confused\n\nUnknown\n\nThe scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.\n\nNikola Tesla\n\nThe first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the men he has around him.\n\nNiccolò Machiavelli.\n\nArmaments, universal debt, and planned obsolescence those are the three pillars of Western prosperity. If war, waste, and moneylenders were abolished, you'd collapse. And while you people are overconsuming the rest of the world sinks more and more deeply into chronic disaster. Ignorance, militarism and breeding, these threeand the greatest of these is breeding. No hope, not the slightest possibility, of solving the economic problem until that's under control. As population rushes up, prosperity goes down.\n\nAldous Huxley, Island, 1962.\n\nDifficult things provoke all your irritations and bring your habitual patterns to the surface. And that becomes the moment of truth. You have the choice to launch into your lousy habitual patterns, or to stay with the rawness and discomfort of the situation and let it transform you.\n\nPema Chodron\n\nThe propagandist's purpose is to make one set of people forget that certain other sets of people are human.\n\nAldous Huxley\n\nI don't trust anyone whos nice to me but rude to the waiter. Because they would treat me the same way if I were in that position.\n\nMuhammed Ali\n\nIt's an universal law intolerance is the first sign of an inadequate education. An ill-educated person behaves with arrogant impatience, whereas truly profound education breeds humility.\n\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn\n\nYou are perfect exactly as you are (and you could use a little work);\n\nSuzuki Roshi\n\nActually, its only existentialism if it comes from the existentialism region of France. Otherwise its just sparkling anxiety.\n\nAaron Paul Sullivan\n\nThe gods that we've made are exactly the gods you'd expect to be made by a species that's about half a chromosome away from being chimpanzee.\n\nChristopher Hitchens\n\nThese kids don't have a little brother working in the coal mine, they don't have a little sister coughing her lungs out in the looms of the big mill towns of the Northeast. Why? Because we organized; we broke the back of the sweatshops in this country; we have child labor laws. Those were not benevolent gifts from enlightened management. They were fought for, they were bled for, they were died for by working people, by people like us. Kids ought to know that. No root, no fruit.\n\nUtah Phillips\n\nSociety is collapsing, and people are starting to realize that the reason they feel like theyre mentally ill is that theyre living in a system thats not designed to suit the human spirit.\n\nRussell Brand (incorrectly attributed to Jim Carrey)\n\nBeing wrong isnt a bad thing like they teach you in school. Its an opportunity to learn something.\n\nRichard Feynman\n\nIn a rich mans house there is no place to spit but his face.\n\nDiogenes\n\nTo be normal is the ultimate aim of the unsuccessful.\n\nCarl Jung\n\nA man should understand he doesnt protect his woman because she is weak. He protects here because she is important.\n\nUnknown\n\nWhen you find yourself in a room surrounded by your enemies, you should tell yourself I am not locked in here with you, you are locked in here with me. This is the kind of mindset you should have if you want to succeed in life. Get rid of that victim mentality.\n\nBruce Lee\n\nA strong nation, like a strong person, can afford to be gentle, firm, thoughtful, and restrained. It can afford to extend a helping hand to others. It is a weak nation, like a weak person, that must behave with bluster and boasting and rashness and other signs of insecurity.\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nBut woe awaits a country when\n\nShe sees the tears of bearded men.\n\nWalter Scott\n\nThe masses have never thirsted after truth. They turn aside from evidence that is not to their taste, preferring to deify error, if error seduce them. Whoever can supply them with illusions is easily their master; whoever attempts to destroy their illusions is always their victim.\n\nGustave Le Bon\n\nPick a lane, Grandpa. We are all collectively stuck doing 35 mph behind your whole generation while you drive in the left lane with your blinker on for 50 years.\n\nUnknown commentator to Joe Biden as a moderate Democrat.\n\nI'm glad I didn't have to fight in any war. I'm glad I didn't have to pick up a gun. I'm glad I didn't get killed or kill somebody. I hope my kids enjoy the same lack of manhood.\n\nTom Hanks\n\nWhen a man is wrapped up in himself, he makes a pretty small package.\n\nJohn Ruskin\n\nThe one who plants trees, knowing that he will never sit in their shade, has at least started to understand the meaning of life.\n\nRabindranath Tagore\n\nMan is quite insane. He wouldn't know how to create a maggot, and he creates Gods by the dozen.\n\nMichel de Montaigne\n\nLife is like stepping onto a boat which is about to sail out to sea and sink.\n\nShunryu Suzuki\n\nThere is no such thing as an underestimate of average intelligence.\n\nHenry Adams\n\nAlways in the big woods when you leave familiar ground and step off alone into a new place there will be, along with the feelings of curiosity and excitement, a little nagging of dread. It is the ancient fear of the Unknown, and it is your first bond with the wilderness you are going into.\n\nWendell Berry\n\nNobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American people.\n\nH. L. Mencken (attr.)\n\nAfter two years in Washington, I often long for the realism and sincerity of Hollywood.\n\nFred Thompson\n\nI have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when you looked at it in the right way, did not become still more complicated.\n\nPoul Anderson\n\nA taste for irony has kept more hearts from breaking than a sense of humor, for it takes irony to appreciate the joke which is on oneself.\n\nJessamyn West\n\nWe can spend our whole lives escaping from the monsters of our minds.\n\nPema Chödrön\n\nThe root of all our problems right now is the fact that human minds are very hackable with enough resources, combined with the fact that war, oppression, exploitation and ecocide are highly profitable. This dynamic has caused human collective consciousness to generally dead-end into a kind of propagandized, zombified state in which all our knowledge and all our thinking moves in alignment with the agendas of existing power structures. Its much easier to continue believing the official narratives than to sort through everything youve been told about your society, your nation and your world since grade school and work out whats true and whats false. Many dont have the time. Many more dont have the courage.\n\nCaitlin Johnstone\n\nWhat some call health, if purchased by perpetual anxiety about diet, isn't much better than tedious disease.\n\nGeorge Dennison Prentice\n\nLove is an exploding cigar we willingly smoke.\n\nLynda Barry\n\nRead, every day, something no one else is reading. Think, every day, something no one else is thinking. Do, every day, something no one else would be silly enough to do. It is bad for the mind to be always part of unanimity.\n\nChristopher Morley\n\nExcitement is ecstatic, passion places bets\n\nGracefully he bows to ovations that he gets\n\nBut the hands that are applauding are slippery with sweat\n\nAnd saliva is falling from their smiles\n\nPhil Ochs, Crucifiction\n\nJust keep in mind: the more we value things outside our control, the less control we have.\n\nEpictetus\n\nHard times create strong men, Strong men create good times, Good times create weak men, And, weak men create hard times.\n\nG. Michael Hopf, Those Who Remain\n\nWhen law and morality contradict each other, the citizen has the cruel alternative of either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law.\n\nFrédéric Bastiat, The Law\n\nOf all the dangers we face, from climate chaos to nuclear war, none is so great as the deadening of our response.\n\nJoanna Macy\n\nThe most urgent necessity is, not that the State should teach, but that it should allow education. All monopolies are detestable, but the worst of all is the monopoly of education.\n\nFrédéric Bastiat, What Is Money?\n\nI often think that the night is more alive and more richly colored than the day.\n\nVincent Van Gogh\n\nOs solos contam histórias que os céus há muito tempo esqueceram.\n\nThe soils tell stories that the heavens have long forgotten.\n\nJoão L R Abegão\n\nWhat man can you show me who places any value on his time, who reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years lie behind us are in deaths hands.\n\nSeneca\n\nThe price of liberty is eternal vigilance.\n\nThomas Charlton, 1809.\n\nEternal vigilance is the price of liberty; power is ever stealing from the many to the few. The manna of popular liberty must be gathered each day or it is rotten. The living sap of today outgrows the dead rind of yesterday. The hand entrusted with power becomes, either from human depravity or esprit de corps, the necessary enemy of the people. Only by continued oversight can the democrat in office be prevented from hardening into a despot; only by unintermitted agitation can a people be sufficiently awake to principle not to let liberty be smothered in material prosperity.\n\nWendell Phillips, 1852\n\nWe're developing a new citizenry. One that will be very selective about cereals and automobiles, but won't be able to think.\n\nRod Serling\n\nAs nights went on and nothing happened and the phenomenon slowly faded to the accustomed deeper violets again, most had difficulty remembering the earlier rise of heart, the sense of overture and possibility and went back once again to seeking only orgasm, hallucination, stupor, sleep, to fetch them through the night and prepare them against the day.\n\nThomas Pynchon\n\nLife's single lesson: that there is more accident to it than a man can ever admit to in a lifetime and stay sane.\n\nThomas Pynchon, V\n\n'No matter how the official narrative of this turns out,' it seemed to Heidi, 'these are the places we should be looking, not in newspapers or television but at the margins, graffiti, uncontrolled utterances, bad dreamers who sleep in public and scream in their sleep.'\n\nThomas Pynchon, Bleeding Edge\n\nHomo sapiens is the species that invents symbols in which to invest passion and authority, then forgets that symbols are inventions.\n\nJoyce Carol Oates\n\nWe are made of all those who have built and broken us.\n\nAtticus\n\nInadequacy requires a higher energy expenditure than proficiency.\n\nHumans 3.2\n\nI like the scientific spiritthe holding off, the being sure but not too sure, the willingness to surrender ideas when the evidence is against them: this is ultimately fineit always keeps the way beyond openalways gives life, thought, affection, the whole man, a chance to try over again after a mistakeafter a wrong guess.\n\nWalt Whitman\n\nChoose the words you don't speak as wisely as you can.\n\nI fucking love Chaos Magick\n\nPeople seem to enjoy things more when they know a lot of other people have been left out of the pleasure.\n\nRussell Baker\n\nYou can only be young once. But you can always be immature.\n\nDave Barry\n\nWe are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw\n\nWe carry the torch for more than we know, perhaps for more than we can ever know.\n\nH. J. Berrill\n\nYou know, when we first set up WWF, our objective was to save endangered species from extinction. But we have failed completely; we havent managed to save a single one. If only we had put all that money into condoms, we might have done some good.\n\nSir Peter Scott, founder of WWF (lived 1909  1989)\n\nDon't plant your bad days. They grow into weeks. The weeks grow into months. Before you know it you got yourself a bad year. Take it from me: choke those little bad days. Choke em down to nothing.\n\nTom Waits\n\nHave the courage to go first. And then light a fire so your tribe can find you.\n\nUnknown\n\nWe cannot force someone to hear a message they are not ready to receive, but we must never underestimate the power of planting a seed.\n\nUnknown\n\nMaybe thats enlightenment enough: to know that there is no final resting place of the mind; no moment of smug clarity. Perhaps wisdom...is realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have yet to go.\n\nAnthony Bourdain\n\nThe problem with todays world is that everyone believes they have the right to express their opinion AND have others listen to it. The correct statement of individual rights is that everyone has the right to an opinion, but crucially, that opinion can be roundly ignored and even made fun of, particularly if it is demonstrably nonsense!\n\nBrian Cox\n\nZazen isn't about blissing out or going into an alpha brainwave trance. It's about facing who and what you really are, in every single goddamn moment. And you aren't bliss, I'll tell you that right now. You're a mess. We all are.\n\nBrad Warner\n\nWhy should things be easy to understand?\n\nThomas Pynchon\n\nWhen my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me-it still sometimes happens-and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl. But, the great thing is that when we were together, for nearly twenty years, we lived with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is. We never trivialized the meaning of death by pretending it was anything other than a final parting. Every single moment that we were alive and we were together was miraculous-not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. We knew we were beneficiaries of chance. . . . That pure chance could be so generous and so kind. . . . That we could find each other, as Carl wrote so beautifully in Cosmos, you know, in the vastness of space and the immensity of time. . . . That we could be together for twenty years. That is something which sustains me and its much more meaningful. . . . The way he treated me and the way I treated him, the way we took care of each other and our family, while he lived. That is so much more important than the idea I will see him someday. I don't think I'll ever see Carl again. But I saw him. We saw each other. We found each other in the cosmos, and that was wonderful.\n\nAnn Druyan\n\nTake boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\nTerry Pratchett\n\nWhy do they say we're over the hill? I don't even know what that means and why it's a bad thing. When I go hiking and I get over the hill, that means I'm past the hard part and there's a snack in my future.\n\nEllen Degeneres\n\nThe road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began No far ahead the road has gone, and I must follow it if I can,\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkein\n\nTheres no question about it: The corporate conservatives and their allies in the political and religious right are achieving a vast transformation of American life that only they understand because they are its advocates, its architects, and its beneficiaries. In creating the greatest economic inequality in the advanced world, they have saddled our nation, our states, and our cities and counties with structural deficits that will last until our childrens children are ready for retirement and they are systematically stripping government of all its functions except rewarding the rich and waging war.\n\nBill Moyers\n\nDear America: You are waking up, as Germany once did, to the awareness that 1/3 of your people would kill another 1/3, while 1/3 watches.\n\nWerner Herzog\n\nThe larger loneliness of our lives evolves from our unwillingness to spend ourselves, stir ourselves. We are always damping down our inner weather, permitting ourselves the comforts of postponement, of rehearsals.\n\nCarol Shields\n\nWe all have two lives. The second one begins when you realize you only have one.\n\nTom Hiddleston\n\nThe sheep will spend its entire life fearing the wolf, only to be eaten by the shepherd.\n\nUnknown\n\nEverybody that went away suffered a broken heart. \"I'm coming back some day,\" they all wrote.

The same applies when you are stupid.\n\nPhilippe Geluck\n\nIt is better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war.\n\nUnknown, quoted by Bruce Lee\n\nCourage is knowing it might hurt and doing it anyway. Stupidity is the same. And thats why life is hard.\n\nJeremy Goldberg\n\nRespecting human rights is more important than respecting cultures in my opinion, humans have rights, cultures and beliefs don't.\n\nFaisal Saeed Al Mutar\n\nThe attitude of thats just how I am, take it or leave it is still a sign of immaturity. As an adult, its your responsibility to figure out which of your traits are toxic and are negatively impactful towards other people and the ones you love and to eventually learn how to fix them. At some point, we all gotta start making ourselves better individuals. If you truly believe you dont have to change anything yourself, even at the very least the worst in you, and that people will just have to deal with it, then sorry youre still a child.\n\nMark Manson\n\nI'm not arguing that there are no decent people in the Tory Party. But they're like bits of sweetcorn in a turd; technically they have kept their integrity, but they are still embedded in shit.\n\nIan Banks\n\nYou dont have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.\n\nRay Bradbury\n\nOur environmental problems originate in the hubris of imagining ourselves as the central nervous system or the brain of nature. We're not the brain, we are a cancer on nature.\n\nDave Foreman\n\nDo something. Pay your rent for the privilege of living on this beautiful, blue-green living Earth.\n\nDave Foreman\n\nThe way we see the world shapes the way we treat it. If a mountain is a deity, not a pile of ore; if a river is one of the veins of the land, not potential irrigation water; if a forest is a sacred grove, not timber; if other species are biological kin, not resources; or if the planet is our mother, not an opportunity -- then we will treat each other with greater respect. Thus is the challenge, to look at the world from a different perspective.\n\nDavid Suzuki\n\nThe wind and waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators.\n\nEdward Gibbon\n\nAchilles absent was still Achilles.\n\nHomer\n\nThe blade itself incites to violence.\n\nHomer\n\nThe abuse of a thing is no argument against the use of it.\n\nJeremy Collier\n\nThat is gold which is worth gold.\n\nGeorge Herbert\n\nHow is it possible to expect that mankind will take advice, when they will not so much as take warning?\n\nJonathan Swift\n\nHe who acts through another does the act himself.

Huxley\n\nTheres brains enough outside his head.\n\nScottish proverb\n\nIt is a great art to know how to sell wind.\n\nBaltasar Gracian\n\nWe have witnessed in modern business the submergence of the individual within the organization, and yet the increase to an extraordinary degree of the power of the individual of the individual who happens to control the organization. Most men are individuals no longer so far as their business, its activities or its moralities, is concerned. They are not units, but fractions; with their =individuality and independence of choice in matters of\n\nbusiness they have lost also their individual choice within the field of morals. They must do what they are told to do, or lose their connection with modern affairs. They are not at liberty to ask whether what they are told to do is right or wrong. They cannot get at the men who ordered it have no access to them. They have no voice of counsel or of protest. They are mere cogs in a machine which has men for its parts. And yet there are men here and there with whom the whole choice lies. There are men who control the machine as a whole and the men who compose it. There are men who use it with an imperial freedom of design, whose power and whose individuality overtop whole communities. There is more individual power than ever, but those who exercise it are few and formidable, and the mass of men are mere pawns in the game.\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\nCannibals have the same notion of right and wrong that we have Eating fallen enemies is only an extra ceremonial. The wrong does not consist in roasting them, but in killing them.\n\nVoltaire\n\nThe alarming development and aggressiveness of great capitalists and corporations, unless checked, will inevitably lead to the pauperization and hopeless degradation of the toiling masses. It is imperative, if we desire to enjoy the full blessings of life, that a check be placed upon unjust accumulation, and the power for evil of aggregated wealth.\n\nKnights of Labor, 1869\n\nI am the Lord, I change not. (Explains much, like why he never grew up)\n\nMalachi III\n\nCharity sees the need, not the cause.\n\nGerman proverb\n\nChastity is a monkish and evangelical superstition, a greater foe to natural temperance even than unintellectual sensuality; it strikes at the root of all domestic happiness, and consigns more than half the human race to misery.\n\nP.B.

Which of us, in brief word, is to do the hard and dirty work for the rest, and for what pay? Who is to do the pleasant and clean work, and for what pay? And who is to do no work, and for what pay?\n\nJohn Ruskin\n\nHe commands enough that obeys a wise man.\n\nGeorge Herbert\n\nCommerce is entitled to a complete and efficient protection in all its legal rights, but the moment it presumes to control a country, or to substitute its fluctuating expedients for the high principles of natural justice that ought to lie at the root of every political system, it should be frowned on, and rebuked.\n\nJames Fenimore Cooper\n\nWhat millions died, that Caesar might be great!\n\nThomas Campbell\n\nThere is another man within me thats angry with me.\n\nThomas Browne\n\nConscience is, in most men, an anticipation of the opinions of others.\n\nHenry Taylor\n\nA good conscience pays badly.\n\nChinese proverb\n\nYour Constitution is all sail and no anchor.\n\nT.B.

How foolish he has been in his words and conversation, how seldom he has done well with judgment, and how often he has been kept from doing ill by accident; how seldom he has been able to please himself, and how often he has displeased others; how often he has changed his counsels, hated what he loved and loved what he hated; how often he has been enraged and transported at trifles, pleased and displeased with the very same things, and constantly changing from one vanity to another.

As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase.

Yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy\n\nFive years ago, if you remember, I should say you were pretty well convinced there was a God, and above all you had no doubt as to what was good and what was evil. Naturally you did what you thought was good and marched off to war. For five years now, the best years of your youth, you have kept on doing good: you have fired a gun, gone over the top, lounged about in barracks and mud holes, buried comrades or bandaged their wounds. And little by little you began to doubt the good, to suspect that the good and glorious occupation you were engaged in was fundamentally evil, or at the very least stupid and absurd.\n\nAnd so it was. Evidently the good you were so sure of at the time was not the right good, the good that is indestructible and timeless; and evidently the God you knew in those days was not the right God Hundreds of thousands of bloody battle sacrifices were offered up to him, and in his honor hundreds of thousands of bellies were slit open, hundreds of thousands of lungs torn to pieces; he was more bloodthirsty and brutal than any idol\n\nHas anyone stopped to consider, and to wonder at the fact, that in those four years of war our theologians buried their own religion, their own Christianity?

Breathe and allow things to pass.\n\nSylvester McNutt\n\nAn optimist isn't necessarily a blithe, slightly sappy whistler in the dark of our time. To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness. What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember those times and places -- and there are so many -- where people have behaved magnificently, this gives us the energy to act, and at least the possibility of sending this spinning top of a world in a different direction. And if we do act, in however small a way, we don't have to wait for some grand utopian future. The future is an infinite succession of presents, and to live now as we think human beings should live, in defiance of all that is bad around us, is itself a marvelous victory.\n\nHoward Zinn\n\nIm an atheist, and thats it.

And it is these ignorant people, the most uneducated, the most unimaginative, the most unthinking among us, who would make themselves the guides and leaders of us all; who would force their feeble and childish beliefs on us; who would invade our schools and libraries and homes.

Human beings are the only animals who have to work, and I think that is the most ridiculous thing in the world. Other animals make their livings by living, but people work like crazy, thinking that they have to in order to stay alive. The bigger the job, the greater the challenge, the more wonderful they think it is. It would be good to give up that way of thinking and live an easy, comfortable life with plenty of free time. I think that the way animals live in the tropics, stepping outside in the morning and evening to see if there is something to eat, and taking a long nap in the afternoon, must be a wonderful life. For human beings, a life of such simplicity would be possible if one worked to produce directly his daily necessities. In such a life, work is not work as people generally think of it, but simply doing what needs to be done.\n\nMasanobu Fukuoka, The One-Straw Revolution\n\nForget the noise, the crisis we face is not embodied in the public images of the politicians that run our dysfunctional state. The crisis we face is the result of a four decade long slow-motion corporate coup detat that has rendered the citizen impotent. Left us without any authentic democratic institutions and allowed corporate and military power to become omnipotent. The crisis has spawned a corrupt electoral system of legalized bribery and elevated public figures that master the arts of entertainment and artifice.\n\nChris Hedges, 2017\n\nI guess my favorite thing in the world is when I look at a piece of art, or read a story, or watch a movie where I walk away feeling like \"Oh my god  I have to do something, I have to make something or talk to someone  things are not the same anymore\"  and so I try to make work where you come away with that feeling. It's like, yeah, you're thinking about what you just saw, but even more than that  you feel able, you feel like, kind of propelled.\n\nMiranda July\n\nMemorial Day will be celebrated by the usual betrayal of the dead, by the hypocritical patriotism of the politicians and contractors preparing for more wars, more graves to receive more flowers on future Memorial Days.

You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\n\nJohn Ehrlichman\n\nI'll tell you what you did with Atheists for about 1500 years. You outlawed them from the universities or any teaching careers, besmirched their reputations, banned or burned their books or their writings of any kind, drove them into exile, humiliated them, seized their properties, arrested them for blasphemy. You de-humanised them with beatings and exquisite torture, gouged out their eyes, slit their tongues, stretched, crushed, or broke their limbs, tore off their breasts if they were women, crushed their scrotums if they were men, imprisoned them, stabbed them, disemboweled them, hanged them, burnt them alive.

It exists for the benefit of the social order. We have discovered as a species that it is useful to have an educated population. You do not need to be a student or have a child who is a student to benefit from public education. Every second of every day of your life, you benefit from public education. So let me explain why I like to pay taxes for schools, even though I don't personally have a kid in school: It's because I don't like living in a country with a bunch of stupid people.\n\nJohn Green\n\nThe war is not meant to be won, it is meant to be continuous. Hierarchical society is only possible on the basis of poverty and ignorance. This new version is the past and no different past can ever have existed. In principle the war effort is always planned to keep society on the brink of starvation. The war is waged by the ruling group against its own subjects and its object is not the victory over either Eurasia or East Asia, but to keep the very structure of society intact.\n\nGeorge Orwell\n\nThe war was not meant to be won, it was meant to be endless.\"\n\nGeorge Orwell, 1984\n\nIt is a basic human need that everyone wants to live a happy life. For this, one has to first experience real happiness. The so-called happiness that one experiences by having money, power, and indulging in sensual pleasures is not real happiness. It is very fragile, unstable and not lasting long. For real happiness, for real lasting stable happiness, one has to make a journey deep within oneself and see that one gets rid of all the unhappiness and misery stored in the deeper levels of the mind. So long as there is unhappiness and misery in the deeper levels of the mind and so long as unhappiness is being generated today this stored stock is being multiplied and all attempts to feel happy at the surface level of the mind prove futile.\n\nS.N.
