WIT 1LN EYES WIDE OPEN Recently I was asked to watch film material, parts of which I had seen once before on Channel 4 in the 1980s, images of a kind that I rather wished I didn’t have to see again: the footage shot by Allied soldiers as they liberated the death and slave-labour camps of Germany’s Third Reich. You might think such imagery is inescapable, indelible, that we’re all familiar, for instance, with the sequence of the British army bulldozer driver at Belsen having to shift a pile of emaciated cadavers, which then move uncannily as if they’ve come alive again - it’s shown in many films about the Holocaust. But what I’m referring to is less well-known material from the many camps that were documented after they were liberated. All such footage as could be found was gathered together towards the end of the war by Sidney Bernstein for a documentary that he did not complete - but which has recently been reconstructed by a team from the Imperial War Museum - called German Concentration Camps Factual Survey. The film had been intended primarily for the German population so they could be shown what had been done in their name. My reluctance to see the footage amounted to the following: I did not want either to experience the same emotions, or have the film’s original effect on me diminished by repetition, or worse, find that the images no longer affected me in the same way. Nor did I want to be returned to the origin of the feelings of hatred many of my generation felt towards that generation of Germans who perpetrated those crimes. But I did watch the footage again. It’s in Andre Singer’s new documentary Night Will Fall, which is about the making of Bernstein’s film and of the need for a visual record of acts of true horror. In the same week of the screening, gruesome images were everywhere in the media. Body bags were being flown back to Eindhoven from the Ukraine; one Palestinian child was reckoned to be dying every hour in Gaza. And - to be more trivial for a moment - it was not long after many British people had felt free enough from old enmities to celebrate the German victory in the World Cup. It was the same week, too, that we finished putting together this Documentary Poll issue. Among the top films are, of course, Shoah, Claude Lanzmann’s interview-based uncovering of what happened in the camps - which eschews the use of footage - and Night and Fog, Alain Resnais’s understated The mass burials in pits at Belsen are horrific to watch. But our best chance against such events being repeated is looking and understanding. You must look -you cannot not look chronological history, which relies on footage. Their presence demonstrates not only their monumental power as films, but also that approaches to reflecting on the unthinkable need not stick to one tack. Indeed, despite my squeamishness, I am not averse to artworks that challenge the inviolability of this imagery. Take, for instance, Jake and Dinos Chapman’s Hell series, diorama models that conflate Nazi crimes with barbarities from other times and from popular culture. They help us to see that the Holocaust is not the anomaly in human history that it should be, and that even that period of history can become a commodity - look how successful the morbid WWII sections of bookshops are. The same night I watched Night Will Fall, the BBC’s Newsnightbr oadcast a debate about the corporation’s practice of obscuring (or blobbing out) the faces of the injured and dead of a war zone. Later in the week, the Guardian published Roger Tooth’s article ‘Graphic content: when photographs of carnage are too upsetting to publish’, about the moral decisions picture editors have to make. “We wanted to show the readers the reality of life - and death - in Gaza, but we didn’t want to shock or unnecessarily upset them,” Tooth wrote. I sympathise with that, and responsible choices of images do need to be made, especially when there’s so much uncensored material available on the internet. But surely the one obvious lesson of the Israel-Palestine conflict is that anything you publish is bound to offend someone. For me, to show a swaddled injured baby while obscuring its head, as the BBC has been doing, is pointless. The Arts Council head Peter Bazalgette was right to question that practice on Newsnight. For the record, it’s the mass burials in pits at Belsen that I find most difficult to watch. But our best chance against such events being repeated is looking and understanding. You must look - you cannot not look. So please seek out Night Will Fall when it’s released in September. It will not make for a pleasant evening, but it is all about bearing witness to the fact that things like this really happened - and are happening still. And that’s part of what documentary is all about. © September 2014 | Sight&Sound | 5 Rushes NEWS AND VIEWS IN THE FRAME ENIGMA VARIATIONS Ein Film von Ni|oQp| I II FT Mit Jean-Pierre Leaud Jean-Luc Godardfder e/'n/ge I V I UOyU IJ I I Chantal Goya prazise Tatsachen uber die _/ ~ i*«j und Marlene Jobert Jugend und die Sexualitat it'/ I III III I Ein Programm im heutigen Frankreich be- Oder: die Kinder von der Neuen Filmkunst schreibt) Marx und Coca-Cola Walter Kirchner The children of Marx and Coca-Cola: Jean-Luc Godard’s Masculin Feminin (1966) From the 50s to the 70s, some of Europe’s greatest directors courted the German artist Hans Hillmann to make posters for their films By Isabel Stevens In the mid-1950s, West Germans frequenting Frankfurt and Kassel’s cinemas in the afternoon might have stumbled across graphic designer and illustrator Hans Hillmann sitting alone in an empty theatre next to a Rollei on a tripod. Newly graduated in graphic design, Hillmann had started creating posters for the fledgling distributor Neue Filmkunst (New Film Art). This was his research. Between 1953 and 1974 Hillmann, who died in May aged 88, designed 130 film posters. Most poster designers work from stills or publicity material; Hillmann meticulously studied the film, creating designs as radical as the cinema his posters advertised: a giant painted battle scene, comprising eight posters, for Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai-, a startling close-up of a hand reaching into a pocket for Bresson’s Pickpocket He enjoyed a long-running collaboration with Jean-Luc Godard, designing eight posters for his films’ German releases. You can even spy Hillmann’s posters in the background of Juliette Janson’s flat in Godard’s 2 or 3 Things I Know About Her- among them a design for Alain Resnais’s Muriel, a poster masquerading as a torn notebook, which Resnais commissioned directly from Hillmann. In 1969 Edgar Reitz (best known for Heimat), having seen Hillmann’s designs for Godard’s Une Femme est une femme and Carne’s Le Quai des brumes, asked him to do a poster for his second feature Cardillac. He recalls: “I had brought a selection of stills and was amazed that Hillmann showed no interest in the images of the actor, but tried talking to me, the author and director, to fathom the deeper motives of the film.” “The entire film was there in this picture,” Volker Schlondorff says of Hillmann’s design for his 1970 film The Sudden Fortune of the Poor People ofKombach, “but I was worried because I thought in its bleakness it might scare the audience away. His designs were uncompromising, radical and inspired, as were the movies in those days, alas gone by”. Hillmann described West Germany after World ON OUR RADAR Sci-fi: Days of Fear and Wonder The BFI’s nationwide sci-fi season (October- December) launches at the British Museum (28-30 August), with three British classics: Nic Roeg’s The Man Who Fell to Earth’ (right), Mike Hodges’s ‘Flash Gordon’ and Val Guest’s The Day the Earth Caught Fire’. Cambridge Film Festival Screenings of docudrama pioneer Lionel Rogosin’s ‘Come Back, Africa’ (right) and ‘On the Bowery’ are just two highlights of this year’s festival (28 August - 7 September), which also includes a strand dedicated to new German cinema. 6 | Sight&Sound September 2014 LISTOMANIA GREEK MYTH FILMS Vsevolod Pudovkin’s Storm over Asia (1928) War II, as “a cinematic desert”. There were no art theatres; the nearest film museum was in Paris. Neue Filmkunst, set up by film club enthusiasts Walter Kirchner and Wemer Schwier, tried to rectify that, introducing audiences to foreign films such as Mizoguchi’s UgetsuMonogatari, and rereleasing classics such as Pudovkin’s Storm over Asia. After photographing fragments of films, Hillmann would have a few weeks to gestate his designs, creating a series of postcard-size versions (“to compete with myself”) to show Kirchner. He had total freedom: “There were no prescriptions about motifs, unlike traditional film posters, where the distribution boss would say, ‘I’d rather have it in red.’” Faces often figure imaginatively - obscured by an explosion of paint (Marco Bellocchio’s In the Name of the Father), or composed of lots of tiny figures (Rene Allio’s Pierre and Paul). Only rarely are they actors’ faces. At first he followed the custom of isolating a representative image from the film. Distributors’ budgets limited him to monochrome letterpress designs, but he used such restrictions inventively. From the late 50s, screenprinting allowed him to use luminous colours and experiment with photography, creating more symbolic, layered posters. He never settled on one style. His designs often combined media, as in his chilling interpretation of Luis Bunuel’s 1955 Fritz Lang’s ‘M’ To mark the 50th anniversary of Peter Lorre’s death, Lang’s thriller (right), featuring the actor’s first major screen role, has been restored and is back on UK screens from 5 September. Meanwhile, a Lorre season runs at BFI Southbank, London from 2 September - 7 October. Robert Bresson’s Pickpocket (1959) tale of a wannabe serial killer, The Criminal Life ofArchihaldo de la Cruz- a photographed hand ripping through the poster to strangle a drawn neck of a victim: Hillmann called it “a murder on paper”. Many designs are self-reflexive, making the subject the medium of the poster or film itself - numerous posters resemble strips of celluloid. Berberian Sound Studio director Peter Strickland, a long-time admirer, describes Hillmann’s aesthetic as “often stubbornly minimal, enigmatic yet very direct in conveying a strong mood.” He continues: “Hillmann often incorporated found objects into his posters and lets them reveal, obscure, shatter or protrude through the surface. Leaves, glass and other detritus all combine to give an organically three-dimensional effect. These objects are not only there to provide texture, they’re also clues to the film. It’s as if Hillmann was let loose on the sets during the shoot and allowed to collect props or any material that was present. It’s a very active form of design, which ignites the imagination. He makes me look at films I already know differently.” © An exhibition of Hans Hillmann’s film posters will be on show from 21 August - 27 September at Kemistry Gallery, London. A programme of related films runs at London’s Goethe Institut and Cine Lumiere Elio Petri A season dedicated to one of the most unusual and overlooked Italian directors of the 60s and 70s runs at the ICA, London, from 5-11 September. It includes Petri’s most acclaimed feature, the crime drama ‘Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion’ (1970), but also provides the rare opportunity to see, among others, his lesser-known sci-fi gem The 10th Victim’ (1965) and the Mafia murder tale ‘We Still Kill the Old Way’ (1967).

September 2014 | Sight&Sound | 7 RUSHES OBJECT LESSON UNDER THE SKIN A medium that’s all about the flesh has found some peculiar uses for what’s underneath - make no bones about it By Hannah McGill Human skulls and skeletons are frequently cast as monsters. From childhood, the idea of the bones beneath our skin being exposed prompts a shudder that makes them a useful personification of all that we fear from death. But their aggressive manifestations - as the vengeful reanimated undead, or as an impactful brand icon for pirates and Hells Angels - is only one aspect of a symbolic function that has as much to do with frailty as ferociousness. Skeletons are only frightening because we are so close to being them, and because, stripped of what makes us recognisable and distinct, we appear so interchangeable. The memento mori, embraced in art, design and architecture with the rise of Christianity, cautions us not to attach too much importance to earthly trappings, including the flesh on our bones. Within a medium that specifically celebrates those things (“flesh impact” was Billy Wilder’s term for the particular screen presence of cinema’s most potent female sex symbols), bones seem to carry a particular chill. Even when not as horrifying as the wizened remains of Mrs Bates in Psycho (i960), they have relentless, impersonal and near-indestructible kinetic force, as in Jason and the Argonauts (1963), or the threatening, corrupting taint of ancient wisdom - a specific threat to Western order in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). Even animal bones will tend to suggest at best an unwholesome attachment to things past and dead, and at worst - as in The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) - a propensity for sadistic killing and grisly trophy-keeping. In 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), the repurposing of a bone as a weapon is a thrilling evolutionary leap, but also a shift away from primal innocence and towards the development of technology that will ultimately facilitate mass destruction. The dinosaur ‘intercostal clavicle’ featured in (and invented for) Bringing Up Baby (1938) triggers rather lighter forms of human conflict - although the threat of being killed and eaten does stalk several of the characters as a result of its misplacement. The fact that dithery palaeontologist David (Cary Grant) can’t find his bone, and that the sexually decisive Susan (Katharine Hepburn) eventually gives it back to him, has an interpretation that’s hard to miss - and that’s before we even throw in the fact that Susan keeps as her familiar an unmanageable, sharp-toothed pussycat with a tendency to eat everything it sees. David’s sexual identity comes into frequent question during the film (not least in the much-quoted scene in which he wears a negligee and declares himself to have gone “gay all of a sudden”). Hawks himself, in Joseph McBride’s Hawks on Hawks (1982), credits Grant A bone to pick: David (Cary Grant) and fiancee Alice (Virginia Walker) in Bringing Up Baby Bony was a warrior: Todd Armstrong and Ray Harryhausen’s skeleton crew in Jason and the Argonauts 8 | Sight&Sound September 2014 THE FIVE KEY... JEWEL THIEF FILMS with a particular facility for material in which his character cedes sexual dominance: “It’s pretty hard to think of anybody but Cary Grant in that type of stuff... Cary is such a great receiver.” But Hawks’s claim is that the feminisation of Grant was straightforwardly belittling - “Anything we could do to humiliate him, to put him down and let her sail blithely along, made it what I thought was funny” - ignores the film’s more subversive implication that David’s emasculation is a positive progression for him. The male protagonist only achieves his personal aims - and hence the film its narrative aims - via his acceptance of female power: romantic and sexual union requires submission to Susan and the disorder that she brings; professional security comes thanks to Susan’s aunt donating her money to the museum. Though David does get to complete the brontosaurus’s skeleton, its collapse at the film’s close indicates that his investment in the distant past, his finicky need for neat completion of things and his fussy guardianship of his ‘bone’ must all be left behind in favour of Susan’s ‘feminine’ disorganisation and breezy modernity. The idea of a man being divested of a bone by a woman calls up more 2001: A Space Odyssey Films are themselves made from the bones of dead things, since all photographic film contains gelatin than just Freudian imagery: it also has resonances with the creation of Eve, specifically referenced in the title of a later Katharine Hepburn vehicle, Adam’s Rib (i 949). “It will tickle your funny bone!” promised one of that film’s original taglines. Time was when one could have pulled all of this together, as neatly as a palaeontologist completing a skeleton, with the observation that films are themselves made from the bones of dead things, since all photographic film contains gelatin. As Nicole Shukin dramatically puts it in her study Animal Capital: Rendering Life in Biopolitical Times ( 2009), “The rise of cinematic culture was... literally - materially - contingent on mass slaughter.” The digital revolution renders this macabre detail somewhat retro, although the notion of cinema as a glorified by-product of the abattoir remains a perversely evocative one. © Common thieves steal money - uncommon thieves, more often than not, prefer something a little more glamorous By Michael Brooke In the cinema’s criminal hierarchy, jewel thieves are the natural aristocrats, running effortless rings around bank robbers or street muggers. Suave and sophisticated, combining natural athleticism with a thorough grasp of how to tame alarm systems, and often played by Cary Grant or David Niven: blatant criminality aside, what’s not to admire? Indeed, on my first Cannes visit in 1993,1 vividly recall being thrilled by news of a daring jewel robbery from a hotel safe, a shamefully amoral reaction that I blame squarely on the likes of Lubitsch and Hitchcock for making the process seem so sparklingly sexy. O To Catch a Thief is rereleased in UK cinemas on 8 August 2 To Catch a Thief (1955) One of Hitchcock’s most cheerfully upbeat films, set on the French Riviera, and featuring a neat twist on one of his perennial ‘wrong man’ scenarios - here, stripy-sweatered Cary Grant’s retired jewel thief is naturally the prime suspect following a spate of robberies with a familiar-seeming modus operandi But how can he convince Charles Vanel’s cynical inspector of his innocence? 4 The Pink Panther (1963) Originally conceived as a caper movie about a suave playboy thief (David Niven) in quest of the legendary pink diamond of the title, Blake Edwards’s film was comprehensively upstaged by supporting actor Peter Sellers (debuting as the hapless Inspector Clouseau) and Richard Williams’s iconic title animation - elements that were pushed much more to the fore in the film’s numerous sequels. 1 Trouble in Paradise (1932) Ernst Lubitsch’s effervescent comedy about two thieves (Herbert Marshall and Miriam Hopkins) joining forces romantically and professionally wasn’t made a moment too soon: Hollywood’s Production Code would take a very dim view of its seeming glorification of crime and its near-the-knuckle innuendo, although it’s precisely these elements that make the film seem so fresh and sprightly eight decades on. 3 Rififi (1955) Released the same year as To Catch a Thief, set in the same country but otherwise very different, Jules Dassin’s thriller is one of the ultimate crime procedurals. Its daring nocturnal jewel heist is depicted in such riveting detail that the BBFC’s John Trevelyan was nervous about passing it for British audiences, before realising that the required level of skill and equipment precluded casual imitation. 5 The Diamond Arm (1969) An all-time Soviet domestic blockbuster, whose dialogue recurs in popular catchphrases to this day, Leonid Gaidai’s Dayglo-coloured comedy is still pretty funny even for non-Russian speakers. The titular object is an allegedly broken arm whose plaster cast conceals illicit jewels - a smuggling method based on an actual incident, although the surrounding mistaken- identity farce was the film’s invention.

Saviano, then only 2 7, dared to lift the lid on a criminal organisation whose power and influence stretched far beyond his native Naples. The author paid for his courage with death threats and has been forced to live under police protection ever since. Despite this, he continues to be a vital presence in Italian cultural life, making regular appearances in print and on TV. He has also published a collection of essays, Beauty and the Inferno (2009), and another expose, this time of the cocaine trade - 201 3’s Zero Zero Zero. In 2008, Saviano and a group of five screenwriters (including director Matteo Garrone) adapted Gomorrah for the big screen, choosing to focus on five main stories from the book. But Saviano always felt that, constricted by a conventional theatrical running time, the film had barely scratched the surface. Only a series would be able to explore the subject in more depth. Taking inspiration from long-form US dramas such as The Sopranos and Breaking Bad, Saviano approached Stefano Sollima - the man behind another popular TV spin-off, Romanzo Criminate (2008-10) - to act as showrunner; the Rome-born filmmaker shares directing duties with Claudio Cupellini and Francesca Comencini. The TV version of Gomorrah centres on the fortunes of the Savastano crime family. In the first two episodes, we’re introduced to patriarch Don Pietro (Fortunato Cerlino), a powerful boss whose grey demeanour is less violent criminal and more steel-willed CEO (echoes of Gian Maria Volonte in Francesco Rosi’s 1973 film Lucky Luciano). With the help of enforcer Ciro Di Marzio (Marco D’Amore), Pietro plots against a rival clan led by the young, devout Salvatore Conte (Marco Palvetti) while attempting to blood his son Gennaro, aka ‘Genny’ (Salvatore Esposito) into the family business. Although he enjoys the lifestyle of the boss’s son, Genny doesn’t seem to have the stomach to take over from his father. “When I was 20 , 1 really had balls,” an exasperated Pietro tells his wife Donna Imma (Maria Pia Calzone), “I was always with my father, I observed, I understood -who the hell does Genny take after?” Early in the series, Pietro is arrested and jailed. The remaining episodes deal with the Savastano family’s continuing feud with Conte as well as their involvement in politics, property and drug trafficking. Most compelling however, is the power struggle at the heart of the family. With Pietro behind bars, who has what it takes to be boss - Imma or her son Genny? In his original book, Saviano dedicated a chapter to the role of women in Neapolitan organised crime: “The transformation of the Camorra in recent years has also meant a metamorphosis of the female’s role, which has Edge of darkness: Marco D’Amore as Ciro di Marzio i gone from that of a maternal figure and helper in times of misfortune to a serious manager who concerns herself almost exclusively with the business and financial end of things, delegating the fighting and illegal trafficking to others.” This is essentially what happens to Imma. She wastes very little time in taking the reins of the family, much to the indignation of Ciro, who pushes for the more easily manipulated Genny to take control. Imma is well aware of these Naples residents have criticised the show’s makers, tired of what they see as film and television’s unflattering depictions of life there Marco D’Amore and Salvatore Esposito the TV version of Gomorrah manoeuvres and separates the two, sending her son to Honduras to broker a major drug deal while dispatching Ciro to Spain to bargain with an exiled Conte. When Genny returns from Honduras, he has undergone a remarkable physical and mental transformation. Gone is the podgy, wavy-haired soft touch of the early episodes; the new Genny - leaner, meaner and sporting a Travis Bickle mohawk - is not going to let anyone stand in his way, not even his mother. As in the 2008 film, one of the main locations for Saviano’s series is the ‘Sails of Scampia’, a large housing complex located to the north of Naples. Many residents of Scampia and the surrounding area have criticised the show’s makers, growing tired of what they see as film and television’s continued unflattering depictions of life there, and in Naples more widely. In an interview with Francesco de Core for Neapolitan daily It Mattino in May, Saviano argued that just as Breaking Bad never suggests that everyone in Albuquerque is involved with drugs, his series in no way claims that everyone from Scampia has links with the Camorra. “ Gomorrah tells of the lives, the contradictions, the emotions and the ferocity of an area that is also so much more,” he says “but we focus on one significant element, one that the news has touched upon but quickly forgotten about.” © O Gomorrah runs on Sky Atlantic from 7 August September 2014 | Sight&Sound 1 11 produce starred up also available on blu-ray £10 VMMINOEISOHN RUPERT FRIEND STARRED UP ~\\u t ★ ★★★★ ★★★★★ ★★★★★ — ★★★★★ ★★★★★ THE ^ CHPlflCES “* MASTERCLASS IN SUSPENSE\" 8 LU? win «E»ER6E COMES HO M F blue ruin also available on blu-ray the toxic avenger also available on dvd £8 I rtywNwUwwWt wtyw 4 Ut_ £<*'•“ master of the world XpO DETROPIA suck it and see fopp stores buy your cds, dvds and books from fopp bristol college green // Cambridge Sidney st // - if they suck we’ll give you a swap or your lolly edinburgh rose st // glasgow union st & byres rd // This offer applies to all cds, dvds and books instore and is only available on production of a valid receipt dated no more than four london covent garden // manchester brown st // weeks from the time of your original purchase.

Maybe that is starting to change By Mark Cousins It’s great to see The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On and The House Is Black in Sight fr Sound’s poll of the greatest documentary films ever made. Hara Kazuo’s Japanese film about a righteous, vengeful former soldier and Forough Farokhzad’s portrait of an Iranian leper colony, though made in 1987 and 1962 respectively, are being seen more and discussed more. They’re on their way up. Twenty years ago they were far less well-known. Their appearance raises questions about how many other great nonfiction films there are that we in the West don’t know. For generations now, our documentary canon - the films we see, show, discuss and are influenced by - has been essentially Atlanticist. Once the fervour of Soviet innovation in documentary in the 20s abated, Britain, France, East Coast America and Canada in the 50s and 60s seemed to make the running. Free Cinema, Night and Fog, then cinema verite and Direct Cinema, Marcel Ophuls, the Maysles’ Salesman, Leacock, Grey Gardens, Jean Rouch, Agnes Varda, Chris Marker, Lanzmann, etc. They outdid and freed each other. We were dazzled. The Atlantic canon became a consensus. It had great characters or stories, or showed us how institutions work. The films were Aristotelian - unified in time and space. They benefited from the upside of the colonial imagination - a centrifugal desire to engage with elsewhere. It helped that they were in Latinate languages - mostly English or French. Compare this with what was happening with the fiction film canon in the West from the 1950s onwards, and a problem becomes clear. Thanks to go-betweens like the Venice Film Festival in the 50s, Pierre Rissient, American Japanophile Donald Richie and, later, people like critic Tony Rayns, we in the West belatedly saw the great Asian films of Ozu, Kurosawa, the Chinese directors of the 80s etc, and absorbed them into our sense of what cinema is. In contrast, documentary had fewer such bridge-builders between East and West. American filmmaker and film historian Jay Ley da went to the USSR and sang the praises of Esfir Shub et al (and the Soviet bloc had a missionary zeal, an export mentality), but there were not many like Ley da. There’s less money in the world of documentary so, if you were in Tokyo or Beijing, Seoul or Manila from the 1940s onwards, it was harder to invite Western guests to discover your non- fiction cinema. And the languages are trickier. Eventually, thank goodness, things improved. The wonderful Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival in Japan helped establish a Pacific canon - films from Japan, the Philippines, Korea, China. As a result, the documentaries of Ogawa Shinsuke, Tsuchimoto Noriaki and Hara Kazuo started to be shown in the West. American scholars like Abe Mark Nornes contextualised these Japanese films and we began to see that their patience or quietude or scale or disruptive energy were at least the equal of ‘our’ classics. We thought we invented the environmental film, but didn’t. The Pacific canon centred on groups more than individuals. The talking head appeared somewhat less. The pacing was slower. There was more of a balance between action and stasis than in much Western documentary. The Pacific canon has still a way to go in the West, but it’s getting there. And, of course, we need to subject our Western love of documentary to other incursions. The writing of Iranian- American scholar Hamid Naficy, for example, opens the way to what could be called the ‘exilic’ canon in documentary - films made by people who travel not because they have power (like Jean Rouch in Africa, for example), but because they haven’t. And Arabists need to speak more - and be heard more - about the landmarks of Egyptian, Moroccan, Syrian, Iraqi and Jordanian nonfiction cinema. If you haven’t seen the films of Omar Amiralay, for example, get googling. India is the major country whose fiction cinema is least understood by Western movie buffs, many of whom think that its cinema is a choice between Bollywood and Satyajit Ray (and they often haven’t even seen the classics of the former, such as Sholay). Alas, the same is true of Indian ‘But how do we see these films - the prints are in such bad shape?’ But if the films were more valued, they would be better preserved nonfiction cinema, which is also poorly known. Thankfully, Anand Patwardhan, one of the world’s great activist documentary filmmakers, is now getting more recognition in the West - though I’ve met many senior festival programmers who still haven’t heard of him - and Kashmiri director and teacher Mani Kaul’s docs are far less well- known. Every time I say this, someone pipes up with, “But how do we see these films - the prints are in such bad shape?” True, but it’s chicken and egg. If the films were more valued and in more demand, they would be better preserved. If we were more curious... if we considered these films ‘ours’ - cinema being borderless. So many ifs. You get my point: the documentary canon is even more wrong than the fiction film canon. Sight & Sound asked me to make a short film about this, a taster of which can be viewed at bfi.org.uk/sightandsound. When we began cutting it, I realised we were going to need a bigger boat, so I am now hoping to turn it into a perhaps three-hour postscript to my 1 5-hour The Story of Film: An Odyssey. This postscript will not be a straight history of documentary film, taking us through the Atlantic canon. I love those films, but have decided to leap-frog that canon to get to the rarer treasures. In order to show that my film isn’t a history of documentary, I’m calling it Dear John Grierson, and am imagining that I’m travelling the world on a train with Grierson, one of the founding fathers of the idea of documentary, to see the great films that we don’t, and should, know. The result, I hope, will be a micro-budget Snowpiercer, in which, as we look out the window, we see masterpieces by people with names like Pelechian, Honkasalo, Tsuchimoto, Kaul, Kotting, Leduc, Perlov, Lozinski... Names that are not household, but perhaps could be, if we loved movies more. © September 2014 | Sight&Sound 1 13 The Industry BUSINESS NEWS & OPINION DEVELOPMENT TALE HECTOR AND THE SEARCH FOR HAPPINESS Inquisitive old Hector: Simon Pegg travels the world to find what makes people happy How a Berlin-based producer, a Swedish writer and a British director took a globe-trotting French bestseller to London By Charles Gant Frangois Lelord had been practising medicine and psychology for the better part of two decades when his debut novel, Le Voyage d’Hectorou la Recherche du honheur, was published in his native France in 2002. The story, about a psychiatrist who goes off on a global search to discover what makes people happy, jumped off from Lelord’s earlier published work, nonfiction self-help books such as La Gestion du stress [Stress Management]. The novel did well in France, but even better in Germany, where it soon caught the attention of the film industry, including Wiltshire- born, Berlin-based producer Judy Tossell. “It was nine years ago,” she explains. “Hector and the Search for Happiness had just been published here. My business partner at the time gave it to me and said, ‘I think this could be a fantastic film.’ I thought, complicated, but also cinematic, and what a great character.” Despite interest from rival parties, Tossell was able to secure the film rights, and took the project to Warner Bros Germany for development financing. “We soon realised it was a lot harder to make a script out of it and make decisions about what kind of film it was going to be,” Tossell says. “The novel has a very particular tone of voice. It’s a little bit Little Prince-ish, but dealing with very adult issues. We went through a couple of screenwriters, and the author even had a bash at it himself. At that point we realised we would need to bring a director on board. We needed the filmmaker’s vision in terms of how much comedy, how serious, how are you going to adapt the voiceover. The novel is extremely episodic, more than the film could possibly get away with being, and we needed a much stronger backbone.” At this point, the Swedish writer-director Maria von Heland took over writing duties; she had previously worked on several Tossell productions, including Big Girls Don’t Cry (2002) and Hilde (2009). Tossell says, “She had the right sense of humour, coupled with a very good handle on characters and emotions, and with her we made a very basic decision to make the relationship between Hector and his girlfriend much more central to the story than it is in the novel.” Director Katja von Gamier ( Bandits , 1997) came on board, and continued developing the script with von Heland. However, says Tossell, “We just got to the point between us, where we thought, ‘OK we just haven’t quite cracked it.’ We decided to start from scratch again.” With new investment in her company, Tossell gained control of the rights from Warner Bros, which quit the project. The producer’s thoughts turned to British- born, Los Angeles-resident Peter Chelsom. “He had been on my list of directors for many films for many years. He always has that cheeky British sense of humour, but isn’t afraid to go for the jugular emotionally, and get that balance between emotional, sentimental and very funny.” Throughout the development, despite its German financing and Paris setting, the film had been envisaged as English language. Tossell explains: “This is a film that requires a certain budget because you are sending your character - whether he’s German, British or French - halfway around the world. And the people who he meets, the common language is going to be English. It would feel weird if he happened upon people who could speak German.” Chelsom, who has screenwriting credits on his two British features (Hear My Song, Funny 14 | Sight&Sound | September 2014 THE NUMBERS BOYHOOD Bones) but not on the five US films that followed (The Mighty, Town S Country, Serendipity, Shall We Dance and Hannah Montana : The Movie), then made another important decision. Working with co-writer Tinker Lindsay, the filmmaker began to wonder if the original Paris setting was more hindrance than help. “There was a lot of apology going on,” he says. “You have an English-speaking character. Did you have scenes in which he had French patients? Why wouldn’t he? Or did he specialise in British patients in Paris? It became a little contrived. I thought, let’s root it in London. It was also part of making it personal. I’m very Hector. People who know me see the film: ‘Oh my God, that’s you.’ It’s not a bad thing. Sometimes that’s what we do to make our work the most personal.” As Tossell and Canadian producer partners Christine Haebler and Trish Dolman sought financing for the film, Chelsom created a three- minute short, using his friend Mike Romo, who he’d previously cast in commercials, as his Hector, plus archive clips and animation. “I did it as a teaser and a sales tool, but more to find my way into the movie. If you looked at it now, you’d go, ‘Oh, it’s a trailer for the film.’ The look of it, the feel of it, it absolutely feels like the big film.” In the book and screenplay, Hector travels to far-flung destinations including China, Africa, California and Tibet, necessitating production spend at a certain level, and thus a cast of overall sufficient weight. The planets aligned after the film’s US casting directors happened to be at a dinner with Simon Pegg. Says Chelsom, “Hector’s an odd one. We did go to a couple of actors who This is a film that requires a certain budget because you are sending your character halfway around the world didn’t get it. Thank God they passed, because Simon so got it. It’s Chauncey Gardiner meets Monsieur Hulot meets Forrest Gump. It involves a Tintin-esque childlike curiosity, which Simon has in spades. I can’t see it working with anyone else.” With Pegg on board, the cast rounded out with Rosamund Pike, Toni Collette, Stellan Skarsgard, Jean Reno and Christopher Plummer. Says Chelsom, “The first dinner I had with Simon, I said: ‘There is a version of Hector that you and I could make like falling off a log, and we have to avoid that version of this movie.’ We know how to get laughs, we can do all that stuff, but we have to go deep, and we have to be real. “When everyone came on to Hector, almost without exception, they all came to rehearsal or audition slightly in the wrong comedy mode, where it’s being signalled a bit. I found myself saying time and time again, ‘No guys, please understand that the situations are bizarre enough without you doing anything bizarre.’ If you do that, then you do earn the darker moments. When you tell good actors they don’t have to try so hard to be funny, it’s a relief to them.” © O Hector and the Search for Happiness is released on August 15 and will be reviewed in our next issue By Charles Gant When Universal acquired international (non- US) rights to Richard Linklater’s Boyhood, the UK team could hardly look for great comfort from the director’s previous box-office track record in this country. Among his 14 previous theatrically released features, only one, School of Rock, had made it past the £1 million barrier, and many fell well short. As recently as April 2013, Bernie, starring Jack Black, managed just £96,000. On the other hand, critical response to Boyhood coming out of Sundance and Berlin could hardly have been more adulatory. “Our strategy was that this is a film that people need to see for themselves,” says Universal UK’s Dutch-born managing director Niels Swinkels. “It is an intriguing, unique concept.” The approach extended to the trailers, which in one version features the director and actors Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette speaking directly to camera about the making of the film - a movie- marketing tactic little glimpsed since the days of Alfred Hitchcock. Swinkels calls the unusual promo piece “a risk worth taking”. Swinkels insists his team wasn’t fazed by the filmmaker’s patchy commercial record, focusing instead on the potential of the acquired title. And Universal long ago settled on a July UK release date, as counter- programming to summer blockbuster fare. “It worked before with our films Senna and Moonrise Kingdom ,” he explains. “Also, the film has a very uplifting summer feel to it.” With negligible competition up against Boyhood in the arthouse space, the exhibition sector proved wildly enthusiastic. Unusually, the title featured in near-identical covers for the rival Curzon and Picturehouse magazines. If Boyhoods long running time (166 minutes) is a potential challenge for audiences, it’s definitely one for exhibition, since it’s not possible to programme two evening showtimes of it in a single screen. The Curzon Soho, which at press time was Boyhood's top-grossing cinema, responded Richard Linklater and Patricia Arquette on set by straddling it across two screens, filling in the gaps with other, shorter titles. Boyhood opened on a healthy £312,000 from 89 sites, plus £20,000 in previews: manna to indie cinemas that had been crying out for a decent hit since March’s The Grand Budapest Hotel. An expansion to 159 cinemas in week two helped buoy it to a second weekend of another £312,000 and a ten-day cumulative total of £898,000. So far, all the signs point to a significant multiple of the opening number. While awards season doesn’t officially get under way until the key autumn film festivals (Venice, Toronto, Telluride), and Universal has yet to launch any campaign, early prognosticators have already thrown Boyhood into the race, suggesting it as a film against which future contenders will be measured. No film premiering at Sundance has ever gone on to win the Best Picture Oscar, but it’s hard to argue with Swinkels that, “You can only imagine that when awards season opens properly, this is a film that won’t be easily forgotten.” © RICHARD LINKLATER AT THE UK BOX OFFICE Film Year Gross The School of Rock 2004 £10,498,228 A Scanner Darkly 2006 £995,867 Before Sunset 2004 £932,259 Boyhood 2014 £897,838* Before Midnight 2013 £844,423 Me and Orson Welles 2009 £497,878 Before Sunrise 1995 £463,477 Dazed and Confused 1994 £295,000 Tape 2002 £109,367 Bad News Bears 2005 £106,274 *Gross after 10 days September 2014 | Sight&Sound 1 15 Artificial Eye artificial-eye.com New Releases FABRICS LUCHINI LAMBERTWIISON tAf ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ tAr ^ tAr ‘BEAUTIFULLY PERFORMED- ACOMICTREAT “AN AMIABLE FRENCH BUDDY COMEDY ...WORTH A RIDE\" rvn lUAvi/iTU Roman Polanski Venus in Fur Agnes Jaoui Under the Rainbow Philippe Le Guay Cycling with Moliere Based on the Tony® award-winning play by David Ives and starring French screen icons Emmanuelle Seigner and Mathieu Amalric, Venus in Fur is a witty, intelligent and multi-layered examination of passion, perversion and the battle of the sexes from acclaimed director Roman Polanski.

THE INDUSTRY PLAYING TO THE AUDIENCE IN PRODUCTION BFI FILM FUND INSIGHTS Making films is one thing - getting the films to audiences outside London and the arthouse circuit is another By Ben Roberts Last night I saw Boyhood at my local cinema. A year ago this would have meant a one-minute walk to the Barbican, or a 1 5-minute walk to one of two cinemas in Islington or one of however many cinemas showing the film in the West End. Now that I’m an out-of-towner it involves a 30-minute drive to the Cineworld in Ashford, the only multi- screen cinema I can reach in less than an hour. A film on limited release, such as Boyhood, often may not reach us until after the first week, if at all. I’ll confess that when I saw that the film wasn’t playing Ashford on the opening weekend, I emailed friends at Universal, the UK distributor, and begged them to book it in. If that sounds like an indulgence, I can report that the screen was full - not bad for a near three-hour film on a Monday night. But that’s not surprising: the film is the critical hit of the summer at a time when screens are jammed with Transformers 4 and the like. Audiences for serious-minded cinema, or just good, interesting, different cinema, stretch far beyond the M2 5, to areas historically quite poorly served. Much ink has been spilt over cinema provision in the UK. Audience choice was a major focus of the Film Policy Review and it’s probably the most significant thread in the BFI’s Film Forever plan. In recent years, funding for independent cinemas has been scarce (limited largely to some Arts Council support, grant-in-aid funding from us for a handful of venues, and some Europa Cinemas money), and financial encouragement for independent distributors to take risks on wider releases is limited to some EU MEDIA programme money and Lottery P&A (prints and advertising funding distributed by us). Since the independent exhibitors have long considered themselves the black sheep of the sector, it’s no wonder that many of them grab at more mainstream programming when the opportunities arise. A couple of years ago, in response to the growing concern that audience development was really starting to suffer, the BFI, wearing its new hat as a Lottery distributor, devised certain interventions. The most ambitious of these is the BFI Film Audience Network, a UK-wide network of cinema clusters - including leading arts venues, rural and community venues and commercial cinemas - which extend outwards from Lottery- funded lead ‘hub’ organisations to create a strength-in-numbers approach to programming Audiences for serious-minded cinema, or just good, interesting cinema, stretch far beyond the M2 5, but are poorly served Ellar Coltrane in Boyhood and marketing. The network (known as FAN) has more than 300 member organisations and will keep growing. FAN members (and others) can also apply to a Lottery pot called the Programming Development Fund, the cinemas’ equivalent of the distributors’ P&A fund, intended to support inventive specialised film programming. Other Lottery support includes the Film Festivals Fund and the emerging BFI Neighbourhood, which supports touring cinema and provides kit for community venues. I mention all of these because behind the scenes we have been working hard to bring all of this activity into the Film Fund, where it will sit alongside our talent development, script development, feature production and distribution support operations. A slightly reconfigured team will look after UK-wide audience development, managing all the available funds for exhibition, festivals and distribution and making sure they are used to greatest effect. This is probably going to mean a slight rethinking of the Distribution Fund to ensure it’s as user-friendly as it can be. The audience team will then work much more closely with colleagues in development and production, making sure that filmmakers benefit from our access to distribution and exhibition brains. It’s a great opportunity to fulfil the promise of keeping in mind the development of audiences for British and specialised film, from the seed of an idea to the film’s opening weekend. One of the areas I’m particularly keen to look at collectively is the sheer volume of material being pushed out on a weekly basis, and what effect this is having on audiences and individual films. Ask most critics, exhibitors and distributors about capacity and they will tell you that we’ve y reached some kind of saturation point. The amount of money currently available for audience development is unprecedented, and the key to the success of these funds is in making sure they aren’t used to pander to existing appetites, but to reach that untapped yearning for something different and remarkable. Perhaps we should be putting more resources behind fewer films? For me, Linklater performed some kind of magic with Boyhood, and it was wonderful to watch it in a full cinema. It’s a great example of how brilliant and original filmmaking can become an event that resonates way beyond the confines of the arthouse. © @bf iben • Edgar Wright hasn’t sat licking his wounds since deciding to walk away from Marvel’s upcoming Ant-Man feature. The Shaun of the Dead director will instead turn his attention to Baby Driver, a project he apparently first began developing in 2008. Working Title’s Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner are producing with Nira Park, and the project has been reported as a “collision of crime, action, music and sound”. • John Wrathall, British screenwriter of The Liability and Good, and longtime contributor to Sight & Sound as both a writer and sub-editor, is to see his script for The Italian Chapel go into production in 2015. The film - based on true events - is set during World War II and follows an Italian soldier who is captured by the British and sent to an island off the coast of Scotland, where he meets a local girl, with whom he works to turn a rusty hut into a beautiful chapel. Many years later, the former POW, now happily married, returns to the island, only to find the woman still living nearby. • Philippe Garrel, the veteran French director whose film Jealousy opened in Britain in June, has started shooting his 25th feature film, L’Ombre des femmes. The film is co-written by Jean-Claude Carriere, Caroline Deruas and Arlette Langmann, and reportedly revolves around two impoverished documentary filmmakers in modern-day Paris. • Olivier Assayas is set to shoot his first American film, in October. Idol’s Eye will star Robert Pattinson, Rachel Weisz and Robert De Niro, and according to Assayas it is a true crime story set in Chicago in the 1970s, based on Hillel Levin’s Playboy piece ‘Boosting the Big Tuna’. • Pier Paolo Pasolini is the subject of not one, but two upcoming features. First out of the gate will be Abel Ferrara’s Pasolini , starring Willem Dafoe, due to premiere later this year. Following that will be La macchinazione , directed by Pasolini’s former assistant Davide Grieco, which details the last three months of Pasolini’s life before his murder in November 1975. The film is currently shooting in Italy. • Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (below) is developing a TV series for the MRC channel titled One Percent , reportedly set in the world of organic farming. Hilary Swank, Ed Helms and Ed Harris are in talks to star. The series will follow Inarritu’s next feature, Birdman or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance, which premieres as the opening night film of this year’s Venice festival. September 2014 | Sight&Sound 1 17 Festivals IL CINEMA RITROVATO TIME REGAINED Marrying into money: Mae Murray and John Gilbert in Erich von Stroheim’s 1925 version of The Merry Widow Bologna’s annual festival of the cinema of the past was a feast of gorgeous restorations and the paradoxically novel By James Bell Film festivals typically privilege the new, with their clamour for premieres and the latest discoveries, and the surrounding media rush to be first to register opinion on the previously unseen. But Bologna’s 11 Cinema Ritrovato (Cinema Rediscovered) festival, now in its 28th edition, is instead a vital celebration of the old, in all its inexhaustible variety - a festival entirely devoted to the joys of looking back. Its eight-day programme feels as varied as any major festival: reviving long-cherished old movies through new restorations, recontextualising the obscure or culturally remote through expertly programmed thematic collections, and rediscovering films that were previously lost, until their unearthing in one of the world’s film archives. Here the ‘old’ cinema is privileged in all its abundance, with ‘new’ discoveries at every turn. Scanning the festival programme each morning, I was more than once reminded of Bob Dylan’s response when asked why he played so much ‘old’ music on his Theme Time Radio Hour show: “Because there’s a lot more old songs than new songs”. The audience is largely free (some would say mercifully) of journalists and hype- merchants, being made up instead of archivists, programmers, DVD and Blu-ray label heads, film scholars and historians, and technicians visiting to compare notes on new restorations and the techniques involved. Cannes indicates the films we might expect to see in cinemas over the year ahead; 11 Cinema Ritrovato’s selections hint at the films we might expect to see in rep theatres or in new DVD or Blu-ray editions. It may not provide the same glamour, but for those it serves this is a festival every bit as important as Cannes. There’s an argument that with so much of cinema history available on accessible, high- quality formats like Blu-ray, distinctions between the old and new are being eroded - that the landscape for today’s cinephile is one in which the chronology suggested by weekly cinema programming cycles is of ever-decreasing importance, given that there is an almost infinite selection of films on offer instantaneously. A visit to II Cinema Ritrovato confirms that line but also corrects it, serving as a reminder of just how much remains unavailable on new media formats and of the importance of context. It’s one thing to watch a selection of films from 1914 on DVD alone at home, and quite another to watch them as originally intended, with an audience and live accompaniment. That might be stating the obvious, but the focus provided by 11 Cinema Ritrovato feels like an important affirmation of that truth. The sheer range of films on offer this year was daunting, and inevitably decisions had to be made about which routes to take and which to pass up. The programme strands are grouped into four main sections. The first, ‘The Time Machine’, programmed (as it has been for a number of years) a selection of films made exactly 100 years earlier. It also included an intriguing programme of films made inside the Ottoman empire between 1896-1914 (I caught one of the three compilations, a mix of nonfiction travelogues, constructed narratives of the exotic orient, and dance performances, which, as the programmers pointed out, highlight the challenges of such early material - determining its provenance and whether it was staged for the camera or not). As well, there was a fascinating ‘Musical Silents’ programme co-curated by the BFI’s Bryony Dixon, featuring silent films all linked in some way to music, either through early sound techniques, or expressly designed to be accompanied by particular pieces of music, whether classical or rousing singalongs (like the 1912 British film Are We Downhearted?). Perhaps the most memorable of those I caught was one by French pioneer of surrealism Germaine Dulac (the subject of a more extensive retrospective elsewhere in this year’s programme), with the Paris-set, quite haunting and modern Celles qui s’enfont, in which the lead 18 | Sight&Sound | September 2014 actress mouths the words to ‘A la derive’, a song by Germaine Lix (the French singer and actress now perhaps best known for her role in Marcel Carne’s Le Jourse Leve (1939)- coincidentally, one of the new restorations that played on the big screen in Bologna’s Piazza Maggiore in the festival’s nightly open-air screenings). The final programme in the Time Machine’ strand gathered together a range of cinematic depictions of Adolf Hitler, from the astonishingly clear-sighted Hitler’s Reign of Terror, shot by Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr on a trip to Europe in 1933, and a mixture of newsreel footage and re-enactments, to G.W. Pabst’s 1955 film The Last Act, set in Hitler’s Berlin bunker in the final days of the war. I regretted missing the compilation of Soviet anti-Hitler cartoons, and John Farrow’s fascinating-sounding US production The Hitler Gang, which I was reliably informed was a mix of sharpness (depicting the Nazis as close to gangsterism) and absurd comedy, all the more remarkable for having been made in 1944. German cinema of the Nazi era (though most definitely not ‘Nazi cinema’) was represented elsewhere in the programme with a retrospective of director Werner Hochbaum, a figure who has been ‘rediscovered’ a number of times (David Robinson wrote about him in S&S in the 1970s) yet, perhaps owing to the lack of a DVD collection, remains in the margins. The films shown in Bologna were unsubtitled, with non-German speakers reliant instead on far-from-ideal simultaneous translation via headsets, so I avoided most; but that may have been a mistake, judging by the one I did catch, the silent Briider{ 1929), a drama set around the Hamburg docks during the historic strike of 1896- 97. The film was commissioned by the Social Democratic party, and uses non-professional actors and location shooting to very blunt, striking effect. The aesthetic is a stark one, but for the most part (certainly until the plot of the strike itself kicks in) quite singular, with little camera movement but a sharp eye for detail. The strike depicted may have been historic, but in the tough, politicised faces of those seen on camera, and the impoverished dwellings and working conditions at the icy Hamburg docks in midwinter, it was impossible not to view it as a document of the conditions around 1930 from which the competing ideologies of the day in Germany - Nazi, Communist or Social Democrat - drew support and focus. Also from the 1930s was a terrific programme of early Japanese sound films from the Shochiku studio (co-programmed by regular S!tS contributor Alexander Jacoby), the third in as many years, following earlier programmes looking at the Nikkatsu and PCL studios. Sound cinema came slowly to Japan, in part because of the strength of the henshi tradition of live narration of silent cinema - so much so that Ozu Yasujiro, for instance, only made his first talkie in 1936. That film - the heartbreaking The Only Son, regarded by many as one of Ozu’s greatest films - was included, alongside a number of other titles previously unscreened in the West, revealing the very partial view we have of Japanese cinema of the period. One of these was Shimizu Hiroshi’s The Lady Who Wept in Spring (1933), which, for Bleak moments: The Lady Who Wept in Spring (1933), directed by Shimizu Hiroshi II Cinema Ritrovato’s selections hint at the films we might expect to see in rep theatres or in new DVD orBlu-rap editions those whose only other exposure to Shimizu’s work has been through DVD collections of his so-called ‘children’s’ and ‘travelling’ films, was surprisingly bleak. Historically interesting rather than a major discovery perhaps, it is a grim tale set among a mining community in Japan’s snowy north. Another rarity was a restoration of Mizoguchi Kenji’s period melodrama The Field Poppy (1935). The director himself admitted that this was one of his weakest efforts, but it was still unmissable for Japanophiles. Also of primarily historical interest was Dame Okichi (1935), the sole director credit of Mizoguchi’s sometime screenwriting collaborator Takashima Tatsunosuke. The film was apparently shot under Mizoguchi’s supervision, though it was unclear how much he actually had to do with production - judging by the highly inconsistent style and camerawork, one might guess very little. Also in the programme were two endearing films in the vein of Ozu’s ‘student’ comedies from director Gosho Heinosuke, another major figure of Japanese cinema of the period whose work has been almost impossible to see in the West, and the similarly light comedy Happy Times (1933), by the largely unknown director Nomura Hiromasa, about a newly-wed couple whose married bliss is disturbed by their friends and an Werner Hochbaum’s Briider (1929) uncle. Another featured director was Shimazu Yasujiro, whose Our Neighbour, Miss Yae (1934) was perhaps my personal favourite discovery in the programme, mixing Ozu-like observation of the lives of the lower middle classes with light humour - and boasting a wonderful comic cameo from Ozu regular Iida Choko as a neighbour who instigates a rambunctious drinking session. Other thematic and national programmes in this year’s festival included a strand of classic Indian cinema and one looking at Polish New Wave cinema shot in CinemaScope, which included screenings of Andrzej Wajda’s Samson (1961), Andrzej Munk’s unfinished but unforgettable Holocaust film Passenger (196 3), and, new to me, Aleksander Ford’s war film The First Day of Freedom (1964). There were also retrospectives devoted to William Wellman and popular Italian director Riccardo Freda. Dotted through the festival are unveilings of major new restorations by various archives from around the world. Among those I caught were an outstanding restoration by the Cineteca di Bologna and the Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project of Sergei Parajanov’s The Colour ofPomegranates (1968), another of King Hu’s balletic wuxia classic Dragon Inn (1966) (marred only by faulty projection), an appropriately vibrant and colourful restoration of Chinese director Xie Jin’s stirring, communist-inflected melodrama Two Stage Sisters (1964), and the faultless recent restoration of Sergio Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars (1964) that was unveiled at this year’s Cannes. Topping them all, however, were screenings of the new restorations of Jean Renoir’s Partie de campagne (1936) and the proto- noirLa Chienne (1931), and a particularly sharp looking restoration of John Ford’s My Darling Clementine (1946) that approached the sublime. A highlight of every day at II Cinema Ritrovato comes in the evening, when Bologna’s grand Piazza Maggiore plays host to a free outdoor screening on a giant screen. This year’s line- up included a new restoration of The Lady from Shanghai (1947), the aforementioned Le Jourse Teve and, most grandiose of all, Erich von Stroheim’s The Merry Widow (1925), whose full orchestra accompaniment filled the Piazza to unforgettable effect. © September 2014 | Sight&Sound 1 19 FESTIVALS Syria in the shadows: Yassin al-Haj Saleh in Our Terrible Country FIDMARSEILLE YOU, THE JURY FIDMarseille’s determinedly unorthodox approach to programming, and jury selection, helps it to punch above its weight By Neil Young In Marseille - as Alain Charnier perhaps reflected at the end of French Connection II ( 1975), with Topeye’ Doyle’s bullet lodging in his heart - crime doesn’t always pay But it can have its perks, even after sentencing. Inmates of the area’s biggest jail, Les Baumettes, provide one of the juries for the genially scruffy port’s most important film festival, FIDMarseille, whose 2 5th edition ran in the first week of July Seeking the opinion of this most captive audience runs contrary to the image of film festivals as communal, social events. The Baumettes jury does not visit the public venues of FID, a consistently outstanding medium- sized festival that is unfairly overshadowed by Bologna’s 11 Cinema Ritrovato and Karlovy Vary, with which it overlaps every year. The inmates’ auditorium is the prison’s video workshop, operated year-round by Lieux Fictifs, a “laboratory of cinematographic research”. It’s located in the former high-security wing, where in 1 9 7 7 the murderer Hamida Djandoubi became the last person to be guillotined in France. Though the jury is anonymous, and never gets to hobnob with other prize-deciders or engage in post-screening discussion with the paying audience, the practice has much to recommend it, as a contribution to rehabilitation and as an illustration of how a film festival can connect with the wider community. But the practice seems to be restricted to Francophone countries - it has also been adopted at Amiens, Switzerland’s Visions du Reel at Nyon and Montreal’s RIDM, the last two explicitly dedicated to nonfiction cinema. FIDMarseille itself is still often referred to as a documentary festival. But in 201 1 artistic director Jean-Pierre Rehm, an Algeria-bom 5 3-year-old of amiably no-nonsense mien who looks like he’s stepped out of Claude Sautet’s Classe tous risques, amended Festival International Documentaire to Festival International de Cinema - since, he observed, so many films were “straddling the narrative and the descriptive”. The same year, he introduced the Baumettes jury and the Prix Renaud Victor, named for an actor-director who spent two years at the jail working on the posthumously released documentary De jour comme de nuit (1992). This year, the nine contenders for the prize included five of the 1 5 entries in the International Competition, among them Eduardo Williams’s 28-minute J’ai oublie. FID’s competitions always mix features, mid-lengthers and shorts, with an emphasis on the unorthodox. Last year’s Grand Prix went to Mati Diop’s 45-minute Milk soleils, a multi-layered homage to her uncle Djibril Diop Mambety’s T973 Senegalese classic ToukiBouki. In 2012, Tunisian refugee-camp chronicle Babylon triumphed: two hours; numerous languages; zero subtitles. This year, the main competition jury, chaired by Wang Bing, played safe, picking Mohammad Ali Atassi and Ziad Homsi’s dutiful Competing with a slew of festivals, just weeks after Cannes, FID attracts an astonishing number of world premieres if undeniably topical Our Terrible Country. This Syrian/Lebanese production follows dissident writer Yassin al-Haj Saleh from his home in war-blasted Douma, near Damascus, across country to Turkey, where the former political prisoner ends up in semi-inadvertent, rueful exile. An explosive dispatch from the rubble of Syria’s civil war thus gradually shades into a quieter psychological profile, albeit one in which the co-directors allow their evident admiration for Saleh to cloud their objectivity. The Baumettes jury preferred a more subtly radical International Competition contender, Jorge Leon’s Before We Go, a ‘documentary’ of such carefully staged and overtly acknowledged artificiality that it could more accurately be termed a filmed series of ‘happenings’. A million miles away from Frederick Wiseman’s anthropological institution surveys, Leon’s 83-minute reverie concrete goes behind the scenes at Brussels’s elaborately opulent Theatre Royal de la Monnaie to observe three terminally ill Rough-edged: Bx46 pensioners therapeutically interacting with choreographers and performers in a self-aware but never self-conscious dance of death. It shared the prize with Joris Lachaise’s study of a Dakar mental hospital, Ce qu’il reste de lafolie. Before We Go is a prime example of the category-blurring FID champions, in ways that have steadily increased its international profile since Rehm’s arrival in 2002. At a time when festivals are getting bloated, FID stays lean: alongside this year’s shorts and retrospectives (devoted to Marguerite Duras and African- American pioneer Oscar Micheaux), just 5 1 new mid/feature-length films, 26 of them world premieres. Given that it competes with a slew of nonfiction festivals, mere weeks after Cannes, it’s astonishing that FID attracts so many world premieres and that their general level is so high. There are underwhelming selections at FID, but few of the outright stinkers that tarnish the reputations of bigger, flashier events. Intriguing titles pop up unannounced, from unheralded sources - such as Jeremie Brugidou and Fabien Clouette’s BX46, a rough-edged, briskly edited nocturnal immersion in the Hunts Point area of the Bronx. This largely industrial zone houses Fulton Fish Market, several waste-transfer facilities (the waste includes human faeces) and a modem version of the Victorian prison hulk: the Vernon C. Bain Center (VCBC), a vast barge moored in the East River just across from the more notorious penal environment of Rikers Island. As with so many of the most rewarding ‘straight’ documentaries, the key word is access: the young French directors roam the fish market freely, eliciting vibrant testimony from grizzled, loquacious employees, and make numerous visits to a waste-transfer facility. But the VCBC is firmly off limits: wordless images of this blandly oppressive ‘correctional facility’ eloquently punctuate the illuminating stream of workers’ testimonies. Even for the most intrepid documentarians, some doors remain shut. © 20 | Sight&Sound | September 2014 THE FIRST EVER SCIENCE FICTION FILM ON BLU-RAY FOR THE FIRST TIME FRAU 'm&OND FRITZ LANG FILM LANDING THIS AUGUST DUAL FORMAT EDITION tjyo Contains both Blu-ray and DVD versions IN CINEMAS AUGUST Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari. AVAILABLE FROM amazon.co.uk What are the greatest documentaries ever made ? Over the following 32 pages, we feature the votes of some of the 340 critics and filmmakers we polled in our search for authoritative answers By Nick Bradshaw This magazine has been conducting its famous once- a-decade poll of the greatest films in history for most of that history. Call this canon-making urge a sign of cin- ema’s relative immaturity (our pollees seem to have struggled harder with their assignment as the movies have mounted up), but the exercise is as expansive as it is reductive, offering up in our 2012 poll more than 2,000 movies for estimation, as well as spotlighting a path into the film forest for those yet to enter. Across all seven iterations of the poll, the fictional impulse in film has reigned, regardless of whether the fashion has been for neorealist fables of social hard- ship or for mazy myths of male obsession and power. Of course, it took the development of narrative fiction to persuade viewers that the new medium could be both sustainably entertaining (damsels in distress etc) and ar- tistic (great players emoting in costume) - and perhaps even today we find it easier to recognise, and enjoy, art in cinema when it seems to spring fully formed from the mind of the auteur, rather than being coaxed, chivvied or scratched out from a world that does not show its true face readily. Our 2012 poll, however, saw a blindsider in the advent of Dziga Vertov’s Man with a Movie Camera in our top ten: not only a documentary of sorts, but an eight-decade-old Soviet constructivist silent, long snubbed as a formalist dead end. In our rising tide of mediation, with camera- phones in every pocket and the people’s palace of You- Tube in the sky, have we finally caught up with Vertov’s vision of the city that films and sees itself? Last year too saw further documentary incursions into the cinema mainstream. The Act of Killing (a hellish hall of mirrors refraction of Man with a Movie Camera that tries to redeem cinema from its own prodigality) topped this magazine’s recent films-of-the-year poll (S&S, January) and enjoyed a year-long run at London’s ICA, something not seen since the days of 1970s and 80s mid- night movies. Gianfranco Rosi’s serio-comic Roman rondelay Sacro GRA became the first documentary to win the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, and documentary watchers found similar excitement in Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravel’s Leviathan, a high-seas variation on Georges Franju’s 1948 abat- toir short Le Sang des hetes that rekindled dreams of an unperformed ‘direct cinema’, wild and free, even as it found another hell of man and machines at the furthest remove from civilisation. It’s been seven years since our last documentary spe- cial; a decade since the box-office breakthroughs of Michael Moore and March of the Penguins, and the digital revolution that facilitated the serendipities and intru- sions of a found-drama doc like Capturing the Friedmans. Documentary festivals and cinema strands are burgeon- ing; the mass media’s escape into trivia and spectacle seems to have stoked a revival of the modern equivalent of the pre-TV newsreel cinema for audiences hungry for reflections on the world. Documentarians in turn have been energised by this attention, as Robert Greene argues in his whirlwind 1 5 -year history of our progress to documentary enlightenment over pages 52-55. 1 : % 6 2 T7707 StK>i.XH»ASWi IVOJrfS WwlfiNjC ^ ANvdnoD©*onoo»t4 '/f arc jj'X y>vj KQOM07 nouoooo Mi**n 0**0* wni 3 Aiaiviaamwt doi3A3o 3sv3id 22 | Sight&Sound | September 2014 Tho Demonstration Sheppard & McOowel Smoke Master Ogi Beta 625/50 4 3ff 18.03 68 DON T LOOK BACK September 2014 | Sight&Sound | 23 DOCUMENTARY POLL INTRODUCTION O And what earlier nonfiction marvels has time been kind to? Time, we decided, to canvass lots of experts. There is some irony in trying to set in stone something that has always mutated in the margins of cinema. It’s nearly 90 years since John Grierson started pushing his ‘D’ word at us - initially as an adjective, ‘documentary value’, in relation to Flaherty’s 1926 film Moana- and it remains descriptively nebulous, as you might expect of a label that attempts to encompass multiple permutations of reportage, perception, interpretation and imagination in a world made more uncertain by the invention of the movie camera. At any rate, we ducked the challenge and invited our voters to determine their own definition of the term, which is why we found James Benning writ- ing back with the assertion that “all films are fictions”, whereas Gabe Klinger (channelling Godard) submit- ted, “but all films are documentaries!” You’ll find more thoughts on both the word and the art in the voters’ com- ments overleaf. Perhaps all documentaries are documentaries of sorts - partial, compromised, and all the more compelling for it. Ditto these polls, which are certainly not as ideally balanced and populated across individual and national identities as they’re first conceived. What we have here are the results of and a selection from twin surveys of 237 international critics, curators and academics, and 103 filmmakers, of a more or less documentary bent, who agreed to nominate ten of the greatest documenta- ries ever made - “at any length, for any outlet, including television”. Despite our efforts, the voting pool is still too Anglophone, unsurprising given our networks. Still, as Mark Cousins discusses on page 1 1, the poll at least takes a stab at extending the canon: we find three Latin Ameri- can films, two from Iran, single titles from China, Japan and Armenia, and the quasi-Indonesian The Act of Kill- ing in the top 50. Thirty-seven per cent of our voters are women, a better rate than in our 2012 poll and reflective of greater female participation away from the big busi- ness of fiction. The results show that too (see the box op- posite) - though arguably not enough. We hoped to hear more about the hidden gems of broadcast television - Jeremy Isaacs’s The World at War series was the most noted - but there are some eye- openers in here: maybe Viktor Kossakovsky’s Belovy (a filmmakers’ favourite), maybe Artavazd Pelechian’s Sea- sons , high in both polls. These are films whose legends must have been burnished far from the mainstream of movie culture - whispered in documentary circles? Studied in academia? We were similarly surprised by the strength of the consensus that emerged around our top titles: ballots would come in listing Man with a Movie Camera, Shoah, Sans soldi Night and Fog and The Thin Blue Line before they got to any other titles. These, it turns out, are the ironclad classics of documentary; Vertov’s film alone garnered votes from almost half of all the critics. Brian Winston recounts its fall and rise on page 38. But we were also delighted by the relative youth of many of the titles: 1 1 of the top 50 were made since the year 2000. So this is something to delve into - and kick against. Documentary filmmakers, meanwhile, will be getting back to doing that with the ever-changing world. Indeed, as Charlotte Cook explores on page 48, the job of long- form investigative journalism increasingly seems to fall to filmmakers independent of, and unprotected by, the traditional media bastions: do we need to extend them our reporting safeguards? Her litmus test is Laura Poi- tras, confidante of Edward Snowden and a single wom- an with a movie camera now locked in an unequal bat- tle with the state with a surveillance dragnet. As we’ve been learning, the dream of mass observation, of fly-on- the-wall documentary transparency, is alive and kicking in the cellars of the Five Eyes’s monitoring machines. It’s pure documentation, perhaps - but without the partici- patory audience, it’s just not cinema. © Further features and videos inspired by our Documentary Poll will also be published at bfi.org.uk/sightandsound during August James Benning wrote back that ‘all films are fictions’, whereas Gabe Klinger submitted, ‘but all films are documentaries!’ WHERE THE TRUTH LIES Grizzly Man director Werner Herzog (above) outlined his approach to documentary in his 1999 Minnesota Declaration, claiming, There is such a thing as poetic, ecstatic truth.

I find it old and restrictive. I prefer the French term cinema du reel, which better corresponds to the richness, variety and indistinct nature of this cinematic form. Actually, for me, it is cinema tout court, as it was the original form of the seventh art at a time when no practical distinctions were made simply to distinguish one product from another on the market. It’s cinema du ree/because it deals with reality, but it’s also a genre that unites artistic forms, from animation to painting or plastic art, from treatments of historical material to literature, theatre and poetry. Yet it is far removed from reality as it is bom of an original sin of sorts: it stages situations, as those familiar with the history of the various versions of the Lumieres’ short Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory will know. It is therefore a cinematic form that respects reality solely in substance while manipulating its formal aspect in the course of portraying it. My choice is focused on the anthropocentrism of cinema, on the fact that cinema, like the other arts, is made by human beings for other human beings. Therefore, in order to be useful and impactful, art of this sort must be structured on the basis of the classic art of storytelling, and as such requires stories that are modem in nature, yet have a kind of mythical substratum. In other words, these films represent a world that is marked by more than what is apparent and immanent; they also possess a hidden and transcendental aspect that evocatively harks back to eternal existential questions.

I suspect one reason is that we feel more comfortable analysing screenplays, sets and performances (work we attribute to conscientious artists) than unscripted developments, natural settings and fellow human beings. In the past year, I’ve noticed some signs, including this poll, that nonfiction cinema’s cachet is on the rise. I’m not sure why, but I hope I’m correct. I spend most of my viewing time watching ‘documentary’ (I should note that several of the directors on my list don’t use this term, eg Allan King’s ‘actuality dramas’, Sergei Dvortsevoy’s ‘life cinema’). That’s not because of its educational value (I also read newspapers), but because I find it thrilling to watch gifted cinematographers and editors embrace spontaneity and wrestle with nature. I mean ‘nature’ in a very broad sense: plants, animals, buildings, weather, disease, time, other humans, ourselves. Apologies to the many major filmmakers I’ve knowingly and unknowingly left off this rough list. If I revisited this in the morning, the only film I’m certain would remain is Seventeen PETER BRADSHAW Critic, the Guardian, UK Dont Look Back (Pennebaker) Dreams of a Life (Morley) Listen to Britain (Jennings & McAllister) Our Daily Bread (Geyrhalter) The Act of Killing (Oppenheimer, Cynn & anonymous) Fahrenheit 9/11 (Moore) Grey Gardens (Maysles brothers, HovdeS Meyer) Injustice (Fero & Mehmood) Crumb (Zwigoff) Grizzly Man (Herzog) NICOLE BRENEZ Teacher and curator, France The Wave (Morey) Balle traversant une bulle de savon (Bull & Morey) Rien que les heures (Cavalcanti) Que Viva Mexico! (Eisenstein) Afrique 50 (Vautier) Aguaespejo granadino (Val del Omar) The Hour of the Furnaces (Getino & Solanas) Histoire(s) du cinema (Godard) Perfect Day (Leccia) Leviathan (Paravel & Castaing-Taylor) Etymologically, ‘documentary’ comes from ‘docerd, to teach and transmit. So a great documentary is an intervention in the field of knowledge. It shows how image and sound can question what a fact is, remind us of the plasticity of the real, cinematise our collective history and testify to the resources of the human mind, from rationality to psychic mysteries. RICHARD BRODY Critic, New Yorker, USA Shoah (Lanzmann) Histoire(s) du cinema (Godard) Portrait of Jason (Clarke) The Children Were Watching (Leacock) Chronicle of a Summer (Rouch & Morin) Night and Fog (Resnais) Numero zero (Eustache & Arrieta) Strange Victory (Hurwitz) The Emperor’s Naked Army Marches On (Hard) Welfare ( Wiseman) The essence of documentary is not invention but reinvention, not in the mere fact of recording events as they transpire, but in reconceiving the idea of recording in the act of doing so. That’s why so many of the greatest dramatic filmmakers’ work seems, in retrospect, to be documentary; why, in compiling a list, I found myself wondering whether the films of John Cassavetes and Robert Bresson, Jean Renoir and Alexander Dovzhenko, Ozu Yasujiro and Rainer Werner Fassbinder could be considered - and how things might have been if they had sought to make documentaries in the strict sense (and likely, in the process, have resisted the strictness of that sense). The high intellectual line of the conception of documentary as an aesthetic and a theoretical achievement runs from the birth of the cinema through the New Wave, passing through the Cinematheque of Henri Langlois and the reflexive ethnography of Jean Rouch, which is why there’s a surprising (even to me) number of French films on my list. But many of the films here imply many others; for instance, where there’s Richard Leacock, there’s also Robert Drew, D.A. Pennebaker, Albert and David Maysles, Barbara Kopple, Sarah Kemochan and Howard Smith, and many more"
