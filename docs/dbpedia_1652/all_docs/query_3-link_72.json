        "text": "SEPTEMBER 2024 BOOK NOTES\n\nThe Desert Experience\n\nBut first a reminder for your calendar: Charles Hartman and Martha Collins will give a Poetry Reading at Stonington Free Library on Sunday, September 8th at 5p.m.\n\nEssays and articles about books are an endless source of conversation and connection, sending one’s thoughts off in unexpected, serendipitous, directions. It was just such a connection that I found In a recent article in The Times Literary Supplement ( the TLS as it is known to all its devoted readers). Under the heading “Sanctity and sanctimony”, Irina Dumitrescu – described as a teacher “of medieval literature in a small town in Germany”- writes about her fascination with the Desert Fathers, the monks of the 3rd and 4th centuries who “devoted themselves to lives of prayer and asceticism in desolate locations. For them the “desert was not just a geographic location, but a symbol of renunciation and rigorous purity.” This sent me on hunt through my bookshelves for a treasured book that I had not looked at for a while, The Desert Fathers by the English medieval scholar and translator Helen Waddell.\n\nIn her Introduction, Helen Waddell quotes from Paulinus of Nola, (CE 353-4310)\n\n“Not that they beggared be in mind, or brutes,\n\nThat they have chosen their dwelling place afar\n\nIn lonely places: but their eyes are turned\n\nTo the high stars, the very deep of Truth.\n\n…. …. …. …. ….\n\nthat which they see they spurn\n\nThat they come at what they do not see,\n\nTheir senses kindled like a torch, that may\n\nBlaze through the secrets of eternity.”\n\n(tr. Helen Waddell, Medieval Latin Lyrics pub.1929)\n\nShe describes how these experiences and experiments in holiness of these monks influenced thought down the ages. It was St. Anthony, the most beloved of the Desert Fathers, whose writings brought about the conversion of St. Augustine. In the Seventeenth Century, the poet and divine, John Donne, in his “Litanie” asks to be delivered\n\n“From being anxious, or secure,\n\nDead clods of sadnesse, or light squibs of mirth,\n\nFrom thinking, that great courts immure\n\nAll, or no happinesse, or that this earth\n\nIs only for our prison frame’d,\n\nOr that Thou art covetous\n\nTo them Thou lovest, or that they are maim’d\n\nFrom reaching this world’s sweet, who seek Thee thus.”\n\nAnd forward to Twentieth Century and W.H. Auden’s elegy to W.B. Yeats:\n\n“Follow, poet, follow right\n\nTo the bottom of the night,\n\nWith your unconstraining voice\n\nStill persuade us to rejoice;\n\n…. …. …. …. ….\n\n“In the deserts of the heart\n\nLet the healing fountain start,\n\nIn the prison of his days\n\nTeach the free man how to praise.”\n\n(“In Memory of W. B. Yeats”)\n\nThe Desert Fathers is full of gems, full of enchanting stories. In “The Life of St. Paul The First Hermit” St. Jerome tells of how St. Antony finds the dead body of his friend the hermit Paul and is at a loss as he has nothing with which to dig a grave. “But even as he pondered, behold two lions came coursing, their manes flying, from the inner desert, and made towards him. At sight of them, he was at first in dread: then, turning his mind to God, he waited undismayed, as though he looked on doves. They came straight to the body of the holy dead, and halted by it wagging their tails, and then couched themselves at his feet, roaring mightily; and Antony well knew they were lamenting him, as best they could. Then going a little way off they began to scratch up the ground with their paws…. ’til they had dug a grave roomy enough for a man: and thereupon, as though to ask reward of their work, they came up to Antony, with drooping ears and down-bent heads, licking his hands and feet. He saw that they were begging for his blessing.” He blessed them and sent them on their way and buried his friend in the grave.\n\nIn a quotation from a Seventeenth Century lives of the fathers, Helen Waddell gives this description of these holy men:\n\n“The place called Scete is set in a vast desert; and it is reached by no path, nor is the track shown by any land-marks of earth, but one journeys by the signs and courses of the stars. Water is hard to find… Here abide men perfect in holiness;…. yet is their chief concern the loving kindness which they show one another and towards such as by chance may reach that spot….”\n\n(Introduction p. 5)\n\nThis is the loving kindness of perfect hospitality that is found in George Herbert’s poem “Love III”. There is, in all literature, nothing more gentle, in its true sense, than the exchange between the poet and his “quick-ey’d”, “sweetly questioning” host,Divine Love. This Seventeenth Century priest and poet had his own “desert experience”in his poor parish of Bemerton, far from the intellectual riches of court life. But from that “desert” sprung The Temple, the record of his spiritual struggle, poems that continue to have universal appeal.\n\nIn contrast to George Herbert, St. Jerome, having the freedom of choice, fled the desert, (though not before his own famous encounter with a lion), and returned to Rome. There he pursued, to our everlasting benefit, the life of the intellect and the pen.\n\nThis time spent with the desert fathers reminds me of a very different poet from a different time and place. Emily Dickinson, struggling as she did in her own desert place, but so deeply attuned to the natural world around her, wrote what is, perhaps, the ultimate September poem. This elegy in praise of the cricket’s”unobtrusive” song is sung in the minor key of a canticle –– “The Cricket is [Nature’s] utmost/ of Elegy, to Me –“. She also celebrates the Druids, those ancient priests of the natural world who predate the Desert Fathers in their search for the sacred:\n\n“Further in Summer than the Birds –\n\nPathetic from the Grass –\n\nA minor Nation celebrates\n\nIts unobtrusive Mass.\n\nNo Ordinance be seen –\n\nSo gradual the Grace\n\nA gentle Custom it becomes\n\nEnlarging Loneliness–\n\nAntiquest felt at Noon–\n\nWhen August burning low\n\nArise this spectral Canticle\n\nRepose to typify –\n\nRemit as yet no Grace–\n\nNo furrow on the Glow,\n\nBut a Druidic Difference\n\nEnhances Nature now–“\n\n(#895)\n\nBut as we began this conversation with the desert fathers, let’s give the last word to Paulinus of Nona who wrote in his poem of that longing for ––\n\n“an emptiness apart\n\nFrom worthless hopes: din of the market place\n\nAnd all the noisy crowding up of things,”\n\nAugust 2024 Book Notes\n\nHere are some poems and melodies in answer to a world that is a little out of tune -and a date for our September calendars.\n\n“Poetry always reserves the right to reach for the stars”: Seamus Heaney to Dennis O’Driscoll (Stepping Stones p.196). And in a 1997 Paris Review interview with Henri Cole, he says: “there’s a poem in Field Work called “The Singer’s House” which is really about the poet’s and the poem’s right to a tune in spite of the tunelessness of the world around them.”\n\n“The Singer’s House” opens in the ancient Northern Irish town of Carrickfergus (subject of a famous Irish song and an early Irish epic). But it is a city as cold as the salt mine beneath it and, in Biblical phrasing, the poet laments:\n\n“What do we say any more\n\nto conjure the salt of our earth?”\n\nin this world beset by The Troubles? So, to lift his spirits,\n\nthe poet turns his thoughts to Gweebarra on the Donegal shore, home of his friend, the singer David Hammond:\n\n“I see the glittering sound\n\nframed in your window,\n\nknives and forks set on oilcloth\n\nand the seals’ heads, suddenly outlined,\n\nscanning everything.\n\nPeople here used to believe\n\nthat drowned souls lived in the seals.\n\nAt spring tides they might change shape.\n\nThey loved music and swam for a singer\n\nWho might stand at the end of summer\n\nin the mouth of a whitewashed turf-shed,\n\nhis shoulder to the jamb, his song\n\na rowboat far out in evening.”\n\nThese lines recall another song on another Atlantic shore, in Nova Scotia. In her poem “At the Fishhouses”, Elizabeth Bishop makes one of her inimitable turns in the middle of a thought, as she gathers her breath for the heights where she will finally take the poem:\n\n“Cold dark deep and absolutely clear,\n\nelement bearable to no mortal,\n\nto fish and to seals . . . One seal particularly\n\nI have seen here evening after evening.\n\nHe was curious about me. He was interested in music;\n\nlike me a believer in total immersion,\n\nso I used to sing him Baptist hymns.\n\nI also sang “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.”\n\nHe stood up in the water and regarded me\n\nsteadily, moving his head a little.\n\nThen he would disappear, then suddenly emerge\n\nalmost in the same spot, with a sort of shrug\n\nas if it were against his better judgement.”\n\nWhen Heaney and Bishop met at Harvard they became immediate friends. Their friendship was cut tragically short by her sudden and untimely death – a friendship reflected, as in a mirror, in these vignettes of seals and their songs. Heaney’s close reading of “At The Fishhouses” in the title essay of his collection The Government of the Tongue is a joy to read, as is his study of her poetry in his Oxford lectures, The Redress of Poetry. Such riches sprang from such a brief acquaintance.\n\nMore than 300 years earlier, the English poet Andrew Marvell was looking to the garden to find “Fair Quiet” and “Innocence” amid its “delicious solitude” while wondering:-\n\n“How vainly men themselves amaze\n\nTo win the oak, the palm, the bays,”\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\n“Meanwhile the mind, from pleasures less,\n\nWithdraws into its happiness:\n\nThe mind, that ocean where each kind\n\nDoes straight its own resemblance find,\n\nYet it creates, transcending these,\n\nFor other worlds, and other seas,\n\nAnnihilating all that’s made\n\nTo a green thought in a green shade.\n\nHere at the fountain’s sliding foot,\n\nOr at some fruit-tree’s mossy root,\n\nCasting the body’s vest aside,\n\nMy soul into the boughs does glide:\n\nThere like a bird it sits and sings,\n\nThen whets, and combs its silver wings;\n\nAnd, till prepared for longer flight,\n\nWaves in its plumes the various light.”\n\nThere are echoes of Marvell in Yeats’ “Sailing to Byzantium”:\n\n“Once out of nature I shall never take\n\nMy bodily form from any natural thing,\n\nBut such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make\n\nOf hammered gold and gold enamelling\n\nTo keep a drowsy Emperor awake;\n\nOr set upon a golden bough to sing\n\nTo lords and ladies of Byzantium\n\nOf what is past, or passing, or to come.”\n\nHeaney describes “Sailing to Byzantium” as reading “like discharges of pure, self-possessed energy,” “from which the accidental circumstances have been excluded so that all that remains is the melody and stamina of resurgent spirit––.” It was from this poem that Heaney took the title “Singing School” for the sonnet sequence that forms the coda to North, his fourth book. In these sonnets, full of self-doubt–– “As I sit weighing and weighing/My responsible tristia./For what? For the ear? For the people?” the poet questions “Who, blowing up these sparks/For their meagre heat, have missed/ The once-in-a-lifetime portent,/ The comet’s pulsing rose.” But we know that, far from marking an end, it was a pivotal moment of new beginning. Heaney went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, and gave the world book after book of poems, translations and critical essays in which, in Yeats’ words, “Soul” will “clap its hands and sing, and louder sing…” and summon––\n\n“O sages, standing in God’s holy fire\n\nAs in the gold mosaic of a wall\n\nCome from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,\n\nAnd be the singing-masters of my soul.”\n\n“The Soul”, Czeslaw Milosz says, “exceeds its circumstances.” His words draw their peculiar power from having been spoken from the imprisoning shadow of a 20th Century Soviet hell; words echoed by Seamus Heaney who experienced the hell of life during The Troubles. Like Milosz, his great friend and fellow poet, Heaney recognized the transcendent power of poetry, containing the power, in its high art, as he said, “to redress”.\n\nA Date for Our Calendars: on Sunday, September 8th, at 5 pm the Library will be hosting a joint reading by Charles O. Hartman and Martha Collins. Professor Hartman is Poet in Residence Emeritus at Connecticut College and has published eight collections of poetry and several works of criticism. He will be reading from his new book Downfall of the Straight Line. Martha Collins is the author of eleven books of poetry. She founded the Creative Writing Program at UMass-Boston and was the Pauline Delaney Professor of Creative Writing at Oberlin College. Both these poets are voices for our time as they seek “to redress”, Charles Hartman, who is also a jazz musician, through the music of poetry, Martha Collins by challenging social injustice through the power of words.\n\n“the melody and stamina of resurgent spirit”.\n\nA Tribute to Charles Harding III. (1937-2024)\n\nIt was with great sadness that we heard of Charles Harding’s death on May 26th, deeply mourned by his wife, Beth, and all his family and friends. The Library also lost a very special friend and a faithful supporter. Over many years, Charles brought his expertise as a successful advertising executive to advising and guiding the production of the library monthly newsletter, both during the years when it was a print edition and when it went digital. His support and sound advice were invaluable, providing continuity and knowledge to the staff who headed up this key element of the Library’s all-important outreach to the community.\n\nBut Charles’ long lasting contribution to the life of the Library came in 2017, two years after the Board began work on a Strategic Plan to “Refresh: Renew: Reimagine” the Library. The Plan outlined three goals – 1: to engage the community and extend the reach of SFL – 2: to restore, renew and reimagine the spaces of SFL – and 3: to “Ensure Our Sustainability For Future Generations”. It was to achieve this third goal, the key to the success of the first two, that a Capital Campaign Committee was formed. The Library was blessed, yet again, with individuals who gave unstintingly of their time and talents because of their unwavering belief in the vital role that Stonington Free Library plays in the life of the community.\n\nIt was to this great effort that Charles brought his expertise as a wordsmith and communicator. He spearheaded the production of the 2017 brochure, Campaign to Upgrade and Fund A Library for the 21st Century – a document that had the brevity, the clarity and the information needed to take the Library’s message to potential donors and supporters – the right illustrations to support the right words. This brochure complemented the vision expressed in the Strategic Plan. It showed the way to make a vision into a reality. It meant that the Board of Trustees, and all those involved in this grand enterprise, with these two documents in their hands, had tools to support them in their efforts to get their message out.\n\nReading it today, this campaign brochure still carries the persuasive punch that it did the day it came out. Charles’s commitment was patient and tireless, showing the care and attention to detail that were the hallmark of all his enterprises, and that demonstrated his belief in the power of the written word to convey a message that is read, that is heard, and that is understood. A document that will surely serve as a model for all future campaigns.\n\nOver time, many, many people have given, and continue to give, in abundance, and beyond measure, of their time, talent and treasure, to support and sustain Stonington Free Library, as it evolves to meet the changing needs of our community.\n\nToday, Stonington Free Library honors , and remembers with gratitude, our friend and neighbor Charles Harding, and the gifts that he shared so selflessly with his community, gifts that have made, and will continue to make, a difference to present and future generations.\n\nThank you, Charles; you are missed.\n\nBelinda de Kay,\n\nDirector Emeritus, Stonington Free Library\n\nJUNE BOOK NOTES 2024\n\nA Poet’s Journey, Persephone and Shakespeare.\n\nWith “every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:”\n\n( The Winter’s Tale, Act V: sc. 2, ll: 119-120)\n\nOn Sunday, June 9th at 5 pm at Stonington Free Library, Sebastian Merrill will read from his poem Ghost::Seeds, published last year and the recipient of many awards. Mr Merrill is the great-nephew of the poet Amy Clampitt and will be introduced, and the program moderated, by Willard Spiegelman the author of the highly acclaimed 2023 biography, Nothing Stays Put: The Life and Poetry of Amy Clampitt.\n\nIn this graceful and moving poem, set on an island off the coast of Maine, Sebastian Merrill courageously explores his journey as a transgender man and, by evoking Persephone, seeks the self that he has lost.\n\nThe story of Persephone, seized by Hades and dragged down into the sunless underworld, leaving her grief struck mother, Demeter, is perhaps one of the most retold tales from time immemorial. Her story is the subject of poems by Sylvia Plath and Edna St. Vincent Millay and most recently in Nobel Laureate Louise Glück’s “The Wanderer” in her 2006 book Averno.\n\nBut reaching back a few thousand years, Ovid, one of Shakespeare’s favorite reads, tells the tale in Book V of The Metamorphoses – though with the Latin names of Proserpina and Pluto. In this telling, the idyllic landscape heightens the tragic drama that unfolds:\n\n“Not far from Enna’s wall are deep waters.\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nTall hills circle\n\nthat lake. Woods crown the slopes –– and like a veil,\n\nthe forest boughs abate the flames of Phoebus.\n\nBeneath those leaves, the air is cool, the soil\n\nis damp ––with many flowers, many colors.\n\nThere spring is never-ending. In that grove\n\nProserpina was playing, gathering\n\nviolets and white lilies. She had filled\n\nher basket and within her tunic’s folds,\n\nhad tucked fresh flowers,\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nThere Pluto––almost in one instant––saw,\n\nwas struck with longing, carried that girl off––\n\nso quick––unhesitating––was his love.\n\nThe goddess-girl was terrified. She called––\n\nin grief––upon her mother…\n\nShe had ripped\n\nher tunic at its upper edge, and since\n\nthe folds were loosened now, the flowers fell.\n\nSo simple is the heart of a young girl\n\nthat, at that loss, new grief is what she felt.”\n\nThat torn tunic, those fallen flowers, are forever part of our common memory. And here, in Shakespeare’s fairy tale, The Winter’s Tale (for it is a fairy tale) Perdita––whose name means Lost–– recalls the lost Proserpina as she addresses Camillo, who is, unbeknownst to her, a lord of her father’s court:\n\n“Now, my fair’st friend\n\nI would I had some flowers o’ the spring that might\n\nBecome your time of day;\n\nO Proserpina,\n\nFor the flowers now, that frighted thou let’st fall\n\nFrom Dis’s wagon! daffodils,\n\nThat come before the swallow dares, and take\n\nThe winds of March with beauty; violets dim,\n\nBut sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes\n\nOr Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses ,\n\nThat die unmarried, ere they can behold\n\nBright Phoebus in his strength––a malady\n\nMost incident to maids; bold oxlips and\n\nThe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,”\n\nAct IV: sc. iv. ll:112-125.\n\nAlso straight out of Ovid,is Autolycus, that rogue of such outrageous proportions that only a fairy tale could accommodate him He is the offspring of Mercury and Chione, “a connoisseur of wiles and guiles, an heir/ who passed off black as white and white as black, he fully matched his father’s art and craft.” (Metamorphoses Bk. XI).\n\nThis late play is a tragicomedy, a tale told in two distinct parts – a form that broke with tradition, as did the long (16 year) lapse of time. Winter, with its darkness and tragedy comes to an end, as winter will, at the end of Act III, and Spring, with its promise of new birth and forgiveness, is the tale told in Acts IV and V.\n\nIt is Leontes’ insane fit of jealousy that brings about all the tragic events of the play, a clear echo from the tragedy Othello:\n\nEmilia speaking to Desdemona:\n\n“But jealous souls will not be answered so;\n\nThey are not ever jealous for a cause,\n\nBut jealous for they are jealous: ’tis a monster\n\nBegot upon itself, born on itself.” Act 3: iv l.159.\n\n“The green-eyed monster which doth mock/ The meat it feeds on.” that is the basso continuo of the play, and which destroys Othello and all around him, has morphed in The Winter’s Tale into the grief stricken penitence and restoration of Leontes. In this fairy tale, its fabric interwoven with gods and goddesses––Apollo, Persephone, the Oracle at Delphi, Mercury’s son, Autolycus––Shakespeare brings us a world of both dark and light. In this world the lost child is found, the dead wife restored to life, spring follows winter. We have a feast of time warps, disguises and dances, a prince, Florizel, and his beloved Perdita, his shepherdess princess, tricks and misfortunes––good Antigonus, the gentle lord, loyal member of Leontes’ entourage,who is eaten by a bear, sacrificed to the needs of the story. It is his death that makes his wife, Paulina, and all at Leontes’ court, believe that the babe and he had perished together. Paulina is a woman whom everyone would wish to have at their side in a tough situation––a worthy companion to the noble Hermione.\n\nAnd so we have come to the end of our fairy tale. Everyone is united and Paulina, and Shakespeare, convince us all that the beloved Hermione, dead to the world for sixteen years, is restored to life, the statue breathes again and steps down from its pedestal. Paulina commands Hermione “come away,/ Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him/ Dear life redeems you.” “Our Perdita is found”. (Act V: sc.3). This is Persephone returning to the upper world from Hades, for that time of summer that she and her mother, Demeter, are allowed. In Othello life is “insupportable”. In The Winter’s Tale, Cleomenes, a lord in Leontes court, says this to the king:\n\n“Sir, you have done enough, and have performed\n\nA saint-like sorrow:\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nat the last,\n\nDo what the heavens have done, forget your evil:\n\nWith them, forgive yourself.” (Act V: sc. 1)\n\nWith “every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:”\n\nBook Notes for May 2024 –\n\nA Bouquet of Poems To Celebrate May:\n\n“I got me flowers to straw thy way;\n\nI got me boughs off many a tree:” George Herbert, “Easter”\n\nBut first, a reminder for our calendars. On Sunday May 12th at 5 p.m. (Mother’s Day) the Library is very fortunate to have Professor David Leeming speak on the occasion of James Baldwin’s centennial. His talk will focus on the life-long, and life-changing, friendship between James Baldwin and the artist Beauford Delaney. Professor Leeming is the author of many books, including the definitive biography of James Baldwin, who was a close friend.\n\nNow some poems of May, of flowers and of music, both glad and sad:\n\n“Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;\n\nSing, and disperse ‘em, if thou canst:\n\nSong\n\nOrpheus with his lute made trees,\n\nAnd the mountain tops that freeze,\n\nBow themselves when he did sing:\n\nTo his music plants and flowers\n\nEver sprung; as sun and showers\n\nThere had made a lasting spring.\n\nEvery thing that heard him play,\n\nEven the billows of the sea,\n\nHung their heads, and then lay by\n\nIn sweet music is such art,\n\nKilling care and grief of heart\n\nFall asleep, or hearing, die.”\n\nQueen Katherine in Act III, Sc. 1 of Shakespeare’s The Famous History of the Life of King Henry VIII:\n\nPoor Katherine, it did not end well for her, but perhaps songs gave her, even for a moment, much needed courage.\n\nAnd here is Shakespeare, again, as he gives us the loveliest, and most poignant, bouquet in all of literature:\n\nOphelia “There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray, love, remember: and there is pansies, that’s for thoughts.\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nThere’s fennel for you, and columbines: there’s rue for you, and some for me: we may call it herb-grace o’ Sundays: O, you must wear your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy: I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died:”\n\n(Hamlet: Act IV, sc, v)\n\n“Ophelia is a character almost too exquisitely touching to be dwelt upon. Oh rose of May, oh flower too soon faded! Her love, her madness, her death, are described with the truest touches of tenderness and pathos. It is a character which nobody but Shakespeare could have drawn….”\n\n(William Hazlitt, Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays)\n\nIn a change of tune, here is John Milton’s “Song on May Morning”:\n\n“Now the bright morning star, Day’s harbinger,\n\nComes dancing from the east, and leads with her\n\nThe flowery May, who from her green lap throws\n\nThe yellow cowslip and the pale primrose.\n\nHail bounteous May, that dost inspire\n\nMirth, and youth, and warm desire!\n\nWoods and groves are of thy dressing;\n\nHill and dale doth boast thy blessing.\n\nThus we salute thee with our early song,\n\nAnd welcome thee, and wish thee long.”\n\nThis little gem of a poem, a quatrain and a sestet (an almost, or “curtal”, sonnet ) has all the qualities of song – as promised in the title, which, with its lack of a definite, or indefinite, article (what weight they carry in their small presence or absence!) delivers an immediacy all its own. The quatrain is a single sentence in iambic pentameter, with enjambments that knit the whole together in a kind of lyric joy. Then the sestet offers a shift in tone, with tetrameter lines of rhyming couplets, before returning to the iambic pentameter in the final couplet. So much variety within such a small, curtailed, space is beautiful to contemplate. Written around 1629, it remains, a long time later,–– “we…wish thee long”–– a joyful song to lift the heart on May morning, or any morning.\n\nTo add to our bouquet, here is Gerard Manley Hopkins’ sonnet “Spring”, a poem of “juice and joy”. The musical energy in the alliteration, the enjambments and the rhyme scheme are quite breathtaking:\n\n“Nothing is so beautiful as Spring ––\n\nWhen weeds, in wheels, shoot long and lovely and lush;\n\nThrush’s eggs look little low heavens, and thrush\n\nThrough the echoing timber does so rinse and wring\n\nThe ear, it strikes like lightnings to hear him sing;\n\nThe glassy peartree leaves and blooms, they brush\n\nThe descending blue; that blue is all in a rush\n\nWith richness; the racing lambs too have fair their fling.\n\nWhat is all this juice and all this joy?\n\nA strain of the earth’s sweet being in the beginning\n\nIn Eden’s garden. –– Have, get, before it cloy,\n\nBefore it cloud, Christ, lord, and sour with sinning,\n\nInnocent mind and Mayday in girl and boy,\n\nMost, O maid’s child, thy choice and worthy the winning.”\n\nWith all the variety of spring bird song, here is a very different, but equally passionate and intense voice, Emily Dickinson’s serenade to the trailing arbutus, or mayflower. She looked for its arrival each year as the glad herald of spring and the end of winter:\n\n“Pink –– small –– and punctual ––\n\nAromatic–– low ––\n\nCovert–– in April ––\n\nCandid –– in May ––\n\nDear to the Moss ––\n\nKnown to the Knoll ––\n\nNext to the Robin\n\nIn every human Soul ––\n\nBold little Beauty\n\nBedecked with thee\n\nNature forswears\n\nAntiquity––“\n\nEmily Dickinson mentions the trailing arbutus in letters throughout her life – here are quotes from just two of her letters:\n\nTo Louise and Frances Norcross – dated early spring 1870:\n\n“The mud is very deep – up to the wagons’ stomachs – arbutus making pink clothes and everything alive.”( Letter #339, Selected Letters edited by Thomas H. Johnson):\n\nand in a letter (possibly the last that she wrote) to Mrs. J. G. Holland dated early spring 1886, she writes of news being “sweet as the first arbutus”. (letter # 1038, ibid.).\n\nThe poem is quite Blakean in the way it contains “heaven in a wild flower” – this punctual harbinger, “Dear to the Moss ––.”\n\n“Punctual” seems to be a treasured quality for Dickinson, it appears in other of her poems – in one she even ascribes that virtue to her favorite bird, the robin. Here she lifts this humdrum word out of the mundane and gives it a new face, making it, in George Herbert’s words, “new, tender, quick.”\n\nWith its promise of return and renewal, “Punctual” is Nature’s foreswearing of the poem’s final word –– a word which, Dickinson fashion, jumps off the page–– “Antiquity”. With that single word, the ancient idea of the flower as an image of mortality is rejected. It was some 3000 years ago that David, the Psalmist, wrote: “As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field so he flourisheth. / For the wind passeth over it and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.” (Ps. 103: vs. 15-16). Down the ages many poets have linked flowers with mortality; here are two to add to our bouquet. In the 17th Century, Robert Herrick, in his poem “To Daffodils”, saw the flowers as such reminders, no orphic “lasting spring” here:\n\n“Fair Daffodils, we weep to see\n\nYou haste away so soon;\n\n…. …. ….\n\nWe have short time to stay as you,\n\nWe have as short a spring;”\n\nHerrick’s contemporary, George Herbert, used the same image in many of his poems, “The Flower” being among the best known. Here in “Life” he looks at mortality with his characteristic clear-eyed serenity:\n\n“I made a posy while the day ran by:\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nBut Time did beckon to the flowers, and they\n\nBy noon most cunningly did steal away,\n\nAnd withered in my hand.\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nFarewell dear flowers, sweetly your time ye spent,\n\nFit, while ye lived, for smell or ornament,\n\nAnd after death for cures.\n\nI follow straight without complaint or grief,\n\nSince, if my scent be good, I care not if\n\nIt be as short as yours.”\n\nI hope these lyrics lift your spirits as they do mine –– “such art,/ Killing care and grief of heart”.\n\n“I got me flowers to straw thy way;\n\nI got me boughs off many a tree.”\n\nBook Notes April 2024 –\n\nAnton Chekhov, (1860-1904) a writer for today. And an important note for our May calendars.\n\n“I am reading a wonderful book ––– I don’t know whether you would like it or not ––– it’s Chekhov’s The Island of Sakhalin –– his account of his trip to the prison island in 1890. My Brazil book isn’t like that at all ––– but if mine could turn out one tenth as good, I think I’d die happy.” Elizabeth Bishop in a letter to her friend, Frani Blough Muser, September 19, 1968. (One Art, Elizabeth Bishop Letters, p. 496)\n\nIn an earlier letter, this time to Anne Stevenson dated January 20th 1964, Bishop writes: “What I mean is more than “observation”…. It is a living in reality that works both ways, the non-intellectual sources of wisdom and sympathy. …. someone I have read & read since I have been in Brazil, is Chekhov. If only more artists could be that good as well as good artists.”\n\nAnd in a letter to Robert Lowell from Brazil in March 1963:\n\n“I spent two days in Samambaia reading a long, bad but fascinating new life of Chekhov……What a wonderful man really –– almost a saint. The son of serfs yet a greater gentleman than the estate-owning novelists.”\n\nThis was the Chekhov that came to my mind on seeing, on television, the forty-seven year old Alexei Navalny lying in his open coffin. Navalny, a man of extraordinary courage and humanity, who “laid down his life for his friend”, whose life had been ended in a harsh penal colony like the one on Sakhalin Island that Chekhov knew.\n\nAs described in Bishop’s letter, in 1890 Chekhov made the arduous, 6,000 mile, journey across Siberia to Sakhalin Island to see for himself, as a medical doctor and biologist, seeking empirical evidence, to “observe” and to record, in meticulous detail, the conditions of the prisoners and indigenous people living there. The book he wrote to describe this “descent into hell”, remains, to this day, a powerful indictment of all such systems, just as his stories are stories of the human heart in all its “infinite variety”, told with the high art of a genius and a heart full of compassion for his fellow human beings. As a medical doctor he served the poorest of the poor and never accepted any payment for his work. From a young age he made his living, and supported his family, with his writings. He was three years younger than Navalny when he died of tuberculosis at the age of forty-four.\n\nSeamus Heaney, whose friendship with Elizabeth Bishop was cut short by her sudden death in 1979, would surely have met her criteria, along with Chekhov, of “good as well as good artists”. In Heaney’s 1984 volume Station Island, the lyric “Chekhov on Sakhalin” recalls Chekhov’s journey – the moment when he is returning from Sakhalin by sea. In seven rhymed quatrains, the reader travels with Chekhov to Tyumen, Siberia’s 16th Century city, and to gaze with him down into the depths of Lake Baikal:\n\n“But first he drank cognac by the ocean\n\nWith his back to all he had travelled there to face.\n\nHis head was swimming free as the troikas [open carriages drawn by a team of three horses abreast]\n\nOf Tyumen, he looked down from the rail\n\nOf his thirty years and saw a mile\n\nInto himself as if he were clear water:”\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\n“No cantor\n\nIn full throat by the iconostasis\n\nGot holier joy than he got from that glass\n\nThat shone and warmed like diamonds warming\n\nOn some pert young cleavage in a salon\n\nInviolable and affronting”.\n\nHeaney paints a portrait of a man who enjoyed all that life had to offer, but also a man who was haunted by what he had just experienced on Sakhalin:\n\n“He felt the glass go cold in the midnight sun.\n\nWhen he staggered up and smashed it on the stones\n\nIt rang as clearly as the convicts’ chains\n\nThat haunted him. All through the months to come\n\nIt rang on like the burden of his freedom\n\nTo try for the right tone –– not tract, not thesis ––\n\nAnd walk away from floggings. He who thought to squeeze\n\nHis slave’s blood out and waken the free man\n\nShadowed a convict guide through Sakhalin.”\n\nThe last lines of Heaney’s poem refer to a famous letter that Chekhov, grandson and son of a serf (freed under Tsar Alexander’s reforms), wrote from Moscow to his life-long friend Alexei Savorin, dated January 7th, 1889, in which he describes how he “squeezes the slave out of himself drop by drop and how, on waking up one morning, he finds that the blood coursing through his veins is no longer the blood of a slave, but that of a real human being.” (Letter # 15) [my bold]\n\nBut, as Heaney says, “the free man” who “ Shadowed a convict guide through Sakhalin” felt “the burden of his freedom/ To try for the right tone––not tract, not thesis ––“A burden that Heaney himself found very heavy, as a poet, as an Irish Catholic, at the time of The Troubles which form the back story and subtext to Station Island. In Stepping Stones, the 2008 book-length interview with Dennis O’Driscoll, he discusses the struggle “To try for the right tone ––not tract, not thesis––“, the burden of whether or not to engage politically, “If I had followed the logic of the Chekhov poem, I’d have gone to the prison [The Maze] and seen what was happening to the people on that hunger strike and written an account of it, “not tract, not thesis.” (p. 259).\n\nWhile working on the book about Sakhalin, Chekhov found this “right tone” in his story “Ward No.6”. It describes in slow, incremental detail, several characters and their life in the insane ward of a local hospital. In Chekhov’s inimitable manner, the story draws you along, the characters come alive on the page with details that stay vivid in your mind for no apparent reason, and then there is the stab to the heart and you are left, book still open in your hand, short of breath. So many of his stories are about people not listening to each other –– the sledgedriver Iona Potapov in “Misery”, or the unfortunate Ryabovitch with “with whiskers like a lynx’s.” in “The Kiss”–– Chekhov hoped the world would listen to “Ward No. 6”\n\nOne person especially listened. The dissident Russian poet, Anna Akhmatova, who somehow survived Stalin’s Russia while witnessing terrible suffering, and who was no fan of Chekhov’s writing (she called it “muddy and gray”), said that “Ward No. 6” captured perfectly the conditions that she lived with every day.\n\nAnother of Chekhov’s longer stories, “The Steppe”, is told from the point of view of a nine-year old boy “in a red shirt”, Yegory, going off to school accompanied by his merchant uncle and a kindly old priest, (perhaps the only such in Chekhov’s universe), Father Christopher, who “always smelled of cypress and dried cornflowers”. But the steppe itself is also a central character. We experience the coming of dawn when “the whole wide steppe flung off the twilight of early morning and was smiling and sparkling with dew. The cut rye, the coarse steppe grass, the milkwort, the wild hemp, all withered from the sultry heat…. now washed by the dew and caressed by the sun, revived, to fade again”. And then there are all the birds, petrels, partridges, lapwings; there are marmots and hares and “In the grass crickets, locusts and grasshoppers kept up their churring, monotonous music.” There is heat and monotony and the “lilac horizon” and a terrible storm. There is abundant life, as in all his stories, along with unforgettable characters drawn with the lightest touch of the pen.\n\nHis stories remind me so much of Elizabeth Bishop’s poetry, poetry that is so rich with closely observed detail, like the “big hirsute begonia” in “The Filling Station” and characters like the unforgettable Miss Breen in “Arrival at Santos”, and Crusoe in “Crusoe in England” with his “Friday, my dear Friday”. Crusoe’s “knife there on the shelf ––/ it reeked of meaning, like a crucifix./ It lived. …. I knew each nick and scratch by heart,/ the bluish blade, the broken tip, /the lines of wood grain on the handle. …. the parasol that took me such a time/ remembering the way the ribs go./ It will still work but, folded up,/looks like a plucked and skinny fowl.” In “The Moose”, that long bus journey through the Nova Scotia night, stanza upon stanza of vivid, closely observed, details of everyday life, the travelers on the bus who might themselves have been in a Chekhov story, and, when the moose finally appears, that haunting question:\n\n“Why, why do we feel\n\n(we all feel) this sweet\n\nsensation of joy?”\n\nThis, and so many of Elizabeth Bishop’s poems, are open ended – leaving the reader the gift of an open space for possibilities. Chekhov’s stories have the same quality, questions without obvious answers, which make them astonishingly twenty-first century.\n\nAnton Chekhov and his two older brothers were cruelly beaten every day as children, not just by their father but also by the choir master at the church in Taganrog, the city on the Black Sea where he was born. It left Anton with an abhorrence for any violence, physical or verbal, and a deep empathy for the sufferings of his fellow man. When he was a teenager, his father fled to Moscow to escape debtors prison, taking the family but leaving Chekhov alone to finish his studies. As well as attending school, he “read voraciously” in the Taganrog public library.\n\nWhich brings to mind that other young boy who found safety, intellectual nourishment and escape from a difficult world in the public library in New York City – James Baldwin, whose centenary will be celebrated at our Library on May 12th (Mother’s Day). David Leeming, Baldwin’s biographer and close friend, will talk about the life-changing and life-long friendship between James Baldwin and the artist Beauford Delaney.\n\nTo close, here is a vignette from David Leeming’s book describing James Baldwin when a young child. It is a salute to libraries, to kindliness, to hope and yes, in this Poetry Month, to the power of words:\n\nHis “smallness and shyness made him a natural victim of his peers, but Mrs. Ayer (the principal at P.S. 24 – “the first black principal in New York City”) made sure that teachers helped Jimmy to develop.\n\n…. …. … … …\n\nHis teachers encouraged him to visit the public library at 135th Street, where he read voraciously [my bold and italics] in the newly established Schomburg Collection. The library became his sanctuary and, in his mind, as he never went to college, his alma mater –– the place where on his deathbed he was to ask that his papers be deposited.” (James Baldwin, a biography by David Leeming, p. 13. Knopf 1994)\n\nRest In Peace, Alexei Navalny.\n\nBook Notes for March –\n\nA Visit to The Enchanted Island, and a tale of “Melodies unheard”:\n\nOne cold, grey February day, I thought what better play to read than The Tempest, what better place to be than on Prospero’s enchanted island? As William Hazlitt says in his1817 essay, the play “is full of grace and grandeur, the human and imaginary characters, the dramatic and the grotesque, are blended together with the greatest art. … He has here given “to airy nothing a local habitation and a name.” (Characters of Shakespeare’s Plays). The Tempest, the play that was chosen, so interestingly, by his friends and fellow actors, to be the first in the First Folio, even though it was the last work that he wrote on his own; the play in which Shakespeare has his Prospero, in a speech of glorious lyricism, bid his farewell to the world of the stage – the great Globe Theater itself:\n\n“Our revels now are ended. These our actors,\n\nAs I foretold you, were all spirits, and\n\nAre melted into air, into thin air:\n\nAnd, like the baseless fabric of this vision\n\nThe cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,\n\nThe solemn temples, the great globe itself,\n\nYea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve\n\nAnd, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\n\nLeave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\n\nAs dreams are made on, and our little life\n\nIs rounded with a sleep.” (Act IV: sc. 1 ll. 148-158).\n\nEvery generation brings its own readings to Shakespeare’s plays, that is his chameleon genius, his perpetual gift. But even taking into account modern sensibilities – post-colonial questions, Prospero as patriarch – the magic spell cast by the play remains, and at the core of this magic, a thread that weaves the fabric of the play into a harmonious whole, is the music and songs of Ariel, Prospero’s servant and spirit of the air, who promises to “do my spiriting gently”. Even the bruised spirit of Caliban is soothed by these “Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.” Such music, as he says, that:\n\n“Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments\n\nWill hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices\n\nThat, if I then had waked after a long sleep,\n\nWill make me sleep again; and then, in dreaming,\n\nThe clouds methought would open and show riches\n\nReady to drop on me, that, when I waked\n\nI cried to dream again.” (Act III: sc.3. ll.143-152).\n\nAgain, it is Ariel’s most loved songs with their “sweet air” that bring balm to Prince Ferdinand, grief struck, believing his father to have been drowned in the tempest:\n\n“Come unto these yellow sands,\n\nAnd then take hands:\n\nCourtsied when you have and kiss’d,\n\nThe wild waves whist,[into silence] Foot it featly here and there;\n\nAnd, sweet sprites, the burthen[refrain]bear.\n\nHark, hark!\n\nBow-wow.\n\nThe watch-dogs bark:\n\nBow-wow.\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nFerdinand: Where should this music be? i’ the air or the earth?\n\n…. …. …. … ….\n\nThis music crept by me upon the waters,\n\nAllaying both their fury and my passion\n\nWith its sweet air: thence I have followed it,\n\nOr it hath drawn me rather. But it is gone:\n\nNo, it begins again.\n\nAriel sings:\n\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\n\nOf his bones are coral made;\n\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\n\nNothing of him that doth fade\n\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\n\nInto something rich and strange.\n\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:” (Act I: sc. 2. ll 376-402).\n\nAnd it is Ariel who persuades the vengeful Prospero to abandon his tormenting of the wrecked mariners, his usurping brother and all the crew:\n\nAriel: “Your charm so strongly works ‘em\n\nThat if you now beheld them, your affections\n\nWould become tender.\n\nProspero: Dost thou think so, spirit?\n\nAriel: Mine would, sir, were I human.\n\nProspero: And mine shall.\n\n…. …. …. …. ….\n\nGo release them, Ariel:\n\nMy charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,\n\nAnd they shall be themselves.”\n\nThus the moment arrives when, left alone, Prospero muses on his powers and all that he has done with his “so potent art”. The time has come to close the chapter with “heavenly music”, “a solemn air and the best comforter/ To an unsettled fancy.”\n\n“But this rough magic\n\nI here abjure, and when I have required\n\nSome heavenly music, which even now I do,\n\nTo work mine end upon their senses that\n\nThis airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,\n\nBury it certain fathoms in the earth,\n\nAnd deeper than did ever plummet sound\n\nI’ll drown my book.” (Act V: sc. 1 ll. 15-57).\n\nAnd then, as Ariel attires Prospero in the robes of the Duke of Milan, one of his final tasks as servant before he gains his long promised freedom, he sings:\n\n“Where the bee sucks, there suck I:\n\nIn a cowslip bell I lie;\n\nThere I couch when owls do cry.\n\nOn the bat’s back I do fly\n\nAfter summer merrily.\n\nMerrily, merrily shall I live now\n\nUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough.\n\nProspero: Why that’s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee.”\n\nAriel, spirit of the air, and his “solemn music”, summon thoughts of the music of the spheres – first conceived of by the Ancient Greek mathematician, Pythagoras. Johannes Kepler, the 17th Century astronomer, thought such music could be heard, not by the ear, but by the soul, as did his near contemporary, the physician and divine, Sir Thomas Browne:\n\n“For there is a musicke where-ever there is a harmony, order or proportion; and thus farre we may maintain the musicke of the spheres; for those well ordered motions, and regular paces, though they give no sound unto the eare, yet to the understanding they strike a note most full of harmony.” (Religio Medici: bk.2 section 9).\n\nA thought captured by George Herbert in this line in his sonnet “Prayer 1” – “Music beyond the stars heard”.\n\nOr, in T. S. Eliot’s words:\n\n“the unattended\n\nMoment, the moment in and out of time,\n\nThe distraction fit, lost in a shaft of sunlight,\n\nThe wild thyme unseen, or the winter lightning\n\nOr the waterfall, or music heard so deeply\n\nThat it is not heard at all, …..” (“The Dry Sauvages” ll. 206-212.)\n\nOr again, the deep silence and musical enchantment of Keats’ “Ode to a Grecian Urn” – ever en-chanting, however familiar to our ears it might be:\n\n“Thou still unravished bride of quietness,\n\nThou foster-child of silence and slow time,\n\n…. …. …. …. ….\n\nWhat pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?\n\nHeard melodies are sweet, but those unheard\n\nAre sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;\n\nNot to the sensual ear, but, more endeared\n\nPipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:”\n\nAs a coda, let us go to the late 20th Century and another “soft pipe” that delivers another kind of music. “The Rain Stick” is the first poem in Seamus Heaney’s 1996 collection The Spirit Level:\n\n“Upend the rain stick and what happens next\n\nIs a music that you never would have known\n\nTo listen for. …..\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nYou stand there like a pipe\n\nBeing played by water, you shake it lightly\n\nAnd dimuendo runs through all its scale\n\nLike a gutter stopping trickling. …….\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nWho cares if all the music that transpires\n\nIs the fall of grit or dry seeds through a cactus?\n\nYou are like a rich man entering heaven\n\nThrough the ear of a raindrop. Listen now again.”\n\nIndeed, yes, let us “Listen now again” to these “sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.”\n\nBOOK NOTES FOR FEBRUARY 2024 -–\n\nThe First Valentine’s Day, stories of love and heartbreak from Chaucer and Shakespeare and poems by Donne, Bishop and Heaney about love in some of its myriad forms:\n\nThis is the story of Geoffrey Chaucer being sent, in 1380, as an envoy to negotiate the marriage of Anne of Bohemia to the young Richard II. It was about this time that he began to write his dream poem The Parliament of Fowles that is thought to be in celebration of the royal marriage, particularly since the principal bird among the fowles is a beautiful female eagle, the eagle being Anne’s symbol. An entrancing, and wildly imaginative, fantasy grounded in realistic detail, (in the magic garden all the trees are named along with their attributes, all the fowls have distinct, and recognizable, characters), it is a poem of courtly love as well as a satire poking fun at parliamentary procedure (Chaucer was a Member of Parliament for a short time). It is this poem that brought attention to a rather obscure Roman saint, St. Valentine, from the 3rd Century C.E., a priest and physician who was martyred for aiding persecuted Christians and who became the patron saint of betrothed couples and those seeking love. It is from this tale that Chaucer told in the 14th Century, that urges “Be glad, thou redere, and thy sorwe ofcaste”, that we have the Valentine’s Day that we know today.\n\nOf some 700 lines, The Parliament of Fowles is written in Rime Royale – stanzas of seven lines, a tercet and two couplets rhyming aba, bb and cc – the Chaucerian invention so perfect for storytelling.\n\nHere is the famous opening, taken from the Latin quip of the Greek physician Hippocrates (c.450-c.380 BCE) “ars longa, vita brevis”:\n\n“The lif so short, the craft so long to lerne,\n\nThe assay so hard, so sharp the conquering,\n\nThe dreadful joye always that slit so yerne\n\n[that slides away so swiftly]\n\nAll this mene I by Love, that my feelings,\n\nAstonisheth with his wonderful werking\n\nSo sore, ywis, that whan I on him thinke\n\nNat woot I wel wher that I flete or sinke.”\n\nThe spirit of Hippocrates appears again at line 127:\n\n“Thurgh me men good into the blisful place\n\nhertes hele [heart’s healing] and deadly woundes cure:\n\nThurgh me men good unto the welle of Grace\n\nTher greene and lusty May shal ever endure;\n\nThis is the way to al good adventure.\n\nBe glad, thou redere, and thy sorwe ofcaste.\n\nAl open am I; passe in, and speed thee faste!”\n\nWe soon come to a description of the bewitching young female eagle who is a central character in the tale:\n\n“Nature heeld on hir hond\n\nA formel eagle of shap the gentileste\n\nThat ever among his werkes fond,\n\nThe most benigne, and the goodlieste;\n\nIn her was every virtu at his reste\n\nSo ferforth that Nature hirself had blisse\n\nTo look on hire and oft her bek to kisse.” (ll. 172-178)\n\nAnd at last, around line 300, we come to the heart of the story:\n\n“And in a launde [grassy clearing] upon an hil of floures\n\nWas set this noble goddesse Nature;\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nFor this was on Saint Valentines day,\n\nWhen every foul cometh to choose his make.” [mate]\n\nSo the vying and jostling and the parliamentary-style debates begin until all is resolved:\n\n“Saint Valentine, that art ful hy on lofte; ––\n\nThus singen smale foules for thy sake ––\n\nNow welcome somer, with thy sonne softe,\n\nThou hast this wintres wedres overshake,\n\nAnd driven away the longe nightes blake!” (ll. 683-687).\n\nAlas, as we know, it did not end well for the hapless Richard and his Queen. Shakespeare’s The Tragedy of King Richard ll, first performed in 1597, tells a tale of a fall from grace and tragic end, a “longe nightes blake”, after the promise of sun-filled days that are the delight of Chaucer’s poem. Among the most lyrical of all Shakespeare’s plays, it is written entirely in iambic pentameter with frequent rhyming couplets. It is this lyricism and formal structure, as well as the historical subject and time frame, that find echoes in The Parliament of Fowles.\n\nRichard is defeated and deposed by Bolingbroke (the soon to be Henry IV), and led in disgrace through the London streets, vilified by his former subjects, “dust was thrown upon his sacred head”, he will go to prison and death. But it is the love that Richard and Anne hold for each other, the betrothal that Chaucer, in his office as envoy, helped to arrange and which he celebrated in his joyous poem, which links poem and play. Richard urges his queen, in a scene of poignant tenderness, to flee to France, his queen who “came adorned hither like sweet May/ Sent back like Hallowmas, or short’st of day” (Act V: sc.I ll.79-80)\n\nRichard: “So two together weeping make one woe.\n\nWeep for me in France, I for thee here;\n\nBetter far off than near, be ne’er the near.\n\nGo count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.\n\nQueen: So longest way will have the longest moans.\n\nRichard: Twice for one step I’ll groan, the way being short,\n\nAnd piece the way out with a heavy heart.\n\nCome, come, in wooing sorrow let’s be brief,\n\nSince wedding it, there is such length in grief:\n\nOne kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;\n\nThus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.” (Act V: sc. 1, ll. 89-96).\n\nBut leaving behind Valentine’s Day, here are poems that speak of love in some of its many guises.\n\nHere is another farewell to another Anne – John Donne’s “A Valediction Forbidding Mourning” – Anne his beloved wife, for whom he gave up a career at court when he married her in secret, and by whom he had twelve children. The year is 1611 or 1612, Donne is about to leave on a journey to France:\n\n“Our two souls therefore, which are one\n\nThough I must go, endure not yet\n\nA breach, but an expansion\n\nLike gold to airy thinness beat.\n\nIf they be two, they are two so\n\nAs stiffe twin compasses are two.\n\nThy soule the fixt foot, makes no show\n\nTo move, but doth if the other do.\n\n…. …. …. …. ….\n\nSuch wilt thou be to mee, who must\n\nLike th’other foot, obliquely runne;\n\nThy firmnes drawes my circle just,\n\nAnd makes me end, where I begunne.” (ll: 21-28 & 33-36)\n\nAs Donne wrote in another poem, “Love, all alike, no season knowes, nor clyme,/ Nor houres, dayes, moneths, which are the rags of time.” (“The Sunne Rising”). So, with that encouragement, we will jump ahead to the 20th Century, to the poetry of Seamus Heaney and one of the many vignette’s in which he immortalizes his deep love for his mother . This if from “The Swing” in his 1996 volume The Spirit Level, a memory of childhood play, with George Herbert overtones, that, like so many Heaney poems, offers a vision far beyond the immediate moment. His mother is with the children in the barn as they play on the swing-\n\n“With an old lopsided sack in the loop of it,\n\nPerfectly still, hanging like pulley-slack,\n\nA lure let down to tempt the soul to rise.\n\nEven so, we favored the earthbound. She\n\nSat there as majestic as an empress\n\nSteeping her swollen feet one at a time\n\nIn the enamel basin, feeding it\n\nEvery now and again with an opulent\n\nSteaming arc from a kettle on the floor\n\nBeside her. The plout of that was music\n\nTo our ears, her smile a mitigation.\n\nWhatever light the goddess had once shone\n\nAround her favorite coming from the bath\n\nWas what was needed then: there should have been\n\nFresh linen, ministrations by attendants,\n\nProcession and amazement. Instead she took\n\nEach rolled elastic stocking and drew it on\n\nLike the life she would not fail and was not\n\nMeant for.\n\n…. …. …. …. ….\n\nIn spite of all, we sailed\n\nBeyond ourselves …….”\n\nAnd finally, a little earlier in the 20th Century, another basin and another washing, as simple and domestic as the one in the barn, and just as intimate and sacramental. Here is the lyric “The Shampoo” by Elizabeth Bishop, (whose February birthday we celebrate!). Published in 1955, the final poem in her second volume, A Cold Spring, it is addressed to her lover and partner, Lota De Macedo Soares,\n\n“The still explosions on the rocks,\n\nthe lichens, grow\n\nby spreading, gray, concentric shocks.\n\nThey have arranged\n\nto meet the rings around the moon, although\n\nwithin our memories they have not changed.\n\nAnd since the heavens will attend\n\nas long on us,\n\nyou’ve been, dear friend,\n\nprecipitate and pragmatical;\n\nand look what happens. For Time is\n\nnothing if not amenable.\n\nThe shooting stars in your black hair\n\nin bright formation\n\nare flocking where,\n\nso straight, so soon?\n\n––Come, let me wash it in this big tin basin,\n\nbattered and shiny like the moon.”\n\n[You can find a recording of James Merrill reading “The Shampoo” at a 1993 seminar in Key West, and also find any of these poems on line].\n\nI hope you have enjoyed these poems. I have enjoyed sharing them with you, and may they the “wintres wedres overshake,/And drive(n) away the longe nightes blake!”\n\nBook Notes January 2024 –\n\nWinter Poetry that you read and “the soul’s sap quivers.”\n\n“A Nocturnall Upon St. Lucie’s Day, Being the shortest day”, John Donne’s cry from the heart on the death of a beloved, a cry mirrored in the darkness of the year’s shortest day:\n\n“T’is the yeares midnight, and it is the dayes,\n\nLucies, who scarece seaven houres herself unmaskes,\n\nThe Sunne is spent, and now his flasks\n\nSend forth light squibs, no constant rayes;\n\n…. …. …. … …\n\nI, by loves limbecke, am the grave\n\nof all, that’s nothing. …..\n\n… … … … … …. …\n\nIf I an ordinary nothing were,\n\nAs shadow, a light, and body must be here.\n\nBut I am None, nor will my Sunne renew.”\n\nBut our poems will carry us past that shortest day and our sun will renew as December becomes January. In contrast to his contemporary, John Donne, George Herbert in his poem” The Flower” speaks, in his inimitable way, to the “whole world’s sap is sunk”, and instead offers a promise of life renewed. Anthony Hecht, whose Collected Poems edited by Philip Hoy, has just been published by Knopf, who suffered from severe bouts of depression, found this promise of renewal in George Herbert’s poem. He sent a copy to a friend who was also struggling with clinical depression. He writes “I know of nothing more irrelevant than glib advice to cheer up…” and, later in the letter, he continues “There’s a beautiful poem by George Herbert, called “The Flower,” which bears directly and persuasively on the kinds of fluctuation you and I are both subject to.” (The Selected Letters edited by Jonathan F. S. Post p.342) Here is the George Herbert poem in part – one that will be familiar to readers of these Notes:\n\n“How fresh, O Lord, how sweet and clean\n\nAre thy returns! ev’n as the flowers in spring;\n\n…. …. …. ….\n\nWho would have thought my shrivel’d heart\n\nCould have recover’d greenness? It was gone\n\nQuite underground; as flowers depart\n\nTo see their mother-root, when they have blown\n\nWhere they together\n\nAll the hard weather,\n\nDead to the world, keep house unknown.\n\n…. …. … …. …\n\nAnd now in age I bud again,\n\nAfter so many deaths I live and write;\n\nI once more smell the dew and rain,\n\nAnd relish versing:”\n\nContinuing with our theme of winter, we find a different kind of return in the Four Quartets, T. S. Eliot’s poem of spiritual exploration of time and place. The first line of the second movement, “East Coker”, is “In my beginning is my end” and the last, “In my end is my beginning”,just one instance of the deeply satisfying circularity that informs the poem’s 190 lines. Here are the opening lines of “Little Gidding”, the final movement of the Quartets, with their promise of “Midwinter spring”, lines that echo from the 17th Century both Donne’s “The world’s whole sap is sunke,” and Herbert’s “How fresh, O Lord, how sweet and clean/ Are thy returns!”, while making a 20th Century poetry that is miraculously new:\n\n“Midwinter spring is its own season\n\nSempiternal though sodden toward sundown,\n\nSuspended in time, between pole and tropic.\n\nWhen the short day is brightest, with frost and fire,\n\nThe brief sun flames the ice, on pond and ditches,\n\nIn windless cold that is the heart’s heat,\n\nReflecting in a watery mirror\n\nA glare that is blindness in the early afternoon.\n\nAnd glow more intense than blaze of branch, or brazier,\n\nStirs the dumb spirit; no wind, but pentecostal fire\n\nIn the dark time of the year. Between melting and freezing\n\nThe soul’s sap quivers. This is the spring time\n\nBut not in time’s covenant.”\n\nReading these lines, each one so beautifully crafted, the “soul’s sap” does indeed quiver. We began with “midwinter spring” and we arrive at “This is the spring time/ But not in time’s covenant.”\n\nBut perhaps the ultimate January poem is “The Snow Man” by Wallace Stevens. Like Four Quartets, it is a poem of pattern and repetition created by words and the sound of words. The entire poem is an astonishing single sentence, with each of the five tercets at once complete in itself, but linked by enjambments to the following stanza, achieving an energy of forward movement while, at the same time, creating a deep well of stillness. The poem begins with “to regard” and “to behold”:\n\n“One must have the mind of winter\n\nTo regard the frost and the boughs\n\nOf the pine-trees crusted with snow\n\n“To behold the junipers shagged with ice\n\nThe spruces rough in the distant glitter\n\nOf the January sun; …..”\n\nAnd then moves to “the sound” and “the listener” who, in the final lines, again “beholds”, but also now hears\n\n“….the sound of the wind,\n\nIn the sound of a few leaves.\n\nWhich is the sound of the land\n\nFull of the same wind\n\nThat is blowing in the same bare place\n\nFor the listener, who listens in the snow,\n\nAnd, nothing himself, beholds\n\nNothing that is not there and the nothing that is.”\n\nAgain the mystery of “nothing” to make us pause. But this “nothing himself” would seem to be at peace, not the lost soul of Donne’s poem, “the grave of all, that’s nothing.”\n\n“Poems” as the late poet and critic James Longenbach wrote, “are works of art that people make out of words” and “a poem creates the moment as we enter it.” (The Lyric Now: 2020 U.Chicago Press). Such a moment and such a work of art is “The Snow Man” – the title itself a surprise, two words, not the single one we expect. In the snow man we have a mysterious presence that haunts the whole poem, though never mentioned again.\n\nBut how can we think of winter without Shakespeare and singing along with Amiens in As You Like It? The Duke’s attendant who is always ready to take on the world with a song:\n\n“Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\n\nThou art not so unkind\n\nAs man’s ingratitude;\n\nThy tooth is not so keen,\n\nBecause thou art not seen,\n\nAlthough thy breath be rude.\n\nHeigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly:\n\nMost friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:\n\nThen, heigh-ho the holly!\n\nThis life is most jolly.\n\nFreeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,\n\nThou dost not bite so nigh\n\nAs benefits forgot:\n\nThough the waters warp,\n\nThy sting is not so sharp\n\nAs friend remember’d not.\n\nHeigh-ho! sing etc.”\n\n(Act II scene 7 ll.174-190).\n\nAs always, Shakespeare brings the human to center stage. Stevens’ snow man is there too, center stage, “the listener who listens”, and “beholds”.\n\nIn this “Midwinter spring” we can look forward to many new events at Library. Here are two for your calendar. In October we will be celebrating the publication of James Longenbach’s book of poems that he completed shortly before his death in July 2022, with a memorial reading in his honor by Joanna Scott. Earlier in the season, in May, there will be a tribute on the occasion of the 100th Anniversary of James Baldwin’s birth by his friend and biographer, David Leeming.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed, as I have, this sampling of winter poems, with their promise of new beginnings, as we all step out into a New Year.\n\nBelinda’s Book Notes – November 2023\n\nHonoring Louise Glück (1943-2023). Poetry as conversation –– Poetry that is “one person talking to another”: poets “and the poets of ages past” who “coexist in the here and now.” A new translation of Homer.\n\nSince the sudden, and much lamented, death of Louise Glück on October 13th, there has been an outpouring of remembrances and essays honoring her as a great poet and a vital figure in the contemporary American literary landscape. Author of fourteen collections of poetry, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2020, and recipient of many awards, including the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, she was “acclaimed as one of America’s greatest living writers… whose searing, deeply personal work, often filtered through themes of classical mythology, religion and the natural world… was broadly accessible, both to critics, who praised her clarity and precise lyricism, and the broader reading public.” (The New York Times)\n\nHer first book was published in 1962 and her latest, Winter Recipes from the Collective, in 2021. Throughout this large body of work are woven the threads that affirm that circular nature of our poetic heritage that is celebrated by her fellow laureate, T. S. Eliot, in the Four Quartets –– “In my beginning is my end.”\n\nIn her Nobel acceptance speech, Louise Glück said:\n\n“The poems to which I have been most ardently drawn are poems in which the listener or reader makes an essential contribution, as recipient of a confidence or an outcry, sometimes as co-conspirator. As with Emily Dickinson ‘I’m Nobody! Who are you? / Are you –– Nobody –– too? / Then there’s a pair of us!’ – and Eliot in ‘Prufrock’\n\n‘Let us go then, you and I, / When the evening is spread out against the sky/ Like a patient etherized upon a table; …’’’\n\nWith these words she seems to be calling up not just “Prufrock,” but the Eliot who wrote in his 1945 essay, “The Music of Poetry,” “while poetry attempts to convey something beyond what can be conveyed in prose rhythms, it remains, all the same, one person talking to another” (my italics). And further, “poetry must not stray too far from the ordinary everyday language which we use and hear.”\n\nIf Louise Glück was drawn to Eliot and classical mythology, it was to the 17th Century priest poet, George Herbert, that Eliot looked for perfection in simplicity of speech and “ordinary everyday language.” In a talk given at Salisbury Cathedral in 1938, Eliot says of Herbert “It is by an easy conversational familiarity, even homeliness, that Herbert communicates with us as one person to another.” Here is Herbert’s “Jordan (1)”:\n\n“Who says that fictions and false hair\n\nBecome a verse? Is there no truth in beauty?\n\nIs all good structure in a winding stair?\n\nMay no lines pass, except they do their duty\n\nNot to a true, but painted chair?”\n\nEliot wove these thoughts about language into Movement V of “Little Gidding,” the last of the Four Quartets:\n\n“(where every word is at home,\n\nTaking its place to support the others,\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nThe complete consort dancing together)”\n\nContinuing in this tradition, Glück’s poems are just that, conversations between the poet and the reader or listener, “as one person to another.”\n\nThis is from “President’s Day” (2019), an unrhymed lyric with varying line lengths, mostly trimeter, but starting off with an iambic pentameter running on to the next line, giving a warm conversational effect that immediately engages the reader:\n\n“Lots of good-natured sunshine everywhere\n\nmaking the snow glitter ––– quite\n\nlifelike I thought, nice\n\nto see that again;”\n\nAnd then–––\n\n“And sure enough\n\nthe clouds came back, and sure enough\n\nthe sky grew dark and menacing,\n\n. . . . . .\n\nAnd yet moments ago\n\nthe sun was shining. How joyful my head was,\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n\nJoyful–––now there’s a word\n\nwe haven’t used in a while.”\n\nHere are lines from the lyric “The Wild Iris,” the title poem of her 1992 book:\n\n“At the end of my suffering\n\nthere was a door.\n\nHear me out: that which you call death\n\nI remember.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nYou who do not remember\n\npassage from the other world\n\nI tell you I could speak again: whatever\n\nreturns from oblivion returns\n\nto find a voice:”\n\nIn these lines we can hear echoes of Eliot in Movement V of “Little Gidding”:\n\n“We die with the dying:\n\nSee, they depart, and we go with them.\n\nWe are born with the dead:\n\nSee, they return, and bring us with them.”\n\n“The modern poet and the poets of ages past coexist in the here and now.” This is Eliot in his 1919 essay “Tradition and the Individual Talent.” It is, again, in this tradition that Louise Glück in her 1996 book, Meadowlands, tells the story of Penelope, Odysseus, and their marriage, with frequent commentary from their son Telemachus. In their broad and deep range of reference –– Dante was a rich source for them both –– T. S. Eliot and Louise Glück were both modern poets who coexisted with poets of ages past.\n\nWhich brings us to today, to Homer and the much anticipated new translation of The Iliad by Emily Wilson, following on her translation of The Odyssey of two years ago – the first Homer translations by a woman. Like Louise Glück’s poems, these ancient stories are rendered by Emily Wilson “in the here and now.”\n\nThe Odyssey, an epic of love and loyalty, adventure, and trouble (often trouble intentionally sought out by Odysseus!), is as immediate and alive today as when Homer proclaimed these tales to audiences millennia ago, in spoken conversation, then as now, “as between one person and another.” And just as the griefs and pities of war described in The Iliad are, once again, too much with us, Homer offers, in his telling of that tale of unfathomable grief and pity, what the Greeks called catharsis –– the release, literally purgation, from overwhelming emotions of grief or loss.\n\nSo it is that Homer brings us back, full circle ––“the complete consort dancing together” –– to Louise Glück’s poetry “of trauma and loss,” –– poems that offer catharsis to the reader she describes in her Nobel Speech, the reader who is the “recipient of a confidence or an outcry,” and who is sometimes “a co-conspirator.”\n\nLet’s close our conversation with these closing lines from “The Wild Iris”:\n\n“from the center of my life came\n\na great fountain, deep blue\n\nshadows on azure seawater.”\n\nAnd let’s close the circle, as Eliot did, with the last words of “East Coker” ––– “In my end is my beginning.”\n\nBelinda’s Book Notes – October 2023\n\nSonnets Made Anew, Emily Dickinson, Thoreau and the Songs of the Crickets, Keats’ “To Autumn” and Shakespeare:\n\nHenri Cole, the American poet, who will be reading from his new collection Gravity and Center: Selected Sonnets 1994-2022 at Stonington Free Library on Sunday, October 8th, wrote this in the book’s Afterword, describing the time when he was living in Japan, the country of his birth:\n\n“I wanted to write poems that conveyed the intensity of my life there –– the wildness and innocence, and the freedom. The sonnet –– with its infrastructure of highs and lows, with its volta and the idea of transformation, with its asymmetry of lines like the foliage of a tree growing above a trunk, and with its mix of passion and thought –– seemed to me about perfect”\n\nThere are nearly 130 of these sonnets, selected from five books plus some that are new. A review in the New York Times on April 18th this year – with the enticing title “A Poet Whose Swerves Capture the World in 14 Lines” – closes with these words – “Cole’s sonnet is a form both economical and maximal, which, through artifice and resistance to artifice, feels and makes you feel, thinks and makes you think.”\n\nIt is impossible, almost, to select lines to quote from these poems that are at once deeply personal and universal, often deeply painful yet joyful, but here are the last seven lines (no neat octet, sestet here) of the final sonnet in the book –– “with its mix of passion and thought”–– called “Sow with Piglets”:\n\n“But here, under a dispassionate night sky,\n\nin pig-time, with blue moonlight filtering\n\nthrough the cedars, I ask, Why do you leave\n\nfor happiness? Why not stay around awhile?\n\nWith muddy sneakers and thick torso,\n\nI feel saner in this place. I’ve paid my price\n\nand am here for the duration.”\n\nThe next poems were chosen just for delight in their celebration of late Summer and Fall, or Autumn, as Keats would name it.\n\nHere is Emily Dickinson’s hymn to the end of Summer heard in song of the crickets:\n\n“Further in Summer than the Birds –\n\nPathetic from the Grass –\n\nA minor Nation celebrates\n\nIts unobtrusive Mass.\n\nNo ordinance be seen –\n\nSo gradual the Grace\n\nA gentle Custom it becomes –\n\nEnlarging Loneliness –\n\nAntiquest felt at Noon –\n\nWhen August burning low\n\nArise this spectral Canticle\n\nRepose to typify –\n\nRemit as yet no Grace –\n\nNo furrow on the Glow,\n\nBut a Druidic Difference\n\nEnhances Nature now –\n\nFor further celebration of the season, we can turn to Keats’ “To Autumn” and the song of the crickets again. This is a poem, however often read, however much, as the Book of Proverbs says, written “on the tablet of your heart”, it remains perpetually fresh to mind and ear:\n\n“Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?\n\nThink not of them, thou hast thy music too,––\n\n. . . . .\n\nThen in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn\n\nAmong the river sallows, borne aloft\n\nOr sinking as the light wind lives or dies;\n\nAnd full grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;\n\nHedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft\n\nThe red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;\n\nAnd gathering swallows twitter in the skies.”\n\nIt was while listening to the “minor Nation’s” not so “unobtrusive Mass” in our back yard, that I came on this essay in the New York Times (September 23rd) titled “What Thoreau Heard In The Song of the Crickets” by Lewis Hyde. Thoreau, he wrote, heard “the requiem of the year” in the crickets’ song, an “earth song” and the sound of “the creaking of the earth’s axle” telling us that “time is limited and time is endless” – and “If the setting sun seems to hurry (a man) to improve the day while it lasts, the chant of the crickets fails not to reassure him, even-measured as of old, teaching him to take his own time henceforth forever.”\n\nReading this carried me back to that captured moment of timeless peace and contentment in Henri Cole’s sonnet –– “Why not stay around awhile? … I have paid my price and am here for the duration”. What T. S. Eliot called “The point of intersection of the timeless/ With time, ….” (“The Dry Salvages l.201- the glorious third poem of the Four Quartets).\n\nIt seems a natural coda to these October musings to turn to Shakespeare’s Sonnet #97, a lament for his absent beloved, with its “time removed” and “The teeming autumn big with rich increase,” and its “wanton burden” that is echoed by Keats, again in “To Autumn”: “Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,/Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;/ Conspiring with him how to load and bless/ With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run … And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;/ To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells/With a sweet kernel;”\n\n“How like a winter hath my absence been\n\nFrom thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year?\n\nWhat freezings have I felt, what dark days seen?\n\nWhat old December’s bareness everywhere?\n\nAnd yet this time removed was summer’s time,\n\nThe teeming autumn big with rich increase,\n\nBearing the wanton burden of the prime,\n\nLike widowed wombs after their lords’ decease:\n\nYet this abundant issue seemed to me\n\nBut hope of orphans and unfathered fruit,\n\nFor summer and his pleasures wait on thee,\n\nAnd thou away, the very birds are mute.\n\nOr if they sing, ’tis with so dull a cheer\n\nThat leaves look pale, dreading the winter’s near.”\n\nBelinda’s Book Notes – September 2023\n\nSeptember Book Notes -A Time To Wander on The Sea Shore\n\nin the company of Elizabeth Bishop, T. S. Eliot, Walt Whitman and Wallace Stevens, all poets who found, as people have found, from time immemorial, inspiration and solace in that elemental, mysterious place where the land meets the sea; all poets who transmuted the memories and emotions of the lyric “I”, beyond the limits of the personal, into the highest art.\n\nIt is such a transmutation that we find in Elizabeth Bishop’s “The Map”, the first poem in her first volume, North & South, (1946). A poem that, with its questionings, repetitions and corrections (metanoia) bears her signature mark as a poet, a poet whose travels along the coast line from north (Nova Scotia) to south (Brazil) informed so much of her life and of her writing:\n\n“Land lies in water; it is shadowed green,\n\nShadows, or are they shallows, at its edges\n\nshowing the line of long sea-weeded ledges\n\nwhere weeds hang to the simple blue from green.\n\nOr does the land lean down to lift the sea from under,\n\ndrawing it unperturbed around itself?\n\nAlong the fine tan sandy shelf\n\nis the land tugging at the sea from under?”\n\nThere are echoes in “The Map” of T. S. Eliot’s “The Dry Salvages”, written in 1941, in London during the Blitz. In this, the third of The Four Quartets, in the opening section, Eliot recalls his boyhood and youth sailing off the coast of Cape Ann, north of Gloucester, Massachusetts, but, like Bishop, he transmutes those deeply cherished memories and knowledge of sailing and the sea, into lyric poetry of breathtaking loveliness:\n\n“The river is within us, the sea is all about us;\n\nThe sea is the land’s edge also, the granite\n\nInto which it reaches, the beaches where it tosses\n\nIts hints of earlier and other creation:\n\nThe starfish, the horseshoe crab, the whale’s backbone;\n\nThe pools where it offers to our curiosity\n\nThe more delicate algae and the sea anemone.\n\nIt tosses up our losses, the torn seine,\n\nThe shattered lobsterpot, the broken oar\n\nAnd the gear of foreign dead men. The sea has many voices,\n\nMany gods and many voices.\n\nThe salt is on the briar rose,\n\nThe fog is in the fir trees.”\n\nFrom here we can drift with the tide, south to the shores of Long Island, or Paumanock as Walt Whitman called it, its Native American name. Whitman’s “Out of The Cradle Endlessly Rocking” is a deeply moving epic of 183 lines of varying lengths, in which he describes the pivotal moment in his life when, as a young boy, for several days and nights, he watched a pair of birds nesting on the shore, the poet was awakened within him, along with a sense of mortality:\n\n“Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,\n\nOut of the mocking-bird’s throat, the musical shuttle,\n\nOut of the Ninth-month midnight,\n\nOver the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child leaving his bed wander’d alone, bareheaded, barefoot,\n\nDown from the shower’d halo,\n\nUp from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive,\n\nOut from the patches of briers and blackberries,\n\nFrom the memories of the bird that chanted to me.”\n\nWe wander further south with Wallace Stevens’ “The Idea of Order at Key West.” Now we are standing on the sea shore of Florida’s Key West, in the presence of the singer, “the maker,” who is the lone creator of order in the face of the chaos that is the sea. The repetition of “sang”, “sing” and “song” intertwined with “sea” gives this poem an astonishing melodic force, where sound and meaning become inseparable:\n\n“She was the single artificer of the world\n\nIn which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,\n\nWhatever self it had, became the self\n\nThat was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,\n\nAs we beheld her striding there alone,\n\nKnew that there never was a world for her\n\nExcept the one she sang and, singing, made.”\n\nThe words “That was her song, for she was the maker” take us back north to Duxbury Massachusetts and Elizabeth Bishop’s poem “The End of March” – “It was cold and windy, scarcely the day/ to take a walk on that long beach”. But she and her friends, John Malcolm Brinnin and Bill Read, did take that walk -“The rackety, icy, offshore wind/ numbed our faces on one side:” – and from that walk on the sea shore, Bishop, “for she was the maker”, wove a magical poem of closely observed reality, beach detritus, “lengths and lengths, endless, of wet white string” – “A kite string?––But no kite.”, blended with fantasy, a “proto-dream house” and a playful “lion sun” “who’d walked the beach the last low tide/ …… who perhaps had batted a kite out of the sky to play with.” A magical close that lifts the reader into the realm of dreams on a lingering note of joy.\n\nBut we can’t end our wander on the shore without another Bishop poem, “Sandpiper” – the intensely observed little shore bird that, thanks to her poem, is now forever “a student of Blake,” and the poet who is, forever, “looking for something, something, something.”, the poet whose eye (“no detail too small”) gives us the exquisite final couplet, words that, with their rising note, linger in the air.\n\nThis lovely pen and water-color drawing of a sandpiper is by Susan Gallick, local artist and Stonington resident, who graciously allowed me to include it with these Notes:\n\n“a sheet/\n\nof interrupting water comes and goes\n\nand glazes over his dark and brittle feet.\n\nHe runs, he runs straight through it, watching his toes.\n\n–Watching, rather, the spaces of sand between them,\n\nwhere (no detail too small) the Atlantic drains\n\nrapidly backwards and downwards. As he runs,\n\nhe stares at the dragging grains.\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n\nlooking for something, something, something.\n\n. . . . . . . .\n\nThe millions of grains are black, white, tan and gray,\n\nmixed with quartz grains, rose and amethyst.”\n\nThese are just a few of very many sea shore poems and these, and many others, can all be found in a google search and can be listened to on YouTube – or found in the quiet stacks in the Library gallery, another good place to wander on a summer afternoon! I hope you enjoyed this end of summer wander beside the sea shore in the company of our beloved poets.\n\nBelinda’s Book Notes – July 2023\n\nA Tribute to James Longenbach through the poetry of Wallace Stevens:\n\nJames Longenbach (1959-2022) a beloved member of our community, distinguished scholar, critic, teacher and poet, he was the author of many books of poetry and literary criticism. His later work focused on contemporary poets, but his earlier critical studies were of W.B. Yeats, Ezra Pound and Wallace Stevens, including The Plain Sense of Things,(Oxford University Press,1991) an in-depth study of Stevens.\n\nHere, offered in tribute to James Longenbach on this one year anniversary of his death, is a look at three poems of summer by Wallace Stevens. Stevens’ life was shaped by two World Wars and the Great Depression. Throughout his career as a poet he explored, and questioned, the function and uses of poetry in the face of world disorder, seeking, and, as he wrote in the last line of his last poem, “Not Ideas About The Thing But The Thing Itself,” perhaps finding “A new knowledge of reality”. In his poems we see what Stevens called “the imagination pressing back against the pressure of reality.” Poetry, imagination, he wrote “the expression of it, the sound of its words, helps us to live our lives.” (“The Noble Rider and the Sound of Words” last para.; from The Necessary Angel, Essays on Reality and the Imagination,1942)\n\nIn a review of Transport of Summer in the New York Times in April 1947, F.O Matthiessen said that Wallace Stevens wrote his poems “against the realization that we live in a time of violent disorder” and that out of his imagination “a man can recreate afresh his world.” Matthiessen described Stevens as a poet who expressed such truths with “gaiety of language” and “with the mellowness and tang of a late-summer wine.”\n\nThe first of these poems is “Variations on a Summer Day,” written in 1942 and published in the same year in Parts of a World, a world shaken by the “violent disorder” of the Second World War. The title evokes a musical composition as much as a poem, the two being inextricably entwined in form and sound:\n\nI\n\n“Say of the gulls that they are flying\n\nIn light blue air over dark blue sea.\n\nII\n\nA music more than breath, but less Than the wind, sub-music like sub-speech,\n\nA repetition of unconscious things,\n\nLetters of rock and water, words\n\nOf the visible elements and of ours.\n\nV\n\nThe leaves of the sea are shaken and shaken.\n\nThere was a tree that was a father,\n\nWe sat beneath it and sang our songs.\n\nVII\n\nOne sparrow is worth a thousand gulls,\n\nWhen it sings. The gull sits on the chimney-tops.\n\nHe mocks the guinea, challenges\n\nThe crow, inciting various modes.\n\nThe sparrow requites one, without intent.”\n\nThere is a tenderness in that last line that, for this reader,\n\ncalls up those sparrows in the New Testament:\n\n“Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? …. ye are of more value than many sparrows.” (Matt: ch 10. v.29-31)\n\nAnd again an arresting musical image in canto VIII:\n\n“But one looks at the sea\n\nAs one improvises, on a piano.”\n\nAnd in canto XIV:\n\n“Words add to the senses. The words for the dazzle\n\nOf mica, the dithering of grass,\n\nThe Arachne integument of dead trees,\n\nAre the eye grown larger, more intense.”\n\nWe have, indeed, “gaiety of language” in these “Variations”.\n\nThese images and ideas are pursued in Transport of Summer in his long poem“Credences of Summer.” Written in 1947, the summer that followed the end of the war,when people might, as we now might, just for a moment, suspend disbelief and believe in the promises, the credences, of summer, when “the mind lays by its trouble” even as we know, as Stevens’ knew, in Shakespeare’s words, “summer’s lease has all too short a date.”\n\nI\n\n“Now in midsummer come and all fools slaughtered\n\nAnd spring’s infuriations over and a long way\n\nTo the first autumnal inhalations, young broods\n\nAre in the grass, the roses are heavy with a weight\n\nOf fragrance and the mind lays by its trouble.\n\nAnd here we have that “eye grown larger…”\n\nII\n\n“Let’s see the very thing and nothing else.\n\n. . . . . .\n\nTrace the gold sun about the whitened sky\n\nWithout evasion by a single metaphor.\n\nLook at it in its essential barrenness\n\nAnd say this, this is the centre that I seek.\n\nFix it in an eternal foliage.\n\nAnd fill the foliage with arrested peace – “\n\nIn the same collection, he wrote of that “arrested peace” of summer in his lyric “The House Was Quiet And The World Was Calm”. Written in eight non-rhyming iambic pentameter couplets (with Stevensian variations) the repetitions of words and phrases suggesting both a villanelle and a sestina, without being quite either one of these, the poem conveys that sense of perfect form with variations found in “Variations” and “Credences”, “that mellowness and tang of a late-summer wine”:\n\n“The house was quiet and the world was calm.\n\nThe reader became the book; and summer night\n\nWas like the conscious being of the book.\n\nThe house was quiet and the world was calm.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nAnd the world was calm. The truth in a calm world,\n\nIn which there is no other meaning, itself\n\nIs calm, itself is summer and night, itself\n\nIs the reader leaning late and reading there.”\n\nThe calm, and sense of oneness, that this lyric conveys, recalls Jim Longenbach’s beautiful lyric “Thursday” from his last book, Forever (Norton, 2021) – a poem about making, about making poetry, about making risotto:\n\n“Because the most difficult part about making something, also the best,\n\nIs existing in the middle,\n\nSustaining an act of radical imagination,\n\nI simmered a broth: onion, lemon, a big handful of mint.\n\n. . . .\n\nThe miracle, it’s easy to miss, is the moment when the husks\n\ndissolve,\n\nEach grain releasing its tiny explosion of starch.\n\nIf you take it off the heat just then, let it sit\n\nWhile you shave the parmesan into paper-thin curls,\n\nIt will be perfectly creamy,\n\nBut will still have bite.\n\nThere will be dishes to do,\n\nThe moon will rise,\n\nAnd everyone you love will be safe.”\n\nIn the simplicity of this, and all Jim Longenbach’s carefully crafted lyrics, “The miracle, it’s easy to miss”. It is good to be able to say that a new collection of his poems will be forthcoming. Something to look forward to – poems to “help us to live our lives”!\n\nAnd in grateful tribute to this scholar poet, here are these lines from Wallace Stevens’ “Final Soliloquy Of The Interior Paramour:\n\n“We say God and the imagination are one….\n\nHow high that highest candle lights the dark.”\n\nFINALLY AN IMPORTANT NOTE FOR YOUR CALENDAR:\n\nON SUNDAY, AUGUST 13TH AT 5PM IN THE LIBRARY, JONATHAN POST WILL READ AND DISCUSS POEMS FROM THE WORK OF ANTHONY HECHT IN A CELEBRATION OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH. PROFESSOR POST IS EDITOR OF THE SELECTED LETTERS OF ANTHONY HECHT (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013)AND AUTHOR OF THE THICKNESS OF PARTICULARS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF ANTHONY HECHT’S POETRY (Oxford University Press, 2015).\n\nBelinda’s Book Notes – June 2023\n\nIt’s June, Let’s Take Wing:\n\nWith Andrew Marvell in “The Garden”:\n\n“Here at the fountain’s sliding foot,\n\nOr at some fruit-tree’s mossy root,\n\nCasting the body’s vest aside,\n\nMy soul into the boughs does glide;\n\nThere like a bird it sits, and sings,\n\nThen whets and combs its silver wings;\n\nAnd, till prepared for longer flight,\n\nWaves in its plumes the various light.”\n\nOr with Shakespeare as, in a moment of despair, it is the thought of his beloved that makes his spirit rise like the soaring song of the skylark:\n\n“Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,\n\nHaply I think on thee – and then my state,\n\nLike to the lark at break of day arising\n\nFrom sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;\n\nFor thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings\n\nThat then I scorn to change my state with kings.” (Sonnet #29).\n\nStaying with Shakespeare’s magic, it is the dueling songs of the lark and the nightingale that accompany what is surely one of the sweetest, and saddest, duets between lovers ever conceived:\n\nJuliet: “Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day:\n\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark,\n\nThat pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;\n\nNightly he sings on yon pomegranate-tree:\n\nBelieve me, love, it was the nightingale.\n\nRomeo: “It was the lark, the herald of the morn,\n\nNo nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks\n\nDo lace the severing clouds in yonder east:\n\nNight’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day\n\nStands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.”\n\nRomeo goes along with Juliet’s “Yon light is not daylight, I know it,…”\n\n“Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat/The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:”\n\nBut Juliet, her heart breaking, speaks the truth that they both wish not to be so, that the lark is heralding the dawning day and they must part:\n\n“It is, it is: hie hence, begone, away!\n\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune,\n\nStraining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.”\n\nAct 3: sc.V\n\nOf course, for us, the nightingale will always call to mind Keats’ Ode:\n\n“The voice I hear this passing night was heard\n\nIn ancient days by emperor and clown:\n\nPerhaps the self-same song that found a path\n\nThrough the sad heart of Ruth, when sick for home,\n\nShe stood in tears amid the alien corn;”\n\nIn Keats’ miraculous turn of phrase, it is the song that is, here, the active agent, finding “a path/ Through the sad heart of Ruth” just as the poem finds a path through the heart of every reader. Keats composed this Ode in 1819, calling the nightingale “Darkling”, and it was on the last day of that century, when the threat of war was already looming, that Thomas Hardy wrote his lyric “The Darkling Thrush. In a landscape where “The tangled bine-stems scored the sky/like strings of broken lyres” he found “Some blessed Hope” in the “evensong of “An aged thrush”:\n\n“At once a voice arose among\n\nThe bleak twigs overhead\n\nIn a full-hearted evensong of joy illimited;\n\nAn aged thrush, frail, gaunt and small,\n\nIn blast-beruffled plume,\n\nHad chosen thus to fling his soul\n\nUpon the growing gloom.”\n\nBut back to Keats and a letter where he wrote that “if a sparrow come before my window I take part in its existence and pick about the gravel.” These words remind me of the Seventeenth Century Welsh metaphysical poet, Henry Vaughan, and his tender lyric “The Bird.” With echoes of the Psalmist, “the sparrow hath found a house and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young” (Ps. 84), we have Vaughan as he imagines the little bird, taking “part in its existence:”\n\n“Hither thou com’st, the busie wind all night\n\nBlew through thy lodging, where thine own warm wing\n\nThy pillow was. Many a sullen storm\n\n(For which coarse man seems much the fitter born,)\n\nRain’d on thy bed\n\nAnd harmless head.\n\nAnd now as fresh and cheerful as the light\n\nThy little heart in early hymns doth sing\n\nUnto that Providence, whose unseen arm\n\nCurb’d them, and cloath’d thee well and warm -“\n\nHere is a two-fold simplicity – the poet, identifying with the little bird while seeking for himself that “unseen arm” of Providence to guard him also until the light of dawn appears.\n\nSome three hundred years later, Elizabeth Bishop put a life-time of observation and love of birds into her poems – “thousands of light song-sparrow songs floating upward/ freely, dispassionately, through the mist, and meshing in brown-wet, fine, torn fish-nets” (“Cape Breton”). And in “North Haven”, her heart-wrenching elegy for her dear friend Robert Lowell – “The Goldfinches are back, or others like them,/ and the White-throated Sparrow’s five note song,/ pleading and pleading, brings tears to the eyes.” As she says in “Poem” – “—the little that we get for free,/ the little of our earthly trust. Not much./ About the size of our abidance…” “Not much” maybe, but in these and all her poems, it is her seeing eye and hearing ear that makes that “little” so abundantly rich. But it is her last published poem, “Sonnet,” with its “rainbow-bird”, with its truncated lines, its reversed sestet and octet, that we carries us back to “The Garden” of Marvell, where, “casting the body’s vest aside/ My soul into the boughs does glide”:\n\nHere is the octet from “Sonnet” with its “joy illimited” –\n\n“Freed—the broken\n\nthermometer’s mercury\n\nrunning away;\n\nand the rainbow-bird\n\nfrom the narrow bevel\n\nof the empty mirror,\n\nflying wherever\n\nit feels like, gay!”\n\nBelinda’s Book Notes – May 2023\n\nA 400th Anniversary, John Keats, Amy Clampitt, Joanna Scott and a Date for your Calendar.\n\n“To the Memory of My Beloved, the Author Mr. William Shakespeare\n\nand what he hath left us” – Ben Jonson\n\n(An 80 line elegy prefixed to the First Folio edition of Shakespeare’s works in 1623)\n\n“Soul of the age!\n\nThe applause! delight! the wonder of our stage!\n\nMy Shakespeare, rise;\n\n. . . . . . . . .\n\nThou art a monument without a tomb,\n\nAnd art alive still while thy book doth live,\n\nAnd we have wits to read and praise to give.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSweet swan of Avon what a sight it were\n\nTo see thee in our waters yet appear,\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nBut stay, I see thee in the hemisphere\n\nAdvanced and made a constellation there!\n\nShine forth, thou star of poets….”\n\nAnd Milton – “On Shakespeare”, a sonnet written for the frontispiece of the second edition in 1631 –\n\n“What needs my Shakespeare for his honored bones\n\nThe labor of an age in piléd stones?\n\nOr that his hallowed reliques should be hid\n\nUnder a star-ypointing pyramid?\n\nDear son of Memory, great heir of Fame,\n\nWhat need’st thou such weak witness of thy name?\n\nThou in our wonder and astonishment\n\nHast built thyself a livelong monument.”\n\nAnd of course we know that Shakespeare understood what his monument would be –\n\nSonnet 18\n\n“Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\n\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\n\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\n\nAnd summer’s lease hath all too short a date:\n\n. . . . . . . .\n\nNor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,\n\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:\n\nSo long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\n\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee.”\n\nand Sonnet 55\n\n“Not marble, nor the gilded monuments\n\nOf princes shall outlive this pow’rful rhyme,\n\nBut you shall shine more bright in these contents\n\nThan unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.”\n\nWords addressed to his beloved but also to the written word that will outlive all “gilded monuments”. This was the truth that Shakespeare understood, as Ovid did before him and Keats after him.\n\nBut in this 400th Anniversary Year we celebrate an act of friendship on the part of Heminges and Condell inspired by “wonder and astonishment” for their fellow player and author of their plays, seven years after his death, in bringing the First Folio into being, his true monument. This is a dramatic story of team effort, devotion and persistence in the face of obstacles that is set out in Emma Smith’s 2016 study, just republished, and Shakespeare’s Book by Chris Laoutaris, published this year. It was the vision and dedication of all those involved in the creation of the First Folio that preserved 36 of the plays, 18 of which might have been lost forever – words that have been the basso continuo of “wonder and astonishment”, as well as wisdom and comfort, for countless generations of readers, playgoers, poets and writers. It is that image from baroque music of the underlying, connecting theme that best describes for me the part that Shakespeare has played in the artistic lives of so many writers. You might recall the moment when Melville, at age 29, first read Shakespeare – whom he called his “Divine William” – when he found an edition with large enough print for his poor eyes that were “as tender as young sparrows”. Seven volumes that changed his life.\n\nThat was in February 1849. Three thousand miles away, on another continent, and thirty-two years earlier, in April 1817, the young John Keats set off for the Isle of Wight, intent on attempting to write an epic poem (Endymion). He carried with him a new purchase, “a copy of Shakespeare in seven small volumes.” According to his biographer, Walter Jackson Bate, “the book was to serve almost as a talisman or charm”, and, as we know, a key to his development as a thinker and poet. As he wrote to his friend, the artist Benjamin Haydon, at this, a time of great loneliness and spiritual trial, “I never quite despair and I read Shakespeare – indeed I shall I think never read any other Book much -”\n\nAnd of course Keats himself became the lodestar for many poets who came after him, among them Gerard Manley Hopkins – Keats was a presence from his early childhood – and Amy Clampitt, whose biography Nothing Stays Put: The Life and Poetry of Amy Clampitt by Willard Spiegelman has just been published by Knopf.\n\nIn this delightful book, at once scholarly and highly readable, Willard Spiegelman beautifully links the poet to her poetic forebears – the basso continuo in her life. At one point, describing Clampitt’s ability to enter into the world around her, to enjoy it in a Keatsian fashion, he quotes from a letter of Keats – “ – or if a Sparrow come before my Window I take part in its existence and pick about the Gravel.” (pp. 108-109).\n\nBut now, in this 400th anniversary year, a celebration of the Book if ever there was one, nearly one quarter a way through the 21st Century, we find ourselves in a world where physical books are disappearing from the shelves of academic and other libraries and are being replaced with digital versions. AI is suddenly a very present reality. Both are new phenomena for which we don’t have a map, while the resurgence of book banning brings history to our doorstep, with a map, if we care to read it. And, “while we have wits to read,” we will find, as people always have, truth in fiction, in stories. A mirror is held up to this challenging new world in Joanna Scott’s short story collection, Excuse Me While I Disappear. Through startling feats of imagination, combining depths of perception and humanity with the lightest touch, these stories, like all the best stories, tell us about our world and about ourselves.\n\nBut now let us return to Shakespeare,”Soul of the Age!”, whose words are the basso continuo that still weaves our age together, and, for a coda, turn to Emily Dickinson, another poet of great importance to Amy Clampitt. This lyric of four quatrains, like all Emily Dickinson poems, has as many readings as readers, but for me it speaks of the “Sweet Swan of Avon” –\n\n“This was a Poet –\n\nIt is That\n\nDistills amazing sense\n\nFrom Ordinary Meanings –\n\nAnd Attar so immense\n\nFrom the familiar species\n\nThat perished by the Door –“\n\n(#446)\n\nAnd with that, the Note for Your Calendar – On Sunday, May 14th, Mother’s Day, at 5 pm at Stonington Free Library, Willard Spiegelman will discuss his biography of Amy Clampitt – a fascinating figure in the world of 20th Century poetry – a much anticipated event and one not to be missed.\n\nBelinda’s Book Notes – April 2023\n\nCzeslaw Milosz, Seamus Heaney and The Redress Of Poetry, and a joy that catches “the heart off guard…”\n\nFirst, lines from two poems by Nobel Laureate, Cz"
