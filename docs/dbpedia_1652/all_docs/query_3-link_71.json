        "text": "Foreword\n\nAs the original proposer of the idea for this set, I owe some explanation of why and how this set was assembled. I first heard recordings of most of these singers in the 1960s. Unlike people of my generation who grew up in the UK, none of us in Canada (or in the USA) heard these singers on the radio. I was immediately attracted to the singing, especially that of Heddle Nash, Walter Widdop, and Webster Booth. Except for the famous Handel arias which they recorded, most of the songs they sang were unknown to me. Around the same time, I first read a collection of Shaw’s music reviews of late nineteenth-century performances in London and was struck by what a high opinion he had of the tenor Sims Reeves. Reeves, as I soon learned, never recorded, although recording was possible just before his final retirement and certainly before he died. When reviewing Reeves’s farewell concert at the Albert Hall in 1891, Shaw lamented at length that we were losing the greatest tenor in England and perhaps the greatest tenor in the world. I have always tried to imagine what Reeves might have sounded like and while we can never know, I am convinced that the tenors on this set, in the sound of their voices, the manner of their singing and the repertory that they recorded, were the true successors of Reeves while more modern British tenors, so much influenced by the singing of Peter Pears, are not. We have singled out Peter Pears not to be critical, but because he was one of those artists who had a profound influence on the tenors of the generation after him, and his example was certainly markedly different from that of any tenor on this set. This set is a tribute to a school of singing that is now largely lost and to some very British repertory that is seldom performed.\n\nWard Marston, Michael Aspinall, and I have been corresponding for several years about what recordings to include in and exclude from this set. We have generally agreed, but each of us has an individual view of what would constitute the ideal selection. Our rule of thumb was that this set would be a collection of British tenors singing British music in English. We decided to exclude the numerous recordings of these singers singing opera arias in English that were originally written in other languages. In so doing, we were aware that famous recordings such as Heddle Nash’s singing the Serenade from La jolie fille de Perth by Bizet would be excluded, but we felt that this set should be about the British repertory of arias and songs as well as about British singers. It was just a rule of thumb, and we ended up, inevitably, occasionally, breaking our own rule.\n\nWe have not included Alfred Piccaver, even though he was born in the UK and had a distinguished international career. He was trained in America and his singing was quite different from that of anyone else on the set. We have, however, included Evan Williams, even though he was American, because both the sound and manner of his singing and the repertory that he recorded was very similar to that of other tenors on the set. We rather arbitrarily excluded Canadian and Australian singers, even though Edward Johnson, Browning Mummery, and others made recordings that would have fit very well into our theme. We included only three tracks of John McCormack. We freely admit that three tracks are not a sufficient nod to his importance as a recording artist, but his recordings are easily available, and had we given him his due this set might have become a collection of British music sung by John McCormack and others.\n\nFinally, for the purposes of this set, we treated Handel as an English composer and, to some extent, Mendelssohn as well. Although Elijah was indeed written by a German composer and set originally to a German text, the text was translated immediately into English at Mendelssohn’s request and the world premiere of the oratorio took place in English at Birmingham under the baton of the composer. While performances of almost everything are now done in their original language, I cannot believe that there will ever be any pressure in the English-speaking world for Elijah or Mendelssohn’s Hymn of Praise to be performed in German. Mendelssohn oratorios in English are a permanent part of the great English choral tradition.\n\nWe have included the words to four songs in the appendix: “And King Olaf heard the cry”; “Song of the open”; “Rose of Killarney”; and “Ochone! When I used to be young.” They all contain either dialect or archaic English or are difficult to hear clearly. The rest we hope you can follow easily without a libretto.\n\nThe producers of this set hope that you enjoy our selections and look forward to learning about our sins of omission and commission.\n\nStephen Clarke\n\nChair, Historic Singers Charitable Trust\n\nAdjunct Professor, Historical Recording, University of Toronto, Faculty of Music\n\nTenors from\n\nthe English School of Singing\n\nIn England, the artist who aspires to first-class occupation cannot sustain himself upon trash. He must be able to sing Handel, Mozart, Rossini; and this range implies almost all possible vocal and musical accomplishment.”\n\nHenry Fothergill Chorley, Athenaeum, No. 1058, 5 February 1848\n\nItalian influence on English singing\n\nIn 1799 the tenor Giacomo David pronounced: “There are only two singers in Italy, myself and the Englishman”. Obviously, by “singers” David meant “tenors”, and the Englishman in question was the tenor John Braham (c. 1774–1856), born John Abraham to a poor Jewish family in London. David heard Braham at La Scala, Milan, where he was singing in operas by Nicolini and Zingarelli with his current companion, the English soprano Nancy Storace (1766–1817), who had created the role of Susanna in Mozart’s Le nozze di Figaro. Both Braham and Storace had studied with the castrato Venanzio Rauzzini (1747–1810), a clever composer and sought-after singing teacher for whom Mozart had written the motet Exsultate, jubilate and the role of Cecilio in Lucio Silla. The Irish tenor and composer Michael Kelly, friend of Mozart and creator of Basilio in Le nozze, had also studied with Rauzzini in England before travelling to Naples to finish his musical education under Fenaroli and Aprile.\n\nLike the once flourishing French, German, and Russian schools of singing documented on old phonograph records, the “English” school (in which I would include many singers born in America or in the British Dominions) owed everything to the glorious Italian school. Giovanni Francesco Grossi, known as Siface, had sung privately to Queen Mary in London in 1688, but the real influence of Italian singing on English singers began in 1692, when Margarita de l’Épine arrived in London and began her thirty-year career there, during which she sang with the castrato Nicolino (Nicolò Grimaldi) in the first opera to be sung entirely in Italian in London, Almahide by Marco Antonio Buononcini (1710). In that same year Handel arrived in London and in 1711 staged his Rinaldo; a connoisseur of Italian singing, Handel brought to London such star singers as Durastanti, Cuzzoni, Faustina Bordoni Hasse, Senesino, Carestini, and Caffarelli. As was happening all over Europe, London was invaded by Italian singing teachers who willingly gave up their sunny home climate for the sake of the possibility of earning fortunes teaching their art to the nobility of the foggy British Isles. The first, and one of the most important of these, was Pier Francesco Tosi (c. 1650–1730), an admired concert singer and composer of elegant cantatas, who gave his first London concerts in 1693 and published his famous treatise Opinioni de’ cantori antichi e moderni, o sieno osservazioni sopra il canto figurato in Bologna in 1723. He lived and taught for many years in London, where his pupil John Ernest Galliard published an English translation of the treatise in 1743. During the eighteenth century many singers, including the most famous castrati, found it worth their while to give singing lessons to English dilettanti. While he was in London, the eight-year-old Mozart studied with Giovanni Manzuoli, known as Succianoccioli (1725–c. 1782), and also with Giusto Ferdinando Tenducci (c. 1736–1790), whose career was long and influential; Dr. Charles Burney (1726–1814) reported that Tenducci “had a rapid effect upon the public taste, and stimulated to imitation all that were possessed of good ears and flexible voices.” Other castrati who taught in England included Giuseppe Millico, Gasparo Pacchierotti, Giambattista Velluti, and the last of all, Paolo Pergetti (a pupil of Girolamo Crescentini) who published a treatise on singing in London in 1857. Rossini and other composers deigned to give singing lessons, and Domenico Corri and Niccolò Vaccaj published their celebrated Methods for dilettanti, the former in Edinburgh, the latter in London.\n\nIn the nineteenth century Giuditta Pasta taught two celebrated contraltos, Mary Shaw and Elizabeth Masson, as well as the soprano Adelaide Kemble. Mrs. Shaw enjoyed considerable success in Italy (the pronunciation of her name defeated the Italians, who referred to her as “La Sav”), creating the role of Cuniza in Verdi’s Oberto. In 1841, Henry Fothergill Chorley (the most perceptive and informative of English musical critics) declared that Miss Masson’s performance of ‘Sommo ciel’ from Zingarelli’s Giulietta e Romeo at a Philharmonic Concert “could not be praised too much for dramatic conception, grandeur of style, and finish of execution. It was, in brief, the most admirable piece of singing by an English woman we ever heard.”1 The aria in question was one of Pasta’s great interpretations, passed down to her pupil.\n\nTechnique and style\n\nWhat did English singers learn from their Italian teachers and models? Edward Lloyd, who, like many tenors featured in this set, was trained entirely by English choir masters, was praised for his legato singing, said to rival that of the Italian tenor Antonio Giuglini, and a command of legato is typical of almost all the tenors we have chosen to include here. English singers worked to master breath control, full development and blending of the registers, beauty and steadiness of tone, smoothness and spontaneity of emission, clear and meaningful articulation of the words, accuracy of execution, and a broad spectrum of vocal color and dynamics. Dame Joan Sutherland used to encapsulate her advice to singers into the rule: “Breathe, support, project!” This was fully understood by the tenors we have chosen. Listeners who hear these old recordings for the first time —some of them more than a hundred years old—will be surprised by the consistency with which the singers employ rubato, portamento, and flexibility of tempo. In his two remarkable books Early Recordings and Musical Style (Cambridge University Press, 1992) and Performing Music in the Age of Recording (Yale University Press, 2004) Robert Philip analyzes many examples of historical recordings, mostly instrumental. He usefully defines three different kinds of rubato (Early Recordings and Musical Style, pp. 38–44) and on pp. 111–112 he succinctly, and sympathetically, describes Patti’s rubato effects in “Voi che sapete”, comparing her style with that of the great violinist Ysaye. Robert Philip’s work explains the reasons behind the singing style of John Coates or John McCormack: they sang the way that Elgar conducted, or that Lamond played the piano. In his book Style in Singing (New York, G. Schirmer, 1911), W.E. Haslam, teacher of the great soprano Florence Easton, dedicates considerable space to defining and explaining “tradition”, meaning the artistic use of phrasing, variations of tempo, portamento, and embellishments, quoting several examples of the personal style of Sims Reeves, Tietjens and other singers in the Messiah, and other works. He declares that “these ornaments and interpolations are not added from a vulgar idea of correcting or improving the composer’s music, but are strictly in accordance with certain conventions thoroughly understood by both composer and singer. To omit them, or to follow too closely the printed text, would be to ignore the epoch, school, and character of the music…”.\n\nChorley, reviewing an Antient Concert in 1841, reported: “A pleasant part of our task remains: to express high appreciation of our own singers—Miss Birch [soprano], Miss M. B. Hawes [contralto], Mr. Harrison [tenor] (who sang beautifully), Mr. Bennett [tenor], and Mr. Phillips [bass]. The three former, in particular, sustained their places by the side of the Italians in a manner to leave nothing to be desired …”.2 The “Italians” taking part in the concert included Giulia Grisi, Fanny Persiani, Pauline Viardot-Garcia, Rubini, and Lablache! In 1846 Mendelssohn conducted the first performance of his Elijah at the Birmingham Festival, and, at rehearsal, the tenor Charles Lockey sang the aria “Then shall the righteous” so very beautifully “that I was obliged to collect myself to prevent my being overcome, and to enable me to beat time steadily.”3\n\nSims Reeves\n\nFrom 1847, when he re-appeared in London after “finishing” his vocal studies with Giulio Marco Bordogni in Paris and Alberto Mazzucato in Milan, until his farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall in 1891, the tenor John Sims Reeves (1818–1900) represented all that was best in English singing: “His voice had become a pure high tenor of delicious quality, the tones vibrating and equal throughout.” During his early career Reeves often sang Lucia di Lammermoor, La sonnambula, and was even announced in I puritani, but in 1864 Theodor Wachtel sang Arnold in Guillaume Tell at Covent Garden, and Mr. Chorley made some illuminating comparisons: “[Wachtel] riots in his immense and resonant upper chest-notes, flinging out the C in alt, which M. Duprez and Signor Tamberlik were used to reserve for great occasions, again and again, as prodigally as if it was the common work-a-day high C, which used to be the limit of the average English tenor’s voice, and this in a time when the diapason was lower than now. Neither Braham nor Mr. Sims Reeves got, or gets, beyond A; and the latter has to make his point in “Sound an alarm” and the “War Song” of Signor Costa’s Eli, by artful preparation and management.”4 The highest note in Costa’s “War Song” is, in fact, A. What Mr. Chorley meant by “the common work-a-day high C” seems to have been the kind of brilliant head note that Heddle Nash sings in his famous record of the Serenade from The fair maid of Perth, an exemplary high C in voix de tête of the kind that Rossini would have liked, and a very different sound from the full-voiced high C offered by Tudor Davies in the “Song of the open” (CD 1, Track 19). We learn from Mr. Chorley that Reeves had refused the role of Jean in Le prophète, and: “In this we hold him wise; the music does not suit his voice, demanding falsetto notes, which he is judicious in not giving”.5 Here, too, by “falsetto” Mr. Chorley means ringing head notes of the kind he had heard from Nourrit and the French school.\n\nMaster of the differing styles of Italian, German, French, and English opera, oratorio and concert, and parlor music, Reeves continued to perfect his technique, as we can read in Chorley’s criticisms, which increase in enthusiastic praise year by year. The 1914 edition of Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians says of Reeves:\n\nIn the quarter of a century during which his voice was at its best, he sang on the orchestra with Jenny Lind, Clara Novello, Tietjens, Adelina Patti and Christine Nilsson, and held his own with them all. Assuredly none but a great artist could have done that. Even in his vocal decay there was nothing harsh or ugly. He never sang off the key, and even when he was nearly seventy his legato singing was a model of steadiness and breath management. The expression ‘voice colouring’ was not much used in Sims Reeves’s day, but of the art implied in the words he was a past master. No one could with greater certainty find the exact tone to fit the most varied emotions.6\n\nIn his Thirty Years of Musical Life in London, 1870–1900 (Heinemann, London 1903), Herman Klein opines that “A more exquisite illustration of what is termed the true Italian tenor quality it would be impossible to imagine; and this delicious sweetness, this rare combination of ‘velvety’ richness with ringing timbre, he retained in diminishing volume almost to the last.” During his long career, Reeves would not hesitate to cancel performances if he—or rather his wife—felt that he was not in his best voice. In his early days this frequent failure to appear led to some hostility from his devoted public, but the publisher William Boosey relates an amusing incident that took place when Reeves once presented a new song: “The song had a most unfortunate title. Longfellow’s two first lines began as follows: ‘Stay, stay at home, to stay at home is best, / Home-keeping hearts are the happiest.’ …a roar of laughter went all round the hall, and he was compelled to come to a dead stop. He looked round in amazement, and could not think what had made people laugh.”7\n\nPerhaps English singers in general lacked one qualification that stood high on Verdi’s list of requirements: unlike Maria Malibran, they did not have il diavolo in corpo—they were not “possessed by the Devil”. Chorley blames this on the habit of politely subdued conversation imposed by polished English society: “it has cost the world many an impressive and interesting artist.” Jane Austen, in Mansfield Park, mentions these restrictions imposed by polite society, referring to: “the raw efforts of those who have not been bred to the trade: a set of gentlemen and ladies, who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum to struggle through.” Even today the sight and sound of a family engaged in “social intercourse”—all members talking at once, often to the accompaniment of a television set at full blast—remind us that the exercise in making oneself heard thus obtained in formative years might well lead to the development of volume of tone, security in vocal projection and spontaneity of expression!\n\nA living tradition—oratorio\n\nAlthough Sims Reeves made no recordings, his example inspired many a would-be successor. We shall hear that many of the tenors featured in this set have in common some fundamental aspects of the Victorian musical style. We shall hear examples of breath control, immaculate legato, flawless vocal emission, fine phrasing, artistic coloring, skillful management of the registers, beautiful diction, even some fiery temperament and a few examples of brilliant florid execution, all in a repertoire that English tenors were obliged to have at their fingertips. The schooling of English singers has always begun with Handel, and generations of tenors have practiced their agility in his arias so as to be able to sing profitably in the frequent performances of the Messiah; until the middle of the twentieth century Israel in Egypt, Jeptha, Judas Maccabaeus, and Samson were also their daily bread. This led to an interesting situation when the Rossini-Renaissance began, for English and, particularly, American tenors were easily found who could manage Rossini’s florid passages, while their Italian colleagues, brought up on heavy diets of Verdi and Puccini, had to work hard to catch up with them. Like Reeves, some of our featured tenors sang in opera as well as oratorio, and their performances of songs and ballads gained solidity and conviction from the addition of something from both the sober sacred style and the extrovert style of the theater.\n\nIn Hints on Singing, Manuel Garcia describes the different styles of singing. The Canto spianato would be the basic noble and solemn style for oratorio:\n\nThis, the noblest of all styles (but also the least lively on account of slowness of movement and simplicity of form), is based entirely on the degrees of passion and the variety of musical light and shade. The chief resources of this style (and nothing can replace them) are perfect intonation, steadiness of voice, propriety of timbre, clear and expressive articulation, swelled sounds of every kind, the most refined effects of piano and forte, the portamento, and the tempo rubato. This style, although the least favorable to rapid fioriture, admits of the use of the appoggiatura, turns, and shakes. Other ornaments, if employed, should harmonize with the slowness of its movement and the gentle nature of its expression. It is hardly necessary to remark that though brilliant passages are inappropriate, it is equally imperative to avoid heaviness and dragging. In cantabile movements most phrases begin piano. Time must be kept, but not accented. In quick movements, on the contrary, time should be marked. These rules are rigorously applied to Larghi and Adagi. The other slow movements, such as Cantabile, Maestoso, Andante, etc., though retaining a certain gravity, are much modified by borrowing from the florid style.8\n\nOratorio recordings: Handel and Mendelssohn\n\nHad Garcia been able to add a supplement of recordings to his book, he might have shared our enthusiasm for John Harrison’s 1906 performance of the recitative “Deeper, and deeper still” from Jephtha, which satisfactorily fulfills many of the requirements set down by Garcia (CD 2, Track 7). Although he enjoyed a career in opera, Harrison is mainly remembered as a concert and phonograph singer, especially of ballads: his “Mattinata” of Leoncavallo was a best-seller in 1904–1905. His voice is an unremarkable but pleasing lyric tenor, effortlessly produced, with clear diction and exemplary pronunciation of English. He has thoroughly grasped the style required, handed down by tradition more than by textbooks such as Garcia’s, and so detailed is his “composition” of this recitative (as Mr. Chorley might have said) that we may believe it to be an echo of the Reeves version, which, in turn, probably closely followed Braham’s interpretation. To follow it with the score is illuminating: he maintains a flowing legato style throughout, but with only a few obvious portamenti—one comes on “Horrid thought!” He begins quietly, singing the opening verses with deep feeling, placing the accent on the syllables that should be stressed rather than slavishly observing the exact values of the printed notes, just as Garcia instructs us to do in Italian recitative. He skillfully manages the progression from pianissimo to crescendo to forte at “Oh! let me whisper it to the raging winds”. He includes nearly all the appoggiaturas. The ascent to A-flat above the stave, fortissimo, at “That lash me into madness” is thrilling, followed immediately by the soft, almost choked with emotion “Horrid thought! My only daughter!” and this great performance ends movingly on the pianissimo “I can no more!”\n\nIt is interesting to hear how Heddle Nash, as late as 1931, closely follows a tradition that was still being handed down. With a more beautiful timbre than Harrison, he succeeds in capturing the same style, singing with considerable skill in shading and contrast and with the required freedom of rhythm and broad phrasing (CD 3, Tracks 9 and 10). Harrison’s is, however, the more deeply committed and satisfying interpretation, and Nash’s pronunciation of English is slightly mannered. Where Nash triumphs is in the aria “Waft her, angels”, which by tradition is sung after the recitative “Deeper, and deeper still”, although the two numbers come from different parts of the oratorio. Harrison stumbles a little over the phrases rising to the high A, whereas Nash offers a flawless execution of the piece, a model of the easier Handelian florid style, all the intervals cleanly defined within a sustained legato.\n\nThe importance of mastering the delivery of Handel’s recitatives is illustrated by the moving description of the elderly Braham’s singing [in Israel in Egypt] in “The Recollections of Mr. Joseph Heywood”, published in the Cornhill Magazine in December 1865 and quoted in Sims Reeves, Fifty years of Music in England by Charles E. Pearce:\n\nA little, thick-set man, with a light brown wig all over his eyes, got up to sing one single line of recitative. He stood with his head well on one side, held his music also on one side, and far out before him gave a funny little stamp with his foot, and then proceeded to lay in his provision of breath with such a tremendous shrug of his shoulders and swelling of his chest that I very nearly burst out laughing. He said ‘But the children of Israel went on dry land’ and then paused; and every sound was hushed throughout that great space; and then, as if carved out upon the solid stillness came those three little words ‘through the sea’. Our breath failed and our pulses ceased to beat and we bent our heads as all the wonder of the miracle seemed to pass over us with those accents—awful, radiant, resonant, triumphant. He sat down while the whole house thundered its applause.9\n\nLamperti said that some voices have vibrato, others have not: both the acoustic recording horn and the electric microphone may tend to exaggerate the vibrato in some voices. The even and light vibrato in Dan Beddoe’s lovely, steady and Italianate voice does not draw undue attention to itself. (In Beddoe’s acoustic Victor recordings, made in 1911, the vibrato is much more prominent, even to the point of causing some purists to raise their eyebrows, but this marked vibration does not sound like a technical defect, and it is noticeably less virulent when he sings softly—and most beguilingly.) In the arias from Elijah (CD 1, Tracks 1 and 2), recorded when Beddoe was sixty-five years old, the one sign of old age in “Then shall the righteous” is the slight effort he has to make to sustain the last high A on “shine forth” (though the A does indeed shine). The voice is still young and fresh, perfectly supported on the breath, responsive to the singer’s every desire to modulate. His enunciation is not only clear and correct, but a beautiful thing in itself, reminding us of Queen Victoria’s praise of Clara Butt: “I have never liked the English language before, but in your mouth it is beautiful.” His diction is perfectly natural, almost—but not quite—like spoken English, showing us the correct pronunciation of the word “righteous” and how much to sound the “r” in “their heavenly father’s realm”. Beddoe had made his concert debut in about 1883, when the prevailing oratorio style would have been after the fashion of Edward Lloyd. By 1928, when he recorded for Brunswick, he seems to have deliberately modernized his style to comply with post-war fashions, reducing portamento to a minimum. His manner is noble, broad, manly, meaningful, and always throbbing with life, even when he produces a haunting piano in “Oh! That I knew where I might find Him”. He sings some very discreet and perfectly controlled portamento in “Then shall the righteous”, but there is no portamento at all in “If with all your hearts” until the very last repetition of “Ye shall ever surely find me”. He sings “If with all your hearts” easily and without undue urgency, stressing “Thus saith our God” without exaggeration and using plenty of almost imperceptible rubato. When he introduces a pause between phrases or lingers lovingly on the high A in the fourth bar from the end, the pianist is with him and we recognize “traditional” phrasings. Each repeated listening will reveal new beauties in these two outstanding recordings.\n\nWalter Glynne was a successful tenor whose adoring radio audiences were accustomed to hearing him in lighter fare, which he sang with elegance and charm. He offers here one of the few performances on 78s of the sequence from the Messiah “Thy rebuke hath broken His heart … Behold and see … He was cut off … But Thou didst not leave”, which is Victorian in its movingly solemn and decorous simplicity, its beautiful enunciation of the text, its extremely free time, not only in the recitatives, and its total commitment to the drama and the music. Glynne inserts all the appoggiaturas (CD 2, Tracks 1-4).\n\nGrove’s Dictionary mentions Reeves’s brilliant delivery of Handel’s “The enemy said”: “… his greatest triumph was achieved at the Handel Festival at the Crystal Palace in 1857, when … he gave ‘The enemy said’ in Israel in Egypt with such remarkable power, fire, and volume of voice, breadth of style, and evenness of vocalization, as completely electrified his hearers.” At the 1891 Handel Festival this fiendishly difficult aria fell to the lot of Edward Lloyd, of whom Bernard Shaw reports: “On the last day the principal singers were at their worst. Lloyd was obviously out of sorts, and fought hard but vainly against having to repeat ‘The enemy said’. Nevertheless, he fully sustained his reputation …”.10 Let us listen to Charles Saunders, who was also famous for his interpretation of this aria after Reeves sang it no more (CD 3, Track 17). The voice on this rather primitive G&T recording of 1906 is not a thing of great beauty; one might say, a serviceable, light voice, correctly produced, solid and steady. The high A sounds very much like the topmost note of the voice, though, like many of his contemporaries, he may have been able to sing higher using head voice. If the effect envisaged by Handel were really “power, fire and volume”, then Saunders has not these to offer, but—the execution! This rare record by a forgotten Cornish tenor represents the most extraordinary example of accurate florid tenor singing, in a particularly awkwardly written aria, ever preserved by the phonograph. The fluidity, ease and precision of the passagework are amazing. For volume and vibrancy in Handelian agility we must turn to Evan Williams in “Sound an alarm”. Arthur Jordan tackles Handel’s demanding florid passages in “How vain is man” from Judas Maccabaeus, his forceful delivery and clean definition of every interval verging upon what Sir Henry Wood called the “sledge-hammer” method of articulating coloratura (CD 2, Track 23). Jordan is trying to reproduce the Handelian version of agilità di forza, and despite the unlovely tone, with a vibrato suggesting tightness of the throat, in a live performance such vigorously clear articulation must have been impressive. He manages a dreamier tone in the quiet middle section. A more pleasing demonstration of the correct way to articulate agilità di forza in Handel’s music is given by Herbert Teale in a truly splendid performance of the recitative “He that dwelleth in heaven”, delivered with biting scorn but without exaggeration, and the aria “Thou shalt break them” from the Messiah; yet another example of a forgotten singer furnishing a model from which all tenors might learn (CD 3, Track 18).\n\nWalter Widdop’s Handel recordings have been greatly admired. His best virtuoso Handel performance is “Love sounds the alarm” from Acis and Galatea, accurate in execution (apart from the fudged downward run after the sustained D on the word “prize”) though he sings throughout at full volume, ignoring the opportunities for contrast (CD 3, Track 23). Even better is “Where’er you walk” from Handel’s Semele, a lovely record in which Widdop’s singing approaches very near perfection, especially in the first strophe, for this flowing, pastoral music does not over-tax his resources. His mastery of a smooth legato is immediately apparent and his pronunciation of the English language is a model—how beautifully he sings the dipthonged “a” in the word “shade”! His upper F and G are flawlessly produced with ringing but unforced tone in mixed register. In the repeat he sings slightly more loudly, and here the vibrato is less pleasant. His accompanist, the composer Percy Kahn, plays exquisitely in the same broad and free style adopted by Widdop (CD 3, Track 24).\n\nEdward Lloyd was the great Victorian concert tenor, described by the Italian conductor Giulio Roberti, who heard him at the Crystal Palace in the Handel Festival of 1885, as “a true revelation for me; he possesses absolute beauty of voice, a flawless method, together with accent and expression full of truth and effect.”11 Herman Klein reproduces a letter written by the conductor Léon Jehin in 1891 after hearing Lloyd sing an aria by Gluck and the Prize Song from Die Meistersinger: “The tenor was perfect. He has a beautiful voice, admirable diction, refined style; and one feels that he knows how to sing this kind of music, so broad and dignified in its simplicity.”12 In his Thirty Years of Musical Life in London, 1870–1900, Klein declares that “Edward Lloyd’s is one of those pure, natural voices that never lose their sweetness, but preserve their charm so long as there are breath and power to sustain them. His method is, to my thinking, irreproachable and his style absolutely inimitable … he could declaim Wagner with a beauty of tone, a fullness of dramatic expression, and a clarity of enunciation that used to make his German audiences in London shout for very wonder and delight.”13 It was all very well for Klein in 1903 to rave about Lloyd’s voice never losing its sweetness, but in the records he began to make in 1904, four years after his retirement, that voice seems to be out of practice and not perfectly responsive, a lot of hard labor and not much charm going into the business of singing a song, though one cannot but admire the singer’s boyish enthusiasm and brio. He has lost tone in the lowest notes and frequently resorts to upward transposition. His high tenor may have suffered from frequent concert performances of long “bleeding chunks” from Wagner. An authoritative guide indeed to mid and late Victorian taste, the old man can still make the rafters ring with Handel’s “Sound an alarm” or Stephen Adams’s “The holy city”. Bernard Shaw tells us that “Mr Edward Lloyd delivers his words better than many English singers”,14 and in the three volumes of Music in London, 1890–94 Shaw mentions him frequently, both to praise and to scold: “Edward Lloyd sang without a fault”; “Somehow, Mr Lloyd started sentimentally; tried a touch of jingoism at the climax, ‘Lohengrin’s my name’; rose to genteel piety for a moment; and finally relapsed into sentimentality. He sang well, and elicited shouts of ‘Bravo!’ (imagine anybody daring to say ‘Bravo!’ to a real knight of the Grail!); but he was not Lohengrin.” And, at the 1894 Handel Festival, after singling out Charles Santley for praise, he says: “Everyone else [including Melba!] broke down under these Handelian tests except Mr Lloyd, whose voice, homogeneous as it is from top to bottom, and charming as its color is, has not quite the beautiful firmness and purity of tone which the public has learnt the value of from Patti and Sims Reeves as well as from Santley.” A young tenor to whom I once played Lloyd’s Elijah records exclaimed in wonder: “What a magnificent old chap!” Lloyd adds a surprisingly vigorous and showy upward portamento on the first word of “If with all your hearts” that may well date back to early performances of the oratorio (William Green, in his 1901 recording, also introduces an upward portamento in the reprise of this phrase), and his soft singing is atmospheric and haunting (CD 3, Track 2). One of his most appealing records is “I’ll sing thee songs of Araby” from Frederic Clay’s cantata Lalla Rookh, in which Lloyd lays aside his silver trumpet for a few minutes “to charm us with a tear” and a lovely soft high A-flat (CD 3, Track 4). His intense commitment, vigorous phrasing and sweeping upward portamento on the first syllable of “Jerusalem” are very impressive in his record of “The holy city”, written for Lloyd by Stephen Adams (pen name of the baritone Michael Maybrick, a pupil of Gaetano Nava). This is still a favorite song in Britain, and I have heard it sung by the crowd at a football match—needless to say, without the portamento! (CD 3, Track 3).\n\nThe watchman scene, “The sorrows of death” from Mendelssohn’s Hymn of Praise, so sensitively declaimed by John Coates, is a precious indication of the elevated style achieved by the best interpreters of oratorio, making it easier for us to understand the great popularity of such sacred works in the nineteenth century, even though the music is somewhat below the quality we expect from so distinguished a composer (CD 1, Track 8). At a rapid tempo (set by the experienced oratorio conductor Allen Gill) Coates articulates clearly even such difficult phrases as “And Hell’s dark terrors had got hold upon me” without sacrificing anything of his smooth legato. The upper E-flat, E, and F are lovely notes, but the high A-flat of “I bring thee salvation”, while successfully resonant, reveals Coates’s baritonal origins: the highest notes were acquired only by assiduous study. The G-sharp on the last repetition of “Watchman, will the night soon pass?” should have been equally successful, but Coates makes the mistake of forcing the note, seeking volume rather than quality. The early phonograph did not take kindly to overblown high notes.\n\nA tenor of much lesser fame, Joseph Cheetham, was appreciated by Sir Henry Wood and sang both classical arias and modern ballads at the Promenade Concerts. His record of “Total eclipse” from Samson (CD 1, Track 7) (which Sims Reeves sang at his Farewell Concert) might stand as another model of the Victorian idea of Handelian style: the attack is firm and clean, the tone is pure and steady, a nicely executed diminuendo embellishes many of the sustained notes, there is a constant alternation of loud and soft (head) notes, as in the “echo effect” on “no sun, no moon”. The declamation is stately and grand, the enunciation clear and noble. What more could one ask for? A more beautiful voice, perhaps? But the forgotten Mr. Cheetham sings so well that he does not really need the luxury of a lovely timbre.\n\nAnother splendid piece of declamation in a more modern style is the rousing performance of Tudor Davies in “And King Olaf heard the cry” from Elgar’s King Olaf (CD 1, Track 17) His enunciation of the words is far from clear, and this must be attributed to a fault in vocal production, but despite this serious flaw the performance is stunning.\n\nEnglish opera\n\nRepeated attempts to establish a repertoire of English opera during the nineteenth century were never successful, largely because of the lack of good librettists, despite the talents of composers like Michael William Balfe and William Vincent Wallace (both Irishmen) and Weber’s pupil Sir Julius Benedict. An early example of trivial words set to rather appealing music comes with the song “The pilgrim of love” from Sir Henry Bishop’s “opera” The Noble Outlaw; these operas were like opéra-comique or Singspiel, burdened with impossible spoken dialogue. John Harrison declaims his recitative—“Orynthia! My beloved”—with suitable ardor, and is quite winning in the aria, including a virtuoso touch with his pianissimo lead into the repeat (CD 2, Track 9). Singing like this, technically assured, manly and yet touchingly expressive, was greatly appreciated by opera and concert audiences as well as in the domestic circle. The piano accompaniment is charmingly played by Madame Adami, one of the Gramophone Company’s regular accompanists. “There is a flower that bloometh” from Wallace’s Maritana and “When other lips” from Balfe’s The Bohemian girl were for many years among the most popular of all operatic arias. Rather surprisingly, John McCormack adds no embellishments to “When other lips”, unlike earlier tenors such as Edward Lloyd and John Coates, but this 1914 recording shows him at the height of his powers, singing easily with warm and pure tone in a taxing song that reveals his complete control of the passaggio di registro: his attack on the upper G-flat is always delicately ringing. The second stanza opens with “When coldness or deceit shall slight”, clearly articulated—even the consonant “c” of “coldness” seems limpid (CD 3, Track 5)! John Harrison’s accomplished singing of “There is a flower that bloometh” may also stand as a classic example of how “Victorian ballads” ought to be sung (CD 2, Track 8). Harrison’s song records include many fine examples of poised tone and fluent execution of florid passages, surprising\n\nperhaps from a tenor whose repertoire included Wagner.\n\nArthur Goring Thomas (1850–1892) had such a success with Esmeralda, dedicated to Pauline Viardot, composed for the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1883 and revived in French at Covent Garden in 1890 with Melba, Jean de Reszke and Lassalle, that his early death was a great setback for English opera. The lovely aria sung by Phoebus in Act 2, “O vision entrancing”, became a concert favorite recorded by many excellent tenors, and with spectacular success by Tom Burke (CD 1, Track 5). Burke can coo like the turtle dove or roar like the lion, and here he alternates both methods with taste and skill. How deliciously he phrases “O vision entrancing! O lovely and light, My heart at thy dancing grows faint for delight.” Lovely and light, indeed, and how appealing are his boyish tone and limpid enunciation. Then he opens out for the A-flat on “My angel in heaven”, producing the flood of burnished tone that we expect only from Italian tenors. The high ending, with soft but properly produced and ringing tones on the upper G-flat and A-flat, contrasts with his treatment of “My dreams”, a model of interpretation of Tosti. Would that all modern singers could learn from it! What a magnificent effect he prepares, by singing most of the song in a haunting, light and dreamy tone, then going into overdrive for the finale, “I shall love you the same forever”, with a rousing high B-flat (CD 1, Track 6). This extraordinarily talented young man, who began a promising international\n\ncareer singing with Toti Dal Monte in Italy and with Melba at Covent Garden, never realized his full potential. (I heard him sing at a concert given by his pupils in London in 1962; at seventy-two he could still produce the “lion’s roar”.)\n\nCharles Villiers Stanford wrote a lot of pleasing vocal music. The tragi-comic song “Ochone! When I used to be young” from Shamus O’Brien, another opera with spoken dialogue, was written for the celebrated tenor, Joseph O’Mara, and is printed as an appendix to the vocal score. O’Mara was less than enthusiastic about accepting the role of peasant farmer, Mike Murphy, which consisted of more comic acting than singing; so Stanford obligingly wrote him this aria (CD 3, Track 14)! O’Mara’s creator record of the song is a delightful piece of vocal characterization, well sung with a boyish timbre and clear, unfettered diction.\n\nWalter Glynne’s record of the “Drinking Song” from Sullivan’s last successful light opera The Rose of Persia is an excellent example of how English singers continued to apply classical style and technique to lighter works through the nineteen-thirties, achieving performances of considerable distinction (CD 2, Track 5).\n\nTudor Davies sang in the first performances of Vaughan Williams’s Hugh the Drover in 1924, and left a vivid recording of the “Song of the road”. Fine schooling is at once apparent, with easy ascents to rousing high notes, but when he overexerts himself and pushes the tone in the medium range, the timbre sounds throaty and sustained notes are unsteady. We have chosen a perhaps even finer performance of this song (so typical of early twentieth century English composers) by James Johnston, a tenor who seems to have begun his professional career unusually late in life (CD 2, Track 18). The voice is forward and responsive in the quick “patter” sections, with clear and charming enunciation (probably mastered in the grueling school of Gilbert and Sullivan opera), and he sails with ease to the high notes without any discrepancy between the sound of the chest and the head registers. While allowing himself plenty of space to “show off” his brilliant, Italianate high notes, he vaunts an equalized scale, and never forces the tone.\n\nA forthright and yet warmly romantic performance of “The English rose” from Edward German’s operetta Merrie England comes from the ever reliable Webster Booth, a radio favorite for forty years: a lyric tenor who, like Tito Schipa, never forced a note and whose lovely voice caressed all he undertook, from opera to light popular songs (CD 1, Track 3). In oratorio or opera, apparently rather overawed by the solemnity of the occasion, he could slightly spoil the effect of his otherwise flawless singing by affecting what he evidently hoped was a suitably dignified enunciation (an Oxbridge accent, perhaps?), but in “The English rose” his easily flowing legato is unspoiled by mannerisms, and the climax of the song is built up without any showy trumpeting of high notes. He is equally satisfying in the atmospheric “Faery song” from Rutland Boughton’s hugely successful—for a time—The Immortal Hour (CD 1, Track 4). Booth made over 500 records, and among them there must be many exemplary performances: his “All hail, thou dwelling pure and lowly” from Faust is notable for the contrast between the warm medium register and the brilliant high notes, each note perfectly focused and placed. (On YouTube we can see him in a Pathé Newsreel, singing—with disarming ease and perfect naturalness—a song called “The world is mine”.)\n\nSongs—Welsh tenors\n\nBen Davies rose to celebrity in the eighteen-nineties, singing in opera and operetta. Records made when he was seventy-five years old reveal the solid foundations of his technique and a still vigorous voice. The early records—he was G&T’s first successful star recorder of classical song, from 1901—show a beefy, baritonal voice with an upward extension via head voice, most artistically and effectively employed in songs like Dibdin’s “Tom Bowling” and Bishop’s “My pretty Jane” (CD 1, Track 15), in which his florid ornaments are perfectly turned, and his use of head voice adds a magical touch to an already agreeable song. John McCormack thought that the middle notes of Ben Davies’s voice were among the most beautiful he ever heard in his life. Herman Klein (in Thirty Years of Musical Life in London) calls him “a singer whose rare musical instinct and intelligence have always partially atoned for his uneven scale and his lack of ringing head-notes”, so his alternating of sturdy baritonal booming with a much frailer head voice cannot always have been as effective as it seems in some of his early song recordings. Every now and then the Gramophone Company remembered his concert fame and early recorded successes, and invited him back to the studio. In 1923–1924, at sixty-four, he recorded some attractive examples of Elizabethan songs, together with Purcell’s “I attempt from love’s sickness to fly” (CD 1, Track 16), notably accurate for such a heavy voice, and with a considerable degree of skill in modulation still remaining. He exemplifies a Victorian “no nonsense” school of singing, with the addition of some exquisite graces.\n\nHirwen Jones was born in 1857, one year before Ben Davies. He enjoyed a successful career as “heir to the throne” to Edward Lloyd. He was a neighbor of Patti’s in Wales, sang in her concert tours, and is believed to have helped persuade her to record her voice. His own records, little known even to collectors, are gems of the finest kind of Victorian tenor singing. His warm, youthful, and attractively pure voice, its silver surface unscratched despite his busy career, floating on the breath and never forced, boasts a full development and blending of the registers, so his scale is perfectly equalized and he is able to take high notes with insouciance, either in full\n\nvoice or in a delicious piano. His execution of ornaments is accuracy personified. “Molly Bawn” (CD 2, Track 21), a witty song later immortalized by McCormack, is given a sentimental, yearning interpretation with exquisite effects in mixed voice, while the elegance of Balfe’s barcarolle “Goodnight, goodnight beloved” might well be worthy of Reeves himself (CD 2, Track 20). From the large number of tuneful songs by Stanford, Hirwen Jones recorded “The rose of Killarney” (CD 2, Track 22), in which his naturalness and aplomb and his gracefully easy ascents to the higher notes recall the elegance of Edmond Clément. Clément also comes to mind when we listen to Jones’s delightfully appealing record of Godard’s “Berceuse” from Jocelyn, a desert island disc indeed (CD 2, Track 19). Just like McCormack in his prime, Hirwen Jones illustrates what eighteenth-century Italian singing teachers meant when they declared: “The singer has no throat” (“Il cantante non ha gola”)!\n\nTudor Davies provides an example of the typical song specially written as an encore in “Song of the open” by the famous accompanist and singing teacher Frank La Forge, a pupil of Leschetitzky (CD 1, Track 19). The song, nothing but an enthusiastic outburst of tenorial energy, ends with a thrilling high C. In marked contrast, Davies offers a beautifully restrained and eloquent performance of “Do not go, my love”, by Richard Hagemann (CD 1, Track 18).\n\nIrish tenors\n\nDisappointingly, Joseph O’Mara made only three records, even rarer than the almost mythical G&Ts of Angelica Pandolfini, but all reproduced in this set, and at least they show him in both opera and song, demonstrating yet again how a naturally flowing voice production facilitates impeccably clear and limpid enunciation. O’Mara, whose voice is still relatively boyish and fresh after years of touring opera, recreates for us the atmosphere of the Victorian private evening concert featuring the great names of music: at the Duchess of Manchester’s soirée in 1899 he sang with Melba, Plançon, Kubelik, Paderewski, and Landon Ronald. Ronald was a fine songwriter, one of the most popular of his day, and the two songs committed to wax by O’Mara may well have been written especially for him. They are difficult to sing but effectively contrast the lower and higher registers of the tenor voice. Like Hirwen Jones or John McCormack, O’Mara is able to sail effortlessly up the scale without shouting or increasing the volume, yet giving full rein to the natural brilliance of the high notes. Accompanied by the composer in his usual flamboyant manner, he treats “Friend and lover” and “An April birthday” in grand style, his lovely voice and charming manner ideally scaled to the requirements of the salon. We willingly overlook a technical defect caused by unsteadiness of the recording turntable (CD 3, Tracks 15 and 16).\n\nJohn McCormack remains today not only the supreme tenor hailing from Ireland, but one of the very greatest concert artists of whom we have recordings. Charles Marshall’s touching “A child’s song” gives us a glimpse of the degree of perfection to which he had brought his voice and technique in 1912; he demonstrates three different ways of singing the high A-flat, first in an easy full voice, then in a delightful piano, and finally he sings an exquisitely perfect trill on the high G, resolving into the A-flat pianissimo (CD 3, Track 6). After his near-fatal bout of infection of the tonsils in 1922 McCormack avoided singing very high notes, but in the record of “Swans” by A. Walter Kramer, made the following year, the lovely, pure, Italianate timbre of his voice, the rounded and sustained vowels and his impeccably clear enunciation exert all their old fascination, though the soft high B-flat and A-flat are not as free of the throat as they once were (CD 3, Track 7). We can also enjoy the beautifully liquid consonants, the secret of which he shared with Melba and few others. The mere passage of time has no power to detract from the magnetic grip that McCormack exerts upon the listener.\n\nScottish tenors\n\nJoseph Hislop enjoyed a truly international career, singing in many of the world’s great opera houses. His records of French and Italian opera are idiomatic as well as excellently sung, while his song records give us a glimpse of another side of his art, as he is a master of the intimate shadings required by the concert repertoire. In “Afton water” (CD 2, Track 13) his virtuoso soft singing—“My Mary’s asleep by your murmuring stream”—and his lovely decorations are in the tradition of the great Scots tenor John Sinclair (1791–1857), who was famous for his embellishment of traditional folk melodies before he went to Italy to pursue an operatic career, culminating in his creation of the role of Idreno in Rossini’s Semiramide. In Pinsuti’s once popular song “Queen of the earth” (CD 2, Track 12), Hislop follows meticulously the composer’s intentions with a lovely legato line at the beginning of the second strophe, marked piano, and then fills out the tone impressively in the big tune, marked molto maestoso. This is one of those Victorian songs that are gushingly spiritual without being truly religious, their words and music timidly echoing some of the more exotic French salon songs. It is no surprise that Jüssi Björling relied on Hislop for technical advice throughout his career.\n\nEnglish tenors\n\nGervase Elwes was idolized by his colleagues; from an upper-class family, he struggled hard to perfect his singing, never stooping to performing “trash”. His art suggests, in the best possible way, the singing of the cultivated amateur (or should I say dilettante). A clear and aristocratic English pronunciation that sounds spontaneous and not artificial (and a joy to hear), a carefully cultivated legato and surprisingly brilliant high notes made him a gift to the English songwriters of his day. His record of Young’s “Phyllis has such charming graces”, arranged by H. Lane Wilson, might have been chosen particularly to show off how this great tenor had perfected the blending of the registers (CD 1, Track 22). In two contrasting songs by Roger Quilter, Elwes gives a beautiful performance of the serene “Now sleeps the crimson petal”, going on to a thrilling climax at the end of “Love’s philosophy”, the pellucid diction and unfailing legato crowned by a splendid high B-flat (CD 1, Tracks 23 and 24). In two songs that have survived into the modern tenor’s repertoire, Elwes makes a remarkably sensitive showing in “The roadside fire” by Vaughan Williams, (CD 1, Track 25), a record memorable both for his admirable treatment of Robert Louis Stevenson’s evocative words, and for his technical command of the passaggio di registro, his upper D-flat, E-flat, F, and G-flat being models of production, both soft and loud. In “Love went a-riding” by Frank Bridge (CD 1, Track 26), a rumbustious encore song, also recorded by Björling and Flagstad, Elwes for once disdains refinement and simply lets rip: highly satisfying. Unfortunately, Elwes recorded nothing from his legendary interpretation of Elgar’s Dream of Gerontius.\n\nElwes’s rival, John Coates, a more sophisticated and intellectual singer, who lived longer and made many more recordings, has a different kind of vocal technique that lacks some of the brilliance of Elwes and leads him at times into a little hoarseness, but his magnificent record of Mallinson’s striking “Eldorado” is a masterpiece of vocal coloring and shows his voice at its best (CD 1, Track 9). A marked contrast is Sir Frederick Cowen’s beautiful song “At the mid hour of night”, a setting of a moving poem by Thomas Moore. Interpretations such as these, with distinguished pronunciation of English and a perfect use of rubato, suggest that many songs scorned as “Victorian” might be worthy of serious re-appraisal by today’s concert artists. Balfe’s “Come into the garden, Maud” (CD 1, Track 10), composed for Sims Reeves, has never entirely left the tenor repertory, but few performances can have been so full of contrast—fire and dash alternating with languorous longing. Coates shows how to illuminate and bring out the best from such a song: each phrase has a slight but telling unwritten pause or stress that adds color to Tennyson’s poem. In Elgar’s “In the dawn” a difficult but atmospheric song, Coates shows his technical and musical mastery although some of the soft high notes, like the final high G-sharp, are not properly blended into the voice, but sound rather like someone else joining in. Interestingly, he uses more vibrato than usual in this song, obviously an interpretative choice (CD 1, Track 11). Some of his later records suffer from a wobble, probably induced by exposing a delicate voice to a strenuous career in opera as well as concert.\n\nLike Coates, Walter Hyde enjoyed a distinguished career in opera and oratorio, with frequent guest engagements abroad. He was a pupil of Gustave Garcia, the youngest son of Manuel Garcia II. “Our most elegant tenor … a fine voice, a personality, a clever actor … He is one of the most popular of living English singers.”15 Walter Hyde’s voice, a pleasing and well-trained lirico spinto with hints of the tenore drammatico, has a more noticeable vibrato than was then fashionable among English tenors, lending him almost an Italian sound. This vibrato is not in evidence when he sings softly in a lovely mezza voce, as in Sullivan’s song “Once again”, in which Hyde cleverly alternates between this silky piano and a rich, thrilling forte, skillfully moving between these two types of emission (CD 2, Track 15). His records are full of striking effects, whether pure and ringing attacks on high notes or ambitious shadings. John McCormack thought him one of the best Siegmunds he ever heard. Elgar’s beautiful song “Pleading”, written in 1908 for the “society” contralto Lady Maud Warrender, gives Hyde another opportunity to demonstrate how tenors of his generation were able to sing with effect both softly and loudly: the final phrases include a lovely crescendo and diminuendo effect (CD 2, Track 17). It would be difficult to imagine a better performance of this song, the style of which the pianist also grasps perfectly. In the Musical Times, December 1923, Hyde gave this advice to young singers: “Remember, beautiful diction means beautiful tone. And then there must be cultivated a feeling for pathos and humor, qualities which, of course, materially affect the primary tone.”\n\nSydney Coltham, a tenor employed by the Gramophone Company to record oratorio and song for the popular market, might serve as a model of canto legato for any singer; his words, beautifully and naturally enunciated, float on the breath. He reaches an enviable standard of imaginative virtuosity with his high soft singing in Hermann Löhr’s attractive ballad “Where my caravan has rested” (from his song cycle Romany Songs), a good example of how an unusually sensitive and poetic text could inspire a talented composer to create a gem of a song even in the now despised ballad form (CD 1, Track 13). Coltham’s well-trained, typically English, voice is heard at its best; this recording haunts the memory. His is also one of two authoritative recordings of “Ah, moon of my delight” (CD 1, Track 14) from the song cycle In a Persian Garden by Liza Lehmann. Hubert Eisdell’s record of this song has always been highly admired (CD 1, Track 21). Eisdell is helped by electrical recording, but he has to hurry the music slightly in order to include the recitative “Ah! Fill the cup!”. Both tenors are scrupulous in following the detailed dynamic markings in the score—Lehmann was herself a singer, a pupil of Jenny Lind, and knew what effects she wanted. Eisdell sculpts the difficult opening phrase, with its triplet on “my”, with striking neatness and clarity; Coltham is elegant without arriving at quite such satisfying precision. Coltham is the more successful in diminuendo passages, whereas it is Eisdell who lingers longer on a gleaming high A at “Through this same garden” (marked con espansione—more broadly); Coltham, however, excels in the piano phrases. Both execute portamento when it is asked for. Coltham wins in the very last phrase, rising to the high G pianissimo as marked, then fining it down still further in a virtuoso diminuendo. Today Eisdell’s would-be aristocratic pronunciation of English sounds mannered, whereas Coltham’s is ideally clear and natural. Both performances are superlative records of a great song.\n\nHubert Eisdell’s splendid record of “O dry those tears” is accompanied at the piano by the composer, Teresa del Riego (1876–1968), who is also responsible for the not very praiseworthy words: “’Twill come, alas! But soon ’twill pass” etc. (CD 1, Track 20). The sheet music of this song sold 23,000 copies within six weeks of publication! Madame del Riego has composed, one supposes especially for the phonograph, a soupy cello obbligato. Her playing, and Eisdell’s singing, furnish a kind of touchstone demonstrating the correct style in which to sing a ballad. The score is a document crowded with signs for the interpreter: “Quicker and hopefully”, “with feeling”, and so on. Eisdell and his distinguished accompanist not only execute nearly all these instructions, but they even manage to add much more in the way of unwritten rhythmic and dynamic variation. They show how to make the maximum effect with such a song, and del Riego’s grandiose manner at the piano is a study in itself. Eisdell offers flawless singing of considerable charm. He executes perfectly the turn in the phrase “Life is not made for sorrow”, pays attention to the instruction “ben legato” on the first phrase, then, on its repetition, he manages to make an even more seamless legato line even though he is, temporarily, avoiding the portamento. It is rather a pity that he “woos the gallery” by rising to a blatantly over-loud high A at the conclusion.\n\nMorgan Kingston was that rarity, an English dramatic tenor: a Manrico, a Samson. In quieter mood, Kingston recorded Tosti’s “Parted” (CD 3, Track 1). Perhaps not the possessor of a particularly beautiful voice, Kingston had been very well trained: “I have studied ten years on vocal technic and repertoire. I have not ventured to say so before, but I say it tonight—I can sing!”16—and sing indeed he can. No doubt he had listened carefully when singing in concert with Clara Butt and Tetrazzini. He is careful to produce limpid attacks on the beginning of every phrase, to pay attention to the roundness of the vowels, and the clear but unobtrusive sounding of the consonants. His legato is impeccable, his piano singing haunting, and altogether his version of “Parted” is a model of song singing. His singing is more forceful but equally polished in a favorite tenor song, “Onaway, awake beloved” from Coleridge Taylor’s Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast, an ambitious work once favored by choral societies (CD 2, Track 24).\n\nAnother English Tristan and Otello was Frank Mullings, a favorite singer of Sir Thomas Beecham and other connoisseurs. Very few of his many recordings satisfactorily explain his great fame to modern listeners, though his performance of the recitative “How vain and weak a thing is man” from Gounod’s Queen of Sheba is thrilling and may give some idea of what he could achieve in the theater. A technical flaw in his singing is the open sound of the vowels up to E natural, fourth space, contrasting too obviously with a much more “covered” and closed timbre from the F upwards. His record of Clutsam’s attractive song “I know of two bright eyes” is surprisingly delicate and winning; his attack is always pure and clear, the tone quite warm, with a light and unobtrusive vibrato (CD 3, Track 8). One feels, however, that he achieves the soft upper notes by closing the throat.\n\nMusic of a higher quality is represented by Heddle Nash in two songs by Delius, awkwardly written for the voice but containing some attractive phrases that Nash sings quite beautifully (CD 3, Tracks 11 and 12). This is one of his most memorable recordings, even though the ambitious rapid passing from fortissimo to pianissimo sometimes catches him out and the tone becomes throaty for a few notes—a troublesome flaw that the singer was never able to completely correct. (Nash talked quite honestly about his vocal problems when I heard him lecture, including a generous selection of songs, in Manchester in 1958.) His singing of Daisy McGeoch’s unpretentious yet somehow irritatingly haunting song “Two eyes of grey” is of surpassing beauty and technical skill; as late as 1933 his interpretation is still, very successfully, conceived in the same style as Ben Davies’s “My pretty Jane”, with much the same reliance on silvery head notes and a very free rhythm (CD 3, Track 13).\n\nCiro Pinsuti was one of many minor Italian composers who followed Gordigiani to London and made a lot of money turning out drawing-room ballads by the score. “Queen of the earth” is not a bad example, but “The last watch” comes near to being a truly great song. It is sung here, magnificently, by Miss Ruby Helder, “The Lady Tenor” (CD 2, Track 11). Ruby Helder wrote: “My great desire right through my career has been to be regarded seriously as a tenor … but there have always been people who wished to look upon me as a freak … The truth is that I possess a male larynx, and am able therefore to produce pure tenor notes.” Sir Charles Santley was so impressed by her voice that he taught her free of charge for seven years, so Ruby Helder, through her great teacher, belongs to the Garcia school of singing! The label of “The last watch”, her first published record for His Master’s Voice, describes her as a contralto. In 1911 she was only twenty-one years old. One collector friend, the late George Clayton, heard her sing in Manchester at a Tetrazzini concert: when she had finished singing Verdi’s “Quando le sere al placido” (!!) the portly diva rushed out from the wings to embrace her, and pretty, petite Ruby Helder disappeared from view into Tetrazzini’s ample bosom.\n\nThe career of the tenor Henry Wendon, a protégé of the folk-song collector Lucy Broadwood, seems to have been limited to Great Britain, where he sang Verdi, Puccini, and Wagner. In its day his record of Easthope Martin’s song “Come to the fair” (CD 3, Track 20) was a hit on the radio, and no wonder: this charming and exhilarating performance is based on a skillful command of a well-placed voice, brilliant and manly (perhaps inclined to be throaty), with easy high notes, and a winningly natural manner of enunciating the words. In “The road to the isles” (CD 3, Track 21), a sort of musical geography lesson on Scotland, the lively rhythmic sense and joyous spontaneity are again to the fore, together with some (not perfectly successful) soft singing that looks back to the chiaroscuro effects beloved of the previous tenorial generation.\n\nEdward Lloyd, Ben Davies, and others recorded Dibdin’s “Tom Bowling” when it was still popular: by the time Walter Widdop came to make his recording, the old song was passing out of fashion. He makes a brave shot at it, in something like the authentic style, although he has not mastered the head voice as Ben Davies did (CD 3, Track 22).\n\nSome consideration must be given to a unique attempt by the Decca Record Company to preserve an echo of Sims Reeves’s style by engaging Frank Titterton to study and record eight pieces from the Reeves repertory under the aegis of the pianist Arthur Fagge, who had accompanied Reeves in his later years, and who accompanies Titterton on these records. The results are of varied interest: Titterton was no longer, in 1931, the beguiling young tenor we hear in his acoustic Vocalion records. The voice is occasionally brilliant, but more often hoarse and throaty, the articulation of ornaments not clear-cut, the diction murky. However, in Davy’s “The Bay of Biscay” (CD 3, Track 19), an old favorite of Braham’s, singer and pianist work hard to re-create the interesting rhythmic elasticity and decorative interpolations that make each stanza different from the others, and the high notes are well taken. Herman Klein, however, who often heard Reeves sing this song, does not hesitate to ask (in his review of the records in the Gramophone): “Was Mr. Titterton really told to pronounce Biscay with an equal stress on both syllables, making the second rhyme with the letter K? I never heard it sung so before. Reeves used to give it the same sound as ‘whiskey’.” Reeves had “inherited” the song “The Bay of Biscay” from Braham, who could not resist wooing the gallery with songs of a naval and patriotic flavor. Reviewing a less-than-successful appearance of Sims Reeves in Rossini’s La donna del lago, Mr. Chorley accused both Braham and Reeves of allowing their taste for popular songs to contaminate the purity of their classical style:\n\nThere is no magic fountain in which a singer who has depreciated himself can dip and come out newly-refined when he needs it. He who has habituated himself to please, by executing bad music, must have made his effects unmusically…. Patches and passages of the finest declamation ever heard in England but imperfectly redeemed in Braham the twang, the shout, the coarse, hurried flourishes which, having adopted them to please the galleries, he could never wholly lay aside. His fanatical admirers will not forgive us for saying so, but there was (at least ever since we knew him) a ‘Bay of Biscay’ touch even in his fine recitative from Jeptha.17\n\nWilliam Green, who enjoyed a successful career in oratorio and concerts, made a handful of records for G&T in 1901. In the first stanza only of Braham’s dramatic ballad “The anchor’s weighed”, his style is recognizably the same as Titterton’s in “The Bay of Biscay”, but being better trained his execution of the ornaments is more accurate (CD 2, Track 6). Both tenors take their time, avoid metronomical regularity, and contrast loud and soft singing to considerable effect, both musical and dramatic. Green’s voice would perhaps be nobody’s favorite today, especially when his praiseworthy attempts to sing with a steady tone degenerate into a “fixed” and slightly out-of-tune sound on sustained notes, but his polished technique, clear enunciation, and imaginative interpretation are typical of the best British singers before the First World War.\n\nThe recent discovery of two out of a series of six extremely rare records made in London for Columbia in 1904 by Gregory Hast has given us the opportunity to include the voice of a regular and grateful pupil of Sims Reeves. Although Reeves was not considered a great teacher, he left an interesting and sensible singing method, The Art of Singing, London, Chappell & Co., 1900. In 1925 Hast also wrote a useful book, The Singer’s Art, by Harry Gregory Hast, London, Methuen & Co., containing a touching anecdote about Reeves:\n\nOnly a few weeks before he died I had my last lesson with him. The work I was studying was ‘Deeper, and deeper still’ and ‘Waft her, Angels’…. At the conclusion of my lesson he suddenly said ‘I’ll sing it to you’… and he stood in the middle of the big studio and … interpreted the song from beginning to end. I look back on that performance as, beyond comparison, the greatest piece of singing I ever heard.\n\nThe voice of Gregory Hast cannot be anything like that of Sims Reeves, for it has a very English rather than an Italianate sound. However, he has learned the secret of an immaculate legato wedded to the clear and musical enunciation of English, for which he was famous. In Godard’s “Berceuse” from Jocelyn he demonstrates considerable virtuosity in the head register. Though he was often accompanied by his wife, Madame Hast—a well-known concert pianist—it does not seem likely that it is she thumping the studio piano in this recording (CD 2, Track 10).\n\nThis concert by long departed tenors comes to a rousing conclusion with a thrillingly vigorous account of Handel’s “Sound an alarm” by the American tenor of Welsh parentage Evan Williams, another superb example of the accurate and polished execution that English-speaking tenors inherited from the early nineteenth-century Italians (CD 3, Track 25). Evan Williams enjoyed a successful career as a concert artist, paralleled by plentiful sales of a very long list of records, as his evenly produced tones suited the early recording horn. Some of his recurring vocal problems were resolved by the choral conductor, composer and singing teacher Jules Jordan, a pupil of Giovanni Sbriglia; so Evan Williams can claim to belong to the same distinguished school as Lillian Nordica, Jean and Edouard de Reszke, and Pol Plançon, Sbriglia’s most famous pupils. (It is interesting to note that in his record of “Sound an alarm” Edward Lloyd, brought up in the English Handel tradition, includes all the appoggiaturas in the recitative, whereas Evan Williams does not.)\n\nLet us leave the last word to Mr. Chorley, who might well have enjoyed Evan Williams, for in 1835 he welcomed Adelaide Kemble’s concert debut: “We traced a degree of animation and intelligence (though they were rather hinted than expressed) in Miss Kemble’s singing of ‘Se la vita’, from Semiramide, with Tamburini, which it gratified us much to hear in an English singer.”18\n\n©Michael Aspinall, 2020\n\nBritish Tenors Biographies\n\nBEDDOE, DAN\n\n(Aberdare, Wales, 1863 – New York City, 1937)\n\nDan Beddoe excelled as an oratorio and concert singer, although he did not achieve fame until he was over forty years old. His father was an assistant manager at a coal mine, where Dan was listed in the 1881 census as a coal miner. The boy’s voice attracted attention, and he received training as a tenor. At twenty-two, he won first prize at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, and for several years taught music at a local school.\n\nIn 1887, Beddoe traveled to the United States with “The Welsh Prize Singers”, performing for Welsh communities throughout the country. Back home a few months later, he married, then returned to the US with his bride. They settled in Cleveland, and five years later moved to Pittsburgh, where he secured excellent church positions and sang in local concerts and oratorio performances. He continued studying with noted teachers of singing during these years.\n\nBeddoe was thirty-nine when he was engaged to sing the prize song from Die Meistersinger with Walter Damrosch and the New York Symphony Society at the Pittsburgh Exposition in 1902. Impressed, Damrosch engaged him again for a New York concert in Carnegie Hall, and subsequently invited him to sing the part of Parsifal on tour with his Symphony. With Damrosch’s clear endorsement and enthusiastic press notices, Beddoe’s career was assured, and for the next twenty years his concert schedule was relentless. It was known that he was a quick study, and Beddoe often was the tenor of choice for contemporary works. In 1905 he sang his first of many performances with the New York Oratorio Society in the American premiere of Richard Strauss’s cantata Taillefer, and several years later sang one of the earliest American performances of Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde with the Cincinnati Symphony under Fritz Reiner.\n\nIn 1906, the Beddoe family moved to New York City, where he accepted the tenor soloist position at St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church, and later at the fashionable Grace Episcopal Church. In 1909, Beddoe was the tenor in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony with the New York Philharmonic under Mahler. His visit to the UK in 1911 and 1912 was his only extensive tour outside the United States, the high point being a performance of Elijah at the Crystal Palace. In 1919 he joined the faculty at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. Beddoe’s final appearance at the age of seventy-two was in New York in Handel’s Messiah in 1935. The New York Times wrote: “The serene loveliness of his ‘Comfort Ye’ was not dimmed.” He died in Manhattan in 1937, having sung with every major choral society and orchestra in the United States and Great Britain.\n\nConsidering Beddoe’s stature and immensely successful career, his discography of twenty-six recordings is pitifully small; between 1911 and 1928 he recorded five sides for Victor, one disc and one cylinder for Edison, four sides for Columbia, nine sides for the Rainbow label, and six electrically recorded sides for Brunswick.\n\nBOOTH, LESLIE WEBSTER\n\n(Handsworth, Staffordshire, England, 1902 – Penrhyn Bay, Wales, 1984)\n\nA concert and oratorio singer whose light, pleasing voice gained him tremendous celebrity with the British public through his many recordings and BBC broadcasts, Booth had a repertoire that was eclectic, ranging from opera and oratorio to operetta and musical comedy. Born Leslie Webster Booth, he joined the local parish church choir as a young boy and began studies at the Lincoln Cathedral choir school. When his voice broke at age thirteen, he returned home and studied to become an accountant, eventually taking a job with an accounting firm while continuing to sing in local concerts and oratorio performances.\n\nAt twenty-one, Booth auditioned as a chorister for the D’Oyly Carte Opera Company and was accepted. He left his job, making his professional debut in Yeoman of the Guard. After four years of singing small parts, he left the company to pursue a freelance career, shortening his stage name to Webster Booth. He was singing light music in restaurants and cabarets with occasional engagements to sing in oratorio performances when the Gramophone Company took notice of him. He made his first HMV recordings in 1929.\n\nBy 1935 his career was secure, with excellent record sales and numerous BBC broadcasts. That year he was chosen to sing in the Good Friday performance of the Messiah with the London Philharmonic. A month later he sang in Coleridge-Taylor’s Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast, the entire cast wearing full traditional dress! In 1938, he began singing concerts on the air with a soprano, Irene Francis Eastwood, whose stage name was Anne Ziegler. She became Booth’s third wife. They made their first of many HMV records a year later and were an overnight success. They gave numerous concerts during the War as “Sweethearts of Song”. By the early 1950s, British tastes were changing, and the couple’s popularity was beginning to wane. After two tours to South Africa in 1955 and 1956, they decided to settle there, and remained for twenty-two years. They returned to England in 1978 intending to retire, but discovered that their admirers had not forgotten them. They made both radio and television broadcasts and numerous concerts all over England. Booth died in 1984, aged eighty-two. Anne Ziegler died in 2003. Webster Booth made over 500 sides for HMV.\n\nBURKE, THOMAS ASPINALL\n\n(Leigh, Greater Manchester, 1890 – Carshalton, Surrey, 1969)\n\nUnlike many of the tenors in this collection, Tom Burke was an operatic tenor, and received some vocal training in Italy. He was the oldest of nine children. His father, who had come to England from Ireland, was a coal miner and was said to possess a fine voice. He encouraged Tom when Tom showed an aptitude for music. Burke was in school until the age of twelve, then took work in a silk mill, and later in the mines. Tom also played rugby and learned to box. The family managed to buy a piano, and as a teenager Tom took up both piano and cornet, joining the municipal band; he also sang in the church choir where his fine voice was noticed. By this time, he was working as an insurance salesman and waiting tables in the evenings. In his late teens, he attended the Manchester Musical College, and then the Royal College of Music.\n\nIt happened that a London impresario gave Burke enough money to travel to Italy to have lessons with Ernesto Colli in Milan. Showing considerable promise, he made his operatic debut as the Duke in Rigoletto at the Teatro dal Verme. He was, however, unable to continue his studies as he was obliged to return home to serve in the War early in 1918. But he failed his medical examination and in lieu of service performed in charity concerts until the end of the war. When the Royal Opera at Covent Garden re-opened in 1919, Burke sang opposite Nellie Melba in La bohème, and later that season he sang the tenor roles in Rigoletto, Madama Butterfly, and Il barbiere di Siviglia. The following season he sang in the first English performances of Gianni Schicchi and Il tabarro. That same year, he toured the United States, billed as “The Irish Tenor”. Although his first recital in Washington D.C. garnered excellent reviews, his success was only moderate. In 1927 he returned to England, appearing again at Covent Garden in Rigoletto and Cavalleria rusticana. From this point, he sang occasional concerts, but his career was on a downward path. During the 1930s he appeared in four films, and then vanished into obscurity. He recorded a generous selection of songs and operatic arias for American and English Columbia, and also made records for the Dominion and Electric Imperial labels.\n\nCHEETHAM, JOSEPH\n\n(Rochdale, Lancashire, 1875 – London, 1932)\n\nJoseph Cheetham had a mainly provincial career, and is now remembered almost solely by collectors through his recordings for Pathé and the Gramophone Company. His father was a prosperous grocer, and Joseph appears to have left school at about age twelve to become a grocer’s assistant. His first musical break came at age thirty in 1905, when he entered the Blackpool competition. There were 3,150 contestants with nine first prizes awarded. The tenor test piece was Beethoven’s “Adelaide”, and he won a first prize. The adjudicator was William Gray McNaught, who likely took Cheetham under his wing and helped him to gain entrance to the Manchester College of Music, where he studied with John Acton, a pupil of Francesco Lamperti.\n\nCheetham’s earliest billing located so far was in 1906 at Scarborough Aquarium, where he was described as “Joseph Cheetham, Lancashire tenor, who shows great vocal ability”. Newspaper notices from 1907 report Cheetham making appearances at a number of Bournemouth concerts under Dan Godfrey. In 1908, he sang in Mendelssohn’s St. Paul, one review stating his part was “… given with cultured power.” He continued singing in the provinces to enthusiastic acclaim. A review of a concert at Hull in November 1909 stated “Great is the attraction of a tenor with a masculine ring, and Mr. Joseph Cheetham is so endowed …. The only encore of the evening greeted him in ‘I hear you calling me’, whose jaded sentiment was almost lifted into dignity by the singer’s sincerity.”\n\nCheetham made his first London appearance in 1910 at one of the Polytechnic Popular Entertainments, soon after sharing the Queen’s Hall stage with Phyllis Lett, Thorpe Bates, and ’cellist W.H. Squire. At the time, he was often styled “Mr. Joseph Cheetham, tenor of the Royal Opera, Covent Garden”, although as yet we have found no confirmation for this claim. It was about then that he made his first recordings for Pathé. The next year, he made his Henry Wood Proms debut with two popular ballads, and the following year, he appeared in a supporting role for Nellie Melba at a concert in Guildford. He remained a regular in concerts throughout Britain, appearing again at the Proms twice in 1915 and twice in 1917, but by 1918 his career had devolved into that of a music hall entertainer. He retired from the stage early in 1928.\n\nCOATES, JOHN\n\n(Bradford, 1865 – London, 1941)\n\nSir Thomas Beecham, famous for sarcasm rather than compliments, wrote:\n\n[John] Coates was among the half-dozen most interesting artistic personalities of the time in England—scrupulous, fastidious and conscientious in all that he attempted. His appearance on the stage was noble and animated, and his voice, although of moderate power, was flexible and expressive. His diction was admirable and his singing of English an unalloyed pleasure to the ear.\n\nAs a boy Coates sang in a church choir directed by his father, later studying as a baritone in Yorkshire, London, and Paris. He was almost thirty when he was engaged by the D’Oyly Carte Company for their 1894/1895 tours. The next year he joined a company putting on Edwardian musical comedies in the United States. Returning to England, he had to undergo vocal cord surgery. During this time he took additional study, reappearing as a tenor, singing light roles at London’s Globe Theatre during the 1899-1900 season.\n\nAt Covent Garden in 1901 he sang in the world premiere of Stanford’s Much Ado About Nothing, also that year appearing at the Leeds Festival. Soon, he was engaged to sing in oratorios at all of the major festivals throughout England. He sang Gerontius in 1902 under Elgar’s baton, and over the next decade, he sang in opera throughout Germany and in Paris. In London in 1908, he sang with Blanche Marchesi in the concert premiere of Ethel Smyth’s The Wreckers conducted by Arthur Nikisch, and a year later performed in Beecham’s staged production of the opera. In 1910, Coates again sang with Beecham in productions of Tales of Hoffmann and d’Albert’s Tiefland. He was by this time also taking on Wagnerian parts to considerable acclaim: Lohengrin, both Siegfrieds, Tristan, Tannhäuser, and Parsifal in concert performances.\n\nCoates served in World War I, resuming his career in 1919 with recitals of English songs. There were some appearances in opera, but for the rest of his career, he performed mainly in recital. He toured North America in 1925 with the young Gerald Moore, who later devoted a chapter to Coates in a memoir:\n\nWas there ever a singer with a wider repertoire? … equally at home in the lieder of Beethoven, Schubert, and Schumann … the early English songs of Arne, Byrd, and Purcell; he championed the songs of Bax, Ireland, Howells, Warlock, and was abreast of the younger school … Weckerlin, Bruneau, and Lully tripped as easily off his tongue as did Fauré and Duparc. In Germany they called him the ideal Siegfried and Lohengrin … it is a moot point whether he or Gervase Elwes was the finest Gerontius of that era.\n\nMoore presented a BBC broadcast in tribute to their work together and received a letter from Coates in friendship and gratitude. Coates first recorded for G&T in 1907-1908 with several additions to the catalogue in 1915. He made a group for Pathé in 1911-1913, and Columbia in 1918-1919. He recorded acoustically for Vocalion in 1925 and made electrically recorded Columbias in 1928 and 1929. Sadly, he left recordings of only two Wagner selections, both from Lohengrin, and nothing from any of Elgar’s larger works.\n\nCOLTHAM, SIDNEY [spelled Sydney after 1913]\n\n(Canterbury, Kent, 1888 – Isle of Wight, 1970)\n\nSidney Coltham’s career brought him to smaller towns and cities in England as an oratorio and concert tenor whose fine voice and technique also suited him perfectly for recording. He began his training as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral, receiving lessons from highly regarded instructors. After his voice broke, Coltham was appointed a tenor soloist at the Cathedral, requiring him to sing at least two services each day, while taking further lessons with Harry Winsloe Hall at the Blackheath School of Music. He made his debut in Mendelssohn’s Elijah at the Cathedral in 1908. Over the next years he took numerous engagements as he gained experience. He also took great interest in breeding pigeons. It is a fact that he entered and won a Very High Commendation for his African Owl Fancy Pigeon at the Dover and District Poultry, Pigeon, Rabbit and Cage Bird Society show of November 1910. Prize winnings from such shows supplemented his income, as fees for local engagements were small.\n\nAfter a Canterbury Choir concert, the Whitstable Times reported, “The young tenor was in splendid voice … No one who heard him Tuesday evening could doubt for a moment that he is destined to fill a large place in the musical world in London”. Coltham’s decisive stroke came when he was selected for a tenor vacancy in the choir of Westminster Abbey—big news in the music world of 1912.\n\nHe began playing a prominent role on the oratorio circuit, bringing him to the attention of the Gramophone Company, the start of a profitable fifteen-year association. His records on their Zonophone label were announced as “exquisite records of the new tenor”. The spelling of his first name appeared as “Sydney” for the first time at the end of January 1913, and the spellings were interchangeable for the next few years, but his Gramophone Company records always used “Sydney”.\n\nHe performed all over England in Handel’s Messiah, Wolf-Ferrari’s La vita nuova, Franck’s Beatitudes, and Haydn’s Creation. In 1914 he made his sole Henry Wood Proms appearance singing Aitken’s “Máire, my girl”. Coltham appears not to have enlisted during the war, and his subsequent engagements were few at first. He retained his position at Westminster Abbey, and married in 1915. As he was kept in the public’s mind as a recording artist, his records sold well. The Gramophone Company printed a special supplement devoted to “this Brilliant singer” encouraging customers to “Ask for the Coltham List”.\n\nA fascinating review followed a concert at which he sang, Henry Wood conducting, in Birmingham (8 December 1922), in the second-only performance in Britain of Rachmaninoff’s “The Bells”. The Ealing Gazette opined “‘The Bells’ of Rachmaninoff, for downright elemental vitality, made all previous pieces of dull, drab, and doleful respectability. No such terrific outbursts were ever before heard from that previously irreproachable platform.”\n\nColtham’s records sold at affordable prices, his name familiar to those many who aspired to own celebrity records, but could ill afford them. In 1922, the Company decided to move Coltham from Zonophone to their prestigious, higher priced HMV label, announcing: “We introduce records by a tenor new to His Master’s Voice … Mr. Coltham is a great acquisition to the ranks of English singers who record exclusively for us.” Electrical recording replaced the acoustic method in 1925, and Coltham’s recording made in January 1926 were his first published electric sides.\n\nBy this time he was also tenor of the Chapel Royal, Windsor, requiring him to be available for all important occasions. His contract after 1928 appears not to have been renewed by HMV. He subsequently made recordings for the Piccadilly label for two years, some under the pseudonym “Frank Chamberlain”. His final concert took place in Bristol in 1931.\n\nDAVIES, BEN\n\n(Pontardawe, Wales, 1858 – London, 1943)\n\nA fixture on concert platforms and in oratorio for more than forty years, Ben Davies was often described as the successor to Edward Lloyd. His exuberant stage manner sometimes raised eyebrows, but the public loved him. He possessed a solid voice with a baritonal timbre that took well to the early gramophone; he was the first important British singer to make records.\n\nDavies trained at the Royal Academy of Music, making his operatic debut in 1881 in Balfe’s Bohemian Girl. His next notable appearance was in Goring Thomas’s Esmeralda, mounted by the Carl Rosa company during its first Drury Lane season in 1883. In 1887 and 1889, he starred in two operas by the forgotten composer, Alfred Cellier: Dorothy and its sequel, Doris. Arthur Sullivan chose him as the lead in his opera, Ivanhoe, in 1891, where he shared the honors with the Irish tenor, Joseph O’Mara. Later that year, Davies created the part of Clement Marot in Messager’s La basoche in London.\n\nDavies made his Covent Garden debut in Faust, and the following year sang in Cowen’s Signa, the composer conducting. That same year saw him in a performance of Mendelssohn’s Elijah, which Bernard Shaw praised highly in his review. At this point Davies gave up the operatic stage for the concert platform. Engaged to sing at Chicago’s World’s Fair, he performed during the crossing accompanied at the piano by fourteen-year-old Thomas Beecham. Years later Beecham wrote, “His was a voice of uncommon beauty, round, full, and expressive, less inherently tenor than baritone, and, like all organs of this mixed genre, thinning out perceptibly on top. Later on, the upper notes disappeared entirely, but the middle register preserved to the end ... most of its former opulence and charm.” Throughout his career Davies returned frequently to the United States, where he enjoyed great popularity.\n\nDavies was a soloist at the London Handel Festival of 1894 alongside Emma Albani, Nellie Melba, Edward Lloyd, and Charles Santley, to mixed reviews. Two years later he sang in the premiere of Liza Lehmann’s In a Persian Garden, with the composer at the piano. The long list of his appearances with other artists over the next twenty years reads like a “who’s who” of the great musicians of the time. One was the 1902 British and American Festival Peace Concert at the Crystal Palace, where the other participants included Emma Albani, Clara Butt and sixty-eight-year-old Charles Santley. Davies participated in memorable performances of Elijah, Bach’s Mass in B minor, and Beethoven’s Choral Symphony. One of his last appearances was at the July 1922 Centenary celebration concerts for the Royal Academy of Music at Queen’s Hall.\n\nIn later years, Davies took singing pupils, enjoyed playing golf, and was a member of the Savage Club.\n\nDavies recorded Pathé cylinders in the late 1890s, followed by disc recordings for the G&T, HMV, Pathé, and Columbia labels. His final records were made for Columbia at the age of seventy-four, repeating some of the selections for which he was best-known.\n\nDAVIES, TUDOR\n\n(Cymmer, Glamorganshire,Wales, 1892 – Penault, Monmouthshire, Wales, 1958)\n\nA dramatic tenor with a ringing top and panache to spare, Tudor Davies is one of the more familiar names featured in this survey. The son of a colliery yard foreman, Davies became an engine fitter after he left school, but also studied the violin. He studied with David Evans at Cardiff University and by 1914 was making a fine impression singing solo parts with the Porth Welsh Tabernacle Choir. In 1915 he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, where he began studies with Gustave Garcia, but he soon was called up to the Navy as an “engine room artificer”, also working in munitions.\n\nAfter the War, Davies debuted as Tamino in The Magic Flute in a low-budget 1920 production at the Old Vic under the direction of Lilian Baylis. The following year he sang in The Barber of Seville for Vladimir Rosing’s opera company, then joined the British National Opera, which had taken over the assets of Beecham’s bankrupted opera company in 1921. They used Covent Garden as their venue, and in 1923 Davies sang there in Madama Butterfly and La bohème with Maggie Teyte: “It was a tribute to the vocal skill of Miss Maggie Teyte and Mr. Tudor Davies … that they were the two artists whose words could be best heard, for neither has a powerful voice. We liked their interpretations, their youthful manner, and simple, straightforward characterizations”. Davies then sang Rodolfo with Nellie Melba, donating her services to the company, singing Mimi in Italian while the rest sang in English. Later that season, he and Teyte were paired in Gianni Schicchi and The Tales of Hoffmann. During his seven years with the company, Davies sang Tamino, Lohengrin, Faust, Don Jose, the Duke of Mantua, and Florestan. He appeared in Ethel Smyth’s Fête Galante and Arthur Benjamin’s The Devil Take Her. In 1924, he created the title role in Vaughan Williams’s Hugh The Drover, and the following season created Prince Hal in Holst’s At The Boar’s Head. That same year, Davies was particularly admired in Verdi’s Requiem, performed with a chorus of 2,500 at the Crystal Palace.\n\nAfter the bankruptcy of the British National Opera, Davies joined the Sadler’s Wells company, where he sang the first English performances of Don Carlo and Rimsky-Korsakov’s Snow Maiden. During a duel scene in Carmen in 1938, he slipped and strained a ligament, then was accidentally kicked in the kneecap. He somehow finished the opera but was in obvious pain the next night singing Die Meistersinger. During World War II, he worked for the Entertainments National Service Association where he met and married soprano Ruth Packer. In the 1950s he gave up the operatic stage for the concert hall and taught in Cardiff.\n\nDavies’s first recordings were made for the Scala and Coliseum labels. He soon switched to HMV where he recorded a substantial number of acoustic discs including extended excerpts in English from The Ring and Meistersinger, excerpts from Hugh the Drover, and a complete recording in English of Madame Butterfly. Among other electrical HMV records, he can be heard in excerpts from Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius, recorded during a 1927 performance conducted by the composer.\n\nEISDELL, HUBERT\n\n(London, 1882 – Peterborough, Ontario, 1948)\n\nHubert Mortimer Eisdell, once a household name particularly in Britain and Canada, owed his renown to his many records. After excelling in sports at school, Eisdell attended Cambridge University where he was active as an amateur actor and singer, graduating in 1905 with a degree in classics. His cousin was Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario and Eisdell became the games master at the Grove Preparatory School in Ontario, Canada.\n\nReturning to England in 1907, he and tenor Gervase Elwes became friends. Elwes encouraged him to study voice and pursue a career in singing, introducing him to Victor Beigel, who became his voice teacher, and William Boosey, director of the popular Chappell Ballad Concerts in London, who gave Eisdell his first professional engagement in 1909. Before long, Eisdell was singing in concerts throughout the country. In 1910, he was featured during an eighty-concert tour to North America with a troupe organized by Liza Lehmann. He married the Tasmanian pianist/composer Katharine Parker, a former student of Percy Grainger. Parker often accompanied him, and he included her songs in his programs. Over time, Eisdell also enjoyed friendships with Roger Quilter, Cyril Scott, and Teresa del Riego, each of whom composed music for him.\n\nEisdell made his first recording, the popular ballad “Somewhere a Voice is Calling”, in 1912 for HMV, with many such songs to follow. His records were extremely popular, selling in the tens of thousands. He performed regularly with the most prestigious orchestras, conductors and choirs in England. His career was interrupted during the War when he served with the Royal Navy Voluntary Reserve, and in 1918 joined the staff of the Admiralty as secretary to Commodore H. Douglas King. Just before he completed his service, Eisdell signed an exclusive contract with the Columbia Graphophone Company, recording prolifically for them until 1933. He was featured in Felix Weingartner’s first recording of Beethoven’s Choral Symphony, sung in English, and Thomas Beecham’s first recording of Handel’s Messiah. He also recorded songs by his wife, Roger Quilter, and Liza Lehmann. In 1921, he sang in Elgar’s Dream of Gerontius, performed as a memorial for Gervase Elwes at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nThroughout the 1920s his schedule of oratorio and concert engagements remained undiminished. His repertoire was widely varied, with folk songs and popular “potboilers”, as he called them, an increasingly prominent feature.
