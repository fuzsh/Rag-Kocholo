Caruso, I represent a class of prisoners in a decades- long case challenging conditions of confinement, including medical care, at various Michigan prison facilities.2 Since August 2006 I have been haunted by the death of one of those prisoners, because in retrospect his death appears to be the inevitable by-product of a prison system swollen beyond any historical precedents or its ability to manage such a huge num- ber of people safely Prisons are in fact extraordinarily difficult to operate safely and humanely, and the United States will continue to fail to do so absent a funda- mental change in criminal justice policy.

Prison systems like Michigan’s have been allowed to operate unsafe prisons because the Eighth Amendment fails to provide an effective form of oversight, and no other form of serious oversight exists in the United States. In a series of decisions, the Supreme Court has preserved the form of Eighth Amendment challenges to conditions of confinement but little of the substance, by allowing severely overcrowd- ed prisons,3 suggesting that considerations of cost can defeat an Eighth Amendment claim,4 and allowing Eighth Amendment claims to be defeated even when prison conditions are objectively intolerable and deny prisoners basic human needs, includ- ing health care.5 Unfortunately, Michigan may ultimately illustrate that the only real restraint on prison growth is its cost, not the Constitution. I. The Lonesome Death of Timothy Souders Timothy Souders arrived at the Southern Michigan Correctional Facility in March 2006 with medical problems that included a thyroid disorder and cardiac risk factors.6 He also had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression, and had attempted suicide multiple times. It was duly noted in his medical record that, because of his medications and medical problems, he was at very high risk of in- jury if exposed to excessive heat. In March 2006, the prison psychiatrist at the Southern Michigan Correctional Facility where Mr. Souders was confined changed his medications, prescribing lithium for his bi-polar disorder and subsequently increasing his lithium. How- ever, there are no records of laboratory monitoring of the level of lithium in his blood for the relevant period, although elevated lithium levels are toxic and can cause symptoms ranging from mental confusion to life-threatening side effects such as kidney failure. Monitoring lithium levels in the blood is considered absolutely necessary when lithium is prescribed, and high lithium levels are particularly danger- ous in someone who is dehydrated. Near the end of May 2006, the psychiatrist went on medical leave and thereafter there was no psychiatrist on-site for the 1,400 prisoners at the prison. In July Mr. Souders was involved in a fight with another prisoner and was ordered to punitive detention. After 30 days he was released, but he was sent back to the seg- regation unit for taking an unauthorized shower during an August day in which the heat index was over 90. He was put in a boxcar cell, meaning an essentially unventilated cell with no window and a solid metal door, rather than an open barred cell front, on the sixth level of the prison. When staff opened the food slot in one of the solid doors, which is how staff talked to people in those cells, on hot days they could feel a blast of hot air from inside the cell. During the next few days the heat index in the cells rose to around 100. On August 2, 2006, Mr. Souders damaged the metal stool in his cell and was put into standing restraints. When he tried to flood his sink, according to prison records, a supervisory nurse approved cut- January 2010 Prison Legal News 1 Upon receipt of your stamps, we send a money order to your trust account or - as you member, friend, or outside account, a wired or electronic funds transfer, or a packa t account or - as you or a package CLN OFFERS THE FASTEST, MOST REPUTABLE SERVICE WITH THE MOST CHOICES: 7 years in the business • (Minimum money order is $15.00) Highest reimbursement rates * Funds sent to your trust account or to whom you designate Payment within 24 hours • No order form is required Stamps accepted from all states, inmates, and free persons • All denominations of stamps above 20( face value are accepted Money orders, wired/electronic transfers, approved packages • Single stamps, stamped envelopes are OK CLN NAS THE HIGHEST REIj'JlEAlRSij'JSNT RATES ' 70% of FACE VALUE Complete New Books of “Forever” (Liberty Bell) stamps 65% of FACE VALUE Complete New Books/Sheets of 440 Stamps % *> of FACE VALUE Partial Books, Sheets, or Strips of 440 (or Forever) Stamps 50% of FACE VALUE Singles or Less than 4 / Sheet All Other Denominations Stamped envelopes Do NOT send used, torn, or damaged stamps Do NOT send stamps with less than 2CK face value Do NOT send stamps without sufficient peel-off borders Do NOT apply tape of any kind to the stamps Do NOT send envelopes with prison stamp or impression PLEASE give us a complete name/address where funds are to be sent PLEASE provide any special forms required & complete instructions .

Prison Legal News Michigan Prison Health Care (cont.) ting off the water to the cell - a restriction removed only because someone noticed that the whole prison was on heat alert status. Mr. Souders was then put into top- of-bed restraints, with metal restraints on his wrists and ankles on a concrete slab. Use of this type of restraints is well known to carry a risk of death from asphyxiation, heart attack and dehydration. That day, the psychologist who was in charge of mental health services for the prison characterized Mr. Souders as “flor- idly psychotic.” From August 2 through August 5, the segregation log and the video camera used in his cell document that Mr. Souders was repeatedly screaming inco- herently. Between August 2 and August 6, Mr. Souders rarely accepted water. During the first two days he was in restraints, the video camera used by staff to film him fogged up and staff complained of the heat and humidity in his cell. As the use of restraints continued, Mr. Souders was held in restraints naked. He urinated in his restraints and developed burn-like sores on his body from lying in his own waste. At one point, prison records indicate that Mr. Souders was transported to the prison’s unaccredited on-site “hospital,” but the physician there declined to exam- ine him, apparently because he urinated on the examining table. On August 6, prison guards walked him to the showers; the video shows him staggering. Shortly thereafter the re- straints were removed. He then fell to the floor of his cell and was unable to get up. Guards returned him to the slab. A nurse examined Mr. Souders in his cell and told him that his pulse was faint, a symptom that indicated he had experienced a drastic fall in his cardiac output. The nurse then left the cell without doing anything to as- sist him. For the next hour there was no movement in the cell. Then staff reentered the cell because Mr. Souders did not ap- pear to be breathing. He was pronounced dead shortly thereafter, at the age of 21. [See: PLN, May 2007, pp.l, 7, 8]. Michigan allows “limited license psychologists” to treat prisoners absent supervision even though they are not eligible to treat people in the community without supervision by a fully-licensed psychologist. The limited-license psy- chologist who last saw Mr. Souders alive had an undergraduate degree in theol- ogy and a master’s degree in community 3 counseling. This limited-license psychol- ogist had seen the psychologist who was officially “supervising” him once, from a distance, in the preceding year. The head psychologist who diagnosed Mr. Souders as floridly psychotic was a psychiatric social worker and also was not licensed to practice in the community without for- mal supervision. Aside from the prison system’s employment of staff who are not fully licensed, staff demonstrated a pervasive indifference to community standards of care, as illustrated by the psychiatrist’s failure to perform routine tests for toxic levels of lithium that any psychiatrist in the community would have required. Staff resources were severely stressed. The Director of Nursing at the prison where Mr. Souders died testified that the prison complex needed about 11 more registered nurses to deliver health care. Almost a third of the registered nursing positions were filled by licensed practical nurses. Even today, despite Mr. Souders’ death, the Department has no policy that requires large prisons with segregation units, which are typically full of the men- tally ill, to have on-site psychiatrists. The medical staff operate in a culture of deference to prison security staff that interferes with care. That culture explains the behavior of the nurse who told secu- rity that there was no reason Mr. Souders could not be placed on a water restriction despite his medical problems and the con- ditions within his boxcar cell. It similarly explains the conduct of the doctor who knew of Mr. Souders’ urine burns but neither treated him nor objected to the use of restraints by security. That culture also explains how a registered nurse could fail to initiate treatment when he learned that Mr. Souders had developed a weak pulse. All of these individual failures took place in a context in which no medical or mental health staff perceived a need to intervene. Nor did any medical staff question why security made the decision to put a mentally ill man into restraints. Nor did anyone question leaving a man in restraints within a boxcar cell where staff could not readily observe him. As the medical director for the Michigan prison system admitted, he thought that there was ample opportunity for medical, mental health and security staff to inter- vene, but it never happened. An autopsy determined that the cause of Mr. Souders’ death was hyperthermia, with dehydration a secondary cause, but January 2010 Michigan Prison Health Care (cont.) it characterized the death as “accidental.” While no one has asserted that any staff member actively desired the death of Mr. Souders, I cannot accept the claim that the death was an accident. Rather, the death of Mr. Souders and other victims followed inevitably from the decision of the State of Michigan to imprison almost 50,000 people but fail to provide the resources necessary to provide them with minimally adequate health care, combined with a staff culture of willful blindness to the risks that this lack of care entailed. II. Just Another Brick in The Wall As might be expected from the num- ber and variety of deficiencies in medical and mental health care implicated in the death of Timothy Souders, his death took place against a backdrop of systemi- cally inadequate care. For some years, the Michigan prison system has chosen to concentrate its sickest prisoners in the Hadix facilities. As of early 2007, at the largest Hadix prison, half of the prison- ers suffered from at least one chronic disease requiring ongoing treatment. The apparent reason for this concentration of chronically ill prisoners was the proxim- ity of Duane Waters Hospital, run by the Department of Corrections. The hospital was required under a Consent Decree entered early in the Hadix litigation. For a substantial period of time, the hospital was accredited by the Joint Commission on Health Care Organizations, but that accreditation has now lapsed. Despite the lack of accreditation, the Department of Corrections continued to allow a surgeon who lacked admitting privileges at any hospital to perform surgery there. Thus, although the Hadix facili- ties have served as the linchpin of the ^Black/European/Spanish Chicks!

The Hadix court made findings in 2002 regarding hundreds of incidents in which prisoners received inadequate or delayed care, or no care at all. These findings included cases in which the medical system failed to provide timely access to prisoners with urgent and emergent serious medi- cal problems, including failures resulting in death. Subsequent findings by the court-appointed medical monitor, Robert Cohen, M.D., described multiple medical failures, including a prisoner who died of an untreated “staph” infection and gastro-intestinal bleeding; an HIV patient with difficulty in swallowing who, despite a weight loss to 108 pounds, was denied the pureed diet he needed to eat; and a diabetic who predictably died of hypogly- cemia after gross failures of treatment and monitoring, accompanied by a failure to respond to his emergency needs. The court medical monitor and the Director of Medical Care for the Depart- ment of Corrections, a physician, jointly reviewed six randomly-selected medical records of Hadix class members whose specialty care appointments had been delayed. In one case, there were no ap- parent consequences from the delay; in a second case, the only effect may have been to force the prisoner to experience unnecessary pain. In the other four cases, the Hadix court concluded, the delay exposed the prisoners to the “prospect of unnecessary death and grossly unneces- sary suffering.”7 These cases included a man allowed to go untreated for an extended period without diagnosis or treatment for a kid- ney stone that was rendering his kidney non-functional. Another man with text- book signs of an impending heart attack was improperly scheduled to be seen in thirty days rather than immediately. By the time he was seen, he was lucky to survive his emergency by-pass surgery. Another patient with known symptoms of bowel cancer had his diagnosis delayed for over a year. He proved to have an abnormal, potentially pre-cancerous lesion. Perhaps equally striking, after the diagnosis the patient was not scheduled for follow-up until his case was discovered in the ran- dom case review. The last patient whose file was ran- domly chosen for review had complained that a mole on his back was increasing in size. He kited repeatedly and was di- agnosed with “melanocystic skin mole” that needed to be “watched closely.” Nonetheless, a subsequent medical order to remove the mole in two weeks resulted in no treatment; a nurse told him to ap- ply a hot compress to the mole. Over six months after he began kiting, in January 2006, he saw medical staff again, by which time the mole had grown into a black-red mass with irregular margins and bleed- ing. About two weeks later, a pathology report indicated malignant melanoma. He did not receive the next necessary step in the diagnostic process, a sentinel-node biopsy to determine whether he had meta- static cancer, until April 2006. That biopsy showed that the cancer had spread while he was not receiving treatment. Unfortunately, the mistreatment of this patient did not end despite the Hadix court’s December 2006 opinion noting the previous delays in diagnosing his cancer. The medical monitor subsequently discov- ered that the patient’s chemotherapy had been significantly interrupted when staff did not order his cancer treatment drugs in a timely manner. When the drugs were ordered, staff specified an insufficient quantity for the chemotherapy. These delays in care took place in the context of a system that allowed 30-40% of cancer patients at any given time not to receive treatment within the time frames set by their physicians, even though, the Hadix court found, those physicians often set dates for patients to be seen that were too far in the future, and often failed to take appropriate initial diagnostic steps for timely diagnosis of cancer. For example, another patient waited nine months for a biopsy of his suspected cancer. He finally received a biopsy diagnosing prostate cancer on March 19, 2007. As of early July 2007, the patient had developed bloody urine and was still not yet scheduled for surgery. The medication distribution system is also broken. A randomized study of medication prescription and renewal by the medical monitor’s office concluded that each month hundreds of prisoners kited within the Hadix facilities because their medications had been interrupted. There is no functioning system to assure renewals of medications even when staff know of the need for renewals. As a result, even HIV medications go unrenewed. Although the problem is widely known among health care staff, nothing is done to address the problem. In fact, a physician in the Hadix facilities refused to renew medications in a timely fashion. The medi- Prison Legal News 4 cal monitor documented that medications records containing medication renewal requests, abnormal laboratory test results and specialty consultation reports piled up unread in physicians’ offices. The monitor also documented waits of three to four weeks to see a physician, with physicians canceling scheduled patient appointments without cause. As of the last date for which I have data, half of the registered nurses posi- tions were not filled by permanent staff. Of those filled by temporary contract staff, 60% of the positions were filled by licensed practical nurses rather than regis- tered nurses. As a result, licensed practical nurses take actions that they are not quali- fied to perform. The nursing shortages also result in medical kites from prisoners going unanswered for days at a time. Medical treatment was equally bad at the dialysis unit, where a number of prisoners with the most complex medical problems are housed. An outside neph- rologist review reported that the medical director “appeared disengaged,” and that there were serious deficiencies in water testing and documentation, management of vascular access complications, blood pressure management, delayed specialty care referrals and testing, medication continuity, and emergency care.8 Regis- tered nurses assigned to the dialysis unit have been administering medications in a variety of unapproved ways, including relabeling medications dispensed by the pharmacist for prisoners who have left the facility in order to administer them to other prisoners, failing to check medica- tion orders correctly before administering them to prisoners, and relying on an out- moded system to check that the correct medications are administered. Further, in part because medica- tions are not being consistently ordered electronically, the medication regimes for the dialysis patients are frequently interrupted. According to a review by the medical monitor, 61% of the dialysis pris- oners experienced delays or interruptions of their prescribed medications. Although dialysis puts patients at risk for sepsis, most of the intravenous medications on hand to treat septic patients following hospital discharge are months or years past their expiration date, even though there can be a three-day delay in the di- alysis unit’s ability to obtain new supplies of such medications. Dialysis patients needing specialty care (other than urgent surgery when vas- cular access for dialysis fails) frequently do not receive that care or receive it only after significant delays. As of December 2007, a dialysis patient with a cerebral aneurysm had been waiting since June 2007 for surgery. Another patient was re- ceiving dialysis through a perma-catheter in his chest wall, which is a dangerous method for dialysis access because of the heightened risk of infection it poses. The patient was delayed between September and December 2007 in obtaining surgery to create a standard arteriovenous shunt for dialysis. Shortly after the surgery he was found to have a blood infection and was started on intravenous antibiotics. A nephrologist consultant for the monitor’s office reviewed the deaths of a number of dialysis patients. One of those deaths involved a prisoner whose cardiac symptoms were ignored over a long pe- riod, except for one physician’s attempt to obtain a stress test for him. The prison’s contract medical provider, Correctional Medical Services, Inc. (CMS), denied the request. Subsequently, the patient died of cardiac arrest after his dialysis was delayed despite a life-threatening elevation in his potassium level. Another dialysis patient died of a brain hemorrhage after his blood pressure problems were ignored and mistreated by medical staff for a year. He was treated with a single medication that cannot safely be used as a sole medication for severe hypertension, and his death, according to the report, was directly CONVERT YOUR POSTAGE STAMPS to MONEY ORDERS, WIRE TRANSFERS, PACKAGES WE PAY THE HIGHEST REIMBURSEMENT RATES COMPLETE OR PARTIAL BOOKS/STRIPS/SHEETS/ SINGLES ACCEPTED 24-HOUR TURNAROUND Please See Details In Our Ad Inside the Front Cover CLN P.O.

Prison Legal News 5 January 2010 Michigan Prison Health Care (cont.) related to his severe, uncontrolled and inappropriately managed blood pressure and failure to ensure accurate medication administration. Another dialysis death occurred after staff failed to note increasing evidence of unstable cardiac disease. Although one of the patient’s physicians did note that he needed an echocardiogram, the test was not performed. A nurse who thereafter saw the patient at a time the patient was experienc- ing classic symptoms of unstable angina did not make a referral to a physician. A month later, the physician again remarked that the patient needed an echocardiogram, but the test was not ordered. The follow- ing month the patient was finally sent to a hospital where he was diagnosed with a heart attack, and he died of cardiac arrest following by-pass surgery. Another patient died after a delay in summoning an ambu- lance after the patient experienced a heart attack. The autopsy indicated that he had a structurally normal heart, so that prompt treatment of the heart attack might have saved his life. After years of reviewing the failures of medical and mental health care, it is perhaps not surprising that the federal judge assigned to Hadix wrote that [ T ]here are a large number of compli- cated cases with interdisciplinary problems that unfortunately are being regularly mistreated and/or ignored by staff The phenomenon is now a regular feature of the system. 9 Understanding how such a prison staff culture could become embedded requires a consideration of the larger policies that have shaped the Michigan criminal justice system. III. Money for Nothing As of the last available statistics, Michigan had per-prisoner medical costs that were about 108% of the national average. I consider the more significant statistic that Michigan spent $2,841 per prisoner on medical care in 2001, at a time when national spending on medical care was $4,370 per person per year. Of at least equal significance, Michigan has been receiving limited value for the money that it does spend on prison health care. According to a report by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC), commissioned by the Michi- gan Department of Corrections (MDOC), Michigan is getting poor value for the January 2010 $300 million per year that it currently spends on prison medical care. Part of the problem, according to the report, was that Michigan contracts out physician services (other than psychiatrists) to CMS. An NCCHC reviewer became con- cerned about the level of cognitive functioning of one of the CMS physicians. The physician’s medical records had so many errors of spelling and language use that parts of them were incomprehensible. When the reviewer asked supervisors about this physician, the supervisors were familiar with the problem but none believed he or she had the power to take action.10 In addition, under its contract with the state, CMS pays for off-site specialty care and also decides whether a physician will be allowed to refer a prisoner for such care. As the NCCHC report notes, the fact that the physicians work for CMS may explain why they rarely challenge the decision of CMS reviewers to deny their requests for specialty referrals. Similarly, this fact may explain why 30-40% of can- cer patients, as noted earlier, experienced disruptions in their chemotherapy under this system. A subsidiary of CMS, PharmaCorr, provides pharmacy services for the prison system. PharmaCorr is not required to provide a consulting pharmacist under the contract. Staff reported to the NCCHC that they experienced delays in receiving medications for “same day” delivery un- der the contract, which is not surprising because PharmaCorr ships all its medica- tions to Michigan from its warehouse in Oklahoma. The report also found that the formulary (a list of medications that a physician can prescribe without any additional authorization from a reviewer) lacked classes of medications that are commonly included in the formularies of large health care organizations, and the procedures for ordering non-formulary medications could pose serious safety concerns, aside from the paperwork burden posed by the inadequacies of the formulary. The process for dispensation of medi- cation is unnecessarily time-consuming and wasteful. The medical records, which are partly electronic and partly paper, pose a barrier to patient care and decrease the productivity of staff, in significant part because of problems with the electronic medical records system that Michigan uses. In fact, Serapis, the electronic medi- cal records system, is so flawed that the 6 NCCHC recommended that if Michigan intends to continue using it for any pur- pose, it should at least stop using it to record certain medical functions, instead reverting to paper records. The report also commented that the MDOC was “one of the most bureaucratic systems we have ever encountered,” and questioned whether the proliferation of bureaucratic procedures of dubious value undermined the system’s ability to complete necessary procedures. The pro- liferation of paperwork is “even worse” in health care, with the 5 1 Michigan pris- ons generating hundreds of reports each month that the NCCHC doubted would be read by anyone. At the same time, the productivity of CMS medical staff was strikingly low. While the reviewers expected physicians to see an average of 20 patients per day, most CMS providers averaged 8-12 per day, and one provider averaged five per day. The NCCHC identified three factors con- tributing to the low productivity: Serapis, the poorly functioning electronic medical record system; certain prison rules; and the fact that the medical care providers are not employees of the MDOC. The third point is the heart of the mat- ter, according to the NCCHC report: The providers have no incentive other than their own professionalism to see more patients. All MDOC facilities have been completing [provider] Productivity Reports for several years. The [MDOC Bureau of Health Care] administration says they cannot do anything about the situation, because they do not supervise the [providers ]. They send the information on to the CMS administration, but noth- ing ever changes. We were told by several MDOC staff that CMS administrators say they cannot tell the [providers ] what to do, because they are independent contractors and not employees. Whatever the truth is, this situation must change. The MDOC should seriously recon- sider the advantages and disadvantages of continuing to contract out provider ser- vices. Not surprisingly, the report also found that the system lacked an effec- tive quality improvement program, or a functioning peer review system to assure health care quality. Instead, the system’s ostensible quality improvement system amounted to mere “paper pushing.” Many if not all of the problems the re- port identified stemmed from Michigan’s Prison Legal News failure to write a proper contract with CMS and other contractors, including the company that provided the Serapis program. The NCCHC reviewers were told that CMS often unilaterally reduced its staff coverage for a particular posi- tion from five days a week to two days a week, and the contract did not provide any disincentive for CMS doing so. In fact, the contract allows the prison sys- tem to require CMS to fill those hours, but the system has not insisted on full staffing. Perhaps most damning, over the ten years of the contract, the NCCHC monitors were not provided with a single monitoring report, although the state was supposed to perform regular audits and CMS was supposed to be assessed liqui- dated damages at any facility that failed to achieve a designated level of compliance. Notwithstanding this provision, not a single claim for liquidated damages was ever made by the state: Many staff verbalized that they had <( heard from Lansing' ' [where the head- quarters of the MDOC is located ] that the MDOC simply needs to make the relation- ship with CMS “ work .\" Whether or not anyone in the MDOC central office actually said this, this is what staff perceives. The most glaring example of this is practitioner staffing shortages. ... Staff speculates that if the MDOC and CMS were operating in a truly arm's length relationship, there should be an immediate response from the MDOC followed by a rapid termination of the contract. Although the causes differ in part, the mental health program is also strikingly inefficient. The program is divided between the Michigan Department of Community Health, which provides psychiatrists and certain other staff, and the MDOC, which provides most of the psychologists. Certain prisoners are placed on the out-patient mental health team case load, and these prisoners have their mental health care pro- vided by the Department of Community Health. All of the other prisoners suppos- edly have their health care provided by the MDOC, including identification and initial treatment of patients experiencing a mental health crisis. This organizational structure is cumbersome and wastes resources. It also creates problems because of disagreements between the two entities as to whether a prisoner needs treatment, and allows staff to disclaim responsibility for services that they consider not within their duties. IV. Trouble Ahead, Trouble Behind Michigan citizens are justly proud that their state supports one of the na- tion’s finest public universities, including a leading medical school. In my view, they should also be proud that the state lacks a judicially-imposed death penalty. Unfor- tunately, as the death of Mr. Souders and many others illustrate, Michigan now has a randomly imposed death penalty for too many prisoners who have the misfortune to suffer from serious medical needs, and this accidental death penalty stems directly from public policy choices that have resulted in an underfunded prison system confining prisoners for whom it is unable to provide minimally adequate medial care. Michigan has the sixth largest prison population among the states, although it ranks eighth in total population. Three states with larger total populations - Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania - have smaller prison populations. Michigan’s comparatively high rank in prison size reflects its comparatively high incar- ceration rate. This rate is an outlier in the Midwest region, and ten of the eleven other states in the region have rates lower than Michigan’s. Nor can Michigan’s high incarcera- tion rate be explained simply by its crime rate. Michigan has the eleventh highest incarceration rate in the country, although it ranks seventeenth in crime rates.11 Incarceration rates are as much in- fluenced by criminal justice sentencing policies as by crime rates. Only three of the eleven states with the highest incarceration rates have crime rates that also rank in the top eleven among the states. While crime rates matter in determining incarceration rates, criminal justice policies related to prosecution, sentencing and parole matter at least as much.

S. Mint Green, Ltd. Prison Legal News 7 January 2010 Michigan Prison Health Care (cont.) in significant part related to its history of extraordinarily tough punishment for drug offenders. In 1978, the state legisla- ture imposed a mandatory punishment of life imprisonment without parole for persons convicted of possession of 650 grams of cocaine or heroin. Not even convictions for rape or mayhem were punished as harshly as persons punished under this drug possession statute; the only other crime that Michigan punished equally harshly was first degree murder. No other jurisdiction imposed a mandato- ry sentence of life imprisonment without parole for first-time possession of illegal drugs in comparable quantities. Although Michigan’s mandatory life sentence for drug possession statutes were repealed in 1998, and prisoners convicted under the law subsequently received parole eligibil- ity, in the last five years the Parole Board has granted parole to eligible lifers at the rate of 0.2% per year. In 2002-2003, more than 9% of the Michigan prison population was serving a life sentence, amounting to almost 4,600 prisoners. As of 2002-2003, Michigan had the fourth-largest number of lifers of any prison system in the nation. More than half of those prisoners were serving life without the possibility of parole. For lifers who were eligible for parole, the average sentence length for those who gained release increased to an average of 23.2 years during 2000-2004. Apparently many of the lifers released in those years were released on medical parole, which typically implies that the prisoner has a terminal illness or some other incapacitat- ing medical or mental health condition. Thus, the combination of a large state population, a relatively high crime rate, and a particularly severe set of sentencing and release policies have resulted in nearly 50,000 prisoners behind bars. V. And It’s a Hard Rains A-Gonna Fall Michigan’s criminal justice system combines a number of elements that fuel a particularly expensive prison system - that is, a state with a large population; a state with a very high incarceration rate and aging prisoner population, reflecting a his- tory of unusually punitive criminal justice policies; and a state that receives poor value for its expenditures on prison health care. In addition, Michigan, unlike the majority of the states with comparatively high incarceration rates, also has com- January 2010 paratively high per-prisoner incarceration costs. Locking people in prison is, under any circumstances, an expensive business, and Michigan policy makers appear to have done virtually everything within their power to make it more expensive. By 2003, the nation spent $61 bil- lion just on corrections, out of a total spending on the criminal justice system of $186 billion. The most recent available figures for the cost of incarceration per prisoner average $23,876. That average cost, however, is subject to wide variation. If we look at the eleven states including Michigan with the highest incarceration rates in the country, we find that six of them rank among the ten states with the lowest per-prisoner costs.12 Michigan is the only state with a high incarceration rate that also ranks above the state median in per-prisoner cost. In fact, Michigan ranks well above the national average cost of incarceration, and it is the only state among the 1 1 with the highest incarceration rates that has a per-prisoner cost that exceeds the national average. The major reason for the high per- prisoner cost is staff wages and benefits. The approximately 50,000 Michigan pris- oners cost the state an average of $28,743 per prisoner, in contrast to the national average per-prisoner cost of $23,876. A Pew Charitable Trust analysis found that the two critical factors in determining comparative per-prisoner incarceration costs among the states are variations in the cost of employee wages and benefits, and variations in the prisoner-to-staff ratio.13 In a 2002 survey, base pay for correctional officers in Michigan was the sixth highest in the country. Wages and benefits have made up 71% of the total operating costs of the Michigan prison system, although on av- erage these expenses in state correctional systems account for about two-thirds of the systems’ total operating costs. Aside from the fact that MDOC wages and benefits account for a somewhat high percentage of operating expenses, there is other evidence that its comparatively high per-prisoner cost does not reflect a high ratio of staff to prisoners. The union that represents correctional officers in Michigan claims that the number of state correctional officers declined from 10,600 to 9,200 between 2000 and 2005, despite an increase of several thousand in the prison population. Michigan can no longer afford to pursue this discordant cluster of poli- 8 cies. Most states that provide abysmal medical care at least get what they pay for; Michigan cannot even make that statement. Even in the best of times, high incarceration rates combined with high incarceration costs result in difficult finan- cial burdens, as large numbers of states have recognized. Because of the state’s high number of lifers and long sentences for drug crimes, Michigan’s prison popu- lation contains many older prisoners who tend to need more expensive medical care. When one adds in high staff costs and the waste of large amounts of money in the dysfunctional medical care system, the cost of the system would not be sustain- able over the long term in relatively good economic times. Of course, these are not good eco- nomic times, particularly in Michigan. For over a year, the state has been caught up in a “one-state recession,” with the highest unemployment rate in the nation. As the economic downturn has worsened, the state has experienced a major budget crisis. Part of the MDOC’s response to the reduction in its share of the state budget was to close the Southern Michigan Cor- rectional Facility, the prison where Mr. Souders and many others died. I have no doubt that the major motivating factor for the closure was the desire to save money by moving the concentrated population of sick prisoners to prisons not covered by the Hadix consent decree. Now that these high-risk prisoners have been dispersed throughout the system, it is highly likely that their medical care will deteriorate further. [See: PLN, Dec. 2007, p.26]. Aside from the moral responsibility that Michigan politicians and the MDOC bear for Mr. Souders’ death and their re- fusal to prevent future deaths, the current cluster of policies and practices are on a collision course with reality. Michigan taxpayers have been stuck with large jury damages awards related to some of these deaths. The estate of Jeffrey Clark, a prisoner at the Bellamy Creek Correc- tional Facility in Michigan, was awarded $2,750,000 by a federal jury based on his death from dehydration in a hot cell after prison staff turned off the water in his cell and failed to give him water to drink at a time when he suffered from apparent mental illness. [See: PLN, Dec. 2008, p.9]. A damages action on behalf of the estate of Timothy Souders was settled for $3.6 million in June 2008. [See: PLN, March 2009, p.41]. More recently, the state settled with a large number of current and former Prison Legal News female prisoners who had been subjected to rape or other forms of sexual abuse for an astounding $100 million [PLN, Dec. 2009, p.30]. The MDOC also risks new class actions seeking injunctive relief at the prisons to which large numbers of chronically ill prisoners were transferred after the closure of the Southern Michi- gan Correctional Facility. More importantly, until Michigan fundamentally reforms its sentencing and parole policies, as well as its system for delivering health care, prisoners like Timothy Souders will continue to suffer a death sentence for the “crime” of being mentally or physically ill. Until funda- mental change occurs, I can only echo the words of Richard A. Enslen, the Hadix federal judge who brought to public atten- tion the failures in the Michigan system: “Say a prayer for [Timothy Souders] and the others who have passed. Any earthly help comes far too late for them.”14 Postscript In September 2007, a panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, composed entirely of judges appointed by former President George W. Bush, remanded but did not vacate the relief ordered by Judge Enslen in an opinion that did not rule on the merits.15 On remand, a new federal district judge, also appointed by former President Bush, terminated the injunctive relief on mental health care ordered by Judge Enslen. Plaintiffs appealed to the Sixth Circuit from that ruling. Ironically, at the same time that the prisoners have been denied relief by the federal courts, the deadly medical care revealed by the Hadix litigation led to a substantial public outcry that, in addi- tion to forcing the Governor to ask the National Commission on Correctional Health Care to prepare its critical report, forced the Department of Corrections to act. The unfavorable media attention culminated in a 60 Minutes story in Feb- ruary 2007. In response, and also presumably spurred by the financial crisis that hit Michi- gan particularly hard, the MDOC took steps that significantly increased parole grants, reduced parole revocations and increased the number of prisoners given compas- sionate medical release. Of particular note, parole revocations are down by 42% since their high-water mark in 2002. As a result, the prison population has fallen by about eight percent, and even this calculation does not take into account that, before these Prison Legal News steps, the population had been increasing by about 160 prisoners a month. It remains to be seen whether these policies will be maintained after the fi- nancial crisis eases, despite the MDOC’s astounding admission that increased incarceration “may actually increase crime in Michigan because of the high unemployment rate among former prison- ers and the reduced funding available for education.”16^ Ed.

Elizabeth is the former director of the ACLU’s National Prison Project and one of the top prisoner rights litigators in the United States. I first became aware of Elizabeth in the late 1980s, I had been in prison for a few years and was involved in my first prison conditions case, enforc- ing an overcrowding consent decree at the Washington State Reformatory in Monroe, Washington. I was a subscriber to the NPP Journal and an avid student on everything I could read and learn about prisoner rights. I corresponded with Eliza- beth off and on over the next decade and a half and finally met her and the other wonderful attorneys at the NPP after my release from prison in 2003. The March, 2008, issue of PLN had an extensive interview with Elizabeth and details her legal career where she has exclusively represented prisoners since 1981. As her article amply illustrates, she brings a compassion and legal acumen to the field that is both noteworthy and admirable. Over the course of almost three decades of prisoner rights litigation Eliza- beth has helped ensure better standards of living and decency for literally millions of prisoners. She has also served as a leader, mentor and role model for many lawyers over that same time period who have worked at the NPP, worked with her and otherwise been inspired to represent prisoners in litigation. It was with shock, outrage and surprise that ACLU executive director Anthony Romero fired Elizabeth from her job as Executive Director of the NPP effective December 2009. Moreso when one considers the excellent results she has obtained for her clients and the sterling leadership and inspiration she has provided to her employees and the legal community over the years. Protests and appeals by a number of prisoner rights advocates that the ACLU reconsider this decision were ignored. Elizabeth’s firing from the NPP is a grave loss to the ACLU, who is a much poorer organization with her departure, and more seriously to the hundreds of thousands of prisoners around who are represented by the NPP. The reality is that the NPP is, outside of a few states, the only organization that represents January 2010 From the Editor by Paul Wright prisoners in conditions of confinement class action suits.

According to the complaint, Kenneth Holcomb, a DOC prisoner, was attacked by other prisoners, severely injured and rendered unconscious. Guards A. Al- exander, K. Greeson and Lt. D. Holt responded to the fight. Alexander hand- cuffed the unconscious Holcomb, then the three guards grabbed Holcomb and tried to force him to stand up. When other prisoners complained, pointing out that they could be exacerbating his injuries, Holt let go of Holcomb, causing his head to violently jerk and bounce off his chest. The other guards then dropped Holcomb onto the floor and called for medical sup- port. Holt cursed the prisoners who had criticized him for the next ten minutes. A Medical Technical Assistant (MTA) arrived at the fight scene. The MTA, Holt, Alexander and Greeson placed Holcomb on a gurney without the use of a back brace or head restraint. He was taken to the yard clinic where the MTA examined the still unconscious Holcomb and called Registered Nurse Lynda Houghtalin, re- questing medical transport to the Central Treatment Center. Houghtalin refused to come transport Holcomb, claiming that there was blood in the Emergency Trans- port Vehicle (ETV) that had to be cleaned out. There were other means of transport- ing Holcomb, but none were used. Two hours after the fight, after 10 multiple calls from the MTA requesting transport, Houghtalin arrived at the yard clinic with the ETV. However, she was told not to transport Holcomb until M.D. David Stuart Clark examined him. Later, Clark told her that he wanted to continue to observe Holcomb before approving transportation to the CTC, so Houghtalin left the yard clinic without Holcomb. Clark briefly examined Holcomb, who had regained consciousness and was complaining of excruciating neck and back pain, difficulty breathing and inabil- ity to voluntarily move anything below the neck. Without any testing, Clark decided Holcomb was “faking” an injury and re- leased him to his cell. Holcomb was taken to his cell in a wheelchair and “dumped” there. Unable to move, in severe pain and with no control over his bladder and bowls, Holcomb lay in his own excrement for more than a day. After repeated complaints by pris- oners and staff regarding Holcomb’s condition and medical treatment, M.D. Daniel Thor visited Holcomb’s cell. Without any further examination, Thor concurred with Clark’s diagnosis. After more complaints and another request by the MTA for transportation to the CTC, Holcomb was finally taken there the next day. During a videotaped examination by M.D. Issac Grillo, obvious signs of paralysis were ignored. Instead, Grillo lifted Holocomb’s hand so that it hit him in the head when Grillo dropped it, hit him in the head and poked him hard with various medical instruments, and injected him with a saline solution which he told Prison Legal News Holcomb was “strong medicine” that would cure him. Grillo also diagnosed that Holcomb was “faking” an injury. Holcomb continued to plead for help and state that he wasn’t faking it. Security staff finally relented and ordered medical staff to transport Holcomb to Salinas Val- ley Hospital. At the hospital, Holcomb was diagnosed with C4-5 quadriplegia due to a fracture dislocation. Emergency surgery revealed a ruptured C4-5 disk, C4-5 jump facet and acute quadriplegia due to subluxation. Holcomb remains quadriplegic with no chance of recovery. Holcomb filed a civil right suit pursu- ant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in federal district court, with pendent state claims, claiming that the delay in medical treatment and medical maltreament caused or worsened his quadriplegia and that some aspects of Gillo’s medical examination amounted to assault and battery. Following a state medical board investigation, an administrative judge stripped Gillo of his medical license in October 2004. The investigation included a medical skills test that revealed Gillo “lacked the knowledge, training and judg- ment to avoid making potentially serious errors,” had an “uncritical and thought- less approach” in managing test cases and scored in the lowest 10 to 20 percent on medical ethics and communications tests. As a result of medical board disciplinary action, Clark surrendered his medical license in 2003, and Thor was placed on probation by the medical board. The settlement includes all past and future medical expenses, legal costs and fees and attorney fees. It also provides that Holcomb will be allowed to purchase for use in his cell a 32” flat panel color TV, a digital AMIFM radio and a special remote control to operate them. Holcomb was represented by PLN Advertiser Pismo Beach attorney William L. Schmidt and La Mesa attorney Suzy C. Moore. Unfortunately, Holcomb’s case is not the exception to the rule. The DOC “has been a refuge for doctors who have been unable to provide care in other places,” according to San Quentin Prison Law Office staff attorney Alison Hardy. “As a result there have been a lot of prisoners who have been harmed.” See: Holcomb v.

The end is in sight not because prison officials have fully complied with a court-monitored consent decree, but because they closed the prisons under the court’s jurisdiction and scattered the prisoner class members among other facilities. [See: PLN, Decem- ber 2007, p.26]. This class-action suit, known as the Hadix litigation, was originally filed in 1980 by twenty-three prisoners who have all since died. The 1985 consent decree in- cluded issues related to sanitation, safety, overcrowding and security, which have been resolved and concluded. What remained under court supervi- sion were provisions concerning medical care. As PLN has previously reported, the court re-opened claims regarding mental health care through a preliminary injunc- tion after prisoner Timothy Souders died of dehydration in August 2006; his death was exacerbated by psychotropic medica- tions and an overheated segregation cell. The district court issued an order that required development of staffing plans to ensure timely routine and emer- gent psychiatric and psychological care, the provision of daily psychologist and psychiatrist rounds in segregation units, and coordination of mental health and medical staff to prevent indifference to prisoners’ care. The court also prohibited the use of punitive mechanical restraints. [See: PLN, May 2007, pp.l, 7, 8]. The Michigan Department of Cor- rections (MDOC) responded to the court’s order by appealing to the Sixth Circuit. While the appeal was pending, the MDOC submitted several plans on mental health treatment that were rejected by the district court. The MDOC’s next plan was to close major portions of the Hadix facilities. The Sixth Circuit remanded the injunction in light of the state’s intention to close the affected prisons. On remand, the district court con- sidered the MDOC’s request to end the injunctive relief and dissolve the consent decree. Basically, the court did just that. In a March 31, 2009 order, the court found that the Hadix plaintiffs could not prove a systematic failure to comply with the January 2010 by David M. Reutter court’s order or show deliberate indiffer- ence to the serious mental health needs of the remaining class members. The evidence showed that the MDOC had banned mechanical restraints as pu- nitive measures, added psychiatric staff, ensured that daily rounds were made by a single psychologist familiar with the needs of prisoners under his supervision, and provided coordination between men- tal health and medical employees. As such, there was no need to con- tinue injunctive relief or include mental health care within the 24-year-old con- sent decree. Since the MDOC had closed the Southern Michigan Correctional Facility in 2007, injunctive relief was terminated as to that prison. In addi- tion, the court terminated such relief as it pertained to the dialysis unit at the Ryan Correctional Facility, stating The almost two-year-old, $62-million maximum-security Virginia Cen- ter for Behavioral Rehabilitation (VCBR) is still having start-up problems. Located in rural Nottoway County on 28 acres and opened in February 2008, VCBR is unable to retain staff and offers little in the way of rehabilitative treatment. The facility, which was expanded to 300 beds in September 2008, houses sex offenders who have been civilly committed after completing their prison sentences. The Inspector General for the Vir- ginia Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse Services found that VCBR lost around half its staff annually in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. As of February 2009 the facility had 190 employees and 59 staff openings - a 24% vacancy rate. In a March 2009 report the Inspector General said “active treatment” at VCBR was “much lower than desirable for an ef- fective treatment program,” with residents receiving an average of just 6.6 hours of treat- ment each week. No vocational programs or jobs were available at the facility. The report noted that only two residents had been con- ditionally released from VCBR since 2004, that any constitutional violations must be brought in separate litigation because that prison was not covered under the Hadix consent decree. The MDOC argued there was no pri- mary prison left under the consent decree and the class had disappeared, and the district court acknowledged that it was “not entirely clear what, if any, Hadix facilities remain, and how many, if any, Hadix class members remain.” Thus, the court said it would hold a hearing to determine the “future trajectory of this litigation.” The plaintiffs have appealed the district court’s March 3 1 , 2009 ruling to the Sixth Circuit, where it remains pending. PLN has reported extensively on the Hadix case, beginning in 1995. See: Hadix v. Caruso , U.S.D.C. (W.D. Mich.), Case No. 4:92-CV-110; 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52884. when the facility was at a temporary location in Petersburg. A survey found that 64% of staff did not feel safe while working at VCBR. In an earlier report, one staff member described an “identity issue” in that the residents and some staff viewed the razor- wire surrounded facility as a prison and residents as prisoners rather than civilly- committed patients in need of treatment. Three-quarters of the staff interviewed by the Inspector General in 2007 expressed doubts about any resident ever being re- leased: “Many of the comments made by staff were flatly negative, denying any pos- sibility of eventual successful treatment.” Mental health department spokesman Meghan McGuire said that progress was being made, as the staff turnover rate was down and weekly hours of active treat- ment doubled from 2007 to 2008. VCBR residents weren’t as optimistic. “We traded a prison for a prison after we did our time,” said Mark Hodges, 41, who was civilly committed to VCBR. “They have me in leisure-skills classes, arts-and-crafts classes ... stuff like that, and I told them I can get stuff like that on my own,” said Victor Johnson, 26. “If I’m here, I want to be treated.” Shortcomings Cited at Virginia’s Civil Commitment Facility by Matt Clarke 12 Prison Legal News BOP Settles FTCA Abuse/Religious Discrimination Suit for $48,000 by Brandon Sample The residents have found support in an unlikely advocate. Sex-crime victim Paul Martin Andrews, who organized political support to get the civil commit- ment program funded, is worried about the lack of treatment. “The [U.S.] Supreme Court has made it clear that the real reason for these guys to be committed to the center is for treatment,” said Andrews. “To think that we could turn these guys around, who have committed these [sex- related] crimes time and time again, and be able to release them safely is kind of ambitious - es- pecially if they’re not getting treatment.” W. Lawrence Fitch of the Maryland Department of Mental Health and Mental Hygiene, an expert on civil commitment, dis- agreed. He said the Supreme Court held that if a civil commitment program doesn’t deliver meaningful treatment, the law creating it is not necessarily unconstitutional. Instead, the residents must file suit in an attempt to force the state to provide adequate treatment. It sounds like the residents are right: VCBR is just another prison - with few if any opportunities to obtain treatment or release, which is generally the whole point of creating civil commitment laws in the first place. Nor is the public getting much in return for its tax dollars; each resident at VCBR costs the state about $131,000 a year, more than 5 times the price of keeping someone in prison. PLN has previously reported on civil commitment centers in Washington state, Florida and California.

From April 5, 1996, until October 4, 2005, Hakeem Shaheed was incarcer- ated at United States Penitentiary (USP) Marion, one of a handful of control units operated by the BOP. After the September 11th attacks, Shaheed, like most other Muslim prisoners, faced ridicule, scorn and abuse by guards. In a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, Shaheed’s complaint recounts how guards at Marion “intentionally plac[ed] his Holy Qur’an on a floor stained with spit” and “squeezed his Kufi in an obvious attempt to insult [his] religion.” Shaheed reported this conduct to the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG), who investigated the al- legations, making several trips to Marion to speak with Shaheed. On October 3, 2005, after reporting what happened to the OIG, Shaheed’s complaint alleges guards set out to “tor- ture and otherwise physically and mentally abuse” him. According to Shaheed, guards came to his cell “seized him, struck him, handcuffed [his] hands behind his back, shackled his ankles and took him to the prison hospital.” While at the prison hospital, Shaheed alleged that he was punched and that a baton was ground into his face and spine, shoved into his mouth and rammed into his “rectal area, over his pants.” All of this abuse, Shaheed alleged, occurred while medical staff watched and ignored his cries for help. One medical staff member, according to Shaheed, went as far as to give pointers to the guards on where to hit Shaheed in order to cause greater pain. After further humiliation and torture, Shaheed was transferred to the federal death row unit at USP Terre Haute for his own protection. Shaheed filed suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) after his release. Shaheed’s attorney, John Stainthorp from the People’s Law Office in Chicago, said the BOP’s decision to settle the case was an obvious “recognition ... that there was abuse of Mr. Shaheed that was unconscionable.” The BOP denied any li- ability in settling the case. The BOP paid $48,000 to settle the case. The complaint and settlement are available on PLN’s website. See: Shaheed v. United States of America , USDC SD IL, Case No. 07-CV- 679-MJR (2009).

From 2001 through June 2009, 142 jail prisoners died in Harris County. The DOJ twice performed on-site inspections of the county’s jail system, and concluded in a June 4, 2009 report “that certain conditions at the Jail violate the constitutional rights of detainees.” The DOJ went on to say that “the number of inmates’ deaths related to inadequate medical care ... is alarming.” Citing its oversight authority under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Per- sons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997, DOJ inspectors visited all four jails in Harris County before giving the jail system fail- ing marks in “(1) medical care; (2) mental health care; (3) protection from physical harm; and (4) protection from life safety hazards.” Houston’s main jail houses nearly 11,000 prisoners, not including satellite facilities. In 2007, over 130,000 detainees cycled through the county’s jail system. The DOJ noted major deficiencies in medical care provided to this revolving population of prisoners - especially those with serious mental health conditions. The two most serious problems involved record-keeping and follow-up treatment at the jail’s clinic. One 74-year-old prisoner who had previously undergone open heart surgery went to the clinic complaining of inconti- nence. The medical staff sent him back to his unit without examining him or taking his vital signs. The next day he returned with the same symptoms plus high blood pressure. This time he was sent to the hospital; however, he died shortly after his arrival. Another prisoner with diabetes went to the clinic complaining of leg pain and swelling in her knees. She was given pain medication. Five days later she returned with the same symptoms. Again she re- ceived pain pills. When she returned later that day she collapsed in the clinic, but medical staff didn’t try to revive her and failed to provide emergency care. She died without receiving any help. January 2010 by Gary Hunter A male prisoner with a history of cirrhosis of the liver visited the jail clinic multiple times over the course of several weeks, complaining of swelling in his leg. He was prescribed blood pressure medica- tion even though his blood pressure was normal. Despite his repeated trips to the hospital, jail staff ignored the hospital’s instructions and kept him on his original course of treatment. His condition dete- riorated so severely that he died during his last hospital visit. The level of medical treatment at the jail - or the absence of same - led DOJ inspectors to note that the “discontinuity of care and lack of follow-up by staff are of serious concern....” The DOJ report cited several other cases in which prisoners with mental health problems were either not treated or were improperly treated for conditions such as self-starvation, self-mutilation, bipolar disorder, alcohol detox and suicide risk. Three of those prisoners suffered physical injuries as a result. Even more frightening than the jail clinic’s lack of adequate care was its ten- dency to improperly medicate when staff did provide treatment. One prisoner was diagnosed at intake with an acute psy- chotic state; he was prescribed medication but it was never received. As his mental condition deteriorated, he became less and less cooperative. He was eventually injected with an intramuscular drug that rendered him unconscious. A short time later he died. Another prisoner had already spent nearly a year in a state hospital before being declared “not competent and not restorable” by the court. Instead of being returned to the hospital he was placed in the jail’s general population and allowed to keep his medication on his person. After he suffered a seizure he was sent to the clinic. Medical staff decided that he was merely “sleepy” from his psychotropic medication, and sent him back to his cell. He died soon thereafter. Beyond inadequate medical and mental health care, federal inspectors expressed “serious concerns” about exces- sive use of force by Harris County jailers. The DOJ report noted that the jail had no policy or training to instruct staff on pro- 14 hibited use of force restraints. The jail did not have a policy to distinguish between planned and unplanned use of force, nor did it provide routine videotaping, incident reports or collection of witness statements for use of force events. Although the DOJ report did not spe- cifically list any deaths in 2009 related to excessive use of force, PLN recently reported several examples that occurred in 2008 and 2007. In one of those incidents, prisoner Clarence Freeman was choked to death by jail guard Nathan Hartfield after Hartfield took him to an area where there were no video surveillance cameras. Hartfield and a sergeant were fired following an investiga- tion into Freeman’s death, but neither was indicted. [See: PLN , Oct. 2009, p.l]. Overcrowding was also identified as a major area of concern by DOJ inspec- tors. According to their report, “the Jail’s crowded conditions currently exacerbate many of the constitutional deficiencies” found at the facility. The DOJ report cited a 10-month period in which over 3,000 fights and 17 sexual assaults were reported at the jail. Investigators attributed this high rate of violence to overcrowded conditions. The report stated that not only was the jail not equipped to “routinely investigate violent incidents,” but jail staff could not “distinguish between disturbances caused by detainees with mental illness and other detainees.” Due to overcrowding, the Houston jail routinely had unsanitary conditions in a variety of areas. Inspectors found there were not enough washers to sani- tize linens and clothing, and of the few washers the jail did have, several were not functional. Unsanitary bedding, clothing and mattresses were endemic and caused an immediate danger of spreading infec- tious diseases. Barbers at the jail used dirty blades, equipment and supply boxes. Plumbing was deteriorated and in need of mainte- nance. Some intake cells still used “holes in the floor” as toilets. The 24-page DOJ report concluded with 20 recommended areas for improve- ment, and warned that failure to remedy the identified problems at the jail could result in legal action against the county. Prison Legal News Harris County Attorney Vince Ryan re- sponded to the report on August 25, 2009 with a 300-page rebuttal that strongly dis- agreed with the DOJ’s findings, claiming that Houston’s “jail system of the past and present meets minimal [constitutional] standards.” Although county officials have ac- knowledged the overcrowding problem at the jail, they are hard pressed to find solutions. A proposed 2,193-bed expan- sion of the jail system would cost $256 million plus about $9.65 million per year in additional staffing costs. Due to the current economic crisis, the county is preparing for budget cuts in the 2010-201 1 fiscal year. The Sheriff’s Office is facing cuts of up to 16%. In December 2009, Harris County Commissioner El Franco Lee proposed putting more jail prisoners to work and increasing the work credits they receive from two days’ credit to three per day of incarceration, which would result in earlier releases. “I’m putting it up for On June 3, 2009, Greene County, Missouri agreed to pay half of a $75,000 settlement in a wrongful death action brought by the family of a prisoner who died while at the Greene County Jail. In July 2005, Winston Eugene Holt, a federal prisoner being held on charges at the jail, died from a heart attack. Holt’s wife, Donna Holt, filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action against various jail medical staff claiming that they were aware that her husband suffered from different heart related conditions, but “took inadequate action to treat and/or discussion because there has been over- crowding and it is an issue that would bring Harris County in consistency with other parts of the state,” said Lee, who chairs the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council. Three-for-one credits are offered in other Texas counties for prisoners who participate in work programs. Harris County voters rejected a pro- posed jail expansion in November 2007 that would have been funded with $195 million in bond financing. Critics have complained that county officials have not implemented other options that would make an expansion of the jail unneces- sary - such as issuing citations for some low-level misdemeanors in lieu of arrests, granting more personal bonds for arrestees, and cutting back on probation violations in order to reduce the jail’s population.

In addition, Holt alleged that the jail continued to provide inadequate care to other prisoners. Greene County denied liability in the case, but after mediation by the parties, reached a $75,000 settlement in the case. The settlement requires Greene County to pay $37,500, half of the settlement, with other half being paid by Doctor’s Hos- pital and David Weems, a former doctor at the jail. Holt was represented by Craig Heidemann of Bolivar, Missouri. See: Holt v. Glenn , Case No. 07-5106-CV-SW- JCE (W.D. Missouri).

In an article published in Social Science Quarterly in 2004, Hooks et al. collected data on all exist- ing and new prisons constructed in the United States since 1960, and examined the impact of prisons on employment growth in the approximately 3, 100 coun- ties in the contiguous United States. Their analyses compared metropolitan with nonmetropolitan counties with respect to income per capita, total earn- ings, and total employment growth and statistically controlled for other poten- tial influences on employment growth (including population size, economic infrastructure, and the educational level of the workforce, among others). Hooks et al. did not find a significant relation- ship between the presence of prisons and employment growth in metropolitan counties, suggesting that any impact of prisons is probably drowned out in these larger, diverse urban economies. Additional analyses compared non- metropolitan counties experiencing slow employment growth during the previous decade with those experiencing more rapid growth. These analyses showed that among the faster-growing counties, there was no evidence that prisons made a substantial contribution to change in total employment. Among the slower-growing counties, prisons actually impeded private sector and total employment growth. Additional scholarly research has supported Hooks et al.’s findings that prisons do not contribute to economic growth. Using census data for each new prison town and all other towns (incor- porated places with fewer than 10,000 residents) Besser and Hanson (2005) found changes in unemployment rates be- tween 1990 and 2000 were approximately equal in prison and non-prison towns, but public sector employment increased more in prison towns. In addition, increases in total non-agricultural employment, retail sales, average household wages, the total number of housing units, and the median value of owner-occupied housing were substantially lower in towns with January 2010 prisons compared to non-prison towns. In New York State, a Sentencing Project report by King, Mauer, and Huling (2004) on the impact of 38 new prisons that opened between 1982 and 2000 found no statistically significant impact of prison construction on reducing unemployment, and no positive effects with respect to per capita income. Similarly, a report on the impact of prison construction in the state of Missouri found that, aside from population increases in jurisdictions with prisons (largely as a result of the arrival of prisoners in these jurisdictions), counties with prisons saw no increases in personal income, and actually had larger increases in unemployment, than counties without prisons. Finally, a county-level analysis focusing on the impact of private prisons conducted by Washington State Uni- versity graduate student Shawn Genter found that in states with private prisons, new prisons impeded economic growth. Genter suggested that prisons impede employment growth due to the “oppor- tunity cost of a misguided investment.” In other words, as government funds are allocated to prison construction, other public programs suffer. In a more recent study to be published in Social Science Quarterly , Hooks et al. extended their analysis of the impact of prisons on employment to 2004, separated the analyses into four seven-year periods (1976-1983; 1983-1990; 1990-1997; 1997- 2004) , and also examined how human capital mediates the influence of other factors affecting employment growth at the county level. Given arguments that large-scale construction projects (such as prison building) provide benefits to local economies that persist after such projects are completed, Hooks et al. also separated private sector employment into construc- tion and non-construction, allowing them to include growth in construction employment to predict changes in non- construction employment over time. Similar to the findings in their 2004 study, Hooks et al. found no significant relationship between the presence of prisons and employment growth in met- ropolitan counties, and also that prisons have not played a strong role in economic growth in rural counties over the past few 16 decades. While new prisons were associ- ated with increases in public employment in the 1976-1983 and 1983-1990 period and established prisons were associated with growth in both public and total em- ployment in the 1983-1990 period, such was not the case for the 1990-1997 and 1997-2004 periods. In order to examine the impact of human capital factors on employment growth, Hooks et al. compared counties with new and established prisons experi- encing high growth in the percentage of individuals holding Bachelors’ degrees to counties experiencing low growth in the percentage of individuals holding Bach- elors’ degrees over the four time periods. Among counties experiencing higher growth in educational attainment, new prisons contributed to growth in public sector employment from 1997-2004. However, for counties experiencing low growth in the percentage of individuals holding Bachelors’ degrees, both new and established prisons had a negative impact on total employment growth over the same period. King, Mauer, and Huling (2004:461) note that “in the case of prison siting, it is incumbent upon those supporting sit- ing to demonstrate not simply marginal economic gain, but rather, to establish that the economic benefits have been worth the investment”. Hooks et al.’s more recent study calls into question claims that prison construction is worth the investment for rural communities. Their study is part of a growing literature that examines who does and does not benefit economically from prison construction. While develop- ers prominent in local growth machines and more distant firms may realize profits from construction and service contracts with prisons, there is emerging evidence that prisons do not solve the economic problems of rural areas, but in fact may create several new problems. Among oth- ers, these problems would include placing pressure on environmental resources while aggravating class and racial inequalities and leading to increased rates of domestic violence. As Tracy Huling notes, there is “no shortage of anecdotal evidence of increased rates of divorce, alcoholism and substance abuse, suicide, health problems, Prison Legal News family violence, and other crimes as- sociated with multi-generational prison communities.” In addition, as has been noted by Peter Wagner and others, because the Census Bureau counts people in prison as being residents of the communities where they are incarcerated, there has been a substantial transfer of government funds from urban to rural communities. The urban communities in which most prison- ers originally resided also lose political representation and power as a result of this phenomenon. While the statistical analyses de- scribed above do not allow us to determine specifically why the promised economic benefits of prisons do not materialize, we believe that there are several possible explanations. With respect to prison jobs them- selves, in many states, such jobs are subject to union rules regarding seniority and are frequently filled by out-of-county residents, resulting in what King, Mauer, and Huling refer to as an “employment transfer.” Generally, higher paying man- agement and prison guard jobs in prisons have educational and experience require- ments which many rural residents do not possess. In California, for instance, management and security positions in newly-constructed prisons are often given to more senior correctional employees who apply to transfer from other prisons in the state. In Corcoran, California, only 40 percent of jobs at a new prison were filled by residents of the host county. Similarly, in Missouri, more than two- thirds of the prison jobs were filled by individuals living outside the host county. In the eastern Oregon city of Ontario, 62 percent of the approximately 870 em- ployees of the Snake River Correctional facility live in Idaho, where property taxes and home prices are substantially lower. Even the low- wage jobs associated with prisons, such as janitorial positions, are out of reach to local residents because they are commonly filled by the prison- ers themselves. Comments by a county commissioner in Minnesota whose juris- diction was successful in securing a prison summarize this issue most poignantly “At first we thought if we built it they would come, but what we’ve learned is that some of the prison employees come to work here, but not to live here.” An additional reason that prisons do not contribute to employment gains is that the economic multipliers associated with these facilities are very limited. Prison workers who move from other locations often don’t reside in the actual prison town, and as such, their consumer behav- iors have more of an impact on markets outside the prison community. Big-box retail stores such as Wal-Mart and/or fast food restaurants are among the limited number of businesses that establish them- selves in new prison towns and the influx of such businesses frequently leads to the demise of locally-owned establishments. These businesses are also unlikely to cre- ate local economic linkages themselves. As an article addressing the economic impact of prisons in Oregon noted that there “is nothing entrepreneurial about a prison economy” - prisons can crowd out other opportunities that might have lead to clusters of related, competing businesses “propelling each other to innovate and expand.” Another possible reason for the lack of positive economic benefits of prisons is the existence of prison industries, which may serve to displace low-wage workers, especially in economically depressed rural areas.

For example, the federal government’s UNICOR program employs more than 22,000 prisoners, operates over 100 “factories” and had more than $650 million in sales (most products are sold to the United States military) in 2003. It has been noted that some prisoners working for UNICOR are paid as little as 12 cents an hour, and that the company commonly violates federal health and safety standards. Among the prominent companies that currently use or have used prison labor are IBM, Boeing, Motorola, Mi- crosoft, AT&T, Texas Instruments, Dell, Compaq, Honeywell, Hewlett-Packard, Nortel, Lucent Technologies, Intel, TWA, Nordstrom’s, Revlon, Macy’s Pierre Car- din, Target Stores, Victoria’s Secret, Toys R Us, Starbucks, and the Parke-Davis and Upjohn pharmaceutical companies, among others. While approximately 5,000 prisoners in state penitentiaries are paid the minimum wage for their work on paper, many do not, and in privately- operated prisons, wages are significantly lower. As we noted in a previous article in Prison Legal News , Oregon is the state that perhaps best exemplifies the negative impact of prison labor on employment. Passed in 1994, Ballot Measure 17 in that state required that all prisoners work 40 hours per week. As a result, thousands of previous public sector jobs are now filled by prisoners. In addition, private companies can hire prisoner work crews for as little as $400 per day which may lead them to lay off or terminate regular employees. Work crews have also been hired by municipalities for public work projects. In Umatilla, Oregon, the city manager, who frequently hired prisoner work crews commented “Yeah, they’re jobs that might have been taken away from somebody, but realistically they probably wouldn’t have gotten done.” There have also been several examples in other states of companies that locate within prisons and subsequently close their outside operations. Finally, due to the negative stigma that sometimes attaches to “prison towns”, prisons can also discourage other types of economic development as busi- nesses may be reluctant to locate in such towns. As the executive director of a group January 2010 opposing prison construction in upstate New York commented “Once you have the reputation of a prison town, you won’t become a Fortune 500 company town, or an Internet or software company town, or even a diverse tourism and company town.” An interesting “case study” of this issue can be seen in the two Oregon counties of Umatilla and Morrow, as documented by Ben Jacklet in Oregon Business magazine. When it competed to attract a new prison in 1989, Mor- row County had a 16.5% unemployment rate, the highest in the state. Although the county was unsuccessful in securing the prison, from 2000 to 2006, private employment in Morrow County grew by 27%, with clusters of businesses form- ing in the specialty food and renewable energy sectors. Although it is impossible to determine whether the lack of a prison was responsible for this increase in pri- vate employment, Jacklet notes that over the same period, neighboring Umatilla county, which housed two large prisons, lost 1,460 private sector jobs. The Future The folly of promoting prisons as economic engines is becoming even more evident in the current economic climate - it turns out that prisons are anything but recession proof. As states face huge budget deficits, they are moving to shut down inefficient prisons. In the fall of 2009, California, which had the second-largest prison system in the United States, floated a proposal to release as many as 40,000 prisoners to save money and comply with a federal court ruling that found the state’s prisons were overcrowded. Whether that occurs remains to be seen. Colorado granted earlier parole to nearly 20 percent On April 29, 2009, Onondaga County, New York agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by the family of a prisoner who committed suicide at the Onondaga County Justice Cente"
