        "text": "Jonathan Cohen has forged a remarkable career as a conductor, cellist, and keyboardist. Well known for his passion and commitment to chamber music Jonathan is equally at home in such diverse activities as Baroque opera and the classical symphonic repertoire. He is Artistic Director of the Handel and Haydn Society (H+H), Artistic Director of Arcangelo, Music Director of Les Violons du Roy, and Artistic Director of Tetbury Festival. From 2025, he becomes Artistic Advisor to the London Handel Festival.\n\nThroughout the 2024–25 Season, Jonathan continues to have a strong presence on both sides of the Atlantic. He returns to Kammerorchester Basel and directs performances of St. Matthew Passion with both Rotterdam Philharmonic and Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. He returns to Glyndebourne Festival for a revival of Barrie Kosky’s production of Handel's Saul. He leads both the H+H and the Houston Symphony Orchestra in Messiah, and with H+H he also conducts Haydn The Seasons, Mozart Requiem, and Beethoven Mass in C.\n\nJonathan founded Arcangelo in 2010 to create high quality bespoke projects. The ensemble was the first named Baroque Ensemble-in-Residence at Wigmore Hall, where it enjoys a continuing close association, and has toured to exceptional halls and festivals including Philharmonie Berlin, Vienna Konzerthaus, Barbican Centre, Kölner Philharmonie, Salzburg Festival, MA Festival Bruges, with three appearances at the BBC Proms including the premiere of Handel's Theodora (2018) and a televised performance of Bach's St. Matthew Passion (2021). They are Principal Ensemble-in-Residence at the London Handel Festival from 2025.\n\nArcangelo’s founding commitment to the recording studio has produced 30 critically lauded albums including Arias for Guadagni and Bach Cantatas with Iestyn Davies (Hyperion; Gramophone Award 2012 and 2017), Mozart Violin Concertos with Vilde Frang (Warner; ECHO Klassik Award 2015), C.P.E. Bach Cello Concertos with Nicolas Altstaedt (Hyperion; BBC Music Magazine Award 2017), Buxtehude Trio Sonatas Op.1 (Alpha Classics; GRAMMY Nominee 2018), Tiranno with Kate Lindsey (Alpha; Sunday Times Records of the Year 2021). Arcangelo’s latest recordings include Handel's Theodora, Sacroprofano with Tim Mead, Handel's Chandos Anthems (Alpha; releasing 2025) and a landmark project with Nicolas Altstaedt to make the first survey on period instruments of Boccherini Cello Concertos (Alpha)."
