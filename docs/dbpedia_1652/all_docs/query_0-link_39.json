She joined the MSO in 1940 as \"extra flute\"—an unusual appointment due to her lack of conservatorium training. In 1942, she joined the ABC Sydney Studio Orchestra, which would later become the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1952, she married Colin Evans, the SSO's third flute and piccolo, and subsequently left the orchestra to start a family, although she gained a reputation as a soloist with Musica Viva Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and also crossed over to from classical to jazz flute, joining Charlie Munro's jazz quintet and acquiring the nickname \"Hot Lips\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the 1970s and 1980s, Vogt taught music, and was involved in the establishment of several flute organisations, including the Sydney Flute Society (1973), as executive director of the Australian Flute Conventions in 1973 and 1983, and as a member of the steering committee for the foundation of the Australian Flute Association (1981). She also instigated the creation of the Register of Historic Flutes with Robert Brown. In 1976, she founded Zephyr Music, a sheet music supply company which became a successful family business.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Vogt was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day honours in 1989, for service to music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2014 – David Werdyger, Polish-American Hasidic Jewish hazzan and solo singer who was considered one of the pioneers of 20th-century Jewish music, dies at age 94.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A Holocaust survivor who was incarcerated in several Nazi concentration camps, including the factory run by Oskar Schindler, Werdyger moved to Brooklyn, New York, after World War II and began recording albums featuring the music of the Bobov, Boyan, Skulen, Melitz, Radomsk, and Ger Hasidic dynasties, recording 60 albums in all. He also founded and operated a successful travel agency, Werdyger Travel, and established the Jewish record label, Aderet Records, now managed by his son Mendy.[4] He was the father of popular Jewish singer Mordechai Ben David and the grandfather of Jewish singers Yeedle (Mordechai's son) and Yisroel Werdyger (Mendy's son).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Werdyger was the youngest of four sons and four daughters born to Yisrael Aryeh Werdyger, a well-to-do wholesaler of men's shirts and dry goods and a prominent member of the Gerrer Hasidic community of Kraków (Cracow), to which the family moved shortly after David's birth. The Werdyger family was known for its musical talent, and as a youngster, David's singing ability was readily apparent. At the age of six he became the soloist in the choir of the Eizik Yeikeles Synagogue in Kraków, and at age 12 he was invited by Yankel Talmud, the leader of the Gerrer choir, to be a soloist in that choir in the town of Ger. On Rosh Hashana, he sang before the Gerrer Rebbe, the Imrei Emes, and thousands of Hasidim.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With the Nazi occupation of Poland in September 1939, Werdyger was subject to frequent arrests and forced labor on the streets of Kraków. In the summer of 1940, when the Nazis ordered all Jews to leave the city, Werdyger's family moved to an uncle's home in Proszowice. In response to rumors of a mass deportation, David, his unmarried sister Yettie, and his parents went into hiding with 16 others in a bunker in their uncle's warehouse, where they were cared for by a Polish employee. Three weeks later, they sneaked into the Podgórze ghetto of Kraków. From there, his parents bought their way out of the ghetto into Sosnowice, where one of their married daughters was living. David never saw them again.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the ghetto, David worked in forced labor battalions, and when a mass deportation took place in the Podgórze ghetto, he went into hiding with 15 others. Two weeks later, his group was ferreted out of their hiding place and taken with 180 other ghetto residents to the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp to be shot by firing squad. Each man passed before German Nazi camp commandant Amon Göth; when it was David's turn, Göth asked him what type of work he did. \"I am a professional singer, and I have a trained soprano voice,\" Werdyger replied. \"Would you like to hear something?\" Momentarily taken aback, Göth replied, \"Sing the song you Jews chant when you bury your dead.\" Werdyger began singing the traditional Jewish prayer for the dead, El Molei Rachamim (\"God, Full of Compassion\"), with great feeling and power, ending with a thunderous \"Amen.\" His voice so moved Göth that the commandant directed him to the camp rather than to the firing squad; he was one of the 40 men saved from execution that day.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Werdyger was an inmate in the Płaszów for five months, after which he was transferred to the nearby factory under the direction of Oskar Schindler. He also spent time in the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp and the Linz labor camp, where he was liberated on Saturday, 5 May 1945.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After the war, Werdyger found his eldest brother, Yaakov Meir, and youngest sister, Yettie, still alive. He traveled to Makow to attend Yaakov Meir's wedding and was there introduced to Malka Godinger (1923–1980), daughter of Meir Godinger. They married shortly after. Several months later Werdyger and his wife left for Paris, France, where their first son, Yisrael Aryeh, was born. Four years later, in February 1950, they sailed to New York.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The couple had three more sons in America: Mordechai (born 1951, Chaim (born 1954), and Mendel (Mendy) (born 1959). Werdyger encouraged his four young sons to sing with him in the recording studio and in concert. Mordechai began calling himself by his Hebrew patronymic, Mordechai Ben David, when he launched his solo singing career in the 1970s.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Upon arrival in New York, Werdyger began working as a hazzan in the Warshever Shul on Rivington Street; after a year he moved to the Chasam Sofer Shul on the Lower East Side. His fame as a hazzan spread, and he signed a contract with the New Lots Talmud Torah Shul, which was famous for the high-caliber hazzanim that it attracted. Within a few months of this appointment, he began receiving invitations to appear in concert, and he performed before audiences of thousands in Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and other cities. He also started training with a voice coach, who taught him how to create his own cantorial compositions. During this time he also opened Werdyger Travel in Brooklyn.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Later, Werdyger moved to the Rabbi Meir Simcha Hakohein Shul in East Flatbush, headed by Chabad Rabbi Jacob J. Hecht. Rabbi Hecht tapped him to sing cantorial selections on his weekly radio program, Shema Yisrael, which exposed Werdyger to even larger audiences. Rabbi Hecht also advised him to make a record. In 1959, Werdyger went to a professional recording studio to record his first record, Tefillah L'David, which sold out its first production. In 1960, Werdyger recorded another album, Mizmor LeDavid, which was also favorably received.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After that, Werdyger started his own recording label, Aderet Records, to record Hasidic niggunim (melodies) which were unknown to non-Hasidic religious Jews in America. He asked Yankel Talmud to provide him with the best Gerrer melodies and released Songs of the Gerer Chassidim Loi Sevoishi in 1962. His next album, A Melitzer Oneg Shabbos, introduced Melitzer niggunim, including several tunes composed by the Melitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Yitzchak Horowitz, whom Werdyger met while vacationing in Miami. Werdyger's third album, A Gerer Melava Malka, featuring a solo by his young son, Mordechai, sold over 30,000 copies. Subsequently, Werdyger recorded the niggunim of the Skulener Rebbe, Rabbi Eliezer Zusia Portugal, on Skulaner Chassidic Nigunim Vol. 1 and Skulaner Nigunim 2, and of the Bobover Rebbe, Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam, on Bobover Niggunim.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Werdyger's successful albums led to concert appearances in the United States, Canada, and England, in which he sang both cantorial and Hasidic melodies. Unsure of how his repertoire would be received at a yeshiva benefit concert in London, he requested accompaniment by a boys' choir. Forty boys accompanied him, and he discovered the value of adding child vocalists and soloists to his music. Thereafter, he produced an album for the Boyaner Hasidim on which he and his son Mordechai sang together, accompanied by the Boyaner's men's choir.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Werdyger continued to sing on albums produced by Aderet Records, including two Shabbos with the Werdygers collections produced by his son, Chaim. In 1997, he contributed cantorial renditions for the PBS documentary A Life Apart: Hasidism in America.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Following the death of his wife in 1980, Werdyger remarried Sarah Wercberger, widow of Wolf Wercberger and daughter of Rabbi Osher Zelig Marton, a dayan and shochet in pre-war Romania.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1993 Werdyger published his autobiography, Songs of Hope, as part of the Holocaust Diaries series published by CIS Publishers.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2014 - Recordings by U2, (The Joshua Tree), the Everly Brothers, ('Cathy's Clown'), Jeff Buckley, ('Hallelujah'), Linda Ronstadt, (Heart Like a Wheel) and Creedence Clearwater Revival's('Fortunate Son') were among those newly selected for induction into the Library of Congress National Recording Registry.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2014 – Lyndsie Holland, English singer and actress, known for her performances in the contralto roles of the Savoy Operas, dies at age 75, after a heart attack, at a nursing home in Streatham.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After beginning her singing career in the chorus of the Sadler's Wells Opera in 1968, Holland starred in the Gilbert and Sullivan contralto roles with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company for seven years, beginning in 1970. In later years, she performed in musical theatre and concerts.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Holland was born Margaret Foster in Pedmore, a suburb of Stourbridge, the youngest of eight children. She attended Stourbridge High School and began clerical work at British Road Services in Kingswinford, later working as a telephonist in Birmingham for a firm of stockbrokers. She began taking singing lessons and performed, at first, in some local musicals and with a Kingswinford-based male choir, the Gentlemen Songsters in Stourbridge. She then joined the Midland Music Makers Grand Opera Society, an amateur operatic society, where she performed for three years, eventually playing Konchakovna in Prince Igor. This was seen by a talent scout from Sadler's Wells Opera. She debuted with Sadler's Wells in September 1968, in the chorus, where she played in twenty-three operas. Holland adopted, for her stage name, the maiden names of her two grandmothers.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In December 1970, she joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Her first role, in March 1971, was .... Sangazure in their newly revived production of The Sorcerer, and she was soon performing major roles in ten of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, adding Little Buttercup in H.M.S. Pinafore, Ruth in The Pirates of Penzance, .... Jane in Patience, the Queen of the Fairies in Iolanthe, .... Blanche in Princess Ida, Katisha in The Mikado, Dame Hannah in Ruddigore, Dame Carruthers in The Yeomen of the Guard, and the Duchess of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers. She continued to play these roles for seven years, leaving the company in July 1977.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1975, she had the opportunity to re-create the roles of .... Sophy in Utopia, Limited and the Baroness in The Grand Duke, which had not been performed professionally in Britain since the 1890s. She also sang the role of Little Buttercup at the Royal Command Performance at Windsor Castle.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In later years, Holland performed in concerts both in Britain and elsewhere. She appeared in the UK national tour of Evita in 1986–1987 and in Ivor Novello's Perchance to Dream at the Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich. She continued to perform in Gilbert and Sullivan operas and gave concerts at, among other places, the Stourbridge Town Hall.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and Decca Records, she recorded five of her roles: ....

She also appeared as Little Buttercup in the company's 1973 ATV film of H.M.S. Pinafore.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2014 – Harris Goldsmith, American pianist, music teacher and classical music critic, dies at age 77.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born in New York City, Goldsmith's family moved to Cuba for a year in 1938, to aid European Jews seeking to escape antisemitic persecution. Goldsmith studied at the Manhattan School of Music under Robert Goldsand. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in music from the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied with Robert Goldsand as a piano student. His early musical influences included conductors Arturo Toscanini and Guido Cantelli, and he was deeply affected by Cantelli's death in 1956.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Goldsmith, known among his peers as an opinionated musician, was recommended by one of his instructors to become a music critic. Goldsmith began writing music criticism as a record reviewer for High Fidelity in 1960, where he became an influential voice during the \"heyday of the classical LP\". His friends claimed that he could remember \"every note of music he's ever heard\". In a 2013 interview with New York City culture critic Sara Fishko, he recalled a performance by Toscanini 60 years earlier: \"The one that really blew me away is the Eroica he did on December 6, 1953, because I already was well familiar with the piece from his 1949 recording\". While Goldsmith could be effusive over performances, he became well known early in his criticism career for his barbed reviews. Remembering a review of Chopin preludes performed by Alexander Brailowsky, he said, \"I really roasted it... I said, 'Alexander Brailowsky indulges in cliches and vagaries of taste. His performance is grotesque, fragmentary and clumsy.'\" He went on to write for High Fidelity's successor publication, Musical America, as well as contributing to Opus, the New York Post, and The New York Times. He also provided liner notes for many re-releases of classical music recordings, and organized a 12 disc set recordings by Guido Cantelli, which he annotated. He shared a 1995 Grammy Award for Best Historical Album for his liner notes accompanying The Heifetz Collection.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Goldsmith played his debut piano performance in April 1965 at New York City's Town Hall. He made a number of recordings for various record labels in the 1970s, including a collection of Beethoven sonatas, and other releases of works by Johannes Brahms, Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Goldsmith was also a music teacher himself. He was a visiting professor at Binghamton University, gave classes at the Eastman School of Music, and coached students at the Yale Summer School of Music. He was a professor of music literature and chamber music at Mannes College from 1994 until his death. Students he has worked with include noted pianists Cecile Licad and Jenny Lin.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2015 – Dennis Michael Marks, head of music at BBC Television in the 1980s and from 1993 to 1997 was general director of English National Opera, dies at age 66. He was also a maker of television documentaries, broadcaster and author.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Marks was born to Jewish parents; his father was the son of immigrants from Ukraine. Brought up in Harrow, London, Marks was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Originally he hoped for a career in the theatre and was a member of the National Youth Theatre. Obtaining a job, originally as a researcher, at the BBC, he became a director and producer of television arts programmes. While making a programme in 1972 about Shandy Hall (home of the writer Laurence Sterne), he met the writer Michael Frayn and the two became lifelong friends. Leaving the BBC to work as an independent producer, Marks was invited back by Alan Yentob and eventually became Head of Music Programmes at the BBC. During this time he became involved in opera, including directing television versions of Michael Tippett's New Year and Mark-Anthony Turnage's Greek.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1993 Marks succeeded Peter Jonas as General Director of English National Opera (ENO). He inherited financial problems (the company already had a deficit of over ₤3 million) and a roster of new productions which initially drew low audiences and poor critical reception, including a controversial production of Alfred Schnittke's Life with an ...... However, Marks wrote, \"At ENO I was surprised and delighted to discover that the elusive force known as 'word of mouth' can overcome even the most savage press reactions. More than one show panned by the press still played to full houses and put two fingers up to its detractors.\" Although audiences increased, particularly for a well-received production of Carmen, and revenues improved,[6] Marks found himself increasingly at odds with the ENO Board of Directors, especially over his proposals to move the company's home from the expensive and elderly London Coliseum theatre to a new build out of the central London area. These disagreements, and lack of cogent funding proposals from the Arts Council, led to his resignation in 1997.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After leaving the ENO, Marks devoted himself to writing, broadcasting and travelling. In 2004 he scripted and directed a filmed version, with the tenor Ian Bostridge and the soprano Ruby Philogene, of Leoš Janáček's song cycle, The Diary of One Who Disappeared, and was a lead presenter of an entire day dedicated to Janáček on BBC Radio 3. In 2011 he published a book about the writer Joseph Roth. In a 2013 radio programme for BBC Radio 4, Little Moscow in Israel, Marks examined the effects of the immigration of Russian Jews to Israel. Although already seriously ill, Marks was in the audience for the new ENO production of Wagner's The Mastersingers shortly before his death.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2016 – Leandro \"Gato\" Barbieri, Argentine jazz tenor saxophonist and composer who rose to fame during the free jazz movement in the 1960s and is known for his Latin jazz recordings of the 1970s, dies at age 83 from pneumonia in New York City. His nickname, Gato, is Spanish for \"cat\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born to a family of musicians, Barbieri began playing music after hearing Charlie Parker's \"Now's the Time\". He played the clarinet and later the alto saxophone while performing with the Argentinean pianist Lalo Schifrin in the late 1950s. By the early 1960s, while playing in Rome, he also worked with the trumpeter Don Cherry. By now influenced by John Coltrane's late recordings, as well as those from other free jazz saxophonists such as Albert Ayler and Pharoah Sanders, he began to develop the warm and gritty tone with which he is associated. In the late 1960s, he was fusing music from South America into his playing and contributed to multi-artist projects like Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra and Carla Bley's Escalator Over The Hill. His score for Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 film Last Tango in Paris earned him a Grammy Award and led to a record deal with Impulse! Records[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]By the mid-70s, he was recording for A&M Records and moved his music towards soul-jazz and jazz-pop. Caliente! (1976) included his best known song, a rendition of Carlos Santana's \"Europa\". That and the follow-up album, Ruby Ruby (1977) were both produced by fellow musician and label co-founder, Herb Alpert.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Although he continued to record and perform well into the 1980s, including composing the scores to films such as Firepower (1979) and Strangers Kiss (1983), the death of his wife Michelle led him to withdraw from the public arena. He returned to recording and performing in the late 1990s, composing original scores at the behest of friend Bahman Maghsoudlou for Amir Naderi's Manhattan by Numbers (1991) and Daryush Shokof's Seven Servants (1996).

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]German composer and pianist. Born in Hamburg into a Lutheran family, Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna, Austria. His reputation and status as a composer is such that he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the \"Three Bs\" of music, a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von Bülow.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms composed for symphony orchestra, chamber ensembles, piano, organ, and voice and chorus. A virtuoso pianist, he premiered many of his own works. He worked with some of the leading performers of his time, including the pianist Clara Schumann and the violinist Joseph Joachim (the three were close friends). Many of his works have become staples of the modern concert repertoire. An uncompromising perfectionist, Brahms destroyed some of his works and left others unpublished.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms has been considered, by his contemporaries and by later writers, as both a traditionalist and an innovator. His music is firmly rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Classical masters. While many contemporaries found his music too academic, his contribution and craftsmanship have been admired by subsequent figures as diverse as Arnold Schoenberg and Edward Elgar. The diligent, highly constructed nature of Brahms's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers. Embedded within his meticulous structures, however, are deeply romantic motifs.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms's father, Johann Jakob Brahms (1806–72), was from the town of Heide in Holstein. The family name was also sometimes spelt 'Brahmst' or 'Brams', and derives from 'Bram', the German word for the shrub broom. Against the family's will, Johann Jakob pursued a career in music, arriving in Hamburg in 1826, where he found work as a jobbing musician and a string and wind player. In 1830, he married Johanna Henrika Christiane Nissen (1789–1865), a seamstress 17 years older than he was. In the same year he was appointed as a horn player in the Hamburg militia. Eventually he became a double-bass player in the Hamburg Stadttheater and the Hamburg Philharmonic Society. As Johann Jakob prospered, the family moved over the years to ever better accommodation in Hamburg. Johannes Brahms was born in 1833; his sister Elisabeth (Elise) had been born in 1831 and a younger brother Fritz Friedrich (Fritz) was born in 1835. Fritz also became a pianist; overshadowed by his brother he emigrated to Caracas in 1867, and later returned to Hamburg as a teacher.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Johann Jakob gave his son his first musical training; Johannes also learnt to play the violin and the basics of playing the cello. From 1840 he studied piano with Otto Friedrich Willibald Cossel (1813–1865). Cossel complained in 1842 that Brahms \"could be such a good player, but he will not stop his never-ending composing.\" At the age of 10, Brahms made his debut as a performer in a private concert including Beethoven's quintet for piano and winds Op. 16 and a piano quartet by Mozart. He also played as a solo work an étude of Henri Herz. By 1845 he had written a piano sonata in G minor. Brahms's parents disapproved of his early efforts as a composer, feeling that he had better career prospects as a performer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From 1845 to 1848 Brahms studied with Cossel's teacher the pianist and composer Eduard Marxsen (1806–1887). Marxsen had been a personal acquaintance of Beethoven and Schubert, admired the works of Mozart and Haydn, and was a devotee of the music of J. S. Bach. Marxsen conveyed to Brahms the tradition of these composers and ensured that Brahms's own compositions were grounded in that tradition. In 1847 Brahms made his first public appearance as a solo pianist in Hamburg, playing a Fantasy of Sigismund Thalberg. His first full piano recital, in 1848, included a fugue by Bach as well as works by Marxsen and contemporary virtuosi such as Jacob Rosenhain. A second recital in April 1849 included Beethoven's Waldstein sonata and a waltz fantasia of his own composition, and garnered favourable newspaper reviews.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms's compositions at this period are known to have included piano music, chamber music and works for male voice choir. Under the pseudonym 'G.W. Marks' some piano arrangements and fantasies were published by the Hamburg firm of Cranz in 1849. The earliest of Brahms's works which he acknowledged (his Scherzo Op. 4 and the song Heimkehr Op. 7 no. 6) date from 1851. However Brahms was later assiduous in eliminating all his early works; even as late as 1880 he wrote to his friend Elise Giesemann to send him his manuscripts of choral music so that they could be destroyed.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Lurid stories of the impoverished adolescent Brahms playing in bars and brothels have only anecdotal provenance, and modern scholars dismiss them; the Brahms family was relatively prosperous, and Hamburg legislation in any case very strictly forbade music in, or the admittance of minors to, brothels.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1850 Brahms met with the Hungarian violinist Ede Reményi and accompanied him in a number of recitals over the next few years. This was Brahms's introduction to \"gypsy-style\" music such as the czardas, which was later to prove the foundation of his most lucrative and popular compositions, the two sets of Hungarian Dances (1869 and 1880). 1850 also marked Brahms's first contact (albeit a failed one) with Robert Schumann; during Schumann's visit to Hamburg that year, friends persuaded Brahms to send the former some of his compositions, but the package was returned unopened.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1853 Brahms went on a concert tour with Reményi. In late May the two visited the violinist and composer Joseph Joachim at Hanover. Brahms had earlier heard Joachim playing the solo part in Beethoven's violin concerto and been deeply impressed. Brahms played some of his own solo piano pieces for Joachim, who remembered fifty years later: \"Never in the course of my artist's life have I been more completely overwhelmed\". This was the beginning of a friendship which was lifelong, albeit temporarily derailed when Brahms took the side of Joachim's wife in their divorce proceedings of 1883. Brahms also admired Joachim as a composer, and in 1856 they were to embark on a mutual training exercise to improve their skills in (in Brahms's words) \"double counterpoint, canons, fugues, preludes or whatever\". Bozarth notes that \"products of Brahms's study of counterpoint and early music over the next few years included \"dance pieces, preludes and fugues for organ, and neo-Renaissance and neo-Baroque choral works.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After meeting Joachim, Brahms and Reményi visited Weimar, where Brahms met Franz Liszt, Peter Cornelius, and Joachim Raff, and where Liszt performed Brahms's Op. 4 Scherzo at sight. Reményi claimed that Brahms then slept during Liszt's performance of his own Sonata in B minor; this and other disagreements led Reményi and Brahms to part company.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms visited Düsseldorf in October 1853, and, with a letter of introduction from Joachim, was welcomed by Schumann and his wife Clara. Schumann, greatly impressed and delighted by the 20-year-old's talent, published an article entitled \"Neue Bahne\" (\"New Paths\") in the 28 October issue of the journal Neue Zeitschrift für Musik nominating Brahms as one who was \"fated to give expression to the times in the highest and most ideal manner\". This praise may have aggravated Brahms's self-critical standards of perfection and dented his confidence. He wrote to Schumann in November 1853 that his praise \"will arouse such extraordinary expectations by the public that I don't know how I can begin to fulfil them\". While in Düsseldorf, Brahms participated with Schumann and Schumann's pupil Albert Dietrich in writing a movement each of a violin sonata for Joachim, the \"F-A-E Sonata\", the letters representing the initials of Joachim's personal motto Frei aber einsam (\"Free but alone\").[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Schumann's accolade led to the first publication of Brahms's works under his own name. Brahms went to Leipzig where Breitkopf & Härtel published his Opp. 1–4 (the Piano Sonatas nos. 1 and 2, the Six Songs Op. 3, and the Scherzo Op. 4), whilst Bartholf Senff published the Third Piano Sonata Op. 5 and the Six Songs Op. 6. In Leipzig, he gave recitals including his own first two piano sonatas, and met with among others Ferdinand David, Ignaz Moscheles, and Hector Berlioz.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After Schumann's attempted suicide and subsequent confinement in a mental sanatorium near Bonn in February 1854 (where he would die of pneumonia in 1856), Brahms based himself in Düsseldorf, where he supported the household and dealt with business matters on Clara's behalf. Clara was not allowed to visit Robert until two days before his death, but Brahms was able to visit him and acted as a go-between. Brahms began to feel deeply for Clara, who to him represented an ideal of womanhood. Their intensely emotional relationship, which however seems never to have moved beyond close friendship, would last until Clara's death. In June 1854 Brahms dedicated to Clara his Op. 9, the Variations on a Theme of Schumann. Clara continued to support Brahms's career by programming his music in her recitals.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After the publication of his Op. 10 Ballades for piano, Brahms published no further works until 1860. His major project of this period was the Piano Concerto in D minor, which he had begun as a work for two pianos in 1854 but soon realized needed a larger-scale format. Based in Hamburg at this time, he gained, with Clara's support, a position as musician to the tiny court of Detmold, the capital of the Principality of Lippe, where he spent the winters of 1857 to 1860 and for which he wrote his two Serenades (1858 and 1859, Opp. 11 and 16). In Hamburg he established a women's choir for which he wrote music and conducted. To this period also belong his first two Piano Quartets (Op. 25 and Op. 26) and the first movement of the third Piano Quartet, which eventually appeared in 1875.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The end of the decade brought professional setbacks for Brahms. The premiere of the First Piano Concerto in Hamburg on 22 January 1859, with the composer as soloist, was poorly received. Brahms wrote to Joachim that the performance was \"a brilliant and decisive – failure...t forces one to concentrate one's thoughts and increases one's courage...But the hissing was too much of a good thing...\" At a second performance, audience reaction was so hostile that Brahms had to be restrained from leaving the stage after the first movement. As a consequence of these reactions Breitkopf and Härtel declined to take on his new compositions. Brahms consequently established a relationship with other publishers, including Simrock, who eventually became his major publishing partner. Brahms further made an intervention in 1860 in the debate on the future of German music which seriously misfired. Together with Joachim and others, he prepared an attack on Liszt's followers, the so-called \"New German School\" (although Brahms himself was sympathetic to the music of Richard Wagner, the School's leading light). In particular they objected to the rejection of traditional musical forms and to the \"rank, miserable weeds growing from Liszt-like fantasias\". A draft was leaked to the press, and the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik published a parody which ridiculed Brahms and his associates as backward-looking. Brahms never again ventured into public musical polemics.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms's personal life was also troubled. In 1859 he became engaged to Agathe von Siebold. The engagement was soon broken off, but even after this Brahms wrote to her: \"I love you! I must see you again, but I am incapable of bearing fetters. Please write me ... whether ... I may come again to clasp you in my arms, to kiss you, and tell you that I love you.\" They never saw one another again, and Brahms later confirmed to a friend that Agathe was his \"last love\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms had hoped to be given the conductorship of the Hamburg Philharmonic, but in 1862 this post was given to the baritone Julius Stockhausen. (Brahms continued to hope for the post; but when he was finally offered the directorship in 1893, he demurred as he had \"got used to the idea of having to go along other paths\".) In autumn 1862 Brahms made his first visit to Vienna, staying there over the winter. There he became an associate of two close members of Wagner's circle, his earlier friend Peter Cornelius and Karl Tausig, and of Joseph Hellmesberger Sr. and Julius Epstein, respectively the Director and head of violin studies, and the head of piano studies, at the Vienna Conservatoire. Brahms's circle grew to include the notable critic (and opponent of the 'New German School') Eduard Hanslick, the conductor Hermann Levi and the surgeon Theodor Billroth, who were to become amongst his greatest advocates.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In January 1863 came Brahms's first meeting with Richard Wagner, for whom he played his Handel Variations Op. 24, which he had completed the previous year. The meeting was cordial, although Wagner was in later years to make critical, and even insulting, comments on Brahms's music. Brahms however retained at this time and later a keen interest in Wagner's music, helping with preparations for Wagner's Vienna concerts in 1862/63, and being rewarded by Tausig with a manuscript of part of Wagner's Tannhäuser (which Wagner demanded back in 1875). The Handel Variations also featured, together with the first Piano Quartet, in Brahms's first Viennese recitals, in which his performances were better-received by the public and critics than his music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Although Brahms entertained the idea of taking up conducting posts elsewhere, he based himself increasingly in Vienna and soon made it his home. In 1863, he was appointed conductor of the Vienna Singakademie. He surprised his audiences by programming much work of the early German masters such as J. S. Bach and Heinrich Schütz and other early composers such as Giovanni Gabrieli; more recent music was represented by works of Beethoven and Felix Mendelssohn. He also wrote works for the choir, including his Op. 29 \"Motet\". Finding however that the post encroached too much of the time he needed for composing, he left the choir in June 1864. From 1864 to 1876 he spent many of his summers in Lichtental, today part of Baden-Baden, where Clara Schumann and her family also spent some time. His house in Lichtental, where he worked on many of his major compositions including A German Requiem and his middle-period chamber works is today preserved as a museum.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In February 1865 Brahms's mother died, and he began to compose his large choral work A German Requiem Op. 45, of which six movements were completed by 1866. Premieres of the first three movements were given in Vienna, but the complete work was first given in Bremen in 1868 to great acclaim. A seventh movement (the soprano solo \"Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit\") was added for the equally successful Leipzig premiere (February 1869), and the work went on to receive concert and critical acclaim throughout Germany and also in England, Switzerland and Russia, marking effectively Brahms's arrival on the world stage. Brahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of Hungarian Dances (1865), the Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 52, (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp. 43 and 46–49). Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata Rinaldo (1863–1868), his first two string quartets Op. 51 nos. 1 and 2 (1865–1873), the third piano quartet (1855–1875), and most notably his first symphony which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From 1872 to 1875, Brahms was director of the concerts of the Vienna Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. He ensured that the orchestra was staffed only by professionals, and conducted a repertoire which ran from Bach to the nineteenth century composers who were not of the 'New German School'; these included Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Joachim, Ferdinand Hiller, Max Bruch and himself (notably his large scale choral works, the German Requiem, the Alto Rhapsody, Op. 53, and the patriotic Triumphlied, Op. 55, which celebrated Prussia's victory in the 1870/71 Franco-Prussian War. 1873 saw the premiere of his orchestral Variations on a Theme by Haydn, originally conceived for two pianos, which has become one of his most popular works.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms's first symphony, Op. 68, appeared in 1876, though it had been begun (and a version of the first movement had been announced by Brahms to Clara and to Albert Dietrich) in the early 1860s. During the decade it evolved very gradually; the finale may not have begun its conception until 1868.[43] Brahms was cautious and typically self-deprecating about the symphony during its creation, writing to his friends that it was \"long and difficult\", \"not exactly charming\" and, significantly \"long and in C Minor\", which, as Richard Taruskin points out, made it clear \"that Brahms was taking on the model of models [for a symphony]: Beethoven's Fifth.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In May 1876, Cambridge University offered to grant honorary degrees of Doctor of Music to both Brahms and Joachim, provided that they composed new pieces as \"theses\" and were present in Cambridge to receive their degrees. Brahms was averse to traveling to England, and requested to receive the degree 'in absentia', offering as his thesis the previously performed (November 1876) symphony. But of the two, only Joachim went to England and only he was granted a degree. Brahms \"acknowledged the invitation\" by giving the manuscript score and parts of his first symphony to Joachim, who led the performance at Cambridge March 8, 1877 (English premiere).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Despite the warm reception the first symphony received, Brahms remained dissatisfied and extensively revised the second movement before the work was published. There followed a succession of well-received orchestral works; the Second Symphony Op. 73 (1877), the Violin concerto Op. 77 (1878), dedicated to Joachim who was consulted closely during its composition, and the Academic Festival Overture (written following the conferring of an honorary degree by the University of Breslau) and Tragic Overture of 1880. The commendation of Brahms by Breslau as \"the leader in the art of serious music in Germany today\" led to a bilious comment from Wagner in his essay \"On Poetry and Composition\": \"I know of some famous composers who in their concert masquerades don the disguise of a street-singer one day, the hallelujah periwig of Handel the next , the dress of a Jewish Czardas-fiddler another time, and then again the guise of a highly respectable symphony dressed up as Number Ten\" (referring to Brahms's First Symphony as a putative tenth symphony of Beethoven).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms was now recognised as a major figure in the world of music. He had been on the jury which awarded the Vienna State Prize to the (then little-known) composer Antonín Dvořák three times, first in February 1875, and later in 1876 and 1877 and had successfully recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock. The two men met for the first time in 1877, and Dvořák dedicated to Brahms his String Quartet, Op. 44 of that year. He also began to be the recipient of a variety of honours; Ludwig II of Bavaria awarded him the Maximilian Order for Science and Art in 1874, and the music loving Duke George of Meiningen awarded him in 1881 the Commander's Cross of the Order of the House of Meiningen.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At this time Brahms also chose to change his image. Having been always clean-shaven, in 1878 he surprised his friends by growing a beard, writing in September to the conductor Bernhard Scholz \"I am coming with a large beard! Prepare your wife for a most awful sight.\" The singer George Henschel recalled that after a concert \"I saw a man unknown to me, rather stout, of middle height, with long hair and a full beard. In a very deep and hoarse voice he introduced himself as 'Musikdirektor Müller'... an instant later, we all found ourselves laughing heartily at the perfect success of Brahms's disguise\". The incident also displays Brahms's love of practical jokes.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1882 Brahms completed his Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 83, dedicated to his teacher Marxsen. Brahms was invited by Hans von Bülow to undertake a premiere of the work with the Meiningen Court Orchestra; this was the beginning of his collaboration with Meiningen and with von Bülow, who was to rank Brahms as one of the 'Three Bs'; in a letter to his wife he wrote \"You know what I think of Brahms: after Bach and Beethoven the greatest, the most sublime of all composers.\" The following years saw the premieres of his Third Symphony Op. 90 (1883) and his Fourth Symphony Op. 98 (1885). Richard Strauss, who had been appointed assistant to von Bülow at Meiningen, and had been uncertain about Brahms's music, found himself converted by the Third Symphony and was enthusiastic about the Fourth: \"a giant work, great in concept and invention.\" Another, but cautious, supporter from the younger generation was Gustav Mahler who first met Brahms in 1884 and remained a close acquaintance; he rated Brahms as superior to Anton Bruckner, but more earth-bound than Wagner and Beethoven.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1889, Theo Wangemann, a representative of the American inventor Thomas Edison, visited the composer in Vienna and invited him to make an experimental recording. Brahms played an abbreviated version of his first Hungarian Dance and of Josef Strauss's Die Libelle on the piano. Although the spoken introduction to the short piece of music is quite clear, the piano playing is largely inaudible due to heavy surface noise. In the same year, Brahms was named an honorary citizen of Hamburg, until 1948 the only one born in Hamburg.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms had become acquainted with Johann Strauss II, who was eight years his senior, in the 1870s, but their close friendship belongs to the years 1889 and after. Brahms admired much of Strauss's music, and encouraged the composer to sign up with his publisher Simrock. In autographing a fan for Strauss's wife Adele, Brahms wrote the opening notes of notes of The Blue Danube waltz adding the words \"unfortunately not by Johannes Brahms\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After the successful Vienna premiere of his Second String Quintet, op. 111, in 1890, the 57-year-old Brahms came to think that he might retire from composition, telling a friend that he \"had achieved enough; here I had before me a carefree old age and could enjoy it in peace.\" He also began to find solace in escorting the mezzo-soprano Alice Barbi and may have proposed to her (she was only 28). His admiration for Richard Mühlfeld, clarinettist with the Meiningen orchestra, revived his interest in composing and led him to write the Clarinet Trio, Op. 114, Clarinet Quintet, Op. 115 (1891), and the two Clarinet Sonatas, Op. 120 (1894). Brahms also wrote at this time his final cycles of piano pieces, Opp. 116–119, the Vier ernste Gesänge (Four Serious Songs), Op. 121 (1896) (which were prompted by the death of Clara Schumann), and the Eleven Chorale Preludes for organ, Op. 122 (1896). Many of these works were written in his house in Bad Ischl, where Brahms had first visited in 1882 and where he spent every summer from 1889 onwards.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the summer of 1896 Brahms was diagnosed as having jaundice, but later in the year his Viennese doctor diagnosed him as having cancer of the liver (from which his father Jakob had died). Brahms's last public appearance was on 3 March 1897, when he saw Hans Richter conduct his Symphony No. 4. There was an ovation after each of the four movements. He made the effort, three weeks before his death, to attend the premiere of Strauss's operetta Die Göttin der Vernunft (de) in March 1897. His condition gradually worsened and he died a month later, on 3 April 1897, aged 63. Brahms is buried in the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna, under a monument by Victor Horta and the sculptor Ilse von Twardowski-Conrat.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms wrote a number of major works for orchestra, including two serenades, four symphonies, two piano concertos (No. 1 in D minor; No. 2 in B-flat major), a Violin Concerto, a Double Concerto for violin and cello, and two companion orchestral overtures, the Academic Festival Overture and the Tragic Overture.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His large choral work A German Requiem is not a setting of the liturgical Missa pro defunctis but a setting of texts which Brahms selected from the Luther Bible. The work was composed in three major periods of his life. An early version of the second movement was first composed in 1854, not long after Robert Schumann's attempted suicide, and this was later used in his first piano concerto. The majority of the Requiem was composed after his mother's death in 1865. The fifth movement was added after the official premiere in 1868, and the work was published in 1869.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms's works in variation form include, among others, the Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel and the Paganini Variations, both for solo piano, and the Variations on a Theme by Haydn (now sometimes called the Saint Anthony Variations) in versions for two pianos and for orchestra. The final movement of the Fourth Symphony, Op. 98, is formally a passacaglia.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His chamber works include three string quartets, two string quintets, two string sextets, a clarinet quintet, a clarinet trio, a horn trio, a piano quintet, three piano quartets, and four piano trios (the fourth being published posthumously). He composed several instrumental sonatas with piano, including three for violin, two for cello, and two for clarinet (which were subsequently arranged for viola by the composer). His solo piano works range from his early piano sonatas and ballades to his late sets of character pieces. Brahms was a significant Lieder composer, who wrote over 200 of them. His chorale preludes for organ, Op. 122, which he wrote shortly before his death, have become an important part of the organ repertoire.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms was an extreme perfectionist. He destroyed many early works – including a violin sonata he had performed with Reményi and violinist Ferdinand David – and once claimed to have destroyed 20 string quartets before he issued his official First in 1873. Over the course of several years, he changed an original project for a symphony in D minor into his first piano concerto. In another instance of devotion to detail, he laboured over the official First Symphony for almost fifteen years, from about 1861 to 1876. Even after its first few performances, Brahms destroyed the original slow movement and substituted another before the score was published. (A conjectural restoration of the original slow movement has been published by Robert Pascall.)[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Another factor that contributed to Brahms's perfectionism was Schumann's early enthusiasm, which Brahms was determined to live up to. Schumann's early approbation was a challenge to the composer's self-confidence, and may have contributed to the delay in producing the First Symphony.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms strongly preferred writing absolute music that does not refer to an explicit scene or narrative, and he never wrote an opera or a symphonic poem.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Despite his reputation as a serious composer of large, complex musical structures, some of Brahms's most widely known and most commercially successful compositions during his life were small-scale works of popular intent aimed at the thriving contemporary market for domestic music-making. During the 20th century, the influential American critic B. H. Haggin, rejecting more mainstream views, argued in his various guides to recorded music that Brahms was at his best in such works and much less successful in larger forms. Among the most cherished of these lighter works by Brahms are his sets of popular dances, the Hungarian Dances, the Waltzes for piano duet (Op. 39), and the Liebeslieder Waltzes for vocal quartet and piano, and some of his many songs, notably the Wiegenlied (Op. 49, No. 4, published in 1868). This last was written (to a folk text) to celebrate the birth of a son to Brahms's friend Bertha Faber and is universally known as Brahms's Lullaby.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms maintained a classical sense of form and order in his works, in contrast to the opulence of the music of many of his contemporaries. Thus, many admirers (though not necessarily Brahms himself) saw him as the champion of traditional forms and \"pure music\", as opposed to the \"New German\" embrace of programme music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms venerated Beethoven; in the composer's home, a marble bust of Beethoven looked down on the spot where he composed, and some passages in his works are reminiscent of Beethoven's style. Brahms's First Symphony bears strongly the influence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, as the two works are both in C minor and end in the struggle towards a C major triumph. The main theme of the finale of the First Symphony is also reminiscent of the main theme of the finale of Beethoven's Ninth, and when this resemblance was pointed out to Brahms he replied that any dunce could see that. In 1876, when the work was premiered in Vienna, it was immediately hailed as \"Beethoven's Tenth\". However, the similarity of Brahms's music to that of late Beethoven had first been noted as early as November 1853 in a letter from Albert Dietrich to Ernst Naumann.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms was a master of counterpoint. \"For Brahms, ... the most complicated forms of counterpoint were a natural means of expressing his emotions,\" writes Geiringer. \"As Palestrina or Bach succeeded in giving spiritual significance to their technique, so Brahms could turn a canon in motu contrario or a canon per augmentationem into a pure piece of lyrical poetry.\" Writers on Brahms have commented on his use of counterpoint. For example, of Op. 9, Variations on a Theme by Robert Schumann, Geiringer writes that Brahms \"displays all the resources of contrapuntal art\". In the A Major piano quartet Opus 26, Swafford notes that the third movement is \"demonic-canonic\", echoing Haydn's famous minuet for string quartet called the 'Witch's Round'.\" Swafford further opines that \"thematic development, counterpoint, and form were the dominant technical terms in which Brahms... thought about music\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Allied to his skill in counterpoint was Brahms' subtle handling of rhythm and meter. The New Grove Dictionary of Music speculates that the teenage Brahms' contact with Hungarian and gypsy folk music led to \"his lifelong fascination with the irregular rhythms, triplet figures and use of rubato\" in his compositions. According to Michael Musgrave (1985, p. 269) \"only one composer rivals him in the advanced nature of his rhythmic thinking, and that is Stravinsky.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms' consummate skills in counterpoint and rhythm are richly present in A German Requiem, a work that was partially inspired by his mother's death in 1865 (at which time he composed a funeral march that was to become the basis of Part Two, Denn alles Fleisch), but it also incorporates material from a symphony which he started in 1854 but abandoned following Schumann's suicide attempt. He once wrote that the Requiem \"belonged to Schumann\". The first movement of this abandoned symphony was re-worked as the first movement of the First Piano Concerto.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms loved the classical composers Mozart and Haydn. He collected first editions and autographs of their works and edited performing editions. He studied the music of pre-classical composers, including Giovanni Gabrieli, Johann Adolph Hasse, Heinrich Schütz, Domenico Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, and, especially, Johann Sebastian Bach. His friends included leading musicologists, and, with Friedrich Chrysander, he edited an edition of the works of François Couperin. Brahms also edited works by C. P. E. Bach and W. F. Bach. He looked to older music for inspiration in the art of counterpoint; the themes of some of his works are modelled on Baroque sources such as Bach's The Art of Fugue in the fugal finale of Cello Sonata No. 1 or the same composer's Cantata No. 150 in the passacaglia theme of the Fourth Symphony's finale. Peter Phillips (2007) hears affinities between Brahms' rhythmically charged contrapuntal textures and those of Renaissance masters such as Giovanni Gabrieli and William Byrd. Referring to Byrd's Though Amaryllis dance, Philips remarks that \"the cross-rhythms in this piece so excited E. H. Fellowes that he likened them to Brahms's compositional style.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The early Romantic composers had a major influence on Brahms, particularly Schumann, who encouraged Brahms as a young composer. During his stay in Vienna in 1862–63, Brahms became particularly interested in the music of Franz Schubert. The latter's influence may be identified in works by Brahms dating from the period, such as the two piano quartets Op. 25 and Op. 26, and the Piano Quintet which alludes to Schubert's String Quintet and Grand Duo for piano four hands. The influence of Chopin and Mendelssohn on Brahms is less obvious, although occasionally one can find in his works what seems to be an allusion to one of theirs (for example, Brahms's Scherzo, Op. 4, alludes to Chopin's Scherzo in B-flat minor; the scherzo movement in Brahms's Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 5, alludes to the finale of Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in C minor).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms considered giving up composition when it seemed that other composers' innovations in extended tonality would result in the rule of tonality being broken altogether. Although Wagner became fiercely critical of Brahms as the latter grew in stature and popularity, he was enthusiastically receptive of the early Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel; Brahms himself, according to many sources, deeply admired Wagner's music, confining his ambivalence only to the dramaturgical precepts of Wagner's theory.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms wrote settings for piano and voice of 144 German folk songs, and many of his lieder reflect folk themes or depict scenes of rural life. His Hungarian Dances were among his most profitable compositions.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms' point of view looked both backward and forward; his output was often bold in its exploration of harmony and rhythm. As a result, he was an influence on composers of both conservative and modernist tendencies. Within his lifetime, his idiom left an imprint on several composers within his personal circle, who strongly admired his music, such as Heinrich von Herzogenberg, Robert Fuchs, and Julius Röntgen, as well as on Gustav Jenner, who was Brahms's only formal composition pupil. Antonín Dvořák, who received substantial assistance from Brahms, deeply admired his music and was influenced by it in several works, such as the Symphony No. 7 in D minor and the F minor Piano Trio. Features of the \"Brahms style\" were absorbed in a more complex synthesis with other contemporary (chiefly Wagnerian) trends by Hans Rott, Wilhelm Berger, Max Reger and Franz Schmidt, whereas the British composers Hubert Parry and Edward Elgar and the Swede Wilhelm Stenhammar all testified to learning much from Brahms's example. As Elgar said, \"I look at the Third Symphony of Brahms, and I feel like a pygmy.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ferruccio Busoni's early music shows much Brahmsian influence, and Brahms took an interest in him, though Busoni later tended to disparage Brahms. Towards the end of his life, Brahms offered substantial encouragement to Ernő Dohnányi and to Alexander von Zemlinsky. Their early chamber works (and those of Béla Bartók, who was friendly with Dohnányi) show a thoroughgoing absorption of the Brahmsian idiom. Zemlinsky, moreover, was in turn the teacher of Arnold Schoenberg, and Brahms was apparently impressed by drafts of two movements of Schoenberg's early Quartet in D major which Zemlinsky showed him in 1897. In 1933, Schoenberg wrote an essay \"Brahms the Progressive\" (re-written 1947), which drew attention to Brahms's fondness for motivic saturation and irregularities of rhythm and phrase; in his last book (Structural Functions of Harmony, 1948), he analysed Brahms's \"enriched harmony\" and exploration of remote tonal regions. These efforts paved the way for a re-evaluation of Brahms's reputation in the 20th century. Schoenberg went so far as to orchestrate one of Brahms's piano quartets. Schoenberg's pupil Anton Webern, in his 1933 lectures, posthumously published under the title The Path to the New Music, claimed Brahms as one who had anticipated the developments of the Second Viennese School, and Webern's own Op. 1, an orchestral passacaglia, is clearly in part a homage to, and development of, the variation techniques of the passacaglia-finale of Brahms's Fourth Symphony.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms was honoured in the German hall of fame, the Walhalla memorial. On 14 September 2000, he was introduced there as the 126th \"rühmlich ausgezeichneter Teutscher\" and 13th composer among them, with a bust by sculptor Milan Knobloch (de).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms was fond of nature and often went walking in the woods around Vienna. He often brought penny candy with him to hand out to children. To adults Brahms was often brusque and sarcastic, and he often alienated other people. His pupil Gustav Jenner wrote, \"Brahms has acquired, not without reason, the reputation for being a grump, even though few could also be as lovable as he.\" He also had predictable habits, which were noted by the Viennese press, such as his daily visit to his favourite \"Red Hedgehog\" tavern in Vienna, and his habit of walking with his hands firmly behind his back, which led to a caricature of him in this pose walking alongside a red hedgehog. Those who remained his friends were very loyal to him, however, and he reciprocated with equal loyalty and generosity.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms had amassed a small fortune in the second half of his career, when his works sold widely, but despite his wealth, he lived very simply, with a modest apartment, a mess of music papers and books, and a single housekeeper who cleaned and cooked for him. He was often the butt of jokes for his long beard, his cheap clothes and often not wearing socks. Brahms gave away large sums of money to friends and to aid various musical students, often with the term of strict secrecy. Brahms' domicile was hit during World War II, destroying his piano and other possessions that were still kept there for posterity by the Viennese.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brahms' personal views tended to be humanistic and skeptical, though one of his influences was undoubtedly the Bible as rendered in German by Martin Luther. His Requiem employs biblical texts primarily to speak words of comfort to the bereaved, yet it also cites Hebrews 13:14 (\"here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come\") and 1 Corinthians 15:51–52 (\"the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed\"). Composer Walter Niemann declared \"The fact that Brahms began his creative activity with the German folk song and closed with the Bible reveals... the true religious creed of this great man of the people.\" Some present-day biographers and critics view Brahms's appreciation of Lutheran tradition more as cultural than existential. When asked by conductor Karl Reinthaler to add additional sectarian text to his German Requiem, Brahms is reported to have responded, \"As far as the text is concerned, I confess that I would gladly omit even the word German and instead use Human; also with my best knowledge and will I would dispense with passages like John 3:16. On the other hand, I have chosen one thing or another because I am a musician, because I needed it, and because with my venerable authors I can't delete or dispute anything. But I had better stop before I say too much.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On his religious views, Brahms has been described as an agnostic and a humanist. The devout Catholic Antonín Dvořák wrote in a letter: \"Such a man, such a fine soul—and he believes in nothing! He believes in nothing!\" Brahms's final vocal and instrumental works, dating from 1896, are, respectively, Vier ernste Gesänge (Four Serious Songs), for voice and piano, Op. 121, settings of biblical texts; and Eleven Chorale Preludes, for organ, Op. 122, based upon nine Lutheran chorales.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAvlPT53Xsc\"]YouTube - Johannes Brahms Symphony No.1, mvt 1 of 2\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube - Johannes Brahms Symphony No.1, mvt 1 of 2[/ame][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1888 - Sir (John Frederick) Neville Cardus, English writer on music and cricket, is born at Manchester. He studied singing, then turned to journalism; wrote essays on numerous subjects, but primarily on cricket and music. In 1917 he joined the staff of the Manchester Guardian) then was its chief music critic (1927-39); from 1939 to 1947 he was in Australia, writing on cricket and music for the Sydney Morning Herald. Returning to London, he became music critic for the Manchester Guardian in 1951. He received the Wagner Medal of the City of Bayreuth in 1963, and in 1967 he was knighted. His literary style is quasi- Shavian in its colloquial manner and stubborn persuasion. - Died at London, Feb. 28,1975.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1889 - Grigoras Dinicu, (Romanian: [[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ɡ[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ri[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ɡ[/FONT][FONT=&quot]o[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ˈ[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ra[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ʃ[/FONT][FONT=&quot] i.o[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ˈ[/FONT][FONT=&quot]nik[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ə[/FONT][FONT=&quot] di[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ˈ[/FONT][FONT=&quot]niku violin virtuoso and composer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He is most famous for his often-played virtuoso violin showpiece \"Hora staccato\" (1906) and for making popular the tune Ciocârlia, composed by his grandfather Angheluș Dinicu for \"nai\" (the Romanian pan flute). It is rumored that Jascha Heifetz once said that Grigoraș Dinicu was the greatest violinist he had ever heard. In the 1930s he was involved in the political movement of the Romanian Roma and was made honorary president of the \"General Union of the Romanian Roma\". Other well known compositions are: Hora mărțișorului (Mărțișor, literally \"little March\", is a major Romanian seasonal holiday on March 1st), Ceasornicul (The Clock) and Căruța poștei (The Post Wagon).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was born in Bucharest, in the neighborhood of the lăutari named Scaune (Chairs). Because his father was busy with his activity as a lăutar, he handled him to \"moș Zamfir\", an old violinist, who taught him the first tunes. He attended the Bucharest Conservatory, where he studied with Dumitru Georgescu-Kiriac. The most famous of his teachers was Carl Flesch, the violin pedagogue, with whom he studied in 1902. He received a scholarship at the Vienna Conservatory, but he was not allowed to go there because he was Romani, an episode that he never forgot.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After graduation he played violin with the Orchestra of the Ministry of Public Instruction, and also performed as a soloist. Hora staccato dates from the beginning of this period; he wrote it as a graduation exercise. For forty years, from 1906 until 1946, he directed popular music concerts. He also toured abroad as a soloist and conductor, and he also played a great deal of light music in nightclubs, hotels, restaurants, and cafés in Bucharest and throughout Western Europe.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His music is mostly for violin and piano, though some pieces (such as Hora staccato) have later been arranged for other combinations of instruments (for example, trumpet and piano, as well as violin and orchestra and a popular arrangement by Russian mandolin virtuoso Dave Apollon).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He died in Bucharest of laryngeal cancer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Miscellanea[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The jazz manouche violinist Stéphane Grappelli was a great admirer of Dinicu and of the way that the violin was played in the lăutarească music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]3 APRIL[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 1 of 5[/FONT][FONT=&quot][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]3 April[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\nPage 2 of 5[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1895 - Bjarne Brustad, composer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1895 - Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, greatly significant Italian-born American composer, is born at Florence. He studied piano with Edoardo del Valle, and then continued his training at the Florence Conservatory, where he took diplomas in piano (1910) and in composition in Pizzetti's class (1913). He attained considerable eminence in Italy between the two world wars, and his music was often heard at European festivals. Political events forced him to leave Italy; in 1939 he settled in the U.S. and in 1946 became a naturalized American citizen. He became active as a composer for films in Hollywood, but continued to write large amounts of orchestral and chamber music. His style is remarkably fluent and adaptable, often reaching rhapsodic eloquence. - Died at Los Angeles, March 16, 1968.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1901 - Richard D'Oyly Carte, promotor (Gilbert and Sullivan operas), dies\n\nin 1902 - Siguringi Eirikur Hjorleifsson, composer is born.\n\nin 1904 - Peter Van Steeden, Amsterdam Neth, orch leader (Break the Bank)\n\nin 1909 - Benjamin Johnson Lang, composer, dies at 71\n\nin 1913 - George Barati, (real name, Gyorgy Barati), Hungarian-born American cellist, conductor, and composer, is born at Gyor.

Her appealing physical appearance and personality allowed her to become one of the few popular singers of her time to cross over to a career as a movie star, appearing in 39 feature films between 1948 and 1968. Initially she performed in movie musicals, but she achieved her greatest popularity in a series of romantic comedies in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nDay was the daughter of Frederick William von Kappelhoff, a church choral master and piano teacher, and Alma Sophia von Kappelhoff. She sang and danced as a child, and attended Pep's Golden Dance School, among other institutions. By her early teens she was performing in a dance act with partner Jerry Dougherty, with whom she won a local dance contest. The two performed on a vaudeville circuit and made a trip to L.A., where they planned to settle. But on Oct. 13, 1937, she was seriously injured in an automobile accident and forced to convalesce for more than a year. She switched her ambition to singing and took lessons from Grace Raine, who helped her gain exposure singing on local radio.\n\nThis led to her first professional job singing with Barney Rapp and His New Englanders. Rapp suggested she adopt Day as her stage name, inspired by the 1938 song \"Day After Day\" (music by Richard Himber, lyrics by Bud Green). Day quickly moved to the more prominent Bob Crosby Orch., then, in August 1940, to Les Brown and His Band of Renown, with whom she made her recording debut in November. But she quit the band in April 1941 to marry trombonist Al Jorden and retire from music. On Feb. 8, 1942, she bore a son, Terrence, who, as Terry Melcher, grew up to be a record producer, recording artist, and songwriter. In 1943 she divorced Jorden and moved back to Cincinnati, then rejoined Brown. With the end of the musicians' union recording ban in the fall of 1944, Brown was able to return to the recording studio and cut the ballad \"Sentimental Journey\" (music by Les Brown and Ben Homer, lyrics by Bud Green) with Day on vocals. The Columbia Records single hit #1 in May and sold a million copies. It was actually preceded to the top of the charts by its followup, \"My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time\" (music by Vic Mizzy, lyrics by Mann Curtis), another Day vocal, in April.\n\nBefore the end of 1945, two additional Brown-Day collaborations had reached the Top Ten, and Day sang on four more Brown recordings that reached the Top Ten between early 1946 and January 1947. On March 30,1946, Day married George Weidler, a saxophonist in Les Brown's orch. When Weidler left the band later in the year, she went with him, and the couple settled in Santa Monica, Calif. They divorced on May 31, 1949. Day had appeared on radio in N.Y., and she found more radio work in L.A., initially on the comedy series Sweeney and March, then on Your Hit Parade in 1947 and The Bob Hope Show in 1948.\n\nShe also made personal appearances, and it was while performing at the Little Club in N.Y.in March 1947 that she was spotted by a talent scout and brought back to Calif. for an audition with film director Michael Curtiz at Warner Bros. Curtiz cast her in the film musical Romance on the High Seas. Released in "
