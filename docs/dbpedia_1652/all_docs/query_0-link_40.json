I am nevertheless deeply thankful to each of them. Colombia is still experiencing violent conflict, and information is used in that conflict to punish and hurt ­those who speak, or ­those who are spoken of. Many h ­ uman rights workers, retired and active duty military officers, civilian officials, and victims of h ­ uman rights violations spoke with me off the rec­ord or on the condition their names not be used, while o ­ thers imposed no conditions. By name, I first thank San José Peace Community leaders and members, including ­those who visited the United States through the Fellowship of ­Reconciliation (for): Gildardo Tuberquia, Javier Sánchez, Brigida González, Renato Areiza, Jesús Emilio Tuberquia. I am grateful to Cecilia Zarate-­Laun of Colombia Support Network and to Eduar Lancheros for introducing me to the Peace Community. Their subsequent deaths are a deep loss. I could not have written this book without collaboration on previous proj­ ects with Alberto Yepes, Adriana Pestana, and other staff of the Coordinación Colombia–­Europa–­Estados Unidos. Many other ­human rights ­defenders in Bogotá, Medellín, Apartadó, Huila, and Arauca or­ga­nized interviews, provided contact information, and offered insights. ­These included ­Father Javier Giraldo, Liliana Uribe of Corporación Justicia Libertad, Rosa Liliana Ortiz of Observatorio Surcolombiano de Derechos Humanos, and ­others too\n\nnumerous or at risk to name h ­ ere. Gabriel Arias, Camilo Bernal, and Michael Reed Hurtado at the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for ­Human Rights in Colombia ­were always helpful. Colombian and U.S. military officers, soldiers, and diplomatic officials generously agreed to interviews that, though frequently off the rec­ord or on background, ­were fundamental to helping me understand both their institutions and U.S. military assistance to Colombia. Maiah Jaskoski at the Naval Postgraduate School and Kara Oryan and Jose Torres of National Defense University helped me meet and interview faculty and Colombian gradu­ates from their institutions. Congressional staff who ­were helpful in informing my analy­sis or provided information include Tim Rieser, Sascha Foertsch, Michael Kuiken, Asher Smith, Cindy Buhl, Teddy Miller, Emily Mendrala, and Jonathan Stivers. Many ­people generously shared documents and other key information with me, including Moira Birss, Gwen Burnyeat, Leah Carroll, Michael Evans, David Feller, Janice Gallagher, Lisa Haugaard, Adam Isacson, Oliver Kaplan, Sarah Kinosian, Maria Milena Mendez, Jorge Molano, Diana Murcia, Paul Paz y Mino, Peace Brigades International (pbi) Colombia staff, Renata Rendon, Francesc Riera, William Rozo, Christian Salazar, Matt Schroeder, Arlene Tickner, Paola Torres, Gustavo Trejos, Alirio Uribe, Sarah Weintraub, and Paul Wolf. Karen Mejía and Liliana Ávila García helped me with official information requests in Colombia. I have learned much from other fellow thinkers and chroniclers, including Sandra Alvarez, Enrique Daza, Nadja Drost, Jenny Escobar, Chris Kraul, Francisco Leal Buitrago, Alex Sierra, Winifred Tate, Curt Wands, and Michael Weintraub. Tomas Monarrez, Emiliano Huet-­Vaughn, Lucia Chiappara, and Gitanjali Shukla generously helped me understand statistical relationships in ­human rights and assistance data, while Camice Revier, Emily Schmitz, Isabel Moris, Daniel Horgan, Seth Kershner, and Leah Vincent aided in data management. David Figueroa and Jamie Connatser transcribed interviews. I am deeply grateful to both Jesús Abad Colorado and Jutta Meier Wiedenbach for their generous permission to use the power­ful photo­graphs they took in San José de Apartadó. Douglas Mackey very graciously produced the maps used in this book. Thank you to James Groleau for the beautiful artwork on the book cover. I am always thankful to Cristina Espinel and Charlie Roberts for their hospitality over many years. The pbi and for teams and Sara Koopman and Alberto Yepes graciously hosted me in Colombia. xiv Acknowl­e dgments\n\nfor and the American Friends Ser­vice Committee have been supportive homes for research and writing. for’s support for work on Colombia was critical to my learning pro­cess over many years. I am thankful to for staff, especially Jutta Meier Wiedenbach, Susana Pimiento, Liza Smith, Candice Camargo, Pat Clark, and Mark Johnson, and for Colombia team members who served during the period described in this book, including Patricia Abbott, Isaac Beachy, Moira Birss, Kevin Coulombe, Chris Courtheyn, Joe DeRaymond, Mireille Evans, Denise Fraga, Janice Gallagher, Brad Grabs, Marion Hiptmair, Amanda Jack, Paul Kozak, Aimee Krouskop, Marcie Ley, Dan Malakoff, Chris Moore-­Backman, Mayra Moreno, Camila Nieves, Jon Patberg, Lily Ray, Renata Rendon, Nico Udu-­gama, Gilberto Villaseñor, and Sarah Weintraub. Duke University Press has been supportive and tolerant, and I especially thank Gisela Fosado, Lydia Rose Rappoport-­Hankins, Stephanie Gomez Menzies, and Liz Smith. My deep thanks also to the four anonymous readers who commented on the manuscript. I am grateful for funding for research that has contributed to this book, from Open Society Foundations, Appleton Foundation, Fund for Nonviolence, Latin Amer­ic­ a Working Group, and Nonviolent Peaceforce. Global Exchange, Pacifistas sin Fronteras, and the Colectivo de Abogados José Alvear Restrepo provided additional resources for travel to Colombia. I am especially thankful to a number of p ­ eople for their extra encouragement and friendship. I have been extremely fortunate to be accompanied in writing this book by Chris Courtheyn, Peter Cousins, Cristina Espinel, Dana Frank, Charlie Roberts, Janey Skinner, Jenine Spotnitz, and Winifred Tate, who read and commented on part or all of the manuscript. To Dana Frank I owe a special debt for the close reading she gave the manuscript when it was truly needed. Leah Carroll, Jenny Escobar, Patrick S­ ullivan, and David Vine provided key encouragement. Thank you to Lora Lumpe for your questions, editing, and institutional support, and Janice Gallagher for your research and accompaniment. As always, I am profoundly grateful to my ­mother, Helen Lindsay, who showed me how to be an activist, and James Groleau, the love of my life.\n\nAcknowl­e dgments xv\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nMiles\n\nLAS FLORES\n\nSABALETA RODOXALLI\n\nPLAYA LARGA\n\nARENAS LA ALTAS UNION\n\nEL GAS GUINEO ALTO\n\nLAS NIEVES\n\nEL CUCHILLO LA BALSA\n\nApartadó City Center\n\nLA ESPERANZA\n\nMulat o s R i v e r\n\nEL SALTO\n\nEL GUINEO\n\nLA HOZ\n\nARENAS EL BAJAS PORVENIR\n\nBUENOS AIRES MULATOS\n\nSan José Town Center LA VICTORIA LAS PLAYAS\n\nLA RESBALOZA\n\nBELLAVISTA LA LINDA\n\nMULATOS CABECERA LA CRISTALINA\n\nMIRAMAR\n\nLA MIRANDA\n\nAPARTADO COUNTY LA PEDROZA\n\nLA DANTA\n\nSan José de Apartadó. map by douglas mackey.\n\nSan José de Apartadó District\n\nPROLOGUE Force does not work the way its advocates seem to think it does. It does not, for example, reveal to the victim the strength of his adversary. On the contrary, it reveals the weakness, even the panic of his adversary, and this revelation invests the victim with patience. Furthermore, it is ultimately fatal to create too many victims. The victor can do nothing with ­these victims, for they do not belong to him, but—to the victims. —­James Baldwin, No Name in the Street\n\nOn the morning of the day he was murdered, Monday, February 21, 2005, Luis Eduardo Guerra awoke in the h ­ ouse of his stepmother, Miryam ­Tuberquia, in a small settlement of Colombia’s Abibe Mountains, called Mulatos. For the previous three days, in the dense fo­liage and steep trails near the h ­ ouse, intense combat had raged between government forces, paramilitary troops allied with them, and guerrilla fighters. Luis Eduardo had hiked to Mulatos on Saturday after­noon from his home in the town center of San José de Apartadó, together with his son Diener, eleven years old, and his girlfriend, Beyanira Areiza. He visited Miryam ­every month or so, and he planned to harvest cocoa beans on land he had near her h ­ ouse, where he also grew corn and beans, and return to San José the following day. On Sunday, however, the combat nearby was intense, and they stayed in the h ­ ouse in Mulatos out of caution. The military had killed a guerrilla known as Macho Rusio in a nearby settlement. Luis Eduardo did not take lunch with him when he left the h ­ ouse on Monday morning at about 7:00 a.m., telling Miryam that he would be back by 3:00 p.m. He left with Diener, Beyanira, and his half ­brother, Dario, known as El Gurre.1 The Abibe range, located in northwestern Colombia, is composed of very rugged but fabulously fertile, tropical land. Paths connect settlements in the range, over which ­people move on foot, mule, or ­horse­back, often through rocky mud that receives more than one hundred inches of rain\n\nannually. (The area of Miryam’s h ­ ouse was called El Barro, “the mud.”) The district of San José spreads over more than three hundred square kilo­meters on the western side of the range. The rugged terrain and its location have made it a refuge of choice for civilians fleeing po­liti­cal vio­lence, as well as for insurgents and other armed groups—­first Liberals fighting with Conservatives from 1948 to 1956, and beginning in the late 1960s, leftist guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, farc).2 In the 1990s, the army and allied right-­wing paramilitary groups contested the guerrillas’ control, leading to frequent combat in and around peasant settlements and farmland. In response, Luis Eduardo Guerra and other peasants in San José de Apartadó declared themselves a peace community in 1997. They would not support any armed group, would not join them, sell food, give information, or carry arms. It was a strategy for survival—­since armed groups retaliated against civilians who collaborated with their enemies—­and for staying and continuing to work the land. The landscape that Luis Eduardo and his f­ amily traversed that day was intensely beautiful, with richly diverse flora and fauna: hardwood trees (ceiba, Colombian mahogany), many palm species, flowering trees that produced spiny husks with an almond-­like nut, a rich understory with dozens of kinds of orchids, creeping vines, bromeliads, and bright flowers like the birds of paradise that dangled near the path. The Abibe Mountains are also home to many bird species, and residents sometimes find monkeys and ocelots roaming ­there. If not for the war, it would be like a national park.3 But that morning, as Luis Eduardo and the ­others walked through the shallow ­waters of the Mulatos River, soldiers and paramilitaries spied them from upstream, then hid in order to ambush them.4 When they saw the soldiers, El Gurre said they should run, but Luis Eduardo said no, that he had nothing to hide. His son Diener, with a severe leg injury, could not run in any case. El Gurre then fled, and the armed men attacked Luis Eduardo, Beyanira, and Diener with machetes, beheading Diener in the pro­cess. They left their bodies on the side of the river, exposed to the tropical heat and animals. Farther up the mountain, less than an hour’s walk away in a settlement called La Resbalosa, another army-­paramilitary troop exchanged gunfire that day with a guerrilla militia member named Alejandro Pérez, killing him, and fired a mortar at a ­house nearby. The mortar crashed through the kitchen roof and hit Sandra Tuberquia in the head, killing her; the explosion was heard from hills around the area. 2 Prologue\n\nHer husband, Alfonso Bolívar Tuberquia, was hiding nearby with other local men, but ­after he heard the gunfire and explosion, he returned to the ­house. By that time, the armed men already had gotten his two young ­children, Natalia and Santiago, ages six years and eigh­teen months, out from ­under the bed where they had hidden. Santiago was still breast-­feeding.5 Alfonso begged the men not to kill the ­children, to take him instead. But they killed all three of them with machetes and covered them with a mound of cocoa leaves.\n\nTwo days ­later, Renata Rendon, Trish Abbott, and Joe DeRaymond w ­ ere sitting on the back porch of a small wooden ­house in the village of La Unión, about six hours on foot from Mulatos, when they received the startling news. Rendon, then twenty-­six, grew up in New York City, the ­daughter of a Medellín native. Abbott, twenty-­four, was from Newcastle, E ­ ngland, and had arrived in Colombia only the month before, while DeRaymond was considerably older—­fifty-­four—­a taciturn para­legal from the steel mill region of eastern Pennsylvania. They worked for a U.S. peace organ­ization called the Fellowship of Reconciliation (for), which had established a team of two to three volunteers in San José three years before in order to strengthen security for residents of the community. The day before, in the early after­noon of February 22, they heard an army he­li­cop­ter launch three rockets and fire machine guns for twenty minutes. The he­li­cop­ter circled around La Unión, passing in front of a large cross on a hill on the edge of the village, shortly before the combat ended. Then it was calm. Wilson David, a cherubic-­faced community leader who spoke quickly, arrived at the ­house ashen-­faced and shaken, to say that Luis Eduardo Guerra, his ­family, and five ­others had been massacred in a settlement farther up in the mountains. Eight p ­ eople had been killed, including three c­ hildren. Wilson asked the foreigners if they would accompany him and other leaders to the town center, from where a larger group would go up to the massacre site. They said they would. Early Friday, a group of about a hundred from the community, as well as Rendon and Abbott, two international health volunteers, and h ­ uman rights activists departed from the San José town center to hike the steep trails to Resbalosa. ­After they arrived at the farm where a witness had discovered the fresh shallow grave in the settlement of Resbalosa, they watched as investigators Prologue 3\n\ndisinterred the cut-up bodies of Alfonso Tuberquia’s ­family. But the bodies of Luis Eduardo, Beyanira, and Diener w ­ ere not t­ here. “For a moment we thought maybe Luis Eduardo had survived,” another community leader, Gildardo Tuberquia (no relation), said ­later.6 It was then they heard that the other bodies had been found on the banks of the Mulatos River, an hour hike down the mountain. A del­e­ga­tion separated from the group and made its way ­there; this group found the remains of Luis Eduardo, Beyanira, and Diener. The boy’s skull lay apart from the rest. The community group and international accompaniers held vigil by the bodies to keep the vultures from eating them. They waited that night and all the next day, and again the following night, as the international volunteers’ satellite phone battery died and they considered carry­ing away the bodies themselves. But a l­egal investigative unit fi­nally arrived Sunday morning to gather the bodies and other evidence.\n\nBy the time the massacre occurred, more than 115 members of the Peace Community had been killed since it declared itself in 1997, while o ­ thers had been forcibly dis­appeared, bombed, injured, threatened, displaced, tortured, or illegally detained. Paramilitary gunmen who operated with the blessing of the army’s Seventeenth Brigade, or army soldiers themselves, had killed 97 members, while guerrillas of the farc had murdered another 19.7 Why did the armed groups, especially the army-­paramilitary alliance, single out for such relentless and brutal vio­lence a community that openly committed itself to nonviolence and refused support for any armed group? What threat did they represent? Why did they target Luis Eduardo Guerra and Alfonso Bolívar and the ­women and ­children in their families? And why did the military participate so brazenly, not even hiding their uniforms or culpability? The community represented a thorn in the side of adversaries who could not accept nonaffiliation of communities where they operated. The paramilitaries took over Colombia’s northwestern Urabá region by blood and bullet in 1995–98, pushing the or­ga­nized Left and armed guerrillas out of ­labor ­unions, towns, and most of the rural communities where peasants and Afro-­Colombians lived. Even villages that during that period also called themselves peace communities with accompaniment by the Catholic Church subsequently lowered their profiles, accommodated guerrillas or paramilitaries, or displaced to larger towns, where their proj­ects of peace and neutrality dissipated. Except for some Afro-­Colombian and indigenous 4 Prologue\n\ncommunities, the Peace Community of San José de Apartadó proved to be the sole exception to the army-­paramilitary mono­poly of force over the region’s population. Yet ­these responses lead to further questions. What was the role of the United States, both official government policy—­represented most prominently by the multibillion-­dollar military aid program known as Plan Colombia—­ and private U.S. citizens who sought to support the community and other initiatives like it? What might have prevented t­ hese crimes? And what are the implications of the United States’ history in the war in Colombia for its role in the rest of the world? Answering ­these questions requires understanding the context of the armed conflict in Colombia and U.S. involvement in it.\n\nPrologue 5\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nINTRODUCTION challenging american excep tionalism\n\nColombia . . . ​taught us that the ­battle for the narrative is perhaps the most impor­tant fight of all. —­General John F. Kelly, “Colombia’s Resolve Merits Support”\n\nWhat is the ­future of the United States’ military engagement around the world? Washington policy makers have increasingly since the Cold War committed the United States to strengthening the military capacity of allies through assistance and arms sales, made explicit in the 2015 U.S. military strategy, which emphasizes “building partner capacity” and “interoperability.” Military leaders stated in the strategy that success “­will increasingly depend on how well our military instrument can support the other instruments of power and enable our network of allies and partners.”1 The first revision of the strategy issued by President Trump in 2017 continued the emphasis on “a strong commitment and close cooperation with allies and partners ­because allies and partners magnify U.S. power and extend U.S. influence.”2 The model most often cited for such foreign military assistance, proclaimed by a broad spectrum of establishment thinkers, is Colombia. Deploying from above a narrative of the miraculous protégé, U.S. officials point to Colombia as a model to emulate in other conflicts. For the foreseeable ­future, U.S. military cooperation with Colombia from the late 1990s to 2017, especially the series of aid packages known as Plan Colombia, serves as a princi­pal template for U.S. military strategy and reference for success in the rest of the world. Unpacking the context of decisions about U.S. intervention—­and how policy debates that interpret Plan Colombia inform ­those decisions—is thus essential to understanding the criteria and values shaping U.S. military\n\nengagement. It is also crucial to understand the outcomes of U.S. policy in Colombia and the reasons why the lessons learned by most Washington policy makers, on the one hand, and by h ­ uman rights advocates, on the other, are so diametrically opposed to each other. The United States has increased its reliance on training and equipping foreign armed forces, especially since 2001, and is likely to continue ­doing so. “Across the globe,” a 2012 version of U.S. military strategy says, “we ­will seek to be the security partner of choice, pursuing new partnerships with a growing number of nations—­including ­those in Africa and Latin Amer­i­ca . . . ​relying on exercises, rotational presence, and advisory capabilities.”3 This reliance on partners was embodied in U.S. assistance to armed forces and police in at least 152 countries in 2016. From 2010 through 2014, the United States spent more than $96 billion on international military and police assistance, a nearly three-­fold increase from a de­cade before.4 Even so, as Congressional Quarterly reported in 2013, “the military brass and its backers often note [that] it’s far cheaper and generally more effective to train ­others to fight local ­battles than to send in American forces.”5 The massive American troop deployments to Iraq and Af­ghan­i­stan from 2001 to 2009 w ­ ere debacles on several scores, and the lessons from and backlash to ­those failures established a much higher bar for large deployments of U.S. troops overseas. The enormous legacy costs to the federal bud­get of t­ hose wars ­will constrain spending further, deepening the incentives to operate more through client states, which bear more of the costs.\n\nPlan Colombia as Model At the height of U.S. war operations in Iraq and Af­ghan­i­stan, between 2002 and 2008, Colombia had more military and police personnel trained by the United States than ­either country where the U.S. was waging war using its own troops. A massive counterdrug military and economic aid package approved in 2000, known as Plan Colombia, was transformed ­after the September 11, 2001, attacks into an openly counterinsurgent program with high-­ level U.S. commitment to the Colombian military and state. Twenty-­five years ­after President George H. W. Bush declared a war on drugs in Latin Amer­ic­ a in 1989, military monographs and Congressional testimony on Colombia employed phrases like “the Colombian miracle,” “road to recovery,” and “back from the brink.”6 Colombia is “the model for winning the fight against violent insurgencies” and “one place where we got\n\n8 i ntroduction\n\nit right,” claimed the top military commander for the region.7 Such accolades come routinely from Demo­crats and Republicans, military and civilian leaders. Colombia is “one of the g ­ reat stories of Latin Amer­i­ca,” said John Kerry in his 2013 confirmation hearing as secretary of state, or “a model for hope,” according to former Central Intelligence Agency (cia) director David Petraeus.8 U.S. officials also lavished praise on Colombia’s ex-­president Álvaro Uribe Vélez (2002–10) and his ministers, who one Pentagon official told me in 2010 w ­ ere “the right men at the right time—­the ­great man theory in plural.”9 Moreover, the United States now funds Colombian personnel to train military and police forces in Central Amer­ic­ a, Mexico, and other countries not yet certified as “successes.” Colombia has become, in effect, a superclient of the United States, and its use to train other nations’ armed forces is cited as evidence that U.S. training was a success. The practice of using Colombia to train other nations’ militaries was pioneered at the former U.S. Army School of the Amer­i­cas (soa) in Fort Benning, Georgia, where the number of Colombian instructors nearly doubled between 2001 and 2011, despite the risks that Colombian instruction is replicating the flawed ethics embodied in Colombian police and military collaboration with paramilitary death squads or killings of civilians.10 Washington reiterated this discourse when President Juan Manuel Santos—­Uribe’s defense minister in 2006–9—­committed to a negotiated end to the war with the leftist farc guerrillas in 2012. By 2016, when the accords ­were signed, the argument was that U.S. commitment to Colombia’s armed forces had brought peace, to be rewarded by Washington. But even in peacetime, that reward included increased military assistance to expand the military’s presence, purportedly in order to prevent “the vacuum” generated by the farc’s demobilization from being filled by existing criminal organ­ izations.11 The allied state that the United States is rescuing, building, or supporting in its foreign assistance is nearly always military first—­followed closely by the state that promotes commerce and the privatization of its own functions. Plan Colombia came out of a history of U.S. interventions in Colombia and elsewhere and elite premises for t­ hose interventions, as we w ­ ill see. But it also confronted grassroots actors who contested elite premises. This book ­will demonstrate that the U.S. military assistance carried out during Plan Colombia, while serving as a template for ­future interventions, had a mostly negative impact on re­spect for h ­ uman rights and social equality.\n\nchallenging american exceptionalism 9\n\n“Boots on the Ground” versus Client Forces When President Barack Obama’s administration announced the “surge” of U.S. troops in Af­ghan­i­stan in 2009, the projected annual cost for deployment of each U.S. soldier was a million dollars, not including postdeployment costs such as veterans’ medical, disability, and other benefits, equipment replacement, interest on borrowed funds, and opportunity costs.12 The soldiers themselves, of course, ­were not seeing the vast majority of that money. But costs for long-­term health care for veterans of the Iraq and Af­ghan­i­stan conflicts—­itself an area contested between cost-­cutters and veterans in need—­will peak in thirty to forty years ­after deployment, and add another $300,000 or more in current dollars per soldier. ­These costs are greater than in previous conflicts, as more veterans survive with injuries or are diagnosed with disorders resulting from trauma, and health care costs have soared.13 In all, the contract costs to transport t­ hese soldiers, create new bases and facilities, deliver fuel and other supplies, provide “force protection,” and arm them with the full technological panoply of the twenty-­first ­century w ­ ere vastly greater than the costs of training, arming, and paying Afghan soldiers on their own soil.14 It is no won­der, then, that even as Obama sent thirty-­three thousand additional U.S. troops for the “surge” in 2010, the United States was rushing to expand the Afghan army and police, funneling large amounts of funds into training and equipping them. Obama made the po­liti­cal calculation that the surge would last only a limited period; then the additional soldiers would be withdrawn, leaving Afghans to fight Washington’s enemies. That is why Af­ghan­i­stan was during this period the largest recipient of U.S. military and police assistance, by far: from 2010 through 2012, the three years of the surge, it amounted to more than $30 billion, nearly half of all U.S. military and police aid globally for ­those years.15 This cost was, nevertheless, only a fraction of that required for the direct deployment of U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Af­ghan­i­stan, which consistently topped $100 billion annually between 2006 and 2012.16 The emphasis on building up allied militaries continued ­after Obama’s presidency. In 2017 the U.S. Army established six brigades, with five hundred officers and soldiers each, just to train and advise other nations’ militaries, and even set up an acad­emy to train trainers of foreign forces.17 One of Donald Trump’s first military policy moves was to signal to North Atlantic Treaty Organ­ization (nato) countries that they must shoulder more costs of the alliance.18 Such a shift in payment for international military bills 10 i ntroduction\n\nmight replicate the arrangement Washington has with Japan, which pays the United States for the costs of having U.S. military bases on its soil. But it could also lead to reduced U.S. troop levels in Eu­rope and a concurrent reliance on nato troops to deploy to conflicts where Washington expresses an interest, as they did in Af­ghan­i­stan. Compared with U.S. troop deployment, foreign military assistance is frequently financially advantageous for the United States in another way that is not often observed: what begins as grant aid, especially in the form of equipment, gradu­ates to high levels of purchases by the client state of the same equipment from U.S. corporate suppliers. This progression from assistance to sales is consistent with other trades as well: A com­pany gives away a product, the client trains with it and grows accustomed to using it, then needs to replace, repair, or expand it. The client is likely to return to his or her donor to buy additional models. The five-­year periods from 1999 through 2013 for Colombia illustrate the phenomenon (see figure I.1). In the initial years of Plan Colombia and ­those just preceding it, from 1999 through 2003, U.S. military and police aid totaled $2.3 billion, more than four times the amount of military sales for the five-­year period. Aid peaked from 2003 to 2007, a­ fter which it began a steady decline. At the same time, U.S. arms sales to Colombia multiplied, more than quintupling from $326 million in the 1997–1999 period to over $1.7 billion in 2012–2014. The growth in sales was not an accident: U.S. officials repeatedly pressed Colombians to change specifications for aircraft purchases that Lockheed Martin desired to supply and that the United States regarded as “skewed” to Brazil’s Embraer, for example.19 The net result was that the United States supplied even more military equipment to Colombia, through sales, even as grant assistance declined. The same pattern of large military aid packages followed by vastly increased sales was repeated in Mexico and Iraq. While U.S. assistance to Mexican military and police through the Merida Initiative peaked in 2009 at $682 million and declined to $79 million in 2015, arms sales agreements grew to an average of $1 billion dollars annually for 2012 through 2014. In Iraq, ­after authorizing no arms sales in the early part of the war, the United States green-­lighted more than $3.9 billion worth of sales in 2008, and another $17 billion over the following six years.20 The Trump administration gave early indications in 2017 that its arms sales would prioritize wealthy clients such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, while proposing steep cuts in overt assistance to militaries in Africa, Latin Amer­i­ca, and Asia. And despite Trump’s promises challenging american exceptionalism 11\n\n$3,000\n\nAmount (in millions)\n\n$2,500\n\n$2,000\n\nU.S. Arms Sales\n\n$1,500\n\nU.S. Military/Police Aid\n\n$1,000\n\n$500\n\n$0 1997–1999\n\n2000–2002\n\n2003–2005\n\n2006–2008\n\n2009–2011\n\n2012–2014\n\nFig. I.1.

If the leaders of respective nations share a worldview and objectives, and U.S. planners trust them—­though such trust and congruity is often partial and fragile—­the U.S. partners can be counted on to carry out the objectives for which assistance is intended. Other­wise, imperial policy makers are more likely to turn to direct U.S. troop deployments, e­ ither on bases and naval ships or in warfare itself.\n\nPo­liti­cal Costs of Intervention The antipathy to deploying large numbers of U.S. soldiers in armed conflicts in other countries is not only a preoccupation of the Pentagon or t­ hose seeking to balance the federal bud­get. The ­human and po­liti­cal costs of harm 12 i ntroduction\n\nand death for U.S. personnel also make the commitment of large numbers of U.S. boots on the ground much more difficult for po­liti­cal leaders. Such deployments typically last several years, and public opinion turned against ­every U.S. war since the Korean War as they dragged on.22 This opposition from both above and below to massive U.S. involvement in overseas wars has broad implications for the activities of U.S. empire. In addition, U.S. troops that intervene directly in Muslim countries are likely to be perceived as occupiers and to generate religious and nationalist backlash that strengthens their opponents. A University of Chicago study found that 95 ­percent of all suicide attacks globally between 1980 and 2010 ­were in response to foreign occupation.23 The drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq that began in 2009 was largely the outcome of broad Iraqi antipathy to the large U.S. military presence.24 Frequently, military action that falls short of large-­scale U.S. troop deployments also provokes opposition. When President Obama floated the prospect of a Congressional authorization for U.S. war in Syria in 2013, in response to chemical attacks that killed hundreds of civilians ­there, overwhelming popu­lar opposition across a broad po­liti­cal spectrum forced Obama and Congress to drop the plan. A central reason for opposition was the belief that bombing strikes could lead to a long-­term commitment in Syria—­ especially when Secretary of State John Kerry refused to rule out the commitment of U.S. troops and expensive deployments.25 Obama asked the public and Congress to weigh in on a direct military attack, but the public is rarely asked about foreign military assistance. A ­ fter the administration backed off from direct military intervention in Syria, it undertook assistance to Syrian rebels without seeking a public response. When the public is consulted about training and equipping other nations’ militaries, the results are mixed and vary depending on the country receiving aid, news events at the time of polling, and the framing of the question.26 As early as 1989, when President George H. W. Bush launched a highly vis­i­ble drug war push in Latin Amer­ic­ a, substantially more U.S. residents who w ­ ere polled favored giving military aid and sending advisors for Colombians to fight drug traffickers than favored sending U.S. troops. This framed the low level of U.S. troops deployed in Colombia, which was capped at eight hundred from 2004 onward.27 A reckless leader operating without substantial restraints may still undertake major interventions involving ground troops, but the costs—­economic, po­liti­cal, diplomatic, and moral—­will be prohibitive in an increasing number of cases. Indeed, the report that Trump had, in his first week in office, challenging american exceptionalism 13\n\ncasually threatened (or offered) Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto with sending U.S. troops to go a­ fter “bad hombres” generated widespread opposition, especially in Mexico.28\n\nShifting Rationales for Engagement Supporters of military assistance normally envision its goals as strengthening order, stability, and demo­cratic state authority against illegal, disorderly, violent actors. ­These goals may be articulated as reduction of overall ­vio­lence, prevailing over a destabilizing ­enemy, stemming ­human rights violations by state forces, or a combination of t­ hese aims. A second set of stated goals includes policing the production of narcotics and the movement of both drugs and ­people, especially across borders. A third set of goals for military engagement is economic in nature. ­These goals, less often stated openly, include establishing conditions for investment, extraction of resources, and trade. Plan Colombia encompassed all ­these goals in varying mea­sures, but the emphasis that U.S. officials placed on each goal changed over time. In the late 1990s, in the countryside where multiple armed and unarmed actors disputed territory for most of the twentieth c­ entury, Washington and Bogotá collaborated on the war, an escalation of military intervention that sought to prevail over the insurgency. In addition to counterinsurgency goals and a radical reduction in cocaine production, Plan Colombia also explic­itly aimed to strengthen re­spect for h ­ uman rights in Colombia through training and other aid for the military, police, prosecutors, judicial investigators, the United Nations High Commissioner for ­Human Rights, and the protection of witnesses and h ­ uman rights groups.29 Plan Colombia ­will focus especially on evaluating outcomes for this policy goal. ­After 2010 the drug war, which was the principal driver for the initial U.S. commitment to Plan Colombia, was no longer the main mission by which the plan’s success was mea­sured in official circles, since the drug war was also widely discredited, with even the Colombian president calling it a “stationary bike.”30 “The basic premise of our war against drugs has proved to have serious shortcomings,” former Guatemalan president Otto Pérez Molina told the United Nations (un) in 2012.31 As more U.S. states legalized marijuana for medical and recreational uses, a trend with national and even international momentum, the logic and coherence of global prohibition became increasingly broken. As a result, the ­human costs for enforcing it on the supply side in Latin Amer­i­ca ­were progressively less acceptable to Latin 14 i ntroduction\n\nAmerican governments, including very militarized ones, leading to a reform-­ oriented un General Assembly Special Session on Drugs in April 2016. Even some U.S. military analysts involved in nominally U.S. counternarcotics programs in Latin Amer­i­ca have expressed reservations about the drug mission. A rand analyst noted, “In Colombia, strategic cooperation and large amounts of U.S. aid failed to stem the production of narcotics.”32 An other­wise glowing evaluation by the conservative Center for Strategic and International Studies recognized by 2007 that “the original eradication goal established in Plan Colombia has not been met.”33 The centerpiece of Plan Colombia’s counterdrug operations was aerial fumigation—­defoliation, essentially, of coca crops, which had begun in the mid-1990s. (The coca leaf is an essential ingredient in the production of cocaine, and grows only in the Andean region.) In ­these operations, pi­lots of DynCorp contracted by the U.S. State Department sprayed glyphosate, produced by Monsanto Corporation, paired with U.S.-­trained Colombian counterinsurgency troops in U.S.-­produced Blackhawk he­li­cop­ters. Peasant communities and environmentalists from the beginning asserted that the fumigation was generating health, environmental, and agricultural damage. The World Health Organ­ization eventually ratified the claim that glyphosate is “prob­ably carcinogenic to h ­ umans” in a study published in 2015.34 The Colombian government suspended aerial spraying of the defoliant shortly thereafter. Coca growers adapted to fumigation by moving to new areas of Colombia and other countries, by planting coca in smaller plots that ­were harder for pi­lots to detect, and by techniques such as washing leaves, rotating plots, and isolating leaves from the effect of glyphosate.35 As a result, ­after an initial decline in coca production, aerial fumigation failed, and by 2007 C ­ olombia produced nearly as much coca as when Plan Colombia kicked in. But as the Colombian state won control over more territory, it was able to deploy manual eradicators who cut down plants on the ground, a method that had greater success in ­destroying coca fields. Nevertheless, by 2014, while reduced from peak levels of 2001, by all mea­sure­ments Colombia was still growing a lot more coca leaf than it was in the mid-1990s, when U.S. fumigation operations began.36 Instead of counternarcotics results, military aid supporters cite other metrics: reduced numbers of massacres and kidnappings, demobilized paramilitaries, economic growth, and weakened guerrilla forces. In effect, if the state is able to weaken armed opposition enough to claim a mono­poly on the use of vio­lence, military proponents assert, this is a victory for legitimacy and for the strategy used in Colombia. challenging american exceptionalism 15\n\nDeconstructing the Stated Goals for Assistance The increased U.S. support for the Colombian Army in 1999–2002 occurred at precisely the time when paramilitary forces committed the largest number of atrocities of any actor or any period of the war. T ­ hese forces ­were or­ga­nized in the Self-­Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, auc), which had grown out of earlier generations of private armed groups in the 1950s and 1960s that the armed forces used against Liberal Party, peasant, and insurgent groups. The paramilitaries ­were allied with regional po­liti­cal elites and broad sectors of the army, prompting ­Human Rights Watch in 2001 to call the auc an additional division of the army.37 Paramilitaries ­were responsible for nearly three of ­every four po­liti­cal killings for which an author was identified in 1998.38 Paramilitary as well as guerrilla and army vio­lence led to the displacement of between 200,000 and 400,000 Colombians ­every year from 1997 through 2011.39 The proponents of U.S. assistance to the armed forces in Colombia thus supported state actors that ­were allied with disorderly, violent paramilitary organ­izations acting illegally. Since U.S. aid to “security” forces benefited groups that sowed disorder in Colombia, what other criterion explained or rationalized military support? Washington’s economic agenda was central: economic development can take place only ­after security is established by the state, the thinking went. “If you ­don’t have security, you d ­ on’t have anything,” one U.S. military advisor told me in 2010. This premise has dominated U.S. aid policy since the late 1950s, when U.S. military assistance in the hemi­sphere began its long, steady growth. “Without internal security, and the general feeling of confidence engendered by adequate military forces, t­ here is l­ittle hope for any economic pro­gress,” concluded a commission appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.40 Indeed, six years into Plan Colombia, Washington and Bogotá signed a trade agreement that would ratify a neoliberal model of economic development. Many scholars concur in this economic analy­sis and assert that the conflict in Colombia is fundamentally about control of the country’s rich natu­ ral resources, and therefore territorial in nature.41 Colombia is a large and biologically diverse country, with tropical lowlands both coastal and inland, lush valleys, snowy peaks, flat savannah, and desert regions. Its subsurface holds extensive coal, oil, gold, and emeralds, while above ground it has rich agricultural land and extensive w ­ ater resources. According to critics’ analy­ sis, that is why nonviolent and unarmed communities in areas of exploit16 i ntroduction\n\nable resources are targeted for vio­lence: some are actively organ­izing for community control, and ­whether or not they resist, communities’ displacement by terror benefits ­those with economic interests in the lands of ­those who flee.42 Plan Colombia proponents’ claims that it fulfilled ­human rights goals strained credulity. From 2004 through 2008, in the wake of the peak of U.S. assistance to the Colombian military, the army committed widespread killings of unarmed persons, known as “false positives.” In ­these crimes, army units announced combat killings that ­were actually executions of civilians, carried out in order to claim larger numbers of “positive” kills, which ­were the military’s primary mea­sure of battlefield success. Though the murders initially received ­little attention, Colombian prosecutors and h ­ uman rights groups have documented more than 5,700 alleged executions by Colombian armed forces between 2000 and 2010.43 In the San José massacre of 2005 recounted in this book, the military could not claim that the child victims ­were killed in combat, so its leaders used a dif­fer­ent technique: they attributed the murders to guerrillas, although this narrative collapsed in 2007, when an army captain confessed his participation in the killings. The massacre was one of several cases that eroded the Colombian military’s claims to legitimacy, ultimately impacting U.S. assistance. Supporters of U.S. military involvement claim that the “false positive” killings ­were an anomaly in an other­wise progressive arc ­toward greater re­spect by the Colombian military for h ­ uman rights. From this perspective, the Colombian military in the 1970s and 1980s was both brutal and in­effec­ tive (­these two being related to each other), leading it to become known internationally for its poor ­human rights rec­ord. In the 1990s, the military began adopting h ­ uman rights training and standards and then, with accelerated training, support, and disincentives from the United States,44 substantially improved its ­human rights rec­ord over the following de­cade, reducing both ties to paramilitaries and the direct commission of serious abuses. Indeed, this argument continues, the number of reported army killings of civilians from 2008 to 2015 was just a fraction of ­those reported from 2002 to 2008 and an even smaller fraction of ­those committed in the 1990s by paramilitaries allied with the army. Supporters of the de­cade of escalated U.S. involvement insist that the reduced army vio­lence against civilians was the result of its greater commitment to ­human rights. “­Every place that ­we’ve given aid and sustained aid, h ­ uman rights abuses have gone down. And that’s a fact. El Salvador and Colombia are pretty good cases,” said a man challenging american exceptionalism 17\n\nwho worked as a U.S. military trainer in Colombia and Pentagon coordinator of Colombia policy.45 An unstated but implicit assumption in this narrative is that U.S. h ­ uman rights doctrine also improved ­after the Cold War and Vietnam War. Most serious military observers recognize that U.S. bombing and the ground war in Southeast Asia led to many thousands of civilians killed. Many also accept that the doctrine taught to Latin American officers at the soa during the 1970s and 1980s did not distinguish between civilian activists and armed insurgents. Since most Colombian Army leaders in the 1980s ­were trained in U.S. doctrine at the soa and other U.S. military schools, it would be hard to argue that U.S. influence on Colombian h ­ uman rights practices only came into play in the twenty-­first ­century. Instead, the premise appears to be that the U.S. post–­Cold War embrace of ­human rights laws and training, as well as technology designed to minimize civilian casualties, ­were reflected in its influence on Colombia. In other words, the idea is that the nature of U.S. influence changed and incorporated greater re­spect for h ­ uman rights than was reflected in the Cold War doctrines promoted in the hemi­sphere. American exceptionalism—­the belief that the United States has a uniquely positive influence in the world—­implies that U.S. military doctrine is the most professional and respectful of ­human rights in the world, which can only be a good t­ hing for ­human rights in nations whose militaries it assists. Such an i­magined standard is often referenced indirectly: “not even the United States has such a standard.” As one Pentagon official said in 2004: “American Army personnel d ­ on’t need to go into the same depth of h ­ uman rights and democracy training [as Latin Americans] b ­ ecause US personnel have a pre-­existing cultural understanding of this before they get anywhere near training.”46 Conversations with both Colombian and U.S. military officers, however, suggest that it was not U.S. material assistance or training that had the most impact, even though he­li­cop­ters facilitated the Colombian military’s mobility. Instead, it was Washington’s high-­level and sustained po­liti­cal and moral support, confirmed by the substantial aid packages, when Colombia was increasingly isolated on h ­ uman rights issues. Colombian leaders experienced this support as a vote of confidence in their war against insurgents. General Mario Montoya, who was army commander from 2006 to 2008, told me that the most impor­tant support from the United States was moral and po­liti­cal: “They have been our number 1 ally. The United States is the only country that has supported us openly. They have been our unconditional allies.”47 18 i ntroduction\n\nEqually impor­tant to evaluating ­human rights claims is an analy­sis of the c­ auses for decreases in state violations. H ­ uman rights conditions on U.S. assistance and other U.S. actions may have played a part in the decline in “false positive” killings, but the United States acted a­ fter other actors, both Colombian and international, documented and denounced the pattern of killings. When the United States did speak, its message was mixed with continued military support. A closer reading of events strongly suggests that other actors played a more impor­tant role than the U.S. government in the initial steep decline in killings. First, many ­family members of ­those killed deci­ded to publicly denounce the killing of their ­children, husbands, and other ­family members. Beyond the fact of killing, many times it was the lie that the military told about their loved ones—­that they had been guerrillas—­that especially made families indignant, similar to the fury generated by lies and disrespect for the dead in cases of police killings of black men in the United States and the forty-­three students from Ayotzinapa, Mexico, killed in September 2014.48 Army participants in civilian killings in Colombia testified that the practice ­there targeted individuals who ­were marginalized, and whom the army believed no one would miss.49 In this re­spect, the military miscalculated the po­liti­cal cost of ­these killings. Moreover, ­there ­were strategic military reasons to reduce the number of civilian killings. In late 2008, when the military cut off the widespread practice of “false positives,” the guerrillas operated at a substantially reduced level, compared to 2002–6, when the practice was growing. The government had established a permanent police presence in nearly e­ very county, and the farc launched the smallest number of combat actions in the previous twelve years.50 By 2012, when the decline in army killings could be seen as sustained over time, the farc was at the negotiating ­table and corporate gold and coal mining of Colombian territories was in the ascendant. In that context, the reduced state violations may be more a consequence of mostly undisputed state territorial control than of ­either supposed changes in the military’s orga­nizational culture or influence by the United States.\n\nDebating the Effects of U.S. Assistance So what impact has the United States—­its government and p ­ eople—­had on state vio­lence against civilians in Colombia, and what impact could it have? Does U.S. military involvement increase or worsen such vio­lence, or have no effect at all? What did the United States have to do with the massacre that challenging american exceptionalism 19\n\noccurred in San José de Apartadó? Can and did the responses of nongovernmental citizens from a superpower positively affect such a community confronting po­liti­cal vio­lence? How would we know the answers to ­these questions? What assumptions guide our responses? Addressing t­ hese questions requires inquiring deeply into the history of the relationship of the United States with Colombia, which is one of the main goals of this book. The debates on ­these issues are frequently infused with a kind of magical thinking. Neither elites nor opponents pres­ent systemic empirical evidence for their claims about the effects of military aid. Proponents often cite inputs (the number of soldiers trained, the amount of money provided) or the ascendance of protégés as their metrics of success, while discarding evidence of wrongdoing as aberrations, a “bad apple” or two.51 Very few ­people or agencies have collected relevant data on the operational outcomes of U.S. military and police assistance—­either positive or negative. Even fewer have sought to credibly examine the impacts of this aid on armed forces’ re­spect for the basic h ­ uman rights of the local population. As a consequence, both critics and supporters of the U.S. role generally rely on anecdotal data. Many observers conflate correlation of U.S. assistance and positive or negative changes in ­human rights violations with causality. Critics of security assistance start from an assumption of skepticism. “Instead of helping secure just demo­cratic institutions, U.S. aid left countries with a legacy of repression and vio­lence,” one critic concluded.52 Bolivian president Evo Morales said that U.S. military schools w ­ ere training militaries to “destabilize demo­cratic governments and defend imperialist and cap­ i­tal­ist interests.”53 The very vocabulary of the debate has embedded bias. The Pentagon refers to military aid as “building partner capacity,” an ­adept use of three words with positive connotations. The even more common phrase “security assistance” strongly implies that the assistance w ­ ill increase the security of ­people in the country whose armed forces receive assistance, but this is obviously not always the case. Instead, where pos­si­ble, I use the descriptive phrases “military assistance” or “police assistance.”\n\nAbove and Below Above and below are types of vantage points from which ­people experience and understand the conflict in Colombia and U.S. policy, and they are also ­attitudes and approaches to conflict and policy. Some ­people move between ­these perspectives and attitudes, literally through travel, and over time 20 i ntroduction\n\nthrough changes in their approach and ideas. ­Others stay firmly within their chosen or given vantage points. The he­li­cop­ters that represented the largest U.S. investment in drug war and counterinsurgent strategy in Colombia, and ­were used to give tours for visiting U.S. officials, operated always from above, as did the satellites that guided bombs to guerrilla camps. ­Those who are “above” have impor­tant knowledge, which may be cold, detached from its consequences on the ground; so too do t­hose who are “below,” whose visceral experience may contribute to deep understanding, limit cognitive capacity through trauma, or both. Perspectives from below are typically tangible, par­tic­ul­ar, vivid; they are concerned with immediate threats, with individuals and parcels of land, and with the practice of policy. Perspectives from above are more abstract and macro, and use words like “democracy” and “judicial reform”; acronyms for bureaucratic agencies, funding streams, or organ­izations; and in the academic world, words such as “problematize” and “sites.” Such abstraction is a source and frequently an indicator of power—­ institutional power over ­others, but also the intellectual power to extra­ polate, to move between situations, to generalize. Generalization can be an analytical weakness as well, which is why the material particulars of perspectives from below are so valuable, even to ­those looking from above. For ­those on the ground, ­there is also a temptation to generalize from a lived situation that may be much less than universal or even characteristic. Nevertheless, we can never understand the ­human dynamics of a conflict or a policy ­unless we witness how it is lived by p ­ eople—­and this living is specific and personal as much as it is linked to larger social, po­liti­cal, and economic forces and pro­cesses. It has names, places, and history, emotions and uncertainties, commitments and responsibilities. That is why in this book I discuss my own experiences with policy makers, military officers, and communities that have experienced po­liti­cal vio­lence: in such direct encounters we can begin to understand how power, which is personal as well as structural, is exercised in practice. What is a model for most of Washington has been a humanitarian and policy disaster for many communities and U.S. critics who experience Colombia from outside ­these dominant assumptions, especially ­those who live and work below the policy rhe­toric, in conflict zones. Many are also critical of guerrilla practices in ­these regions. They point to army-­paramilitary collaboration, civilian killings made to look like combat operations, more than five million Colombians forcibly displaced from their homes, failed counterdrug fumigation that damaged ­legal crops and ­human health, and trade challenging american exceptionalism 21\n\nagreements with the United States, Canada, and Eu­rope that f­avor multinational corporate interests over economic sustainability by the majority, especially rural producers. The responses to vio­lence in Colombia from below, of grassroots ­activists, churches, and ­unions in the United States and Colombia, ­were built on a narrative that was dif­f er­ent from ­those constructed from above, and led to many actions of solidarity in war zones and per­sis­tent advocacy in the United States throughout the early twenty-­first ­century. In the boldest of t­ hese, international observers physically accompanied Colombian ­human rights defenders, communities, and organ­izations threatened with po­liti­cal vio­lence, as a mea­sure to strengthen their security and the prospects for continuing their work inside the country. Some groups or­ga­nized dozens of del­e­ga­tions to regions in Colombia impacted by the war and the U.S. military role in it. ­These groups often focused on Colombian communities and organ­izations whose vision and work opposed the dominant paradigm of war, corporate control, and patriarchy. ­Because of that opposition, the Colombian state harbored a special hatred for some of t­hese communities and organ­izations. Crimes committed against prominent Colombian communities, like the Peace Community of San José de Apartadó, invoked especially strong activism for justice but also encountered per­sis­tent re­sis­tance to criminal prosecution by forces with influence over the Colombian state. For policy makers in Washington, it was typically easier to express support for justice in cases of specific ­human rights abuses than to reexamine the overall policy. Sometimes, however, activists w ­ ere able to leverage this support to chip away at policy approaches that focused U.S. commitments on the Colombian military. Advocacy organ­izations in Washington working with Colombian ­human rights groups developed a strong voice against the overwhelmingly militarized policy. As Latin Americans elected more leftist governments in the first de­cade of the twenty-­first ­century, the counternarrative had power­ful allies that isolated Colombia in the region and ­were decisive in turning back an agreement to host U.S. troops on military bases in Colombia over the long term.\n\nThis Book’s Method In ­these pages, I w ­ ill explore the dynamics of U.S. military assistance in ­Colombia: its aims, history, and changes; its financial beneficiaries and material implementations; its geography and the conflicts in Colombia into which it was inserted; the military units and leaders who received U.S. aid; and 22 i ntroduction\n\ntheir ­human rights rec­ords and attitudes. I mea­sure h ­ uman rights outcomes primarily by extrajudicial executions, which are more reliably documented than other gross rights violations; the Colombian Army allegedly committed over 5,700 such executions between 2000 and 2010. I w ­ ill examine what U.S. citizens and nongovernmental groups did in relation to the conflict in Colombia; their acts of solidarity, advocacy, and accompaniment; and the impacts of t­hese actions. I w ­ ill also explore in detail the lived example of one community’s ­trials: the Peace Community of San José de Apartadó. The book proceeds chronologically, alternating between the micro-­dynamics of events in San José and the macro-­dynamics of the U.S.-­Colombian military relationship. Like most t­ hings, the war in San José and the U.S. relationship to the war in Colombia as a w ­ hole become more complex as you get more intimate with them, if no less tragic and compelling. My method is driven by experience, qualitative research, and quantitative data. I spoke with victims of h ­ uman rights violations, military officers, h ­ uman rights workers, legislators, and journalists. Working to change U.S. policy has not required me to suspend my curiosity in order to pursue an objective. On the contrary, I want to understand policy better, and the experience of activism offers insights through encounters with ­people who design, execute, report on, and are impacted by policy. I have sought out ways to meaningfully mea­sure U.S. involvement and re­spect for ­human rights in Colombia, and to compare and map ­these between dif­fer­ent times and places. Conversations informed my research on data, and findings from quantitative research helped me formulate questions in interviews. I come to this topic as a U.S. citizen, a descendant of Mayflower passengers and of a naval captain who led the first U.S. foreign military intervention, authorized by the Continental Congress, in 1775. And I live and work in the tradition of generations of U.S. citizens who have opposed U.S. military intervention, especially in the Amer­i­cas. In the 1980s, I was immersed in the mass protest movement for ­human rights and against the Ronald Reagan administration’s interventions in Central Amer­i­ca. In 1986 and 1988 I participated in international unarmed teams that accompanied relatives of the dis­appeared and other activists threatened with po­liti­cal vio­lence in Guatemala and El Salvador, as a way to strengthen their security.54 In the 1990s, I worked on campaigns to close U.S. military bases in Panama and Vieques, Puerto Rico. ­These experiences taught me some impor­tant lessons. I learned from reading, through testimonies of Central Americans and Puerto Ricans, and in interviews with active and former U.S. officials themselves about the challenging american exceptionalism 23\n\ndestructive role the United States has often played in Latin Amer­ic­ a. I joined ­others to witness the environmental and health legacies of bombs dropped by the U.S. Navy on the populated island of Vieques. I documented U.S. military experiments with mustard gas in Panama to determine w ­ hether Puerto Rican and white soldiers would respond differently. I met and read the work of Jesuit priests who ­were murdered by Salvadoran troops recently trained by the United States, and interviewed U.S. military officers who ­were haunted by what they had done in Latin Amer­i­ca. I spoke with U.S. engineers of Gatling guns used in the war in El Salvador, and with activists getting in the way of the guns’ production in Vermont. Many U.S. officials and arms producers believed they ­were ­doing positive ­things that benefited Latin Americans, but the outcomes, as mea­sured in vio­lence or social indicators, ­were at best ambiguous. More often they w ­ ere setbacks, and often devastating to populations in the region—­a lesson about how t­hose of us raised to believe we are good can self-­deceive, and about how good intentions are not enough, including for activists who oppose intervention. I learned about the complicated and per­sis­tent resistance—­both unarmed and armed—of Latin Americans to U.S. intervention. Such re­sis­tance normally focused on local economic and po­liti­cal elites and their military or police enforcers, perceived to be in close alliance with—or at the bidding of—­U.S. institutions and capital. B ­ ecause p ­ eople governing both the United States and countries in the region never valued Latin American lives as much as U.S. lives (or often, even, U.S. property), this re­sis­tance was carried out at ­great risk. Most media attention focused on armed re­sis­tance, on guerrilla movements from ­those of Emiliano Zapata in Mexico and Agosto César Sandino in Nicaragua in the early twentieth ­century to t­ hose of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s throughout Latin Amer­i­ca inspired by Cuba’s revolutionary success, liberation theology, and global anticolonial movements. But the many nonviolent movements, campaigns, and actions in Latin Amer­ic­ a for ­human rights and an end to war w ­ ere arguably at least as pervasive and impor­tant for change as armed insurgents.55 It was ­these movements whose ­people I met while traveling and working in the region. I also learned that grassroots movements inside and outside the United States (and especially in combination) can have a substantial impact on limiting or stopping U.S. military intervention. International h ­ uman rights advocacy led the dictatorships in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil to end several policies of abuse or release po­liti­cal prisoners in the 1970s.56 While Central Amer­i­ca experienced massive suffering from the wars supported by the United States in the 1980s, the Central Amer­i­ca movement in the United 24 i ntroduction\n\nStates made a direct U.S. invasion of Nicaragua (of the kinds in Grenada, Panama, or Iraq) impossible, and limited the resources of the United States in El Salvador. Grassroots movements had even more success in movements to close U.S. military bases: in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1980s; in Kaho‘olawe, Hawai‘i, where the navy operated a bombing range; in Panama, despite an attempt to negotiate continued U.S. bases a­ fter 1999; in Vieques, where nonviolent civil disobedience combined with ­legal protest, media work, and legislative advocacy to stop naval bombing; and eventually in Manta, Ec­ua­dor, site of a U.S. military fa­cil­i­t y that was moved from Panama when bases ­there closed. Fi­nally, I learned that I have a passion for detailed and deep research about U.S. intervention. I found that such research can be useful to activists, to Latin American officials, and to U.S. policy makers, in work to make the U.S. military less expansive and more accountable for the effects of its activities. Thus, when it came to working for ­human rights and affecting U.S. policy in Colombia, I brought both some insight into how bad war is for p ­ eople and a sense of agency, that collective and sustained commitment to making t­ hings better could do something meaningful. Colombia is a large country, whose history of internal conflict and of military alliance with the United States is long, and its war is endlessly complex. As one friend involved in ­human rights work in Guatemala said to me before joining a ­human rights proj­ect in Colombia, “I’m afraid I’ll fall in love with another country.” That could mean a long commitment. Still, I was ready to enter the stream of U.S. relations with Colombia when I visited the Urabá region in northwestern Colombia in 2000. I knew that as a U.S. citizen, I already had a relationship with Colombia; I just needed to be more aware and informed about it. Any attempt to understand that relationship requires knowing more of the history of the country, the Urabá region, and how the United States has impacted them. We turn now to that history and region.\n\nchallenging american exceptionalism 25\n\nCHAPTER 1 THE LONGEST WAR u.s. military influence in col ombia , 1952–1995\n\nThe U.S.-­Colombian military relationship is deep-­rooted, beginning in the early 1940s with agreements for the presence of U.S. military missions in Bogotá, and continuing to deepen throughout the Cold War, the war against the Medellín drug cartel in the 1990s, and the counterinsurgency surge represented in Plan Colombia from 2000 to 2016. Each chapter of U.S. military involvement produced consequences that s­ haped and facilitated subsequent interventions. The United States initiated its military interventions in Colombia in the 1850s, in support of the U.S. o ­ wners and users of the Panama Railroad, located in what was then still part of Colombia. ­After the United States “took Panama” from Colombia, in the words of Theodore Roo­se­velt, in 1903, relations with Washington w ­ ere cool, though improved a­ fter the U.S. formally compensated Colombia for Panama in 1914. From the Thousand Days’ War of 1899–1902 ­until World War II, Colombia’s army had been historically allied with the conservative, land-­owning class and trained by German officers, with a Prus­sian military doctrine for conventional warfare. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, the Colombian Army’s doctrine—­like that of other Latin American militaries—­focused principally on fighting external enemies through hemispheric defense, enshrined in the Rio Pact of Reciprocal Assistance in 1947. In the late 1940s, on the advice of the U.S. Army mission, Colombia reor­ga­nized its military command structure on the U.S. model, with sections for personnel, intel-\n\nligence, operations and training, and ser­vices and support.1 U.S. influence was consolidated during the Korean War, when a battalion of Colombian Army troops fought alongside U.S. soldiers in K ­ orea; Colombia was the only Latin American country to do so. The Colombia Battalion fought in K ­ orea from May 1951 to July 1953, and Colombia also sent a naval frigate that was refitted in the United States before steaming to ­Korea.2 ­After it returned home, the Colombia Battalion, using methods learned in ­Korea, was deployed in La Violencia, the decade-­long, cataclysmic po­liti­ cal vio­lence from the mid-1940s to the late 1950s, in which some 200,000 ­people died in fratricidal vio­lence between Liberal and Conservative Party members. Both sides committed atrocities, but the vio­lence of armed Conservatives, known as pájaros (birds), prefigured the limitless vio­lence of paramilitaries four de­cades ­later. Between 1953 and 1956, while Colombia was ­under military rule, Washington rewarded Colombia for its Korean ser­vice with weapons and military aircraft that the army used against Liberal guerrillas, despite a prohibition on internal use of the weapons. The Pentagon ensured that ­there was no protest against the misuse.3 The K ­ orea experience established a pre­ce­dent for participation in a number of multinational missions by the Colombian military, first on the Sinai Peninsula, l­ ater in Yugo­slavia and Haiti, and subsequently as trainers and advisors in dozens of countries from Central Amer­i­ca to the Arab world. At least as impor­tant, it cemented relationships between Colombian and U.S. officers. ­After the Korean armistice in 1953, the Colombian military assumed control of the government at home, largely ­under the rule of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. Rojas seized power through a coup in June 1953, shortly a­ fter a stint in the United States and amid increased interparty vio­lence and governmental crisis.4 The exclusion of civilians from the government was “an extraordinary opportunity for closer bilateral military relations,” according to a U.S. Southern Command historian, and Rojas requested and received more U.S. military advisors.5 U.S.-­Colombian military relations flourished during Rojas’s term. In 1955 Colombia established a training center for counterinsurgency operations by elite troops on the model of U.S. Army Rangers, part of the sprawling Tolemaida base established in response to a U.S. Army col­o­nel’s recommendation. Four Colombian officers who themselves had been sent to be trained in Fort Benning, Georgia, ran the training at Tolemaida, with a U.S. captain serving as a special advisor. ­These Colombian special forces ­were increasingly used in the internal conflict in Colombia.6 A military junta threw out Rojas in 1957, before convening elections the following year. The Longest War 27\n\nDuring the same period, the Colombian military began to acquire and use more U.S. equipment. From 1949 to 1959 U.S. military assistance to Colombia totaled $40.7 million.7 In 1950 the Colombian Army adapted its small arms and munitions to calibers used by the United States. As Colombia developed its own government-­run military production industry, it did so according to specifications required for U.S. equipment.8 The use of the U.S. Army mission as a platform for arms sales to Colombia would repeat itself in the early twenty-­first ­century. La Violencia was settled in a pact in 1958, called the National Front, which alternated the presidency and divided state and local governments between the two parties but excluded large segments of peasant, indigenous, and Afro-­Colombian ­people, leading ultimately to insurgency. Colombia’s civilian leaders also struck an explicit deal with the military in 1960: the military would not interfere with civilian governance, and the civilian state would allow the military f­ ree rein in public security. B ­ ecause ­there have not been formal military coups in Colombia since the 1950s, it is easy to forget that the agreement to grant the military autonomy occurred while the military dictatorship of 1953–57 was still fresh in the minds of civilian leaders. “Its bipartisan de-­politicization allowed the military to acquire relative po­liti­cal autonomy, which was reflected in its in­de­pen­dence in the management of public order and the acquisition of institutional prerogatives,” writes sociologist Francisco Leal Buitrago. “The civilian directives for military policy ­were supposed to be revised and updated, as circumstances changed. But that ­didn’t happen.” Civilian governments did not involve themselves in military policy again ­until the 1990s.9 The military had long been separate from civilian life. “In Colombia t­ here has been a very pronounced divorce between civilians and the military since the Spanish colony,” according to historian Armando Barrero.10 The effect of this, especially as the internal armed conflict emerged and developed, was to deepen the isolation from the rest of society of an army that—­more than in most other countries—­developed its own culture, rules, ethos, and expectations. Once the insurgency began, the army would be on its own in war against the guerrillas. The decision by Colombian civilian leaders to stay out of military affairs coincided with the increased involvement of the U.S. military in Colombia. In the wake of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the United States shifted its military focus for Latin Amer­i­ca from continental defense to suppressing internal subversion, in the form of National Security doctrine. This doctrine rationalized domestic repression in defense not only of the state and its representatives but 28 Chapter 1\n\nof cap­i­tal­ist economic activities, perceived as ­under threat from organ­izing for economic and po­liti­cal reforms as well as revolutionary change. Colombia ­adopted the doctrine despite the absence of an insurgency at the time. In June 1959 President Alberto Lleras Camargo met with U.S. military chiefs in Colombia to request their aid in forming a counterguerrilla force in the Colombian Army.11 That October, a cia-­led team traveled to Colombia to evaluate security and the prospects for U.S. assistance. The team included a cia operative who had just been in Guatemala to train Cuban exiles for what became the Bay of Pigs invasion; all but one member of the team had never been to Colombia before.12 They recommended expanding Colombia’s military intelligence and psychological warfare capacity, implemented through courses in Colombia and Panama by both U.S. instructors and nonU.S. nationals to covertly bring “skills and experience acquired in their own country which might be difficult to find in the United States.”13 President John F. Kennedy visited Colombia in December 1961, not long ­after he witnessed a glittering military display of Special Forces commandos and weaponry in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, which deeply impressed him.14 A high-­level U.S. military team visited Colombia two months a­ fter President Kennedy, in February 1962, following up on the 1959 cia survey. Led by General William Yarborough, commander of the Special Warfare Center in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the team extended the 1959 cia mission’s proposals.15 The team focused its recommendations primarily on the Colombian Army, ­because it was “the most impor­tant and plays the most active role” of the five armed forces branches in counterinsurgency operations. Its report said the army’s lack of technical communications capacity was its most serious deficiency, while also calling for propaganda campaigns and psychological operations among civilian communities where government opponents ­were active. As would U.S. military advisors four de­cades ­later, the Yarborough team urged the army to become more mobile, through “imagination and initiative” by commanders, less reliance on fixed outposts, and specific resources for air mobility, which would be provided by the United States.16 The light aircraft that Yarborough recommended for the Colombian Air Force ­were “Helio Couriers,” a lightweight plane used extensively by the cia in operations at that time in Africa and Indochina. The U.S. State Department had already recommended in 1960 that the Colombian government purchase Helio Couriers, as U.S. law still barred grants of equipment to Latin Amer­i­ca police or militaries for use in internal operations.17 In a secret annex to his report, Yarborough recommended “development of a civil and military structure” that “should be used to pressure The Longest War 29\n\nt­ oward ­reforms known to be needed, perform counter-­agent and counter-­ propaganda functions and as necessary execute paramilitary, sabotage and/ or terrorist activities against known communist proponents. It should be backed by the United States.”18 To c­ ounter the absence of state entities, Yarborough promoted an extensive police presence in conflict zones. He urged “an intensive civilian registration program . . . ​so that [every­one] is eventually registered in government files together with fingerprints and photo­graphs.”19 (Such censuses l­ater w ­ ere conducted in San José de Apartadó in advance of killings.)20 The Colombian Army developed and implemented the Yarborough commission’s military recommendations in the summer of 1962 through deployment of troops against rural communist enclaves in an operation dubbed Plan Lazo.21 In September 1962 the Colombian Army a­ dopted translations of U.S. training manuals and incorporated national security doctrine into its own training, putting the civilian population and the entire country into the field of military ­battle. U.S. forces did not participate in direct combat, but Plan Lazo became a template for subsequent U.S. military involvement in Colombia: intensive assistance in doctrine, design of training programs, aircraft and other equipment, psychological operations, engineering, communications, intelligence, and supply guided and often directed the Colombian military’s counterinsurgent war.22 The National Front pact of 1958 had ended most interparty vio­lence, but it excluded large swaths of rural producers, u ­ nionized ­labor, and the ­legal communist party, who could not participate in the pact’s alternating patronage, which in any case did not address structural inequalities. In response, some peasant communities in southern Colombia drew on the remnants of Liberal guerrillas to form self-­defense forces against pájaros and government troops in 1960–62.23 With the new U.S. support, the military attacked ­these areas during the Plan Lazo offensive, which was expanded in 1964, led by Col­ o­nel Hernando Currea Cubides, who had been trained at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and Fort Leavenworth in 1952 and 1956.24 The offensive prompted the armed groups to establish the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (farc) in 1964.25 Inspired by the Cuban Revolution, groups of university students and Catholics grounded in liberation theology formed the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional, eln) the same year.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the U.S. military supervised an expanded counterinsurgency, sending more military training teams to Colombia than to any other 30 Chapter 1\n\ncountry in Latin Amer­i­ca. Colombia in 1965 formally authorized the arming of private paramilitary groups that supplemented military and police counterinsurgency operations, and the United States provided radio communication equipment to link ­these groups to state forces in more than half a dozen regions.26 From the end of that de­cade ­until the late 1980s, U.S. military involvement in Colombia continued, but it took a back seat to U.S. involvement, first in Indochina and then, in the 1980s, in Central Amer­i­ca. State Department officials calculated in 1972 that eliminating the Colombian insurgency would require “vast amounts of resources which are better utilized elsewhere.”27 In keeping with the Lleras Doctrine, by which Colombian civilian and military leaders left each other alone, the country’s military was also notoriously insular, limiting the involvement of civilian actors. One U.S. advisor said that, in the 1980s, the Colombian military was “just mean. They ­were mean, they ­were closed; every­thing was a secret.”28 While anti-­Communism and National Security doctrine promoted by the United States defined the Colombian military’s ideology, national forces also oriented the military during dif­fer­ent periods of the Cold War. In the 1950s, a new generation of officers emerged from the experience in K ­ orea, supported by the Kennedy administration’s turn ­toward irregular, counterinsurgency warfare and the ­battle for “hearts and minds.” When this group of officers, led by General Alberto Ruiz Novoa, failed to obtain support from Colombia’s economic and po­liti­cal elites for agrarian reform, another group came to the fore in the late 1970s and 1980s that sought to destroy the guerrillas’ civilian support and expanded the army’s support for paramilitary groups.29 The paramilitary expansion in the 1980s and 1990s also required private economic support, which came from traditional landowners, such as ­cattle ranchers, as well as Colombia’s new wealthy entrepreneurs, drug traffickers. Nevertheless, the U.S. military was the principal external compass for the Colombian Army, especially on issues of doctrine. A critical step for the generation of trust by Pentagon leaders in an allied military force is the incorporation of doctrine, or guide to military action, with the same goals, concepts, and organ­ization used by the United States. Once that occurs, the allied force is much more likely to pursue the same objectives as U.S. forces would if they ­were intervening directly on foreign soil. And “the Colombian Army’s doctrine is completely U.S.” in origin, several Colombian officers told me in 2013. “The armed forces,” said a U.S. diplomat in 1975, “of all the key groups in the nation, are the most pro-­U.S. in outlook.”30 The Longest War 31\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Colombia also sent nearly two thousand soldiers for training to the U.S. Army School of the Amer­i­cas (soa), which had been established in Panama in 1946. Not long ­after the school moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1984, it began to invite Colombian officers to serve as instructors as well as students. By 1989, although public attention still focused on U.S. involvement in Central Amer­i­ca, Colombia had sent more soldiers to soa—6,552—­than any other nation, numbers that would continue to grow in the 1990s and the following de­cade.31 Even though it did not represent a large funding commitment for the United States, the large number of Colombian officers passing through U.S. military courses in the 1970s and 1980s became especially significant as ­those officers ­rose in rank to the army’s leadership in the following two de­cades. For example, between 1995 and 2010, eight of the eleven commanders of the army’s Seventeenth Brigade, which had jurisdiction in San José de Apartadó, attended a course at the School of the Amer­ic­ as. “­Today, U.S. influence [on the Colombian military] is obvious, from structural similarities such as the replication in Colombia of US doctrine with the formation of Joint commands to cosmetic similarities such as uniforms,” wrote a U.S. military instructor in 2008.32 As the Cold War declined in importance a­ fter 1989, U.S. military and police assistance to Colombia steadily grew u ­ nder the rubric of counternarcotics programs. The Andean Initiative announced by President George H. W. Bush in August 1989 was followed quickly by a $65 million emergency delivery of equipment that included tens of thousands of weapons, warheads, and mortars, part of $127 million in U.S. nominally counterdrug assistance to Colombia that year.33 Although the military openly acknowledged that its missions ­were not focused on counterdrug operations, which w ­ ere carried out by police, more than three-­quarters of the package went to the military.34 A U.S. officer who trained Colombian Special Forces units in October 1992 said, “We ­were giving military forces training in infantry counterinsurgency doctrine. We knew perfectly well, as did the host-­nation commanders, that narcotics was a flimsy cover story for beefing up the capacity of armed forces who had lost the confidence of the population.”35 While army contacts focused on counterinsurgency, the Drug Enforcement Administration (dea) handled most U.S. drug war operations in Colombia, in concert with national police. In the early 1990s, t­ hose operations ­were focused on a single objective, at the expense of all e­ lse: the capture and ultimately the killing of Pablo Escobar Gaviria.

Escobar was the notorious chief of the Medellín drug cartel that had unleashed campaigns of terror against public officials who threatened to extradite cartel leaders or interfere with their business. In June 1991 Escobar surrendered to authorities on condition that he dictate the terms of his imprisonment, which was in a compound dubbed “the Cathedral,” and from which he continued to carry out hom­i­cides and drug business. When he escaped from confinement in July 1992, the hunt for him galvanized a power­ ful collection of actors, including U.S. agencies, the Cali drug cartel and its professional killers, and the Colombian police and military. Escobar’s relentless vio­lence against both state forces and rivals led to the formation of the ­People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar (Los Pepes), which conducted a bloody campaign, torturing and killing hundreds of Escobar’s ­lawyers, financiers, and underlings and their ­family members. The Pepes included other drug traffickers and assassins, many in the pay of Escobar’s competitors in the Cali Cartel. T ­ hese included the Castaño b ­ rothers—­Fidel and Carlos—­and Diego Murillo Bejarano, alias “Don Berna,” a former guerrilla in the Popu­lar Liberation Army (Ejército Popu­lar de Liberación, epl)\n\nThe Longest War 33\n\nthat operated in Urabá. Both Fidel Castaño and Don Berna had worked in Escobar’s organ­ization. (Don Berna in 2005 would control the paramilitary group that committed the massacre in San José de Apartadó.) Many other p ­ eople and agencies, both Colombian and U.S., participated in the hunt for Pablo Escobar between his July 1992 escape and December 1993, when he was killed. The cia deployed a then-­advanced airborne intelligence platform that intercepted and located Escobar’s phone calls, and the National Security Agency (nsa), Federal Bureau of Investigation ­ ere also involved. President George H. W. Bush au(fbi), and Navy Seals w thorized the deployment of the U.S. Army Special Forces’ ultrasecret Delta Force, which trained a Colombian police unit formed in 1992 called the Bloque de Búsqueda (Search Block). U.S. pi­lots w ­ ere sent to Medellín to train Bloque pi­lots and accompanied them on raids.36 The Pepes w ­ ere supporting the Bloque, however, which was giving the Pepes intelligence provided by the United States, according to Lieutenant General Jack Sheehan, who in 1993 directed overseas operations at the Pentagon. Don Berna came and went from the Bloque’s headquarters “as if he owned the place,” according to a Bloque officer.37 Cables show that the dea, U.S. ambassador Morris Busby, and State Department officials in Washington ­were aware of the collaboration between their Bloque clients and the Pepes, but no one raised an objection. dea officers reportedly spoke admiringly of the Pepes and wore T-­shirts that referred to them.38 In November 1993 cia analysts reported that Bloque operatives actually participated in Pepes executions and bombings. Journalist Mark Bowden concluded that the Pepes gave ­orders to the police, more than the other way around.39 The director of the Colombian National Police (cnp) ordered a se­nior police intelligence officer to “maintain contact with Fidel Castaño, paramilitary leader of Los Pepes, for purposes of intelligence collection,” a cia cable reported in August 1993. A U.S. intelligence profile of Castaño described him as “one of Colombia’s most ruthless criminals” and observed that Castaño “is more ferocious than Escobar, has more military capability, and can count on fellow antiguerrillas in the Colombian Army and the Colombian National Police.”40 Among the Colombian military officers involved in the Escobar hunt was a twenty-­eight-­year-­old army captain, Néstor Iván Duque, who l­ ater played a critical role in the 2005 army-­paramilitary operation in San José de Apartadó that killed Luis Eduardo Guerra and his ­family. From 1992 to 1994 Duque was second in command of a U.S. Embassy–­supported unit in Bogotá, the Urban Anti-­Terrorist Special Forces, when the unit was part of the hunt for 34 Chapter 1\n\nPablo Escobar, and subsequently in operations against the Cali Cartel. “It was as if it w ­ ere an American military force, but with Colombian men,” he told me, since all its supplies and even an army captain came from the U.S. Embassy.41 Escobar’s cartel was far from being the only violent group during the period, however, and police and judges w ­ ere not the only groups of victims. Although popu­lar dramatizations rarely reference the civil war occurring at the time, the Castaños and their gunmen waged a war against the or­ga­nized Left, especially the Patriotic Union (Unión Patriótica, up) party. When the dea and their cnp colleagues and Fidel Castaño collaborated against Escobar’s associates and their families in 1992, Castaño had already assembled death squads that had authored the murder of up presidential candidates, as well as seven massacres in Urabá and Córdoba, where Castaño and other traffickers ­were buying up land to become a new elite.42 When Escobar was killed on a rooftop in Medellín in December 1993, ­there ­were several beneficiaries, but perhaps chief among them w ­ ere the Pepes—­who became autodefensas: “self-­defense” forces, or paramilitaries. “The weapons used by the Pepes w ­ ere then used by the self-­defense forces,” said Murillo Bejarano, who became a paramilitary chief and, many believe, successor to Escobar. “Without the Pepes, the self-­defense forces would not have existed.”43 Less than a month ­after Escobar’s death, a sniper killed Fidel Castaño in San Pedro de Urabá. A year ­later, in March 1995, Fidel’s ­brothers Carlos and Vicente, together with a former army captain, formally founded the Peasant Self-­Defense Forces of Córdoba and Urabá (Autodefensas Campesinas de Córdoba y Urabá, accu).44 Their experience in Los Pepes gave the Castaño ­brothers and Don Berna the contacts and protection they needed to make the paramilitary proj­ect into a national federation. But first, they would turn it loose onto the Urabá region, which they conquered using limitless brutality.\n\nWar on Drugs or on Insurgents? As the 1990s progressed, debate heated up among policy makers about the purposes of the U.S. role in Colombia. Official policy dictated that U.S. activities ­were restricted to fighting the production and trafficking of ­narcotics, particularly cocaine, and w ­ ere not to cross the line into counterinsurgency. Some leaders saw the drug war as better terrain on which to establish the legitimacy of a U.S. role than fighting guerrillas, which po­liti­cally had gone poorly in both The Longest War 35\n\nVietnam and, to a lesser extent, Central Amer­i­ca. This official line met with increased re­sis­tance from counterinsurgency hawks, especially military officers, both U.S. and Colombian. By 1996 the U.S. preference for military and police assistance and corporate trade over humanitarian assistance was on display. In March 1996 the State Department did cut some military and police assistance to Colombia for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 b ­ ecause of revelations of the narco-­financing of President Ernesto Samper’s campaign. The action suspended $33 million of aid for up to seventeen months and cancelled $1.4 million in military training. Nevertheless, Special Forces deployments to Colombia w ­ ere exempt 45 from the ban. When U.S. decertification of President Samper’s government affected"
