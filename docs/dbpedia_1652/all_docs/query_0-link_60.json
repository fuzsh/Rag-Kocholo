Roughly eight years and several thousand emails later, this volume is a record of our friendship and a tribute to the many other alliances we developed along the way. In February 2014, our panel “Surrealism and Counterculture, 1960–1980” took place at that year’s College Art Association conference in Chicago. To an already impressive lineup that included papers by Katharine Conley, Marie Arleth Skov, Ryan Standfest, and Sandra Zalman, we hoped to add a special guest: Chicago surrealist Penelope Rosemont. However, Penelope proved very difficult to find; no amount of internet searching seemed to work. About a week before the conference, in one final push, Abigail decided to call the Heartland Café in Chicago, where Penelope had participated in surrealist poetry readings years earlier. A nice gentleman on the other end of the line explained that the Heartland had been sold and that the new owners probably didn’t know anyone by the name of Penelope Rosemont. He took down our contact information anyway. A few days later, Abigail’s phone rang. “Hello, this is Penelope Rosemont.” Our project quickly became a new kind of collaboration—one between surrealists and academics, a rare endeavor to say the least. When Penelope joined us on our CAA panel in Chicago in 2014, she told us that the police riots in ’68 had taken place right outside the conference hotel, where she and other surrealists had been handing out leaflets to protestors. Our hotel rooms were the very ones in which the Democratic National Convention delegates had stayed, unable to avoid the clouds of tear gas wafting up to their rooms. We realized then that our volume had to be one that accounted for living histories. With all this in mind, we are extremely grateful, first and foremost, to our contributors, who remained committed to this project even when its final shape remained elusive. At Penn State University Press, we are indebted to Ellie Goodman, Maddie Caso, and series editor Jonathan Eburne. The careful peer reviews organized by PSU Press improved the volume substantially; whoever you are—thank you. We also feel very fortunate that we were able to work with our outstanding copyeditor, Suzanne Wolk. Many people contributed assistance with images and permissions. In particular, we thank Robert Green, who generously supplied our half title image; Penelope Rosemont, who opened her archive to us; Laura Corsiglia; Cosey Fanni Tutti; the Genesis P-Orridge\n\nEstate; George Lois; Karin Kyburz; Rachel Pointer (Industrial Worker editor-in-chief); J.

Labadie Collection); and Cheryl Hardwick-Moore and the Michael O’Donoghue Estate/ Evergreen Review. Support for the publication of this book was provided by the Class of 1956 Provost’s Faculty Development Endowment at Washington and Lee University. Additional assistance was provided by a Lenfest Summer Research Grant, also through Washington and Lee University. Abigail extends sincere thanks to Paul and Beth Garon, Penelope Rosemont, and Ron Sakolsky for their support. To Helen, Michael, Merridawn, Bryan, Selma, and the whole family, love and gratitude.

King\n\nOn August 28, 1968, the third day of the thirty-fifth Democratic National Convention, approximately ten thousand civil rights and antiwar demonstrators clashed violently with police in Chicago’s Grant Park. The protestors had arrived from across the country to oppose existing systems of institutionalized power and to push for the nomination of Senator Eugene McCarthy as the candidate who would finally withdraw US troops from the ongoing war in Vietnam. Anticipating a volatile situation, Mayor Richard J. Daley assembled nearly twenty-three thousand police officers and National Guardsmen to maintain “law and order”; their orders: “shoot to kill, if necessary.”1 At around 3:30 p.m., the police began beating protestors severely with billy clubs, ostensibly incited when a young man lowered an American flag on display in the park (fig. I.1). The crowd responded by pelting soldiers and officers with rocks and pieces of concrete.2 Clouds of tear gas enveloped the brawl, with some demonstrators taking refuge in the nearby Hilton Hotel on Michigan Avenue. The police riot stunned millions of viewers who had tuned in for live television coverage; it appeared that the country was tearing itself apart at the seams. To cover the convention and the violent unrest that ultimately surrounded it, the\n\neditor of Esquire magazine, Harold Hayes, assembled a remarkable team of writers: Jean Genet, William Burroughs, Terry Southern, and war correspondent John Sack. The four men appear on George Lois’s memorable cover of the November 1968 issue of Esquire, staring confrontationally at the viewer, the body of an apparently unconscious protestor sprawled at their feet (see color plate 1). Lois had originally sent a photographer to the convention to shoot what he called the “unholy quartet” of “underground intellectual mavericks” in action, but after watching the traumatic footage of the “Chicago carnage,” Lois came up with the idea of a staged tableau that would symbolize the savagery of the police riot: Genet (“the French high priest of decadence”), Burroughs (“the Beat Generation expatriate spokesman”), Southern (“the irreverent ‘Candy’ man”), and Sack (“the anti-war war-correspondent”), all surrounding the “Christ-like image of a jeansclad student, lying in a bloody gutter.”3 The photograph unites the disparate group of\n\nFig. I.1 Police and demonstrators in a melee near the Conrad Hilton Hotel on Chicago’s Michigan Avenue, August 28, 1968, during the Democratic National Convention.

What does Esquire’s coverage reveal about surrealism in the context of the Chicago riots and, more broadly, the politically engaged cultural movements of the 1960s and 1970s? The question has both a straightforward and an expansive answer, depending upon how one interprets surrealist action and its import, and such complexities of interpretation encompass the methodological issue we seek to address in this volume. None of the four writers identified himself as a surrealist, though according to Southern’s account of the convention and protests, Esquire was aware of the implicit affinity between Genet, a mature member of the European avant-garde with ties to surrealism, and the prominent role that Burroughs and Southern self-consciously played in an American inheritance of that avant-garde precedent after World War II. Southern (whose contributions to American black humor Ryan Standfest discusses in this volume) even invokes surrealism in the opening lines of his report, writing that the violent racism evident everywhere on the streets of Chicago was like “something right out of a Buñuel movie.”4 Other witnesses to the Chicago events also used the word “surreal” to describe the bloodshed that ensued as police officers discarded their badges and waded into the crowds, batons in hand.5 3\n\nSurrealism as Radicalism\n\nIt would be easy to overlook such passing invocations of surrealism in the 1960s, particularly given the paucity of scholarship on the surrealist movement’s activity and influence during these years. Surrealism has gone practically unmentioned in the ever-growing bibliography of secondary texts devoted to the “long sixties.” In the context of the United States, one might credit this in part to the large number of young people born during the postwar “baby boom” who lacked any historical context for surrealism before or during World War II. In 1964, seventeen-year-olds—that is, those born in 1947—made up the largest segment of the US population, while the founding members of the surrealist movement, most born during the last decade of the nineteenth century, were then approximately the same age as their grandparents. When free speech movement activist Jack Weinberg advised students in 1965, “Don’t trust anyone over thirty,” surrealism as an organized movement was already more than forty years old.6 From the vantage point of progressive activism, only a few ultraleft revolutionary currents from the 1950s and beyond vocally identified surrealism as a precursor, much less a partner.7 And yet surrealists were active—vigorously engaged, in fact—in the period’s protest politics and culture, and the impact of this ongoing radicalism was palpable on an international scale.8 While historical accounts of the 1968 Chicago convention highlight demonstrations organized by “yippies” and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) members, for example—perhaps most notable in a surrealist spirit was the yippies’ nomination of Pigasus the Pig as a presidential candidate—it is often overlooked that surrealists themselves had a concrete presence in the Chicago riots: about three thousand copies of the August edition of Surrealist Insurrection, a wall poster/broadsheet produced by the Chicago Surrealist Group, circulated among the throngs assembled in Grant Park. Founded in January of that year, after Penelope and Franklin Rosemont’s return from an extended Paris sojourn spent in frequent contact and collaboration with André Breton and other members of the mid-1960s Paris Surrealist Group, Surrealist Insurrection had already established itself as a strident voice for the radical Left by the time the Chicago protests began. The first issue, published January 22, 1968, implored readers to give to the “Huey Newton Defense Fund,” supporting the cofounder of the Black Panther Party who had been accused of murdering an Oakland police officer and wounding another (the Paris surrealists answered with an international money order in March; the same month, the cover of the Paris group’s magazine, L’Archibras, featured a telephone with the dial’s numbers spelling out B-L-A-C-K-P-OW-E-R) (fig. I.2). The second issue of Surrealist Insurrection solicited donations for the Survival Fig. I.2 Cover of L’Archibras, no. 3 (March 1968). Editor’s collection. of American Indians Association, a group advancing the “restoration of the splendid cultures of our Introductory Essays\n\n4\n\n5\n\nSurrealism as Radicalism\n\nIndian brothers, against the tyranny of the US government, army, and ruling class.”9 Dedicated to “the total liberation of man,” the August issue seemed directed at the Democratic National Convention, demanding “a vast, multi-level, interconnected program of cultural guerrilla warfare.” Unquestionably, surrealism regarded itself as a partner and participant “in the service of the revolution in 1968!”10 To recognize surrealism’s support of the Chicago activists is already to go beyond the movement’s usual historical confines, which are too often misleadingly bookended by the two world wars or punctuated by André Breton’s death in 1966. Even so, it would be myopic to limit surrealism’s impact to members’ direct actions—even though many of these protest activities remain understudied. It is our view that the varied, implied, and sometimes latent affinities of key counterculture ideas and movements with the events and legacies of surrealist protest in action and in art are significant in their own right. This is so in spite of the fact that these affinities tend to be neglected as a result of disciplinary constraints, the continued epistemological influence of teleology on historical analysis, and persistent academic tendencies to shun the popular, among other pressures. In this volume we articulate surrealism’s example, influence, and longevity as a broad continuum of social and political radicalism that invites purposeful as well as inadvertent cultural feedback loops and revisitations. We do not intend this panoramic interpretation of surrealism’s permutations to diminish surrealists’ individual roles in the politics and culture of this period—quite the opposite, as several of the chapters included in this volume make clear. Rather, we hope to productively expand the scholarly purview and challenge the validity of historicist methods to surrealism’s persistently living culture. It is in this light that Esquire’s DNC writers serve as a fertile starting point for reconsidering what might be described as the generosity of surrealism’s praxis for continued cultural extension and adaptation for oppositional—rather than commercial, academic, or institutional—purposes. At the same time, we cannot wholly disregard the popular invocation of the term “surreal” to describe these tumultuous events. While the widespread interpretation of surrealism as a mere byword for “bizarre,” “dreamlike,” or “nightmarish”—a derivation prompted chiefly by the surrealist movement’s most famous artists of the 1930s (e.g., Max Ernst, René Magritte, and Salvador Dalí)—does considerable disservice to the movement by limiting its multifaceted and pan-national character to the domain of art while also neglecting its vibrant intellectual and political rigor, it is nonetheless misleading to indiscriminately ignore this very real legacy of surrealism in the collective public consciousness. In the end, this popular reception of surrealism’s oneiric timbre, superficial as it may be in relation to the movement’s expressed aims, may have most completely infiltrated the decade’s visual culture, music, psychedelic subcultures, and other public and sometimes commercial realms. Although this volume is more interested in the Introductory Essays\n\n6\n\nlongevity and impact of surrealism’s social and political radicalism, our methodology invites examinations of revolt in popular culture as well. The concept of a surrealist continuum in the decades after World War II, both within and outside the movement, has been neglected in surrealism scholarship until very recently, with only a handful of publications addressing important intersections between surrealism and various nonsurrealist strains of social and political radicalism. Of these, Alyce Mahon’s 2005 book, Surrealism and the Politics of Eros, 1938–1968, is among the most thorough and innovative in reframing the movement’s activities of the late 1960s as radically engaged, positing that the acme of surrealism’s revolutionary spirit could be found in the student-led protests in Paris in May 1968. Mahon’s contribution to this collection furthers her important work on this subject. The most detailed documentation of surrealism in the 1960s and 1970s, meanwhile, has emerged from surrealists themselves, and especially from members of the Chicago Surrealist Group, with authors such as Penelope Rosemont and Franklin Rosemont and affiliated authors Ron Sakolsky, Robin D. G. Kelley, and others demonstrating that surrealism was not simply active in the latter twentieth century but actually characteristic of the period’s wider spirit of emancipation and protest.11 To cite Franklin Rosemont and Robin D. G. Kelley with reference to the American atmosphere in the 1960s, a “Surrealist spirit was soon making its presence felt just about everywhere. Distrust of authority, defiance of injustice, and passionate yearning for Freedom Now! were in the wind along with a large-scale resurgence of poetry—not just reading it but living it—and a firm determination to change the world and have a good time.”12 Given the centrality of political engagement to surrealism’s collective aims, it is perhaps unsurprising that surrealist concerns would continue to dovetail with other political currents of the 1960s and 1970s. As the thirteen chapters in this volume attest, a number of both subterranean and conspicuous aspects of international counterculture in the postwar period invoked surrealism’s previous and ongoing radicalism in political views, cultural orientation, and aesthetics, as well as its continued engagement in actions for social change. We have already mentioned surrealism’s significant role in the spirit and especially the imagery of postwar popular culture. Although this impact cannot be outside our awareness, this volume consciously approaches its subject from the vantage of counterculture—a term the American historian Theodore Roszak coined in 1968. For Roszak, the generational gap, “radical disaffiliation,” and “cultural disjunction” instigated by the youthful counterculture posed one of the few remaining avenues of hope for breaking out of an existence of “immiseration” within the technocracy. Even so, Roszak’s own definition of the counterculture and who represented it remained unclear, and even at its origins in the late 1960s, the term in no way sufficiently encompassed the scope and impetus of the student, antiwar, and civil rights movements, to mention just a few key revolutionary currents in the United States alone.13 The resistance movements of the 1960s 7\n\nSurrealism as Radicalism\n\nand ’70s were not just against the prevailing majority culture: they were passionately opposed to the violence of war, capitalist exploitation, racist and sexist oppression, class dominance, and many other deeply troubling social issues—all of which are still with us today in various guises. Certainly, in this contemporary moment, when the notion of culture itself has been thoroughly destabilized by digital technology, global commerce, and the resurgence of different strains of fascism—and when the dichotomies of high/low, popular/elite, avant-garde/mainstream have lost relevance in the face of the omnivorous nature of internet consumerism—it is clear that Roszak’s simple binary of “the establishment” versus “the counterculture” cannot adequately describe the complexities of shifting cultural systems and modes of revolt against them. Accordingly, Radical Dreams alters and adapts Roszak’s generational paradigm of rebellion, with all its limitations, not as an operational theoretical construct but rather as a historical trope that gathered most of its meaning from the original context of his famous book and accrued broader meaning in its vernacular use thereafter. The “counterculture” referred to in the subtitle of this volume, then, alludes not to a transhistorical sociological notion of sub- or fringe cultures but rather to specific manifestations of leftist reformist groups and currents of cultural nonconformity that erupted internationally following World War II, and during the 1960s and ’70s in particular. While “counterculture” remains bound by its historical signification in this volume, our use of the terms “radical” and “resistance,” denoting a powerful commitment to revolutionary change, remains deliberately open-ended in terms of time and place, limited though we are by the necessarily perfunctory scope of a single volume. By placing surrealism within a broader history of radicalism and resistance in the twentieth century and comparatively alongside other instances of dissent and experiment, future studies of surrealism may succeed in avoiding some of the baggage of qualification and presumptions of aesthetic insularity with which it sometimes has been burdened—in the hands, for example, of writers such as the American art critic Clement Greenberg, who in 1939 envisioned the afterlife of surrealism as synonymous with mass-market kitsch, or the German theoretician Peter Bürger, who in 1984 described surrealism’s survival after World War II as a reactionary string of neo-avant-gardes.14 Likewise, concerning the ongoing debate within surrealism studies over the distinctions between, and validity of, presumed “orthodox,” “dissident,” “pop,” “late,” and “post” surrealisms, the view of surrealism as an ongoing form of radicalism mitigates to some degree historicist tendencies, artificial boundaries created by biased theoretical camps, and judgments about the authentic versus the pseudo among connoisseurs. If we set aside the hierarchies of Greenberg’s art criticism and the teleologies of Bürger’s modernisms and postmodernisms, among other hegemonic methodologies, we may discover the potential for the emergence of provocative cultural models; networks of latent and manifest affinities; constellations Introductory Essays\n\n8\n\nof cultural adaptation, extension, and appropriation; precocious games of generational inheritance, disinheritance, and self-identification; passionate solidarities. Our use of the term “counterculture,” then, connects the oppositional resistance of avant-garde factions linked to “Old Left” causes with the disparate activities and aims of the New Left. We therefore agree with the French journalist Michel Lancelot, whose 1974 book about the “counterfeiters” of “la contre-culture” took Roszak to task for his failure to recognize the roots of the youth movement in the prewar avant-gardes, in particular surrealism. Surrealism, Lancelot wrote, is a “movement fundamental to modern counterculture.”15 Lancelot’s argument was expanded by the German sociologist and literary scholar Elisabeth Lenk, a student of Theodor Adorno and a member of the Paris Surrealist Group between 1953 and 1957. Lenk describes the surrealists of the 1920s as pursuing “social engagement as surreal practice” with a “vehemence that anticipated, in a nutshell, all the protest movements of the 1960s: antipsychiatry, prisoners’ movement, antimilitarism, critique of fossilized universities.”16 Another influential figure for our examination of surrealism and counterculture is the renowned theorist of the counterculture associated with the Frankfurt School, Herbert Marcuse. Unlike Roszak, who had no connection to surrealism and whose frequently reductive opinions about counterculture were critiqued by various members of the New Left, Marcuse’s philosophy was deeply influenced by surrealism’s example and critically important to the international youth movement of the 1960s and ’70s. Marcuse corresponded with Franklin Rosemont and the Chicago surrealists for a number of years following a November 1971 conference for the journal Telos in Buffalo, New York. One of Rosemont’s envelopes to Marcuse from April 1973, embellished with hand-drawn psychedelic designs, seems to instill into a single piece of ephemera the immense importance of their rigorous exchange for a paradigm of contiguity between counterculture and its forerunners in radicalism before World War II (color plate 2). Writing about these epistles nearly twenty years later, Rosemont quoted from Marcuse’s final book, The Aesthetic Dimension: Toward a Critique of Marxist Aesthetics (1977), highlighting a passage from the preface that discusses the prefigurative revolutionary purpose of art: “‘The work of art cannot be comprehended in terms of social theory, neither can it be comprehended in terms of philosophy. . . . What appears in art as remote from the praxis of change demands recognition as a necessary element in a future praxis of liberation. . . . Art cannot change the world, but it can contribute to changing the consciousness and drives of the men and women who could change the world.’” Rosemont responded, “Could any surrealist have better expressed the surrealist approach to the fundamental problems of human expression in our time?”17 This volume explores conversations between surrealism and diverse international modes of resistance to dominant culture in the postwar period in four interrelated sections: 9\n\nSurrealism as Radicalism\n\n“Surrealist Solidarity,” “Against the Liquidators,” “The Right to Insubordination,” and “Passional Attractions.” Rather than present a chronological narration of surrealism’s historical reception and continuation after World War II, the four sections sketch what we see as a meandering story of surrealism’s oppositional culture through which related cultures and subcultures of resistance emerge and build over time and across place. While these four sections serve as an organizing framework and a methodological statement for our volume, they should not be understood as comprehensive or in any sense nonporous. Rather, we have taken up the call for what Ron Sakolsky describes in his chapter as surrealism’s “radical inclusivity” in the hope that this study will catalyze further investigations. A developing subfield may be required to address the vast and overlooked cultural history of surrealist countercultures—a project that, by its very genealogical nature, challenges the academic tendency to narrowly delimit the discourse of surrealism studies to questions of style, orthodoxy, or historical development. While the majority of our contributors are art historians, this volume ultimately attempts to undermine the confines of disciplinarity, publishing essays by academics alongside those of contemporary surrealists. One of the primary ways to battle academic misconceptions or obfuscations of surrealist aims is simply to include surrealist voices in scholarly discourse, although this has rarely been done in the recent past except by surrealists themselves. Using a methodology of hermeneutic continuity, the volume privileges material culture and transhistorical approaches, fosters relational rather than dialectical analytics, and maps spatio-temporal narratives of cultural migration, continuation, and longevity. Above all, our study approaches surrealism and its offshoots as a living and immensely relevant set of “cultures” that continue to morph and mutate in unpredictable and often unorthodox ways—for the most part fomenting urgent drives for social change. From our point of view, when surrealism and its related countercultures are studied as a set of resistance tactics and tools of direct action for social critique and transformation, rather than as just another instance of modernism’s influence and legacy, surrealism’s potential relevance for oppositional efforts in the present is also awakened. We commence our examination with an introductory essay by the French-Brazilian scholar and surrealist Michael Löwy, whose extensive work on surrealism over the past four decades has been pivotal in shifting scholarly dialogues away from an art-historical model and toward a deeper understanding of surrealism as a dynamic social movement rooted in political struggle. Löwy’s essay on May ’68 considers surrealism’s scope and span over the course of the past century from the self-conscious perspective of the present, thereby encouraging readers to read the succeeding chapters with an engaged orientation toward historical events as informing the contemporary moment. Part 1, “Surrealist Solidarity,” explores the idea that between the 1960s and the 1980s, different facets of international surrealism simultaneously fostered the internal Introductory Essays\n\n10\n\ncohesion of surrealism’s ideas and aims, and also external alliances with nonsurrealist comrades from revolutionary and oppositional movements, such as SDS, Black Power, and the American Indian Movement. Likewise, certain countercultural groups evinced a powerful “solidarity” with surrealism itself, particularly when it came to the contentious issue of the musealization of this avant-garde, which became a symbol of the mainstream appropriation of leftist culture. “Surrealist solidarity” was a phrase favored by the Chicago Surrealist Group in the 1960s and ’70s and was related to the Chicago group’s interest in workers’ communities and unions, such as the Industrial Workers of the World, to which they belonged. Following its use in the workers’ movement, the term “solidarity” evoked for the Chicago surrealists an ethos of unshakeable mutualism amid constant struggle. In conjunction with this resonance, we employ the phrase specifically as a way of challenging the art-historical rhetoric of stylistic coherence and influence in order to emphasize the nature of surrealism as a sociocultural movement of interrelated affinity groups, which continually fostered and inspired liaisons with numerous allies in the so-called Old and New Left, just as it sustained and continually reignited the vigilance of its own social critique from the 1920s onward. The first chapter in this section, by Sandra Zalman, documents the protests that erupted in response to Dada, Surrealism, and Their Heritage, the 1968 landmark exhibition of surrealism curated by William Rubin at New York’s Museum of Modern Art. Zalman frames Dada, Surrealism, and Their Heritage as a prominent rallying point for the question of surrealism’s legacy among certain radical leftist factions in the United States at a time when large-scale surrealism retrospectives were seeking to academically historicize—and problematically ossify—the movement’s history. Next, Grégory Pierrot’s chapter addresses the way in which the American poet Ted Joans combined his dedication to jazz, surrealism, and the Black Power movement in what might be called an aesthetics of direct action (fig. I.3). Highlighting Joans’s Black Manifesto in Jazz Poetry and Prose (1969) and his participation in the Pan-African Cultural Festival in Algiers in July ’69, Pierrot argues that, for Joans, surrealism was a means but never an end to liberation. Part 1 concludes with a new essay by Penelope Rosemont, cofounder of the Chicago Surrealist Group in the mid-1960s. If surrealism can be said to have had a lively presence in American counterculture in the 1960s and ’70s, it is largely thanks to the Chicago group and its surrealist allies in San Francisco and elsewhere, who embraced the left-wing radicalism that was lacking in the American public’s general understanding of surrealism.18 In line with their international counterparts, the Chicago surrealists declared their ideological support of “virtually every distinctive current of sixties and seventies radicalism—including youth revolt, war protest, women’s liberation, Black Power, sexual freedom, Native American resistance, animal rights and radical environmentalism.”19 11\n\nSurrealism as Radicalism\n\nFig. I.3 Chris Felver, Ted Joans at the Blackboard, New York, 1980. Photo: Chris Felver via Getty Images.\n\nSituated within the period’s complex web of anti-authoritarian currents, Chicago surrealism was, and remains, an impassioned vehicle for what Breton cited early on as the movement’s dual “watchwords”: “Transform the world” (Marx) and “Change Life” (Rimbaud). Rosemont’s chapter frames the activities of the Chicago surrealists during the 1970s in terms of an “angry, hopeful chaos,” highlighting the founding of their journal, Arsenal: Surrealist Subversion, and their important 1976 World Surrealist Exhibition, documented in the catalog Marvelous Freedom / Vigilance of Desire. Part 2, “Against the Liquidators,” featuring chapters by Claire Howard, Gavin Parkinson, and Alyce Mahon, illuminates one of the core claims of this volume: that surrealist political engagement and active protest culture form the clearest corollary with the period’s counterculture movements. We take the title “Against the Liquidators” (face aux liquidateurs) from the title of a surrealist tract of April 1964—one of two statements disseminated that month protesting Patrick Waldberg’s retrospective exhibition of surrealism, Le surréalisme: Sources, histoire, affinités, at the Galerie Charpentier in Paris. According to “Against the Liquidators,” Waldberg had attempted to bury surrealism alive and reduce its cultural dynamism to caricature.20 Following the sentiments of this surrealist statement from the mid-1960s, part 2 of the volume argues that surrealism not only influenced countercultures of resistance in the 1960s and 1970s but also, through its own continuity of radicalism before and after World War II, itself became one of these many countercultures, albeit one with unusually strong foundations in the past. Claire Howard’s chapter opens this section by clearly identifying the dynamic synergy between surrealist genealogies of sexual and psychic liberation and the well-known counterculture enthusiasm in the post–World War II period for unbounded eroticism and psychedelic states. Howard places the 1965 international surrealist exhibition L’Écart absolu in the context of philosopher Charles Fourier’s writings on gender equality and sexual liberation and their reception in 1960s France (fig. I.4). Dedicated to Fourier, L’Écart absolu drew its title from his proposal for an “absolute deviation” from established institutions and modes of thought, and, as Howard argues convincingly, broadcast surrealist support for his platform of women’s equality, anti-utilitarian erotic pleasure, and nonmarital polyamory. Surrealist protest energies gathered at the nexus of antiwar, anticolonialist, and anti-oppression discourses, as Gavin Parkinson reminds us in his chapter exploring the enthusiastic surrealist reception of American artist Robert Rauschenberg. Parkinson places Rauschenberg’s French reception in the heated context of the Algerian War (1954–62), against which the surrealists were among the first to organize. This surrealist appreciation of Rauschenberg as against America, capitalism, and pop art can be seen as a prominent point of dialogue between the avant-gardes and the counterculture.\n\n13\n\nSurrealism as Radicalism\n\nIn another instance of visualizing sensibilities of political resistance, Alyce Mahon explores Chilean painter Roberto Matta’s politicized reading of Freud’s concepts of Eros and Thanatos in relation to specific historical instances of war, torture, oppression, revolt, and social hope. Mahon surveys Matta’s disturbing invocations of torture and brutality during the Algerian War, and also the painting Burn, Baby, Burn (1965–66), which she presents as a response to the American race riots of 1964–65. Matta’s active participation in the Paris protests of May ’68, including the four protest posters he produced for the student movement, reveals another striking correlation between surrealist aesthetics and countercultural engagement in this era (fig. I.5). Part 3 of this volume, “The Right to Insubordination,” presents chapters by Mikkel Bolt Rasmussen, Jonathan P. Eburne, and Ron Sakolsky in an effort to articulate the ongoing potential for surrealist activity as a mode of radical praxis for activating political and social change—for surrealists and nonsurrealists alike. “The Right to Insubordination” comes from the title “Declaration on the Right to Insubordination in the Algerian War,” popularly known as the “Declaration of the 121,” an open letter initiated by the Paris Surrealist Group and eventually signed in 1960 by 247 influential cultural figures in France, including the surrealists André Breton, Jean Schuster, and José Pierre. These signatories denounced the use of torture by the French government in the Algerian War and called for the recognition of the legitimacy of the Algerian struggle for independence from colonial rule and the right of conscientious objectors to opt out of French military service in the suppression of Algerian insurgency.21 We invoke this “right to insubordination” of the “Declaration of the 121” to call attention to surrealism’s ongoing protest actions from the 1920s to the 1960s and the movement’s general opposition to authoritarianism, colonialism, and other forms of social control and oppression. The chapters in this section highlight the ways in which surrealism has served as a foundation for both surrealist and nonsurrealist resistance efforts. Mikkel Bolt Rasmussen begins this section by revealing the complex ties between surrealism and the Situationist International, connections that cannot be reduced to questions of legacy or the straightforward dualistic paradigm of homage and repudiation, originality and repetition. Rasmussen argues that Guy Debord continued to recognize surrealism’s crucial contribution to the formation of a socially engaged art, even while he excoriated the movement for its shortcomings and alleged failures. Jonathan Eburne pursues this inquiry into legacy, appropriation, and surrealism’s enduring relevance in his chapter on “Afrosurrealism,” a term coined by American poet Amiri Baraka in 1988. Baraka’s neologism gestures toward the international surrealist movement while remaining independent from it, demarcating, in Baraka’s words, a “broken quality, almost to [the point of] abstraction,” that “is a function of change and transition.” Eburne describes how Afrosurrealism offers a term for the simultaneous Introductory Essays\n\n14\n\n“art” and “science” of Black counterculture, anticipating Paul Gilroy’s portrayal of the Black Atlantic as a “counterculture of modernity.” Ron Sakolsky concludes part 3 of this volume with what he calls an adventure story of “passionate encounters.” Sakolsky has worked closely with the Chicago surrealists over the past two decades to fortify the ties between surrealism studies and current efforts in radical activism in the United States and Canada. Much as the Chicago surrealists have continuously critiqued the historicization of surrealism in the American academic establishment, Sakolsky’s chapter, which chronicles American surrealism\n\nFig. I.4 Pierre Faucheux, cover of the catalogue L’Écart absolu (1965).

It does so by linking surrealism to causes of animal and environmental activism, feminism, and antiracism in the late twentieth century and the new millennium. For Sakolsky, surrealism’s ongoing war on “miserabilism” takes effect through the surrealist practice of automatism as a form of anti-oppression, pursued in conjunction with the tactic of direct-action protest. As noted above, Franklin Rosemont and Robin D. G. Kelley observed a surrealist “spirit” everywhere in the late 1960s, and it is this overarching visual, popular, and material cultural pervasiveness of radicalism that we emphasize in the volume’s final section, “Passional Attractions.” The title is adapted from Charles Fourier’s theory of attraction passionnée, which observes that humans innately pursue relations and form bonds with the things, activities, and individuals that stimulate the most pleasure and harmony. Profoundly significant to the surrealists in the 1960s, Fourier’s doctrine of passional attractions unites the chapters of part 4 under the working concept that significant nonsurrealist cultural formations in this era were organized around the impetus of surrealist affinity. Part 4 thus questions not just what interdisciplinary surrealism studies can learn from such affinity groups but also how, through their analysis, our field can become enriched, expanded, and more deeply engaged with political and ethical issues that continue to confront society today. The dissemination of a surrealist outlook is taken up by David Hopkins in his chapter on surrealism, psychedelia, and the English counterculture magazine Oz, and by Ryan Standfest, who provides a detailed account of how Breton’s conception of “black humor” was transformed into a radicalized strain of comedy in postwar America. Both Standfest and Hopkins consider the implications of the circulation and dispersal of surrealist aesthetics in the popular sphere, and how counterculture relates to the zeitgeist at large. Hopkins’s distinction between mass culture and counterculture is critical in addressing surrealism’s import between the 1960s and the 1980s—in terms both of the longevity of what Franklin Rosemont called the “surrealist critique” and of what Marcuse termed “aesthetic subversion.”22 It is with these watchwords of “critique” and “subversion” in mind that Marie Arleth Skov’s chapter on British punk in the 1970s concludes the volume. Skov contemplates not the notion of anachronistic postsurrealisms but rather polysynchronic adaptations and wandering migrations—and sometimes also pointed deviations away from— various surrealist antecedents, for fresh purposes Fig. I.5 Roberto Matta, Disciples occupez la discipline: Pour une disciof dissent.

Skov examines the influence of surrealism and other European avant-gardes upon COUM’s DIY punk aesthetic and determines that the question of homage or critique is thus not so much a case of either-or as of both-and, mirroring the dialectic relationship between subculture and mainstream. Radical Dreams offers thirteen new essays on the subject of surrealism and countercultures of resistance, and yet we hope that this volume is just one contribution to a growing area of study that embraces the notion of surrealism as a social resistance movement. This is not merely a question of chronological purview or the inclusion of post- or late surrealisms, but rather of the fundamental manner in which we comprehend surrealism as a generous continuum of cultural and political radicalism with relevance for the urgencies of the present—not a historical dead end. In that sense, we are pleased that this volume remains drastically incomplete in terms of topics covered and avenues, traced and retraced, of past and future resistance. Notes 1.

As Donald LaCoss writes: Quotes attributed to Breton and other surrealist slogans peppered the streets: “Imagination is not a gift—it must be conquered”; “To the great outrage of some, and under the watchful, less punishing eye of others, raising its wings’ weight, your freedom”; “Down with socialist realism! Long live surrealism!”; “Long Live the Surrealist Revolution!” . . . Surrealist tracts from before World War II were reprinted and re-contextualized in the flyers, pamphlets, and newspapers of the strikers, such as Artaud’s “Open Letter to the Rectors of European Universities” that was reprinted by the radicals of the March 22nd Movement. Surrealists such as Mimi Parent, Jean Benoît, and Roberto Matta were conspicuous and contributed agitational propaganda to many meetings and protest marches. In 1984, surrealist Claude Courtot—one of those most active in L’Archibras [sic]—recalled that the events of 1968 not only presented “surrealism in the streets” but also demonstrated how unexpectedly that surrealist theory and action had far exceeded what the group had imagined. “We were almost marginalized by it. We felt we had been surpassed,” Courtot explained gleefully.1\n\nThe spirit of ’68 was a powerful brew, an intoxicating mixture, an explosive cocktail composed of various ingredients. Among them were surrealism and situationism, but also the writings of Henri Lefebvre and Herbert Marcuse. What all these things have in common is revolutionary romanticism, a protest against the foundations of the modern industrial capitalist civilization, its productivism and its consumerism, and a unique combination of subjectivity, desire, and utopia—the “conceptual triangle” that, according to Luisa Passerini, defines 1968.2 Romanticism is not only a literary school of the early nineteenth century but also one of the main forms of modern cultural criticism. As a structure of feeling and a worldview, it can be found in all spheres of cultural life—literature, poetry, painting, music, religion, philosophy, political ideas, anthropology, historiography, and the social sciences.\n\nIt begins in the mid-eighteenth century with Jean-Jacques Rousseau; runs through German Frühromantik, Hölderlin, English Pre-Raphaelites, William Morris, symbolism, surrealism, and situationism; and is still with us. It can be defined as a rebellion against modern capitalist society, in the name of past or premodern social and cultural values; as a protest against the modern disenchantment of the world, the competitive individualist dissolution of human communities, and the triumph of mechanization, mercantilization, reification, quantification. Torn between its nostalgia for the past and its dreams for the future, it can take regressive forms, proposing a return to precapitalist ways of life, or revolutionary utopian ones, when the feelings for the lost paradise are invested in the hope for a new society.3 Among the authors most admired by the rebel generation of the 1960s are, next to the surrealists, four thinkers who decidedly belong to the revolutionary romantic tradition, and who tried to combine the Marxist and romantic critiques of civilization: Henri Lefebvre, Guy Debord, Herbert Marcuse, and Ernst Bloch. While the first two were popular among French rebels, the third was best known in the United States, while the last had an impact mainly in Germany. Of course, most of the youngsters who went into the streets in Berkeley, Berlin, Milan, Paris, and Mexico City never read these philosophers, but their ideas were diffused in a thousand and one ways in the flyers and slogans of the movement. In France, this applies particularly to Debord and his situationist friends—a dissident branch of surrealists—from whom the imaginary of May ’68 derived some of its most audacious dreams and most striking formulae (“Let imagination seize power!”). However, it is not the “influence” of these thinkers that explains the spirit of ’68 but the other way around: the rebel youths looked for authors who could provide ideas and arguments for their protest and desires. Between them and the movement there was, during the ’60s and early ’70s, a sort of spiritual “elective affinity”: they discovered one another and influenced one another in a process of reciprocal recognition. In his remarkable book on May ’68, Daniel Singer perfectly summarized the meaning of the “events”: “It was a total rebellion questioning not just one aspect of the existing society but both its ends and means. It was a mental revolt against the existing industrial state, both against its capitalist structure and the kind of consumer society it has created. It was coupled with a striking revulsion against anything coming from above, against centralism, authority, the hierarchical order.”4 The “great refusal” (Marcuse’s famous expression, in fact borrowed from Blanchot) of capitalist modernization, of authoritarianism and patriarchy, is one of the main “writings on the wall”—in all the meanings of this expression—of May ’68 in France, along with, probably, its equivalents in the United States, Mexico, Italy, Germany, Brazil, and elsewhere. It should be stressed that the great refusal was not motivated by any crisis of the capitalist economy: on the contrary, those were the high days of the “thirty glorious years” of 21\n\nSurrealism and Revolutionary Romanticism in May ’68\n\ncapitalist growth and prosperity. This is important to note in order to avoid falling again into the trap of expecting anticapitalist rebellions only—or mainly—as a result of more or less catastrophic downturns of the capitalist economy. There is no direct correlation between the ups and downs of the stock market and the rise and fall of anticapitalist—or revolutionary—struggles! To believe the contrary would be a regression to the sort of economist “Marxism” that predominated in the Second and Third Internationals. I will limit my comments to the French example, which I know best. If one takes, for instance, the famous flyer distributed in March ’68 by Daniel Cohn-Bendit and his friends, “Pourquoi des sociologues?” (Why sociologists?), one finds an outspoken rejection of anything that goes under the label of “modernization,” identified as “planification, rationalization and production of consumer goods according to the economic needs of organized capitalism.”5 Similar railings against industrial techno-bureaucracy, the ideology of progress and rentability, economic-scientific imperatives, and “the laws of science” are pervasive in many student documents from those days. The sociologist Alain Touraine, a critical observer of the movement, takes into account this aspect of May ’68 using Marcusian concepts: “The revolt against the ‘one-dimensionality’ of the industrial society administrated by the economical and political apparatus cannot burst out without having ‘negative’ aspects, i.e. without opposing the immediate pressure of desire to the constraints, allegedly natural, of growth and modernization.”6 To this one should add the protest against the imperialist/colonial wars and a powerful wave of sympathy—not without “romantic” illusions—with the liberation movements in the poor countries of the Third World. And, last but not least, there is, among many of the younger activists, a deep mistrust of the Soviet model, considered as an authoritarian bureaucratic system and, for some, as a variant of the same paradigm of production and consumption prevailing in the capitalist West. The romantic spirit of May ’68 is not only made of “negativity,” of rebellion against an economic, social, and political system considered inhuman, intolerable, oppressive, and philistine, of symbolic acts of protest, such as burning cars, those despised symbols of capitalist commodification and possessive individualism.7 It is also full of utopian hopes, of libertarian and surrealist daydreams, of “explosions of subjectivity” (Luisa Passerini), of what Ernst Bloch called Wunschbilder, images of desire, which are not only projected onto a possible future—an emancipated society, without alienation, reification, social or gender oppression—but immediately attempted in experiments in social practice: the revolutionary movement as collective feast, and as collective creativity in new forms of organization—the attempt to reinvent a free and egalitarian human community, the shared affirmation of one’s subjectivity (particularly among feminists), the discovery of new modes of artistic creation, from subversive and irreverent posters to poetic and ironic writings on the wall. Introductory Essays\n\n22\n\nThe vindication of the right to subjectivity (Passerini) was linked to the radical anticapitalist thrust that pervaded the spirit of May ’68. This dimension should not be underestimated: it permitted the uneasy alliance between the students, the various Marxist or libertarian “groupuscules,” the new social movements (women’s liberation), and the workers and trade unionists who organized—in spite of their bureaucratic leadership—the biggest general strike in French history. In their important book on the “new spirit of capitalism,” Luc Boltanksi and Eve Chiapello distinguish between two kinds of anticapitalist critique—each one a complex combination of emotions, subjective feelings, indignation, and theoretical analysis—that somehow came together in May ’68: first, social criticism, developed by the traditional labor movement, which denounces the exploitive nature of capitalism, the misery of the dominated classes, and the egoism of the bourgeois oligarchy that confiscates the fruits of progress; and second, artistic critique, a radical challenge to the basic values of capitalism in the name of freedom and authenticity, against a system that produces alienation, disenchantment, and oppression.8 Let us examine in more detail what Boltanksi and Chiapello mean by an “artistic critique” of capitalism: a critique of capitalist disenchantment and inauthenticity, of the misery of daily life, of the dehumanization of the world by technocracy, of authoritarian oppression. Instead of liberating the human potentialities for autonomy, self-organization, and creativity, capitalism submits all individuals to the “iron cage” of instrumental rationality and the mercantile imperatives of commodity production. The expressive forms of this critique are borrowed from the repertory of feast, play, poetry, and “liberation of speech,” while its language is inspired by Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, and surrealism. It is antimodernist insofar as it insists on disenchantment and yet modernist when it emphasizes liberation. One can find its ideas in the small artistic and political “vanguard groups” of the 1950s—such as “Socialism or Barbarism” (Cornelius Castoriadis, Claude Lefort) or situationism (Guy Debord, Raoul Vaneigem)—before it exploded in the student revolt of May ’68.9 In fact, what Boltanksi and Chiapello call “artistic” is essentially what I refer to as the “romantic” critique of capitalism. The main difference is that they attempt to explain it as a “bohemian style of life” through the feelings of artists and dandies, as best formulated in the writings of Baudelaire.10 This seems to me a much too narrow approach: what I call romantic anticapitalism is not only much older but has a much broader social background. It is rooted among artists, intellectuals, women, students, and all kinds of social groups whose lifestyles and cultures are negatively affected by the destructive process of capitalist modernization. The other problematic aspect of Boltanski and Chiapello’s otherwise outstanding and foundational work is their attempt to demonstrate that the “artistic critique,” separating 23\n\nSurrealism and Revolutionary Romanticism in May ’68\n\nitself from the social one, became integrated and co-opted (récupéré) by the new spirit of capitalism through its new style of management, based on the principles of flexibility, greater autonomy in work, more creativity, less discipline of labor, and less authoritarianism. A new social elite, often active in the ’60s and attracted to the “artistic critique,” broke with the social critique of capitalism—considered “archaic” and associated with the old Communist Left—and joined the system in managerial roles.11 There is much truth in this picture, but rather than a smooth continuity between the rebels of ’68 and the new managers, or between the desires and utopias of May and the latest capitalist ideology, I see a deep ethical and political gap (sometimes in the life of the same individuals). What has been lost in the process is not some detail but the main point: once divested of its anticapitalist content, the “artistic,” or romantic, critique of capitalism ceases to exist, loses any meaning, and becomes a mere ornament. Of course, capitalist ideology can integrate “artistic” and “romantic” elements in its discourse, but they have been emptied of any concrete social significance and perform only as advertisement. There is very little in common between the new industrial “flexibility” and the libertarian utopian dreams of ’68. To speak, as Boltanksi and Chiapello do, of “capitalisme gauchiste” is pure nonsense, a contradictio in adjecto. What, then, is the heritage of ’68 today? While I can agree with those who claim that the movement has been thoroughly defeated, that many of its participants and leaders have become conformists, and that capitalism—in its neoliberal form—emerged in the 1980s and ’90s not only as triumphant but as the only possible economic system, I would argue that we are seeing, in the past few years, the upsurge worldwide of a broad new social movement with a strong anticapitalist component. Of course, history never repeats itself, and it would be vain and absurd to expect a “new May ’68” in Paris or elsewhere: each new rebel generation has its own unique combination of desires, utopias, and subjectivity. The international mobilization against neoliberal globalization—Occupy Wall Street, the Indignados—inspired by the principle that “the world is not a commodity” is very different from the movements of the ’60s. It is far from being homogeneous: while its more moderate participants still believe in the possibility of regulating the system, a large section of the movement—well beyond its organized Marxist or libertarian components—is outspokenly anticapitalist, and in its protest we can find a combination of the romantic and Marxist critique of the capitalist order, of its social injustice and mercantile greed, reminiscent of ’68. One can already perceive not only analogies with the ’60s—the strong anti-authoritarian, or libertarian, tendency—but also some important differences: the ecological and feminist dimensions, incipient in May ’68, are now key components of the new radical culture, while the illusions about “really existing socialism” (whether Soviet, Chinese, or other) have practically disappeared.

It is realistic; that is, it demands the impossible. Members of the Paris Surrealist Group were present in many rebellious actions, but as individuals or in artworks (e.g., Jean Benoît’s effigy of a police officer during the May ’68 protests in Paris—fig. I.6) rather than as a collective. Will surrealism become a living political or cultural reference for the future emancipatory movements, as it was in the 1960s?

Squads of them, platoons of them, cops in helmets, cops in paddy wagons, cops lining the sawhorse barricades along 53rd Street, cops in plain clothes and full dress, cops by the dozen, the score, the hundred. ‘Oh my God,’ a woman with a poodle gasped. ‘What’s going to happen now?’”1 So begins the Village Voice’s description of the protest that took place at the opening preview of the exhibition Dada, Surrealism, and Their Heritage at the Museum of Modern Art on March 25, 1968 (fig. 1.1).2 The exhibition, organized by William Rubin in his new role as curator of the MoMA, instantly became a literal and figurative site of opposition. Demonstrators threw stink bombs outside the museum, taunting guests and holding signs that opposed surrealism’s institutionalization. The protesters’ malodorous objections were numerous. Their signs—“This Is a Money Circus,” “Down with Art, Up with Revolution,” and “Surrealism Means Revolution, Not Spectator Sports”—argued that Dada and surrealism were movements of the streets, not to be co-opted by—and embalmed in—the museum. But they also disputed the surrealist artists’ own commitment to revolt, pointing out the irony of surrealism’s absorption by the establishment and labeling the entire event a “Bourgeois Zoo.”\n\nThis chapter deals with the countercultural response to the institutionalization of Dada and surrealism in American museums in 1968. Despite the charged cultural atmosphere of the 1960s, which made such historical art relevant once more, Rubin, in his presentation of the work, discarded the revolutionary agendas that had been central to Dada and surrealist activity. Described in the press as a group of hippies, the protesters used the exhibition as a platform to express their dissatisfaction not only with the current state of avant-garde art but also with American politics, particularly the war in Vietnam—an effigy of Johnson was burned at the scene. The exhibition became a rallying point, opening up artistic discourse to push surrealism to the forefront of ideological debates over modern art—the role of institutions, politics, elite and popular culture—in\n\nFig. 1.1 Protest of the exhibition Dada, Surrealism, and Their Heritage at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, March 25, 1968.

Already a diffuse movement splintered by divergent styles and philosophies, surrealism offered a platform for 1960s audiences to reignite the relationship between art and culture. It is difficult to establish exactly what transpired outside MoMA during the March 25 protest, as newspaper and eyewitness accounts offer contradictory versions of the event. Between one hundred and three hundred demonstrators arrived, and a larger number of police officers prepared to greet them. Newspaper reports ascribed various levels of coherence to the demonstrators’ demands and objections. The account in the Village Voice was perhaps the most sympathetic to the activists’ cause, reporting that one young man had shouted, “We’re not here for a happening. We’re here to protest the destruction 31\n\n“Down with Art, Up with Revolution”\n\nof surrealism and the mockery made of it by that building over there [MoMA]. Dada is revolution. It stands for everything that the museum is against. For everything these rich museum-goers are against.” Noting the origins of Dada at the Cabaret Voltaire in Switzerland during World War I, some of the protesters even considered the historical irony that the “Zurich police were much more concerned about the strange goings-on at the Cabaret Voltaire than they were about the activities of the quiet, studious Russian who spent his afternoons in the library.”3 That unobtrusive Russian was of course Vladimir Lenin, who lived in an apartment only a few blocks from Dada’s birthplace and headquarters. The New York Times quoted another protester, José Arguelles, then an instructor in art history at Princeton University, who said, “We’re carrying on the spirit of dada by being here instead of in the museum. Dada and surrealism are art that’s really happening in life, not in museums. We don’t want violence, but we’re part of a spiritual and cultural revolution that’s going on all over the world.”4 For many of the demonstrators, the politics of historicization were the true stakes of the debate. Nearly all the protesters seemed to believe that institutionalizing Dada and surrealism by sequestering these movements in a museum was a way of closing off their continued relevance for artists and activists of the 1960s. Gavin Grindon has described how younger artists, like the group Black Mask, joined in the protests because they recognized that Dada and surrealism offered a platform for activist art.5 It did not help that Rubin’s approach to displaying Dada and surrealism was influenced by his stylistic understanding of modern art. But in some ways it did not matter what the exhibition actually looked like, since none of the protesters would have seen it prior to protesting. Once the exhibition was open to the public, critics immediately noted that MoMA’s presentation denied the potential for an experiential understanding of surrealism. Instead of drawing from the disruptive display techniques of previous surrealist exhibitions, Rubin took a diligent, didactic approach to his subject. (This was partly because Duchamp had declined Rubin’s suggestion that he install his own galleries, thereby rejecting the possibility of reprising the looping twine that had obscured artworks in the First Papers of Surrealism exhibition of 1942.) Each work was installed straightforwardly and arranged methodically, without reference to the surrealist exhibition practices of the 1930s and 1940s, which were designed to challenge, rather than facilitate, the audience’s capacity to view (fig. 1.2). On the one hand, conservative critics like Hilton Kramer praised Rubin for “attempt[ing] to penetrate the rhetoric, the politics, and the legends of dada and surrealism—all the extra-esthetic baggage that contribute to their beguiling mystique—in order to disclose their durable esthetic substance.”6 On the other hand, these were the very aspects that made surrealism’s concerns so widely relevant to contemporary culture.\n\nSurrealist Solidarity\n\n32\n\nFig. 1.2 Installation view of the exhibition Dada, Surrealism, and Their Heritage at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, March 27–May 12, 1968.

As Peter Bürger would later write, “art as an institution prevents the contents of works that press for radical change in society . . . from having any practical effect.”7 Philip Leider, editor at the formalist-influenced magazine Artforum, though praising the exhibition, admitted, “The surrealist ‘objects,’ for example, are embalmed in a manner corroborating the worst fears of the protesting Hippies—as befits what is deadest in surrealism. The worst of them are hardest to get to, awkwardly stuck in the far corner of a narrow mausoleum of a room.”8 While belittling the legitimacy of such a concern, Kramer also acknowledged as much, writing, “No doubt for the partisans of the surrealist movement, who continue to speak of ‘revolution’ as if it were a dinner party that still might take place,\n\n33\n\n“Down with Art, Up with Revolution”\n\nsuch artistic accomplishments do little to assuage the bitterness they feel at the perfidy of history—history, which promised so much and which has ended up as an exhibition in a museum.”9 This was indeed the major objection the protesters had raised on opening night and one they hoped the demonstration would change. When movements pertain to life and culture the way that Dada and surrealism do, another reviewer wrote, “there is an ironic significance in the fact that the boisterous, anti-esthetic, prodigal sons have now come home to rest on the great mothering breast of the Museum of Modern Art.”10 Rubin, in fact, recognized this irony as well but in reverse, noting that “there’s a further irony . . . and that is that not only is there a great deal of dada and surrealist art that really stacks up as art, despite the fact that the intention was essentially elsewhere, but that it even looks arty! . . . Arty is not the same thing as art. It means self-consciously art-like.”11 Rubin was less surprised by the establishment’s absorption of Dada and surrealism (indeed, he was actively participating in it) than by his recognition that Dada and surrealist work resembled the very idea of art that its practitioners had eschewed. Rubin also recognized that, unlike other artists, the Dadaists and surrealists were more committed to action than to objects, describing Dada and surrealism as “life movements, or philosophical movements, movements that were really more interested in poetry, psychology, politics, action on various levels, than specifically in works of art. The works of art were incidental, but after all, action disappears into history. The only thing that remains that is concrete are the works of art.”12 Even as he recognized these crucial elements of Dada and surrealism, Rubin was largely unconcerned with aestheticizing the Dadaists and surrealists’ sociopolitical efforts. A reporter in Chicago unknowingly echoed Rubin’s notion when he wrote, “The irony of the whole dada-surrealism thing is that an iconoclastic attack on the very basics of art produced several art works of lasting interest and importance.”13 While the protesters outside MoMA in 1968 could and did recognize a fraught kinship with the movement, in no small part because the cultural climate of the late 1960s—including the protests over the war in Vietnam, civil rights, workers’ rights, free speech—was deeply politicized, surrealism’s own political affiliations and involvements were hardly mentioned in the exhibition. Indeed, the protest on the street outside MoMA was more than tinged with political allegations, as the demonstrators staged a mimed drama that satirized US involvement in Vietnam: “It featured a white-fanged dragon— the war—devouring a US soldier and a player representing President Johnson counting endless piles of outsize dollars.”14 (This was just before Johnson announced that he would not be seeking reelection.) This aspect of the demonstration had little to do with the art on display, but the antiwar spirit of Dada and surrealism was very much in evidence on the street outside. Though Harold Rosenberg wrote that “Surrealist thinking is omnipresent in the thought of the [May ’68] uprising” in Paris, and one critic wrote of Dada’s\n\nSurrealist Solidarity\n\n34\n\nand surrealism’s acute “similarity [to] current doctrines expressed by Senators Robert Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy, multitudes of college students, flower children, and increasingly larger segments of the population,” surrealism’s commitment to ultraleft political views was not often mentioned.15 This was probably a residual effect of Rubin’s formalist curatorial impulse—the overt mixing of politics and art would inherently undermine any claim to art’s autonomy. The movement’s historical allegiance to Marxism would have to be buried if surrealism was to conform to the version of modern art then espoused by MoMA. Yet Rubin privately played up the museum audience’s politically engaged views in a letter to a lender to the exhibition: “I know that Picasso has an attitude full of reservation towards America, considering the politics governing our country. Perhaps he would have a more favorable attitude if you could explain to him that the direction of the exhibition is in the hands of a young person and that our audience is an audience of young people and young artists, having an idea on the war in Vietnam very different than the official politics.”16 Rubin was thirty-nine years old at the time. To another European, Rubin stressed that “the people who are organizing this exhibition, the artists for whom it will be very important, and the public which could not have seen the 1937 exhibition are all younger people whose views on most of these issues are probably much closer to Picasso’s than to that of the American Government.”17 In its popularity, particularly with this younger generation, the exhibition—even in its neutered context—was recognized as an important site of contemporary subculture. As the reviewer for Time magazine pointed out, “dada’s pranks and surrealist spectacles were revived in the 1960s as Happenings, which in turn have been commercialized by department stores, and ultimately popularized by flower children as love-ins.”18 Despite the objections of the demonstrators on opening night, Dada and surrealism were essential cultural references for the young radicals whose attendance at the exhibition nonetheless implicitly endorsed the museum’s “stabilization” (to use Bürger’s term) of Dada and surrealism as aestheticized historical movements.19 The widespread popularity of the exhibition became its own point of interest for reviewers. According to one report, “3,562 paying visitors . . . crowded into the museum for opening day, March 27. The next day the throng seemed even larger and more diversified: young, old; beat and otherwise, especially otherwise.”20 Another reviewer observed that “gallery visitors in psychedelic miniskirts, hippie unhaircuts, and what passes for an intellectual look are sometimes closer to surrealism than the art.”21 The writer recognized that surrealist attitudes might better be embodied by the younger generation that visited the exhibition than by the decades-old objects on display, though, significantly, artists like Tanguy and Magritte were represented by their older work as well as by recent paintings made in the 1950s and 1960s. Critic Max Kozloff made a common connection,\n\n35\n\n“Down with Art, Up with Revolution”\n\nwriting, “this is a skeptical, anti-mystical age, replete, moreover, with such conditions as pot, and LSD, which can furnish a poor man’s surrealism.”22 Beyond the resemblance of the new psychedelic imagery to certain surrealist paintings, the visual correlation between surrealism and the burgeoning drug culture is worth elaborating. In 1966, a special issue of Life magazine devoted to LSD featured a spread that offered a photographic illustration of a bad trip.23 The series was composed of close-up photographs of a teenage girl writhing on the floor, in some images covering her eyes or mouth with her hands or chewing on her fingers. The similarity to the photographic spread commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Charcot’s discovery of hysteria that had appeared in La révolution surréaliste in 1928 is striking. In calling hysteria the “greatest poetic discovery of the end of the 19th century,”24 the surrealists André Breton and Louis Aragon sounded very much like proponents of LSD who described the drug as “the psychic revolution of man.”25 Life magazine credited surrealism in a 1967 issue: “There is a procession of art movements reaching back 50 years that invented every major Underground idea including the obsession with visionary drugs: the dadaists, the surrealists and the Beat generation said it all. But none could have guessed at the size of the audience the Underground presently commands, the strange new turnings of ‘in group’ taste. . . . But there remains the large and growing number of young people who are simply hanging around the Underground’s permissive edges, using drugs to calm whirlwind confusions, to make the sun keep coming up.”26 Again and again, surrealism was depicted as being for the people, making it one of the very few avant-gardes to be, if not understood by, at least relevant to a cross section of an international and transgenerational public. As the exhibition traveled across the country, the tone of many reviews shifted along with the darkening cultural climate. A critic for the Los Angeles Examiner wrote, “we now live in an age of dada and surrealism. We get diagrams of acid stomachs while eating dinner and cops clouting students, photographed live. Later we go see Bonnie and Clyde’s death agonies and blood. ‘Blowing the mind’ with drugs is common.”27 Dada and surrealism seemed to anticipate a sardonic acceptance of the irrationality of contemporary culture. A reviewer in Chicago also recognized a shift in the cultural landscape: “You will find they [students of the 1960s] understand Duchamp, if anything, better than you do. . . . The angrily rebellious nonsense of dada, the impossible but seductive marvels of surrealism, and the underlying blind disquietude of both, are woven into the psychological fabric of the present day. There is something immensely appealing about them to a generation much surer of what is wrong and meaningless than what is right and meaningful.”28 By 1968, most reviewers recognized a split between the sincere, forthright art of the 1950s and a new 1960s sensibility. When Rubin’s Dada and surrealism show arrived at its final venue, the Art Institute of Chicago, in the fall of 1968, the exhibition just missed coinciding with the violence Surrealist Solidarity\n\n36\n\nthat erupted at the Democratic National Convention held in the city at the end of August. The riots at the convention, which took place at the Hilton Hotel a few blocks from the Art Institute, prompted Barnett Newman to withdraw his work from the exhibition’s Chicago iteration. Writing to the Art Institute’s director, Newman explained that the removal of his work would “express my feelings concerning the actions of Mayor Daley, feeble as this gesture may be.”29 Several reviews of Dada, Surrealism, and Their Heritage in Chicago contextualized the movements in light of the city’s recent encounter with politicized violence, invoking the historical avant-garde in a visceral way: “The heritage of Dada—and to a lesser extent the surrealist dreamers—is not just the ‘art-art’ which resulted from their ‘anti-art’ posture. It is the scream and the cry, the mobs in the street, the shouted obscenity, the long hair, and the new blue jeans dreams.”30 Another reviewer noted the parallels between the pacifists of different eras, writing that the exhibition “firmly (if unintentionally) connects the anti-war, anti-bourgeois revulsion of the summer of 1968 with similar emotions during and immediately after World War I.”31 The installation of Dada, Surrealism, and Their Heritage in Chicago also prompted local members of the Chicago Surrealist Group to organize a protest at the opening and mount a “counter-exhibition” at their own Gallery Bugs Bunny to demonstrate that surrealism was alive and well. (On display in that exhibition were works by Penelope Rosemont; the Rosemonts had also been active in distributing surrealist literature to the antiwar crowds at the convention.) The surrealist group in Chicago made a hand-lettered poster to advertise the show, in which they clarified, “Our aim is not the creation of ‘Art’ but the total liberation of man.”32 While finding fault with Rubin’s exhibition, a Chicago Tribune review of the Bugs Bunny show took issue with the organizers’ claims that Rubin used “works by surrealists of the previous generation to weaken the liberating research and revolutionary combat of surrealists here and now.”33 Instead, the reviewer saw the Bugs Bunny show as a useful addition to Rubin’s historical exhibition. The counterexhibition organized by these local surrealists was a small success, garnering press coverage and increased visibility for the group.34 Gene Swenson, the critic who had organized the MoMA demonstration, would probably have been gratified by the Chicago surrealists’ attempts to amplify surrealism’s social aims. Swenson continued to advocate for art’s political engagement in the New York Free Press: “The New York art world is sitting on a time bomb of social revolution. Rumors, reinforced by events such as the massive police demonstration at the recent opening of the Dada and Surrealism show at the Modern Museum, have been spread that America is facing a social revolution of some sort.”35 Swenson believed that institutions like MoMA should foster radical dialogue by displaying work that actively engaged social issues. Sometime in March 1968, Swenson submitted a text to MoMA, again proposing that contemporary art must engage contemporary culture: “I don’t believe art can save 37\n\n“Down with Art, Up with Revolution”\n\nFig. 1.3 Gregory Battcock, “Museum of Modern Art Hires Guards to Keep Swenson Out,” New York Free Press, February 29, 1968.

Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution.\n\nus as a nation, but I do believe that we are not producing the kind of artists we should at this supreme if agonizing moment in this nation’s history. This should be America’s golden age—and who do they call our greatest artists? Noland and Stella. . . . Well I don’t believe it.”36 For Swenson, Kenneth Noland’s and Frank Stella’s hard-edged abstraction posited art as an insular endeavor concerned purely with painterly processes. Swenson led a group calling itself “The Transformation,” which wrote a letter to Bates Lowry, MoMA’s director, informing him (somewhat disingenuously), “We wish to emphasize that this celebration will be peaceful and is in no way hostile or antagonistic to the interest of the Museum.”37 The following day, the museum received a phone call from the police inspector in the eighteenth precinct to whom “The Transformation” had applied for the permit to demonstrate. According to J. M. Chapman, who wrote an internal museum memo regarding the phone call, “Mr. Kelly [the inspector] asked our opinion of this group and stated that he would deny the permit if we opposed its issuance. I advised him we had no opposition to declare.”38 MoMA did not feel threatened by Swenson’s plans and allowed them to proceed. Swenson had already been picketing MoMA for at least a month before the protest (fig. 1.3).39 During these daily pickets (from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.), Swenson carried a large cardboard question mark to signify, as critic Gregory Battcock interpreted it, an existential uncertainty—“everything is question and in question.”40 This is why the historicization of Dada and surrealism—as the period at the end of the art-historical sentence rather than the question mark—riled so many. As John Perreault wrote in the Village Voice, “perhaps the easiest way to kill them [Dada and surrealism] off and erase the threat is to mount a huge howl of undeniable quality—in terms of individual works—but Surrealist Solidarity\n\n38\n\nwhich in its cumulative effect is ultra-conservative and seems to imply (1) that it’s all been done before, kids, so don’t waste your time with the same old song and dance; (2) dada and surrealism are only important because individual artists, often without knowing it, produced individual works of lasting importance and ‘value’; and (3) it all leads up to Abstract Expressionism anyway.”41 Perreault accused Rubin of marshaling Dada and surrealism into a proscribed narrative of art history while draining the originality from contemporary art. Rubin took Perreault’s critique to heart, writing him a lengthy letter in reply in which he described the complications of the exhibition: “These works still contain a challenge to the nature of art and of experience (as does any ‘living’ art of the past), but quite obviously the politics of the twenties and thirties are irrelevant today. . . . We live in a culture where ‘packaging’ has become, on every level of activity, more important than the thing packaged, and where the museum world has been undermined by constant concessions to show biz pizzazz; I admit to having opted for the simple expedient of choosing the best work and letting it speak directly.”42 When Rubin asserted that the politics of the 1920s and ’30s were irrelevant to 1968, he was speaking very narrowly. The surrealists’ more general Marxist principles—especially the idea of rebelling against mainstream bourgeois culture—were clearly Fig. 1.4 Illustration of William Rubin, New in play in the political climate of the 1960s. York Free Press, April 4, 1968. And Rubin’s larger point—that the packaging had become more interesting than the thing packaged—already implies a certain regret at the capitalist interests governing American culture, even as Rubin excused his decision not to enter into “an extended discussion of Communism” in either the exhibition or its catalog.43 An arresting collage of Rubin, accompanying a review in the New York Free Press, illustrates the bifurcated position in which the curator found himself (fig. 1.4).44 It shows a formal photograph of Rubin’s head combined with a drawing of his body as a besuited mermaid.45 He sits on a seashell that rests on what seems to be a hardwood floor, while the exterior of MoMA’s building recedes in the background. Rubin, though his gaze is 39\n\n“Down with Art, Up with Revolution”\n\nunfixed, stares in the direction of the museum, his sights set upon this prototypic cube, but the seriousness of his enterprise is undermined by the simplicity of the linear drawing and his own transcorporeality (from photograph to drawing and from human to fish). Rubin occupies a strange no-man’s-land; neither in the museum nor (necessarily) outside it, he is truly a fish out of water. In some ways, the collage illustrates exactly the repression of the romantic, the fantastic, and the psychological that remain submerged under the museum’s modernist façade of seemingly objective values. The image gestures to surrealist strategies, transforming the curator into a creature reminiscent of an exquisite corpse. The difficulty that Dada and surrealism presented to both the counterculture and the establishment demonstrated that unless the modern a"
