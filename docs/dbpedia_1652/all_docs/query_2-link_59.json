A member of the viola da gamba family, it features six or seven bowed strings and up to 11 sympathetic strings which are plucked. Franz Josef Haydn, an Austrian composer of the Classical period, composed around 175 works for the baryton, making him the most prolific composer for this instrument. His compositions for baryton include divertimenti, 126 trios, 25 duos and 3 concertos (sadly lost). The baryton compositions are characterized by their melodic richness, expressive qualities, and the integration of the instrument’s unique capabilities, such as the ability to play both bowed and plucked sounds. Haydn’s patron, Prince Nikolaus Esterházy, was an avid baryton player, who inspired the composer to create a significant body of work for the instrument. These compositions often showcase the baryton in combination with other instruments, creating a delightful and harmonically rich musical experience. Haydn’s baryton compositions contribute to the historical legacy of this distinctive instrument and highlight his versatility as a composer.\n\nAmy Domingues performs on the cello and viola da gamba.

To this end, Modern Musick uses period instruments and historical performance practices as a starting point allowing the musicians the freedom to make new discoveries. Modo (Latin for “just now”), the root of the word “modern” is the perfect description for cutting-edge music making of the moment.\n\nAn ensemble-in-residence at Georgetown, Modern Musick has performed a series of collaborative concerts with the Music Program and the Jesuit Community, including Music for Advent and Holy Week.\n\nFriday, November 17 at 12:30 p.m\n\nMcNeir Hall, New North Building\n\nPast Performances"
