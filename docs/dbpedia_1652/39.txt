organization overview

Measures for Justice houses a justice Index that ranks local criminal courts on factors such as recidivism, crime reduction, and collateral consequences (e.g. whether people lose jobs or homes after contact with the system.) Most important, the Index spots egregious conduct and lagging performance so citizens can demand improvement from legal professionals.
