Amy Bach has won the 2018 Charles H. Bronfman Prize, a Jewish humanitarian award, for her efforts to make data about the criminal justice system accessible to the public and policymakers.

Bach is the founder and executive director of Measures for Justice (MFJ), a nonprofit that measures the performance of the criminal justice system on a county-by-county basis. She founded the organization as a follow-up to her book, Ordinary Injustice: How America Holds Court, which won the 2010 Robert F. Kennedy book award. Echoing Green, a seed investor for entrepreneurs, chose Bach as a fellow to support the launch of MFJ.

“It means so much to the work that we’re doing and to all the people on our team who’ve worked so hard to create public data that people can use so they can see how their county’s justice system is working,” she said in a phone interview with The Times of Israel.

Measures for Justice aggregates county-level criminal justice data and uses the information to measure the performance of the county’s public safety, fair process, and fiscal responsibility. The data then becomes available to the public for free. The aim is to provide transparency and encourage discussions about local justice systems.
