It argued that the right to free speech was inadequate to produce a democratic press in an era defined by corporate media consolidation and the rise of state secrecy. Free Speech and Unfree News won the Paul Murphy Prize in Civil Liberties from the American Society for Legal History and the Ellis Hawley Prize from the Organization of American Historians (for best book on the history of politics or political economy). You can see a lecture based on this book here.\n\nA Righteous Smokescreen: Postwar America and the Politics of Cultural Globalization was published by the University of Chicago Press in 2022. Focusing on efforts to manage the international flow of culture from the 1940s to the 1970s – educational exchange programs, international cultural institutions, visa and passport policies – it shows how the U.S. sought to export its culture at the same time that it insulated its own public sphere from foreign influence. The result, the book reveals, was a lopsided flow of international culture: the world knew more about American culture than Americans knew about the world. Understanding the contradictory structures of postwar informational flows, the book shows, helps us rethink the histories of U.S. culture, foreign policy, and globalization.\n\nState of Silence: The Espionage Act and the Rise of America's Secrecy Regime, was published by Basic Books in November 2023. It is the first narrative history of this controversial law, which has been used not only to punish spies, but also to prosecute dissidents during World War One and leakers of classified information today (plus a certain ex-president). Tracing the surprising evolution of this confusing law over more than a century, the book reveals the dangers that the Espionage Act has posed, and continues to pose, to American democracy. State of Silence was named a Best Book of 2023 by The New Yorker and was a finalist for the American Bar Association’s Silver Gavel Award (given for outstanding work that fosters the American public’s understanding of the law and legal system). This event at the National Constitution Center provides a nice introduction to Lebovic’s work on the Espionage Act.\n\nArticles\n\n“Rethinking the Origins of National Security Classification,” Presidential Studies Quarterly 54, no.2 (June 2024): 259-270\n\n“Of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Correspondents,” Modern American History, 7, no.1 (March 2024): 141-146\n\n\"Introduction: Social Histories of the Security State,\" Journal of Social History, 56, no.3 (Spring 2023): 521-532\n\n\"Fake News, Lies and Other Familiar Problems,\" Knight First Amendment Institute, November 2022 (Republished in The Journal of Free Speech Law 4, no.2 (2023))\n\n“The Conservative Press and the Interwar Origins of First Amendment Lochnerism,” Law and History Review 39, no.3 (August 2021): 539-567\n\n“The Politics of Pluralism: Debating Media Diversity in Australia, c.1976,” Australian Historical Studies 51, no.4 (October 2020): 401-419\n\n“No Right to Leave the Nation: The Politics of Passport Denial and the Rise of the National Security State,” Studies in American Political Development 34, no.1 (April 2020): 170-193\n\nView Full Biography\n\nSelected Publications\n\n“Vita of Philotheos of Athos” annotated translation in Richard Greenfield and Alice-Mary Talbot Holy Men of Mount Athos: Lives of Saints of the Holy Mountain (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, forthcoming, 2014).\n\n“Women in Byzantine History in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries: Some Theoretical Considerations”, Eustratios Papaioannis, Elizabeth Fisher and Denis Sullivan eds., Festschrift in Honor of Alice-Mary Talbot (Leiden: Brill, forthcoming, 2012).\n\nThe Life of Saint Basil the Younger: Critical Edition and Annotated Translation of the Moscow Version by Denis Sullivan, Alice-Mary Talbot and Stamatina McGrath (Washington D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, forthcoming, 2012).\n\n“Monastic Onomastics” Alice Mary Talbot and Stamatina McGrath in Monastères, Images, Pouvoirs et Société à Byzance, Publications de la Sorbonne [Byzantina Sorbonensia, 23] (Paris, 2006).\n\nThe History of Leo the Deacon: Byzantine Military Expansion in the Tenth Century by Alice-Mary Talbot and Denis F.
