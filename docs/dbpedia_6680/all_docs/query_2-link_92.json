        "text": "The progress of humanity over the last few millena has been substantial. From the ancient cities of Sumer in the cradle of civilization to the present day the scale of development has been extensive. The more outstanding of these achievements have been termed 'civilization'. Since those early days when societies rallied and overcame the limitations imposed by their environment to subsequent eras when new heights were reached in diverse fields, progress always found a way. However, the fact that progress has happened and has continued to happen for so long is not something that should be taken for granted. The ruins of many forgotten cities are scattered across the planet, whether overgrown by the tropics or obscured by sand, they serve as a reminder of a perilous existence. Periodic declines of societies and empires throughout history illustrate that progress can be easily stalled and even reversed if circumstances change and there is not enough force to resist these new developments. The advance of civilization is only possible when there is enough manpower to not only maintain what was achieved but to push things forwards. This implies that civilization, which is often taken for granted, may not be as firmly entrenched. But for the sake of progress, civilization learns from its mistakes and there is a substantial body literature examining what happens when things do go wrong. One such book is Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness which examines the frailty of civilization as personified by people that try to build it. The main events of the book take place in the jungles of the Belgian Congo 1 and it is this extreme environment that throws into relief those things that would have been difficult to detect in a normal setting. Civilization and the Darkness: To understanding what defines civilization, the method is to examine how individuals coming from a civilized environment react to one that is diametrically opposite. This environment, the 'darkness', prevails in the jungle. There is also the 'heart of darkness' which prevails in the absolute depths of the jungle. The topics of interest are the actions, reactions and interactions of those that chose to come to the jungle with their surrounding environment. Regardless of their purpose they all had the same starting point, they were the products of civilization, they all came from societies that had varying degrees of structure and order. It was then left to the individual merits of those people as to how well they would fare when the atmosphere to which they were accustomed was no longer present. By looking at the actions of the different characters in the book as they are exposed to the darkness and then the heart of darkness, we can try to deduce the traits that are necessary to overcome a difficult environment and progress. The book contains several themes that are recurrent throughout. Though each of them by itself is important, extra insights can be gained by examining their interactions. The main themes of the book examine the effects of the omnipotent entity that Conrad terms 'the darkness' on those that choose to engage it, both the successes and the failures. The book is interesting in that a summary of the main conclusions of these interactions is given at the beginning 2 , while the explanation takes the rest of the book. It is only after reading the entire book that the weight of the statements at the beginning is fully 1 Joseph Conrad made a trip to the Belgian Congo in 1890.
