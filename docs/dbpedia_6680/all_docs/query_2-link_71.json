        "text": "I re-located to a regional area mid-2021 and have been working from home ever since. Here are some of my observations from the last 18 months. · A home office detached from other rooms is a necessity. Working from a bedroom, kitchen, or lounge room just doesn’t cut it. A separate area puts you more in “work” mode and is less prone to interruptions. · Speaking of interruptions, the absence of people approaching your desk as they do in an office leads to being able to focus more easily and work through issues. · However, that focus leads to longer periods at the desk and in front of a computer screen, necessitating regular short breaks. · There is no such thing as 9 to 5, with the ability to get to “work” solely dependent on your frame of mind rather than time of day. This can be both good and bad as you would expect. · The reduced time that would have been spent travelling to an office, to face to face meetings outside the office, and to city conferences/seminars/events etc, leads to greater daily productivity when working from home. · The cost savings from not paying for breakfasts, lunch, coffee, and snacks add up to more than you would think. · The cost savings of taxis, trains, and buses both to and from work and between meetings, despite perhaps being paid by your employer, are again quite high. Yes, the occasional necessary flight may eat up those cost savings. · Not being able to have quick ad hoc discussions in the office has been replaced by “are you free for a quick Zoom call”. · The familiarity with video conferencing is now such that I feel like I’m in the room with the people at the other end. · I feel like I am more connected to my family because my “work life” is not something I head off to early in the day and come home from at the end of the day. It is now intimately connected to home, despite my earlier comments about having a separate home office. Yes, I miss the repartee of work associates, the buzz of an office, the city diversity, and the odd beer after work, but the tranquillity of home, especially in regional areas, and how much more I can get through in a day, makes up for this."
