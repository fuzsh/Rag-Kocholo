        "text": "When it comes to reading this year, I owe special thanks to two special friends.\n\nGreat entrepreneur, investor and public servant Matthew Colford read over 100 books in 2019 and taught me to prioritize my time to do so in 2020. His recipe was fairly straight forward: make the commitment; fill down-time with books over social media and Netflix; maximize long flights (of which I had many).\n\nSimilarly great entrepreneur, public servant, veteran Nate Fick changed my life by getting me over my proclivity to finish every book I start no matter how lousy I found it. “How long do you think you have to live; how many books do you read a year – and do the math” he told me. This is a humbling exercise but gave me great discipline in where I spend time reading (and with whom I hang out!)\n\nI will have thus finished over 110 books this year, each one excellent and I include below by category. But if forced to pick a handful, these seven particularly stood out.\n\nGlobal Affairs\n\nBill Burns -- Back Channel\n\nAmbassador Burns served at the highest levels of foreign policy in the United States for 33 years – with five Presidents, seven Secretaries of State, in posts from The Middle East to Russia and as Deputy Secretary of State. His poignant, modest and compelling memoir is not only fascinating history but a clear call for the power of diplomacy in the great uncertainties which are the 21st Century.\n\nOn Writing\n\nRobert Caro -- Working\n\nThis beautiful, unusually short book for this author is a tour of how he prepares, researches, interviews, digs into records and writes history. It is a guide not only to his craft, but how anyone from journalists to business executives doing due diligence should think of theirs. It was so wonderfully written, that it pushed me to re-read the enormous Power Broker – the definitive biography of Robert Moses who both effectively built the New York City we know today and also destroyed many lives in the process. In fact, this would have been my favorite biography of the year, but for:\n\nBiography\n\nRon Chernow -- Grant\n\nChernow also is known for long, rich and magisterial biographies and found an enormous new audience with his biography of Hamilton which, of course, became one of the greatest plays in American theatrical history. I knew a great deal about President Grant as a General, and almost nothing as President and thereafter. This was a brilliant overview of a period in American history the ramifications from which we are still living very much today.\n\nMilitary History\n\nBernard Fall -- Hell in a Very Small Place\n\nI suspect very few people remember, let alone know, what and where Diem Bien Phu was. This decisive and impossible victory of the Vietnamese over the French colonial army is one of the most dramatic stories of military history, and set into motion every element of our entry into Vietnam and our framework for the Cold War in general. Fall – an American journalists and officer who covered this battle, advised every President subsequently, and himself was killed near Hue in 1967 – is a stunning writer and this book is not only essential history but a caution to all of us stuck in our narrative bias unwilling to understand the world from the ground on its terms.\n\nBusiness/Internet\n\nBen Horowitz -- What You Do is Who You Are\n\nI was pleased and angered to read this book in draft form. Pleased because it is a fascinating and essential read for anyone who values building culture in their business or any community. Angered because, like his first book on starting a company (Hard Things About Hard Things) I wish I had read them before I built companies. This remarkable book has powerful and surprising examples from world history, and every sentence is a teaching moment.\n\nChina\n\nYu Hua -- China in Ten Words\n\nIn preparation for an astounding three week tour of China I read nearly 30 books. Every one listed below was excellent, but forced to choose one I selected the great novelist Yu Hua’s near memoir. Each chapter is a separate word that he believes helps us to understand China. It is deeply personal, blunt and accessible and a beautiful read.\n\nComing in 2020\n\nRobert Zoellick -- America in the World\n\nWhile not out until next year, I thought I’d put a plug for the best diplomatic history of America I think ever written. I was very lucky to read this in draft and it captures all the rich detail, understanding of strategy and tactics, and unique insight that is Bob. Having served at the highest levels of the White House and State Department, and later as President of the World Bank, he weaves wonderfully his personal experience and lessons for a new world in a new century.\n\nFinally, the greatest gift a friend can give is their time and insight, and I thank the following who recommended many of the books below:\n\nHerb Allen, Herbert Allen, Sam Altman, Marc Andreessen, Grant Brooke, Bill Burns, Ben Casnocha, Duncan Clark, Lawrence Coburn, Sandy Coburn, Marsha Cohen, Hank Crumpton, Nate Fick, Fadi Ghandour, Hian Goh, David Hoffman, Ben Horowitz, Alex Lazerow, Max Levchin, Lu and Luis Leon, Sarah Heck, Jacqui Hocking, Saffron Huang, Scott Kupor, Tamer Makary, Jane Mosbacher Morris, Evan Osnos, Valentina Primo, Caroline Pugh, Noah Raford, Andrew Rowan, Ben Schroeder, Eda Sokmen, Irene Sun, Nick Taylor, Bob Zoellick\n\nAnd if I may, please share any recommendations you have!\n\nThe Rest by Category:\n\nAmerican History and Culture\n\nJonathan Abrams All the Pieces That Matter: The Wire Oral History\n\nJames A.
