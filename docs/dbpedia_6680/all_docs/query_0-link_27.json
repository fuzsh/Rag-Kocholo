        "text": "Today I thought I might share another excerpt from my two-chapter “Why Is There a Skeptical Movement?”(PDF)âthe section that comes immediately before the â‘Testable Claims’ is Not a ‘Religious Exemption’â excerpt I posted last week. (My apologies for any confusion in presenting these out of their original order.) Both excerpts are taken from the second chapter of âWhy Is There a Skeptical Movement?â I encourage anyone interested in the topic of scientific skepticismâenthusiasts and critics alikeâto consider the larger piece in its entirety if at all possible. (It’s free.) Part One delves into the long, useful, and (I think) noble tradition of scientific skepticism, tracing its development alongside the scientific mainstream in the twentieth and nineteenth centuries and beyondâall the way back to classical antiquity. This excerpt today assumes you’re familiar with the fact that serious attempts to study, investigate, and understand paranormal claims (and to rein in or expose paranormal fraud) go back a very, very long way. Today we’ll consider the context of the most important “recent” milestone on that long road: the founding in the 1970s of formal groups dedicated specifically to the pursuit of scientific skepticism as an organized public service project. (See Part One of âWhy Is There a Skeptical Movement?â for further details regarding this and earlier examples of skeptical organizing.)\n\nModern Skepticismâs Unique Mandate\n\nIf the critical study of paranormal claims extends back to antiquity, why do most skeptics consider the 1976 formation of the first successful North American skeptical organization, CSICOP [the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, since renamed CSI, or the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry] to be the âbirth of modern skepticismâ (at least for the English-speaking world)?\n\nThe difference is between the long-standing genre of individual skeptical writing, and the recognition that this scholarship collectively comprised a distinct field of study. With the creation of an organization to pursue that work (and soon the emergence of a global network of many such groups) came the accoutrements of any serious field: discussion of best practices; recognition of specialist expertise; periodicals for the publication of new research; infrastructure such as legal entities and buildings; and, eventually, even professional positions for full-time writers and researchers. Togetherâfalteringly, at first, but togetherâthese newly organized skeptics got to work on their unique mandate.\n\nTo better appreciate the dimensions of that distinct missionâthe much-discussed âscopeâ of scientific skepticismâitâs necessary to consider the other movements, organizations, and scholarly fields that already existed in North America before CSICOP was formed:\n\nThere was already an atheist movement. Although the term âNew Atheismâ dates back only to 2005, American Atheists was formed in 1963.1 Thirteen years before the formation of CSICOP, atheist activists had already overturned school prayer in the United States Supreme Courtâand of course the âFreethoughtâ movement goes back much further. German Freethinkers who flowed into the United States in the mid-1800s established groups that still exist today. (The oldest Iâm aware of is the Sauk County Freethinkers, established in 1852, whose first Speaker wrote that the means to âmental and moral freedomâ¦are not âsupernatural and incomprehensible means of grace,â but the natural and comprehensible means by which a human being influences and inspires the mind and heart of his fellowsâthrough speech, song, and the mutual exchange of opinions.â2)\n\nBeing a part of that Freethought tradition, there were of course already humanist organizations and humanist media many decades before CSICOP was formed. In fact, CSICOP was a spin-off from the venerable American Humanist Association. It was conceived at an AHA conference3 as a distinct group with a distinct mandate. Founder Paul Kurtz recalled, âCSICOP was originally founded under the auspices of the Humanist magazine, sponsored by the American Humanist Association. But the Executive Council decided immediately that it would separately incorporate and that it would pursue its own agenda.â4\n\nSimilarly, before CSICOP there were already groups and movements working to advance democratic ideals, civil rights, and feminism. There were already groups fighting for gay rights, for church-state separation, and against racial discrimination. There were already environmental groups.\n\nLikewise, science advocates already existed. There were already science popularizers. Science education and science journalism were established professional fields before CSICOP came along.\n\nCSICOP was even predated by an existing movement to promote critical thinking (a movement that still exists) known not-too-creatively as âthe critical thinking movement.â5 Since the 1970s, this educator-driven pedagogical movement has been hard at work on a project that skeptics sometimes imagine we should invent: reforming education across all grade levels to teach critical thinking skills, in order to foster a more rational society. Without any particular contact with (or need for) the skeptical movement, the critical thinking community boasts its own non-profit organizations, technical literature, and decades of annual conferences.\n\nWith all those movements doing all that work, why bother forming CSICOP? If other movements already promoted humanism, atheism, rationalism, science education and even critical thinking, what possible need could there be for organizing an additional, new movementâa movement of people called âskepticsâ?\n\nScientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal\n\nCSICOPâand with it the global network of likeminded organizations that CSICOP inspired, such as the JREF and the Skeptics Societyâwas created with the specific yet ambitious goal of filling a very large gap in scholarship. The skeptical movement sought to bring organized critical focus to the same ancient problem that isolated, outnumbered, independent voices had been struggling to address for centuries: a virtually endless number of unexamined, potentially harmful paranormal or pseudoscientific claims ignored or neglected by mainstream scientists and scholars. âThe gap means there is a danger that high-level scientific competence may not be applied in examining paranormal and fringe science claims,â explained Skeptical Inquirer Editor Kendrick Frazier in 2001. âThis is where I think CSICOP, the Skeptical Inquirer, and the skeptical movement in general come in. We help fill that gap. We are in effect a surrogate in that area for institutional science.â6 Many of the people who undertook the work of this newly organized skepticism were personally motivated by the social justice implications of this neglected gap in scholarship (shouldnât someone protect the sick from con artists?) but it was the gap itself that they organized to fix.\n\nIn 2001 Paul Kurtz recalled, âI am the culprit responsible for the founding of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. Why did I do so? Because I was dismayed in 1976 by the rising tide of belief in the paranormal and the lack of adequate scientific examinations of these claims.â7 Setting the ârising tideâ rhetoric aside (every generation of skeptic has interpreted the paranormal as posing a uniquely urgent problem in their time) the mandate at CSICOPâs inception was very clear. Organized skeptics would set aside a priori scoffing and strive to become honest brokers, actively working to learn what light the methods of science and scholarship could shine on the vast and long-established portfolio of skeptical topics.\n\nTo that end, the scope of the skeptical project was explicitly defined as the investigation of exclusively empirical claimsânot just additional opinion, not merely an attitude of doubt, and not simple sniping from the other side of the burden of proof. The first issue of North Americaâs founding skeptical periodical was unapologetic about this just-the-facts mandate.\n\nThis journal, the official organ of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, is intended to communicate scientific information about the many esoteric claims that have shown a growing influence upon the general public, educational curricula, and scientific institutions themselves. â¦ Finally, a word might be said about our exclusive concern with scientific investigation and empirical claims. The Committee takes no position regarding nonempirical or mystical claims. We accept a scientific viewpoint and will not argue for it in these pages. Those concerned with metaphysics and supernatural claims are directed to those journals of philosophy and religion dedicated to such matters.8\n\nThat same inaugural issue of the magazine that would soon be renamed the Skeptical Inquirer amplified that âthe purpose of the Committee is not to reject on a priori grounds, antecedent to inquiry, any or all claims, but rather to examine them openly, completely, objectively, and carefully.â9\n\nThink about the sheer, sustained toil this aspiration called for. After all, itâs not easy to be open-minded about every bizarre question to come down the pike, let alone to try to solve them allâand it doesnât get easier after youâve seen a thousand similar claims come to nothing. Nonetheless, although skepticism is often denigrated as a club for scoffers (even, if you will, âscofticsâ10), the goal for CSICOP was the opposite of armchair debunking. Kurtz explained in 1985:\n\nHow shall people in the scientific and academic community respond to the challenge of paranormal claims? The response should be, first and foremost, âBy scientific research.â In other words, what we need is open-minded, dispassionate, and continuing investigation of claims and hypotheses in the paranormal realm. â¦ The dogmatic refusal to entertain the possibility of the reality of anomalous phenomena has no place in the serious scientific context. The hypotheses and data must be dealt with as objectively as possible, without preconceived ideas or prejudices that would mean the death of the scientific spirit.11\n\nOrganized skepticism was thus not the place for people to talk big about their beliefs or their disbeliefs, but instead to ante up concrete evidence one way or the other. As Kurtz bluntly concluded, âproof or disproof is found by doing the hard work of scientific investigation.â After all, opinions are like noses12âeveryoneâs got one, and everyone already had one without organized skepticism. Scientific skeptics set out to discover and provide something more useful: demonstrable, verifiable facts on which the public could rely.\n\nCSIâs âfollow the evidenceâ approach (I hope I may be forgiven for hearing hits by The Who in my head when attaching the word âevidenceâ to CSICOPâs new name) became the enduring engine for an organization, which grew into a network of organizations, which grew into a movement. When I discovered skepticism (over 20 years ago) the empirical âtestable claimsâ approach had been long established as the skeptical movementâs central unifying principleâas central to skepticism as evolution is to biology.13 The Skeptics Society, for example, was from the outset committed to this scientific framework. âWith regard to its procedure of examination of all claims, the Skeptics Society adapts the scientific method,â14 affirmed the first issue of Skeptic magazine in 1992. âThe primary mission of the Skeptics Society and Skeptic magazine,â Michael Shermer emphasized elsewhere, âis the investigation of science and pseudoscience controversies, and the promotion of critical thinking. We investigate claims that are testable or examinable.â15\n\nThe sheer overwhelming practicality of concentrating on the investigable16 aspects of paranormal claimsâof investigating those things which can be investigatedâinspired a generation of skeptics like me. As Steven Novella and David Bloomberg explained in 1999, âThe position of scientific skepticism is consistent, pragmatic, and allows the skeptical movement to precisely and confidently define the focus of its mission.â17\n\nIt was also the best guarantee of skepticismâs integrity. When skepticism serves up opinion, it is just more noisy punditry. When skepticism can be counted on to deliver the demonstrable facts, it becomes, like Consumer Reports [or like Snopes.com], a useful public service.\n\nFor those interested in following these arguments in their original order, last week’s â’Testable Claims’ is Not a ‘Religious Exemption’â post follows immediately after this excerpt. Together they comprise the first two subsections from Part Two of “Why Is There a Skeptical Movement?”(PDF)."
