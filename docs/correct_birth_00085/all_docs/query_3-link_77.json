        "text": "Immanuel Kant is a German philosopher who played a big part in the knowledge of theory, ethics and the beauty and nature in life. He was born in Königsberg, east Prussia. Which is now a part of Russia, but back then was known as a part of Germany. Immanuel was a huge influence on all aspects of philosophy especially the different schooling of Kantianism and Idealism. Kantianism is the rightness or wrongness of actions that does not depend on the consequences of those actions, but on if they will fulfill our duties. Idealism is more-or-less the ideas that we hold to be true in our own minds; our interpretations of our experiences.

Kant was more specific to thought and feelings within humans while Aristotle’s thoughts were broader to every person and thing and how they work together for their own grater good. Both philosophers theories and ideas are that of those we use to base decisions off of in our every day lives. With Kant’s ideas of we do this and not that because we don’t want to feel remorse and Aristotle’s ideas of we do things for our ultimate happiness go hand in hand"
