Konigsberg was a town on the eastern sea port of Prussia it was a town dominated by a castle cathedral and the university and alone some senses it was geographically something of an outpost because it was a seaport it had a fairly rich intellectual and cultural life Kant was born into a relatively modest family his father Johan Kant was a saddle maker and his mother came from a saddle making family also. Kant never had much money, he lived very modestly. It wasn’t until his fifties, did he became a fully salaried professor and attained a moderate degree of prosperity.

But he was indebted to parties in a number was ways, because it was the family pastor who spotted his ability and helped him get in to the local Collegium where he learned Latin and a foundation to be able to go on to University in Konigsberg, where he met his tutor Martin Clarkson who was a professor of logic and metaphysics.
