        "text": "(Born: Königsberg, Germany, 22 April 1724; Died: Königsberg, Germany, 12 February 1804)\n\nKant is one of the most influential philosophers in the history of Western philosophy. His contributions to metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics have had a profound impact on almost every philosophical movement that followed him.German philosopher and founder of critical philosophy. The son of a saddler, Kant was born and educated in Königsberg (Kaliningrad) in East Prussia. After leaving the university he spent a number of years in private tutoring, but taking his master's degree in 1755, he settled to teach a variety of subjects as Privatdozent. In 1770 he was appointed to the chair of logic and metaphysics at Königsberg. It was after this that he entered on his greatest, \"critical\" period. His life was orderly to the point of caricature: he never left Königsberg, and never married.In spite of notorious difficulty of reading Kant, made worse by his penchant for scholastic systematization and obscure terminology, his place as the greatest philosopher of the latest three hundred years is well assured.\n\nBiographical references: ADB.  Buttner, Manfred and Karl Hoheisel. \"Immanuel Kant,\" Geographers Biobibliographical Studies, 4 (1980), 55-67.  DBA: I 477, 240-243; 625, 278-318.  Hamberger & Meusel, Gelehrte Teutschland, 1796-1834.  Jöcher, Gelehrten-Lexikon, Supplement.  Larkin, Robert P. and Gary L.
