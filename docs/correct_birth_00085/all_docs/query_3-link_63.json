        "text": "Reconciliation of Kant's concept of enlightenment with his concept of history requires scrutiny of Kant's definition. \"Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity.\" In other words, the important qualifier for enlightenment is not finding the truth, but searching for it. To attain enlightenment, man must simply exercise his faculty of reason without outside guidance. Also, it is noteworthy that Kant says, \"have courage to use your understanding.\" Once again, priority falls upon the simple use of reason—the means and not necessarily the ends. Therefore, enlightenment becomes an attainable characteristic for humanity throughout its entire history. One could not assume that Einstein was more enlightened than Newton because Einstein's theories seem closer to the truth. To the question of whether Kant's time is a time of increased enlightenment, Kant replies in the affirmative. However, there is no suggestion that the ideas\n\nImmanuel Kant is widely-regarded as one of the greatest thinkers and philosophers of all time, with his teachings having more influence on other contemporary thinkers than any other philosopher of the 18th century. Fighting against the governmental and monarchical constraints of the time, Kant began his work by maintaining that all humans are free beings, who out to think autonomously, free from the dictates of external authority (SEP, 2011, pp.1). Kant\n\nIn 1724, in the Prussian city of Konigsberg Immanuel Kant was born and spent most of his life at the university. Kant was recognized as a noble philosopher and scientist specializing in many areas. Kant wrote several difficult to read books, but included influential context regarding to practical morality, science, history, politics, and metaphysics. Along with many scholars and philosopher of Kant’s era the published works about nature of reality, free will. Although, the books were commended at the time, they are currently influential in terms of ethics. Kant’s most remarkable books are Groundwork in the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), Critique of Practical Reason (1788), and Metaphysics of Morals (1798) contributing to Kant’s foundation of\n\nIn the year 1724 on April 22nd in a town called Königsberg – which today is called Kaliningrad and is a part of Russia – a baby named Immanuel Kant was born. Unbeknownst to his parents was that their son would become of the great philosophers of the 17th century. Kant’s family was an artesian family. His father practiced the art of harness making and his mother was the daughter of a harness maker. Although his family wasn’t poor Kant’s family experienced some rough times. During these rough times they had to rely on his extended family. From the ages of eight through fifteen Kant attended a religious school, the Collegium Fridericianum.\n\nImmanuel Kant was a German philosopher during the enlightenment era of the late 18th century known for his best work produced ‘critique of pure reason.’ Kant was born on April 22nd 1724 in the city of Konigsberg back then known as Prussia now a part of Russia called Kaliningrad, he unfortunately passed away on February 12th 1804. Kant was brought up in a very modest lifestyle throughout his entire childhood and teenage life, his father was a saddle maker and he grew up with an extremely religious family although he himself did not have faith in any religion he did realize just how much religion had benefitted and contributed to his parents abilities to cope with all of the hardships occurring throughout their lives. Throughout his life Kant grew up with little no money but had no complaints it was not until he was 50 years old where he became a fully salaried professor and\n\nPeople may have different opinions on how differentiating what is good or bad, what is right or wrong, or how we should or not act. There are a wide variety of different ideas and philosophies, and people may adapt to what they feel more attracted to or comforted by. Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher, was one of the most significant philosophers in the history of Western Philosophy. He created the most influential deontological theory (Vaughn, 68). Kant’s theory relies in following rational and universally moral rules and following them without thinking twice. These rules are similar to our daily duties and routines; just as one do their chores without questioning one should follow the rules without questioning. The obedience\n\nImmanuel Kant was a modern day German deontologist from Prussia and became one of history’s most famous Philosophers. A deontologist is someone who believes in acts that are strictly right or wrong. Kant was an influential thinker and one of the last philosophers of the Enlightenment era. However his work in epistemology (the study of knowledge) and theology (the study of religion) are still influential to current philosophers of our time. He was also known for his beliefs in ethics and his knowledge in astronomy.\n\nHe argues that reason dominates human, each person has their own, different and elementary idea and they try to improve that idea. Kant thinks that nobody can reach absolute reality with limited thinking. Reason is not appropriate for thinking limitless. Also, he points that, human being was born with natural abilities, those abilities direct our point of view towards objects. Kant separates between a priori and a posterior\n\nDuring the 18th century, the world was just reeling from the philosophical teachings of David Hume, when Immanuel Kant—Father of Western philosophy—entered the picture. Kant’s “central question was whether metaphysics—as the science of being itself—objects as they exist fundamentally and independently of our perceptions and interpretations, is possible” (Richards 1). It is said that Kant was sent to rescue philosophy from the hands of Hume. After consulting Hume’s works, however, Kant came to the “conclusion that metaphysics was not possible, but that we humans do it anyways” (Richards 1) So if metaphysics doesn’t exist, how do we create it anyways? Did Kant save Metaphysics, or bring it to an end? For Kant, the crux of metaphysics comes down to the viability of two varying explanations of gaining knowledge—Rationalism v. Empiricism.\n\nImmanuel Kant has been among the top philosophers, the world has ever had. However, he lived a life which many people claimed was boring. In terms of habits, “Kant was very regular to an extent that people of the place where he lived used to set their watches using his afternoon walk” (Deligiorgi 5). Immanuel Kant lived towards the end of The Enlightenment era. This was a cultural movement in Europe during the 18th century. Figures of The Enlightenment such as David Hume and Voltaire aimed at replacing the superstitions and traditions of monarchy and religion with a view that depended majorly on the powers of reasoning."
