From the conference registration form:\n\nImmanuel Kant and Hull\n\nHull History Centre, East Yorkshire, 15 June 2024\n\nPresented by the Georgian Society for East Yorkshire and Friends of Kant and Königsberg, in association with Hull History Centre and University of Hull Maritime History Trust\n\nThis conference commemorates the tercentenary of the birth of the most important German philosopher, Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), and celebrates his close friendship with Joseph Green and Robert Motherby, merchants from Hull.
