        "text": "Profession: Philosopher\n\nBiography: Immanuel Kant is a central figure in modern philosophy. Kant's major contribution was to synthesize the then contrasting philosophical approaches of rationalism and empiricism.\n\nKant's most famous works are \"Critiques: the Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781, 1787), \"Critique of Practical Reason\" (1788), and \"Critique of the Power of Judgment\" (1790). At first his work received little attention but by 1788 whole journals were devoted to debating their worth.\n\nKant lived virtually his life in Königsberg where he was famous for his brilliant lectures and his strict daily routines.\n\nBorn: April 22, 1724\n\nBirthplace: Königsberg, East Prussia\n\nStar Sign: Taurus"
