        "text": "1. Life and works\n\nImmanuel Kant was born on 22 April 1724 in Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia. He was the child of poor but devout followers of Pietism, a Lutheran revival movement stressing love and good works, simplicity of worship, and individual access to God. Kant’s promise was recognized by the Pietist minister Franz Albert Schultz, and he received a free education at the Pietist gymnasium. At sixteen, Kant entered the University of Königsberg, where he studied mathematics, physics, philosophy, theology, and classical Latin literature. His leading teacher was Martin Knutzen (1713–51), who introduced him to both Wolffian philosophy and Newtonian physics, and who inspired some of Kant’s own later views and philosophical independence by his advocacy of physical influx against the pre-established harmony of Leibniz and Wolff. Kant left university in 1746, just as the major works of the anti-Wolffian Pietist philosopher Christian August Crusius were appearing. Kant’s upbringing would have made him receptive to Crusius, and thus he left university imbued with the Enlightenment aims of Wolffian philosophy but already familiar with technical criticisms of it, especially with Crusius’s critique of Wolff’s attempt to derive substantive conclusions from a single and merely formal first principle such as the logical principle of non-contradiction (see Wolff, C.).\n\nOn leaving university, Kant completed his first work, Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living Forces (1746, published 1749), an unsuccessful attempt to mediate between Cartesian and Leibnizian theories of physical forces. Kant then worked as a tutor, serving in households near Königsberg for the next eight years. When he returned to the university in 1755, however, he had several works ready for publication. The first of these was Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, a much more successful scientific work than his first in which Kant argued for the nebular hypothesis, or origin of the solar system out of a nebular mass by purely mechanical means. The book was scarcely known during Kant’s lifetime, however, so the French astronomer Pierre Laplace (1749–1827) developed his version of the nebular hypothesis (published 1796) independently, and the theory became known as the Kant-Laplace hypothesis only later. In 1755, Kant also published two Latin works, his MA thesis A brief presentation of some thoughts concerning fire, and his first philosophical work, A new elucidation of the first principles of metaphysical cognition, which earned him the right to offer lectures at the university as a Privatdozent paid directly by his students. The following year Kant published The employment in natural philosophy of metaphysics combined with geometry, of which sample I contains the physical monadology, which made him eligible for a salaried professorship, although he was not to receive one until 1770. In these years, Kant also published four essays on earthquakes and winds.\n\nKant began lecturing in the autumn of 1755, and to earn a living lectured more than twenty hours a week. His topics included logic, metaphysics, ethics, and physics, and he subsequently added physical geography, anthropology (Germany’s first lectures so entitled), pedagogy, natural right and even the theory of fortifications. Except for one small essay on optimism (1759), he did not publish again until 1762, when another burst of publications began. He then published, all in German: The False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures (1762); The Only Possible Argument in support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God and Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes into Philosophy (1763); Observations on the Beautiful and Sublime and Inquiry concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality (1764), the latter of which was his second-place entry in a competition won by Moses Mendelssohn; Dreams of a Spirit-Seer, elucidated by Dreams of Metaphysics (1766); and Concerning the Ultimate Ground of the Differentiation of Directions in Space (1768). These publications earned Kant widespread recognition in Germany. During this period, Kant was deeply struck by the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, especially by his Social Contract and the paean to freedom in Émile (both 1762). By this time Kant was also acquainted with the philosophy of David Hume, whose two Enquiries and other essays, but not A Treatise of Human Nature, were published in German as early as 1755."
