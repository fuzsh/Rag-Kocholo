        "text": "Charles Bellinger\n\nBio\n\nImmanuel Kant was born on 22 April 1724 in Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia. He was the child of poor but devout followers of Pietism, a Lutheran revival movement stressing love and good works, simplicity of worship, and individual access to God. Kants promise was recognized by the Pietist minister Franz Albert Schultz, and he received a free education at the Pietist gymnasium. At sixteen, Kant entered the University of Königsberg, where he studied mathematics, physics, philosophy, theology, and classical Latin literature.\n\nKant began lecturing in the autumn of 1755, and to earn a living lectured more than twenty hours a week. His topics included logic, metaphysics, ethics, and physics, and he subsequently added physical geography, anthropology, pedagogy, and even the theory of fortifications. In the 1760s Kant published various works such as The Only Possible Argument in support of a Demonstration of the Existence of God (1763); and Inquiry concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and Morality (1764); and Concerning the Ultimate Ground of the Differentiation of Directions in Space (1768). These publications earned Kant widespread recognition in Germany. During this period, Kant was deeply struck by the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, especially by his Social Contract (1762). By this time Kant was also acquainted with the philosophy of David Hume, whose two Enquiries and other essays, were published in German as early as 1755.\n\nHaving unsuccessfully applied for several chairs at home while declining offers elsewhere, Kant was finally appointed Professor of Logic and Metaphysics in Königsberg in 1770. Beginning in 1781, with the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant unleashed a steady torrent of books. These include: Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics, in 1783; two essays, Idea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View and What is Enlightenment? in 1784; The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals in 1785; in 1788, the Critique of Practical Reason; the Critique of Judgment; and the Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone in 1793; Towards Perpetual Peace in 1795; the Metaphysics of Morals, in 1797, and The Conflict of the Faculties in 1798, his defence of the intellectual freedom of the philosophical faculty from religious and legal censorship in the restrictive atmosphere of Prussia after Frederick the Great. Kant retired from lecturing in 1797, at the age of seventy-three. After a lifetime of hypochondria without any serious illness, Kant gradually lost his eyesight and strength and died 12 February 1804.\n\nSome key ideas from Kant's ethics\n\nDuty as following orders The Adolph Eichmann model Duty is external Duty is imposed by others\n\nDuty as freely imposing obligation on ones own self The Kantian model Duty is internal We impose duty on ourselves\n\nKant was mistrustful of inclinations as motivations This was part of his view of the physical world as causally determined\n\nSaw feelings as Unreliable Passive Phenomenal\n\n\"If I am friendly ...\" quote from MacIntyre, p. 192\n\nMaxims, according to Kant, are subjective rules that guide action.\n\nExamples of maxims Never lie to your friends. Never act in a way that would make your parents ashamed of you. Always watch out for number one. Its ok to cheat if you need to\n\nHypothetical Imperative: If you want to drive to Dallas from Fort Worth, take I 30. Structure: if then\n\nCategorical Imperativesunconditional commands that are binding on everyone at all times\n\nCategorical Imperatives:\n\nUniversality: Always act in such a way that the maxim of your action can be willed as a universal law of humanity.\n\nRespect: Always treat humanity, whether in yourself or in other people, as an end in itself and never as a mere means.\n\nPublicity: Always act in such a way that you would not be embarrassed to have your actions described on the front page of a newspaper.\n\nIs it possible to universalize a maxim that permits lying?\n\nWhat is the maxim? Its ok to cheat when you want/need to? Can this consistently be willed as a universal law? No, it undermines itself, destroying the rational expectation of trust upon which it depends\n\nKant's theory is deontological: it focuses on having the right intention; he is not concerned about consequences.\n\n\"Jesus cannot be for us a moral authority ...\" MacIntyre quote on 194-195\n\nHow do you respond to this as a Christian?\n\nCat. imperative tells us what not to do, not what we should do. MacIntyre quote 197\n\nJohn Wesley was a contemporary of Kant. He spoke of 4 main sources of thought: scripture, tradition, reason, and experience. In Kant, only reason is trustworthy; the other three sources fade into the background and are unimportant."
