        "text": "Immanuel Kant (22 April 1724 – 12 February 1804) was an idealist German philosopher. Engels criticized Kant's concept of a \"thing-in-itself\" which had no internal contradictions.[1] However, Kant's work Perpetual Peace criticized British and French slavery and shared some views with the Jacobins.[2]\n\nKant proposed philosophical dualism and tried to unite rationalism and empiricism by saying the material and ideal worlds both exist independently of each other. He said that humans can never fully understand the material world because of their subjective viewpoint and can only investigate the world in terms of quantity, quality, necessity, and other metaphysical categories.[3]"
