Immanuel Kant

Immanuel Kant was born in Königsberg and attended the city’s university. Before obtaining a paid position as a professor there, he worked for fifteen years as an unsalaried lecturer. It is said that Kant never traveled more than fifty miles from his home and that his daily routine was so carefully kept that his fellow citizens could set their clocks by when they saw him taking his midafternoon walk. Kant was so perturbed by the negative reactions to his Critique of Pure Reason that two years after its publication he sought to clarify his claims in Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Come Forward as Science.
