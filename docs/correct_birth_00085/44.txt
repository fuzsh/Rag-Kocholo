Immanuel Kant and Hull

Hull History Centre, East Yorkshire, 15 June 2024

Presented by the Georgian Society for East Yorkshire and Friends of Kant and Königsberg, in association with Hull History Centre and University of Hull Maritime History Trust

This conference commemorates the tercentenary of the birth of the most important German philosopher, Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), and celebrates his close friendship with Joseph Green and Robert Motherby, merchants from Hull. It has been said that Green’s effect on the philosopher “cannot be overestimated.” The Königsberg firm of Green and Motherby managed Kant’s finances, and Kant had a great influence on the education of Robert Motherby’s children, one of whom, William, founded The Friends of Kant in 1805.

The fee of £30 (Georgian Society for East Yorkshire and Friends of Kant and Königsberg members £25) includes all refreshments. Book early, as places limited. Please direct questions to to Susan Neave, susananeave@gmail.com.
