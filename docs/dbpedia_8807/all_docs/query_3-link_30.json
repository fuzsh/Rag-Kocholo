        "text": "Absolutely fantastic show. This is our 3rd time seeing them.\n\nSteam Powered Giraffe is unlike anything you might ever see, or imagine. It's great music, it's a stage show / performance... rather indescribably fun.\n\nThe band is friendly, kind, and grateful to their patrons.\n\nEach time we've seen them, the show has been quite different (not the same act over and over), so there's always a fun twist to the show, as well as new music.\n\nSteam Powered Giraffe - keep doing what you do !\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThis was our 2nd time seeing Steam Powered Giraffe. They're an awesome group.\n\nSeeing a live show is an altogether different experience than listening to their music.\n\nIt's really more than music...performance art, perhaps, or a mixture of comedy, costumes, music, electronics, it's the team of people onstage having a really good time.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next time I can see them in 2019...good times...\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
