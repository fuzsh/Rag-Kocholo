        "text": "If you like music, robots, and quirky, sometimes dark humor, Isabella Bennett has got everything you could ever want.\n\nOne of the founding members of the band Steam Powered Giraffe, Miss Bennett, her twin brother David, and friend Sam Luke play Rabbit, The Spine, and Hatchworth respectively — robots built in the late 1800’s who continue to perform for the masses with the help of sound technician Steve Negrete, drummer Matt Smith, and “Walter Worker” dancers Chelsea and Camille Penyak.\n\nKnown to her friends as Bunny, Miss Bennett is an icon in LGBTQA+ and steampunk culture. She is openly transgender, pansexual, and polyamorous, and often supports fans who come to her for advice regarding gender or sexuality.\n\nWhen not busy touring with the band, she often livestreams on Twitch, be it playing video games or drawing for pleasure or for the official Steam Powered Giraffe comics.\n\nWith over 6,000 tweets, Miss Bennett is very enthusiastic regarding her interests and letting fans know about what is going on in her personal life. Many tweets lead to her Instagram, where she shares her adventures.\n\nAlong with Twitter and Instagram, Miss Bennett is very active on YouTube, as well. Not only does she upload skits onto the Steam Powered Giraffe channel, but she is known for her posts on her own, as well. Clips of video game streams are common, but the most notable series is her video diary of her transition. Here, she shares her excitement, her fears, and other general thoughts about life as a transgender woman.\n\nShe, along with the rest of the band, are extremely open to interacting with fans. Besides the usual photo ops and autograph sessions, they are known to post fan art sent to them, cosplays of their characters or “fanbots”, and answer questions sent to them.\n\nThey often do live Q&A sessions on YouTube to celebrate new album releases, and even answered Yours Truly in their last one.\n\nFor one song on their most recent album, Quintessential, Miss Bennett requested that fans help out for it. The song, titled “Malfunction”, is about accepting oneself for what they are regardless of what some may see as downfalls. Fans were asked to send in videos of themselves with a sign stating what their “malfunction” is. The result is a powerful video showing not only the original message meant to be conveyed, but their true love for their fans and concern for their well-being. The band members also have cameos as themselves in the video, which serves as a stark reminder to fans that they are not alone."
