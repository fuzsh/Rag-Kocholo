        "text": "Journey Cancels U.K./Ireland Tour, Latest Legal Issues Speculated As Reason\n\nJourney has canceled its upcoming tour in the U.K. and Ireland, and some are speculating it could be tied to the new legal issues between guitarist Neal Schon and keyboardist Jonathan Cain.\n\nTicketmaster UK lists Journey’s shows as being canceled. Ultimate Classic Rock reports that fans that purchased tickets to one of the upcoming 11 concert dates received an email stating the tour has been canceled. The email reportedly states, “Due to circumstances beyond the band’s control, Journey’s UK and Ireland tour is unfortunately canceled. Refunds will be made from your point of purchase.”\n\nA reason for the sudden tour cancelation has not been disclosed, but many outlets are pointing to Schon and Cain’s lawsuit as the potential reason. As previously reported, Cain filed a lawsuit on July 30 in Delaware against Schon and Freedom 2020, Inc., the operating entity that handles Journey-related business. (Freedom 2020, Inc. is based in Delaware.) In the lawsuit, Cain accused Schon and his wife, Michaele, of overusing the business’s American Express card for personal expenses, even though the card is meant to be used for Journey business expenses.\n\nCain’s lawsuit states that he and Schon each have their own card attached to the account. While the account, itself, has a $1 million limit, Cain and Schon’s cards have limits of $30,000. However, Cain’s lawsuit alleges Schon and his wife were able to work around their $30,000 limit to access more value on the account.\n\nSchon still has yet to comment publicly on the lawsuit, which has an added touch of awkwardness since Journey is currently on tour in the United States with Def Leppard.\n\nThis is an unfortunate setback for Cain and Schon. In February, drummer Deen Castronovo told Ultimate Classic Rock that Schon and Cain’s wives were the ones to confront their husbands to work out their differences. He also shared that Journey is now being managed by Schon, Cain and their wives. Castronovo said this new arrangement is working very well.\n\n“There was a lot of turmoil in both camps and nobody was talking … Now, they’re all talking and communicating and it’s working great, ” said Castronovo.\n\nThe drummer also noted that with Schon, Cain and their wives running the business affairs of Journey, it allows the rest of the band to focus more on performing.\n\nA Brief History of Journey’s Drama Between Schon & Cain\n\nThe last few years in the Journey world have certainly not been dull, to say the least. There was the “attempted corporate coup d'état” by former drummer Steve Smith and bassist Ross Valory. There was even a lawsuit involving former singer Steve Perry.\n\nThe issues that seem to grab the most headlines involved issues between Schon and Cain. Things really started to get media attention in 2017 shortly after Journey was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Back then, Schon and Cain were having it out on social media with creative differences being the reason for the drama. Thing were so intense that even singer Arnel Pineda took to social media and wrote, “Praying LOVE will prevail in the end.. #BrothersThen #BrothersWillBeAgain #inGodsGuidance.”\n\nJourney and Politics\n\nAnother notable point of contention appeared to be Cain’s wife, televangelist Paula White-Cain, who served as the spiritual advisor for President Donald Trump. Notably, three Journey members — including Cain, Valory and Pineda — visited the White House during the Trump administration in 2017. Their visit included a photo op with then-President Trump.\n\nThis made Schon furious. He took to Facebook shortly after this White House visit and wrote, in part, “I will remain strong and consistent with the belief we’ve always shared and agreed upon – Journey should never be used and exploited by anyone, especially band members for politics or any one religion. I’ve been here since 1972, and this has always been our belief.”\n\nSince 2017, much of the drama and tension between Schon and Cain seemingly stemmed from this incident. Things got even worse in December 2022. Back then, Schon’s legal reps sent a cease-and-desist letter to Cain’s legal reps taking issue with the keyboardist performing “Don’t Stop Believin'” at a November 2022 gala event hosted at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. This event took place over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. It featured Cain performing the Journey hit and being backed up on vocals by a number of people. Among those people were Marjorie Taylor Greene, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Kari Lake.\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
