        "text": "New albums make their way to streaming services and our ‚ÄúPatreon-like‚Äù Engineer-eteer site within one year after their initial release.\n\nThis encourages fans to support the band directly by buying our newly released albums and songs at full price, rather than listening through streaming services.\n\nOur albums are available initially upon release through our official online store as CDs and digital MP3s, as well as digitally through Bandcamp and iTunes.\n\nThe band is a very small company and self publishes all of it‚Äôs albums. As such we rely on the support of our fans directly and do not go through a record producer or label of any kind. When we release a new album we put it up for sale on our website in CD form and digitally wherever we can except for streaming services or services that require albums-for-sale on their platform to be available on their streaming mediums as well.\n\nThis is due to the fact that the band makes close to nothing off of streaming services like Spotify. While these services are convenient and fan favorites, the profits generated by them are fractions of fractions of a cent and these percentages are based off of the total number of track listens by users overall within Shopify‚Äôs entire vast music library and the total amount of monthly subscription income a site like Spotify makes. Small independant artists like ourselves don‚Äôt stand a chance to rake in a decent percentage with our small but dedicated fanbase (in comparison to mainstream artists) and are unfortunately given ‚Äúvery little of the Spotify pie‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúIncome is still income‚Äù one might say, and that is true and obviously we‚Äôre grateful for any support a fan can give us, even if it‚Äôs through a streaming service, but for us even hundreds of thousands of track streams a day only equals a very small amount of income, and we certainly do not have those kind of listening numbers.\n\nThe fact is, if we released our new albums on streaming services when they initially release, a large number of folks would choose to listen to the album on Spotify and the like instead of purchasing a CD or digital copy directly from us. We are a company and like all companies we have expenses and are trying to stay afloat while creating new albums.\n\nThis is just our way, once again, of encouraging fans to support us by buying new albums from us, and it has nothing to do with us being greedy greedy mean people.\n\nAnd hey! It feels good to support small businesses! Your CD and/or digital purchase from us (or iTunes) pays the people who work for Steam Powered Giraffe, whether that‚Äôs maintaining our online presence on the social streams, packing and shipping said CDs to you, or contributing art to one of our many projects! Either way, your album purchases help someone in the band or working for the band make a living, and we think that‚Äôs pretty swell and hope you agree!\n\nWith that said, we understand that Spotify and services like it (Apple Music, Amazon, Google Play) are all here to stay.\n\nWhile they do hurt artists like ourselves in their own way, we do eventually put all of our newly released albums up on these streaming services, usually within one year after an album‚Äôs initial release. We feel this is a good trade-off for those of you who do not wish to purchase an album in CD form or digitally and only want to stream music over the internet. We get it, times are hard, some people don‚Äôt have money or just don‚Äôt ever want to spend money on entertainment.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to purchase an album from us, you can simply wait until it‚Äôs been out for awhile and then listen to it at a later date when we push it to streaming services. We apologize that you will have to wait to hear a new album if you don‚Äôt want to purchase the album, but we do release music videos throughout the year after an album is released, we share select songs with Engineer-eteers, and there are 60 second previews available on iTunes. Lots of options to tide you over we think. üôÇ\n\nStreaming services are a good way for new fans to discover the band for sure, and they are convenient, but we are trying to balance that with encouraging our fans to support us when we release a new album. So hopefully you can understand why we delay new releases to streaming sites."
