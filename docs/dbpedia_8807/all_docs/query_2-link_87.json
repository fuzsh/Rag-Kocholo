        "text": "The new album by the steampunk band Steam Powered Giraffe is out. It’s called Quintessential. It’s full of the same kind of high energy, thoughtful, playful music that has been SPG’s signature sound since their inception in 2008. Here is one of the bouncier cuts from Quintessential, called I Don’t Have a Name For It. Pause the SCIFI.radio stream while you play this.\n\nThere are so many reasons why Steam Powered Giraffe keeps coming up on the top of the pick list for geek culture music, and steampunk in particular, but one of the biggest is spirit. As alien or otherworldly as they might appear on the outside, on the inside they’re us. We think we may have figured out why.\n\nIn 1873, a man named Arthur O’Shaunessy wrote a poem simply called Ode, a piece of which ended up in a line by Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory:\n\nWe are the music makers,\n\nAnd we are the dreamers of dreams,\n\nWandering by lone sea-breakers,\n\nAnd sitting by desolate streams;\n\n—World-losers and world-forsakers,\n\nOn whom the pale moon gleams:\n\nYet we are the movers and shakers\n\nOf the world for ever, it seems.\n\nSteam Powered Giraffe not only gives us their voices. They give us ours.\n\nWebsite: http://www.SteamPoweredGiraffe.com\n\nWhere to Get It\n\n–Steam Powered Giraffe Online Store (CD and Digital)–\n\nhttps://www.spgiraffestore.com/collec…\n\n–Bandcamp (Digital)–\n\nhttps://steampoweredgiraffe.bandcamp….\n\n–iTunes (Digital)–\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/album/qui…\n\nCredits\n\nVideo shot by Chelsea Penyak and David Michael Bennett on a Black Magic URSA Mini\n\nEdited by David Michael Bennett\n\nStarring-\n\nThe Spine: David Michael Bennett\n\nHatchworth: Samuel Luke\n\nRabbit: Isabella Bunny Bennett\n\nWalter Worker Camille: Camille Penyak\n\nWalter Worker Chelsea: Chelsea Penyak\n\nI Don’t Have a Name For It by Steam Powered Giraffe\n\nWritten and performed by David Michael Bennett\n\nAdditional vocals by Isabella “Bunny” Bennett and Samuel Luke\n\nCopyright 2016 Steam Powered Giraffe LLC.\n\nLyrics\n\nWell it’s the way she smiles and the way I swoon\n\nwhen she winks at me from across the room\n\nIt’s the way she laughs and they way she cries\n\nIt’s the way her hand fits perfectly in mine\n\nWell I don’t have name for it,\n\nbeen trying to find a name for it,\n\nI don’t think there’s a name for it,\n\nbut it’s kinda like being in love\n\nWell it’s the way she makes me feel inside\n\nlike I’m not like the rest or any other guy\n\nIt’s the way we talk and the way we sing\n\nabout the universe and every little thing\n\nWell I don’t have name for it,\n\nbeen trying to find a name for it,\n\nI don’t think there’s a name for it,\n\nbut it’s kinda like being in love\n\nAll – I’m – say-ing is what my\n\nHeart – is – play-ing on its\n\nStrings – so – loud -ly its\n\nfeelings – de-clared- proudly\n\nThis – feeling – is – staying because my\n\nHeart – is – blaze-ing it’s on\n\nFire – and – won’t – go out\n\nIt won’t go out\n\nWell it’s the way she can twirl on the face of a dime\n\nand the way she’s always there like my partner in crime\n\nIt’s the curl of her hair and the gleam of her eyes\n\nand the heart in her chest that beats in rhythm with mine\n\nWell I don’t have name for it,\n\nbeen trying to find a name for it,\n\nI don’t think there’s a name for it,\n\nbut it’s kind of like being\n\nIn love\n\n-30-"
