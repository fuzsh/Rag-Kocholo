        "text": "San Diego\n\nMore than a band. More than a show. Step into the world of Steam Powered Giraffe! The quirky act combines comedic sketches, improvised banter, and original music fused with harmonies and robot pantomime. Steam Powered Giraffe is a musical project from San Diego, California. It was formed in 2008 by twin siblings David Michael Bennett and Isabella Bunny Bennett. Together, along with a cast and crew filled with theatrical backgrounds, the group takes on the guise of singing antique automatons and the fictional robotics company that made them. From their heartwarming nostalgic melodies to their funky cabaret rock, Steam Powered Giraffeâs songs are memorable, infectious, and as unique as the robots themselves. More than just a band, Steam Powered Giraffe is an experience that must be seen and heard by the entire family.
