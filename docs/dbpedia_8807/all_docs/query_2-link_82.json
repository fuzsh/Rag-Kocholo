The first Steamworld Heist is probably a Top 5 Indie game on Switch for me. I really enjoyed it.\n\nVintoWin\n\nLike Like\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#5\n\nEh, would have preferred Steamworld Dig 3.\n\nYeah exactly. I loved Dig 1 and 2....\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#6\n\nDig 3 is obviously coming at some point.\n\nI really enjoyed Heist so am looking forward to this.\n\ninfinitywave\n\nCappy\n\nPronouns\n\nhe / him\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#7\n\nI needed this. With Steam Powered Giraffe. So happy!\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#8\n\nCool. Still got some time to decide whether to play the first on my 3DS, Wii U or Switch copy until then!\n\nAlthough I never noticed before how these robots are too lanky-legged for my complete comfort.\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#10\n\nHeist is probably my favorite Steamworld title (though I haven't played Quest) so super down for this\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#11\n\nCant describe how happy I am about this.\n\nPeak Image & Form (together with Dig 2)\n\nI had a hunch about there being a new Steamworld game coming the last few days, they've been very talkative about the franchise on twitter as of late and heck and even liked my weird tweet the other day\n\nEnpsty\n\nLike Like\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#12\n\nFirst game was 10/10. If this matches the quality we have a potential goty.\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#13\n\nReally great announcement! Hope it stays around the same play length as the other Steamworld games.\n\nJahranimo\n\nBacklog Hunter\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#14\n\nDig 2 is my fav but Heist is right up there. Really good quality strategy game that even feels fun for people like me who aren't super into strategy lol.\n\nSuper cool announcement!\n\nDizzle\n\nLike Like\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#16\n\nFUCK YES\n\nSo what I understand is that this is a Worms-like?\n\nA little bit. More tactical, like 2D X-Com.\n\nJahranimo\n\nBacklog Hunter\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#17\n\nFUCK YES\n\nA little bit. More tactical, like 2D X-Com.\n\n2D X-Com is the perfect way to describe it\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#18\n\nI really liked the first one, and it's very friendly to newcomers of the genre. Cool they also added an explorable map\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#19\n\nI remember really enjoying the original. Even though its not a Dig game, I'll probably pick it up.\n\ndarthdiablo\n\n+5 Death Stare\n\nPronouns\n\nhe/him\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#20\n\n2D X-Com is the perfect way to describe it\n\nKind of, if we could actually move our aiming crosshair around in XCom too.\n\nBut since I remember missing even though I'm standing next to target (just like missing 99% chance in XCom), I guess they share that same trait lol.\n\nEarthbounder\n\nBoing!\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#21\n\nJust watched the trailer.\n\nThis looks so good, y'all. I'm happy.\n\nrobjoh\n\nRattata\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#22\n\nI will have to finish the first one, but will most likely pick it up. Have all the steamworld games expect the \"city builder\" which name I cannot remember.\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#23\n\nFWIW, seems like Steam Powered Giraffe didn't make the full sound track this time, just selected tracks.

Cool that Steam Powered Giraffe is involved again as well.\n\nDizzle\n\nLike Like\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#25\n\nKind of, if we could actually move our aiming crosshair around in XCom too.\n\nBut since I remember missing even though I'm standing next to target (just like missing 99% chance in XCom), I guess they share that same trait lol.\n\n2D Valkyria Chronicles without the Capture the Flag aspect or the tanks?\n\ndarthdiablo\n\n+5 Death Stare\n\nPronouns\n\nhe/him\n\nApr 17, 2024\n\n#26\n\n2D Valkyria Chronicles without the Capture the Flag aspect or the tanks?\n\nYeah I think that's a more apt comparison. Except often in Heist, you can have bullets bounce off walls (richoet), so sometimes it's like I'm playing a game of billards, lol. Find an awkward angle for that chance of a headshot.\n\ninfinitywave\n\nCappy\n\nPronouns\n\nhe / him\n\nApr 18, 2024\n\n#27\n\nFWIW, seems like Steam Powered Giraffe didn't make the full sound track this time, just selected tracks. (The trailer says: \"Featuring music by Steam Powered Giraffe\".)\n\nThey've made 15 original songs for the game. There'd be title and end music, they play on radios and at venues where you see the band actually playing, as well as some after special battles, but like the first Heist the ambient background music is made in-house.\n\nApr 18, 2024\n\n#28\n\nThose comparisons aren't right. Let me. I know how to sell a game:\n\nIt's Code Name S.T.E.A.M. where every character is Tin Man.\n\nApr 19, 2024\n\n#29\n\nI really loved playing the first game on 3DS all those years ago, so I’m ecstatic to see a sequel finally happening! Cool that Steam Powered Giraffe is involved again as well.\n\nHow times has changed since then.
