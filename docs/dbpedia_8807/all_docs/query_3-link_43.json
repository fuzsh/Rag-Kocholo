        "text": "SteamWorld Dig developer Image and Form has shared some exciting steampunk news today for fans of the upcoming robot-driven game, SteamWorld Heist. Confirmed through the developer’s official blog, original music from the San-Diego formed band Steam Powered Giraffe will feature within the turn-based survival game. The quirky three-piece will not only be working on the in-game music and soundtrack, but will also crop up within the game as characters too.\n\nYou can see a sneak peek of SteamWorld Heist gameplay, along with the “Prepare for Boarding” song featuring the band, in the video embedded above. SteamWorld Heist is still on track for a Spring 2015 release on both Wii U and 3DS. Lead band member David Michael “The Spine” Bennett said on behalf of the collaboration:\n\n“When asked if we would like to collaborate with Image and Form on their next SteamWorld game we immediately said yes! We loved SteamWorld Dig, and a steam powered robot band making music for a steam powered robot game? Count us in! We thought it was a match made in heaven and we’ve always wanted to try our hand at making music for one of our favorite pastimes, video games!”"
