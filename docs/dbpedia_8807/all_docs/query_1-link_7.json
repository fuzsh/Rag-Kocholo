        "text": "“My name's Zero! I was built with a childlike imagination. And military-grade weapons!” - Zero, introducing himself\n\nZero, also known as Zer0 or Prototype-0, is a musical automaton built by Peter Walter I in 1896, cobbled together out of three of Walter's unfinished warbots. He is the newest robot member of Steam Powered Giraffe.\n\nHe is portrayed by Bryan Barbarin.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nZero is a stocky automaton colored primarily in gold, patched with spots of silver. His eyes are outlined in a figure-eight shape, connecting to the outside of his eyebrows, with a gap between the brows. There are silver plates bolted in three place: to his forehead (above his right eye), with the other two at the back corners of his jaw (near the earlobe). His neck is also coloured in silver.\n\nHe has dark curly hair, usually worn in locs, or an afro, sometimes with shaved sides that show silvery metal beneath. He also keeps a full beard that follows the line of his jaw. In older appearances, there is a white streak in his beard.\n\nHe wears baggy black pants with a red belt and red suspenders, and an asymmetrical long-sleeved black button-up shirt with red highlights. His right sleeve is layered into ten segments, eight black and two red (his cuff, and another layer on his forearm). On his left shoulder is a double-layered cover over his suspenders, vertically striped in black with a red hem on each layer. His collar is also red. He wears black shoes, and fingerless gloves; his right glove is black and his left glove is red.\n\nOn the outside of his collar, he wears large dulled metal chain links as a necklace. A small glowing blue orb dangles from the center of the chain as a pendant.\n\nPersonality and Traits[]\n\nZero is the most innocent or childlike of the Steam Powered Giraffe robots, approaching most things with an optimistic, sometimes naïve attitude. This is exemplified by how he invested all of his life savings into the abstract concept of love.[1]\n\nPhysically, he is extremely strong and resilient, likely due to being an amalgamation of multiple incomplete robots' spare parts.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPrototype-0, as he was originally named, was created as the final member of Peter Walter I's robot army, recycled into a fusion of three other incomplete robots. He was exceptionally powerful in combat, but unlike some of the other automatons, he was not initially built to perform music. Thus, he was relegated to the basement of Walter Manor, his Blue Matter core powering the subterranean workshop for almost a century.\n\nIn 1992, Beebop serendipitously discovered the robot, powering him on and eventually befriending him. Together, they enjoyed watching old films and listening to records found archived within the building. Zero became fascinated with Motown music, and thus he took up singing. In 2008, his beautiful voice was heard by Peter Walter V while he was testing the workshop elevator; Peter V immediately decided that he would rebuild Zero so that he could become an entertainer.\n\nZero soon joined Steam Powered Giraffe and skyrocketed to fame. In 2012, he left in order to pursue his solo career. Walter Robotics lost the right to use Zero's likeness, and he had to be edited out of all SPG material.\n\nHis solo career was immensely successful; he even had his own reality television show, and merchandise. He reached millionaire status, but lost all of his savings after attempting to invest all of his money in love (the emotion). In a last-ditch effort to monetize his fame, he released an autobiography in 2015, but it only sold a single copy.\n\nWithout anything left but his yacht “Floaty Time”, Zero returned to Walter Manor, dragging his yacht behind him along the streets. Hatchworth saw his return as an opportunity to leave the band and pursue gold-fishing, with Zero taking his place in the Steam Powered Giraffe lineup in 2017.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nRabbit and The Spine[]\n\nAs fellow automatons and band members, Zero, Rabbit, and The Spine have a sibling-like relationship, where they're friendly with one another at times, and argumentative at others. More frequently, Zero and Rabbit will team up to antagonise The Spine, but occasionally Rabbit will also act as a mediator for the others.\n\nBeebop[]\n\nZero's oldest friend is Beebop, who was his only companion for many years when he was stuck in the disused Walter Manor workshop. Beebop often plays favorites with Zero at concerts; disparaging the other Steam Powered Giraffe robots for their frequent malfunctions, but when asked about Zero's technical issues, only comments \"Actually, I like Zero\".[2]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nZero had his own reality television show, called Zero's House. His catchphrase on the show was “WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?!”. The show's airing times were very difficult to decipher, such as only showing on leap years.\n\nZero had his own breakfast cereal known as “Zer-e-Os”.\n\nZero's hair may be inflatable.[3]\n\nGallery[]"
