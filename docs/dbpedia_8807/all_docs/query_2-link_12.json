        "text": "Steam Powered Giraffe is a pantomime musical group based in San Diego, CA. Members include David Bennett (The Spine) and Christopher \"Bunny\" Bennett (Rabbit), and as of October 2012, Sam Luke–former human and drummer–filled the spot as third bot (Hatchworth) upon Jon Sprague's departure from the band.\n\nThe robots are also assisted by the following humans: backup musician Michael Reed, sound engineer Steve Negrete, and new drummer Matt Smith. Their music consists of layered harmonies over guitar normally, and often included as well are melodica, mandolin, and accordion.\n\nBetween sets are improvisational, vaudevillian skits which are very much a product of their roots in street performance. Though it wasn't planned upon the creation of the group, they have gained popularity within steampunk community.\n\nMuch of their appeal is drawn from custom clothing unique to each character, metallic face paint, and pantomime robotic movements paired with humor only 117 year old robots can harbor. They strive to be a performance group that all ages are able to enjoy.\n\nAt the moment, they have two studio albums, a live album, and are working on their third album while juggling time between recording and touring. - In January 2011, Erin Burke (Upgrade) left Steam Powered Giraffe to further pursue an acting career.\n\n- In September 2012, Jonathan Sprague (The Jon) was let go from the group."
