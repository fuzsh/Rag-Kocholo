        "text": "Howdy musical automaton enthusiasts!\n\nAfter wrapping up our last live show of the year in Bakersfield, California this past weekend, the band sees 2016 come to a close. We had a thoroughly enjoyable year full of concerts, conventions, music videos, and even a new album release. Our fans have truly humbled us this year, and we love seeing familiar faces, meeting new fans at our shows, and of course are always thankful for the love and support sent to us through email, fan mail, and our social streams!\n\nNow that our last show for the year is over, we feel the time is right to make a very big announcement for 2017.\n\nSamuel Luke, who plays the beloved mustachioed robot “Hatchworth,” is departing the band to pursue his own artistic endeavors. Sam approached the band a while ago about wanting to focus on his own personal art projects, but he wanted to stay on as a member until a suitable replacement for him could be found.\n\nSam joined the band in 2011 as a drummer to work with the band as they performed at the San Diego Zoo from 2011 to 2012; after which he became a lead robot performer after Jon Sprague’s departure in 2012. It’s been a fantastic ride with Sam and we’ve accomplished much together in the last six years.\n\nIt has taken quite a lot of time, but Isabella Bennett (Rabbit), David Bennett (The Spine), and Samuel Luke (Hatchworth) have found a replacement and have been training him for his debut.\n\nPlease welcome Mr. Bryan Barbarin and his robot character “Zero” to Steam Powered Giraffe!\n\nBryan is a friend of the Bennetts from their college days, well versed in musical theater, mime, acting, and a plethora of other talents. He even has his own band called ‘The Routine’ that he sings lead vocals in (http://www.theroutineband.com/#theroutine).\n\nIsabella, David, and Bryan had an improv troupe in college together, performed in college theater productions, and did a touring children’s show under the direction of Jerry Hager (Kazoo the Mime of Seaport Village fame). Now Bryan joins the Bennetts on stage as the robot Zero, alongside ballet dancers/Walter Workers Chelsea and Camille Penyak, and the band’s sound engineer Steve Negrete.\n\nSam’s departure is bittersweet for the band and many fans. No one can replace what he brought to the act with his character Hatchworth, but of course we wish him well in his artistic endeavors! There is an excitement in the air having a new performer on stage, and we’re sure you’ll fall in love with Bryan, Zero, and the next iteration of the act as we continue into the new year.\n\nHowever, we have a special holiday present for you to hint at things to come, and to wrap up 2016: A brand new song and music video featuring the newest member of Steam Powered Giraffe, Bryan Barbarin as Zero the robot!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hltEVBnakxs\n\nIt’s our cover of the song “A Marshmallow World,” and it’s just in time for the winter holidays. The music video features Zero, The Spine, Rabbit, and the Walter Workers Chelsea and Camille.\n\nAlong with the music video, we have a brand new episode our podcast “The Bennettarium” scheduled this week that features David (The Spine), Isabella (Rabbit), Sam (Hatchworth), and Bryan (Zero)! That’s right! All of the robots together for one special podcast! We will be recording and livestreaming this episode of the podcast to Engineer-eteers this Tuesday (December 20th) at 3:00pm PST. http://steampoweredgiraffe.com/engineers\n\nThe podcast episode will go live that evening for everyone else to listen to for free after the stream. We hope you’ll tune in to send Sam off and welcome Bryan on board!\n\nWe would also like to take this time to announce Zero’s first live performance with Steam Powered Giraffe!\n\nSaturday February 18th 2017 at the The Center Theater at The California Center for the Arts in Escondido, California: http://artcenter.org/event/steam-powered-giraffe\n\nWe’ve got plenty of shows lined up after that around the United States (and abroad perhaps? Fingers crossed), and we can’t wait to share the new act with you all!"
