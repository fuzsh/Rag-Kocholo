        "text": "Steam Powered Giraffe\n\nFeaturing identical twin-siblings Michael and Isabella Bennett (who, in 2014, confirmed her gender as female) in a trio with Samuel Luke, Steam Powered Giraffe (SPG) performs as a steampunk act where each member is a fictional \"robot,\" named Spine, Rabbit, and Hatchworth, respectively. SPG draws primarily from late 19th century folk with modern rock and electronic influences, and has also gained prominence for styled covers of pop songs such as \"Diamond,\" \"I Love It,\" and \"Harder Better Faster Stronger.\""
