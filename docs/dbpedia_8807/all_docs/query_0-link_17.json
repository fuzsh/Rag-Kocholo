Chocolate or vanilla? We've got anything you'd want and a fountain of sarsaparilla Welcome board the S. S. Biscuiteer Feel free to chime in with music that you hear 'Cause this here steamboat runs off a catchy tune so if everybody sings along we might make it to the moon Music so hot and loud burns through the deck riles up the crowd Check your watches at the door Bring your smiles for what's in store The dancing is free Steamboat Shenanigans Steamboat Shenanigans The smoke stacks up high are billowing clouds to the sky While we all partake in those Steamboat Shenanigans Nanigans, nanigans, Nanigans Oh, Steamboat Shenanigans One, two, three Steamboat Shenanigans Take a trip with me The river below stretches on for miles and this here's one steamboat trip that'll make you smile Steamboat Shenanigans Steamboat Shenanigans The band that you hear was built from metal and gears and we all partake in those Steamboat Shenanigans It's raining down on us The skies are grey but we don't fuss The cold is bringing them down but if we start a song and all sing along we might break the sun through the rain Come on and celebrate Music so hot and loud burns through the deck riles up the crowd Check your watches at the door Bring your smiles for what's in store The dancing is free The music was Burning, burning La Da Dada Da Da Burning, burning La Da Dada Da Da Burning, burning La Da Dada Da Da Burning, burning La Da Dada Da Da Steamboat Shenanigans Steamboat Shenanigans The smoke stacks up high are billowing clouds to the sky While we all partake in those -can't get away from those -I wanna stay with those Steambo- Ho-Hoat Shenanigans Nanigans, nanigans, Nanigans Nanigans, nanigans, Nanigans, nanigans, Nanigans, Nana-nana-nana-nana-nanigans\n\n2.\n\nOne-Way Ticket 03:44\n\nWell lets get packin'. Get back on track in the lovely morning sun We've got a song in our heart and a dream in our heads Hearts in our heads, and dreams of a song We'll Sing it all day long. C'mon now board that train with me I've got a one-way ticket to destiny A one-way road to my future. And a two-way love with a special girl she's gonna be right back right back in my arms That road is long, You can't Go wrong, With blue skies up above We've got the sun in our face and the wind in our wheels Smile for the day and Sail to the stars Make a wish and see. C'mon now board that train with me I've got a one-way ticket to destiny A one-way road to my future And an intersection that will seal my fate As a man so happy Happy to be free As we roll along with This train ride song You know we'll meet lots of friends Like the cowboy who's a samurai Boy, what a combo, Holy cow what a guy The conductor plays the bass And the train it has a face Stormy days are around the bend. No wrenches, water, or outlets Roll across a sea of burning oil As mechanical sea serpents swarm around the train Under a cloud that won't stop crying Raining down on a mountain what spits fire The sky and ground used to love so well So we play them a song, And we right their wrongs, And everybody gets along We've got a one-way ticket to destiny A one-way road to our future And a two-way love that we know so well 'Cause that is all you need to live A One-way ticket to destiny A One-way road to our future And a two-way love that we know so well 'Cause that is all we need to live A One-way ticket to destiny A One-way road to our future And a two-way love that we know so well 'Cause that is all you need to live That is all you need to live Love is all you need to live Love is all you need to live\n\n3.\n\nJu Ju Magic 03:07\n\nFloatin' down aimlessly.

He had biggest red suspenders I ever did see, golly gee that's what I've seen He flicked the brim of his hat, and this is what he said to me. \"Mister robut ah am The Suspender Man And dis banjo 'as shown me dah promised land. Now ah play a song but in return, yoo put dat shiny coin right 'ere in mah urn. And ah play yoo sumfin fine. Mah music gonna blow yo mind!\" So I flicked my coin into his pot, I gotta admit it twasn't a lot Two cents and then his fingers wriggled, he plucked those strings and belched a giggle. He tapped his foot, howled like a hound Igniting up the unholy sound. And I ain't never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, heard anything so great. Call the vendors. Big Suspenders. That's what everybody wants to wear. They stretch to Nantucket. Put them in a bucket And send them to the gnome trapped down the well (Tug 'em with thumbs is ideal) (While rollin' back on your heels) (Yeah) He played the two cent show And just like that he stopped playing My jaw dropped to the floor. He cracked his neck and smiled at me, And said, \"Buddy, y'gotta pay for more!\" But by then a crowd had swarmed the swamp, tossin' coin in after coin. So he cleared his throat, and his fingers writhed, and everyone shouted for Suspender Guy. Call the vendors Big Suspenders That's what grandma wants for her birthday They're bright red and awesome Even worn by opossums Nobody wants their pants to fall down (Ma and Pappy want 'em too) (Even the ghost of your Uncle Stu) (Yeah) He played the two cent show Fracture dat banjo! All the children sing and dance Those banjo sounds instill a trance By 4 AM the press what hot Suspender Man on the front page spot Suspenders were in and spats were out The girls all suffered from fainting bouts The banjos flew off the shelves Sprouting wings with dreams of being played by Suspender Man. But in the middle of February the fog turned a crimson red The Suspender Man disappeared, everyone was heels over head But we found his suspenders and that old banjo sittin' right there on his log And though he's gone, that's what he gets for selling his soul to the bog Big Suspenders Put them in a blender Three bat teeth and a blackened demon eye Bring it to a boil Release your mortal coil Out pops a belt to wear for you and me- Nobody wants their pants to fall down- You could wear a dress and then...you'd have no need (The alligators had it right) (Wearing pants it sure does bite) (Yeah) He played the two cent show\n\n13.\n\n(Ahhs) A man takes off from an airfield and he's a'soaring very far from home 'cause he flies a B-17 straight through the sky He's homesick and he knows it'll be a long time till he's done and he's got a beautiful girl waiting at home He opens up a letter from her. She writes, here's a color picture of me (a pretty picture) Just head towards my blue eyes, when you're finding your way back to me Well, That'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll That'll be the way home Yes, That'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll That'll be the way home Straight through the sky headed towards her blue eyes A lieutenant of the Navy took his very first steps today Onto the ship that would become his new home He and his wife had shared a very special goodbye when they kissed in the night underneath a star of their own As the lieutenant gazed up and saw their star shining bright (oh so bright) He knew it would guide him home when the time was right Well, That'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll That'll be the way home Yes, That'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll That'll be the way home Starin' into the night Keeping their star in sight All you infantry men and you riveting gals don't ever need to give up hope all you doctors, and nurses, and engineers need not worry for long If we all look towards what we miss most and keep that drive in our heart Well, That'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll That'll be the way home Yes, That'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll that'll That'll be the way home\n\n14.\n\nThe Ballad Of Lily 01:42\n\nSome girls say all they need is dreaming But some girls say they ain't got time But for those who dream Well they just keep dreaming We've got to chase the dream to be happy Do you wanna sail into the sky? Soar across the stars? Well, I knew a girl, and her name was Lily But her Daddy called her something rather silly He called her by a name which matched her art Come on and fly with me, fly with me, my little Airheart\n\n15.\n\nAirheart 05:14\n\nHer father fought in the great war In an aeroplane named Bree He gave his love to a pretty girl And said, \"Baby you're the one for me\" And though her name was Bree, He still found it all a shock When he found out she was an airplane, The stork began to knock A baby girl was born With air rudders on her back She picked up airwave frequencies And petrol was her favorite snack Whale she bubbled noises like an airplane Every time she sang And her heart it loved so hungrily, And roared like a Mustang That's why they called her Airheart Airheart That girl was meant to fly So prep the runway Airheart Airheart That girl will soar away She was an angel in her blue dress When Little Jimmy Wright took her to prom The young pilot said he loved her, And oil began to clam her palm Whale he was lost in the sky And they said he had died, But I know something more They only found Jimmy's goggles, In his plane upon the floor Well years went by And she still looked to the sky, Her feelings did not disperse She could fly any plane just like an ace And kept goggles in her purse And she swore she still heard Jimmy singing, \"That'll Be the Way Home\" It would haunt her from her radio In each sky that she would roam Jimmy's voice echoed Airheart Airheart I'm sorry that I flew away But just remember Airheart Airheart Keep flapping and you'll soar one day Lets Fly! Do you wanna sail into the sky? Soar across the stars? Sail into the sky? Soar across the stars? Sail into the sky? Soar across the stars? The stars? The stars?! The stars! Then one fateful day Ended with a storm streaked sky Her plane crashed into the mountain side, Was she flying much too high? They only found Jimmy's goggles In her plane upon the floor I hope she's up there somewhere with him Kissing on a cloudy shore The birds were singing Airheart Airheart That girl was meant to fly So prep the runway Airheart Airheart That girl will soar one day Air-air ha ah art Air-air ha ah art Air-air ha ah art Air-air ha ah art Air-air ha ah art Air-air ha ah art Air-air ha ah art Airheart!\n\n16.\n\nCircuitry 02:24"
