        "text": "It was a story that didn’t get much notice over the past couple of days, but Ozzie, the only giraffe in the state of Nevada has passed away!\n\nOzzie had found a home at the Lion Habitat in Henderson and according to a report at Channel 3, the beloved animal had passed away. According to the report, the giraffe had fallen a few days earlier sustaining injuries and just never recovered.\n\nOzzie, The Only Giraffe In Nevada Passes Away\n\nOzzie had arrived in Las Vegas at only 8 months of age and standing only 8 feet tall. He was living in Kansas before the big moved to Las Vegas. Soon, the giraffe became some what of an artist while thriving in Southern Nevada.\n\nWith a brush handle held sturdy in his mouth, he would stroke the canvas creating some unique paintings for all to enjoy! In fact, if you view the Lion Habitat website and their tribute to Ozzie, it says that the animal would give four painting demonstrations a day to fans who stopped in to visit.\n\nAnd if that wasn’t enough, Ozzie had his own line of clothing! “Jungle Wear” by Ozzie was created when he started painting hats, t-shirts and more. All said and done, this was one talented giraffe!\n\nNot too mention, this animal had a heck of an appetite…and you can imagine. Growing from 8 feet at 8 months, to 17 feet by the time he turned 10 years old this past March.\n\nHe would eat up to 20 hours a day at times…maybe taking a break when the “painting” bug hit him! Ozzie was one heck of an interesting animal and unique creature that everyone loved.\n\nAfter his stumble and fall, the Habitat had 24 hour medical care for Ozzie. But then it was just too much and the injuries finally took their toll.\n\nRest in Peace Ozzie…know that you brought a smile to everyone who visited you during your time in Nevada!\n\nMike O’Brian is the Program Director and Morning Show host on 96.3 KKLZ in Las Vegas, along with Carla Rea.
