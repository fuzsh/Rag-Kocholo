On Top of the Universe\n5. Ice Cream Parade\n6. Brass Goggles\n7. Out in the Rain\n8. Electricity is in My Soul\n9. Steam Man Band (Reprise)\n10. Blind Minstrel&#39;s Ballad\n11. Captain Albert Alexander\n\nSteam Powered Giraffe&#39;s very first album was originally released in 2009. By 2011, founding member Erin Burke (who played the robot Upgrade) had left the band to pursue other opportunities. Since the band only had one album at the time and potential gigs kept asking where the &quot;female robot&quot; was, the band decided to change their album in 2011 to feature just the current robot lineup. This included new cover art, the removal of Erin Burke&#39;s octave harmonies, and the replacement of Erin Burke&#39;s solo song &quot;I Am Not Alone&quot; with the song &quot;Ice Cream Parade&quot;.\r\n\r\nThis version features the album as it was updated for 2011, with the robot Upgrade removed, and a different song in place of her solo song.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to hear the original 2009 release, we&#39;ve recently re-released that version of this album as well, and it is also available for purchase.",

Everybody's going to the clockwork vaudeville Everybody wants to see the show People crowd the door and scream and shout for more While music and song fill the air Clockwork vaudeville (Clockwork vaudeville) Clockwork vaudeville (Clockwork vaudeville) A man came up to me after the show, after the show (He had a moustache) And asked me if I'd like to meet the robots up close, the robots up close (Not programmed to bite) Well they greeted me and one shook my hand, one shook my hand (Absolutely cool) And asked me if I'd like to join his robot band, I said oh yeah Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah Everybody's going to the clockwork vaudeville Everybody wants to see the show People crowd the door and scream and shout for more While music and song fill the air Clockwork vaudeville (Clockwork vaudeville) Clockwork vaudeville (Clockwork vaudeville) When I was a young boy I went down to the county fair...\n\n3.\n\nSound of Tomorrow 03:30\n\nWho am I, who am I but a sound of tomorrow? I'd like to fly across all of the world in a balloon I'd give my pair of socks to a clown who's lost his on the moon I don't know much 'bout anything that you'd have me do I don't care much about anything 'cept for the love in your heart Who am I, who am I but a sound of tomorrow? Who am I, who am I but a sound of tomorrow? I'd like to dance across all of the earth in the nude I'd give the chance I've got n'give all my love to you I don't know much 'bout anything that you'd have me do I don't care much about anything 'cept for the love in your heart Who am I, who am I but a sound of tomorrow (x4)\n\n4.\n\nI only saw her once But that was all I needed And now I know she's what I've been looking for And only she will do I haven't slept for days Can't focus on anything She's always on my mind And God it'd be so kind If you could let me be For my entire life I never knew what love was like But now I've felt its touch And its far too much For me to hold inside Feels like I'm On top of the universe On a shootin' star Life is so wonderful And everything is by far (So spectacular) Feel like I've never felt Seen things I've never seen Being with her will make me happy And I'm falling in love (Don't catch him) Few girls will offer you A love that feels like this Don't ask for any more Just run and go with it Feels like I'm On top of the universe On a shootin' star Life is so wonderful And everything is by far (So spectacular) On top of the universe On that shootin star Life is so wonderful And everything is by far So spectacular\n\n5.\n\nIce Cream Parade 02:24\n\nIce Cream Man Give him a hand The greatest man in all the land Give him your hand He has scoops for hands The ice cream scooping man Freezer box chest Fastest scoop in the west His ice cream is the best It's no contest And might I suggest Its his ice cream to ingest He has all your favorite flavors Like Butterrumple Butterberry Give me more of Double Triple-Dipped Dinosaur Cherry Wumple Dumple Happy Sprinkle Shoe Cream Pie Platapus Surprise\n\n6.\n\nBrass Goggles 04:12\n\n(Attune your ears to the grinding gears) Come with me I'll show you how to be a metal man When the gears are turning and the fires are burning When the world ticks around you, voices tocking all the time And you live for sleep you've never slept because you cannot sleep Colonel Walter was shocked when he learned from the Nile Copper African elephants turning hostile So he built these wonderful automaton bloaks And a very big steam powered giraffe what smokes Now the war is passed and over We're left to sit and wonder What is life and what is real? And why do living things need feeling? (One, two, three) Chorus: La-Da-Da-Da-Da (x3) La-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da La-Da-Da-Da-Da (x2) La-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da How'd you like to try pumping lead through your veins Or have a heart so wet and cold it starts rusting When the world ticks around you, voices tocking all the time You live for feelings you've never felt because you cannot feel And what is this leaking affecting my eye? Does the oil that is dripping mean this is a cry? Will I ever be something with feelings to hide? Or am I just a boiler with nothing inside? I want all today Don't want to hear you say You can't do this, you can't do that You're not a living thing with feeling (One, two, three) (Chorus) Wind me up, turn the gears (Brass goggles!) Wind me up, turn the gears (Brass goggles!) Wind me up, turn the gears (Brass goggles, goggles, goggles!) Wind me up, turn the gears (Brass googles!) (Part 1 & 2 together) Part 1: I want all today Don’t want to hear you say I love you, I love you I love-love-love you Part 2: Colonel Walter was shocked when he learned from the Nile Copper African elephants turning hostile So he built these wonderful automaton bloaks And a very big steam powered giraffe what smokes Wind me up, turn the gears (x4) (Chorus)\n\n7.\n\nOut in the Rain 04:36\n\nOut in the rain, Out in the sun, Out in the rain, Out in the sunshine There is no place I'd rather be Don't give me nothing in between Just give me sun drops in my eye And let the rainshine light the sky, sky Out in the rain, Out in the sun, Out in the rain, Out in the sunshine Do you recall when you were young?
