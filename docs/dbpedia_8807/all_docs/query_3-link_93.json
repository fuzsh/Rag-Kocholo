        "text": "Lately, good turn-based tactical games have been scarcer than a live service game without a battle pass. Thankfully, that drought is over, thanks to SteamWorld Heist 2. I didn’t know what to expect when I started this steamy journey alongside Captain Leeway. Initially, I thought it’d be a simple turn-based adventure with a few levels to explore and a short story, but I was wrong. I got a game full of soul, engaging combat, unforgettable characters, and an endearing story. While it can get a bit grindy at times and break the pacing of an outstanding narrative, I never had the urge to drop the anchor and step away from this captivating aquatic escapade.\n\nBefore I delve into the nuts and bolts of SteamWorld Heist 2, let’s address the steambot in the room: while it is a sequel, you don’t need to play the first game to enjoy this. While there are some lore details you’ll enjoy by playing the first entry, it isn’t a requirement. I would even argue that SteamWorld Heist 2 is the better starting point in this series due to how well-oiled it is. And for those XCOM veterans, such as myself, looking for a dose of tactical greatness, you can find it with this ragtag crew of pirates.\n\nStory: Under Krakenbane’s Shadow\n\nUsually, when we delve into tactical games, we overlook the story. Our top priority is creating a crew resembling The Expendables and taking them on a guns-blazing mission. But that’s now what SteamWorld Heist 2 does. This sequel delivers a memorable narrative full of twists and emotional moments. Behind these junctures, we have Captain Leeway, a one-armed steambot who wants to make a name of his own after living under the shadow of his mother, thus taking him on a zero-to-hero voyage.\n\nDuring the voyage, everyone on the Great Sea reminds Leeway of his mother’s exploits. The famous Krakenbane saved this place after defeating the creature for which she now bears that nickname. And with this achievement, everyone expects Leeway to be the same: heroic, brave, bold, and dedicated. His mother’s shadow is so large that the people convince him to take on the most difficult task in these seas: fixing the crisis that is eroding the water the inhabitants use to survive. Afraid of disappointing them, he has no choice but to accept and try to fill his mother’s immense shoes while completing this Herculean task.\n\nFortunately, Leeway is not alone on this journey. He is accompanied by an eclectic group of steambots with very valuable combat skills. Daisy, the cheerful, ever-devoted to Leeway Sniper. Wesley, the wise and elegant Reaper. And many more bots that you can recruit in each tavern. SteamWorld Heist 2 brings a handful of well-designed and unforgettable characters ready to kick some metallic Royal Navy butts. Still, I wish there had been more in-depth interactions or character quests that let me get to know them better. This is a missed opportunity because while the steambots excel in combat and certain scenes, they never get to take on a more important role than that of hired guns.\n\nRelated:\n\nStray Gods: Orpheus DLC Review – A Tribute for the Ancient Muses\n\nDespite the fantastic story with unexpected twists and turns, there is one thing I did not enjoy: the grinding. Although it makes sense that you raise your reputation in almost every zone as an up-and-coming pirate, it breaks the pacing. For example, at one point, you must chase a specific enemy quickly. You’d think the urgency of catching this foe would be paramount. But no. The game pulls a full stop and asks you to raise your standing before moving on. While it takes up little time, this is something that breaks all the pacing and importance that the plot achieves. Fortunately, it only happens a couple of times. But when it does, it is very evident.\n\nGameplay: One Trick Shot, One Opportunity\n\nSteamWorld Heist 2 ditches the classic turn-based combat system where RPG elements take precedence. Instead, it gives you over 100 guns to do what steambots do best: bounce bullets around in tight quarters. It’s a simple combat system on paper but becomes the most intricate once you experience it. Since you only have room for one weapon and three support items, every confrontation comes down to how good you are at shooting, not to a wall of stats that one never memorizes in RPGs or a percentage system for landing a shot in other tactical games.\n\nTo put it in simpler terms, SteamWorld Heist 2 has the tactical depth of XCOM without the RNG elements you’d expect. If you want to deliver a headshot, you must line up the shot. Each weapon has different properties to do so. Some, like snipers, have a line that tells you where the bullet is going but requires reloading after firing. Weapons like rocket launchers cause damage to more than one enemy but do not ricochet. Pistols allow you to fire more than once but have no line to see where you are attacking. These little elements make the player have to think about every move. Rather than letting an AI do its job, it is you who pulls the trigger and lives with the consequences.\n\nAnd to top it off, there is also a pretty deep class system that is not difficult to understand. Each steambot has one of the six jobs in the game. And while six classes may not seem like a lot, SteamWorld Heist 2 uses a clever system to combine them all into one character. By switching weapons, you can change jobs, leading to many interesting combinations. Fortunately, there is no limit to the number of possibilities that you can create, which opens a lot of interesting builds that I didn’t get into much. You can make a Sniper who builds cover items like an Engineer or a Boomer with the mobility of a Flanker. The possibilities are endless.\n\nRelated:\n\nKingdom Rush 5: Alliance TD Review – Rushed to Battle\n\nAll these elements come together like clockwork in the many missions you can find. As you explore the Great Sea in your submarine, you’ll encounter several quests you can take to raise your reputation and progress through the story. While I was not too fond of the time gating for the plot to progress, the missions were varied enough that they kept the grind fresh. Every handcrafted quest is executed to perfection. Even those with similar objectives have different outcomes due to the area’s layout or enemy distribution. I even repeated a few missions with other characters to see if I fared better.\n\nGraphics & Audio: A Perfect Assembly\n\nMoving away from the space piracy of the first entry, SteamWorld Heist 2 paints a more colorful picture this time. Every zone is a landscape painted to perfection. From the tropical reefs of the starting area to the frozen lands of the north to the lairs of the skeletal enemies, every area is a marvel to see. However, the characters are the true winners. I loved that the developers focused on creating a dozen steambots, making them extremely recognizable and memorable. Add to that the hat-collecting mini-game you have, and you can either make a crew of edgy raiders or a group of pirates with fruit hats ready to join the next conga line.\n\nUltimately, the big star of SteamWorld Heist 2 is Steam Powered Giraffe. An iconic band that returns to make one of the best soundtracks of the year. Every bar you visit features a song from this group, which, as the young people say, are bangers. The fact that the developers included a different song for each area as a feat on its own and what I loved about it is how each track fits the moment of the story perfectly. All the lyrics tell of Captain Leeway’s journey, and immerse yourself even more in this already endearing adventure.\n\nConclusion: A Steamy Treasure Trove\n\nEven if it isn’t the longest tactical game on the market nor the most visually stunning, SteamWorld Heist 2 is one of the most unique out there. It brings so many elements that instead of falling into an existing formula, it innovates each and every one. The gameplay encourages players to practice their shooting skills instead of waiting for the RNG Gods to grace them. The art style is simple at a glance but extremely iconic and fitting for the game’s setting. And the story, despite its pacing issues, hooks you by bringing you a solid protagonist and a terrific narrative.\n\nRelated:\n\nOnce Human Review – Devious Potential\n\nWith all these elements, Thunderful Development hit the nail on every aspect. It assembled a treasure trove full of engaging tactical features, endearing characters, and a compelling story. While the SteamWorld universe is huge, I hope the Heist series continues to make an appearance. It is an original take on the tactical genre that deserves to get the spotlight as much as possible. Also, if you are eager to take the helm of this adventure before it goes live, you can pre-order SteamWorld Heist 2 with a 10% discount on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles, and on Steam, you can add it to your wishlist to be notified once it launches on August 8, 2024.\n\nReview copy provided by Publisher."
