I can't tell you how many times I've heard of bands breaking up because of this.\n\nEven VH-1 \"behind the music\" wouldn't bother recycling this timeworn, threadbare trope of a narrative.\n\nThe guy on the far right who malfunctions, what's his name? I know stage name is Rabbit but what's his real name? His character has since been replaced by a woman and though there's many pictures of this guy there's no real name for him anywhere\n\n4 hours ago, Christian Jones said:\n\nThe guy on the far right who malfunctions, what's his name?

Now his, I mean her name is \"Bunny\" and they have officially changed genders as of 2016. Sorry, I thought I made that part clear...\n\n2 hours ago, craigb said:\n\nSame person.

I'm talking literally, not the role-playing or whatever. Anyway I found him, he's Chris Bennett, the guy on the right.\n\nWait, are you saying he changed genders in real life?\n\nEdited February 18, 2020 by Christian Jones"
