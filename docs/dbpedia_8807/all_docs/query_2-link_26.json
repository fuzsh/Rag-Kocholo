        "text": "I'm curious if there are other fans on DC! I was recently introduced to SPG and now I can't stop listening.\n\nThey're a steampunk musical pantomime group with vaudeville influence. They dress and act like robots and it's quite impressive. It started with street busking and now they perform at conventions and gig venues. They've got a couple of albums out and there should be another coming soon. Their music has a lot of variety and they're totally entertaining. The members are David Michael Bennett (aka The Spine) and Bunny Bennett (aka Rabbit), who are identical twins and original members of the group, and currently Sam Luke (aka Hatchworth) who replaced The Jon in 2012.\n\nSo.... does anyone else here like them?\n\nOfficial site\n\nYoutube channel\n\nI've actually found out about this band not too long ago. I find them quite interesting and funny (in fact, I sometimes would look at SPG's antics when I start to feel down (ugh, the concentration of negative energy in my house is too censorkipping high) or whenever I'm bored).\n\nKind of a funny story on how I came across this group... I was on my RP tumblr blog at the time when I noticed one of the blogs I was following posted several gifs involving the band. I thought they were interesting, but didn't know where it was from. At least, until someone anonymously asked the RPer if they liked the group. Of course, the anonymous asker used the initials, so I had to google them to figure out what they meant. I didn't really become actively interested (nor when into extreme research mode, like I normally do) until I hear one of SPG's songs on another blog. And that's basically what happened and how I became interested in the band. ^^\n\nEdited November 30, 2013 by Kimoko_the_Dragon\n\nGuess what. I'm here to rain on the SPG parade.\n\nBut don't let this stop you from listening to their music.\n\nI used to be their promoter down here in San Diego.\n\nThat's right.\n\nAnd guess what? Guess it was a big mistake to date Chris.\n\nWoohoo.\n\nA good handful of people -- their actual IRL friends ended up being burned after getting them out as far as we could.\n\nPrimasylph, Cyclops, my cousin, and yours truly ran the original forum for them way before they decided to start up the Cavalcadium.\n\nOnce their forum was up and running, we were recruited to work on THAT one instead of ours because they only considered THEIR site to be \"official\".\n\nEventually we got replaced by \"robots\". Pun intended. Bots that would search the site for foul language and whatever.\n\nThanks to yours truly, they ended up getting a few shows hosted by prominent DJs here.\n\nAnd now? Disney won't touch them because they consider SPG to be \"unwholesome\".\n\nThat's how they are with friends, family, and \"annoying fans\".\n\nYes, they don't like their fans. I've heard it several times from Chris and David's mouths.\n\nWhy? The level of \"creepiness\" these people go to get their attention.\n\nOne guy at Balboa Park once came up and asked \"would you like to see my flea bites?\".\n\nAnd hey. Who can blame them? People are gross. Still no excuse to act like jerks.\n\nFun trivia.\n\n- For hours we played around giving Walter's cat silly faces before settling on one.\n\n- There were FOUR original members: Erin Burke (Robot name: Upgrade. AKA \"the pretty one\"), Jon Sprague (Robot name: The Jon. Because \"toilets are funny\"), and the Bennetts who INSIST that THEY are SPG, that Erin and Jon never played their part as much. Well someone sure sounds modest. *sarcasm*.\n\n- Steve was never a main character. Ever. And to me he never will be.\n\n- The song Honeybee was written for the ex girlfriend before me. SUPRISE.\n\n-Before Jon and Erin \"left\", Chris and I were working on a song \"Ghost Grinder\" which I have no rights to. No \"thanks\" on their 2nd album either although my friends were.\n\n- Album One was considered the \"Haunted Album\" because of so many unexplained sounds during recording. Many of them were editted out or covered before they reprinted them for sale.\n\nI have the original copy.\n\n- And below (my signature) is the original SPG snapshot logo of the FOUR original members. You're welcome.\n\nPs. There's no actual thing as \"steampunk music\". It has NOTHING to do with the punk movement of the late 70's to the early 80's.\n\nSteampunk is actually an ART STYLE deriving from Dada, Surrealism, and Futurism. Pretty much everything is nowadays.\n\nEdited December 8, 2013 by Draikette\n\nI'm sorry about your horrible time with them, but personally I kind of...don't care? Like, I don't care about the personal stuff. I would rather it not have been shared, no matter how interesting it was to read. I just want to share which songs we like, maybe concert dates or something, I don't know. The personal info just seems like way too much. SOME of the trivia was okay, like the haunted album and the original members, but I really think the rest goes a bit too far?\n\nThat's just my opinion, though. It might be fine for the thread, idk. Maybe it's just because I like them and the post was rather negative and I'm just defending them, even if they are jerks. Don't mind meeee. Dx Maybe it's also that I just really would rather not know the personal lives of any artists, celebrities, etc, because it's not any of my business, and I hate when people (usually media) share stuff from their lives. I guess it's because you shared it and I'm like \"WHOA. Whoa there. TMI that I really didn't want to know. I just care about their musiiiic.\"\n\nIf it were me I don't think I would have ever gotten romantically involved or anything. Love + fame just don't work together, imo. Or at least it's not very common at all.\n\nI do have to say that I miss The Jon. I thought he was really cool. From what I've seen he's kinda still around but not as a permanent member.\n\nEdited December 9, 2013 by edwardelricfreak\n\nYou can't stop people from posting their opinions.\n\nAnd like I said:\n\n\"But don't let this stop you from listening to their music.\"\n\nAnd actually the rest DOES matter if you're a club owner or promoter.\n\nWhy? It HELPS to know if the band you're about to put on are or aren't going to wreck the place or be absolute jerks.\n\nI can tell you what kinds of bands I'd love to have back and some others I never want to see again.\n\nHow would you like it if you were in the crowd and the lead singer of a local band deliberately threw a bottle of booze at you for no reason? You said that stuff wouldn't matter. Heh. Try explaining that to a customer who's got a bloody face and a concussion.\n\nAnywho.\n\nYes. Their music is great. David and Mike were trained in music as they grew up.\n\nI still play the original Love World of Love to mess with people in the house.\n\nAnother good thing? No propaganda in the music.\n\nThat's actually the best part about it not being under a record deal by the music industry.\n\nThe original sound I'd have to say has more heart in it.\n\nLately, it's been...messed around with to go with the show. Lack of heart. Boooo.\n\nWired Wrong is a song I used to relate to and it's as close to human that the robots ever got.\n\nAdmitting to mistakes and not understanding what more there is out there because of the way you're made. Sad.\n\nAnd when we were dating, they were still street performers. Not exactly \"famous\". >_>\n\nI don't care if someone's famous. Fame isn't a problem.\n\nI've seen all kinds of people and the only language that matters to me is respect.\n\nLimelights don't turn people into snobs.\n\nIn fact limelights have a tendency to magnify something that's already there.\n\nYeah.\n\nNo, I say love + fame because, though they aren't super famous, I wouldn't try to stay involved with anyone you're trying to promote to BECOME more famous.\n\nAnd YES the limelight CAN make people do things they normally wouldn't. Yes, it can also amplify something that's already there, but it can make them do crazy things.\n\nI doubt too many people on DC, and even less on the forum, and even less viewing this specific thread, are club owners/promoters, so no, I don't think it matters or belongs HERE. Maybe on some other forum, like SPG's or other music related ones with topics for that stuff.\n\nYou could have left it at \"I don't like the members due to personal experiences from being their promoter\" or something. If we wanted to know, we would have asked. It just seems like way too much personal info...\n\nErm. Too bad I have an opinion.\n\nAnd it wouldn't have mattered if love was in the equation or not -- they burnt their CLOSEST FRIENDS too.\n\nAnd actually scratch my statement of it having to matter to just a promoter.\n\nHow would you like it if you were in the crowd and the guitar player of a band you're seeing decided to SPIT on you? I'd suppose you'd worship them, you.\n\nIf they actually LIVED by the wonders and characters portrayed, they'd be such better people. Hypocrites.\n\nAnd that's just it -- the great things you can learn from their music.\n\nMany of the songs deal with the inability to cope with being different from others. Hint bloody hint.\n\nIn a way, it's creating the self-image as being robot or alien -- by that I mean not being able to feel emotions correctly and the feeling you're often very far away from others...even if you're \"close.\" Introvertedness can make people feel very different and very alien from other people.\n\nOther songs inspire the child in all of us like Captain Albert Alexander. STORYTIME SONG YAY.\n\nCatch that train, duel those pirates, soar through the sky! Yes those are all different things from different songs.\n\nThe WONDERS portrayed... Meanwhile...\n\nA thick git trying to talk to me like they know half as much as I do and whip out their \"little guy\" as if it means anything. Too bad it doesn't."
