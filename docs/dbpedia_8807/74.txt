Steam Powered Giraffe, a quirky local act which got its start busking in Balboa Park, blends robot pantomime, original music, pop-culture references and improv comedy.

Members of the futuristic troupe, which is heavily influenced by the Steampunk movement, look like robots and incorporate things like hissing hydraulics as sound effects. Steam Powered Giraffe has a new, all-ages show that includes acrobats, belly dancers, contortionists and plenty of other surprises.

Details: 7 p.m. Thursday. Queen Beeâ€™s Art & Cultural Center, 3925 Ohio St., North Park. $15. (619) 255-5147 or steampoweredgiraffe.com
