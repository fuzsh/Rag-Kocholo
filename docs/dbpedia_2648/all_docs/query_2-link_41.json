        "text": "Whether it's the portrayal of a rockstar like Tommy Singh in Udta Punjab or a depressed lover in Kabir Singh, Shahid Kapoor's versatility knows no bounds. However, there is one film that seems to be the closest to his heart which sets it apart from all the other movies he has worked on.\n\nWe can tell because he charged absolutely no fee to play the lead character in the film, Haider. The Vishal Bhardwaj film was an adaptation of Shakespeare’s play Hamlet. Till date, it remains among the most critically acclaimed movies in Bollywood and Shahid Kapoor’s performance in it was praised by audiences far and wide. Now that we know he did it all for free makes us even more appreciative of his portrayal of Haider. What’s more, this 2014 film was recently ranked seventh in the list of the best Hamlet adaptations in the world.\n\nWe’re sure you’re wondering why Shahid Kapoor didn't charge a single penny for the film. After all, getting into the character, shooting in the cold and more would’ve entailed immense hard work.\n\nA report by Filmfare suggests that Shahid Kapoor liked the script so much that he decided to let go of his fees to reduce the cost of production and help the film make a profit. In fact, even Vishal Bhardwaj did the same. If you want to take a look at what makes Haider among the best performances that Shahid Kapoor has ever delivered, you can watch it online on Netflix.\n\nA few years later, however, Shahid Kapoor hiked up the fee that he charged per movie to ₹35 crore after the success of Kabir Singh. In fact, that film went on to become the second-highest-grossing Bollywood movie in 2019. While Shahid Kapoor got a lot of hate for playing the misogynistic character, the actor chose to focus on the success of the film.\n\nKabir Singh was the last time we saw Shahid Kapoor on the big screen. The film was an adaptation of Arjun Reddy, a Telugu movie featuring Vijay Deverakonda. Shahid had to even go through a massive physical transformation to portray the character with conviction.\n\nThe actor will be seen next in Jersey, which is also a remake of a Telugu film of the same name. This sports drama is based on the life of a cricketer, who was played by Nani in the Telugu version. The Hindi version also features Pankaj Kapoor, Shahid’s real father, as his coach. The film was scheduled to release on August 28, 2020. However, considering that theatres still remain shut in India, we’re expecting the release date to either be pushed or have the movie release on OTT platforms directly as many others have in recent times.\n\nNOW READ\n\nShahid Kapoor's biggest investments: A look at his most expensive buys\n\nFrom Ishq Vishk to Kabir Singh, here's a look at Shahid Kapoor's body transformation journey in 14 pictures\n\nInside Shahid Kapoor and Mira Kapoor’s luxurious Rs 30 crore Mumbai apartment\n\n> More on Entertainment"
