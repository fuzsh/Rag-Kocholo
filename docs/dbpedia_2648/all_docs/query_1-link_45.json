        "text": "Currently making headlines for his performance in his latest release, Kabir Singh, Shahid Kapoor is on a high. The actor played the lead in this Hindi remake of superhit Telugu film, Arjun Reddy which starred Vijay Deverakonda. Seeing the super success of the film, it seems like that Shahid is all set to star in the Hindi remake of another South film, Jersey. Apparently, Karan Johar has secured the Hindi remake rights of Telugu actor Nani’s recent hit.\n\nDirected by Gautam Tinnanuri, Jersey is the story of 36-year-old cricketer Arjun, who rises to fame towards the end of his cricketing career. The moving tale of Arjun's life moved the audience. Jersey also marked Vikram Vedha heroine Shraddha Srinath’s debut in Telugu. The makers are planning to issue an official announcement once they finalise the cast and crew.\n\nWe are still waiting for the big official announcement to happen. Are you excited to see Shahid in the Hindi remake of Jersey? Let us know in the comments below."
