        "text": "Shahid Kapoor epitomises the archetypal Bollywood hero, commonly associated with the conventional masala films that cater to an audience that readily gorges on escapist fare. A trained dancer, with moves that would have impressed Michael Jackson, Kapoor was catapulted to stardom at just 21 with his first movie Ishq Vishk (2003) a teen romance that had him instantly pegged as a romantic idol. Now aged 33, clocking 11 years and 24 films as a star of Hindi cinema, he’s still a heart-throb for millions, and it’s easy to see why. Ruggedly handsome, he retains a glimmer of the boyish charm of his youth. Now he is ready for what could be a career-defining role in Vishal Bhardwaj’s Hindi adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, titled Haider.\n\nAre you a tragic figure? Do you have anything in common with Hamlet?\n\nHis journey is very complex. I wouldn’t say that I have seen such drama in my personal life, but yes I have seen a lot early in life, so I could connect with the emotions the character went through. But if you can’t draw a parallel in your life, then you’d pretty much be at a loss to play the part. You feel you don’t know if this guy is OK or a bit off his rocker. It’s nice to delve into the dark side a little bit. I enjoy that. I have a dark side, for sure. I don’t think I could play this role if I didn’t.\n\nYour father, Pankaj Kapur, was a well-known classically trained stage and screen actor. What did he teach you?\n\nSince a very early age I’ve been heavily influenced by my father – specifically acting being discussed, not just being a star. When I started, my dad would tell me: “If you’re going to act, do Hamlet.” It’s funny that all these years later, that’s what I’m doing.\n\nTaking on Shakespeare is another level from Bollywood, considering all the legends who have played the role?\n\nYes, playing Hamlet is something that’s extremely exciting and at the same time it’s a little scary. It’s a big ask from any actor, and every actor has said that, from the greatest actors who have performed it. I don’t know why Vishal chooses to cast me, but I just feel very thankful that he does.\n\nWhat prompted you to shave your hair off?\n\nThere are certain films you do just for the box office and there are certain films you do which are a cinema of passion. If I hadn’t have shaved my head, it would be like, “Dude, it’s just make up.” You need to tell people: “This film is a big deal for me.”\n\nHas it interfered with your status as India’s most eligible bachelor?\n\nMy father wants to get me married off. He thinks I’m getting old now because I’m 33 and I’m not going to be able to find a girl any more. He says: “You’ve got so used to being on your own that you probably won’t be able to adjust to anybody now.” I get those lectures quite often. I do crave normalcy. It’s nice to find somebody that you can have a normal relationship with.\n\nHow would you sum up the ‘journey of Shahid’?\n\nI’m an actor at heart. It’s probably the biggest part of my life. When I’m not working I feel I’ve had a loss of identity; like I don’t know who I am. I’ve given 11 years of my life to this and probably all of my adulthood. I don’t know who else I am. This is me.\n\nHaider is released on 2 October"
