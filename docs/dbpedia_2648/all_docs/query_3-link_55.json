        "text": "Amazon’s Prime Video continues to be a destination for Hindi and Indian content at large, often dipping into well-known cinematic names to sell their shows. Farzi (translation: Fakes) is the latest entry, tapping Bollywood heartthrob Shahid Kapoor for a crime thriller. How does this stack up against the rest of Prime Video’s strong library?\n\nFARZI: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?\n\nOpening Shot: In a series of flashing images, we see a hostage with a bag over his head jostling in the back seat of a moving car alongside scenes of the car driving through a picturesque but abandoned road towards a mansion.\n\nThe Gist: Sunny (Shahid Kapoor) is a disgruntled artist who takes immense pride in his work (creating fakes of well-known pieces) despite the lack of respect and money he receives from the job. When his grandfather’s beloved printing press is at risk of shutting down, he enlists his best friend Firoz (Bhuvan Arora) to utilize their knowledge about design and printing mechanisms to make money—literally. After a series of trial and error, they successfully recreate rupees that begin circulating in public until a gangster Mansoor (Kay Kay Menon), who runs a similar scheme, finds out and takes them hostage.\n\nWhat Shows Will It Remind You Of? With the black comedic tone and central focus on money and power, Farzi is reminiscent of the Don Cheadle vehicle Black Monday.\n\nOur Take: Farzi, like many contemporary Indian shows and movies, deals directly with the class structure of India. Sunny dates a woman who won’t be seen with him in public, he creates knock-offs of more established art instead of making his own original work, and he is perturbed about how openly he faces discrimination from the upper class. He is sprung into action to heroically save his grandfather’s business, but he’s also trying to prove his worth as an artist and as a man.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice about Farzi is the strength of its script. Characters we’ve just met build rapports quickly with one another through humor, leaning into black comedy to balance the serious nature of the series. The dialogue makes the show feel lived in, in the best way. Hand-in-hand with that is the character development that allows the dialogue to shine. The writers not only set up an entire world over the course of an hour, but they also manage to establish the tone right from the jump.\n\nAudiences may come to see Shahid Kapoor on their screens after a brief hiatus from film and TV, but they’ll stay for the strength of the ensemble. Every actor brings their A-game to the series, and the result is a propulsive and engrossing show.\n\nSex and Skin: There is a small love story in the series, but it serves as another depiction of class versus having romantic leanings. Nothing explicit here.\n\nParting Shot: In the hostage room, Sunny admits to being the mastermind behind the fakes, leaving Mansoor to order Firoz dead.\n\nSleeper Star: Sunny’s best friend Firoz, played by Bhuvan Arora, is afforded some of the best one-liners and comebacks, keeping his best friend in check. Arora’s performance is approachable and charismatic, elevating Firoz out of Sunny’s shadow and into a main character in his own right.\n\nMost Pilot-y Line: The series, at its essence, is about money. The haves and the have-nots are juxtaposed against one another over and over, and Kapoor’s character Sunny puts his motivation very simply about halfway through the first episode: “When you have no money, all you can see is money.”\n\nOur Call: STREAM IT. Farzi is sharp, exciting, and laugh-out-loud funny, pulling off a thrilling black comedy."
