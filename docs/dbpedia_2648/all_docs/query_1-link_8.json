There is no such relation between them other than they were co actors in a movie. They are friends with each other.\n\nHow much shahid Kapoor charge for a movie?\n\nDirector Subhash Ghai is reportedly upset with Shahid Kapoor as the actor has asked for Rs 15 crore to do a film with him. Ten years ago, Shahid Kapoor was a dance extra in Subhash Ghai's Taal and now after the success of Kaminey the actor has asked for Rs 15 crore to do the director's movie. Though Shahid has already done 36 China Town with Ghai, it seems he is no mood to take a lower price now."
