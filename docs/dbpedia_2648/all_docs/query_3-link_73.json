        "text": "The present paper discusses the training and evaluation of the CRF and SVM algorithms for Indo-Aryan languages: Hindi, Odia and Bhojpuri. For annotation of the corpus, we have used Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) annotation scheme which is a common standard of annotation for Indian languages. The main objective of the paper is to provide an idea of the error pattern and suggestions following the same algorithms. The experiment is conducted with 90k tokens training and 2k tokens test data each, for ease of comparison among languages. In the evaluation report, we focus on each tool (SVM and CRF++) at the level of accuracy, error analysis of the tools, the error pattern and common error of the system. The accuracy of the SVM taggers ranges between 88 to 93.7 % whereas CRF ranges between 82 to 86.7%. CRF performs less qualitatively than SVM for Odia and Hindi which is not true for Bhojpuri. In this study, we have observed that languages having more variations are suitable for CRF in comparison to SVM.\n\nDeveloping annotated tagged corpora for a language with limited electronic resources can be very demanding. A number of other components like a dictionary, a stemmer, and a morphological analyzer have to be prepared, prior to the development of a semi automated tagged corpora. Since these tools require a lot of human input, they are time consuming and are also prone to error.\n\nThis work elaborates the semi-semantic part of speech annotation guidelines for the URDU.KON-TB treebank: an annotated corpus. A hierarchical annotation scheme was designed to label the part of speech and then applied on the corpus. This raw corpus was collected from the Urdu Wikipedia and the Jang newspaper and then annotated with the proposed semi-semantic part of speech labels. The corpus contains text of local & international news, social stories, sports, culture, finance, religion, traveling, etc. This exercise finally contributed a part of speech annotation to the URDU.KON-TB treebank. Twenty-two main part of speech categories are divided into subcategories, which conclude the morphological, and semantical information encoded in it. This article reports the annotation guidelines in major; however, it also briefs the development of the URDU.KON-TB treebank, which includes the raw corpus collection, designing & employment of annotation scheme and finally, its statistical evaluat..."
