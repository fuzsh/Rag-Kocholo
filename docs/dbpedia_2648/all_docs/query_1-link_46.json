        "text": "Bollywood heartthrob Shahid Kapoor has joined hands with Sachin Ravi for a magnum opus in Ashwatthama: The Saga Continues, where ancient legend meets modern marvel. The movie is backed by Vashu Bhagnani, Jackky Bhagnani, and Deepshika Deshmukh under their banner Pooja Entertainment.\n\nIn Ashwatthama: The Saga Continues, Shahid will be seen taking centre stage in his most monumental role yet. The movie tells a gripping tale which blurs the lines between myth and reality and will be released in 5 languages - Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada.\n\nThe movie delves into the life of the immortal warrior Ashwatthama from the Hindu epic Mahabharata, believed to walk among us even today.\n\nSet in the present era marked by rapid technological advancements and humanity's remarkable capabilities, Ashwatthama confronts the challenges of modernity, facing off against formidable adversaries in a high-octane, action-packed narrative.\n\nAs the mystery of a legendary figure thrust into the chaos of the present day unravels, the film explores the inner psyche of an immortal being, revealing how he perceives the world he has witnessed for thousands of years.\n\nIn the title poster, the makers promise us an adrenaline-fueled clash of titans as ancient valour clashes with contemporary might. It will be an electrifying ride where the past and present collide, and the true essence of heroism is put to the ultimate test.\n\nThe elated director Sachin Ravi tells us, â€œFor me, immortality is an intriguing concept that evokes a plethora of emotions and dramatic scenarios. The story of Ashwatthama from the Mahabharata, an immortal being believed to be living even today, is what fuelled my desire to delve into his narrative. I aimed to bring this tale to life, placing him in the present timeline and navigating the intricate psyche of an immortal being, exploring how he perceives a world he has witnessed for thousands of years. I sought to present his story within the grandeur of an epic-scaled action film.\"\n\nProduced by Vashu Bhagnani, Jackky Bhagnani, and Deepshika Deshmukh under their banner Pooja Entertainment, the movie is helmed by Sachin Ravi and stars Shahid Kapoor in the lead role.
