He went on to feature in Dil Maange More, Vivah, Jab We Met, Haider, Udta Punjab, Kabir Singh, and Jersey. Shahid has featured only in Hindi language films.\n\nShahid on his Bollywood journey\n\nSpeaking with News18 Showsha, Shahid said, “I have worked here for 20 years so I love my fraternity and I love our films. I feel very comfortable here. Having said that, I’m here to do good work. So on one hand you’re saying Hollywood, I’ll say the reverse thing… If somebody offers me a Tamil, Telugu or Malayalam movie and if I feel there’s a great role to do and it will satisfy me as an actor, I’ll go do that... If you are chasing performance and calibre, I wouldn’t want to go to Hollywood and do some trash. That’s not what I would want to do.\"\n\nShahid on Hollywood\n\nShahid added, “Abhi mere ko Hollywood mein break mil gaya hai… kuch bhi kar lo… Nahi (Now I got a break in Hollywood, do anything, no)! There has to be a certain feeling from inside. You should feel inspired, excited and challenged to do something then language should not be a barrier. But language is a genuine thing. Some people are good at making a transition but some people are not. It’s not easy to do that…If I get an opportunity, I’d go anywhere. Just give me something exciting. I just did OTT. I don’t care.\"\n\nShahid's upcoming film"
