        "text": "Actor Nani recently spoke about the trend of remaking films in different languages and how it is losing its appeal to the audience. The actor is currently gearing up for the release of his movie Dasara, which is a pan-India film and opened up about the failure of the remake of his movie Jersey, which starred Shahid Kapoor. Even Allu Arjun's Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo which was remade as Shehzada failed to impress the critics and audience.\n\nSEE ALSO: Amid Remake Trend In Bollywood, Rishab Shetty Talks About 'Kantara' Hindi Remake; 'I'm Not Interested...'\n\nIn an interview with Galatta Plus, when asked about the reason for the lack of interest in remakes, Nani stated that it's mainly due to the fact that people are already aware of the story and the excitement of being the first one to know about a good film is lost. He said, \"People are excited to be the first one to know if it’s a good film and the remake take that away.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that until a few years ago, films were not released in a pan-India fashion, instead, their remake rights were sold to different markets. But with the success of movies like Baahubali, KGF, and Pushpa, the audience has proven that language is no longer a barrier for a good film.\n\nNani also shared his thoughts on the Hindi remake of his film, Jersey, which starred Shahid Kapoor. He stated that the soul of the film was intact and it was an equally brilliantly made film in Hindi. However, the film failed to perform well at the box office. He said, \" The soul is intact and I think they performed so well. It’s an equally brilliantly made film in Hindi also, not that there’s something missing.\""
