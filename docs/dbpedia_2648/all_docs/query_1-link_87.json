        "text": "After Farzi, Shahid Kapoor is all set for an out-and-out action thriller, Bloody Daddy. The actor recently unveiled the trailer with director Ali Abbas Zafar and claimed that the film is made for an audience who consumes content on OTT from all over the world. He also went on to add that Hindi films are getting better, and Hollywood films cannot replace their vibes.\n\nWhile interacting with the media, Shahid said that the audience has forgotten about the feelings of Hindi films while promising that Bloody Daddy will give that Indian vibe. “I think Hindi films are getting better, What Hindi films can give, Hollywood films cannot give. Perhaps, we have forgotten for some time. If good films are made, that feeling will come too. We are Hindustani, and we like to go out and eat Chinese food but Hindi films are like dal makhani, you can't stay away for long.”\n\nFurther, Shahid also pointed out that the industry needs to unlearn and try to become relevant. “I think we should think fresh. Let's start from the beginning where we don’t know anything. What we know is no longer relevant. Let’s ask the audience what they want to see. Let’s re-learn and be open to the fact that what we know while growing will change.”\n\nBloody Daddy is the adaptation of 2011 French film Sleepless Night. Besides Shahid, the film also stars Diana Penty, Sanjay Kapoor, Ronit Roy, and Rajeev Khandelwal in pivotal roles. Bankrolled by Jyoti Deshpande, Sunir Kheterpal, Gaurav Bose, Himanshu Kishan Mehra, and Ali Abbas Zafar, the film is set to stream on Jio Cinema on June 9, 2023.\n\nApart from Bloody Daddy, Shahid will be seen in an untitled film with Kriti Sanon which is backed by Maddock Films. He is also in talks with Anees Bazme for a comedy film. He will also be seen in Rosshan Andrrews’ Koi Shaq alongside Pooja Hegde."
