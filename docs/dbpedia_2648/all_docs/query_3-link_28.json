        "text": "It’s that time of the year when the lists are up! And since I haven’t got a chance to watch all the films that were released in 2020 (thanks to most of the OTT channels not working here), I made an effort to compile the 50 Best Hindi Films of the last decade, starting from 2010 to 2019. This list would have been out last year or early this year, but my travel plans spoilt the fun. So, I took it upon me, to visit as many films as possible from the last decade, and compile the 50 Hindi Films that I personally loved a lot.\n\n2 films which I would have loved to include in the list, but they miss out because they technically are not ‘Hindi’ films. Anand Gandhi’s Ship Of Theseus and Konkona Sen Sharma’s A Death In The Gunj. Both are brilliant films in their own way and explore very unusual themes, hardly seen in a mainstream Indian film.\n\nSo, here’s my 50 Best Hindi Films from the past decade, ranked in the reverse order.\n\n50. FILMISTAAN (Directed by Nitin Kakkar, 2014)\n\nA story of an Indian held hostage in Pakistan and how he wins everyone’s heart there through the love for Indian Movies, Filmistaan, like its title, was all about Indian movies and its effect.\n\nFilled with humour and some genuine heartfelt moments, Filmistaan boasted of some really good performances from Sharib Hashmi and Inaamulhaq. A small film with a big heart of Gold.\n\n49. ROCKSTAR (Directed by Imtiaz Ali, 2011)\n\nEverytime I watch Rockstar, I discover something new. It doesn’t have a perfect screenplay, but there are parts in this film, which one can’t stop thinking about, months after one has seen the film. I’m not completely bowled by the film, but it’s the discovery of this film which keeps me wanting to go back to this film, time and again.\n\nWith Ranbir Kapoor’s towering performance and Mohit Chauhan being the voice of JJ, and not to forget Rahman’s evocative and classic score, Rockstar is a very important film, on which discussions can go on for hours, with multiple interpretations.\n\n48. GANGS OF WASSEYPUR (Directed by Anurag Kashyap, 2012)\n\nA revenge saga spanning decades and cutting across generations, Anurag Kashyap in this epic film, leaves no stone unturned in making this film. Mind you, it’s a film more than 5 hours.\n\nRight from the opening scene of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi to the climax song of Keh Ke Loonga, Gangs of Wasseypur has some terrific performances by the entire cast and the dialogues have become cult, so to speak. The expletives have never sounded so cool in an Indian film. The chase sequences or the use of old songs to convey the time frame, it all comes together quite well.\n\nSneha Khanwalkar deserves a big shout out for the vast music that she has composed for this film and the songs for sure have a long shelf life. Very few people have a vision and courage like Anurag Kashyap does, to execute a mammoth tale of this scale and make it all look so easy.\n\n47. MADRAS CAFE (Directed by Shoojit Sircar, 2013)\n\nShoojit Sircar’s take on the Assassination of the former Prime Minister of India Rajeev Gandhi, Madras Cafe is a dark and gripping film.\n\nWith no unnecessary melodrama and songs, Madras Cafe soars on pure story telling. Except that, it shies away from taking the real names, which is understood, due to the nature of the subject. The research and execution of this film is brought alive by some great cinematography and the sound design.\n\n46. SHUDDH DESI ROMANCE (Directed by Maneesh Sharma, 2013)\n\nVerbose films are a tricky thing to get across. But Shuddh Desi Romance is one film which has grown over the years. Questioning about the importance of the institution of marriage and throwing spotlight on the dynamics of changing relationships, Shuddh Desi Romance in a way is a quirky mainstream film. Using the technique of 4th wall, the film manages to connect to the audience in be invested in the lives of the 3 protagonists.\n\nSachin Jigar’s music is elevated by the Rajasthan locales, lingo and culture. But it is the tribute to the old songs used in the film to convey the character’s motives, that amused me. Rishi Kapoor, specially, is in a very fine form here.\n\n45. DELHI BELLY (Directed by Abhinay Deo, 2011)\n\nDelhi Belly – There is a scene in Delhi Belly where the character of Vir Das is in a Burkha and he is offered lemon juice in a jeweler’s shop and he drinks it without lifting the Burkha up, because a Police officer is sitting next to him. I still remember my reaction to that scene, where I literally fell off the chair laughing.\n\nDelhi Belly has many such scenes and the humour is consistently delivered scene after scene. It was a shock culture to many for the language used and a few scenes shown in the film, specially because it was coming from the production house of Aamir Khan, but one can’t ignore the fact that he surely has an eye for a solid script.\n\nRib tickling toilet humour, a riveting screenplay and Ram Sampath’s outrageous music (specially Bhaag DK Bose) makes Delhi Belly a complete package film, not to be seen with the family, of course.\n\n44. DUM LAGA KE HAISHA (Directed by Sharat Katariya, 2015)\n\nAn ode to the 90’s, this little film from Sharat Katariya has a big heart. A love story of a loser who marries an overweight girl and how they overcome their differences, Dum Laga Ke Haisha was a breath of fresh air in the romance genre.\n\nAnu Malik’s music nostalgic and evocative music along with the acting by the entire cast makes Dum Laga Ke Haisha quite a family entertainer.\n\n43. DANGAL (Directed by Nitesh Tiwari, 2016)\n\nDangal – A real life story of the Phogat sisters and their father, Dangal is a biopic that tackles wrestling. It highlights the plight of the girls from Haryana and it doesn’t shy away from showing the mindset of people in male dominated society, especially when it comes to sports.\n\nTechnically very sound, with brilliant execution of the matches, Dangal is immensely watchable. The music and the lyrics deserve a special mention along with the performances by the entire cast.\n\n42. NEERJA (Directed by Ram Madhvani, 2016)\n\nFollowing the story of the last day of Indian head purser Neerja Bhanot’s life, where a Pan Am plane is hijacked in Karachi, Neerja is a tale of immense courage and sacrifice.\n\nCutting the scenes between her personal and professional life, the films takes us into the mind of Neerja. Shot almost inside a plane, Neerja still gives the feel of a thriller, thanks to Ram Madhwani’s style of film making. Technically sound, intelligently edited and with some genuine performances, Neerja is a well made film.\n\n41. BAJIRAO MASTANI (Directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali, 2015)\n\nBajirao Mastani – When grandeur meets romance and history, we get a saga called Bajirao Mastani, and who better than Sanjay Leela Bhansali to helm it.\n\nBhansali’s dream project, which was in the pipeline for more than a decade, Bajirao Mastani was brilliant in all the technical departments like all Bhansali films, but this one had memorable dialogues being delivered one after the other, and lavish music along with terrific performances, specially from Ranveer Singh and Priyanka Chopra.\n\nA Modern Classic Romance.\n\n40. DEDH ISHQIYA (Directed by Abhishek Chaubey, 2014)\n\nThis was poetry in motion. The way Abhishek Chaubey deals with movies based in small Indian towns and brings its history alive with the language, mannerisms, it’s people, food and charisma is a case study in itself.\n\nOld age romance, the huge havelis, the sher-o-shaayaris and a subtle tribute to some of the best written works from Indian legends – Dedh Ishqiya was a beauty with brains movie, in a true way.\n\n39. ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA (Directed by Zoya Akhtar, 2011)\n\nThat it is a story of 3 rich friends on a road trip with adventures is fine. But scratch the surface and the issues that these 3 friends deal with are universal; and Zoya gets very little credited for that.\n\nTo tell a meaningful and accessible story in a mainstream cinema is not an easy feat and Zoya manages to merge the art with commerce effortlessly. The characters and their detailing, the music, the ensemble and their performances and above all the not-in-your-face production design is what makes Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara a fun watch.\n\n38. SHAHID (Directed by Hansal Mehta, 2013)\n\nBased on the life of Human Activist Lawyer Shahid Azmi, Hansal Mehta chronicles the journey of Shahid from his training days in the terrorist camp to him becoming the voice of the common man.\n\nShahid also showcases us the condition of the Indian Judicial System and is represented in a very realistic manner. Rajkummar Rao has brilliantly portrayed the character of Shahid Azmi. Hansal Mehta finally found his true calling with this film.\n\n37. TALVAR (Directed by Meghna Gulzar, 2015)\n\nTalvar’s climax is a master class in writing. Meghna Gulzar, with her gaze, presents both the sides of the story of the real life Noida Double Murder Case and shows us the loopholes in the judicial system.\n\nVishal Bhardwaj’s script is sharp, insightful, witty and yet very disturbing. The performances further elevate the film.\n\n36. PARI (Directed by Prosit Roy, 2018)\n\nAnushka Sharma has produced quite interesting high concept films. Pari, a horror love story, has a very interesting premise, unlike the other horror films which concentrate more on scare jump scenes. Pari smartly incorporates the human needs to the superstitions and makes us ponder over quite a few things.\n\nProsit Roy’s handling of the subject and Anushka Sharma’s brilliant portrayal deserve a round of applause.\n\n35. KAI PO CHE (Directed by Abhishek Kapoor, 2013)\n\nBased on Chetan Bhagat’s novel, Abhishek Kapoor adapted the book with a few changes, and gave us a tale of 3 friends and their journey in the middle of real events that happened in Gujarat during the millennium.\n\nKai Po Che, hands down has the best background score in a Hindi film in the last decade, composed by Hitesh Sonik. Along with it, the 3 melodious songs composed by Amit Trivedi are very endearing to the ears too.\n\nA film which almost looks real, thanks to the terrific act by the trio of Sushant Singh Rajput (his debut), Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh.\n\n34. BARFI! (Directed by Anurag Basu, 2012)\n\nThere are very few films which celebrate disability of a person and are not depressing stories. Barfi is one such film, which teaches us to celebrate life.\n\nTimeless songs created by Pritam, empathetic performances from Ranbir Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra and Ileana D Cruz, plus the vision of Anurag Basu – be it his tributes to some of cinema’s iconic scenes or the framing of the visuals by Ravi Varman, Barfi has a lot of heart and brings a smile on one’s face.\n\n33. BAND BAAJA BAARAAT (Directed by Maneesh Sharma, 2010)\n\nWeddings in India are treated bigger than any festivals that we celebrate. No wonder, Band Baaja Baaraat resonated with so many of them. Wedding planners, in the last decade, have become a ‘thing’.\n\nManeesh Sharma made a smashing debut with this little gem of a film, and Ranveer Singh in his first film became an overnight sensation. Fresh pairing, great chemistry, wedding numbers and portrayal of young creative Indians for whom sky is the limit, Band Baaja Baaraat is an aspirational film.\n\nBread pakodas and binness have truly become a thing.\n\n32. DO DOONI CHAAR (Directed by Habib Faisal, 2010)\n\nHabib Faisal’s Do Dooni Chaar is a story of a middle class family who wishes to buy a car. Laced with a wonderful screenplay, witty and sharp dialogues, this film reminds everyone that no dream is big or small.\n\nFurther, the minute observations and details elevate this film to another level. Wearing sports shoes with a suit in a wedding, or buying bulk of detergent powder because of a bumper prize attached to that product – it is very much relatable with the real middle class families.\n\nThe real life couple Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor are a delight to watch and they convince us of their problems with their superlative acting.\n\n31. BAJRANGI BHAIJAAN (Directed by Kabir Khan, 2015)\n\nBajrangi Bhaijaan is a drama film done in a right way. It has all the ingredients for an entertaining Hindi film and it ticks off all the boxes with aplomb.\n\nA movie that talks about harmony, religion and innocence, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is equally funny and a tear jerker. Salman Khan was in fine form after a long time. And his chemistry with Nawazuddin Siddiqui is crackling. But it is Harshaali Malhotra who with her innocence, wins everyone’s heart over.\n\n30. GULLY BOY (Directed by Zoya Akhtar, 2019)\n\nZoya Akhtar tells an underdog story through the lens of a rapper. Set in Dharavi, Gully Boy is rounded with an superlative ensemble cast and the music, specially the rap songs, most of them sung by Ranveer Singh who plays the lead.\n\nZoya Akhtar makes a sharp observation and uses various mediums to convey the indifferences in the society – be it gender based, class based or even the mentality due to the upbringing and the surrounding. A film which deals with many themes.\n\n29. MUKTI BHAWAN (Directed by Shubhashish Bhutiani, 2017)\n\nDirected by a then 25 year old Shubhashish Bhutiani, Mukti Bhawan deals with the theme of Life & Death. It’s a very matured film to be directed at such an young age. It talks about self realization and salvation and how we are burdened by the so-called societal norms.\n\nIt also teaches us the importance of celebration of Life as well as Death. The movie slowly and unconsciously draws you into that world, and it is hard to shake off that effect. The silences in this film, speak volumes. Adil Hussain does a splendid job of a son who needs to follow his father’s wishes. With hi, we also get wise, by the end of the film.\n\n28. PHOBIA (Directed by Pavan Kirpalani, 2016)\n\nA story about a character who has Agoraphobia, Phobia is a psychological horror film. Pavan does not one to take the audience for granted and he keeps us invested in the story, throughout.\n\nOne of the biggest assets of Phobia is Radhika Apte and her class act. Her eyes speak volumes. And the twist in the tale, is why I like Phobia. It’s a crazy one.\n\n27. TAMASHA (Directed by Imtiaz Ali, 2015)\n\nTamasha – Honestly, this one didn’t speak to me much in the first viewing. But then, this movie has just grown on me and it keeps amusing me with something new every time I watch this film.\n\nImtiaz Ali goes for a very different style of film making in this one, and when you realize what he has done with the film and with you, as an individual, it hits you hard.\n\nRahman is in fine form (there is no sad song like Agar Tum Saath Ho in the past decade), Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone’s chemistry is one of the highlights, and I wish one day, Imtiaz Ali makes Tamasha from Deepika’s perspective.\n\n26. PEEPLI [LIVE] (Directed by Anusha Rizvi, 2010)\n\nAnusha Rizvi’s Peepli Live is one of the best satires from Indian Cinema. There are very few satires that have been attempted in India, and that might be due to the political pressure.\n\nPeepli Live talks about the plight of the farmers and the way everyone in the higher authority (read media and political parties) use them for their selfish motives. The tone of the film might induce laughter, but scratch that surface and you will find the real issues and loopholes within our system.\n\nWith a great ensemble, and a solid score, Peepli Live is very much relevant today also.\n\n25. ANDHADHUN (Directed by Sriram Raghavan, 2018)\n\nThe entire piano sequence while the corpse is lying in the house, is in itself a film on its own. And weaving an entire story around this main plot, Sriram Raghavan builds a whole world of eccentric characters and unthinkable sub plots.\n\nTabu and Ayushmann Khurana chew off each other with their histrionics and are a treat to watch. The climax leaves open for interpretation and it’s fun to discover and listen to many different theories that are floating around.\n\n24. MUKKABAAZ (Directed by Anurag Kashyap, 2018)\n\nA love story with a sports backdrop or a sports story with a romantic angle, Mukkabaaz can be seen in both the ways. But it is more than what meet the eyes.\n\nA sharp critique on the people who misuse their power, or even the mob lynching’s in the name of food or animals or even caste, Anurag Kashyap spares nothing. He is at a comfort zone when he tells these hither land stories.\n\nVineet Kumar Singh goes blazing with his performance in this one. And it is that subtle yet different climax which makes Mukkabaaz different from all the other similar themed films.\n\n23. ALIGARH (Directed by Hansal Mehta, 2015)\n\nHansal Mehta and Apurva Asrani, with their sensitive direction and writing, give us Professor Siras, where Manoj Bajpayee gives a performance of a lifetime.\n\nA story about invasion in a man’s private life and making it public, Aligarh deals with the subject of loneliness, one’s helplessness and how a person’s pride and image is perceived in the society.\n\nThat one scene of Prof Siras having his drink and listening to a Lata Mangeshkar song, sitting alone in a corner of the room, is worthy enough, to showcase what cinema is all about.\n\n22. LOVE SEX AUR DHOKHA (Directed by Dibakar Banerjee, 2010)\n\nDibakar Banerjee in his experimental cinema manages to tell 3 different compelling stories dealing with the theme of the title; love, sex and deceit.\n\nThe usage of different cameras in each of these different story is the biggest strength of this film. The tribute to the romance that 90’s kids have been brought up with or the voyeurism that makes us question our action, Love Sex Aur Dhokha is an insight on the possibilities of film making and the constant upgrading of technology.\n\n21. SONI (Directed by Ivan Ayr, 2019)\n\nA story of 2 ladies in the police force in the city of Delhi, Soni shows us how and what women go through on a daily basis, in a male dominated society, be it in their private life or in a public place.\n\nWithout being loud and preachy, Soni subvertly tells a lot of things, which are shocking, and they shouldn’t exist in the first place, in an ideal world. Both Geetika Vidya Ohlyan and Saloni Batra are in great form.\n\n20. TUMBBAD (Directed by Rahi Anil Barve, 2018)\n\nTumbbad showed us that Indian heartland still has so many unknown folklores and if told with great dedication and determination, we can soar. A story about greed, Tumbbad in more ways than one, shows the mirror to our society, of what we humans have become.\n\nThe sheer imagination of the basic concept of Tumbbad and executing it after failing multiple times and capturing so beautifully on the lens, Tumbbad truly was a chilling yet mesmerizing experience. A movie deserving a big screen experience.\n\n19. ENGLISH VINGLISH (Directed by Gauri Shinde, 2012)\n\nGauri Shinde’s debut showed us why Sridevi was considered a legend. A comeback of sorts for the superstar, English Vinglish is a Sridevi show all the way. The way she underplays the character of Shashi, English Vinglish and its plot is still an existent topic in many parts of India.\n\nAmit Trivedi’s music, some brilliant casting of the ensemble and Gauri Shinde’s deft direction makes English Vinglish a movie, which can be visited time and again, and one would never get bored.\n\n18. SONCHIRIYA (Directed by Abhishek Chaubey, 2019)\n\nThe best thing about Abhishek Chaubey is that he doesn’t take his audience for granted. He will stick to the roots and gives us an wholesome experience. Sonchiriya is filled with dialogues in Bundelkhandi and yet one doesn’t find it very difficult to understand or follow, because the story is so solid.\n\nA story about rebels and redemption, Sonchiriya attempts to address the topic of conscience and dharma and a man attaining freedom from his past deeds. With brilliant acting by the ensemble, Sonchiriya is a film, which hardly anyone would want to attempt, and that’s a shame.\n\n17. ANAARKALI OF AARAH (Directed by Avinash Das, 2017)\n\nAnaarkali Of Aarah is a tale of an erotic folk singer and how an episode of a sexual advance by a politician in a public place makes her life upside down. With her revenge, she then explains the real meaning of consent.\n\nSwara Bhaskar and Sanjay Mishra ace in their acting but it is the use of folk music, specially the climax song which deserves a mention. The music by Rohit Sharma is terribly underrated and sadly went unnoticed.\n\n16. TITLI (Directed by Kanu Behl, 2015)\n\nBrutal and not for the faint hearted, Kanu Behl’s Titli is an anti family film about a family living in Delhi, who are selfish creatures and everyone has their own motive.\n\nDisturbing and yet delightful, Titli boasted of some disturbing scenes and wonderful performances but it is a film which is grossly underrated.\n\n15. PAAN SINGH TOMAR (Directed by Tigmanshu Dhulia, 2012)\n\nOne of the first few films to start the trend of biopic in a true sense as a genre, Tigmanshu Dhulia’s Paan Singh Tomar is an unsung story of a National Champion who turns into a dacoit due to circumstances.\n\nDhulia doesn’t glorify and shows how biopic should actually be made. And then there is Irrfan who immortalized the character of Paan Singh Tomar. A class act.\n\n14. UGLY (Directed by Anurag Kashyap, 2013)\n\nUgly is the story of a 10 year old girl who goes missing. And while searching for her, how everyone’s ugly side is revealed, is what forms the crux of the story.\n\nIn what is Anurag Kashyap’s finest film, Ugly shows the dark side of humanity. In fact, the censor board refused to clear this film, because as per them, this film didn’t have even a single positive scene. Ugly is bold, gripping and dark.\n\n13. HIGHWAY (Directed by Imtiaz Ali, 2014)\n\nIn what is my personal favorite Imtiaz Ali film, Highway has one of the best OST I have heard in the last decade. A movie which speaks volumes in its silences, a movie which talks about freedom when one is caged, Highway hit all the right notes.\n\nRandeep Hooda and Alia Bhatt’s performances, Anil Mehta’s lens which capture India so beautifully and Irshad Kamil’s philosophical lyrics is what makes Highway a very special film.\n\n12. LOOTERA (Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, 2013)\n\nOh, the beauty of Cinema. If anyone questions as why Cinema is one of the most beautiful medium to tell a story and connect with people, Lootera is the answer, from the last decade.\n\nThe command that Motwane has over is craft is impeccable. No wonder, both Ranveer Singh and Sonakshi Sinha have given their everything to play these roles and it’s considered to be their finest work.\n\nAdd to that, the poetic touches, the recreation of that era, and most importantly the gorgeous music by Amit Trivedi. Not to forget the way Mahendra J. Shetty captures the era and the beauty of Paakhi. Lootera is a film for people who appreciate cinema in its purest form.\n\n11. OCTOBER (Directed by Shoojit Sircar, 2018)\n\nShoojit Sircar and Juhi Chaturvedi tell a coming of age story about an accident, which transcends romance and talks about the importance of selfless love.\n\nOctober is a visual medium for us to heal, for us to understand the silences of our lives and more importantly, shows us the power of love and faith. October is one of the most meditative films to come out in the last decade. Avik Mukhopadhyay captures this calmness through his lens and gives a depth to this film. Varun Dhawan’s best performance yet.\n\n10. QUEEN (Directed by Vikas Bahl, 2014)\n\nIn what is one of the most feel good films from the last decade, Vikas Bahl’s Queen celebrates womanhood and in an endearing manner.\n\nKangana Ranaut’s vulnerable act along with the supporting cast and Amit Trivedi’s fresh music, makes Queen a delightful watch.\n\n9. HAIDER (Directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, 2014)\n\nAdapting William Shakespeare’s Hamlet to the land of Kashmir, Vishal Bhardwaj, in the last part of his trilogy, gives us a film which is complex, and has a strong socio-political commentary to offer.\n\nKnock out performances from Shahid Kapoor, Tabu, Kay Kay Menon and Irrfan; Pankaj Kumar’s cinematography and Gulzar’s lyrics with Bhardwaj’s great musical score, shows what it takes for a movie like Haider to be made.\n\n8. PIKU (Directed by Shoojit Sircar, 2015)\n\nJuhi Chaturvedi’s charming script is elevated by the brilliant performances of Amitabh Bachchan, Irrfan, Deepika and Moushumi Chatterjee.\n\nA story revolved around constipation, Piku has some hilarious dialogues and humor. A slice of life film, Piku benefits immensely from its music too, composed by Anupam Roy. A movie which can lift up your spirits.\n\n7. TALAASH : THE ANSWER LIES WITHIN (Directed by Reema Kagti, 2012)\n\nTalaash is the most personal film for me, from the last decade. A widely misunderstood film, Talaash marries the supernatural phenomenon with grief and it is a noir film tracing multiple stories and themes. With each sub plot being a solid link to the main plot, Reema Kagti humanizes each and every character and the ensemble enacts them out brilliantly.\n\nThis one is not a whodunit thriller or a scary horror film. It is an intelligent film, firmly rooted in reality and an unreal realistic story. If one has not even seen the film and just listens to the OST of Talaash given by Ram Sampath, they would get the gist of the film.\n\n6. THE LUNCHBOX (Directed by Ritesh Batra, 2013)\n\nHow often do we get to see a love story where the two characters don’t meet at all (or do they meet?) Ritesh Batra isolates the story of 2 individuals in the bustling city of Mumbai and tells it with the use of food and letters.\n\nA movie where every dish that is prepared feels like we as an audience can smell it, where we can recognize the character only through her voice (Bharti Achrekar) without any screen presence, and the climax which can have multiple interpretations so that we can take the story forward, the way we would want to – The Lunchbox is a modern classic. Add to it, the standing ovation worthy performances from Irrfan, Nimrat Kaur and Nawazuddin Siddiqui.\n\n5. KAPOOR & SONS (SINCE 1921) (Directed by Shakun Batra, 2016)\n\nA story about a dysfunctional family, Kapoor & Sons is the most I have identified with the characters in the past decade. Every character feels like a chapter from my life.\n\nWith an amazing eye for detail and interlinking multiple stories, Shakun Batra shows great maturity in handling the subject so well. Great ensemble, delicate chemistry and a great script, Kapoor & Sons made me nostalgic about my own life.\n\n4. ANKHON DEKHI (Directed by Rajat Kapoor, 2014)\n\nRajat Kapoor’s Ankhon Dekhi, which tells a story about a 55 year old man (Sanjay Mishra in an outstanding act) and his stance about truth is philosophical, real and filled with humor and nostalgia.\n\nWhat further elevates the film is its music composed by Sagar Desai, which is very underrated. All the songs give us a feeling of the seasons passing by. Great ensemble where everyone looks like they belong to that family only, and the fantasy meets reality climax, which makes us ponder, Ankhon Dekhi is a delightful watch.\n\n3. KAHAANI (Directed by Sujoy Ghosh, 2012)\n\nThis Sujoy Ghosh thriller starring Vidya Balan, is one of the most wholesome film I have seen. The way Namrata Rao has edited this film and the way the screenplay has been used in this film, or the way the city of Kolkata has been captured in this film by Setu, and just the basic plot of a pregnant woman looking for her missing husband is dealt with, this one is a master class in filmmaking.\n\nNot to forget that terrific act by Balan and the supporting cast, Kahaani proved that ‘Story’ is the most important aspect of a film. I only wish that the soundtrack by Vishal Shekhar is heard by more people. It is very underrated.\n\nWith every viewing, Kahaani gets more and more better.\n\n2. UDAAN (Directed by Vikramaditya Motwane, 2010)\n\nVikramaditya Motwane’s debut film gave courage to an entire generation of youngsters. It asked them to dream and fly, without worrying about what lies ahead. An anti family film (specially in context of India and its people), Udaan was one film which is meant for family viewing.\n\nA very refreshing take on a father-son relationship, Motwane gave us perspectives from everyone’s point of view in such a subtle manner that in spite of them being on the wrong side of law, we could empathize with them. Terrific acting by Ronit Roy and Rajat Barmecha, motivating music by Amit Trivedi and above all a coming of age story, is what makes Udaan very relevant and impactful.\n\nIt is hard to forget those eyes of Rajat Barmecha and the final scene with his younger brother.\n\n1. MASAAN (Directed by Neeraj Ghaywan, 2015)\n\nWords fall short of what I feel for Masaan. Exploring the theme of ‘curiosity’, Masaan expands its horizon on life and death, casteism, grief, innocence and above all humanity.\n\nNeeraj Ghaywan’s direction and Varun Grover’s understanding and writing of the subject is so evocative that one cannot stop feeling for the characters of Deepak and Devi.\n\nCrisscrossing between 4 stories, Masaan has some great characters, a memorable love story, meaningful songs written by Varun Grover and composed by Indian Ocean and above all, the most heartbreaking scene of the decade in a Hindi Film. It is the redemptive end that makes your heart soar for the protagonists.\n\nSo, these were my Top 50 Hindi Films from the last decade. A few films, which I dearly love could not feature, as the films featured here were much stronger than them, craft wise.\n\nHoping this decade gives us some more gems to cherish for and make me a better human being. Till then, do drop your comments and let us know your favorite films from the last decade."
