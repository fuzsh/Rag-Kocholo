Producer Kumar and Kapoor previously collaborated on 2019 box office hit Kabir Singh.\n\n“Bull is a full blown action film inspired by real events from the life of Brigadier Bulsara,” said Shahid Kapoor. “It is a privilege to play a paratrooper who lead his boys through a historic and selfless mission that has now become iconic for its precision and bravado. The opportunity to play a paratrooper is exhilarating and truly an honour.”\n\n“I am happy to collaborate with Shahid again after the fantastic performance of Kabir Singh at the box office. This film also marks the beginning of my association with Amar Butala and Garima Mehta and we hope great cinema emerges from our hard work,” added Bhushan Kumar, Managing Director, T Series.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n“This film is our homage to the men in uniforms, our soldiers who put the nation’s pride over all else.
