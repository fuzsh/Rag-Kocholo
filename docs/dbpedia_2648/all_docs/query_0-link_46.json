        "text": "2.5 Stars (out of 4)\n\nWatch Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba on Netflix\n\nTaapsee Pannu and Vikrant Massey reprise the chaotic lovers Rani and Rishu from 2021’s Haseen Dillruba in Netflix’s first Original movie sequel: Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba (“Beautiful Beloved is Back” — and yes, there’s now an extra ‘s’ in Hasseen).\n\nFamiliarity with the first film is essential to understanding the characters and why they are living the way they are in the sequel (which takes place several years after the original). Thankfully, Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba offers a plot summary via a song montage within the first ten minutes. It’s a sufficient memory refresher for those who’ve watched the original.\n\nAs in Haseen Dillruba, the sequel begins with Rani (Pannu) in the middle of a crisis. She runs into a police station on a rainy night, claiming that her husband is trying to kill her. The action then flashes back to two months earlier. Rani lives in Agra and tells everyone she’s a widow, but the truth is her husband Rishu (Massey) is actually alive and living in town as well. They meet secretly in a park with a view of the Taj Mahal and plan their escape to Thailand, where they can finally be together again.\n\nOf course things don’t go as planned. Inspector Kishore Jamwal (Aditya Srivastava, whose character was named Kishore Rawat in the original) still believes that Rani is a murderer, and he tracks her down in Agra. Worse, he’s brought along tenacious police officer Mritunjay Prasad (Jimmy Shergill), who happens to be the uncle of Rani’s affair partner Neel from the first movie. “Uncle Montu” won’t rest until he finds Rishu and makes him and Rani pay.\n\nTo confuse the cops, Rani proposes marriage to love-struck pharmacist Abhimanyu (Sunny Kaushal, who plays smitten beautifully). She warns him that her heart will always belong to Rishu, but Abhimanyu says he’s okay with that — until he finds out that Rishu is still alive.\n\nThough Jayprad Desai directs Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba — and capably so — the franchise is the brainchild of screenwriter Kanika Dhillon. Mystery series are often centered around detectives, so there’s novelty in having the protagonists be criminals while still hitting all the necessary genre beats. The surprising character developments of the first film are largely absent since Rani and Rishu are known quantities, but that adds a pleasant feeling of familiarity.\n\nIn the best mysteries, there’s an element of “play along at home” that the viewer engages in, trying to figure out what’s going on before the writer reveals the solution. While there are some nice setups and payoffs, the ultimate revelations seem to come out of nowhere. More obvious possibilities are ignored in favor of answers that are totally unpredictable.\n\nPart of why this happens is that Rani’s character is a fan of a fictitious mystery author Danish Pandit, and his works are continually referenced. Were Rani a fan of Agatha Christie, well-read viewers would be able to spot allusions to her books and guess where the story is going. But the Haseen Dillruba movies are tethered to the internal logic of an imaginary author’s bibliography, allowing Dhillon to explain everything away via a connection to Pandit. Everything makes sense if you’re a fan of Danish Pandit — but no one but Dhillon is, because Pandit isn’t real.\n\nNevertheless, Phir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba is consistently entertaining, with interesting performances throughout. If there’s a way to keep this franchise going, I hope Dhillon comes back for a third round.\n\nLinks\n\nPhir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba at Wikipedia\n\nPhir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba at IMDb\n\nWatch Haseen Dillruba on Netflix\n\nMy review of Haseen Dillruba\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n3 Stars (out of 4)\n\nWatch Kakuda on Zee5\n\nKakuda is an entertaining horror comedy elevated by solid performances from its talented cast. The film is right in the wheelhouse of folks who enjoyed movies like Stree and Bhoot Police.\n\nThe town of Rathodi has been cursed for 65 years. Every Tuesday night at 7:15, one man from each house (women are exempt) must open a small door next to the home’s main entrance to show the ghost Kakuda that he’s welcome. Men who fail to open the door develop a hunchback and die within thirteen days.\n\nThis happens so often that the town has a protocol to fill those thirteen days — an extended funeral, but with the soon-to-be deceased in attendance. The glum victim poses for the photo that will hang on his family’s wall while village women sing a peppy song about how he should’ve opened the door on time.\n\nWell-educated Indira (Sonakshi Sinha) lives in a neighboring town and dismisses the Kakuda legend as superstition. Sunny (Saqib Saleem), her boyfriend from Rathodi, knows better. She insists on eloping on a Tuesday, but the wedding runs long and he doesn’t make it home in time.\n\nEven after seeing the hump on Sunny’s back, Indira still isn’t convinced it is anything more than a medical issue. An unsuccessful surgery turns her into a believer. Thankfully, the hospital’s security guard Victor (Riteish Deshmukh) is a part-time ghost hunter, and he offers his services to the newlyweds.\n\nThe theme of science versus superstition runs throughout the film, and Victor personifies it. He uses a mix of technology and magic to uncover the grievance driving Kakuda’s curse. Unlike a lot of American supernatural fare, the tragic backstory of Kakuda‘s ghost doesn’t absolve him of his misdeeds. The main trio needs all the help they can to end his reign of terror, including assistance from Sunny’s best friend Kilvish (Aasif Khan) and Indira’s identical twin sister Gomati (also Sinha).\n\nKakuda‘s cast is perfectly suited for the film’s tone. It’s very funny, but not in a goofy way, so the actors treat the material with sincerity. Sinha does the heavy lifting in her dual role, but Saleem is a wonderful sad-sack boyfriend. Khan is careful not to go over the top as the comical sidekick best friend.\n\nDeshmukh also has plenty of experience in broad comedies, but his performance in Kakuda is understated and right on point. The costuming and styling department deserves credit because his edgy ghost hunter avatar is a particularly cool look.\n\nLinks\n\nKakuda at Wikipedia\n\nKakuda at IMDb\n\nMy review of Stree\n\nMy review of Bhoot Police\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI updated my list of Bollywood movies on Netflix with today’s addition of the Malayalam film Aadujeevitham:The Goat Life (also available in Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and Telugu) and the debut of the new series Tribhuvan Mishra: CA Topper. If you want a little more info on the show before diving in, check out my Tribhuvan Mishra preview for What’s on Netflix.\n\nBig expiration date news at Netflix! Both Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion will leave Netflix on August 7, just five days after the premiere of the documentary Modern Masters: S.S. Rajamouli. It won’t surprise me if Netflix renews their license to screen the Baahubali films, but it might not happen right away. Or the films might move to a new streaming service. Or maybe they won’t.\n\nGiven that the streaming availability of movies is never a sure thing, what are your options if you want to own it in physical form? From what I’ve been able to find on Amazon, individual DVDs of Baahubali: The Beginning and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion formatted for North American DVD players sell for $49.99 each. If you are the ultimate collector, there’s a 2-DVD set of both Baahubali films for $375.

Maan says that, while Vaishali thinks she’s traded up, if Khanna tells her that he’s over her, it’ll make her question whether she’s with the right guy.\n\nTheir friend Honey (Manjot Singh) agrees, but he thinks it’ll be most effective if Khanna tells Vaishali “I am over you” in person. Festivities are underway for her wedding in Pathankot, which is only a three hour drive from Patiala. Honey offers to drive them there in his souped-up truck.\n\nThe only friend with reservations is cowardly Jain (Jassie Gill), but that’s just because he’s terrified of his overbearing dad. Jain’s own arranged marriage is scheduled for next week, so he’s already got plenty to worry about. Still, the guys convince Jain to lie to his dad and join them since they’ll be back from Patiala by morning. What could go wrong?\n\nBefore they’ve even left town, the guys crash a wedding to get free food and drinks. When they wake up hungover the next morning at a stranger’s house, Jain discovers he’s married to the woman whose wedding they crashed. And they’re still hours away from Pathankot.\n\nAs immature as the friends are, they’re actually decent guys. Their plan isn’t borne out of vindictiveness, but out of concern for Khanna’s well-being. Taking him to his ex’s wedding to tell her he’s moved on isn’t that disruptive, and it will give him back a sense of control.\n\nAfter some initial reluctance, they even welcome Jain’s accidental bride Radha (Patralekhaa) into the group. She suggests that Khanna’s declaration will be more believable if he’s accompanied by a new woman, and they head to a nearby college to find one. That’s how feisty Meera (Ishita Raj) joins the crew.\n\nWhen the story focuses on the characters, it’s pretty entertaining. It helps that the acting is uniformly good, with Manjot Singh and Patralekhaa standing out among the rest. Counterintuitively, the story drags during the action scenes in the second half, when the group engages in multiple car chases and a shootout with drug dealers. Drugs and guns feel like perfunctory signifiers that the movie is set in Punjab, as if without those tropes the movie would lack a sense of place.\n\nSimarpreet Singh’s direction is overall good, and the screenplay — co-written by Ranjan, Sandeep Jain, and Harman Wadala — is decent. But Wild Wild Punjab is a misleading title for a movie so conventional.\n\nLinks\n\nWild Wild Punjab at IMDb\n\nWatch Wild Wild Punjab on Netflix\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n3 Stars (out of 4)\n\nWatch Sharmajee Ki Beti on Amazon Prime\n\nFirst-time feature director Tahira Kashyap Khurrana (wife of actor Ayushmann Khurrana) shows a lot of promise with her comedy-drama Sharmajee Ki Beti (“Sharmajee’s Daughter“). The story peeks into the lives of five women and girls–all with the last name Sharma–living in the same apartment building, as they deal with different gender-related problems.\n\nKashyap Khurrana makes the mistake that plenty of filmmakers have made before by treating “women’s issues” as a single theme that can be addressed in its entirety in one film. It’s not a fatal flaw, but it does make the screenplay — which was written Kashyap Khurrana — feel unfocused at times.\n\nThe character whose arc least successfully integrates with the rest is that of Tanvi Sharma (Saiyami Kher), a single woman living in the building. She’s a state-level cricket player, but her actor boyfriend Rohan (Ravjeet Singh) only cares about her looks. Kher does a fine job showing Tanvi’s attempts to reconcile her self-image with the one Rohan wants her to present, but it’s a thin premise. The movie wouldn’t have suffered without her plotline.\n\nKashyap Khurrana had everything she needed for a full film with the four remaining Sharma ladies: the mother-daughter pairs of Jyoti (Sakshi Tanwar) & Swati (Vanshika Taparia) and Kiran (Divya Dutta) & Gurveen (Arista Mehta). Daughters Swati and Gurveen are 13-year-old best friends. Jyoti teaches at a coaching center, while Kiran is a stay-at-home mom.\n\nBetween them, Jyoti and Kiran face a lot of the problems of modern motherhood. Jyoti struggles to balance her career and the satisfaction it gives her with her duties to her sweet husband Sudhir (Sharib Hashmi) and to Swati. On the flip side, Kiran feels isolated after moving from Patiala to Mumbai, especially with her businessman husband Vinod (Parvin Dabas) acting distant and staying out late. Tanwar and Dutta are both terrific, but Dutta really makes the most of her sympathetic role.\n\nThe real stars of Sharmajee Ki Beti are the girls, Swati and Gurveen. The whole movie could have been about them. Their story arcs are that endearing and their performances are that charming. Swati is OBSESSED with the fact that she’s the only girl in her class that hasn’t gotten her period yet. Gurveen tolerates Swati’s constant menstrual talk, while coming to grips with her own preoccupation with one of the pretty older girls at school.\n\nKashyap Khurrana’s strongest attribute as a director is her faith in her actors, and that faith extends to the two teens playing Swati and Gurveen. The girls have long dialogue exchanges that are shot in one take, and Taparia and Mehta are more than up to the task. Their scenes together are the most immersive in the movie, because they feel like real friends. Keeping the camera on them for as long as Kashyap Khurrana does while both of them are in frame adds to the immersion.\n\nI cannot say enough wonderful things about Vanshika Taparia as Swati. She gives an outstanding performance. She’s hysterically funny when bemoaning her delayed puberty. She’s also crushing in the way only a teen girl can be when her mom forgets to pick her up from school. The recent boom (comparatively speaking) in Hindi movies about teenagers gives me hope that we’ll get to see more of Taparia sooner rather than later. Her performance alone is reason enough to watch Sharmajee Ki Beti.\n\nLinks\n\nSharmajee Ki Beti at Wikipedia\n\nSharmajee Ki Beti at IMDb\n\n[Disclaimer: my Amazon links include an affiliate tag, and I may earn a commission on purchases made via those links.

After wowing audiences at its Toronto International Film Festival premiere in 2023, Kill found an international distributor in Lionsgate, which is giving the movie a major theatrical release in the United States on July 4, 2024.\n\nKill‘s protagonist Amrit is played by TV actor Lakshya, who makes his big-screen debut in the first of the three movies he’s under contract for with Dharma Productions. Amrit is an Indian Army commando who returns from an assignment to a slew of missed messages from his girlfriend Tulika (Tooth Pari‘s Tanya Maniktala). Tulika’s powerful, well-connected father has arranged her engagement to another man, and Amrit must rescue her before the wedding.\n\nAmrit crashes Tulika’s engagement party while his friend and fellow commando Viresh (Abhishek Chauhan) waits in the getaway car. Tulika says it’ll be safer for Amrit to rescue her after her family’s overnight train ride to Delhi, so he and Viresh sneak onto the train.\n\nUnfortunately, the train is targeted by an extended family of about three dozen bandits who intend to isolate several train cars and rob all of the passengers of their valuables within 30 minutes. It should be an easy job, but they didn’t bargain on there being commandos onboard.\n\nAmrit and Viresh are able to knock out several of the thieves in their carriage, but one attacks Viresh with a knife. Viresh instinctively turns the knife around to stab his attacker, killing the man. The bandit’s death changes the terms of engagement, and the gang’s mission expands to include murdering the commandos and any unfortunate passenger who gets in their way.\n\nThe repercussions of death is a theme that the movie returns to time and again. Whenever a person on either side of the fight between bandits and non-bandits dies, it raises the stakes by motivating the living to take revenge. Constantly reminding viewers that each character has someone who will grieve their passing keeps the deaths from being trivialized — a tricky but laudable goal in a film with a high body count.\n\nAlso raising the stakes are the cramped quarters within which the fighting takes place. Amrit and Viresh punch and kick the bad guys in the narrow corridor running through the middle of the train car, trying to avoid injuring frightened passengers in the process. Squaring off in the open space next to the bathroom feels comparatively luxurious. All the while, they and their opponents find novel ways to utilize the tools at their disposal. Amrit’s use of a fire extinguisher is particularly gruesome.\n\nThat said, Kill is more violent than it is gory. There’s much more blood than viscera, if that makes a difference. In some ways, the violence in Kill is less shocking than other instances of violence in Hindi films. Context is important, and Kill is very clear about what kind of movie it is (the title is kind of a giveaway). I found the violence in a film like 2013’s Boss much more unsettling given its tonal inconsistency. One minute, Akshay Kumar’s character is humorously hitting his opponents on the head with coconuts, the next he impales a man in the chest with a circular saw blade.\n\nThe execution of the action in Kill is second to none. Action directors Se-yeong Oh and Parvez Shaikh give every move weight, and they maneuver the characters through the cramped carriage in a way that seems physically impossible. As the characters’ injuries mount, their fighting speed and power ratchet down to make it more believable.\n\nLakshya is a legit action star, even after just one movie. As Vidyut Jammwal branches out from martial arts flicks and Tiger Shroff reevaluates after successive box office flops, Lakshya is ready to fill the void. Chauhan’s Viresh is no less dynamic and exciting in his fight scenes.\n\nManiktala’s Tulika is more than just a damsel in distress, displaying courage when the bandit leader’s son Fani (Raghav Juyal) sets his eyes on her. Juyal wisely underplays Fani so that he’s not too slimy or menacing, but still dangerous because he knows he operates from a privileged position.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing about Kill is that it is so good despite being directed by Nikhil Nagesh Bhat. Bhat directed what I thought was the worst Hindi movie of 2022 (the morally odious Hurdang), and his bandit action flick Apurva made my “Worst of” list in 2023 as well. Clearly Dharma Productions saw something in Bhat’s abilities that I hadn’t before. Credit to his Kill co-writer Ayesha Syed as well.\n\nThe whole film works because it routinely pauses so that characters (and the audience) can process their emotions. No one can fight for two hours non-stop anyway, allowing Bhat to lean into the melodrama, anger, and heartbreak the characters are feeling during those pauses in the action. In that sense, Kill feels at home in the filmography of the same studio that developed Kabhi Khushi Khabie Gham.\n\nLinks\n\nKill at Wikipedia\n\nKill at IMDb\n\nMy review of Boss\n\nMy review of Hurdang\n\nMy Worst Bollywood Movies of 2022\n\nMy review of Apurva\n\nMy Worst Bollywood Movies of 2023\n\nMy review of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham…\n\n[Disclaimer: my Amazon links include an affiliate tag, and I may earn a commission on purchases made via those links.
