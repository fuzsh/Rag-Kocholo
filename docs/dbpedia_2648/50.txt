Shahid on his Bollywood journey

Speaking with News18 Showsha, Shahid said, “I have worked here for 20 years so I love my fraternity and I love our films. I feel very comfortable here. Having said that, I’m here to do good work. So on one hand you’re saying Hollywood, I’ll say the reverse thing… If somebody offers me a Tamil, Telugu or Malayalam movie and if I feel there’s a great role to do and it will satisfy me as an actor, I’ll go do that... If you are chasing performance and calibre, I wouldn’t want to go to Hollywood and do some trash. That’s not what I would want to do."

Shahid added, “Abhi mere ko Hollywood mein break mil gaya hai… kuch bhi kar lo… Nahi (Now I got a break in Hollywood, do anything, no)! There has to be a certain feeling from inside. You should feel inspired, excited and challenged to do something then language should not be a barrier. But language is a genuine thing. Some people are good at making a transition but some people are not. It’s not easy to do that…If I get an opportunity, I’d go anywhere. Just give me something exciting. I just did OTT. I don’t care."
