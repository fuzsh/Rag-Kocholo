Background: Neurosyphilis, also known as “general paresis of the insane,” at one time accounted for a large portion of admissions to state psychiatric facilities. With the introduction of antibiotics, neurosyphilis is now considered very rare.

Method: Chart review was performed on patients diagnosed with neurosyphilis who were admitted to a state psychiatric hospital in Raleigh, N.C., during 2002.

Results: We identified 3 cases of confirmed neurosyphilis, representing 0.1% of adult admissions, diagnosed in newly admitted psychiatric patients. None of the patients were immunocompromised. Response to antibiotic treatment was poor.
