A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was used to assess memory, language, attention, executive function, visuospatial ability, etc. In addition, cranial MRI were also obtained from the 3 patient groups.\n\nResults: Mild GPI showed a similar pattern of cognitive impairments in memory, language and executive function to mild AD, but a mixed pattern of dissimilarities to mild FTD. Mild GPI patients had more complaints and positive signs in the nervous system than mild AD patients, and cranial MRI results showed that mild GPI patients usually had atrophy of the medial temporal lobe."
