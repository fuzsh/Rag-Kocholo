        "text": "Thank you, that was an interesting read\n\nSome time ago, I found a death cert where the man died, in an asylum of GPI. It was a bit of a shock since this was a family of staunch Weslyans, relatively prominent citizens in colonial South Africa. He was fortunately unmarried. I did wonder how many in the family and wider society knew the real cause of his insanity and death.\n\nWhen I searched for info about the South African asylum that he died in, I found a paper about another man also admited to the asylum with GPI during the same period.The writer wears two hats; family genealogist and psychology professor. (So part academic paper/part family history). Her family story of the man's illness involved a fall from a horse and subsequent brain tumour.\n\nReconstructing Harry.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4006148/\n\nGreat-grandmother began acting erratically. It got worse and worse and eventually the institutionalized her. The family was eventually told that she had a brain tumor. But we know from family history that she was in a lot of pain and had to be strapped to the bed. For about 80 years we have all wondered. I finally obtained a copy of her death certificate and it reads that her cause of death was \"acute myocarditis,\" or heart inflamation. The contributory cause of death was \"Dementia Praecox.\" The Wikipedia definition is:\n\nDementia praecox (a \"premature dementia\" or \"precocious madness\") is a disused psychiatric diagnosis that originally designated a chronic, deteriorating psychotic disorder characterized by rapid cognitive disintegration, usually beginning in the late teens or early adulthood. Over the years, the term \"dementia praecox\" was gradually replaced by \"schizophrenia\", which remains in current diagnostic use.\n\nThis leaves a lot of questions. Was the dementia caused by a brain tumor? We would think that someone with a brain tumor would not live for very long but it seems that she survived for two years in the assylum and she had symptoms long before being admitted.\n\nWe can only speculate as the actual history for our great-granny. I wonder if the cert you found was written in competence or in a hurry?\n\nI believe that - like anything in life - the quality varies by the person doing the work. Did the doctor who wrote our death certificate know of her earlier history? Was an autopsy conducted? Was this diagnosis just a standard diagnosis given to many at the assylum (check box here)?\n\nMy mother lives in the same city and the assylum is still there (now a museum). I've urged her to go and see if she can get a copy of the records."
