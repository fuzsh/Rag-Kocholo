        "text": "There is a widely held clinical opinion that syphilis has disappeared. Contrary to this, there are sporadic cases being reported across the country. The classical cases of neurosyphilis have given way to the milder asymptomatic forms, making them even more difficult to be diagnosed. Conventional presentation of neurosyphilis such as tabes dorsalis and general paresis of insane are read in textbooks only and rarely encountered in clinical practice in the 21 st century.\n\nYou have requested \"on-the-fly\" machine translation of selected content from our databases.
