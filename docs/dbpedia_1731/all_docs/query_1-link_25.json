        "text": "Neurosyphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum bacteria. Neurosyphilis usually occurs about 10 to 20 years after a person is first infected with syphilis. Not everyone who has syphilis develops this complication.\n\nThere are four different forms of neurosyphilis:\n\nAsymptomatic (most common form)\n\nGeneral paresis\n\nMeningovascular\n\nTabes dorsalis\n\nAsymptomatic neurosyphilis occurs before symptomatic syphilis. Asymptomatic means there aren't any symptoms.\n\nYour health care provider will do a physical examination and may find the following:\n\nAbnormal reflexes\n\nMuscle atrophy\n\nMuscle contractions\n\nMental changes\n\nBlood tests can be done to detect substances produced by the bacteria that cause syphilis, this includes:\n\nTreponema pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA)\n\nVenereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test\n\nFluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS)\n\nRapid plasma reagin (RPR)\n\nWith neurosyphilis, it is important to test the spinal fluid for signs of syphilis.\n\nTests to look for problems with the nervous system may include:\n\nCerebral angiogram\n\nHead CT scan\n\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis\n\nMRI scan of the brain, brainstem, or spinal cord\n\nThe antibiotic penicillin is used to treat neurosyphilis. It can be given in different ways:\n\nInjected into a vein several times a day for 10 to 14 days.\n\nBy mouth 4 times a day, combined with daily muscle injections, both taken for 10 to 14 days.\n\nYou must have follow-up blood tests at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months to make sure the infection is gone. You will need follow-up lumbar punctures for CSF analysis every 6 months. If you have HIV/AIDS or another medical condition, your follow-up schedule may be different.\n\nNeurosyphilis is a life-threatening complication of syphilis. How well you do depends on how severe the neurosyphilis is before treatment. The goal of treatment is to prevent further deterioration. Many of these changes are not reversible."
