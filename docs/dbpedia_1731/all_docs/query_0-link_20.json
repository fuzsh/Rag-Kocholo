        "text": "Sir,\n\nWe have gone through the articles entitled “A patient presenting with early syphilis and features of general paralysis of insane (GPI) – An interesting case report in the 21st century!” by Bindu et al. and “A rare case of syphilitic Charcot joint involving left elbow” by Singh et al. published in the IJSTD and AIDS journal June–December 2023. We would like to make few points toward diagnosing late syphilis and neurosyphilis and briefing about etiopathogenesis and clinical features. We have our difference of opinion on these two articles but felt the younger generation should be briefed on neurosyphilis, a much-ignored topic.\n\nTreponema pallidum subspecies Pallidum invades central nervous system (CNS) early (8% at primary level to 25% or more at secondary level). There may be a meningeal reaction at this time that may irritate the adjoining parenchyma and causing symptoms mimicking late syphilis but these are transient. Treponema pallidum (TP) goes into latency with the onset of immunity and lies dormant. When opportunity arises with slackening of immunity, they reactivate. The immune system may recognize them a little late and launch counter-attack. The hallmark pathology of syphilis is endoarteritis (endarteritis) with subsequent thrombosis (obliteration of the lumen = obliterans), unlike early stages, where these are self-resolving, in late stages, Cell Mediated Immunity (CMI) takes a leading role. In an attempt to confine the TP, the area is surrounded by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages (epitheloid cells). Giant cells and fibroblasts follow. The inevitable action of tumor necrosis factor released by the cells now worsens the necrosis caused by endarteritis obliterans. This results in the central area of necrosis/caseation, and the typical granuloma are formed. In a highly vascular area like CNS, this reaction becomes diffuse. Thus, an early period of anoxia is followed by complete loss of the tissues that get replaced by fibrosis/gliosis.[1]\n\nClinically, the early period of anoxia causes irritability and hyperactivity of the affected neurons and they behave according to their original function. Frontal lobe neurons cause personality and behavior changes with delusions of grandiose and motor neurons cause Jacksonian-type seizures. However, as damage progresses, the neurons die out resulting in apathy, depression, and dementia and with motor cortex, it is a bilateral haphazard paralysis. Thus, paralysis is noticed in a demented person (general paresis of insane).[1,2]\n\nIn the spinal cord, the posterior nerve root ganglions are the seat of trouble. The initial anoxic irritation causes lightning pain crisis syndrome (when autonomic nervous system is also involved). When pathology is complete, the Ganglion dies and being the 1st-order neuron of sensory system, all sensations relayed through are gone. However, wasting occurs only in the posterior column of spinal cord because these are fibers originating from the Ganglion and continue up and when the ganglion dies, they undergo Wallerian degeneration. The lateral columns arise from the 2nd-order neurons in the posterior horn cells of the spinal cord and hence they survive. However, since they need to receive messages from the ganglion, they too become nonfunctional. The total loss of all sensations for the segments results in not only loss of pain but also loss of proprioception (joint sense). The corresponding segment can present with trophic ulcers, Charcot’s neuropathic joints and if sacral segment is involved, will cause overflow incontinence due to the absence of awareness to empty bladder.[1]\n\nModern opinion is not to differentiate neurosyphilis as Pprenchymatous and meningovascular because both elements are seen in all. The absence of seromarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) goes against the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. Treatment may stop progression but regeneration is unlikely.\n\nDuring early invasion of CNS, there can be transient inflammation including subclinical leptomeningitis. This can cause confusion, disorientation, and delusions in the patient, but can be reversible with appropriate treatment. The normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings suggest this. Anyway, that case is definitely one of neurosyphilis.\n\nAs per the case report, 66 years male, with a history of multiple unprotected men sex men (MSM) activity since the age of 20 years with known and casual male partners with history of happenstance treatment for various respiratory infections, undocumented details of previous venereal diseases, with history of peno-oral contact and he was the active partner, last sexual contact was peno-oral, 2 months ago with a known MSM partner. The occurrence of early syphilis along with neurosyphilis is well described by all textbooks. Basal lepto meningitis can occur in early syphilis and was mentioned in the literature. It is transient but irritates the adjoining parenchyma which can mimic symptoms of late manifestations. “Merrit Adam and Solomon” mentioned that GPI in early syphilis is impossible and unlikely. This patient may have senile dementia, chronic alcoholism, and psychiatric illness along with the occurrence of chancre and secondary syphilis lesions with CNS features but not GPI as claimed.\n\nCharcot joint results from loss of pain sensation from any cause. While in tabes and B12 neuropathy (subacute posterior column combined degeneration), the cause is at the spinal cord, in DM and Hansens, its peripheral. For elbow joint involvement, there should be involvement of lower cervical and upper thoracic segments involvement which has not been established by MRI. Furthermore, negative CSF-specific test goes against tabes. The history of trauma with lower thoracolumbar fracture cannot explain elbow involvement. Mere blood seropositivity should not be taken as the cause of the pathology. That patient needs more detailed study to rule out other causes.\n\nMerritt summarized Osler’s dictum on syphilis to “know paretic neurosyphilis in all its aspects and you know all of psychiatry.” The average time from infection to onset of paretic neurosyphilis is between 15 and 20 years, most untreated patients with general paresis died within 5 years after the onset of symptoms. 3%–9% of persons infected with syphilis, have tabes dorsalis, the average time from infection to onset of tabetic neurosyphilis is between 20 and 25 years.[2,3]\n\nMerritt, Adams, and Solomon penned “Neurosyphilis,” in 1946, “Among the consequences of the syphilitic infection, involvement of the CNS stands first in frequency and gravity. Considering this fact, it may seem odd that our knowledge of syphilis of the nervous system has been of such slow growth. Even today many fundamental problems remain unresolved…”[4] even after 80 years, key knowledge gaps and significant disagreements persist in neurosyphilis epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. In the post-COVID-19 days, syphilis incidence continues to increase in many parts of our country and around the world, it is hazardous, now more than ever, and we need to address these vigilantly.\n\nFinancial support and sponsorship\n\nNil.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest."
