With the introduction of antibiotics, neurosyphilis is now considered very rare. Method: Chart review was performed on patients diagnosed with neurosyphilis who were admitted to a state psychiatric hospital in Raleigh, N.C., during 2002. Results: We identified 3 cases of confirmed neurosyphilis, representing 0.1% of adult admissions, diagnosed in newly admitted psychiatric patients. None of the patients were immunocompromised. Response to antibiotic treatment was poor. Conclusions: Given the increase in primary and secondary syphilis reported in the 1980s and early 1990s, routine screening of psychiatric patients for the presence of syphilis should be considered.",
