        "text": "Excerpt: When one thinks of the history of psychiatry one inevitably recalls the forensic histories of Andrew Scull, the impressive scholarship of Roy Porter and, no doubt, the revisionist history of Michel Foucault. In this edited collection, Greg Eghigian attempts none of this. Through 55 excerpts of original texts (primary sources) we are presented with a panoramic view of the diverse experiences, understandings, and responses relating to phenomena that historicallyfall under the names madness, lunacy, insanity, and mental illness. In his brief introduction, Eghigian is careful not to influence or bias the reader in her appraisal of the texts and through a series of disclaimers sets the mood he considers appropriate for the ensuing foray in to the history of psychiatry. Thus, he reminds us that the book does not attempt a historical narrative, nor should the texts included be taken as a justification for one or other broad conception (e.g. social/ biological/ spiritual) of insanity. As he puts it, ‘‘the documents presented here are meant to inspire interpretation, discussion, and debate about how madness has historically been imagined, talked about, and handled.’’\n\nConvulsive therapy (COT) is a major European contribution to the psychiatric armamentarium and biological psychiatry. COT was introduced in psychiatry by László Meduna, a Hungarian neuropsychiatrist. All subsequent publications about the first patient treated with COT, Zoltán L (ZL), were based on Meduna’s papers and autobiography. After 4 years of catatonic stupor, ZL received camphor-induced COT which resulted in full remission and discharge from the institution. The aim of this paper is to reconstruct ZL’s case history from the original case notes—partly written by Meduna himself—which were recovered from the archives of the National Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology. The case notes show that ZL repeatedly received COT between 1934 and 1937, first with camphor and then with cardiazol induction. After the first course of COT the catatonic stupor was resolved and the psychotic symptoms subsided. However, the remission lasted for only a few months and was followed by a relapse. Despite repeated courses of COT, ZL never became symptom free again, was never discharged and died in the Institute in 1945. This historical case is discussed from both the diagnostic and therapeutic points of view, and an attempt is made to explain the possible reasons for the discrepancies found between Meduna’s account and ZL’s case notes.\n\nNimhans What is the relationship between colonialism and psychiatry (ëthe science of mindí) in India?î This is a huge question and here we do not have the space to untangle the entire conceptual complexity of the question let alone the history of this relationship. Our task will merely to explore some general points and to report on some preliminary findings from a project initiated circa mid-1990s in which the authors have been involved. One of the issues we are interested in investigating is the extent to which colonization, as a political enterprise of conquest and economic exploitation, had deeper ramifications for the indigenous traditions of science, technology and culture of care for the sick and diseased. Whether, that is, colonization brought with it its own tradition of medicine and science, which it imposed on the colonized regions. Or whether, colonization interrupted the traditional knowledge-systems, which led to their radical decline, disturbing the balance of medico-scientific development within the extant traditional framework? And perhaps a third possibility: whether there was happy blending, intermarriage and hybrid fecundation of the two traditions at encounterñi.e. between tradition and modernityñthat made for a regenerative nexus between science and colonization. 1 What are ethical or moral ramifications of such a ëprogressíñor be it regressóin civilization terms? We are interested in exploring these questions in relation to the arrival and growth of the discourse of psychiatry in India, with a particularly focus on the South, especially the principality of Mysore (narrowing down to the metropolis of Bangalore) during the British commercial and administrative presence in India. A caveat should be registered at the very start in respect of the tendencyó already transgressed in the opening paragraphóof thinking of psychiatry as though it were a discipline very much like or alongside physical and life-sciences, or even medicine, which diagnoses and treats physical illness. The point is that, as writers like Michel Foucault have been at pains to argue, psychiatry is a discourse of much recent origin in seventeen century Europe. It conjures itself out of the emergent alienation of the ësubjectí, disjunctured from Late Middle Ages notion of the redemptive ësoulí or psyche, and the repressed confines of the asylum culture with its punitive measures for the supposed delinquents that was rampant through this period even as it was"
