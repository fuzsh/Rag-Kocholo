Objective: General paresis of the insane is a late and severe form of neurosyphilis characterized by nonspecific neuropsychiatric symptoms. There are a limited number of case reports of mood disorders presenting in neurosyphilis, with depressive illness being the most common. Methods: We performed a literature review of case reports of secondary bipolar disorder induced by syphilitic infection. Results: Herein reported is a case of a 53-year-old woman who initially presented with symptoms of mania and depression, mimicking bipolar disorder, but was subsequently diagnosed with general paresis of the insane. Conclusion: The present case report emphasizes that if a substantial delay occurs in syphilis diagnosis and management, the patient may have a very poor prognosis.
