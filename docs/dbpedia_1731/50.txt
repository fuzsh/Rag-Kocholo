General paresis, or general paralysis of the insane, or paralytic dementia, was a severe affliction of the brain first diagnosed in the early 19th century and originally attributed to moral failings. In the 1880s physicians established a link to syphilis (a biological cause, but certainly involving moral failings!), and in the 20th century various medicines, culminating in penicillin, were found effective in treating the condition. Before that, g.p.i. had a 100% fatality rate, and it filled countless beds in psychiatric hospitals.

Gifford observes that medical students sometimes used the term as joking slang for mere eccentricity, and Slote cites Eric Partridge's Dictionary of Slang to that effect. Arguments have been made, howeverânotably by Kathleen Ferrisâthat Joyce did suffer from advanced syphilis. The mental illness of his daughter Lucia was reportedly diagnosed as schizophrenia in the 1930s, and Ferris acknowledges that that condition could account for some of her symptoms. But syphilitic paresis accounts for more, she suggests, and can be caused by spirochetes transmitted in utero (106-11). Lucia once told her father âthat she had syphilisâ (111). Ferris sees the evidence of this disease in Joyce's fictional offspring as well: Stephen and Bloom, she argues, between them display an assortment of symptoms (stiff walk, bad eyesight, digestive problems, hallucinations) that might be caused by syphilis.
