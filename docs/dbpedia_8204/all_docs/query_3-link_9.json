        "text": "Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a common flavor additive that has a reputation for being harmful to your health. While some people may be more sensitive to MSG than others, experts generally consider it safe, especially in smaller doses.\n\nMonosodium Glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer that has been widely used for roughly 100 years (1).\n\nIn addition to being naturally present in certain foods, it’s a common food additive in Chinese recipes, canned vegetables and soups, and other processed goods.\n\nFor years, MSG has been viewed as an unhealthy ingredient. However, newer research questions the accuracy of its purported adverse effects on human health.\n\nThis article examines MSG and what current evidence has to say about its health effects.\n\nMSG is short for monosodium glutamate.\n\nIt’s a flavor enhancer derived from L-glutamic acid, which is naturally present in many foods. L-glutamic acid is a nonessential amino acid, meaning that your body can produce it by itself and doesn’t need to get it from food (1).\n\nMSG is a white, odorless, crystalline powder commonly used as a food additive. In the food industry, it’s known as E621. It dissolves easily in water, separating into sodium and free glutamate (2).\n\nIt’s made by fermenting carb sources like sugar beet, sugar cane, and molasses (3).\n\nThere’s no chemical difference between the glutamic acid found naturally in some foods and that found in MSG. This means your body can’t differentiate between the two types (3, 4, 5).\n\nMSG has a specific taste known as umami — the fifth basic taste alongside sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. Umami has a meaty flavor that refers to the presence of proteins in food (2, 6).\n\nBesides MSG, other umami compounds include inosine 5’-monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine 5’-monophosphate (GMP) (1).\n\nMSG is popular in Asian cooking and used in various processed foods in the West. It’s estimated that people’s average daily intake is 0.3–1.0 grams (1, 7).\n\nFlavor enhancer\n\nThe flavor-enhancing effects of MSG are due to its umami taste, which induces salivary secretion. In other words, umami flavors make your mouth water, which can improve the taste of food (6).\n\nWhat’s more, studies show that umami substances can lower the desire to salt foods. Salt is another flavor enhancer (6, 8).\n\nIn fact, some research postulates that replacing some salt with MSG can reduce people’s sodium intake by approximately 3% without sacrificing flavor (1, 8).\n\nSimilarly, MSG may be used as a salt substitute in low sodium products like soups, prepackaged meals, cold meats, and dairy products (8).\n\nSummary\n\nMSG is derived from L-glutamic acid, an amino acid found in your body and many foods. It’s a popular food additive used to enhance flavor. It can be used to reduce overall sodium intake when used in place of salt.\n\nMSG got its bad reputation in the 1960s when Chinese-American doctor Robert Ho Man Kwok wrote a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine explaining that he got sick after consuming Chinese food.\n\nHe wrote that he believed his symptoms could have resulted from consuming either alcohol, sodium, or MSG. This sparked a host of misinformation about MSG, which was likely related to then-present biases against Chinese immigrants and their cuisine (9).\n\nThe letter led to the designation of Kwok’s symptoms as the “Chinese restaurant syndrome,” which later became the “MSG symptom complex” (MSC) (1).\n\nLater on, numerous studies backed MSG’s bad reputation, stating that the additive was highly toxic (1).\n\nHowever, current evidence questions the accuracy of previous research for several reasons, including (1):\n\na lack of adequate control groups\n\nsmall sample sizes\n\nmethodological flaws\n\na lack of dosage accuracy\n\nthe use of extremely high doses that far exceed those consumed in typical diets\n\nthe administration of MSG via routes with little to no relevance to oral dietary intakes, such as injections\n\nToday, health authorities like the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Food Safety Association (EFSA) consider MSG to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) (1, 4).\n\nThey have also determined an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 14 mg per pound (30 mg per kilogram) of body weight per day. This is far more than the amount you’d typically ingest following a normal diet (1, 4).\n\nSummary\n\nWhile racial biases and older research implied that MSG was a toxic additive, current evidence and health authorities recognize it as safe.\n\nMSG has been linked to obesity, metabolic disorders, brain toxicity, and MSC. Here’s what the current research has to say about these purported downsides (7).\n\nEffect on energy intake\n\nOlder evidence states that by making food taste better, MSG disrupts the signaling effect of the hormone leptin in your brain. Leptin is in charge of telling your body that you’ve had enough to eat. In turn, this is said to increase your calorie intake (7, 10).\n\nHowever, the current data on MSG’s effects on energy intake is contradictory. Some studies have found that it may reduce appetite, while others support the idea that its flavor-enhancing properties could lead to overeating (1, 6).\n\nThe contradictory results might have to do with the nutritional profile of a meal. For example, eating MSG-enhanced, high protein meals has been linked to increased feelings of fullness, while this link hasn’t been observed with high carb meals (1).\n\nHowever, this could also be because protein is the most filling macronutrient — it might not have anything to do with the MSG content (1).\n\nOther studies note that eating MSG-enriched meals could cause you to eat fewer calories at subsequent meals and reduce your energy intake from non-MSG-enriched and savory, high fat foods (1, 11).\n\nUltimately, more research on the connection between MSG and energy intake is needed.\n\nObesity and metabolic disorders\n\nMSG has been associated with an increased risk of metabolic disorders, primarily due to animal studies that have linked the additive to insulin resistance, high blood sugar levels, and diabetes (2, 7).\n\nHowever, previous research has used imprecise methods for determining MSG consumption, such as injections instead of oral doses. This could lead to effects on the brain that are not associated with dietary intake (1, 2, 12).\n\nWhat’s more, the current data is contradictory. For instance, newer animal studies have found an association between umami substances and anti-obesity effects. In contrast, other animal and human studies show no effect on body weight (6, 12).\n\nWhile it appears that typical dietary MSG intakes are unlikely to influence body weight or fat metabolism, more human studies are needed (12).\n\nEffect on brain health\n\nGlutamate plays many important roles in brain function. For starters, it acts as a neurotransmitter — a chemical substance that stimulates nerve cells to transmit signals (1, 2).\n\nSome studies claim that MSG can lead to brain toxicity by causing excessive glutamate levels in the brain to overstimulate nerve cells, resulting in cell death (2, 7).\n\nHowever, dietary glutamate likely has little to no effect on your brain, as almost none of it passes from the gut into the blood or crosses the brain barrier (1, 4, 12, 13).\n\nIn fact, research shows that once ingested, MSG is completely metabolized in your gut. From there, it either serves as an energy source, is converted to other amino acids, or is used in the production of various bioactive compounds (1, 4).\n\nOverall, no compelling evidence suggests that MSG alters brain chemistry when consumed in normal amounts.\n\nSome people may be sensitive\n\nSome people may experience adverse effects from consuming MSG due to a condition called MSG symptom complex (MSC). It’s estimated to affect less than 1% of the general population (1).\n\nMSC is characterized by symptoms similar to those described by Dr. Kwok in his letter. They include weakness, flushing, dizziness, headache, numbness, muscle tightness, difficulty breathing, and even the loss of consciousness (1).\n\nThe threshold dose that causes short-term and mild symptoms in sensitive people appears to be 3 or more grams of MSG without food (1, 5).\n\nKeep in mind, though, that a 3-gram dose is a high one. A typical serving of an MSG-enriched food contains less than half a gram of the additive, so consuming 3 grams at one time is highly unlikely (5).\n\nSummary\n\nCurrent evidence debunks most of the beliefs that consider MSG harmful or dangerous. However, in some cases, research findings are contradictory, and further studies in humans are needed.\n\nMSG is naturally present in many different foods, especially those that are high in protein. It’s also added to ingredients and other foods during processing (1, 4).\n\nCommon foods that contain MSG are (1, 6, 14, 15):\n\nAnimal-based protein: chicken, beef, salmon, mackerel, scallops, crab, shrimp\n\nCheese: Parmesan, Emmenthal, cheddar, Roquefort\n\nVegetables: tomatoes, onions, cabbage, green peas, spinach, mushrooms, broccoli\n\nProcessed meats: pepperoni, bacon, pastrami, sausages, salami\n\nSauces and dressings: soy sauce, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, salad dressings\n\nPremade and packaged foods: canned soups, canned tuna, frozen meals, crackers, potato chips, flavored snacks\n\nCondiments: seasoning blends, rubs\n\nAdditionally, fast-food chains like McDonald’s, Chick-fill-A, and KFC use MSG to season menu items like fried chicken, chicken nuggets, and fries (16, 17, 18).\n\nSummary\n\nMSG is naturally present in many foods, including some cheeses, meats, and vegetables. It’s also added to some processed and fast-food items.\n\nMSG is a flavor-enhancing additive that’s also naturally present in many protein-rich foods, cheeses, and vegetables.\n\nAlthough it was considered a toxic ingredient during the 1960s, current evidence has dispelled that myth, indicating that MSG is safe when consumed in moderate amounts.\n\nStill, you shouldn’t eat excessively large doses or consume it if you experience adverse reactions.\n\nJust one thing\n\nTry this today: There’s no compelling reason to avoid MSG if you don’t experience side effects when consuming it.\n\nThat said, if you’d like to reduce your intake of added MSG, be sure to check the ingredient panel of packaged foods and condiments. The FDA requires that foods that contain this additive mention it on their packaging."
