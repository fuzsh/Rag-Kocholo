        "text": "Amino acid derivatives constitute a very broad family of ingredients with multiple functionalities. We have already treated some parts like biopeptides or lipoamino acids. Another particularly interesting family is glutamic acid derivatives, better known as\"acylglutamates\", which are of major interest as the basis for formulating foaming preparations of all kinds. These are remarkable surfactants. Virginie Gerenton, who has taken a lot of care of it in recent years, makes us travel in this universe. Thank you to her. Jean Claude Le Joliff\n\nAt the heart of lipoamino acid chemistry, acylglutamates aroused the real interest of European cosmetics in the late 1990s, for applications in rinse-off products. Recognized from a scientific point of view as soft multifunctional surfactants, these surfactants are the best in the world. hyper The active ingredients have many facets and are still very promising for the years to come.\n\nOriginally, Japanese researcher Kikunae Ikeda identified the taste umami (tasty) in 1908, as glutamate. He discovered that the kombu seaweed broth contained some, but also vegetables, meat, fish, fermented products. He patented the industrialization of a sodium glutamate seasoning under the name Ajinomoto and in 1908 associated himself with Saburosuke Suzuki, a Japanese industrialist, to produce and market his invention. Since then, sodium glutamate has been used in food as a flavour enhancer.\n\nIt was in the 1960s that important research was conducted on acylglutamates as mild anionic surfactants. The first grade of acylglutamate was launched by Ajinomoto in 1972 and used for the first time in a dermatological cleansing bread by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. in Japan.\n\nIn Europe, cosmetics manufacturers became interested in this chemistry in the mid-1990s. Beiersdorf has worked a lot on Sodium cocoyl glutamate, and was one of the first European groups to use it in its products put on the market in the mass distribution network. A new generation of hygiene products was born, more qualitative and respectful of the epidermis structure.\n\nDifferent approaches exist in the chemical industry, following the main Schotten-Baumann reaction: - separation with inorganic acid to remove salt and solvent followed by neutralization: the final product is of high purity but the process used requires several steps with high energy consumption ; - the salt is retained at the end of the process and the solvent is distilled: this is a more sustainable approach than the previous one but requires an additional step to the main reaction ; - salt and solvent are retained at the end of the industrial process: this is the most sustainable one-step approach. The choice of solvent is therefore essential and can, in the case of propanediol, bring additional benefits to acylglutamate, such as hydration or improving the solubility of formulations.\n\nAnother important point in this sustainable approach is the vegetable and renewable origin of the raw materials constituting an acylglutamate. The fatty acid comes from palm nut oil, RSPO (\"Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil\") if possible, or coconut oil. Glutamic acid comes from the fermentation of sugar beet molasses or wheat.\n\nGlutamic acid and fatty acids are physiological components of the skin and hair. Glutamic acid is an important amino acid of the NMF (Natural Moisturizing Factor) of the epidermis and a precursor of PCA, but also of proline and hydroxyproline, two essential amino acids in the synthesis of collagen and elastin. Keratin contains 15% glutamic acid.\n\nThis means that there will be no surfactant residues on the skin or hair, a specific and essential property of acylglutamates and acylamino acids in general. By applying these surfactants, the skin and hair are given back its physiological components.\n\nSodium cocoyl glutamate significantly improves the moisturizing effect of rinse-off formulations. It also reduces the adsorption of SLES (Sodium lauryl ether sulfate) on the skin and is a hydrophilic O/W emulsifier with the possibility of a cold process. It can therefore be used in rinsing products and not rinsed. The same applies to the lauroyl chain. These are the two greasiest chains currently used on the cosmetic market."
