        "text": "MSG stands for monosodium glutamate, also known as sodium glutamic acid or glutamate (an amino acid). Glutamate is produced in the human body and is even contained in breast milk, which is the main source of infant nutrition. Glutamate is also found in a variety of foods, including vegetables (examples: tomatoes) and protein foods such as meat, fish, and cheese.\n\nThis has to go back to the 1970s in the United States, when rumors circulated in the neighbourhood: “When eating in Chinese restaurants, due to excessive use of seasonings, it is easy for people to experience symptoms such as dry mouth, headaches, and discomfort.” This phenomenon is called Chinese Restaurant Syndrome. The community at the time could not identify the factors related to its occurrence, so MSG became a scapegoat. For years, studies conducted by medical research institutions have failed to show a conclusive link between MSG consumption and adverse effects on health.\n\nMany people also think that eating too much MSG will cause thirst, especially after eating at a restaurant or a stall outside. The fact is, many hawkers use different seasonings for cooking, so each of their foods has its own flavour. When a person eats different foods with different flavours, it is inevitable that sodium intake will increase, and foods high in sodium will cause people to feel thirsty. Pure MSG such as AJI-NO-MOTO® can actually help to reduce sodium intake. This is because it contains 2/3 less sodium compared to salt. In other words, using pure MSG to replace some salt in cooking can reduce sodium intake and at the same time, maintain the deliciousness of the food.\n\nBoth pure MSG and impure MSG (called counterfeit/fake MSG) can be found in the market.\n\nPure MSG must have purity more than 99%. AJI-NO-MOTO® is pure MSG, and it is listed as ‘pure’ on the packaging. Impure MSG may be mixed with sugar, salt, and other flavourings.\n\nThere is no limitation for the use of MSG as a food additive because scientific and regulatory bodies such as the Joint FAO / WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) placed MSG in the safest category of ‘Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) not specified’, based on extensive scientific data.\n\nAJI-NO-MOTO® and salt are different. AJI-NO-MOTO® gives the taste of Umami and its function is to enhance the taste of food. On the other hand, salt adds a salty taste. We encourage salt reduction by using AJI-NO-MOTO® to reduce sodium intake. For instance, instead of using 1 tsp of salt, you may replace ½ tsp of the salt with MSG. With this method, you can reduce the sodium content by 34% and still maintain the deliciousness of the dish."
