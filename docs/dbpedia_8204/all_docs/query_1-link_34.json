        "text": "Headaches and Migraines\n\nOne of the most commonly reported side effects of Ajinomoto is headaches or migraines. While not everyone is affected, some individuals are more sensitive to MSG and may experience these symptoms.\n\nSweating and Flushing\n\nSome people report experiencing excessive sweating and flushing, particularly in the face and neck area, after consuming foods containing MSG.\n\nAlso Read: MSG and lead in Maggi is harming everyone, including Preity Zinta\n\nNausea and Vomiting\n\nFor certain individuals, consuming foods with a high MSG content may lead to feelings of nausea and, in extreme cases, vomiting.\n\nChest Pain and Heart Palpitations\n\nThere have been reports of chest pain and heart palpitations associated with MSG intake in sensitive individuals. It's essential to seek medical attention if these symptoms occur.\n\nNeurological Symptoms\n\nMSG is time and again linked to various neurological symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and dizziness. However, scientific evidence on this is inconclusive and needs more studies.\n\nMinimising The Risk Of Ajinomoto\n\nAjinomoto is not just used in street food, but also in a number of packaged and processed foods. If you are concerned about the potential side effects of Ajinomoto, you can take the following steps:\n\nRead Food Labels: Check ingredient lists for foods that contain MSG or related compounds like hydrolysed vegetable protein, autolysed yeast, or sodium caseinate.\n\nCook at Home: Preparing your meals at home gives you control over the ingredients and allows you to limit the use of MSG.\n\nAsk at Restaurants: If you dine out, don't hesitate to ask whether the restaurant uses MSG in their dishes. Many establishments now offer MSG-free options.\n\nLimit Processed Foods: Reducing your consumption of highly processed foods can help you reduce your intake of Ajinomoto.\n\nIn conclusion, Ajinomoto, or MSG, is a topic of debate in the nutrition community, with some labelling it as toxic, and others calling it safe to use. However, it's important to note that almost no one calls it healthy or cites its health benefits. So giving it up is not going to dampen your health in any way. However, As with any dietary or health-related topic, individual responses can vary, and it's best to make decisions that align with your personal health and well-being."
