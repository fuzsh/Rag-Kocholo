        "text": "Ajinomoto, commonly known as MSG or monosodium glutamate, has been a staple in Chinese cuisine worldwide, contributing a unique umami flavor to dishes. Despite its widespread use, many remain uninformed about its origins and composition.\n\nInvention Of MSG\n\nThe MSG journey began in 1908 when Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda discovered the umami taste while savoring a bowl of Kombu dashi. Analyzing the dish, Ikeda identified glutamic acid, an amino acid, as the source of the savory flavor. He coined the term “umami,” meaning the ‘essence of deliciousness’ in Japanese, and developed a seasoning called Ajinomoto.\n\nHow Is Ajinomoto or MSG Seasoning Made?\n\nAjinomoto is crafted from sodium and glutamic acid, the most common naturally occurring amino acids. MSG is produced using plant-based ingredients like sugar cane, sugar beets, sodium, cassava, or corn. The estimated daily intake of MSG ranges from 0.3 to 1.0 grams, according to an article in EXCLI Journal titled ‘Extensive use of monosodium glutamate: A threat to public health?’\n\nIs MSG Harmful?\n\nIn the 1960s, MSG gained negative publicity when a Chinese-American doctor, Robert Ho Man Kwok, attributed his sickness to Chinese food consumption, specifically MSG. The term “Chinese restaurant syndrome” emerged, later evolving into the “MSG symptom complex.” However, a systematic review in the Journal of Headache and Pain titled ‘Does monosodium glutamate really cause headache?’ highlighted the misinformation, linking it to biases against Chinese cuisines.\n\nThe article ‘A review of the alleged health hazards of monosodium glutamate’ from HHS Author Manuscripts emphasized that reputable health authorities, including the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the European Food Safety Association (EFSA), recognize MSG as generally safe."
