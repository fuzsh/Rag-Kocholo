        "text": "In addition to the four basic tastes, sweet, bitter, salty and sour, there is another that the Japanese call umami. ''It is delicious,'' said Katsuhiro Utada, president of the Ajinomoto Company. It has no English translation, but it is widely known by its chemical name: monosodium glutamate, or M.S.G.\n\nThis crystalline flavor enhancer -discovered in seaweed at the turn of the century by Kikuae Ikeda, a chemist who was Ajinomoto's founder, and now made from cane molasses -formed the basis for what has become an international producer of food products with earnings last year of $41 million on sales of $1.8 billion.\n\nMoreover, the chemical research that has made Ajinomoto Japan's best-known food additive company has led the company to undertake an aggressive expansion into biotechnology, drug development and cancer research.\n\nCell Fusion Technology\n\nThe company is still heavily dependent on internationally marketed food additives, mostly M.S.G., and domestically marketed foods like soups and low-calorie mayonnaise. But the emphasis at Ajinomoto is now on developing an American base for its new cell fusion technology. ''This is the business of the future,'' Mr. Utada said in an interview in Tokyo.\n\nUsing cell fusion technology, Ajinomoto has improved upon the speed with which amino acids can be produced. The company believes this gives it an advantage in the hectic research and development competition among Japanese, American and European companies.\n\nThe process developed by Ajinomoto allows it to mass-produce more than 20 different kinds of amino acids in an almost pure state at very low cost. Cell fusion technology is also free from any official control in Japan, so it is commercially far more feasible than government-controlled gene recombination technology.
