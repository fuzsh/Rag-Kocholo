It is also known to increase and regulate blood sugar levels. Therefore, it is especially important during more rigorous workouts and special diets.\n\nAJINOMOTO® valine, which promotes muscle growth, acts as an energy source and facilitates muscle tissue repair. What's more, it can help suppress appetite, regulate the immune system and metabolism.\n\nAJINOMOTO® Glutamine, which allows for faster regeneration process after training and ensures significantly better recovery. What's more, it is calorie-free, which is perfect for those who exercise while on a diet.\n\nVitamin B6 which plays an important role in the transformation and utilization of carbohydrates, fats and proteins and is crucial in physical activity as it promotes the release of glycogen, energy stored in the liver and muscles.\n\nAlanine that allows for improved athletic performance by reducing fatigue and increasing endurance in high-intensity workouts by increasing the period of time before muscle exhaustion.\n\nIn addition, taking AMINO PURE 4:1:1 provides numerous benefits over simple protein supplements available on the market. Branched-chain amino acids, so called because of the branching of their chemical structure, are essential for human beings and become even more so in the athletic arena, particularly in power sports such as bodybuilding.\n\nAjinomoto®-certified purity and quality.\n\nBranched-chain amino acid supplements are one of the most commonly used products among athletes and sportsmen. Unlike other products on the market, which focus on \"technological\" features while neglecting more essential and no less important aspects, we at Tsunami Nutrition have decided to focus onhigh quality raw materials to offer all our customers BCAA supplements produced with superior ingredients.\n\nOur choices are always meticulous and geared towards being able to offer our customers the best of products, which is why we decided to use only certified high quality Ajinomoto® branded raw materials for our AMINO PURE 4:1:1 Ajinomoto® supplements .\n\nAjinomoto® is one of the companies with the longest history of research and development in food. In addition, it was one of the first companies in the world to experiment with the use of fermentation to produce selected amino acids, an entirely natural process that excludes the use of animal products.\n\nAn ongoing commitment, ours, to offer the highest level of quality and repay the trust of those who choose our products.\n\nAMINO PURE 4:1:1 Ajinomoto® is a product made using selected amino acids to guarantee purity and quality, in a patented formula with Ajinomoto® certification.\n\nAn absolute guarantee of excellence, Ajinomoto's Ajipure certification ensures a number of specific qualities of the raw material:\n\nA natural product with no additives and no synthetic formulation;\n\nHigh control of impurities;\n\nA 100% plant-based formulation;\n\nPurity and fineness to ensure optimal absorption by the body.\n\nAjinomoto amino acids are obtained by fermentation of carbohydrates of plant origin, a process from which animal sources are totally excluded: this ensures, for all vegetarian and vegan athletes, 100% safe use.\n\nAjinomoto amino acids assure vegan athletes 100% purity and optimal absorption through extra milling of the product up to 7 times.\n\nAjinomoto's patent ensures 99% / 100% purity, with impurities being removed up to 6 times compared to normal processing of other amino acids. The purity and extra fineness of the product, achieved through a process that can include up to 7 milling steps, ensures total absorption and thus optimal nutritional results.\n\nPurity and safety of raw materials are guaranteed by Ajinomoto's deep-rooted experience as one of the first companies to experiment with the plant fermentation process to obtain pure and selected amino acids through all-natural processes that do not involve the use of animal products.\n\nThe high degree of fineness and purity of Ajinomoto amino acids guarantees not only a high level of quality, but also of the increased ease and speed of absorption.\n\nAjinomoto® AMINO PURE 4:1:1amino acids are a VEGAN OK, GLUTEN-FREE AND lactose-free product.\n\nBenefits of Amino Pure 4:1:1 Ajinomoto®?\n\nBranched-chain amino acids, so called because of the ramifications of their chemical structure, are essential for human beings and become even more so in the field of sports, particularly in power sports since it is a support for sports performance, as it stimulates the increase of hypertrophic muscle mass, stimulates protein synthesis and triggers a series of mechanisms that lead to better and faster building of lean muscle mass."
