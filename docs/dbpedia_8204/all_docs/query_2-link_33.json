        "text": "The Ajinomoto Group was built on the principle of “Eat Well, Live Well,” reflecting our founder’s wish to promote well-balanced meals that are full of flavor and nutrition.\n\nDriven by the desire to improve the health of the Japanese people, University of Tokyo scientist Dr. Kikunae Ikeda developed the first umami seasoning, monosodium glutamate, or MSG, in 1908, with the intent of enhancing the deliciousness of nutritious foods. Shortly thereafter, AJI-NO-MOTO® was launched, and a company grounded on the ideal of “Eat Well, Live Well” was born. To this day, we continue to create nutrition innovations to meet the needs of people around the world through extensive research and our unique approach to unlocking the power of amino acids, essential substances for life.\n\nOver the years, we have worked to evaluate and discover the benefits of amino acids and how they can be used in different ways to create delicious meals and to improve society by promoting growth, development and recovery; supporting physical health; and aiding advancements in science and technology."
