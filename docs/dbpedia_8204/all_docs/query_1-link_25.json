        "text": "People have come across the name Ajinomoto or MSG, commonly used in Chinese food. However, hardly anyone knows the details about it. This article will provide an explanation of every bit of MSG. Read below.\n\nYou must have often heard that ajinomoto is widely used in Chinese food all around the world. Although this seasoning is widely used, people have very little knowledge about it. Also known as MSG or monosodium glutamate, ajinomoto is a flavour-enhancing seasoning. Just as salt adds saltiness and sugar adds sweetness, MSG adds a fifth flavour—umami—to the dish.\n\nFor the uninitiated, umami is a category of taste in food besides sweet, sour, and bitter. In 2002, scientists identified umami taste receptors on the human tongue. It can be most associated with savouriness. In Japanese, umami means ‘essence of deliciousness.’ MSG contributes to this umami taste in Chinese dishes all around the world. However, people are curious to know the history and composition of the seasoning. This article will help you get the information you need.\n\nIn 1908, MSG came to the spotlight with a bowl of Kombu dashi. While indulging in the dish, the Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda discovered that there exists a flavour beyond sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. He started analysing the composition of Kombu dashi and discovered the distinct savoury flavour that came from the presence of glutamic acid, a type of amino acid according to HHS Author Manuscript in a study called ‘A review of the alleged health hazards of monosodium glutamate.’ He named the taste umami."
