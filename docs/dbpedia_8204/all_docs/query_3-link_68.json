        "text": "In early 2017, one hour after my husband’s grandfather died, I met him, his brother, and a friend at a restaurant in Chinatown. I was a little bit drunk because I had come from another place, sad about their grandfather, whom I’d known, and nervous because I was highly uncomfortable speaking about painful emotions. Anyway, I ate like I was a horse, ingesting three-quarters of a family-sized plate of king crab noodles and spent the evening loudly vomiting. Damn you, MSG!!! I shook my fist in the air, blaming a chemical and not my extreme emotional deficiency.\n\nI grew up, like millions of other Americans who hear something once and then believe it without further interrogation for the rest of their lives, with the idea that MSG—monosodium glutamate—was a chemical put onto Chinese food to give my uncle an optical migraine. A frequent migraine sufferer myself, I considered it wise to avoid in theory (though basically nothing in practice). But I was ignoring a vast library of research and food writing that would have debunked the offensive misperception and allowed me to enjoy a lifetime’s worth of much tastier food.\n\nAt the Conrad Hotel in downtown Manhattan at the end of September, I was told over and over again how wrong I was.\n\n“We’re spinning at tens of thousands of miles per hour right?” Andrew Zimmern, star of the Travel Channel’s Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, points out from the podium at the front of the hotel ballroom. “Hurtling through space, orbiting the Sun. I mean, good lord. That’s the science, we know that’s what’s going on, but that’s not the appearance… I think a lot of people don’t understand that how things look or the way they’ve heard about them is not necessarily the way things really are.”\n\nZimmern was MCing the first annual World Umami Forum, a conference hosted by MSG manufacturer Ajinomoto as a kind of American re-introduction to the needlessly-controversial product. He was trying to prove a point about science (what you think you know isn’t necessarily true), but more specifically, about MSG (Americans think it’s bad, but actually it’s very good). And even though he was getting at it in a roundabout way, it’s still worth saying again, because after decades of junk science, and then good science disproving the junk science, and chefs and food writers promoting the good science , plus the reality that most of the world uses MSG every day without incident, most of us still can’t get over the idea that even a taste of the additive will somehow blind you, or make you tingle, or faint, or get super cranky.\n\nIn 1908, a nice, round 110 years ago, Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda puzzled over the question of what made kombu dashi, seaweed soup, so uniquely rich and meaty. From the soup, he was able to isolate a crystallized version of glutamic acid—often found in the body as glutamate—an amino acid responsible for the taste. He coined the resulting flavor umami, after the Japanese word for delicious, umai, and it was soon acknowledged as the fifth unique taste, along with sweet, salty, bitter, and sour. The next year, Ikeda added sodium and invented monosodium glutamate, a white, salt-like powder that had no odor, but, when added to food, produced that same intense flavor. He took the invention to Saburo Suzuki, Jr., the head of a company called Ajinomoto, and the two began to mass-produce it. Today, Ajinomoto is a $10 billion food corporation, MSG is viewed as major innovation and regularly used in cooking around the world without incident—except for, still, the majority of the United States. That’s why they had this conference.\n\n“All eyes are on the U.S. market, it’s one of the greatest sources of information particularly regarding food, food policy, nutrition, and trends. MSG has been used around the world as ‘umami seasoning’ for more than 100 years, but maintains a negative stigma in the U.S., even though it’s completely safe to consume,” Ajinomoto President Takaaki Nishii told Esquire.com. “We believe now is the time to represent the facts and correct long-held misconceptions to show people that MSG is not only safe, but a great way to add flavor and reduce salt.”\n\nAccording to Nishii, Ajinomoto aims to become a top ten global food company by 2020, and is investing $10 million on PR aimed at helping people “have access to the truth about their food.”\n\nDuring the forum, food historians, scientists, and chefs explained to us (mostly dietitians and members of the media), from every conceivable angle, how MSG had fallen out of favor in America. We learned how MSG was being used fairly regularly, especially in Chinese restaurants (and, unexpectedly to me, in army rations), until a 1968 New England Journal of Medicine letter entitled, “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome,” suggested that the additive might be causing the author's heart palpitations and numbness. We learned that several poorly-constructed studies had been used to bolster MSG’s negative reputation, by testing the additive in people who already were convinced they had negative reactions to MSG, and that the stigma had been allowed to persist, unchecked and un-investigated, for nearly six decades.\n\nWe heard from the ultra-charismatic Ali Bouzari, Chief Science Officer of Pilot R&D, a food “innovation and development” company, who dropped millennial-accessible analogies including, “Umami is not Japanese; Japan is just the dope studio where umami dropped its first mixtape,” and, “To be terrified of monosodium glutamate is like the FCC trying to ban the letter ‘F.’” Bouzari explained the chemistry behind how glutamate occurs naturally in high levels in umami-rich foods like tomatoes and parmesan cheese, and then even higher in things that have been fermented or aged. Kumiko Ninomiya, director of the Umami Information Center and self-described “Umami Mommy,” led us through a taste test in which we compared vegetable soup with vegetable soup with a small amount of MSG in it, which resulted in a literal cacophony of gasps (the plain soup tasted like bath water; the MSG-soup was not only edible, but delicious. I began to dream of a future in which I, a notoriously inept chef, could wow my idiot American friends by covertly slipping MSG into cups of water and calling it bone broth.)\n\nWe learned that umami lasts longer than other flavors and urges the production of significantly more saliva, meaning that attendees, who were flooded with umami at every turn, were practically slobbering all over ourselves. We learned that currently, there isn't any science to explain why the umami taste is so good, but it might have something to do with the presence of glutamate in human breast milk.\n\nAnd although some speakers screamed spon-con slightly more than others (we heard from Lisa Watson, executive director of The Glutamate Association, which is “an association of manufacturers, distributors, and users of glutamic acid and its salts,” particularly MSG, as well as some representatives from Ajinomoto itself), others, like food science writer Harold McGee and historian Sarah Lohman traced, independent of professional associations, how public opinion had coalesced against the long-maligned flavor enhancer. (Lohman pointed out that since in America, MSG is used in highly-processed, unhealthy foods like Doritos, we began to associate MSG as being unhealthy in and of itself.)\n\nDuring the cocktail hour, we ate different umami-rich foods (pesto-y breadsticks, little beef sliders, different kinds of carpaccio); we drank an umami cocktail, called “The 1908” in honor of the anniversary, made with gin, sherry, anchovy stuffed olives, bitters, sundried tomato, and MSG (these were less excellent and represented, perhaps, an over-enthusiasm for the theme). There was a photo booth where you could pose with Zimmern feeding you a grasshopper. During dinner (which started at 5 p.m.), we were served an unbelievable amount of wine, along with Zimmern’s Garides Saganaki, a Greek dish with shrimp, tomatoes, wine, chiles, cheese, and a salt-MSG mixture, and a dry aged ribeye with cacio e pepe risotto from Iron Chef alum Marc Forgione, who also stopped by to do a demo and take photographs.\n\nThroughout the conference, I tasked myself with attempting to pinpoint the taste of umami with English words: it was sharp, beefy, savory, round, complex. At the urging of a tablemate, I licked some MSG off my hand like the salt in a tequila shot. I tasted an echo in a sea cave, like I was wrapping my tongue in a velvet stole.\n\nConference attendees were given a swag bag, featuring, preciously, two little AjiPanda MSG shakers. I now keep one in my kitchen, where I’ve mixed it in eggs and in vegetables, and one at my desk. Recently, I tried sprinkling it on a largely flavorless salad that I couldn’t bring myself to eat. It helped."
