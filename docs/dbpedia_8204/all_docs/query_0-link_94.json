        "text": "AJI-NO-MOTO umami monosodium glutamate 99+% purity is a high-quality product widely used as a flavor enhancer. Also known as E621, monosodium glutamate is used in many cuisines worldwide to improve the taste and aroma of dishes. The AJI-NO-MOTO powder or small white pearls add a distinctive umami flavor to dishes, often referred to as the fifth taste, alongside sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Monosodium glutamate is perfect for meat dishes, soups, sauces, snacks, and many other food products. With its purity and quality, AJI-NO-MOTO umami ensures consistent and intense flavor experiences, highlighting the natural flavors of ingredients. Monosodium Glutamate Aji-No-Moto, also known as MSG, is a substance added to foods to enhance flavor and improve taste experiences. It is a natural amino acid found in many foods such as meat, vegetables, and cheese. Aji-No-Moto, being one of the popular commercial products containing monosodium glutamate, is widely used in Asian cuisines as a flavor enhancer. Its use is versatile, covering cooked, stewed, fried, and even raw dishes, aiming to highlight and sharpen the natural taste of ingredients. Adding Aji-No-Moto Monosodium Glutamate to dishes can introduce a deeper and more complex flavor, which is particularly beneficial in dishes with various ingredients. However, it is important to use it in moderation. Many chefs and consumers appreciate Aji-No-Moto for its ability to highlight the natural flavors of dishes, but its use can also be a topic of discussion due to potential allergic reactions in some individuals. Therefore, it is always worth being aware and moderate in adding monosodium glutamate to dishes. Pure monosodium glutamate is odorless and tasteless on its own. When added to dishes, it enhances the taste and aroma. The optimal concentration is 0.2% -0.8% by weight of the product."
