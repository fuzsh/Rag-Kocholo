        "text": "1. What is AJI-NO-MOTO® made of?\n\nAJI-NO-MOTO® is made of natural ingredients such as cane, cassava, corn, wheat, rice and sago. In Indonesia, AJI-NO-MOTO® is produced from molasses and cassava.\n\n2. How AJI-NO-MOTO® is made?\n\nAJI-NO-MOTO® is made from fermentation of molasses or tapioca starch by using microbes. Fermentation is a similar process in the production of soy sauce, cheese or tapai. In this process, first glucose in the molasses or tapioca starch is modified into glutamic acid with help from microbes. The resulting glutamic acid is then processed into crystals of MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) and purified into ready-to-use crystals. The processes involved after glutamic acid is obtained are similar to that in the production of cane sugar or cooking oil. For decades, scientists have conducted numerous researches on the safety of MSG. Health supervisory institutions around the world, including the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, had confirmed the use of MSG as safe and not causing side effects. Feel free to use AJI-NO-MOTO® to make your foods taste better.\n\n3. Is AJI-NO-MOTO® (MSG) harmful to health?\n\nAJI-NO-MOTO® (MSG) does not incur harm to human’s health.

The trivial name of MSG for people in Indonesia is “mecin” or “micin”. 3. Our body effectively digests MSG. For decades, scientists have conducted numerous researches on the safety of MSG.
