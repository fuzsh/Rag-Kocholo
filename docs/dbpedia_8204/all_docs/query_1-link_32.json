        "text": "Monosodium glutamate, commonly known as MSG or Ajinomoto, is a flavour enhancer that is often used in cooking. It is a white, crystalline powder that dissolves easily in water and can be found in various foods. While it is widely used in many parts of the world, it is also controversial due to its potential side effects.\n\nIn India, too, MSG, or ajinomoto, is a common food additive used in many processed foods and restaurant dishes. Some popular brands that use MSG or Ajinomoto include Maggi, Knorr, Top Ramen, Ching’s Secret, and Yippee. MSG is made from glutamic acid, which is a naturally occurring amino acid that is found in many foods, including tomatoes, mushrooms, cheese, and meat. However, the levels of glutamic acid in these foods are much lower than the amounts found in MSG. The process of making MSG involves fermenting starch, sugar beets, sugar cane, or molasses with the bacteria Corynebacterium glutamicum. The resulting mixture is then purified and converted into a crystalline form, which is the MSG that is used in food.\n\nMSG is commonly used in Asian cuisine, particularly Chinese and Japanese dishes. It is also found in processed foods such as canned soups, salad dressings, and snack foods. Some fast-food chains have also been known to use MSG in their food. It is important to note that not all processed foods contain MSG, and it is not always listed as an ingredient. MSG can also be listed under other names, such as hydrolyzed protein or autolyzed yeast extract. While MSG is generally recognised as safe, some people may experience side effects after consuming it. The most common side effect is a headache, but other symptoms can include flushing, sweating, chest pain, nausea, and weakness. These symptoms are collectively known as ‘Chinese restaurant syndrome’, although they can occur after consuming MSG in any type of food.\n\nMaggi, a popular instant noodle brand, was at the centre of a controversy in 2015 when it was found to contain high levels of lead and MSG. The controversy led to a ban on Maggi noodles in India, and the brand had to recall millions of packets of noodles from stores across the country. The incident led to increased scrutiny of food manufacturers and raised questions about the safety of processed foods in India. The use of MSG in Indian cuisine is also controversial. While some chefs and food manufacturers argue that it enhances the flavour of dishes, others criticise it for being an unhealthy and potentially harmful additive. The controversy has led to a growing interest in traditional Indian cooking methods, which emphasise the use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients and natural spices. As per the FSSAI guidelines, MSG is not permitted in more than 50 food products, including pasta and noodles (dried products).\n\nThere is no conclusive evidence linking MSG to any specific disease. However, some people may be sensitive to MSG and experience adverse reactions after consuming it. Additionally, some studies have suggested a possible link between MSG consumption and health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and neurological disorders. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. Several studies have been conducted on the potential health effects of MSG consumption. While there is no conclusive evidence linking MSG to any specific disease, some studies have suggested a possible connection between MSG consumption and health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and neurological disorders. In a study published in the journal Appetite, researchers found that participants who consumed a high-MSG diet had a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.\n\nAnother study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people who consumed MSG in their food had a higher risk of being overweight or obese. A review of studies conducted on MSG and its effects on neurological health, published in the journal Nutrients, concluded that there is evidence to suggest that MSG consumption may contribute to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. However, the authors noted that more research is needed to confirm these findings. While many people compare MSG with table salt, these are two different compounds with different chemical compositions. Table salt is composed of sodium chloride, while MSG is made from glutamic acid, a type of amino acid. MSG is used primarily as a flavour enhancer, while salt is used to add flavour and also as a preservative.\n\nMSG consumption can be particularly harmful for children and pregnant women. A study published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology found that infants who were exposed to high levels of MSG in the womb had a higher risk of developing allergies later in life. Another study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives found that pregnant women who consumed high levels of MSG had a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes. MSG has also been linked to male infertility. A study published in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that men who consumed high levels of MSG had a lower sperm count and a lower percentage of viable sperm.\n\nMSG has been criticised for its role in the food industry. Many food manufacturers use MSG as a cheap way to enhance the flavour of their products, and some use it to mask the taste of inferior ingredients. The use of MSG has led to the development of highly processed, unhealthy foods that are high in salt, sugar, and fat. The prevalence of MSG in processed foods has also made it difficult for consumers to avoid it.\n\nIn conclusion, while MSG is generally recognised as safe, some people may be sensitive to it and experience adverse reactions. Research suggests that MSG consumption may contribute to health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and neurological disorders. It is important for consumers to read food labels carefully and to cook meals from scratch using fresh ingredients to avoid MSG. The use of MSG in processed foods has also led to the development of unhealthy foods that are high in salt, sugar, and fat. The food industry needs to consider the health of consumers when formulating their products."
