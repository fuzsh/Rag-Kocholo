        "text": "ONTARIO, Calif., Dec. 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Ajinomoto Foods North America is bringing its authentic Japanese-style Hane Gyoza to the U.S. The Japanese-style dumplings will be available starting this month at Costco locations across the Northwest.\n\nGyoza is a traditional Japanese delicacy. From a game-day feast of heavy appetizers to a \"semi-homemade dinner party,\" these Japanese-style dumplings can elevate any meal.\n\n\"We are excited to share a culinary masterpiece that reflects a commitment to excellence, authenticity, and the artistry of Japanese cuisine,\" states Taro Komura, Chief Commercial Officer at Ajinomoto Foods North America. \"Costco was very interested when they saw our product in Japan and knew it was something their U.S. customers would love.\"\n\nThis new, unique style of gyoza is easy to cook without oil and is unlike other gyoza or potstickers seen in stores or restaurants in the U.S.\n\nThe perfect gyoza flip – \"cook, flip, enjoy\" – results in a perfect golden-brown exterior, delivering a delightful crispiness that encases the succulent and flavorful meat. The result is a delicious blend of textures and tastes, creating a crispy, juicy, and undeniably authentic Japanese Gyoza.\n\nHane Gyoza comes in boxes of 60 for $14.99 and is available at Costco locations in Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah and Washington.
