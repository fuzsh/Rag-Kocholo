He noticed the dashi’s savory taste was distinct from the four basic tastes of sweet, sour, bitter, and salty, so he called it “umami,” which means “essence of deliciousness” in Japanese.\n\nAfter days of studying varied seaweed, he found that the taste of umami could be attributed to glutamate, a naturally-occurring amino acid which is also present in the human body and myriad foods such as tomatoes, mushrooms, aged cheeses, cured meats, onions and seafood.\n\nTo bring this umami taste to everyone in a convenient and affordable way, Dr. Ikeda combined naturally occurring glutamate with one-part sodium, resulting in monosodium glutamate (MSG). By 1909, MSG was patented and commercialized as AJI-NO-MOTO®, to become the world’s first umami seasoning."
