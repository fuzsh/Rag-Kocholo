        "text": "By Pamela Lim\n\nThis is Part 3 of 4. See Part 1 and Part 2 of this series.\n\nThe language used to describe monosodium glutamate reflects its cultural image and reputation. In the United States, this additive is commonly referred to by its chemical acronym, MSG. The term monosodium glutamate describes a positively charged sodium ion and a negatively charged glutamate ion (the latter of which is a form of glutamic acid, a fundamental amino acid found in proteins of plants and animals).\n\nDuring the interviews I conducted, many participants indicated that they believed MSG to be harmful to health because of its “chemical” nature. At the same time, participants were hyper-aware of the chemical quality of this additive because of its name. One interviewee said, “The word [MSG] is ominous because it sounds like a chemical term. If they call salt sodium chloride it doesn’t sound as tasty.” Another said, “It’s man-made, factory-made … artificial.”\n\nInterviewees also referred to MSG as “chicken powder” or “bouillon cubes” which softened the image of the additive as a chemical. Some participants used these terms interchangeably with monosodium glutamate because they did not use the additive in its pure crystallized form. Instead, they made use of chicken flavorings that included monosodium glutamate as one of the main ingredients.\n\nMore recently, the term “umami” has been increasingly used and has enjoyed a much more positive reputation than “MSG.” In contrast to “MSG,” “umami” comes from “savory deliciousness” in Japanese and thus calls flavor to mind, and has even come to infiltrate the four-taste canon (Tracy 2017). However, I have found through my interviews that the association of monosodium glutamate and umami is not universally held or known – at least among Asian Americans living in Los Angeles. One participant of Japanese heritage described monosodium glutamate as “fake umami,” as compared to natural, non-manufactured ingredients. Most participants of the older generation and even some of the younger generation were unaware that the controversial additive MSG is a well-known source of the trendy “umami” flavor.\n\nMonosodium glutamate is also well known as “Ajinomoto,” in reference to the world’s largest MSG producer and the company founded by Dr. Kikunae Ikeda, the man who discovered MSG (Tracy 2017). When asked if MSG was present in her childhood, one interviewee told me, “Ajinomoto was popular, everyone used it.” Another participant described Ajinomoto as a high quality product, especially in comparison to the “cheap imitation…Vetsin” (Author interview). This participant grew up in the Philippines, where monosodium glutamate is colloquially known as vetsin. The term is based on the Chinese word 味精 (wèijīng or vetsin) popularized by the Chinese company Tien Chu, a rival producer of MSG that has “Ve-Tsin” written prominently on their packaging. Yet interestingly, interviewees from the Philippines each named Ajinomoto as the trusted brand ubiquitous in their childhoods. Though Chinese producers targeted Asian markets in the late 20s and early 30s, Ajinomoto took over the market as Japan expanded its empire across Asia (Flannery 192-193, Sand 2005).\n\nAjinomoto and umami originate from and are highly associated with Japan (Sand 2005; Tracy 2017). As one participant described, Japan is well-known for “being advanced and forward-thinking and having good work ethic and strong culture” (Author Interview). I found this reputation intriguing, so I set out to analyze how the Ajinomoto company identifies and brands itself in various regions. I found that Ajinomoto websites market their products differently –\n\nthe Filipino site is rooted in local cuisine;\n\nthe Vietnamese site boasts advanced technology;\n\nthe United Kingdom site claims authenticity in Japanese cuisine.\n\nDo these marketing strategies offer a window into the reputation of MSG in different regions of the world? In what ways are these world regions different environments for monosodium glutamate?\n\nThe North American website reflects the reputation of the additive in this region of the world. It refers to its products as “amino acid products” and its marketing strategy clearly operates to encourage an image of health – where health is tied to nature and purity: “Ajinomoto North America manufactures only the highest-quality amino acids. No animal products. No fillers. No shortcuts. Ajinomoto amino acids set the industry standard for purity.”\n\nAs interview participants described, Americans are wary of chemicals and unnatural ingredients in their foods. Additionally, MSG has had a tumultuous public image in American history. Today, the United States Food and Drug Administration classifies monosodium glutamate as Generally Recognized as Safe and requires that if added monosodium glutamate is present, it must be included in the ingredient list (US FDA). Still, with such recent controversy over monosodium glutamate, Ajinomoto North America avoids the term MSG and markets its products as natural, healthy amino acids.\n\nBy contrast, Ajinomoto Philippines establishes a strong connection with the local cuisine and culture. Packets such as “Pork Savor All-in-One Seasoning Mix” and “Aji-Sinigang Cube” claim to capture the flavor profile of Filipino dishes (sinigang is a kind of Filipino soup). Included in the product list under “Industrial Products” is AJI-NO-MOTO® Umami Seasoning in crystallized form, sold in 25-kg bags. The Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines classifies MSG as a Permissible Food Additive but warns those who may experience sensitivity to read food labels.\n\nMy Vietnamese-speaking interviewees partially interpreted the Ajinomoto Vietnam website during our discussion; despite having images that call to mind industrial manufacturing, it markets health and wellness and advertises that the company’s products enhance taste with natural flavors. It is interesting that the Vietnamese site features hard hats, lab coats, and raw meat – these lay in extreme contrast to the North American site, which steers away from anything that depicts industrial processing practices. Monosodium glutamate is included in the Vietnam Food Administration’s List of Additives Allowed for Use in Food (Selerant RSA).\n\nThe UK website design features Japanese cultural items such as a torii, lanterns, chopsticks, and a maneki-neko (the cat figurine). Their most prominent products are ready-to-cook meals, including yaki soba fried noodles with vegetables (microwave in 3 minutes and 30 seconds) and goma teba chicken wings with sesame (deep fry for 5 minutes).\n\nThe European Food Safety Authority has set an Acceptable Daily Intake of 30 milligrams per kilogram of body weight for monosodium glutamate and five other glutamate additives (EFSA 2017). In the European Union, monosodium glutamate is identified by its E number (E 621). This highly regulated atmosphere may relate to the state of the Ajinomoto UK website, which downplays any reference to amino acids or glutamate, and instead focuses its marketing on authenticity.\n\nA Japanese-American interviewee recounted her experiences in Japan and among her family: “It’s so normalized in Japan … From my experience, people in Japan don’t care whether or not [MSG is] in their food … Everyone uses Ajinomoto.” In Japan, monosodium glutamate is listed as a “designated additive,” which according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare are “substances that are unlikely to harm human health” (2016). A Vietnamese-American participant similarly described MSG’s presence in Vietnam, saying “Vietnamese people love MSG … they have to have it in their food.” The same individuals (along with other participants) described how their personal opinions changed after their immigration into the United States and exposure to American advertising, media, and public opinion.\n\nCuriously, the regulatory status of monosodium glutamate in the United States does not reflect its public image as a potentially dangerous food additive. American regulations are similar to those in Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines, where MSG is more widely accepted. The main difference is the racialization of MSG in the United States as a part of intrinsically foreign Asian cuisine (Mosby 2008).\n\nIn the United States, monosodium glutamate has a precarious reputation and is steeped in controversy. This investigation into the labels associated with MSG and the marketing and imagery used to advertise it helps to illuminate some of the narratives that surround it. It is interesting to peek into perceptions of MSG in different regions of the world. Government policies, scientific studies, and marketing interact to influence public opinion. To complicate things further, countries and world regions perpetually interact with each other by setting examples of policies, as well as through trade and migration. The reputation of monosodium glutamate is definitely far from black and white; it experiences a complex relationship with public opinion all over the world."
