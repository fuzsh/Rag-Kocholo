Its success lies in creating values together with local communities and wider society. The group has named this philosophy at the heart of its business: the Ajinomoto Group Creating Shared Value (ASV).\n\nThe Ajinomoto Group began its business by marketing Umami seasoning as a product called AJI-NO-MOTO®. Since then, the Group has grown while carrying on the aspiration of its founder, which is to improve nutrition through delicious meals.\n\nIn addition to improving nutrition, the use of Umami seasoning not only allows for the creation of spare time by shortening the cooking process, but it also helps families share the joy of eating together and creates affluent lifestyles by interconnecting different food cultures.\n\nOur business domains are guided by the aspirations of our founder, which is “Eat Well, Live Well” and has helped up develop into the corporate group that we are today."
