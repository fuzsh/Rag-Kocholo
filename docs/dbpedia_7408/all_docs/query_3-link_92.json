        "text": "Malayala Manorama : a long journey from paste-up artworks to high-end pages\n\nKerelas number one daily - Malayala Manorama - dates back to 1890, when it was first published as a weekly newspaper. This 117-year-old newspaper has carved a secure place for itself by entering into alternate media segments apart from being an established vernacular daily. AAN editor S K Khurana, recently visited their plant in Kottayam and heres an account of the visit.\n\nKottayam, the city of lakes in Kerela, is known for its scenic beauty and amidst these bountiful natural surroundings is a 6-acre plant of Malayala Manorama, the publishers of their flagship leading regional language daily - Malayala Manorama, with a circulation of 15.5 lac copies.\n\nThe Malayalam word Manorama roughly translates to Entertainer, and the newspaper has lived upto its name for over a century. It started as a publication of the joint stock publishing company incorporated by Kandathil Varghese Mappillai in 1888 at Kottayam, then a small town in the kingdom of Travancore, currently, a part of Kerela. The first issue of Malayala Manorama was published on 22nd March 1890. The name Malayala Manorama was chosen by the poet, Kerala Varma. In a period of two years, from the date of incorporation till the publication commenced, the company witnessed several challenges. The newspaper was even closed down at one point of the time. Despite all odds, the newspaper has emerged a true winner.\n\nToday, the newspaper has 78 editions from cities like Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Kerela (16 editions) and even Dubai.\n\nWhen it comes to technology, Malayala Manorama has always been in the forefront. They were perhaps the first one in the Indian newspaper industry to opt for CtP. The first CtP they acquired was a multi-purpose CtP system from Purup-Eskofot, which has the capability to expose on films as well. At present, they have three ECRM NEWS violet CtPs at their Kottayam plant and two at other locations. On asking about the number of impressions they normally take from each plate, one lac came the prompt reply from Suseel George, deputy manager - quality assurance. For heatset requirements, the printing set-up of Malayala Manorama houses two sturdy Komori web presses and one Toshiba press. Another Harris machine was under installation. As per George Jacob, director, they prefer to acquire used equipment for heatset printing requirements and to ensure that there is minimum downtime due to wear and tear of machine, they keep a huge stock of spares for frequent maintenance. As on date of visit, they had spares worth Rs 2 crore!\n\nFor coldset printing requirements, they prefer indigenously manufactured machines. More recently, they have acquired Cityline Express web offset presses from Manugraph. These machines have a capability to print three sets of 24 pages with 8 pages in colour and 16 pages in black-and-white.\n\nMailroom is an important part of any newspaper printing set-up as big as theirs and so they are well-equipped with counter stackers and binderies. They have opted for indigenous solutions from Newstech India and Technicon India.\n\nQuality is prime and we use one of the best softwares and hardware combo to ensure perfect colour quality. We take full-page proofs on the actual paper we intend to use, on Epson 9600 printer using Starproof software from Bodhi Professionals Solutions, told Sunny Kurian, senior manager - works. Furthermore, they have installed auto registration system from Emerging Technology on all their printing presses to achieve precise registration. The presses are also equipped with Bussel wheel mechanism, which controls paper waviness.\n\nComing to the consumables, it was interesting to know that they manufacture the inks for coldset printing at their own plants in three different locations. This ensures that they get uninterrupted supply of quality inks. It was also pleasing to know that they have strict quality measures for newsprint as well. For this, they periodically send samples of newsprint they use to CPPRI, Hyderabad for checking the specifications.\n\nAt Malayala Manorama, even waste management is properly handled, taking effective pollution control measures within their premises. Waste water is properly treated in a dedicated plant and later used for gardening purposes.\n\nLittle wonder then that their facility is ISO certified from BSI, London. The group is diversifying in all possible media branches. They started a TV channel called Manorama News in August 2006 and are set to launch a FM channel shortly. Their English language news website Manorama Online is the best rated news site. And their weekly magazine Week needs no introduction. Equally popular is their yearly book Manorama Year Book that is published in five languages and their English language edition enjoys a readership of 2.75 lac copies. Other publications include Hindi Vanita, Magic Pot, Tell me why, etc.\n\nNot resting on their achievements in dissemination of information in print and online media, the company has also started a separate events division, which organizes educational fairs throughout the year.\n\nAll this has been possible with the collective efforts of the top management at Malayala Manorama. This family-run business is ably guided by KM Mathew, who inspite of being 91 years old, still comes to office regularly for half a day. Mammen Mathew is the managing director and takes care of the general management while Philip Mathew takes care of the editorial, circulation and finance. George Jacob takes care of the materials department. Jacob Mathew is in charge of marketing and personnel affairs. The younger generations joining the family business are qualified professionals with degrees in engineering, management or journalism. With A view of studio of Manorama News. more talented and qualified people joining the team, Malayala Manorama is all set to spread its wings over a wider horizon.\n\nn\n\nNext Story"
