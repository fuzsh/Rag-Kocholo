        "text": "Historical strategy games ostensibly enable the player to reconstruct history within the context of the game. The scenarios of the games are based on actual historical events. Starting the game at a certain point in history, the player aims to gain victory by advancing the civilization or state following a chronological order. This allows the player to be exposed to a wide range of historical elements and have an idea about historical processes. Civilization VI emerges as one of those games which provide possibilities as such. This research is conducted utilizing action research, a qualitative research model. The study included twenty participants, ages ranging from fifteen to eighteen, observed at random times throughout August 2019. During the application process the participants' behaviours were observed and they were asked to complete study sheets to acquire data regarding their learning process. At the end of the application process, data regarding behaviours of the participants playing the game, their motivations, and historical information Civilization VI provided for the participants were acquired. Data acquisition processes were conducted pertaining to historical thinking skills. The data were analysed using descriptive and content analyses. It has been detected that Civilization VI provides learning tools that support historical thinking skills of chronological thinking, historical comprehension, and historical analysis-commentary. It has also been noted that Civilization VI supports the skill of historical analysis and commentary more than the other two in comparison."
