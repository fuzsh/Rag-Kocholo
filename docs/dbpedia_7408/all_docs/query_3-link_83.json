        "text": "Mauj Mobile, the mobile VAS company from the People Group, has tied up with FHM (For Him Magazine), to make its content available on the mobile. Mauj will distribute content like news, mobile calendars, interviews, animations, wallpapers etc for the mobile, and also eventually create a WAP portal. Mauj already has access to magazine content from other magazines Maxim and Man’s World, and plans to launch mobile magazines – Mobizines. FHM is published in India by Next Gen Publishing.\n\nIt’s interesting that the rights to Man’s World on the mobile are now with Mauj – they were earlier with Coruscant Tech, which is now a part of Mukta Arts. Nokia had launched a mobile newspaper with Malayala Manorama last year. Pressmart, which has partnered with many magazines, also has mobile editions.\n\nWe’re written to Mauj for details on the pricing of the content (how is news going to be priced?), and in particular, how the revenue is going to be split between multiple players – Mauj, FHM International, MIA International and Next Gen Publishing, apart from, of course, the operators.\n\nUpdate: Mauj has declined to comment on the revenue share between the four entities – Mauj, FHM International, MIA International and Next Gen Publishing. However, they have mentioned that the Mobile Calendar will be priced at Rs 20 for an issue, and Animations and Wallpapers at at Rs 10 per image. They are going to create a dedicated zone of FHM as a wapsite located on wap.mauj.com, which will have a mix of editorial content along with downloadable content for users to access.\n\nAdvertisements"
