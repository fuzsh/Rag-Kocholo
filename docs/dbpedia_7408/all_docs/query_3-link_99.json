With Particular Reference to the Italian Ritual Here is what you read in Pauly-Wissowa s. v. agape (entry by Jülicher):1 “Terminus technicus (schon im N. Test. Jud. 12) für die christlichen Liebesmahle, ursprünglich allabendliche Zusammenkünfte aller Gemeindemitglieder zu gemeinsamer Mahlzeit. Die Elemente wurden durch freiwillige Schenkung aufgebracht, den Höhepunkt der durchaus religiös gehaltenen Feier bildete der Abendmahlsgenuss (I Cor. 11). Die Trennung des Abendmahls von der ‘Agape’ – es wurde Hauptteil des sonntäglichen Frühgottesdienstes – hat in verschiedenen Kirchen zu verschiedenen Zeiten stattgefunden. Bei Iustin. Apol. I 67 ca. 150 scheint sie schon vorausgezetzt [sic!], in Gegenden von Ägypten ist sie nach Socrates hist. eccl. V 22 ca. 375 noch nicht durchgeführt. Heidnischer Verdächtigung gegenüber, die zu jener Scheidung viel beigetragen haben wird, verteidigt Tertullian (de bapt. 9; apolog. 39; ad mart. 2) die agape fratrum; als Montanist (de ieiun. 17) hilft er selber verdächtigen. Augustin (ep. 22) klagt bitter über die Ausschweifungen, die unter solchem Titel vorkamen; durch Concilienbeschlüsse waren die Agapen schon aus den Kirchen verbannt. Agapen in einem anderen Sinne, Speisungen der Armen durch freigebige Wohlthäter, nimmt 1. Canon 11 der Synode von Gangra (4. Jhdt.) in Schutz. Die letzte Erwähnung finden die aussterbenden Liebesmahle 692 im Canon 74 des conc. Quinisextum.” Then, with regard to the meaning and explanation of both the verb and the noun of Greek origin, Chantraine2 gives the following: “αςγαπαv(ζ)ω Sens: ‘accueillir avec affection’, notamment en parlant d’un enfant, d’un hôte. Devient assez proche de φιιλεvω, mais plus expressive. Avec un objet désignant une chose, aimer, désirer (des richesses, etc.): sens 1 Pauly-Wissowa 1864–1963: Vol. I, col. 733. 2 Chantraine 1968–1980: Vol. I, 7 s. vv.\n\n4\n\nDavide Astori non homérique. Dans LXX et N.T. se dit de l’amour de Dieu pour l’homme et de l’homme pour Dieu. JAgavph ‘amour’, et dans le vocabulaire chrétien ‘charité’ = lat. caritās.\n\nNoter l’emploi au sens de repas en commun des chrétiens, d’où fr. agape. Le mot est tiré du verbe et n’apparaît qu’un peu avant l’ère chrétienne, mais tous les emplois ne sont pas issues de la LXX et du N.T.” It is on such a cultural basis that Freemasonry creates, at the very beginnings of its modern foundation, two kinds of banquets, both called “agape”: a non-ritual one (in Italian “agape bianca”, open to non-Freemasons), and a ritual form (for Freemasons only).3 The symbolic Lodges were obliged to hold three agapes in the course of the year, and according to a calendar which was to be stricty adhered to: a) on 24 June (the twenty-fourth day of the fourth month of the Masonic year, which begins on 1 March, the feast of St. John The Baptist – summer solstice; b) on 27 December (the twenty-seventh day of the tenth month of the Masonic year), the feast of St. John the Evangelist – winter solstice; c) and on the anniversary day of the Lodge’s foundation.4 3 At least, this is what appears to be related to the Italian terminological use. Professor Jan Snoek, whom I want to thank for this and other suggestions, marks the terminological (and conceptual) issues related to such use as follows: the French agapes blanches (organised by a Lodge, but open to non-masons) were created in France during the 19th century, yet only became popular in France and Belgium (“this is why there is no proper English translation for it, and even though I think that ‘White banquet’ could be a suitable solution, such a definition should be explained anyway” – private correspondence). It should be strictly distinguished from the meal (which only Masons have access to) following an initiation ritual in use in many countries of the world: the English term to be used is “table lodge”, now usually known as “festive board”, a part of the initiation ritual (first degree) and open to Masons only. Even though called “agape” in French and sharing the partaking of bread and wine, the “French” Rose Croix degree (7th of the Modern Rite = Rite Français and 18th of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite) will not be examined here because of its different origin and aims. 4 In the French tradition, from which the Italian one took most of its inspiration, the abovementioned dates are established by the Code Maçonique des Loges Réunies et rectifiées de France, year 1779 (anonymous 1975), approved in the Lyon convent in 1778 and destined to give rise to the Regime or Rito Scozzese Rettificato. In Cap. XV (Dei Banchetti e delle Feste) the author states: “Tanto i banchetti troppo sontuosi, troppo chiassosi e troppo frequenti sono contrari allo spirito della Massoneria, quanto quelli il cui costo è modico e regolato, in cui regnano la decenza e la fraternità, sono atti a conservare ed a rinserrare i legami che uniscono i Massoni. Pertanto il Maestro Venerabile radunerà a banchetto i Fratelli quanto spesso le circostanze lo consentiranno […] Le feste da celebrare nelle Logge riunite e rettificate sono i due S. Giovanni, d’estate e d’inverno, e la festa del rinnovamento dell’Ordine del sei novembre […] Il giorno della festa di S. Giovanni d’inverno sarà principalmente consacrato ad atti di beneficenza […] Lo stesso si deve osservare per la festa di S. Giovanni Battista […] Ci\n\nPassover seder and Masonic agape\n\n5\n\nA famous definition of agape is given in the Dictionnaire de la Franc-maçonnerie (edited by Daniel Ligou), under “Banquet”:5 “Le banquet est une des plus vieilles et des plus solides traditions maçonniques. Déjà les Constitutions d’Anderson y font allusion, ainsi que les ‘règlements’ qui leur font suite. Dès cette époque, les tenues et les assemblées de Grande Loge se terminaient par un banquet et Anderson recommande aux Frères de ne pas les transformer en orgies, consigne qui paraît généralement avoir été suivie.[…] La tradition s’est maintenue. Chaque tenue est suivie – obligatoirement au Rite ‘Emulation’, facultativement ailleurs – d’un banquet ou ‘agape fraternelle’. Au Rite Emulation, le banquet est rituel, c’est-à-dire que la table est en fer à cheval, présidée par le Vénérable, tantes que les deux surveillants se tiennent à chaque bout. On commence par les ‘Grâces’ récitées par le chapelain et le repas est ponctué par une série de ‘toasts’, les ‘toasts officiels’ au Président de la République (en Angleterre à la Reine), aux souverains et chefs d’Etat qui protègent la Maçonnerie, au Grand Maître), les ‘toasts traditionnels’ (à la Grande Loge, au Grand Maître Provincial, s’il y a lieu à l’initié du jour qui répond, aux loges sœurs et aux visiteurs), puis ‘aux absents’, enfin ‘à tous les Maçons pauvres et dans la détresse’. Dans les loges travaillant aux Rites Français et Ecossais, l’‘agape fraternelle’ qui suit la tenue est souvent assez rapide et assez simple, présidée par le Vénérable qui dit parfois quelques mots au dessert. Les femmes des Frères y ont parfois admises. Les fêtes solsticiales organisées par les loges se terminent en général par un banquet ‘blanc’ auquel sont invitées les familles des Frères. Il y a parfois les toasts traditionnelles, plus ou moins ‘sécularisés’ selon les circonstances et toujours un ou plusieurs discours. L’équivalent du ‘banquet blanc’ pour la Maçonnerie anglaise est la ladies night. Les assises nationales ou provinciales des différentes Obédiences se clôturent également par un banquet, le plus souvent strictement réserve aux participants et aux représentants des puissances maçonniques invitées. Aussi, les discours qui y sont prononcés ont-ils parfois une certaine importance ‘politique’. Aux Rites Français et Ecossais, se pratique le ‘banquet d’ordre’ strictement réservé aux Frères. La table est également en arc de cercle, il est défendu de parler à haute voix et de fumer. Le service de table est fait par les Apprentis. L’intérêt de ces cérémonies est quelles ont conservé un rituel assez particusarà un discorso come per la festa di S. Giovanni d’inverno, e si faranno al banchetto tutti e sette i brindisi dell’Ordine […]”. 5 Ligou 1991: 105–106.\n\n6\n\nDavide Astori lier que l’on admet emprunté aux traditions des loges militaires sous l’Ancien Régime. Dans ces ‘travaux de mastication’ ou ‘travaux de table’, on se met à l’ ‘ordre de table’, mains sur la table et serviette sur l’épaule et la chaîne d’union se fait en joignant les serviettes. On emploie aussi un vocabulaire spécial. […] Au banquet d’ordre, les Frères portent l’écharpe ou le sautoir et, parfois, doivent se décorer au plus haut grade qu’ils possèdent. Le banquet existe également à certains hauts grades. Tantôt, il s’agit de simples ‘banquets d’ordre’ réunissant les titulaires de tel ou tel grade, mais à tous les grades de Rose-Croix, il existe une cérémonie spéciale, ‘l’agape du Jeudi-Saint’, banquet d’ordre d’un type spécial au cours duquel les Chevaliers ‘consomment’ l’Agneau traditionnel. Un rituel de 1765 publié par Paul Naudon décrit ainsi la cérémonie: après la tenue, le Très Sage prend la tête du cortège qui quitte la salle, le ‘dernier reçu’ reçoit l’ordre de préparer la table qui est couverte d’une nappe blanche avec un pain blanc dans un bassin et trois bougies. Les Frères ôtent les boucles de leurs souliers et reçoivent une baguette, ils se tiennent debout autour de la table, le Très Sage fait une prière, rompt le pain qu’il distribue, fait de même avec une coupe de vin, puis ‘jette le reste au feu en forme d’Holocauste’. L’Agneau rôti doit être entier, on coupe d’abord la tête et les pieds que l’on jette au feu avant de manger. Pendant tout le repas, les Chevaliers sont tête nue et silencieux.”\n\nIn the Dictionnaire de la Franc-Maçonnerie et des Francs-Maçons, under “Banquet”, Alec Mellor sheds some further light on the English use of the term: following the Lodge session, the “refreshment” – or agape – “est … obligatoire”. It is hard to say how old exactly the custom of the Lodge’s brethren having a meal together (either during or after the ritual work) may be, since our knowledge of the rituals in use before 1730 is definitely blurry.6 However, the custom of a common meal at the end of the Lodge’s work has been a positively confirmed fact at least since 1717. The fact that the ritual agape takes place in a “consecrated” space (i.e. where the Lodge’s picture is placed on the ground in the presence of initiated members only) stresses the rejoicing and the harmony pervading the Lodge, both such states of 6 Jones (1973: 489) claims: “è comunque certo che i brindisi venissero usati agli inizi del ‘700 e probabilmente anche molto prima. Anderson suggerisce che ne venne fatto uno alla festa del 1719. Nel 1757, una lettera autorizzata dal Gran Maestro stabiliva che ‘il primo dei nostri brindisi in loggia è quello della salute del Re e dell’Ordine, con 3.3’. Sia i ‘Moderni’ che gli ‘Antichi’ erano d’accordo su questo punto”. As for the ritual forms practised before 1730, see Snoek 2002, who also suggests (private correspondence) that “at that time the initiations took place within the context of a ritual meal; Only later the two were split, or rather, the part preceding the initiation was abolished, and a more strict separation took place between the initiation and the meal afterwards, even though that meal remains part of the initiation ritual”.\n\nPassover seder and Masonic agape\n\n7\n\nmind being exalted by the sacredness of the common meal.7 The banquet is so important inside the Masonic structure that Lessing, in a famous paretymology, links the word “Masonry” with mase (“table”).8 Since there are many “meal rituals” in use within the various traditions, rituals which developed over the centuries within Freemasonry – hence, any generalisation should be avoided – we will just focus on the contemporary Italian situation with specific reference both to Masonic and to seder rituals.\n\n7 See Moramarco (1995: 167) [conf. Masonic Service Association of the United States 1986: 9–10], who quotes some eighteenth-century works reported in a bulletin of the Great Orient of France (1869): “[…] I nostri banchetti sono al tempo stesso filosofici, morali e religiosi. Essi principiano con una invocazione al Grande Architetto dell’Universo. Il pensiero che si intende esprimere è questo: l’uomo non può vivere senza cibo; la sua esistenza, dunque, è del tutto dipendente da una legge superiore alla sua volontà. Il pane e tutto ciò che serve come cibo sono tuttavia il prodotto del lavoro dell’uomo. Tutto ciò che sostiene e allieta la sua esistenza è il risultato del suo genio applicato ai materiali che la natura fornisce allo stato grezzo. Se dunque da una parte noi scorgiamo una prova schiacciante della nostra debolezza, dall’altra tutto ci rivela il nostro potere. Se l’uomo dipende dalle stagioni, dal movimento del sole, dalla fertilità del suolo, altrettanto egli è capace di capire le leggi e la ragione di tali eventi, e di usare, adattare e perfezionare ciò che lo circonda, nonché di leggere nel Grande Libro della Natura i disegni e l’oggetto dei suoi doveri e dei suoi diritti […]. Con l’aiuto di queste leggi noi […] ci eleviamo verso l’Iddio che riempie il tempo e lo spazio.” (in Moramarco’s quotation). 8 Angiolieri Alticozzi 1746, the first printed text published in Italy about the Institution, portrays “I Liberi Muratori a tavola” as follows: “[…] Quando si mettono a tavola, il Venerabile siede il primo in alto dalla parte d’Oriente; e il primo, e secondo Sopravegghiante si mettono all’Occidente dirimpetto al Venerabile. Se è giorno di ricevimento, il Recipiendo, o i Recipiendi, se sono più, hanno un luogo d’onore, e sono messi alla diritta, e alla sinistra del Venerabile. Al collo del Venerabile appesi ad un nastro azzurro pendono un Compasso, una Squadra, una Cazzuola d’oro, ovvero di rame dorato. La figura triangolare è quella quasi sempre da loro osservata, e però con tal ordine sono posti i candelieri sopra la tavola, i quali nelle Logge più famose, sono lavorati in figura triangolare con bassi rilievi, belli e vagamente storiati, e adorni di figure allegoriche spettanti all’Arte Muratoria […]. Questi sono i tre tempi, che bisogna osservare nel bevere; nel primo si porta la mano alla sua tazza, nel secondo si mette dinanzi a sé, come in atto di presentare l’armi, e nell’ultimo ciascheduno beve. Nel bevere tengono gli occhi diretti al Venerabile al fine di fare tutti insieme il medesimo esercizio. Nel levarsi dalla bocca la tazza, si mette un poco dinanzi a sé, si porta dipoi alla mammella sinistra, e poi alla destra, e questo si fa tre volte. Quindi si rimette la tazza sulla tavola in tre tempi, si batte nelle mani tre volte, e ciascheduno grida parimente tre volte: Vivat. È bel vedere farsi esattamente, e concordemente questo esercizio, e il romore, che si fa nel rimettere le tazze sulla tavola, è assai considerabile, e non è altro, che un solo e medesimo colpo […].”\n\n8\n\nDavide Astori\n\nFig. 1: Arrangement of a Banquet9\n\n1: Maestro Venerabile (Worshipful Master) 2: Ex-Venerabile (Past Master) 3: 1st Sorvegliante (Senior Warden) 4: 2nd Sorvegliante (Junior Warden) 5: Oratore (Orator) 6: Segretario (Secretary) 7: Tesoriere (Treasurer) 8: Maestro delle Cerimonie (Ritualist) 9: Copritore Interno (Inner Guard) 10: 1st Esperto (Senior Warden) 11: 2nd Esperto (Junior Warden)\n\n12: Elemosiniere (Almoner) 13: Ospedaliere (Charity Steward) 14: Maestro di casa (Master of the House) 15: Maestro d’Armonia (Organist/ Director of Music) 16: 1st Diacono (Senior Deacon) 17: 2nd Diacono (Junior Deacon) 18: Maestri (Masters) 19: Compagni (Fellows) 20: Apprendisti (Apprentices) 21: Visitatori (Visitors)\n\n9 The antique origin of a custom later destined to become a practice which was to be followed can be observed in the Table Lodge ritual reported by the Recueil précieux de la Maçonnerie adonhiramite, contenant les Cathéchismes des quatre premiers Grades, l’Ouverture & Clôture des différentes Loges, l’Instruction de la Table, les Santés générales & particulières, ainsi que les devoirs des premiers Officiers en Charge; … dédié aux maçons instruits par un Chevalier de tous les Ordres Maçonniques (Guillemain de Saint-Victor 1786, see pages 27– 49 for the complete list of Instructions).\n\nPassover seder and Masonic agape\n\n9\n\nThere is also a special “military-orientated” jargon of the agape,10 which certainly has its roots and explanation within the historical context of Napoleon’s France, where – somewhat arbitrarily – the concept of freedom was associated with those specific historical processes. Underlying both the more general and peculiar features of both the feast and the ritual are at least three different stratified and overlapping elements, each complementing the others: the first and most general one, which is essentially anthropological, is the “sacred meal”; the second comes from a palaeo-Christian tradition; the third appears to stem from the Jewish tradition of the seder. Let us take a quick look at the three of them.\n\n1. The Sacred Meal As pointed out by Maiocco (1995: 77), “ci è dunque permesso di affermare che la comunione alimentare è una delle prime forme di religione”,11 who then stresses the fact that the priests of Dionysos would hold at certain times “banchetti e assemblee generali durante le quali conferivano premi agli operai più validi […] Occorre sottolineare la portata religiosa e sacra che i banchetti hanno rivestito sempre […] I membri dei clans primitivi si riuniscono per consumare insieme l’animale sacro. ‘Essi comunicano – ha scritto Durkheim – col principio sacro che vi risiede e che essi assimilano […]. I banchetti sacri avevano per oggetto di far comunicare, in una stessa carne, il fedele ed il suo Dio, al fine di annodare tra loro un legame di parentela’”.12\n\n10 Here are some examples from Angiolieri Alticozzi: “Il fiasco dunque da loro si chiama Barile; il vino Polvere rossa; l’acqua Polvere bianca. Non usano bicchieri, ma tazze, e le chiamano Cannoni. Quando si beve in cirimonia Muratoriana si dice: Date della polvere. Allora ognuno si rizza, e il Venerabile dice: Caricate; e allora ciascuno mette del vino nella sua giara. Dipoi si dice: Portate le mani alle vostre armi… in atto di operare… fuoco, gran fuoco”. 11 [The “food-sharing” behaviour might be considered one of the first kinds of religion.] 12 [Banquets and general assemblies, during which the worthiest workers were rewarded […] The sacred and religious importance the banquets always had should then be duly stressed. […] The members of primitive clans used to gather in order to eat the sacred animal. “They communicate – as Durkheim wrote – with the holy principle in it, which they are assimilating […]. The sacred banquets aimed to make the believer communicate with his God in the same flesh, in order to establish between them a kinship”].\n\n10\n\nDavide Astori\n\n2. Early Christianity The Agape feast as an early Christian banquet or common meal, featuring a Eucharistic ritual,13 is centred on the almost universal Christian practice of the sharing of bread and wine, with some ritual elements belonging to both the Jewish Passover Seder and some forms of Mediterranean funerary banquet, which should also be taken into careful consideration. In the Didaché, a proto-document of the Eucharistic liturgy tradition, the agape is presented as an unavoidable holy occasion of communion: the ekklesìa, experiencing “on earth” the “heavenly banquet”, binds the brothers together in unity, thanks to such an intense community impulse, aiming to contribute to the fulfilment of the christiana societas on earth through the sacredness of the brotherly, fraternal meal at the end of the feast.14 Even though 13 With reference to Early Christianity, such meals were widespread, though not universally accepted. 1 Corinthians 11, 20–22 and Ignatius of Antioch (Smyrneans 8, 2) both hint at the agape (or love-feast), as later do Pliny the Younger (Letter 97) and Tertullian (Apology 39; maybe even Corona militis 3); Clement of Alexandria, censuring the indecent behaviour sometimes linked with such meals (see Tertullian, De ieiunis 7: Sed maioris est Agape, quia per hanc adolescentes tui cum sororibus dormiunt, appendices scilicet gulae lascivia et luxuria), distinguished the so-called “Agape” meals (lust type), “pitiful suppers, redolent of savour and sauces”, from the agape (love type) “which the food that comes from Christ shows that we ought to look forward to” (Paedagogus II 1, trans. John F. Keating, The Agapé and the Eucharist in the Early Church: Studies in the History of the Christian LoveFeasts, Bibliolife, 2009 [1901], p. 89). Augustine of Hippo claims that “Agape” meals were common practice in his native land, even though already forbidden in Milan before his stay in the Italian city (Letter 22 1, 3: Comessationes enim et ebrietates ita concessae et licitae putantur, ut in honorem etiam beatissimorum martyrum, non solum per dies solemnes (quod ipsum quis non lugendum videat, qui haec non carnis oculis inspicit), sed etiam quotidie celebrentur. and Confessions VI 2, 2: hoc episcopum vetuisse). The official prohibition of such feasts was established first by Canon 27 (“Neither they of the priesthood, nor clergymen, nor laymen, who are invited to a love feast, may take away their portions, for this is to cast reproach on the ecclesiastical order”) and Canon 28 (“It is not permitted to hold love feasts, as they are called, in the Lord’s Houses, or Churches, nor to eat and to spread couches in the house of God”) of the Council of Laodicea (364 A.D.), then by the Third Council of Carthage (393 A.D.) and by the Second Council of Orleans (541 A.D.): feasting in churches was prohibited, and the Trullan Council of 692 decreed that “it is not right to offer honey and milk on the altar” (Canon 57) and that “it is not permitted to hold what are called Agapæ, that is love-feasts, in the Lord’s houses or churches, nor to eat within the house, nor to spread couches. If any dare to do so let him cease therefrom or be cut off” (Canon 74). 14 Some of the most important features related to the “spirit of union” of the rite are perfectly outlined in the following quotation from the Didaché: “We give thee thanks, our Father, for the life and knowledge which thou didst make known to us through Jesus thy child. To thee be glory for ever. As this broken bread was scattered upon the mountains, but was brought together and became one, so let thy Church be gathered together from the ends of the earth into thy kingdom […]. Remember, Lord, thy Church, to deliver it from all evil and to make it perfect in thy love, and gather it together in its holiness\n\nPassover seder and Masonic agape\n\n11\n\nthey cannot be taken into full account in this paper, the ancient Greek-Latin roots of the Christian feast (with the important opposition between eros and agape) are not to be forgotten and should be duly stressed.\n\n3. The seder shel pesach Before analysing the relationship between seder and the Masonic agape’s ritual, I would like to briefly sketch both the Jewish feast and the general contacts between Freemasonry and the Mosaic religion. The feast of pesach celebrates the exodus of the Jews from Egypt after 210 years of hard slavery. Rich in symbols, pesach marks the birth of a nation, the shaping of an identity. Among the different kinds of rituals connected to the feast, the main one is certainly the seder (etymological meaning: “order, rite”) celebrated during the night of the fifteenth of the month Nissan according to the Hebrew calendar. Here is a short summary of the ritual order of the banquet: 1. Kaddesh – recital of kiddush blessing – sanctification of the feast – first cup of wine. 2. Urchatz – the washing of the hands (as in the netilat yadaim) but without blessing. 3. Karpas – dipping of the celery in salt water or vinegar. 4. Yachatz – breaking the middle matzah. 5. Maggid – reading of the haggadah; the four questions; second cup of wine. 6. Rochtzah – second washing of the hands, with blessing. 7. Motzi / matzah – blessing over matzoth; eating of the matzah. 8. Maror – eating of the charoset and maror. 9. Korech – eating the matzah in a sandwich made of charoset and maror. 10. Shulchan ‘orech – eating of the holiday meal. 11. Tzafun – eating of the afikoman. 12. Barech – birkat ha-mazon, drinking of the third cup of wine and welcome to the prophet Elijah. 13. Hallel – recital of certain Psalms. 14. Nirtzah – drinking of the fourth cup of wine; in conclusion; a wish is expressed that the seder has been accepted. As far as the relationship between Freemasonry and Judaism is concerned, Fellman (1973), former Grand Master of Israel, linked the Hessenes to Freemasonry on the basis of a number of shared aspects (as, for instance, the tendency towards bibfrom the four winds to thy kingdom which thou hast prepared it…” (transl. Kirsopp Lake, The Apostolic Fathers, Harvard University Press 1965 [1912], Vol. I, pp. 323–325)\n\n12\n\nDavide Astori\n\nlical allegorism, the sublimation of the ritual tradition, the value of silence, the presence of the sacred meal, and the concept of “temple-community”), while Shaftesley (1979) emphasised the huge Jewish presence within nineteenth-century English Freemasonry, with participation rates increasing after London’s “Israel” Lodge was founded in 1793. Mola (1981) claimed that the Italian Masonic brothers of Jewish origin made up about 3% of the total in the 1880s, and both Sensi (1967) and Carr (1984) successfully tried to show the Jewish origin of some Masonic features. Moramarco himself, who prefers to narrow down the matrix of the Masonic ritual to Christian patterns only,15 overlooked the aforementioned influence of the seder shel pesach, almost unknown – at least in Italy – to those brothers who did not belong to the Mosaic religion. We can easily remove such an apparent opposition by considering the fact that we should better speak of a Jewish-Christian and not pre-Christian tradition.16 Also, an important piece of evidence for how directly relevant the seder is in this respect, at least in the Italian context,17 in the development of the Masonic ritual, was provided by Dino Fioravanti, Librarian of the GOI (to whom I am also grateful for bibliographic information), who was able to prove\n\n15 Moramarco (1995: 165): “[…] è evidente che il parente più prossimo dell’àgape massonica è l’àgape cristiana (la quale oggi è praticata con grande zelo mistico nelle ‘Lovefeasts’ della Chiesa evangelica dell’‘Unitas Fratrum’, altrimenti detta dei Fratelli Moravi, che consumano in tale occasione un pasto in chiesa). [nota dell’Autore: sulle origini del recupero evangelicomoravo dell’àgape, cfr. A.V. Schattschneider: Through Five Hundred Years – A popular history of the Moravian Church, p. 55]. Tale parentela, beninteso, non è ‘liturgica’ quanto piuttosto storica”. 16 Jewish elements cannot be ignored here, so that, for instance, the Last Supper turns out to be nothing else than a seder, and in general, the agape (at least as codified in the Didaché) should be considered as a reflection of the even more ancient Hessenic banquet – see Bacchiega (1971: 127–135). 17 The first GOI (1805–1814) took inspiration from the “table rituals” established by the Grand Orient of France, choosing to adopt the French rules and ritual (at least until 1808) as codified by Instructions pour les trois premiers grades de la Franc-maçonnerie, of which Instruction de la Loge de table, ou banquet – conf. Atti 1986 – was a part. The printed ritual Loge de table – Loggia da tavola in Vignozzi (1810: 36–60) was written in 1810 and is basically identical to the one described in the French text (Bazot 1810). Another “banquet” ritual, more concise and controversial in respect to the sources, is the one described in Italian and quoted in an ample manuscript by an anonymous author, and dating back to the early nineteenth century (the text is available on pages 82–83 of Archivio di Stato Firenze 1991). Both Statuti Generali della Franca-Massoneria in Italia (1806) and Statuti Generali della Massoneria Scozzese (1821) belong to the same time and are pretty much identical, each being a precious source helpful in defining the complexity of the Italian ritual genesis until Farina’s works.\n\nPassover seder and Masonic agape\n\n13\n\nthat Lìbero Samàle and Ivan Mosca created the Italian ritual of the agape with the clear intention of transferring the tradition of the seder shel pesach.18\n\nComparing seder and agape within the Italian Tradition A detailed comparison and analysis of the two traditions is given by me in the Appendix. Here, I will briefly try to go through the main points of my argument. The several similarities between the two ritual structures are due to a composite synergy of factors: if a common Greek-Latin philosophical tradition (in which the “sacred meal” finds its niche) lies underneath the surface, the identification of common features is definitely striking. Masonic agape and Passover seder are not only joyful celebrations or get-togethers, but they both also share a strong communal concern (a concern that could even be defined as “charitable”, considering the etymology of the word agape). If a deeper analysis of common connotations and symbols shows a clear relation between seder and agape, it is difficult (if not impossible) to evaluate with certainty the nature of such a relationship. And if a direct shift from the seder to the Masonic ritual is personally attested by Dino Fioravanti, with particular reference to the specific Italian context, we should then be convinced that the relationship between seder and agape turns out to be the result of a mix of “invention” and “transfer”. The seder served as a matrix of the Masonic ritual in two different ways: indirectly, i.e. the cultural milieu of the Jewish-Christian tradition, and directly, through the way the re-adaptation of the ritual of the seder was performed. All the modifications and adjustments made from the matrix to the new creation show the common typologies theoretically expected in such a process. The creator of the Masonic ritual sees in the seder of pesach those important features he was looking for. Not having to deal with the hard task of creating something ex nihilo, he finds in the seder all the essential structures which can make possible the celebration of a community moment and of a sacred feast, fulfilling at the same time the atavistic need of dating the birth of the institution he belongs to as far back in the past as possible (a usual dignifying pattern). As in the Masonic ritual processes, the seder needs a main “actor” and a corresponding “chorus”, but no passive “spectators” (a pretty convincing analogy when speaking about optimising processes of ritual transfer). If the seder’s purpose is to unify and to support the existence of a community, such an aim seems to suit well\n\n18 Even though I am aware of the clear apologetic element (Dr. Frederek Musall has wisely reminded me to be more cautious in this respect), the intentional statement of the authors who created the Italian rite seems to me to be prevailing here.\n\n14\n\nDavide Astori\n\nthe Masonic will to better the idea of group identity (see for instance the esoteric concept of “egregore”).19 As expected,20 when moving from one context to the other, some specific modifications come up: loss of perception of the tradition the ritual belongs to; reinterpretation of the symbols (most of the ritual quotations are intelligible only to brethren well versed in Judaism); changes of dimension and form (script, structure, performance, aesthetics). All the aforementioned modifications fall within the usual standards of the different function and intention (instrumentalisation) of what is taken from the matrix to be then inserted into the new context. As suggested by Prof. Jan Snoek (Institut für Religionswissenschaft, University of Heidelberg) and Dr. Frederek Musall (Hochschule für Jüdische Studien, Heidelberg),21 among the many other possible and still open issues waiting to be fully examined are, first of all, the status – and representativity – the Italian ritual patterns have within the general Masonic context; secondly, an analysis of the influence exerted by the Hebraist movement and tradition in the Netherlands, England, and France (especially considering that the exodus from Egypt was usually interpreted as a political parable there); and lastly, the need for a much stronger contextual approach (together with comparative and textual analysis), even though we are fully aware of the many issues involved in finding data and tangible evidence; such an approach could lead to an in-depth investigation of a topic already fairly well outlined. In closing, it seems to me – as described before – that there is enough evidence pointing towards the fact that the relationship between seder and agape is the result of a mix of “invention” and “transfer” processes: the influence of the cultural milieu of the Jewish-Christian tradition and the re-adaptation of a well-established ritual.\n\n19 That Ps. 133, also known as the “Psalm of the brotherhood”, is so much appreciated by both Jews and Freemasons, is certainly not accidental, but seems to hint at common concerns. 20 See the theoretical model in Langer & al. (2006). 21 I would like to thank both of them for their patience and kindness while reading and discussing this paper and for the many precious pieces of advice they gave me. I am also thankful to Gualtiero Rota (Parma University) for helping me out with the revision of the text. As always, all mistakes that undoubtedly crept in are all my own.\n\nPassover seder and Masonic agape\n\n15\n\nReferences Anonymous 1975.

Note introduttive L’Agape rituale costituisce una vera e propria Operazione Iniziatica la cui tecnica consiste nel trasmutare, “in compagnia” (da cum – pane), il cibo materiale in “Cibo Spirituale”. È quindi necessario impiegare tutte le proprie facoltà affinché tale operazione conduca alla realizzazione voluta. Pertanto si raccomanda di: 1. lasciare fuori dal luogo d’agape ogni cura profana; 2. entrare nel luogo dell’Agape in abito scuro (oppure con un coprivestito nero rituale – la “clamide” andrebbe indossata sul corpo nudo), con le insegne massoniche del grado, in dignitoso silenzio (l’entrata sarà regolata dal Maestro delle Cerimonie [MdC.]); 3. osservare, durante i lavori, il migliore raccoglimento possibile: qualora si voglia parlare o commentare col vicino, lo si faccia sommessamente compiere quanto è necessario per raggiungere il massimo della serenità interiore;\n\nThe concept of “rhythm”, the closest to the etymology and the value of the Hebrew word “seder” (order), should be duly stressed here: being able to wisely manage and organise time (a typical Jewish concept) lies at the very basis of the creation of a closer bond between “brothers”. “Serenità interiore” (“inner serenity”) and “letizia” (“joy”), feelings deeply characterising both directly and indirectly the seder evening, are also important features strongly emphasised in the Masonic ritual.\n\n18\n\nDavide Astori\n\n4. non essere frettolosi nella “consumazione” dei cibi e di trovare il “ritmo” con i Fratelli [FF.]; 5. impiegare tutte le facoltà nella penetrazione del Rito, onde parteciparne attivamente: al riguardo si raccomanda particolarmente, di concentrarsi su quanto esporranno il Maestro Venerabile [M.V.] ed il Fratello Oratore [Fr. Orat.]; 6. riservarsi di parlare costruttivamente quanto sarà concessa la parola, preventivamente richiesta al proprio Sorvegliante [Sorv.]; 7. uscire dal luogo dell’Agape in dignitoso silenzio, secondo l’ordine che verrà regolato alla fine dei lavori; 8. dopo la fine dei lavori, sistemare con ordine gli Arredi, gli Strumenti e gli indumenti rituali; 9. infine, dopo aver riordinato tutto, sostare con i Fratelli in letizia. Questo “sostare in letizia” è di fondamentale importanza, poiché in questo momento avviene la “digestione” di tutto il lavoro d’Agape. Cibi per l’Agape rituale – Pane azzimo – Vino rosso d’uva – Uova non gallate, cotte in cinque minuti – Verdure e ortaggi di stagione, freschi, e olive verdi – Agnello cotto arrosto su carboni di legna – Frutta fresca di stagione e frutta secca – Acqua di fonte – Tutti i cibi e le bevande saranno serviti dai Fratelli Serventi (gli Apprendisti più giovani); – Durante il Rituale va messo pochissimo cibo nel piatto; – Solo dopo, quando la Loggia sarà in libertà, si consumeranno i cibi più copiosamente, seppure moderatamente; – Saranno intercalati brani musicali prescelti e/o letture del Fr. Orat., predisposte opportunamente.\n\nItems on the traditional Passover seder plate: chazeret (romaine lettuce), z’roa (roasted shank bone), charoset, maror, karpas (celery sticks) and beitzah (egg). For a first systematic approach to the symbolical meanings and connotations of the food used in both rituals, see Astori 2005, 2007.\n\nPassover seder and Masonic agape\n\n19\n\n– La tavola di Agape deve essere approntata in ogni dettaglio, prima dell’ingresso dei FF.; – Saranno stati predisposti i candelieri, il libro sacro, la squadra e il compasso, il testimonio, il bracere, la Menorah, il bruciaprofumi con i carboncini e le resine (incenso e mastice) preparate dal M.V., i rituali ai loro posti, il candelino presso il Testimonio, carta e lapis di carbone per il tracciamento del Quadro di Loggia; – I FF. si riuniranno in silenziosa attesa, e con l’aiuto dei FF. Esperti, procederanno ad “allineare” i loro corpi per il Rito di Agape. – Il M.V. accende col suo fuoco il candelino tenuto nella mano destra del MdC. – Il MdC. entra, accende il testimonio, pone sui carboncini le resine indicate dal M.V., poi esce, per introdurre nell’ordine dovuto i FF.

Belcher\n\nRitual Identity and Cultural Transition in the Syro-Malabar Rite Catholic Church in Chicago Mar Thoma Shleeha is the cathedral parish of the St Thomas Syro-Malabar Diocese of North America, the first Syro-Malabar rite diocese to be created outside India. Its 800 families of parishioners are Indian immigrants, Christians from Kerala, who now live in the Chicago metropolitan area. In ethnicity they are Malayalee (Malayalam speakers); in ecclesial communion they are Catholic (in communion with Rome); in ritual practice they are Syro-Malabar, worshipping according to their own rite, part of the East Syrian family of rites but adapted to an Indian context. The vitality of this community can be seen not only in its size, its establishment as the seat of a bishop, and its dedication of a beautiful new cathedral building in 2008, but also in the extraordinary enthusiasm that its young people are bringing to the task of acculturation. The strength of their heritage can be seen in the fact that the young people see this task as a deeply liturgical one, as is evidenced by their approach to ritual transfer and the formation of their own identity as “Syro-Americans”. Syro-Malabar rite Catholics are not new to ritual transfer. From at least the fourth century, they have practised a liturgy borrowed from the Assyrian Church of the East, in Syriac, while maintaining many Hindu cultural traditions. Baptism, Eucharist, ordination, and the daily prayer were East Syrian in shape, while birth, marriage, sickness, and death were marked by indigenous rituals.1 Their self-interpretation was invested in their evangelisation by the Apostle Thomas, their Syriac liturgy, and their Indian cultural identity.2 Portuguese colonialism interrupted the Malabarisation of the East Syrian rite with a new kind of ritual change – imposed Latinisation.3 This colonial regime caused many splits in the Thomas Christian community, from which the Syro-Malabar rite Catholic Church, which maintains\n\n1 Thazhath 1987: 45–62. 2 Pallath 2003: 9–14. 3 Ibid.: 71–4.\n\n28\n\nKimberly H. Belcher\n\ncommunion with Rome, is one of the largest resulting groups.4 Despite close ties with Rome and the use of many Roman devotional practices, current Syro-Malabar Catholics are proud of their East Syrian liturgical heritage, now celebrated in Malayalam as well as Syriac. Ritual transfer is a theoretical tool, which identifies cases in which the dynamics of ritual change are driven by a need to adapt a well-established ritual practice to a sudden change in cultural context.5 These dynamics are distinctive, in that a new tension between internal and external characteristics of ritual in a cultural context requires an evaluation of heritage elements (those from the “old” cultural context) and acculturation elements (those from the new context) to create new ritual practices and interpretations. For example, in the history of the East Syriac rite in Kerala, the importation of the rite into India entailed changes in its embedding in the Indian, rather than Syrian, cultural context. Insufficient documentary evidence remains to examine the processes of negotiation that enabled this transfer, but from the results, one can speculate that the new embedding created changes in the practice of the indigenous cultural traditions such as annual festivals and life-cycle rituals, and also created changes in the interpretation (and interpretability) of the Syriac rite. In Latinisation, on the other hand, the context change was the ecclesial and secular structures of Keralan society, which were altered by Portuguese colonial ambitions and power. This change created a pressure to accept certain external features of Roman ritual practice, as well as submit to Portuguese political power. The effects of this pressure on ritual dynamics of the Thomas Christian church can be seen, on the one hand, in the dedication of the East Syriac churches to their liturgical tradition,6 and on the other hand, in the willingness of another part of the community to abandon the heavily Latinised East Syrian rite, and escape Roman dominion, by coming into communion with the Patriarch of Antioch. The concept of ritual transfer thus facilitates examination of the connection between cultural pressures and ritual dynamics in cases where climactic contextual change causes cultural pressures to reach a critical level of impact. This essay examines the possibility that ritual dynamics in these contexts can also be used to 4 Other groups include the Chaldean Syrian Church, which is in communion with the Assyrian Church of the East; the Jacobite Syrian Church, which is one of the Oriental Orthodox Churches; the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, which is in communion with Rome but worships according to the West Syrian rite; and Mar Thoma Church, which is independent, combining a Protestant doctrinal orientation with an East Syriac liturgical practice. There are also several more groups, but these few demonstrate the diversity of practice among the Thomas Christians. Membership numbers are difficult to find and verify. 5 Langer et al. 2006: 1–10. 6 This dedication, as will be seen later in the paper, persists today, together with an unusually widespread understanding of the antiquity of the liturgy. The community at Chicago, as can be inferred from later parts of the paper, also maintains a confidence and self-sufficiency in the adaptation of the liturgy.\n\nRitual Identity and Cultural Transition\n\n29\n\nnegotiate cultural transfer on the personal level. One key to the connection between ritual transfer and acculturation is the role played by authorising discourses – culturally-embedded modes of interpretation which assist in the appropriation of ritual experience for goal-oriented personal change.7 The case of the St Thomas SyroMalabar Diocese of Chicago shows that when a community’s tradition sees the liturgy as a powerful force in creating the shared and personal identities of its members, liturgical change may be used as a paradigm for personal acculturation. Guidance of, and participation in, the ritual undergoing transfer then becomes instrumental in negotiating the demands of acculturation and developing the necessary skills for an identity which is in continuity with one’s heritage, but can undertake the tasks of the new cultural context. According to the work of Langer et al., contextual aspects relevant to the dynamics of ritual transfer include media, geography/space, ecosystem, culture, religion, politics, economy, society, gender, the group carrying the ritual tradition, and history.8 The transfer of the Syro-Malabar rite from India to Chicago entails a change in the geography, culture, and society of the ritual context.9 The youth of this parish, who were the primary subjects of this study, have undertaken an additional layer of ritual transfer by creating and attending an English-language Qurbana, translated by members of the diocese. The young people who attend the English Qurbana include both first- and second-generation immigrants, and range from those having a minimal command of Malayalam, to those who are completely fluent in it.10 Both first- and second-generation youth with a broad range of self7 Asad 1993: 138–147. 8 Langer et al. 2006: 2. 9 The members of the diocese are largely professionally educated, upper-middle-class residents of suburbs of Chicago. The memory of the community (difficult to substantiate with concrete documentary evidence) includes that of a first generation that worked in less skilled areas, but now, most family units include at least one member working in technology or medicine (probably due to the relative ease of acquiring a visa with these qualifications). Many women with small children stay at home and some households include at least one member of an older generation who may not speak English fluently and probably does not work outside the home. Young people, both men and women, often aspire to professional jobs in technology, medicine or law, or to other occupations requiring a high degree of education such as teaching. 10 Respondents to my survey instrument who reported ages between 14 and 16, inclusive, included 17 born in India, two born in the Near East, and 25 born in the United States, almost all in the Chicago metropolitan area. These same respondents ranged from zero (no skill) to five (fluent) in their self-assessment of skill in Malayalam, with a median score of four. Range was one (minimal) to five (fluent), but one respondent self-reported a score of zero, seemingly for pertinent reasons. (Questionnaire received 30 March 2008.) 14 to 16 was chosen as the age range for this analysis because this group of questionnaires was predominantly administered in the 9th grade religious education class, which is attended by those who celebrate the Qurbana in Malayalam as well as in English. It thus represents a more diverse\n\n30\n\nKimberly H. Belcher\n\nreported fluencies attend the English Qurbana, but very few adults attend, so the creation of the English mass has de facto meant a transfer in the group carrying the ritual tradition, as well as a transfer in its language.11 This ritual transfer of the Qurbana provides a keystone for the self-identification of young people with the community: they are proud of the English mass and of their role in it, and they consciously link its development to their acculturation in the United States – to the negotiation of their identity. The ritual transfer, meaning the composite transfer of the Syro-Malabar rite from India to North America and from Malayalam to English,12 becomes paradigmatic for the transfer of Syro-Malabar rite Catholic Indians into “Syro” Americans. They see participation in the Qurbana as essential to their changing cultural identity. They use images and practices from participation in the Qurbana when describing the challenges of their everyday life, especially moral and religious developments. Finally, they see the future of the English Qurbana, and their role in it, as significant for the whole future of the Syro community in North America. The young people use the word “Syro” to designate their religious, ethnic, and cultural uniqueness. This word is abbreviated from the name of the liturgical rite, that is, the distinctive way of worshipping that the community has developed and used over the centuries.13 In a questionnaire distributed to English Qurbana attendees in Spring 2008, 17 out of 59 respondents answered the question, “What is special about being a Syro-Malabar rite Catholic?” using one or more of the following terms: “rite”, “liturgy”, “mass”, “anaphora”, “Qurbana”, “worship”, “participate”, and “sacraments”. This liturgical outlook was the most common category of responses.14 Furthermore, 31 out of 60 respondents to the question “What is special about the Syro-Malabar rite Qurbana?” provided answers containing one or more of the following words: “culture”, “tradition”, “customs”, “India”, and\n\n11\n\n12 13 14\n\nsample set than the bulk of the questionnaires, which were mainly distributed to participants in the English language Qurbana. It is not simple to distinguish these groups, as many young people attend English and Malayalam masses on different weeks, and the whole community celebrates the large festivals (Christmas, Easter, Thomas feasts) at one Malayalam-language Qurbana. While a low level of fluency in Malayalam was a reliable predictor of attendance at the English-language Qurbana, even first-generation young people with high fluency levels are more likely to attend the English than the Malayalam Qurbana. In general, age was a better predictor of attendance at the English Qurbana than either place of birth or level of fluency. Both these layers of transfer are seen as significant by the young people interviewed, and often as concomitant: especially among the younger ones; the development of an Englishlanguage Qurbana is seen as inevitable. This is the definition of “rite” according to liturgical specialists; however, it is also the meaning of “rite” among parishioners at Mar Thoma. Other common categories included the terms “culture”, “tradition”, or “custom” (13); “faith” or “belief” (11); or “family”, “belonging”, or “community” (10). Some answers fell into more than one of these categories.\n\nRitual Identity and Cultural Transition\n\n31\n\n“Malayalam”. This demonstrates the close assimilation between cultural and ritualliturgical aspects of Syro-Malabar identity in the young people’s self-perception. Of course, the attempt by the young people to balance the claims of traditional Syro-Malabar and contemporary American culture on their identity is not solely ritually mediated. However, the cultural identity being negotiated by the young has religious, ethnic, and linguistic overtones, and only at Mar Thoma, many feel, are the various claims of this identity successfully integrated. Since liturgical practice is seen as integral to cultural establishment, the English language Qurbana is a site of identity negotiation, which is enacted according to ideas about ritual construction of identity similar to those proposed by Talal Asad in Genealogies of Religion. Asad suggests that medieval monastic disciplinary systems were a cultural environment in which ritual was valued not for a cognitively-deciphered symbolic “meaning”, but for its potential to change human persons’ desires, capacities, and interpretive frameworks – in a word, “identity”.15 The identity of these American Syros is an object of self-development, and they believe that participation in the Qurbana at Mar Thoma – a Qurbana which is in a parallel process of transfer – is formative. Their participation in the Qurbana changes both it – as they are changed – and them – as they allow it to shape them as Syro. Asad’s examination of liturgical discipline provides a helpful theoretical tool for unpacking this process. For medieval Benedictine monks, Asad argues, liturgy, the rituals of communal worship, is “directed at the apt performance of what is prescribed,… [which] involves not symbols to be interpreted but abilities to be acquired… it presupposes no obscure meanings, but rather the formation of physical and linguistic skills”.16 Such a view implies that “liturgy is not a species of enacted symbolism to be classified separately from activities defined as technical, but is a practice among others essential to the acquisition of Christian virtues”.17 A formative ritual discipline demands a goal – change of identity – and prescribes a ritual process to achieve that goal – liturgy. By entering into the liturgical disciplines, monks “reorganized the basis on which choices were to be made”18 by “creating a new moral space for the operation of a distinctive motivation”19. This was done through an authorising discourse, which facilitated the displacement of secular desires with the desire for God.20 Far from being an activity set apart from the utilitarian processes of ordinary life, monastic liturgy was enacted in order to create identity structures that affected the whole experience of the world, making utilitarian processes doxologi15 16 17 18 19 20\n\nAsad 1993: 62. Ibid. Ibid.: 63. Ibid.: 135. Ibid.: 144. Ibid.: 138–147.\n\n32\n\nKimberly H. Belcher\n\ncal. Thus practitioners’ experience of their own bodies and desires was ritually reread as evidence of their progression towards a goal that was itself constructed by authority and communal ritual practice. There are intriguing parallels between Asad’s description of medieval monastic attitudes towards liturgical practice and the understanding of Qurbana at Mar Thoma Shleeha. The young people at Mar Thoma, like Benedictine monks, understand their personal identity as involved in a pursuit of a greater religious potential. Of sixty respondents to the question, “What is your greatest long-term goal?” thirty gave answers that indicated a desire for a development in ethical or religious potential. In comparison, 34 respondents gave an answer showing desire for success in their career or education, 10 in family life; five gave “successful” as an undifferentiated answer. Thus, ethical or religious development is one of the most widelyheld goal systems among the youth who responded to the questionnaire. Many of the youth also explicitly relate this desire to their participation in the liturgy. For example, one of the most powerful answers to the question “What do you think is the most important thing about being a Syro-Malabar rite Catholic?” reflected a characteristic interrelationship of liturgy, tradition, family, development of religious identity, and the virtue of obedience: “The Syro Malabar rite is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, form of mass [and] is most similar to the mass practiced by the early Christians. Where the Western World has a stronger grasp of rational thought in their practice of Catholicism, the Eastern World has a stronger grasp of mysticism. I feel a greater sense of god-fearing faith with my parents – especially the women. Though sometimes it almost seems like a blind faith, the depth of prayer, the significance [of] Mary and the saints for intercession, the devotion to the rosary, and the humility to God shows a strong sense of obedience and humbleness to submit to God that I really respect and that I think more of our generation could use in their lives.”21 The answer understands the particular characteristics of the Syro-Malabar rite liturgical ritual as directly linked to the “mysticism” of the Eastern Christian churches. The respondent also links liturgical practice with self-development in these characteristic religious aptitudes, and these aptitudes are vital to the cultural identity he desires for himself and his peers. In linking liturgical practice, particularly the specific rituals of the Syro-Malabar rite, with an overall attitude towards religion and life, the respondent seems to be trying to express what Robert Taft called the liturgie profonde – that is, the ef21 Questionnaire received 10 April 2008 from respondent Y64. In quotations from questionnaires and interviews, spelling and non-essential punctuation have been silently corrected; minor corrections for ease of understanding have been indicated with brackets.\n\nRitual Identity and Cultural Transition\n\n33\n\nfect of liturgical practice of a particular rite on one’s spirituality.22 In this article, Taft distinguishes between the textual content of a particular ritual or set of rituals and the existential appropriation of these rituals (not as individually celebrated but as part of a cultural system) into a particular mindset. In the above quote, the questionnaire respondent has done a remarkably good job of unpacking this difficult concept in the context of his own experience, but his convictions are shared with varying degrees of clarity among a significant group of the young people at Mar Thoma. More importantly, these views are most prominent among those who take an active role in directing the development of the English Qurbana and interpreting it for themselves and other young people. The connection between liturgical practice, mysticism, faith, and devotion is itself part of one of the prevailing authorising discourses shaping youth experience of ritual transfer at Mar Thoma. The authority behind this conviction is evident in the young person’s assertion that “the Syro-Malabar rite is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, form of mass [and] is most similar to the mass practiced by the early Christians”. This is a lay understanding of the fact that the East Syriac anaphora (before Latinisation) was a text dating substantially to the third century C.E. It was celebrated in Syriac, thus presumably preserving some Semitisms which might predate Greco-Roman influence on Christian liturgical practice.23 The integration of this scholarly understanding of the ritual with the respondent’s personal convictions about its effectiveness, together with the widespread nature of these convictions, implies that an authorising discourse relating the ritual performance of the Qurbana to the cultural and personal formation of Syro-Malabar rite Christians is operative in this community. The word “participation” plays a central role in focusing this shared understanding of the English Qurbana, but its meaning is not immediately evident. It is quite common for Anthony Achan (the Vicar) to close the English Qurbana with thanks to the young people for their participation, or to enjoin more vigorous participation in the future. If one assumes that participation means lively verbal contribution, this emphasis is surprising, because observation shows that the English Qurbana has a far greater per capita participation than the Malayalam language Qurbana, for most of the people at the Malayalam Qurbana do not sing or pray 22 Taft 2000. 23 For a brief summary of scholarly consensus on this very important eucharistic prayer, see Bradshaw 2002: 111–112: “Although all the extant manuscripts of this eucharistic prayer are of very late date, the comparative geographical and ecclesiastical isolation of the region and the strong Semitic influence on early Christianity there have encouraged scholars to believe that parts of the prayer may be very ancient indeed, perhaps as early as the second or third century. Furthermore, unlike other early eucharistic prayers, it appears to have been composed in Syriac rather than Greek.” Note the substantial agreement between this summary and the respondent’s description.\n\n34\n\nKimberly H. Belcher\n\naloud at all.24 Yet “participation” plays a large role in the young people’s conception of the formative role of their liturgy, because participating in the Qurbana is not just singing or reading aloud. Rather, the understanding of “participation” among the youth at Mar Thoma seems to be related to the liturgie profonde – the existential appropriation of the verbal and textual elements of the rite, or, to put it in Asad’s terms, the translation of “physical and linguistic skills”25 into a shaping of the disciplined person’s capacities and commitments. For example, consider the question, “What does it mean to participate in the Qurbana?” Responses by young people to this question ranged from the tautological (“to take part in the holy mass”), to the rubrical (“actively sing the hymns, respond to the prayers, listen and pay attention”), to more complicated replies. In an answer that is more representative than outstanding, one sixteen-year-old says that participation in the Qurbana “means to receive the Body and Blood of Christ for the forgiveness of sins, to give thanks and adoration to God, to praise God with the community, and receive eternal life”. This is characteristic of the tendency of the word “participation” to shade from the ritual requirements of participation to its central importance in the identity of the participant, an importance that is processual and even eschatological. For the youth at Mar Thoma, it seems, participation in the Qurbana sums up the fullness of their cultural and religious identity. To be Syro is to participate in the Qurbana: which means to say the prayers and sing the songs with the priest, to be prayerfully present and listen attentively, to receive the sacraments, to be devoted to the Qurbana and to Mother Mary, to come to understand the faith more completely, to celebrate the life and death of Jesus with the Indian community, to keep tradition.26 Thus, participation in the Qurbana does mean praying and singing aloud, but it also means a particular mental and spiritual disposition associated with these activities. Participation means “to respond to prayers with God in mind”, “to get closer to God” or Jesus, “to meaningfully pray”, or “to participate in the sacrifice that Jesus made”.27 The following answer to the question “What does it mean to participate in the Qurbana?” expresses the conviction perfectly: “While saying prayers and singing… is a major part of it, in the end I feel it is the physical, mental, and spiritual mode one maintains that places them in a spiritual union with the Body of Christ that is the Church and Christ that works through the Church.” This 24 Participation in the English Qurbana is largely age-dependent. Children sit in groups with either their age-mates or their cousins or close friends. They keep the mass book, with the text printed in it, in front of them. Older children pray and sing more loudly than younger children, and the youngest do not seem to say anything at all. 25 Asad 1993: 62. 26 Adapted from various answers to the questionnaires. 27 Various respondents’ answers to the question, “What does it mean to participate in the Qurbana?” on questionnaires distributed 30 March 2008.\n\nRitual Identity and Cultural Transition\n\n35\n\nresponse suggests that ritual techniques consisting of physical and non-physical actions can lead to a spiritual experience marked by a perception of divine presence. Asad’s monastic disciplines include the incorporation of “physical and linguistic skills”28 into identity structures that include the monk’s desire for God and willing obedience to his superiors; similarly, participation in the Qurbana, according to Mar Thoma youth, inculcates religious, moral, and spiritual attitudes of a particular kind. Personal interviews confirm that participation in the Qurbana is a skill that is subject to development. Participation is, first of all, a task – a demanding task. One subject alluded to the “different levels” of the Qurbana and said that “more and more is asked” of the participant as the “Holy Sacrifice” is approached. Part of this perception of participation as a task undoubtedly comes from experience of the Malayalam mass, which is sometimes a task that is too difficult. “When I go to Malayalam mass”, one subject says, “in my head I’m translating everything that the priest is saying into English: ‘all right, he means this, I can remember that from the English mass.’” This task engages him, but it doesn’t help him participate, “because everyone there, when they pray out loud or they chant, they pray in Malayalam, but here everyone prays in English, so I can be a part of that.” Participation is a task that requires a distinct linguistic skill;29 that is, to pray in the language. This goes beyond the ability to say the prayers, because it involves the praying person’s linguistic identity. When this subject prays, he prays in English. Reciting English prayers in the mass can be prayer for him in a way that reciting Malayalam prayers, even when he “understands” them, cannot be. Similarly, another subject, asked whether the Qurbana is ever boring, answered: “Listen: mass is as boring as you make it. The more you participate, the less boring it is. I remember when people told me that and I didn’t believe it at first, but it’s true. The mass where I’m most bored at is the one when I’m just sitting – like, I’ll be really bored in Malayalam mass. I mean, I know Malayalam, I can speak it, but not to the extent where I understand what’s going on in mass.” Like the previous subject, this young man can speak Malayalam, but cannot participate in a Malayalam mass. Many young people who report complete fluency in Malayalam have this problem. “It’s a beautiful mass, utterly beautiful, and I grew up with it”, one girl remarks, “but I just don’t get as much connection with it.”\n\n28 Asad 1993: 62. 29 Cf. ibid.\n\n36\n\nKimberly H. Belcher\n\nThe “connection” indicated by “participation” in this deeper sense is difficult to articulate; the youth usually explain by alluding to the difficulties of participation and strategies for overcoming distraction. One subject said: “Let me be honest, sometimes when I’m in mass, I get distracted … When I was in confession once, a priest told me, … ‘pray to mother Mary for peace in your heart’, so I’ll just say, ‘Mother Mary, please help me to have peace in my heart’, and it gets me back into the mass.” In other words, this person, while paying attention to the prayers and songs, is also monitoring his own internal state. When he finds himself thinking about matters outside the bounds of the liturgical action, he takes a moment of personal, nonliturgical (but ecclesially authorised) prayer to return himself to the correct internal state. Interestingly, other interview subjects reported a similar internal narrative about dealing with temptation in their daily lives. One subject was discussing situations in which he knows an action would be against his moral code, and he is trying to find the strength to resist carrying out the action. Recently receiving the Eucharist then becomes the internal utterance which decides the outcome: “[On Sunday] you receive Eucharist, that’s … the source and summit of the Catholic life … If you’re doing something bad, or if you think about doing something bad, you sort of think, where was I last Sunday? Maybe I shouldn’t be doing that.” Ethical life, like ritual worship, is not so much a matter of willpower as it is of perpetually and gently overcoming distractions. Again, these remarks about the relationship of ethical and spiritual life to participation in the Qurbana reveal evidence of authorising discourses operating in the community. One young man “remember[s] when people told me that” participating in the Qurbana made it more interesting, suggesting an underlying communitywide network encouraging greater participation. The interview context, as well as the social structures the young man participates in, make it likely that some of this authorising discourse comes from older or highly respected peers, rather than, or as well as, from (Malayalam-mass-attending) adults. The subject who remarked on his internal utterance, “Mother Mary, help me to have peace in my heart,” attests to the complementary importance of sacramental confession, a ritual practice which is an important authorising discourse in Asad’s studies as well.30 Finally, the subject who called the Eucharist “the source and summit of the Catholic life” was, consciously or unconsciously, quoting paragraph 11 from the Second Vatican Council’s Lumen Gentium. The terminology associated with the (Latin rite’s) liturgical\n\n30 Asad 1993.\n\nRitual Identity and Cultural Transition\n\n37\n\nrenewal is thus, at several removes, guiding the interpretability of “participation” as a shaping of the liturgie profonde.31 The confident approach of the last subject towards ethical development may also have its roots in the experiential appropriation of the liturgy. In the Qurbana, as another subject said, “everything is attributed to God”, so that, although participation is the task of those present, the task “doesn’t leave space” for anxiety about its own lack of fulfilment. In other words, the task itself is so demanding and the presence of God so all-encompassing, that self-conscious responses like guilt are precluded from the ritual process. Use of the ritual space suggests that such confidence is part of the Syro-Malabar rite tradition, although it may be reinforced by the liturgical renewal and its scholarship. On 4 July 2008, for the rasa, the most solemn Qurbana of the year, many people came late, including some pregnant women and small children. Because the liturgical space was being transformed into secular space after this rite, in preparation for the dedication of the new cathedral the next day, there were no chairs available for the latecomers. They, assisted by impromptu helpers from some of the nearby seats, matter-of-factly went searching through the building for more folding chairs and dragged them into the worship area, filling the aisles and passageways with more neat rows of families. This confident ownership characterises the use of ritual space and time at Mar Thoma. People nonchalantly bring babies and toddlers to the evening festal masses, take them out to feed or change them, and return to the liturgical space and action unapologetically. The babies – and older children – whine, cry, fall asleep in the mass, and stay at the church with their families until midnight or later. It is the festive season! One’s own participation, not that of others, is the focus; thus, one does what is necessary to ensure that one can participate (such as finding a seat), rather than concerning oneself with others’ concentration. One young woman in the Syro-Malabar Youth Organization calls this “church mindset”. The church mindset is what allows true participation in the Qurbana, as opposed to mere verbal participation. Church mindset is a psychological space that is readied for the Qurbana, “the sacrifice and the celebration”. It is required for full participation in the Qurbana. People are motivated to develop church mindset by a desire “to prepare themselves for a real experience. They will make the extra effort to sit and pray before and get into that reflective mode and try to really experience what mass truly is.” This mindset is a developed attitude, a skill. Verbal participation is a means to this attitude; furthermore, one who has developed it, it seems, is participating in the mass, even if he or she chooses not to pray or sing aloud. One subject remarked on participation, “just sitting there silently, I don’t think that does 31 Robert Taft is of course an eminent participant in the liturgical renewal, and is himself strongly influenced by Eastern liturgical understanding; it is therefore difficult to perceive causality in these instances. Nonetheless, it seems likely that this is a case of mutual reinforcement rather than one-sided causality.\n\n38\n\nKimberly H. Belcher\n\nanything for you – unless you’re praying silently – because that’s what makes the Qurbana different from what you do at home … as a group, you’re praising and worshipping and participating in the Eucharistic sacrifice.” The offhanded exception suggests that for this participant, verbal participation is very explicitly recognised as a means to an end – prayer which, even if silent, can be communal praise, worship, and sacrifice. This prayer is thus not merely a ritual practice, but an identity practice, which is the goal of ritual transfer in this community. The English Qurbana is created, maintained, and celebrated so as to enable the development of this liturgically-formed identity characteristic in those who are unable to pray using the linguistic and physical skills required for the Malayalam Qurbana. The youth at Mar Thoma recognise themselves as taking part in a cultural negotiation that will determine what it means to be a Syro-Malabar rite Catholic in the United States. “You need to understand your heritage”, one subject says, “but at the same time you need to balance with the future. We live in America; we have to assimilate to some extent.” Mar Thoma is crucial to attaining this balance: “it’s not like you come to America and all of a sudden you’re American,” observes another subject. “You keep some of your well-being with you. Your culture is still here with you at this church. At least you won’t be completely Americanised. You’ll know where you come from, your heritage.” The church thus provides a point of heritage, but that heritage is demonstrably (and rightly) in flux: “I don’t feel a loss about the cultural identity of who I am. I feel like I know who I am – but you know those things change in five years.” The subject’s tone suggests neither trepidation nor resignation, but curiosity. Cultural identity, like participation, is not endangered or in question, but it is in the process of changing. The young people themselves also feel competent to direct the dynamics of ritual transfer through their own process of self-development. One "
