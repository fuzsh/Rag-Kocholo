        "text": "Relationships. Growth. Victory.\n\nThese themes serve as the foundation of the Marquette men’s basketball program under fourth-year head coach Shaka Smart and the concentrated focus on those areas has led the team to tremendous success, both on and off the court.\n\nIn 15 seasons as a head coach at Virginia Commonwealth (2009-15), Texas (2015-21) and Marquette (2021-pres.), Smart has guided the three programs to a total of 11 NCAA Tournament appearances. Those trips were highlighted by a run from the First Four to the Final Four by VCU in 2011.\n\nSmart was named the 18th head coach at Marquette on Friday, March 26, 2021.\n\nThe 46-year-old Smart owns an overall record of 347-172 (.669) entering the 2024-25 campaign. He posted a record of 163-56 (.744) at VCU and made five trips to the NCAA. While at Texas, the Longhorns were 109-86 (.559) and made NCAA appearances in 2016, 2018 and 2021. Texas claimed the National Invitation Tournament title in 2019.\n\nMarquette has participated in the NCAA tournament in each of his first three seasons with the Golden Eagles, including the program’s first trip to the Sweet 16 (2023-24) since 2012-3.\n\nDuring his career, Smart has coached a total of 10 NBA players, including two lottery picks and seven overall draft selections. A group of 31 student-athletes has earned all-conference accolades (50 total selections) and 10 times a member of the program has claimed a league season-long specialty award (player of year, sixth man, top defensive player, most improved).\n\nA four-year starter and three-year team captain at Kenyon College (Gambier, Ohio), Smart graduated magna cum laude in 1999 with a degree in history. He still holds the school single-season (184 in 1998-99) and career (542) records for most assists.\n\nIn his senior season, he earned All-North Coast Conference (NCAC) honors and was tabbed the league’s Scholar Athlete of the Year. Smart was one of 20 students named to the 1999 USA Today All-USA Academic Team and earned a prestigious NCAA postgraduate scholarship.\n\nSmart began his coaching career as an assistant at California University (Pa.) from 1999-2001. During his two seasons, the school recorded a 40-16 mark. While there, he also earned his master’s degree in social science in 2001.\n\nA native of Madison, Wis., Smart was born on April 8, 1977. He and his wife, Maya, have one daughter, Zora.\n\nSmart delivered the main commencement address for his alma mater, Kenyon College, in May 2017. In November of 2020, he joined the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) Board of Directors.\n\nThe Shaka Smart File\n\nBirthdate: April 8\n\nHometown: Madison, Wis.\n\nEducation: Kenyon College (Gambier, Ohio); magna cum laude, bachelor’s degree in history, 1999\n\nCalifornia University (California, Pa.), master’s degree in social science, 2001\n\nWife: Maya\n\nDaughter: Zora\n\nYear School Overall W-L Conf W-L Postseason 2009-10 VCU 27-9 11-7 CBI Champions 2010-11 VCU 28-12 12-6 NCAA Semifinals 2011-12 VCU 29-7 15-3 NCAA Round of 32 2012-13 VCU 27-9 12-4 NCAA Round of 32 2013-14 VCU 26-9 12-4 NCAA Round of 32 2014-15 VCU 26-10 12-6 NCAA Round of 64 2015-16 Texas 20-13 11-7 NCAA Round of 64 2016-17 Texas 11-22 4-14 2017-18 Texas 19-15 8-10 NCAA Round of 64 2018-19 Texas 21-16 8-10 NIT Champions 2019-20 Texas 19-12 9-9 (no postseason) 2020-21 Texas 19-8 11-6 NCAA Round of 64 2021-22 Marquette 19-13 11-8 NCAA Round of 64 2022-23 Marquette 29-7 17-3 NCAA Round of 32 2023-24 Marquette 27-10 14-6 NCAA Sweet 16 Totals 15 seasons 347-172 (.669) 167-103 (.612) 11 NCAA, 1 NIT, 1 CBI\n\nAT MARQUETTE (2021-PRES.)\n\nThe 2023-24 campaign was highlighted by the program’s 17th all-time appearance in the Sweet 16 and the team’s 56 victories (29-7, 27-10) were the most in school history in a two-year span. Back-to-back Consensus All-America selection Tyler Kolek, just the third ever at Marquette, highlighted the team’s individual recognition on the court. Off the court, the Golden Eagles collected another record-setting effort in the classroom as a team and both Oso Ighodaro (Second Team) and Stevie Mitchell (Third Team) were named CSC Academic All-Americans.\n\nSmart guided Marquette to a historic level of success in 2022-23, highlighted by the program’s first BIG EAST Conference regular season and tournament titles. The Golden Eagles won a team-record 29 games and tied the league record for wins (17). MU earned its highest national ranking in nearly 50 years and the roster featured the league’s player of the year (Tyler Kolek), sixth man award winner (David Joplin) and a pair of all-league honorees (Kam Jones and Oso Ighodaro).\n\nAs a result of the team’s success in 2022-23, Smart claimed national coach of the year honors from the National Association of Basketball Coaches, United State Basketball Writer’s Association and Associated Press. He also claimed unanimous BIG EAST Coach of the Year accolades.\n\nIn his first season with the Golden Eagles in 2021-22, Smart helped guide the program to a 19-win campaign, a NCAA tournament appearance and multiple team and individual accomplishments. Marquette earned a top-25 ranking after seven-straight BIG EAST victories and also claimed six wins against top-25 opponents, including three-straight decisions for the first time in school history. MU swept Villanova for the first time in 10 years and three players earned all-conference accolades, highlighted by Justin Lewis (Most Improved Player, All-BIG EAST First Team).\n\nAT TEXAS (2015-21)\n\nIn 2020-21, Texas finished with an overall record of 19-8, including an 11-6 mark in the Big 12 Conference. The Longhorns were ranked as high as fourth in the country and claimed the Big 12 Championship with a win over Oklahoma State. The team claimed the league’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament with the victory and was seeded third in the East Region.\n\nIn year one at Texas (2015-16), Smart led the Longhorns to a 20-13 overall record (11-7, tie for fourth in Big 12 Conference). UT advanced to the NCAA tournament as a No. 6 seed before falling to Northern Iowa (75-72) on a half-court shot at the buzzer. The Longhorns set a school single-season record with four regular-season wins against AP Top 10 opponents (No. 3 North Carolina, at No. 6 West Virginia, No. 10 West Virginia and No. 3 Oklahoma).\n\nIn their first full recruiting cycle in Austin, Smart and the Texas coaching staff pulled in a four-man freshman group that ranked as the No. 5 recruiting class in the nation by Scout. All four freshmen signees were ranked among the Top 100 players nationally by Scout (Jarrett Allen, No. 15; James Banks, No. 49; Andrew Jones, No. 19; Jacob Young, No. 87). The class was highlighted by Allen and Jones, who both competed in the 2016 McDonald’s All-American Game.\n\nDuring the summer of 2016, Smart served as the head coach for the USA Under 18 National Team, which competed in July at the FIBA Americas U18 Championship in Valdivia, Chile. Smart guided the team to a 5-0 mark and a gold medal.\n\nThe 2016-17 season was highlighted by the staff’s development of freshman Jarrett Allen, who was selected as the No. 22 pick by the Brooklyn Nets in the 2017 NBA Draft. Allen earned All-Big 12 Conference Third Team and Big 12 All-Newcomer Team accolades.\n\nThe staff’s second year of recruiting efforts signed a five-man freshman class that ranked as the No. 5 class in the country by Rivals. All five freshmen signees were ranked among the Top 80 players nationally by one of the three major recruiting services (Mohamed Bamba, No. 2 Rivals; Matt Coleman III, No. 29 ESPN; Jase Febres, No. 47 Scout; Jericho Sims, No. 51 Scout; Royce Hamm Jr., No. 80 ESPN).\n\nIn the 2017-18 season, the Longhorns registered a 19-15 overall record. Despite battling several key injuries and illnesses and playing a seven-man rotation that featured four freshmen during the majority of February and March, UT advanced to the NCAA tournament as a No. 11 seed.\n\nTexas posted five wins against AP Top 25 opponents and recorded four consecutive home victories against AP Top 20 opponents to end the regular season (No. 16 TCU, No. 8 Texas Tech, No. 12 Oklahoma and No. 20 West Virginia). Of UT’s 34 games on the year, a total of 20 came against teams that advanced to the NCAA tournament.\n\nFreshman forward Mohamed Bamba earned honorable mention All-America honors by the Associated Press and claimed a spot on the John R. Wooden Award National Ballot.\n\nA total of four Longhorns earned spots on the 2017-18 Phillips 66 All-Big 12 award teams. Bamba claimed a place on the All-Big 12 Second Team, the five-person Big 12 All-Defensive Team and the five-person Big 12 All-Newcomer Team. Freshman point guard Matt Coleman III, junior forward Dylan Osetkowski and junior guard Kerwin Roach II each earned recognition on the eight-person All-Big 12 Honorable Mention team.\n\nBamba became the eighth lottery pick in the NBA Draft in UT program history, as he was selected No. 6 overall by the Orlando Magic.\n\nIn 2018, UT’s five-man freshman class ranked as the No. 8 recruiting class in the country by ESPN and 247Sports. Four signees were ranked among the Top 90 players nationally by one of the major recruiting services (Courtney Ramey, No. 34 247Sports; Gerald Liddell, No. 41 247Sports; Kamaka Hepa, No. 47 Rivals; Jaxson Hayes, No. 89 ESPN).\n\nDuring the 2018-19 season, Texas posted a 21-16 mark and won the NIT Championship. The Longhorns ran off three consecutive home wins to open the tourney against South Dakota State, Xavier and Colorado before heading to Madison Square Garden and defeating TCU and Lipscomb in the semifinals and championship game, respectively.\n\nA trio of UT players claimed mention on the 2018-19 Phillips 66 All-Big 12 Award teams. Hayes was named the league’s Freshman of the Year, becoming the sixth UT player to earn the accolade and first since Myles Turner in 2014-15. Hayes also garnered spots on the All-Big 12 Second Team, the Big 12 All-Defensive Team, the Big 12 All-Newcomer Team and the Big 12 All-Freshman Team. In addition, Matt Coleman III and Kerwin Roach II earned places on the All-Big 12 Honorable Mention team. Hayes was selected as the No. 8 pick by the Atlanta Hawks in the NBA Draft prior to his draft rights being traded to the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nUT’s three-man freshman class in 2019 was ranked as the No. 17 recruiting class in the nation by 247Sports Composite. All three signees were ranked among the Top 75 players nationally by one of the major recruiting services (Will Baker, No. 28 Rivals; Kai Jones, No. 49 247Sports; Donovan Williams, No. 61 Rivals).\n\nThe Longhorns registered a 19-12 record and tied for third place in the Big 12 Conference (9-9 mark) during the 2019-20 season. UT was the No. 4 seed in the Phillips 66 Big 12 Championship, but the league’s postseason tourney and all postseason college basketball was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFour Texas players earned spots on the 2019-20 Phillips 66 All-Big 12 Award teams. Matt Coleman III earned third-team honors, while Andrew Jones, Courtney Ramey and Jericho Sims each garnered honorable mention accolades.\n\nAT VCU (2009-15)\n\nWhile at VCU, Smart posted an overall mark of 163-56 (.744) and guided the Rams to five NCAA Tournament appearances. The 163 wins tied him for the second-highest number of total victories during the first six years of a head coaching career in NCAA history. VCU and Duke were the only two programs in the country to record at least 26 wins in each of those six seasons during that time frame (2009-15).\n\nVCU was one of only 11 schools in the nation to earn an NCAA Tournament bid in five straight years between 2011-15 (Cincinnati, Duke, Gonzaga, Kansas, Louisville, Michigan State, North Carolina, Ohio State, San Diego State and Wisconsin). During Smart’s tenure, the Rams posted a 27-9 (.750) mark in postseason play and a 33-10 (.767) record in the month of March, including a 7-5 mark in five NCAA Tournament appearances. The Rams’ NCAA appearance in 2015 marked the first time in school history VCU had advanced to the Big Dance five straight years, and the first time in the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia that a Division I basketball program had accomplished that feat.\n\nPrior to Smart’s arrival, the Rams were ranked a total of nine weeks in The Associated Press poll in program history. During his six years, VCU made 22 appearances in The AP Top 25, including three straight rankings in the final AP poll in 2012-13 (No. 25), 2013-14 (No. 24) and 2014-15 (No. 25), a program first.\n\nDuring Smart’s time at VCU, the Rams led the country in steals per game for three consecutive seasons (2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14) and ranked fourth nationally in 2014-15 (9.5 spg.). In 2012-13, VCU’s 422 total steals shattered the Atlantic 10 single-season record of 352 set by Xavier in 1998-99. The 422 thefts marked the 18th-highest single-season total in NCAA Division I history. During the 2013-14 season, the Rams registered 391 steals, 21 more than any other squad.\n\nVCU also ranked near the top of the national statistics in turnover margin and opponent turnover rate under Smart’s guidance. The Rams led the nation in turnover margin in 2011-12 (+6.47) and 2012-13 (+8.03) and ranked third nationally (+5.4) during the 2014-15 season. VCU’s +8.03 mark in 2012-13 was the sixth-best turnover margin by an NCAA Division I team since the 1992-93 season.\n\n“Havoc” was a hit with the VCU fan base. The Rams concluded the 2014-15 season with a streak of 66 consecutive sellouts at the Verizon Wireless Arena at the Stuart C. Siegel Center. That is the fifth-longest active streak in the nation, trailing only Duke, Kansas, Michigan State and Gonzaga.\n\nIn the classroom, all 15 seniors in the six seasons under Smart graduated with at least a bachelor’s degree. Three of the 15 went on to earn a master’s degree.\n\nBriante Weber made Atlantic 10 Conference history when he was named the A10 Defensive Player of the Year for the third straight season in 2014-15. Despite suffering a season-ending injury in late January, he finished third all-time in NCAA history with 374 career steals and led the nation with 121 steals during the 2013-14 season (13th-best total in NCAA Division I history). Treveon Graham, a two-time All-Atlantic 10 First Team selection, completed his career ranked second on the VCU all-time scoring list with 1,882 points and fifth in school history with 803 career rebounds.\n\nSmart led VCU to a 26-10 overall record in 2014-15, including a 12-6 mark in the Atlantic 10 Conference and a No. 25 ranking in the final Associated Press poll. The Rams captured the 2015 Atlantic 10 Tournament championship and advanced to the NCAA Tournament Round of 32 before falling to Ohio State (75-72) in overtime. This marked the program’s first A10 title and ninth overall conference title for VCU. The Rams became the first team since Xavier in 2006 to win four games in four days at the A10 Tournament. VCU finished the year at No. 15 in the NCAA RPI with the nation’s toughest non-conference schedule and the eighth-toughest overall schedule. The Rams posted 14 wins against the NCAA RPI Top 100, with nine of those victories coming away from home.\n\nIn 2013-14, the Rams registered a 26-9 mark, including a 12-4 record in the A10. VCU advanced to the NCAA Tournament Second Round and ranked No. 24 in the final AP poll. The Rams climbed as high as No. 10 in The AP poll on Nov. 19, 2013, the highest AP ranking in school history (previous best was No. 11 on March 11, 1985).\n\nSmart helped VCU make the transition from the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) to the Atlantic 10 Conference in 2012-13, and the Rams registered a 27-9 mark, including a 12-4 record in the A10. VCU advanced to the NCAA Championship Third Round before falling to eventual NCAA finalist Michigan. The Rams were ranked No. 25 in the final AP poll, the school’s first appearance in the final poll since the 1984-85 season.\n\nDespite the graduation of four of its five leading scorers from the 2011 Final Four team, Smart paced VCU to a 29-7 overall record in the 2011-12 season. The 29 wins set a school single-season record. The Rams posted a 15-3 mark in league play and won the CAA Tournament championship in their final year in the conference. VCU advanced to the NCAA Championship Third Round, defeating Wichita State in the Round of 64 before falling to Indiana (63-61).\n\nSmart’s tenure in VCU will be forever linked to the magical 2010-11 season, which saw the Rams advance to the NCAA Final Four for the first time in school history. VCU posted a 28-12 overall record, including a 12-6 mark in CAA play, and earned a No. 11 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Forced to play in a First Four game in Dayton, the Rams registered five consecutive upsets in what many experts called the greatest run to the Final Four in tourney history. Along the way, VCU defeated USC (59-46), Georgetown (74-56), Purdue (94-76), Florida State (72-71 OT) and Kansas (71-61).\n\nVCU, which fell to Butler in the NCAA semifinals, finished the season ranked No. 6 in the final ESPN/USA Today Coaches poll, the highest in school and CAA history. Smart earned the Fritz Pollard and Clarence Gaines National Coach of the Year Awards.\n\nIn his first year with the Rams, Smart paced VCU to a 27-9 overall record, including an 11-7 mark in the CAA, and the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) championship. VCU’s run to the CBI title included wins against George Washington (79-73), College of Charleston (93-86) and Boston University (88-75) before a two-game sweep of Saint Louis (68-56 and 71-65 wins) in the championship series. That team was led by Larry Sanders, who was selected as the No. 15 overall pick in the 2010 NBA Draft by the Milwaukee Bucks, marking the highest NBA draft pick in VCU program history.\n\nOTHER COACHING EXPERIENCE\n\nPrior to his time at VCU, Smart worked as an assistant under notable coaches Billy Donovan (Florida), Oliver Purnell (Clemson and Dayton) and Keith Dambrot (Akron). During his one year with Donovan at Florida, he helped lead the Gators to a 25-11 mark and a trip to the Postseason NIT quarterfinals in 2008-09. The 25 victories marked the fifth-highest number of wins in a single season in program history.\n\nHe served as an assistant coach under Purnell at Clemson for two seasons (2006-08). In that span, the Tigers posted a total of 49 wins and made back-to-back postseason appearances, including a NCAA Tournament berth in 2008.\n\nSmart worked as an assistant at Akron for three years (2003-06). In his final season on the staff, he helped the Zips to a 23-10 record, marking the school’s highest victory total since it became a Division I program in 1980-81.\n\nHe also worked for Purnell at Dayton as director of basketball operations for two seasons (2001-03). During that time, the Flyers registered a 45-17 mark and won the 2003 Atlantic 10 Championship. The 2002-03 squad posted a 24-6 record and earned a trip to the NCAA Tournament."
