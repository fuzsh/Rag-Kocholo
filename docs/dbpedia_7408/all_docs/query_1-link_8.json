Using a child theme ensures that all your customizations will not be overwritten even when you update the parent theme.\n\nÂ\n\nPressMart is fully child theme compatible. We have attached a basic child theme(pressmart-child.zip) to the download package which contains the minimum of required files. If you are planing any code customizations we highly recommend to do this inside the child theme! Learn more about child themes here.\n\nÂ\n\n1) What is a Child Theme?\n\nA child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality and styling of another theme, called the parent theme. Child themes are the recommended way of modifying an existing theme. Child themes allow you to modify or add to the functionality of the existing parent theme.\n\nÂ\n\n2) Why use a Child Theme?\n\nAlways use a Child Theme when modifying any theme files. This way you make sure a theme update will not wipe out any changes you have made to the files.\n\nThere are a few reasons why you would want to use a child theme: If you modify a theme directly and it is updated, then your modifications may be lost. By using a child theme you will ensure that your modifications are preserved.\n\nSpeed Optimization\n\nÂ\n\nWhat can make your site slower?\n\n1. Plugins:\n\nWhen you have a number of plugins active on your site, it can slow down your site. Deactivate all the plugins except the ones included within the theme and clear the browser cache. Then, you can activate your plugins one by one and check to see which plugin is slowing your site.\n\n2. Images:\n\nImages are a key factor in optimizing a website. It is important to optimize your images for your website. Images with large size can slow down your site. Do not upload images in large size. For instance, if your weblog is created by images with the size 800*600, you should upload an image with the same size and not bigger.\n\n3. Host:\n\nYour host or sever can be a reason of your site low speed. If you are using VPS for your hosting, it can be because of bad configurations and low resources. If you are using shared hosting, you need to contact your host provider in this regard so they can check it.\n\n4. JS and CSS Files:\n\nYou should use a cache plugin. These plugins minify your files and combine them and stores a version of the file in cache in order to reduce your server requests and as a result, it will boost your site speed.\n\nÂ\n\nHow To Improve Site Speed ?\n\n1. Image Optimize:\n\nYou can compress images from CompressJPEG/TinyPNG website. Visit https://compressjpeg.com Or https://tinypng.com/ and compress all images before uploading them on your website. By this process, you can decrease your website loading time and provide your visitors, a better experience.\n\n2 .htaccess Code For Better Website Speed:\n\nIf you familiar with .htaccess, you can go to the root foldef of your WordPress installation. Find .htaccess file and open it.Insert following code.\n\nAddType application/x-font-woff .woff AddType application/font-woff2 .woff2 AddType application/vnd.ms-fontobject .eot <IfModule mod_deflate.c> AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/javascript AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE image/x-icon AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE image/svg+xml AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font-truetype AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font-ttf AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font-otf AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font-opentype AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-font-woff AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/font-woff2 AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/vnd.ms-fontobject AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/ttf AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/otf AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE font/opentype # For Olders Browsers Which Can't Handle Compression BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\\.0[678] no-gzip BrowserMatch \\bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html </IfModule> <ifModule mod_gzip.c> mod_gzip_on Yes mod_gzip_dechunk Yes mod_gzip_item_include file \\.(html?|txt|css|js|php|pl)$ mod_gzip_item_include mime ^application/x-javascript.* mod_gzip_item_include mime ^text/.* mod_gzip_item_exclude rspheader ^Content-Encoding:.*gzip.* mod_gzip_item_exclude mime ^image/.* mod_gzip_item_include handler ^cgi-script$ </ifModule> ## EXPIRES CACHING ## <IfModule mod_expires.c> ExpiresActive On ExpiresByType application/vnd.ms-fontobject \"access plus 1 year\" ExpiresByType application/x-font-ttf \"access plus 1 year\" ExpiresByType application/x-font-opentype \"access plus 1 year\" ExpiresByType application/x-font-woff \"access plus 1 year\" ExpiresByType application/font-woff2 \"access plus 1 year\" ExpiresByType image/jpg \"access plus 1 year\" ExpiresByType image/jpeg \"access plus 1 year\" ExpiresByType image/gif \"access plus 1 year\" ExpiresByType image/png \"access plus 1 year\" ExpiresByType text/css \"access plus 3 month\" ExpiresByType application/pdf \"access plus 3 month\" ExpiresByType text/x-javascript \"access plus 3 month\" ExpiresByType application/x-shockwave-flash \"access plus 3 month\" ExpiresByType image/x-icon \"access plus 1 year\" ExpiresDefault \"access plus 3 month\" </IfModule> ## EXPIRES CACHING ## <ifModule mod_headers.c> Header set Connection keep-alive </ifModule> <IfModule mod_header.c> # 3 Month <FilesMatch \"\\.(flv|gif|jpg|jpeg|png|ico|swf)$\"> Header set Cache-Control \"max-age=7257600\" </FilesMatch> # 1 Week <FilesMatch \"\\.(js|css|pdf|txt)$\"> Header set Cache-Control \"max-age=604800\" </FilesMatch> # 10 Minutes <FilesMatch \"\\.(html|htm)$\"> Header set Cache-Control \"max-age=600\" </FilesMatch> # NONE <FilesMatch \"\\.(pl|php|cgi|spl)$\"> Header unset Cache-Control Header unset Expires Header unset Last-Modified FileETag None Header unset Pragma </FilesMatch> </IfModule> # END WordPress\n\n(Note: Please don't replace any code that already exists on the .htaccess file.

Are you sure you want to do this?\n\nAfter browsing for your theme and clicking the \"Install Now\" button, itâs possible your WordPress installation will ask \"Are you sure you want to do this?\" This could be due to the fact that you are trying to install the wrong zip file (remember â you want the \"Installable WordPress file only\") or itâs possible the upload limit on your server isnât large enough.You'll need to contact your hosting company to have them increase upload_max_filesize value up to 32MB, or you may install the Theme via FTP.\n\n4. 500 Internal Server Error\n\nPlease extend below php configuration of our theme requirement in php.ini or Contact your host provider support team and extend below detail.\n\nmax_execution_time = 600\n\nmemory_limit = 256M\n\npost_max_size = 32M\n\nupload_max_filesize = 32M\n\nmax_input_time = 300\n\n5.

Demo Content Duplicated\n\nWhen you import our demo content, it can take several minutes depending on the speed of your server. Each time the button is clicked it will import the content, so if it is clicked twice it will import everything two times. There are two ways to get rid of duplicate content.\n\nMethod 1: WP Reset Plugin â This plugin is the fastest way to get rid of content. However, it will remove all content from your database and leave the default theme activated. It does not remove plugins, but will deactivate them and remove all pages, posts, menus, sliders, widget data, etc. Basically it removes all the content that you imported from our theme. Only do this if you are able to start over. Click Here To Download.\n\nMethod 2: Manual Removal â This method will take longer and simply involves manually removing duplicate items. For example, go to the Appearance > Menu and delete and duplicate items one by one. Same thing for pages, post, sliders, etc.\n\n11.How to create tracking order page?\n\nCreate new page and put [woocommerce_order_tracking] shortcode in page.
