        "text": "Pressmart, Online publishing provider, has announced a Mobile Learning Classroom Application (MOCA). It is tablet based end-to-end solution for schools.\n\nThe Hyderabad-based firm announced deployment of its application by La Salle Green Hills (LSGH), a school in Manila, Philippines. It also plans pilot projects in India, Singapore, Malaysia and Australia in the coming months.\n\nMOCA allows school going children to access text book\n\ns and worksheets in a digitised format on an Android-based tablet. The solution costs $100 for a year’s education.\n\nV K Torpunur, Chairman, Pressmart, said, “MOCA is based on a private cloud-based interactive education system aimed at making learning an interesting, enjoyable and collaborative experience on mobile devices.”\n\nThe e-tablet initiative involving Pressmart, MOCA consists of a five-phase implementation. The first, on-going, phase involves merely replacing textbooks with the tablet devices. MOCA will be sold in India at the price range of Rs 4000 – Rs. 7000 for institutions."
