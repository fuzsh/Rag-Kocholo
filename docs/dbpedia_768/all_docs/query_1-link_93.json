        "text": "The globalization of trade and lifestyle ensure that the factors responsible for the emergence of diseases are more present than ever. Despite biotechnology advancements, meat-based foods are still under scrutiny because of the presence of pathogens, which causes a loss of consumer confidence and consequently a fall in demand. In this context, Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) as GRAS organisms offer an alternative for developing pathogen-free foods, particularly avoiding Listeria monocytogenes, with minimal processing and fewer additives while maintaining the foods&#39; sensorial characteristics. The use of LAB strains, enabling us to produce antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) in addition to lactic acid, with an impact on quality and safety during fermentation, processing, and/or storage of meat and ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products, constitutes a promising tool. A number of bacteriocin-based strategies including the use of bioprotective cultures, purified and/or semi-purified bacterioc...\n\nEating fresh fruits and vegetables is, undoubtedly, a healthy habit that should be adopted by everyone (particularly due to the nutrients and functional properties of fruits and vegetables). However, at the same time, due to their production in the external environment, there is an increased risk of their being infected with various pathogenic microorganisms, some of which cause serious foodborne illnesses. In order to preserve and distribute safe, raw, and minimally processed fruits and vegetables, many strategies have been proposed, including bioprotection. The use of lactic acid bacteria in raw and minimally processed fruits and vegetables helps to better maintain their quality by extending their shelf life, causing a significant reduction and inhibition of the action of important foodborne pathogens. The antibacterial effect of lactic acid bacteria is attributed to its ability to produce antimicrobial compounds, including bacteriocins, with strong competitive action against many...\n\nThis study was conducted to isolate psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from chicken carcasses with inhibitory activity against strains of Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. A total of 100 broiler samples were examined for the presence of LAB. Ninety-two LAB isolates that showed antimicrobial effects against Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes were further analysed to examine their LAB (Gram-positive, catalase negative, oxidase negative) and psychrotrophic characteristics (ability to grow at 7 °C). Fifty isolates were further selected and identified initially using standard biochemical tests in miniature (Micro-kits API CH 50) and then by sequencing of the 16s-23s rRNA gene boundary region (Intergenic Spacer Region). By molecular identification, these isolates were classified into 5 different LAB species: Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Lactobacillus paralimentarius. None of the isolates produced...\n\nThe strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis widely used in food preservation due to ability produce high amount of hydrogen peroxide at refrigerator temperatures to inhibit food-borne pathogens and psychrophilic spoilage microorganisms. In order to improve of bio-preservation efficacy of L. delbrueckii MH 10 mutations causing resistance to streptomycin (str) were used. Among UV-mutagenized population of L. delbrueckii three str mutants producing high amounts of H2O2 were selected. Str mutants produced significant amounts of hydrogen peroxide 50-60 μg/ml in sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.5) and in beef broth (BB) at 5 °C for 5 days submerged cultivation without of growth. Evaluation mutants antibacterialactivity at refrigeration temperatures against food-borne pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 revealed elimination of pathogen total number up to practically undetectable amount for 3 days. In case of solid-state cultivation on agar-based medium, disks soaked by mutant cells suspensions formed larger inhibitory zones on E. coli O157:H7 lawn for one-day cold exposition. The size of inhibition zone depends on concentration of LAB cells. Str mutants L. delbrueckii reduced initial amount 2  105 of E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef up to 3 log for 3 days of solid-state cocultivation when the wild strain reduced only 2 log. The application of L. delbrueckii mutants did not cause any changes in sensory characteristics of ground beef, moreover promotes expanding of shelf-life due to inhibition of psychrophilic spoilage microorganisms.\n\nPresently, biopreservation through protective bacterial cultures and their antimicrobial products or using antibacterial compounds derived from plants are proposed as feasible strategies to maintain the long shelf-life of products. Another emerging category of food biopreservatives are bacteriophages or their antibacterial enzymes called “phage lysins” or “enzybiotics”, which can be used directly as antibacterial agents due to their ability to act on the membranes of bacteria and destroy them. Bacteriophages are an alternative to antimicrobials in the fight against bacteria, mainly because they have a practically unique host range that gives them great specificity. In addition to their potential ability to specifically control strains of pathogenic bacteria, their use does not generate a negative environmental impact as in the case of antibiotics. Both phages and their enzymes can favor a reduction in antibiotic use, which is desirable given the alarming increase in resistance to an...\n\nBacteriocins are ribosomal-synthesized peptides or proteins produced by bacterial strains and can inhibit pathogenic bacteria. Numerous factors influence the potential activity of bacteriocins in food matrices. For example, food additives usage, chemical composition, physical conditions of food, and sensitivity of proteolytic enzymes can constrain the application of bacteriocins as beneficial food preservatives. However, novel bacteriocin nanoencapsulation has appeared as an encouraging solution. In this review, we highlight the bacteriocins produced by Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria including lactic acid bacteria that have shown positive results as potential food preservatives. In addition, this review encompasses the major focus on bacteriocins encapsulation with nanotechnology to enhance the antimicrobial action of bacteriocins. Several strategies can be employed to encapsulate bacteriocins; however, the nanotechnological approach is one of the most effective s..."
