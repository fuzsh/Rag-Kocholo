        "text": "Subject to more detail in later sections regarding particular issues, the following quotation from the Claimants' Memorial on the Merits summarizes the Claimants' main arguments as follows (C V, ¶¶2-14):\n\n2. Between 1991 and 1993, TexPet filed seven breach-of-contract cases against the Ecuadorian government in Ecuadorian courts in which it claimed more than US$ 553 million in damages, which included interest to that point in time. The cases involve breaches by Ecuador of its payment obligations to TexPet under a contract dated August 4, 1973 (the \"1973 Agreement\"), a supplemental agreement dated December 1977 (the \"1977 Agreement\") and related provisions of Ecuadorian law. The 1973 and 1977 Agreements are referred to collectively throughout this Memorial as the \"Agreements.\"\n\n3. Under the 1973 Agreement, TexPet was entitled to explore and exploit oil reserves in certain regions of Ecuador, and TexPet was required to provide a percentage of its crude oil production to the Government to help meet Ecuadorian domestic consumption needs. The Government of Ecuador was entitled to set the price at which it would purchase oil from TexPet for Ecuadorian domestic consumption needs, referred to as the \"Domestic Market Price.\" The Government consistently set the Domestic Market Price well below the prevailing international market price. Once TexPet satisfied its obligation to contribute oil for Ecuador's domestic consumption at the low Domestic Market Price, TexPet was entitled to receive prevailing international prices for the remainder of its oil. Specifically, once it satisfied its obligation to contribute its share of oil for domestic consumption, TexPet was free to export its remaining oil internationally. The sole exception to TexPet's important right to export was the Government's right to purchase TexPet's oil for refining and export, but if the Government made such a request for oil that it would not use to satisfy domestic consumption, the Government was obligated to pay TexPet the prevailing international price for oil.\n\n4. The key principle under the 1973 Agreement was the ultimate use of the crude oil contributed by TexPet. If the government requested an oil contribution from TexPet and the Government used the oil for any purpose other than to satisfy Ecuadorian domestic consumption needs, then TexPet was entitled to receive the international market price.\n\n5. The Ecuadorian Government breached the Agreements and related Ecuadorian laws by requiring TexPet to contribute substantially more oil than it was obligated to provide at the reduced Domestic Market Price. Ecuador then exported this additional contribution by TexPet, either directly or as refined derivative oil products, but it did not pay TexPet the international market price that it was contractually and legally required to pay.\n\n6. TexPet commenced lawsuits in Ecuador seeking the difference in price between the reduced Domestic Market Price that it received and the international market price at the time, or a return of the barrels overcontributed. TexPet proved each claim before the Ecuadorian courts, largely through Government documents made available to TexPet through the court-sanctioned \"judicial inspection\" process under Ecuadorian law. In three of the cases, the court appointed its own experts, and in each of those cases, the court-appointed experts agreed with TexPet's analysis but found that the damages were slightly higher than those claimed by TexPet. Two other cases are identical (except for the time periods) to cases in which independent court-appointed experts confirmed TexPet's case. In the final two cases, the GOE's own expert agreed with TexPet's analysis and calculations.\n\n7. Importantly, the Government admits, as it must, that it requested crude oil from TexPet for domestic consumption, paid TexPet the Domestic Market Price, and exported portions of the oil for its own profit. The Government admits these facts because they are confirmed through irrefutable documentation from Government sources that were revealed during the judicial inspections in the underlying cases and confirmed by legal and economic experts subsequently in this arbitration. The sources include the Central Bank of Ecuador and Ecuador's National Hydrocarbons Directorate, which is part of Ecuador's Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. Indeed, the Government's own records permit a straightforward calculation of the number of equivalent barrels that TexPet contributed, but which the Government used to export for its own gain. Not only did the experts appointed by the Ecuadorian courts agree with TexPet's analysis (and point out that the damages actually were higher than TexPet claimed), but Navigant Consulting has performed an independent analysis for purposes of this Arbitration to determine whether TexPet contributed oil for domestic consumption that the Government did not use for that purpose, and if so, the number of such equivalent barrels. The results of Navigant's current independent analysis confirm the primary expert's calculations in the underlying litigation as to the total number of barrels that TexPet overcontributed.\n\n8. The Government's defense in the underlying Ecuadorian litigation and in this arbitration is one of attempted misdirection. Specifically, the Government argues that once it requested the oil from TexPet to satisfy domestic consumption obligations, the oil became the property of the Government, and the Government was free to do with that oil and its byproducts as it wished, including refining and exporting it for a profit without paying TexPet the prevailing international prices. This argument is misleading and baseless. The Government's ownership interest in the oil is not the issue in these cases. The issue here and in the underlying cases is the price that the Government must pay for oil that it required from TexPet. Under the express language of the Agreements and applicable law, the Government was obligated to pay TexPet international prices for oil that it required and did not use domestically (or return to TexPet the barrels of oil it over-contributed). The Government's argument to avoid honoring its contractual obligations was specious in the underlying cases and remains so here.\n\n9. In all seven cases, TexPet filed evidence of its claims within the proper time period, recommended experts at the appropriate times under Ecuadorian procedural rules, and repeatedly requested final decisions from the courts. But for well over a decade, 15 different judges in three different courts failed to rule on any of the seven separate cases. Six of those cases stood legally ready for decision under Ecuadorian law since at least 1998, but the courts refused to rule. In the seventh case, the court refused even to take evidence for 14 years. In short, the Ecuadorian judiciary egregiously delayed all of TexPet's claims against the Government, and it has demonstrated a refusal to judge any of those claims in a fair manner as required under Ecuadorian and international law.\n\n10. In December 2004, the political branches of the same Ecuadorian Government that is the defendant in the seven cases began to exert control over Ecuador's judiciary. Although Ecuador's 1998 Constitution enshrines the principle of judicial independence that is so fundamental to a state's ability to meet its obligation to provide foreign nationals with impartial justice under the law, the political branches purged Ecuador's Constitutional, Electoral, and Supreme Courts and replaced the constitutionally-appointed judges with political allies. Since 2004, judicial independence in Ecuador has been compromised, as recognized by several prominent international organizations and commentators. The Supreme Court—the Subrogate President of that Court sits as a first instance judge in three of TexPet's cases against the government—has been unconstitutionally purged a total of three times in less than four years, and the current Court was not legitimately constituted under the Constitution. Ecuador has justified its judicial purges on the basis that its courts were politicized and the judges issued rulings that the Government did not like, and the Constitutional Court repeatedly has been threatened and purged merely for attempting to exercise its fundamental responsibility to determine whether certain governmental actions are constitutional. Since 2004, Ecuador's Government has not permitted its courts to function independently, and local and international observers of varied political affiliations agree that the political branches now dominate the courts. Moreover, today a Constituent Assembly dominated by the Executive's political party has declared that it has ultimate authority over all branches of the Ecuadorian Government, including the judiciary. The President of the Supreme Court announced just two months ago that Ecuador does not live under the rule of law.\n\n11. In light of the egregious delays suffered in its seven cases and the move by the Executive Branch, which defends those cases, to extend its control over the entire Ecuadorian judiciary, Claimants provided Ecuador with notice of this dispute in May 2006. In response to that notice and the subsequent filing of this proceeding in December 2006, some of the now-politicized courts began to take some action. In two of TexPet's cases, the courts dismissed TexPet's claims as \"abandoned\" based on a manifestly-improper reading of a straightforward Civil Code provision as well as the unconstitutional retroactive application of that provision, and despite the fact that TexPet had taken all actions necessary to prosecute the cases and the next action required was that of the courts. In a third case, the court dismissed TexPet's claim based on an inapplicable prescription period for breach of contract for small sales to retail consumers, even though under the unambiguous definition of those terms under Ecuadorian law, the supply did not involve small sales and the Government was not a retail consumer of TexPet's. All three of those cases were not simply decided wrongly, they were decided in a grossly incompetent fashion in manifest disregard of Ecuadorian law and created a manifest injustice. And in a fourth case—the smallest of TexPet's claims worth approximately one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) of the total damages owed by Ecuador to TexPet—the court ruled in TexPet's favor, although the Government has appealed the ruling and it remains on appeal. That judgment is part of a transparent tactic to posture the Government for this proceeding.\n\n12. Ecuador's undue delays in deciding TexPet's seven cases, which have languished for well over a decade in the Ecuadorian courts, its bias or gross incompetence in manifest disregard of Ecuadorian law in ultimately deciding three of those cases, and its failure to provide an impartial and independent judicial forum in which TexPet may prosecute its claims and vindicate its rights, constitute a denial of justice under customary international law, and independently, a violation of Ecuador's treaty obligations under the BIT. Specifically, Ecuador violated its BIT obligations to (1) provide TexPet with an effective means of asserting claims and enforcing its rights; (2) provide fair and equitable treatment to TexPet's investments; (3) provide full protection and security to those investments; and (4) refrain from treating those investments in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner. Moreover, the Agreements constitute investment agreements, which have been breached by Ecuador. Under international law, when a country's courts deny justice to a foreign investor, and when it would be futile for the investor to continue to pursue its claims in the host country's courts, an international arbitral tribunal must take and decide the claims.\n\n13. Any further effort by TexPet to receive justice from the Ecuadorian courts would be futile. Ecuador has denied justice to TexPet first by refusing to judge its claims against the Government for more than a decade, and then by illegally dismissing several of those claims in direct response to TexPet's attempt to vindicate its rights before this Tribunal. The current bias of Ecuadorian judges, the lack of a constitutionally-legitimate Supreme Court, and the frequent and successful attacks in recent years by Ecuador's political branches on judicial independence requires adjudication by this Tribunal.\n\n14. Claimants seek damages of approximately US$ 1.6 billion for Ecuador's various breaches of the governing agreements and laws, together with costs and fees as set forth in Section VIII below concerning current damages. TexPet sought US$ 553,456,850 in its originally-filed Ecuadorian claims, increased to US$ 587,823,427 cumulatively after judicial inspections. Applying simple interest (not compound) under Ecuadorian law through December 31, 2004, yields approximately US$ 1.1 billion, and applying compound interest to that amount from January 1, 2005, through April 1, 2008, under international law yields US$ 1,577,768,929 in damages owed through April 1, 2008 using the claim amounts from the underlying litigation. Moreover, as addressed below, Navigant Consulting performed its own independent analysis of the underlying Ecuadorian claims using mostly government documents as its source and independently calculated damages of US$ 1,605,220,794.\n\nSubject to more detail in later sections regarding particular issues, the following quotation from the Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits summarizes the Respondent's main arguments as follows (R V, ¶¶1-7):\n\n1. Years after the operative events, and in the midst of negotiating a final accounting in connection with its exit from Ecuador, TexPet commissioned a special task force to come up with possible counterclaims to offset large monetary claims then being asserted against it by the Republic of Ecuador (\"Republic\"). To concoct these counterclaims, the task force pored through old documents and \"discovered\" new contract rights reaching back more than a decade and fabricated damages theories based on them, all with an eye toward \"leveraging\" the Republic into the smallest settlement possible. TexPet never had any serious hope of legitimately prevailing on the lawsuits it brought on these claims and opted to maintain them for other purposes instead.\n\n2. Indeed, TexPet managed the cases in such a way as to assure that they would not emerge from the Ecuadorian judiciary's huge backlog of cases and go to judgment, while at the same time self-creating the conditions under which they could claim a denial of justice for delay. TexPet also mis managed it claims, failing to take care to bring some of them within all possibly applicable limitations periods and to keep others current under all possible applicable legal requirements.\n\n3. When reforms, instituted to improve the courts and end the brief period of political turmoil affecting them, resulted in significant progress on that backlog and further action on TexPet's cases, Claimants attacked the dismissals of cases resulting from TexPet's mismanagement as incompetent and unjust. Finally, to evade the requirement that denials of justice must reflect an exhaustion of the court system's remedies, they seized upon reforms in the Republic's courts as a pretext to add a claim of denial of justice based upon a wholly spurious charge of lack of independence. Claimants bear a heavy burden in asking this Tribunal to declare that Ecuador's courts are guilty of a denial of justice. They must overcome TexPet's own conscious passivity in advancing its cases and show that mere court congestion alone — applicable to all litigants — violated international law. They must overcome the presumption that national courts alone are properly enabled to decide matters pertaining to national law. And they must show that the courts' independence has actually been compromised, causing them to be singled out for mistreatment. And they must do all this with clear and convincing evidence. On all counts, Claimants have failed.\n\n4. The very circumstances of TexPet's claims reveal Claimants' bad faith. While Claimants complain about court delays, they themselves continually affirmed in United States courts that the Ecuadorian courts are fair and adequate, notwithstanding their known and growing congestion. They should not be heard now to object on this basis, especially since reforms over the years have reduced court backlogs and expedited the adjudicatory process. This is especially true in light of TexPet's own failure to invoke rights under Ecuadorian law to advance their cases in the queue, despite its representation by distinguished and powerful litigation counsel. TexPet's underlying cases are based on asserted contract rights that were never agreed to by Ecuador. That TexPet did not bring any of these claims until many years after the practices of which it complains had been implemented, and indeed after TexPet had acquiesced in those practices, is itself evidence of the false indignation which accompanied the filing of these claims.\n\n5. Claimants have offered no evidence that any of the judges hearing any of TexPet's cases acted corruptly or with bias. In fact, TexPet has prevailed on the merits before one of the judges, having obtained judgment on the full amount it requested; it has defeated several government motions to dismiss; and it has successfully appealed a dismissal. Along the way TexPet has surely suffered defeats, but the receipt of one or more adverse decisions does not satisfy the Claimants' heavy burden in proving that Ecuador's justice system as a whole failed to accord TexPet due process. The judicial system about which Claimants now complain is a significantly better judicial system than the one that Claimants represented was fair and adequate in the Aguinda action from 1993-2002, and in the Doe action in 2006. This Tribunal surely cannot act as a super-Supreme Court of Ecuador in the stead of that court system.\n\n6. Finally, Claimants cannot establish that TexPet would have prevailed on the merits of its claims before the domestic courts of Ecuador, and thus that it would have suffered a loss even if a denial of justice had in fact occurred. And Claimants' calculation of their losses are so riddled with improper amounts and exaggerations as to warrant dismissal even if Claimants could show that TexPet would have prevailed.\n\n7. As previously urged by Respondent, Claimants' current denial of justice claim should be dismissed because this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claim. But this claim can and should be dismissed \"on the merits\" because (1) Claimants have failed to show bias or corruption of the courts; (2) the delays experienced by TexPet were previously accepted by them; (3) TexPet has affirmatively caused the delays about which Claimants now complain; and (4) Claimants cannot show that any Ecuadorian court, applying the law of Ecuador, would find in their favor in any of the cases.\n\nAcknowledging the Parties' comments on the draft, the Tribunal issued PO II on October 19, 2007, deciding, inter alia, that English and Spanish would be the official languages of the arbitration (with English being authoritative between the two), that the place of arbitration would be The Hague, The Netherlands, and that the venue for the Hearing on Jurisdiction would be San Jose, Costa Rica. PO II also set out the schedule of proceedings, taking into consideration the Parties' previous agreement and the discussions having taken place at the Procedural Meeting on October 2, 2007. For ease of reference, the entire operative provisions of PO II are set out below:\n\nThis Procedural Order No. 2 puts on record the results of the discussion and agreement between the Parties and the Tribunal at the 1st Procedural Meeting held on Tuesday, October 2, 2007, in the Small Court Room of the Peace Palace, The Hague, The Netherlands:\n\n1.

Either Party may publicly disclose submissions made in these proceedings unless there has been a decision by the Tribunal to the contrary.

In order to make most efficient use of time at the Hearing, written Witness Statements shall generally be used in lieu of direct oral examination though exceptions may be admitted by the Tribunal. Therefore, insofar as, at the Hearing, such witnesses are invited by the presenting Party or asked to attend at the request of the other Party, the available hearing time should mostly be reserved for cross-examination and re-direct examination, as well as for questions by the Arbitrators.\n\n7. Expert Evidence\n\nShould the Parties wish to present expert testimony, the same procedure would apply as for witnesses.\n\n8. Hearings\n\nSubject to changes in view of the further procedure up to the Hearings, the following is established for the Hearings:\n\n8.1. The dates are as established in the Timetable above.\n\n8.2.

Should a Hearing on the Merits become necessary, further details shall be established after the Hearing on Jurisdiction and after consultation with the Parties.\n\n8.5.2. Taking into account the time available during the period provided for the Hearing in the Timetable, the Tribunal intends to establish equal maximum time periods both for the Claimants and for the Respondent which the Parties shall have available. Changes to that principle may be applied for at the latest at the time of the Pre-Hearing Conference.\n\n9. Extensions of Deadlines and Other Procedural Decisions\n\n9.1. Short extensions may be agreed between the Parties as long as they do not affect later dates in the Timetable and the Tribunal is informed before the original date due.\n\n9.2. Extensions of deadlines shall only be granted by the Tribunal on exceptional grounds and provided that a request is submitted immediately after an event has occurred which prevents a Party from complying with the deadline.\n\n9.3. The Tribunal indicated to the Parties, and the Parties took note thereof, that in view of travels and other commitments of the Arbitrators, it might sometimes take a certain period for the Tribunal to respond to submissions of the Parties and decide on them.\n\n9.4.

Tribunal Fees\n\nThe Tribunal's hourly billing rate for all time spent on this matter shall be €500 and shall be charged along with any applicable VAT in accordance with paragraph 11 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\nAcknowledging the Parties' comments on the draft, the Tribunal issued PO III on April 21, 2008, regarding the conduct of the Hearing on Jurisdiction. The Tribunal provisionally admitted the alleged new claims under Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, but reserved a final decision on the matter for a later date. The Respondent's request to postpone the date of the jurisdictional hearing was rejected. For ease of reference, the entire operative provisions of PO III are set out below:\n\n1. Introduction\n\n1.1. This Order recalls the earlier agreements and rulings of the Tribunal, particularly in Procedural Order No. 2 sections 3.7. and 8.4.\n\n1.2. In order to facilitate references to exhibits the Parties rely on in their oral presentations, and in view of the great number of exhibits submitted by the Parties to avoid that each member of the Tribunal has to bring all of them to the Hearing, the Parties are invited to bring to the Hearing:\n\nfor the other Party and for each member of the Tribunal Hearing Binders of those exhibits or parts thereof on which they intend to rely in their oral presentations at the hearing, together with a separate consolidated Table of Contents of the Hearing Binders of each Party,\n\nfor the use of the Tribunal, one full set of all exhibits the Parties have submitted in this procedure, together with a separate consolidated Table of Contents of these exhibits.\n\n2.

To make most efficient use of time at the Hearing, written Witness Statements shall generally be used in lieu of direct oral examination though exceptions may be admitted by the Tribunal. Therefore, insofar as, at the Hearing, such witnesses are invited by the presenting Party or asked to attend at the request of the other Party, the presenting Party may introduce the witness for not more than 10 minutes, but the further available hearing time shall be reserved for cross-examination and re-direct examination, as well as for questions by the Arbitrators.\n\n3.3. If a witness whose statement has been submitted by a Party and whose examination at the Hearing has been requested by the other Party, does not appear at the Hearing, his statement will not be taken into account by the Tribunal.

Taking into account the Calculation of Hearing Time attached to this Order, the total maximum time available for the Parties (including their introductory and final statements) shall be as follows:\n\n5 hours for Claimants\n\n5 hours for Respondent\n\nThe time limits \"not more than\" for the Parties' Agenda items above shall be considered as a guideline. However, it is left to the Parties, subject to section 3.2. above, how much of their allotted total time they want to spend on Agenda items in section 4.1. above, subsections 2., 3. b, c, d, and e, 4., 6. and 7. as long as the total time period allotted to them is maintained.\n\n4.5.

The Tribunal authorized two rounds of Post-Hearing Briefs to be submitted simultaneously by June 19, 2009 and July 15, 2009, respectively. The Tribunal also authorized two rounds of Cost Claims to be submitted simultaneously by August 7, 2009 and August 21, 2009, respectively. The Tribunal also requested that the Parties address certain questions specified in the Order in their Post-Hearing Briefs. For ease of reference, the entire operative provisions of PO VI are set out below:\n\nTaking into account the discussion and the agreements reached with the Parties at the Hearing on the Merits held in Washington, D.C. from April 20 to 24 and April 27 to 28, 2009, the Tribunal issues this Procedural Order No. 6 as follows:\n\n1. Post-Hearing Briefs\n\n1.1. By June 19, 2009, the Parties shall simultaneously submit PostHearing Briefs, limited to a maximum of 80 pages (double-spaced) in length, containing the following:\n\n1.1.1. Any comments they have regarding issues raised at the Hearing on the Merits;\n\n1.1.2. To the extent not fully and completely answered during the Hearing on the Merits, separate sections responding in particular to any questions posed by the Tribunal during the Hearing on the Merits as well as those in section 3 below.\n\n1.2. The sections of the Post-Hearing Briefs requested under 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 above shall include short references to all sections in the Party's earlier submissions, as well as to exhibits (including legal authorities, witness statements, and expert statements) and to hearing transcripts on which it relies regarding the respective issue.\n\n1.3. No new documents shall be attached to the Post-Hearing Briefs unless expressly authorized in advance by the Tribunal.\n\n1.4. By July 15, 2009, the Parties shall simultaneously submit a second round of Post- Hearing Briefs, limited to a maximum of 40 pages (double-spaced) in length, but only in rebuttal to the first round Post-Hearing Briefs of the other side.\n\n2. Cost Claims\n\n2.1. By August 7, 2009, the Parties shall simultaneously submit Cost Claims, briefly setting out the costs incurred by each side. Such Cost Claims need not include supporting documentation for the costs claimed.\n\n2.2. By August 21, 2009, the Parties shall simultaneously submit any comments on the Cost Claims submitted by the other side.\n\n3. Questions\n\nIn addition to providing any further comments on the questions already posed during the Hearing on the Merits, the Parties are requested to address the following questions in the Post-Hearing Briefs:\n\n3.1. What is the standard applicable under Article II(7) of the BIT (\"effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights\")? Is that standard lower than the standard for denial of justice?\n\n3.2. Even if the Claimants have the burden of proof to show a denial of justice, is it of any relevance which of the processing of the 7 cases by the courts of Ecuador occurred before the Claimants filed their Notice of Arbitration in December 2006, and which occurred after that point in time?\n\n3.3. What is it about the order of payment to TexPet's legal representative that prevents TexPet from collecting on the judgment in the Refinancing Agreement case? Why cannot TexPet designate its local counsel as its legal representative to collect on the judgment in the Refinancing Agreement case?\n\n3.4. To what extent can the Tribunal apply its own interpretation of the three relevant Contracts?\n\n3.5. To what extent are the conclusions of the court-appointed experts in the seven cases relevant in our context? Does this impact the question of the probability of success or the likely outcome in the Ecuadorian courts?\n\n3.6. Can a State rely on the invalidity of a contract despite it having been signed by its own Ministers?\n\n3.7. What is the Claimants' reason for specifically asking for a declaration that the 1973 and 1977 Agreements were breached as a part of its Relief Sought?\n\n3.8. What is the relevance of the treatment accorded to TexPet's cases (1) by the Ecuadorian courts before the Notice of Arbitration in December 2006 as compared to (2) after the Notice of Arbitration was filed? Is there a difference?\n\n3.9. Apart from,\n\n(1) the references to \"the period between the date of the signature of the herein agreement until 12 months subsequent to that date\" in Section 1 (\"Works of Geology and Geophysics\") and Sections 3 and 3(c) (\"Production\"),\n\n(2) the reference to \"the period between the 12 months of the work program\" in Section 3(g) (\"Production\"), and\n\n(3) the reference to \"this annual period\" in Section 1.2 (\"General Rules that shall rule the Production\"),\n\ndoes the 1977 Agreement contain any indication suggesting that it is limited to a one-year term, having particular regard to the purpose of the 1977 Agreement as set forth in the preambular section entitled \"Object of the Agreement\"?\n\n3.10. In the event that the Tribunal were to consider a monetary award, in order to ensure payment by the Claimants of taxes legitimately due in respect of any such award, what mechanism would the Parties consider to be an acceptable alternative to the Tribunal deducting taxes from any amount awarded?\n\nThe principal relevant provisions of the BIT are set out below:\n\n[Preamble]\n\nThe United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador (hereinafter the \"Parties\");\n\nDesiring to promote greater economic cooperation between them, with respect to investment by nationals and companies of one Party in the territory of the other Party;\n\nRecognizing that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded such investment will stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic development of the Parties;\n\nAgreeing that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic resources;\n\nRecognizing that the development of economic and business ties can contribute to the well-being of workers in both Parties and promote respect for internationally recognized worker rights; and\n\nHaving resolved to conclude a Treaty concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investment;\n\nHave agreed as follows:\n\nArticle I\n\n1.

(a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\n\n(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.\n\n(c) Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\n\n[…]\n\n7. Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investment, investment agreements, and investment authorizations.\n\n[…]\n\nArticle VI\n\n1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\"), provided that the Party is a party to such Convention; or\n\n(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or\n\n(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or\n\n(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(b) once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.\n\n4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:\n\n(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for Purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and\n\n(b) an \"agreement in writing\" for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958 (\"New York Convention\").\n\n5. Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article shall be held in a state that is a party to the New York Convention.\n\n6. Any arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Article shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Party undertakes to carry our without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement."
