        "meta_description": "Since 1991, I have been teaching Mathematics at UPM under different graduate programs, as well as PhD courses and recently Master’s courses once that the Bologna plan was implemented in Spain. In addition to classroom instruction, I have mentoring students on appropriate research topics at Master and PhD programs. Normally I am co-director with colleagues from other Departments creating a strong synergy that was totally positive for the students. I also participated in several courses related to application of Statistics and Modelling using different software to students as well as more general audiences that needs an update or a clear introduction to these subjects. My research interests have been applying powerful mathematical tools in agriculture and environment to address problems in a different way and see what progress can be made. In this sense, beside application of classical Statistic and Modelling analysis, I have been using Lindenmayer systems (_L-systems_) in plant growth, _fractal/multifractal and wavelet analysis in soils and time series studies, Barabasi networks and heterogeneous preferential attachment networks to study soil pore system, artificial networks_ and _fractal filters_ in image analysis. Lately I have been applying all these methodologies in the context of risk analysis and management at CEIGRAM. I have worked with many different people that I've learned so much from the scientific point of view and as a human. At the same time, I have been involved in several book chapters. Writing a book chapter on a topic in which I have worked, it makes me perform a review of the work of many scientists. Opening my mind to understand other methodologies, why were carried out and its evolution is enriching. This simple exercise is rarely done and locked ourselves in our own world giving little chance to make a truly interdisciplinary research. And as an overall conclusion I will say: _\"The more I live, the more I learn. The more I learn, the more I realise how little I know\" _(Michel Legrand).",
