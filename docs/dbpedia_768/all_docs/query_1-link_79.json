        "text": "The UF/IFAS Research Awards Ceremony on May 19th honored three Entomology & Nematology faculty and their colleagues for high impact publications in 2014. Ten such publications were selected for special recognition.\n\nIglesias LE, Nyoike TW, Liburd OE. 2014. Effect of trap design, bait type and age on captures of Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in berry crops. Journal of Economic Entomology.107: 1508-1518.\n\nShin DA, Civana A, Acevedo C, Smartt CT. 2014. Transcriptomics of differential vector competence: West Nile virus infection in two populations of Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus linked to ovary development. BioMed Central Genomics. 15(1): 513.\n\nHajeri S, Killiny N, El-Mohtar C, Dawson WO, Gowda S. 2014. Citrus tristeza virus-based RNAi in citrus plants induces gene silencing in Diaphorina citri, a phloem-sap sucking insect vector of citrus greening disease (Huanglongbing). Journal of Biotechnology. 176: 42-49.\n\nABOVE: Dr. Douglas L. Archer, IFAS AssociateÂ Dean for Research, congratulating Ms. Lindsy Iglesias, Dr. Teresia Nyoike, and Dr. Oscar Liburd, at the 2015 UF/IFAS Research Awards Ceremony.\n\nVote Today!\n\nTwo of our faculty are in the running to be the next Vice President of the Florida Entomological Society. Cast your vote today for Dr. Catharine Mannion or Dr. Hugh Smith. Click here for a ballot and email your vote to Dr. Nan-Yao Su. Â\n\nDr. Eileen Buss, Associate Professor and turf and ornamental entomologist, retired due to health issues from the Department at the end of May 2015. She can be reached by email at turfbug1@gmail.com.\n\nA note from Dr. Marjorie Hoy\n\n~ My retirement started May 4th after 23 years at UF. It has been a challenging and productive time and I hope that I can continue to be productive. So far, my husband (Jim) and I have had a trip to Bonaire to snorkel, and we are planning another to Maine and Nova Scotia this summer. After that, I hope things will settle down a bit. The retirement paperwork is still underway (it is amazing how much there is). I thank all the faculty and staff in the Department for their valued assistance and am grateful for Emeritus status. Please do not hesitate to contact me by email if you have questions. I will be in to the Department to finish some projects, including a possible new book.\n\nMany thanks for the wonderful 23 years! Sincerely,\n\nMarjorie\n\nDr. Nur Tabanca, a natural product chemist from the University of Mississippi, is slated to join the Bloomquist Lab this summer as a Research Scientist. She will be isolating new insecticides and spatial repellents from natural sources.\n\nDr. James P. Cuda and colleagues were featured in the April 14th issue of IFAS NEWS. Their UF/IFAS Extension program on biological control of Tropical Soda Apple won the National Innovative Program Award from the Association of Natural Resource Extension Professionals.\n\nDr. James P. Cuda was featured in a Washington Times article published April 18th titled “Biologists hope lice can attack invasive Brazilian peppertree.” Dr. William Overholt and Cuda are proposing to release the leaflet galling psyllid Calophya latiforceps (Hemiptera: Calophyidae) in Florida for biological control agent of Brazilian peppertree.\n\nDr. James P. Cuda was invited by our IFAS Extension Administration to become a member of the IFAS Extension Invasive Species Leadership Team.\n\nDr. Billy Crow attended the SERA IEG 26 (Southern Turfgrass) meeting in Oklahoma City June 2nd to the 3rd and presented an update on turfgrass nematodes. He also got to attend the College Softball World Series that was going on at the same location, and rooted for the Florida Gators as they repeated as National Champions!\n\nDr. Jim Maruniak received the Student Activities and Involvement award for the Advisor of the Year for 2015. There are almost 1,000 student clubs at the University of Florida, and over 600 faculty advisors, only one faculty member receives this award.\n\nHere is just a portion of the nomination letter from Mason Henehan, the president of the Society for Viral Studies.\n\n“I am writing to nominate Dr. Jim Maruniak for Advisor of the Year due to his outstanding efforts in supporting the Society for Viral Studies student organization. He has deep roots with our organization, as he was the faculty member who was originally approached by the student who started the Society for Viral Studies in 1998. Ever since its inception, Dr. Maruniak has been the advisor for our club and this long-term commitment and experience he has attained in past years has been a bountiful asset in how he has helped us this current academic year. On the whole, the club has grown under his watch to include not only new waves of students each year, but also a diverse array of new activities in various realms from volunteerism to research which highlight his immense impactâ¦. He is incredibly deserving of the honor of “Advisor of the Year”.”"
