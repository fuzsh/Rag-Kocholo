        "text": "Using evidence from field key informant and written questionnaire interviews with agriculture extension officers, focus group discussions with some smallholder farmers, analysis of packaging labels, and a detailed literature review, this paper argues that Malawian smallholder farmers handle herbicides without adequate information about the advantages and negative impacts of such herbicides because, it appears, the agriculture extension workers themselves lack requisite knowledge on herbicide toxicity. Further, the study finds that herbicides are marketed in Malawi in breach of the Malawian law and in contravention of the Rotterdam Convention as the information on the herbicide labels is sometimes inadequate, misleading, and unavailable in local languages. This exposes farmers to potentially carcinogenic chemicals without their knowledge. The paper recommends, inter alia, that an awareness campaign about the long-term harmful effects of herbicides be mounted countrywide and internati...\n\nBackground Pesticides can have negative effects on human and environmental health, especially when not handled as intended. In many countries, agro-input dealers sell pesticides to smallholder farmers and are supposed to provide recommendations on application and handling. This study investigates the role of agro-input dealers in transmitting safety information from chemical manufacturers to smallholder farmers, assesses the safety of their shops, what products they sell, and how agro-input dealers abide by laws and recommendations on best practices for preventing pesticide risk situations. Methods Applying a mixed-methods approach, we studied agro-input dealers in Central and Western Uganda. Structured questionnaires were applied to understand agro-input dealers’ knowledge, attitude and practices on pesticides (n = 402). Shop layout (n = 392) and sales interaction (n = 236) were assessed through observations. Actual behavior of agro-input dealers when selling pesticides was reveale...\n\nPesticides are essential for the control of infestation of disease, insect pests and weeds on different crops. Due to wide usage of synthetic pesticides which may lead to increased exposure and associated environmental and health risks among smallholder farmers in Zambia, a study was undertaken to understand how knowledgeable farmers are on pesticide use and practices. A total of 418 small scale farmers were randomly sampled from Mkushi, Mpongwe, Luangwa, Mbala, Solwezi, Chipata and Kalomo Districts of Zambia. Data pertaining to types of pesticides use, handling, storage and disposal was solicited using structured questionnaires. The data collected was analyzed using SPSS. Findings revealed that of the sampled farmers 43%, 30%, 25% and 17% used Glyphosate, Dicamba, Paraquat and Atrazine respectively as herbicides in Maize. 21% and 14% used Cypermethrine and Monocrotophos respectively as insecticides in both Maize and Soybean. 81% of the sampled farmers used empty containers for either storing drinking water or salt while only 15% wore protective clothing when applying pesticides. Pesticide mishandling occurred regardless of the amount of experience a farmer had using pesticides. 68% of the sampled farmers had never received any formal basic training in pestic ide use, hence a clear knowledge gap. The fact that receipt of basic training was the main predictor of a farmers' level of knowledge on pesticide use, a farmer who had received basic training in appropriate chemical pesticides use, as opposed to one who had not, had a better chance of using chemical pesticides safely and in the right quantities.\n\nThe study evaluated the level of awareness of the risk of pesticide use on the environment in Edo North. The study was conducted among 400 farmers from twenty (20) villages in Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria. Most frequently used pesticides were within the WHO class II pesticides (moderately toxic), which are considered as moderately hazardous. A few cases of highly toxic (DDVP 1000G/L EC) were reported. There was no report of DDT and Endosulfan which have been banned globally or have restricted use under the Stockholm Convention. Major drivers of pesticides purchase was affordability (50.8%). Irrespective of age, majority of the sampled farmers do not read pesticides labels before use, while farmers with no formal education (67.1%), reported they don't read pesticides labels. More, so farmers with less than 5years farming experience (76.3%) also do not read labels before use. Reliance on the success stories of co-farmers and lack of clarity of information on pesticides labels were major reasons for not reading pesticides labels. Generally, farmers' level of awareness of environmental effects of pesticides uses does not significantly depend on the age, educational background and years of farming experience at ρ > 0.05, d = 0.24), (ρ > 0.05, d = 0.29) (ρ > 0.05, d = 0.28) respectively, an indication that farmers don't just like to read labels as long as the pesticides is effective. Detailed information on the knowledge and awareness of environmental risks associated with pesticide use among farmers is essential towards policy making for reducing the risk to the environment.\n\nA critical issue in the context of sustainable agriculture is the reduction of pesticides. Despite well-known adverse effects, farmers around the world continue using pesticides with mostly inappropriate ways. Relevant policies have assumed that farmers themselves are primarily responsible for pesticide misuse. However, the responsibility of pesticide retailers has never been quantified due to the difficulty in obtaining reliable data. An empirical study was conducted with smallholder farmers who collected 9,670 pesticide retailers’ recommendations from 1489 surveys in the highlands of Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. This original design allowed obtaining for the first time genuine responses about pesticide recommendations from retailers at a large scale. When comparing retailers’ recommendations with product datasheets, the results suggest that 88.2% of recommendations standards were incorrectly followed resulting in dosing recommendations that were either excessive or insufficient and ...\n\nThis paper assesses farmers' understanding of the information displayed on pesticides product labels in Ilorin metropolis of Kwara State. Data were obtained using structured questionnaire. A random sampling was employed for selecting 86 respondents representing 20% of the total 430 registered members of farmers association of Nigeria in the metropolis. Descriptive statistics were used as analytical tools. The result shows that majority of the farmers were male and ranges between 31 to 50 years of age. The farmers were literate with majority having secondary education and also with 6 to 10 years experience in pesticides usage and farming. The study further revealed that despite high literacy level among farmers in Ilorin metropolis of Kwara state and widespread experiences in the use of pesticides, majority do not understand the information displayed on pesticide product label. The results showed the information displayed on pesticide product label was not effective in the sense that the farmers do not read the labels let alone understood it .They however preferred the information given by their colleagues. Majority of the farmers keep the pesticides inside their houses, prepare it on the field and discard the empty packages into forest. Most of the farmers know about Dichloro-diphenyl trichloro ethane as the only banned pesticide in circulation. The major problems facing the farmers with regards to understanding pesticide labels are that languages used are mostly technical and foreign. It was suggested that pictorial demonstration and bold images should be used since what is seen are easy understood"
