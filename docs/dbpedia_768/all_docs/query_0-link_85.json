Gómez1, Luis Avilés-Félix1 and Alejandro Butera1\n\n1Centro Atómico Bariloche and Instituto Balseiro, Av. Bustillo 9.500, 8400 Bariloche, Río Negro, Argentina\n\nWe present a study of the evolution of the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in platinum as a function of temperature in a set of bilayer thin films made up of permalloy (Py) covered by Pt. The samples were made using sputtering techniques on naturally oxidized Si wafers. Samples have a fixed Py thickness (tPy = 8 nm) and a varying Pt thickness (tPt= 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 nm). The ISHE voltage was induced by the spin pumping effect occurring at the Py/Pt interface when the ferromagnetic layer is driven to its ferromagnetic resonance condition.\n\nAt room temperature, a positive ISHE voltage is observed in all samples. When the temperature is decreased, the value of the signal also decreases, reaching a vanishing value at a temperature T0 that depends strongly on the Pt thickness. We have found a maximum value of T0 = 215 K for tPt= 2 nm and a minimum T0 = 120 K for tPt= 5 nm. When the temperature is further reduced the signal changes sign and reaches a minimum negative value at a characteristic temperature TM = 70 K, which is approximately the same for all bilayers. However, the maximum absolute value of the ISHE signal that occurs at TM depends on the Pt thickness, tending to decrease when tPt is increased. At temperatures below TM the signal increases sharply to positive values and remains positive down to T = 4K for all samples. The temperature where this sharp change occurs is the same for all films.\n\nAdditional measurements suggest that the Py layer contributes to the temperature evolution of the detected ISHE signal. We discuss a possible explanation of the observed behavior based on the self induced signal on the Py layer, probably due to stress effects caused by the different thermal expansion between the Si substrate and the metallic layers.\n\nREFRACTIVE INDEX AND BANDGAP MODULATION IN AL2O3 - ZNO ULTRATHIN MULTILAYERS PREPARED BY ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION\n\nJ. López1, E. Solorio2, F. F. Castillón1, R. Machorro1, N. Nedev3, M.H. Farías1 and H. Tiznado1\n\n1 Centro de Nanociencias y Nanotecnología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Apdo. Postal 14, C.P. 22800, Ensenada B.C  México.2 Universidad Autónoma de Baja California, Km. 103 Carretera Tijuana - Ensenada, Ensenada, Baja California C.P. 22860 - México.3 Instituto de Ingeniería, Universidad Autónoma de Baja california, Blvd. Benito Juárez S/N C.P. 21280 Mexicali, B. C., Mexico\n\nThis research focuses on the study of the refractive index and bandgap behavior in ultrathin multilayer films of Al2O3- ZnO system grown via atomic layer deposition technique (ALD) on Si (100). The multilayer configuration stack consists in alternate layers of Al2O3 with constant thickness (2 nm) and ZnO layers with varying thickness grown on Al2O3 in order to reach a total thickness desired. A set of 10 samples based on bilayers with different thickness ratio (2:X) were prepared, X refers to the ZnO layer thickness (in nm), which is proportional to the number (N) of cycles (1, 3, 5, 7,10, 20, 30, 50, 75 and 100) for the ZnO precursor. Refractive index (n) and optical bandgap (Eg) of each multilayer were studied via spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). Images of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were made in cross-sectional mode for the sake to verify the multilayer total thickness and corroborate the accuracy of the model used in the SE measures. The morphological properties were studied via Atomic Force Microscopy. The results from AFM images analysis showed that the surface roughness of the multilayers increases of 0.2 to 1.2 nm, as the ZnO layer thickness increases, these values were less than 2% as compared to the total thickness of the ultrathin multilayer. Ellipsometry data treated through the General Oscillator optical model reveals that the refractive index decreases for thinner bilayers, i.e. for samples with less number N cycles of ZnO precursor (1 to 7), the refractive index profiles, not showed marked peaks in UV region (200-400 nm), this behavior indicated that transparency for this bilayers increased. In addition the optical bandgap energy Eg determined using a Tauc  Lorentz model, allows make evident that, when the bilayer thickness begins to increase, the optical bandgap gradually decreases and exhibits a variation of ΔEg ~ 1.5 eV. The maximum and minimum energy bandgap value Eg obtained for this material was 4.86 eV, and 3.32 eV respectively. These results reveal that the refractive index and optical bandgap in this material can be modulated systematically as a function of bilayer thickness. This behavior has great importance for optical applications, suitable in the development of devices with response in the UV spectral range; for example in optoelectronics area.\n\nThis work was partially supported by DGAPA-UNAM through PAPIIT research projects IN105114, IN107715 and IN106715.

Nowadays, there are many applications of polymer nanocomposites including coatings and architectural, they are also parts of automotive and construction industry among others. In the present study, mechanical, and thermal properties, and wettability angle of especially prepared acrylic montmorillonita (MMT) nanocomposites were investigated. The acrylics were based on butyl acrylate (BA), styrene (sty), and methacrylic acid (MAA), and the nano-clay was Na-montomorillonite (MMT). The MMT clay was added to the polymer, the mixing matrix in physical state solution called (blend). The state of aggregation was investigated by mechanical properties (Youngs modulus). The increment in concentration of MMT in the polymer matrix produces more than one order of magnitude gain in the Youngs modulus. However by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), lost thermograms show an increase in the glass transition of nanocomposites for all the concentrations of MMT. Furthermore, it was also studied by wetting angle, to determine how much water is retained on the surface of the nanocomposite, the results showed that by increasing the particle of nano-clay in the polymer matrix induces a hydrophobic property to the nanocomposite.\n\nOPTICAL AND STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION OF SRO FILMS USING SBA-15\n\nI. García1, C. Morales1, M. Zambrano1 , T. Díaz1, E. Rosendo1, R. Galeazzi1, R. Romano1, G. García1.\n\n1CIDS-ICUAP, Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla 14 sur y Av. San Claudio, Col. San Manuel, C.P. 72570, Puebla México.\n\nSi-rich silicon oxide (SRO) films were obtained by hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) technique using SBA-15 as source of silicon and oxygen atoms. The hydrogen flow used in the growing of the SRO films was varied from 20 to 150 sccm, and all experiments were carried out at atmospheric pressure. This hydrogen flow was used as reactant gas and SBA-15 pills were used as solid source. Silicon (100) n-type was used as substrate and it was placed in a horizontal position into the reactor. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns it was observed the presence of cubic silicon oxide and cubic silicon in the SRO films. The intensity of (211) and (411) silicon planes increased when the hydrogen flow into the reactor increased as well. The (320) and (410) silicon oxide planes remained almost constant in all samples. On the other hand, from the FTIR spectra it was observed the characteristic vibration modes of silicon oxide in all samples: stretching mode at 1080 cm-1, bending mode at 810 cm-1 and rocking mode at 456 cm-1. In addition to these modes, one mode located at 880 cm-1 which is assigned to Si-H, and another mode observed at 610cm-1 which is related to Si-Si bonds, were observed too. The photoluminescence spectrum shown a strong emission at 1.84 eV, when a low H2 flux was used. This emission is related to the quantum confinement effect. Besides, it was also observed another weak emissions located at 2.0 eV, and at 2.27 and 2.53 eV related to Si-H and to silicon oxide species respectively.\n\nSYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MODIFIED MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES IN NANOMEDICINE\n\nNadia M. Dieguez-Armenta1, Paul Zavala-Rivera2, Armando Lucero-Acuña2\n\n1 Departamento de Física, Posgrado en Nanotecnología, Universidad de Sonora, 83000, México. 2 Departamento de Ingeniería Química y Metalurgia, Universidad de Sonora, 83000, México\n\nNanotechnology applied for the treatment, diagnosis, monitoring and control of biological systems have recently been referred as nanomedicine [1]. Among them, an increasing area of development has been the theranostic materials, which are those that can be used as contrast agents and therapy at the same time [2,5]. Currently, the research in biomedical applications of nanoparticles within the field of therapeutics focused on cancer has been intensified. Such nanoparticles are mostly made of iron oxide, which depending of its size, could have a superparamagnetic behavior, i.e. they require a large magnetic field to achieve its magnetic ordering below the critical temperature and it disappears in the absence of the aforementioned magnetic field [3].With an appropriate chemical surface, magnetic nanoparticles have been widely used clinically in biomedical applications, such as contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging, tissue repair, immunoassay, detoxification of biological fluids, hyperthermia, drug delivery and cell separation [4]. In this work, we focus on the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles coated with oleic acid which are carried out by the sonolysis method; the advantage of this synthesis is the fact of using low power equipment found in any laboratory such as the ultrasonic bath. Likewise, we looked for control of the size during the centrifugation process and to the modification into water-soluble nanoparticles for further functionalization with L-Cysteine and coating it with gold. Leading to the generation of a functionalized magnetic nanoparticle which present hyperthermia and contrast agent capabilities at the same time.\n\nENHANCED ELECTRIC-FIELD-INDUCED WRITE EFFICIENCY AND THERMAL STRESS STABILITY OF MAGNETIC TUNNEL JUNCTIONS WITH AN MGO/PZT/MGO TUNNEL BARRIER\n\nXiang Li,1 Diana Chien,2 Kin Wong,1 Guoqiang Yu,1 Mark A.

[1-2] The electric-field- or voltage-induced magnetization switching exploits the effect of voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) to temporarily lower the energy barrier during write operation, thus drastically reducing the write energy compared with current-controlled mechanisms such as spin transfer torque and spin-orbit torque.\n\nIn this poster, we first present results that the write efficiency, i.e. VCMA coefficient, of the MTJs is enhanced by 40% by integrating an ultra-thin PZT film with high dielectric constant into the MgO tunnel barrier. The MTJs with the MgO/PZT/MgO barrier fabricated via a combination of sputtering and atomic layer deposition techniques also possess a sizeable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of more than 50% at room temperature. [3]\n\nHowever, in order to integrate the MeRAM as an embedded memory into advanced CMOS back-end-of-line processes, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and VCMA must be sustained when annealing temperatures above 400°C are used. We will then present results on Mo/CoFeB/MgO-based structures where PMA and VCMA can be sustained at annealing temperature as high as 430°C. The PMA and VCMA both increase with higher annealing temperature and a VCMA coefficient of more than 50 fJ/(V-m) is demonstrated at 430°C.

BNNS also provides relatively smooth surface, free from dangling bonds, as a result improve the physical properties of graphene in case of graphene placed on BNNS. However, it is challenging to produce large scale BNNS. In this presentation, we will demonstrate how we successfully synthesized large assembly of overlapping BNNS (50×50 µm2) using low pressure tube furnace CVD technique. Graphene samples were prepared with hot filament CVD (HFCVD) technique. The electrical properties of graphene e.g. sheet resistance, charge transport properties and thermal conductivity are investigated by placing graphene on BNNS (G/BNNS). The physical properties of 2D stacked materials G/BNNS will be demonstrated on the basis of sheet resistance measurements, thermal conductivity, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopic investigations, respectively.\n\nANTIOXIDANT EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM Y2O3·CEO2\n\nMiguel Sánchez Méndeza, Ángel de Jesús Morales Ramíreza, Brenely González Penguellya, Luis Alberto Hernández Sotoa, Celestino Odín Ramírez Navab, Joel Moreno Palmerinc\n\naCentro de Investigación e Innovación Tecnológica (CIITEC), Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN), Cerrada de Cecati S/N.

Centro, Guanajuato, Gto., C.P. 36000 MÉXICO\n\nThe aim of the present work to synthesize powders of yttrium oxide-cerium oxide by the sol-gel process starting from precursors of cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate and yttrium chloride hexahydrate as metal sources, and ethanol as dissolvent. 8 different molars relations (CeO2-Y2O3) systems were studied to compare the antioxidant activity between them and determine the best combination. From the powders, the antioxidant properties were evaluated through the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) test, and it has been found that the optimal composition is 98% CeO2 and 2%Y2O3 with a scavenging activity of 64 %. Also the structural properties have been studied by FTIR and DRX, resulting in the typical cubic phase. Morphological studies showed that the particles are highly agglomerated and individually consists of rounded shape; however there is no obvious difference between compositions, therefore the antioxidant difference between samples could be related with the compositional changes.\n\nSHALLOW INDIUM+ ION IMPLANTATION INTO GAN\n\nC. A. Hernández-Gutiérrez1, Yuriy Koudriavtsev1, Dagoberto Cardona1, Y. L. Casallas-Moreno1, G. Santana-Rodríguez2, A. G. Hernandez1, A Guillen1, M. López-López1.\n\n1 Centro de Investigación y Estudios Avanzados del IPN, DF, C.P. 07360, México.2 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Coyoacán, DF , C.P. 04510, México.\n\nIon beams have been used to nucleate embedded nanocrystals into different material matrix, such as using of N implantation into InP and N co-implantation into Si[1]. By other hand there has been a lot of interest in indium nitride materials due to their potential applications in optoelectronic devices. Indium nitride presents high mobility and high saturation velocity due to its low effective mass, which makes it applicable in high speed and high frequency electronic devices. It is shown in the literature that it is possible to operate indium nitride-based light emitting diodes at spectral wavelengths ranging from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nInspired in the importance of InN and the possibility to form nanocrystals into other material by ion implantation. In this work we present a shallow (low energy)/(high dose) ion implantation of In+ into pGaN to study the possibility to form nanocrystal nucleation and its effect in luminescence emision. The characterization was performed by SIMS, HXRD, Raman and Photoluminescence. SIMS was used to study implantation distribution and its redistribution by thermal treatment, since an out-diffusion was observed as thermal annealing increase causing a reduction of its atomic concentration form 2x1021 to 5x1020 cm-3 for as implanted sample to annealed at 900°C respectively. Structural characterization by HRXD and Raman revels crystal recovery for high temperature as 900°C. From PL spectroscopy red shift was found for as implanted sample and the shift was decreased as annealing temperature increase. Furthermore an additional transition was observed around to 1.5 eV attributed to InN nanocrystals emission. In conclusion the ion implantation at low energies and high dose of In+ into GaN was studied by analytical techniques where interesting emission was observed attributed to quantum confinement due InN nanocrystal nucleation into GaN.\n\nSYNTHESIS OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL MoS2 BY A CVD PROCESS\n\nYan Jiang1, Jingbiao Cui1.\n\n1Department of Physics and Materials Science, University of Memphis, 216 Manning Hall, Memphis, TN, 38152, USA.\n\nTwo-dimensional single and few layers of MoS2 have been attract much attention due to their unique property and potential for applications. Synthesis of large area MoS2 on substrate will lead to possible device fabrication. In this study, large area MoS2 of high crystallinity and large size were synthesized by a Chemical Vapor Deposition process. Both triangle-shape-flake and continuous film of monolayer and multilayer MoS2 were obtained. Analysis of layer roughness, size, thickness, uniformity and crystallinity were studied by optical microscope, AFM, SEM, and Raman. The effects of precursor concentration, pressure in chamber, gas flow rate and plasma treatment on MoS2 layer growth were also investigated in order to understand the growth mechanism of triangle-shape MoS2 on SiO2/Si substrate. Understanding of the initial growth was also achieved by studying the crucial role played by the substrate surface condition in MoS2 growth. It was found that the right surface condition before deposition is necessary for successful growth while other conditions were kept the same. The study of growth process will eventually help deposit ultra large size MoS2 layers of wafer scale for applications.\n\nROBOTIC APPROACH TO THE MECHANICAL TESTING OF NANOSTRUCTURES\n\nS. Muntwyler1, F. Beyeler1,\n\n1 FemtoTools AG Furtbachstasse 4 8107 Buchs/ZH Switzerland\n\nThe continuing trend towards miniaturization has been a driver for the development of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Fueled by the resulting smaller size of components and products as well as the resulting higher performance such as the lower switching times and higher driving frequencies, the dimensions of these sensors and actuators are now reaching the nanoscale. With a size that is only a small multiple larger than the atoms of which they are composed, the mechanical and electrical behavior of nanostructures can no longer be calculated using scaling law. While quantum mechanics provides a theoretical basis to qualitatively understand the expected behavior, a quantitative way to measure the mechanics of these nanotubes, films and wires is needed for the accurate determination of the performance and design of reliable nanosystems.\n\nThis work presents a nanorobotic system for the direct and accurate measurement of the mechanical properties of nanostructures. Testing principles such as compression-, tensile-, cyclic- or fracture-tests are enabled by pushing or pulling a microforce sensor on the nanostructures while using position encoders to measure their deformation. From the resulting force-versus-deformation (stress-versus-strain) curves, the material properties of these nanostructures are quantitatively determined.\n\nIn-situ Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) mechanical testing is demonstrated using the microrobotic system. The imaging capabilities of the SEM enable an accurate sample-to-sensor alignment as well as observation of the sample during the load application Given the typical analytical working distance of SEMs between 5 and 8 mm, a highly compact MEMS-based microforce sensor has been developed that allows for the testing at this small space constrains. Furthermore, for the accurate measurement of the sample deformation a high resolution piezo-scanner is used with closed-loop capacitive position feedback. This allows for the mechanical testing of nanostructures with forces in the nano-to-millinewton and deformations in the sub-nanometer range.\n\nSENSOR BASED ON THIN FILM OF ZnO NANOPARTICLES\n\nC.

Instituto Politeécnico Nacional, No. 2508, Cd. de México, 07360, México\n\nIn the past few decades, metal oxides like ZnO, SnO2 , have been considered to be the most prominent materials for gas sensing applications, due to the sensitivity of their electrical conductivity to the ambient gas composition; which arises from charge transfer interactions with reactive gases like CO, NO, hydrocarbons, volatile compounds and another gases.\n\nMany techniques have been reported in order to synthesize nanostructured materials, like sputtering, Sol-Gel process, chemical vapor deposition, and spray pyrolysis, within methods, Sol-Gel process offers a simple, low cost and highly controlled way for synthesis of nanostructures.\n\nIn this research, zinc chloride has been used as precursor and zinc oxide nanostructures have been synthesized by Sol-Gel process using deionized water and 2-propanol as solvents; in order to evaluate their influence on the final materials and their properties. The thin films of synthesized samples were deposited on glass substrates by the dipping method. The structure and morphology of crystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Their sensing response to CO was investigated at different operating temperatures and sensitivity curves are presented for samples synthesized in water and 2-propanol solvents. The SEM analysis revealed that ZnO thin films have yielded to different morphologies depending on the solvent, and material was found on the non-immersed side of the substrate attributable to migration during the dip-coating process. XRD analysis show that the samples presents the ZnO wurtzite structure. In EDS analysis it was found the presence of chlorine on the sample, opening the possibility the presence of zinc oxychloride.\n\nCOMPARISON OF THE EXPERIMENTAL CARRIER TRANSPORT IN MIS DEVICES FABRICATED WITH ULTRA-THIN Al2O3 WITH STANDARD CONDUCTION MODELS AND SIMULATIONS\n\nMolina Reyes Joel1, Uribe Vargas Hector Manuel1, Carlos Zuniga1 and Wilfrido Calleja1\n\n1Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE), Grupo de Microelectrónica. Tonantzintla, Puebla, 72840, México. E-mail: jmolina@inaoep.mx\n\nUnderstanding conduction mechanisms (CMs) through a thin dielectric oxide is important in state-of-the-art Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This is because when an Electric field (E) is applied across the dielectric film; an undesired current appears which degrades the behavior of the device, thus shortening its life-span. One of the most widely used dielectric in microelectronics is Aluminum Oxide (Al2O3) because it presents a large bandgap (~8.8 eV) and relatively high-dielectric constant (k~9); it also presents great thermal stability and can passivate important interfaces with other electronic materials thus enhancing the performance of electron devices.\n\nThis work reviews the conduction mechanisms in Metal-Insulator-Semiconductor (MIS) devices fabricated using ultra-thin Al2O3 (5nm and 10 nm) deposited by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) at relatively low processing temperatures. After gate patterning, thermal treatment was performed using Forming Gas (H2/N2) at 450° C for 30 minutes. MIS devices were then electrically characterized using standard I-V and C-V measurements, taking the devices to dielectric breakdown; afterwards, experimental measurements were compared with semi-empirical tunneling models like Direct tunneling (DT), Ohmic Conduction (OC), Poole-Frenkel emission (PF) and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling (FN) in order to determine the precise conduction mechanisms and their corresponding physical ´parameters. After dielectric breakdown, Schottky diode conduction is obtained, thus demonstrating the nature of the post-breakdown event. Once these well known semi empirical models were validated through standard equations, SILVACO simulations were made in order to further validate the proposed models. Afterwards, physical parameters before and after thermal annealing such as effective mass (m), barrier height () (before and after breakdown), and trap energy level ( were extracted. Finally, only one self-consistent equation containing all physical parameters and conduction models is obtained.\n\nZnO NANOSTRUCTURES: PROPERTIES AND APPLICATIONS\n\nHerrera, Rosario1, J.

Two 5M solutions, prepared separately, from zinc acetate and ammonium carbonate dissolved in ethanol, were used as precursor and precipitant agents, respectively. After, the two solutions were mixed and heated at 70°C; the resultant solution was under constant magnetic stirring at 500 rpm during 2 h. The paste obtained was dried in air at 100°C for one hour, and the powders were calcined at 400°C in a normal atmosphere. Structural properties were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), whereas the morphological properties were obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). From the synthesized ZnO powders, 10 mm diameter pellets were manufactured with a mechanical press at 10 Ton during 5 min. Sensing properties of pellets were measured in an atmosphere of propane gas (C3H8) at different temperatures and gas concentrations. Finally, the photocatalytic activity of the ZnO pellets was evaluated by measurement of degradation of methylene blue (MB) under UV light at room temperature. The evolution of the MB degradation was monitored by UVvis spectrometry.\n\nSYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SILICA COLLOIDAL PARTICLES FUNCTIONALIZED WITH MOLECULAR SWITCHES FOR SELF-ASSEMBLY\n\nJ.A. Tapia-Burgos1, A. Kozina1.\n\n1Instituto de Química, UNAM. Circuito Exterior CP 04510,Cd Universitaria,Insurgentes Sur, Mexico City, Mexico.\n\nIn the recent years, there has been an increased interest in the study of materials sensitive to different stimuli, such as the temperature, electric field, the quality of solvents and light, among others, depending on the desired property for diverse applications. One of the stimuli of our interest is the UV light presented by the azobenzene group. This group changes its conformation from trans to cis on irradiation with UV light. This process is reversible applying white light. When the azobenzene changes its conformation, the dipole moment of the azo-group also changes, producing a certain effect on the system. In the case of colloidal systems, this might result in colloidal self-assembly because of change of inter-particle interactions due to differences in the dipole moment of the azo-groups attached to the particles surface, generating particle aggregation.\n\nIn this work we present the results of the presence of azobenzene group attached to particle surface on particle aggregation behavior. To achieve this goal, we designed and synthetized two azo-compounds with different properties. The first one has a OCF3 group in order to increase the dipole moment on UV light illumination and maximize the phenomena of self-assembly. The second one is a symmetric compound with the capacity for cross-coupling the particles depending on the UV light irradiation time. These compounds are used to decorate silica particles previously functionalized with (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES). We characterized the particle self-assembly and cross-coupling in response to the UV light by diverse techniques, such as dynamic light scattering, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy and zeta- potential.\n\nENHANCED VOLTAGE CONTROL OF PERPENDICULAR MAGNETIC ANISOTROPY IN MAGNETIC TUNNEL JUNCTIONS USING ULTRATHIN PZT COMPOSITE OXIDE TUNNELING BARRIERS (NSF ERC TANMS)\n\nKevin Fitzelli, Diana Chieni, Xiang Liii, Kin Wongii, Guoqiang Yuii, Shauna Robbennoltiii, Sarah Tolbertiii, Pedram Khalili Amiriii, Kang L.

This can be accomplished using the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect, which forms the basis of next-generation magnetoelectric MRAM devices. Specifically, applying an electric field across a CoFeB/MgO interface can decrease the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy field as a result of the altered electron density at the interface, thus destabilizing the magnetization state and allowing for its efficient and deterministic reorientation with a small applied magnetic field. This operation principle stands in contrast to that of STT-RAM, which uses upwards of 100 fJ to write a single bit (300,000 times more energy than the actual energy barrier to switching).\n\nPrevious research on CoFeB/oxide interfaces has shown that increasing the dielectric constant of the oxide layer also increases the sensitivity of the interfacial magnetic anisotropy energy to an applied electric field.1 Lead zirconate titanate (PZT), having excellent ferroelectric properties including a large dielectric constant, is therefore a prime candidate for integration into such oxide layers in an attempt to maximize the VCMA effect. Using atomic layer deposition (ALD), PZT was thus incorporated into magnetic tunnel junctions having MgO/PZT/MgO multilayer composite tunneling barriers. Our group has shown that MRAM devices fabricated using these MgO/PZT/MgO tunneling barriers resulted in a 40% increase in the VCMA coefficient (and thus substantial energy savings) over magnetic tunnel junctions simply employing MgO tunneling barriers, despite the PZT layer being amorphous.2 Our most recent work has focused on the crystallization of these ultrathin PZT layers, which would cause an even larger dielectric response (even greater energy savings) and open an avenue toward four-state memory devices relying on the ferroelectric polarization of the PZT.\n\nRAPID METHODS FOR THE DETECTION OF WATERBORNE PATHOGENS USING 2D ATOMIC LAYERS\n\nGregory Hunter1, Nirul Masurkar1 and Leela Mohana Reddy Arava1\n\n1 Wayne State University\n\nHarmful diseases and productivity losses triggered by water and food borne pathogenic bacteria have attracted considerable attention in recent years. These pathogenic bacteria have been found everywhere to disturb the health and safety of the worlds populations of humans, animals and plants. Various approaches have been explored for the detection of bacteria, including the culture and colony counting method, immunology-based method and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The culture and colony counting method is a traditional method, which has been used for the detection and identification of pathogens. Although this approach of detection is reliable but it is labor intensive and time consuming (5-7 days), which counterfeit the idea of on spot bacteria detection. However, developments of rapid methods for the detection of waterborne pathogens are still key issues, including differentiation of live and dead cells, cost, automation, reliable, simple fabrication and accuracy. Here, we present rapid and on spot detection of water borne pathogenic bacteria using two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, such as graphene or transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). Effect of applied current TMD FET-based biosensors concentration and its sensitivity towards Biomolecule (E-Coli) will be presented.\n\nBIOSYNTHESIS OF MoS2 CRYSTALS BY MICROBIAL METHOD\n\nGoldie Oza1, M. Ravichandran1, S. Velumani1\n\n1 SEES, cinvestav-ipn, mexico DF\n\nSince the isolation of graphene, two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted significant attention for various electronic device applications. Transition metal dichalcogenides, MX2 (M=Mo, W; X=S, Se, Te) 2D crystals is considered as an alternative to graphene for their semiconducting properties and presence of a band gap. Direct band gap of a monolayer MoS2 can be a promising material for optoelectronic and field effect transistor applications.\n\nHere, we demonstrate synthesis of MoS2 crystals by a bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this process, we deposited a thin MoO3 film on SiO2 substrate using thermal evaporator. Subsequently, we carried out its interaction with P.aeruginosa extract. We studied the effect of MoO3 film thickness, sulfur reaction duration and growth temperature on crystals growth process. We found that controlling the growth process crystals can be obtained directly on the SiO2 substrate. Synthesized materials were characterized with Raman, UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies. In the conference we discuss detailed synthesis process of highly crystalline MoS2 crystals.\n\nEFFECT OF SPEED AND MILLING TIME OF THE PRECURSOR SOLUTION INTENDED FOR OBTAINING ZnO THIN FILMS\n\nViridiana Mata1, A.

F., MEXICO.2Departamento de Ingeniería Eléctrica-SEES, Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional, CINVESTAV-IPN, D. F., MEXICO.\n\nZinc oxide (ZnO) in thin film form is a versatile material due to a wide numbers of characteristics, such as simultaneous high conductivity and transmittance in the visible, a high catalytic activity, piezoelectricity and chemical stability. As a consequence, a lot of applications have been generated, such as transparent and conductive oxide (TCO) in thin film solar cells, antireflective coatings for silicon solar cells, gas sensors, degradation of water contaminants by advanced oxidation techniques, as well as antimicrobial applications, among others. In this work, ZnO oxide thin films were deposited on soda lime glass substrates by the ultrasonic spray pyrolysis technique; the zinc precursor (zinc acetylacetonate) was previously milled by using a Pulverisette 7 premium line planetary ball milling. The milling process was carried out at different times, 60 to 180 min, and milling speeds, 300 to 600 rpm. The ball to power ratio was 7:1 in a tungsten carbide medium. The effect of the ball milling speed and time on the physical properties and photocatalytic response was studied. The structure and morphology of the ZnO powders and thin films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Optimal conditions to achieve the best photocatalytic characteristics were a speed of 500 rpm and 60 min of milling time.\n\nSYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SILVER NANOPARTICLES (AgNPs) SUPPORTED ON HYDROXYAPATITE\n\nD.

Múgica S/N Ciudad Universitaria, 58030, Morelia, Michoacán.\n\nNano-silver, due to its antimicrobial properties, has had a great impact in the modern life, because currently it is used in a lot of applications like for example in the medical-pharmaceutical industry; for that reason the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are studied supported on different materials. In this work an investigation of the nanocomposite formed by AgNPs with hydroxyapatite has been carry out. The AgNPs help to inhibit growth of the microorganisms over the hydroxyapatite. The particles were prepared with polyol and chemical reduction methods, subsequently, they were combined with hydroxyapatite by two methods; in the first one, the wetting method, the synthesized AgNPs were combined with the dust of hydroxyapatite, the second method, the AgNPs were synthesized over the hydroxyapatite. Several techniques like SEM with EDS, TEM, XRD, FTIR and UV-VIS were used to characterize the samples to show the interaction silver-hydroxyapatite. The silver nanoparticles were obtained with a homogenous distribution and average particle size of 4 nm. The antibacterial effect is observed against E. coli (ATCC 25922) by agar diffusion test.\n\nSYNTHESIS OF GOLD NANOPARTICLES IN NONAQUEOUS MEDIA\n\nS. Madrigal-Ortiz1, M.T. Varela-Toribio2, D.

Currently there are numerous methods of synthesis that allow to obtain nanoparticles (NPs) of various materials, controlling the composition and size; however, control his shape is still a challenge. The use of a new type of ionic liquid (IL), known as deep eutectic solvent, offers a green route for obtaining gold nanostructures star-shaped.\n\nThis specific morphology presents a large surface area and a high reactivity, which is useful for various applications, such as biomedicine, development of biosensors, catalysis and bioimaging.\n\nIn the synthesis process, gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) and L-ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) were used as precursor of Au and reducer, respectively. This synthesis is based on the redox reaction between HAuCl4·3H2O and the L-ascorbic acid, with a stoichiometric ratio of 1: 7.79 at 90 ° C for 1 hour.\n\nThe ionic liquids components were urea, thiourea and choline chloride. The ionic liquid with which we worked was composed with a molar ratio of 2:1 of urea/choline chloride and it was analyzed under the same synthesis conditions, varying only the amount of thiourea.\n\nThe nPs solution was subjected to UV-Vis analysis in order to identify the plasmon of resonance. Subsequently the NPs were purified and centrifuged. The remaining solid was dried and characterized by the technique of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).\n\nBIOCOMPATIBILITY OF PALLADIUM NANOSTRUCTURES AS A PROMISE MATERIAL IN NANOMEDICINE FIELD\n\nMarco Yaxal Arciniega-Cano1, Jorge Alverto Roacho-Pérez1, Oseas Arciniega-Cano1, Carlos Alberto Martínez-Pérez1, Claudia Alejandra Rodríguez-González1, Imelda Olivas-Armendáriz1, Perla Elvia García Casillas1 and Christian Chapa-González1\n\n1Instituto de Ingeniería y Tecnología, Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juárez. Ave. del Charro 610 Nte. CP 32310, Cd. Juárez, Chih. México\n\nThe knowledge of materials and phenomena occurring at nanoscale has come across medicine fields enabling to propose novel specialized applications. Despite their outstanding biocompatibility, chemical and physical properties of palladium (Pd) nanostructures have been absent from Nanomedicine field. Because these nanomaterials could mean a new paradigm in modern medicine, the biocompatibility of these materials obtained from two precursors and using ascorbic acid as reduction agent and CTAB as cationic surfactant is reported. The resultant particles were characterized to be the pure Pd crystalline with a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure according to the XRD analysis (Cu Kα = 0.154 nm). The SEM images demonstrated that the average diameter and morphology of Pd nanostructures were affected mainly by the precursor used; nanocubes (NC) with average particle size 2PdCl4; and nanodendrites (ND) with average particle size 572.4±200.9nm were obtained employing K2PdCl4 as precursor. The biocompatibility of Pd nanostructures were verified by incubating with fibroblasts cultures at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h followed by test of metabolic reduction of salt tetrazolium. Our results show that, NC do not generate a critical cellular cytotoxicity, maintaining viability percentage above 80 %. On the other hand, ND indicates 50 % of viability. Neither the ND nor the NC source exhibits increasing cytotoxic activity in any of the periods of incubation at the concentrations tested (1 µg ml−1 to 1250 µg ml−1) according to statistical tests of ANOVA (α = 0.05). Furthermore, the results suggest that Pd nanostructures size and morphology affect the biocompatibility since NC present a more stable reduction rate in its formation. In contrary, ND present a fast reduction rate and a more unstable morphology, this could be associated with the cell cytotoxicity. These biocompatible performance may qualify Pd nanostructures as future key players in the Nanomedicine field.\n\nFORMATION OF TIN DIOXIDE THIN FILMS USING CHEMICAL SPRAY TECHNIQUES: SUBSTRATE TEMPERATURE FOR ENHANCING THE ELECTRICAL AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES\n\nE.

The effects of substrate temperature on the electrical and optical properties of tin dioxide [SnO2] films were investigated in the visible range. The average transmittance increased with increase in substrate temperature from 44.6% in sample A to 76.9% in sample D.\n\nThe electrical conductivity of this material shows a drastic increase between 31.76 S/m (sample B, 350 0C) and 386.72 S/m (sample C, 375 0C) with increase in substrate temperature.\n\nOptical band gap for direct band gap increased with increase in substrate temperature. The refractive index also varied with increase in substrate temperature. The obtained results revealed that the optical and electrical properties of the films were greatly affected by substrate temperature.\n\nRICE HUSK ASH A SUSTAINABLE SILICA SOURCE FOR SYNTHESIS OF HIERARCHICAL NANOSTRUCTURES\n\nK.

Agricultural wastes, like rice husk ash (RHA), have a great potential due to its availability and unique chemistry-related features. Its high silica content allows its use as a suitable source for silica-based nanostructured materials.\n\nIn the other hand, the synthesis of mesoporous silica with different morphologies and adjustable pore size has been studied worldwide for applications such as catalysis, separation, adsorption, and templates for new materials. The main interest in the development of these materials is to obtain a structure with a specific combination of pore sizes, hierarchical mesoporous silica provides this advantage.\n\nIn this work, hierarchical mesoporous silica was synthesized by a mixed surfactant system of F127-P123 copolymer triblocks, using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and RHA as silica source. In a typical sol-gel synthesis route, organic-inorganic templates were prepared and later the resulting gel was aged under static conditions adding chemically treated and untreated RHA. Hierarchical mesoporous materials were obtained after the removal of templates by calcination. For structural, morphological and thermal characterization, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Nitrogen isothermal adsorption and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used. The particles obtained have different morphologies, high surface area, high thermal stability and hexagonal mesophases.\n\nThese characteristics make the rice husk ash an interesting source to design new nanostructured materials and open possibilities for new sustainable synthesis routes and applications.\n\nINCLUSION IN SITU OF AU NANOPARTICLES IN POROUS SILICON STRUCTURE\n\nFrancisco Severiano-Carrillo1, Valentín Lopez-Gayou1, Godofredo García-Salgado2, Abdu Orduña-Diaz1, Marlon Rojas-Lopez1, Raúl Delgado-Macuil1.\n\n1 Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Centro de Investigación en Biotecnología Aplicada Unidad Tlaxcala, carretera a Santa Inés Tecuexcomac, a 1.5 Km, Ex-Hacienda San Juan Molino, 90700, Tlaxcala, Tlax., México. 2 CIDS-ICUAP, Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, 14 sur y Avenida San Claudio, Edif. 137, 72570, Puebla, Pue., México.\n\nThe porous silicon (PS) is a material with a huge potential to be applied to different scientific fields. PS has interesting properties; its high surface area and open structure that give it a high reactivity besides optical (luminescence at room temperature) and electrical properties (change of the resistivity). Because of the PS properties, the efforts have been devoted to the incorporation of different materials in the porous network, forming nanocomposite materials. Among the materials that seek to incorporate in the PS are various metals (such as gold and silver). The inclusion of metals is with the objective to increase the luminescence efficiency, passivating the surface of the PS and also to increase the conductivity by filling the pores with materials with high conductivity. This work was performed to study the structural modification that takes place in the porous silicon layers (PSL) when they are obtained for electrodeposition using metal salt of Au in the electrolyte used to get it. The introduction of the Au nanoparticles and the formation of the PSL are performed in situ. The Structural and optical properties modified of the PSL are analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS), Photoluminescence (PL) and Raman scattering. These measurements show the incorporation of gold nanoparticles over the PS surface. The size of the nanoparticles is between 19 and 32nm. The PL intensity showed an increment with the incorporation of the gold nanoparticles. The shift Raman shows the reduction in size of the nanostructures presents in the PS structure.\n\nSTUDY OF Hf/HfN MULTILAYER COATINGS PRODUCED BY DC MAGNETRON SPUTTERING\n\nS.R. Vásquez García1, L.

The vacuum chamber was evacuated to a base pressure of 4 x 10-6 Torr, combining layers of Hf and HfN and varying the number of these bilayers in 5, 10, 15 and 20. Hardness behavior and the microstructure of the coatings were investigated by Vickers microhardness, X ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM).\n\nXRD identifies the presence of two cubic crystalline phases of HfN according to the cards PDF-1 01-079-5779 and PDF-2 00-006-0516. The PDF-2 phase has the highest presence varying from a 95% to a 98% as the number of bilayers increased. By Rietveld, it was corroborated the major presence of the phase PDF-2 from 97 % to 99 % and with a variation in the grain size from 2.18 nm to 18.48 nm. The Vickers hardness test showed that the hardness values increases with more bilayers, moreover, all samples are sturdy with no fracture visible until 10 grf for the 5 bilayers samples; however, no fractures are visible at all for the 15 and 20 bilayers samples, showed better fracture toughness. Finally, the thickness of the coatings was measured by FE-SEM, where the thickness increased as the number of bilayers also increased, reaching the value of 1.326 µm. In the morphology, we can observe the formation of small clusters which increase in size as the number of bilayers increases from 0.1 µm to almost 1 µm in the sample with 20 bilayers, additionally, it is possible to distinguish the formation of two different clusters which might be related to different phases, further studies could reveal the formation of Hf clusters instead of HfN as the full width at half maximum increased in the XRD patterns and the Hardness increase.\n\nTHERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF NANOPARTICLES RHODIUM (n=55 & n=1415)\n\nChristopher Steve Escobedo-Egremy1, Juan Andrés Reyes-Nava1.\n\n1Centro de Investigación y Desarrollo Tecnológico en Energías Renovables, Instituto de Ciencias Básicas y Aplicadas, UNICACH, Lib.

Lajas Maciel, Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas, C.P. 29039, México.\n\nRhodium Nanoparticles are used as catalysts in advanced processes of oxidation and reduction, hydrogenation reactions and reagent in the catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons. Their catalytic performance is strongly affected by its thermal properties: thermal stability and melting temperature. The origin of this phenomenon is the fact that the catalytic activity of a nanoparticle is determined by their structure. In this research, thermodynamic properties of clusters assemblies of 55 and 1415 Rh atoms are studied. Clusters with maximum energy states of cohesion, obtained by performing slow quenching with computer simulation to model semi-empirical Gupta potential by Molecular Dynamics (MD) are used. Dynamic properties of the clusters, which are approximations of the thermodynamic properties, such as heat curve and heat capacity are obtained. It carried out a sampling of clusters with lower total energy to the point of evaporation, previously found, along a path with an extension of time of one microsecond (temporary partition) obtaining representative samples of all possible microstates of the system are sampled; the total energy in each cluster is conserved. Are carried out 100 coolings (quenching) to 100 clusters sampled during extensive trajectory in free evolution. Are obtained type icosahedral structures for the first 10 coolings of clusters of 55 atoms. Subsequently performs a statistical analysis to obtain thermodynamic properties by histograms of potential energy for each clusters.\n\nSTUDY OF SILVER IONS EFFECT IN THE SILVER NANOPARTICLES PHOTOCONVERSION PROCESS: AN APPROACH TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM\n\nEdgar Ferreira1, Manuel Ceballos1, Israel López1, Alejandro Vázquez1\n\n1Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, UANL, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas Av. Universidad S/N, Cd. Universitaria, 66450, San Nicolás de los Garza, Nuevo León, México.\n\nNoble metal nanoparticles are of great interest because of their unique physical and chemical properties. The localized surface plasmon resonance exhibited by these particles allows their potential application as sensors, optoelectronic materials, catalysts and active substrates for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This resonance highly depends on the particle size and shape. Silver nanoparticles undergo morphological changes by different mechanisms that can be roughly divided in three: photoinduced, thermal and chemical mechanisms. However, since the first silver nanoparticles photoconversion process was reported in 2001 by Mirkin, a lot of related articles have been published, but only few of them are focused in the study of how the photoconversion works and which factors are the most important. In order to better understand the mechanism of silver nanoparticles photoconversion process, we report a study based on the effect of silver ions during this process. We found that silver ions are critical for the process and their concentration influence the speed of photoconversion.\n\nTEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT PHOTOLUMINESCENCE SPECTRA OF ZnO NANOCRYSTALS\n\nJ. L. Casas Espinola1 and X. A. Hernández Contreras2\n\n1ESFMInstituto Politécnico Nacional, México D. F. 07738, México. 2UPIITA  Instituto Politécnico Nacional, México D. F. 07320, México\n\nThe mechanism for low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) emissions in ZnO nanocrystals, grown by colloidal route, is studied in detail, using PL spectroscopy as a function of temperature and excitation intensity. In all samples, the PL peak energy as well as the full width at half maximum (FWHM), as a function of temperature, present anomalous behaviors. At sufficiently low excitation intensity and in a narrow temperature interval (50  80 K), the samples present two clear competitive PL peaks. The low-energy PL mechanism (8  80 K) is dominated by localized PL transitions, while the high-energy PL mechanism is dominated by the ground state PL transition. A modified method was applied to synthesize zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles by addition of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) to an ethanolic zinc acetate solution. This novel approach, employing ultrasound, allows one to produce relatively highly concentrated ZnO colloids. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows the formation of wurtzite structure. Optical properties of ZnO nanocrystals were measured with UV-VIS. The ZnO nanocrystals morphology has been characterized by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with the aim to control the QDs average size. This improved method for the preparation of colloidal ZnO solutions of different particle size is described, and we have obtained different particle sizes by aging. It was found that growing of particle was governed by temperature, the water content, and the presence of reaction products. In this work, depending on the temperature of storage, the ZnO particles grow around 15 days to a diameter of about 7 nm. Other groups add water to the ZnO solution to accelerate the particle growth. It is proven that water plays an important role in the formation of ZnO quantum dots. The advantage of letting the particles grows more slowly at low temperatures (0-10 ºC) and without the addition of extra water is twofold. ZnO quantum dots can be obtained with sizes in a range of 3-7 nm.\n\nTHEORETICAL STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF GAMMA RADIATION ON PENTAGONAL SILVER NANOWIRES\n\nM. E. Fernández-García1, D. Mendoza-Anaya1, C. Gutiérrez-Wing1\n\n1Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares. Carretera México-Toluca s/n, La Marquesa Ocoyoacac, México C.P.52750\n\nGamma radiation has been widely used in different fields in industry, medicine and investigation. It is known that this type of radiation can cause structural damage to materials, modifying their original properties. With the aim of understanding the consequences of the interaction of gamma radiation with silver nanowires, in this work, we have simulated the behavior of silver nanowires exposed to ionizing radiation at doses of 1, 10 and 20 kGy. The studies of the interaction of gamma radiation with the pentagonal silver nanowires were performed through the Monte Carlo method. Pentagonal silver nanowires of 199 atoms, were constructed and geometrically optimized. The geometric refinement of the atomic structure was performed through an iterative sequence by molecular mechanics to find the stable structures. The SMART algorithm was used to perform these calculations, which is a combination of steps descent methods, conjugate gradient and Newton-Raphson and a Universal potential. The beam direction of the gamma radiation was applied to planes (100) of the silver nanowires and at the intersection between them. After the radiation beam has interacted with the structure, it was observed that structural changes on the silver nanowire might occur and these are dependent of the crystallographic plane where the beam interacted and the dose. These changes correspond mainly to atoms migration from their initial positions, leaving vacancies. As the radiation dose increases, a greater amount of atoms migrate to the surface or is modified from their original positions.\n\nAcknowledgements.

Cuevas Arteaga1, Mejía Sintillo1, P. Mijaylova Nacheva2, R. Ma. Melgoza Alemán1\n\n1FCQeI-CIICAp-Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos, Av. Universidad 1001, Col. Chamilpa, C.P. 62210, Cuernavaca, Mor., México. 2Instituto Mexicano de Tecnología del Agua- Blvd. Paseo Cuauhnáhuac 8532, Col. Progreso, C.P. 62550 Jiutepec, Mor., México\n\nNanotubular structures were formed on titanium foils through electrochemical anodization using an aqueous electrolyte (50:50 Vol. %) H2O: glycerol + 2.7 M NH4F at constant voltage of 20V for 2.5 for unpolished foils and 3.5 h for polished foils at room temperature [1-2]. The anodized samples were analyzed in a Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) obtaining the geometric parameters of the nanotubular films. The roughness factors (RF) were calculated as 44 for the polished samples, and 54 for the unpolished samples. It was observed that metallographic pretreatment of Ti foils affected the morphological characterization. Crystalline phases of both TiO2 nanotubular films were obtained by XRD after annealing at 450 °C and 600 °C for 2 hours [3], obtaining the structural composition of mixed phases, resulting more intense peaks of anatase after annealing at 450°C and a main phase of rutile at 600°C [1-4].\n\nThe electrochemical stability of the TiO2 nanotubular films was made from the potentiodynamic polarization curves and the linear polarization resistance techniques, exposing the samples in 1M Na2SO4 + H2SO4 solution (pH = 3.2). For comparison, several samples were studied: two crystallized TiO2 nanofilms at 450°C and 600°C, the amorphous sample and pure titanium. It was concluded that the electrochemical stability of the crystallized nanotubular films is improved with increasing the annealing temperature, which was supposed to be associate to the composition of the crystalline phases, observing that the major presence of rutile improved the corrosion performance. FE-SEM analysis of the exposed samples showed non significant degradation of the nanotubular surfaces after exposing to the corrosion solution, especially that annealed at 600°C. The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution using an 8 W UV lamp at a λ= 365 nm, whose results were recorded at zero bias during 10 min under darkness and illumination intervals of 1 min each. In order to obtain the electrical resistance and the charge transfer rate of the system, the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy was applied. The obtained results were in agreement with the necessary features for being used in photocatalytic water remediation.\n\nCHARACTERIZATION OF ANTIOXIDANT PICKERING EMULSIONS OF FLAXEED IOL\n\nPorras-Godinez M1., San Martìn-Martinez E1., Pedroza-Islas R2., Franco-Rodriguez G.3\n\n1 Centro de Investigacion en Ciencia Aplicad y Tecnologia Avanzada (CICATA-IPN) Calzada Legaria No. 694, Miguel Hidalgo, Irrigación, 11500 Ciudad de México, D.F. 2 Universidad Iberomericana., Prolongación Paseo de la Reforma 880, Alvaro Obregon, Lomas de Sta Fé, 01219 Ciudad de México, D.F. 3.- Facultad de estudios Superiores Cuautitlan (UNAM) Ave. 1o de Mayo S/N, Santa Maria las Torres, 54740 Cuautitlán Izcalli, Méx.\n\nLipid oxidation of emulsion is a major concern for food manofactures and consumers because it leads to food deterorations. Fabrications of Pickering emulsions is a promising strategy to anhance the oxidatuve satbility of emulsified via the formation of particle-based interfacial features, solid particles tend to adsorb at the droplet surface and buid a physical barrier aginst pro-oxidants (i.e., transition metals). The Objetive of the present study was to develop a stable Pickering flaseed oil emulsionfor food fortification. The Pickiring emulsions were studied for its physical stability, oxidative stability (peroxide value), particle size and zeta potential.\n\nNANOSTRUCTURED POLYANILINE FILM ON POLYESTER SUBSTRATES AS A PROMISING DEVICE FOR DETECTING INFECTIOUS DISEASES\n\nGraciela da Costa Pedro1, Filipe Dione Souza Gorza1, Romário Justino da Silva1, Alicia Elizabeth Chávez Guajardo2, Juan Carlos Medina Llamas2, José Jarib Alcaraz Espinoza2, Celso Pinto de Melo2\n\n1Pós-Graduação em Ciência de Materiais, 2Departamento de Física, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, 50670-901 Recife, PE Brazil.\n\nFlexible and electrically films of intrinsically conductive polymers can serve as promising platforms for the development of novel multifunctional materials. In this sense, they could contribute to the progressive miniaturization of electronic or optical devices used to detect environmental pollutants or valuable biomacromolecules (nucleic acids, antibodies, etc.). In this work, we have prepared nanostructured films of polyaniline (PANI) on polyester foils (FILIPERSON) and evaluated their physical-chemical properties and morphological features through UV-Vis spectroscopy, contact angle measurements and scanning electron microscopy. The resulting films exhibited both a uniform deposition of the PANI nanostructured particles that were formed during the synthesis (which occurred under low temperature and dilute concentrations conditions) and wettability properties that could be adjusted through controlled changes of pH. Our strategy to develop a PANI-based platform for detecting infectious diseases consisted in first immobilizing a DNA probe atop of it and then depositing the sample containing the target DNA sequence to be hybridized. To check how efficient would be this methodology, we employed a commercial DNA dye (Sybr Green, ThermoFisher) which exhibits an enhanced fluorescence when in presence of double stranded DNA chains. In this manner, we were able to optimize the procedure and then confirm the occurrence of an effective DNA probe immobilization through UV-Vis spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Our preliminary results indicate that this promising platform could be employed for the design of novel devices for the rapid diagnosis of diseases such as ZIKA and leishmaniasis, among others.\n\nSYNTHESIS AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERIZATION OF NOVEL SUPERHYDROPHOBIC COATING: DROPMA® AS A PROTECTIVE COATING FOR PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS\n\nR.G.

Almendros, Ciudad Caucel, Mérida, Yucatán, México.\n\nThe protection of printed circuit boards against moisture and water is an issue of importance for the development of instrumentation devices. In most cases, these instruments will be in contact with water, specially for chemical and food industry or environmental applications. The moisture absorbed by printed board circuits can result in damage at temperature of operation, internal delamination, excessive strain on plated-hole walls, among others. Also, the exposure of circuit board to corrosion will cause the release of pollutants to the environment, mainly of heavy metals. In this research, we developed a novel superhydrophobic coating based on nanoparticles of silicium, zinc and carbon that exhibit good mechanical resistance to abrasion and stability to temperatures over 300°C. By using a simple spraying application method on different samples of printed circuit board (PCBs), the life of operating electronic circuits was extended by equivalent periods of 10 years over acid conditions without interfering with the correct function of the circuit. The one-step synthesis of this novel material allows the production of an accessible and well functional material for validated industrial applications on PCBs.\n\nADSORPTION AND DISSOCIATION OF MOLECULAR OXYGEN ON GRAPHENE DOPED WITH TRANSITION METALS: A DEFT STUDY\n\nVíctor Aramburu1, María Beatriz López1, Héctor Fasoli1\n\n1Centro de Investigaciones Fisicoquímicas, Teóricas y Aplicadas, Universidad Nacional de Catamarca, Av. Belgrano 300, 4700, Catamarca, Argentina\n\nThe growth of economies has spurred an increase in energy demands and thus great interests in enhancing the electrochemical performance of various renewable energy applications such as fuel cells. Intensive research efforts have been undertaken in developing new catalysts to enhance the kinetics of oxidation and reduction reactions of compounds of interest.\n\nFor this purpose metal-doped graphene hybrid materials have been explored, but with too much focus on noble metals, which are limited by their low availability and high costs, so transitio metals may serve as promising alternatives [1,2].\n\nIn this work we presents a study based on the Density Functional Theory as Gaussian09 program code, a sheet of graphene doped with 3d, 4d and 5d group transition metals. The hybrid PBE1PBE functional method was used and the effective-core-potential LANL2DZ for metal atoms and the 6-31G ++ (d) basis for the carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n\nOur results indicate that the oxygen dissociation barrier decreases in doped systems regarding pure graphene sheet. This improved catalytic activity is allocated to the electronic and structural properties that promotes doped with transition metals to a graphene sheet. From this result it can be considered doped graphene as a promising catalyst to the oxygen reduction reaction.\n\nGAS-PHASE NONCOVALENT FUNCTIONALIZATION OF CARBON NANOTUBES WITH PHTHALOCYANINES\n\nLaura Flores-Sánchez1, Elena V.

Besides, it does not require subsequent purification steps, whereby it can be considered as a green functionalization technique. The materials resulting from the noncovalent functionalization of CNTs with phthalocyanine molecules are nanohybrids that combine the optical, catalytical and electronic properties of Pcs with the thermal, electronic and mechanical properties of CNTs. CNTS-Pcs compounds have applications as catalysts, gas sensors, electrodes, and in light storage and harvest devices. In the present work, the gas-phase functionalization method was adapted to prepare CNTs-Pc systems, in particular CNTs-CuPc and CNTs-H2Pc. The nanohybrids obtained were characterized by Raman and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. Changes in CNTs surface and Pcs structure after the functionalization were observed by TEM, UV-Vis and FTIR. Evidence of the noncovalent interaction between CNTs and Pcs was found by Raman spectroscopy. Financial support from UNAM (grants DGAPA-IN 200516) is greatly appreciated.\n\nTHERMOMECHANICAL PROCESSING FOR MODIFYING STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF SEVERELY DEFORMED MEDIUM CARBON STEEL\n\nLibor Kraus1, Jozef Zrnik1,\n\nCOMTES FHT Inc., Dobrany, Czech Republic\n\nThe present work deals with grain refinement of medium carbon steel AISI 1045 having different microstructure resulting from thermal and/or thermomechanical (TM) treatment, applied prior severe plastic deformation (SPD). In case of TM treated steel, structure refinement was conducted in two steps. Preliminary steel structure refinement has been achieved due to multistep open die forging process which provided total strain of ɛef ~ 3. Uniform and fine recrystallized ferrite structure, with grain size of the order of 2-5 µm and with nest-like pearlite colonies was received. The further grain refinement of steel samples, having different initial structure was accomplished during warm Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at 400°C. The microstructure development was analyzed in dependence of effective strain introduced in range of ɛef ~ 2.5 - 4. Employment of proposed deformation conditions resulted in extensive deformation of ferrite grains, where mixture of subgrains and ultrafine grain structure was found, regardless the preliminary treatment of the steel. As straining increased the dynamic polygonization and recrystallization process became active to form mixture of polygonized subgrains and sub-microcrystalline grains having high angle boundaries. The intensive straining and moderate ECAP temperature caused the partial cementite lamellae fragmentation and spheroidization as straining increased. The lamellae cementite spheroidization was more extensive in prior TM treated steel samples. The deformation behaviour of both steel structural states confirmed the strength increase. However the work hardening behaviour of steel was modified with respect to initial structure condition of the steel prior SPD deformation.\n\nMESOPOROUS CARBON XEROGELS PRODUCED BY HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS FOR THE NANO-CONFINEMENT OF MAGNESIUM\n\nE.

Applications of mesoporous carbon xerogels include supporting materials for catalysts, electrode materials for capacitors, column chromatography packing, adsorbents, thermal insulators, confinement of metal nanoparticles, and so on. Our interest is precisely to build a mesoporous structure for the nano-confinement of magnesium nanoparticles.\n\nThe primary objective of this work is to hydrothermally synthesize high-quality hydrogels that can undergo hot-air drying to yield mesoporous carbon xerogels. More specifically, hydrogel synthesis was carried out in an autoclave, under a pressure of about 0.63 MPa and a temperature of 180 ºC. The hydrothermal process temperature and initial pH of the solution were varied in search of a suitable condition that minimizes structural collapse during subsequent hot-air drying.\n\nThe hydrogels were synthesized by polycondensation of 2,4 dihydroxybenzoic acid with formaldehyde. Ammonium hydroxide was used as basic catalyst and distilled water as solvent. The sol-gel polycondensation took place in a 35 mL-Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The xerogel obtained was characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS, BET, IR and TGA.\n\nThe hydrothermal process was on the overall relatively simple, low-cost, and less time-consuming compared to the conventional atmospheric method.\n\nSYNTHESIS OF HYBRID MATERIALS OF MWCNT / POLYTHIOPHENE / METALLIC PARTICLES FOR ELECTROGENERATION OF H2O2 EMPLOYED FOR THE PHOTODEGRADATION OF ORGANIC POLLUTANTS\n\nA.

One of the most interesting nanomaterials are carbon nanotubes (CNTs), these are composed of one or more sheets of graphene rolled up on themselves and have very interesting electrical properties. On the other hand, electrically conducting polymers such as polythiophene (PTh) have received considerable attention because of their electronic, magnetic and optical properties.\n\nGeneral methods for the preparation of CNTs/PTh composites often require the use of organic solvents and high temperatures; similarly with the synthesis of metallic NPs on carbon nanotubes require a reducing agent (such as sodium citrate, ascorbic acid, sodium borohydride, etc.) for the metallic precursors and suitable surface capping ligands to control the dimension and shape of particles.\n\nIn this work we report a simple, one-step procedure to synthesize CNTs decorated with both metal nanoparticles and conducting polymer, from the reaction between metallic salt and thiophene, as the sole reducing agent, in water at room temperature. In this case, Na2PdCl4 and HAuCl4 were used for the synthesis of metal particles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs/PTh/Pd and CNTs/PTh/Au). Furthermore, these nanocomposites were used as electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for the electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, where the number of electrons transferred was 2 and up to 100 % of H2O2 was obtained. We also demonstrate that the use of NTC/PTh/Au is a good electrocatalyst for in situ electrogeneration of H2O2 and it was apply in the photodegradation of organic contaminants.\n\n00:15 - 00:30\n\nSB.5-P001\n\nLuis Martín Mejía Mendoza\n\nATOMISTIC MODELING OF AMORPHOUS NANOPOROUS CARBON FOR ELECTRODE APPLICATION\n\n00:30 - 00:45\n\nSB.5-P002\n\nNelly Rayon Lopez\n\nIMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF ACTIVATED CARBON ELECTRODES FOR SUPERCAPACITORS THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF WO OBTAINED WITH SOLAR ENERGY\n\n00:45 - 01:00\n\nSB.5-P003\n\nElvia Teran\n\nELECTROCHEMICAL EXFOLIATION OF GRAPHITE IN ACID AQUEOUS SOLUTION FOR ENERGY STORAGE\n\n01:00 - 01:15\n\nSB.5-P004\n\nYasuhiro Matsumoto Matsumoto\n\nREDUCTION OF GRAPHENE OXIDE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE WITH CITRIC ACID\n\n01:15 - 01:30\n\nSB.5-P006\n\nCinthia Janet Mena-Durán\n\nBIO-BASED MATERIALS FOR POTENTIAL APPLICATION AS CATALYST SUPPORT IN FUEL CELLS\n\n01:30 - 01:45\n\nSB.5-P007\n\nAlan Joel Miralrio Pineda\n\nSTUDY OF PROPERTIES AND STABILITIES OF SMALL ENDOHEDRAL FULLERENES X@C36 (X= Sc, Y AND La)\n\n01:45 - 02:00\n\nSB.5-P008\n\nLuis Ivan Serrano Corrales\n\nCHEMICAL ABSORBED OF NANOPARTICLES OF TiO ONTO THE EXTERNAL WALL OF MULTIWALL CARBON NANOTUBES VIA MECHANICAL MILLING\n\n02:00 - 02:15\n\nSB.5-P009\n\nJesús Ramiro Aragon Guajardo\n\nSYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZACION OF GRAPHENE AND GHAPHENE OXIDE FOR HYDROGEN CUMBUSTION CELLS APPLICATIONS\n\n02:15 - 02:30\n\nSB.5-P010\n\nAbigail Parra Parra\n\nPREPARATION AND PROPERTIES OF AMORPHOUS CARBON FROM THE WASTE OF ACTIVATED SLUDGE\n\n02:30 - 02:45\n\nSB.5-P011\n\nSaúl Hazel Martínez Treviño\n\nDISPERSION AND SOLVENT EFFECTS IN THE STRUCTURE AND STABILITY OF A CYCLOPENTADIENYL IRON/RUTHENIUM COMPLEX OF SUMANENE\n\n02:45 - 03:00\n\nSB.5-P012\n\nPatrick G.

This knowledge is fundamental to overcome technical difficulties that arise measuring the exact topology of this materials. Obtaining such carbon structures may be useful to understand electrochemical processes such as intercalation and electric double layer formation, and can assist the development of more efficient kind of organic devices. Using molecular dynamics simulations with the Tersoff potential implemented in LAMMPS software, we generated more than 1200 nanopurous structures with densities ranging between the critical and the triple point densities of carbon. The sampling procedure consists in simulate heating ramps in the supercells, from the coexistence phase to a point close to the liquid transition. Then, select intermediate structures to apply a sudden quenching to room temperature, at this temperature an equilibration was performed for several simulation time. The result may be presented in a three-dimensional phase space with surface area, volume fraction and density as variables. In this space, at least, three different phases arise: a graphite like phase where graphene sheets bending outward and intercalate, a nano-foam phase where no graphite like structure is visible and a sponge-like phase rich in extit{sp} carbon bonding state. This data may be useful for multiscale simulations of porous carbons in order to contribute to the research and development of more efficient carbon electrodes.\n\nIMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF ACTIVATED CARBON ELECTRODES FOR SUPERCAPACITORS THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF WO3-X OBTAINED WITH SOLAR ENERGY\n\nNelly Rayón-Lópeza,b, Ana Karina Cuentas-Gallegosb, Heidi Isabel Villafán-Vidalesb, Jose Luis Rodriguez-López,c, Elsa Carmina Menchaca-Camposa, Jorge Uruchurtu-Chavarína.\n\na Centro de Investigación en Ingeniería y Ciencias Aplicadas (CIICAp), Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Morelos, Cuernavaca, Morelos 62210, Mexico.b Instituto de Energías Renovables, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Priv.

Activated carbons have been extensively studied as electrodes in SC, where their surface chemistry, porosity properties, and high surface area have been the key properties for capacitance improvement. Nevertheless, these properties show limitations since they cannot be highly increase without losing electric conductivity, which is detrimental for power requirements. An alternative approach to increase performance has been through surface modifications of carbon materials by introducing faradaic contributions (P or R). In this work, the effect of WO3-x particles obtained with solar energy to elaborate composite electrodes (DLC- WO3-x) with a commercial Activated Carbon were studied to improve their energy storage performance in Supercapacitors cells. All WO3-x synthesized in a solar furnace using temperatures between 600°C and 1000°C with different oxygen content, were previously characterized by different techniques before fabrication of composite electrodes. HR-SEM images revealed a wide distribution of particle size and by EDS we confirmed only the presence of W and O. XRD patterns showed the presence of two phases for all oxides, monoclinic and triclinic. Different colorations were observed for the WO3-x synthesized with different temperatures independently from the oxygen content, giving a yellow powder for WO3-x obtained at 600°C and 800°C, and a greenish color at 1000°C. This coloration difference is related with the oxidation state of tungsten, which was confirmed by XPS. Electrochemical characterization by cyclic voltammetry showed a pseudocapacitive behavior for these oxides, revealing an improved performance for the oxide obtained at 1000°C with 100% of oxygen (WO-1000). Composite electrodes were elaborated with different content of the best oxide (50%, 18%, 12%, 6%, 3%, and 1.5%) giving the best energy storage performance with 1.5% of the oxide. This composite electrode (DLC-1.5% WO3-x ) showed a larger capacitance and rate capability, which makes this type of material a good candidate for supercapacitor cells.\n\nELECTROCHEMICAL EXFOLIATION OF GRAPHITE IN ACID AQUEOUS SOLUTION FOR ENERGY STORAGE\n\nElvia Teran-Salgado1, Pedro A.

The electrochemical exfoliated graphene sheets obtained through this method have often shown high performance in electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors [2,3]. The mechanism of exfoliation involve the intercalation of the electrolyte ions and chemical oxidation of the graphite, and gas induced mechanical exfoliation [4]. The resulting material is a water dispersion that contains graphite particles, few-layer graphene sheets and graphene monolayers mixed in different proportions. In this work, we studied the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite under potentiostatic conditions in a two-electrode configuration. Different anionic electrolytes in aqueous media were examined, such as HCl, H2SO4 and H3PO4. The bias voltage was set to 7 V. The morphology of the exfoliated graphene sheets was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), whereas the chemical structure studied through Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The C 1s photoemission peaks from the XPS spectra were deconvoluted to calculate the contribution from the different functional groups. The components of the C1s were assigned to sp2 (284.2), C-OH (285.7), C-O-C (286.2), C=O (287.5), O-C=O (289.4) and π-π satellite (291.5). SEM images of the exfoliated material shows a large quantity of graphite particles that can be separated by centrifugation.\n\nREDUCTION OF GRAPHENE OXIDE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE WITH CITRIC ACID\n\nRebeca Ortega Amaya1, Yasuhiro Matsumoto1,2, Manuel Alejandro Pérez Guzmán2, Mauricio Ortega López1,2.\n\n1Sección de Electrónica del Estado Sólido, Departamento de Ingeniería Eléctrica. 2Programa de Nanociencias y Nanotecnología.

The common way for high scale production of graphene is the exfoliation of graphite oxide to produce graphene oxide (GO)2, a reduction process is needed to obtain graphene3. The methods to reduce GO include thermal and chemical processes4. For chemical reduction, a toxic reactive is frequently used as hydrazine, sodium borohydride and potassium hydroxide5. Since it is desirable to use green reducing reagents, there are a huge variety of reports about the GO reduction using vitamin C, ascorbic acid, alcohols, green tea, etc6. Citric acid (CA), is an environment friendly material, employed as a reducing agent and has also been used as a surfactant.\n\nThis work describes a simple and green method to prepare reduced graphene oxide sheets by a single step using citric acid as a reductant in an aqueous solution at room temperature. It was demonstrated that citric acid has a capability for graphene oxide reduction, comparable with other green reductants such as Vitamin C, L-Ascorbic acid (L-AA). Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis revealed that the GO reduction level, depend on the process time. X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy testify the effective GO reduction.\n\nBIO-BASED MATERIALS FOR POTENTIAL APPLICATION AS CATALYST SUPPORT IN FUEL CELLS\n\nCinthia J. Mena-Durán1, D.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of these materials as catalyst support in the search of sustainability during the development of fuel cells. The obtention combines the expansion of the starch-derived materials through gelatinization with the use of sonochemistry and solvent interchange.\n\nManihot esculenta and Ipomea batata were got from a local market, then were washed throughly for remotion of impurities. Samples were cut in small dices of 1 cm per edge and dried overnight at 80 °C. After drying, samples were grinded to obtain a fine powder. The gelatinization was carried out using 5.0 g of material per 100 mL of distilled water at 60°C for 1 h. Then, sample was put into a fridge at 5°C for 24 h to promote a retrogradation process. The solvent interchange, this was done using ethanol in a ratio of 1:10. After this process, samples were filtered off and dried at 80 °C before carbonization. Samples were treated at 450 °C under nitrogen flow for 1h. The elemental analysis shows a predominant composition of carbon with a C:O ratio approx. 6. The FTIR spectra show vibrational bands appearing at 1705 cm-1 and 1600 cm-1 were assigned to carbonyl C=O and alkene C=C stretching, respectively. According with the XPS analysis, the materials composition consists of carbon double bond carbon with a band centred at C 1s at 284.6 eV, there is a small band alocated at ca. 286.2 eV and 288.1 eV corresponding to C-O bonds and carboxyl O=C-O components. Pt-loading of 20 % on the carbonized materials was carried out through the colloidal suspension method, the electrochemical activity was measured by cyclic voltammetry.\n\nSTUDY OF PROPERTIES AND STABILITIES OF SMALL ENDOHEDRAL FULLERENES X@C36 (X= Sc, Y AND La)\n\nAlan Miralrio and L.E. Sansores1\n\n1Instituto de Investigaciones en Materiales, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. Mexico DF 04510, Mexico\n\nFullerenes that contain other species inside them are known as endohedral fullerenes. These compounds are of interest by their potential applications1, from molecular electronics to pharmacy 1. Recently mass spectrometry experiments have shown2,3 the presence of fullerenes doped with group-3 elements (Sc, Y and La). The smallest compounds obtained in these experiments are those formed with a fullerene C36 and an endohedral group-3 atom.\n\nWe studied their electronic properties, geometries and stabilities with the density functional theory, using the functional PBE with the dispersion correction D3(BJ) and the basis def2-TZVP for all atoms. We scanned the potential energy surfaces followed by full optimizations at the lowest energy minima.\n\nOur results show that the most suitable C36 isomer to host group-3 elements has D6h symmetry. The D6h isomer has an energy difference of 0.052eV respect to the D2d. In the compounds, only La is located at the fullerene´s center and the other two atoms are displaced in direction of a hexagonal ring. In addition, we calculated Hirshfeld charge distributions, ionization energies and electron affinities. Other properties are discussed.\n\nCHEMICAL ABSORBED OF NANOPARTICLES OF TiO2 ONTO THE EXTERNAL WALL OF MULTIWALL CARBON NANOTUBES VIA MECHANICAL MILLING\n\nSerrano Corrales L.

The MWCNT were previously subjected to a thermal treatment at a constant temperature with different times of exposure with the aim to increase the amount of active sites on the outer layer of MWCNT and get a better link with the TiO2 nanoparticles. X ray diffraction shows us the modification of the crystalline net as function of the milling time, as the same time Raman spectroscopy and UV Vis allow determine the interaction between the TiO2 nanoparticles and the MWCNT. A shift in the RBM has been observed, concomitant the UV-Vis band at 592 nm appears, and this latter is associated to the bond between the TiO2 nanoparticles and the external wall of the MWCNT.\n\nSYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZACION OF GRAPHENE AND GHAPHENE OXIDE FOR HYDROGEN CUMBUSTION CELLS APPLICATIONS\n\nAragón Guajardo J.
