        "text": "The environmental crisis facing the world today has been added to the current health crisis by COVID-19, constituting one of the main concerns of several international organizations. The \"green university\" initiative is inserted in this process, as it is the key entity in the development of the educational process, but with a vision of generating greater personal and collective responsibility regarding the proper use of resources, the implementation of good practices and the promotion of environmental awareness that can be replicated by students once they are trained as professionals and are inserted in the different areas of society, which is why it acquires a high prominence.\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\nLicensing Agreement\n\nThis journal provides free access to its content through its website following the principle that making research available free of charge to the public supports a larger exchange of global knowledge.\n\nWeb content of the journal is distributed under a Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\n\nAuthors may adopt other non-exclusive license agreements for the distribution of the version of the published work, provided that the initial publication in this journal is indicated.
