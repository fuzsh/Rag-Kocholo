        "text": "At Sant Bani School, one of our founding principles is to “understand and appreciate that every person is unique and, as such, that there is something to learn from everyone.” Seeing our students, teachers, and alumni demonstrate this principle on a daily basis is a constant affirmation of one of the many things that makes a Sant Bani School education unique. I invite you to browse the website to see how Sant Bani School can be the right fit for your family.\n\nAll my best,\n\nDan Love\n\nSant Bani School is an independent K-8 day school with an attached Pre-School in central New Hampshire. Our students gain self-confidence and a passion for learning through an integrated program of academics, creative arts, athletics, and service to others. Believing there is something to learn from everyone, we create a diverse community by interacting in mixed-age groups and practicing respect for self and others. These elements, combined with small classes and a connection to nature, produce a learning environment unique to SBS.\n\nOur campus is located less than five miles from Interstate 93 – Exit 22 and is within 30 minutes of Concord, Plymouth, New Hampton, Bristol, Andover, Tilton, Franklin, and Laconia. Surrounded by 200-acres of woods and fields, the School’s location allows for students to enjoy ample outdoor time each day.\n\nThe school is a member of AISNE (the Association of Independent Schools in New England) and is accredited with NEASC (the New England Association of Schools and Colleges). Sant Bani School is recognized by the IRS as a tax-exempt educational organization and is fully approved by the New Hampshire Department of Education.\n\nNondiscrimination Statement\n\nSant Bani School does not discriminate in any of its educational programs, activities or employment practices on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, sex, race, creed, religion, color, age, veteran or military status, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity or disability in compliance with the Provisions of Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1974 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973."
