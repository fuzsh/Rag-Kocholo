The Universidad TÃ©cnica Estatal de Quevedo in Ecuador was established in 1976 as an extension to the Luis Vargas Torres University. The extension was in response to the growing popularity in the faculty of agricultural sciences and this addition specialised in forestry and animal husbandry engineering.

The institution was awarded university status in 1984.

There are eight faculties at the university including engineering sciences, agriculture and forestry, educational sciences, industry and production, business sciences, economics and finances, health and livestock and biology.

The university also has a distance learning unit which enables students to study remotely.
