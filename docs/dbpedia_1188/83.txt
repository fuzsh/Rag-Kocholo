If you’re idea of dinner and a movie on Valentine’s Day looks more like a heart-shaped chicken nugget tray or home cooked meal prior to settling in for a movie on the couch than a night out at a restaurant and the movie theaters, then you’ve come to the right place. Whether you’re celebrating the day of love with your Galentine’s, significant other or solo this year, watching a good romantic movie is the perfect activity.

Honestly, the whole month of February should be one long Valentine’s movie marathon, and we’ve rounded up plenty of movies that fill the bill. The best part is: with nearly every movie under the sun available on streaming now, all of these Valentine's-themed flicks can be streamed right from home. If you're totally on the love train this February you'll love movies like The Notebook or Cray Rich Asians. However, if you have a more cynical outlook on the holiday this year, there are still plenty of picks for you like Brittany Runs a Marathon or The Break-Up.

When it comes to movies that scream Valentine's Day, there is no shortage. From classic romantic flicks like Bridget Jones's Diary or The Bridges of Madison County to new romantic comedies like Your Place or Mine and To All The Boys I've Loved Before, there are so many gems to choose from. We've taken the liberty of compiling 60 of the very best movies for Valentine's Day viewing (or really anytime you're in the mood to watch a romantic film). One thing is true about all of these, though: You’ll definitely be feeling the love after the credits roll.
