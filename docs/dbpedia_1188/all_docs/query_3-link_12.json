        "text": "Before you start diving into Jamie's incredible In Cold Blood study guide, I'd highly recommend that you check out LSG's free Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nIntroduction and Narrationâ\n\nâ¢ Although its structure and cinematic plot development resemble that of crime fiction, Truman Capoteâs In Cold Blood is a ânonfiction novelâ detailing the 1959 murders of four members of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas. Put simply, the book was conceived of journalism and born of a novelist.Â\n\nâ¢ The novel is a product of years of extensive research by Capote and his friend and fellow author Harper Lee, who followed the trails of the Kansas criminals across numerous US states. In Cold Blood revolutionised the American ideals of journalism and literature, blurring the lines between these labels.\n\nâ¢ A notable technique Capote employed in order to access classified information was becoming personally acquainted with the criminals of the case. For example, Capote became extremely close to Perry Smith, one of the main murderers in the case, which gave him exclusive information on the personal motives of the killers.Â\n\nâ¢ In Cold Blood reflects this relationship with the murderer through Capoteâs narration of the book as an objective bystander. On page 23, we see the almost endearing way that Capote describes Perry; âhis voice was both gentle and primâ a voice that, though soft, manufactured each word exactly, ejected it like a smoke ring issuing from a parsonâs mouth.â As such, Capoteâs friendship with Perry allows him to present the killer to the audience with a certain humanity and empathy, showcasing a broader picture of criminals than just a merciless murderer.\n\nTrue facts of the Case\n\nâ¢ On the 15th of November, 1959, all four members of the small farming Clutter family were brutally murdered, including Herbert Clutter, his wife Bonnie Clutter and their two teenage children, Nancy and Kenyon.\n\nâ¢ The family was discovered bound and shot in the head. Herbâs throat had also been slashed. After ransacking the entire house, the criminals had left without finding any cash, carrying with them no more than fifty dollars, a pair of binoculars and a transistor radio.\n\nâ¢ Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene âDickâ Hickock were convicted of the crime. The two men had become acquainted during serving time at the Kansas State Penitentiary, and soon confessed to the crime, claiming that that they had heard from another prisoner that Herb Clutter was extremely wealthy, and kept his money in an easy-to-reach safe in his house.\n\nâ¢ After the confession, the two murderers were flown from Nevada to Garden City, where they stood trial for their crimes. On 29 March, 1960, they received a guilty verdict, and were sentenced to the death penalty. For the following five years, Smith and Hickock lived on death row in Leavenworth, Kansas and were executed by hanging on the 14th of April, 1965.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nPerry Edward Smith\n\nOne of the two murderers of the Clutter case, Smith is portrayed as a sensitive and artistic man haunted by his turbulent and lonely childhood. Described by Capote as a man of âactorishâ good looks, he disfigured both of his legs due to a motorcycle accident, which gave him chronic pain and an addiction to aspirin. His criminal actions are often directly linked to his childhood, described as âno bed of roses but pitiful, an ugly and lonely progress toward one mirage and then anotherâ. Smithâs father was extremely abusive towards his wife, Flo Buckskin, and his four children, and so Buckskin later divorced him, taking the children with her. However, on her own she became an alcoholic and died by choking on her own vomit when Smith was only thirteen years old. He was then transferred to a Catholic orphanage, where he suffered from psychological, sexual and physical abuse from the nuns, one of whom attempted to drown him. Smithâs father and two of his siblings committed suicide during his time on death row. Smith eventually befriended Capote through their extensive interviews, and is believed to have shared personal information with him, believing him to be a true friend.\n\nRichard Eugene âDickâ Hickock\n\nThe second murderer of the Clutter case. Having grown up in Kansas, Hickock was a popular football player before turning to a life of crime after realising that he could not afford to go to college. During the course of the Clutter murder investigations, Hickock persistently blamed all of the murders on his partner in crime, Smith, claiming that âPerry Smith killed the Cluttersâ¦. It was Perry. I couldnât stop him. He killed them all.â Capote later states that during the murder, Smith was the one who stopped Hickock from raping the 16-year-old Nancy Clutter, as Hickock harboured pedophilic tendencies.\n\nHerbert Clutter\n\nA well-liked and kind-hearted wheat farmer in Holcomb, Kansas. Proprietor of the large River Valley Farm, Herb is described as a hardworking and valued citizen before his murder, who lead a relatively quiet life other than a troubled marriage with his wife due to her chronic depression.\n\nBonnie Clutter\n\nDescribed as an âanxious womanâ, it is revealed that Bonnie has a history of numerous mental illnesses, one of which is postpartum depression. Capote states that she and Herb had not slept in the same bed for many years.\n\nNancy Clutter\n\nDescribed as the âdarling of the townâ - the class president and future prom queen Nancy was the 16 year old daughter of the Clutters.\n\nKenyon Clutter\n\nAthletic but introverted, Kenyon was the 15 year old son of Herbert and Bonnie Clutter.\n\nAlvin Dewey\n\nA personal friend of the Clutters, Dewey was the primary investigator in the Clutter murder case and worked for the Kansas Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThemes and Motifs\n\nThe American Dream\n\nThe novel is Capoteâs reflection upon the American Dream, as he portrays both the lives of those who epitomise it and those who are tragically out of its reach. Herb Clutterâs position as an upstanding American citizen with a prosperous farm elicits the readerâs interpretation of his character as the rags-to-riches ideal. In stark contrast with this, the rootless and criminal Dick Hancock and Perry Smith are presented as individuals for whom the Dream is perpetually unattainable. Their attempt to finally become ârichâ materialises through their attempt to rob the Cluttersâ home, the failure of which ironically results in their brutal murders of the people who successfully represented the American Dream.\n\nNormality\n\nIn accordance with the American Dream, In Cold Blood also explores the concept of what is considered ânormalâ in America, and what can be revealed as the darker underbelly of its white picket fence ideal. Dick asserts throughout the novel that he is ânormalâ, but from an external, objective perspective, he is clearly far from such; he has distorted physical features and has committed a terrible, vicious murder. Capote also explores the idea of normal mental health, as Bonnie Clutter seems to have the perfect marriage and life with Herb, and yet suffers from extreme bouts of ânervousnessâ and chronic depression which result in her hospitalisation.\n\nEvil\n\nWhat is evil is primarily explored through the character of Perry, who has conflicting ideals about what can be considered truly âevilâ. The more feminine and gentler of the two murderers, Perry possesses conflicting morals, as despite being a ruthless murderer, he does feel remorse and is affected by what he has done. He even thinks to himself that Herb Clutter is a âvery nice gentlemanâ even in the midst of slitting his throat. Capote in the novel reveals that there are numerous facets to the meaning of true âevilâ, and the blurred borders that exist between each of these.\n\nMasculinity\n\nSymbolising the idea of dominance and power, Dick and Perry, who have a complementary and polarised gender relationship, feed off each other in order to boost their own masculinity. Described as âaggressively heterosexualâ, Dick is evidently the more stereotypically masculine counterpart, having had numerous relations with women. Perry, on the other hand, is more feminine and submissive, as Dick often calls him names such as âsugarâ and âhoneyâ. Both men in the novel utilise the other in order to make themselves feel more masculine in their highly restrictive and conservative society â while Dick emphasises Perryâs feminine qualities, Perry admires Dick and craves his words of affirmation that he, too, is masculine.\n\nEssay Writing for In Cold Blood\n\nBelow are some possible prompts for In Cold Blood, and possible ideas to begin writing an essay.\n\nTheme-based Essay Prompt\n\n\"I think it is a hell of a thing that a life has to be taken in this manner. I say this especially because there's a great deal I could have offered society. I certainly think capital punishment is legally and morally wrong.â\n\nIs In Cold Blood merely a novelistic argument against the death penalty? Discuss.\n\nTo learn more about LSGâs Five Types of essay prompts, Iâd highly recommend checking out this blog post. Itâs a super unique strategy developed by the founder of LSG, Lisa Tran. The Five Types method, outlined in the top-rated How To Write A Killer Text Response eBook, takes the stress of students and gives them easy to follow rules and tips so that they know how to approach every essay topic, every time.\n\nâ¢ The best way to approach any essay prompt is to recognise the limiting and/or important words of the essay question. In this thematic prompt these words are: âlegally and morallyâ, and âmerelyâ.\n\nâ¢ Secondly, for prompts which incorporate a quote, it is helpful to understand the context of the quote. In this case, the quote was said by Perry as his last words before his execution by hanging. Consider the importance of this; these words are especially more meaningful as they symbolise the last direct influence he leaves upon society. They are remorseful words of a murderer reproaching the justice system, which begs the question - does Capote position the reader to agree with the murdererâs view?\n\nâ¢ Planning this essay can be structured along three arguments...\n\n1. Capote argues against capital punishment through eliciting pathos for the murderers and portraying them as more than mere monsters.\n\nâ¢ Evidence for this argument could be based mostly on the descriptive elements of Capoteâs writing, or his emotional attachment to the murderers, particularly Perry.\n\nâ¢ Capote paints Perry particularly sympathetically, highlighting his sensitivity as well as his broken and abusive childhood. Quotations from the novel make it clear that his character is romanticised to an extent, such as âIt was a changeling's face, and mirror-guided experiments had taught him how to ring the changes, how to look now ominous, now impish, now soulful; a tilt of the head, a twist of the lips, and the corrupt gypsy became the gentle romantic.â\n\n2. In Cold Blood supports the anti-death penalty argument through its structure and organisation.\n\nâ¢ The epigraph of the novel is a verse of the poem, âBallade des pendusâ by Francois Villon, that he composed whilst on death row in 1463. Villonâs criminal circumstances were strikingly similar with Dick and Perryâs, as he murdered a priest and stole from his strongbox before being arrested and sentenced to death. Despite this, Villon was ultimately charged with a 10 year banishment from Paris, whereas the Clutter family murderers are hanged - a strikingly different outcome. Thus, Capote employs this poetic epigraph to strengthen his argument against the unjust executions of Perry and Dick.\n\nâ¢ In addition to this, the structure of the novel is also used to argue against capital punishment. Although Part One focuses on the lives of both the Clutter family members and Dick and Perry preceding the murder, Part Two skips over the actual murders themselves and recounts the aftermath of its events. This allows Capote to further develop Dick and Perry into real, complex people rather than merely cold blooded murderers; people who do not deserve such a cruel fate. Â\n\n3. However, Capote does ostensibly condemn the cruelty of the murders and presents the opposing argument that capital punishment is not, in fact, âlegally and morally wrongâ.\n\nâ¢ The brutality of the Clutter murders are emphasised through the novel, as Larry Hendricks, who discovers the bodies along with the police, provides the gruesome details of the bodies - âeach tied up and shot in the head, one with a slit throatâ.\n\nâ¢ As Perry later admits to the murder in his extended confession, Dewey highlights the fact that the Clutters âhad sufferedâ due to the âprolonged terror' inflicted by the murderers, and orders them, as such, to be âhanged back to backâ.\n\nâ¢ The argument for capital punishment in In Cold Blood is also supported by religious beliefs. As a small and predominantly Christian town, Kansas and its residents can be perceived interpreting the words of the Bible literally; at the end Dick and Perryâs trial, the prosecuting attorney Logan Green reads an excerpt from Genesis in the Holy Bible: âWhoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.â Rejecting the notion that Christianity preaches forgiveness, Green strives to punish the killers for failing to abide by the laws and prophecies of the Old Testament.\n\nCharacter essay prompt\n\nPerry Smith, despite Capoteâs authorial sympathy towards him, is really a cold and merciless monster. Discuss.\n\nWhen approaching character-based prompts, you must depart slightly from examining the holistic messages of the author, as you would in a theme-based prompt, but rather analyse how the specific character develops this authorial message. The above essay question could be brainstormed in the following way:\n\n1. Capoteâs description of Perry shows that he is far from a âmonsterâ, but a human being of great sensitivity and emotion.\n\nâ¢ During his confession of the Clutter murders, Perryâs comment, âThere's got to be something wrong with somebody who'd do a thing like that,â shows that he, to some extent, understands the gravity of his actions and regrets them.\n\nâ¢ Perry is also described by his sister as âgentleâ, and someone who âused to cry because he thought the sunset was so beautifulâ. Likewise, even in moments of cruelty, he often shows mercy and a wide moral compass, even stopping Dick from raping Nancy Clutter during their murder spree.\n\n2. Perry is also depicted as someone âweakenedâ by the tragic events of his past and his own insecurities, rather than an inherently âcold and mercilessâ person.\n\nâ¢ Capote often links Perryâs violent tendencies with his childhood, described as âno bed of roses but pitiful, an ugly and lonely progress toward one mirage and then anotherâ, as he was raised âwith no rule or discipline, or anyone to show [him] right from wrongâ.\n\nâ¢ In addition to this, Perry can be perceived to be the more insecure and submissive of the two killers, as while Dick often calls him stereotypically feminine names such as âsugarâ and honeyâ, Perry admires his âaggressiveâ masculinity and craves his words of affirmation in order to feel as masculine and strong as his counterpart.\n\n3. Despite this, Capote does not entirely erase the murderous aspects of Perryâs character.\n\nâ¢ Due to the prompt and seemingly nonchalant way in which he kills the clutters, Dick becomes convinced that Perry is that rarity of a person,\"a natural killer.â\n\nâ¢ Thus, Capote, despite his empathetic portrayal of Perry, never allows the reader to forget the Â extent of his criminality, and how easily he was able to fire those âfour shotgun blasts that, all told, ended six human lives.â\n\nFalse Claims of Colonial Thieves is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nWhy Is Context Important?\n\nWhen studying a text, it is very important to comprehend its context. Context will help you to understand what the text is about and what the authorâs point of view is - key components of doing well in VCE English! Context is especially important for False Claims of Colonial Thieves because the authors frequently reference Australiaâs history. Even the title is a nod to its context - it is all about the âfalse claimsâ made by Australiaâs âcolonial thievesâ, or in other words, Australiaâs colonial settlers. Understanding what these false claims are will help you better understand the context and therefore, do significantly better in your English essays and assessments.\n\nTreat this blog as a starting point only. There is so much to learn about these topics, and I recommend you do your own research in addition to reading this blog. To help you do so, I have provided a reliable external source for each topic, so you can start exploring these claims in more depth.\n\nTerra Nullius\n\nOne of the biggest âfalse claimsâ that Papertalk Green and Kinsella refer to throughout their collaboration is the colonisersâ claim of Australia being terra nullius. When the British came to Australia, they claimed that the country was âno manâs landâ, denying that the Indigenous Australians had actually lived here for thousands of years. By pretending that no one lived in Australia, this supposedly gave the British âlegitimacyâ to assume control over the land and those already living on it - i.e. Australiaâs First Nations Peoples.\n\nTerra Nullius was used against the Indigenous peoples for many years to justify their horrific treatment. The principle was only overturned in 1992 when an Indigenous man, Eddie Mabo, challenged this claim in the High Court of Australia. Nowadays, we recognise that the Indigenous people were here significantly earlier than the colonisers and that their sovereignty (i.e. their power over the land) was never ceded.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://australian.museum/learn/first-nations/unsettled/recognising-invasions/terra-nullius/Â\n\nThe Stolen Generation\n\nAnother false claim was that the Indigenous people were inferior to white people. This claim led to the forcible removal of Indigenous children from their families, so they could be raised by âsuperiorâ white people and taught white cultures/languages - these children are referred to as the âStolen Generationâ because they were taken away from their families without their consent.\n\nIt was thought that placing Aboriginal children (especially mixed-race Aboriginal children) with white families would make it easier to teach Aboriginal children the âproperâ (British) way of living. They were either placed in institutions or adopted by white families, and often faced terrible treatment, including violence, neglect and assault. Neither the children who were removed nor their families have fully recovered from this appalling policy that continued until the 1970s.\n\nIndeed, the effects of the Stolen Generation can still be felt today. One of the major consequences discussed by Papertalk Green and Kinsella is that a lot of Indigenous culture was lost. Many of the children who were taken away were forbidden from practising their cultural traditions or from speaking their Indigenous languages. This ban led to many traditions going extinct and is a tragic effect of this heinous false claim.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/stolen-generationsÂ\n\nMissions and ReservesÂ\n\nAnother claim explored in the text is the idea that Indigenous peoples could not look after themselves and would be better off with white people âprotectingâ them. This led to the government forcing Aboriginal people to leave their ancestral lands and relocate to newer, smaller areas - a process known as land alienation. There were two types of this land - missions and reserves - and Aboriginal people faced poor treatment on both.\n\nMissions were usually run by Christian groups so they could convert the Indigenous people to their religion. There was a strong degree of control exercised over these Indigenous people, who were expected to learn the skills required for menial jobs (such as cooking and cleaning). Contrastingly, those living on reserves were not typically subject to as much control. These people were sometimes provided with rations from the government, but there were not usually officials to oversee them.\n\nBoth missions and reserves are referred to in False Claims of Colonial Thieves, so it is important to understand the difference between the two.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/missions-stations-and-reservesÂ\n\nNow that weâve examined some of the more historical context, letâs take a closer look at the contemporary and modern background that Kinsella and Papertalk Green write about.\n\nClose the Gap Campaign and Black Deaths in Custody\n\nA key section of the text (particularly the latter third) explores current issues which Indigenous peoples face today. Two of these major concerns lie within the health and justice systems, so it is important to understand why Kinsella and Papertalk Green focus so heavily on these matters.\n\nThe Close the Gap Campaign (launched in 2007) aims to reduce the inequality in health and education that many Indigenous peoples face. It was created because the life expectancy is much lower for Indigenous than non-Indigenous peoples, and there is a significant difference between their expected levels of education. Unfortunately, many of these concerns have not been addressed today, and Papertalk Green discusses how her family is constantly dealing with death - a key theme in False Claims of Colonial Thieves that can be explained by this contextual understanding.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/reports/closing-the-gap-2018/executive-summary.htmlÂ\n\nSimilarly, there are a lot of concerns with the number of Aboriginal people in prison, and how many of them die while in police custody. There was even a Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (i.e. a governmental inquiry) handed down in 1987, however, many of its recommendations have not been implemented to this day. This idea of unfair policing and laws that target Indigenous peoples is a key idea in the text, and Kinsella dedicates a poem to Ms Dhu, an Indigenous woman killed while in custody.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/09/the-facts-about-australias-rising-toll-of-indigenous-deaths-in-custodyÂ\n\nMining\n\nA key theme of False Claims of Colonial Thieves is mining, which refers to the practice of removing valuable materials from the Earth. Many of these resources are found on traditional Aboriginal lands, which are destroyed by the mining process. This is especially offensive to many Indigenous groups because many Indigenous cultures have a strong spiritual connection to their land (often known as Country). There is consequently a lot of tension between the Indigenous populations and governments, especially in Western Australia, where both of the authors live.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Former_Committees/uranium/report/d07Â\n\nHow Can You Use This in Your Essays?\n\nUnderstanding a textâs context is very important in being able to analyse the text in appropriate depth.\n\nFor example, knowing that mining is often considered harmful to the lands to which Indigenous peoples have a strong connection, will allow you to discuss this concept in your essays. Indeed, Papertalk Green argues that mining is just as harmful to Indigenous peoples as earlier âfalse claimsâ were, which is a sophisticated idea for you to use in your assessments.\n\nAs you begin to better understand and incorporate context into your essays, you can then take things one step further by examining how the author has used context as a means of demonstrating their authorial intent. For example, the effects of the Stolen Generation have been explored in several poems, and a possible viewpoint is that the Stolen Generation was used to demonstrate the devastating loss of Indigenous cultures and traditions.\n\nFinding out that your school has selected to study a Shakespeare play as your section A text can be a pretty daunting prospect. If Iâm honest, I wasnât all too thrilled upon discovering this either...it seemed as though I now not only had to worry about analysing my text, but also understanding what Shakespeare was saying through all of his old-fashioned words.Â\n\nHowever, letâs not fret - in this post, Iâll share with you some Measure for Measure specific advice and tactics, alongside excerpts of an essay of mine as a reference.Â\n\nBefore you start reading, How To Approach Shakespeare: A Guide To Studying Shakespeare is a must read for any student studying Shakespeare.\n\nHistorical ContextÂ\n\nHaving a basic understanding of the historical context of the play is an integral part of developing your understanding of Measure for Measure (and is explored further in Measure for Measure by William Shakespeare). For example, for prompts that open with âWhat does Shakespeare suggest aboutâ¦?â or âHow does Measure for Measure reflect Shakespeareâs ideas aboutâ¦?â it can be really helpful to understand Shakespeareâs own position in society and how that influenced his writing.Â\n\nThereâs no need to memorise certain parts of Shakespeareâs history - as that would serve no purpose - just try to gauge an understanding of what life was like in his time. Through understanding Shakespeareâs position in society, we are able to infer his stances on various characters/ideologies in the play.Â\n\nMeasure for Measure is often regarded as an anti-Puritan satire. Although Shakespeareâs religion has been a subject of much debate and research, with many theories about his faith being brought forward, many believe that he was a secret Catholic. He is believed to be a âsecretâ Catholic, as he lived during the rise of the Puritans - those who wished to reform the Church of England and create more of a focus on Protestant teachings, as opposed to Catholic teachings. It was often difficult for Catholics to practice their faith at this time.Â\n\nAngelo and Isabella - particularly Angelo, are believed to embody puritanism, as shown through their excessive piety. By revealing Angelo to be âyet a devil,â though âangel on the outward side,â Shakespeare critiques Puritans, perhaps branding them as hypocritical or even unhuman; those ânot born of man and woman.â Thus, we can assume that Shakespeare would take a similar stance to most of us - that Angelo wasnât the greatest guy and that his excessive, unnatural and puritanical nature was more of a flaw than a virtue.Â\n\nTips for Moving Past the Generic Examples/Evidence Found in the PlayÂ\n\nItâs important to try and stand out with your examples in your body paragraphs. If youâre writing the same, simple ideas as everyone else, it will be hard for VCAA assessors to reward you for that. Your ideas are the most important part of your essay because they show how well youâve understood and analysed the text - which is what they are asking from you, itâs called an âanalytical interpretation of a text,â not âhow many big words can you write in this essay.â You can stand out in Measure for Measure by:Â\n\n1. Taking Note of Stage Directions and Structure of Speech\n\nMany students tend to simply focus on the dialogue in the play, but stage directions can tell you so much about what Shakespeare was really trying to illustrate in his characters.Â\n\nFor example, in his monologue, I would often reference how Angelo is alone on stage, appearing at his most uninhibited, with his self-interrogation revealing his internal struggle over his newfound lust for Isabella. I would also reference how Shakespeareâs choice of syntax and structure of speech reveal Angeloâs moral turmoil as he repetitively asks himself âwhatâs this?â indicating his confusion and disgust for his feelings which âunshapesâ him.Â\n\nIsabella is shown to â[kneel]â by Mariana at the conclusion of the play, in order to ask for Angeloâs forgiveness. This detail is one that is easily missed, but it is an important one, as it is an obvious reference to Christianity, and symbolises Isabellaâs return to her âgentle and fairâ and âsaintâ like nature.Â\n\n2. Drawing Connections Between Characters - Analyse Their Similarities and Differences.Â\n\nDrawing these connections can be a useful way to incorporate other characters not necessarily mentioned in your prompt. For example, in my own English exam last year, I chose the prompt â...Power corrupts both Angelo and the Duke. Do you agree?â and tried to pair Angelo and Isabella, in order to incorporate another character into my essay (so that my entire essay wasnât just about two characters).\n\nA favourite pair of mine to analyse together was Angelo and Isabella. Although at first glance they seem quite different, when you read into the text a little deeper you can find many similarities. For example, while Angelo lives alone in his garden, âsuccumbed by brick,â requiring âtwo keysâ to enter, ânun,â Isabella, wishes to join the nuns of Saint Clare where she âmust not speak with menâ or âshow [her] face.â Shakespeareâs depiction of the two, stresses their seclusion, piety and restriction from the âviceâ plaguing Vienna. Whatâs important about this point is that you can alter your wording of it to fit various points that you may make. For example, you could use this example to prove to your assessor how Isabellaâs alignment with Angelo signals Shakespeareâs condemnation of her excessive puritanical nature (as I did in my body paragraph below) or, you could use these same points to argue how Angelo was once indeed a virtuous man who was similar to the âsaintâ Isabella, and that it was the power that corrupted him (as you could argue in the 2019 prompt).Â\n\nAnother great pair is the Duke and Angelo. Although they certainly are different in many ways, an interesting argument that I used frequently, was that they both were selfish characters who abused their power as men and as leaders in a patriarchal society. It is obvious where Angelo did this - through his cruel bribery of Isabella to âlay down the treasures of [her] body,â however the Dukeâs behaviour is more subtle. The Dukeâs proposal to Isabella at the conclusion of the play, as he asks her to âgive [him her] hand,â in marriage, coincides with the revelation that Claudio is indeed alive. It appears that the Duke has orchestrated the timing of his proposal to most forcefully secure Isabella and in this sense, his abuse of power can be likened to Angeloâs âdevilishâ bribery. This is as, through Shakespeareâs depiction of Isabella, it is evident that she has little interest in marriage; she simply wishes to join a convent where she âmust not speak with men,â as she lives a life of âstrict restraint.â The Duke is aware of this, yet he demands Isabella to âbe [his]â-Â wishing to take her from her true desire and Shakespeare is able to elucidate Isabellaâs distaste through her response to this: silence. By contrasting Isabellaâs once powerful voice - her âspeechless dialectâ that can âmove menâ - with her silence in response to the Dukeâs proposal, Shakespeare is able to convey the depth of the Dukeâs selfishness and thus his similarity to Angelo.\n\nWe've got a character list for you in Measure for Measure by William Shakespeare (just scroll down to the Character section).\n\nWhatâs important to realise about these bits of evidence is that you can use them in so many different prompts, provided that you tailor your wording to best answer the topic. For example, you could try fitting at least one of the above examples in these prompts:Â\n\nâGive me your hand and say you will be mineâ¦â The characters in âMeasure for Measureâ are more interested in taking than giving. Discuss.Â\n\nâMore than our brother is our chastity.' Explore how Shakespeare presents Isabella's attitude to chastity throughout Measure for Measure.\n\nâI have seen corruption boil â¦' To what extent does Shakespeare explore corruption in Measure for Measure, and by what means?Â\n\nâMeasure or Measure presents a society in which women are denied power.â Discuss.\n\nHow To Kick Start Your Essay with a Smashing Introduction\n\nThereâs no set way on how to write an introduction. Lots of people write them in many different ways and these can all do well! This is the best part about English - you donât have to be writing like the person sitting next to you in order to get a good mark. I personally preferred writing short and sweet introductions, just because they were quick to write and easy to understand.Â\n\nFor example, for the prompt...\n\nâ...women are frail too.âÂ\n\nTo what extent does âMeasure for Measureâ examine the flaws of Isabella?Â\n\n...my topic sentences were...\n\nIsabella is depicted as a moral, virtuous and pious woman, but it is this aspect of her nature that paradoxically aligns her with the âtyrannousâ Angelo.Â\n\nShakespeare explores the hypocrisy and corruption of Isabella as a flaw, as she deviates from her initially âgentle and fairâ nature.\n\nDespite exploring Isabellaâs flaws to a large degree, Shakespeare does indeed present her redemption at the denouement of the play.Â\n\n...and my introduction was:Â\n\nWilliam Shakespeareâs play, âMeasure for Measureâ depicts a seventeenth century Viennese society in which disease, misconduct and licentiousness are rife. It is upon a backdrop of such ordeals that Shakespeare presents the character of Isabella, who is initially depicted as of stark contrast to the libertine populate of Vienna. To a considerable extent, âMeasure for Measureâ does indeed examine the flaws of the âgentle and fairâ Isabella, but Shakespeare suggests that perhaps she is not âsaintâ nor âdevil,â rather that she is a human with her own flaws and with her own redeeming qualities.Â\n\nInstead of rewording my topic sentences, I touched on them more vaguely, because I knew that I wouldnât get any âextraâ points for repeating them twice, essentially.Â However, if you feel more confident in touching on your topic sentences more specifically - go ahead!! There are so many different ways to write an introduction! Do what works for you!Â\n\nBody ParagraphsÂ\n\nThis body paragraph included my pairing between Angelo and Isabella. My advice would be to continue to incorporate the language used in the prompt. In this paragraph, you can see me use the word âflawâ quite a bit, just in order to ensure that Iâm actually answering the prompt, not a prompt that I have studied before.Â\n\nIsabella is depicted as a moral, virtuous and pious woman, but it is this aspect of her nature that paradoxically aligns her with the âtyrannousâ Angelo. Where Angelo is âof ample grace and honour,â Isabella is âgentle and fair.â Where Angelo believes in âstricture and firm abstinence,â Isabella too believes that âmost desire should meet the full blow of justice.â This similarity is enhanced by their seclusion from the lecherous society in which they reside. Angelo lives alone in his garden, âsuccumbed by brick,â requiring âtwo keysâ to enter, whilst Isabella desires the life of a nun where she âmust not speak with menâ or âshow [her] face.â This depiction of both Angelo and Isabella stresses their seclusion, piety and restriction from the âviceâ that the libertine populate is drunk from. However, Shakespeareâs revelation that Angelo is âyet a devilâ though âangel on the outward side,â is perhaps Shakespeareâs commentary on absolute stricture being yet a facade, a flaw even. Shakespeare presents Isabellaâs chastity and piety as synonymous with her identity, which ultimately leaves her unable to differentiate between the two, as she states that she would âthrow down [her] life,â for Claudio, yet maintains that âmore than our brother is our chastity.â Though virtuous in a sense, she is cruel in another. Although at first glance, Shakespeareâs depiction of Isabellaâs excessive puritanical nature appears to be her virtue, by aligning her with the âdevilâ that is Angelo, it appears that this is indeed her flaw.Â\n\nConclude Your Essay by Dazzling Your Assessor!Â Â\n\nMy main tip for a conclusion is to finish it off with a confident commentary of the entire piece and what you think that the author was trying to convey through their words (in relation to the topic). For example, in pretty much all of my essays, I would conclude with a sentence that referenced the entire play -Â for example, how it appeared to be such a polarising play, with largely exaggerated, polarising characters/settings (eg. Angelo and the Duke, or the brothels that stood tall next to the monastery):Â\n\nUltimately, Shakespeareâs play âMeasure for Measure,â depicts Isabella as a multifaceted character. She is not simply one thing - not simply good nor bad -Â her characterâs depiction continues to oscillate between the polar ends of the spectrum. Although yes, she does have flaws, so too does she have redeeming qualities. Though at times deceitful and hypocritical, she too is forgiving and gentle. Thus, as Shakespeareâs play, âMeasure for Measure,â does centre on polarising characters in a polarising setting, perhaps through his exploration of Isabellaâs flaws alongside her virtues, he suggests that both the good and the bad inhabit us.\n\nMeasure for Measure is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nWe've explored themes, characters, literary devices and historical context amongst other things over on our Women of Troy by Euripides blog post. If you need a quick refresher or youâre new to studying this text, I highly recommend checking it out as well as ourUltimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nHere, weâll be breaking down a Women of Troy essay topic using LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, you can learn about it in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nWithout further ado, letâs get into it!\n\nThe Prompt: ââWe are loot my son and I, soldiersâ plunder.â Discuss how Euripides highlights the plight of women taken as slaves in war.âÂ\n\nTHINK\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThe first thing to note about this prompt is that it is a 'howâ question, it is essentially asking us to identify the literary techniques Euripides has employed in order to âhighlightâ the womenâs âplightâ. The noun âplightâ is defined as a troublesome or unfortunate situation, yet we must consider this word in the context of war. How do the women suffer? In other words, how does Euripides demonstrate to his reader just how dejected the women are as slaves?\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nIt is relatively simple to identify the literary techniques which consistently appear throughout Euripidesâ play, such as imagery, metaphor and simile (not entirely sure what literary techniques are? We have a list of them for you here). However, keeping in mind we have to form three paragraphs, we should consider Euripidesâ authorial voice more broadly. For example, the women consistently lament their disillusionment with the gods. This is not a literary technique in itself, but it is still a literary choice which Euripides has made and which has been deepened with more specific literary devices like metaphor. The same could be said for the womenâs struggle for hope, and the contrast between their joyous pasts and dismal futures.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nUnlike a âto what extentâ question, we do not have to form an argument. Instead, we must forge a discussion of Euripidesâ literary decisions as a playwright.\n\nP1: Euripides juxtaposes the triumphant pasts of the Trojan women with their tragic futures. The 'shining citadels of Troy' are now a 'black smokened ruinâ.\n\nP2: Euripides illuminates the womenâs attempts to retain futile hope. Note that hope also comes in the form of revenge.\n\nP3: The dramatic irony of the play renders the womenâs desperate calls upon the gods all the more tragic. Here, we can also make reference to the prologue, and Atheneâs ploy to create a storm on the Greeksâ journey home which also ultimately affects the women.\n\nEXECUTE\n\nEssay\n\nAt the heart of the conflict in The Women of Troy, lies the anguished 'suffering' (1) of the Trojan women as they confront their fates as 'slaves', and remember their pasts as wives and mothers. In his tragedy, first performed in Athens circa 415 BCE, Euripides amplifies the conflicted voices of the Trojan women, voices which are by contrast suppressed and disregarded in the Homeric works the Iliad and the Odyssey. Euripidesâ stark dichotomy between the glories and 'rituals' of the past, and the sombre 'grief' of the present, elucidate the magnitude of their losses, both material and moral. For as Andromache laments, these women have been objectified as 'loot', mere spoils of war to be abused and exploited. (2) The womenâs tendency to clutch onto chimerical (3) hopes and values only serves to further illuminate the profundity of their suffering once these ambitions have been brutally quashed in the 'dust' of their 'smoke blackened ruin' of Troy. Perhaps most significantly, Euripides juxtaposes the lingering though pitiful hope of the women with the godsâ complete 'desert[ion]' of Troy, positioning the women in an ironic chasm of cruel abandonment. Thus, the plight of women as wartime captives is dramatised by Euripides, corralling the audience into an ultimate stance of pity and empathy.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(1) It is often useful to embed short/one word quotes in your essay (we teach you how in How To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss). It shows you have a great understanding of the text, and reads fluidly as opposed to overly long quotes.\n\nâ(2) Here, I have addressed the quote in the prompt in a single sentence, unpacking Euripidesâ analogy of Andromache and Astyanax as âlootâ. By comparing the two characters to war spoils, he is suggesting that they have been stripped of their free will and autonomy.\n\nâ(3) It is really important to vary your vocabulary in order to increase the sophistication of your essay. The adjective âchimericalâ refers to an ideal which is impossible to achieve.Â\n\nEuripidesâ juxtaposition between the dismal future of the Trojan women and the zenith of their pasts, further illuminates the chasm of their sufferings and losses as the ultimate victims of wartime atrocities. Chiefly, Euripides contrasts Hecubaâs former royal status with the demoralizing fate of her captivity, encapsulating this tragic fall from nobility with the ironic imagery, 'throned in the dustâ. Yet perhaps what truly emphasises her plight as a slave is her enduring role as a maternal figure of leadership, encapsulated in her regard of the chorus as '[her] children' and her reciprocated address as 'dear queen' and 'your mother'. Despite the 'death agony' she feels, she chooses to maintain her nobility through the depth of her morality, dramatizing the pitiful nature of her plight (4). Moreover, Euripidesâ juxtaposition between the 'shining citadels of Troy' and the 'misery' of the chorus elucidates the significance of 'home', a source of solace which has been barbarically stripped away from them. Likewise, Andromache laments her past as a dutiful and faithful wife, contrasting her fidelity against her fate as a 'concubine' to the formidable Neoptolemus (5). Euripides implies that Andromache must abandon her reputation as the 'perfect wife' â the very attribute for which she was chosen especially â doomed to confront a life of sexual slavery, an unwilling mother of Neoptolemusâ children.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(4) Here, I have used the word âplightâ, making sure I am engaging directly with the prompt. It is often easy to fall into the trap of creating a generalised essay which only loosely adheres to the question.Â\n\nâ(5) It is more sophisticated to specify the name of Andromacheâs husband (Neoptolemus), rather than to just simply state âAndromacheâs husbandâ (even though he is not featured as a character in Euripidesâ play).\n\nEuripides (6) characterises the women by their tendency to clutch on to 'hope[s]' and ideals that are impossible to fulfil. Almost a coping mechanism of sorts, the chorus paradoxically romanticise the Greek landscape in the first episode, lauding the 'sacred halls', 'green fields', 'beautiful river[s]' and 'wealth' of Hellas. Yet, their ardent critiques of their future 'home[s]' rejects any notion that the women truly believe these glorifications of the Greek realm. Similarly, Hecuba is motivated by her futile hope that Astyanax may one day seek vengeance and be 'the savior of Troy' by 'rebuild[ing]' the city. Yet tragically, this doomed hope is violently quashed by Odysseus 'blind panic' and acute lack of rationality: the 'liar' and 'deceiver' who 'lead the Greek council' in their debate. Though this hope initially provides her with some form of solace, all comfort is dashed with the announcement of his 'butchery'. Likewise, Cassandra is motivated by her own pursuit for revenge, lauding her 'sacred marriage' to Agamemnon as an event worthy of 'praise' and 'celebration'. Yet her hope is also jaded, for she must in the process 'flout all religious feeling' as a slave of Agamemnonâs 'lust', until she meets her painful hour of death at Clytemnestraâs hands.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(6) Notice that several of the sentences have begun with âEuripides characterisesâ or âEuripides illuminatesâ, engaging with the âhowâ part of the prompt. We are showing what the author has done and why.\n\nIronically, Euripides illuminates the plight of the Trojan women through his dramatic elucidation of the godsâ callous abandonment of the ruined Troy. Euripides juxtaposes the past 'rituals', 'dances', 'songs', 'sacrifices', 'offerings' and 'ceremonies' of the chorus with their bitter laments that 'the gods hate Troy' and that they are ultimately characterised by avarice. They are neither answered not consoled in their ultimate time of mourning, for the audience is aware that Poseidon has fled the scene in the prologue, disillusioned by the 'ceas[ing]' of 'worship', leaving 'nothing (â¦) worth a godâs consideration' in the fallen city. What is also rendered ironic by Euripides, is Atheneâs formidable ploy to 'make the Greeksâ return home a complete disaster.' Regardless of Atheneâs true motives for instigating this ultimate pursuit of comeuppance, the fact remains that the women too must endure this perilous journey to Greece. Not only are the despairing wives, mothers and daughters condemned to 'abject slavery' on foreign soil, they are 'innocent: victims who may â alongside the Greeks â find themselves on the shores of Euboea, among the 'float[ing] (â¦) corpses' of the Greek soldiers. They are not simply abandoned by the gods, they are, directly or indirectly, punished. (7)\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(7) This is a more original point which other students may not automatically think of. We often view Atheneâs âployâ as a deserved punishment of the âmurderousâ Greeks, yet there is no true justice, for the women too are ultimately affected.\n\nIn a play which serves to fill the silence of the Trojan women in the legendary works of the Iliad and the Odyssey (8), Euripides augments the pitiful plight of the Trojan women with agonizing references to past 'happiness', and equally unbearable forecasts of their roles as 'slaves' of Greek lust. They are indeed 'loot' and they are indeed 'plunder' â as Andromache so bitterly laments â yet their plight is recorded in the works of 'poets' to come, remembered as a legacy of stoicism 'a hundred generations hence.' Taken as our 'great theme', these women are 'sufferer[s]', yet they are also heroes.\n\nAnnotations:\n\n(8) Just as I have done in the introduction, I have referred to the context of the play in the conclusion. The Iliad and the Odyssey provided the framework for Euripidesâ play, so by referencing Homerâs works we are showing the examiner that we have an understanding of the historical context.Â\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into Women of Troy, check out our A Killer Text Guide: Women of Troy study guide.

Characters\n\nPriam\n\nPriam is an elderly king of Troy. As a child, his sister Hesione saved him from slavery, and had his named changed from Podarces to Priam, the name meaning âthe ransomed oneâ or âthe price paid'. After the death of his son Hector, Priam envisions himself in plain clothing, riding a plain cart to Achilles who is effectively holding Hector ransom. His vision is the catalyst for the novelâs events, for his journey is one of learning and self-development. Though the royal family is doubtful of his plan to save Hector, Priam is resolute and insists that he needs to try his best to confront Achilles as a father, rather than as king. After many decades as king of Troy, Priam is determined to reinvent how he will be remembered; as a king who performed an extraordinary act of heroism in order to save his beloved son.\n\nAchilles\n\nAchilles is known as the greatest warrior of the Greeks. The death of Patroclus, his closest companion and hinted lover, drives Achilles to insanity. Hector murdered Patroclus and, as a result, Achilles takes revenge by killing Hector. He then drags Hectorâs dead body along the walls of Troy for the next 11 days. Achilles loses his sense of humanity as he is possessed by his rage, hatred and grief.\n\nSomax\n\nSomax is representative of the âcommon manâ in Ransom. He is chosen to escort Priam to Achilles. His simple and plain presence is contrasted with Priamâs royal status. He often engages in useless chatter and performs daily activities in a way that is foreign to the king. Although Somax is far from royalty, his great deal of affection for his daughter-in-law and granddaughter teaches Priam about love, family and life.\n\nBeauty\n\nBeauty is Somaxâs favourite mule. She accompanies Priam and Somax on their journey to the Greek camp where Achilles resides.\n\nShock\n\nSomaxâs other mule who carries the cart to Achillesâ camp.\n\nHecuba\n\nHecuba is Priamâs beloved wife and mother of Hector. She is initially uncertain of Priamâs vision to save Hector. However, after hearing Priamâs sentimental reasons, she shows support and urges him to first share his plan with their family and the kingdomâs council before he departs.\n\nHector\n\nHector is Priamâs son and also the leader of the Trojan army. He is kind, brave and noble without any cruel intentions, unlike his rival Achilles. During a battle between the Trojans and the Greeks, Hector kills Patroclus. This results in Achilles challenging Hector to a battle, resulting in Hectorâs death and Achillesâ triumph.\n\nNeoptolemus\n\nNeoptolemus is Achillesâ son. Although he is mentioned throughout Ransom, he makes his first appearance at the end of the novel where he savagely slaughters an old and defenseless Priam in an effort to avenge his fatherâs death.â\n\nâ\n\n______\n\nBy the way, to download a PDF version of this blog for printing or offline use, click here!\n\n______\n\nâ\n\nâ2. Themes\n\nIdentity\n\nRansom explores who we are and what it means to have an identity. As the leader of Troy for many decades, Priam has always viewed himself as a king. It appears as though Priam has been unhappy with his identity for quite some time, is physically weak, and feels as though he cannot protect his kingdom as efficiently as he used to. However, the death of Hector is a catalyst for Priam as he realises that he needs to become a âfatherâ rather than the âkingâ he had become so accustomed to. His search for Hector is also a search for himself, to reinvent who he is and how he wishes others to remember him.\n\nMeanwhile, Somax is designated as the kingâs herald, with the name Idaeus. He secretly notes his unhappiness with this name appointment, since he is âSomax, not Idaeus'. The name âSomaxâ is associated with many significant events in his life including his marriage and family, yet the new unfamiliar name strips him of this identity. Somaxâs confidence and pride in his identity is starkly contrasted with Priamâs pursuit for an identity transformation.\n\nChange\n\nMalouf demonstrates that it is never too late to change oneâs ways. Priamâs determination to change how he is remembered â from just another king leading a regal life to a hero who went to extraordinary lengths to regain his child â demonstrates that change is within our grasp. Even though his beautiful wife Hecuba and the rest of his family have reservations about his desire to confront Achilles, Priam is resolved in taking a âchance', rather than achieving nothing by remaining within the walls of his home. Unexpectedly, this one idea propels Priam into a multitude of other changes. His journey with Somax teaches Priam a far greater deal than he had anticipated, for he learns to appreciate the value of the human connection and other daily simplicities in life.\n\nAlthough Achilles is driven by hatred and anger after Patroclusâ death, as with Priam, he manages to change his ways. He is touched by Priamâs pleas and consequently accepts the ransom and returns Hectorâs body. He is able to reach this state of peace by releasing his immoral intentions and even offers to hold a ritual for Hectorâs body in the Greek walls that very night. This transformation, from a human who responds to grief with vengeance to someone who releases and forgives, demonstrates the benefits we can gain from amending our ways.\n\nRevenge, Guilt and Peace\n\nRevenge is portrayed as a never-ending vicious cycle until both parties reach a negotiation or peace. After Patroclusâ death, Achilles hunts down Hector in order to avenge his best friendâs early death. Although he is successful in murdering Hector, Achilles does not follow the custom of leaving the body for the grieving family to bury. Instead, Achilles feels the need to mutilate the body day after day without any sense of remorse or regret. His additional need to inflict harm on Hectorâs body indicates that revenge will not bring closure. His sense of loss is shown as he reflects feeling empty inside, to the point where he no longer feels like himself, but someone else altogether.\n\nAlthough Achilles and Priam ultimately find peace within themselves, many years later Achillesâ son Neoptolemus murders Priam, bounded by the same hatred and pain depicted by Achilles. Neoptolemusâ subsequent guilt and regret is carried with him throughout the rest of his life, demonstrating that again, revenge is not the answer to any problem.\n\nChance and Fate\n\nThe role of the gods is heavily woven into the events that unfold in Ransom. Priam only begins his transition and journey after envisioning the goddess Iris, who suggests that he take a âchanceâ and try to save Hector from Achillesâ camp. During his journey, a jovial young man who joins the travellers is revealed as Hermes, a god who has come to safely guide the elderly men to Achilles. The power of the gods in controlling human fate is illustrated during the scene where Hermes saves the travellers from being swept away by a stream.\n\nNevertheless, it can also be argued that it is the charactersâ decisions that lead them to their fate. Although the gods may have instilled in Priam the idea that he should rescue Hector, it is the kingâs determination which is a main driving force for the journey. Even when confronted with doubt and hesitancy from his family, it is Priam who pushes onwards to fulfil his vision. Whether his actions were already predestined or of his own agency is up to you to decide.\n\nNature Versus Man\n\nManâs presence on earth is shown to have little significance in comparison to the power of nature. While the events in Ransom teach the characters many valuable lessons, ultimately these meaningful moments in the humansâ lives disappear as one reaches their fate â death. Time moves on beyond our lives as we are forgotten over decades and centuries while nature prevails. Priamâs desire to be remembered by others highlights how little significance a life possesses unless one behaves extraordinarily. Malouf demonstrates that in the end, life just is â we are granted by nature to have a brief existence, yet in the end, nature and time will move forward without us.\n\nCommoners Versus Royalty\n\nAlthough royalty is portrayed to be blessed with power and authority, it is ironically the commoners in Ransom who appear to have the ârichestâ (and more fulfilling) lives. For the first time, Priam is exposed to the different interests and values of the common man and is intrigued by the simplicities of life. It is Somax, a mere old man from the marketplace, who teaches Priam more about life than he had imagined possible.\n\n3. Symbols\n\nJoveâs Eagle\n\nJoveâs eagle is a representation of a bird renowned for its keen sight. The presence of Joveâs eagle during Priam and Somaxâs departure hints that the gods will safely guide their journey as the bird behaves as a lookout. Furthermore, the symbol of the eagleâs powerful vision is contrasted with Priamâs âblindnessâ at the beginning of the journey since he is yet to experience the outside world. It is during the journey that he learns about himself and others, and thus, improves his âsight.â Coincidently, Joveâs eagle is no longer mentioned when Priam is endowed with his new insight.\n\nCart\n\nThe royal cart is âa fine new one, the marks of the adze still visible on its timbers. The twelve-spoked wheels are elaborately carved and painted, a wickerwork canopy covers the tray'. On all occasions, the king had used this elegant cart to alert others that royalty was present. The use of this cart demonstrates how Priam has been encapsulated in his own royal sphere since everything is meticulously chosen and designed specifically for the king. Nevertheless, his demand for a âcommon work cartâ depicts his determination for a simple approach to Achilles, as a father to another father. This simplicity highlights Priamâs desire to become just another man and father, anonymous in the plain cart with the hopes of retrieving Hector.\n\nPriam as a Child\n\nAt the beginning of the journey, Priam is characterised with childish traits. When Somax urges Priam to dabble his feet in the stream, words such as âobedient toddler', âthree uncertain steps', and âhappy smileâ reflect the actions of a young child trying new experiences. This childish nature is contrasted with Priamâs old and frail age, which demonstrates that although he has lived a life in royalty, his lack of exposure to âreal lifeâ has left him crippled of the simplest experiences such as the cooling effect of feet in water and eating delicious homemade cookies.\n\nCakes\n\nThe cakes Somax brings along during the journey highlight Priamâs lack of knowledge of even the simplest things. For Somax, the little griddlecakes are a regular and delectable snack, yet Priam 'ha[s] never seen them before'. Priamâs unfamiliarity with the cakes represents his isolation from the âreal worldâ since he has been deprived from things that even commoners view as ordinary.\n\nFuthermore, Somaxâs lengthy chatter about his daughter-in-law cooking the cakes with the âbatter bubbling and setting and turning a golden brownâ prompts Priam to think about the activities in his kingdom that occur behind closed doors. He had previously never noticed that there was so much preparation and work that went into the food that appeared at his table, let alone the ingredients and thickness of a batter. These matters had been of little concern to Priam, yet he realises that even the âcommon and lowâ¦activities and facts of life, had an appeal'.\n\nHectorâs Body\n\nAlthough Achilles drags Hectorâs body across the walls of Troy for eleven days, each morning he would return to find Hectorâs body healed of any wounds, and absent of any physical damage to his body. This is a cruel reminder of the godâs ability to âtoy aroundâ with the Ancient Greeksâ lives. Hectorâs body also symbolises how revenge is not the answer to any conflict, since dealing with a tragic loss through revenge does not gain anything but more pain and suffering.\n\nSniffing\n\nAlthough Priam initially believes he understands the distress of losing a son, Somaxâs experience of losing his son is driven with emotions that Priam had never previously experienced. When sharing the story of his sonâs death, Somax sniffles, an âodd habitâ according to Priam. The use of âodd habitâ to describe Somaxâs sadness demonstrates how Priam has never truly felt the loss of his son, but only the loss of a royal relationship between king and prince.\n\nLater on, Somax once again âsnufflesâ and ârubs his noseâ at the thought of the ending to their journey. Similarly, Priam makes âsmall sounds', presumably crying as well. The transformation of Priam from someone who failed to empathise with Somaxâs tears at the beginning of the journey to a man filled with emotions demonstrates that Priam undergoes both a physical and metaphysical journey where he undergoes self-development and appreciation of the world around him.\n\n4. Plot, Analysis, Important Passages and Quotes\n\nChapter I\n\nPlot\n\nAchilles, the greatest warrior of the Greeks, stands next to the sea while reminiscing about the past. After his motherâs death he had âentered the rough world of menâ (p. 6) where wars and battles prevail. Every morning, he feels the need to âtramp to shoreâ (p. 10) since he is haunted by the death of his âsoulmate and companionâ Patroclus, and his raging hatred towards Hector, killer of Patroclus and thus, the âimplacable enemy'.\n\nWhen Achilles was a child, his cousin Patroclus came to live with the young Achilles since the former had killed the son of a high official of the royal court due to a âquarrel over a game of knucklebonesâ (p. 11). In need of asylum, Patroclus came to live with Achillesâ family. As the years passed, the pair grew closer to the extent where Achilles believes that âhe had mated with Patroclusâ (p. 15).\n\nWhen the tide of the battle was against the Greeks, Patroclus disguises himself in Achillesâ armour in order to instill fear in the Trojans and cause them to return to the safety of their walls, thus providing temporary relief for the Greeks. In his last act for his closest friend, Patroclus is killed in battle*. The death of Patroclus left Achilles with an overwhelming sense of loss and also burning animosity. Achilles whispers that he will join Patroclus soon, but firstly, he has to avenge Patroclusâ killer, Hector.\n\nHector, the son of Trojan king Priam and leader of the Trojan army, wore Achilles' armour as a sign of triumph and disrespect for the Greeks. In a dramatic battle between Hector and himself, Achilles was successful in killing his enemy. Achillesâ Myrmidons then stripped Hector of his armour and âwithout pityâ¦plunged their swords into Hectorâs unprotected fleshâ (p. 24). For Achilles however, this was not enough. Still fuelled by his pain, Achilles ties Hectorâs body to a chariot and drags it âup and down under the walls of Troyâ (p. 26) as the dead warriorâs royal family devastatingly watches on. Achilles feels like a âdead manâ¦feeling nothingâ (p. 26), unable to seal the void left by his beloved friend.\n\nThe next day, Achilles is furious to find Hectorâs body âsmoothly sealed and the torn flesh made whole again'. His men cannot bear to look at him as he drives the chariot with Hectorâs body along the walls of the Trojans once again. Afterwards he quickly falls asleep, into âoblivionâ (p. 35) as he struggles with the shame and guilt of his actions. He is âwaiting for a breakâ¦something new and unimaginableâ in his life.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe Human Side\n\nAlong with the conflict between Greece and Troy, Ransom also delves into the consequences of those affected by the war. As the greatest warrior of all Greeks, Achilles has lived his life as a fighter. Nevertheless, his pathway in life has led him to believe that âsuch a life is death to the warrior spiritâ (p. 7). While warriors are known for sacrificing their lives in the battlefield, Achilles does not literally refer to warriors confronting death each time they fight for their team. In fact, âdeath to the warrior spiritâ means to metaphorically lose what it means to âliveâ when one experiences bloodshed in each war. Growing up surrounded by âthe rough world of menâ (p. 6), Achilles develops traits of aggression, cruelty and vengefulness in order to become an implacable man of war. As a consequence, Achilles only knows how to deal with Patroclusâ death with a fighterâs mindset. Instead of grieving openly, âhe never permit[s] himself to betray to others what he [feels]â (p. 5), thus detaching himself from the natural human process of grieving. In order to deal with his friendâs tragic ending, Achilles' âsoul chang[es] colourâ as drags Hectorâs body for eleven days without any sense of regret or remorse, and thus, is referred to as âdeath to his human spiritâ since he was no longer âa living manâ (p. 27). He faces Patroclusâ death with the same warrior traits of aggression, cruelty and vengefulness, depriving himself of any ability to humanely mourn his close friendâs death.\n\nFurthermore, Achilles grieves for his mother in the opening passages of Ransom. During this time of loss, his mother symbolises Achillesâ need to be nurtured. The imagery of the sea surface as a âbellyâ and âa membrane stretched to a fine transparencyâ (p. 3) represents his motherâs pregnancy where he âhad hung curled in a dream of pre-existenceâ for ânine changes of the moonâ â or in other words, nine months of pregnancy. Achilles is characterised as a foetus, for his position is âchin down, shoulders hunchedâ as though he is inside a womb. Although Achilles is a fighter, he hides the fact that he wishes to be ârocked and comfortedâ by his mother, thus demonstrating that even beneath the surface of a cold-hearted warrior, the current of human emotions can cripple a manâs confident veneer.\n\nIf you'd like to read more of my analysis, feel free to access a sample of our ebook A Killer Text Guide: Ransom.

How To Prepare for Your Text Response SAC and Exam\n\n5. How To Write a Text Response\n\n1. What Is Text Response?\n\nLike its name, Text Response is when you respond to a text. The most popular texts are novels and films; however, plays, poetry and short stories are also common. Your response will be in the form of an essay, in which you discuss themes, ideas and characters. Recall all the novels and films you've studied since Year 7 (there'll be quite a few!). You should be very familiar with the process of watching a film or reading a novel, participating in class discussions about themes and characters, and finally, submitting an essay based on the text.\n\nAs you graduate into higher year levels, you spend each year revising and improving on TEEL, learning to better incorporate quotes and formulating even longer essays than the year before (remember when you thought you couldn't possibly write an essay more than 500 words?).\n\nThe good news is, all of that learning is now funnelled into VCEâs Text Response, one of the three parts of the VCE English study design. Text Response, officially known as âReading and Respondingâ in the study design, is the first Area of study (AoS 1) - meaning that the majority of students will tackle the Text Response SAC in Term 1. Let's get into it!\n\n2. What Are You Expected To Cover? (Text Response Criteria)\n\nWhat are teachers and examiners expecting to see in your essays? Below are the VCE criteria for Text Response essays.\n\nNote: Some schools may express the following points differently, however, they should all boil down to the same points - what is necessary in a Text Response essay.\n\na) Critically analyse texts and the ways in which authors construct meaning;\n\nMuch of the âmeaningâ in a novel/film comes instinctively to readers. Why is it that we can automatically distinguish between a protagonist from an antagonist? Why is it that we know whether or not the author supports or denounces an idea?\n\nHere you need to start looking at how the author constructs their texts and why they have made that choice. For example, the author describes a protagonist using words with positive connotations (kind, brave, charming), whereas the antagonist is described with words using negative connotations (vain, egocentric, selfish).\n\nFor example, 'in Harry Potter, by describing the protagonist Harry as \"brave\", the author JK Rowling exhibits the idea of how possessing bravery when making tough choices or facing challenges is a strong and positive trait.'\n\nb) Analyse the social, historical and/or cultural values embodied in texts;\n\nSociety, history and culture all shape and influence us in our beliefs and opinions. Authors use much of what theyâve obtained from the world around them and employ this knowledge to their writing. Understanding their values embodied in texts can help us as readers, identity and appreciate theme and character representations.\n\nFor example, 'through the guilty verdict of Tom Robinson in To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee expresses the belief that the American legal system in the 1930s was not always fair or just.'\n\nFor more information on context and authorial intent in VCE English, read Tim's blog, Context and Authorial Intention in VCE English, or Olivia's on what authorial intent is and why it's important.\n\nc) Discuss and compare possible interpretations of texts using evidence from the text;\n\nBe open to the idea that many texts can be interpreted in many ways. Texts are rarely concrete and simple. Take The Bible, a book that is one of the most popular and famous books in history but is interpreted differently by every person. Acknowledging more than one perspective on a certain aspect of the text, or acknowledging that perhaps the writer is intentionally ambiguous, is a valuable skill that demonstrates you have developed a powerful insight into your text.\n\nFor example, 'in The Thing Around Your Neck, feminist readers condone Adichie's stories which all revolve around women either as protagonist or as narrators, giving voice to the disempowered gender in Nigerian society.'\n\nâd) Use appropriate metalanguage to construct a supported analysis of a text;\n\nWhile you should absolutely know how to embed quotes in your essay like a boss, you want to have other types of evidence in your Text Response essay. You must discuss how the author uses the form that he/she is writing in to develop their discussion. This encompasses a huge breadth of things from metaphors to structure to language.\n\nFor example, 'The personification of Achilles as \"wolf, a violator of every law of men and gods\", illustrates his descent from human to animalâ¦.' or 'Maloufâs constant use of the present voice and the chapter divisions allow the metaphor of time to demonstrate the futility and omnipresence of warâ¦'.\n\nTo learn more about metalanguage, read our 'What Is Metalanguage?' post.\n\ne) Control and effectiveness of language use, as appropriate to the task\n\nWhen examiners read essays, they are expected to get through about 12-15 essays in an hour! This results in approximately 5 minutes to read, get their head around, and grade your essay - not much time at all! It is so vital that you donât give the examiner an opportunity to take away marks because they have to reread certain parts of your essay due to poor expression and grammar.\n\nFor further advice on the above criteria points, read Emily's (English study score 46): Year 12: How To Turn Your Text Response Essays From Average to A+.\n\n3. School Assessed Coursework (SAC), Exams and Allocated Marks\n\nReading and Creating is assessed in Unit 1 (Year 11) and Unit 3 (Year 12). The number of allocated marks are:\n\nUnit 1 - dependant on school\n\nUnit 3 English â 30 marks\n\nUnit 3 EAL â 40 marks\n\nExactly when Text Response is assessed within each unit is dependent on each school; some schools at the start of the Unit, others at the end. The time allocated to your SAC is also school-based. Often, schools use one or more periods combined, depending on how long each of your periods last. Teachers can ask you to write anywhere from 800 to 1000 words for your essay (keep in mind that itâs about quality, not quantity!)\n\nIn your exam, you get a whopping total of 3 hours to write 3 essays (Text Response, Comparative and Language Analysis). The general guide is 60 minutes on Text Response, however, it is up to you exactly how much time you decide to dedicate to this section of the exam. Your Text Response essay will be graded out of 10 by two different examiners. Your two unique marks from these examiners will be combined, with 20 as the highest possible mark.\n\n4. How To Prepare for Your Text Response SAC and Exam\n\nPreparation is a vital component in how you perform in your SACs and exam so itâs always a good idea to find out what is your best way to approach assessments. This is just to get you thinking on the different study methods you can try before a SAC. Here are my top strategies (ones I actually used in VCE) for Text Response preparation that can be done any time of year (including holidays - see How To Recharge Your Motivation Over the School Holidays for more tips):\n\na) Reread your book (or rewatch the film)\n\nAfter all the learning and discussion youâve had with your teacher and peers, you should have now developed a solid foundation of knowledge. Rereading a book enables you to refresh your memory on subplots, popular passages and most importantly, helps you fill in any missing gaps in knowledge. Take this as an opportunity to get familiar with the parts of the texts you're less confident with, or to examine a particular theme that you know you're weaker in (HINT: A good place to start is to make sure you know the difference between themes, motifs and symbols!)\n\nb) Do a close analysis\n\nThis is like an advanced version of rereading a book. A 'close analysis' - a term stolen from VCE Literature (thanks Lit!) - is basically where you select a passage (a short chapter or a few pages), and analyse it in detail.\n\nAs you move through the passage, you can pick out interesting word choices made by the author and try to interpret why they have made this choice. Doing a close analysis will immensely strengthen your metalanguage analysis skills, and also give you the opportunity to stand out from other students because you can offer unique and original analysis and evidence in your essay. I know this can be a bit confusing, so this video below shows a full close analysis of a Macbeth passage in action:\n\nc) Read and watch Lisa's Study Guides' resources\n\nDoing this study all by yourself can be rather daunting, so we've got your back.

How good is that?\n\neBooks\n\nAnd if that isn't enough, I'd highly recommend my How To Write A Killer Text Response ebook.\n\nMost people seem to the think the most difficult part of Text Response is the writing component - and they're not completely wrong. However, what I've found is that not even students place emphasis on the brainstorming, preparation and planning of Text Response.\n\nThink about it - if you don't come to the table with the best ideas, then how can you expect your essay to achieve A+? Even if you write an exceptional essay, if it doesn't answer the prompt, your teacher won't be sticking a smiley face on your work. We need to avoid these common teacher criticisms, and I have no doubt you've experienced at least once the dreaded, 'you're not answering the prompt', 'you could've used a better example' or 'more in-depth analysis needed'.\n\nEnter my golden strategy - the THINK and EXECUTE strategy. This is a strategy I developed over the past 10 years of tutoring, and I've seen my students improve their marks every time. The THINK and EXECUTE strategy breaks up your Text Response into two parts - first the THINK, then the EXECUTE. Only with the unique THINK approach, will you then be able to EXECUTE your essay to its optimum potential, leading yourself to achieve those higher marks.\n\nTo learn more about the THINK and EXECUTE strategy, download my ebook sample on the shop page or at the bottom of this blog, or check out the video below:\n\nâd) Get your hands on essay topics\n\nOften, teachers will provide you with a list of prompts to practice before your SAC. Some teachers can be kind enough to hint you in the direction of a particular prompt that may be on the SAC. If your teacher hasnât distributed any, donât be afraid to ask.\n\nWe have a number of free essay topics curated by our team at LSG, check some of them out. Also go scroll back up to our list of study guides above, as most of those also have essay prompts included:\n\nââAll the Light We Cannot See Essay Topics\n\nâLike a House on Fire Essay Topicsâ\n\nâThe Handmaid's Tale Essay Topicsââ\n\ne) Brainstorm and write plans\n\nOnce you've done some preliminary revision, it's time to write plans! Plans will help ensure you stick to your essay topic and have a clear outline of what your essay will cover. This clarity is crucial to success in a Text Response essay.\n\nDoing plans is also an extremely time-efficient way to approach SACs. Rather than slaving away hours upon hours over writing essays, writing plans can will save you the burnout and will get you feeling confident faster.\n\nI've curated essay topic breakdown videos based on specific VCE texts. In these videos, I explore keywords, ideas and how I'd plan an essay with corresponding examples/evidence.\n\nf) Write essays\n\nYes, sad, but itâs a fact. Writers only get better by actually writing. Even if you just tackle a couple of essays then at least you will have started to develop a thinking process that will help you to set out arguments logically, utilise important quotes and time yourself against the clock. It will help you write faster as well â something that is a major problem for many students. With that said, let's get into how to write a Text Response next.\n\nTake a look at some of the essays our amazing LSG team have written:\n\nAfter Darkness Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nAll the Light We Cannot See Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nâExtinction A+ Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nâStation Eleven Essay Topic Breakdownââ\n\nWomen of Troy Essay Topic Breakdownâ\n\nIf you need any more tips on how to learn your text in-depth, Susan's (English study score 50) Steps for Success in Text Study guideÂ provides a clear pathway for how to approach your text and is a must read for VCE English students!\n\nAnd, if you're studying a text you hate (ugh!) be sure to check out Lavinia's guide which teaches you how to do well even when you don't like your text!\n\n5. How To Write a Text Response\n\nBefore you start writing, make sure you're familiar with The Five Types of Text Response Prompts. Understanding the different types will help you move beyond a 'basic' one-size-fits-all structure.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn an introduction, you're expected to have the following:\n\nContext (or background)\n\nAuthor's name\n\nTitle of text\n\nContention\n\nMain arguments\n\nHere's an example from Vindhya (English study score 46), in her post Dissecting an A+ Essay Using 'The Golden Age' by Joan London:\n\nPerhaps nothing exemplifies the power of love and recognition more than the bond between Albert Sutton and his older sister, Lizzie, in Joan Londonâs âThe Golden Ageâ. Many of Londonâs characters exhibit suffering that requires compassion and support to heal and grow, to distinguish present from past. However, London explores the perspectives of such characters from different aspects of trauma, and emphasise that love and recognition do not always work to heal and mature. Frank Gold, the novelâs resident âsneakyâ boy who adjusts to newfound life in the Golden Age Convalescent Home seeks love as an adult, rather than eliciting sympathy as a supposed victim. Here love and recognition are unsuccessful in amending Frankâs troubles when given from the perspective of an outsider, a judgemental onlooker. In a similar sense, Ida Gold seeks recognition not from Australia, who she views as a âbackwaterâ, but validation in herself after having been ousted from her Hungarian identity. London, however, makes sure to emphasise the impact that Sullivan has on Frank Goldâs life. Sullivan, a boy only a few years older than Frank, seems content with his future, with his fate, despite his sacrifice of rugby and conventional life. There is a lacking sense of urgency for love and recognition in Sullivanâs life, rather, it appears that Sullivan accepts his fate, regardless of his fatherâs sympathy or support. Thus, London explores a myriad of ways in which love and recognition may or may not heal wounds inflicted upon individuals.\n\nTry to keep your introduction to the point. There's no need to prolong an introduction just to make a set number of sentences. It's always better to be concise and succinct, and then move into your main body paragraphs where the juicy contents of your essay resides.\n\nBody Paragraph\n\nMost of you will be familiar with TEEL. TEEL can stand for:\n\nTopic sentence\n\nExample\n\nEvidence\n\nLinking sentence\n\nIf your teacher or school teaches you something slightly different - that's okay too. At the end of the day the foundations are the same.\n\nEarly in the novel, London makes reference to Norm White, the resident groundskeeper of The Golden Age Convalescent Home. Norm White hands Frank Gold a cigarette, 'as if to say a man has the right to smoke in peace'. Here, there is a complete disregard for rule and convention, an idea that London emphasises throughout the text. This feature provides a counter-cultural experience for Frank, pushing him to realise that he is a strong human being rather than a mere victim. This is a clear contrast to the âbabyishnessâ of the home, and is used as evidence of true humanity in an era where society judged upon the unconventional. Frank yearns for a traditional Australian life after his trauma in Hungary; 'his own memoryâ¦lodged like an attic in the front part of his brain'. Hedwiga and Julia Maraiâs caring of him pushed him towards fear and reluctance to trust, yet also pressured him to seek acceptance in a world that ostracises him for his Jewish heritage and polio diagnosis. This here is why Frank desires a mature, adult connection â love that regards him as an equal human being. Frank seeks Elsaâs love and company as she too loathes being reduced to a victim, an object of pity. Frank thereafter uses humour to joke of his wounds; 'we Jews have to be on the lookout'. Elsa sees 'a look in his eyes that she recognised', thus their bond enables both characters to heal. London alludes that Frank requires love and recognition not from the perspective of a sorrowful onlooker, rather he longs to be recognised as a mature adult.\n\nConclusion\n\nConclusions should be short and sweet.\n\nAlthough trauma is often treated with love and compassion, London details different perspectives on this idea. Whilst Frank Gold requires a specific kind of recognition, Ida and Meyer seek validation in themselves and their relationship, whilst Sullivan is at ease with his fate and does not yearn sympathy from his father.\n\nFor further detail from Sarah (English study score 45), read her advice on 5 Tips for a Mic-Drop Worthy Essay Conclusion.\n\nThat's it for the Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.
