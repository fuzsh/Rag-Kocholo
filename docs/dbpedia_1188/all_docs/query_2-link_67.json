While there, Billi struggles to find a deeper connection to the country and tries to understand her family's decision to keep her grandmother's sickness a secret from her.

It’s a story of freedom and female friendships that has a lot of great scenes, some of which feature a shirtless 26-year-old Brad Pitt.

You grew up watching another movie she directed, The Parent Trap (1998), so we owe her another round of applause for the masterpiece that is The Holiday. Los Angeles-based Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and a London woman named Iris (Kate Winslet) holiday in one another's homes after a bad break-up. Once in their new postal codes, they meet people who change everything they thought they knew about love.

His first movie as Britain's most notorious secret agent is filled with deception, love, unreal stunts, strong female leads, and a twist ending you won't see coming. If you've never seen a 007 film before, let this one be your first. Show less\n\nBefore Christopher Nolan was known as the popular director with brain-bending plots, he made this small film.

It's about a man who has no short-term memory, who's after vengeance for his murdered wife—oh, and it's shot almost entirely in reverse chronology. It's the thing that put Nolan on the map, and it holds up incredibly well. This isn't just a gimmicky premise; It also happens to be a great movie with an impressive twist ending.

Director Marielle Heller gives us the sex-positive coming of age movie you never thought would arrive, while throwing in great performances from Kristen Wiig and Alexander Skarsgård. You'll wish you had this movie as a teen. Show less\n\nThe '00s weren’t the '00s without Amanda Bynes, and She’s the Man proves it.

When Viola (Bynes) finds out that her school is cutting the women’s soccer team, she decides to take a chance and disguises herself as her twin brother to play for his school. When she gets there, she starts to fall for her roommate and teammate, Duke (Channing Tatum). Things get messy.

The movie follows boxer Rocky Balboa on the road to fight heavyweight champion Apollo Creed in a match deemed “a somebody v. nobody.” The film, written by Stallone, would go on to win Best Picture at the Oscars in 1977.

It hits to my inner core a level of nostalgia I haven’t felt in years. Oh, to be 17-years-old again.

That's deliberate—the sadness and symbolism build throughout the film so that you have a full sense of what happened, who did it, and why it matter so, so much. The movie's in black and white, with the smallest pop of color to offer a moment of hope and then (devastatingly) all possible heartbreak in one unforgettable image.

The Torrance family, husband Jack, wife Wendy, and son Danny, are staying in the Overlook Hotel during the winter. Then, the hotel begins to come alive with a terrible, terrifying evil. Stephen King famously hated this adaptation, because Stanley Kubrick takes out all the empathy from the patriarch (Nicholson, playing crazy like he was born to do it). But it makes the story even more powerful. Viewed through today's lens, it's also a haunting look at the effects of domestic violence. Show less\n\nListen.

We could put a lot of Wes Anderson movies on here: Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Darjeeling Limited are all worth a watch. But this is the perfect film if you're looking for quintessential Anderson: It's jam-packed with his favorite stars, quirky as hell, loaded with family drama (Bill Murray perfecting his role as charming jerk), and an epic sea journey at the same time.

Even though this film didn't get quite as many accolades, he was already getting very good at commentary about social disparity and climate change (I'd actually argue that this might even be a little better?). In time for the TV show, watch the original movie: The few survivors of a post-apocalyptic Earth survive, broken apart into classes, in a train that races around the globe.

She enters Area X, a mutated, trippy landscape that's been expanding ever since it was hit by a meteorite. And shit just keeps getting weirder and scarier. This is directed by Alex Garland, the same guy who did Ex Machina (another fascinating, freaky watch). Honestly, he's becoming the next big sci-fi director, and this proves it.

And with all that, this movie is most known for being utterly hysterical and beautifully poignant. Sex workers traverse L.A. in search of friends, clients, and spurned lovers—with some of the snappiest banter I've heard in years.

It was unbelievably innovative for the time by integrating modern research about sociopaths from the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit.
