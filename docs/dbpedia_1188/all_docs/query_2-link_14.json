        "text": "For \"Bill Austin\" in Mamma Mia! (musical), see Bill Austin.\n\nBill Anderson (b. 1952) is one of the three possible fathers of Sophie Sheridan and a Swedish writer and adventurer. He eventually falls in love with Donna's best friend, Rosie Mulligan, the fun-loving, un-married British author.\n\nBill's original last name was Austin and he was Autralian in the musical, based on ABBA's popularity in that country. When the filmmakers cast Stellan Skarsgård they changed Bill's last name to Anderson and his nationality to Sweden, where ABBA has its roots. Currently Bill is American in New York and on tour production of Mamma Mia![1]\n\nDirector Phyllida Lloyd has teased that Bill is possibly Sophie's biological father as in the musical and a deleted scene from the first film, they shared a song(\"Name of the Game\") and storyline, which many thought it was then when they both realized Sophie believes Bill is her father, which means Sophie is much like ABBA who has her roots in Sweden. However, this theory isn't enough to confirm his paternity, and the sequel suggests more evidence to reject it and hints on Harry as the possible father.[2]\n\nMamma Mia! (2008)[]\n\nMamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018)[]\n\nThe second film, which features two timelines- one set five years after the events of the first film and the other set twenty years before- has Stellan Skarsgård reprising his role as present-day Bill and introduces Josh Dylan as Young Bill.\n\nFlashbacks[]\n\nIn the sequel, Young Donna meets Young Bill after her affair with Young Harry, when she arrives at the harbor in Greece and misses the ferry to Kalokairi. Bill, who fancies her the moment he sees her, readily agrees to offer her a ride on his boat to Kalokairi, despite it being his few days off before a race he takes part in. His attempts to seduce Donna fail and she sees right through his womanizing ruse, as they sing \"Why Did It Have To Be Me\". Just as Bill obstinately tries to kiss Donna, they hear a voice from outside. They meet Alexio, a fisherman whose boat's engine stopped working. Bill, disappointed at his thwarted chance with Donna, dismisses him first, stating Alexio is out of danger, and that he could call for help and Alexio should wait for them. The two eventually help Alexio as he desperately races to his true love Apollonia, to keep her from getting married to a rich, ugly man. When they get to Kalokairi, Bill tells Donna he will come back in three weeks, before they bid farewell.\n\nAfter Donna discovers Young Sam is engaged and breaks up with him, her friends Rosie and Tanya come to visit her and perform at Sophia and Lazaros' tavern as the Dynamos, when Bill arrives on Kalokairi earlier than expected, saying he was worried about Donna. Young Rosie is infatuated with Bill immediately, but because he is in love with Donna she finds herself jealous when the two go on a sailing adventure.\n\nDonna and Bill dive and capture a shell. Bill opens it, and gives the pearl to Donna, stating he has \"18 ulterior motives\" to do so. The two bond over this adventure. In the evening, Donna insists to use the spare bed in the boat, which is full of objects and is uncomfortable. Accepting she can't fall asleep, she goes to talk to Bill, expressing her thanks to him making her feel better when she was sad. They eventually spend the night together and have a fling.\n\nPresent Day[]\n\nIn the present Bill and Rosie broke up because of his unfaithfulness, as told through the song Angel Eyes.\n\nBill is about to receive a honorary award in Stockholm, Sweden, and first thinks he wouldn't make it to Sophie's grand opening party of hotel Bella Donna, until his twin brother Kurt suggests he will pretend to be him and receive the award in his place, so he can be with Sophie in this important moment. Their mother Alma informs Bill about how Kurt is doing during the award ceremony.\n\nWhen Bill arrives at Greece, he finds out poor weather has cancelled the final ferry, and meets Harry who has just arrived from Tokyo. In an effort to find a solution, Harry ties himself to a chair in a restaurant, telling Bill that it will force him to find a way to get to the island. Alexio happens to be there and recognizes Bill with appreciation. He tells him about the hardships all the fishermen are going through, and Bill invites them and their families to the fabulous Bella Donna opening to cheer them up, in exchange for a boat ride, to which Alexio agrees as he owes Bill. While they exit the restaurant, they forget Harry behind. Sky appears all of a sudden and the two join Bill and the rest, singing Dancing Queen as they are all advancing towards the mainland shore.\n\nAt the party, Bill finds Rosie and initiates a conversation with her. She is reluctant and tries to brush him off, but when she discovers he can't come to terms with Donna's passing they grieve together and make up.\n\nNine months from the events of the movie, they are still together and attend Donny's christening as a couple.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nIn the original London cast of Mamma Mia! the stage musical, Bill is Australian (possibly an homage to ABBA's ongoing popularity in Australia) and his last name is Austin.\n\nIn the 2008 film as well as its sequel Bill is Swedish (an homage to ABBA and his own actor) and his last name is Anderson. He is played by Stellan Skarsgård. A young Bill appears in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again played by British actor, Josh Dylan."
