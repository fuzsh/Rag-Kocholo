        "text": "Ramesh Taurani spoke exclusively with Bollywood Hungama about his upcoming film Ishq Vishk Rebound, starring Rohit Saraf, Pashmina Roshan, Jibraan Khan and Naila Grrewal. The veteran producer also spoke about the present-day happenings in Bollywood and a lot more.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Ramesh Taurani talks about Ishq Vishk Rebound; says “We can’t charge the same amount for Pathaan as well as Munjya or Ishq Vishk” also reveals “Race 4 will DEFINITELY be made. Soldier 2’s script is being developed”\n\nThe trailer of Ishq Vishk Rebound was launched last week. What feedback have you got?\n\nWe have got great feedback. Our songs have also topped the charts. The music is an important factor for our film. Today, our fourth song dropped – ‘Gore Gore Mukhde Pe’. The previous three songs are already popular. I am hopeful of a good opening and I am positive that people would love the film.\n\nIshq Vishk Rebound’s trailer was just 2:19 minutes long. Nowadays, the trend is to have trailers of more than 3 minutes. What was the thought process behind having a shorter promo and how easy or hard is it to get the trailer right?\n\nTrailer banana bhi ek art hai. The film’s plot along with its feel, music, intensity, romance, humour etc. should come through. And the length of the trailer is secondary. It could be 2-minute-long or 2 ½ minutes long or even more than 3 minutes long. The trailer should hold you; that’s what matters. Trailer mein kuch bhi nahin daal sakte.\n\nIshq Vishk (2003) was a film for the youth but it also catered to the families. Is Ishq Vishk Rebound also on the same lines?\n\nTotally. There’s also a track of the family members of the protagonists. So, it’s a complete entertainer. At its heart, it’s a story of today’s generation and how the youth thinks about love and break-ups.\n\nAnu Malik composed the music for Ishq Vishk and its songs are famous even today. Did you ever think of approaching him for the songs of Ishq Vishk Rebound?\n\nWhen we heard the story, we thought that the film demanded fresh music. We approached Rochak Kohli and we loved the songs he made us listen to. He worked very hard on the tracks. Moreover, every story has a requirement for a certain kind of music. In our case, Rochak’s songs fit the bill.\n\nIt is rare to see a film having just one music director nowadays…\n\n99% of our films always had one music director. Pritam, for instance, was the sole composer in Merry Christmas (2024) and Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009).\n\nDuring an exclusive interview with Bollywood Hungama on Ishq Vishk’s 20th anniversary, you famously said that you made the film for Rs. 4.5 crores and spent Rs. 4 crores on promotions. Have you similarly gone out with Ishq Vishk Rebound as well?\n\nYes, we have and everyone can see. Yeh sab(the actors in the film) acche bacche hai aur inhone bahut accha kaam kiya hai. If they become big stars tomorrow, we’ll end up benefiting as we’ll make more films with them.\n\nOff late, there are talks that star fees should be reduced, looking at the state of the box office. What do you think?\n\nThose who make films need to make calculations that if they are paying X amount to a star, would they be able to recover the investment? Stars indeed quote a huge fee. But if you negotiate and if they especially like the story, director, banner etc., then a solution can be achieved. This has been my experience.\n\nNowadays, a lot of filmmakers opt for the Buy One Get One Ticket offer, also called BOGO in short. Some support it while many are against this practice. What are your thoughts?\n\nWoh theek nahin hai. But I feel that small and mid-sized films should have reduced ticket prices. The multiplexes have done a good thing by selling tickets for just Rs. 150 on Friday (in the case of Chandu Champion and Munjya on June 14). Then, you can charge normal rates in the weekend once word of mouth spreads. We need to understand we can’t charge the same amount for Pathaan as well as Munjya or Ishq Vishk Rebound. Thankfully, the multiplexes are slowly realizing that it makes good business sense to keep prices in check, once they saw a rise in footfalls.\n\nWill the tickets of Ishq Vishk Rebound be also available for Rs. 150 on the day of its release, that is, June 21?\n\nLet’s see what our distributor – Pen Marudhar – decides.\n\nWhat is the screen count that you’re looking at?\n\nIt’ll be a limited release. Even Ishq Vishk was released in the same manner. In the first week, it was released with 100 prints. In Week 2, it was increased to 125 prints. At one point, it was running with 150 prints. As for Ishq Vishk Rebound, it’ll definitely have a screen count of 700-800. It can also go higher. The Pen Marudhar team will be the better ones to take a call.\n\nIt’s also rare for a film to get a solo release. Earlier, Ishq Vishk Rebound was scheduled to release on June 28. Did you prepone by a week due to the release of Kalki 2898 AD on June 27?\n\nYes. Not just Kalki 2898 AD but even Jatt & Juliet 3 is releasing on June 27. It would have affected our film in Delhi and Punjab. Hence, I felt it is better that we have a solo release.\n\nAny plans for a premiere?\n\nWe will have a trial for the cast and crew and the industry friends.\n\nWould you like to call the original film’s star cast – Shahid Kapoor, Amrita Rao and Shenaz Treasury – for the screening?\n\nShahid is not in Mumbai. I don’t know when he’ll be back but I’ll definitely invite him. I’ll also invite Amrita, Shenaz, director Ken Ghosh and the rest of the cast.\n\nCan we expect Ishq Vishk 3?\n\n(Smiles) We’ll decide after this film is released.\n\nWhich Tips film, other than Ishq Vishk, do you feel is worthy of a franchise?\n\nRace 4 will definitely be made. And we are also going to take Soldier’s franchise ahead. Its script is being developed.\n\nAlso Read: EXCLUSIVE: Ishq Vishk Rebound is the SHORTEST Bollywood film in recent times; CBFC blurs middle finger visuals in Rohit Saraf-starrer\n\nMore Pages: Ishq Vishk Rebound Box Office Collection , Ishq Vishk Rebound Movie Review\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
