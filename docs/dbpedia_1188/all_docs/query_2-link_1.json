        "text": "\"It's amazing, Molly. The love inside, you take it with you.\"\n\nWhen Sam (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a mugger, he's left in some kind of limbo here on earth, able to witness events but unable to communicate with the living. He turns to Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), a wacky spiritual advisor, to help track down his killer and protect his distraught girlfriend, Molly (Demi Moore). Ghost is melodramatic and spiritually simplistic, but the combination of comedy, thrills, and mushy romance will be irresistible to some. While it doesn't explain why bad things happen to good people, it tries to reassure us that good people can find divine justice. Some may enjoy seeing how love can conquer all - even murder.\n\n\"Nobody knows anything, Joe. We'll take this leap, and we'll see. We'll jump, and we'll see. That's life, right?\"\n\nTom Hanks plays a man named Joe who thinks he is dying. So he is convinced to jump into a volcano on a very remote island. His work partner is played by Meg Ryan who also plays the part of the captain of the boat that is supposed to take him to the island. She plays a third part as well, a spoiled daughter of a rich man who want to send Joe to the volcano. But while she is bringing him to the island, love steps in and take over. The ending is great, so go out and rent yourself this movie\n\n\"I appreciate this whole seduction thing you've got going on here, but let me give you a tip: I'm a sure thing. \"\n\nThe love story of hooker with a heart of gold, Vivian (Julia Roberts), and a stoic, detached, wealthy business mogul, Edward (Richard Gere), who treats all facets of life like a business merger. Vivian is a charismatic, \"innocent\" prostitute looking to make ends meet. Driving along the Hollywood strip one night, Edward stops and asks Vivian for directions. She drives him back to his hotel and stays the night. Bemused by her company, Edward hires her for the week at a rate of $3,000. Predictably, their relationship develops into more than that of employer/employee. Despite its formulaic plot, the movie succeeds, due in part to the clever script and the performances of Roberts, Laura San Giacomo, and Hector Elizondo as the hotel concierge.\n\n\"I always read that you had to be OK with yourself first before you could be OK with another person. Now I feel OK with you. But I don't know how OK I was with myself before I met you, so maybe you're making me OK. \"\n\nDaniel Miller (Brooks) is a rather ordinary man who dies in a car accident one day on his birthday. Shortly thereafter, he appears in a place called Judgment City in which he learns he is to be on trial for the next four days to defend his life. While in Judgment City, Daniel meets an attractive young woman named Julia (Streep), who is also on trial. Julia seems destined to go to Heaven, since she lead an incredibly good life. The two quickly fall in love.\n\n\"That's why God made other women. Because no matter how good a woman is, just around the corner may be a better one. \"\n\nEvery good relationship has two sides. A conservative cad (Kevin Bacon) and a mild-mannered liberal (Elizabeth Perkins) are journalists whose views differ on just about everything. But when they're pitted against each other in competing newspaper columns and a hit television show, they discover they have one thing in common -- they're in love. \"He Said,\" the first half of the film presents Dan's view of their work and love life. \"She Said,\" the second half covers the same timeframe from Lorie's perspective. This is a snappy, scrappy comedy about some of the universal problems which plague romantic relationships due to different perceptions of conversation, feelings, love, work, fantasy, sex, and commitment.\n\n\"You're holding my heart.\"\n\nIn 1939, Dan McCormick (Mel Gibson), a dashing U.S. government test pilot, fears only one thing: how to propose marriage to his patient childhood sweetheart. When she's hit by a car and falls into a coma, Dan, an orphan, declares he has nothing else to live for, so he volunteers for a groundbreaking experiment in suspended animation carried out by his scientist buddy. Cut to the 1990s. Two mischievous boys living near the Army base find the warehoused, forgotten metal capsule in which McCormick is frozen. They accidentally release him, then run in terror. The disoriented Dan, finding the ID left behind by 10-year-old Nat (Elijah Wood), shows up at the boy's house. Dan ends up charming Nat's single mom, a nurse (Jamie Lee Curtis), with his old-school gentlemanly manners and bravery. But locating somebody, anybody, from Dan's remote past becomes crucial when the medical side effects of his long hibernation set in.\n\nMost of this handsomely filmed Rip Van Winkle takeoff goes predictably but entertainingly from point A to point B. Ultimately it turns out to be more a tearjerker romance than gee-whiz sci-fi, but holds the interest anyhow and works nicely for young and old viewers alike. Pacing is snappy, the actors are fun, and the attitude pleasantly old-fashioned -- you could pretty much imagine Fovever Young playing theater screens along with all the other Hollywood corn in 1939, with little censorship fuss.\n\n\"I'd like to tell you that 5 minutes after I kissed Diane she came running out into my arms and that we fell in love forever, but that's not what happened. It took six minutes. \"\n\nPaul, a nerdy biochemist who seems to not be able to relate to the modern woman, as his lack of a dating life would attest to. After much urging by his buddies, Paul consults Madame Ruth (Anne Bancroft), a medium to tell him his future in love, and seeing that he might be a lost cause if left to his own devices, she gives him a sample of something called \"Love Potion No. 8\". One taste will make him irresistible to any woman who hears his voice for up to four hours. He is skeptical at first, but after seeing it work for his cat, he decides to go in on an experiment with his geeky lady friend, Diane (Sandra Bullock), to test out just how well it works for two people who have always been unlucky in love up to that point. You know what they say about being careful what you wish for...\n\nI won't go so far out on a limb by calling Love Potion No. 9 to be a great film, but for someone into light, romantic comedies, I'd say this one is successful for some no-hassle entertainment. Although a bit early in her career, Sandra Bullock shows much of the same appeal here she would in her later, more financially successful comedies, in the first of her \"ugly duckling turns beautiful swan\" roles. Donovan and Bullock work well together, having a natural chemistry of their own.\n\nIt's cute, it's funny, and entertaining in the most modest of fashions, so if you're a fan of Bullock, or just silly romantic comedies in general, keep your expectations reasonably low and enjoy this clever and amusing diversion.\n\nDumped on the eve of their vacation-of-a-lifetime-for-two, Andrew McCarthy gets drunk and picks up dazzling blonde Kelly Preston in a bar, whisking her off to some tropical locale.\n\nWhile McCarthy acts like a jerk throughout, it's painfully obvious Helen Hunt, the beleaguered girl from the travel agent's who wouldn't refund his money in the first reel and pops up throughout doing photographs for the brochure, is his soulmate. McCarthy does his King of Pudgy Smarm routine, Preston, with her wonderfully opportunist smile, and the ever-dependable Hunt give good value.\n\nLight and humorous is probably the best way to describe it. It's the kind of movie that you can just sit down and enjoy without having to think about it, and believe me you will enjoy it.\n\n\"There are supernatural powers out there... just waiting to pull you off the tracks... and out into your worst, cruelest nightmare - the wild blue. They want you to believe that anything can happen. And they're right.\"\n\nIn a strange way, Prelude to a Kiss follows the traditional pattern of a romance: the characters meet, fall in love, are torn apart by plot complications, then find their way back to each other in the end. The difference here is that the \"plot complications\" are far from the norm (a category typically populated by ex-boyfriends/girlfriends, betrayal, jealousy, emotional withdrawal, etc.), at their wedding and old man approaches Rita and asks to kiss her as a means of congratulations. She agrees, and, when their lips meet, a transference takes place. Suddenly, Rita finds herself in the old man's body while his essence inhabits her form. When Peter and Rita head off on their Jamaican honeymoon, she is literally not the girl he fell in love with.\n\nAn obvious issue addressed by Prelude to a Kiss (and it's provocative, albeit far from original) is the unimportance of physical appearance to the notion of true love. Certainly, we are often attracted to others because of the way they act and look, but, once we get to know them, how significant are such superficial matters? Prelude to a Kiss argues both sides of the issue, and comes up with the answer we would prefer. Peter loves Rita because of who she is, not because of what she looks like. Consequently, his interaction with the old man (when Rita is in that body) shows a boundless tenderness. The film offers an ending that is satisfying, cathartic, and poignant. Prelude explores the issue of love in a way that will encourage many viewers to examine what the emotion means to them. Too few motion pictures cause us to think and feel this deeply.\n\n\"Never let her out of your sight. Never let your guard down. Never fall in love.\"\n\nFrank Farmer, a retired secret service man who is haunted by the fact that he wasn?t on duty to protect President Reagan when he was shot at. Now he works as a bodyguard for high-profile clients, and has a reputation for getting the job done. When singer and actress Rachel Marron starts receiving threatening letters, her manager hires Farmer to supervise her protection. Rachel is a difficult client that fully justifies Farmer?s preference not to work for celebrities, and his position is made more difficult because Rachel is being kept in the dark about the extent of the threat to her.\n\nSuperficial but pleasant romantic thriller that lacks substance but has a certain charm. It shouldn?t work but somehow gets away with it. Although almost everything about this film is substandard, taken together as a package it does work. somehow this became one of the most successful movies of its year and it does have a charm that is hard to explain.\n\n\"If two members of staff have to fall in love and decide to get married, there's nothing one can say. But what I do find a major irritation are those persons who are simply going from post to post looking for romance. \"\n\nAnthony Hopkins is outstanding as Mr. Stevens, the proud butler of Lord Darlington's estate, which has been known to host a variety of Britain's most important people. Most of the film is told in flashback to the years shortly before the second World War, where some important people met with German officials in order to find a peaceful solution to their troubles at any cost. Surrounding the political intrigue is the awkward relationship between the always proper Stevens and the more informal housekeeper, Miss Kenton, who likes to speak her mind, mostly to Stevens' disapproving ear.\n\nMostly, it's a study of one man's self-imposed repression, but also a country still wrapped in tradition, where doing the noble thing didn't always coincide with what was the best thing. This is the time when England had to choose between gentlemanly complacency or bold interference, contenting themselves on the maintenance of a measured outward appearance, while inside the feelings are hard to keep swallowed down.\n\nThe Remains of the Day is a quiet film, thoughtful in every detail, subtle in every feeling. It may be a film that some find slow, but for those who enjoy intelligent films or costume dramas, you'll be hard pressed to find anything to dislike in the entire production.\n\n\"It was a million tiny little things that, when you added them all up, they meant we were supposed to be together... and I knew it. I knew it the very first time I touched her. It was like coming home... only to no home I'd ever known... I was just taking her hand to help her out of a car and I knew. It was like... magic.\"\n\n8-year old Jonah Baldwin (Ross Malinger) misses his mother, who died from cancer eighteen months ago. More than that, however, he recognizes that his father, Sam (Tom Hanks), is desperately lonely. So, on Christmas Eve, Jonah calls a radio talk-show psychologist and asks for help. Forced onto the phone by his son and identified as \"Sleepless in Seattle\", Sam reluctantly (at first) opens up and talks about his love for his dead wife and the things that made her special. Across the country in Baltimore, Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) is listening to the syndicated program, and Sam's testimonial of love brings tears to her eyes. Even though she is engaged to Walter (Bill Pullman), Annie begins to wonder what it would be like to meet Sam. She even becomes one of thousands to write a letter to him. But, when circumstances make an assignation possible, the question is whether either Sam or Annie will have the courage to follow through with it.\n\nThis film is intended as a throwback to the screen romances of the past (An Affair to Remember in particular, which is cited numerous times, and borrowed from explicitly and implicitly). Anyone expecting a tale of stark modern life from Sleepless in Seattle has walked into the wrong theater. This is a dreamy, romantic fantasy whose mood falls somewhere between magic and reality.\n\n\"A toast before we go into battle. True love. In whatever shape or form it may come. May we all in our dotage be proud to say, 'I was adored once too.' \"\n\nCharles (Hugh Grant), now in his fourth decade of life, is a \"serial monogamist\" -- someone who moves from girlfriend to girlfriend without ever falling in love. His friends have started down the matrimonial road, but not Charles. Thoughts of spending the rest of his life with someone never enter his head, until one day at a wedding when he encounters Carrie (Andie MacDowell), an American fashion editor. And, although the two enjoy a brief tryst at an inn, Charles' typical British reticence kicks in, and Carrie is on her way back to America before he realizes he should have said something.\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral is about, well, four weddings and a funeral (actually, if you want to be picky, it's about three weddings, a funeral, and another wedding). While the central story of this charming motion picture is fairly common romantic comedy fare, it is framed by a plot filled with little twists and turns, lots of laughs, and a frothy, intoxicating atmosphere.\n\nThe simplest and most honest expression of praise that I can offer this film is that it represents two hours of solid movie magic. Four Weddings and a Funeral possesses the rare ability to make an audience laugh (and laugh hard) and cry, without ever seeming manipulative or going hopelessly over-the-top.\n\n\"Don't let your brain interfere with your heart.\"\n\nA movie that puts the character of Albert Einstein (Walter Matthau) into a story involving his fictitious niece Catherine (Meg Ryan), and her desire to marry a slide rule professor. Einstein has different ideas, and feels she is much more suited to an outgoing mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins) that she happens to meet after her fiance's car broke down.\n\nI.Q. is a warm and fun movie that has many humorous moments packed into a terrific performance by Matthau and the three other actors that play Einstein's mathematician buddies. All four of the \"boys\" are soon convinced that they should do anything they can to bring Catherine and Ed together, but the problem is that Catherine wants to marry an academic, not a mechanic. So, the obvious solution is to make Ed into the man Catherine wants. This requires more than genius from Einstein and his friends, as they do their best to make Ed a convincing expert on cold fusion physics.\n\nOverall, I.Q. is as unusual as Einstein: A funny movie with an intelligent script.\n\n\"I told you I'd share my ticket. I never planned on sharing my heart. Maybe I could get lucky twice today.\"\n\nIt is the story of New York City police officer who wins the lottery and splits his winnings with a waitress. Isaac Hayes narrates this fairy tale romantic comedy from talented director Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon in Vegas) and based on a true story. Married policeman Charlie Lang (Nicolas Cage) doesn't have enough money to tip waitress Yvonne (Bridget Fonda), so he offers her half of his lottery ticket if he wins. Naturally, he comes up with the $4 million jackpot and has to decide whether to honor his bargain, despite the hysteria of wife Muriel (Rosie Perez). Gentle and not too smarmy, this sentimental tale gets a bit of an edge from Perez, in a hilariously manic performance as the shrill spouse who finally loses Charlie to the kind-spirited Yvonne.\n\n\"I was born to kiss you.\"\n\nA woman throws caution to the wind in the pursuit of the man of her dreams -- whom she's never met -- in this romantic comedy. Eleven-year-old Faith (Tammy Minoff) and her cousin Kate (Jessica Hertel) are playing with a Ouiji Board when Faith asks who she will marry -- the magic oracle answers \"DAMON BRADLEY,\" and Faith is convinced that she will one day meet this ideal love. Fifteen years later, Faith (Marisa Tomei) has yet to meet her perfect man and has settled for Dwayne (John Benjamin Hickey), a sweet but boring foot doctor whom she's engaged to marry, with Kate (Bonnie Hunt) helping her plan the festivities. The day before the ceremony, Faith gets a call from one of the groom's friends, who won't be able to attend because he's travelling to Italy instead -- and his name is Damon Bradley. Convinced that fate is trying to tell her something, Faith hops on the next flight to Venice, where she searches for the elusive Damon, and along the way meets the charming Peter Wright (Robert Downey, Jr.). This was Tomei and Downey's second romantic pairing, following their roles in the biopic Chaplin. With her short hair, the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to a young Audrey Hepburn. The effect is obviously intentional, as shown by the inclusion of a scene at the \"Mouth of Truth\" that echoes Roman Holiday. Despite some underlying ideas about forging one's own destiny, this is a essentially a light, inoffensive movie that will appeal to those who aren't seeking more than a bubbly romance.\n\n\"Well, we did sleep together. I'll give you that. No, I mean, we actually slept -- sleeping slept. I haven't slept like that for a long time.\"\n\nA story of the love/hate romance between rival speechwriters in a New Mexico senatorial campaign. They are a month away from the election, and Geena Davis and Michael Keaton are competing with each other to get their candidate elected while having a romance at the same time. The two speechwriters alternate between playing tricks on each other and helping out each other in getting their candidates elected. They have a romance full of sight gags like the cliched love making scene in a much too small car. Throughout the movie, their bosses never realize who the other speechwriter is.\n\nIn many ways Speechless is a stereotypical love story, the major thing going for this love story is the fact that Keaton and Davis are writers who are on the either side of the two opposing political parties. There is nothing original about this movie from any other love story, but there is enough humour in it to keep you laughing.\n\n\"Talking between men and women never solves anything. Where we think, they feel. They are creatures of the heart.\"\n\nA soldier, Paul Sutton, has come home to the United States to his seemingly ambivalent wife and to start his new career as a lowly chocolate salesman. He runs into an unfortunate but attractive Mexican woman named Victoria, who seems quite anguished about coming home to see her father because she is pregnant, unmarried, and the father wants nothing to do with her -- all of which will bring shame to the proud, affluent family. Seeing her dilemma, Paul consents to a plan to be her husband for a day and then to leave her by morning so that the family will not be ashamed. However, as Paul meets the family, he finds reasons to stick around, especially when he begins to develop romantic feelings for Victoria, but her stubborn father will not accept him or their \"marriage\" no matter what.\n\nA throwback film to a more romantic and innocent area, and how much you enjoy this film will greatly depend on how much of a hopeless romantic you are, and you'll especially find it pleasing if you yearn for the romantic movies of yesteryear. Much of the dialogue is very hokey, almost cringe inducing, but if you accept the main premise, it seems to fit right in with the kind of trite love story that it is.\n\n\"loving someone, and being loved means so much to me. We always make fun of it and stuff. But isn't everything we do in life a way to be loved a little more?\"\n\nJesse (Ethan Hawke) meets Celine (Julie Delpy) on a train traveling through Europe. His destination is Vienna, where a flight back to America awaits him the next morning. She's on her way to Paris, where she starts classes at the Sorbonne next week. From their first moment of eye contact, they're drawn to each other. They share a meal in the lounge car, savoring the conversation more than the food, and when they arrive in Vienna, Jesse persuades Celine to disembark with him and keep him company wandering the streets until the time comes for his plane to depart. Thus begins an unforgettable screen romance.\n\nOne of the first things to notice about Before Sunrise is how completely natural it all seems. The rapport between Jesse and Celine is so lacking in artifice that at times the viewer feels like a voyeur. We are privy to everything, including the sort of \"unimportant\" dialogue that most films shy away from. Here, its inclusion is just one of many fresh elements.\n\nBefore Sunrise is about life, romance, and love. It magnifies the little things, paying scrupulous attention to the subtleties and mannerisms of body language. This film is nothing short of movie magic, and the kind of film that deserves to be remembered.\n\n\"I tried to forget you... I thought I had.\"\n\nPersuasion is my personal favorite of all Jane Austen's books. There is something about the longing of love lost long ago, lost but not forgotten, that speaks to me as none of her other works do.\n\nThe heroine of \"Persuasion,\" Anne Elliot, tossed away love at the age of 19, convinced by the sound maternal advice of her friend Lady Russell that a penniless naval officer was no match for the daughter of a baronet. The story begins eight years later, when Anne is 27 and therefore on the verge of 19th-century spinsterhood. Perfectly portrayed by Amanda Root, Anne is a plain, thin-lipped, intelligent woman who wears a perpetual look of worried resignation. The boundless possibilities she foresaw at 19 seem to have vanished, though her love for Frederick Wentworth remains.\n\nI enjoy Jane Austin best of all when it is free of the Hollywood temptation to populate her cast with handsome men and beautiful woman. Anne Elliot is attractive not because she is some buxom blonde, but because her character is intelligent, quiet, and generously caring.\n\nThough \"Persuasion\" is not the most dramatic of Austen's novels, it may be the most deeply felt. It is a lyrical, autumnal story of lost love, with the unexpected reward of a happy ending."
