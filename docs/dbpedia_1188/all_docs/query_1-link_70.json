        "text": "For 18 years, Heartbeat was the Sunday night staple that set people up for the week ahead.\n\nSet in the 1960s, it followed the lives of the residents of Aidensfield in North Yorkshire and in particular its police officers for a staggering 18 series and 372 episodes.\n\nThe hit show drew audiences of more than 13 million in its prime time Sunday night slot and was the perfect role for ex-EastEnder Nick Berry.\n\nOver the next almost two decades, characters came and went but the gentle plot lines and warm fuzzy feeling it created never faltered.\n\nIt made stars of actors including Niamh Cusack, Joe McFadden, Jason Burr and Nikki Sanderson.\n\nBut then, in 2010 Heartbeat was axed amid falling ratings, leaving both its fans and the village where it was filmed devastated as an entire tourist industry had developed in the filming locations.\n\nThere were rumours the Sunday night series would be picked up by Sky but sadly this was not the case and in 2010 the last episode aired.\n\nBut what happened to the cast who were made famous by Heartbeat?\n\nNick Berry\n\nHeartbeat was created as a vehicle for the former EastEnders heartthrob, who starred PC Nick Rowan from 1992 until 1998.\n\nAfter five years on the BBC soap and a number one single under his belt, the actor, now 60, was a fan favourite on the ITV show before going on to star as harbour master Mike Nicholls in Harbour Lights and as a police officer in the drama In Deep.\n\nBut then he quit the limelight to become a stay at home dad, aged 39.\n\nSpeaking about his decision to focus on his family, he told Mail Online in a 2011 interview: \"I chose to be a stay-at-home dad and have loved it.\n\n\"I always said that when the boys were teenagers I could go back, but the longer you don't do something the harder it is to do it, and I haven't really missed it.\"\n\nNick looked a world away from his days on Heartbeat when he was snapped grabbing a local coffee from his bakery recently.\n\nThe father-of-two cut a casual figure wearing a black NYC t.shirt, jeans, trainers and sunglasses.\n\nHe was last seen on screens when he rocked up on EastEnders in 2012 for Pat Butcher's funeral, but happily for fans, the star hasn't ruled out a return to Walford completely.\n\nAdmitting he'd \"never say never\", it looks like the door's still open for Wicksy.\n\nNiamh Cusack\n\nNiamh played Nick's wife Kate Rowan on the show, which made her a household name.\n\nShe decided to leave the show after becoming pregnant, but went on to have a stellar career in the theatre as well as starring in a number of primetime TV programmes.\n\nNiamh boasts a number of credits on her CV, including The Tower, Brassic and Death in Paradise.\n\nShe is married to actor Finbar Lynch, who she shares son Callum with.\n\nMark Jordan\n\nMark played PC Phil Bellamy from the birth of Heartbeat and was a stalwart of the Aidensfield community, reports Teesside Live.\n\nHis will they/won't they romance with barmaid Gina Ward kept viewers hooked and there wasn't a dry eye in the house when the couple finally married after she proposed while he was in hospital.\n\nBut sadly they didn't get the happy ending they deserved when PC Bellamy was killed in the line of duty.\n\nHe was involved in a confrontation with a criminal with a shotgun, who was trying to kidnap his son from his ex-wife.\n\nAs the village bobby tried to disarm him he was shot and killed.\n\nSince Mark departed the Yorkshire beat he went on to roles in Coronation Street, Hollyoaks and Casualty.\n\nMark also landed the role of Daz Spencer in Emmerdale and has directed the short film, To The Sea Again.\n\nTricia Penrose\n\nTricia was a popular barmaid at the Aidensfield Arms and was known for her straight talking, Scouse wisdom.\n\nShe had been a teenage tearaway and was sent to the sleepy village if Aidensfield to work for her uncle, George Ward, in his pub.\n\nGina quickly fitted into village life but after a series of failed romances it seems she was focusing on her career when she took over the pub from her uncle following his death.\n\nThe barmaid and PC Bellamy had always been close and she finally married him in series 16 but was left devastated when he was killed.\n\nShe debated leaving the village following his death but after finding out she was pregnant with Bellamy's baby made the decision to stay.\n\nTheir son Philip Oscar Bellamy was born in the series 17th finale.\n\nAfter Heartbeat was cancelled actress Tricia found fame in reality TV appearing on Celebrity Big Brother, Big Star's Little Star and Celebrity Pointless.\n\nNow a devoted mum, Tricia now lives in Cheshire with her family and presents a radio show on Radio Wirral.\n\nBill Maynard\n\nAn established actor, Bill had spent 40 years in showbusiness before he joined the cast of Heartbeat, starting in Carry On films and a raft of TV shows.\n\nHe played Claude Jeremiah Greengrass from 1992 to 2000 and was known by his surname.\n\nGreengrass was the village wheeler dealer and a loveable rogue who seemed to permanently find himself in sticky situations.\n\nHeartbreakingly, Bill had to leave Heartbeat because of his failing health and his exit was explained with him joining his sister on a Caribbean cruise.\n\nBill died from injuries he suffered after falling from his mobility scooter on Good Friday in 2018. He was 89.\n\nDavid Lonsdale\n\nDavid Stockwell provided the comedy relief in the village and lived with his mum.\n\nBefore long, Greengrass spotted he could easily be duped and he became his skivvy, but made his living by doing odd jobs for the residents of Aidensfield and working in the garage.\n\nDavid was overwhelmed when Gina asked him to be the godfather to her son.\n\nAfter Heartbeat ended, David has been seen in Coronation Street, Casualty and the film version of Downton Abbey. He also appeared in The Real Full Monty.\n\nPeter Benson\n\nBernie Scripps was Aidensfield's funeral director and also owned the village garage. He was a key character in Heartbeat for 15 years, leaving in 2010 when the show ended.\n\nSince the hit show was axed he has appeared in Casualty twice and has also had roles in A Touch of Frost, The Bill and Coronation Street.\n\nPeter died in September 2018 at 75.\n\nNikki Sanderson\n\nAfter finding fame as Candice in Coronation Street, Nikki swapped the cobbles for the North Yorkshire Moors as Dawn Bellamy.\n\nShe came to stay with her aunt, Gina, shortly after her uncle Phillip's death in her bid to get away from the crowd she had fallen in with in Manchester.\n\nDawn quickly became a favourite with the villagers and fans but left Heartbeat in 2009.\n\nNikki is now known for playing Maxine Minnver in Hollyoaks, where she has had a leading role since 2012.\n\nShe also appeared on tough survival show Celebrity SAS Who Dares Wins.\n\nDerek Fowlds\n\nDerek was one of the few actors who appeared in Heartbeat from its opening episode until its last.\n\nHe played Sgt Oscar Blaketon as was the steady hand leading the village police officers.\n\nHe was forced to retire from the force following a heart attack and bought the Aidensfield Arms.\n\nDerek had a long and varied acting career, appearing as Bernard Woolley in Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister.\n\nSadly, he passed away aged 82 in January 2020 following heart complications and sepsis.\n\nJason Durr\n\nFollowing the departure of PC Rowan, Aidensfield needed a new bobby on the beat and former Met officer, PC Mike Bradley was just the man for the job.\n\nHowever, the good folk of Aidensfield were not initially keen on their new police officer but he eventually won them round and seemed settled in the village.\n\nMike married local solicitor, Jackie Lambert, but their marriage fell apart when she cheated on him with a client.\n\nHe then dated the village doctor, Dr Tricia Summerbee, and was heartbroken when she was killed in a horse riding accident.\n\nHe eventually moved away from the village when he earned a place in CID.\n\nPlayed by Jason Durr, the actor played nurse David Hide in long running BBC series Casualty, but in October last year announced he was leaving after six years.\n\nWilliam Simons\n\nAs long serving Aidensfield PC Alf Ventress appeared in Heartbeat from start to finish.\n\nSince Heartbeat was cancelled, Welsh actor William appeared in Casualty, The Bill, The Royal, Coronation Street and Emmerdale. He had also previously acted in Lovejoy.\n\nSadly, William died in 2019, aged 78.\n\nJoe McFadden\n\nThe third big new addition to Aidensfield's police force, Joe played Joe Mason in Heartbeat from 2007 until 2010.\n\nCocky, he initially wasn't a hit with some of the villagers but was good at his job so soon became a community favourite.\n\nWhen the show ended, Joe went on to star in Holby City until his character was killed off in 2017.\n\nThat same year he was one of the celebrities taking part in Strictly Come Dancing and eventually went on to lift the Glitterball with Katya Jones.\n\nJoe has also starred in The Crow Road and Sex, Chips and Rock and Roll."
