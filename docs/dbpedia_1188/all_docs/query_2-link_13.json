        "text": "Geoff Bennett:\n\nYou could be forgiven for not knowing about the new blockbuster film \"Knightshade.\" That's because it's a fictional film at the center of a new novel starring, or make that written by, Tom Hanks.\n\nThis is Hanks' first novel. And, earlier this week, he talked with Jeffrey Brown in New York about it and his own love of making movies for our arts and culture series, Canvas.\n\nTom Hanks, Actor and Writer: I'm a schoolteacher.\n\nTom Hanks:\n\nAnd he said: \"You live in a pretty rarefied world that would be an interesting thing to read about. Everybody just assumes they like movies and they know how movies are made.\" He said: \"Well, and isn't that something to write about?\"\n\nAnd I said: \"You are exactly right.\" And right at that moment, the book landed in my head.\n\nTom Hanks:\n\nHad to get there. They had to be put in wardrobe. They had to be told what to do. They had to stand around and wait. They had to drive on the thing. They had to do all this stuff.\n\nAnd at the beginning of every shot, there is a moment of controlled chaos. Quiet, quiet, quiet. We're rolling, we're rolling, we're rolling. Background, and action. That has gone into every single shot in motion picture history.\n\nThe mechanics of that, to me, is as fascinating as those kind of like documentaries of how it is made. How is it made? Well, it's made very — over a long haul with very particular tasks that have to be solved.\n\nTom Hanks:\n\nA novelist, I get to do the whole shebang, and I get to get into the heads of the people and the motivations of the people and the weaknesses of the people, as well as the strengths.\n\nA lot of time, actors are given way too much credit for the end result of the movie that they are in. But, in fact, we shot that one day. I mean, we twisted ourselves in a knot in order to give unto the camera something that was ephemeral only and logical only unto ourselves.\n\nAnd then a director and a screenwriter and an editor and a whole phalanx of people ended up taking that and sometimes twisting it around just enough, moving it around, so it becomes something a little different than what you brought to it. And I could walk you through any of the movies that I have been in, in which, on the day that I shot it, I was just trying to carry an idea from one room into the next.\n\nBut in the final moment of the film, with the rest of the story, with the other performances, with the cut, with the score, it has become a much, much, much more important building block in the movie than I ever anticipated.\n\nTom Hanks:\n\nWell, I'm going to say that, in the younger days, I actually thought there was a ton of stuff that you could control or you could make happen, that you could force, manifest into it, like, I'm going to wear it like this, I'm going to say it like this, and I'm going to make this decision, and this movie will impact that movie.\n\nThe fact is, you begin at square one every time. Nothing you have done up to that point warrants anything that you can assume is going to be in the palm of your hand going into it. You can only show up on time. You can only know the text to the — and I don't mean just your own dialogue. I mean know the material that you're making."
