The film was produced by Terry Gould, directed by John Kent Harrison and written by William G. Borchert, who based the script on his 2005 novel of the same name.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1914 Lois Burnham, a college-educated woman from an affluent family, meets and falls in love with Bill Wilson, a 19 year old man of modest means. They marry in 1918 and after his return from World War I, the two set out to build a life together.\n\nWhile Lois works as a nurse Bill struggles to find his niche. Lois believes that Bill is destined for greatness and despite his increasing reliance on alcohol, she showers him with love and support.\n\nEventually, Lois persuades a friend’s husband to hire Bill at his financial firm; by 1927, Bill is working on Wall Street and the couple lives a luxurious lifestyle, but despite Lois’s valiant efforts to control his drinking, Bill’s alcoholism spirals out of control. Soon his job, their lifestyle, and their dreams are all gone.\n\nIn 1935, after years of struggling to cover for Bill and trying desperately to manage his disease by herself, Lois finally sees him get and stay sober – not through her help, but from the support of a fellow alcoholic, Dr. Bob Smith.\n\nAs Bill and Bob attain lasting sobriety and co-found Alcoholics Anonymous, Lois begins to feel neglected. Bill manages to stay sober without her help and she now feels isolated and resentful.\n\nLois soon discovers she is not alone in her isolation and anger, that there is a vast number of people whose lives and relationships have been devastated because a loved one is an alcoholic or drug addict. To help herself and others like her, she co-founds Al-Anon in 1951.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nWinona Ryder as Lois Wilson\n\nBarry Pepper as Bill Wilson\n\nJohn Bourgeois as Dr. Clark Burnham\n\nFrank Moore as Dr. Bob Smith\n\nRosemary Dunsmore as Matilda Burnham\n\nEllen Dubin as Dora\n\nAdam Greydon Reid as Ebby Thacher\n\nRick Roberts as Frank Shaw\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Love Is Not Enough: The Lois Wilson Story is the 240th presentation by Hallmark Hall of Fame, the long-running anthology program of American television films.

It was released on DVD in Hallmark stores in the United States.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on April 25, 2010, When Love is Not Enough was seen by 7.29 million viewers, according to MediaWeek. It was out performed during the same time slot by both Brothers & Sisters and Celebrity Apprentice.[2]\n\nLinda Stasi in the New York Post wrote; \"Everyone does a wonderful job in this movie -- but, in the end, it seems more like a rehash of writer William G. Borchert's 1989 'Hall of Fame' movie, My Name Is Bill W. than a real portrait of the woman whose idea helped millions of suffering families.\"[3]\n\nMathew Gilbert in The Boston Globe wrote; \"This new CBS Hallmark movie does its job effectively enough, bringing us through the ups and downs of Bill and Lois Wilson's marriage as they wrestle with his addiction.\"[4]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film has been nominated for several awards:[5]\n\nScreen Actors Guild Awards\n\nScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie - Winona Ryder\n\nSatellite Awards\n\nSatellite Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film - Barry Pepper (nomination)\n\nSatellite Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film - Winona Ryder (nomination)\n\nSatellite Award for Best Television Film - (nomination)\n\nEmmy Awards\n\nEmmy Award for Music Composition for a Miniseries, Movie, or Special - Lawrence Shragge (nomination)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
