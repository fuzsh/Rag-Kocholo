        "text": "Out of all these years I’ve done my book to movie adaptation lists these past couple years by far have been the most rollercoaster experience –for obvious reasons.\n\nThere’s always SOME change and moving of dates but these past years so many things postponed, productions halted, things moved around — from the effects of 2020 to the SAG-AFTRA strike. It was hard to keep up. But here we are: it’s time to explore all the books becoming movies & tv shows in 2024.\n\nThis list is always a working list but it’s going to be probably very fluid this year depending on how things go so I fully expect things to be moved up, moved back and every which way. There are a lot of books optioned for movies hanging in the balance right now and I will keep you up to date on those!\n\nKeep checking back because I’m sure I will have updates weekly for upcoming book to movie adaptations for 2024!\n\n(Check out posts from 2023, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2016/2017)\n\nDisclosure: This post may contain affiliate links which means that if you click on a link and purchase something I’ve talked about or recommended, I’ll receive a very small percentage of the sale.
