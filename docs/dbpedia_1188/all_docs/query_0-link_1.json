DAVID ALLEN AND SONS LTD 17. LEICESTER St. LONDON. W . BELFAST . HARROW . LIVERPOOL . GLASGOW AND DUBLIN. (Copyright Resd.) Bruce Bairnsfather CHARLES B. COCHRAN'S PRODUCTION The Better 'Ole OR THE ROMANCE OF 'OLD BILL' BY BRUCE BAIRNSFATHER AND ARTHUR ELIOT.\n\nLabel\n\nA production announcement in 'The Times' for 31st July 1917 stated. 'On the eve of the Bank Holiday Mr Charles B Cochran will produce at the Oxford Music Hall Captain Bruce Bairnsfather's play entitled 'The Better 'Ole'. It is in two acts and eight scenes all designed by Captain Bairnsfather, with musical interludes'. The review of 6th August describes the work as 'a cheery example of what the British Army calls 'swinging the lead'. Written in a trench magazine the story would excite derision, though in billets, as in the theatre, it would win laughter'. 'The Better 'Ole' played at the Oxford Theatre twice daily for over a year. After its London stay, five touring companies travelled playing it around Britain. A film of the same name was eventually produced. 'Old Bill', the cockney character illustrated here, was Bairnsfather's most famous cartoon invention. The title of the play, which Bairnsfather co-wrote, is based on Old Bill's well known quip 'If you know of a better 'ole go to it'.\n\nInscription\n\n3158\n\nInscription\n\nNEG NO: Q 80155\n\nObject Details\n\nCategory\n\nPosters\n\nRelated period\n\nFirst World War (production), First World War (content)\n\nCreator\n\nBairnsfather, Bruce (Undefined)\n\nDavid Allen and Sons Ltd, 17 Leicester Street, London, W Belfast, Harrow, Liverpool, Glasgow, Dublin (printer)\n\nOxford Theatre (publisher/sponsor)\n\nProduction date\n\n1917\n\nPlace made\n\nGreat Britain, United Kingdom\n\nMaterials\n\nSupport: paper\n\nmedium: lithograph and letterpress\n\nDimensions\n\nSupport: Height 760 mm, Width 504 mm\n\nMount: Height 763 mm, Width 509 mm\n\nCatalogue number\n\nArt.IWM PST 2733\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.

The most important of these was the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA), passed on 8 August 1914 ‘for securing public safety’.\n\nFirst World War\n\n8 Celebrity Air Aces Of The First World War\n\nAviation was one of the most romanticised elements of the First World War. 'Air aces' in particular achieved celebrity status both during and after the war and their photographs regularly appeared in newspapers. Of the eight aces listed here, seven were killed in action between 1916 and 1918 or died in flying accidents during or after the war.\n\nFirst World War\n\nWhizz Bangs And Wind-Ups: 10 Tommy Slang Terms\n\nDuring the First World War, British soldiers used language in inventive and often humorous ways. The words and phrases they used reflected everything from the dull routines of service to the traumas of front line action, often tinged with characteristic black humour and irony.\n\nShare this"
