Humans have told war stories since time immemorial, but WWI was the first global conflict to be portrayed in movies. Silent films made between 1918 and 1927 reveal what Americans (and, in Charlie Chaplin’s case, their allies) thought of WWI as it happened and in its aftermath. These films likely provided water-cooler conversation for Alma Clarke and her coworkers, the way that contemporary Americans debate Scandal or Game of Thrones.

Cinema, fiction magazines, and comic books displaced older forms of entertainment like the dime novel in the early twentieth century. Of these new diversions, films were unique because they gave Americans detailed, tangible fantasies. Movies also provided shrewd businessmen with a new product. By the 1910s, the film industry had robust centers in New York and Hollywood, churning out romances, serial adventures, Westerns, and more. Silent acting combined vaudeville, pantomime, and the larger-than-life style typical of theatre in this period. Even though films lacked sound, actors did do some sound work during WWI — exhorting people in public speeches to buy war bonds.

Hollywood churned out propaganda films, as well. The propaganda pictures initially supported neutrality in WWI, but as the public switched its support from neutrality to involvement, Hollywood adjusted its approach to the war.

Actor-director Charlie Chaplin had made a short war bonds film, titled simply The Bond, but his longer follow-up, 1918’s Shoulder Arms, proved to be his wartime masterpiece.

Released two months before the armistice, Shoulder Arms takes Chaplin’s Little Tramp to Europe. Writing nearly fifty years later in his Autobiography, Chaplin recalled: “Why not make a comedy about the war? I told several friends of my intention, but they shook their heads. Said [Cecil B.] De Mille: ‘It’s dangerous at this time to make fun of the war.’ Dangerous or not, the idea excited me.” Chaplin’s film turns trench warfare into escapism. To be sure, Chaplin includes iconic elements of trench life, such as flooding, bad food, constant bombings, and loneliness. However, any moment of tension leads to humor or triumph. No one dies. The Tramp even gets to enjoy a wonderful daydream in which he captures the Kaiser. Great propaganda as well as a sublime comedy, Shoulder Arms became “a smash hit,” although Chaplin biographer Kenneth S. Lynn considers it more clichéd than ingenious today. The New York Times observed at the time, “There have been learned discussions as to whether Chaplin’s comedy is low or high, artistic or crude, but no one can deny that when he impersonates a screen fool[,] he is funny.”

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is not a comedy, but rather a melodrama, although several scenes are so over-the-top that they are unintentionally funny today. The film began as Vicente Blasco Ibañez’s 1919 novel, which Philadelphia’s Catholic archdiocese panned:

The horrors of war are depicted with a realism that is so graphic as to be gruesome. Throughout the story there are unpardonable lapses into vulgarity and coarseness. In this respect the [book] … is perhaps less guilty than the author’s other novels. But this is not to say that either it or they are to be put in the hands of the indiscriminate reader. All in all, the book is one that is best avoided…

Nonetheless, both the novel and its 1921 film adaptation were enormous hits. The film of Horsemen turns WWI into a canvas for escapist romance. A French-Argentinian playboy (Rudolph Valentino), who dishonors his family with an adulterous pre-war romance, “only redeems himself by dying as a hero in World War I.” The destiny of the hero’s extended patrician family unfolds like propaganda: The French branch sacrifices and struggles to preserve old-world civilization, while their German cousins become unquestioning soldiers in the service of the Kaiser. Subtlety is not one of the film’s virtues, and Horsemen’s style trumps its questionable historical substance. Yet the film develops a peculiar power near the end, as Valentino goes to his death, his lover chooses to return to her husband, and Valentino’s father weeps over his son’s grave, amid thousands of identical crosses. Valentino became a matinee idol thanks to his good looks and his spellbinding tango scene, which helped to publicize Latin dance in the United States.

1925’s The Big Parade incorporates melodrama, but director King Vidor also highlighted the war’s brutality. Unlike Horsemen, which focused on elite officers and their families, Parade portrays the experiences of ordinary enlisted soldiers. The film is also ambivalent about the need for the war, as the climactic battle achieves nothing of apparent strategic value. To quote Vidor, “When a nation or a people go to war, the people go and do not ask why. But in this last war they asked one question at all times. It was, ‘Why do we have war?’” Audiences pondered that question in droves — The Big Parade outgrossed Horsemen.

1927’s Wings, a romantic drama about WWI fighter pilots, received the first Best Picture Oscar. It is a film of enormous scale. The U.S. Army loaned the filmmakers real planes, empty land on a San Antonio military base (promptly transformed into wartime France), and over 3,000 real soldiers. Director William Wellman had been a WWI pilot, so he used his combat knowledge to coordinate the spectacular dogfight sequences. All of the actors flew in real planes. When seen today, Wings has the broad humor and sweet love story typical of an old Hollywood movie, but the film is remarkable for the authenticity of its battle scenes.

The centennial of WWI has sparked renewed interest in the conflict, leading to new dramas like Testament of Youth and Parade’s End. As good as these projects are, they lack the grit of silent films. The silent filmmakers often had to invent their production technologies as they went along; the roughshod nature of silent films is part of their charm. When the special effects work well, especially in Wings, the visuals are even more astonishing than modern films because everything is real. Silent films also have more thematic variety than the wholly serious WWI films that have premiered of late. Whether as propaganda, comedy, or drama, silent films preserve raw perceptions of the Great War.
