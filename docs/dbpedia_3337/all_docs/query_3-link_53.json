        "text": "S.S. Lazio is an Italian football club based in Formello, Rome. The name Lazio was chosen by the original founders in 1900. They wanted a name that included more than just the city they were based.\n\nLazio is a region of Italy near the centre of the country, and encompasses a vast area to encourage the land to cheer on the Formello based team.\n\nBasic Facts\n\nS.S. Lazio’s full name is Società Sportiva Lazio which translates to Sport Society Lazio.\n\nThey have spent most of their history in the top tier of Italian Football, and have been Italian Champions twice; the first time in 1974, and the second in 2000.\n\nThey have also won the Coppa Italia 7 times, the Supercoppa Italiana 3 times, the UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup and the UEFA Super Cup.\n\nHere is a quick list of other basic facts:\n\nFull Name: Società Sportiva Lazio S.p.A.\n\nNickname(s):\n\nI Biancocelesti (The White and Sky Blues)\n\nLe Aquile (The Eagles)\n\nAquilotti (Eaglets)\n\nFounded: 9 January 1900; 121 years ago, as Società Podistica Lazio\n\nGround: Stadio Olimpico\n\nCapacity: 70,634\n\nOwner: Claudio Lotito (66.70%)\n\nChairman: Claudio Lotito\n\nHead Coach: Maurizio Sarri\n\nLeague: Serie A\n\nWebsite: Club Website\n\nHome Grounds\n\nLazio’s home ground is Stadio Olimpico and it is the largest sporting facility in Rome. It seats over 70,000 spectators on blue chairs which match the team’s colors.\n\nThe stadium is owned by the Italian National Olympic Committee, but that doesn’t mean there is a track course or other non-football-related structures on the pitch. Stadio Olimpico is primarily used for football.\n\nHowever, there is one exception to this rule. Music concerts are also held in this massive arena. When Claudio Baglioni had a concert in June 1998, his fans broke the record for attendance, with a whopping 100,000 spectators attending. That record is still held today.\n\nOne of the biggest uses of the stadium is for the Coppa Italia final. Every year Stadio Olimpico will host the final fight, no matter which teams are the last ones standing.\n\nMain Trophies\n\nIn total, Società Sportiva Lazio have won 6 different trophies.\n\nThe Italian Championship was won twice by Lazio in the 1973 – 1974 season and again in the 1999 – 2000 season.\n\nThe Italian Cup was won by Lazio 7 times and is their most repeated win. They succeeded in the 1957 – 1958 season, 1997 – 1998 season, 1999 – 2000 season, 2003 – 2004 season, 2008 – 2009 season, 2012 – 2013 season, and the 2018 – 2019 season.\n\nThe second most repeated win for Società Sportiva Lazio is the Italian Super Cup. They won this tournament 5 times; in the 1998 – 1999 season, 2000 – 2001 season, 2009 – 2010 season, 2017 – 2018 season, and the 2019 – 2020 season.\n\nThe last three trophies that S.S. Lazio have not been repeated. In fact, they haven’t been touched since 2000. These cups are the Italian Serie B won in the 1968 – 1969 season, the Cup Winners Cup from the 1998 – 1999 season, and the UEFA Super Cup won in the 1999 – 2000 season.\n\nClub History\n\nS.S Lazio was founded on the 9th of January 1900. They choose to make the team colors white and sky blue as a nod of respect towards Greece for being the homeland of the Olympics.\n\nBefore football was brought in, Società Sportiva Lazio focused more on canoeing, swimming, and running. Football was an encouraged afterthought.\n\nIn 1980, Lazio was relegated to the second division due to the Totonero Scandal. “Totonero” is an Italian term for betting illegally on football matches.\n\nIf football players, coaches, or other connected parties bet on a game, then they may sway the game in order to win money, thereby creating a fixed match.\n\nThe same issue occurred in 1986 where Lazio, along with other clubs, faced point deductions for the so-called Totenero 1986. Lazio was almost degraded to the third division for their involvement.\n\nClub Timeline\n\nChampions League Record\n\nClub Net Worth\n\nS.S Lazio’s current total market value is £308.66m. That translates to US$426.17m and €362.05m\n\nThis was accurate in August 2021 with a squad size of 39, their average age of 27.2, and their current transfer record as £-5.13m. That translates to €-6.02m and US$-7.08m.\n\nStadium\n\nStadio Olimpico is a UEFA Category 4 stadium. This means that it can be used for playoffs, qualifying stages, main competitions and can host the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Europa conference League, the UEFA Nations League UEFA European Championship‘s final tournament.\n\nBasically, it is allowed to host and be used for most (if not all) UEFA-related games and tryouts.\n\nStadio Olimpico has undergone several renovations in its history. In 1927 engineer Angelo Frisa and architect Enrico Del Debbio added in plans to construct masonry stands instead of grassed terraces.\n\nIn 1937, a second tier of stairs was started but wasn’t continued due to World War 2’s intense demand for strong workers.\n\nStadio Olimpico has had many stops and starts when it comes to construction and renovation. Its last restyling was in 2008, and so far, this version of the Stadio Olimpico has stuck.\n\nOwners\n\nClaudio Lotio is the current owner of S.S. Lazio and has been since 2004. Lotio was banned from football for two and a half years, starting in July 2006. This was because of his part in the Totonero Scandal (illegal football betting). The scandal was uncovered in May 2006.\n\nPhone calls were intercepted and showed that team managers, owners, and referee organizations attempted to sway or fix a game by using “favored” referees.\n\nNot long after, Lotio was banned for 10 months due to a third-party ownership issue. This sentence was reduced to 2 months after an appeal.\n\nBest Players\n\nLazio’s three top players are Milinkovic Savic Sergej, Ciro Immobile, and Francesco Acerbi.\n\nMilinkovic Savic Sergej is S.S. Lazio’s best player. He is the 2nd best at Free Kicks in Serie A. He is the 3rd best for Aerial Duels in Serie A. He is the 3rd best for assists outside the box in Serie A. Lastly, he is the 4th best player in Serie A for assists in general.\n\nCiro Immobile is just as impressive. He has had 57 Big Chances to score in Serie A, making him the 2nd best player in this regard throughout the tournament.\n\nOf the 57 Big Chances, he has made 51 shots on target, giving him the title of second-best in Serie A. And he has scored 20 goals, making him the fourth-best player in Serie A for this category.\n\nFrancesco Acerbi is also one to look out for. He is the second-best player in Serie A when it comes to pass interceptions on his own half, having made a whopping 221 passes.\n\nLooking at pass interceptions in general, Acerbi is also in second place for Serie A with another high number of 243.\n\nThe numbers dip a little here, but they are still impressive as Acerbi is the 5th best player in Serie A for tackles on his own half, having made 107. For tackles in total, Acerbi is the 11th best player with a not-too-shabby 131.\n\nAll Time Top Scorer\n\nLazio’s all time top scorer was Silvio Piola, netting 149 goals in his time.\n\nPiola is an absolute giant in Italian football because of his outstanding scoring ability. Piola won the 1938 Fifa World Cup with Italy by scoring two goals in the final. These two earned him the title of best player and the second-highest scorer in that tournament.\n\nPiola holds the record for the third all-time best goalscorer in Italy’s national team. In total, across all teams he has played in, Piola has scored 290 goals.\n\nPiola was so well loved that when he passed away, two Italian stadiums were renamed after him; Stadio Silvio Piola in Novara and Stadio Silvio Piola in Vercelli.\n\nCaptain\n\nLazio’s team captain is Ciro Immobile, who has a mountain of trophies and awards under his name.\n\nImmobile has been named the top scorer 6 times:\n\nFirst in the 2009 – 2010 Viareggio Cup for netting 5 goals.\n\nSecond in the 2011 – 2012 Serie B for netting 28 goals\n\nThird in the 2013 – 2014 Serie A for netting 22 goals.\n\nFourth in the 2017 – 2018 Europa League for netting 8 goals.\n\nFifth in 2017 – 2018 again, but this time for his Serie A 29 goals.\n\nAnd his sixth top scorer title was given in the 2019 – 2020 Serie A for netting 36 Goals.\n\nCiro Immobile was part of the S.S Lazio team, which won two Italian Super Cups, the first in the 2017 – 2018 season, the second in the 2019 – 2020 season.\n\nHe was also part of the Juventus Primavera team, which won two Viareggio trophies, the first in the 2008 – 2009 series and the second in the 2009 – 2010 series.\n\nHere is a list of Immobile’s other accomplishments:\n\nBest Player of the Competition – 2020 – Serie A\n\nPlayer of the Year – 2011 to 2012 – Team Delfino Pescara 1936\n\nEuropean Championship – 2021 – Team Italy\n\nItalian Cup Winner – 2018 to 2019 – Team S.S.

They are Simone Palombi, Cedric Gondo, Alessandro Rossi, Raul Moro, Ciro Immobile (Team Captain), Felipe Anderson, Felipe Salvador Caicedo Corozo, Vedat Muriqi and Jonathan Rodriguez Menendez.\n\nManagers\n\nLazio’s current manager is Maurizio Sarri. Sarri hasn’t played football professionally, but he was an amateur center back and a coach while he worked as a banker.\n\nIn 2005 Sarri took on his first Serie B job with Pescara. He didn’t really make a name for himself until 2014 where his team Empoli was promoted to Serie A.\n\nOnce Sarri confirmed that he could reach Serie A and keep his team in Serie A, he was sought after and hired by Napoli.\n\nSarri then won several individual awards for managing Naples-based clubs. He then moved to manage the famous English club Chelsea and won the UEFA Europa League during his only season with them.\n\nCoach\n\nMaurizio Sarri is Lazio’s head coach. He was appointed in June 2021, and his contract expires in August 2023. His previous club was Juventus FC.\n\nAssistant Coach\n\nLazio’s assistant coach is Giovanni Martusciello. He was appointed in June 2021, and his contract expires in August 2023. His previous club was Juventus FC.\n\nLazio has two goalkeeping coaches; Adalberto Grigioni and Massimo Nenci.

There are light air stripes that are unnoticeable when moving around.\n\nAway Kit\n\nLazio’s away jersey is mostly white.

These colors represent Greece and the origins of the Olympics.\n\nThe second shield is white but has the name “S.S.Lazio” written in blue.
