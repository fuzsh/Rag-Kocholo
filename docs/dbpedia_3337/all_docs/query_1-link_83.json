        "text": "If God is with you, no one can be against you…\n\nNigeria defeated Spain 3-1 in yesterday’s semi final match of the 13th FIFA Under-17 World Cup, but the two goals from My People Academy’s forward, Sani Emmanuel were all that the Golden Eaglets needed to book a place in the final.\n\nEmmanuel, who has been an altar boy at The Synagogue Church of All Nations for many years, wrecked the U-17 team of Spain. His goals came after Stanley Okoro’s first goal while Borjan scored Spain’s only goal.\n\nThe youngster electrified the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere, Lagos immediately he was introduced into the match. He was a thorn in the flesh of the Spaniards with his blistering runs and ball control, which earned him two goals in the match, watched by a capacity crowd.\n\nEmmanuel, who was introduced into the match in the 48th minute began to do damage to their opponents barely 13 minutes later. He scored a brace to take his goal haul in the competition to five, making him a joint top scorer with two other players from Uruguay and Spain.\n\nThe player, who was literally raised in the Synagogue, owned by Prophet T.B Joshua, has been described as the hottest super-sub of the ongoing competition.\n\nEaglets coach, John Obuh says Emmanuel has been very instrumental to his team’s success at the Nigeria 2009 World Cup. “Emmanuel has become my joker and he’s playing to instruction,” Obuh said.\n\nApart from the praises he has received from his people back in Ikotun, it was a carnival-like atmosphere as the worshipers celebrated the performance of one of their own till late yesterday. An elated Joshua, said: “I’m happy for Emmanuel. When I noticed he’ll be a great footballer, I sent him to Sweden and registered him in my academy, My People F.C. So, I’m glad he’s making progress and the young boy will go places.”\n\nObuh has assured that his wards would be ready for their final match against Switzerland at the Abuja Stadium on Sunday.\n\nObuh, the former Kwara United coach said he was impressed with his team’s performance and disclosed that he would make some changes in the team to be battle-ready for Sunday’s clash.\n\n“I’m really delighted that my players rose to the occasion; they played to instructions and I’m happy that we would play in the finals. It is a good thing that though we started slowly, we were able to put back smiles on the faces of Nigerians.”\n\nOn his expectations and what he knows about the European newcomers, Obuh says he knows little about them. But he believes with the right attitude and approach to the match, his team would retain the trophy in Nigeria.\n\nHe added that he is aware the Swiss are a very mobile side, but will get a strong team to beat them.\n\n“I know them as a team that have qualified for the final. By the time we meet in Abuja on Sunday, we would get the better of them and win again for Nigeria.”"
