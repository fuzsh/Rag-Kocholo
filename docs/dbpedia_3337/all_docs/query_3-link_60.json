        "text": "Luigi Ziroli\n\nZiroli played for Alba and subsequently Alba Audace, one of the three sides that later merged to give life to AS Roma. He holds the honour of scoring the Giallorossi’s first ever goal in the top division of Italian football as he found the net in the 58th minute of Roma’s 2-0 win over Livorno on 25 September 1927. In 1928, he signed for Venezia, before returning to the capital with Lazio a year later and going on to score 13 goals in 59 games with the club. He was the first former Roma player to represent the Biancocelesti.\n\nAttilio Ferraris\n\nBorn in Rome’s Rione Borgo, Ferraris began his career at Fortitudo, earning himself his maiden call-up to the Italian national team in 1926. Ferraris was made the first captain of AS Roma on the club’s formation in 1927, becoming the enduring symbol of Roma’s Campo Testaccio era. The unthinkable happened in 1934, when he switched allegiances to Lazio after a disagreement with Giallorossi president Renato Sacerdoti. Ferraris spent two seasons with the Biancocelesti, yet after a spell with Bari returned to Roma in 1938, bringing his record up to 231 appearances and three goals for the club.\n\nCarlo Galli\n\nCarlo Galli joined Roma for the 1951-52 season, still the club’s only sojourn into Serie B. Also arriving in Trigoria that year was coach Gipo Viani, who swiftly restored the Giallorossi to the top tier as Serie B champions, with Galli the side’s top scorer on 13 goals. Nicknamed Golden Head for his fearsome aerial ability, Galli remained with the Giallorossi until 1956, before going on to win two Scudetti with AC Milan. After spells at Udinese and Genoa, Galli ended his career with three seasons at Lazio between 1963 and 1966, though his performances for the Biancocelesti never quite lived up to his time across the city at Roma.\n\nArne Selmosson\n\nThe Swedish striker is the only player in history to have scored in the Rome derby for both Lazio and Roma. Selmosson joined the Biancocelesti in 1955, spending three seasons with the club and scoring twice against the Giallorossi. Yet on finding themselves in dire economic straits in 1958, Lazio were forced to sell him to the highest bidder: Roma. The Biancocelesti fans took the news badly and even filled the streets to voice their anger, but the deal went through nonetheless. Selmosson went on to score three goals against his former club in the Giallorossi jersey.\n\nFranco Cordova\n\nItalian midfielder Franco Cordova joined Roma in 1967, spending nine seasons with the Giallorossi and even wearing the captain’s armband from the 1972-73 season onwards. At the end of the 1975-76 season, Roma president Gaetano Anzalone decided to sell him to Verona, but Cordova refused the move and instead controversially agreed to join Lazio. After 212 appearances and nine goals for the Giallorossi, Cordova spent three seasons at Lazio, racking up two goals in 85 appearances.\n\nLionello Manfredonia\n\nThe case of Manfredonia is perhaps the most controversial of all players who have gone on to wear the Giallorossi colours having previously played for their cross-town rivals. A Lazio fan, he grew up in the Biancocelesti youth academy before representing the first team between 1975 and 1985, though he missed two years after receiving a ban for his involvement in the 1980 football betting scandal. Manfredonia spent two seasons at Juventus after leaving Lazio, before joining Roma in 1987, a move that created deep chasms within the Giallorossi faithful.\n\nAngelo Peruzzi\n\nOne of the best Italian goalkeepers of all time, Angelo Peruzzi cut his footballing teeth in the Roma youth academy before making his first-team debut in 1987 at the age of 17 against AC Milan at San Siro, coming on for Franco Tancredi after the senior goalie was hit by a flare. After a year-long loan at Verona, Peruzzi began the 1990-91 season as the first-choice Roma ‘keeper, but was banned after just three rounds of matches for failing a doping test. In 1991 he signed for Juventus, where he remained until 1999. Peruzzi then spent a season at Inter, before spending seven years at Lazio, where he hung up his boots in 2007.\n\nRoberto Muzzi\n\nMuzzi grew up in the Roma youth academy before making his first-team debut during the 1989-90 season. The following year, Muzzi bagged three Serie A goals, and in the 1992-93 season he scored in the 2-0 Coppa Italia semi-final first-leg defeat of AC Milan, which put an end to the 11-month unbeaten run AC Milan had put together under Fabio Capello. In 1994, Muzzi signed for Cagliari, before joining Udinese in 1999 for a successful spell with the Friulian outfit. Muzzi would return to the capital in 2003 for a two-year stint at Lazio.\n\nSinisa Mihajlovic\n\nMihajlovic joined Roma in 1992-93, a year after he won the European Cup with Red Star Belgrade. The Serb would spend two seasons at the Giallorossi under the stewardship of first Vujadin Boskov and then Carlo Mazzone, though never managed to secure a starting spot in central defence, where he would go on to play the best football of his career. Mihajlovic made 69 appearances for Roma, scoring seven goals, before moving to Sampdoria in 1994 and spending four seasons in Liguria. He then signed for Lazio, becoming a stalwart of the Biancocelesti side during his six-year stay with the club and attracting particular dislike from the Roma faithful.\n\nDiego Fuser\n\nAfter starting his career with stints at Torino, AC Milan and Fiorentina, Fuser played for Lazio between 1992 and 1998, during which time he became the captain of the club. After 188 appearances for the Biancocelesti, he spent two seasons at Parma before joining newly crowned Scudetto champions Roma in the summer of 2001. His time with the Giallorossi is remembered for two key goals scored in consecutive Serie A matches, the first against Venezia at the Olimpico and the second away at Parma the following week. In total, Fuser made 15 appearances for Roma between 2001 and 2003."
