        "text": "SS Lazio are getting tired of waiting for Manchester United and Mason Greenwood to make a decision on whether to accept their offer for the player.\n\nThe Red Devils are keen to move on the talented forward, who became a political and ethical hot potato at Old Trafford following a high-profile arrest for violent and abusive behaviour in January 2022.\n\nLazio tried to get him on loan last season but the deal fell through at the last minute and Greenwood ended up at Getafe in Spain, where he was voted Player of the Season.\n\nThe Rome club are now trying for the permanent move and have offered €22 million plus 50% of any future sale. They have also promised to increase their bid to €25 million.\n\nHowever, this still falls short of the reported €30 miilion offered and accepted by Olympique de Marseille, a deal that appears to have been held up by public outcry, led by the mayor of the city, about the player’s arrival.\n\nTo complicate matters further, SSC Napoli have entered the race at the 11th hour and are also reportedly willing to offer €30 million, but with an inferior sell-on clause to that of Lazio. Roma have also been credited with an interest.\n\nAccording to this morning’s paper edition of Corriere dello Sport, Lazio’s president Claudio Lotito “let it be known that they will wait a few more days and not indefinitely, fed up with the indecision of the Englishman and his father, tired of United’s games as they do everything they can to auction off Greenwood’s contract.”\n\nThe outlet believes that “Greenwood didn’t say yes to Marseille and [their manager, Roberto] De Zerbi,” and that Napoli have not formalised their interest, giving them hope that their offer, despite being the lowest, is the most solid.\n\n“Lotito is ready to pay and close,” CdS continues.\n\n“It’s a race made up of overtaking and counter-overtaking, of pushing and tripping, of teasing. Greenwood and United have been ready to decide for days, first by Friday, now by tomorrow.”\n\nThe president already seemed to have accepted defeat last week when he claimed that he had another player on his shortlist that was “ten times better” than the United man, but it seems that was bluff and bluster.\n\nNow, “the club has asked the forward to make a decision quickly”.\n\nWhether Greenwood will be put off by these immature antics remains to be seen. If he doesn’t go to Lazio, they will turn to other options, one of which is reported to be a player United recently released, Anthony Martial. More on that story to come shortly."
