        "text": "New York City Football Club (NYCFC) today announced that it has sold Forward ValentÃ­n âTatyâ Castellanos to Italian side S.S. Lazio. Castellanos leaves NYCFC for a Club record transfer fee and one of the highest in Major League Soccer history. NYCFC will also receive a sell-on percentage if he is sold in the future.\n\nThe Argentine Forward left NYCFC on loan to fellow City Football Group (CFG) club and LaLiga outfit Girona FC in July 2022, where he compiled 14 goals and one assist in 37 appearances. Castellanosâ time will be most remembered for his incredible four goals against Real Madrid in a LaLiga game, becoming the first player to score four goals against Real Madrid in a single league match in over 75 years.Â\n\nSporting Director David Lee said: âEveryone at the Club is extremely proud of Taty for earning this move to S.S. Lazio and continuing to show what a special player he is. After a fantastic season in LaLiga with Girona FC last year, Taty will again have the opportunity to play in one of the best leagues in the world while also competing in the Champions League next season.\n\nâItâs an incredible story and weâre delighted to have played a part in his development. From the moment Taty arrived in New York, his quality, dedication and professionalism were apparent, and it is little surprise that he will continue his career progression at the highest levels in Europe. It also continues to show that NYCFC and City Football Group is a fantastic environment for players to improve and develop.Â Â\n\nâTaty is a legend here at NYCFC and willÂ be especially remembered for his feats in 2021, winning the Golden Boot and helping the Club win its first MLS Cup. We all wish Taty the best and are excited to follow his journey in Italy.â\n\nCastellanos played an integral part in NYCFC winning its first ever MLS Cup championship in 2021. The Forward won the 2021 MLS Golden Boot, scoring 19 goals during the regular season and three goals during NYCFCâs 2021 MLS Cup Playoffs run, including one in the MLS Cup final.\n\nForward ValentÃ­n âTatyâ Castellanos said: âIâd like to sincerely thank everyone at NYCFC and City Football Group for always looking after me so well and for making this move possible. Itâs like being part of a family. Iâd also like to thank the fans who have always believed in me and supported me every single game.\n\nâI will always be an NYCFC fan. The Club and the amazing people there have played such an important role in my career and my life. It has always been a dream of mine to play in Europe and in the Champions League and I couldnât be more excited.â\n\nThe Mendoza, Argentina native joined NYCFC on loan in 2018 from CFG club Montevideo City Torque, scoring in his debut match against Vancouver Whitecaps FC. Following his successful loan stint, the Club made his transfer permanent in November of that year. Castellanos scored 53 goals and recorded 19 assists across 116 MLS regular season and MLS Cup Playoffs appearances for the Club.Â\n\nCastellanos is only the second player in NYCFC history to score 50+ goals for the Club. He also became the only player in franchiseÂ history to score four goals in a single game during the Clubâs 6-0 win against Real Salt Lake in 2022.Â\n\nEveryone at NYCFC wishes Taty good luck in this exciting next step in his career.Â"
