        "text": "+ 10,000 worshippers flock his service\n\n– Spent N3.2 billion on less privileged in 3 years\n\nAgainst all odds, Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua’s profile keeps rising internationally as he took over United Kingdom as the black man with the highest number of congregation in recent times and reportedly spent about $20 million on philanthropy within three years.\n\nInformation available to ENCOMIUM Weekly revealed that he achieved this when he started his Anointing water revival at the Troxy Theatre in East London on Sunday, November 10, 2013. According to our source, an estimated 10,000 worshippers thronged the venue. Some came with their travelling cases having just arrived from various countries by plane; some came with blankets to withstand the cold, while some stood with cups of coffee in the queue. As 8am approached, the line extended for over a kilometre round the streets of The Troxy.\n\nAt 10am, the doors of The Troxy opened and the crowd swarmed in, thanking God that their encounter with Jesus was just a moment away!\n\nPeople travelled from Switzerland, Sweden, Germany, France, Belgium, United Arab Emirates, India, Romania, Slovakia, Canada, Austria, Brunei, Australia and Holland and from all over the United Kingdom just for the event.\n\nENCOMIUM Weekly’s check revealed that the success of the revival gave birth to an international branch of the ministry as thousands flocked the venue every Sunday to watch the live telecast of the clergy where he ministered messages and prayers. Afterwards, the evangelists in the congregation administered the popular anointing water on them.\n\nWe even gathered that the success of the Troxy Theatre led to another revival at New Bingley Hall, Birmingham with over 2000 worshippers.\n\nInterestingly, we learnt that Prophet T.B Joshua does not attend these services in person but that the members watched it via live transmission on Emmanuel Television. Our source even told us that another one has been slated to commence at the University of West London, Brentford on Sunday, March 2,2014.\n\n“In fact, Prophet T.B Joshua has taken over from Pastor Matthew Ashimolowo as the black man with the highest number of congregation in U.K. Since Pastor Ashimolowo relocated to Nigeria controversially, no other Nigerian has held UK spell-bound like prophet is doing in recent times.”\n\n52 year old Temitope Balogun Joshua (born June 12, 1963 in Arigidi, Ondo State, Nigeria). Commonly referred to as T. B. Joshua, he is a Christian minister, televangelist and faith healer. He is leader and founder of the The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN), which runs a Christian television station called Emmanuel TV, available on satellite and on the Internet via the Streaming Faith Broadcast portal.\n\nHe is also a notable humanitarian, providing aid to minorities and the underprivileged on national and international scale via Another Ministry. He has had various accolades, notably receiving the National Honour of OFR by the Nigerian government in 2008. He is recognised as one of Africa’s 50 most influential people.\n\nJoshua is known for his popularity across Africa and his online presence, with over 850,000 fans on Facebook and hundreds of YouTube videos which have proved controversial and amassed thousands of views.\n\nAccording to Joshua’s official biography, unusual circumstances surrounded his birth. It is claimed he spent 15 months in his mother’s womb and narrowly avoided death after a quarry explosion near his house sent rocks through its roof just seven days after his birth.\n\nJoshua attended St. Stephen’s Anglican Primary School, Arigidi-Akoko, Nigeria, between 1971 and 1977 but failed to complete one year of secondary school education.\n\nIn 1989, T. B. Joshua fasted and prayed for 40 days and 40 nights. He wrote that in a heavenly vision, he had received divine anointing and a covenant from God to start his ministry. Following this, Joshua founded the The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN) with only a handful of members. More than 30,000 members now attend its weekly Sunday service; visitors from outside Nigeria are lodged in the accommodation blocks constructed at the church\n\nAnother ministry is the humanitarian arm of SCOAN. It caters to the needs of widows, the elderly, physically challenged, orphans and the destitute. The church provides scholarships to orphans and children of the underprivileged, with educational support from primary to tertiary levels. His scholarship sponsorship’s have included more than 5000 Nigerian and foreign students, with one Nigerian student doing a PhD in Oxford University. Nigerian media reported the total amount as £100,000.\n\nThere is also a rehabilitation programme for armed robbers, prostitutes, political thugs and militants from Nigeria’s volatile Niger Delta region.\n\nJoshua is well known in Nigeria for reconciling broken families and marriages. SCOAN has established various NGOs in other countries, including the Passion for Needy in Ghana. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Joshua sent a team of medical personnel and humanitarian workers to the affected area, establishing a field hospital called Clinique Emmanuel.\n\nA Forbes blogger estimated that Joshua has spent $20 million on humanitarian activities in the last three years. In recognition of his humanitarian activities, he was awarded a National Honour by the Nigerian government in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, T. B. Joshua started a football club, My People FC, as part of efforts to help the youth. Two members of the team played for Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets in the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Sani Emmanuel, who apparently lived in The SCOAN for several years, was Nigeria’s top-scorer and the tournament’s MVP. Emmanuel and his colleague Ogenyi Onazi have now signed professional contracts with SS Lazio, Onazi recently debuting and scoring for the Nigerian senior team, the Super Eagles. Following the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Delhi, India, T. B. Joshua rewarded the efforts of the Nigerian team, presenting the physically challenged medalists with cash gifts and cars."
