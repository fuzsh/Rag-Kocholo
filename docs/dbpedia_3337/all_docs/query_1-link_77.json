        "text": "An article in today’s ‘Nation’ newspaper concerning Sani Emmanuel’s desire to improve the lives of less-privileged youths…\n\nGolden ball winner of the recently concluded FIFA U-17 World Cup Sani Emmanuel, has disclosed a desire to float a foundation that will enable him give hope to the hopeless and identify talented youths among the needy.\n\nThe Delta born striker who was the toast of many during the keenly contested World cup where Nigeria finished second behind debutants Switzerland, said recalling what he went through in life before he was given a lifeline by Pastor TB Joshua, made it imperative for him to equally float a foundation that will provide same opportunity for those passing through the same rough road in the society.\n\nDont forget that I was once a needy. I mean, I know what it is to be poor. I dedicate these awards to all the needy. I am going to start a foundation where scholarships will be given to the deserving ones and every proper means will be used to discover the talented just as I was discovered by my father in the lord, TB Joshua,” he said during a thanksgiving ceremony held Sunday at the Synagouge Church of All Nations . The service which saw Emmanuel and some of his teammates including midfielder Onazi Ogenyi and goalkeeper Dami Paul cut two giant cakes on behalf of themselves and impressive U-17 team had former President of Zambia Fredrick Chiluba, and former PMAN President Tee Mac among other dignitaries in attendance.\n\nBy Julius Okorie\n\nSOURCE: The Nation\n\nExplore posts in the same categories: Articles Of Interest\n\nThis entry was posted on November 24, 2009 at 10:55 pm and is filed under Articles Of Interest.
