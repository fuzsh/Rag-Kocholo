The first team squad and staff will have access to Firstbeat’s comprehensive physiological analytics and the Firstbeat Sports app and Sensor to help optimize player performance and recovery as they compete domestically and in the UEFA Champions League.\n\nOn the partnership continuation, SS Lazio’s Performance Coach Alessandro Fonte said:\n\n“We decided to continue to use Firstbeat Sports because it allows us to monitor training load and recovery on the same platform. This enables us to provide the right training load for each player based on their true readiness and recovery status.\n\nAdditionally, we have been impressed with the range of new features introduced over the last year, such as Heart Rate Recovery and Real-Time Lap Management, and hope to incorporate these more into our training sessions moving forward.”\n\nFirstbeat Sports is used by over 1,000 elite teams and over 23,000 athletes globally, including teams across major soccer leagues. In addition to 25% of Serie A teams, Firstbeat is utilized by 40% of Premier League teams and more than 30% of UEFA Champions League teams.\n\nMatteo Viazzo, Firstbeat Sports Key Account Manager in Italy, said:\n\n“I’m delighted that Lazio and its staff have chosen to continue using Firstbeat Sports to monitor the training load and the recovery of their players. We pride ourselves on working with the world’s best teams and Lazio belongs in this category. This partnership shows their commitment to optimizing performance and we’re excited to play our part in helping them reach their goals for upcoming seasons.”\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about using Firstbeat with your team – you can contact us here.\n\nAbout Firstbeat: Firstbeat provides advanced performance analytics for over 1,000 sports teams around the world.
