        "text": "Welcome to Società Sportiva Lazio\n\nSocietà Sportiva Lazio,\n\ncommonly referred to as S.S.Lazio or simply Lazio. An Italian football club who play in the Serie A. The club was founded on the 9th January 1900 and are based in Rome.\n\nThe club's colours have led to their Italian nickname of biancocelesti. (white and blue).\n\nIn their 108 year history Lazio have won the serie A twice first in 1973-74 and more recently 1999-00 season. Lazio have also won the Coppa Italia four times. They have also been succesful on the European stage winning the Uefa Cup Winners Cup and Uefa cup both in 1999.\n\nThey play there home games at the 73,000 seater Stadio Olympico of which they share with their fierce rivals Roma.\n\nRivalries\n\nThe Derby della Capitale, known in English speaking countries as the Rome derby is a match between Lazio and their main rivals Roma; it is amongst the most heated and emotional footballing rivalries in the world. A Lazio fan, Vincenzo Paparelli was killed at one of the derby games during the 1979–80 season after being hit in the eye by a flare thrown by a Roma fan. Lazio also have a strong rivalry with Napoli\n\nThe 1990's- Their Most Succesful Decade\n\nThe arrival of Sergio Cragnotti, in 1992, changed the club's history forever as he was prepared to invest long term in new players for the club in order to make the team a competitor on the Serie A level. Cragnotti repeatedly broke transfer records in pursuit of players who were considered major stars - Juan Sebastian Veron for £18million, ChristianVieri for £19million and breaking the world transfer record, albeit only for a matter of weeks, to sign Hernan Crespo from Parma for £35million.\n\nFrom 94-97 Lazio had top four finishes, also finishing 2nd once. In 2000 they completed the double winning the Serie A and Coppa Italia with the legendary swedish manager Sven Goran Eriksson in charge from 97-01.\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned one, Lazio had two other Coppa Italia triumphs in recent years, in 1998 and 2004. Lazio also won the last ever UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1999 and reached the UEFA Cup final in 1998, but lost 0-3 against a Ronaldo-inspired Inter Milan. Lazio won the Italian Super Cup twice and defeated Manchester United in 1999 to win the European Super Cup. Lazio was also the first Italian football club to be quoted on the Italian Piazza Affari stock market.\n\nThe 2000's dropping back to Earth\n\nLazio began the decade brightly by winning the Italian Super Cup and finishing in 3rd place in the league - but the departure of Sven Goran Eriksson accelerated the decline of the club. With money running out, or wasted on transfer flops like Gaizka Mendieta for £28million, Lazio missed the all-important qualification for the UEFA Champions League in the 2001–02 season, finishing in a disappointing sixth place. A financial scandal also forced owner Cragnotti out leaving the club in a dire state.\n\nHowever in the 2005–2006 season under the coaching of Delio Rossi saw the club compete beyond all expectations with a team which blends remaining veterans such as Angelo Peruzzi and midfield fan favourites Fabio Liverani and Ousmane Dabo with an infusion of motivated players with lower salary demands. The policy proved to be successful as the club qualified for the 2006–07 UEFA Cup\n\nLazio finished a dissapointing 12th position in Serie A last season and are far too big a club to be out of the top 5 or 6.\n\nNow and Onwards\n\nLazio a club who have been succesful on the domestic front and the European front need your help. With past greats such as Crespo, Di canio, Nedved and Nesta, Fabrizio Ravenelli, Gascoigne (of course). Can you take them back to the glory days on the 1990's.\n\nClub Information\n\nName: S.S.Lazio\n\nStatus: Professional\n\nReputation: Continental\n\nLegends: Giuseppe Signori\n\nFavoured Personnel: Veron\n\nClub Icons: Dino Zoff, Diego Simeone, Nestam Peruzzi, Di Canio, Rocchi\n\nFierce Rivalries: Chievo, Atalanta, Bologna, Brescia, Pescara, Messina, Roma, Livorno\n\nOther Rivalries: Napoli, AC Milan, Juventus, Fiorentina, Ternana, Perugia, Palermo, Reggina, Torino, Vicenza, Sambenedettese, Foggia, Taranto\n\nFinances: OK\n\nTransfer Budget: 3.6mil (mid table)\n\nMedia Prediction: 11th\n\nFirst Team\n\nGk- Carrizo, Muslera, Berni\n\nDL- Kolarov, Radu\n\nDR- Lorenzo De Silvestri, Lichtensteiner\n\nDC- Rozenhal, Siviglia, Cribari, Radu\n\nMC-Dabo, Ledesma, Matuzalem, Brocchi, Mutarelli\n\nAMC- Mauri, Pandev\n\nAMR- Foggia, Meghni, Zarate\n\nAML- Del Nero, Foggia\n\nST- Rocchi, Pandev, Makinwa, Zarate\n\nKey Players\n\nGoran Pandev\n\nRocchi\n\nKolarov\n\nDe Silvestri\n\nYoungsters to watch\n\nFaraoni- potential to be a good player\n\nRadu - Potential to be a good player\n\nDe Silvestri - Potential to be a quality player\n\nCampoli - got potential to be a good player\n\nTuia - got potential to be a good player\n\nDistinct lack of good youth this needs looking at.\n\nSquad Analysis (im going to do this without referring to a formation)\n\nGoalkeepers: Lazio are pretty much sorted in this position Carrizo will be your main goalkeeper, and Muslera is as good a backup as you can get on a small budget not much point pumping your money into this, however you may want to look for a young goalkeeper to come in for the future maybe Fiorillo (Sampdoria) or Sergio Asenjo both turn out quality.\n\nRight Backs: Lorenzo De Silvestri will keep you sorted in this area for years to come, hes only 20 and therefore should be at the club for at least a decade. And with Lichtensteiner as backup you are sorted in this area.\n\nLeft Backs: Kolarov is quality here and is only 21/22 so he like De Silvestri will be at the club for years to come. Only problem is theres no real backup here Radu can act as backup but he's a centre back up potential so maybe you might want to look at a loan here just to cover Kolarov.\n\nCentre Backs: A weak point of the team especially when Rozenhal is your best defender. Rozenhal will be solid so you can keep him here, Cribari is decent at best but i don't rate him in the slightest, and Siviglia will decline rapidly and he isn't that good at the start anyway, Radu should be a future star here. Thus i advise looking at a centre back, i got Julien Escude in as he can play left back as well. Another could be Goian. Filter out Centre backs and see who comes up for your budget.\n\nRight Wingers: Foggia has been good for me this season alot better than his stats suggest and with Meghni as back up here you don't really need to look at this position yet however could be looked at for the future if you get more money in. David Santon could be looked at for the future.\n\nLeft Wingers: Del Nero has been pretty good for me though he's very hit and miss so a replacement could be looked at. Foggia can play at this side also as back up and it seems that Goran Pandev can be retrained over here but i wouldn't reccomend it. I'd look at a better player for this side.\n\nCentre Midfielders: Dabo has performed brilliantly for me in a defnsive role, Ledesma has good stats and can perform well, and Matuzalem on loan is a very good passer and creator. Mauri is a good attacking playe and can create chances though i havn't player him due to my formation having two defensively minded players, though i don't doubt he could do a very good job. Brocchi and Mutarelli provide good backup. This area can be improved but for the minute it's one of the better areas.\n\nForwards: Pandev and Rocchi are your best forwards as Rocchi will or at least should score goals and Pandev should create and chip in with a couple. Mauro Zarate is great backup on loan however with the agreed price being at 11+ million i dvise not buying him unless he performs insanely well for you. Rocchi is injured at the start and Makinwa is poor, look at getting a goalscorer in for example Palermo from Boca, a good finisher and great in the air.\n\nConclusion: Centre Back, Winger either side and A Striker are priorities and a centre midfielder for the future.\n\nRight then finally got to January of the first season and i think im doing very well to be honest, alot better than i expected though im trying not to get my hopes up.\n\nThe first transfer window i set mid-table finish and only got 3.6million transfer budget however i managed to bring in 2 quality players as back up and rotation.\n\nFirst i identified the weaknesses to the squad and decided there was sufficient strength in depth in the midfield and full back areas and up front was good if lacking a physical presence.\n\nThus in came the signings of Julien Escude for 950k and Martin Palermo for 2.5 million.\n\nAnd out went Manfredini and Beleri for a combined 875k. I wanted to sell a few more however nobody wanted anyone for the amounts i was asking so kept them all as backup.\n\nHad a very good start to the season, going 6 games unbeaten before being thrashed by Inter 4-1, which brought us back down to Earth, from there our form fluctuated and we found it difficult to score more than one a game yet also conceeded one or two a game also so we fluctuated from 11th to 6th. This inconsistency called for a change from my usual 4-2-3-1 and i brought about an attacking 4-3-3 with 3 centre mids and 3 strikers with a wide formation and the left centre striker dropping into AMC postition, now heres where the fun started i went on an 8 game unbeaten run including wins away against Juventus and at home against Roma.\n\nSo come January the 11th i find myself 4th 5 points behind Juventus and Inter and 11 points of AC Milan, however i am level on points with 5th placed Roma.\n\nMost of my players are now wanted by big clubs and looking to move on, so it looks like im going to be searching for replacements soon.\n\n(Anybody else playing a lazio save feel free to post your progress here, any advice, tips on tactics players just ask here myself and the rest of the forum members will be more than happy to help).\n\nSS Lazio is my fav team and i played them in every version of the game since cm italia 95.\n\nhere is an story about my first seson\n\nmy playstyle\n\ntactic : make my own 4-4-2 or an 4-3-3 like they played in old the mid 90s\n\ndatabase : large\n\nselected leauges : france,germany,spain.brazil,argentina,greece,turkey,holland,portugal,italy\n\nhelp programs : none (scout all my players on my own and use good player forum sometimes)\n\ngames : watch all games in 3d on extended or kye, ( takes forever but very entertaining)\n\ntransfer policy : very agressive\n\ntransfers summer 2008: i needed an striker fast couse rocchi was out. DA BOMBER Cardozo joined for 5 m£ and delivered us 23 goals in 38 games\n\nlewandowsky was brought in as replacer/sub, santon as future right winger\n\nopare and aquino as long term projects\n\ni loaned in rat and song wich got a huge number of games and p,layed realy good\n\ni sold of the junk in the team and cut my wages, i also sold foggia for 2,5m£ mainly couse i needed cash, altough this left my stripped of my right wing and forced 17y santon to play 20 games from start this seson\n\nhttp://img360.imageshack.us/img360/512/transfers2009pe0.jpg\n\nmy team looked mainly like this first half of the seson\n\ncarizzo\n\ndl rat\n\ndc rozenthal\n\ndc radu\n\ndr silvestre\n\nml kolarov (retrained) (pandev)\n\nmc ledesma\n\nmc mauri/meghni/song\n\nmr zarate (santon)\n\nstr pandev (lewandowski)\n\nstr cardozo\n\nmataruzalem,lichtensteiner,aquino where mainly used as subs\n\nthe team started pretty good\n\nfirst 11 leauge games we played won7 draw2 loss2 then the problems started with alot of the first team unfit or injured, zarate played bad and had huge problems to make anything on the pitch, santon got the chanse and played very good for beeing an 17 y old with 10 in most stats\n\n-early december a couple of french clubs wants ledemsma and i put a 20m£ tag on him, second offer from lyon are 8,5£ and my chairmen loves it and accept it over my head. I go ballistic couse i like him and wanna make my team around him.\n\n-when januari comes ledesma leaves and i am desperate to get a new midfielder. i had target the supertalents in belgium witsel and defour as targets. They had a pricetag of 15m£ and lazio had to give up.\n\nmy chairmen once again went over my haed and accepted an 8m£ offer for team cap rocchi He was offered out to all clubs in europe for 10m£. Inter finaly got him for 9m£.\n\nWe then decided the loaned player from arsenal Song should play insteed and put ledesmas money on future players and in come saivet for 4,5m£ ,de maria 6,25m£ and paloschi 2,1m£\n\nThe team played fairly well but we had problems gelling and finding the right settings for the defence. Nealry all matches agaisnt : fiorentina,Inter,Milan,Juventus where lost. and the 2 important derbys agaisnt roma to.\n\nhttp://img101.imageshack.us/img101/2111/romavlaziozq6.jpg\n\nWe where 1-1 untill 68 min. then roma scores 3 on us and we had 2 sent of in the battle.\n\nThe final table looked like this\n\nhttp://img179.imageshack.us/img179/4150/tabell2009kz0.jpg\n\na 6th place was not bad for us, eurocup games next year and board was happy\n\ngood players 2008/2009\n\n3 players played all games, de silvestre, carrizzo, radu\n\nPandev 35 games : 17 goals,6A, 7,36 AVGR , made many important first goals with counters totaly solo, played 10 games as a left winger\n\nKolarov my left defender7winger 6G,6A,7,26 AVGR gave me a good offensive on the left flank\n\nRadu beginning of seson he was a whimpy centreback and transformed to a stable top back, increased 3-4points in all defensive attributes\n\ncardozo won seria A golden boot, made 22G in 38 games. called the bomber . have rockets he fire from long ditance and are strong as a bull\n\n2nd is awesome man, that belgian looks nice. try sign witsel and tutor him he have nice rounded skills\n\nroma won champions leauge one time in my game and milan one time. they have bought many nice players and i see those to as dominators in the leauge atm. inter and juve are very good to. i consider myself as 5th team now. in squad strenght i am 4-5th but in economy i am at top 5th\n\nmy economy is growing now. i got my self an american franshise club as partner so now i got 2 of them. china and usa. my merchandise have increased from 200-250k £ a month in sellings to 950k-1,4m£. just that increase will give me 10m£ more to use as wages or transfer sums each year.\n\nmy strategy now is to buy the best young players i can find. The other italian topteams have to good squads for me to challange about title so i will build a powerhouse longterm way.\n\nmy team still have same important players beggining of seson 3 kolarov,pandev,carizzzo,cordozo,radu.12 of my 26 first team players are 20 years or younger.\n\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/907/sslazio3fp1.png\n\ni wanted to strenghten up my centre midfield again this year and board gave me 10,5 m £ got a uefa cup place. i wanted witsel,veloso on that spot. witsel they wanted 18 m for and veloso vent to chealsea for 29m. so i am still stuck with same squad year 3 as year 2. i bought a young macedonean friend to pandev from hes natinal team that is a future star dmc i think. transfers year 3 was for regens and young player only and a 3rd backup keeper on loan from argentina.\n\nhow much is pandev scoring for u? whut are hes settings and whut settings do u use on partner Progrebnyak?\n\ni am angry they sold ledesma over my head couse very hard find an replacer and 8,5£ is jokemoney on transfermarket in my game. i need 15m£ at least to get an national midfielder with good stats.\n\nRoma won CL? Don't make me laugh ;-) Well at least that 1 girl is going to strip ;-)\n\nYou have quite a competent team imo... How do you request a feeder club for franchise purposes, because when I ask a feeder team, I always get teams in France, Spain, Germany and stuff;-)\n\nMocko666: How much did you pay for Fellaini? His acceleration is a bit low imo.\n\n€ 25M for pandev is imo peanuts as in my game (not even at the end of season 1 he is worth €18M)\n\nCurrently I am 4th in serie A but there is 3 point gap between 1 & 5 and between 1 and 6 is 6 points, afterwards the gap is much bigger. So I guess I will make it to europe this year (9 games to go).\n\nPandev scored a lot for me in serie A (18 atm, but hasn't scored for me lately:s)\n\nPogrebnyak (despite not talking Italian and stuff;-)) scored 15 in Serie A, Lazio also became one of his favorite teams :-)\n\nDepending on the opposition 1 is target man with run onto ball/To feet (Pandev) or To head (Pogrebnyak).\n\nI trained Pandev so he would go round the keeper. Would like him to train to beat offside trap too.\n\nAlso I lost Rocchi, was a shame, but the board accepted it also :s In my game he went to Chelski. (But the money was good though, €15M) With this money I bought Pogrebnyak for € 7.5M (in stead of agreed price of 8.5M)\n\nAnd also de goalie from Viola in a CO-ownership (the italian wonder kid who is being tutored now by carizzo)\n\nSo at the moment I only have 2 viable strikers, so if one gets injured, I'm ****ed. Zarate is not that goo imo\n\nIf it is indeed impossible to replace Ledesma (what in fact is true for 8.5M then I would, just like you, buy forestieri or someone like him and let him play every game hoping he improves dramaticaly on a very short term. (Like D. Santon).\n\nThat's why I try to get 7* training asap\n\nPS:\n\nBut I will have to go on the lookout for 1 MCd (young and talented as Ledesma has this spot (Pirlo like)) and Brocchi is going to retire soon being 33.\n\n1 MCa as MAuri can't cope with my expectations (and Foristieri, who will come at the end of this season) is the young talented sub for him.\n\n2 Strikers (I would love to Have Cardozo or Pazzani and another pacey striker like pandev).\n\nA new DL is propably also a requirement as Rat his loan is going to end.\n\nAnd a 16y old Wonder GK so I have 3 GK and can sell Muslera :-)\n\nPreferably all Italian, if not possible EU players (not EU passport) :-)\n\nI think I will send all my scouts out again :-)\n\nvery nice. only 2 points from winner. you have hot goalscorers 46 goals on 2 strikers is alot in fm2009. they must have played almost every game?. it will be little harder next seson when u gotta fight 2 front war in champions leauge to. harder to play them all matches so gotta have good backup players.\n\nall top 8 finishing spots gets same tv money in italy exept for the winner that gets double. the champions leuage play will give u about 20 mill£ totaly if u get to the 1/8 final\n\nupdate\n\ntransfers http://img511.imageshack.us/img511/1403/sslaziopu9.png\n\nwith upcoming talent in the midle of the field i was lacking class wingers. very few left footed fast wingers where avaible and i was forced to spend 12,5m£ on dos Santos hes been exellent so far and adapted very fast. balotelli was avaible after beeing unhappy in inter. a 20 year old italian wonderkid with national team experience was to much for me so i had to bid for him. de maria,santon,foriesteri,fiorello was sold to buy the 2 above. i only got 5,75m£ for transfer of board this year.\n\nmy transfer tactic now is to buy 1-2 ready to play players each year where i am lacking talent and cover and for the rest of the money buy regens to use as homegrown players and sellbase for profit later on.\n\ni am now in december 2011. i am playing in champions leauge couse i finished 3rd last year\n\nchamp leauge table http://img505.imageshack.us/img505/9166/europeanchampionscupzd2.png\n\nleauge table http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/81/serieajv0.png\n\nsquad http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/1356/sslazio2dh9.png\n\nnote on my core\n\ncarizzo super keeper, saves games for me . exellent teacher for my young keepers in u20 to tutor\n\npandev my best player. if he is in team i dont loose games. makes loads of assists\n\nde silvestre rotation defender. my best defensive RB. always play against the other big teams\n\nradu core player. makes defensive lock with sakho. have a good attitude and good morale during matches. very seldom radu makes mistakes. sakho make way more\n\nkolarov rotation DL and ML. have had problems with injuries but have been voted fans player of the year. assists on many goals with crosses to cardozos head. always a force on the leftflank\n\npresentation of my 2 unknown players . both regens and future Lazio players till they retire if they devolp to star players\n\naugusto http://img530.imageshack.us/img530/8481/20augustorx9.png\n\nmy creative mc. have had problems on this role since ledesma left me 3 years ago. made debut in brazil national team before he played for lazio A team.\n\nbought from parana for 925k£ 2010. scored a goal agaisnt roma in hes leauge debut.\n\ntom morvan http://img133.imageshack.us/img133/3056/30tommorvan2fk0.png\n\ndefensive midfielder very good defensive stats and good mental also. rated 7 star by my 20/20 scout. if he improve psycical attributes a littlehe will be my first choise dmc. bought for 4,8m£ from le mans 2009.\n\nmy u20 team ranked my ASM with stats 19/17\n\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/9407/sslazio3fw7.png\n\n2-3 of the 5-6 star players will prolly make it to my first team\n\n3-4 of the 3-4 star players will mayby make it to my first team. adamek is a Green hulk of 194cm pure muscles that run fast as hell. he needs alot more skills before serie A play.\n\nPreseason of 2nd season:\n\nWhen enquiring about Rossi I get him offered for € 14.75M (just within budget).\n\nI think a dream come true, getting him so cheap... But all of a sudden all the clubs seem to offer for him... So he went to the only team I did not want him to go... Inter (as they are already strong enough)\n\nTo have an even better position on the transfer market I offloaded some more players...\n\nMuslera (Bought some cheaper sub to replace him), Mauri (Torino as Rosina went to Real Madrid), Fuentes (too good of an offer to refuse), Makinwa, Inzaghi (free), Zauri, Scaloni, Cribari (Stendardo is the substitute defender now)(All 3 to Catania, damn they where nice to me, total amount of €10.5M:D) & some youngsters for between 100K and 1.2M\n\nThe players that are new to Lazio:\n\n-= Begin bought with the money from Rocchi sale =-\n\nPogrebnyak € 7.5 (was on loan and bought him for less than the agreed price).\n\nLewandowski €1.5 + % of profit (Sub for Pogrebnyak)\n\nForestieri € 1.7 + % of profit of next sale (Replacement of Mauri, Sub of Ledesma)\n\nSome young wonderkids who are immediatly loaned out (Regens)\n\n-= End bought with the money from Rocchi sale =-\n\nSaivet € 10.5 + % of profit next sale (Sub for Pandev)\n\nFabian Carini @140K (2nd keeper, replacement of Muslera)\n\nAnd now, the 2 big shots:\n\nMiguel Veloso € 10 + 25 over 24 months + % of profit of next sale (Was trying after Rossi got refused but was always refused untill Man C & Chelsea showed me how much I had to offer, so I went over their offer and he decided to sign with me)\n\nOn loan, after redeemed surplus @ Man City Gelson Fernandes (Speaks Italian, so no lanuage barrier either).\n\nThis makes me believe: \"I am ready for the CL and Serie A!\" (Coppa Italia is of no concern to me)\n\n-----------------Carrizo-----------------\n\nDe Silvertre-Rozenhal---Radu-----Kolarov\n\nSanton---Ledesma---Fernandes---Foggia\n\n-------Pogrebnyak------Pandev---------\n\n-----------------Carini-----------------\n\nLichtensteiner-Stendardo-???-----Bonetto\n\nLjungberg---Forestieri---Veloso---Del Nero\n\n------Lewandowski------Saivet---------\n\nI also Have Brocchi, Becker and some other as back up.\n\nRest of the money I gave out to complete my 7* training\n\nAgreed with the board to improve training & youth facilities.\n\n3 feeder clubs already (German 2nd league, French 2nd league & Duth Premier league)\n\nNow waiting to ask for even more\n\nIn CL I should be able to reach next Round as I am seeded with Man Utd (ouch) Zenit & steau bucharest(with radoi;)). (I was seeded 4th)\n\nMy transfer policy is also, sign few but the best (that are willing to come) or great future stars:D.\n\nEdit: Milan bought for € 121M new players... Unk????\n\n***Update***\n\nBeat Inter (away) for the first time and how, I accidently put Stendardo as DL, so swapped him with Radu (to not lose a substitution).\n\n90+1 minute he scores the 1-2 on a corner becoming MoM and all :-)\n\nSerie A:\n\nI am 2nd in the league 2 draws (Napoli en Sampdoria), 4 wins (Inter, Atalanta, Torino, Catania)\n\nSo its a good start.\n\nChampions league:\n\n2 wins (Steau (A), Zenit (H)). Up to the double confrontation with Man Utd (But the week is bad, Udinese, Fio, ManU, Brescia, Roma, ManU, ...)\n\nI am happy I don't have much injured players (none at the moment) and still I have to rotate a lot.\n\nI have a little question to ask:\n\nIt is march in my game, and I get Fazio offered for € 12M (Bargain).\n\nI make the offer and he decides to sign with me.\n\nHowever, I only have € 3M remaining transfer budget and the board refuses to give me more.\n\nIs there something else I can do to sign him? I delayed the transfer for 1 week, but I won't be ale to keep this doing.\n\nKennec:\n\nCL poule was ManU,zenit&Steau Bucharest. As ManU drew Zenit and I only lost from ManU away I was 1st in my CL group.\n\nArsenal finished 2nd in their group and instead of Bordeaux (or some weaker team like that) I get Arsenal (Almost impossible to reach next round but I bet my stadium will be sold out;)).\n\nBTW: I defeated Arsenal away (0-2) playing counter football, not pretty but effective. Pandev & Kolarov (FK).\n\nIn competition I remain 2nd (2pts behind) due to a 1-2 loss against Napoli. I was angry\n\nPa-Po are scoring a lot again, they seem realy compatible... 15 - 14 goals in competition and we are about 20 games far.\n\n*Update*\n\nCL: Arsenal is defeated but with a LOT of luck\n\n21' 71' Pandev scores (His value is already € 36M:D)\n\n30' Touré receives a 2nd yellow card for stopping Pogrebnyak going 1on1 with the GK.\n\n45 + 1 & 90 + 1 Arsenal scores.\n\nLucky me they where only 10 (and still where able to draw me). So I proceed with the necessary luck but Pogrebnyak is in a slump, he appeared at least 4 times alone against the GK but didn't score. Hist last 3 matches he has avg rating of 5 :s\n\nPut I keep playing him hoping he will revive\n\nInter also bought Inler (from Udinese for 30M)\n\nNext season I will try to unsettle Balotelli and Rossi as they both DON'T play at Inter. Balotelli is reserve squad and Rossi only played 2 games + 4 subs."
