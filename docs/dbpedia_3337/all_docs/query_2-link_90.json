        "text": "Talented Lazio teenager Sana Fernandes is reportedly on the verge of completing a transfer to Dutch side NAC Breda. The Biancocelesti poached the winger from Sporting Lisbon in the summer of 2022, and he immediately cemented himself as arguably the most exciting talent in the club’s Primavera squad.\n\nHowever, the Portuguese has been hoping for more space within the first team, and has recently posted a controversial post on social media, apparently voicing his frustration with his current status at the club. Nevertheless, it appears that the two parties have now managed to sort out the situation.\n\nAccording to La Lazio Siamo Noi, Fernandes will complete a loan switch to NAC Breda where he will have the chance to prove himself in the Dutch top-flight. This will be the teenager’s first experience at the senior level.\n\nThe source reveals that this will only be a dry loan, so the 18-year-old will certainly return to Lazio at the end of the season. The teenager will be hoping to show off his skills in the Eredivisie in order to carve himself an important role at the Italian capital side in the following campaign. Fernandes’ contract with the Biancocelesti is valid until June 2028."
