        "text": "for the fan base in rome, what factors determine if they will be a lazio fan or roma fan considering they're from the same city and play in the same stadium. i've heard that lazio fans are from a more upscale part of the city, while the roma base is more inner city. is that true?\n\nLazio used to be middle class, and Roma working class, but I think nowadays it's also that Lazio' fans are 'blind on their right eye', while Roma is fairly center politically.\n\nC;mon.. man. when it comes to football there is not working or middle class..all are same and now the money making becomes pretty easy than what we expect..so..I don;t feel much difference between the fans.\n\nerr... we're talking about the economic state of the club's fans, not the club's players.\n\nroma fans, at least their ultras groups, are not that centre anymore according to \"the real football factories\" documentary.\n\nWhile Lazio has problematic fans, I do like to see them high up the table since Miro Klose, one of my favourite players, moved there.\n\nNot that I'd go beyond a casual interest. With Calciopoli and all, I'm not too keen on Italian football.\n\ndid you forget about the match fixing and bribery in the bundesliga recently?\n\nThat was not in the Bundesliga. It occurred in lower divisions.\n\nBut the failings of an individual referee (and a few players) are one thing. Several clubs being the instigator of match-fixing is an infinitely bigger issue.\n\nThere's no comparison.\n\nwell there was a syndicate in germany responsible for fixing matches in the german 2nd division, the german cup, 9 other european leagues, a number of EL and CL qualification games. uefa said it's the biggest match fixing scandal they've ever seen. but somehow the bundesliga is not affected??? anyways this isn't about corruption in soccer. it was just an honest question about roma and lazio."
