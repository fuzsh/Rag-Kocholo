        "text": "Early career\n\nBorn in Edo, Emmanuel started his playing career in his native Nigeria for My People FC, a Nigerian football Academy based in the Nigerian capital of Lagos and which was run by the Synagogue Church of Nations. In 2009 Emmanuel joined Swedish club Bodens BK where he stayed for only a few months as FIFA rules stated that he had to be 18 years old to make an international transfer. Then in 2010, after his award-winning performance at the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup, it was reported that Emmanuel had trials at both Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur of the English Premier League. While at Tottenham Emmanuel was even offered an extended stay. However, in 2011, after trialing at several clubs in Europe, Emmanuel signed for Italian Serie A side S.S. Lazio where he was immediately put into their Primavera side. Then in 2012 it was announced that Emmanuel had signed for U.S. Salernitana 1919 of the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione on a co-owned basis from Lazio and on 9 September 2012 Emmanuel made his only appearance for the 4th tier Italian side against Chiete Calcio in which he came on in the 58th minute for Christian Chirieletti as Salernitana suffered a 4–1 defeat that day.\n\nFC Biel-Bienne (loan)\n\nThen on 16 February 2013 it was announced that Emmanuel had signed with Swiss Challenge League side FC Biel-Bienne on loan for the rest of the season. Emmanuel then made his debut for the club on 16 March 2013 against Wohlen in which he came on in the 72nd minute for Ramon Egli as Biel-Bienne lost the match 1–0.\n\nOn 12 May 2013 Emmanuel scored his first professional goals in a league match against FC Wohlen in which he scored a hat-trick to lead Biel-Bienne to a 7–0 victory. He then scored two more goals for Biel-Bienne on 30 May 2013 against FC Winterthur as the club 2–2.\n\nBeitar Jerusalem\n\nIn October 2014 Sani signed with Beitar Jerusalem. 3 weeks later, after playing only 24 minutes for the club, Sani was released by Beitar Jerusalem, with the club stating that the coach is not excited by Sani and that he does not feature in future plans.\n\nAfter leaving Beitar Jerusalem, Emmanuel had a trial at Bosnian side, FK Sarajevo, but failed in his attempt."
