        "text": "Nigerian cum Australian boxer King Davidson revealed to UK Newspaper, ‘The Daily Echo’ that Prophet T.B. Joshua was the inspiration behind his WBO International light middleweight victory on Saturday 30th June against Ghanaian fighter Joseph Lamptey, and had predicted in the early stages of his career that he would become a world champion.\n\nAccording to the report titled ‘Nigerian Prophet T.B. Joshua Predicted King Davidson's WBO World Title Win’, “Joshua has backed Davidson, both financially and spiritually, and called the Southampton-based fighter moments before he entered the ring to defeat Joseph Lamptey and win the WBO title.”\n\nDavidson said: “He called me five minutes before my fight and said, ‘Be very careful of your opponent; he will try and hit you in the stomach.’ He then asked me what I would do if someone tries to fight like that. I told him ‘to put up a good guard and keep out of reach.’ He then said ‘You’ve got the key, now just do it. I know you will win.’ It inspired me to go out and win. I want to thank him so much for following me throughout my career; everything he has said about me has come to pass.”\n\nIt took Davidson less than 15 minutes to gain the title, after knocking out Lamptey in the final stages of the second round. Davidson, who is a Commonwealth Games bronze medallist and tipped as a real contender for the WBO world title, said that Joshua, whose activities are followed by millions across Africa on Emmanuel TV, had actually prophesied his ascent to world recognition in boxing. “He said to me I would become a world champion. He told me from the start that this is written in the heavens and no one can change this destiny other than me if I take the wrong path in life.”\n\nAccording to online sources, before Davidson’s encounter with Joshua, his career was experiencing major setbacks. After being scheduled to fight, he would sustain an injury that would force him to withdraw. These recurrent injuries prompted his promoters to write him off, casting a great pall of doubt on his career. However, after watching Joshua on Emmanuel TV and visiting The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) in Nigeria to receive prayer, his career began to turn around.\n\nHis victory over Ghanaian Lamptey has guaranteed Davidson will rise to the top 15 in the world WBO rankings, putting him on course to eventually challenge for the full version of the world title, which is currently held by Zaurbek Baysangurov. He has now won 15 of his 16 professional fights, nine of them being won by a knock out. According to the article, Davidson is also preparing a return to his native Nigeria to stage a fight. “He is adamant he would like to make one defence in Nigeria, in front of T.B. Joshua, and then hopes to quickly follow that up with another big fight back in Southampton.”\n\nDavidson’s revelation is not the first from a sportsman testifying to Joshua’s prophetic insight. Ghanaian football coach Sellas Tetteh publicly said that Joshua had given him prophetic direction during the Black Satellites remarkable victory at the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He is also said to be behind the rise to stardom of Sani Emmanuel, the MVP of the FIFA U-17 World Cup and altar boy in The SCOAN, who is currently playing for SS Lazio in Italy. Joshua also prophesied, against all odds, the remarkable victory of Zambia in the African Cup Of Nations in 2012, specifying Didier Drogba’s shocking penalty miss in the final.\n\nT.B. Joshua has become a household name in many African countries due to the immense popularity of his Christian television station, Emmanuel TV. Numerous African politicians and personalities have visited his church in Lagos, including Malawian President Joyce Banda, Ghana’s John Atta Mills and Zimbabwe's Morgan Tsvangarai.\n\nPost published in: News"
