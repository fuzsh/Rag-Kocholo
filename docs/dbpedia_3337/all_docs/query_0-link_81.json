        "text": "SS Lazio of Italy youthful midfielder, Michael Folorunsho has caught the attention of their less-fancied counterparts, Reggina, who are reportedly keen on renewing their former romance with Nigerian players, which saw them pay the wages of Victor Obinna Nsofor and Stephen Ayodele Makinwa in the past, megasportsarena.com reports.\n\nInformation on offer from The Land of The Azzurri reveals that, while Crotone striker, Simeon Tochukwu Nwankwo (Simy) is attracting interest from Lazio, who also once hand Makinwa on their cards, before Sani Emmanuel, Eddy Ogenyi Onazi and Sheyi Adeleke starred for the same Rome-based team, they are bound to lose Folorunsho to newly-promoted Italian Serie B outfit, Reggina.\n\nDetails of the report by Gazzetta del Sud revealed that Reggina’s sporting director, Massimo Taibi has identified Folorunsho as a talent that can help his side bolster their midfield, as a lot has been seen of the 22-year-old Nigerian-born lad in terms of his skills and physical ability.\n\nHe could now be on the move again, so soon after joining Lazio in the summer of 2019, following which he got a two-season-long loan deal with Bari, which runs out at the end of this month, but the chances of Reggina signing him depend on whether his current club fail to secure promotion from the third-tier Italian Serie C playoffs.\n\nSo far this season, the Rome-born midfielder has made 15 appearances for Bari, but his outings with La Biancorossi were limited by an injury he suffered at the beginning of the season that kept him out of action for two months; but things are looking up once again for the youngster, who has also previously played for Sapienza, Savio and Virtus Francavilla.\n\nIronically, while Folorunsho is on his way out of Lazio, despite having a contract that is meant to run with The Eagles until 2024, the two-time Italian Serie A champions have reignited their zeal for signing ‘Simy’ from Crotone.\n\nTuttosalernitana disclosed that Lazio have taken notice of Simy’s impressive performances over the course of the season in Serie B and they are now plotting a move for the lanky attacker, who top scored in the second division after Crotone gave him a new deal last summer to fend off interest from the Biancocelesti, but the inevitable now appears set to come to pass.\n\nThis is sequel to a spirited drive being made by Makinwa, who is now the leading agent for the 28-year-old striker, who has netted 20 goals in all competitions this term, including 18 in the second-tier Serie B and finished as highest scorer in the league.\n\nHe is under contract with Crotone until the end of the 2021/22 season and valued at 1.70m euro by Transfermarkt, but all of that will not dissuade Lazio, who also have in their ranks Nigerian-born Dutch youth national team winger, Bobby Adekanye, who joined the Rome-based club as a free agent last summer, and has gone on to make 11 appearances for their first team since then."
