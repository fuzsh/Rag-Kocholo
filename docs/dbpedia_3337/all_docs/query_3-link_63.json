        "text": "Fabrizio Piscitelli, more widely known by his nom de guerre, Diabolik, was the leader of the Irriducibile, a group of neofascist Lazio ultras who arose from Italy’s “Years of Lead”, the period in the 1980s when domestic terrorism carried out by the far left and the far right led to hundreds of deaths. In a football culture where the influence of organised, semi-militant fan groups could carry almost as much weight as the decisions of club owners and managers, Diabolik’s control of the curva nord in Lazio’s Stadio Olimpico was extremely significant, even as he himself was banned by the government from all the country’s stadia (Paolo di Canio, a player who sported a tattoo of Mussolini and would regularly give the Roman salute after scoring for Lazio, knew Piscitelli). In an extract from his new book, 1312: Among The Ultras, James Montague recalls meeting Piscitelli three months before he was shot dead in a local park. Fresh off a three-year stint in prison for drug trafficking, which saw the Italian police impound more than €2 million in cash and other assets, Piscitelli bemoaned the modern ultras movement and expressed his dismay at the unwillingness of younger ultras to use violence or commit acts of vandalism.\n\nFabrizio didn’t arrive until nightfall. After he had climbed out of his car with a bodyguard, two members of the Irriducibili stood to attention and gave a Roman salute. Diabolik was slightly built, with chiselled features. He was in his early fifties but looked much younger and was often photographed wearing glasses, giving him the disarming air of Louis Theroux. He wasn’t wearing glasses today, and discounting any danger because of his boyish appearance would have been a mistake. He invited us inside and up to a mezzanine where he sat behind his desk. On the wall next to him was a portrait of Benito Mussolini. He sat down, rolled a joint, lit it and took a deep drag. He held it out to us with an unbroken stare, a test to see whether we would play by his rules or not. We complied. He was charismatic and relaxed, and took another drag. “Do you just want to know about the violence?”\n\n“No,” I replied.\n\nAlthough that wasn’t true. I did want to know about the violence. But I also wanted to know about how the Irriducibili began. At least, I wanted to know Fabrizio’s version of the story.\n\nThe Irriducibili began in 1987 when Fabrizio was 21, although he had been going to the stadium since he was 13. “I grew up in a red neighbourhood and directly across the street in front of me was the head of [Roma’s ultra group] the Fedayn. He was a far-left activist and I grew up the opposite, far-right Lazio. That was a response to Roma being a leftist team in a leftist neighbourhood and Lazio having some of these fighters who were of the far right.” The government, Fabrizio believed, decided to kick political violence out of the square and into football, where it could be controlled.\n\nBy the early 1990s Diabolik had elbowed his way to the top. Over the next decade the Irriducibili became notorious for their fighting, their choreography, which included witty retorts often adapted from classical literature (Dante’s Inferno was a favourite), alongside viscerally racist and anti-Semitic banners and chants. They are too numerous to list in full: the constant booing and monkey chants directed at black players; the lionising of Serbian war criminal Željko Ražnatović after his murder in 2000 with a banner that said “Honour to the Tiger, Arkan”; the constant mocking of Roma fans for being Jewish, owing to the fact that Rome’s Jews were largely from the centre of the city (“Black Squad, Jewish Home End”; “Auschwitz is your country, the gas chambers are your home”); stickers left all over the curva sud showing Anne Frank and the words “The Roma fan is a Jew”.\n\nThe Irriducibili became notorious for their viscerally anti-Semitic banners and chants\n\n“We are a bunch of f***ing bastards, basically,” Fabrizio freely admitted, utterly unrepentant of his racism and anti-Semitism. In the 1990s the power of the Irriducibili grew. The last player who the Irriducibili felt was “one of ours” was Beppe Signore, the deadliest striker in Italy in the mid-1990s. Signore almost signed for Parma in 1995 until thousands of Irriducibili came on to the street and protested violently. Incredibly, their actions led to the transfer being stopped. Fabrizio was at the centre of it all: with a megaphone at the front of the curva nord denouncing Roma; travelling with the Irriducibili to Atalanta away and leading the Roman salutes; persuading the police to allow a banner at the Rome derby that clearly had fascist connotations. When there was a riot, Fabrizio was often there too, not throwing a punch, but regulating and controlling the behaviour from the sidelines. The most striking moment came when hundreds of Irriducibili members descended on Lazio’s training ground, angry at the team’s recent form. At one point Alessandro Nesta, now the team’s captain, emerged to beckon Fabrizio inside. The players and the Irriducibili held a meeting where a truce was agreed. Later, when the French international Lilian Thuram refused to sign for Lazio because of the Irriducibili’s racist chants, Fabrizio somehow arranged a meeting with Thuram at his club Parma. “It was very strange,” Thuram said of that meeting. “In Italy the fans are very powerful.”\n\nFabrizio didn’t see the rise of the Irriducibili as a story about greed and power, but one about taking on a corrupt system at its own game. He loved Lazio but the Irriducibili were above Lazio. It was loyalty to the group and its internal values that he demanded. Diabolik lamented what had become of the modern ultra movement. Technology, he said, was ruining everything. Everybody was posting pictures on Instagram. There was no anonymity any more. Even if it was possible to hide your identity – no face, no name – people were willingly giving away their movements on social media. “Back in the day you had to go to a neighbourhood and find these people and you’d meet these people and so the connections were more genuine,” he said. “You and your ten thousand friends on your Facebook group is nothing compared to my thousand genuine friendships built over the years on the curva.” He also felt the youth were less dedicated.\n\n“The moment the kid is a little bit sceptical about writing something on a wall, about going into a fight: it’s the moment we’ve lost.” The hypocrisy, he said, was getting too much. “For years the fans were convenient to the clubs. We made you all your money, we were the reason why you went to the stadium because we filled the stadium. We made the choreography, we helped you kick out players when you didn’t want the player... And all of a sudden you guys went...” he rubbed his hands together as if he was washing them, “time for clean football. As if we were the filthy ones in football when you are match-fixing every game, half your presidents are corrupt.”\n\nNo one knew how long Fabrizio would be free, such was the weight of legal cases against him. But he hoped, at least, to see Lazio win the cup. In a few weeks they would play against Milan in the semi-final of the Coppa Italia. Win that and there was a potential final against Atalanta, a club whose ultras had shared a fierce and violent ideological rivalry with Lazio for two decades. But, like many Italian ultras, Fabrizio had shifted his hatred away from other groups towards the state. Prison tended to have that effect, even if the world seemed to have turned in his direction. Italy’s most powerful man was Matteo Salvini, a far-right populist who enjoyed standing on Milan’s curva sud with the ultras. But Fabrizio didn’t trust “this fake right. It’s a world of hypocrisy. It’s all bullshit. We don’t trust any of them.” The only institution Fabrizio trusted or had any faith in was the Irriducibili. Any ultra that did support the system was not an ally. The friend of my enemy is my enemy. He dreamed one day that ultras, all ultras, could unite against who he and his Irriducibili viewed as the real enemy. “To go against the globalists, against the fact the EU has taken away people’s right to work, that it allows the Zionists to control all the economies of the world,” he said. “We live under a dictator where the European Union controls us all. We don’t live under a democracy. I want us all to gather and instead of meeting outside the stadium to have a fight, we meet outside the European Union ready to f***ing die.”\n\n1312: Among The Ultras – A Journey With The World’s Most Extreme Fans by James Montague (Ebury) is out on 12 March.\n\nNow read\n\nHow Kraftwerk helped redefine German identity after Second World War\n\nUncanny Valley: inside the craziness that is Silicon Valley hiring processes\n\nHow South American drug cartels created a narco-state in West Africa"
