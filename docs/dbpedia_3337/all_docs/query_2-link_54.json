        "text": "Maurizio Sarri worries about the future of football. The sport that impassioned him enough to leave a career in banking to coach village teams in Tuscany — one of them played at the end of a vineyard owned by Sting — is becoming less and less a game and more and more a business.\n\n“If football allows itself to be treated like one, it won’t be around in 10 years,” the Lazio manager said. Businesses go bust, after all. And besides, “there are more interesting shows on TV”.\n\nWatching international football has helped Sarri form that impression. “I’m the only dinosaur who notices these things,” he grumbled. A winter World Cup last year was, in his opinion, “an insult to football”.\n\nHe asked himself what Qatar had ever done for the game to be granted the hosting rights of its most prestigious competition. FIFA, UEFA, Serie A — actually, make that every governing body — regularly get an earful from the 64-year-old.\n\n“I’m not having a go at the national teams. I watched 10 minutes of Kosovo v Andorra and all the players were in one penalty area. I was like, ‘What the fuck is going on?’. What I’m critical of is the match calendar, because the quality of football diminishes. There are always five or six players missing through injury. Where do they think the game is headed?”.\n\nA busier calendar makes his job harder and less satisfying because he doesn’t get a chance to do what he loves — and that’s coach footballers. Sarri has complained (he does this a lot) about feeling more like a film director than a football manager because if you play every three days, the players rest in between rather than train.\n\nIt limits the work Sarri can do in video analysis. “Football isn’t sustainable anymore. It’s absurd. I’ve heard people make comparisons with the NBA. It’s madness. Basketball players play 38 minutes (actually 48), not 90. There’s more contact in football than in the NBA. Maybe a bit less in Eurobasket.\n\n“Matias Vecino (Lazio’s Uruguayan midfielder) played in Japan and South Korea (last month) for a couple of friendlies,” the grumpiest old man in coaching scoffed. Asked on Friday for a wish list for the summer transfer window, Sarri said: “Eleven players for the league, 11 for Europe and 11 for the Coppa Italia, like Pro Recco in water polo.”\n\nHis critics think he should just get with the programme. He isn’t a lower-league manager anymore. Napoli, Chelsea, Juventus and Lazio are not Stia, Sangiovannese, Tegoleto and Cavriglia.\n\nThe higher you go, the more competitions you play in. The less time you get on the training ground. Deal with it.\n\nAnd he does.\n\nThe tracksuitophone won the 2018-19 Europa League with Chelsea despite the Thursday-Sunday grind. Juventus’ most recent Scudetto the following season — underappreciated at the time — gets better and better with hindsight amid all the congestion caused by COVID-19, and this Lazio side are arguably the closest to his ideal of Sarrismo since that Napoli team.\n\nFor all the flowers thrown at Luciano Spalletti’s feet, it’s worth remembering his Napoli side are only a point better off than the 2017-18 vintage under Sarri.\n\nIn a league this volatile — four different champions in four years (if Napoli get over the line) for the first time since the period between 1999 and 2002 — it isn’t inconceivable that Lazio could be next. Roma manager Jose Mourinho provocatively tipped them for the title back in pre-season. “They’ve spent €39million ($43.3m; £34.9m). Why aren’t you talking about them as candidates?” he asked, deflecting some pressure Sarri’s way. It backfired — as did Mourinho’s reaction to Lazio’s exit from the Europa Conference League.\n\nThe Sass from Setubal never liked how Lazio’s sporting director Igli Tare dismissed the Conference League as a “Coppetta” — a tinpot little trophy no one cares about — after Roma won its inaugural final last season so naturally couldn’t help himself when AZ Alkmaar knocked Lazio out in its round of 16 a month ago. “Lazio won’t have a third competition to play in now, right?” Mourinho mused. “That’s a shame.”\n\nA few days later, when Lazio beat Roma in the derby to complete a domestic double over them — the first time that’s happened in more than a decade — Alessio Romagnoli, the team’s captain, and a dyed-in-the-wool Laziale at that, gleefully retorted: “There’s no third derby for Roma now, is there?”\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nDerby Days, Rome: Derby della Capitale\n\nIt was the most satisfying moment of a deeply satisfying season. If Serie A operated as a mini-league featuring just the top seven, the Biancocelesti would be numero uno. Napoli, Inter Milan, Juventus, AC Milan, Roma, Atalanta: they’ve beaten them all.\n\nAesthetically, the football has been spellbinding at times. It’s enough to watch Luis Alberto’s back-heel assist for Mattia Zaccagni’s winner against Juventus last weekend. Tactically, the sapper within Sarri expertly defused Napoli at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, where Lazio managed to win for the first time in eight years.\n\nStatistically, the team are second in Serie A for goals after sequences of 10 or more passes, while at the back they’ve kept an astonishing 18 clean sheets in 30 games. Of those 30 matches, Lazio have gone in at half-time without conceding on 25 occasions. TWENTY-FIVE. You must go back half a century to find a Lazio side with a better defensive record.\n\nEighteen months into the job, the team is now fully identified with Sarri. It was not easy, as we saw at Juventus, to transition a group of players to a completely different methodology after five successful years under Simone Inzaghi.\n\nBut Sarri has done it by signing an underrated goalkeeper in Ivan Provedel and a trio of players he’d worked with in the past (Pedro, Vecino and Elseid Hysaj). He’s “fought” with Tare to go local — “when an Italian plays three games in Serie A, he costs €15million, whereas a foreigner from the Bundesliga will go for €3m” — plus he’s recruited born-and-bred Lazio fans including Romagnoli and Luca Pellegrini to add to Danilo Cataldi.\n\nThe difference in squad depth with Roma is still “abyssal” in the opinion of loudmouth player turned loudmouth pundit Antonio Cassano. And yet, Sarri has overcome compatibility clashes with Alberto, the recent dip in the form of Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who is now back among the goals, and the injury-hit season of four-time Capocannoniere Ciro Immobile, who was lucky to walk away with a fractured rib and back pain after a tram ran into his car on Sunday.\n\n“Sarri has improved everyone,” club legend Paolo Di Canio observed. “He’s done all this without a left-footer at left-back and a backup striker. I’m joking when I say this but at Bar Corallo in Quarticciolo — the neighbourhood I’m from in Rome — even we have three guys who can play centre-forward. Even we’ve got a starter and a couple of reserves. Lazio don’t have anyone apart from Felipe Anderson as a false nine, and he practically disappeared after leaving Lazio the first time around.”\n\nMeanwhile, Roma have €45million Tammy Abraham, Euro 2020 winner Andrea Belotti and a certain Paulo Dybala, and Mourinho still complains “we have no (Erling) Haaland”.\n\nLazio would be a feel-good story everyone could get behind if sections of their fanbase didn’t disgrace themselves and the club with horrendous racist and antisemitic chants. Not to mention the guy who turned up at the derby wearing a jersey with the name ‘Hitlerson’ and the number 88 on the back.\n\nLazio have, not for the first time, issued a strong statement of condemnation as well as a series of lifetime bans. It’s a shame some of the supporters they attract continue to make them such a turn-off off the pitch, overshadowing how much of a turn-on they can be on it.\n\nThis team, now a full 10 points inside the Champions League places, have so far been a joy to behold and as much as football’s future may dismay Sarri, he should enjoy living in the present tense.\n\n(Top photo: Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images)"
