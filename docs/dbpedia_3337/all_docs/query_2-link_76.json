        "text": "The Saints set to lock horns against high-flying Lazio.\n\nHaving narrowly edged past Leeds United in the Championship promotion final, Southampton have re-entered the Premier League. They kicked off their pre-season campaign in spectacular fashion, annihilating Eastleigh 7-1 in their opener. This was followed by two more consecutive victories against Bordeaux and Montpellier. However, Des Buckingham’s Oxford United handed them their first defeat of the campaign. Southampton bounced back in their most recent fixture, securing a narrow victory over Millwall.\n\nLazio, on the other hand, will be disappointed to have missed out on a UEFA Champions League spot, falling just short by a few points to fifth-placed Bologna. Despite the additional berth for Italian teams in the UCL, Lazio had to settle for a spot in the UEFA Europa League. Their pre-season campaign has been impressive so far, remaining unbeaten. They secured victories over Trapani 1905, Hansa, and Frosinone before drawing against Triestina.\n\nBoth squads have exhibited a remarkable pre-season campaign thus far. Lazio will be intent on perpetuating their undefeated streak, whereas Southampton will be eager to elevate their morale with a victory over the Eagles.\n\nKick-Off:\n\nThursday, 8 August 2024 at 12:00 AM IST\n\nLocation: St. Mary’s Stadium, Southampton, England\n\nForm:\n\nSouthampton (in all competitions): W-L-W-W-W\n\nLazio (in all competitions): W-W-D-W-D\n\nPlayers to watch:\n\nYukinari Sugawara (Southampton)\n\nThe Japanese international from Toyokawa has had a stellar pre-season campaign, establishing himself as a pivotal player for Southampton. Standing at 5 feet 10 inches, Sugawara also boasts the record for the most appearances for AZ Alkmaar, affectionately known as The Cheese Farmers, in UEFA club competitions. He was a key member of the Japanese under-19 squad that clinched third place in the AFC U-19 Championship in 2018.\n\nSugawara has already made significant contributions for Southampton, registering a goal and an assist in their pre-season fixtures. His dynamic play on the right flank will be indispensable for manager Russell Martin as he aims to propel the Saints to new heights in the upcoming season.\n\nTijjani Noslin (SS Lazio)\n\nThe 6-foot-tall Dutch centre forward from Amsterdam, Tijjani Noslin, is poised to make a significant impact when Lazio visits St. Mary’s Stadium to face Southampton. The 25-year-old forward has had stints with USV Hercules, Fortuna Sittard, and Hellas Verona.\n\nDespite a setback with a failed trial at an academy in Manchester, Noslin found success with USV Hercules, where he made 26 appearances and scored 10 goals. The promising prodigy has caught the eye of Rafael van der Vaart, who praised him as “a nice player who is always dangerous. He is very direct and possesses all the qualities.” Noslin’s presence will be crucial for Lazio as they look to secure a victory against the Saints.\n\nMatch facts:\n\nLazio are unbeaten in their last five fixtures.\n\nSouthampton are coming after a narrow victory over Millwall.\n\nLazio kept two clean sheets in their pre-season campaign so far.\n\nSouthampton vs Lazio: Betting Tips and Odds\n\nTip 1: Match to end in a draw.\n\nTip 2: Both teams to score.\n\nTip 3: At least one goal to be scored in the second half.\n\nInjury and team news:\n\nApart from the exception of Gavin Bazanu, Russell Martin will have the luxury to pick his best combination of players from a fully fit and available squad.\n\nSS Lazio will most likely miss the presence of Spanish centre-back Mario Gila, Portuguese left-back Nuno Tavares, and Paraguayan winger Diego Gonzalez.\n\nHead to head:\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be any record of these two sides previously meeting each other. This could possibly be the first of many encounters between these two teams.\n\nPredicted lineup:\n\nSouthampton predicted lineup (4-2-3-1):\n\nMcCarthy (GK); Sugawara, Stephens, Bednarek, Taylor; Harwood-Bellis, Downes; Aribo, Smallbone, Edozie; Armstrong\n\nSS Lazio predicted lineup (4-3-1-2):\n\nProvedel (GK); Lazzari, Casale, Patric, Pellegrini; Dele-Bashiru, Cataldi, Zaccagni; Guendouzi; Noslin, Tchaouna\n\nMatch prediction for Southampton vs Lazio:\n\nBoth teams are equally fierce and competent to edge past each other. Looking at the recent form of both these teams, a draw would be a satisfactory outcome as both sides would nullify each other’s threats.\n\nPrediction: Southampton 2-2 Lazio\n\nTelecast for Southampton vs Lazio:\n\nBrazil: Zapping\n\nCanada: DAZN Canada\n\nItaly: DAZN Italia\n\nNigeria: Star Times World Football\n\nUSA: ESPN+\n\nVenezuela: Disney+ Sur"
