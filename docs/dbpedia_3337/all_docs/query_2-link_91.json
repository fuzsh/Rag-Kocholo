        "text": "556\n\nSS Lazio are considering making a move for former Manchester United star Anthony Martial if they cannot get their first choice forward this summer, Mason Greenwood.\n\nGreenwood is at the centre of a transfer tug-of-war involving the Rome club, French club Olympique de Marseille and another Serie A side, Napoli.\n\nAs reported here earlier, Lazio’s president Claudio Lotito is becoming impatient and frustrated waiting for the drama to play out and is threatening to move on to other targets should United and Greenwood not make a decision in the next few days.\n\nAccording to this morning’s paper edition of Corriere dello Sport, one of those alternative targets is none other than Greenwood’s former teammate at United, Anthony Martial.\n\nThe outlet says that ideally Lazio want to sign a winger and the idea of a centre forward had been ruled out. However:\n\n“Never say never … ideas, scenarios and rumours are often subverted.\n\n“Anthony Martial appeared yesterday, released by Manchester United. A star to be relaunched, he is now 28 years old, a centre forward and winger.\n\n“He has been offered to Como, his agents would have also notified [Lazio]. In 2015 he was sold for €60 million by Monaco, he wants to return as a protagonist.”\n\nIf Martial were to join Lazio, he would certainly be expected to accept a much lower salary than the €300,000 per week he enjoyed at United.\n\nLazio’s highest earner, Mattia Zaccagni, earns just €114,000 per week (source: capology.com).\n\nHowever, it is probably fair to say that with the possible exception of a middle Eastern club, the Frenchman has no chance of getting close to his old salary anywhere, given his poor form over the last few years and his susceptibility to injury.\n\nTransfer guru Fabrizio Romano stated two days ago that Martial has “already turned down several approaches from England” and is “open to [a] new league”.\n\nSerie A could certainly fit the bill and Lazio are most likely a better fit than Como, despite the fact that his countryman and former United teammate, Raphael Varane, looks set to join Cesc Fabregas’s side."
