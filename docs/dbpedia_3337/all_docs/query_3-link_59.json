After each match, regardless of the result, I want to greet the boys and the staff,\" he said.\n\n“When the referee stopped the game, waiting for the announcer to call for an end to the racist chants, Umtiti asked for the game to resume because he wanted to respond to the insults he received on the pitch. He reacted like a true champion.”\n\nLecce's club account tweeted: “Racist chants have been overwhelmed by songs of encouragement! All the yellow and red Lecce fans started shouting one name: Umtiti.”\n\nWriting on Instagram after the game, Umtiti said: “Great win for #forzalecce.”\n\nHe received supportive messages from the likes of Jerome Boateng, Naby Sarr and Alexandre Lacazette.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino also posted a message of support.\n\n“Solidarity with Samuel Umtiti and Lameck Banda - let’s shout it loud and clear: NO TO RACISM!” he said on social media.\n\n“May the huge majority of fans, who are good people, stand up to shut up all the racists once and for all.”\n\nThe game was part of Serie A’s first day of games back after the extended winter break for the World Cup.\n\nThe win moved Lecce up to 12th while Lazio stayed fifth.\n\nTransfers\n\nRashford happy to stay at United despite PSG talks - Paper Round\n\n12/08/2022 at 07:24\n\nTransfers\n\nArsenal set for ‘significant’ summer investment even without Champions League - Paper Round\n\n18/05/2022 at 07:45"
