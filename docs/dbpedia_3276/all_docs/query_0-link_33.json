        "text": "Doon Mackichan claims she never saw herself as a comedienne, but as a performer who can \"tell stories and pull a few faces\", attributes that brought her to the fore as one third of the team in the double Emmy-award-winning sketch show, Smack the Pony (Channel 4, 1999-2003).\n\nHer family moved when she was nine from Surrey to Fife, where at the drama club she survived by playing 'posh bitches'. Leaving Manchester University with a drama degree, she performed stand-up comedy and formed a double-act with Anne Rabbitt as slapstick hosts of children's programme Wake Up London (ITV, 1985).\n\nFollowing fleeting cameos in the likes of Harry Enfield's Television Programme (BBC, 1990-92), her comedy breakthrough came as part of the writer-performer team of Radio 4's spoof news programme, On the Hour, which transferred to television as The Day Today (BBC, 1994). She subsequently made appearances alongside former co-stars Steve Coogan and Chris Morris on, respectively, Knowing Me, Knowing You... with Alan Partridge (BBC, 1994) and the controversial Brass Eye (Channel 4, 1997-2001), before grabbing a bigger share of the spotlight alongside Fiona Allen and Sally Phillips on Smack the Pony.\n\nIn between have come appearances in more conventional sitcoms - Agony Again (BBC, 1995), Beast (BBC, 2000-01) and Bed Time (BBC, 2001-03) - while she has lent her voice to documentaries and to animated characters in Bob and Margaret (Channel 4, 1998-99) and Stressed Eric (BBC, 1998-2000).\n\n'Straighter' roles have seen her as the manipulative Sophronia Lammle in Our Mutual Friend (BBC, 1998), as Cherie Blair in A Very Social Secretary (Channel 4, 2005) and as a BBC producer in Taking the Flak (BBC, 2009). Still combining theatre and television careers, in 2010 she revived her one-woman stage show, Primadoona.\n\nGraham Rinaldi"
