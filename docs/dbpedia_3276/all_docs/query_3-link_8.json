They now reunite in Penelope Skinner’s brand new play Lyonesse about a reclusive actress who is planning a movie comeback. With the brilliant Ian Rickson directing, we should be in safe hands. Unfortunately, even with their collective talent and star power, it is hard to rescue this confused and untidy play.\n\nPhotos: First Look Inside Rehearsals for World Premiere of LYONESSE, Starring Kristin Scott Thomas\n\nRehearsal images have been released for the world premiere of Lyonesse by Penelope Skinner, directed by Ian Rickson and produced by Sonia Friedman Productions. This searingly funny and passionate new play stars Kristin Scott Thomas and Lily James alongside James Corrigan, Doon Mackichan and Sara Powell. It will run at Harold Pinter Theatre from 17 October – 23 December 2023. Check out the photos below.\n\nJames Corrigan, Doon Mackichan, and Sara Powell Join Kristin Scott Thomas and Lily James in LYONESSE at the Harold Pinter Theatre\n\nFull casting has been announced for the world premiere of Lyonesse by Penelope Skinner, directed by Ian Rickson at the Harold Pinter Theatre from 17 October – 23 December 2023.\n\ntheSpaceUK Announces Virtual Festival, Online@theSpaceUK\n\nOne festival, Three Weeks, Eighty Shows - driven by theSpaceUK's new writing ethos all shows are original work and have been written during lockdown.\n\nVIDEO: Tamsin Greig and Simon Godwin Discuss the National Theatre's TWELFTH NIGHT\n\nA Twelfth Night reunion took place on the National Theatre's YouTube channel!\n\nBWW Review: TWELFTH NIGHT, National Theatre at Home\n\nThe hype around the National Theatre's production of Twelfth Night when it premiered in 2017 was, understandably, centred around Tamsin Greig. Not necessarily because of her celebrity status (although that of course will have been a factor), but primarily because she would be undertaking a gender-swapped role - from Malvolio to Malvolia.\n\nStage to Screen: Upcoming Live Theatre Broadcasts!\n\nDon't miss the chance to see theater come to life on screen in these upcoming broadcasts!\n\nWhat's On Around Glasgow and Edinburgh This Christmas\n\nBWW reviewer Natalie O'Donoghue highlights her top festive picks around Glasgow and Edinburgh this Christmas.\n\nVIDEO: John Malkovich Talks BITTER WHEAT, His Career, and More With Neil Sean\n\nJohn Malkovich recently sat down with Neil Sean at the Garrick Theatre. The actor talked about his career, his new play 'Bitter Wheat,' and much more.\n\nBWW Review: BITTER WHEAT, Garrick Theatre\n\nWhen David Mamet's new play was announced back in January, it was met with more than a raised eyebrow. Bitter Wheat is a comedy about movie mogul Barney Fein, a man who bears more than a passing resemblance to disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, and sees John Malkovich make a return to the London stage. The question is, should Mamet be the one to tell this kind of story at this juncture? Do we really need another male perspective on the subject?\n\nPhoto Flash: First Look at BITTER WHEAT Starring John Malkovich\n\nDavid Mamet's new play Bitter Wheat is in previews at the Garrick Theatre in London with a press night on Wednesday 19 June 2019.\n\nBWW Interview: Doon Mackichan Talks David Mamet's BITTER WHEAT\n\nDoon Mackichan's previous work includes iconic TV series Smack the Pony and shows like Jumpy at the Royal Court.

The run, which was originally scheduled to finish on 14 September, now finishes on Saturday 21 September 2019.\n\nLondon Theater Festival Returns to Majestic Theater\n\nThe Majestic Theater in Gettysburg, PA will present the 2nd annual National Theatre Live Festival from London on Thursday, September 7 - Sunday, September 10, 2017.\n\nWirtz Center's SummerStage 2017 to Go from Peter Pan to Pinball Wizards\n\nFrom \"Peter Pan\" to 'Pinball Wizards,' the Wirtz Center's SummerStage 2017 season at Northwestern University offers something for everyone."
