        "text": "I remember exactly where I was when I first encountered Alan Partridge. I was driving over Waterloo Bridge on my way home from work in the winter of 1992, and I was listening distractedly on Radio 4 to a man interviewing a British novelist called Lawrence Camley.\n\nThe interviewee is challenged in a startlingly direct way which immediately got my attention. “You’ve never won the Nobel Prize for Literature. What went wrong?” Camley answers that he writes to satisfy his muse and not to win prizes. “It’s a big fish. Your net’s full of holes,” comes the uncompromising response. “All nets are full of holes,” answers Camley. “Granted,” replies the interviewer. “But your holes are too big to catch the Nobel Peace Prize Fish of Literature.”\n\nAnd it was at this point that I realised that what I was listening to was actually a spoof.\n\n‘Individual types were so brilliantly, comically representative – from Nick Ford, “bad boy lawyer”, to Conrad Knight, “a gent in Hollywood” to Ally Tennant, “mad hippie” psychoanalyst’\n\nPerfectly conceived\n\nLike all the best parodies, Alan Partridge (for it is he) is rooted so authentically in that which he satirises, its language and characterisation so accurate, that it required something of a double-take to be satisfied that he was, in fact, a work of fiction. The original radio series of Knowing Me, Knowing You, in which Partridge (alter ego of the incomparable Steve Coogan) hosts a “topical” chat show, is, in my view, the most perfectly conceived, brilliantly written, expertly played British comedy show of my lifetime.\n\nA big claim, I know, but the troupe of writers and performers whose talents came together 17 years ago to create the show (Coogan, Armando Iannucci, Patrick Marber, Rebecca Front, Doon Mackichan and David Schneider) now reads like a who’s who of contemporary British satire, comedy and drama . Every aspect of Knowing Me, Knowing You was consummate.\n\nNot only in the creation of the crass, unworldly, unreconstructed host, but in the way the guests were depicted, their names perfect, their individual types so brilliantly, comically representative. Everyone from Nick Ford, “bad boy lawyer”, to Conrad Knight, “a gent in Hollywood” to Ally Tennant, “mad hippie” psychoanalyst, and many others besides.\n\nCoogan has gone on to become a substantial film star – evidenced by his recent Bafta nomination for his role as Stan Laurel – but, to many of us, he’ll always be Partridge, which is why we rejoice at his return to television next week in BBC1’s This Time With Alan Partridge on Monday night.\n\nClose to home\n\nFrom the trailer, we see Partridge as the co-host of a TV magazine show. Partridge is there as the authentic voice of Middle England, but, as we know, he is largely the repository of antediluvian attitudes and bizarre aphorisms.\n\nIt would be hard to find a more perfect expression of the age in which we live – mediocre in thought, utterance and deed – than Partridge, with his outdated thinking and jumbled metaphors. I find listening to him no more or less bizarre than hearing Jacob Rees-Mogg or James Delingpole, to name but two people who get a fair share of air time.\n\nPartridge’s return to the screen will remind us that the best satire is uncomfortably close to home."
