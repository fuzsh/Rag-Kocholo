It was jolly nice, actually,” says Coogan.\n\nMarber decided the 25th anniversary of their groundbreaking news parody, The Day Today, deserved a celebratory dinner. But the get-together was more than a chance to reminisce, as the talk turned to work projects and the possibility of a reunion. “Yeah, we said we should do something,” says Coogan. “Everyone has gone off and done their own thing. But 25 years is quite long enough to prove that you can do something else. So we may do a podcast or something … I don’t know.” But this wouldn’t be for old times’ sake. None of the team that wrote and performed that excoriating, angry comedy is looking to rehash the past. “There’s no point doing anything that is just based on nostalgia,” he says. “Because what we did was very edgy and challenging. You either do something equally relevant or don’t bother.”\n\nA podcast would be fudgeing Jurassic Park! Could have their former On The Hour colleagues Lee & Herring back, if they and Marber have kissed and made up.\n\nI ask him what his lapel badge means. It’s a small, white tooth; a molar, with a cartoon face drawn on it. It represents a shadowy showbiz organisation not unlike the Freemasons that “looks after” its members while doing philanthropic works. It may never get a mention in the script, he says. But it’s all been worked out and is authentic to the character. I still don’t know who is telling me this, Coogan or Partridge. In full wig and costume (he says it takes less makeup these days), he is hard to pin down. Neil Gibbons admits both brothers have had conversations with him where they are unsure who they are talking to.\n\nClassic Queen!\n\nEnsor\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\nNov 9, 2017\n\nMessages\n\n897\n\nReaction score\n\n340\n\nPoints\n\n208\n\nLocation\n\nBirmingham\n\nFeb 20, 2019\n\n#23\n\nAnybody else having an issue on Youview of not being able to set this as a series link to record?\n\nSeries link now working as of about 4am this morning (which was when I checked ).\n\nJoined\n\nAug 20, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n1,912\n\nReaction score\n\n2,797\n\nPoints\n\n841\n\nFeb 20, 2019\n\n#24\n\nCan't wait to sit down in front of this with a cup of beans."
