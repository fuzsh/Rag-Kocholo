        "text": "Just over two decades ago, Smack The Pony premiered on Channel 4. It was immediately as absurd and irreverent as its name, and a show that not only revelled in the ridiculousness of femininity (and all the perceptions of it) but made it compulsively, consistently funny. Now, with impeccable timing, it’s back, for re-run of the first series – and it’s just as gloriously stupid as it ever was.\n\nIf you didn’t watch Smack The Pony the first time round (or even if you did) you’re in for a treat. The show ran for three series after first airing in 1999 and starred three comedians, then relatively unknown – Doon Mackichan, Sally Phillips and Fiona Allen. Produced by Victoria Pile, who later created Green Wing, the show was a breath of fresh air for early noughties viewers, encapsulating the 90s woman and redrawing her, one massive merkin at a time.\n\nIt worked so well, perhaps, because it pushed back against a backdrop of the male gaze which had long since dominated comedy. Feminism was in Smack The Pony’s blueprint but that was far from its selling point, nor did it have to be painstakingly pointed out. Rather, it was just about women being inappropriate – according to the norm, at least. They were sometimes masculine, other times unapologetically feminine, insecure and supremely (obtusely) confident, or competitive. They depicted the type of women who couldn’t (or wouldn’t) perform femininity (a waitress being reprimanded because she can’t master a sexy dessert voice, for example). Moreover, it was silly. Really, really bloody silly.\n\nWomen aren’t permitted to be publicly silly very often. More recently, until the likes of Stath Lets Flats, another perfect Channel 4 series which rose (very gently) to critical acclaim last year, and the endlessly funny This Country, comedy itself had taken a step back from silliness. Political sarcasm ruled over physical comedy, and goofiness was subsumed by whip-smart observational bits. Each genre has its value, of course, but sometimes you just want to see a stuffy, po-faced woman silently belly-flop into a pool.\n\nThere are too many brilliant Smack The Pony sketches to mention: a racing game simulation with a “girlie driver” who gets fatally distracted when she spots an M&S on the side of the road; a skit lasting no more than five seconds of a bride and her bridesmaids, carrying her veil, casually shopping in a supermarket; a rare onscreen same sex kiss between two “actors” filming a soap; a shop worker in trouble for stacking every shelf with Toilet Duck; a doctor who is having an illicit love affair with the demonstrative skeleton hanging in her surgery. The show’s infamous “dating agency” videos are a highlight all of their own, encapsulating the pure absurdity and humiliatingly resonant feeling of the series as a standalone bit.\n\nThe Smack The Pony cast and the characters they dreamed up were somehow always sexy, but not stereotypically cool, which is perhaps why my friends and I saw them as the best women we’d ever come across. The admiration was arguably problematic: around age 12 or 13, six or seven of us spent several weekends creating our very own rip off of Smack The Pony, cleverly titled “Kick The Chick”. At school we screamed phrases from our most beloved sketches – “GET DOWN ELTON JOHN” and “ALIIIIIIICEEE!… She’s fucked off” and “Would you like a little dessert?” – down corridors and during lessons until we were chucked out. We loved to recreate the mock pop songs that concluded each episode, writing out the lyrics and learning them by heart. Twenty years later I still live with one of those girls and, while they remain chronically unappreciated by anyone else we meet, we are still singing those songs and repeating the phrases that had us writhing on the floor laughing for all of adolescence.\n\nI don’t think it’s out of turn to say that the characters created in Smack The Pony gave us ideas about who we might want to be, as I’m sure they did so many others. As well as lifting the lid on things like pubes, snogging, insecurities and dating, it made being grown up look very, very fun. Not only that, but it gave us permission to be as weird as we liked.\n\nNow, we relate to it in a different way. Re-watching the series during lockdown has shone light on the jokes we didn’t get (I’m quite sure we wouldn’t have understood the comedy value of a woman cutting lines of cocaine with the cat she is in a relationship with), and adding uncomfortably relatable depth to others. A woman being dragged around by her ex-boyfriend, for example, who literally refuses to let go (of his ankle). “There’s over and then there’s over,” Sally Phillips says as she shimmies along a corporate building floor, to his silence. “You’re just thinking of the wrong over… We’re actually more compatible than you could ever imagine!”\n\nThe point is that the message – nor the comedy – just hasn’t really aged. Love and dating and relationships are still wildly anxious, complicated and unfathomably funny (especially when they’re happening to someone else). Women are still working out how the fuck to balance their lives between motherhood and work; watching someone on a dating video say “kitchen-come-lounge” in a vaguely northern accent, over and over again, is still completely hilarious.\n\nThe return of Smack The Pony is the return of silliness by the bucketload. Maybe it’ll help another generation of teen girls to find the fun in not giving a shit – or maybe it’ll just be a welcome break from reality. Either way, it couldn’t be more welcome."
