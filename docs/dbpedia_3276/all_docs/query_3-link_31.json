Louisa invites Martin, but the doctor turns her down. Martin also pays a visit to a park ranger who believes he lives with a six-foot squirrel.\n\nOut of the Woods\n\nThe local constable asks Martin to be best man at his wedding, but the doctor flatly refuses. The stag weekend in the woods ends up going terribly wrong; however, Louisa is relieved by the outcome."
