        "text": "Talking to comedian Sarah Donnelly about how she writes her jokes, advice on public speaking and how to avoid nerves and negative feelings, performing stand-up comedy in another language, and more. Sarah is a comedian and language teacher from the US, now living in France.\n\n[DOWNLOAD]\n\nIntroduction\n\nToday I am talking to friend of the podcast, Sarah Donnelly.\n\nIt’s not the first time Sarah has been on this podcast, but it’s been quite a long time since she was in an episode on her own, I mean – as the only guest, not just alone. She wasn’t completely on her own in front of a microphone in an empty room, like “Umm, Luke? Hello? Is anyone here?” I was there too of course. I mean, without any other guests.\n\nMostly Sarah has been in episodes of this podcast with other people you see. Earlier this year I talked to her and Amber about their comedy show about becoming a Mum in France (episode 515), and before that she was in a couple of episodes with Amber & Paul (episodes 460 & 461) and she was in one with Sebastian Marx in which we discussed the 2016 Presidential Elections in the USA (388 & 389).\n\nSarah’s first appearance on the podcast was all the way back in 2013 (episodes 155 & 157).\n\nYou’ll hear us talk about that episode a little bit, and how Sarah felt about it.\n\nSarah is from the United States of America (I’m sure you’ve heard of it, it’s quite a famous country). She originally comes from North Carolina but also has lived and worked in Washington DC, which is where she first started performing stand up comedy.\n\nThen in 2012 she moved to France – roughly at the same time as I did, after she met a French guy. Her story is not dissimilar to mine in fact, except for the differences.\n\nSarah is a primarily a comedian – she’s a stand-up and also a comedy writer. She performs on stage very regularly – as a solo stand up performer and also with Amber Minogue in their show Becoming Maman – which by the way happens every Thursday evening at 20:15 at Théâtre BO Saint Martin 75003 Paris. If you’re in town, check it out!\n\nSarah also works as an English teacher at university in Paris.\n\nOur conversation covers quite a lot of things but mainly we talk about:\n\nHow Sarah writes jokes and comes up with material for her stand up comedy performances\n\nSome tips for successful public speaking including how to deal with feelings of nervousness that you might have before you do a speech or performance, and any feelings of shame that you might experience if you feel like you didn’t do as well as you wanted – all the usual difficult feelings we experience when doing public speaking. Sarah’s been doing stand up comedy very regularly for years now, and also she has plenty of experience of talking to large groups of students as a teacher, so she knows a lot about speaking to audiences and has some good advice and experience to share.\n\nSarah is also a language learner – French in this case, and we talk about her experiences of performing comedy in French.\n\nThere are also the usual tangents and silly stories and things, but I think this conversation should be useful and relevant for anyone doing public speaking, or speaking publicly in another language, and it’s also just nice and fun to spend some time with Sarah. She brought some pumpkin pie for my wife and me, which was nice of her. Pumpkin pie is a bit of a tradition in the states at this time of year and it was delicious.\n\nSo then, without any further ado. Let’s get started.\n\nEnding\n\nSo, don’t listen to the shame wizard! Don’t listen to those feelings of shame or embarrassment that we do feel from time to time. Try to ignore those voices. Switch it off if possible.\n\nWhen you’re speaking English, or thinking about your English, the shame wizard might creep up on you and whisper negative thoughts in your ear, making you feel ashamed of yourself. But don’t listen to him. Tell him to get lost.\n\nWhen you’ve got a presentation to do, the shame wizard might whisper in your ear that everyone thinks you’re rubbish and you have no right to do what you’re doing. Don’t listen to him, he’s LYING!\n\nGood advice from Sarah there.\n\nIn the moments before your presentation, stretch out your arms, stand up, take up some space with your body – but don’t punch someone in the face accidentally of course.\n\nVocabulary\n\nLanguage to describe stand up comedy, writing comedy and writing jokes\n\nParts of a stand up performance\n\nA set = the whole performance from start to finish. E.g. “I did a 15 minute set last night” or “Did you see Sarah? She did a 30 minute set and it was hilarious.”\n\nA bit = one part of a comedian’s set. It could be a story or just a series of jokes based on a particular premise. For example, “She did a whole bit about puberty, and it was funny because it was soooo true”\n\nA joke = one single statement that is intended to make you laugh. It could be a line or a few lines. “Did Sarah do her chalk joke last night? Oh, man, I love that joke.” “Yeah she did, but I don’t think the audience knew what chalk was… But they laughed anyway!”\n\nParts of a joke\n\nA joke can be broken down into parts.\n\nThe premise = the basic idea of a joke, the foundation of it. Like just the idea that it’s pretty weird that we used to use chalk all the time to write on blackboards, but now, younger people don’t even know what chalk is and essentially we used to write on rocks with other rocks, that was our technology, and it was a bit weird” (that’s a bit nebulous, I mean vague, but it’s a starting point – that’s a premise, just the general idea of a joke)\n\nThe set up = parts of a joke that set up the situation and put all the elements in place\n\nThe punchline = the funny line that, hopefully, makes people laugh.\n\nThe wording of a joke = the specific way the joke is worded – the specific construction of a joke. The wording of a joke can be very important in making it funny or not. Often if you believe the premise of the joke is funny, but audiences aren’t laughing at it, you just need to reconsider the wording of that joke. Once you’ve got the wording right, the joke might be more successful.\n\nOther vocabulary for comedy\n\nMaterial = all the jokes, bits and sets that a comedian has in his or her repertoire. “She’s got so much material, she could do several Netflix specials now.”\n\nTried and tested material = the material you’ve done lots of times. You know it well and you’re confident it should get laughs pretty much every time.\n\nTo improvise = to make things up on the spot without preparation\n\nAn open mic = the sort of comedy show you do when you first start out as a comedian. An open mic means anyone can perform. Often these “open mics” are good places to try out new material, but often the whole arrangement is not exactly “professional level show business”. It could be just in the back room of a bar with people coming and going and a generally sketchy atmosphere.\n\nWhat about that whole Louis CK thing?\n\nDidn’t Sarah open one of his shows in Paris recently?\n\nRecently on the podcast I talked a bit about how disgraced comedian Louis CK had made a surprise visit to one of our comedy shows in Paris (Sebastian Marx’s show The New York Comedy Night to be exact) and Sarah was invited to be one of the other comedians on the show. It was quite a tricky decision for her. You’ll see that in the end we don’t talk about that in this episode, mainly because we ran out of time. But if you’d like to hear Sarah expressing her thoughts on that situation, then you can check out an episode of another podcast called The Europeans, which is a podcast about Europe and European life. Sarah was interviewed on that show and she talked about the whole situation very clearly. So, have a look. The name of the podcast is The Europeans, and she was in the episode from 20 November 2018. Her interview starts at about 23 minutes into the episode. There’s a link on the website as usual.\n\nListen to Sarah’s appearance on The Europeans podcast, talking about performing with Louis CK\n\nSarah’s appearance is at about 23:00\n\nVideos & media mentioned in the conversation\n\nThe TED talk about body language\n\nBig Mouth on Netflix\n\n(Subtitles should be available for this trailer on YouTube)\n\nMore Vocabulary\n\nSome more words that came up in the episode\n\na Nebula [noun] – a cloud of gas and dust in space\n\nNebulous [adjective] (this is the word I was looking for) – formless and vaguely defined\n\nPuberty [noun] – the period during which adolescents reach sexual maturity and become capable of reproduction.\n\n“the onset of puberty”\n\nShame [noun] = a painful feeling of humiliation or distress caused by the consciousness of wrong or foolish behaviour.\n\nSelf-esteem [noun] = confidence in one’s own worth or abilities; self-respect.\n\nPrevious episodes with Sarah\n\n515.

Videos and links below.\n\n[DOWNLOAD]\n\nIntroduction Transcript\n\nToday on the podcast I have another interview for you to listen to as part of your learning English routine. This time I am talking to Jessica Beck, who you might know from the IELTS Energy Podcast.\n\nI have spoken to Jessica before on this podcast, back in episode 297 when we talked about using humour in the speaking part of the IELTS test.\n\n297. Using Humour in the IELTS Speaking Test (With Jessica from All Ears English)\n\nIELTS Energy is an appropriate title for that podcast because Jessica has loads of energy as you will hear. When we recorded this conversation it was 7AM for her (because of the time difference) which is pretty early for podcasting but she was already wide awake and ready to go. Maybe it’s that American can-do attitude, or the coffee she’s been drinking, I don’t know, but her energy is infectious. It’s one of the hallmarks of the IELTS Energy Podcast in fact, and the All Ears English podcast, which she is also associated with.\n\nJust in case you don’t know, Jessica Beck is an English teacher who lives in Portland, which is in Oregon, which is in the north-west of the USA, which is in North America, which is in America, which is on earth. So you’re going to be listening to a combination of Jessica’s American English and my British English in this conversation.\n\nSo, Jessica does IELTS Energy, but she’s on my podcast today because she has just launched a new website and YouTube channel called Honestly English, and I thought we could talk a bit about that and some of the topics she’s been teaching recently in her videos. https://honestlyenglish.com/\n\nSo “Honestly English” – this is her own channel, her own project and therefore is a space where she can teach English in her own way and cover topics that mean a lot to her personally and since Jessica is a huge pop culture nerd her videos and blog posts all contain loads of references to movies and comic books and things like that. She is also very passionate about feminism and raising the status of women in society today.\n\nSo these are the things we’re talking about in this episode: The MeToo movement, some language relating to that, then women in pop culture and some superhero characters from the Marvel cinematic universe (specifically Captain Marvel, who will be arriving in cinemas early next year in the Captain Marvel movie and then in Avengers 4 I think) and we also talk about some female comedians from the UK and the USA that we’d like to recommend.\n\n#MeToo\n\nI mentioned the MeToo movement there. I think this is a global phenomenon but you might call it something else in your country. In France it was called #BalanceTonPorc which directly translates as “Balance your pork” or “balance your pig” which doesn’t really mean anything does it – the proper translation of that would be something like “denounce your pig” or “name and shame your abuser”. That’s how #MeToo is known in France, and it may have another name in your country.\n\nWikipedia defines #MeToo like this:\n\nThe Me Too movement (or #MeToo movement), with many local and international alternatives, is a movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault. #MeToo spread virally in October 2017 as a hashtag used on social media in an attempt to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_movement\n\nSo MeToo is all about encouraging women to come forward and share their experiences of harassment of various kinds. Speaking personally, I knew that women often have to put up with dangerous and just plain weird behaviour from creepy guys – like being approached in the street, feeling unsafe in certain places or just putting up with dodgy comments and behaviour at work. I knew that, but the MeToo movement did open my eyes to how much of this kind of thing Women have to put up with every day. I think about my daughter and the kind of society she’s going to grow up in and I want her to grow up in a culture in which she feels safe, she feels she can talk about things that happen to her, in which she won’t have to just accept certain behaviour from men, and I want her to have cool characters and comedians on TV and in films that she can relate too, just like I did during my childhood.\n\nI know this is actually a bit of a touchy subject. There’s a lot of pushing and pulling going on in terms of people arguing about the place of men and women in society and both men and women feeling targeted, victimsed or demonised and things like that. I’ve seen so many arguments in online comment sections. I find all of that stuff quite exhausting to be honest.\n\nI see arguments on YouTube and people getting really angry on both sides about something like a perceived feminist agenda in Star Wars or Doctor Who, for example and then I see other people getting really angry about those people getting angry about feminism in Star Wars or Doctor Who and I’m just sitting here trying not to get angry about people getting angry about other people getting angry about some people getting angry about feminism in Star Wars or Doctor Who or movies and culture in general and I just think oh can we just have a normal conversation? I don’t know.\n\nIn any case, let’s find out from Jessica about her new website, let’s learn some of the words and phrases she can tell us about the MeToo movement and also let’s talk about Marvel movies and some great comedians that you might like to check out.\n\nThere are links and videos on the page for this episode as usual if you want examples of the comedians we are talking about, and links for Jessica’s website and stuff. So check those out.\n\nAlright then, so this is Jessica Beck, energetic at 7 o’clock in the morning. American English and British English combined in one conversation, and here we go…\n\nHonestly English\n\nNerdy English lessons focusing on vocabulary and pop culture!\n\nwww.HonestlyEnglish.com\n\nSlang, idioms, natural phrases, the origins and context of that vocabulary.\n\nFor example, “Nailed it” (see video below)\n\nThe Language of the #MeToo Movement\n\nA recent post on Honestly English about the #MeToo Movement\n\nhttps://honestlyenglish.com/honest-blog/2018/9/16/what-metoo-means-to-me-and-slang-for-dirty-dudes?rq=me%20too\n\nLanguage to describe “dirty dudes”\n\nA perv\n\nA pervert\n\nA creep\n\nA creepy guy\n\nA monster\n\nBeing menacing\n\nAlso:\n\nTo harass someone / harassment\n\nFavourite Female Comedians\n\nMentioned by Jessica\n\nKathleen Madigan (stand up comedian)\n\nKristen Wiig\n\nBridesmaids (film)\n\nAnnie (Kristen Wiig) vs the “perfect” best friend\n\nMelissa McCarthy (comedian / actress)\n\nSt Vincent (film)\n\nMentioned by Luke\n\nMaria Bamford\n\nMaria captures the experience of being a woman dealing with mental health issues, by recreating the voices and attitudes of other people in her life, particularly her mother and sister who she imitates. They sound patronising and subtly judgemental and of course there are jokes in there but they are so cleverly weaved into her routine. She does brilliant voices and shifts her attitude quite radically. Her normal voice sounds very vulnerable, and the other voices are so much more confident and strident.\n\nOK, she’s strange but that’s the point.\n\nMaria Bamford Netflix show – Lady Dynamite\n\nMaria Bamford interview on WTF with Marc Maron\n\nFrench & Saunders On TV all through my childhood. Came out of the anarchic post-punk era in UK comedy. Two English women who were just funny in the way they bickered with each other and also took the piss out of Hollywood movies and celebrities. They’re national treasures.\n\nFrench & Saunders making fun of Mama Mia\n\nVictoria Wood\n\nAnother national treasure who was on telly all the time. She was like a housewife who was also a comedian. Not like Rosanne Barr, but a normal middle class English woman – a bit like the mum of one of your friends, but she did stand up, sketches and did comedy songs on the piano. She was one of the first stand ups I ever saw, along with various other UK comedians at the time. Her comedy was quite local in flavour, meaning she made reference to things like accents and local identity. Died in 2016 along with loads of other celebs. Bowie, Ali, Prince etc\n\nSarah Pascoe\n\nA stand up who describes the kind of life that most women (of my generation) experience in the UK, while making it very funny. She talks about all the things that women go through relating to relationships and work. She’s very relatable and it’s like observational comedy about relationships and life (but it’s not shit observational comedy).\n\nSarah Pascoe in Edinburgh\n\nPodcasts recomended by Jessica\n\nWait Wait Don’t Tell Me (NPR)\n\nPaula Poundstone\n\nSpontanianation\n\nTawny Newsome\n\nYouTube “Honestly English” – videos every Thursday\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBqOicwVfb__YxbsL-5R3tA\n\nWebsite http://www.honestlyenglish.com\n\nFacebook Honestly English https://www.facebook.com/HonestlyEnglish/\n\nAmber, Paul and I listen to a comedy video which is often sent to me by listeners to this podcast. The video is about the experience of trying to understand people when they speak English. Let’s see what the pod-pals think of this comedy from another country. The conversation then turns to comedy, culture, language and some more Alan Partridge. I read out some listener comments at the end of the episode. Notes, transcripts and links available.\n\n[DOWNLOAD]\n\nTranscripts & Notes\n\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome back to another episode featuring the PODPALS Amber & Paul.\n\nIn this episode we discuss comedy in different countries, including what makes comedy funny, what can make comedy culturally inappropriate, whether Brits have a different view of comedy to other cultures, and whether understanding comedy is just about understanding the language or if there’s more to it than that.\n\nThis is clearly the topic which I’m a bit obsessed with: How comedy or humour can reveal our cultural differences in the most striking ways. Perhaps comedy is the key to truly understanding our cultural values somehow.\n\nI often talk about how learners of English often don’t find British comedy funny, and that this is a pity for me. One of the worst things I can hear is someone dismissing British humour or comedy as simply “not funny”. I don’t really mind if people say our food or weather is bad, but don’t touch the comedy, I think. But honestly, when I see comedy from other countries – like TV comedy in France where I live, I have to admit that I often don’t find it funny and I do find myself saying things like “oh, this is French comedy…” meaning – French comedy simply isn’t funny or only works on one level. Is that true or am I being hypocritical? I don’t really know.\n\nAnyway, these questions are at the heart of the discussion in this episode, which also involves the three of us listening to and discussing a video – a video that I have been sent many times by listeners. Listeners have sent this video to me more than any other. I wonder if you know what that video could be.\n\nUnfortunately Paul had to leave halfway through this episode because he had a live radio interview scheduled. He’s a busy man who is in demand all over the place. But after he leaves, Amber & I continue the discussion which goes on to discuss my recent episodes about British comedy and we revisit the subject of Alan Partridge.\n\nSo without any further ado, let’s get back to my coworking space and jump into the conversation once more.\n\nThe video that people have sent me more than any other\n\nI get sent things like videos and memes and stuff. Sometimes it’s the same thing, like the “Eleven” video and also “What British People Say vs What They Mean”.\n\nBut this one more than any other.\n\nI’m not going to tell you what it is yet. We’re just going to listen to it and I want you to tell me what you think is going on, and what you think of it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m4GYYUlx90\n\nOuttro Transcript\n\nSo there you are folks. Quite a lot packed into that episode. Lots of questions and points about comedy in different cultures and that video from Russia too. About that video, on balance I’d say that I personally didn’t find it funny when I first saw it. I found it a little odd. It’s like a big family entertainment show with a lot of attention being paid to what I expect are (or at least look like) celebrities in Russia in the audience. The comedians are just sitting on the stage, which is fine I think because you don’t always need lots of stage movement and stuff as long as the material is good.\n\nI got the joke, which is that this is how it feels when you listen to people speaking English, but I found it really quite weird the interpretation of the British guy, but also fascinating.\n\nHe basically does this … [Luke copies the impression]\n\n…and is stuttery, hesitant and incoherent.\n\nIt’s interesting to sort of look at British people through the eyes of Russians.\n\nI guess this means that Brits must seem hesitant when they speak and I expect this also comes from hearing Brits with accents like perhaps the cockney or northern accents, but the result sounds nothing like any of those accents really. It’s a sort of garbled, lost in translation version of a British person with certain traits highlighted and emphasised perhaps because they don’t quite match the Russian way, or something.\n\nI found the impression of the English guy more weird than funny. It felt like, “Is that what they think we sound like?”\n\nThe Indian guy is sort of a funny impression in that he’s got the tone and rhythm right but it’s a pretty broad impression and in fact more of a caricature than a full impression. Also there’s just the issue that copying an Indian accent if you’re not Indian is somehow considered a bit inappropriate in the UK.\n\nI talked about this with Sugar Sammy in a recent episode.\n\n534. Sugar Sammy Interview (Part 2) Language & Comedy\n\nI still don’t know where the comedian in the Russian video is from but he could be Indian maybe.\n\nBut I get the joke. This is how it sounds for you when you hear these people.\n\nI didn’t find it funny at first but actually I’m finding it more and more funny as I watch it again and again.\n\nIt’s also funny to me that I often talk about the challenge of showing UK comedy to learners of English and how they don’t get it, and then someone sends me a comedy video from another country and I have the same reaction, more or less!\n\nI expect there are people in the audience who know more about this (video) than us so leave comments telling me more about this Russian TV Comedy Club video.\n\nAlso, I’m heartened to read some of your comments relating to the recent episodes about comedy.\n\nRight now: I’ve just uploaded the 2nd Alan Partridge episode. There haven’t been many comments yet. Slightly disturbing silence. Have I confused everyone?\n\nEdit:\n\n**TIMESHIFT**\n\nIt’s now a week later.\n\nI’ve received more messages than I did last week when I recorded this part of this episode.\n\nThanks for sending your comments. I’ll go through those messages in a moment.\n\nBut first, here are the messages I had received at the time I recorded this outtro last week, which was just after I’d released the Edinburgh Fringe Jokes episode and the first two Alan episodes.\n\n*TIMESHIFT back to the present*\n\nHere’s a selection of comments\n\nSalwa • Alan Partridge Part 1\n\nOh that was really funny and enjoyable. Thank you very much for introducing Alan Partridge to us. I did not find the comedy difficult to understand at all. In fact, some of the jokes made me laugh out loud.\n\nMariangel García • Best Jokes from the Edinburgh Fringe\n\nHi Luke, I hope you’re doing alright\n\nI’d like to tell you that you should continue making these podcasts about comedy, they’re quite enjoyable and help us improve our English, as you just said, understanding jokes in our second language can be the hardest thing.\n\nBy the way, please don’t forget my proposal of making an episode about British pop music. I’m definitely looking forward to listening to it.\n\nLots of hugs from Venezuela.\n\nAnastasia Pogorevich • Best Jokes from the Edinburgh Fringe\n\nThank you, Luke! I’m really keen on your excellent Joke explanations. I think English humour is fabulous and would like to know more about that stuff. You make all things absolutely clear and I like your positive attitude to your work and to life! Cheers!\n\nTania •Best Jokes from the Edinburgh Fringe\n\nThat’s a pleasure! Thank you, Luke! I’ve got nearly all of the jokes but some after you read them several times. So It’s fun, of course. I know what learners usually say about English humor:)) I myself thought about it that way from the start, but you know, the humor is not just lying on the surface and turns out to be intellectual. Gives work to your brain. And finally you get it! Cool! This is the first audio i’ve listened on your site, downloaded the app and enjoy! English is becoming closer to me!\n\nVladimir Yermolenko • Best Jokes from the Edinburgh Fringe\n\nHi Luke! I really enjoyed this new episode on Edinburgh Festival Fringe, thank you so much. The jokes got all clear when you explained some of them. My favorite one was “watch and a log” :)\n\nI also recall some funny jokes in my country, but I don’t know what the style of joke that is. I’ve just translated one from my language.\n\nDr.Watson asks Sherlock “Can you hear this sinister howl, Mr.Holmes?”\n\nHolmes says “Yes, that’s probably the hound of the Baskervilles”\n\nThen, on another day:\n\n“But what is this sinister silence around us?”\n\n“It’s the fish of Baskervilles, Doctor”\n\nAnya Chu •Best Jokes from the Edinburgh Fringe\n\nHi Luke,\n\nA little ninja from Taiwan here! I’ve been listening to your podcast for just over 1 year and have been enjoying it sooo much. Really appreciate your work on all the great content!\n\nI’ve just finished the new episode of jokes from Edinburgh Fringe, and I loved it! I was on a bus when I listened to this episode and I kept getting giggles, which I tried very hard to disguise as coughs. British humor is just always on point.\n\nAnyway, thank you again for all the effort on such excellent episodes. Please keep up the great work! :)\n\nSvetlana Mukhamejanova • LEP Premium 06 Part 3\n\nHi Luke! Re P06[3] please don’t stop making fun, I love your sense of humor)\n\n***TIMESHIFT!***\n\nIt’s now the future again. I’m recording this a week after recording the rest of this outtro and there are now more comments on the Alan Partridge episodes, which I’d like to share with you.\n\nAlan (Part 1)\n\nHiro • 6 days ago\n\nHello Luke,\n\nI really enjoyed the Knowing Me, Knowing You (aha）show with the child genius. It was so funny I listened to it 3 times! Without your precise explanations, though, I wouldn’t have been able to get all the jokes. Thank you!\n\nViktoria Luchina • 7 days ago\n\nI adore listening to your episodes about British Comedy! And the way you explain to us some bits of language is perfect. I’ve listened to “Alan Partridge Interviews Child Prodigy Simon Fisher” at least 5 times and I liked it more than the first clip. It’s really interesting that in this case we laugh with Alan and at him. I’m looking forward to next episodes like this one! World needs to explore British Comedy in depth with you!\n\nAlan (Part 2)\n\nHiro • 6 days ago\n\nHello Luke!\n\nThis second episode is a little more challenging for me than the previous one because the jokes are more subtle. However, the more I listened to your explanatiosn, the clearer the humorous points became to me! Yes, Alan Partridge is an absolute walking disaster! He makes me cringe so much I cannot listen to each one of his episodes in one go.\n\nAgain, without your excellent guide, I wouldn’t be able to understand all the nuances and layers of this comedy. Thank you very much, Luke!\n\nMarat • 7 days ago\n\nHello, Luke! My name is Marat, I am from Russia. I really enjoy listening to your podcast in general and these Alan Partridge episodes in particular! In the first part you have mentioned The Office series as being full of cringey situations. I haven’t seen the British one, but have seen the American one (with Steve Carell). And that was really all about cringey moments). Have you seen the American one? Which one is more cringey in your opinion? (‘cringey’ is a new word to me, so I use it everywhere now :) ).\n\nAlan (Part 3)\n\nZdenek Lukas • a day ago\n\nHi Luke, I just want to let you know that I have been thoroughly enjoying the episodes about Alan Partridge (currently in the middle of the 3rd one). I love this character and I actually played the clip from the first episode (the one with the child prodigy) to teach types of questions and the pronoun “whom”. I am a big fan of these episodes and I think you clearly managed to do justice to this character. Thank you for your podcast!\n\npeppe124 • 2 days ago\n\nAfter you spent several hours on 3 episodes, I think we all should spend a couple of minutes writing a comment. We own [owe] that to you.\n\nYou are THE teacher every school of English should have! The method you used on this series was just brilliant.\n\nGiving the introduction and background (with cultural references as well), letting us listen and guess and then going back over the clips was really helpful to test and improves my listening skill!\n\nI also liked the content itself,that is the comedy, although I must say I liked the first 2 more; but that’s because there were more, kind of, jokes.\n\nThank you very much Luke for all this. Keep up the great job!\n\nTatiana • 2 days ago\n\nHi Luke, it’s the first time I’ve come out of the woodwork, really. Just to say a few words about the Alan Partridge episodes. I have enjoyed all of them. They give a little insight into real English, the genuine one, that is what British people really laugh at! That’s amazing. Thank you for that! They are right, the people who say, ‘If you understand comedy, you understand the language’.\n\nYour explanations before listening are so detailed that I find almost no difficulties to understand most of Alan’s words. And it is valuable! I tried to find those clips on YouTube (they’re all embedded on the page), and they are even better with video, I would say, (because) you can watch the facial expressions and body gestures.\n\nBut then I watched some more – those that were not scrutinised on the podcast. It was a nightmare – I could understand hardly half of it, and most jokes just flew over my head. I felt so disappointed, I see now that proficiency level is as far from me as the Moon.\n\nThank you for doing your job for us: your podcast is, at this point, one of the major ways of improving my English. I listen and re-listen, take notes, revise them from time to time and so on.\n\nPlease keep going with your comedy episodes, they are great!\n\nDamian • 3 days ago\n\n[The] Episodes about Alan Partridge (generally, all episodes about British comedians) are brilliant! Many thanks!\n\nNikolay Polanski • 5 days ago\n\nAll three episodes are very nice, even though it is sometimes hard to get, why it is funny, to be desperate, stupid, mean and lonely. )))\n\nI mean – you said before “try to watch it as a drama, and you’ll appreciate the comedy” – it seems like drama to me )\n\nIt is funny, but also sad.\n\nBut the episodes are top notch, thanks for the great work you’ve done\n\nIlya • 4 days ago\n\nI love it! I want more episodes about British comedy! One of my favourite topics.\n\nFrancesca Benzi • 3 days ago\n\nJust a few comments, but all of them are a big thumbs up!\n\nI’d never heard of Alan Partrige before listening to your podcast, so thank you: I had a very good time with each of the three episodes.\n\nBrits behavior can often be weird, from an Italian point of view, and listening to your podcast builds up my knowledge of how different we are.\n\nYaron • 3 days ago\n\nComing out of the shadows for a moment to say that I like the Alan Partridge episodes. In a way, it reminds me of the brilliant episode about Ali G that you did few years ago (which I recommend to anyone who hasn’t listened to it yet)\n\nThank you Luke.\n\nI find your comments very reassuring and I’m very glad to read them. I’ll do more episodes about comedy in the future. In the meantime, check the episode archive for other British Comedy episodes.\n\nIn fact, here are the links (11 episodes)\n\nPrevious episodes about British Comedy\n\n156.

This time we’re analysing some of the quieter and darker moments in Alan’s life as he rambles about flasks, cars, seat belts, badges and having an air bag go off in your face, and avoids the problems in his life. Expect analysis of both the comedy and the language. Vocabulary lists and transcript available.\n\n[DOWNLOAD]\n\nTranscript\n\nSo here we are with part 3 of this British Comedy episode, hot on the heels of part 2. This series is all about this famous British comedy character called Alan Partridge.\n\nIf you haven’t heard parts 1 and 2 yet I recommend that you go and listen to those first.\n\nThe plan again is to listen to some clips on YouTube and then analyse them for language. Hopefully you’ll get the jokes and will pick up some nice vocabulary on the way.\n\n3 episodes is quite a lot to devote to one thing like this, but I really like Alan Partridge and introducing this comedy to you successfully (so that you enjoy it) is a sort of personal challenge for me and also there’s so much Partridge content that I feel just one episode or maybe just two would only really scratch the surface. To give this a proper chance we need to spend a bit of time on it.\n\nListener Emails\n\nHopefully you’re enjoying these episodes. Actually, I don’t really know what most of you think. I’ve had a few messages from people saying they are looking forward to part 3 of this – emails mostly.\n\nFor example, here’s part of a message from a listener called Hanna in Germany.\n\nDear Luke, I just wanted to get in touch to tell you how much i like your podcast. I’ve listened to the newest Partridge episode today and loved it. I think you’ve done a brilliant job in getting across what’s so funny and weirdly likeable about him. I’m really looking forward to a third episode about him. And in fact to all the upcoming episodes. In the meantime I scroll through your fantastic archive and pick out my favourite topics to enjoy in my everyday life.\n\nThank you Hannah.\n\nBut on the website I have had hardly any comments on these episodes, which is making me wonder what you’re all thinking. I have no idea really… So please let me know in the comment section. Are you like Hanna, who thinks I’ve managed to do a good job of getting across to you the ins and outs of Alan Partridge, or does it all seem hard to understand and totally unfunny? Let me know.\n\nI did get an email from a teacher in Japan. I think he’s a native English speaker. I have to share it with you.\n\nMessage: Hello Luke,\n\nI teach English in Japan. My students often listen to your podcast. In a recent episode you had a TV show host interviewing a child genius. My students are split on whether this really happened, or whether this was staged. I think it is pretty clear that a real TV show host would not actually physically abuse a child on TV, but my students are not convinced. They think this (smacking children upside the head in public and making them cry) is an example of British humour. (notice I spelt that with a ‘u’). I noted that you said it was ‘a spoof, a parody” at the beginning of the segment, but they are not convinced. Please clarify and explain the meaning of ‘spoof’. Love your show.\n\nThis is the sort of thing I’m talking about. There’s always someone who gets the completely wrong end of the stick and misunderstands something quite essential about the comedy, like for example what is the target of the joke and what are the underlying meanings or assumptions.\n\nI actually can’t believe there’s anyone out there who would think that Alan is a real person and that he actually slapped a child, and that’s where the comedy comes from. Slapping a child is an absolutely terrible thing to do and it’s certainly not funny. No, the sketch in part 1 where Alan appears to slap a child, is obviously not real.\n\nIt seems I might need to clarify something. I thought it was obvious, but you should remember that Alan is not a real person. He’s a character made up by comedians. The scene in part 1 when he interviews a child genius, the child is not a real child. He’s played by an actress called Doon Mackichan who is changing her voice to sound like a child. And anyway, Alan doesn’t actually slap anyone. It’s just a sound effect for the radio. Nobody got slapped in real life.\n\nAnd in the sketch, we’re not really laughing at a child being slapped. That’s not the joke. Just slapping a child is clearly not funny. It’s awful. So we’re not laughing at a child being slapped, we’re laughing at the fact that Alan is a fatally flawed character who is so pathetic that he will slap a child in order to come out on top or to save face. It’s ridiculous.\n\nI understand that in Japan social conventions are so different in some cases that it might be hard to notice where the comedy is in slapping a child, but it’s really about the character of Alan and how he reacts to being wrong in a situation.\n\nAnyway, slapping a child isn’t really British humour, but featuring a character who would slap a child is more typical of British comedy. We often feature characters in our sitcoms who will do terrible things in order to get what they want and they often fail. We laugh at these people, not with them. They are the target of the humour. Alan is not a hero who we support, quite the opposite, we observe him doing all sorts of terrible and pathetic things. Another example… Basil Fawlty from Fawlty Towers springs to mind. He does lots of terrible things to make sure his hotel business doesn’t get closed down. We cringe at the things he does, but also are amused by what happens to this person who is essentially not very nice when he is put under tremendous pressure that he’s probably responsible for in the first place.\n\nAnyway, for most of you I probably didn’t need to give that clarification but for the students at school (however old you are, I’m not sure) let me assure you – Alan Partridge is not real and none of it is real. He is a character played by an actor called Steve Coogan. Alan Partridge is a parody or a spoof.\n\nParody, Spoof & Satire\n\nA parody is a humorous piece of writing, drama, or music which imitates the style of a well-known person or represents a familiar situation in an exaggerated way.\n\nWhen someone parodies a particular work, thing, or person, they imitate it in an amusing or exaggerated way.\n\nSo a parody is an imitation of something, in order to make fun of it. Alan is a parody of TV presenters.\n\nA Spoof is a show or piece of writing that appears to be serious but is actually a joke. It’s also like a “fake” show. The Day Today is a spoof of the news.\n\nWe often use spoof and parody in the same or similar ways.\n\nA satire is a piece of comedy designed to criticise something by making fun of it. Satire is like spoof or parody but doesn’t always involve imitations and often has serious targets like politics.\n\nAnimal Farm by George Orwell is a satire of communism. It criticises and makes fun of communism with this fictional story about pigs running a farm.\n\nSo Alan Partridge is certainly a spoof or parody of television and radio presenters. Perhaps at it’s best it’s some kind of satire about television and culture in general. In fact he’s become more of a parody of a kind of small-minded English man.\n\nAlan Clips\n\nLet’s listen to some more clips. This is going to be good listening practice and there will be loads of vocab, but also let’s see this as a kind of little adventure where I take you into something new and you have to try and work out what’s going on.\n\nI’ve chosen two more clips, and I’ve chosen these ones because they are slightly quieter moments for Alan, not the big moments with all the catchphrases, but moments when Alan is perhaps at a weak point, which reveal how restless he is and how flawed he is on a basic social level.\n\nWe get a bit deeper into his psyche in this episode.\n\nSo in these clips I’m asking you not to look out for jokes like in the Edinburgh episode. Alan doesn’t really do jokes although there are very funny lines. So, don’t look for jokes. Instead look for the way this character expresses himself, how he chooses his words, how he can’t really connect with people around him, how he’s isolated, how he’s actually not a very good person.\n\nThere’s a bit of tragedy to Alan. It’s just there, under the surface. You have to read between the lines.\n\n8. Alan calls his son and then Curry’s to ask about getting a surround sound speaker system\n\nThis is a glimpse into Alan’s family life and his relationship with his son. You could say it is strained. Imagine having Partridge as your father. It would be awful.\n\nIt’s a Saturday afternoon and Alan decides to call his son Fernando, who is 22 years old – around the same age I was when I first watched this. Fernando is named after the Abba song of the same name.\n\nAlan calls Fernando to see if he wants to go for a pint. He catches Fernando in bed with his girlfriend and ends up lecturing him about how he’s wasting his time when the weather is so good outside. The key line is “It’s a Saturday afternoon and you’re in bed with a girl, you’re wasting your life!” Alan couldn’t be more wrong of course.\n\nInstead, Alan suggests that Fernando take her out to a local tourist spot, like a local fort or a Victorian folly. These are like the bog-standard local tourist attractions in the UK. You find things like this everywhere and they’re mostly boring. The fort is probably some local old remains of a castle. A Victorian folly is basically a fake medieval building made during the Victorian era to resemble something from the medieval times. In both cases they are very boring and no doubt populated by other such middle-English middle-Educated weekenders with their anoraks and cameras. For Alan this is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Of course, staying in bed with a girl is a far better way to spend your time.\n\nAlan can’t relate to Fernando and patronises him (talks down to him and lectures him), while also rambling on like a broadcaster.\n\nHis rambling goes too far and he ends up talking about how he used to make love to Fernando’s mother Carol in various places, even telling the story of how Fernando was conceived, making it sound like Fernando might have been a mistake, or that perhaps Alan wasn’t happy when Fernando was born.\n\nWe never hear Fernando’s voice. It’s just Alan’s half of the conversation, leaving us to work out the other side for ourselves, which is a good comedy technique.\n\nWe can see there are serious issues in their relationship. It sounds like Alan was probably a terrible father, making his son feel unloved and unvalued, and just lecturing him rather than relating to him on a normal level. Alan tries to be friends with Fernando, but he’s completely unaware of how much he mistreats Fernando.\n\nAlan then calls Curry’s the electronics store to find out about buying some speakers and typically ends up either arguing with the sales assistant, lecturing him, or letting him into close personal details. Alan also talks about the speaker system in a weird, formal way, perhaps using the technical language you might read in the product manual, and even using some latin words. For some reason he feels this technical and formal register is appropriate when asking about buying some speakers from a hardware shop. You can imagine that there is a generation of people who are old-fashioned enough to do that too. At the end he even attempts to invite the guy from Curry’s to go for a pint with him, because he’s bored. The guy says no.\n\nIn the end Alan decides to walk up the motorway to visit the local garage to buy some windscreen washer fluid. It’s funny to see these utterly mundane moments in Alan’s life. He’s a bit lost and is living in isolation and obscurity. Nobody else in the Travel Tavern is there, so he just leaves, shouting slightly desperately in case anyone wants to join him.\n\nWhat to watch out for\n\nHow Alan makes his son feel unloved\n\nHow Alan describes how Fernando was conceived and it sounds like he wasn’t happy when\n\nFernando was born\n\nHow Alan starts going on about flasks and Fernando just hangs up\n\nHow Alan talks to the sales assistant at Curry’s and expects him to know latin\n\nHow he fails to invite the guy for a pint of beer\n\nLanguage\n\nYou both sound exhausted, have you been running?\n\nWe did it everywhere. Behind a large boulder on Helvellyn for my birthday.\n\nActually, that is where you were conceived.\n\nWe just didn’t take precautions (so Fernando wasn’t planned, maybe an accident)\n\nNo we were delighted! Well, at first I was mortified but then you were born and we grew to like you.\n\nI left a tartan flask up there. One of those very fragile ones with a screw on cup/cap.\n\nThese days they’re much more resilient. They took the technology from NASA. Modern flasks today are directly linked to the Apollo space mission. Hello?\n\nI’d like to make an enquiry about two supplementary auxiliary speakers to go with my MIDI hi-fi system apropos (with reference to) achieving surround sound.\n\nWhat time do you knock off? Do you fancy going for a drink?\n\nBreath of fresh air?\n\n9. Extended Car Sequence (no laughter track)\n\nIt’s interesting how a laughter track totally changes the tone of what you’re listening to.\n\nFriends with no laughter track makes Ross sound like a psycho.\n\nIn this case having no laughter track makes Alan better and it sounds a lot more authentic.\n\nAlan & Lynn in the car\n\nI’ve chosen this because I want to play a clip with no laughter and in which Steve Coogan and Felicity Montagu (Lynn) are clearly improvising a lot of the dialogue. There are no big laughs in there, but instead this is just Alan at a bored moment. It’s also perhaps one of my favourite Alan moments because of the improvisation. The characters are totally believable. It’s like we’re just observing them in a quiet moment during the day. As we listen to their naturalistic dialogue it’s possible to notice that Alan is slowly becoming a bit unhinged – I mean, the doors are starting to fall off. He’s bored. He’s isolated. He’s probably quite sad and perhaps desperate underneath it.\n\nAlan is “at a loose end” and so he’s requested that Lynn come and meet him so he can ask her something that’s been bothering him. It’s a small thing really, but Alan makes Lynn travel quite a long and complicated journey to come out and see him.\n\nThey just sit in the car and Alan rambles about nothing in particular. The main thing bothering him is that his car is making a weird beeping noise and he doesn’t know why. But it seems he just needs Lynn to be there so he can lecture her, patronise her, belittle her etc as a way of escaping the dark feelings that are probably gnawing away at him. Lynn is very faithful to Alan, and has strong Baptist religious beliefs, but Alan is very mean to Lynn, making her take a taxi and to walk a long way just so Alan can have someone to talk to.\n\nAlan doesn’t even believe Lynn when she gives her excuse for being late, which shows that she’s clearly had a long journey to get there. He’s very ungrateful towards her.\n\nLynn knows that Alan might be at a very vulnerable point here – he’s been thrown out by his wife, living in a travel tavern and he punched the BBC director general in the face with a piece of cheese, and it’s not having a good effect on his mental state. So she’s supportive.\n\nLynn is clearly concerned about Alan and offers to talk to him about his problems.\n\nInstead of talking about his problems, Alan just goes on in great detail about the features of the car, clearly in denial about his situation and his depressed state.\n\nBy the way I think Lynn was the one who actually bought the car for Alan. Him criticising parts of it is also a way for him to criticise her. He’s subtly telling her that he’s not happy with the car she bought.\n\nObviously Alan is unhappy about more than the car, but he never talks about that. The only thing he can do is comment on minor details in the car. The more specific he gets about these trivial details, like the design of the badge on the steering wheel, the more he is essentially trying to escape the reality of his situation, which is that his life and career are a mess.\n\nAlan’s weird broadcasting sensibility comes in as he starts reviewing the car, commenting on the way seat belts work and generally patronising Lynn.\n\nThe tension is palpable.\n\nIt’s hilarious comedy and is improvised.\n\nBut it’s 100% not obvious.\n\nSo I would say, don’t imagine this is comedy. Imagine you’re just listening in on someone’s conversation. Let’s imagine we’re spying on them, just overhearing two people chatting aimlessly.\n\nCoogan’s ability to stay in character is incredible.\n\nThe absence of laughter track makes it 100x better.\n\nI wonder what you will think but this is one of my favourite Alan moments. It’s so natural and the character’s avoidance of talking about his problems while focusing on meaningless details of the car, is very interesting from a character point of view, and shows there is real depth and pathos to the character.\n\nWhat to look out for\n\nHow difficult it was for Lynn to come and meet him, and how Alan suspects this is a lie\n\nThe reason Alan asked Lynn to come out\n\nLynn’s suggestion about why the car is making a noise (the clock is wrong)\n\nAlan’s reaction to Lynn’s suggestion that it’s because the clock is wrong\n\nWhat Alan thinks of the car, particularly his disappointment about the badge on the steering wheel.\n\nListen to how Alan loves the sound of the electric sun roof\n\nWhat Alan says about the seat belts\n\nLanguage\n\nI got caught in a taxi that broke down\n\nDo you know what that noise is?\n\nIt wouldn’t be “engine faulty” would it?\n\nIt’s been irritating me all morning\n\nIs it the handbrake?\n\nDon’t touch the handbrake. We’ll roll back.\n\nJust make sure it’s in neutral there.\n\nIf you ever learn to drive Lynn, when you stop the car, just give it a bit of a wiggle. Make sure it’s in neutral.\n\nMy mum always puts it in first (gear)\n\nSome people do that to stop it rolling back when you park on a hill but it’s unorthodox. It’s a stop gap for a faulty handbrake, but I personally frown on it.\n\nI’ve locked the doors there. That’s a design fault. Design flaw. Just pop your elbow on there, you’ve locked the doors.

But not a big alarm like that, it’s just a panic measure, you know like someone going “Oh my god you’re low on windscreen washer fluid!” You don’t need to say that. Just say, you need a nudge. The car needs to effectively say, “excuse me, I don’t want to distract you from your driving, but you might like to know the windscreen washer fluid is getting low” and they do that with a little light, which has come on – you can see it there.\n\nWell the clock’s not right is it. That’s a possible.\n\nI’m sorry Lynn. I’m normally patient but the idea that an alarm would be triggered because the clock isn’t right is cloud cuckoo land.

It was pretty popular and I promised that I would do more episodes explaining specific comedy shows, so today I’m going to talk to you about a well-known and well-loved character from British Television culture – Alan Partridge.\n\nI’ll tell you everything I think you need to know about him (all the context and background info), then we’ll listen to some clips on YouTube, see if you get the humour and we’ll use them to do some intensive listening to help you learn loads of real, natural English language and culture.\n\n“British Comedy: Alan Partridge” – that’s the title of this episode.\n\nAs usual I’m wondering what the hell you will think of this, because it might be hard for you to understand and it might just go straight over your head. I don’t know. Also, I’m wondering if some of you will be a bit turned off by the title of the episode.\n\nMaybe I should have gone with a more “click-bait” title.\n\nPerhaps – “The British Comedy that only Brits can Understand” or “British people love it but learners of English don’t understand it” or “Learn the 10 Secrets of British Comedy that the Language Schools don’t want you to know!” or “Why British People Hate Mr Bean” or something like that.\n\nInstead I’ve gone with a more functional title, and the assumption that you will just trust me whatever the title is.\n\nBritish Comedy: Alan Partridge\n\nSo, this is an episode about an absolute legend of British comedy that most Brits know, but non-Brits often don’t know and learners of English struggle to understand or appreciate.\n\nYou may have heard me mention Alan Partridge before. I’ve often said I need to devote a whole episode to this subject, so here we go.\n\nI have a feeling this is going to take more than one episode. It might require a few episodes. And you know what – if that’s what it takes, that’s what I’ll do. I will talk about this for as long as I think is necessary or until someone physically stops me.\n\nYou might be thinking, “Who is Alan Partridge?”\n\nHe’s a fictional comedy character who has been on British TV for nearly 25 years.\n\nHe is played by an actor and comedian named Steve Coogan, who you may have heard on this podcast before doing Michael Caine and Paul McCartney impressions on the TV show The Trip.\n\nThe character is a fictional TV & radio presenter.\n\nOriginally Partridge was created as a parody of TV and radio presenters – a way of making fun of the cliches you see and hear in TV news, sports reporting, factual and light entertainment programmes – particularly the cliches of how people speak on TV and radio.\n\nLater, Partridge became a fully-rounded character in his own right. In later shows, we follow Alan closely through his life and the character has become more than just a parody of television presenters. He has become a parody of a certain type of British man. Somehow, so many of us can relate to the experiences and characteristics of Alan, even though the character is someone we laugh at and think is a truly awful person.\n\nHere’s a run down of the shows and things that Alan has appeared in.\n\nA parody news TV programme called The Day Today.\n\nThree BBC Radio 4 comedy series.\n\n3 BBC TV series and one BBC TV special.\n\n2 best-selling books and audiobooks.\n\nA web series on YouTube.\n\nTwo short TV series on Sky.\n\nSeveral full-length TV specials.\n\nA full-length feature film which was released in cinemas.\n\nSeveral big live theatre tours.\n\nLots of other TV appearances on interview shows, charity telethons and more.\n\nThe character has won a BAFTA award and two British Comedy awards over the years.\n\nThis year Alan is coming back to the BBC with a brand new series.\n\nPartridge is widely praised by reviewers and critics as one of Britain’s best comedy TV characters.\n\nMany of the lines spoken by Alan Partridge have become part of the popular consciousness, including phrases like “A-ha!”, “Monkey Tennis” and “Smell my cheese you mother!”\n\nI don’t mind admitting that I’m a huge fan of Alan Partridge as an excellent work of comedy by the performer Steve Coogan and the script writers Armando Iannucci, Peter Baynham the Gibbons brothers, and others.\n\nMany of my friends and members of my family are also huge fans and it’s quite normal for us to communicate in Partridgisms when we spend time together sometimes, quoting lines of dialogue with each other.\n\nIn my opinion, if you have any interest in Britishness, British humour, British comedy, British pop culture and British English, you absolutely must know about Alan Partridge.\n\nThis is not as simple as you might think. Somehow I find it really hard to explain this comedy to learners of English. It’s very subtle, nuanced and layered. It sort of defies explanation, which is a strength in my opinion.\n\nI think that comedy that is very easy to explain is often a bit basic, and probably quite rubbish.\n\nThe fact that Alan Partridge is complex and subtle is a strength for the comedy, but perhaps that’s also a barrier for non-native speakers who just can’t see where the humour is.\n\nThey always say that the hardest thing to truly understand in a second language is humour. It requires really good English in this case – the ability to read between the lines, to pick up on very slight verbal and non-verbal clues to understand the comedy – and to do it all instantly.\n\nYou need excellent listening skills. You also need to have a lot of context in order to understand what type of character this is, how to interpret what he says, what his attitude is in any given moment, how other people are reacting to him and also to understand how we the audience are supposed to feel about it all. Are we laughing with him? Are we laughing at him? Where is the comedy coming from?\n\nSo, perhaps if you’re not really aware of all the cultural and contextual clues and if your English isn’t quite up to it, you will never really get it.\n\nYou might think “Nah, this isn’t funny” or “This is british humour” that for some reason only British people understand but which in fact isn’t funny for any normal people.\n\nBut the high regard that people have for Alan Partridge, the awards, the recognition from the industry, the longevity of the character – these things all prove that this is genuinely good stuff.\n\nPartridge is also popular in other English speaking countries outside the UK, notably Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. He’s not a household name in America although quite a lot of people know about him there including lots of actors and comedians. For example Ben Stiller is famously a big fan.\n\nLet’s see how it is for you. Let me know in the comment section as we go through some clips, listen, break them down and carry on.\n\nAlan Partridge: Background Information\n\nI have to give you some background information on the character first.\n\nRead from the Wikipedia page a bit – first two paragraphs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Partridge#Character\n\nCharacter\n\nAlan Partridge is an incompetent (always fails) and tactless (he’s careless and his words often offend people around him) television and radio presenter from Norwich, England.[5][30]\n\nHe is socially inept (has no skill), often offending his guests,[31] and has an inflated sense of importance and celebrity (he thinks he’s more important than he is).[9] According to the Telegraph, Partridge is “utterly convinced of his own superiority, and bewildered (confused) by the world’s inability to recognise it – qualities that place him in the line of Great British comedy characters.\n\nHis need for public attention drives him to deceit (lying), treachery (betraying people who trust him) and shameless self-promotion,[30] and sometimes violence; in the Knowing Me, Knowing Yule Christmas special, for example, he assaults a BBC boss by punching him with a turkey.[7]\n\nAlan Partridge lives in Norwich, Norfolk. Armando Iannucci (one of the creators) said the writers chose it as Partridge’s hometown as it is “geographically just that little bit annoyingly too far from London, and has this weird kind of isolated feel that seemed right for Alan.”[1]\n\nPartridge holds right-wing views; Coogan described him as a Little Englander, with a “myopic (uninformed), slightly philistine (uncultured) mentality”.[32] He is a reader of the right-wing tabloid newspaper the Daily Mail, and supports Brexit because, according to Coogan, the Daily Mail “told him to”.[33][33] Earlier versions of the character were more bigoted (prejudiced), but the writers found there was more humour in having him attempt to be liberal;[32] Coogan said: “He’s aware of political correctness but he’s playing catch-up.” His underlying right wing views come out sometimes, even though he tries to be modern. [32]\n\nAlan Clips\n\nI’m going to play you a selection of clips now.\n\nI’ll tell you a bit about the scene, including the basics of what happens.\n\nThis is important because, believe me, it will be quite hard to follow some of this.\n\nI expect the first time you listen you’ll be like what?\n\nSo, I’ll explain some details and give you some things to listen out for.\n\nThen you can listen to the clip and either get what they’re saying, or get some of it, get confused, have a laugh or whatever.\n\nThen I’ll go through it again and break it down for you.\n\nNo doubt there will be useful language to be gained from all of this. In fact, I’m certain there is a tonne of language which will emerge from doing this.\n\nCheck the page for this episode. You will find it to be a treasure trove of transcripts, notes, vocabulary, youtube links and more.\n\nAfter listening, and hopefully understanding each scene, we will go onto the next one and the next until we are done and you’ve had your introduction to the world of Alan, and you can then choose to continue and watch the series or read the books, or if you prefer, just never revisit the world of Alan Partridge again.\n\nFor App users, check out the bonus content for these Partridge episodes. There will be at least one bonus audio in which I’m talking to my friend Raphael from Liverpool about the complexities of explaining Alan Partridge to learners of English.\n\nOK, let’s get started for goodness sake!\n\nSportsdesk with Alan Partridge (from The Day Today 1994)\n\nAlan began as a parody of TV sports reporters in a BBC radio comedy called On The Hour, and then on the TV news spoof comedy The Day Today.\n\nThen he became a parody of cliched television presenters in general, with his own chat show, named after an Abba song “Knowing Me, Knowing You, with Alan Partridge”.\n\nSometimes sports reporters have to keep talking and talking, even when there’s nothing to talk about really, and their commentaries become full of bad cliches and mixed metaphors to describe what’s going on. Sometimes the commentary lapses into personal experiences and bizarre tangents.\n\nThere’s also the tone of voice of the sports reporter. Somehow it’s very high. Everything is up in the air. It’s the atmosphere of tension, it’s the atmosphere of high stakes competition, it’s the atmosphere of the Sunday league cup final.\n\nSometimes they ramble and end up saying quite ridiculous things. This can be quite revealing about the reporter’s personality. Without intending to, they end up saying bizarre things that make you wonder about their personal lives.\n\nThis is a bit like the way some TV presenters will behave, on radio or on live TV chat shows, when things go a bit wrong and the presenters say some weird things or struggle in some way.\n\nClip 1: Alan’s Sporting Highlights\n\nThis is not the funniest of clips, but it gives you an idea of where he first came from – just copying the vocal mannerisms of sports reporters.\n\nAlan describes cycling, athletics, boxing.\n\nWhat to look out for:\n\nThe descriptions of cyclists that get a bit carried away (especially when describing their bodies)\n\nThe tone of voice in the helicopter\n\nMetaphors that don’t work “cyclists that look somehow like cattle in a mad way, but cattle on bikes”\n\n“Oh good he’s fallen!”\n\nToo much personal information / Descriptions get carried away describing bare knuckle boxing (I witnessed bare knuckle boxing in a barn. It was a sorry sight to see men goading them on, and I’m ashamed to say I was party to that goading…)\n\nAlan’s chat show\n\nSomehow Alan managed to climb the greasy pole within the BBC and was given his own chat show on the radio and then one on TV which lasted one series.\n\nThe show was called Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge – a cheesy title inspired by a song by Abba.\n\n“Knowing Me Knowing You, Ah Haaa” – that became Partridge’s most famous catchphrase.\n\nClip 2. Alan interviews a child prodigy (Knowing Me, Knowing You – radio series 1992)\n\nThis was recorded in front of a studio audience for radio.\n\nAlan attempts to interview a child genius but the child is obviously way more intelligent and educated than him.\n\nAlan attempts to keep the upper hand, but is constantly proven wrong by the child. It’s humiliating for Alan, but Alan doesn’t have the patience to tolerate being wrong and instead resorts to rudely bullying the child. Alan always needs to be on top, even if it means being very cruel to a child.\n\nThere is a live audience and it’s a bit weird because they’re laughing while the performance happens. The performers carry on like it’s not comedy, but there’s an audience laughing.\n\nStill, the moments when the audience laugh tell you there has been a joke.\n\nThis sketch just shows how Alan’s interviews always go wrong because of his personal hangups – the underlying problems in his personality.\n\nLaugh AT or laugh WITH?\n\nAre we laughing at Alan, or laughing with him?\n\nSometimes we laugh at Alan because he’s awful, self-important, arrogant and ignorant, and yet we also somehow support him as the child is really annoying too.\n\nSo we’re against Alan and laugh at him, but somehow we are behind him and laugh with him too. It’s an interesting shift in perspective as we both relate to him and also want to distance ourselves from him at the same time. This happens with all of Alan’s comedy.\n\nWhat to look out for:\n\nThe ways the child makes Alan look stupid, including references to Shakespeare\n\nAlan’s attempt to win the situation\n\nThe switch to “entertainment mode” at the end of the sketch, as if he hasn’t just insulted this child and made him cry\n\nRecommendations and descriptions of British comedy TV shows with some comments about how to use comedy TV shows to learn English.

(some rambling here at the beginning!)\n\nBritish TV Comedy\n\nI often get requests from listeners asking me to recommend some good British TV comedy shows. So, that’s what you’re going to get in this episode – comments about using comedy TV to improve your English and then some recommendations of TV shows that you can watch.\n\nI love comedy and I think we have a lot of great comedy in the UK.\n\nThe USA is also known for its comedy of course, and I’m sure almost all of you are aware of American shows like Friends, The Simpsons, Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother and so on.\n\nBut Britain also has a long tradition of comedy shows on TV – sitcoms, sketch shows and character-based comedy dramas. There are so many TV comedies from the UK and many of them are truly loved by the British public. Comedy is one of the things about the UK that I am most proud of.\n\nIt’s not just Mr Bean, by the way.\n\nBritish and American comedy shows are different, in the same ways that British and American culture is different. Generally speaking, I find American shows to be slightly more positive in tone, the characters slightly more attractive and successful – and perhaps because of the commercial nature of a lot of American TV channels their comedy can be a bit more conventional and safe. I mean, I get the feeling that the producers of the shows are very conscious that they have to make their advertisers happy and as a result the shows end up having to appeal to a broader audience and this means that the shows are slightly less risky, slightly less edgy and slightly less weird than British comedy shows.\n\nBritish comedy can be complicated for non-Brits to get and it can be an acquired taste. People sometimes say “British humour” or “British comedy” as a synonym of “weird, dark, surreal, complex, cerebral” and sometimes “unfunny”. I would agree with most of that, except the “unfunny” part of course. I am very glad that British comedy shows are a bit darker, weirder, more surreal, more complex (sometimes) and dare I say it – more intelligent.\n\nLet’s not get snobbish here… British people have a tendency to become a bit snobbish when talking about American things, and that’s not very attractive. Ultimately, it’s a matter of context, taste and point of view and I really don’t want to get into the British comedy vs American comedy debate here.\n\nMy main point is: American TV comedy is generally more well-known than British TV comedy – and so my job here is to bring to your attention some of the really great programmes that have been made in the UK so you can enjoy them like I do and use them to learn English.\n\nI think if you’re into British things and that includes our humour and our outlook on life in general, I think I might be able to introduce you to some programmes that you will really enjoy and that will be great content for you to consume as learners of British English.\n\nI grew up watching British comedy on TV. For a while it was the highlight of my week. I used to plan my entire life around the comedy shows that were on TV in the evenings. That was my life. Playing football and watching comedy on TV.\n\nUsing TV Comedy in Class\n\nI have always been really keen to introduce my students to British comedy and time and time again I have chosen to play clips of shows or whole episodes of shows in my classes.\n\nThis is actually a less effective and worthwhile than you might expect, unless as a teacher you do certain things.\n\nThe less successful thing to do is to just play an episode of a show without any preparation. E.g. “OK, it’s Friday afternoon, let’s watch a DVD. Turn out the lights, get comfortable, here we go.”\n\nExpectation = we will laugh, everyone will enjoy it and learning English will be fun and relaxing on a Friday afternoon.\n\nReality = you don’t understand it, you don’t laugh, don’t have fun and just come away thinking British comedy is “weird and unfunny”.\n\nThis is because understanding and enjoying comedy is one of the more difficult things to do in another language. There are so many things that go into your enjoyment of a bit of TV comedy. Linguistically – you need to understand every detail and understand it fast. Often, jokes are very subtle and understated – especially if it is a good comedy. I think good comedies are often quite clever and not totally obvious. Some really great comedy is very obvious of course – like Charlie Chaplin or Laurel & Hardy – physical humour, or the humour of slapstick. But I really love comedy which is quite subtle, and I think a lot of British shows rely on this sort of thing. So, your English has to be really sharp to pick up on the particular use of language, or the way things are suggested rather than obviously stated. Also, you need to understand the cultural context too – like the fact that some British comedy shows present characters and situations that are familiar to most Brits, but which people who aren’t familiar with the culture wouldn’t really understand.\n\nSo, if your English isn’t quite sharp enough and you’re not familiar with the cultural context, a comedy show might appear to be unfunny and just weird.\n\nSo as a teacher I actually find it to be very hard work to use comedy TV shows in class successfully. It often takes a lot of pre-teaching of vocabulary, lots of preparation in terms of getting the students to discuss and consider the ideas, characters or situations in the show, and the chance to see scenes several times, perhaps with a script to help. In the end, the laughter might get lost, and unless the students are particularly motivated by the idea of enjoying a comedy TV show, it might just be a better idea to do something more conventional and learner-oriented in a classroom.\n\nI have to admit that I’ve had some very frustrating experiences in class, when I’ve presented something to a group of students – perhaps an episode of a TV programme that I really love, and it hasn’t gone down very well. I just end up feeling a bit hurt. Imagine sharing something you really love with a group of people, and to have them just look at you blankly, or yawn, or say “it’s not funny” or “I am boring”.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’ve had some classes that adored the comedy I’ve shown them and asked for more, but not always.\n\nOf course it’s all a question of taste and perhaps my expectations are the problem. I expect/hope that every single person in the class will get it. In reality, only some will get it. Perhaps it’s hard to enjoy it in a classroom context and really these things take time.\n\nYou need to watch again and again, to get to know the characters and so on. It takes time to really get into a show, to find it funny and to develop a love for it. Repeated viewings and a love for a show are great conditions for learning English from it. Also, I get downhearted when just one person isn’t into it. I might not notice the students who loved it just because Juan Pedro seemed bored.\n\nSo, perhaps the classroom isn’t the best environment for using TV comedy, but I am still convinced that there is a lot of value in using comedy shows to learn English.\n\nMy students who tell me they watch TV shows in English are always the better learners in class\n\nOne thing I do know for sure – the best learners of English in my experience are the types of people who take the time to get into TV shows and who don’t expect simple laughs at the start. Often the outstanding learners of English I’ve met are the ones who’ve told me that they’ve watched entire seasons of Black Books, or that they really loved watching Red Dwarf or The Mighty Boosh. It does happen sometimes.\n\nHere are some facts: All the learners of English who have told me that they regularly watched a British comedy TV show have been good learners of English – communicative, good vocabulary, better understanding and pronunciation than their classmates and showing good potential for making progress through their English course, and I’ve never met a terrible learner who told me they watched comedy shows in English.\n\nThe ones who tell me they watch comedy shows in English are always the better students. Is there a connection? There must be something. Maybe the ones who enjoy watching comedy in English are the ones who are just more motivated, less willing to give up, more curious. THese are probably the successful traits – motivation, curiosity, patience, a desire to discover the deeper meaning beyond just learning the language as quickly as possible. If you have those traits I’m sure you’re more likely to be a better learner of English and you’re probably more likely to enjoy watching comedy programmes in English.\n\nSo I do encourage you to try and get into British comedy, even if it’s tricky at the start. Also, realise that there might be more to British comedy than meets the eye. It’s not like a lot of American comedy shows which are a bit superficial, to be honest – I mean, there’s never a lot of tragedy, pain, or harsh reality in those shows. Friends, for example – it’s all too colourful. The characters don’t seem to ever really suffer. Their lives are amazing. Where is the existential suffering? Their apartment is too nice. Their lives are too rich. They’re ultimately too happy and successful. I find that harder to relate to and therefore harder to get into. I need more depth than that. I don’t just want my comedy to be escapism. I want it to allow me to explore more complicated feelings and ideas. Comedy can be challenging, complex and fascinating.\n\nAgain, I should point out that it’s not a simple case of – American comedy = superficial, British comedy = deep. There are plenty of deep, dark and complex American shows. The Simpsons, for example – at it’s best it’s extremely nuanced and reflects such a multifaceted view of life, including not just Homer falling over, but the highs and lows, pain and joy of family life in all its richness, even if the characters are all presented in bright yellow colours.\n\nWhat I want to do in this episode is sell the idea of using comedy for learning English, manage your expectations about British comedy in order to help you learn from it more effectively, and also recommend some shows.\n\nI think from the outset this might be an impossible mission – to explain British comedy to an international audience of learners of English, and then have them actually go and watch it and also enjoy it as much as me – this may be an impossible mission, but I feel compelled to do it, and really – it’s up to you to make the mission a success isn’t it? There’s only so much I can do. The rest is your responsibility.\n\nOne advantage that we have is that you, my audience, aren’t just ordinary learners of English because I suppose you are already into British things, you probably like comedy and you must have a sense of humour if you either a) enjoy this podcast or b) have listened to it for a long time (this is a no ‘no sense of humour’ zone as far as I’m concerned) So I’m assuming that you’re already curious about British comedy, or you already appreciate it, or you are keen to get some recommendations from me about shows that I like.\n\nI have one recommendation for you to consider…\n\nDo not consume British comedy as comedy. Do not think of it as comedy.\n\nThis is reverse psychology, but it might just work.\n\nDon’t think of it as comedy – because if you sit down to it expecting to laugh all the time, you might just be disappointed. Instead, think of these shows as tragedy, or a study in character.\n\nBy removing the emphasis on comedy, you should be able to focus instead on simply understanding the motivations of the characters, the situations they find themselves in and how this is all expressed by the things they say and the ways they interact. If you understand all these things, you might find it funnier or more moving as a result.\n\nThink of them as pathos. (Pathos is like comedy, but instead of creating laughter, it creates sadness or a feeling of sympathy)\n\nThink of each show as a study of some individuals and their lives filled with quiet desperation, or hope, or frustration, or ambition, or failure or contradiction.\n\nThink of each show as a personality study or a soap opera.\n\nBut don’t think of it as a comedy.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that you should expect these shows to be rubbish and boring.\n\nNo, on the contrary – the shows are not rubbish, they’re often very good and really carefully created, even if they are filmed in TV studios with some cheap special effects or bland-looking lighting or set design and possibly with actors that don’t look like glamorous movie stars.\n\nYou might not get all the bright colours, white teeth and good hair that you might see in an American show.\n\nBut you will see really interesting people, very witty bits of dialogue, unexpected moments, awkward social situations with hilarious consequences. Some really complex and satisfying characters, and some genuinely classic moments of British TV culture, which have captured our imaginations and entered the popular consciousness.\n\nBut don’t consume these shows as comedy, but rather as drama.\n\nUnderstanding British Comedy TV\n\nOften in British TV shows the comedy comes from the frustration, the embarrassment, the flaws and the failures or the fears of the characters, or the ways that the characters argue and the funny moments of friction between them.\n\nBritish TV comedy characters are like characters in Shakespearean tragedies. I know that sounds like I’m over egging the pudding a bit, but really I do believe that. The best TV comedy characters have fatal flaws. They have specific problems in their personalities that send them on a narrative arc which aims at success but usually ends in tragedy. Just like in a good Shakespeare play.\n\nI’ll go into more detail in a moment.\n\nBut now, here are some specific tips for …\n\nHow to use shows to improve your English\n\nWatch with and without subtitles\n\nUse a notepad to make a note of what the characters are saying – especially when you notice specific phrases or other features of language.\n\nIf there are bits that make you laugh, note them down! Note down the phrasing, the intonation, the specific words, reactions and the lines that lead up to the funny moment. If it made you laugh it obviously meant something to you, so you’ll probably remember it better.\n\nRepeat the funny lines to yourself a few times and try to copy the timing and emphasis.\n\nBe aware of where the characters come from and how they speak with an accent.\n\nTurn the spoken word into the written word and then back to the spoken word again.\n\nRecord yourself saying some bits.\n\nGo the extra mile.\n\nMaintain your curiosity. Give the shows a chance. It might take a while before you really get it and start finding it funny. But hang in there, it will come. Don’t expect too much, even though I’m telling you that these shows are wonderful. But trust me when I say that they are good.\n\nWhen you find a show that you just like, watch it again and again! You can learn more from watching one show you like lots of times than from watching lots of shows you don’t like a lot.\n\nConsider recording the audio from shows and listening to them without the visuals. It’s not a crazy thing to do. I did it at university with 2 episodes of I’m Alan Partidge. They used to entertain me so much that I recorded the audio onto my walkman and listened to them when I was on the bus. I learned a lot of the lines and I still really appreciate those episodes today.\n\nOr if you have space on your phone, download the shows and watch when you’re on the bus or whatever – but obviously be careful of the NSFW content.\n\nRead about the shows online. Often there are summaries of each episode on Wikipedia or on IMDB. Use those websites to find discussions of the episodes too, and also lists of quotes from the episodes.\n\nHere are some specific shows that I can recommend.\n\nThemes in UK TV Comedy\n\nAlmost all of these shows feature these themes:\n\nThe character is stuck in a situation in his/her life.\n\nBut the characters dream big – they have high hopes and big ambitions – they think they are better than the situation they’re in.\n\nIn every episode they try to achieve something, attempting to rise above their every day life.\n\nBut frustrating events work against them and they stay stuck in the same situation.\n\nThey’re thwarted by the situation around them but the biggest cause of their failure is themselves. Perhaps the character’s ambition, lack of self awareness or the fact that the character thinks they are better than their situation – these things cause the character to fail.\n\nThe main problem – the character doesn’t accept his/her situation and is not self aware and therefore always ends up frustrated, despite trying to achieve something bigger.\n\nSo, what about this list of shows?\n\nI’ll explain the basic synopsis of the show and will also try to tell you what kind of English you might hear in the show as well as any other details I think you should know.\n\nI’m not sure how you are going to actually find or get hold of these shows. I know some of you out there in internetland have access to anything through torrenting sites and stuff, or on those websites where shows are uploaded for streaming.\n\nI recommend that you find the shows online, get them on DVD or however you normally watch programmes.\n\nYou also might think to yourselves, “Do I have to watch any of these shows…? Is this compulsory homework?” Well, no of course you can do whatever you want and if you’d rather just not bother, like I’m sure a great many of you will do, then go ahead. Carry on living your lives exactly like before, listen to the podcast on your way to work or whatever and that’s fine. But I know that quite a lot of you are interested in finding some British TV shows to watch – so here’s a list of personal recommendations from me to you.\n\nThese are all shows I have watched and enjoyed. In no particular order.\n\nBy the way, all of these could and should be individual episodes of the podcast in their own right, in which we listen to some clips and all that stuff, and I might do that in the future.\n\nSome British TV Comedy Show Recommendations (in no particular order)\n\nThe Office\n\nReality-style sitcom (or “mockumentary”) Early 2000s.\n\nBasic description?\n\nThis is a tragedy set in an office. It’s also a romance, of sorts.\n\nThere are two types of character – the ones who are trapped in hell and the ones who don’t realise that they’re trapped in hell. The hell in this case is an office in Slough. Perhaps hell within hell, because it’s bad enough being in Slough but working in an office in Slough is even worse.\n\nType of English\n\nIt’s very “realistic” – it’s a fly on the wall drama. The camera men are trying not to be intrusive. It’s like we’re just observing life in this office. As a result it’s not always clear what’s being said. Characters might mumble sometimes, and their sentences aren’t always complete – it’s the style, but this is good because this is how people actually speak. The laughs are not signalled, and there’s no laughter track. It might look like just a depressing office and this is the point.\n\nThat’s what this is about. Remember – tragedy! Most of the characters are from the south and don’t have really strong accents except a couple of them who have accents from the South West (Gareth for example).\n\nI’m Alan Partridge\n\nMid 1990s – now\n\nA man who thinks he is an A-grade broadcaster is actually a D-grade broadcaster – but it’s so much more than that. It started as a parody of the way TV broadcasters speak, but it’s become a parody of a certain type of middle aged British Man – the kind of man who reads the Daily Express and votes for Brexit.\n\nI need to do a whole episode about this. You need to understand that Alan is someone who speaks like a local radio presenter in ordinary life and it shows how alienated he is from normal people. He talks to the public on the radio, but in real life he’s hopeless, but he doesn’t realise. His accent is a bit like a parody of a sports reporter or a radio presenter. This is a complex character and he doesn’t realise how ridiculous he is. We’re laughing at him, not with him.\n\nFather Ted\n\nActually Irish not British.\n\nSitcom – 1990s\n\nThe pathos: a man who is stuck in the priesthood with a drunkard and an idiot on an island off Ireland and he dreams of having a more glamourous life.\n\nIt’s not a British show, it’s Irish. The accents are from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBlackadder\n\nHistorical sitcom or satire – 1980s – 1990s\n\nEdmund is essentially a modern-minded man stuck in the idiocy of British history.\n\nThis features some of the UK’s most favourite actors and comedians including Rowan Atkinson, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. Usually the English you’ll hear is quite old-fashioned. You’ll hear parodies of old English styles, and plenty of sarcasm. Although the style is old fashioned (it’s set in the Tudor period, Regency period or WW1 period) the characters should speak clearly and in RP.\n\nDon’t watch series 1 of Blackadder! Avoid series 1. Only series 2-4 are good.\n\nBottom\n\nSitcom – 1990s\n\nTwo complete cretins live a miserable unemployed existence in Hammersmith – it’s basically Samuel Beckett.\n\nThey speak with a bit of RP and a bit of London. Often the characters adopt high-class English in contrast to the low-class situation they live in.\n\nMonty Python’s Flying Circus\n\nSketch show from the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nA group of highly educated Oxbridge graduates make fun of absolutely everything, including history, comedy clichés and existence itself.\n\nGeorge Harrison once said that when The Beatles split up at the end of the sixties that The Beatles spirit passed into Monty Python. There’s something in that, because the pythons had something special about them. Not every sketch is great, but a lot of them are brilliant. It’s probably best to just watch the films – Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Monty Python’s Life of Brian.\n\nSpaced\n\nSitcom – Late 1990s early 2000s.\n\nTwo twenty-somethings who live in a fantasy world of their own creation struggle to exist in the real world – everything they do becomes a scene from a famous film.\n\nThe Day Today\n\nNews parody and satire. Mid 1990s.\n\nThe news is pompous and self-important to the point of being surreal.\n\nBrass Eye\n\nThe same concept as The Day Today but a lot more controversial.\n\nOnly Fools and Horses\n\nSitcom – 1980s – 1990s.\n\nTwo orphaned brothers from a working class background just try to make ends meet. One of them ends up becoming middle class when he falls in love with a middle-class girl, but he’s working class at heart.\n\nShows I talk about in the Bonus Audio – in the LEP App.\n\nBlack Books\n\nSitcom – Late 1990s – early 2000s.\n\nBernard works in a bookshop selling books to the public. He loves books but the problem is he hates people. He also loves wine and smoking. It’s a bit like Withnail &I.\n\nAbsolutely Fabulous\n\nSitcom – 1990s.\n\nTwo posh middle aged women who work (in the vaguest possible sense) in the fashion industry in London try to live like they are still teenagers in swinging London in the late 1960s.\n\nThe Thick of It\n\nPolitical satire and sitcom – Late 2000s.\n\nPolitics is a dog-eat-dog world in which serving the public is the lowest priority.\n\nYes Minister\n\nPolitical satire and sitcom – 1970s – 1980s.\n\nPolitics is a dog-eat-dog world in which serving the public is the lowest priority – but with less swearing and more charming old fashioned upper-class sophistication.\n\nDad’s Army\n\nSitcom – 1960s – 1970s\n\nBritain’s last line of defence against the Nazis is a group of incompetent old grandads.\n\nRed Dwarf\n\nSci-Fi Sitcom – 1990s.\n\nThe last human being alive is stuck on a spaceship with a hologram of the person he hates the most, a senile super-computer, a robot butler and a man who evolved from cats – full of sarcasm, put downs and cheap science fiction special effects.\n\nGavin & Stacey\n\nSitcom – Late 2000s\n\nA genuinely sweet and heartwarming comedy about two people from two different British communities (Essex in England and Barry Island in South Wales) who fall in love with each other.\n\nOutnumbered\n\nSitcom – late 2000s – now.\n\nTwo exhausted parents attempt to bring up 3 children, and lose the battle.\n\nOther shows (I didn’t get time to mention them at all)\n\nOne Foot in the Grave\n\nSitcom – 1990s.\n\nA man in his 70s just wants to enjoy his retirement but he is constantly frustrated but life’s little irritations.\n\nLittle Britain\n\nSketch show – 2000s.\n\nA sketch show in which a range of eccentric and grotesque British characters talk in catchphrases.\n\nThe Fast Show\n\nSketch show – 1990s.\n\nThe same as Little Britain, but with a bit more pathos. This came before Little Britain.\n\nExtras\n\nSitcom/drama – 2000s.\n\nA man struggles to become famous as an actor and writer, and then when he does become famous he realises how empty it is – all the celebrities he meets are total weirdos – and they are played by themselves.\n\nThe Royle Family\n\nSitcom/drama – 1990s/2000s.\n\nA northern working class family live their lives sitting in front of the TV. The twist is – we are watching them from the TV’s point of view.\n\nThe Trip\n\nDrama? 2010s – now.\n\nTwo middle aged men go on a road trip and bicker with each other, while competing to see who can do the best impressions of famous actors – we also realise that their lives are a struggle between ambition, the emptiness, self-fulfilment and a life in show business. Stars award-winning comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon and directed by filmmaker Michael Winterbottom.\n\nAll these shows sound like dramas or tragedies, but they are really funny and charming and I recommend you check them out!\n\nThe League of Gentlemen\n\nSketch show – 1990s – 2000s.\n\nThe Mighty Boosh\n\nSurreal sitcom – Late 2000s.\n\nThey’re both losers in their own way and they live in a dream world of their own creation – and that dream world is populated by all kinds of wonderful, colourful characters, music, and magic, but it’s all about this funny relationship between two mis-matched friends.\n\nThis show is bonkers but really sweet at the same time. The two main characters speak in modern London accents. Vince has an estuary English accent – sort of like cockney – typical London accent. Howard is similar but probably closer to RP.\n\nPeep Show\n\nSitcom – 2000s.\n\nA terribly dark tragedy about the struggle of two cynical guys in their 30s attempting to live in modern London. The horror comes from the fact that we can hear their thoughts and see the world from their point of view, and they’re awful people.\n\nThey’re both quite well-spoken, particularly David Mitchell’s character who is very uncool and his slightly posh RP is evidence of that.\n\nFawlty Towers\n\nSitcom – 1970s.\n\nAn utterly fed up man is stuck in the wrong job – welcoming people into his hotel on ‘the English rivera’.\n\nThe IT Crowd\n\nLimmy’s Show\n\nThe Inbetweeners\n\nKeeping Up Appearances\n\nOne Foot in the Grave\n\nPorrid"
