His precocious daughter, Claire is allergic to everything, from peanuts to dolls and everything in between. Eric's toadish son, Brian, sticks everything into his mouth that he can get his hands on. The family's live-in au pair, Maria, is a drunken nymphomaniac with a bad habit of disappearing for days at a time. Eric's ex-wife, Liz, is a whiny psycho who's involved in every kind of \"rights\" act imaginable, from \"animal rights\" to \"tree rights\" to Buddhism. Just to make his oddball family dynamics look worse, the next door neighbours are the aptly named Perfects, who are wealthy and snobbish."
