        "text": "Billed as a “frank and funny family drama questioning parental anxieties and life after fifty”, the play centres on Hilary, played by Greig, former Greenham Common radical, who now finds herself mainly protesting against her promiscuous teenage daughter and shop-owner husband.\n\nFollowing the show, many stayed for a Q&A with cast members Doon Mackichan, Amanda Root, Seline Hizli, Bel Powley and Ben Lloyd-Hughes.\n\nBen Lloyd-Hughes, Amanda Root, Seline Hizli, Doon Mackichan and Bel Powley. Photo: Rosie Bannister\n\nThe cast talked about the portrayal of adolescents in the play, and Bel Powley told us how her friends had reacted to seeing her character’s behavior. The cast talked about how teenagers have changed throughout the generations, and made some predictions as to how future generations will be.\n\nAmanda Root and Doon Mackichan also talked about the portrayal of the older generation in the play, and the dynamics of mother-daughter relationships. Ben Lloyd-Hughes also talked about the portrayal of men in the play.\n\nThe cast talked about how different people have reacted to Jumpy, and many of our audience gave their own views on the characters. Finally, Doon Mackichan revealed all about her infamous pony dance in the show, and Ben Lloyd-Hughes almost gave us a demonstration!\n\nTo listen to the Q&A, which was hosted by Theo Bosanquet, click the ‘play’ button below; or to subscribe and download from iTunes, click here.\n\nAs always, please feel free to email your comments and thoughts about the show, as well as any of your favourite insights from last night to feedback@whatsonstage.com and don’t forget to tweet using #WOSOuting! We would love to hear from you.\n\n– by Rosie Bannister"
