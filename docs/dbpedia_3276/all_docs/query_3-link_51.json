        "text": "A TWO Doors Down star looks worlds away from her character in an unrecognisable throwback.\n\nDoon Mackichan plays permanently sozzled Cathy White in the BBC hit.\n\nThe Scots sitcom follows a bunch of dysfunctional neighbours and their extended families in the fictional Latimer Crescent.\n\nAnd stars former Rab C. Nesbitt actor Elaine C. Smith as brutally honest Christine O'Neal and Taggart favourite Alex Norton as family man Eric Baird.\n\nWith Doon's character at the centre of a string of iconic scenes, including the infamous hot tub party and Cathy's birthday bash for Colin's displeased dad.\n\nHowever, out of character she looks completely different in a number of old school pics.\n\nDoon was born in London and brought up in Fife, before studying drama at Manchester University.\n\nThe comedian has starred in a number of other hit shows including Smack the Pony and Alan Partridge.\n\nDoon recently revealed how she based her boozy character Cathy on her own drunken nights out.\n\nThe actress has earned a cult following thanks to the outrageous antics of the permanently sozzled neighbour from Latimer Crescent in the hit BBC sitcom.\n\nWhile Doon admits she has copied some of Cathy’s character traits from friends — she insists the main influence is her own wild partying.\n\nElsewhere Two Doors Down star Elaine C Smith insists It’s Not Unusual to get compliments for her role as Christine - from superstar Sir Tom Jones.\n\nThe Welsh warbler praised the Scot for her portrayal as the neighbour from hell when he played Edinburgh’s Princes Street Gardens in August this year.\n\nSir Tom, 82, then reiterated his love for the BBC sitcom in a recent edition of the Radio Times when he insisted: “All of the characters in it, although they’re Scottish, could be Welsh. They’re all there - my Auntie Alice, my old Pontypridd neighbours.”"
