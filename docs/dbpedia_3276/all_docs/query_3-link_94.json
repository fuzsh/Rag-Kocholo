        "text": "Sonia Friedman Productions has announced further casting for the world premiere production of Lyonesse at the Harold Pinter Theatre.\n\nAlready announced are the playâ€™s leads, Kristin Scott Thomas as Elaine and Lily James as Kate, and they will be joined by James Corrigan as Greg, Doon Mackichan as Sue and Sara Powell as Chris.\n\nBilled as a searingly funny and passionate new play, Lyonesse will run in the West Endâ€™s Harold Pinter Theatre from 17 October to 23 December 2023.\n\nThe play is written by Penelope Skinner and will be directed by Ian Rickson.\n\nJames Corriganâ€™s recent stage credits include Jack Absolute Flies Again at the National Theatre and White Noise at the Bridge Theatre, and on TV his work includes C.B Strike, This England and This Is Going to Hurt.\n\nDoon Mackichan is best known for her roles in cult television shows such as Channel 4â€™s Smack the Pony, Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, Toast of Tinseltown and The Duchess, and a host of other screen and stage roles.\n\nSara Powellâ€™s recent stage credits include The Seagull for the Jamie Lloyd Company, and The Madness of King George at the Nottingham Playhouse. On screen her credits include The Hunted, Vera, The House Across the Street, Doctor Who, and Murder in Provence.\n\nLyonesse centres on Elaine (Kristin Scott Thomas), a reclusive and talented actress who disappears in mysterious circumstances. 30 years later, she finally feels ready to tell her story â€“ summoning Kate (Lily James), a young film executive, to her remote Cornish home to assist with her glorious comeback.\n\nBut who really controls the stories we tell, and how we get to tell them? Will these women own their narrative, or will it be swept away from them at any given moment?\n\nJoining Ian Rickson in the creative team are design by Georgia Lowe, lighting by Jessica Hung Han Yun, music by Stephen Warbeck, sound by Tingying Dong and casting by Amy Ball CDG.\n\nBook tickets to Lyonesse at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London\n\nðŸ“· Main photo: Lyonesse: Doon Mackichan, James Corrigan, Sara Powell\n\nRelated News\n\nMore >"
