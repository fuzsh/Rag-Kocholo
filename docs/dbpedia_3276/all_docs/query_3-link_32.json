It follows the everyday events of Cowboy, Indian and Horse in a small rural town as they go about their lives. Each episode is roughly 5 minutes long and is crudely animated: the characters are meant to resemble cheap toy figurines. Some stations broadcast several episodes in a 15 or 30-minute block. A spinoff animated feature film called A Town Called Panic was completed in Spring 2009 and debuted at Cannes in May of the same year. A Town Called Panic is seen worldwide on channels such as ABC Rollercoaster in Australia, Nicktoons Network in the United States, EBS in South Korea, and Teletoon in Canada, and is available online at Atom Films. In the UK, A Town called Panic played on Nickelodeon. Much of the characters and scenery were later recycled for the Cravendale Milk adverts using a Pirate, a Cow and a bicyclist as the characters. In 2013, a half-hour Christmas Special was made, which received an English dub that aired on CBBC in 2014 under the title A Christmas Panic.\n\nNicholas Lyndhurst, Celia Imrie, Ryan Sampson\n\nPremiered : 2007\n\nAfter You've Gone was a British comedy that aired on BBC One from 12 January 2007 to 21 December 2008.

The writers include Barron, Ian Brown, Katie Douglas, James Hendie, Danny Robins, Andrea Solomons and Dan Tetsell.
