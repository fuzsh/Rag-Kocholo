        "meta_description": "This Airchecks focuses on radio shows from old time radio to current shows written as plays or when a radio show was recorded. A showcase of radio programming that may have been lost over the decades if it hadn’t been recorded and preserved for future generations. In the radio and television industry, recordings of radio shows were fairly common anywhere from transcription discs for later replay or to make sure a commercial has been played on the air for the salesman to show their client. And sometimes it’s not just audio theatre, it can be music as well. Some items previously aired and some items that were never aired, but recorded. Airchecks is a three hour program that is uploaded into a podcast on Saturdays and Sundays for radio stations across the nation, internationally, and for you.",
