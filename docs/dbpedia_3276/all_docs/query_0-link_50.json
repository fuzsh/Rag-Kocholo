        "text": "Today we have a tape packed with comedy, and also another of the seemingly endless supply of tapes recorded around Christmas 1995. There appears to be no end to them.\n\nFirst, there’s the end of Secret Nature, and a trailer for Screen Two: Saigon Baby, a drama about illegal overseas adoption, featuring the much missed John Hurt. There’s a trailer for Easy Rider and a making-of documentary, Born to be Wild.\n\nThen, another compilation of Not The Nine O’Clock News, which opens with posh people falling off horses.\n\nThere’s ‘Constable Savage’\n\n(Rowan Atkinson predicting his future performance as Inspector Fowler in The Thin Blue Line)\n\nHere’s Doctor Who stuntman Stuart Fell about to fall out of a door.\n\nA musical interlude – “I can’t believe Ronald Reagan is president”. Simpler times.\n\n“The Devil: Is He All Bad?”\n\nAnother classic – the judge who doesn’t know about anything modern. “A digital watch? What on earth is a digital watch?”\n\nAnd the show closes with the final song in the series, “Kinda Lingers”\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 15th December 1995 – 21:00\n\nA Christmas trailer follows.\n\nThen, another Day Today Mini episode, including a classic bit of Peter O’Hanraha-hanrahan. “Ich… Nichten… Lichten”\n\nThere’s a trailer for Jools Holland’s New Year show.\n\nThen, Coogan’s Run and Natural Born Quizzers. Coogan and Patrick Marber are brothers on the run, having kidnapped their therapist. There’s a good cast, including Rebecca Front as a policewoman\n\nHer detective colleague is Jim Carter\n\nShe has a past with the two homicidal quizzers, as she and her sister competed against them on Top of the Class\n\nCompere of the show is Duncan Preston\n\nWhen the boys catch up with him, she’s changed a bit.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 15th December 1995 – 21:30\n\nAfter this, there’s a trailer for Faust, Animal Farm, and Gary Larson’s Tales of the Far Side.\n\nThen, Have I Got News For You featuring guests Lee Hurst\n\nAnd Mark Little\n\nI wonder which one was the last minute replacement for the billed Clare Rayner.\n\nAmusingly, they crack exactly the same joke as in Not The Nine O’Clock News – how dogs resemble their owners. Different footage, though.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 15th December 1995 – 22:00\n\nAfter this, recording switches to a little later in the month, and the Shooting Stars festive special. They’ve spent a bit of money on sets and costumes, and Ulrika gets to dance.\n\nAs does Mark Lamarr\n\nGuests are Clive Mantle\n\nAlvin Stardust\n\nAnna Friel\n\nand Neil Morrissey\n\nAmusingly, after yesterday’s tape, they do a parody of the Alien Autopsy.\n\nThere’s even a musical guest, Edwyn Collins\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 29th December 1995 – 21:00\n\nThere’s a trailer for the great Robert Altman movie The Player.\n\nThen, Knowing Me Knowing Yule with Alan Partridge. A Christmas special for Steve Coogan’s chat show host. I’ve seen it several times, but it still makes me laugh an awful lot.\n\nRebecca Front plays a bellringer who is worried about the amount of sex and violence on TV.\n\nThe Actor Kevin Eldon plays celebrity chef Fanny Thomas\n\nThe lovely David Schneider plays Alan’s new boss Tony Hayers, whom he begs for a second series of his chat show.\n\nDoon MacKichan and Patrick Marber are a golfing couple with a tragic back story.\n\nTo close the show, Mick Hucknall sings Ding Dong Merrily on High.\n\nWhilst I’ve quite enjoyed the episodes of Coogan’s Run I’ve seen, I have to say that he’s never better than when playing Alan Partridge. And the material is good enough to support the performance, some really good writing and production.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 29th December 1995 – 21:40\n\nNext, recording switches, and we’ve got a nice surprise, with a programme that’s not on my database. It’s Films of the Year with Barry Norman giving his rundown of the best films of the year. I’ll see if I can list them – it’s sometimes hard to spot which ones he’s nominating.\n\nShallow Grave\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption\n\nThe Madness of King George\n\nBullets over Broadway\n\nThe Usual Suspects\n\nBraveheart\n\nApollo 13\n\nLand and Freedom\n\nShanghai Triad\n\nBabe\n\nAs well as the films of the year, there’s a rundown of the top ten films at the UK box office. Unbelievably, the top two films were Batman Forever and Casper. This was in the year that Apollo 13 and The Shawshank Redemption were out. Shawshank didn’t even grace the top 10. Batman Forever. This was an omen for Brexit.\n\nNever mind, here’s Pierce Brosnan and Joe Don Baker to cheer you up.\n\nIn the movie news, there was the plan to turn the Leavesden studios, where Goldeneye was shot, into a Studio Tour, something that eventually happened many years later with the Harry Potter Studio Tour.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 29th December 1995 – 23:30\n\nThere’s a trailer for Rolling Stones: Voodoo Lounge.\n\nThen, the start of Little Big Man starring Dustin Hoffman. Here he is before he went into make up.\n\nThe tape ends just as the film starts."
