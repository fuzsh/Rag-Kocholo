        "text": "Two Doors Down is a BBC Two sitcom that centres around couple Eric and Beth Baird, as they navigate difficult family members and insufferable neighbours who live 'just two doors down'.\n\nThe show is set to return to our screens in July for a fifth series, as reported by Glasgow Live. The cast is full of esteemed actors and actresses, with plenty of accolades to their name. You may recognise some of the characters from previous Scottish television shows, but just which ones are they?\n\nREAD MORE - Brawl breaks out at Mrs Brown's Boys at Glasgow Hydro while fans think it's all 'part of show'\n\nGlasgow Live have delved deep into the history of the Two Doors Down cast, with appearances in the likes of Taggart, Still Game and winning BAFTA Scotland awards, and even Emmy's into the mix. Listed below are the cast in no particular order, with their previous shows highlighted too.\n\nAlex Norton - Eric Baird\n\nAlex plays the husband Eric, an exasperated soul who deals with his wife, Beth's annoying friends and family during the show. Hailing from Glasgow originally, the actor discovered his passion at the age of 14 in an after-school drama club.\n\nThis led to his part in the TV series Dr. Finlay's Casebook and with it the decision that acting was the career for him. Because of his background and his father's lack of approval of his chosen career, Norton decided to avoid the traditional route into acting and instead worked from part-to-part.\n\nHe is known for his roles as DCI Matt Burke in the STV detective drama series Taggart, DCS Wallace in Extremely Dangerous, Gerard Findlay in Waterloo Road and Eddie in the Renford Rejects. He also has an extensive history in film as well, appearing in Les Miserables (1998), Braveheart (1995) and The Counte of Monte Cristo (2002).\n\nArabella Weir - Beth Baird\n\nArabella plays the part of Beth Baird, wife to Eric and constant butt of the joke of her friends and family. Despite being Scottish, Arabella was born in the States in San Francisco to former British ambassador Sir Michael Weir and wife Alison.\n\nAs a child, Arabella spent many holidays in Scotland and still describes herself as \"culturally Scottish\". Arabella's television career breakthrough came in 1994 in BBC's The Fast Show, and she later also became better known for her roles in Posh Nosh, and Two Doors Down.\n\nIn addition to acting, Arabella contributed several episodes as a writer on The Fast Show and Posh Nosh and has also written for The Independent magazine and for The Guardian newspaper and its Weekend magazine. She has appeared in the likes of Doctor Who, The Weakest Link, Ready Steady Cook and Citizen Khan.\n\nIn June 2019, Arabella premiered her debut one-woman show, Does My Mum Loom Big in This?, a comedic take on her helter-skelter childhood and her difficult relationship with her late mother. The show's title is a pun on Arabella's bestselling novel Does My Bum Look Big in This? She took the show to the 2019 Edinburgh Festival.\n\nDoon Mackichan - Cathy\n\nBritish actress Doon Mackichan made her television debut in comedy series Five Alive, that was aired on Channel 4 between the years of 1987 and 1988. She now plays Cathy in BBC Two sitcom Two Doors Down, a nippy sweetie who constantly gets on Beth's nerves with her rude jokes.\n\nMackichan was one of the writers and stars of the Channel 4 comedy series Smack the Pony, which won two Emmy awards during it's run. She has also appeared in the likes of The Sarah Jane Adventures, On The hour, QI and ITV comedy Plebs.\n\nShe has also voiced characters in several animated series including Bob and Margaret, Stressed Eric, Don't Eat the Neighbours and Bromwell High. Doon is also an active member of theatre, appearing in the likes of Bitter Wheat, The Government Inspector and Jumpy.\n\nJamie Quinn - Ian\n\nJamie Quinn is a Scottish actor and musician, best known for his roles as Private Kevin \"Mac\" McDowell in Bluestone 42, Fergie in Still Game and Ian Baird in Two Doors Down. Jamie is also the lead singer and guitarist for rock band Penny Mob.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Jamie grew up just outside the city in Coatbridge, and was given the nickname 'Penny Chew' by friends at school when he appeared in a TV advert for S1jobs where he stood at an ice cream van and delivered the line \"Just a penny chew then Mr.\"\n\nJamie has appeared in the likes of Still Game, Bluestone 42 and also dabbles in theatre. He has performed in the likes of Still Game: Live, The Slab Boys and Black Watch.\n\nJonathan Watson - Colin Whyte\n\nGlaswegian Jonathan is best known for his role in hit comedy sketch show Only an Excuse?, a parody of Scottish football. He is also known for his role in BBC comedy Bob Servant Independent, but is currently portraying Colin Whyte in Two Doors Down.\n\nHe appeared in all five seasons of Naked Video that were broadcast on BBC Scotland between 1986 and 1991. Jonathan was also in City Lights, Rab C. Nesbitt and Only an Excuse?.\n\nEarlier TV appearances include The Bill and Casualty, and Jonathan also appeared in a 2015 horror film, Let Us Prey. He also enjoys a theatre performance, playing King Hector in the pantomime Jack and the Beanstalk at the Kings Theatre in Glasgow. Other theatre roles include Quiz Show, Yer Granny and in 2021, he appeared in Doctor Who - Flux as Sontarans 'Commander Riskaw' and 'Skaak'.\n\nElaine C. Smith - Christine O'Neal\n\nEsteemed Scottish actress Elaine C Smith is a big figure in comedy in our nation. She currently stars as the naive Christine O'Neal in sitcom Two Doors Down.\n\nElaine has also appeared in the likes of City Lights, Rab C Nesbitt, 55 Degrees North and Women Talking Dirty, alongside Helena Bonham Carter.
