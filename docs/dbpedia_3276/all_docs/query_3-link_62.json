        "text": "Ralf Little shares an update on Death in Paradise\n\nWARNING: This article contains spoilers from the Death in Paradise Christmas Special.\n\nDeath in Paradise is returning for its second ever Christmas special and fans are already curious to know more about the star behind DI Neville Parker’s mum Melanie.\n\nNeville Parker (played by Ralf Little) had a difficult time in season 12 as his beloved girlfriend Sophie (Chelsea Edge) turned out to be a killer, wanting revenge as she blamed him for the death of her sister years prior.\n\nThis twist made Neville think it was time he left Saint Marie for good but following a particularly tricky case, he thankfully chose to stay in Guadeloupe with his friends.\n\nAnother investigation will be underway in the Christmas special which airs at 9pm on Boxing Day on BBC One with the death of an entrepreneur and the disappearance of the family’s marketing guru.\n\nWhat Neville wasn’t counting on, however, was his bubbly mum Melanie (Doon Mackichan) showing up for the holidays.\n\nRead more: Death in Paradise star teases trouble ahead as new arrival 'stirs everything up'\n\nFollow Daily Express US\n\nGet all the latest news, entertainment, sport and lifestyle updates from our dedicated American team.\n\nFollow Daily Express US on Facebook and Twitter @ExpressUSNews\n\nWho plays Neville Parker’s mum in the Death in Paradise Christmas Special?\n\nNeville’s mum, Melanie, in Death in Paradise is portrayed by actress, comedian and writer Doon Mackichan.\n\nShe was famously behind the double-Emmy-Award winning series Smack the Pony, starring with other comedic performers including Fiona Allen, Darren Boyd and Sally Phillips.\n\nMackichan regularly appeared in the sitcom Plebs for five years as a character called Flavia but is probably better known now for playing Cathy in the Scottish BBC series Two Doors Down.\n\nShe has also made appearances in The Duchess, Funny Woman, Good Omens, Death on the Tyne and Flack.\n\nDon't miss...\n\nDeath in Paradise rocked by unexpected newcomer in Christmas special [CAST]\n\nBeyond Paradise star Sally Bretton teases 'heartwarming' Christmas special [EXPLAINER]\n\nDeath In Paradise's Ralf Little shares career announcement with ITV actor [UPDATE]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nMelanie is very much the opposite of Neville and has been described by actor Little as “gregarious, fun, loving and seizes the moment and the day”.\n\nHe explained: “She just lives life to enjoy herself and she's the first person that gives Neville a bit of a pep talk and says, ‘Look, don't give up on something just because it's hard.’\n\n“It’s not that he just snaps out of it and that solves everything, but it's the first time we see him told and that’s sort of the start of his road to emotional recovery.”\n\nFollowing the Christmas special, Death in Paradise is once again expected to return for season 13 sometime in early 2024.\n\nSpin-off Beyond Paradise, starring Kris Marshall and Sally Bretton, is believed to be making a comeback in spring 2024 for season two.\n\nThere has also been news that another spin-off is on the way in the shape of Return to Paradise which could come out later this year.\n\nFollowing the familiar format of the first two shows, Return to Paradise will see a Met Police officer forced to return to her home country of Australia where she starts getting to work on some head scratching investigations.\n\nThe Death in Paradise Christmas Special airs on Boxing Day at 9pm on BBC One."
