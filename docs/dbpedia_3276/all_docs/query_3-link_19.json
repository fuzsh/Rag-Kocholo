        "text": "Former Pupil Biographies\n\nDoon Mackichan (1962 - current)\n\nDoon Mackichan was born in London in 1962 and brought up in Wentworth, Surrey until age twelve, when she and her family moved to Upper Largo, Fife. She attended Madras College and says she owes her success to the determination of her Scots drama teacher at high school.\n\n\"I owe Mr MacKay everything,\" she says, laughing. \"He was my English teacher at Madras College in St Andrews and he was the one person who encouraged me to open up. \"\n\n\"When I was at school, I was so quiet and withdrawn I wouldn't even open my mouth. Mr MacKay was the man who encouraged me to get into drama to boost my confidence. \"\n\n\"In next to no time I started to have a great time and it became clear that drama was the perfect career path for me. Mr MacKay - thank you very much.\"\n\nShe went on to study Drama at Manchester University.\n\nMackichan lives in Clapham, south London, with her three children from a marriage to actor Anthony Barclay, from whom she was divorced in 2005.\n\nMackichan swam the English Channel in 1998."
