        "text": "Our favorite angel and demon duo are back in “Good Omens” Season 2: All six episodes hit Prime Video streaming on July 28. This time around, the odd couple (played, of course, by David Tennant and Michael Sheen) is tasked with helping hide Gabriel (Jon Hamm) from both sides of the celestial divide until he can regain his memory.\n\nHere are the returning and new characters and what other projects you may have seen the cast in before.\n\nDavid Tennant as Crowley\n\nTennant, best known as the 10th Doctor on “Doctor Who,” plays fallen angel Crowley, whose relationship with Aziraphale pre-dates the creation of humans. The stylish demon often finds himself afoul of both heaven and hell. The Scottish actor also starred in “Broadchurch” and Marvel’s “Jessica Jones.”\n\nMichael Sheen as Aziraphale\n\nThe Welsh actor, whose films include “Underworld,” “Frost/Nixon” and “The Queen,” plays fussy angel Aziraphale. Unlike his fellow cherubim, he has developed a taste for human things and runs a rare bookshop in London. Sheen also starred in the Showtime series “Masters of Sex.”\n\nJon Hamm as Gabriel\n\nThe Emmy-winning “Mad Men” star plays archangel Gabriel. In the second season, he goes missing and turns up at Aziraphale’s bookshop — naked — with no idea who he is or what he’s doing there. Hamm’s films include “Baby Driver,” “The Town” and Confess, Fletch.” He also plays tech titan Paul Marks in Season 3 of Apple TV+’s “The Morning Show.”\n\nMiranda Richardson as Shax\n\nThe “Sleepy Hollow” actress played psychic Madame Tracy in Season 1. Now she’s back as new character Shax, a demon who has taken over Crowley’s coveted position in hell after he helped Aziraphale a bit too often. Richardson’s credits include “The Crying Game” and memorably played Rita Skeeter in the “Harry Potter” films and voiced evil Mrs. Tweedy in “Chicken Run.”\n\nMaggie Service as Maggie\n\nMaggie is a new character who runs Aziraphale’s favorite record shop. Business isn’t great, but since he also happens to be her landlord, he doesn’t press her on the rent. She develops a crush on local coffee purveyor Nina, which is one-sided until Crowley and Aziraphale get involved. Service played Sister Theresa Garrulous in Season 1 and has also appeared in “Miranda,” “Doctor Who” and “Red Dwarf.”\n\nNina Sosanya as Nina\n\nSosanya, who has previously appeared in “Love Actually,” “Last Tango in Halifax” and “Killing Eve,” plays Nina, who runs the “Give Me Coffee or Give Me Death” shop near Aziraphale’s bookshop.\n\nShelley Conn as Beelzebub\n\nConn, perhaps best known for playing Lady Mary Sharma in the Netflix series “Bridgerton,” reprises her role as the devil, aka Beelzebub. Naturally, she’s displeased with maverick Crowley most of the time.\n\nQuelin Sepulveda as Muriel\n\nSepulveda plays a junior angel who is sent to earth to help find Gabriel. Her attempts to pass herself off as human are less than convincing. She played Vicki in the Showtime series “The Man Who Fell to Earth” and next appears in Gareth Evans’ drama “Havoc” with Tom Hardy and Timothy Olyphant.\n\nDoon Mackichan as Michael\n\nThe “Smack the Pony” star is back again as the archangel Michael, who is dead set on finding what’s happened to Gabriel.\n\nGloria Obianyo as Uriel\n\nUriel, another heavenly squad member, is played by Gloria Obianyo. Her films include “Dune,” “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” and “High Life.”\n\nLiz Carr as Saraqael"
