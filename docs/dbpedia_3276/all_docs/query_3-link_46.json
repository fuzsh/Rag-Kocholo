        "text": "Previously speaking to The Radio Times Podcast about the dynamic between the two leads, Tennant said: \"In terms of what exactly the relationship between Crowley and Aziraphale is, I think they both see it very differently, and they both interpret it in different ways. And they would certainly have different ways of describing it objectively.\n\n\"But I do think they help each other to understand each other, and the series is a sort of journey of them coming ever closer, through circumstance really. I'm sort of fudging the answer because I don't want to commit to anything.\"\n\nHe added: \"I think what's important for viewers going into series 2, is that many people have projected many things onto what that relationship is and I don't want to second guess that by defining it. Because I may be seen to have some sort of defining knowledge of what that is. And I don't know that I do.\n\nMore like this\n\n\"So I think enjoy this wonderful creation that Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, these two characters that they conjured forth and just... there's a joy to them interacting. It certainly is a joy to play, and hopefully is a joy to witness. Beyond that, define us as you will!\"\n\nRead on for a full list of the cast and characters announced for Good Omens season 2.\n\nGood Omens season 2 cast\n\nDavid Tennant plays Crowley\n\nMichael Sheen plays Aziraphale\n\nJon Hamm plays Archangel Gabriel\n\nDoon Mackichan plays Archangel Michael\n\nGloria Obianyo plays Uriel\n\nMiranda Richardson plays Shax\n\nMaggie Service plays Maggie\n\nNina Sosanya plays Nina\n\nLiz Carr as Saraqael\n\nQuelin Sepulveda as Muriel\n\nShelley Conn plays Beelzebub\n\nDerek Jacobi plays the Metatron\n\nPaul Adeyefa plays Demon Eric\n\nElizabeth Berrington plays Dagon\n\nAbigail Lawrie plays Elspeth\n\nTim Downie plays Mr Brown\n\nAlex Norton plays Tulloch\n\nAndi Osho plays Sitis\n\nPeter Davison plays Alistair\n\nTy Tennant plays Ennon\n\nDavid Tennant plays Crowley\n\nWho is Crowley?
