        "text": "The creators of Smack the Pony, the award-winning Channel 4 sketch show written and performed by an all-female team, have called a halt to the surreal show.\n\nDoon MacKichan said she and her co-writers, Fiona Allen and Sally Phillips, would continue to work together, but wanted to the series while it was still a success.\n\n\"We still want to do stuff together - just not sketches. You don't want to get to the point where you're really scraping the barrel. We're trying to think of what to do next,\" she told the Radio Times.\n\nSmack the Pony's surreal humour, which included a sketch in which a woman tries to grab a barman's attention by inflating her breasts and a regular skit on video dating, attracted a loyal following with ratings of around 2.5 million.\n\nThe show also won critical plaudits for its groundbreaking style, beating its higher-profile rival Ali G to an International Emmy award in 2000.\n\nIts success launched the careers of its three creators, who were brought together by production company Talkback.\n\nPhillips subsequently starred in Rescue Me, a drama set in the offices of a glossy women's magazine, and MacKichan is about to appear in The Village, a one-off comedy drama for BBC2's Asian season.\n\nMacKichan also put paid to rumours about the origins of the show's obscure name.\n\n\"At first we called it Spot the Pony because that's what you have in those young girls' annuals. Then Kevin Lygo suggested Smack the Pony... People think it's a reference to something sexual but in fact it's a made-up thing.\""
