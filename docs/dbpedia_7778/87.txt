“Last year, [she designed]…an addition to Hackley Hall, at Tarrytown.” (San Francisco Chronicle, April 14, 1901)

—

Established in 1899, the Hackley School was a preparatory school for boys originally affiliated with the American Unitarian Association. Frances Hackley, a resident of New York City, donated her Tarrytown estate located on Castle Ridge overlooking the Tappan Zee of the Hudson River, along with the funds to make alteration for its use as a school, and an endowment to support operations. The pressure to grow the school quickly resulted in the acquisition of a second estate and additional donations were sought to build out what became known as the Hackley Quadrangle (where the school is currently located). The Upper School formally opened its doors in September 1900 for a class of 25 students, while the Lower School – located in Hackley’s former mansion – opened in October 1901.

The extent of Minerva’s additions are uncertain, but appear to have encompassed a four-story structure built on the south side of Hackley’s original house; Minerva’s cupola design provided a fitting symbol of the house’s transition into institutional use.
