        "text": "NOTE: This letter will be updated as needed.\n\nJan. 5, 2024\n\nDear Hackley Summer Program Parents,\n\nWelcome to Hackley Summer Program! We are looking forward to a wonderful time working with your children. Here is what you need to know about this year’s June summer program:\n\nPlease review your registrations prior to the start of programs on Monday, June 10th and make sure you have the right classes, dates and times noted. It may have been some time since you initially registered, and there may have been some minor changes and adjustments since then. (Please note, there will be no programming on Wednesday, June 19th in observance of Juneteenth)\n\nStudent drop-off and pick-up will take place from 8:30-8:45AM each day. Students will be checked in and directed to Akin Common where they will find their first course group. At just before 9:00 AM teachers will gather their participants and take them to their first class. Students will work with that teacher until noon, when the group will break for lunch and recess. Afternoon programs begin at 1:00 PM.\n\nPickup is at 4:00 PM. Please park and walk to the sign-out desk to collect your children.\n\nStudents should pack swim gear if they are in the Hackley Sports Camp. If you are uncomfortable with your child participating in a supervised open swim, please contact me at psawkins@hackleyschool.org or 914-366-2675/914-606-0401 (m).\n\nEveryone should pack preferred sunscreen, bug spray, snacks, and plenty of water in reusable bottles. There are filling stations at Hackley for water replenishment.\n\nDress for active fun! All campers should wear sneakers. Some courses that involve repeated hikes through the woods (Nature Adventures, Great Hackley Hunt, Rock Climbing, Fishing Camp, Adirondack Adventures, etc...). We recommend students wear long pants and bug spray with pants tucked into socks. Even non-nature courses may involve “hikes” around campus, including the wooded areas, and play time on the playground or open spaces.\n\nEveryone should check themselves for ticks upon returning home at the end of the day. Westchester County provides this tick information sheet:\n\nhttp://health.westchestergov.com/tick-borne-diseases\n\nLunch is provided in the Hackley dining by the school’s food service provider during June programming. Snacks are not provided so students should pack their own and dispose of them accordingly. Important: Hackley is a “nut free” campus. Snacks containing NUTS OR TREE NUTS are NOT PERMITTED. If you son or daughter has any other dietary restriction (such as gluten-free), please let us know so we can plan for accommodations.\n\nWhile we do have all Hackley student medical forms on file, please email me (psawkins@hackleyschool.org) if your child has an acute allergy or asthma condition, just so I can be assure staff are specifically aware of your child’s needs.\n\nAll Non-Hackley students (not enrolled in 2023-24 Hackley school year) must submit a recent medical evaluation/physical to the office. You can email (psawkins@hackleyschool.org) it or fax (914-366 2624) no later than May 31st.\n\nYour children’s teachers may be in touch at some point prior to the start of their course regarding any specific information, needs or requirements for their course. Please be on the lookout for such communication.\n\nIf your student is doing the half-day option, mornings only, they should arrive at Hackley at 8:45am and be picked up between 12:00-12:30 PM from the Arch. They may have lunch in the dining hall prior to check-out if they desire.\n\nIf your student is doing the half-day option, afternoons only, they should arrive at Saperstein Arch at 12:45 PM and be picked up at 4:00 PM at the Arch. They may come early to have lunch if you desire. Teachers will meet the participants on Akin Common just before 1pm.\n\nNOTE: If you must pick your child up early, or if your child will be absent, please email me (psawkins@hackleyschool.org) or call the office (914-366-2675) or my cell (914-606-0401) as soon as you know.\n\nOur daily sign-out process requires an authorized individual to sign out each child. Please email me the list of individuals authorized to pick up your child from Hackley.\n\nIf you have additional questions, please feel free to email me. We look forward to seeing many of you on Monday, June 10!"
