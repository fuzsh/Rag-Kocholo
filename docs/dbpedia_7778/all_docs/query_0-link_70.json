        "text": "DONALD BARR, who ran a private school in the cramped confines of Manhattan before becoming headmaster of the Hackley School on an 83‐acre campus in Tarrytown, still is amused at the idea of having to worry about the cover on the swimming pool and the surface on the tennis court.\n\n“This is quite a change for a city guy whose most strenuous sport is chess,” said Mr. Barr, whose rumpled, plump appearance fits his nonathletic image.\n\nWhile Mr. Barr may shun physical exertion, he has never been one to avoid verbal activity and his reputation as an educator who does not keep his opinions to himself has folowed him from the Dalton School to Hackley.\n\nDifferences of opinion with the Dalton trustees over how the school should be run led to his resignation exactly three years ago. Mr. Barr endured several controversies during the 10 years he headed Dalton and became identified as perhaps the city's most outspoken headmaster.\n\nNow, after a year and a half at the helm of Hackley, Mr. Barr, who is 55 years old, has imprinted his mark on another institution, implementing a nononsense, back‐to‐basics approach that makes a virtue of good conduct.\n\nLast June, Mr. Barr took the unusual step of asking 28 students not to return to Hackley, and last month he expelled three more students.\n\n“What he was trying to do,” George M. Whitmore Jr., the president of Hackley's trustees, said of Mr. Barr's action “was weed out kids who were proven to have disrupted the course of the school or whose unwillingness to work was actually pulling down the academic performance of others.”\n\nMr. Barr's standing at Hackley does not seem to have suffered from his show of strength. Some students and parents, in fact, maintain that by removing students who were not contributing to Hackley, Mr. Barr has demonstrated his determination to build up the academic reputation of the 77‐year‐old school.\n\n“The elimination of deadwood from the student body has met with almost everyone's approval,” said Richard Weiner, a senior from Scarsdale, who is president of the student body. “Mr. Barr's actions have brought Hackley closer to being the school we all ??reamed about.”\n\nMr. Barr has emphasized the collegeadmissions process, and one dividend of his association with Hackley seems to be a substantial increase in the number of seniors who are applying to and being accepted by leading colleges and universities.\n\nIt appears that more than 20 percent of this year's 55 seniors will end up at institutions in the Ivy League and the Little Three—Williams, Amherst and Wesleyan.\n\nThis should be helpful to the recruitment efforts of Hackley, a coeducational school of 538 students, running from kindergarten through 12th grade, that would like to boost its enrollment.\n\nHackley has only 32 boarding students on campus, making it predominantly a day school that draws 90 percent of its enrollment from Westchester and Rockland Counties.\n\nMr. Barr a native of New York City and an English professor and an assistant dean at Columbia University before taking the Dalton position, says he finds some very real differences between youngsters in the suburbs and in the city.\n\n“They are not as involved with intellectual fashions and politics in the suburbs,” said Mr. Barr, whose office in one of Hackley's Tudor‐style buildings looks into a courtyard from which the Hudson River and the Tappan Zee Bridge can be seen in the distance.\n\n“Kids in Westchester,” Mr. Barr continued, “are more centered on material things, getting a car, belonging to the country club. There is an anti‐intellectualism, and the model of success is different from that of private‐school students in Manhattan.\n\nThe elimination of deadwood has met with almost everyone's approval'\n\n“But the kids up here are also betternatured and less bitchy. They are pretty friendly and the competition is less personal and less internecine. They are more wholesome here and not as uptight. They do not engage in the ab struse forms of ego display and the radical chic of private‐school kids in Manhattan.”\n\nIf Mr. Barr has his way, Hackley will become a beacon of intellectualism for young people in Westchester. He has already begun expanding instruction in writing skills and foreign languages.\n\nBeginning in the third grade, every student in the school has to write a composition a week.\n\n“We are trying to buck the prevailing trend of schools that produce people who are less capable each year in writing the English language,” said Mr. Barr, whose office walls bear portraits of his favorite writers—G. K. Chesterton, George Bernard Shaw and T.S. Eliot.\n\nAlso hanging on the wall is a wood engraving by Winslow Homer of a oneroom schoolhouse in the 19th century, a time that Mr. Barr refers to with a smile as “a great period in American education.”\n\nMr. Barr, the picture of a professor with his tousled hair, horn‐rim glasses and a clutch of ballpoint pens stuffed into the breast pocket of his tweed jacket, acknowledges that he is not in step with progressive educators and likes to joke about his idiosyncrasies.\n\n“I guess I'm a very big basics man,” remarked Mr. Barr, who seems very much at home in the traditional setting of Hackley's campus which was built shortly after the turn of the century on one of the highest hills in Westchester. ■"
