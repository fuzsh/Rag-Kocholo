        "text": "Hackley is a college-preparatory private school for students in kindergarten through high school (grade 12). Located in Tarrytown, New York. Hackley’s aspirational Portrait of a Graduate guides our K-12 program, which not only develops a student’s intellect, it shapes their character. Emphasizing the importance of creating and cultivating an inclusive community where every member authentically feels they belong, Hackley has committed time and resources to our diversity, equity, and inclusion plan. Never self-satisfied, Hackley continues strengthening all aspects of the school through implementing our strategic plan, Redefining Excellence: Learning Beyond Boundaries. From promoting civil discourse to expanding service-learning to highlighting the creative process, this plan articulates a dynamic vision for a redefined, broad-based liberal arts education that will serve students well for any future. The Hackley community embraces four core values that weave throughout our culture and shape our journey, K-12 and beyond. First, we “Enter here to be and find a friend.” Once here, “United, we help one another.” We learn and share a commitment that “Character is higher than intellect.” And ultimately, the journey prepares us to “Go forth and spread beauty and light.” These ideals are embedded in our history, our collective identity, and even our architecture. At Hackley, learning occurs inside classrooms, art studios, libraries, and practice rooms, on the boarding corridor, playground, practice fields, and dining hall. It grows out of our strong sense of community and thrives on the perspectives discovered through daily contact between members of our K-12 community. Our mission seeks to bring different voices and experiences into the conversation so we may learn from one another and build an inclusive community."
