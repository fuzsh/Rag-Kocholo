        "text": "We know that not all students are alike. At Harvey, cookie cutter doesn't cut it. We want our students to ask questions, come up with their own ideas, find their voice, pursue their interests and passions, and go beyond limits to find success as a well-rounded individual. We believe excellence is inspiring students to chase what fulfills them, and instilling a curiosity for greater knowledge, broader perspectives, and cultural awareness."
