        "text": "At Hackley, we believe students learn best by challenging themselves both in and beyond the classroom, by discovering their passions in new areas and through relationships with others. With this in mind, we see our stages, studios, athletics fields, international travel destinations and so much more as essential “classrooms” in which learning takes place. Explore the many ways in which our students \"grow in character,\" \"offer unreserved effort\" and \"learn from varying perspectives and backgrounds\" as part of campus life."
