        "text": "Parents & Families\n\nHackley parents across generations talk about building close friendships and relationships among the fellow parents they meet as volunteers and as fans on the sidelines, the parents of the friends with whom their children grow and learn. Perhaps because Hackley draws students from so many towns, the school community itself becomes the world we share and make together, supporting each other, sharing wisdom, and carpools, looking out for each other’s children, and sustaining the commitment to the school’s core value, “United, we help one another.”\n\nHackley Alumni\n\nHackley alumni share a deep devotion to their Hilltop where they entered every day “to be and find a friend.” They are actively involved with the school as volunteers, trustees, guest lecturers, internship hosts and career networking mentors. Even as the School evolved over decades from a boys’ boarding school to a predominantly day coeducational K-12 school, alumni continue to take pride in belonging to their alma mater, which values character, commitment, and friendship."
