Have an account? .\n\nIt's good to have alumni like billionaire investment banker Herbert Allen, Jr.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllen's family donated one of Claude Monet's \"Water Lilies\" painting to his alma mater, the Hackley School in Tarrytown, N.Y.\n\nThe school turned around and sold the 1905 painting for $43.8 million at auction last night, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Monet sold at Christie's to an anonymous American collector.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThe Allens are big art collectors, and the walls of Allen & Co.'s headquarters are filled with American impressionist art, the only type Herb Allen could afford when he was just starting out, according to Fortune.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTuition at the Hackley School is $37,200 for high school day students. Surprisingly it is not one of the 50 most expensive prep schools in America.\n\nDisclosure: Allen & Co. is an investor in Business Insider.\n\nDON'T MISS: The 10 Most Outrageous Things People Bought In October\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
