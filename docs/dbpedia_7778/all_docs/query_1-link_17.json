        "text": "Lower School students have the option of participating in the Extended Day program, which offers a homework clinic and time for games and reading, all under the supervision of Lower School teachers. In addition, the Lower School offers age-appropriate after- school enrichment clubs in a wide range of areas, such as Spanish, Drama, Lego Robotics, Tap Dance, Science and Nature, Soccer, Knitting, and more.\n\nThe Middle School ASK (After School Knowledge) program, open to Grades 5 and 6, affords students the opportunity to participate in a wide-range of different after school activities such as cooking, knitting, chess, and debate. Students in grades 7 and 8 fulfill their physical education requirements in the after-school time period by participating in interscholastic sports.\n\nUpper School students participate in many clubs and organizations, including a wide range of service activities, multi-cultural clubs like UNITY and the AGSA (All Genders and Sexualities Allied), and other activities such as yearbook, student government, school newspaper and our Student Ambassador program. Some of these clubs may meet during the school day during Upper School Community Time, but the majority of them take place after school.\n\nHackley’s 5-day boarding program allows Upper School students to experience boarding school life while continuing to be present members of their family and home communities during the weekends. This is a distinctive feature of school life, not only for our boarders, as it creates a 24/7 community with residential faculty that makes the campus feel like home, even to day students.\n\nOur extensive grounds make it possible to create distinctive programming, such as a garden for our Lower School, outdoor classrooms, woodland trails that support both science study and wellness activities, and a deer exclusion zone within our forest that supports forestry research.\n\nHackley is a member of the Round Square international consortium of 160 schools across 40 countries, created to offer students an opportunity to learn from their peers around the world in collaborative appreciation of the values of international understanding, democracy, environment, adventure, leadership and service. The program focuses on experiential learning through international travel, conferences, and service learning projects. Hackley Middle School and Upper School students participate in the program.\n\nIn Lower School, our low student-teacher ratio combined with targeted specialists creates an environment that supports the learning needs of all students. Students receive a great deal of one-on-one time with teachers. Writing and literacy are a particular area of individualized focus and the Singapore math curriculum used in grades K through 6, provides extensive opportunities for differentiated instruction.\n\nStarting in Grade 7, Middle School students experience differentiated math and language courses designed for their specific experience and abilities. Small classes and advisories allow students to continue receiving individual support and attention from teachers. Throughout Lower School and Middle School, regular diagnostic testing keeps teachers and administrators abreast of student progress and highlights potential areas requiring additional individual support.\n\nThe individualized nature of the Upper School academic program means that no two students share the same schedule. With a wide variety of electives across disciplines, students can select courses that best align with their own interests, skills and academic ambitions. One-on-one writing-focused meetings with teachers continue in English and history.\n\nIn Lower School, students have several special subjects as part of their schedule.\n\nMusic and Art: 2x week from K through Grade 4.\n\nLibrary and Technology: 1x week in K-2; 2x week in grades 3 and 4.\n\nPhys Ed: daily in K-2; 4x week in grades 3 and 4.\n\nScience: 2x week in K-3; 3x week in grade 4.\n\nWhile all Middle and Upper School students will gain exposure to Performing and Visual Arts, students have many opportunities to take part in a wide range of music classes, acting classes, and visual arts classes as they specialize in the artistic disciplines they find most appealing. Students choose arts “majors” and “minors” in Grade 7 and Grade 8, and then eagerly pursue the arts further in the Upper School, where they may also major and minor in the visual and performing arts of their choice as they continue to hone the skills they acquired in Middle School.\n\nAt Hackley, emotional growth and character development go hand in hand with academic development. In Lower School, students are introduced to a different virtue every other month through the Lower School Character Education curriculum. They learn how these virtues impact their individual lives and the lives of others within the communities to which they belong. This character education work is done across the division, within grades and in individual homerooms; resources are sent home for parents as well.\n\nMiddle students participate in weekly Community Time where they come together as a student body to discuss many different issues affecting their Hackley community and other communities both within and outside of the United States. Advisories provide an additional layer of support to all students by affording them a more intimate, close-knit cohort with which they are able to have deeper conversations about important issues with the guidance of an advisor.\n\nIn the Upper School, Chapel Talks serve as one of the ways in which students are asked to think deeply about their values and ethics. The talks are given by seniors to underclassmen and by members of the faculty to the senior class. Upper School students also have two periods of community time every week. One of these periods is used as club time twice a month and a longer advisory period twice a month. The other community time period is for assemblies. The Upper School hosts a wide-range of different assemblies such as pep rallies, student government elections, opportunities to hear from outside speakers, and more."
