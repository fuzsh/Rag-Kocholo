        "text": "Living on campus offers students the unique opportunity to develop independence under the supervision of our supportive boarding faculty, and to enjoy the camaraderie and academic support provided by Hackley’s extended residential community. Hackley boarders develop lasting friendships with peers from diverse backgrounds as they discover common interests and help each other mature as individuals.\n\nA home away from home, Hackley’s five-day program assures that students sustain quality time and continuity with family and their home community through weekends at home, a benefit we believe is crucial to student development.\n\nHackley residential student life encourages students to develop independence. It helps them partake more fully in the extracurricular life of the school. Perhaps most significant, it challenges student residents to grow and thrive as productive, positive members of a special family within the Hackley community."
