        "text": "It's more a status thing to send your kids to private schools, really.\n\nWhen I was in the white plains school district, i was friends with some straight up millionaires and once they graduated 8th grade, it was straight to Stepanic and/or Maria Regina. It's just sorta how it flows. But then again, WP is a diverse district and it was just a natural reaction of a rich family to get their kids away from \"bad\" influences (aka anyone earning less than 150,000 a year).\n\nOn the flip side, my friend attended OLS (which is a religious private k-8th grade school), once he was done with that.. It was either Stepanic or Scarsdale High School. He chose Scarsdale.\n\nReally. It's hard to compare public schools in Westchester. Hell, It's hard to compare any schools in Westchester. It's the best education possible. These schools rank among the top in the whole US. Stating that Edgemont has better education than Scarsdale, is like saying \"2.6 billion is better than 2.59 billion.\"\n\n-x-\n\nAs for New York State Education. It's one of the bests. Teachers are required to have Masters Degrees, and they get paid alot. Teachers make upwards of 100k, hence, they won't have the attitude that they are underpaid, or that they do too much work for little. They teach it amazingly, and with the best attitude possible. I had honors across the board when I attended white plains schools. The teachers were the best. I always understood everything, and if I ever had a question I could stay after and ask. And, they're pretty damn serious about staying after. I was talking to a friend in after school, and my teacher literally said \"Look. There is a whole class room of kids, and you two little love birds are flirting. Get out.\" and we .. left. Rude? Definitely. But, what could I have done? I was guilty.\n\nBut then again. That is my experience. I am sure there are many horror stories about teachers, and I might have went over the top about some topics, but, my god. I loved the schooling.\n\nDo you have a language requirement where you would want a bilingual immersion education for your children at a young age? If so, private school will be able to offer that. Even if there are immersion programs in public schools, it may not have the % of immersion or offer it at a very young age. As an additional benefit, the student composition in terms of country of orgin will be more diverse and has more of an international flavor.\n\nMy 4 year old will probably go to a private international school in Scarsdale (a new campus of the Larchmont/Mamaroneck school someone mentioned earlier) come September because of the language immersion/international flavor factors. There are multiple private international schools in Westchester. One, which is in Ardsley, does not have a language pre-requisite requirement for entrance (you don't have to already speak two languages when you begin). In general, these schools have a large ex-pat population from around the world.\n\nHowever, if you don't need the immersion program and simply comparing private with public, then private schools may still be able to offer \"slightly\" smaller classrooms and \"slightly\" more individualize attention - but this is subject to the schools. A ratio of 1 to 8 to 1 to 10 for young kids. The top tier private schools - as mentioned by one of the previous posts are excellent and potentially offers more resources. The cons - due to the high tuition, these schools may offer less diversity in social economic class for the student bodies.\n\nWestchester public schools are outstanding and can probably provide you with great resources as long as you match yourself to the right school. It's a matter of personal preference and requirements.\n\nHKers, good luck in your search. A few years ago my wife (who's English) and I were pondering a move to the exotic and sweaty SAR. I was all for it at first, but wow, the air pollution was so nightmarish, I stopped looking for work there after one interview. You won't miss that, even in Manhattan, I predict.\n\nWe've also got 3 youngsters and know hardly more than you about Westchester, despite 10 years in NYC, and are also trying to narrow things down about a possible move north by lurking on this board.\n\nBut we've ridden the rails some and driven around a little as well to get some sense of these towns, gone to a few open houses, etc., and I'd suggest you do a good bit of that if you can before you settle on schooling or anything. Also you might see what you can find out from studying craigslist and greatschools.net.\n\nFor what it's worth, we've decided the Hudson Line train ride is more pleasant than the run toward Rye, and that we've yet to see a school more idyllic than the public Dows Lane in Irvington, which while not exactly a hopping town is cute without being snooty ... so we're about 90% sold on moving there, if we can escape Brooklyn. Remember, there's water on both sides of the county."
