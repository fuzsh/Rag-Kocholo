        "text": "When are the sessions each day?\n\nEach day is divided up into a morning session (9:00 AM to 12 Noon) and an afternoon session (1:00 PM to 4:00 PM). Some programs will run all day (9:00 AM to 4:00 PM).\n\nNOTE: If attending both the morning and afternoon sessions, there is no need to pick-up campers between the sessions. They will be given lunch and have a supervised recess from 12noon to 1pm.\n\nWhat if I need to pick-up my child early one day?\n\nNot a problem. Just email (psawkins@hackleyschool.org) or call (914-606-0401) as soon as you know the date and time of the early pick-up. We will collect your child from their course and bring them to the check-in/out area for you.\n\nAre grades listed for courses the current grade a child is in or their rising grade (grade next Fall)?\n\nAll grades listed are RISING Grade (grade your child will enter at the end of the summer).\n\nWhat kind of programs do you offer in the summer?\n\nWe have a wide range of offerings for rising students from K-12. Hackley Hornets is an activity based program – arts, sports, games, etc... – primarily designed for kids K-8 grade. Academics provide a range of enrichment and advancement programs to help prepare students for the up-coming school year and beyond. We also offer specialty courses designed to explore interesting real-world applications and disciplines in a fun-filled context. And of course sports-specific camps to take your game to the next level.\n\nWho is teaching Hackley Summer Programs?\n\nAll our programs are taught by professional adult educators. A large percentage of programs are taught by our exceptional Hackley faculty. The summer faculty does on occasion use older high school age students to support various elements of their program, in particular our June program offerings. We also use a small number of outside vendors to help increase the breadth and depth of our summer offerings. In almost all cases, these are vendors we have experience within our after-school programs or have been highly vetted to ensure quality and safety.\n\nHow do I register?\n\nALL registration is done online and ALL payment is due at time of registration. Registration will be available on this page when it opens. Look for the REGISTER NOW button at the top of each page. This will link you directly to the online registration system.\n\nIf you have used the system in past years, just login with your established username and password."
