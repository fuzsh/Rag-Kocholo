        "text": "The above table lists the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System(SEVIS) certified schools or programs near the campus of Hackley School, which are also in Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) and authorized to issue I-20 forms for academic students(F1 Visa) or vocational students(M1 visa).\n\nThe schools or programs are sorted by distance. The distance is not walking distance or driving distance between the schools. It is the direct line distance on map calculated by longitude and latitude. The longitude and latitude are usually the center point of the city or zip code, not the exact location of the campus. So if two schools or programs locate in the same city or zip code, the distance between them might be reported as zero.\n\nFor example, EF International School of English in New York is located at Tarrytown, NY, 0 miles away from Hackley School. State University of New York is located at Valhalla, NY, 3.44 miles away from Hackley School. Nyack College is located at Nyack, NY, 3.56 miles away from Hackley School. Mercy College is located at Dobbs Ferry, NY, 5.03 miles away from Hackley School. Our Lady of Victory Academy is located at Dobbs Ferry, NY, 5.03 miles away from Hackley School. The College of Westchester is located at White Plains, NY, 5.43 miles away from Hackley School.\n\nIf two schools or programs have the same distance from Hackley School, SEVIS certified colleges or universities will be listed before SEVIS certified vocational schools.\n\nIf the above table does not have your SEVIS certified schools listed or there are any SEVIS certified schools you believe should be listed, please Contact Us to Add SEVIS School."
