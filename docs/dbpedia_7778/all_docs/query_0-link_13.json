        "text": "In 1998, we prepared a master plan to evaluate options for long-term development and return the campus to its original roots. The plan created a core academic campus of four connected outdoor spaces based on the idea of the original quadrangle. A second quadrangle — a meadow — connects to a third quadrangle, a small cloister courtyard. The fourth quadrangle, a south-facing courtyard is formed by the wings of a new lower school that sits on a hill defining the edge of the meadow quad. The four quadrangles form a pedestrian zone uninterrupted by roads and parking, which have been moved to the perimeter of the pedestrian precinct.\n\n​\n\nTo create the quadrangles, three of the object buildings were demolished. New buildings—the middle school, science building, and lower school—were designed with single-loaded corridors facing south toward the outdoor open spaces, encouraging participation in the Hackley's communal life. The buildings and outdoor spaces define the academic heart of the campus.​\n\n​\n\nA second master plan prepared ten years later addressed development of the campus to the north. This area would become the new athletics and recreation precinct with a new Athletic Center, new athletic fields, and an elevated walkway through the wetland nature preserve.\n\nHackley School, founded in 1903 as a prep school for boys; serves a co-ed population of 900 students in grades K to 12. The library at Hackley was located in Goodhue Memorial Hall, a neoclassical stone building that has graced the main quadrangle for more than 100 years. On August 4, 2007, lightning struck the roof of Goodhue, sparking a massive fire that destroyed the wood structure and interior, leaving only the masonry shell. Goodhue re-opened in September 2010 with its exterior completely restored. A new steel structure was inserted inside the stone walls, and a new second story was added to the original structure, doubling its interior space from 8,000 sf to 16,000 sf while modifying its footprint slightly.\n\nThe new Sternberg library occupies the entire second floor of Goodhue. The main reading room is distinguished by a barrel-vaulted ceiling of acoustically-absorbing plaster which resembles the ceiling of the original library. All of the new interior finishes evoke the spirit of Goodhue’s classical beginnings.\n\n​\n\nSternberg was designed to foster collaborative learning; it is not a silent space. On either side of the central space, digital student workstations overlook the main quadrangle to the southeast; glass-enclosed group study rooms face northwest. These spaces, classrooms and offices for the librarians and staff are all transparent to each other. The library, with its connections to the main quad and the campus, is a natural destination--an active place filled with students all the time.\n\nHackley is an independent, coed boarding and day school, founded in 1899. It is located on a 280-acre wooded site in Westchester County, and serves 900 students in grades K to 12.\n\n​\n\nThe new Kathleen Allen Lower School features a multipurpose gymnasium that is appropriately scaled for young children. It is used for physical education classes, plays, and concerts. The school also has multiple places for outdoor recreation, including a south-facing play courtyard.\n\n​\n\nAkin Common is a new \"meadow quadrangle\" made up of elliptical green spaces. The main space is an all-weather turf surface used for active by the Lower School and passive recreation for the Middle and Upper Schools.\n\n​\n\nTo the north of the main campus, we designed a new track and football field, a new multipurpose field, baseball and softball fields, cross country trails, and a new elevated walkway through a wetland preserve.​"
