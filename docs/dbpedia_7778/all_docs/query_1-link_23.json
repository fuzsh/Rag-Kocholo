Round Square has reached all parts of our community – parents, students, faculty, staff, and Board of Trustees – and our curriculum reflects the IDEALS throughout the school k-12. Our proximity to New York City also allows Hackley to practice the IDEALS in a truly global metropolitan environment.\n\nWhere to find us\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.hackleyschool.org/page"
