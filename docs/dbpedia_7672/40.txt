Arnold Schwarzenegger (1947)

An Austrian-born bodybuilder, Schwarzenegger won the first of his five Mr. Universe titles in 1967 and went on to become a Hollywood action star. An increasingly active Republican during the 1990s, he was elected governor of California in 2003. Schwarzenegger ran for re-election in 2006 and, despite the numerous criticisms of his first term, defeated Democrat Phil Angelides. Why did Austrian politician Peter Pilz demand that Schwarzenegger be stripped of his Austrian citizenship? More...

California has a tens of billions of dollars deficit right now, and Schwarzenegger is the governor (or governator if that's your preference). So, is he at fault for the economic crisis there? Could he have done things differently to avoid this or was it set in motion long before he came to power?

I think it's both. He's a politician, and like most others, he'll do whatever he thinks he needs to in order to be re-elected. Personal responsibility is dying, and many people (most?) now want to abdicate that duty and pass it on to the government. And THAT costs money. Lots and lots of money.

I seem to remember reading a bible verse that says man is not able to govern even his step.

Too many of our leaders have forgotten to look for guidance and are sure to fail in their endeavors. With that in mind, it is no wonder so many governments are failing.

They just don't make action film stars like the used to. Who could be considered Schwarzenegger's heir apparent? I can't think of anyone on whom it would be fair to place that label.

Civics lesson for the day: Here in California spending bills and the budget originate in the Assembly. The majority party controls the Assembly. They appoint the speaker of the Assembly and the chair of each of the various committees. Democrats have been the majority party in the assembly for around forty-seven of the past fifty years. Arnold inherited a mess created by decades of fiscal irresponsibility. The mess has been compounded by the recession which caused tax revenues to decline.

I don't blame Arnold for this. It would have happened regardless of who was governor.

Now THAT I totally agree with.

Has this guy been disconcerted by self-contradiction during his tenure of office?

I don't know what you do for a living now or how long it has been since you've been a comic, but I think you should consider going back to it.

Is it a snap thought-provoking innuendo on me?

He used to be the most muscle-bound actor in Hollywood, he had never been able to lift an Oscar before he was inaugurated as the Mayor of LA, nonetheless.

He's going to need a lot of economic "muscle" to solve California's problem
