        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in Terminator: Dark Fate trailer\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is an action hero, hailing from Austria before his big American break. The actor has performed countless action roles, and is politically active as seen in his role as Governor of California. But how old is the handsome devil and who is his family?\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger has had an incredible life, winning awards in weight lighting and body building before turning to acting, and then politics.\n\nThe beefcake was born in Thal, a small village in the Austrian state of Styria on July 30, 1947, making him 72-years-old.\n\nHe grew up in a Catholic family with an elder brother, Meinhard, who died in a car crash in 1971.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s bodybuilding career began when he first picked up a dumbbell at 14, and he started weight training when he was just 15.\n\nHe began visiting a gym in Graz and at 18, fulfilled his one year of service in the Austrian Army, during which time he won the Junior Mr Europe contest.\n\nAt 20, Schwarzenegger won the title of Mr Universe and won the Mr Olympia context seven times over all, gaining him the nickname The Austrian Oak.\n\nSchwarzenegger wanted to move from bodybuilding to acting and played small roles, including Hercules in 1969’s Hercules in New York, before he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year in 1976 movie Stay Hungry.\n\nHis big breakthrough came when he played Conan in Conan the Barbarian in 1982, and its sequel, Conan the Destroyer, in 1984.\n\nIt was after this James Cameron brought him in to play The Terminator in 1984, spawning a whole host of sequels, prequels and other elements of the franchise.\n\nFrom here, his career took an upward turn and he performed in films such as Commando (1985,) Predator (1987,) Twins (1988,) and Total Recall (1990) before returning to Terminator for the 1991 movie Terminator 2: Judgement Day.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nThis film was the highest grossing movie of 1991, after which he reunited with James Cameron for True Lies in 1994.\n\nFrom here, Schwarzenegger went on to appear in many commercially successful movies, including Batman & Robin (1997,) Collateral Damage (2002,) and The Expendables (2010,) where he made a cameo appearance.\n\nThe reason for his slow down in his career came in the form of politics, as Schwarzenegger was elected as the 38th Governor of Califnoria in November 2003, an office he held until January 3, 2011.\n\nHe had already had a foray into politics when he was made chairman of the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, under Bill Clinton and then George H. W. Bush.\n\nSchwarzenegger has various business outlets extra to his acting and politics, including various investments, a bricklaying business and a restaurant.\n\nAfter he finished his time as governor, Schwarzenegger returned to acting, appearing in The Expendables 2 and 3 (2012, 2014) and Terminator Genisys (2015) before his role in Terminator: Dark Fate, where he returns to the screen with his Sarah Connor co-star Linda Hamilton.\n\nSchwarzenegger has only been married once, to Maria Shriver in 1986, with whom he had four children.\n\nTwo of those children have continued in his footsteps as actors: Katherine and Patrick Schwarzenegger, and both have had high profile relationships.\n\nKatherine recently married Marvel star Chris Pratt, while Patrick dated Miley Cyrus before settling down with his new girlfriend, Abby Champion.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger and Maria split in 2011, after it came to light Schwarzenegger had fathered a child with a former employee of the family in 1997, and their divorce was finalised in 2017.\n\nWhile Arnie has had plenty of pursuits around acting, fans will be very pleased to see him back where he belongs as The Terminator.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate is in cinemas now"
