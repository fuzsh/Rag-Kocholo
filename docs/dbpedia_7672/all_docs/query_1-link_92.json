        "text": "\"Now I workout to maintain as much as I can as I get older,\" he told Insider from Toronto, Canada, via Zoom, while drinking the Austrian spirit schnapps.\n\nMaintaining muscle is a lot easier than building it in the first place, personal trainer Luke Worthington previously told Insider. However, muscle mass gradually starts to decrease from the age of 40, known as sarcopenia, dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine previously told Insider.\n\n\"It's half an hour of maintenance training every day,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"But the important thing is that I always have done it regularly.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger used to workout for five hours a day\n\nSchwarzenegger began lifting weights as a teenager in his native Austria, and in 1970 at the age of 23 became the youngest ever winner of Mr. Olympia, considered to be the most prestigious bodybuilding competition, in his first contest.\n\nSchwarzenegger went on to win six more times between 1970 and 1980.\n\nEven though Schwarzenegger is still very active by most people's standards, his current regime isn't a patch on how the former Mr. Olympia used to train â€” as a competitive bodybuilder, he would lift weights for five hours a day, he said.\n\nOver the years, this amount of time gradually decreased, he said, and Schwarzenegger has adapted his training depending on his goal or acting role.\n\nRelated stories\n\nFor his role in 1976 comedy \"Stay Hungry,\" for example, Schwarzenegger was asked by the director to lose 30 pounds, he said.\n\n\"A great thing about bodybuilding and weight training is that you can really tailor it to sculpt your body no matter what the need is,\" he said.\n\nWhen he was cast in the eponymous role in the 1982 film \"Conan the Barbarian,\" Schwarzenegger had just won Mr. Olympia, but director John Milius wanted him to look \"a bit more round, a little less cut,\" the actor said.\n\nHis physique looked too much like that of a competitive bodybuilder, not an average person, Schwarzenegger said.\n\nFitness is like a game of chess, Schwarzenegger said\n\nSchwarzenegger likens fitness to a game of chess in that there are so many different moves you can make.\n\nWhether you want to change your physique or have a performance or health goal, these can be achieved with the right training and nutrition, he said.\n\n\"There are millions of moves that you can make, millions of exercises, millions of training principles, just like with food supplements and with nutrition,\" Schwarzenegger said.\n\nSchwarzenegger co-founded sport supplement company Ladder with four-time NBA champion LeBron James in 2018.\n\n\"If you want to gain weight, if you want to lose weight, if you want to sustain, if you want to get more energy, whatever it is, you can sculpt and make adjustments,\" Schwarzenegger said."
