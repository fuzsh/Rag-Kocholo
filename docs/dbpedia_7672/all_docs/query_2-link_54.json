        "text": "Patrick Schwarzenegger and Abby Champion are getting married!\n\nThe couple, who have been dating since 2015, announced their engagement in a joint Instagram post in December 2023, sharing photos from their beach proposal.\n\n\"üíç‚ù§Ô∏èFOREVER AND EVER ‚ù§Ô∏èüíç,\" they wrote in the caption.\n\nThe actor was initially linked to the model in September 2015 when they were spotted at the celebrity hotspot the Nice Guy in West Hollywood. Schwarzenegger first appeared on Champion's Instagram in February 2016, and the two have been staples on each others' pages ever since.\n\nAs their relationship has flourished over the years, so have both of their respective careers ‚Äî his as an actor in movies like the Netflix hit Moxie and the HBO Max true crime series The Staircase, and hers as a model for some of the biggest fashion brands in the world.\n\nBut what else is there to know about the woman who captured Schwarzenegger's heart?\n\nFrom growing up in Birmingham, Alabama to taking the modeling world by storm, here is everything to know about Patrick Schwarzenegger's fianc√©e Abby Champion.\n\nShe is from Birmingham, Alabama\n\nChampion grew up in Birmingham, Alabama along with her three siblings. Regarding her Southern upbringing, Champion told her local hometown news outlet the Vestavia Voice in a 2016 interview that growing up in Alabama was \"amazing.\"\n\n\"It teaches you to have good manners, enjoy good food and reminds me of the importance of faith and family,\" she shared with the publication.\n\nIn 2019, she told LOVE magazine that she grew up on a \"quiet street\" in Birmingham and that her family had lots of land. Based on her Instagram, Champion still makes trips home to see her siblings in Birmingham.\n\nHer modeling career began by accident\n\nChampion's older sister Baskin was a model first, serving as Miss Teen Alabama in 2014 before representing their home state at the national pageant the following year. Champion later revealed to Vestavia Voice that she was first scouted at one of her sister's pageant. A recruiter approached her while she was watching Baskin at the 2014 Miss Teen USA event, and asked her if she had any interest in modeling.\n\nChampion also told the outlet she was able to \"watch and learn from [Baskin] as she began,\" and that they both were signed to agencies around the same time. The sisters even did a shoot together for the fashion brand Aeropostale and modeled together at Birmingham Fashion Week in 2015.\n\nShe's modeled for some of the biggest fashion brands in the world\n\nSince being signed by Next Models Worldwide in 2014, Champion has starred in print and digital campaigns ‚Äî along with walking the runway ‚Äî for some of the most recognizable fashion houses in the world. She counts Prada, Ralph Lauren, Chanel, Givenchy and more among the many brands she's worked with.\n\nIn 2021, Champion discussed her budding career with V Magazine, saying she felt a spark for modeling at her very first fashion show.\n\n\"That show, for me, made me want to work hard to be able to do many more shows.
