Participation in an Experience constitutes Participant’s authorization to such background checks, without Sponsor providing additional prior notice or seeking additional authorizations or consents from Potential Winner.\n\n* * *\n\nFundraising Transparency\n\nThis Experience is part of a fundraising campaign for Charities Aid Foundation America (“CAF America”), which is a globally recognized United States 501(c)(3) public charity (Federal Tax ID # 43-1634280). CAF America retains exclusive control over all donations raised in this Experience.\n\n(a) How it works: Omaze and CAF America work together to offer incredible Experiences, like this one. You don’t have to donate to enter, but if you do, 100% of your donation goes to CAF America, who then distributes the donations, minus the Experience fees and costs, to the nonprofit(s) identified on the experience page (the “Designated Grantee(s)”). Our model allows CAF America and the non-profit grantees to spend less time worrying about raising funds and instead focus their energy on doing awesome work.\n\n(b) Where your donation goes: For Omaze Premiere Experiences like this one, 60% of the total donations goes to the Designated Grantee(s) via a grant from CAF America. (If there are multiple Designated Grantees, then this amount is equally distributed to each). CAF America retains a small percentage of the total donations (less than 1%) to cover its own operating costs. Omaze uses the remaining amount to pay for the Experience costs, such as Prize costs, payment processing fees, and advertising to awesome people like you, and to cover our operating costs of providing and maintaining the technology and team that makes this all happen.\n\n(c) Designated Grantee Eligibility: Before every Experience, CAF America confirms the Designated Grantee(s) as eligible to receive grants. In the rare case where, after the launch of an Experience but before distribution of the donations, a Designated Grantee fails to maintain eligibility (per CAF America’s grant-making policies and/or applicable laws), then CAF America may (i) withhold distribution of the donations until the Designated Grantee is eligible or (ii) reassign the donations to another nonprofit that supports a similar cause. If CAF America reassigns the donations to an alternate organization, the Experience page will be updated to identify what entity(ies) received the grant(s).\n\n(d) When will the Designated Grantee get the money? Omaze sends 100% of donations from this Experience to CAF America within 2 business days of Omaze’s receipt of the donation. The speed at which CAF America distributes the donations to the Designated Grantee(s) depends on the classification of the Experience and can be anywhere from 2 weeks after Omaze received your donation to 90 days from the close of the Experience. In circumstances where a Designated Grantee fails to maintain eligibility to receive grants, the above grant distribution timeframes may be impacted.\n\nFor Experiences where the grant amount is a percentage of total donations (e.g., Premiere and Owned Experiences), CAF America will distribute the donations via multiple grants throughout the duration of the Experience, usually within 10-15 business days following CAF America’s receipt of donations from Omaze.\n\nFor Experiences where the grant amount is a percentage of Adjusted Donations (total donations minus Experience costs), CAF America will distribute donations after reconciliation of all Experience costs (usually within 15-90 days following the close of the Experience).\n\nCopyright ©2021 Omaze, Inc.
