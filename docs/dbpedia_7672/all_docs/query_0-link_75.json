        "text": "This is one way that Arnold Schwarzenegger and his long-estranged wife Maria Shriver continue to co-parent their four children — or “consciously uncouple” as Gwyneth Paltrow would put it.\n\nThe former governor and first lady of California were spotted taking one of their children, 27-year-old daughter Christina, out to a nail salon Saturday for a family pedicure session, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nThe tabloid published photos of the former couple riding together in a silver Mercedes SUV, with Shriver at the wheel, and then of the couple and their daughter in a Brentwood nail salon, getting their feet massaged and their toenails clipped and polished. Christina sat between her parents during the pedicures.\n\nThe former professional bodybuilder and action star, 71, married Shriver, the broadcast journalist niece of President John F. Kennedy, in 1986 at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.\n\nAlong with Christina, the couple share three other children: 29-year-old daughter Katherine, 25-year-old son Patrick, and 21-year-old son Christopher.\n\nSchwarzenegger, a moderate Republican, was elected governor of California following the 2003 recall of Gray Davis. He won re-election in 2006. Shortly after Scharzenegger left office in 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that he had fathered a son, Joseph, now 21, with the family housekeeper.\n\nShriver, 63, reportedly discovered the affair and confronted her husband about it. She and her husband subsequently announced their separation.\n\nBut seven years later, they have yet to finalize their divorce, according to a TMZ report in July.\n\nThere was never any dispute about custody. TMZ said there were some “bumps along the way” of settling their combined $400 million in property, but no “serious roadblocks.”\n\nSources told TMZ that Schwarzenegger has not shown an interest in making the divorce final, even though he has reportedly been dating physical therapist Heather Milligan, 27 years his junior, since 2015. Shriver has sometimes pushed for the divorce but other times decided to not worry about it, TMZ added.\n\nSources told TMZ the couple have no plans to get back together, but they still seem unwilling to legalize their split.\n\nMeanwhile, Schwarzenegger and Shriver’s oldest daughter, Katherine, is dating “Jurassic World” star Chris Pratt, while Patrick has ventured into acting, starring in “Midnight Sun” with Bella Thorne. Their youngest son Christopher is a student at the University of Michigan, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nChristina Schwarzenegger recently worked with her mother on co-producing a Netflix documentary, “Take Your Pills,” which analyzes the widespread use of Adderall in the United States, the Daily Mail added. The film screened at the South By Southwest Film Festival last March."
