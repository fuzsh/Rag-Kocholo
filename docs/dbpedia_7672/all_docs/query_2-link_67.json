        "text": "When we think of an Arnold Schwarzenegger workout, heavy weights and lots of reps and sets come to mind. But, in his most recent Arnold’s Pump Clubnewsletter the retired bodybuilder has shared a slightly different full-body dumbbell routine to his usual set-rep split.\n\nInstead, Arnie’s shared an ‘as many reps as possible’ (ARAMP) workout; where you perform as many reps of an exercise as you can within a set time frame. In his newsletter Arnold said: “While it might feel different, timed sets allow you to get in a lot of reps in a short period of time, making for an intense workout that gives you a great pump and cardio benefits.”\n\nFor Arnie's workout you’ll need a pair of dumbbells, however, if you don’t have them you could always use a single kettlebell too. You’ve got five exercises to do altogether and for each one you’re going to do as many reps as you can in 30 seconds. Once you’ve finished one exercise, rest for 30 seconds, then move onto the next one. Complete two rounds of the workout (although Arnold says if you really want to push yourself aim for four). Here are your exercises:\n\nDumbbell lunges\n\nDumbbell chest press\n\nDumbbell bent-over row\n\nDumbbell front squats\n\nDumbbell weighted crunch"
