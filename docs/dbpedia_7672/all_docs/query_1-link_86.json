        "text": "After forgoing a broadcast spot to pursue younger audiences on TikTok in 2022 and in the metaverse during last year’s game—largely because its brand was already on State Farm Stadium in 2023—the insurer returned for Super Bowl 58 with a 60-second spot right before the second quarter.\n\nBut there’s an issue.\n\nIn this ad produced with help from Highdive—and supported by OMD, Optimum Sports, The Marketing Arm, Infinity Marketing Team and FleishmanHillard—Schwarzenegger is the star of the company’s new Agent State Farm action clip, but famously drops the letter R when speaking."
