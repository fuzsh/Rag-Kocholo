        "text": "As Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed two bills that will allow\n\nthe University of California and the state of California to move\n\nahead with divestment, his words echoed the statements students\n\nhave been making for more than two years.\n\n“Today I am signing two bills that will send a clear\n\nmessage across the globe: California will not stand for murder and\n\ngenocide,” Schwarzenegger said, referring to the situation in\n\nthe Darfur region of Sudan, a conflict which the United\n\nStates’ Congress has labeled a genocide.\n\n“We cannot watch from the sidelines and be content to\n\nmourn this atrocity as it passes into history.”\n\nOn Monday the governor signed AB 2179, which will protect the UC\n\nfrom any damages or liability that could result from divestment\n\nfrom Sudan, and AB 2941, which prohibits the state’s two\n\nlargest pension funds from investing in companies with active\n\nbusiness in Sudan, as well as companies that supply military\n\nequipment to Sudan.\n\n“This is the final piece of the puzzle,” said Adam\n\nSterling, executive director of the UC Divestment Taskforce.\n\n“Now (the UC) can begin pulling affected security.”\n\nSince February 2003 government-sponsored Sudanese militias have\n\ncarried out a series of massacres which have resulted in more than\n\n400,000 deaths and displaced millions.\n\nIn March, the UC Board of Regents voted to divest from nine\n\ncompanies with holdings in Sudan. These nine companies were found\n\nto support the Sudanese government while providing the lease\n\nbenefits for the people of the country.\n\nBut the UC is still months away from divesting.\n\n“The regents’ plan provided for an 18-month period\n\nfor implementation after indemnification,” UC spokesman Trey\n\nDavis said.\n\nThat period begins now.\n\nDuring the implementation phase, the regents will calculate the\n\namount of investments that must be withdrawn, review the companies\n\ntargeted for divestment, and contact the investment managers\n\nresponsible for divesting, Davis said.\n\nThough the UC will reevaluate the companies it will divest from,\n\nSterling said he expects the final plan to be similar to the plan\n\nset out by the regents in March.\n\nThe process of reevaluating companies and withdrawing funds\n\ntakes time, which is why the UC left an 18-month window in which to\n\ncomplete the process, Sterling said.\n\n“Financially, you can’t withdraw all your stock from\n\na company at once,” Sterling said. “If you were to\n\nwithdraw it all at once, the price would drop.”\n\nThe state’s divestment plan is similar to the UC’s,\n\nbut the state bill is a “bit more developed in terms of how\n\nfar it goes into divestment,” Sterling said, explaining that\n\nthough the state’s plan was modeled after the UC’s, it\n\nwas developed over a longer period of time.\n\nDivestment has garnered a great deal of support in the state in\n\nthe past several months and divestment campaigns have been set in\n\nmotion in 15 other states, Sterling said.\n\n“The bill passed on consent in both the House and the\n\nSenate, which means it got no opposition from anyone,”\n\nSterling said."
