        "text": "The political shock waves that shook California in 2003 were akin to the Big One, with the recall of Gov. Gray Davis and the election of Arnold Schwarzenegger to replace him.\n\nThe body builder-turned-action star trounced Davis, whose low-key personality put him at a distinct disadvantage when compared with the charismatic Austrian. Schwarzenegger promised to be “the people’s governor” who would put aside partisan politics and instead govern in the best interest of Californians.\n\nThe Los Angeles area, meanwhile, was jolted by separate strikes called by supermarket clerks and transit workers — job actions that hit residents where they lived and where they worked.\n\nAnd another temblor struck when then-Cardinal Roger Mahony released the names of scores of clergy suspected of molesting parishioners\n\nThe Los Angeles Daily News covered these stories from a San Fernando Valley perspective, explaining their potential impact on local residents.\n\nAs the paper continues its Centennial series, here are excerpts of select stories from 2003-04:\n\nBigger dump in Valley\n\nDespite numerous violations and objections from nearby residents, Los Angeles city officials have cleared the way for Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley to increase its capacity, raise its height and extend its operating life.\n\nAnd Waste Management Inc., which operates Bradley, is seeking approval for a further expansion, which would increase capacity by 10 percent and raise the garbage dump’s height by 43 feet. The city is now beginning an environmental review on that proposal.\n\nComing on top of the city’s controversial approval of reopening Sunshine Canyon Landfill in Granada Hills and Mayor James Hahn’s stated opposition to urban landfills, the two moves to expand Bradley have fueled community concern in the Northeast Valley. Residents charge they were never notified by the city officials of the first set of proposed changes, which now only need state approval, and accuse the city of giving approval after the fact to clear Bradley’s long pattern of permit violations. (Jan. 6, 2003)\n\nDandy gym\n\nThe veterans asked for a new gym.\n\nWhat they got Friday, after years of lobbying the Department of Veterans Affairs and numerous politicians, was a new, $1.7 million Therapeutic Fitness Center at the Sepulveda VA.\n\n“I think it looks great; I’m impressed,” said Air Force veteran Martin Light, 70, of Van Nuys. “It’ll save us from dying a couch potato’s death.”\n\nAbout 200 veterans, community leaders and elected officials turned out Friday for a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the refurbished center, which was damaged in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake and closed by VA officials in 1999. (Feb. 13, 2003)\n\n‘It’s free gas’\n\nWith gasoline prices at record highs and still soaring, hundreds of motorists in sedans, SUVs and even fuel-guzzling RVs flocked Thursday to a Burbank service station where they waited hours in a miles-long line for a free tank of gas. One driver came from as far as Anaheim for the giveaway — a promotion for an online bank — and others actually ran out of gas as their cars crept toward the Shell station on Hollywood Way.\n\n“I wasn’t going to do this,” said Burbank resident Daniel Squires, who waited in line four hours to fill the tank of his beige Honda Accord. “But then I decided … it’s free gas.”\n\nWith the price of regular gas averaging $2.025 a gallon statewide, and selling for $2.09 at the Shell station, anxious bargain-hunters began arriving Wednesday night to guarantee themselves a place near the head of the line. (March 7, 2003)\n\nProud military families pray for loved ones’ safety\n\nAmong the troops in Kuwait poised for war stand scores of men and women from down the block — a Taft High graduate who joined the Marines, a Quartz Hill wrestling star called up from the Reserves, a Simi Valley dad who smiles back at his family from pictures in the desert.\n\nAs GIs and reservists prepare for war on the other side of the world, their families and friends from across the San Fernando Valley and neighboring suburbs cling to every bit of news for word of when — or if — the war will unfold.\n\nWhile those back home have varying degrees of enthusiasm for the war, they are united in their unflinching support for the husbands, children and loved ones who are prepared to put their lives on the line to serve America. (March 16, 2003)\n\nL.A. baseball academy plan scores major win\n\nResponding to impassioned pleas from City Council President Alex Padilla and Councilman-elect Tony Cardenas, the Planning Commission approved plans Thursday for Major League Baseball to develop a $6 million sports academy for at-risk youths atop the former Sheldon-Arleta Landfill …\n\nThe academy would open in Fall 2004, providing free academic, athletic and career training to 2,000 children a year. (March 28, 2003)\n\n101 fix scaled back\n\nRejecting a controversial plan to double-deck the Ventura Freeway through the San Fernando Valley, transportation officials on Tuesday recommended widening the freeway between Thousand Oaks and Burbank and adding regular traffic and car-pool lanes. They also said widening the freeway to accommodate two car-pool lanes in each direction would allow flexibility for express buses or even a rail line in the future, and give those who carpool direct connections to the 405 and 134 freeways. (April 30, 2003)\n\nNewhall Ranch plan OK’d\n\nAfter a decade of controversy, Newhall Ranch — Los Angeles County’s largest-ever subdivision — got the final go-ahead Tuesday from the Board of Supervisors despite lingering concerns over traffic and other environmental problems. The board’s 4-1 vote takes the developer a step closer to building the massive 20,885-home project on 12,000 acres, a commercial and residential project expected to add an estimated 60,000 residents to the booming Santa Clarita Valley. Construction could begin in 2006. (May 28, 2003)\n\nAPD response time slows with Valley worst\n\nThe time it takes Los Angeles police to respond to emergency calls has jumped by an average of one minute citywide this year with the San Fernando Valley getting the slowest response at 11.2 minutes, according to a city report issued Monday. Response times have risen sharply since 2000, with much of the increase coming since Mayor James Hahn successfully pushed for a shortened three-day or four-day workweek for officers.\n\nAccording to figures in the city administrative officer’s new report on the impact of the flexible work schedule, the average response time to emergency calls citywide has shot up about 30 percent — from eight minutes to 10.7 minutes since 2000. (July 1, 2003)\n\n10 victims of tragedy mourned\n\nAs she did every week, Lynne Ann Weaver picked through the fruits and vegetables Wednesday in the booths at the farmers market in Santa Monica near her office. In a cruel twist of fate, her love of healthy foods brought her to Arizona Avenue as usual when an 86-year-old driver plowed through three blocks of food stands and a street full of shoppers, killing 10 people.\n\nShe was one of them.\n\nWeaver, 47, of Woodland Hills — chief operating officer of an Arnold Schwarzenegger-sponsored youth program, prominent activist in women’s support groups, daughter-in- law of actor Dennis Weaver — was mourned Thursday for her love of life and her dedication to others.\n\n“She really touched the lives of everyone she met,” said Bonnie Reiss, head of Schwarzenegger’s After-School All Stars, who on many other Wednesdays had strolled through the street market with Weaver. (July 18, 2003)\n\nBob Hope laid to rest, receives final ovation\n\nAfter a dawn funeral Mass where flowers in the pattern of the American flag decorated the altar, Bob Hope was given a final standing ovation Wednesday by about 100 relatives and close friends invited to honor the Hollywood legend. When the private Mass ended at St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church, a few blocks west of the Toluca Lake estate where Hope had lived since 1937, a hearse led a 25-car procession to the San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Mission Hills. There, mourners gave Hope a standing ovation as his coffin was temporarily placed into a mausoleum vault. (July 31, 2003)\n\nCSUN gets biggest gift ever\n\nA Chinese immigrant who grew up in the San Fernando Valley and attended CSUN before becoming a successful high-tech entrepreneur has pledged $38 million in Chinese antiquities to the college, officials said Monday.\n\nThe gift being announced today is the largest donation ever to the statewide California State University system.\n\nEntrepreneur Roland Tseng — who collected many of the pieces during what he called his “Indiana Jones phase” on archaeology digs in China — hopes the gift will help to encourage further campus giving to create a landmark research and cultural institution “on this side of the hill.” (Sept. 23, 2003)\n\nDavis lauds Ahmanson purchase\n\nSurrounded by the rolling hills of Ahmanson Ranch on Wednesday, Gov. Gray Davis and a host of officials, celebrities and activists celebrated the purchase of the 2,900-acre expanse in eastern Ventura County to be preserved as open space. The 10-year struggle against development of a planned community there, started by Mary Wiesbrock and other local activists, culminated in the $150 million deal funded by the state to buy Ahmanson Ranch from Washington Mutual and make it part of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. (Oct. 2, 2003)\n\nArnold! Voters recall Gov. Davis, elect Schwarzenegger\n\nIn a stunning climax to months of political gridlock and conflict, Californians voted Tuesday to remove Gov. Gray Davis from office and elected movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger as their next governor. Davis suffered a humiliating defeat in the historic election, just 11 months after winning a second term … The governor-elect said he will begin immediately to reach out to legislative leaders.\n\n“It doesn’t matter if they are left or right or center,” Schwarzenegger said. “I extend my hand to them. I will let them know my door will always be open because I want to work with them together for the good of California.” (Oct. 8, 2003)\n\nDodgers sold\n\nFrank McCourt, a prominent Boston land developer, reached agreement Friday with News Corp. to purchase the Dodgers in a deal that sources said is worth $430 million …\n\nIn addition to the franchise, McCourt would acquire Dodger Stadium, the team’s spring-training facility in Vero Beach, Fla., a developmental complex in the Dominican Republic and land near Dodger Stadium that could lure the NFL back to Los Angeles.\n\n“We feel enormously privileged and excited about this opportunity to lead the Dodgers to continued excellence across every level of the organization,” McCourt said. (Oct. 11, 2003)\n\nGrocery workers strike\n\nSeventy thousand clerks, cashiers, butchers and boxers went on strike Saturday night, as unionized supermarket employees called a walkout against Southern California’s three largest grocery chains. The action comes after two days of last-ditch contract talks broke down between leaders of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and officials from Albertsons, Ralphs and Vons. (Oct. 12, 2003)\n\nStranded!\n\nMTA buses and trains came to a halt Tuesday in the second massive strike by transit workers in three years, wreaking havoc on the lives of nearly half a million bus and train riders and making rush-hour traffic even worse than normal across most of Los Angeles County. Both management and employees geared up for a long strike and no talks were scheduled that would end the walkout. (Oct. 15, 2003)\n\nAir and ground war\n\nFirefighters mounted an air and ground assault Monday on a wildfire that roared into the northwest San Fernando Valley and forced thousands to flee their homes. A wall of flames threatened Box Canyon, the outskirts of Chatsworth and gradually moved east toward the massive Porter Ranch development, but nearly 1,000 firefighters fought back, sometimes door to door to protect life or property …\n\nThe Simi Valley Fire — apparently caused by an arsonist — was among 10 brush fires burning from the Mexican border to Ventura County, killing at least 15 people, destroying 1,100 homes and torching 400,000 acres. (Oct. 28, 2003)\n\nBrazen attack at Van Nuys Courthouse\n\nOn a day when Van Nuys Courthouse was jammed with media for a hearing in actor Robert Blake’s murder case, a man upset over handling of his probate case was caught on Court TV’s camera shooting an attorney.\n\nCameraman David Diaz was standing outside the courthouse and captured the scene of the brazen shooting as attorney Gerald Curry, 53, of Simi Valley was ducking and diving around a tree and trying to deflect bullets with his briefcase. He was wounded but in good condition.\n\nThe suspect, William Strier, 60, of Sherman Oaks then was tackled by an off-duty sheriff’s officer and others — all of it occurring as horrified witnesses watched and the TV camera rolled.\n\n“You took my money, that’s what you get!” the gunman reportedly yelled at Curry, who is active in San Fernando Valley civic and community groups. (Nov. 1, 2003)\n\nAmelia rises again\n\nIn 1937, aeronautical pioneer Amelia Earhart vanished without a trace over the vast Pacific. On Tuesday, she was unveiled for the ages in bronze. Civic leaders and artists have cast a statue of what may be the best permanent likeness of the intrepid explorer who settled in the San Fernando Valley …\n\nThe 8-foot bronze statue of Earhart holding an airplane propeller was officially unveiled at North Hollywood Park, at Magnolia Boulevard and Tujunga Avenue, next to the Amelia Earhart Branch Library. The $130,000 memorial — financed through private and public community redevelopment funds — replicates a crumbling fiberglass statue that had stood on the corner since 1971. (Dec. 17, 2003)\n\nRecycling catch up\n\nMore than a decade after requiring trash recycling in single-family neighborhoods, Los Angeles city officials are ready to launch a $6 million, two-year pilot recycling program for apartment dwellers. But critics say officials should just make it mandatory now. By late February, the city will start experimenting with ways of collecting recyclables and encouraging participation at more than 100,000 of the city’s 650,000 multifamily units. In two years, they hope to have the best plan and institute it citywide. (Jan. 27, 2004)\n\nDisney, Pixar part ways\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. and Pixar Animation Studios Inc. stunned the entertainment industry Thursday by ending their spectacularly successful partnership that grossed a combined $2.5 billion at the box office with “Finding Nemo” and other blockbuster hits. (Jan 30, 2004)\n\nMahony issues priests’ names\n\nThe Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles formally released an unprecedented report Tuesday naming 211 priests and clergy members accused of molesting children since 1930, but victims said it did not go far enough and demanded that the church release personnel records related to criminal cases. In a letter opening the 30-page “Report to the People of God,” Cardinal Roger Mahony asked forgiveness from “victims, their families and friends, from the Faithful and from society in general for the mistakes of the past.” (Feb. 18, 2004)\n\nBig 3 chains will go all out in effort to win shoppers back\n\nSupermarket shoppers can expect a “sale blitz” once the 4-1/2-month grocery clerks’ strike officially ends as Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons try to regain their customers who defected in the face of picket lines, grocery industry analysts and executives said. The strike and lockout devastated the incomes of workers and the revenue of the three largest supermarket chains in Southern California as consumers turned to wholesalers, ethnic markets and specialty stores in droves, developing new shopping patterns. (Feb. 27, 2004)\n\nSan Fernando moving to preserve its historic houses\n\nAfter two years of foot-dragging, San Fernando city officials said Friday that they are close to setting up a plan to preserve some of the Valley’s oldest homes, the first step in reversing the city’s poor record of saving architectural treasures. San Fernando first embarked on the preservation plan in 2002 to save old Victorian, California Craftsmen, Spanish-style and colonial homes and buildings from the bulldozers. But it has made such little progress that the Los Angeles Conservancy, which tracks preservation efforts countywide, gave the city a D-minus grade last year. (March 20, 2004)\n\nAdult filming shuts down\n\nMuch of the San Fernando Valley’s multibillion-dollar adult-movie business stopped production Thursday as it banned nearly four dozen actors and actresses from working after two tested positive for the AIDS virus, industry officials said. Companies that churn out movies in what is estimated to be a $9 billion to $13 billion industry took a cautionary approach to the scare, which was revealed by the health agency that the industry created several years ago as part of its self-policing of sexually transmitted diseases. (April 16, 2004)\n\nThree-peat’s oh so sweet\n\nIn a record-breaking, nerve-racking finish Saturday, Woodland Hills’ El Camino Real High School squeaked past a rival Arizona team to win the 23rd annual U.S. Academic Decathlon. About 270 points out of a possible 60,000 total separated the two teams and gave El Camino its third national championship, making it the only California team to claim three national titles. (April 18, 2004)\n\n‘Hot’ water at Santa Susana\n\nHigh levels of radioactivity were found for the first time in groundwater at the Santa Susana Field Lab where nuclear reactors were tested beginning in the late 1940s, federal officials said Wednesday. Officials said the contamination does not pose a risk to the public or neighbors of the facility located in the Simi Hills above Chatsworth … The Daily News first disclosed in 1989 that a DOE survey had found massive radioactive and chemical contamination at the lab, triggering the effort. (May 20, 2004)\n\nThousands show their love, respect\n\nBill Metcalf flew in from Tucson to glimpse Ronald Reagan’s casket and almost gave up on account of the traffic. Elizabeth O’Connell left her Van Nuys home at 11 p.m. to see the president, only to turn back at the miles of parked cars. Stacey Wilcon drove all the way from Lancaster only to make a U-turn and drive back home. But each would return late Tuesday to join the tens of thousands of mourners hoping for a last chance to circle the flag-draped casket of America’s 40th president, lying in repose at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley … The viewing at the library was the first event in a week of national mourning. (June 9, 2004)\n\nVan Nuys Air Show grounded\n\nThe 41-year-old Van Nuys air show, the San Fernando Valley’s biggest event — drawing crowds of up to 300,000 people — is being grounded to make way for firefighting helicopters … Construction this month of a 13-acre Los Angeles Fire Department air operations facility at Van Nuys Airport will scale back the popular air show that featured large-scale military aircraft demonstrations… Mayor James Hahn, who has long supported the air show, known officially as the Aviation Expo, said there was a greater need for public safety in the San Fernando Valley. (June 18, 2004)\n\nBig dream for downtown\n\nA massive $1 billion hotel, entertainment and residential district for downtown Los Angeles will be announced today, with a towering 55-story hotel-condominium complex dominating the area around Staples Center. In one of the largest projects ever proposed for Los Angeles, the Anschutz Entertainment Group hopes to capitalize on the success of Staples Center and the boom in downtown development it helped spur. (July 14, 2004)\n\n$20 million settlement for Armenian Genocide\n\nHeirs of relatives killed in the Armenian Genocide nearly a century ago reached a $20 million settlement Friday for old life-insurance claims, a landmark decision hailed as a step in formally recognizing the atrocity …\n\nAttorneys claimed a historic victory, saying the settlement acknowledges the genocide — when 1.5 million Armenians in the Turkish Ottoman Empire were killed. Turkey denies a genocide occurred, and maintains that Armenians were killed in civil unrest during the collapse of the empire. (July 31, 2004)\n\nLAFD loses first female on job\n\nA woman firefighter, just months out of the academy, died Saturday after her crew’s firetruck backed over her following a house fire. Jaime L. Foster, 25, of Palmdale, who was assigned to Station 73 in Reseda, was the first woman firefighter in Los Angeles to die in the line of duty …\n\n“It is with great sadness that the men and women of the Los Angeles Fire Department inform you of the death of an on-duty Los Angeles firefighter,” fire officials said in a statement released on the incident. (Aug. 15, 2004)\n\nValley hospital to close its doors\n\nNorthridge Hospital Medical Center’s Sherman Way campus, an aging 209-bed acute-care facility losing more than $1 million a month, will close by year’s end, administrators said Thursday … Once known as Valley Hospital and later as Valley Receiving, the Sherman Way facility has served Van Nuys for 75 years, providing care to about 45,000 patients a year. A burgeoning uninsured population and low reimbursements proved too costly for it to continue operating. (Aug. 20, 2004)\n\nSpaceShipOne rockets in new era\n\nA red, white and blue rocket plane zoomed into space Monday, winning a $10 million prize as the world’s first privately built reusable spacecraft and heralding the future of commercial space travel. SpaceShipOne designer Burt Rutan is already turning his energy toward SpaceShipTwo, which a flamboyant British tycoon wants to develop to carry passengers by decade’s end …\n\nWith former Navy pilot Brian Binnie at the controls, Rutan’s rocket plane zoomed upward over the Mojave Desert to nearly 70 miles, topping by more than seven miles the altitude it had to reach to win the Ansari X Prize. (Oct. 5, 2004)\n\nGoods for poor gone in fire\n\nA fire sparked by a short circuit swept through the San Fernando Valley’s largest charity, destroying its entire stock of clothes, blankets and toys donated for distribution to the poor. Monday night’s fire at MEND — Meet Each Need with Dignity — came just weeks after the agency began its winter-giving campaign, and it could put a dent in the group’s annual Christmas baskets that traditionally go to hundreds of families in the Northeast Valley. (Oct. 20, 2004)\n\nCSUN pays off big\n\nBeyond its cultural importance, California State University, Northridge, has become a major economic engine for the San Fernando Valley region — generating $4 for every dollar the state invests in the 33,000-student campus, according to a report released Thursday.\n\nIn the first comprehensive economic and community-impact study produced by CSUN, researchers found that from a state investment of about $164 million, the Northridge university has an impact on the local economy of up to $686 million a year …\n\n“It confirms the university’s indispensability to the region,” CSUN President Jolene Koester said. “It helps document the case for the role of higher education and a regional, comprehensive university.” (Nov. 12, 2004)\n\nBig deal for Valley\n\nIn one of the biggest privately funded projects ever in the San Fernando Valley, Neiman Marcus will open a store at Westfield Shoppingtown Topanga as part of a $300 million expansion that will alter the area’s retail landscape, officials said Tuesday … The project will create a behemoth shopping center that will span 1.6 million square feet — one-third of it new … At some point, it will likely connect with Westfield Shoppingtown Promenade a few blocks away. (Dec. 1, 2004)\n\nLocal doctors rush to the scene\n\nWhen Dr. Rumi Abdul Cader saw televised images of bodies bobbing along Sri Lanka’s shoreline, he knew he had to return to his homeland to help. Less than 24 hours after the devastating tsunami struck southern Asia, the 32-year-old internist and his physician brother, Rushdi, began organizing teams of doctors to provide medical relief in Sri Lanka …\n\n“For me this is something very personal,” said Rumi Cader, who practices at the Veteran Affairs Southern California System at Sepulveda in North Hills. “As a physician, I cannot ignore it. It is a duty to go to my homeland.” (Dec. 30, 2004)"
