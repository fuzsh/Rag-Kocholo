        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is not happy about how his body looks as he’s aging. During a recent interview, the 76-year-old action icon and former bodybuilder discussed his body concerns. The Terminator alum said, “I kind of smile because every day I do look in a mirror and I say, ‘Yep, you suck. Look at this body. Look at the spectral muscles that used to be firm and perky and really powerful. Now they’re just hanging there.’ I mean, what the hell is going on here?”\n\nRELATED: Arnold Schwarzenegger On Death: Says Heaven Is A ‘Fantasy’\n\nThe seven-time Mr. Olympia winner said it’s one thing to see yourself get older and more and more out of shape, but “most of the people have never been in shape. So what does it mean getting out of shape?” Schwarzenegger has long been hailed for years for his impressive physique, from the prominent veins on his abs and chest. Fast forward 50 years, and he finds himself “standing there and you don’t see that anymore.” The former California governor previously got candid about his addictive workout routine. As we reported a few months ago, he started working out at a young age with the pressures of meeting his father’s expectations.\n\nHis love for exercise was something that was ingrained in him as a kid. For Schwarzenegger, getting up early every morning to hit the gym is just a way of life. He recalled his father saying, “‘You cannot have breakfast first. You have to earn it. You have to do 200 sit-ups and push-ups.’ So that’s how I grew up.” As a result, the action star explained that he is “now addicted to working out every day.” After recently undergoing his third open-heart surgery, Arnold nearly lost his life. When she shared footage on social media of himself walking with a walker to regain his strength and lung health, Schwarzenegger said he “looked like an idiot waddling around the hallway.”\n\nThe actor recently published a self-help book titled: Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life, which is out on October 24.\n\nThese Celebrities Have A July Birthday\n\nPeople born in July are either a Cancer (July 1 – July 22) or a Leo (July 23 – July 31). For a little more than half of the month, Cancers take charge. Represented by the crab, this water sign is ruled by the moon. Cancers are known to be emotional and nurturing people, and usually tend to be the caregivers of the people in their life. Compassionate with a goofy sense of humor, you can rely on Cancers for being in tune with their emotions.\n\nLeos, on the other hand, are a fire sign, represented by the ferocious lion. Opposite to Cancers, Leos are ruled by the sun and with that, usually love being the center of attention. They are passionate and theatrical, so it makes sense that a lot of successful actors on this list have found success. This sign brings about natural leaders and are known to be loyal, putting their hearts into every endeavor. However, these positive, strong traits can be impaired by their ego, pride, and jealousy when they start to fear threatened.\n\nSome of the most iconic actors and comedians were born in the month of July.
