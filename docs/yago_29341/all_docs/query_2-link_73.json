It is true that they married into the highest Polish families that probably had huge estates (actually I don't know if the Russian domination affected they wealth). And it is true that until XVIII century Polish aristocracy had the power to elect kings of Poland, who could be chosen also in its ranks, so being a lot more powerful that the rest of Europe's aristocracy.
