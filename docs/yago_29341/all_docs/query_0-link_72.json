        "text": "Maria Antonia of Naples and Sicily (Married October 6th, 1802): She was his first cousin, their father were brothers. She miscarried twice, once in 1804 and again in 1805. She died of tuberculosis on May 21st, 1806, although (unproven) rumours persisted that she had been poisoned by her mother in law. She died before her husband became King of Spain, so she was never Queen.\n\nMaria Isabel of Portugal (Married September 29th, 1816): Maria Isabel was his niece, the daughter of his older sister Carlota Joaquina. She gave birth to a daughter, María Luisa Isabel, on August 21st, 1817. The baby girl died at just four months old. She became pregnant again soon afterwards, but when she went into labour it was difficult because the baby was breech. The doctors realized the child had died, and Maria Isabel stopped breathing. The doctors thought she was dead and went to cut her open to get the baby out, when she screamed in pain and collapsed onto the bed bleeding heavily. She died the same day, December 26th, 1818.\n\nMaria Josepha Amalia of Saxony (Married October 20th, 1819): They shared common ancestors, but were not directly related. Ferdinand chose her since Saxon Princesses were known for being fertile, and he had no living children from his first two wives. He fell in love with her sweet disposition, and she was also more physically attractive than his previous wives. Despite his affection for her, the marriage would be childless and she died of fevers on May 29th, 1829.\n\nMaria Christina of the Two Sicilies (Married December 11th, 1829): She was his niece by birth (Her mother Maria Isabella was his sister) and by marriage (He had been previously married to her father’s sister, Maria Antonia). His desperation for an heir led to their marriage just seven months after his third wife died. She gave birth to a daughter on October 10th, 1830, who would eventually succeed her father as Isabella II. Maria Christina also had another daughter, Infanta Luisa Fernanda, on January 30th, 1832. She also had two sons, but neither survived a year. She became regent for the toddler Isabella when Ferdinand died on September 29th, 1833. She married a former sergeant of the royal guard, Agustín Fernando Muñoz, only a few months after the King’s death. They had 9 children together, while she tried to keep it secret or she would have been forced to forfeit the regency. When the marriage did become public in 1840, she became deeply unpopular and renounced the regency and left Spain with her second husband and their children. Maria Christina’s marriage was eventually accepted by Isabella, who granted her stepfather a title. She would live in France for most of the rest of her life, where she died at the age of 72, on July 22nd, 1878."
