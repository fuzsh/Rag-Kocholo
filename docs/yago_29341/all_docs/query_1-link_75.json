She was the youngest daughter of king Ferdinand VII of Spain and his fourth wife Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, the queen-regent, who was also his niece.\n\tWhen her elder sister Isabella II of Spain succeeded to the throne, Infanta Luisa Fernanda was heiress-presumptive to the crown between 1833 and 1851, when Isabella's oldest surviving daughter was born... Isabella had been engaged to their first cousin Francis, Duke of Cádiz, who was known to be homosexual and rumored impotent. The King Louis Philippe of France calculated that no children will be born from Isabella's marriage, and planned the crown of Spain to eventually devolve to his own grandchildren. For this purpose, Luisa Fernanda was engaged to Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, the youngest son of king Louis Philippe, who also was Luisa's mother's first cousin. The relationship between Queen Isabella and her sister was tense, due to Antoine's conspiracies against her... After Queen Isabella was deposed, the family went to exile. Luisa returned to Seville years later, already widowed. When she died, she was buried at Escorial.\n\t\n\tThe park belonged to the Palace of San Telmo . It was donated to the city by the Princess Maria Luisa Fernanda at June 19th 1893. The park wasn't really incorporated to the city until Seville took the management of the Ibero-Aamerican Exhibition in 1929. It was at that time, the beginning of the 20th century, when the Mayor made the French engineer Forestier restructure the park and then it became the main area of this exhibition. The buildings in the park belonged to this exhibition. The rest of the pavillions are around the park. They were built in neocolonial style. \n\t\n\tThe park itself is wonderful and has a wide variety of vegetation species, not only local ones. There are many different birds: ducks, swans and peacocks and probably others. Honestly, I didn’t see flamingos there but when I closed my eyes I’ve clearly seen Maria Luisa walking through the park followed by big pink flamingo and Siamese cat as her guardians... so I made a shot.\n\t\n\t<a href=\"http://bighugelabs.com/onblack.php?id=4120051780&amp;size=large\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">View On Black</a>",
