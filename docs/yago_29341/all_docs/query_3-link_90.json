He wears the Golden Fleece on his uniform, as well as a pin with other decorations and the crosses of the four Spanish chivalry orders: Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara and Montesa. In the background is the Alcázar of Segovia (headquarters of the Artillery Academy), where the painting was\n\nJuan José of Austria\n\nOil on canvas. 1677\n\nJiménez Donoso, José\n\nThis is a portrait depicting John Joseph of Austria dressed in half armour, high riding boots, a sash and general’s sash from which his sword hangs. His right hand firmly grasps the general’s sceptre, and his left hand rests haughtily on his hip. He wears a French-style kerchief around his neck and the cross of the Order of Malta on his chest.

Fourth and last wife (1829) of King Ferdinand VII (1784–1833). She later married Fernando Muñoz (1808–1873), 1st Duke of Riansares, whose fortune came mainly from the slave trade and railway investments.

For many years the large-scale definitive version was the only painting of Ferdinand displayed to the public in the museum he had founded. He is shown as commander-in-chief of the Spanish armed forces beside an oak tree that refers to the virtues of th\n\nCharles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy\n\nOil on canvas mounted on panel. XVII century\n\nAnonymous\n\nThe work belonged to a series of at least eight portraits, depicting the four dukes of the second house of Burgundy and their respective wives. The Museo del Prado keeps four portraits from this series: Margaret III (P006719) Countess of Flanders and wife of Philip the Bold; Margaret of Bavaria (P006721), Duchess of Burgundy and wife of John the Fearless; and the couple Isabella of Bourbon and Cha\n\nHunt at the Castle of Torgau in Honour of Charles V\n\nOil on panel. 1544\n\nCranach the Elder, Lucas\n\nA hunting scene characterized by a very developed landscape castle of Hartenfels in Torgau (Saxony).

Ca. 1590\n\nAnonymous (Copy after: El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos))\n\nConsidered a copy of a portrait by El Greco, the more detailed technique deployed here lacks the loose boldness of his brushstroke but the composition and some of the elements within it remain close to his approach. El Greco would have known the sitter (1529-1600), a celebrated jurist and a member of the Councils of Castile and of Finance.\n\nThe Infanta Isabel Clara Eugenia\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1615\n\nRubens, Peter Paul ; Brueghel the Elder, Jan (Jan 'Velvet' Brueghel)\n\nThe marriage of Isabel Clara Eugenia (1566–1633) to Albert of Austria and her designation as sovereign princess of the Low Countries marked a turning point in the depiction of her public image. Her change of social status from single to married woman and her assumption of political responsibilities brought with them a new model of portrait. These omitted the previously recurrent presence of her fa\n\n1st Marquis of La Ensenada\n\nOil on canvas.

These images include numerous elements referring to the young monarch`s royal status. Here various putti support the sceptre, crown and palm while on the left another one lifts up the insignia of the Golden Fleece and a crowned eagle holds a laurel wreath.\n\nEmperor Charles V with a Dog\n\nOil on canvas. 1533\n\nTitian (Tiziano Vecellio)\n\nThe period between 1530 and 1533 was crucial for the formulation of the image of Charles V. The image that ultimately proved most influential was invented by Jacob Seisenegger who painted five full-length portraits of Charles V between 1530 and 1532, creating a totally innovative typology for the depiction of the Emperor but one that had numerous precedents in German art (Cranach, Strigel, Amberge\n\nDon Sebastian, King of Portugal\n\nOil on canvas. Ca. 1580\n\nSánchez Coello, Alonso (After: Soleri, Giorgio)\n\nThis three-quarters portrait is especially direct, thanks to the absence of any background elements other than the model´s powerful shadow. It presents don Sebastian (1554-1580) in the final years of his brief life, dressed in the Spanish style, with a black jerkin and matching cape that bring out the sumptuousness of his breeches and doublet, embroidered in gold on a white background.

In this case it is a late derivation – with several variants and by an unknown author – of the original full-length portrait of the Queen in court dress, painted in 1800 by Goya and kept in the Royal Palace. The queen is holding a fan in her right hand; she is standing almost three-quarter length before a green curtain and th\n\nCharles IV, King of Spain\n\nOil on canvas. 1789 - 1790\n\nGoya y Lucientes, Francisco de (Copy)\n\nCompanion to the Portrait of Queen Maria Luisa of Parma (P007108).
