        "text": "Maria Cristina of Naples and Sicily (Maria Cristina Amelia Teresa; 17 January 1779 – 11 March 1849) was a Princess of Naples and Sicily and later Queen of Sardinia as wife of Charles Felix of Sardinia.\n\nPrincess of Naples and Sicily\n\nShe was a daughter of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and his wife Maria Carolina of Austria, a daughter of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. She was her mother's favourite child.\n\nDuchess of Genevois\n\nShe was married on 6 April 1807 in Palermo with Prince Charles Felix of Savoy, who became King unexpectedly, when his two elder brothers abdicated, Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia in 1802 and Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia in 1821. Till her husband became king, she was styled as the Duchess of Genevois.\n\nQueen of Sardinia\n\nThe royal couple were interested in the arts and artists, and turned the Royal House in Agliè and the Villa Rufinella in Frascati into comfortable residences.\n\nDuring her husband's reign, they resided at the Palazzo Chiablese, where her husband died in 1831.\n\nIn 1825, the Queen engaged the archaeologist Marquess Luigi Biondi (1776–1839), whose excavation work uncovered Tusculum. In 1839 and 1840, the architect and archaeologist Luigi Canina (1795–1856) was engaged by the royal family and excavated the Theatre area of Tusculum. The ancient works of art excavated were sent to the Duke of Savoy's Castle of Agliè in Piedmont.\n\nCharles Felix died in 1831 after a reign of ten years. Maria Cristina lived the rest of her life in Turin, Naples, Agliè and Frascati, and died in Savona, Liguria. She was buried beside her husband in the Basilica of Superga, Great Mausoleum, Savoy Crypt, Turin, Piedmont, Italy. The couple had no children.\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\n\nTitles and styles\n\n17 January 1779 – 6 April 1807 Her Royal Highness Princess Maria Cristina of Naples and Sicily\n\n6 April 1807 – 12 March 1821 Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Genevois\n\n12 March 1821 – 27 April 1831 Her Majesty the Queen of Sardinia\n\n27 April 1831 – 11 March 1849 Her Majesty the Dowager Queen of Sardinia\n\nImages for kids\n\nPrincess Maria Cristina, by Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun.\n\nSee also"
