        "text": "Queen of Sardinia from 1821 to 1831\n\nFor other people called Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, see Maria Christina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (disambiguation).\n\nMaria Cristina of Naples and Sicily (Maria Cristina Amelia Teresa; 17 January 1779 – 11 March 1849) was a Princess of Naples and Sicily and later Queen of Sardinia as wife of King Charles Felix. She was a daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Carolina of Austria.\n\nPrincess of Naples and Sicily (1779–1807)\n\n[edit]\n\nMaria Cristina was born on 17 January 1779 at the Caserta Palace in Caserta. She was the sixth child and fourth daughter of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and his wife Maria Carolina of Austria, a daughter of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. She was her mother's favourite child.\n\nHer twin sister Maria Cristina Amelia died of smallpox on 26 February 1783, at the age of four.\n\nDuchess of Genoa (1807–1821)\n\n[edit]\n\nMaria Cristina was married on 6 April 1807 in Palermo with Prince Charles Felix of Savoy, who became King of Sardinia when his elder brother Victor Emmanuel I abdicated in 1821. Until her husband became king, she was styled as the Duchess of Genoa.\n\nQueen of Sardinia (1821–1831)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe royal couple were interested in the arts and artists, and turned the Royal House in Agliè and the Villa Rufinella in Frascati into comfortable residences. During her husband's reign, they lived at the Palazzo Chiablese, where her husband later died in 1831.\n\nIn 1825, the queen engaged the archaeologist Marquess Luigi Biondi (1776–1839), whose excavation work uncovered Tusculum, an excavation in which Maria Cristina financed.[citation needed] In 1839 and 1840, the architect and archaeologist Luigi Canina (1795–1856) was engaged by the royal family and excavated the Theatre area of Tusculum.[citation needed] The ancient works of art excavated were sent to the Duke of Savoy's Castle of Agliè in Piedmont.\n\nCharles Felix died in 1831 after a reign of ten years. Maria Cristina lived the rest of her life in Turin, Naples, Agliè and Frascati, and died in Savona, Liguria. She was buried beside her husband in the Hautecombe Abbey, Saint-Pierre-de-Curtille.[citation needed] The couple had no children.\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
