The group is composed of undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in the field of communication studies and recognizes their high academic achievement.

Mortar Board

This national honor society, which recognizes college seniors for their achievements in scholarship, leadership, and service, creates opportunities for continued leadership development, promotes service to colleges and universities, and encourages lifelong contributions to the global community.

Mortar Board began in 1918 as the first national organization honoring senior college women. When the society opened its membership to men in 1975, it maintained its ties to its founders and heritage by changing the preamble to its constitution to include a stronger commitment to the advancement of the status of women. Since 1918 more than 22,000 college seniors have been initiated into Mortar Board.

Order of Omega

Order of Omega is a leadership honor society for members of fraternity and sorority organizations. Order of Omega recognizes juniors and seniors who have exemplified high standards in the areas of scholarship, leadership, involvement within their respective organization and within the fraternity/sorority, campus, and local community. Members are selected from the top 3 percent of students at each institution. To date, over 500 chapters have been chartered throughout North America, each sharing the common goal of recognizing the many outstanding student leaders at their institution.

Phi Beta Kappa

University of Puget Sound is one of five private colleges in the Northwest granted a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation’s most distinguished and selective academic honor society. Founded in 1776 at The College of William and Mary, it is the nation’s oldest undergraduate honors organization. It takes its name from the initial letters of its motto, Philosophia Biou Kubernetes, “Philosophy (the love of wisdom) is the guide of life.” The objectives of liberal learning encouraged by Phi Beta Kappa include not merely knowledge but also intellectual honesty, tolerance, and a broad range of intellectual interests. The society’s distinctive emblem, a golden key, is widely recognized as a symbol of academic achievement.

The chapters elect members from candidates for degrees in the liberal arts and sciences, usually from the upper 10th of the graduating class. In addition to an outstanding record of academic achievement, the stipulations for eligibility adopted in 1952 require that candidates have done at least three-quarters of their work in an area of the liberal arts and sciences, as well as demonstrate a knowledge of mathematics and a foreign language.

Phi Eta Sigma

Phi Eta Sigma National Honor Society has been in existence since 1923, and recognizes academic achievement in freshmen. Students with at least a 3.5 GPA as freshmen are eligible for membership. The Puget Sound chapter was established in spring 2006, to follow the great leadership of the SPURS National Honor Society. We continue to promote academic excellence and service to the campus and community.

Phi Kappa Phi

The national Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi had its beginnings at University of Maine in 1897. It was known then as the Lambda Sigma Eta Society and, later, as the Morrill Society, in honor of the sponsor of the congressional act that provided for land-grant colleges. In 1900 it was transformed into a national society by action of a committee composed of the presidents of University of Maine, University of Tennessee, and Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University). The society was renamed Phi Kappa Phi from the initial letters of the Greek words forming its adopted motto: Philosophia Krateito Photon, roughly translated as “Let the love of learning rule humanity.”

The national Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi recognizes and encourages superior scholarship in all academic disciplines. Chapters are granted to institutions that provide the means and atmosphere conducive to academic excellence. Admission to the society is by invitation and requires approval by a chapter in accordance with the bylaws of both the chapter and the national society. Both require superior scholarship and good character as criteria for membership.

Students are nominated for membership by the biology faculty based on their scholarship and research activities.

Theta Alpha Kappa

In 1976, Professor Albert Clark, F.S.C., established Theta Alpha Kappa at Manhattan College in Riverdale (the Bronx), New York for the purpose of recognizing the academic achievements of religion and theology students. Since then, Theta Alpha Kappa has grown to more than two hundred chapters nationally in four-year educational institutions ranging from small religiously affiliated colleges to large public research institutions.

Upisilon Pi Epsilon

Upisilon Pi Epsilon was first organized at Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, in 1967. The international organization now consists of chapters in various colleges and universities in North America and overseas. UPE is the first and only, existing international honor society in the computing and information disciplines. The computing and information disciplines are relatively young. Yet despite their comparative youth, the computing and information disciplines have had an unparalleled effect on almost every aspect of contemporary life. Indeed it is difficult to predict the ultimate place of the computer in our world. It is the express purpose of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) to promote the computing and information disciplines and to encourage their contribution to the enhancement of knowledge.
