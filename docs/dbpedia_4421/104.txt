The Black Students Association, like other older student and departmental groups, declined, as African American counselor Alvin Brannon pointed out, due to the growth of Greek organizations. The Greeks attracted students who might have played active roles elsewhere.

An Inter-Greek Council, established in fall 1977, provided a governing body for organizations that, by 1991, numbered fourteen. Fraternity chapters chartered after 1977 included Kappa Alpha Psi (1982) and Sigma Tau Gamma (1985); sororities included Alpha Sigma Alpha (1982), Sigma Sigma Sigma (1986), Zeta Phi Beta (1990), and Phi Mu (1991). A sorority chapter of Sigma Gamma Rho in 1991 meant that SAU had the “divine nine” of black Greek societies. A local interracial fraternity, Delta Omega Theta—organized in 1988 by Tim Edwards, Raymond Gilbert, and William Lockhart—opened its membership to women in 1989 to erase gender as well as racial distinctions. This group did not survive its founders’ graduations. Both because discrimination was illegal and because of changed attitudes, all groups did on occasion admit members across racial lines. The newest “youth generation’s” fusion of music, dress, and behaviors tended to blur racial distinctions. Greek step shows—rhythmic dance routines with origins in West Africa, a traditional black activity—also appeared among white fraternities and sororities.

Some fraternities continued hazing long after national society guidelines and state law in 1983 forbade the practice. In spite of student affairs personnel’s warnings, surreptitious hazing went on anyway, causing students’ injuries and organizations’ suspension. In general, however, SAU fraternities were unlike the one portrayed in the popular 1978 movie Animal House. The movie did inspire SAU toga parties, Mr. Tush contests, and Miss Mule pageants; however, campus groups were model societies compared to the film’s Delta House. Antics at the annual Inter-Greek Olympics that began in 1984 (changed to SAU Greek Week in 1989) featured innocent activities like three-legged races and the “Great Greek Canoe Race” at the campus pond. Unlike the Delta House residents, SAU Greeks often made the dean’s list for academic honors.

Greek honor societies gave recognition to high-achieving students. Several new ones were established in these years. The Alpha Honor Society in the late 1970s inducted freshmen and sophomores with high grade point averages and served as a counterpart to Alpha Chi that included only juniors and seniors. For some unknown reason, Alpha Honor Society collapsed after four years. New disciplinary academic honor societies founded at SAU in the years after 1976 included psychology’s Psi Chi (March 11, 1991), social science’s Pi Gamma Mu (November 14, 1991), business’s Sigma Beta Delta (June 21, 1995), and agriculture’s Alpha Tau Alpha (1996). More inclusive academic Greek societies included education’s Phi Delta Kappa (September 14, 1982) and legal studies’ Phi Alpha Delta (April 29, 1987).
