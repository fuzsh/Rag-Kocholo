        "text": "Alpha Xi Delta House\n\nThis 19-bed house pays tribute to a historic fraternity house that formerly stood on the site. The new structure reflects some of the opulence of an earlier era, but with modern comforts such as energy-efficient windows, an elevator and zoned heating and cooling.\n\nMonmouth’s Beta Epsilon chapter of Alpha Xi Delta was installed in 1932. After a short hiatus, the chapter returned to campus as part of Fraternity & Sorority Life in 1997. The national women’s fraternity was created in 1893 at the former Lombard College in nearby Galesburg.\n\nKappa Kappa Gamma House\n\nThe Alpha Chapter house was built in 1896, opened in 2017, and is the home of the first Kappa Kappa Gamma chapter in the United States. With 3,516 square feet – including eight rooms and four bedrooms on the finished first and second floors – the home offers a large space for meetings.\n\nThe women’s fraternity movement began at Monmouth in 1867 with the founding of what is now Pi Beta Phi. Along with Kappa Kappa Gamma, the two women’s fraternities are known as the Monmouth Duo.\n\nPi Beta Phi House\n\nPi Beta Phi, founded at Monmouth in 1867 as I.C. Sorosis, was the first secret society for women in the United States to be patterned after men’s Greek letter fraternities.\n\nTheir 15-bed house, finished in 2016, was designed in a modified Greek Revival style to pay tribute to the architecture of Holt House - the original founding house just blocks away from campus. It has a chapter room in the basement, modern furnishings throughout, a kitchen and an outdoor patio and grill. Take a peek inside from the dedication.\n\nAlpha Tau Omega\n\nHome to the brothers of Alpha Tau Omega, there are five student rooms of double occupancy and a chapter meeting room.\n\nFulton Hall Fraternities\n\nFulton Hall is a fraternity residence hall that offers double rooms arranged in corridor fashion. It also offers some single rooms and a few quad rooms. It’s close to the Huff Athletic Center, and you’re never too far away from coffee at Einstein Bros. Bagels in Hewes Library. The hall has a laundry room on the ground floor as well as a spacious lounge and kitchen area.\n\nPhi Delta Theta\n\nSigma Phi Epsilon"
