Their goal is to promote fraternity life on our campus and create a place where discussion of issues can be brought forth by its members. Fraternities foster friendship and provide opportunities for leadership and service on our campus and throughout our communities. Each group is unique and has its own individual history. We hope that you are interested in learning about the traditions of fraternity life and helping to keep those traditions alive as a new member of one of these groups.\n\nConstitution and By-laws\n\nFraternity Recruitment\n\nInterfraternity Council recruitment offers an opportunity to meet chapter members from all three of our NIC Fraternities on campus. Participating in recruitment does not require a person to join a chapter, but it does offer them the opportunity to explore the Greek community and find out about different ways to get involved on campus.\n\nOrganizations\n\nAlpha Gamma Rho (Gamma Gamma)\n\nDelta Chi\n\nPhi Lamba Chi (Nu)\n\nSigma Pi (Epsilon Kappa Chapter)\n\nFall 2023 Schedule of Events for Recruitment\n\nAugust 29, 2023 – Passport to Greek in Grand Hall\n\nSeptember 6, 2023 – MANDATORY Hazing Prevention Seminar\n\nSeptember 18, 2023 – Monday Night Football with IFC in Grand Hall\n\nSeptember 21, 2023 – IFC Burger Cook-off at the Alumni Center\n\nIFC Recruitment Dates"
