        "text": "Pi Sigma Alpha Faculty Chapter Advisors are the life blood of the organization. Each year the national office recognizes several advisors for their service and leadership in one of two categories: Best Chapter Advisor and James Lengle Advisor Recognition Awardee. The former recognizes those advisors who have gone above and beyond in the past academic year to support their students and encourage chapter activities. These awards come with a $250 cash prize. The latter award recognizes one or two faculty members who have served 20+ years and shown exceptional dedication to their chapters and Pi Sigma Alpha. The Lengle award comes with a cash prize of $1000. There is no formal nomination process. In 2015, on the occasion of his retirement as Executive Director, the Executive Council voted to rename the Advisor Recognition Award in James Lengle’s honor."
