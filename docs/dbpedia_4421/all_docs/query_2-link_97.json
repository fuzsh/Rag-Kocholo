The Fraternity and Sorority Life Community Scorecard shows a snapshot of key measures for recognized chapters at Stony Brook University. Please use this information to gauge your initial perspective on our active chapters and allow that to guide your knowledge about that organization. Please remember the information listed reflects where the organization was at during the time this report was compiled and may not reflect current organization status.\n\nSpring 2020 SBU Fraternity and Sorority Life Community Scorecard\n\nFall 2020 SBU Fraternity and Sorority Life Community Scorecard\n\nSpring 2021 SBU Fraternity and Sorority Life Community Scorecard\n\nFall 2021 SBU Fraternity and Sorority Life Community Scorecard\n\nSpring 2022 SBU Fraternity and Sorority Life Community Scorecard\n\nFall 2022 SBU Fraternity and Sorority Life Community Scorecard\n\nSpring 2023 SBU Fraternity and Sorority Life Community Scorecard\n\nFall 2023 SBU Fraternity and Sorority Life Community Scorecard\n\nSpring 2024 SBU Fraternity and Sorority Life Community Scorecard\n\nFor more information about our recognized chapters please see below.\n\nFraternities\n\nName of Chapter Greek Letters Council Recognition Status Alpha Phi Alpha ΑΦΑ NPHC Full Recogntion Iota Nu Delta ΙΝΔ MFSC Full Recognition Kappa Alpha Psi ΚΑΨ NPHC Full Recognition Kappa Sigma ΚΣ IFC Full Recognition Lambda Theta Phi Latin ΛΘΦ LGC Conditionally Recognized Lambda Upsilon Lambda ΛΥΛ LGC Conditionally Recognized Lambda Phi Epsilon ΛΦΕ MFSC Full Recognition MALIK MALIK MFSC Full Recognition Omega Psi Phi ΩΨΦ NPHC Full Recognition Phi Beta Sigma ΦΒΣ NPHC Full Recognition Phi Delta Psi ΦΔΨ MFSC Conditionally Recognized Pi Delta Psi ΠΔΨ MFSC Full Recognition Pi Kappa Phi ΠΚΦ IFC Full Recognition Pi Lambda Phi ΠΛΦ IFC Inactive Tau Kappa Epsilon ΤΚΕ IFC Full Recognition\n\nSororities\n\nName of Chapter Greek Letters Council Recognition Status Alpha Kappa Alpha AKA NPHC Conditionally Recognized alpha Kappa Delta Phi αΚΔΦ MFSC Full Recognition Alpha Sigma Alpha ΑΣΑ NPC Full Recognition Delta Sigma Theta ΔΣΘ NPHC Full Recognition Kappa Phi Lambda ΚΦΛ MFSC Full Recognition Lambda Theta Alpha Latin ΛΘΑ LGC Inactive - Reactivation Omega Phi Beta ΩΦΒ LGC Full Recognition Sigma Gamma Rho ΣΓΡ NPHC Full Recognition Sigma Delta Tau ΣΔΤ NPC Full Recognition Sigma Iota Alpha ΣΙΑ LGC Conditionally Recognized Sigma Iota Sigma ΣΙΣ MFSC Full Recognition Sigma Psi Zeta ΣΨΖ MFSC Full Recognition Theta Phi Alpha ΘΦΑ NPC Probation Zeta Phi Beta ΖΦΒ NPHC Full Recognition\n\nProfessional Fraternities and Sororities\n\nName of Chapter Greek Letters Council Recognition Status Alpha Kappa Psi ΑΚΨ PGC Full Recognition Delta Sigma Pi ΔΣΠ PGC Full Recognition Phi Alpha Delta ΦΑΔ PGC Full Recognition Kappa Kappa Psi KKΨ PGC Full Recognition Phi Delta Epsilon ΦΔΕ PGC Full Recognition Sigma Phi Delta ΣΦΔ PGC Probation Theta Tau ΘΤ PGC Full Recognition"
