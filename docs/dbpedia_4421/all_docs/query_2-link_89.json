These groups benefit from staff advisement, facility usage, funding opportunities, leadership training, educational programming, risk management support, insurance coverage, and engagement with over 240 other recognized student organizations. The recognized organizations that meet their standards of recognition can be found on ROAR*.\n\nGroups that fail to meet recognition expectations or that have engaged in activities that violate organizational or College policies have lost recognition from the College. These unrecognized groups are no longer advised, supported, or regulated by of the College and are considered underground organizations. Despite having lost recognition from the College, some of these underground groups may continue to operate in violation of College directives.\n\nUnderstanding Chapter Statuses\n\nGood Standing\n\nThe organization is current with the Office of Student Life requirements, is not under review by the Office of Student Conduct and Off-Campus Services, and has no pending sanctions for completion.\n\nPending Completion of Sanctions/Probation/Deferred Suspension\n\nThe organization has not yet completed their educational sanctions, probation, or deferred suspension.\n\nEducational Sanctions: In conjunction with any sanction listed below, a recognized student organization found to have been in violation of any of the Recognized Student Organization Privileges and Responsibilities will be assigned educational sanctions that are proportional to the violation such as, but not limited to: work assignments, reflective essays, presentations, research projects, classes/seminars, community service, restitution, conduct contracts, service to the College, action plans, or other discretionary sanctions, etc. If a recognized student organization has any outstanding educational sanctions at the conclusion of organizational probation or deferred suspension, the organization probation or deferred suspension status will remain in effect pending completion of the educational sanctions.\n\nWarning: A notice that the organization is violating or has violated institutional regulations and that further violations may result in more severe disciplinary action.\n\nProbation: A period of time during which any further violation of the Recognized Student Organization Privileges and Responsibilities puts the organization’s status with the College in jeopardy. Restrictive conditions may also be imposed as part of disciplinary action and will vary according to the severity of the offense. Restrictive conditions may include barring or limiting some or all of the organization’s activities and/or privileges (including, but not limited to: social activities, intramural competition, organizational competition, Homecoming, eligibility to receive any College award or honorary recognition, privilege to reserve space on campus, etc.). If a recognized student organization is found “in violation” for another violation of the Recognized Student Organization Privileges and Responsibilities while on organizational probation, more severe sanctions may be imposed. The organization does maintain recognition by the College while on this status.\n\nDeferred Suspension: Organizational deferred suspension is used for offenses found serious enough to warrant organizational suspension, but where the specific circumstances of the case mitigate the offense or for repeated offenses of a less serious nature. Organizational deferred suspension is a designated period of time during which a recognized student organization is given the opportunity to demonstrate the ability to abide by the community’s expectations of behavior articulated in the Recognized Student Organization Privileges and Responsibilities. Any further violations of College policy during the deferred suspension period may result in more serious sanctions including suspension or revocation of recognition. The organization does maintain recognition by the College while on this status.\n\nUnder Conduct Review\n\nThe Office of Student Conduct and Off-Campus Services has received a report of an alleged violation of the TCNJ Recognized Student Organization Privileges and Responsibilities and is in the process of reviewing the alleged incident through the conduct process. Depending on the nature of the alleged violation, interim immediate action may be taken to resolve the situation by placing the organization on a cease and desist or other interim action, only in effect until there is a resolution of the student conduct matter or the cease and desist/interim action is dismissed.\n\nUnrecognized Groups\n\nUnrecognized groups are groups that have had their TCNJ registration as a recognized student organization revoked, a temporary or permanent severance of the organization’s relationship with TCNJ.\n\nSuspension: While on organizational suspension, the organization loses its College recognition and/or registration for a temporary period of time. While an organization is suspended, it may not use College resources or participate as an organization in any College activities or events. All activities, recognized student organization affiliated events and privileges of College/Student Government/Inter-Greek Council/Sports Club Council recognition are suspended for a specific period of time. Before a suspended organization may regain active recognized status after the designated period of time, representatives from the organization and/or the (Inter)National Headquarters must meet with the Office of Student Life or Department of Recreation and Wellness to show satisfactory completion of any assigned directives or to discuss stipulated conditions for the organization to return to recognized student organization status. If new incidents involving the organization occur while on this status, the date they are permitted to return to recognized student organization status will be reset and/or the status may change to revoked.\n\nRevocation: The organization loses recognition from the College and Student Government/Inter-Greek Council/Sports Club Council for a specified period of time. If recognition has been revoked, the organization must comply with any Student Government/Inter-Greek Council/Sports Club Council application (expansion) processes to regain recognition after the period of revocation is exhausted.\n\nImportant Documents and Resources:\n\nRecognized Student Organization Privileges and Responsibilities\n\nExpectations and Standards for Off-Campus Conduct\n\nAlcohol and Other Drug Policy\n\nStudent Conduct Code\n\nConduct Process Overview\n\nOffice of Student Conduct & Off Campus Services\n\nNew Jersey Hazing Law\n\n2C:40-3.
