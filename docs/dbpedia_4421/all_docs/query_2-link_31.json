        "text": "Fraternity and Sorority Recognition Status\n\nThe chapters below are recognized by UD, their national organizations, and their respective governing councils. They have all rights and privileges of being a recognized fraternity or sorority at University of Delaware.\n\nSocial Probation\n\nSocial probation limits the chapter from sponsoring or co-sponsoring programs with alcohol on or off campus. This includes, but is not limited to, date parties, late-night parties, mixers,\n\nformals, and semi-formals.\n\nThe organizations listed below are on social probation:\n\nZeta Beta Tau through December 31, 2024\n\nDisciplinary Probation\n\nDisciplinary Probation is defined as a period of observation and review during which the chapter must demonstrate the willingness and ability to comply with all University regulations.\n\nThe organizations listed below are on disciplinary probation:\n\nSigma Alpha Epsilon through December 31, 2024\n\nAlpha Sigma Phi through December 31, 2024\n\nDeferred Suspension\n\nDeferred suspension from the University is a period of review during which the student organization must demonstrate an ability to comply with University rules, regulations, and all other stipulated requirements. If, during the period of the deferred suspension, the student organization is found responsible for violating the Code of Conduct again, the organization may be immediately suspended from the University.\n\nThe organizations listed below are on deferred suspension:\n\nPhi Kappa Psi through May 31. 2024\n\nZeta Beta Tau through May 31, 2024\n\nTau Kappa Epsilon through May 31, 2025\n\nSuspended\n\nChapters who are suspended may not:\n\n1. Meet as an organization;\n\n2. Recruit members;\n\n3. Engage in social functions of any type;\n\n4. Use University buildings, facilities, property, and equipment;\n\n5. Use University resources, services, or funds;\n\n6. Participate or attempt to participate as an organization in any University event; or\n\n7. Co-sponsor or participate as an organization in another registered/recognized\n\norganization’s activities.\n\nThe organizations listed below are suspended:\n\nDelta Upsilon through May 31, 2024\n\nUnderground Organizations\n\nPlease pay particular attention to underground organizations such as “Machi,” “Kapps,” “APES” and “FIJI” which are former fraternities who have lost recognition due to failure to comply with University policy yet continue to promote themselves as a fraternity. These groups are not recognized by a national organization or the University and, therefore function without any oversight. Any group that is listed as suspended but continues to function would be considered an underground organization. If you are approached by any of these groups, please contact FSLL at 302-831-6167."
