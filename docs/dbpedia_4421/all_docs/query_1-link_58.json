Follow along on social media using #SigmaScholars #MonthoftheScholar\n\n“What I have found to be the most effective is to teach the material to a friend or family member. While explaining it, you will gain a deeper understanding of the material.\n\nAnother fun way to learn difficult subjects is to find videos on the topic. This is especially helpful in understanding the subject from another aspect. Crash Course is a good YouTube channel that I resort to often.\n\nMotivation to study is hard to develop. Thanks to my mom, however, who recently made a wager with me, studying has become more of a fun little competition. Now, for every two hours that I study, my mom has promised to exercise for 20 minutes. Having an accountability buddy (although for different goals) is the best way to go!”\n\nRead more >\n\nJanuary 31, 2017\n\nJoin us in congratulating our 2016 accredited chapters!\n\nPillar 4\n\nAlpha Chi\n\nAlpha Iota\n\nAlpha Pi\n\nAlpha Zeta\n\nBeta Delta\n\nBeta Xi\n\nChi\n\nDelta Pi\n\nEpsilon Rho\n\nEta Kappa\n\nEta Theta\n\nEta Xi\n\nGamma Beta\n\nGamma Pi\n\nGamma Xi\n\nNu\n\nOmicron\n\nPi\n\nTheta Gamma\n\nZeta Alpha\n\nZeta Kappa\n\nPillar 3\n\nAlpha\n\nAlpha Phi\n\nAlpha Rho\n\nAlpha Theta\n\nAlpha Upsilon\n\nBeta Epsilon\n\nBeta Tau\n\nBeta Theta\n\nDelta Upsilon\n\nEpsilon Alpha\n\nEpsilon Chi\n\nEpsilon Eta\n\nEpsilon Iota\n\nEpsilon Nu\n\nEpsilon Phi\n\nEpsilon Pi\n\nEta Beta\n\nEta Pi\n\nEta Upsilon\n\nEta Zeta\n\nGamma Zeta\n\nTheta Alpha\n\nTheta Beta\n\nTheta Delta\n\nTheta Zeta\n\nZeta Gamma\n\nZeta Lambda\n\nZeta Pi\n\nZeta Psi\n\nPillar 2\n\nAlpha Alpha\n\nAlpha Beta\n\nAlpha Delta\n\nAlpha Epsilon\n\nAlpha Mu\n\nAlpha Omicron\n\nAlpha Psi\n\nAlpha Xi\n\nBeta Alpha\n\nBeta Pi\n\nDelta Beta\n\nDelta Delta\n\nDelta Eta\n\nDelta Omicron\n\nDelta Psi\n\nDelta Theta\n\nDelta Zeta\n\nEpsilon Beta\n\nEpsilon Delta\n\nEpsilon Epsilon\n\nEpsilon Gamma\n\nEpsilon Kappa\n\nEpsilon Omicron\n\nEpsilon Psi\n\nEpsilon Tau\n\nEpsilon Theta\n\nEta Alpha\n\nEta Chi\n\nEta Eta\n\nEta Lambda\n\nEta Nu\n\nEta Omicron\n\nEta Phi\n\nEta Psi\n\nEta Sigma\n\nEta Tau\n\nGamma Lambda\n\nGamma Mu\n\nGamma Psi\n\nGamma Rho\n\nLambda\n\nMu\n\nPsi\n\nTheta Eta\n\nTheta Theta\n\nZeta Chi\n\nZeta Delta\n\nZeta Eta\n\nZeta Theta\n\nZeta Upsilon\n\nRead more >\n\nJanuary 9, 2017\n\nApplications are now being accepted for Labyrinth Leadership Experience which will be held June 7-11, 2017.

Sigma Sigma Sigma is proud to have been a part\n\nof the program’s success by being one of the UIFI’s top scholarship providers in 2016.\n\nUIFI is a five-day institute that brings together fraternity men and sorority women to create opportunities to explore, define and enhance their leadership skills, personal awareness, commitment to their fraternity or sorority and grow to expect values-based action from themselves and those they lead. At UIFI, participants are given the skills to improve their own leadership abilities and positively affect their chapter, council and community\n\nIn 2016, 943 students from 298 colleges and universities attended UIFI. This interfraternal program saw participants from 118 fraternities and sororities, including 38 Sigma Sigma Sigma sisters.\n\nLast year, Sigma Sigma Sigma provided scholarships for 23 members to attend UIFI, and the impact on our undergraduates who attended is tangible.“I had the ability to look at the true root of not only my chapter’s issues by my campus’ as well,” Erica Johnson (Pi, Emporia State University) said. “I believe this experience changed my life forever, and I hope that Tri Sigma continues to offer this scholarship.”\n\nOur sisters who participated in UIFI will return to campus this fall prepared to make a positive difference in their chapter and fraternity and sorority community.\n\n“Words cannot begin to explain how empowered, inspired and aware I feel after these few shorts days,” Kristy Pardo (Epsilon Chi, Northeastern University) said. “I have been able to really understand not only what it means to be a Tri Sigma but also a sorority woman.”\n\nStudents reported positive gains in leadership skills, commitment and confidence.\n\n97.37% reported they are a better leader because of UIFI.\n\n97.65% reported that as a result of UIFI, they are going to positively impact their chapter.\n\n96.78% reported that as a result of UIFI, they are going to positively impact their community.\n\nClick here to learn more about the impact of UIFI.

Don’t panic! Here are a few tips to help you to deal with stress during finals week.\n\nPlan ahead. If your university sends out the final exam week in advance, print it off and highlight what days and times your finals are. This will give you an idea of what your priorities need to be when studying.\n\nStart studying as soon as possible. According to psychology theories, our brains are not wired to retain information from simply cramming the night before. The brain needs repeated exposure far enough in advance so it can access information quicker and easier. This means you should start preparing now! Any studying you do in advance will be extremely helpful during finals week.\n\nMake a schedule for the week. The easiest way to do this is in Microsoft Excel, Apple’s Numbers app or Google Sheets. Create color-coded time blocks for your exams and other commitments, and then prioritize your study time accordingly. Make sure you schedule time for sleep and eating, too! Here’s an example:\n\nTake breaks and study for short time periods. Don’t overwhelm yourself with all-nighters and six-hour library trips. Study for 45 minutes to an hour, then reward yourself with a 10-minute break. This is much more effective than studying for a long period of time with a wandering mind. During your break eat a light snack, get up, stretch and get your blood flowing. This will wake up your mind and get you prepared for your next study period.\n\nTake time to relax and de-stress. Take a bath, read a book, listen to some music, do something to take your mind off of studying and school for a few minutes each day. Doing so will allow your mind to refresh and be ready for the next exam and help you maintain your sanity!\n\nRead more >\n\nNovember 8, 2016\n\nBy: Maya Narang, Eta Zeta\n\nChapter members at Eta Zeta, University of Alaska-Anchorage, have known for a long time there are six states without a state hazing law, including Alaska.\n\nSisters decided this semester was the time for Alaska to create a law addressing hazing. As a sorority at the University of Alaska-Anchorage, we have always been held to anti-hazing standards by our values and university regulations; however, it has never been surprising to know that hazing persisted on our campus.\n\nEvery year for National Hazing Prevention Week, chapter members have done their best to spread the word and pledge to not haze members, but this year the chapter wanted to try something bigger. Digging into the laws of other states, chapter members found there are many different penalties for hazing. One state we admired in particular was Colorado, where hazing is a class 3 misdemeanor. The chapter brainstormed about how they could bring a penalty like this to their state.\n\nHazing Prevention Week set the perfect stage. As a chapter, sisters campaigned to create awareness and ultimately end hazing. Gathering support from students and staff of the university was the first step. From there, they lobbied legislators for support. The chapter is now waiting for state legislators to respond so they can help Tri Sigma put an end to hazing in Alaska.\n\nRead more >\n\nNovember 8, 2016\n\nTri Sigma chapters across the country celebrated character during CC! Week last month. Some celebrated by hosting programs during chapter meetings. Other chapters spread kindness throughout their campuses and communities. Read on to learn how different chapters chose to celebrate CC! Week and note ideas your chapter could use next year!\n\nAlpha Beta, Kent State University:\n\nErykah-Nicole Scruggs organized Alpha Beta’s CC! Week activities, focused on the six pillars of character and compassion. Sisters made chocolate-covered Oreos and delivered them to 24 chapters on Kent State University’s campus to brighten their week. Through the delivery of the cookies, the Alpha Beta chapter spread awareness of Character Counts and showed compassion to the entire Greek community.\n\nScruggs held events each night in the sorority house, in which sisters would attend and participate in activities. Through group activities and discussions about responsibility and respect, the chapter learned how to have a strong, positive character. Chapter members also reviewed how to act when they hear something about another sister, what to do when they have an item that needs returned to its correct place in a store, and how to show compassion to all sisters.\n\nOn the final day of CC! Week, Scruggs had sisters anonymously write on a piece of paper something they were struggling with and needed their sisters help with, then displayed those in the chapter house. This emphasized to the chapter how to show compassion to their sisters.\n\nAlpha Epsilon, Northwest Missouri State University:\n\nMembers Avree Sealey and Kaitlyn King coordinated daily events for Alpha Epsilon’s celebration of CC! Week. Monday’s theme was Compassion Across Campus (Caring and Citizenship). Members decorated posters detailing what character means to Tri Sigma, and placed these on public bulletin boards.\n\nOn Tuesday, members celebrated what character means to them personally on social media with a “Humans of New York”-style photo shoot. Sisters celebrated trustworthiness on Wednesday with “Touch a Sigma Who.” Small groups of sisters performed Random Acts of Kindness on Thursday, which included leaving a dollar taped to a vending machine, giving water to joggers, leaving post-it notes around campus, buying coffee for a stranger and smiling at 10 strangers.\n\nAlpha Phi, Central Michigan University:\n\nThe chapter held two different activities during CC! Week. The first was a letter writing session where each member wrote a letter to a person who has had a great impact on the person and helped develop the member’s character. The chapter collected these to mail out on behalf of members.\n\nSisters were also tasked with performing two random acts of kindness during the week, and leaving behind a Sigma Pay It Forward card. Member Amanda Yats said she purchased a coffee for a colleague at work and left behind one of the cards. The next day, the colleague said he paid it forward by purchasing coffee for someone else.\n\nAlpha Rho, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania:\n\nAlpha Rho showcased Character Counts! during an open recruitment event. The chapter opened the event with explanation and an open discussion about what it means to be a woman of character. Members and potential new members worked in groups to create posters with words of wisdom and what it means to have good character. The chapter displayed the posters around campus to show what it means to have good character.\n\nAlpha Theta, Radford University:\n\nInstead of regulating the Character Counts! celebration to just one week, Alpha Theta used the entire month of October to show the importance of character and what it means to Tri Sigma. Throughout the month, sisters left notes around campus with kind and uplifting messages. Some left dollar bills on vending machines with a message reading, “Enjoy a treat on us! Love, Tri Sigma.” Other sisters left extra change in parking meters with a note saying, “Enjoy the extra minutes! Love, Tri Sigma.”\n\nBeta Epsilon, Western Illinois University:\n\nLibby Weaver and Rachel Shive, Beta Epsilon’s Dunham Women of Character Institute attendees, presented a Character Counts! educational to the chapter. The program reviewed how the six pillars of character relates to the values of Sigma. The chapter celebrated the week by spreading positive notes with encouraging messages around campus.\n\nMu, Truman State University:\n\nSydney Spain, the chapter’s Dunham Women of Character Institute delegate, planned several activities for CC! Week. Sydney challenged every member to sum up their legacy into a single sentence. The members also reflected on what Truman’s campus would say about the chapter, as well as what they would want them to say, and to think of ways to bridge the difference.\n\nThroughout the week, each pillar of character was spotlighted on the chapter’s Instagram account, along with a nominated member who lives out that pillar well in their daily life. This was encouraging for not only the women who were nominated, but gave every member the opportunity to personify the pillars and recognize role models within our sisterhood.\n\nSisters were also charged with performing a “Pay it Forward” act of kindness within the chapter or the community. Stories were told of sisters taking care of each other when they were ill, giving cdes to familiar faces they saw walking to class, helping a sister with a broken-down vehicle, picking up books a Truman student had dropped, and many more. The acts were contagious and brought a giving spirit to Mu’s sisterhood for the week and hopefully beyond.hard\n\nPi, Emporia State University:\n\nPi chapter members celebrated CC! Week with a night of character-focused activities they completed together. The leadership co-chairs created posters with the six pillars of character to hang in the chapter’s study room in their house. Members wrote notes with the names of sisters who best represent a certain pillar of character.\n\nThe chapter also completed a compassion activity titled “If You Were in my Shoes You Would Know…” Each member anonymously wrote down two issues or struggles they are currently facing on separate pieces of paper and placed them in a pile. Then each member picked up two random pieces of papers and the chapter sat in a circle and read them to each other. The chapter asked processing questions about how this activity relates to character and how to find commonalities between sisters. The leadership chairs of the chapter reported the activity being a great success, with members unexpectedly having deep moments with one another.\n\nThe chapter closed the night with fun and light-hearted activity, “Touch a Sigma Who,” a program available on Sigma Connect.\n\nEpsilon Epsilon, Stockton U:niversity\n\nEpsilon Epsilon celebrated CC! Week by giving out free goodie bags on campus. The bags were filled with candy and motivational quotes all about character. The chapter used the bags to spread a little positivity around campus.\n\nEpsilon Zeta, Southern Arkansas University:\n\nThe chapter held a character retreat to kickoff CC! Week, facilitated by Essential Sigma Advisor and Character Counts! Advocate Missy Martin. Sisters bonded while learning about the six pillars of character and different ways to demonstrate character every day. During the week, members baked and delivered cookies to their on-campus advisor, Fraternity/Sorority Advisor and Director of Student Activities. Members also chalked the campus with inspiring and encouraging messages to make the students smile. Pictures of the messages started popping up on social media and everyone loved the idea.\n\nEta Kappa, Texas Women’s University:\n\nThe chapter’s Dunham representative gave handouts about the six pillars at chapter meeting to kick off the week. Throughout the week, members wore a different colored shirt, depending on the day/pillar and then also posted a picture or “selfie” for CC! Week. Along with the picture, each member would write a little phrase about the pillar and use the CC! Week hashtags, along with #TWUTriSigma so the chapter could keep track of what they were posting. The chapter worked to inspire conversations both on campus and online about character.\n\nRead more >\n\nNovember 8, 2016\n\nBy Jessica Cummings, Eta Nu\n\nHow can we make sure our sisters are succeeding academically and setting aside enough time for their studies? With each of us juggling countless responsibilities such as jobs, internships, other clubs or organizations, and personal and familial obligations, it can sometimes become hard to balance everything while ensuring that scholarship is our number one priority.\n\nThe Eta Nu Chapter of Ramapo College of New Jersey has been seeking to address these common dilemmas we all face as busy college students. We have recently implemented a scholarship program that encourages members to keep academics at the top of their to-do lists. The newest scholarship program that is certainly making a positive impact is the use of Study Buddies.\n\nEta Nu has started using Study Buddies to encourage sisters to study together. Education Director Marissa Martin grouped sisters based on their majors. Everyone in the chapter has a built-in study group to reach out to and study with at all times, which is the perfect way to cope with the stress of midterms and finals!\n\nMarissa is very excited about Study Buddies and thinks they’re definitely a step in the right direction for Eta Nu.\n\n“Study Buddies give sisters the opportunity to seek help from other sisters within the same major or minor,” Marissa said. “It allows them to ask for help when it comes to studying or writing an essay as well as getting advice on which professors and classes to take. It also allows sisters to collaborate with others whom they wouldn’t normally converse with.”\n\nStudy Buddies are a great resource for sisters to have on campus. Maybe there’s a big test coming up or a sister is unsure about which classes to register for. Just ask a Study Buddy! The chapter has already noted that sisters are working on assignments and studying together much more than in the past.\n\nWith this program, as well as many others, the chapter is working hard toward the goal of academic success. So far, Eta Nu has seen a lot of progress this semester and has gone from logging only 30 hours in the library per week to now logging more than 130 hours per week!\n\nRead more >\n\nNovember 3, 2016\n\nFor the Tri Sigma who yearns to learn and live our mission, vision and values, the Labyrinth Leadership Experience provides a transformational, engaging and inter-generational experience for members to grow in their appreciation of the lifelong commitment associated with membership.\n\nAnnouncing the Labyrinth Leadership Experience 2017\n\nLocation\n\nThe Labyrinth Leadership Experience begins in our Nation’s Capital, Washington, D.C., and culminates with a pilgrimage to the home of Tri Sigma, the Mabel Lee Walton House and National Headquarters in Woodstock, Virginia.\n\nInformation\n\nTwenty participants will be selected to attend the 2017 Labyrinth Leadership Experience June 7-11, 2017.
