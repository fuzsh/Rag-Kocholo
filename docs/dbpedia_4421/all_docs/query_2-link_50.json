A community that aims to add to standard notions of Greek life by offering a space where members of every background or identity can find a home. At SigEp, we prioritize balance in every area of life. From professional development opportunities to high-energy social events, there is a place for everyone within our organization. SigEp is more than just a group of peopleâ€”we are a tight-knit community that fosters lifelong friendships through shared experiences like our recent cabin trip to Lake Tahoe. We strongly believe that one can exist in an active social arena at no cost to their roles outside of SigEp. As a community, we constantly push ourselves to excel socially, professionally, and within the broader Stanford community through a culture that upholds key values such as accountability, trust, and most importantly: balance.\n\nAverage Quarterly Dues: $500 (Financial Aid Available)"
