With spacious two-man rooms in its recently renovated facility, it offers one of the best values in student housing at Washburn University. Brothers receive complimentary breakfasts, Monday night catered dinners, high speed internet, cable TV, and security- monitored and lighted off street parking among numerous benefits - all at a reasonable cost.\n\nBrotherhood\n\nThe day you become an Alpha Delta is the moment you become part of something special. The true ties and friendships are something you hold on to until the end of time. Here at Alpha Delta, you are a brother, and you matter regardless of class classification, position, years of membership, etc. You mean something. You are a difference maker. It is the great brothers in this fraternity that bring out the best in you.\n\nBeing Local means self-governance and independence\n\nBeing a local organization, Alpha Delta Fraternity has the ability to govern their own housing facility, create their own rules, policies and procedures in a democratic fashion central to our values. Our organization does not belong to an int/national fraternity, which allows our Chapter to not worry that its reputation becomes tarnished because of a mistake or mishap at another university."
