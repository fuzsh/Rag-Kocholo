        "text": "September 22, 2023\n\nTri Sigma has announced a new collegiate chapter leadership structure designed to create a more streamlined and efficient system for chapters. This change hopes to alleviate many of the struggles our chapters have faced, such as long committee meetings, unbalanced responsibilities, cluttered officer communication, and a lack of clarity of roles and reporting.\n\nAdditionally, the new position titles are more in line with similar post-collegiate professional roles, and the revised structure more closely reflects those in corporate settings.\n\nTri Sigma’s new collegiate leadership structure consists of an 8-person officer team, as well as 10 manager positions, three additional optional positions based on chapter needs, and the opportunity for as many chapter advisory positions as needed to support the chapter. Chapters with less than 20 members eligible to serve in these positions follow the Minimalistic Leadership Structure (MLS) that combines officer responsibilities resulting in a 4-person officer team.\n\nThe new structure aims to provide:\n\nTransferable real-world experience for our members\n\nFurther development of leaders who guide the direction of the chapter\n\nIncreased effectiveness in addressing individual member and chapter needs\n\nStreamlined communication channels both locally and nationally\n\nWe look forward to offering more specific leadership development opportunities, as well as additional training, resources, and targeted communications.\n\nThe Chapter Advisory Board structure has been updated to better support chapter leaders and provide C.A.B.s with the autonomy to recruit advisors to serve on the board.\n\nThe new roles will begin in January 2024.\n\nRead more >\n\nMarch 27, 2023\n\nTri Sigma has received the Campus Prevention Network Seal of Prevention for the second year in a row. Presented by Vector Solutions, the CPN Seal of Prevention represents the highest standard for online prevention education with a rigorous set of criteria to ensure a measurable impact is made across the critical areas of sexual assault, alcohol and drug misuse, mental health, and diversity and inclusion.\n\nTri Sigma is committed to promoting a safe environment and educating students and advisors on harm reduction through education, training, and tools to help students make responsible choices and to understand the consequences of their choices.\n\n“Since implementing GreekLife.Edu, we have seen a 34% decrease of high-risk drinkers and 52% increase in members’ confidence in intervening to help another member,” said Tri Sigma’s Associate Director of Enablement Lorin Phillips. “Harm reduction is often less about policies and more about taking care of one another, creating a culture of care, and caring enough to confront another member if they demonstrate harmful behaviors.”\n\nIn addition to recruiting and training highly skilled SAFE Team volunteers, Tri Sigma’s data-driven prevention plan includes the Prevention Institute, a biennial in-person program focused on helping students develop the skills needed to create their own local prevention plan, including chapter retreats to proactively prevent high-risk behaviors within their chapter.\n\n“This recognition from the Campus Prevention Network is a testament to the staff, volunteers, and chapter officers who work tirelessly to foster a safer and more inclusive collegiate experience for our members,” said Tri Sigma National President Joyce Newcom O’Daniel. “We appreciate Vector Solutions and the resources they provide to assist us in our harm prevention and inclusion efforts.”\n\nCriteria for the CPN Seal of Prevention is based on the Principles of Effective Prevention Programs. More than 1,000 campuses and organizations are evaluated annually to determine eligibility.\n\n“Our team at Vector Solutions is proud to recognize the great value these leading institutions and organizations are providing to students and the commitment we share to making higher education communities safer and more inclusive.”\n\nA full list of the 2022 recipients of the Campus Prevention Network Seal of Prevention and more information on the award can be found here.\n\nRead more >\n\nSeptember 26, 2022\n\nThe Tri Sigma Foundation is pleased to announce Shelly Bateman, an initiate of the Beta Epsilon Chapter at Western Illinois University, has been named Executive Director. She will lead the Foundation’s mission of funding an exceptional Tri Sigma member experience through leadership development and programming, scholarships to offset the rising cost of higher education, grants for cutting-edge children’s therapy, and partnership with the March of Dimes.\n\nShelly brings with her more than 20 years of fundraising and non-profit management experience. She most recently served as the Associate Executive Director of the Illinois Association of School Boards. Prior to that, she served for nearly 10 years at March of Dimes within public policy and governmental affairs.\n\n“In addition to extensive non-profit experience and strong fundraising and community relations acumen, Shelly brings with her strategic leadership and a passion for Tri Sigma,” said JeanMarie Komyathy, chair of the Foundation’s board of directors. “I am thrilled to welcome her to the Foundation, and I am confident the organization will thrive under her leadership.”\n\nOver the next three years, Bateman’s leadership will be crucial as the Tri Sigma Foundation’s strategic focus will focus on providing opportunities for members to financially support an exceptional member experience through increased fundraising and relationship development efforts. Additionally, the Tri Sigma Foundation will prioritize growing the human and financial resources needed to strengthening Tri Sigma now and in the future.\n\n“I am honored to have been selected as the Executive Director and use my skills and experience to lead an organization that provides amazing resources to support and empower the initiatives of Sigma Sigma Sigma,” Bateman said. “Tri Sigma has been a meaningful part of my life for many years, and I am deeply committed to our continued growth, innovation and ever-forward progress.”\n\nShelly has served Tri Sigma as a volunteer in various capacities, including the Tri Sigma Foundation Board of Directors. Her previous volunteer roles as Recruitment and Essential Sigma Advisor, Dunham Women of Character Education Advocate, and March of Dimes Committee Chair have uniquely positioned her to better understand the impact of Tri Sigma’s mission.\n\nBorn and raised in the Chicagoland-area, she currently resides in Springfield, Illinois, with her husband, Tony, their two children Mariah and Jameson, and bonus daughter Zoe. Shelly holds a master’s degree in business administration from Louisiana State University-Shreveport and a Bachelor of Social Work degree from Western Illinois University. She begins her new role on October 17.\n\nRead more >"
