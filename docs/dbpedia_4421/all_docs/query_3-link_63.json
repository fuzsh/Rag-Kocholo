For over a century, Sinfonians in nearly every field of study and professional endeavor have transformed music in America. The opportunity of becoming a Sinfonian is offered to as many men as possible who, through a love for music, can assist in the fulfillment of the Fraternity’s Object and ideals either by adopting music as a profession, or by working to advance the cause of music in America.\n\nPsi Sigma Phi\n\nOur mission is not to increase membership; it is to open eyes; to broaden the views of men in our society.

Our Steed is Service. We are The Almighty Knights of Psi Sigma Phi Multicultural Fraternity, Incorporated.
