        "text": "Monmouth College has a long tradition of supporting both men’s and women’s fraternal organizations on campus. These organizations contribute significantly to our students’ personal development and supporting them is an important initiative in the College’s strategic plan.\n\nAfter 50 years in the Fraternity Complex, Illinois Gamma Chapter will be moving in to a stately, Queen Anne-style residence, located at 815 E. Broadway. The chapter house will join several other fraternities and sororities as a modern-day Greek Row for Monmouth College. This house will reflect the character, strength, achievement, and legacy of Sigma Phi Epsilon.\n\nRenovation plans include interior and exterior updates, along with landscaping for the front and back of the house. The property also includes an adjacent garage that will be completely remodeled and converted into a chapter/ritual room and will also serve as a location to host special events and recruitment activities.\n\nWe aim to raise more than $450,000 in current gifts and pledges for house renovations, demonstrating strong momentum by a cadre of brothers ready to step up and lead.\n\nSigma Phi Epsilon Fundraising Progress\n\nGoal amount: $450,000+ Our Goal\n\nCurrent amount: $413,877 Raised and Pledged\n\nConstruction on the house will begin when 100 percent of the renovation costs are pledged and 75 percent is in hand. Once the funds for the renovations are reached, we hope to push for an additional $300,000 to establish an endowed maintenance fund that will ensure the longevity and maintenance of the new Sigma Phi Epsilon Illinois Gamma Chapter House.\n\nTogether, let us share the heart of Sigma Phi Epsilon with future brothers for generations to come. Let’s pass along the legacy of brotherhood with a fraternity house our active members can be proud to call home.\n\nThere are unique opportunities for naming, memorial, and leadership gifts.\n\nSupport Sig Ep Today!\n\nPrimary contacts for gifts\n\nHannah Maher\n\nVice President for Development and College Relations\n\nhmaher@monmouthcollege.edu\n\n309-457-2231\n\nGena Alcorn ’88, CFRE - Contact for Sigma Phi Epsilon\n\nAssistant Vice President of Development & Legacy Giving\n\ngalcorn@monmouthcollege.edu\n\n309-457-2427\n\nHouse Fund Steering Committee\n\nEric Ealy ’86 Bill Goldsborough ’65 Pete Lipinski ’13 Bill Murschel ’75 Scott Shaw ’03 Joe Svoboda ’75\n\nRoy Sye ’13\n\nBill Turner ’93\n\nJohn Welsh ’78\n\nPete Widolff ’88\n\nThe Campaign\n\nThe Selection of 815 East Broadway\n\nGreek Life at Monmouth College"
