Per The Golden Rule, it is a violation of the Organizational Rules of Conduct to participate in any event with a registered student organization that is currently on disciplinary probation (with restrictive conditions), has been suspended, or has had their UCF registration revoked.\n\nGood Standing\n\nThe organization is current with Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life and Office of Student Involvement requirements, is not under review by the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities, and has no pending sanctions for completion. (F = Fraternity / S = Sorority)\n\nDiversified Greek Council (DGC)\n\nalpha Kappa Delta Phi (S)\n\nChi Upsilon Sigma (S)\n\nDelta Epsilon Psi (F)\n\nDelta Phi Lambda (S)\n\nDelta Phi Omega (S)\n\nLambda Phi Epsilon (F)\n\nLambda Theta Alpha (S)\n\nLambda Theta Phi (F)\n\nMu Sigma Upsilon (S)\n\nPi Delta Psi (F)\n\nSigma Lambda Beta (F)\n\nSigma Lambda Gamma (S)\n\nInterfraternity Council (IFC)\n\nAlpha Tau Omega (F)\n\nBeta Theta Pi (F)\n\nDelta Sigma Phi (F)\n\nDelta Tau Delta (F) ** Coming Fall 2024**\n\nDelta Upsilon (F)\n\nKappa Sigma (F)\n\nPhi Gamma Delta (F)\n\nPi Kappa Phi (F)\n\nSigma Alpha Epsilon (F)\n\nSigma Chi (F)\n\nTau Epsilon Phi (F) ** Coming Fall 2024 **\n\nTau Kappa Epsilon (F)\n\nTheta Chi (F)\n\nZeta Beta Tau (F)\n\nNational Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)\n\nAlpha Phi Alpha (F)\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha (S)\n\nDelta Sigma Theta (S)\n\nIota Phi Theta (F)\n\nKappa Alpha Psi (F)\n\nOmega Psi Phi (F)\n\nPhi Beta Sigma (F)\n\nSigma Gamma Rho (S)\n\nZeta Phi Beta (S)\n\nPanhellenic Council (PAN)\n\nAlpha Delta Pi (S)\n\nAlpha Epsilon Phi (S)\n\nAlpha Xi Delta (S)\n\nChi Omega (S)\n\nDelta Delta Delta (S)\n\nDelta Zeta (S)\n\nGamma Phi Beta (S)\n\nKappa Alpha Theta (S)\n\nKappa Delta (S)\n\nKappa Kappa Gamma (S)\n\nPi Beta Phi (S)\n\nZeta Tau Alpha (S)\n\nPending Completion of Sanctions/Probation/Suspension\n\nThe organization has not yet completed their educational sanctions, probation, and/or suspension.\n\nEducational Sanctions: In conjunction with any sanction listed below, a registered student organization found to have been in violation of any of the Organizational Rules of Conduct will be assigned educational sanctions that are proportional to the violation such as, but not limited to: reflective/research papers, classes/seminars, community service, restitution, interviews, etc. If a registered student organization has any outstanding educational sanctions at the conclusion of organizational probation or organizational suspension, the organizational probation or organizational suspension will remain in effect pending completion of the educational sanctions.\n\nProbation: A period of time during which any further violation of the Organizational Rules of Conduct puts the registered student organization’s status with the University in jeopardy. Restrictive conditions may also be imposed as part of disciplinary probation and will vary according to the severity of the offense. Restrictive conditions may include barring or limiting some or all of the organization’s activities and/or privileges (including, but not limited to: social activities; intramural competition; organizational competition; Homecoming; eligibility to receive any University award or honorary recognition; privilege to occupy a position of leadership or responsibility in any University registered student organization governing body, publication, or activity; or ability to represent the University in an official capacity or position). If a registered student organization is found “in violation” for another violation of the Organizational Rules of Conduct while on organizational probation, more severe sanctions may be imposed.\n\nDeferred Suspension: Organizational deferred suspension is used for offenses found serious enough to warrant organizational suspension, but where the specific circumstances of the case mitigate the offense or for repeated offenses of a less serious nature. Organizational deferred suspension is a designated period of time during which a registered student organization is given the opportunity to demonstrate the ability to abide by the community’s expectations of behavior articulated in the Organizational Rules of Conduct. For more, please see The Golden Rule.\n\nSuspension: While on organizational suspension, the registered student organization loses it University recognition and/or registration for a temporary period of time. While an organization is suspended, it may not use University resources or participate as an organization in any University activities or events.\n\nDiversified Greek Council (DGC)\n\nn/a\n\nInterfraternity Council (IFC)\n\nn/a\n\nNational Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)\n\nn/a\n\nPanhellenic Council (PAN)\n\nn/a\n\nUnder Conduct Review\n\nThe Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) has received a report of an alleged violation of the UCF Rules of Conduct. OSRR is in the process of reviewing the alleged incident through the Organization Conduct Review Process. For more, please see The Golden Rule\n\nInterim Suspension: Where deemed necessary to protect the safety and well-being of others, of the university, or of property, the Director of the OSRR or designee, upon notifying the VP of SSWB or designee, may take immediate action to resolve the situation by placing the registered student organization on interim suspension. Interim organizational suspension is not a sanction. Interim organization suspension is preliminary in nature; it is in effect only until there is a resolution of the student conduct matter.\n\nDiversified Greek Council (DGC)\n\nn/a\n\nInterfraternity Council (IFC)\n\nPhi Delta Theta\n\nPending\n\nNational Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)\n\nn/a\n\nPanhellenic Council (PAN)\n\nn/a\n\nOrganizations Approved for Expansion\n\nDiversified Greek Council (DGC)\n\nInterfraternity Council (IFC)\n\nUnrecognized Groups\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The organizations listed below are not currently recognized by the University. In some cases this is due to their voluntary disaffiliation from the institution and in some cases it is due to the National office revoking their recognition. They are no longer under the sanction of the University, however, as they had their UCF Registration revoked, resulting in a permanent severance of the organization’s relationship with UCF.
