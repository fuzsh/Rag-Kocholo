        "text": "Alpha Phi Omega is a national co-ed service fraternity, deeply rooted in the teachings of the Boy Scouts of America. It was founded in 1925 by a young man named Frank Reed Horton at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. Famous American leaders have even left their mark in Alpha Phi Omega such as John F. Kennedy and Michelle Obama. Our specific chapter, Alpha Gamma Iota, at the University City location was founded in March 24th, 1991 by 23 founders. Since then our chapter has blossomed into what it has become now. As of 2016, we have 71 active, graduate, and associate brothers.\n\nAs a service fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega welcomes all students—regardless of gender, color, religion, sexual orientation, course of study, or other fraternal affiliations. Our main purpose as an organization is to allow members the chance to develop leadership skills through volunteer opportunities in the chapter, campus, community, and national levels. We achieve this through annual service events such as Soup Kitchen, Blood Drives, Senior Home, Tent City, Pancakes for Pups, Boo at the Zoo, Vagina Monologues, etc. We also value our close-knit family atmosphere among our members. We achieve this through many fellowship events such as Progressive Dinner, Restaurant Outings, Secret Santa, Ice Skating, Brother Dates, and a Spring Formal. Come join our brotherhood to integrate yourself in the campus, give back to the community, and make friendships that last a lifetime.\n\nAdvisor: Jessica Sautter, j.sautter@usciences.edu\n\nDelta Chi is an International social fraternity that believes great advantages are to be derived from the brotherhood of college and university men, appreciating that close association may promote friendship, develop character, advance justice, and assist in the acquisition of a sound education.\n\nStarted as a Colony in the Fall of 2007, The University of the Sciences in Philadelphia chapter of the Delta Chi Fraternity has continuously worked to better the organization and the members who are involved. The colony evolved as more and more members joined.\n\nThe Chapter was founded September 10, 2011 when the International Organization recognized that this colony deserved to have a Charter and stay on campus. Since the colony days, Delta Chi has continued to lead the local Inter-Greek Council, Student Government, and various clubs as a beacon of success.\n\nAdvisor: Brian Colfer, bcolfer@usciences.edu\n\nChapter E-mail Address: a.uspdeltachi@gmail.com\n\nPhi Kappa Psi is a national social fraternity founded on the great joy of serving others. This fraternity was founded nationally February 19th, 1852; during a typhoid fever epidemic, to help and serve others in the community.\n\nLocally, the brotherhood was founded on October 12th, 1996. The brotherhood not only has a strong presence on campus, but a direct interaction with the community, through philanthropy and other events. The fraternity is going on the 20th year as a chapter at USciences, since then Phi Psi brothers have held positions as orientation leaders, resident advisors, leaders of various organizations such as SGA, Inter-Greek Council, etc.\n\n“The Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity engages men of integrity, further develops their intellect and enhances community involvement. With a legacy built on acceptance and trust, each brother realizes his highest potential through a lifelong experience of service and excellence.”\n\nAdvisor: TBD\n\nTwitter: @phipsiuscip\n\nSigma Beta Rho Fraternity INC., is a National Multicultural fraternity based on the pillars of Society, Brotherhood, and Remembrance. We were established at the University of the Sciences on April 26th, 2003 as the Phi Chapter. Every year, our brothers work together within the community to raise money for our philanthropy, SOS Children's Villages, which focuses on Youth Education and Development. Our brothers here at the Phi chapter continue to excel both in the fields of academics and community service. With the hard work from our motivated alumni and undergraduate brothers, we look forward to continuously grow for years to come.\n\nAdvisor: Stephanie Gallagher, st.gallagher@usciences.edu"
