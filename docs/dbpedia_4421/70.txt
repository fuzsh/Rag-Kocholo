INDIANAPOLIS, Indiana – The Delta Chi Fraternity is excited to announce that an interest group has been approved to join the Interfraternity Council at Southern Arkansas University (SAU), beginning spring 2022.

Southern Arkansas University is home to three other fraternities (Alpha Gamma Rho, Sigma Pi, and Phi Lambda Chi). With a 3.2 community GPA and an average chapter size of 22 members, the Greek community on campus has not seen fraternity expansion since 2010. SAU has 4,700 students (44% male) and is primarily a residential campus located in Magnolia, Arkansas. This will be Delta Chi’s second organization in the state of Arkansas.

Our current interest group members worked all semester to learn more about Delta Chi through our Louisiana Tech Chapter, Grant Herrin (Regent for Region III) Will Baker (Vice Regent for Regent III), and Delta Chi field operations staff. After several campus presentations with the Fraternity & Sorority Life staff on campus, student government, and the University’s student affairs department, Delta Chi is excited to join the SAU community. Delta Chi will be implementing our founding father and Associate Member educational programs with our newest organization starting in the spring.

If you’d like more information about Delta Chi expansions or have questions, please contact Heather Lockwood, Senior Director of Field Operations, at hlockwood@deltachi.org.
