Mosby Academy in 1967. At the time, he was interested in pursuing a career in space engineering and attended the Florida Institute of Technology for one year.\n\nJimmy was what one could call a “Renaissance Man”: kind, gentle, wise, and highly intelligent. His abilities ranged from exploring the intricacies of a motor to pondering the existential issues of human existence. He loved astronomy, archeology, art, and literature. One of his great regrets was never getting to see the Egyptian pyramids.\n\nHe was awed and delighted by the beauty and wonderments of “Mother Nature”. This love of the outdoors led him to spend six years working with his friend Rice Matthews as a stone mason, building/repairing walls, chimneys, fireplaces, and patios in the surrounding counties. Each man had his own style, and they complemented one another beautifully.\n\nThen, Jimmy accepted a position as a property manager for Knowles Partnership, enabling him to move his family onto “Ah, Wilderness!” Farm near Linden. Here, he was in his element. He boarded horses, raised a few head of cattle, and rented the pasture to other farmers. Depending upon the season, each day on the farm demanded a variety of tasks: caring for the animals, mowing, cutting and stacking wood (someone commented that even the woodpile was a work of art), plowing snow, maintaining the ditches so the road wouldn’t wash away, bushhogging, fixing fences, keeping the tractors, trucks, and cars running…to name a few. Jimmy was simply competent, the most capable man most people would ever know. He could fix, fabricate, or build anything he set his mind to, and everything was done with pride and craftsmanship.\n\nJimmy was well-liked and respected. When it was time to collect the rent from the apartments and townhouses he managed, he was always welcome, even if he had to gently remind folks that their rent was overdue. It was not unusual to be invited in for a “shot of bourbon.” He enjoyed the conversations and stories of others. His circle of friends was huge and diverse. Everyone had a story; he was a great listener and unafraid to be honest when asked for advice. He possessed a witty and playful sense of humor, always ready to laugh with others and, occasionally, at himself.\n\nAnimals instinctively recognized him as trustworthy, knowing they were safe and, if injured, would receive proper care. Over the years, he raised and rescued a host of two and four-legged friends: cats, dogs, a rooster, an owl, peacocks, ducks, flying squirrels, and deer. The owl was particularly special. “Hooter” would follow Jimmy around the farm as he fixed fences, greet him upon his return home, and land on his outstretched arm when Jimmy was properly prepared. He was never alone on walks but always accompanied by his menagerie.\n\nEven as he neared the end, he was still mindful. Aware that we were trying to reposition or pamper him, he would grow weary and say, “Now, you girls, need to stop”. But his words were never uttered in anger. Jimmy was a GENTLEman to the end.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at a later date.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to Blue Ridge Hospice, 333 West Cork Street, Winchester, Virginia; Humane Society of Warren County, 1245 Progress Drive, Front Royal, Virginia; or International Foundation for CDKL5 Research (IFCR), P.O.

Zion Cemetery in Luray.\n\nMr. Jenkins was born March 23, 1947, in Luray, Virginia, the son of the late Nolan Price Jenkins and Neva Alger Jenkins Manning.\n\nHe retired after many years as a plumber from Sterling Plumbing. However, he wanted to stay busy, so he worked as a Security Guard for Skyline Ranch Resort in Warren County.\n\nMr. Jenkins was a U.S. Army Veteran serving in Vietnam. He was a member of the Loyal Order of the Moose #829 in Front Royal and enjoyed spending time at the Strasburg and Woodstock Moose Lodges.
