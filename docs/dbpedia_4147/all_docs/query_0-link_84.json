P. Fahey is superintendent, in which three men were killed instantly and thirteen others were badly, and one or two perhaps fatally injured.\n\nThe Killed\n\nJos.

Murphy was on the descending loaded cars; the others were all on the ascending empties. None of the cars were thrown from the track by collision.\n\nHow it Happened\n\nAs stated, the accident happened on the incline plane during the first trip of the day. The ascending cars are always empty and they meet the descending loads at an automatic switch half way up the incline. Here, of course, if the switch is properly set, they pass each other, keep to the track to the right and there is seldom any difficulty in passing. William Stowell, a lad sixteen or seventeen years old, is charged with setting the switch, and it is thought that in some way he neglected to perform his duty properly and hence the trips collided while going at a high speed.\n\nThe men were all riding up the incline on their way to work in or about the mines.\n\nCondry and Blantt were killed instantly. Hamilton died at 8:30 o'clock this morning. Father Quinn, of Barton, and Scarpatti, of Morantown, were quickly on the scene.\n\nStore Turned Into Hospital\n\nThe injured in the mine accident have all been taken to Gannon's store at Franklin, which has been turned into a temporary hospital. All the physicians of Piedmont and Westernport are in attendance.\n\nKight Has Since Died\n\nSince the above story was written Mr. Edward Kight has died. Mr. L. C. Lambert and the three Italians who were seriously injured were taken to the Hoffman Hospital at Keyser. Mr. Kight died at 12:20. The others who were injured were taken to their homes, none of whom were seriously injured.\n\nMr. Lambert and the three Italians were reported in a critical condition at 4 o'clock.\n\nThe Evening Times, Cumberland, January 25, 1909\n\n(Courtesy of Charles Riend)\n\nPosted August 4, 2010\n\nCONDRY, James S.\n\nJames Condry's Funeral\n\nThe funeral services of James Condry, of Westernport, was held this morning from St. Peter's Catholic Church.
