He died peacefully with his beloved wife Jean and children by his side. Jim was born on September 20, 1930 in Dallas, TX to Roland Mason and May Corine Shiflett. As a young man he loved riding his bike to the swimming hole, digging caves in the vast back yard, correcting the minister of his church when he repeated a sermon, debating his classmates, and looking up to his older brothers. He started his mission in the Presbyterian Ministry in his early twenties after graduating from McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago. He was the Pastor of several churches throughout the Chicago area and suburbs, always bringing his love, passion and energy to his parishioners. He retired at age 65, but continued to do interim ministry work. During this time, he went back to school and received his Doctorate of Divinity at the age of 77. He also had the privilege of marrying & baptizing several of his children, grandchildren and many other family members and friends. He was the co-founder of the Body Politic Theatre in Chicago, working there as the Director of the theater complex. He went on to create The Dream Theatre which ran for several years, culminating in a tour of New York city, Baltimore, and several other US locations. Jim saw the world not as it was, but as it could be, and was active in the early, nonviolent Civil Rights movement during the 1960's. He was one of 43 northern clergymen who joined Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in Albany, Georgia to protest discriminatory Jim Crow laws. In 1979, he met the love of his life, Jean. They were married in 1980 and were together over 40 years. He dedicated much of his retirement attending his grandchildren's many activities and events. He and Jean moved to South Carolina in 2011, where he became very active at St Giles Presbyterian Church, performing oral tellings at services from memorized bible texts with multiple narrators from the congregation who he coached. He also valued his men's luncheon group every Monday. Jim was a mesmerizing story teller. At family gatherings he would often be found with an audience of intent listeners, embroiled in stories from the bible, politics and family history. As patriarch of the family, he was a wonderful Father and loving Grandfather, always searching for an opportunity to listen, teach and guide. A gentle, strong, and loving man, Jim had a powerful impact on thousands of lives, and will be greatly missed by all whom he touched.
