The engine was so massive and produced so much energy that a Hamilton Standard 13 feet 4 inch propeller, the largest of WWII, was required. The F4U was the first American fighter aircraft to exceed 400 MPH. The Corsair was referred to by the Japanese as \"Whispering Death\" and became a legend in its own time. This aircraft was one of the most distinctive designs with its bent wings making it an icon.",
