A friend reported seeing seventy-nine dead Yankees on one side of the road and thirty-three on the other only one mile from New Market, indicating that enemy losses must have been severe. General Imboden lost a number of members of the 62nd Virginia in the engagement and captured a number of prisoners. Two hundred and thirty prisoners, including those Imboden captured previously from the 1st New York Cavalry, have arrived in Staunton, with more on their way. In the 62nd Regiment, Captain Currence was killed and Captains Chipley, Bastable, Hill, Holt, Smith, and Woodson were wounded. The Cadets of the Virginia Military Institute were in this fight and performed well. Captain R. H. Phillips of Staunton provided a list of the killed and wounded from the Institute, including Cadet Stuart of Augusta County and C. W. Turner of Staunton, both wounded. Other cadets from Staunton participated in the fight but were unharmed, including A. Stuart, C. Taylor, J. Stuart, William Crawford, C. Harrison, and S. T. Phillips.\n\nThe Staunton Artillery, under the command of Captain Garber of Staunton, maintains the high reputation it earned in First Manassas with its performance recently at Spotsylvania Court House. The Richmond Howitzers left their guns, and General Lee called for volunteers to replace them. The Staunton Artillery volunteered, operated the Howitzer Battery and two others, and worked so efficiently that General Lee noticed the performance. From the Staunton Artillery, James T. Burns was killed, and Sergeant John Bryan, Sergeant John Butler, Corporal Benjamin Pforr, Private W. C. Smith, Private Peter Good, Private John Stirewalt, Private Christian Huffman, Private Peter Proctor, Private Benjamin Ford, and Private Henry Woods were wounded, all slightly except Pforr, who is supposed to be mortally wounded.\n\nCorporal Cicero Bare, 29, died in the hospital at Gordonsville on May 12, 1864. He was the son of John Bare of Augusta County. At the beginning of the war, he volunteered in the Company called \"Lee Rifles,\" commanded at first by Captain Robert D. Lilley and now called Company D, 25th Virginia Infantry. On May 6, he was wounded severely in the shoulder with a ball penetrating to his back. He was \"an affectionate son and Brother, much beloved by his companions in arms, and esteemed an excellent soldier.\" In his last letter to his father, he stated his hope to escape as he had in former campaigns but added \"'If I fall it shall be with my face to the enemy. I will never fill a coward's grave.'\""
