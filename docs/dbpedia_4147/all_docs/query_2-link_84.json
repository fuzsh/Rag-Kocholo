        "text": "Cupp Cemetery\n\nby Joshua Heston\n\nIt was a bright March afternoon in 2010 and I was exploring little Cupp Cemetery in rural Taney County, Missouri. The cemetery was founded in 1844 and named for the family of Isaac Cupp.\n\nPepper Jackson, a southwest Missouri native, was kind enough to share with StateoftheOzarks his family geneaology in relationship to the little cemetery in the shadow of Bear Mountain. Isaac Cupp was an ancestor.\n\nDespite the roaring traffic — the place is within spitting distance of Highway 65 just north of Branson — there is a sense of quietness in the cemetery, a strong reminder this is sacred ground.\n\nCedars shade the corners while yucca — planted who knows how many years ago — sprout from gravesides, continuing a long tradition of placing evergreen plants in cemeteries — a symbol of everlasting life (Plate 9).\n\n“Waiting for Us” says one tombstone. Another, “Mother and Baby At Rest.” Eerily enough, cattle bones are scattered through Cupp, a reminder that pastureland is right over the old woven wire fence (Plate 5).\n\nLives were left here along with uncounted tears. Its the distillation of the Ozarks’ Christian faith, of grief, decay, and hope, all beneath the gnarled limbs of ancient oaks and tall, seemingly eternal blue sky.\n\nCupp Cemetery is sacred ground a long ways from the hustle of a modern world believing itself important.\n\nJune 17, 2013\n\nCupp Family History\n\nfrom Pepper Jackson\n\nGenerations of Isaac Cupp (Jackson family descendents): Isaac Cupp was born in Holland and immigrated to the United States.
