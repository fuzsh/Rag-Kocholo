The engine was so massive and produced so much energy that a Hamilton Standard 13 feet 4 inch propeller, the largest of WWII, was required. The F4U was the first American fighter aircraft to exceed 400 MPH. The Corsair was referred to by the Japanese as \"Whispering Death\" and became a legend in its own time. This aircraft was one of the most distinctive designs with it bent wings making it an icon.\n\nThe Aircraft\n\nIn September 1942 James Cupp joined VMF-213 âHellhawksâ based in Hawaii and transferred to Espiritu Santo arriving on March 1, 1943. Their Grumman F4F-3 Wildcats were replaced with Chance Vought F4U Corsairs. July 15, 1943 Cupp scored two victories and three days later became an Ace. His official total is 12 confirmed kills. Cupp had his wifeâs name âDaphne Câ painted on the aircraft. On September 20, 1943 Cupp was shot down and severely burned spending a year and a half in hospital. Cupp retired from the USMC in 1968.\n\nSpecifications :\n\nTotal Aircraft Manufactured: 12,571 of 24 variants Manufactured By: Vought and under license by Goodyear and Brewster Crew: 1 pilot Performance Powerplant: 1 x Pratt & Whitney R-2800-8W radial engine producing 2,250 HP (1,678 kW) Maximum Speed: 425 mph (369 kn / 684 kph) Service Ceiling: 36,900 ft (11,200 m) Rate of Climb: 3,180 ft/min (16.2 m/s) Range: 1,015 mi (882 nm / 1,633 km) Dimensions Length: 33 ft 4 in (10.1 m) Wingspan: 341 ft 0 in (12.5 m) Height: 16 ft 1 in (4.9 m) Weights: Empty: 8,982 lb (4,073 kg) Loaded: 14,000 lb (6,300 kg) Armament: Guns: 6 x 0.50 in (12.7 mm) AN/M2 Browning Machine guns with 400 rounds per gun for 4 and 375 rounds per gun for two Rockets: 4 x 5 in.
