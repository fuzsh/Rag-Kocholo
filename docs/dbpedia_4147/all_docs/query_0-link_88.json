        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nIn previous studies, we demonstrated enhancement of WNV infection in the presence of salivary proteins using a mouse model. The degree and duration of enhancement are similar when (i) WNV-infected mosquitoes feed on or probe mice, (ii) uninfected mosquitoes spot feed on mice prior to WNV inoculation, or (iii) mice are inoculated with WNV mixed with SGE (15). Since the enhancement phenotype occurs under all three experimental conditions, we conclude that viral enhancement is caused by mosquito salivary components and not the virus dose, virus source, location of virus inoculation, or mechanical damage due to mosquito probing. In the current study, we dissected three parameters that influence enhancement of virus replication by mosquito saliva: dose, time of administration, and proximity.\n\nTo our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that mosquito saliva acts in a dose-dependent manner to enhance virus levels in the blood. The enhancement phenotype persisted for 3 days when five mosquitoes spot fed on mice or when larger doses of SGE were inoculated. In addition, mosquito saliva is very potent, since probing or feeding by even a single mosquito enhanced the levels of viremia in mice in our spot-feeding studies. Previous studies by others allowed at least 3 and up to 30 mosquitoes to probe and feed in a single spot to demonstrate enhancement of arboviral infection (8, 12, 13, 16). A mosquito deposits the contents of 0.3 to 0.4 salivary gland pairs (20), corresponding to approximately 0.4 to 0.8 μg SGE, each time that it probes, but we demonstrated enhancement with as little as 0.01 μg SGE. Due to the potency of SGE and the likelihood that the active component represents only a fraction of the mixture, we hypothesize that the effective dose of the salivary component(s) is very low.\n\nWe were surprised to find that SGE enhanced the level of viremia over a broad time frame. A dose of SGE approximately equivalent to the amount of saliva deposited during probing or feeding by a single mosquito (0.5 μg) enhanced the level of viremia if it was administered from 24 h prior to through 12 h after virus inoculation. Previous studies showed that mosquito spot feeding enhances the level of replication of another arbovirus, Cache Valley virus, for 4 h but not 8 h prior to virus inoculation (8). The difference in the duration of enhancement activity could be due to the different mosquito species tested (Aedes triseriatus versus C. tarsalis), intrinsic differences between the viruses, different experimental conditions (the mouse strain used, the endpoint readout used, etc.), or a combination of these factors. We confirmed our results on timing with mosquito spot-feeding studies, in which the level of WNV viremia was enhanced when mosquito saliva was delivered 16 h before and 3 h after virus inoculation. To our knowledge, we are the first to show enhancement of virus replication when mosquito saliva is delivered after virus inoculation, and our results suggest that probing and feeding by uninfected mosquitoes can enhance WNV infection before or after virus transmission in nature. It will be interesting to see if trends for the time frame of enhancement emerge as more groups investigate this parameter.\n\nAlthough the time frame for enhancement was broad, the location required for enhancement was localized. SGE did not enhance WNV replication unless it was administered in the same immediate location, whether SGE administration was separated by 16 h from the time of virus inoculation or SGE was administered at different locations on the same leg. Cache Valley virus also requires colocalization of virus and uninfected A. triseriatus mosquito bites (8). In contrast, DENV replication is enhanced when uninfected A. aegypti mosquitoes bite the host at a site distant from virus inoculation in a humanized mouse model (13). Further studies with other virus-mosquito-host systems are needed to investigate the requirement of colocalization of mosquito saliva and virus.\n\nIn the current studies, we did not use infected mosquitoes, which inoculate a wide range of WNV doses (19), in order to control for viral dose as an experimental parameter. Furthermore, we previously showed viral replication enhancement similar to that found in the present study when we use infected mosquitoes, spot feeding by uninfected mosquitoes, and inoculation of SGE (15). We used the last two methods, spot feeding by uninfected mosquitoes and inoculation of SGE, in our current investigations; however, each method has its limitations. First, mosquitoes deposit variable amounts of saliva and probe/feed for variable lengths of time (19), which introduces variability and prevents us from conducting actual saliva dose-response studies. In addition, it is difficult to conduct closely spaced timing and location studies with live mosquitoes. Thus, we limited studies with live mosquitoes to confirm the findings of our studies with SGE. Inoculation of SGE with virus allows precise control of the protein dose and the timing and location of inoculation. On the other hand, SGE is an extract of all proteins in the salivary gland and not just the secreted salivary proteins. We fully acknowledge this limitation; however, we chose not to use mosquito saliva, which can be collected artificially by placing the mosquito's proboscis into a capillary tube or by allowing mosquitoes to feed on a sucrose solution through a membrane. Such saliva preparations differ qualitatively and quantitatively from mosquito saliva that is inoculated into the host during a natural blood meal. The mixture of salivary proteins in saliva varies between blood and sucrose feeding (21). This is most likely due to different salivary gland gene expression and salivary secretion in the three lobes of the salivary gland. Genes associated with blood feeding are expressed primarily in the medial lobe (22, 23), which has unique innervation (24, 25). Proteins present in the medial lobe are found in saliva collected during blood feeding but are absent from saliva collected during sugar feeding. In addition, the proteins present in artificially collected saliva are substantially diluted (20) and must be precipitated prior to use (26). We published evidence of this dilution in previous studies, which showed that the amount of WNV in artificially collected mosquito saliva is 100-fold lower than the amount of virus inoculated by a mosquito into a live host (19). For these reasons, artificially collected mosquito saliva is infrequently used for in vivo studies, and SGE has been used as a substitute for mosquito saliva in numerous experimental systems (11, 16, 20, 27,–35). We thus used SGE, which contains secreted salivary factors representative of those obtained by both blood and sugar feeding and which can be produced in sufficient quantities with minimal manipulations that could reduce or eliminate functional activity. Finally, we confirmed our results with SGE by conducting mosquito spot-feeding studies with one to five mosquitoes, in which the mosquito saliva composition and deposition mimic those associated with a natural blood meal.\n\nSaliva from female mosquitoes is a complex mixture of molecules required for blood feeding and sugar feeding and includes mucins, proteases, vasodilators, anticoagulants, and immune modulators. The specific composition differs for each genus, with unique proteins being found in Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles spp., and the function of the majority of the proteins is unknown (reviewed in reference 7). For example, transcriptome analysis of female C. tarsalis salivary glands reveals 80 putatively secreted salivary proteins, but the functions for less than half of them are known (36). Thus, it is difficult to speculate on the identity of the WNV replication-enhancing component(s). Recently, Conway et al. (27) demonstrated that a serine protease in saliva from A. aegypti and C. tarsalis mosquitoes enhances WNV levels in vivo. The enhancement activity is abolished by heat treatment and also occurs in cell culture (27). Neither of these is true for our system (unpublished data), suggesting that a different active component enhances viremia in our system. It is possible that more than one salivary factor contributes to the enhancement of WNV replication. We plan to examine the replication enhancement ability of different species of mosquitoes, identify common salivary components, and test candidate factors for their ability to enhance WNV replication in vivo. This methodical approach will provide insight into currently uncharacterized factors and inform the mechanism of enhancement of WNV replication.\n\nThe mechanism of enhancement is unclear. Viral enhancement occurs even when virus and saliva or SGE are administered separately, suggesting an indirect effect on the virus. The saliva perhaps stimulates a persistent local host response conducive to enhanced viral replication and spread, as saliva is known to alter immune responses (37). Mosquito saliva induces TH2 polarization in mouse skin, leading to higher levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4) (38) or IL-10 (30), and in cultured splenocytes, leading to higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 and decreased gamma interferon (IFN-γ) levels as long as 10 days after exposure (39). Saliva may also recruit host cells to the feeding site. Anopheles saliva increases the number of neutrophils at the feeding site and the number of dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes (40); both of these cell types support WNV replication (41, 42). Thus, the observed increase in virus levels in our system may be due to an increased number of infected cells rather than an increase in the level of viral replication per cell. Alternatively, mosquito saliva may prevent the early detection and clearance of virus. A. aegypti saliva has been shown to reduce the amount of IFN-β and inducible nitric oxide synthase in macrophages as well as to decrease the influx of T cells (30). The dampening of the normal immune response may provide the virus time to gain an early foothold for replication and spread.\n\nThe immune response to mosquito saliva and salivary proteins clearly plays a complex role in infection. Sensitization of mice to A. aegypti saliva enhances WNV pathogenicity (43). In contrast, sensitization of mice to C. tarsalis saliva has no effect on virus levels or morbidity in our previous studies (15). Immunization of mice with C. tarsalis SGE reduces the rates of morbidity and mortality after WNV infection (28), but vaccination against D7, a prominent mosquito salivary protein, increases the rate of mortality during WNV infection (44). Further work is needed to map the interplay between the host immune response, mosquito saliva, and virus replication.\n\nAnother possible mechanism for enhancement is the lingering of the active salivary component(s) at the site of infection. Salivary proteins can linger at a mosquito feeding site for up to 18 hpi (45, 46), and we have found that SGE incubated overnight at 37°C retains its viral replication enhancement activity (data not shown). Perhaps any remaining components prime host cells for infection. SGE could stabilize infected cells, preventing virus-induced cell death and allowing viral replication to continue longer than it otherwise would. Alternatively, the residual salivary components could act as a bridge for infection, transforming previously nonpermissive cells into permissive cells."
