For people who have visited the Freedom Museum, they will remember Richard Bean from Brentsville who joined the Army and fought and died on the Japanese held island of Saipan in 1944. His remains were not found until 2013 when the Japanese nongovernmental agency, Kuentai went to Saipan to try to recover Japanese soldiers remains and return them to Japan. Jarae, a former Saipan resident and now Manassas, VA resident, contacted us to tell us he was the one to discover Bean when he was 12 years old on a family friend’s archeological dig. He was only 14 years old when he helped discover Richard Bean. In 2018, Jarae moved with his family from his tiny island to the town of Manassas.\n\nRead More\n\nLauren Dower Lauren Dower\n\nDouble V Campaign: Honoring Black Veterans\n\nDuring WW II, The Double V campaign was a slogan championed by the Pittsburg Currier, which was dedicated towards promoting democracy for civilian defense workers and for Blacks in the military.
