A host of nieces and nephews.\n\nSteve served in the Army National Guard. He was a custom home builder on Smith Lake for over 50 years. People called him “The Legend.” He loved his wife, Barbara, and his family. He was a true craftsman and it was evident in the homes he built. He sawmilled his own wood of different varieties. This allowed him to make one-of-a-kind pieces, including tables, mantles, beams, columns, etc. He even made balusters out of crepe myrtle limbs for some customers. Whatever the customers wanted, he could build it!\n\nA visitation for Steve will be held Friday, July 26, 2024 from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Good Hope Baptist Church, 90 Good Hope School Road, Cullman, AL 35057, followed by a Celebration of Life Funeral Service at 1 p.m.\n\nSteve will be laid to rest in Good Hope Cemetery, 90 Good Hope School Road, Good Hope, AL 35057.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made online or mailed to UAB Center for Palliative and Comfort Care."
