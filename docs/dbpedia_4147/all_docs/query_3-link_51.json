        "text": "Ronnie Cupp, 77 of Las Vegas, Nevada passed away with family beside him on February 1, 2021. Ronnie was born on April 25, 1943 to James Cupp and Nadine Faulkner Cupp.\n\nRonnie had two great loves in his life, the first being Mary who he had three children with. The second Sharon who he was married to for 40 years, and who he missed dearly after her passing in June of 2020.\n\nRonnie worked for many years at the General Motors Van Nuys Assembly Plant as an assemblyman until they closed in the early 1990’s when he retired; at that time he and his wife Sharon moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. As a car guy Ronnie enjoyed his time in the Corvette Club where he was proud of his 1982 Corvette Stingray. In his later years, he enjoyed placing sports bets at Arizona Charlie’s and Boulder Station, and when his kids came to visit he loved to watch the Majestic Falls at Sam’s Town. Ronnie had pretty blue eyes, and was often told he looked like James Dean or Brad Pitt.\n\nRonnie was predeceased in death by his parents, James and Nadine Cupp, his brothers Eddie Cupp and Larry Cupp, his wife Sharon and stepson Harry Landis (Mike). Ronnie is survived by his daughters Donna Dutra, Denise Wertz, son David Cupp, son-in-law Michael Wertz, daughter-in-law Georgina Cupp, sisters Joan McKenzie, Jan Cupp, Doris Mullen, brother Jimmie Cupp, grandchildren Nicole Wertz, Makenna Wertz, Jordyn Wertz, Dean Cupp, Morgan Cupp, Matthew Dutra, as well as many nieces and nephews. He also leaves behind thoughtful neighbors who always checked in on him, and his pets Penny and Checkers who now live with his daughters.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 12:00 p.m. on February 22, 2021 at Davis Funeral Homes and Memorial Park 6200 S. Eastern Avenue, Las Vegas, NV 89119, burial will follow at 3:00 p.m. at the same location."
