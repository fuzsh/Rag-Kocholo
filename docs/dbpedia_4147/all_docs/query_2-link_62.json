        "text": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WVIR) - City Council is reviewing an updated ordinance Monday night that would make it easier for people who live in Charlottesville to deal with housing discrimination.\n\nIf someone in Charlottesville is experiencing housing discrimination, they can submit their complaint through one of three levels: federal, state, or local.\n\nThe Charlottesville Human Rights Commission wants to make sure that locals can file in town, and in person, if necessary.\n\nThat begins with Monday night’s Council meeting.\n\n“It’s that idea of, if we have a local process for people, it might make it easier,” said Todd Niemier, Director of the Commission.\n\nNiemier says the main goal of the updated ordinance is to enter into a work share agreement with the Fair Housing Assistance Program through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n\n“Once we enter that work share, that means we can receive cases that are jurisdictional to our office that happened within Charlottesville, but may have been reported to either the State Fair Housing Office or the Federal Fair Housing Office,” Niemier said. “Those would get referred back to us so we can handle them locally.”\n\nThe Commission already conducts thorough investigations into reports of housing discrimination. It wants to ensure that fair housing is available for all people in Charlottesville.\n\nSometimes, though, local discrimination ends up in state or federal hands.\n\n“We [requested public information from] HUD to find out how many came in over the last few years, in terms of cases that would have been jurisdictional but ended up in either the state office or the federal office,” Niemier said. “It looked like maybe three to four additional cases. That’s no small thing, because a case can be really, really involved from time to time, and it can take hours and hours of work to process.”\n\nThe way the system works right now, people in Charlottesville might have to travel to Richmond or Washington, D.C. just to find in-person assistance.\n\nNiemier wants to change that.\n\n“Although those offices handle things quite well, it’s just that maybe a more personalized local response would be helpful,” said Niemier. “Especially if the event was traumatic, or say that somebody has hard time using an online system to file the complaint. We can facilitate those things here much easier in person.”\n\nDo you have a story idea? Send us your news tip here."
