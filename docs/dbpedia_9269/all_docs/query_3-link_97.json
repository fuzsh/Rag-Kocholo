He enjoyed challenging himself with crossword puzzles and cherished the tradition of watching his family open Christmas gifts and hosting cookouts.\n\nRichard leaves behind a legacy that will forever be cherished by those who survive him.

On February 23rd, 1980, in Knox, Indiana, he married Connie Ann (Bailey) Kolasa, who survives in Michigan City.

He then decided to do something different in 1985. Chris became well known for Trashman at Your Service, Mr. Clean Gutters, and Kolasa & Son Excavating. He was always working, that was all he thought of. Having to stay busy all the time and could never sit down. Chris would do anything and everything for his kids and grandkids. He enjoyed going camping and spending time with the grandkids, watching them grow up. His real dream was operating his food cart, but the bone cancer would not let him. Chris would help anyone, anytime if he could. He had a big heart and was motivated to help others.\n\nHe was truly a jack of all trades and could fix and think of all kinds of MacGyver tricks all day long. If you knew Chris, you would know what we are talking about. Just a great guy all the way around. His only downfall was he always worked in pain but tried not to let the pain and cancer take over. Chris was a strong-willed man but lost the battle, passing away from painful bone cancer. Chris will be missed dearly.\n\nTo sign a guest book and leave condolences online visit www.otthaverstock.com.\n\nMaxine Britzke, a beacon of love and kindness, passed away peacefully on May 28th, 2024, at her home in La Porte, Indiana.

She never wavered in her commitment to any of her children or grandchildren. She could be counted on for anything if it involved her family. She was a tireless listener, encourager, and loving and supportive mother and grandmother. Her wisdom was empowering and her love for her family knew no bounds. Her children were proud to call her their mom. Every one of her 15 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren delighted in being with and loved their “Sito.” She has left us with a huge void in our lives and she will be greatly missed.\n\nMom always had a smile on her face and those lucky enough to know her could see the genuineness of that smile.

He found solace and joy in fishing, often spending peaceful hours by the water with a rod in hand. Video games provided another avenue for Brad to unwind and engage with friends, while his adventurous palate meant he was always eager to try new foods. Family cookouts were a favorite occasion for Brad, where he could combine his love for good food, great company, and hearty laughter.\n\nBrad is lovingly remembered by his wife, Shelby, and their son, Jaxson. His legacy continues through his mother, Brandi Sharp, and stepfather, Chip Sharp; his father, Ryan Bennington, and stepmother, Julie Bennington; and mother-in-law, Lisa Wilke. His brothers-in-law, Kody Wilke (Brooke) and Christopher Wilke; his sisters, Ellie Lemmon and Arielle Felty (Jake); and grandparents, Jeanne Moser, Dave Moser, and William Bennington, will hold dear the memories of Brad's kindness and humor. A host of aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, friends, and cousins also survive him, each carrying a piece of Brad's friendly spirit with them.\n\nBrad was preceded in death by his grandmother, Brenda Bennington; great-grandmother, Evelyn Denison; father-in-law, Kevin Wilke; brother-in-law, Jason Jackman; and Aunt Rosie Huddleston. Each of these individuals held a special place in Brad's heart, and their influence on his life was profound.\n\nBrad's departure from this world leaves a void that cannot be filled, but his memory will live on in the hearts of those who knew him. His laughter, his kindness, and his unwavering dedication to his family will be remembered and cherished forever. Brad's life, though too short, was a life well-lived, full of love, laughter, and the joy of simple pleasures.\n\nVisitation will be held from 5 PM to 7 PM on Friday, May 24th, 2024, at Frank L.

On August 1st, 1992, in South Bend, he married the love of his life, Tammy Kelly. In his career, Gregg was a Yardmaster for the Norfolk Southern Railroad for 23 years. In his spare time, though, Gregg was quite a Sportsman. He loved hunting and fishing, enjoyed NASCAR, with Bill Elliot as his favorite driver, and liked the Chicago Blackhawks hockey team. Football was his favorite, though, and he was an avid University of Michigan fan (Go Blue). Gregg was a car guy who liked working on cars, was a great outdoor cook, and enjoyed boating and going to the beach. He was a music lover and he and his brother would listen to the Beatles for hours. Spending time with his family was his greatest passion and though they will miss him, they are comforted by the fact that he was a saved Christian who knew where he was going.\n\nGregg is survived by his wife of 33 years, Tammy; two sons, Cody (Lindsey) Cassler of Waverly, NE, Camryn (Megan) Fletcher of La Porte, IN; daughter, Courtney (Brad) Cass of Mishawaka, IN; sister, Jessica (Bob) Rogers of Niles, MI; two grandchildren, Ben Cassler, Ellie Cassler and several nieces and nephews.\n\nGregg was preceded in death by his parents and brothers, Todd and Scott Fletcher.\n\nArrangements are being entrusted to Haverstock Funeral Home and Cremation Services, 602 Maple Ave., La Porte, IN where the family will receive friends on Saturday, May 25th, 2024, from 11:30 a.m. until service time at 1:00 p.m., all central time.

Baez, a cherished husband, father, grandfather, brother, and coach, passed away peacefully on May 20th, 2024, in La Porte, Indiana, at the age of 75.\n\nBorn on January 19th, 1949, in Santurce, Puerto Rico, and from San Sebastian, Manuel was the beloved son of the late Melton Baez and Carlita (Infante). He was the guiding light of his family, known for his kind heart, infectious humor, and courageous spirit. Manuel was raised in East Chicago, where he would later become a pillar of the community.\n\nOn January 27th, 1968, he married the love of his life, Norma I. (Santiago) Baez, and together they built a family that was his pride and joy. Their love and partnership were a testament to commitment and joy, and their home was always filled with laughter and warmth. Manuel was a devoted father to Gina (Bobby) Ruiz of La Porte, Indiana, Christian Baez of Wright City, Missouri, and Manuel A. Baez Jr of Fenton, Missouri. He was a doting grandfather to Alexis Baez, Christian (Alyssa) Baez Jr, R.J. Ruiz, Jorden Ruiz, and Jayden Ruiz, cherishing every moment he spent with them.\n\nHis siblings, Gladys Baez of East Chicago, Louie Baez of Schererville, Indiana, and Olga Colon of Bronx, New York, will remember Manuel as a supportive and loving brother.\n\nManuel's work ethic and dedication were evident throughout his career. He retired in 2007 from United Steelworkers Local 1010 in Hammond, Indiana, where he had been a respected Ore Bridge Operator. His colleagues knew him as a man who could be relied upon, both for his skill and his ability to bring a sense of camaraderie to the workplace.\n\nBeyond his professional life, Manuel's true passion lay in his involvement with the youth of East Chicago. As a basketball coach, he was more than a mentor; he was a father figure and a second dad to many junior high and high school boys. Manuel's influence extended beyond the court as he helped guide young men toward a brighter future, teaching them the importance of integrity, hard work, and respect. His humor and smile were his tools, not just for coaching, but for teaching life lessons that his players would carry with them long after they left his team.\n\nManuel's legacy is one of love, laughter, and the courage to make a difference. He was a man who lit up a room with his presence and used his life to improve the lives of others. His absence will be deeply felt by all who had the privilege of knowing him, but his memory will continue to inspire those he touched.\n\nVisitation will be held from 5-8 PM Thursday, May 23rd, 2004, at Frank L.

Jesus called her home on May 16th to finally be pain-free and whole once again. It was a long and gallant battle for many years after being injured serving as an Emergency Medical Technician. She was doing what she did best- serving others and putting them first.\n\nJenny was born on August 26th, 1984. She is survived by her four amazing daughters, Lily (17), Bailee (15), and her twins, Cali and Cami (12). Her Mama and Dad, Paula and Garry Nichols. Brother- Joshua Dunkleberger (Carly Togher), Nieces - Aubrey, Addy and Nephew-Reid. Step Brother- Phillip (Lindsey) Nichols-Nieces Mary Jayne (Levi), Lilliana, Nephews-Colin and Dom. Step Brother- Garry Nichols, Biological father- Douglas Dunkleberger\n\nJenny was also blessed to have a very large extended family who provided endless love and support. She enjoyed being with her Aunts, Uncles, Cousins, Nieces, and Nephew so much and always looked forward to our big family gatherings. She recently expressed how much she loved getting together with all of them.\n\nFamily and Friends who stood by her side know who you are, she appreciated you so very much. Thank you for wrapping your love and kindness around her.\n\nJenny’s four daughters have been the light of her world since they were born. They are the reason that she fought so hard to stay on this earth. She adored her children and wanted so badly to see them grow up and fulfill all of the dreams that they so often shared with her. She always told them that they could do anything and she would try to show them how to overcome the adversities that this world sometimes throws at us. They are sweet, kind, wonderful, respectful individuals because of her. She loved them more than anything. She taught them life values, independence, and to always care about others. She always wanted them to know that riches on earth are not what matters. She would tell them to always treat everyone the same, be non-judgmental, and remember to always to treat others the way you want to be treated. She told them every day,” I love you to the moon and back my babies!” She did and will love them now from heaven above.\n\nJenny had a special relationship with her brother, Josh, he was her hero. They would defend each other to the end, make each other laugh, and everyone else in the room. Their shenanigans would keep Dad and Mama on their toes, but touch their hearts as they knew that the two of them had a relationship rare for siblings. She loved her brother so very much. She spoke with pride at the relationship they had.\n\nJenny and her Mama were together on a daily basis. There were phone calls throughout the day to discuss whatever was going on and what was happening. She was her Mama’s girl and the memories of her life will have to fill the deep sorrow that is left. Jenny brought so much love and joy to her Mama. She will be missed beyond any expression of words.\n\nJenny was an avid reader- reading over 3000 books in the last 4 years. She created beautiful cross-stitch projects. She taught her four girls the love of crafting, and creating something amazing with your hands. Her projects had meaning and a story behind each one. She completed many projects for people who just happened to pass her way. She was selfless and each of the time-consuming pieces were always for someone else. She used her talents to share her love and concern for others. Jenny was also an avid gourmet cook. Her creations amazed us. There was never a recipe or a dish too hard for her to create. They always looked and tasted like a professional had created them. She truly enjoyed creativity. She had a beautiful voice and sang frequently. The talents she had were used to bring happiness to someone else and to share joy in a unique way.\n\nShe was never too ill to attempt to do something for a neighbor, friend, or family member. She was loyal beyond measure. She will be remembered for her loyalty, integrity, and deep love for the ones closest to her.\n\nThere are no words that can adequately express the pain in our hearts as we say our goodbyes to our Jenny. There is a permanent piece of the puzzle missing until we all meet again in heaven. She will forever and always be in our hearts.\n\nJesus gained an angel on May 16th, 2024. We lost our Mom, Daughter, Sister, Niece, Cousin, Friend. We have comfort knowing that she will no longer have the earthly struggles, but our hearts are heavy as we say so long for now. We love you so and miss you so very much!\n\nWe know that Jenny would want us to thank the following people:\n\nPastor Jeff Zigler- you provided peace and love when she needed it most\n\nChurch Family - Power of Prayer\n\nFamily Members and Friends- Constant Prayer and Support\n\nMultiple Health Professionals over the years too many to list.\n\nDr. Kamran, hospice, Dr. Kahn, Westville Schools-Love and Support.\n\nArrangements are being entrusted to Haverstock Funeral Home and Cremation Services, 602 Maple Ave., La Porte, IN.

Preceding him in death is the love of his life, his high school sweetheart and wife of 55 years, Judith K. (Lowery); his beloved sister, LouAnn Steele; and his cherished parents, Mr. Oliver and Mrs. Elizabeth Anderson.\n\nWell known for his determination and entrepreneurship, many have met him throughout his various successful endeavors; from delivering fuel oil as Anderson Oil, La Porte, to hauling grains to the elevators, reaped from the family farm before he got into short-term hauling under Anderson Trucking. So that Mom and Dad could enjoy time together in their working-retirement years, they became owners and sole operators of Liberty Package Store, North Liberty.\n\nThroughout his adulthood, Dad was involved in several community clubs, Lions Club of Fish Lake, Stillwell Leadership, and Moose Lodge, where he was a member and leader. While these clubs were where Dad contributed, the Hoosier Old Wheels Club was where Dad and Mom relaxed; from classic car shows to rallies and scavenger hunts to simply sitting around a campfire talking cars, this was their fun club.\n\nThose who knew Dad can surely recall at least one story. Perhaps he told you about his favorite childhood memories of being out on his aunt and uncle's farm and riding his companion, Scout, out and about and winning barrel races. Surely you've heard at least one car story--whether it's how he found one or how he raced one, or that his favorite thing to do was drive his classic cars. He had a knack for working in a car story into any conversation and how he got his prized possession, the '67 Corvette Coupe.\n\nKnowing Doug, you've heard him laugh about the great times he had over the years with his adored wife, Judy. He would absolutely light up when given the chance to talk about Judy's drag racing. You could feel his love for her when he teased her about \"vroom-vrooming\" through the gears when she thought she was alone.\n\nSurviving Doug are his children, Scott and Tanya, and grandson, Cody.\n\nThe tenacity and stubbornness which drove his entrepreneurship also applied to family. Agree or disagree, like it or not, at least you'd know his position, and more likely than not, you learned a lesson along the way. It wasn't always easy being raised under the expectation of perfection, but I am grateful for the most valuable lesson a parent can teach: how to be a decent human being and still fight for what you believe in. So, no matter how you knew Douglas Anderson, may your memory of him be exactly as he was in life--no B.S.\n\nAn opening viewing will be held from 3 - 8 p.m. on Thursday, May 9th, 2024, at Cutler Funeral Home and Cremation Center.\n\nA Celebration of Life Gathering will be held from 5 - 7 p.m. on Friday, May 10th, 2024, at Moose Lodge #492, La Porte.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations will be collected at the Moose Lodge door for the Western Vet Clinic and Moose Lodge #492.\n\nCondolences may be shared with the family on www.cutlercares.com.\n\nBrenda Sue Hull, 56, of La Porte, Indiana, passed away on May 1st, 2024, at her home, surrounded by her loving family.\n\nBrenda was born on June 8th, 1967, in La Porte, IN, to Martin and Connie (Dittmer) Barnes.\n\nAt St. John's, over 30 years ago, she married Victor Hull, who survives.

Brenda also loved her dogs and rescuing dogs.\n\nShe had the heart of a caregiver, as evidenced by both her work in the schools and with Comfort Keepers. Brenda cherished her time taking care of her La Porte School students with disabilities. She cared for them so deeply, that she found herself missing them during summer break. During her time at Comfort Keepers, she found herself very attached to her clients.\n\nA Celebration of Life Service will be held at 12 p.m. on Monday, May 6th, 2024, at Cutler Funeral Home and Cremation Center. Burial will follow at Pine Lake Cemetery.\n\nA time of visitation will be held from 3 - 7 p.m. on Sunday, May 5th, 2024, and from 11 a.m. until the time of the service on Monday at the funeral home.\n\nMemorial donations may be made to the family c/o Lindsey Berry, 2900 Monroe Street, La Porte, IN 46350, or to the donor's choice.\n\nLeslie Ellen Hahney-Swayze, 42 of La Porte, Indiana passed away Monday, April 29, 2024.
