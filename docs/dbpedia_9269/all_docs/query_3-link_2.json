        "text": "Holy Week: Easter Sunday – Resurrection of Jesus\n\n“Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.’”\n\nGet started\n\nHoly Week: Saturday – Jesus in the Tomb\n\n“Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day.”\n\nGet started\n\nHoly Week: Friday – Jesus’ Trial and Death\n\n“It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. Jesus called out with a loud voice, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” When he had said this, he breathed his last.”\n\nGet started\n\nHoly Week: Thursday – Garden of Gethsemane\n\nThen one of the twelve disciples—the one named Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests and asked, “What will you give me if I betray Jesus to you?” They counted out thirty silver coins and gave them to him. From then on Judas was looking for a good chance to hand Jesus over to them.”\n\nGet started\n\nHoly Week: Wednesday – The Last Supper\n\nAnd as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.”\n\nGet started\n\nHoly Week: Tuesday – Jesus’ authority is questioned\n\n“Blind guides! … For you are like whitewashed tombs—beautiful on the outside but filled on the inside with dead people’s bones and all sorts of impurity. Outwardly you look like righteous people, but inwardly your hearts are filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness…Snakes! Sons of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?”\n\nGet started\n\nHoly Week: Monday\n\nWhen Jesus entered the temple courts, he began to drive out those who were selling. “It is written,” he said to them, “‘My house will be a house of prayer’; but you have made it ‘a den of robbers.’\n\nGet started\n\nHoly Week: Palm Sunday – Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem\n\nSo they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!\n\nGet started"
