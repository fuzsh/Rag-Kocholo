Growing in notoriety as both a singer and a songwriter, winning 3 Dove awards and multiple ASCAP Awards along the way, Owens has sold over a million records over the course of her career.

How can we learn to be content in any situation we face? After facing several harrowing life struggles, including walking with her mom through cancer, Ginny found answers in a letter Paul wrote from a prison cell. Come discover Paul’s secret of contentment through Ginny’s teaching and music. Based on Phil. 4:12.\n\n\n\nWhat Our Songs Say\n\nJoin Ginny for an exploration of current popular songs, what they tell us about the state of our culture, and how they can drive us toward the Gospel.\n\n\n\nLove Be The Loudest – Hearing God's Voice Above The Noise\n\nOur lives are full of noise – from our everyday busyness, to social media, to the voices whispering criticisms in our own heads. As the noise of career demands, singleness, and self-doubt grew to a fever pitch for Ginny, she began a desperate search for change. Psalm 25:14 says God wants to speak to us, but how do we tune our hearts to His voice? Together, we’ll journey through Ginny’s devotional and select songs as we learn how to hear Him, and how His voice can change us.\n\n\n\nSinging In The Dark – Learning To Love Your Life In Every Circumstance\n\nIs it possible to endure a difficult job, family situation, disability, or terminal illness with hope? James says it is when he invites us to consider our trials pure joy. Ginny, who has been blind since age three, will share Scriptures and her own personal story and songs, as we consider what it means to find true joy and infinite hope in our darkest days.\n\n\n\nHow I See It\n\nBlind since age three, Ginny has learned how to “see” the world differently than most. But all of us are a little blind this side of Heaven (1 Cor 13), and as a result, our stories don’t always make sense. Let’s explore how we can learn to see ourselves and each other as God sees us.\n\n\n\nThe Secret Of Contentment\n\nMany of us have called ourselves Christians for a long time, but we’re overwhelmed with worry, anxiety, and doubt.
