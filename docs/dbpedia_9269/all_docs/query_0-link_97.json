        "text": "Lawrence Weiner (born February 10, 1942, Bronx, New York, U.S.—died December 2, 2021, New York, New York) was an American conceptual artist best known for his text-based installations and radical definitions of art. He is considered a central figure in the foundation of the conceptual art movement of the 1960s.\n\nWeiner grew up in the South Bronx and attended New York public schools. He dropped out of college during his first year and traveled throughout North America, taking on a series of jobs—primarily manual labour—and beginning to make paintings. His first noted work, Cratering Pieces (1960), however, was a sculptural and earth-based experiment. Working without permission, Weiner detonated a series of explosives in a California state park, the results of which he declared to be sculptures. That type of antiestablishment creativity set the stage for his career in radicalism. About that time Weiner also began working on the Propeller paintings (1960–65), which were inspired by the test patterns that appeared on the television screen at night when there was no programming. He used whatever kind of paint he could find—commercial enamel, aluminum, gouache.\n\nWeiner began exhibiting at the Seth Siegelaub Contemporary Art gallery in New York City in 1964. In 1968, for an out-of-state exhibition organized by Siegelaub that also included works by Carl Andre and Robert Barry, Weiner installed what he saw as an unobtrusive work titled Hay, Mesh, String in a courtyard between two buildings at Windham College in Vermont. The work consisted of stakes connected by a grid of twine demarcating a rectangle. The students cut down the twine instead of walking around the piece when they found it to be in the way, at which point Weiner realized he could have been even less obtrusive by simply describing the work in language rather than constructing it. He renamed it A Series of Stakes Set in the Ground at Regular Intervals to Form a Rectangle—Twine Strung from Stake to Stake to Demark a Grid—a Rectangle Removed from This Rectangle (1968).\n\nThat experience prompted a tremendous shift in Weiner’s work and triggered his fundamental premise that it did not matter whether a work of art was produced or not. That same year Siegelaub published the artist’s landmark book, Statements, a collection of 24 typewritten processes to follow in making a work of art. The book, which sold for $1.95 at Siegelaub’s gallery, had no illustrations, and some of the works described had not been produced. Weiner wrote the descriptions by using the past participle, making the words definitive but not directive (or imperative), such as “A sheet of brown paper of arbitrary width and length of twice that width with a removal of the same proportions glued to the floor.”\n\nA primary motivating factor behind Weiner’s work was the desire to make it accessible, without needing to buy a ticket or understand a secret visual language. He contended that language reaches a broader audience, and situating language in contexts outside traditional art-viewing settings, such as art museums, furthers that reach. Thus, he began creating works consisting of words and sentences or sentence fragments that he displayed in public spaces, books, films, and other accessible media, sidelining the cultural institutions that might deter broad and diverse viewership. His 1969 Statement of Intent reads as follows:\n\n1. The artist may construct the piece.\n\n2. The piece may be fabricated.\n\n3. The piece need not be built. Each being equal and consistent with the intent of the artist, the decision as to condition rests with the receiver upon the occasion of receivership.\n\nIn his statement, Weiner asserted that a work of art could remain conceptual—in language form—or it could be created if so desired. The maker need not be an artist, and there was no “right way” to do it. Those three points guided Weiner’s work and egalitarian philosophy toward art making and art viewing throughout his career.\n\nWeiner’s phrases, most of which he set in Franklin Gothic Extra Condensed font, tended to consist of processes, constructions, materials, and the results of carrying out a process. For example, Many Colored Objects Placed Side by Side to Form a Row of Many Colored Objects (1982) states the process and its result. Some Limestone Some Sandstone Enclosed for Some Reason (1993), on the other hand, focuses on the physical materials of the work’s context, the site of a disused weighbridge outside a former carpet factory. Some of Weiner’s phrases are unique to one site, whereas others may be repeated or installed in multiple places—in a public space, on a gallery wall, in a book—each context carrying with it a different meaning and experience for the reader. In 2000 the Public Art Fund in New York City commissioned Weiner to create manhole covers in collaboration with Con Edison and to integrate them into the landscape of Lower Manhattan. He had 19 covers manufactured with the phrase “In Direct Line with Another & the Next” cast on them, a reference to the city’s grid."
