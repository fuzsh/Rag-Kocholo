        "text": "Career\n\nOwens was born in Jackson, Mississippi, with poor eyesight and has been blind since the age of two. She earned her bachelor of music education in 1997 from Belmont University, but found that most people were skeptical about hiring a blind music teacher. She entered the music business by writing songs for Michael Puryear's Final Four Publishing, which led to a number of labels competing for her, before she chose Rocketown Records. She concentrated in singing and songwriting and began making CDs, and has been producing them since 1999 with Rocketown Records, a label under Michael W. Smith. Owens won the Nashville \"Lilith Fair '99 Talent Search\", which earned her a spot singing at that year's festival, and the following year performed at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nHer music has been featured on television shows, such as Roswell and Felicity. Owens has also received three Dove awards, including New Artist of the Year (2000) and Inspirational Recorded Song of the Year (2001) for \"Blessed\" with Rachael Lampa and Cindy Morgan.\n\nIn 2005, Owens started a non-profit organization called the Fingerprint Initiative. The organization has worked in conjunction with other groups, such as Compassion International, International Justice Mission, and Habitat for Humanity. Owens was featured on national television, including NBC's Today Show and CNN, for her contribution to help rebuild New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. Owens most recent album released in 2016 is titled \"Love Be The Loudest\".\n\nDiscography\n\nWithout Condition · 20 July 1999\n\nSomething More · 2002\n\nBlueprint (EP) · 2002 · (8 tracks; 7 remixes, plus a 1 track preview of Beautiful)\n\nBeautiful · 2004\n\nLive From New Orleans · 3 May 2005\n\nLong Way Home · 11 October 2005\n\nIf You Want Me To: The Best of Ginny Owens · 8 August 2006\n\nBring Us Peace · 2006 · (Christmas Album)\n\nSay Amen (EP) · 2009 · (3 track preview of Say Amen: Hymns and Songs of Faith)\n\nSay Amen: Hymns and Songs of Faith · 20 October 2009\n\nEphemera (EP) · 2 February 2010 · (6 track preview of Get In, I'm Driving)\n\nGet In, I'm Driving · 13 September 2011\n\nI Know a Secret (10 November 2014)\n\n\"Love Be the Loudest\" 18 November 2016"
