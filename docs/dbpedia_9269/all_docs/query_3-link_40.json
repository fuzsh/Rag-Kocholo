After charting a pair of self-penned singles in 1993 as a Warner Bros. recording artist, Shawn turned his attention to writing songs for other artists — earning his first #1 hits in 1998 with “Two Piña Coladas” by Garth Brooks and “How Long Gone” by Brooks & Dunn.

In the Americana field, Shawn’s “My Love Will Not Change” by Aubrie Sellers w/ Steve Earle was an AMA song nominee in 2020.\n\nDESMOND CHILD\n\nDesmond Child was born in Gainesville, FL, but grew up in Miami. By the mid-1970s his obsession with music led him to New York City, where early co-writes with Paul Stanley of KISS yielded 1979’s “I Was Made For Loving You.” By 1986, Desmond’s co-writes with Bon Jovi provided the band with two of their biggest hits — “You Give Love A Bad Name” and “Livin’ On A Prayer.” Desmond continued his ’80s Rock/Pop success with songs such as “Dude Looks Like A Lady” by Aerosmith and “I Hate Myself For Loving You” by Joan Jett (tweaked in 2013 to become the NBC Sunday Night Football theme). Moving to Nashville in the early ’90s, Desmond celebrated more hits, including “Crazy” by Aerosmith, “Where Your Road Leads” by Trisha Yearwood & Garth Brooks, “Nobody Wants To Be Lonely” by Ricky Martin & Christina Aguilera, and “Waking Up In Vegas” by Katy Perry. “Livin’ La Vida Loca” by Ricky Martin was named 2000 ASCAP Pop Song of the Year and Billboard’s 1999 Latin Pop Track of the Year.

Among Gordon’s dozen-plus Garth Brooks cuts are “You Move Me,” “Love Will Always Win” (duet with Trisha Yearwood), “Lost In You” and “It Don’t Matter To The Sun” (the latter two by Brooks’ alter ego Chris Gaines).
