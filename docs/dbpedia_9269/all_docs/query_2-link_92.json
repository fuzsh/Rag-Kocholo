This is where you lead me and carry me again. Thank you for the fire. Thank you for the fire. In the fire. Fear and faith collide. And all my questions why. Are answered by your love. In the fire. All my deepest pain. Is healed with endless grace. However long it takes. Only you can bring me to this place. Where my heart can finally learn to say. Thank you for the fire. (The Fire – Ginny Owens)\n\nRorie kicked this month off with her state testing for school. This is the first time she has ever done testing like this and did such a great job! She is a great little student and has learned so much this year!\n\nThe younger kids and mommy have committed to walking every day before lunch and this has become such a sweet and refreshing time for us all. There is always lots of running, jumping, flower smelling and picking of flowers for mommy!\n\nWe were able to attend “trades night” again in Spokane Valley. It was such a fun time together. Grandpa Lee and Uncle David were even able to join us! The kids LOVE driving all the big machinery and learning about the different trades!\n\nBowen was chosen on Instagram to be a brand ambassador for the company @ecozoi. They make these amazing stainless steel lunchboxes and he was VERY thrilled when he saw his filled with celery and applesauce! Everywhere we go we take this little lunchbox with us filled with his crunchy snacks.\n\nOur FIRST homeschool field trip this month was at the Jr Livestock show. The kids all loved to see the animals and we learned a lot about showing pigs. We took a sack lunch and had a picnic with our friends. Morgan also went with his school class. (Unfortunately I could not go with him) but he had a wonderful time with his friends on his very first ever field trip with school.\n\nAvery turned 12 this month! Goodness this boy is such a blessing to us all. He is hard working and has done so well in school this year. He LOVES music and is currently being followed around by his baby brother almost constantly. You can always hear “A-V want to play pirates? Want to play with me?” And being the sweet big brother that he is he often obliges Bowen. We are so thankful for our Avery James. As his birthday date with grandma and grandpa he went to “Dozer Days”! He loved driving the big rigs and being with his little cousin.\n\nBetter late than never Rorie had a wonderful celebration with friends for her 9th birthday! She had a fairy town party and each of the girls went home with their very own fairy garden! It is so fun to see each one’s creativity and hear their chatter and laughter in our home.\n\nAvery has been hard at work this month practicing his trombone and even marching in the street in front of our house in preparation for the Jr Lilac parade. We all loaded up and went downtown to watch the Freeman Middle School Band (for the first time ever!) march in the Jr Lilac Parade. He did such a great job! It was amazing to watch him go by all decked out in his kilt and marching alongside his classmates.\n\nFor Mother’s Day we were blessed with a chance to see Grammy AND Great Grandma Leila. The day was blessing and the weather was so pleasant.\n\nThe big boy’s lawn care service has kicked into full gear now that the weather has turned. They work so hard to mow ours and the neighbor’s lawns and do an excellent job.\n\nMorgan ran for Sergeant at Arms for ASB at school. Even tho he win we are so proud of him for running and working hard to try new things.\n\nBowen had an allergy apt this month. We brought up to the allergist that he is breaking out in hives almost every time he is outside. (We always take photos of all these ailments for the doctors. It is SO helpful for them and for us to have photos. What a blessing to have technology to help us in these times!) Due to the increase in hives and also swelling of his eyes (specifically after he plays in the dirt) the allergist has increased his antihistamine to hopefully combat those symptoms. We have also been issued an EPI pen for Bowen so that we have the resources we need if, Heaven forbid, we ever need them. This actually gave Paul and I a lot of peace of mind because we like to go on family drives into the mountains. With that comes distance from emergency services so having EPI with us is encouraging. EPI is not something we have dealt with before but again we are thankful for the resources available to us and we pray that if we have to use it God will guide us in that process and at that time. We don’t want to do the alternative which is never let him play in the dirt so we are praying that this increase in meds will help his body and allow him to just be a boy and get muddy and dirty.\n\nRorie has become quite the little cook in the kitchen lately. She is so capable and it is a joy to watch. Her favorite thing to make is skillet potatoes for herself and her sister’s for breakfast.\n\nWe managed to squeeze in TWO homeschool field trips this month! Our second one was at the Möbius Science Center. The kids all had a wonderful time and Bowen did a great job avoiding the areas that contained allergens for him. We have learned that if something is advertised as “sensory” we should really just avoid it as this often means chlorinated water, peas, beans, (in this case there is a LARGE lentil pit) soaps, clays, etc. it is a hard place for us though because Bowen is sensory seeking and developmentally delayed so sensory experiences are what his body actually NEEDS but we simply cannot let him play in things that are dangerous to his body. This is yet another reason we pray that the meds help him still play in the mud in the yard. And we PRASIE THE LORD for his occupational therapy each week.\n\nRorie and Evan had their Spring Piano recital this month as well! Evan did a beautiful job playing her songs. Rorie was a bit nervous being that it was her first recital but she absolutely ROCKED it and played all her songs from memory without a mistake! We are so proud of them both.\n\nThe second annual Paulapalooza Spring training went well this year! I didn’t get many pictures because it was 92° and Bowen’s body struggled regulating in the heat but we had a few new people show up which was awesome to see!\n\nWe trialed air fried baked and peeled apples for Bowen this month! Goodness he was sooooo excited to have something else to chew and eat. We gave it a solid week of trial but unfortunately we could not call it a pass. Bowen started showing symptoms of a fail that very evening. He wasn’t sleeping, (less than 4 hrs a night) his stools contained a lot of blood and mucous, his entire bottom was covered in a bleeding rash, he was angry (which is a major sign for him because he is usually such a happy sweet tempered boy) and he was inconsolable most of the day and night. The food fail also flared his mastocytoma on his skin and he was struggling with hives and neuropathy at night. (His legs/feet/arms/hands are covered in scratches and scabs from him itching them all night long) We are so sad about these results. Bowen just so badly wants to eat food and we would do anything to make that possible for him. I guess it just can’t be apples. We ask that you pray for quick and full healing for his little body. He needs to get back to baseline prior to his g-tube surgery. This is very important in order for his body to tolerate the anesthesia and accept the new feeding tube. His surgery is scheduled for June 27th in Seattle.\n\nAvery also had his band Spring Concert this month! He has grown so much in his playing. We are so so proud of him! The bands all did an amazing job. It was an awesome concert!\n\nPaul and I have been working hard at de-cluttering our house and one of the areas we tackled this month was the back porch! It somehow became a dumping ground over the years for anything and everything making it a mess and a completely wasted space. We gutted the entire thing cleaned it really well and built an outdoor bed for the kids! It has been such a sweet place for them to hang out, rest, and play. We are so thankful for this new found space and can foresee many sibling sleepovers out there in the future!\n\nWe learned that a local plant nursery does activities each month for kids! So we met Grandma Diane there and the kids filled out their entire plant scavenger hunt each receiving their own free snapdragon plant! It was such a sweet morning together and so fun looking at all the beautiful plants and flowers. What a blessing to have these local businesses pour into kiddos and encourage their learning and grow their knowledge.\n\nTo wrap up the month we went up to Priest Lake for one night and attended the local craft fair and parade as we always do Memorial Day weekend. It is such a sweet time with Grammy and Papa and the kids LOVED the parade!\n\nWe are thankful, however, that we had previously decided to only stay one night at the cabin because the next day Bowen’s body went into shock three times. Throughout this entire journey we are constantly reminded that God’s timing is always perfect. Had we been at the cabin when this happened the entire thing would have been so much more stressful likely resulting in an ambulance ride being out of range of emergency services and a 2 hour drive from the children’s hospital. We believe this reaction is left over from the apples and that it was yet another delayed reaction but unfortunately with that response from his body it just confirms that he absolutely cannot have apples in any form including applesauce. It is very common for one food failure to take another formerly “safe” food down with it. So though we are sad that Bowen is back to just celery we are thankful he still has something he can chew and crunch. We are asking that you pray his body will still tolerate celery. It is possible that apples didn’t only take applesauce but celery as well. But only time will tell. We placed Bowen on a 5 day steroid treatment to help heal and calm down his gut and to hopefully allow him to keep celery as a safe. Please pray for him on the steroid. Pray that it does its job well and that everything calms down soon.\n\nAs we have said many times before we are soooooo thankful for the feeding tube. When he went into shock we were able to hydrate him at home avoiding the hospital (and the stress that comes with it) and he eventually came back around to his normal self. We would love to be able to remove the tube and have him sustained on his own by oral intake but in the process of adding foods for him by mouth he has lost interest in his bottle almost entirely. So rather than using the tube LESS as time goes on we are actually using it MORE. We are so thankful for the tube but it doesn’t make the process any easier seeing him so reliant upon it. Please pray Bowen doesn’t strike his bottle all together and pray for Paul and I in the day to day. He will drink it before nap and bedtime but that means we are pumping him 5 times a day. Again, we are thankful for this option but we desire for him to eat by mouth. It is easy to see these things as major set backs but in fact they are all still part of God’s plan and we must just keep walking forward in faith. We are thankful for a Heavenly Father that we can lean heavily into no matter what comes our way.\n\nThe following day we were able to attend the Memorial Day breakfast pot luck with our church family at the park. Bowen is a perfect example of what the Bible means in Lamentations 3:22-23 “The steadfast Love of the Lord never ceases; His mercies are never ending. They are new every morning. Great is your faithfulness” Each day is new and even after a scary frightening day we rise the next morning with new mercy from a Father whose love never ends and we begin again.\n\nWe had to watch Bowen closely at the park keeping him extra hydrated and pumping his bottles right on time but he ran around and played with his buddies all the while wearing his “pirate hat” (cooling rag tied around his head) to keep him from overheating. There is a lot that goes into keeping Bowen’s little body alive and functioning in a semi normal way but with many resources and tips and tricks (many of which we have learned from other medical parents) we are able, for the most part, to allow Bowen to do most “normal” things with his siblings. And for that we are very thankful. It is scary for Paul and I but we do our best not to show our concern so the kids don’t take on that fear from us. We love to do things as a family and we LOVE parenting TOGETHER. God is so good.\n\nOverall it was a really hard month as far as Bowen is concerned and all the emotions and ups and downs that came along with it. But we continue to see God’s grace woven into every single thread of our lives. We so badly wanted apples to work for him but that just wasn’t the plan. We wished he could keep his applesauce as well but unfortunately it didn’t work out that way for him. It is hard when he still asks for them every day. It is hard to tell him “no” he can’t have this food or that. And it is painful to see him sit and watch others eat when he cannot. It is all really really hard but we truly feel the peace that comes from Christ alone every single day and we do honestly trust that the Lord has a plan for us, our family, and especially our sweet boy. We continue to move forward one step at a time in faith and very much prayer.\n\nMoving into June we are asking for prayer in the following areas.\n\n⁃ Bowen’s surgery is on June 27th in Seattle. We have rented an air bnb and plan to make this a family time. Please pray for details. Pray for food (always a complex and expensive thing for us) for all the arrangements, the planning and preparation, and please pray for finacnces. As you all know everything is so expensive right now and we have found that no matter how well you plan ahead medical issues (and really children in general) always bring with them surprises and unknowns. Please pray that Paul and I remember that none of this is a surprise to God and He has a very perfect plan physically, emotionally, spiritually and financially for our family.\n\n⁃ Pray for the other kids. They are already worried for their brother’s upcoming surgery. This worry leads to nightmares, daily concern, and anxiety for them all. That being said it also brings with it many gospel conversations and for that we are very thankful. Pray for peace for us all and for these conversations to be sweet and gospel filled for each of them no matter what time of day or night they occur.\n\n⁃ Pray for these last couple weeks of school wrapping up and for our family as we shift into a summertime schedule. Pray the big kids to end the school year strong with their studies and that we find a solid but semi flexible routine for our summer days together.\n\n⁃ I would also appreciate prayer for my own health. We are assuming it is the prolonged stress of caring for Bowen and the other kids but my own health has been struggling lately. I too have been having strange allergic reactions to various things and now have an EPI pen as apparently I have quite the oral allergy to mushrooms. God has been and continues to sustain us all and for that we are beyond grateful. Pray that I prioritize rest and don’t ignore my own body when it too needs care and nurturing.\n\nThank you all for faithfully following our journey. We are so blessed and encouraged by the calls/texts/gift cards for groceries/messages. KEEP THEM COMING! We love and appreciate each of you so much!\n\nLynette."
