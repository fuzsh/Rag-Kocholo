        "text": "Artist Name: LeeAnn Purvis\n\nHometown: Callahan Florida\n\nWhat projects are you currently working on?\n\nI’m currently working on a new music video for my song called “Stay” which is on my “Dream It Anyway” album. Currently recording new songs for my new album including a duet.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue a career in music and when did you know?\n\nI can’t remember a time when music wasn’t apart of my life. Even when I was 5 years old and at my very first vocal lesson with my coach. I knew this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.\n\nIf you weren’t pursuing a career in music, what would you be doing for a living?\n\nAs a freshman in high school, I haven’t had a chance to really think about anything else but music. Music is my life.\n\nIf you could only listen to one album for the rest of your life, what would it be?\n\nI would listen to George Strait‘s “Troubadour”.\n\nWhat is the greatest country song of all time?\n\nOne of the greatest songs of all time to me is “When You Say Nothing At All” by Allison Krauss.\n\nWhat has been your favorite city/town that you’ve visited out on the road?\n\nI have two favorite cities and both are completely different. One is New York. I think it’s a fun place to visit, but I wouldn’t want to live there. The other is Pigeon Forge Tennessee. A lot of fun things to do there and the mountains are beautiful. Will be visiting both cities again this year.\n\nWhat is your favorite meal?\n\nMy favorite meal is steak and bake potato.\n\nWhat is your favorite downtime activity?\n\nReading is my favorite downtime activity. I have always loved to read.\n\nWho is your biggest celebrity crush?\n\nMy biggest celebrity crush, like most teenage girls, is Noah Beck.\n\nWho is your favorite sports team?\n\nIf I were a sports fan, I would choose the Florida Gators because that’s where I’m from.\n\nWhat is the last movie that you watched?\n\nThe last movie I watched is one of my favorite movies, ‘A Walk To Remember!’\n\nWhat is the last about you listened to?\n\nThe last album I listened to was “Rise And Shine” by one of my favorite Artist, Cassadee Pope and my favorite song in there is “Let Me Go”.\n\nWho is your dream duet partner?\n\nAs a child one of my first Idol’s was Carrie Underwood. I remember laying in bed at night when I was 5 years old singing along and watching all her videos. She was also the very first concert I’ve ever attended so, I definitely would have to choose her as my dream duet partner.\n\nWho would you like to go on tour with?\n\nI would be blessed and thankful to go on tour with ANY Country Music Artist.\n\nWhat is your ultimate career goal?\n\nMy ultimate career goal would be to attend Lee University in Tennessee and eventually perform professionally as a Singer, Songwriter."
