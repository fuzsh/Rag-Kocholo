        "text": "Info\n\nABOUT ME\n\nName: J.D. Myers\n\nBirthdate: January 17, 1977\n\nBirthplace: Baltimore, MD\n\nParents: Mother, Nancy...Father, Joe\n\nSiblings: Brothers, Rob, Jeremy...Sister, Becky\n\nHeight: 5'11\"\n\nHair: Brown...but it changes color based on my mood.\n\nEyes: Hazel\n\nHigh School: Homeschooled from 5th to 12th.\n\nCollege: Liberty University, Lynchburg, VA\n\nFirst Job: Chick-Fil-A at age 16 (NEVER AGAIN!)\n\nRole Model: Because I was so into music, I idolized musicians like Michael W. Smith a lot. I would see him in concert and mimic his style because I hadn't figured out my own sound yet. More than that, though, I'd say that my parents. Everything I know and do now stems from something that they've influenced. They've kept me from so many crappy situations. Not bad for role models, huh?\n\nIdeal Type of Girl: I am SO picky!!! It wouldn't hurt if she were attractive, but looks are relative though, what I like in a girl, my friends might not like. Personality wise, I really like girls with confidence. I'm kind of a shy guy sometimes, so I like a girl who can stand up for herself and is confident with who she is. Character means a ton to me too. I like a girl who has strong morals and knows why she believes what she believes. I also am a pretty emotional person, so I like girls who know how to communicate what they're thinking.\n\nPet Peeves: BAD DRIVERS AND TRAFFIC! I live in Orlando, home of the tourist. There are so many bad drivers here!!!!! They just clog up the roads.\n\nIn My CD Player Now: Michael Jackson's \"Invincible\", Brian McKnight's \"Superhero\", Ginny Owens' new CD \"Something More\" (a great great great singer and a good friend of mine), Lifehouse, POD's \"Satellite\", Craig David (like the sound, not feelin' some of the lyrics though), \"City on a Hill 2\" (a Christian praise CD), Filo (some friends of mine, about to get a major deal, you'll hear more about them later), Stacie Orrico's \"Genuine\" (a 16 yr. old Lauryn Hill sound-alike, awesome skills).\n\nBiggest Dream: I want to win a Grammy!!!!! HAHA The chances of that happening are slim but why not aim high??????\n\nFirst big concert you went to: First big concert...Michael W Smith and DC Talk at Hershey Park Arena in PA.\n\nABOUT MY MUSIC\n\nWho else have you met in the music industry besides O-Town and Britney Spears?\n\nI was signed to Johnny Wright's record label, and since he was Britney and N'sync's manager, I met them a few different times. I met and chatted with Tyra Banks last week (she's starting a music thing). I've mostly met Christian singers over the past 3 years. I've met a ton of them, Chris Rice, Ginny Owens, Avalon, Plus One, Joy Williams, Anointed, Cindy Morgan. Most of those are artists that not many have heard of, but to some people, they're \"famous\".\n\nIf you could work with any artist once you get big, who would it be?\n\nI would LOVE to work with Brian McKnight. He's just got such an amazing ability. Just to be able to record a track by him would be unbelievable. I used to want to record a duet with Jessica Simpson, but I think I've gotten out of that phase! And I consider producers to be huge too, I'd love to record with Rodney Jerkins or this dude Mookie Taylor (he does a bunch of HOT Christian tracks).\n\nGrowing up, what artists influenced you & made you want to be a singer?\n\nI was really into Christian music, and I adored Amy Grant growing up. I loved her stuff because it was just fun to listen to. I really liked Michael W Smith and found myself emulating his voice a lot. Later on, I started getting into Mariah Carey. I would just sing her first couple CDs over and over again until I knew every note. I was a pretty big fan of Cindy Morgan too. She's another Christian singer who came out when I was in my mid-teens. She not only had a smooth voice that I loved, but her songwriting was really deep.\n\nWhat first sparked your interest in singing & how long have you been doing it?\n\nI've been singing since I was a kid. I remember getting yelled at by my brothers when we were on family vacations, traveling to NC from MD in our station wagon. I'd be singing with my headphones on, not caring what anyone thought. Singing came naturally to me, and I was always interested in music and the music business. I started taking lessons when I was 15, and kept on singing through college. I don't think I would have kept on doing it, had I not seen growth over the years. I started developing my own sound and figuring out what worked and what didn't as far as my voice was concerned. That kept my interest going once it had been sparked.\n\nWhat kind of music will you or your group do?\n\nProbably something on the Pop/R&B side. Most likely, it'll be a pop/r&b blend, something urban yet catchy enough to get on the radio. But right now, I'm just playing around with different styles and sounds, different for me at least.\n\nOnce you make it big, where's somewhere you'd love to go on tour?\n\nI definitely want to tour the States. Just because I want to meet all these fans that have been so awesome already! I've never been to the west coast, but I've also never been overseas, and I'm really anxious to tour Europe. I talk about that pretty often actually. I just want to have a gold record in Malaysia! (Hahaha! Just kidding!)\n\nABOUT MAKING THE BAND/O-TOWN\n\nHave people been noticing you more now since MTB?\n\nLOTS!!!!!! I've been approached just about every time I go somewhere where there are a lot of people just hanging out (the movies, restaurants, the mall). It's hilarious. I love it, seriously. I doubt that will EVER become old!!! Just last night, I was downtown in Orlando and I got spotted by about 15 different people. I even had to take a picture with a girl and sign an autograph. Now THAT'S odd.\n\nDid fans find out where you live yet?\n\nNope, no ones found out yet. I don't think that's a very interesting thing to find out though. Its just a house and I doubt its of any interest to fans!\n\nHave people been treating you nicer, or ruder since the show?\n\nPeople have been really nice since the show. I've actually had a lot of people come out of no where (people from college and from my hometown). It's funny to see people actually wanting to know about my life. It makes me realize though how attention makes people view you differently. Its been all good though.\n\nHow has winning that contest changed your life?\n\nIt's completely opened up doors that I wouldn't have been able to open myself. God, of course, orchestrated this whole thing, considering I hadn't even planned on auditioning in the first place. But the contest itself gave me exposure that I couldn't have found without it. Having my face shown on an episode that aired over 15 times in 2 weeks is awesome promotion for me. The fact that I have a fan base, no matter how small it is, is something that I've been able to use as proof that people would be interested in something I did. That's helped convince my manager that I'm something worth the time.\n\nHave you had a lot of weird fan encounters?\n\nYeah, I think the oddest time was when I was spotted for the first time at House of Blues. I went to a free concert by a teen pop group, and I was approached by the girl who was labeled by the show's editors as the \"teenybopper\" from my episode. She was kinda mad at me, said I had humiliated her on national TV and asked me why I \"dissed\" her. I had never been noticed in public, and the first time, I was getting yelled at! Not fun! I apologized and told her that I wasn't making fun of her, and I assured her that O-Town hadn't made fun of her either. I walked outside and had a couple packs of people staring and whispering. A few minutes later, that same girl came back up to me and started venting to me again. I apologized again, told her that I had no control over how it was edited, but that I knew no one had made fun of her, at least in front of me. When I said \"bye\", she started cussing me out with her friends. But since then, every single encounter has been great.\n\nWho was the nicest to you while you spent the week with the guys of O-Town?\n\nEveryone was totally cool. But I'd have to say that Ashley and Trevor are the 2 who I clicked with the most. They are completely genuine and our conversations were totally real and easy. I could tell they were gonna be friends that I'd hang out with after the show was done.\n\nHave you gotten any VIP treatment from places since you've been on the show?\n\nYeah, I actually have. There's this club called Matrix here in Orlando, and I've gotten to know some of the people who frequent there pretty often, so I've been getting some nice treatment lately. But I haven't been treated like royalty or anything. I've just mostly experienced comments and autograph seekers!\n\nFAVES\n\nSINGERS:\n\nWhitney Houston, Lauryn Hill, Mariah Carey, Richard Marx, Lifehouse, U2, N'sync, Brian McKnight, DC Talk, Amy Grant, Michael W.
