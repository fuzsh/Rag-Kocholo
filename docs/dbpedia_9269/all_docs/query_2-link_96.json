The One Valley Community Foundation is a place-based funder that has galvanized more than $18 million for 200+ local nonprofit organizations and regional initiatives. In 2016, Bridget was named a 20 Under 40 recipient, an honor that spotlights southwest Montana’s top young business professionals. In 2017, she was selected to be one of 10 executive directors in the U.S. to participate in the CFLeads Executive Leadership Institute for community foundations. In 2018, she took the stage at TEDxBozeman to speak about how community can be a solution to the loneliness epidemic.

In this time, he worked to address the complex challenges and multiple compounding crises that the city faced by breaking down silos, highlighting the need for effective data, improving internal and external communication, and by convening people that didn't always agree to find a common path forward. This experience, coupled with time spent in the private sector at both a sales and marketing firm and at a business development consulting firm, inform Mark's passion for working across boundaries, industries, and ideologies to meet Gallatin County's needs.\n\nJill Ellwood\n\nNonprofit Programming & Relations Manager\n\njill@onevalley.org(406) 587-6262 ext. 20\n\nJill is originally from Denver and has called the Gallatin Valley home since 2012.
