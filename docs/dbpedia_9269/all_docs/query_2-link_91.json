This beautiful deluxe package (created by Lennox herself) includes a 36-page bound book with photos and detailed notes on the songs created and lyrics as well as a DVD that features Annie discussing the album and a video of Lennox performing “I Put A Spell On You” live. \"To have been given the opportunity to record these classic, timeless songs on such a significant label as Blue Note, representing 75 years of legendary jazz history, is truly a privilege for me,\" said Annie Lennox.\n\nCD TRACK LISTING:\n\n1 Memphis In June 2:47\n\n2 Georgia On My Mind 3:55\n\n3 I Put a Spell On You 3:32\n\n4 Summertime 5:12\n\n5 I Cover the Waterfront 2:59\n\n6 Strange Fruit 3:46\n\n7 God Bless the Child 3:03\n\n8 You Belong To Me 3:22\n\n9 September In the Rain 2:53\n\n10 I Can Dream, Can’t I? 2:56\n\n11 The Nearness of You 2:32\n\n12 Mood Indigo 5:34\n\nBONUS DVD:\n\nRUN TIME: 22:18\n\nNTSC Region 0\n\nAUDIO: 2.0 PSM Stereo\n\nSUBTITLES: English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Brazilian, Spanish\n\n1 Annie Lennox Discusses Nostalgia 18:35\n\n2 I Put A Spell On You (Live Performance) 3:43\n\nBrilliant Corners -- SACD\n\nThelonious Monk\n\n1957/2004 Riverside Records\n\nBy the fall of 1956, Riverside was finally primed to unleash Thelonious Monk upon the jazz world--straight, no chaser. Two superb piano trio albums of covers had set the stage for Monk the composer to re-emerge with horns, and the pianist responded with BRILLIANT CORNERS, one of his greatest recordings, featuring three classic new tunes and two formidable studio bands.The Sonny Rollins featured on BRILLIANT CORNERS is a far more imposing presence than the young acolyte of previous Monk sessions--just witness the title tune. With its multiple themes, quirky intervallic leaps, idiomatic rhythmic changes and tricky transitions in tempo, it is one of Monk's masterpieces--a miniature symphony. So daunting were its technical challenges, that the final ending was edited on from another take. Rollins begins his solo with swaggering composure, boldly paraphrasing Monk's vinegary intervals and trademark trills, before navigating the swift rapids of the double-time chorus with deft syncopations. Monk plies dissonance upon dissonance in his first chorus, playing rhythmic tag with Max Roach on the out chorus. Ernie Henry's slip-sliding bluesiness is followed by a brilliant rhythmic edifice from Roach, who maintains melodic coherence at a drowsy tempo, then explodes into the final chorus.Elsewhere, \"Ba-Lue Bolivar Ba-Lues-Are\" is a soulful, easygoing blues, and Monk's solo is a compendium of pithy rhythmic devices, bent notes and calculated melodic abstractions, played with enormous relaxation and swing. He concludes with heckling big-band figures that form the basis for Rollins' expressive rhythmic testimonies. Monk employs the bell-like timbre of a celeste to stunning effect on \"Pannonica,\" one of his loveliest melodies and improvisations. And in closing, \"Bemsha Swing\" is a hard-swinging, conversational performance, with fine contributions from trumpeter Clark Terry, bassist Paul Chambers and Roach on drums and timpani.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

The answer is: yes. Nothing challenging here, just some praiseworthy good times. If you have been fortunate enough to attend church meetings with keyboardists like the late (and greatly-missed) Gene Harris or Jack McDuff, then you know what much of the shouting is about at those big revival meetings. I'm a big Gene Harris fan and he was in fine form here, swinging particularly hard on \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\", \"This Little Light of Mine\" and \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken.\" It's obvious that Gene loved and was comfortable with this music and these songs. The two biggest surprises for me (both pleasant) were \"Amazing Grace\" and \"(Jesus Keeps Me) Near the Cross\". When I first heard \"Amazing Grace\", I was sure it was Ray Charles. Vocalist Curtis Stigers does a beautifully soulful job on this timeless classic while Gene plays some very bluesy piano. \"(Jesus Keeps Me) Near the Cross\" is a duet between McDuff and Harris that brought back memories of my childhood. I was taken back to the days when I would be home from school and my mother would listen to Gospel radio all morning while she did her chores. How I would have liked to have heard Gene play \"The Old Rugged Cross\"!\n\nWhen I first listened to this CD, I was slightly disappointed and nearly gave it only three stars. After a few more listens I realized, however, that the disappointment was due to my preconceived notions of what I thought the CD would be like. Once I accepted it for what Gene wanted it to be and not what I thought it would be, I grew to like it. Now, I listen to it quite often.\n\nIf you are under the impression that Gospel music is boring or that jazz can't be done reverently, give this a listen and see if maybe your opinion doesn't change.\n\nTrack listing\n\n1.

In fact, she was probably more successful in her recording career than as a movie star. \"Cry Me A River\" is a classic '50s track, right up there with June Christy's \"Something Cool\" and Chet Baker's \"My Funny Valentine.\" The singer is aided immeasurably by the spare, sympathetic accompaniment of Barney Kessel on guitar. (In some ways, it's just as much his session as hers, which is why it sounds so much like real jazz.) One can imagine her performing this set in a small Hollywood club or even her own living room. She is relaxed and confident, and doesn't try to do too much vocally, which was a smart choice all around. One can only imagine what Marilyn Monroe would have sounded like in similar circumstances.\n\nJulie Is Her Name (Mono):\n\n1 \"Cry Me a River\" Arthur Hamilton 2:36\n\n2 \"I Should Care\" Paul Weston/Axel Stordahl/Sammy Cahn 2:35\n\n3 \"I'm in the Mood for Love\" Jimmy McHugh/Dorothy Fields 2:28\n\n4 \"I'm Glad There Is You\" Paul Madeira/Jimmy Dorsey 2:34\n\n5 \"Can't Help Lovin' That Man\" Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein II 3:08\n\n6 \"I Love You\" Cole Porter 1:58\n\n7 \"Say It Isn't So\" Irving Berlin 2:00\n\n8 \"It Never Entered My Mind\" Richard Rodgers/Lorenz Hart 2:25\n\n9 \"Easy Street\" Alan Rankin Jones/Carlton 3:12\n\n10 \"'S Wonderful\" George and Ira Gershwin 1:33\n\n11 \"No Moon at All\" Redd Evans/Dave Mann 1:53\n\n12 \"Laura\" Johnny Mercer/David Raksin 1:37\n\n13 \"Gone with the Wind\" Allie Wrubel/Herbert Magidson 2:05\n\nJulie Is Her Name Vol. 2 (Stereo):\n\n1 \"Blue Moon\" Richard Rodgers/Lorenz Hart 2:20\n\n2 \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" Cole Porter 1:47\n\n3 \"How Long Has This Been Going On?\" George and Ira Gershwin 2:46\n\n4 \"Too Good to Be True\" Clay Boland 2:40\n\n5 \"Spring Is Here\" Richard Rodgers/Lorenz Hart 2:05\n\n6 \"Goody Goody\" Johnny Mercer/Matt Malneck 1:55\n\n7 \"The One I Love Belongs to Somebody Else\" Isham Jones/Gus Kahn 2:00\n\n8 \"If I'm Lucky\" Josef Myrow/Edgar DeLange 2:16\n\n9 \"Hot Toddy\" Ralph Flanagan/Herb Hendler 1:45\n\n10 \"Little White Lies\" Walter Donaldson 2:00\n\n11 \"I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan\" Arthur Schwartz/Howard Dietz 1:50\n\n12 \"I Got Lost in His Arms\" Irving Berlin 2:05\n\nPersonnel: Julie London (vocals); Howard Roberts , Barney Kessel (guitar).

There's always been an undefinable quality in her voice that I've been drawn to. No one else sounds like Natalie. Each of her albums are favorites of mine for different reasons. I treasure them all. With this new album Natalie has only cemented her status as one of America's very finest singer-songwriters. I guess the thing I love most about Natalie's music is the sincerity that is present in her voice in each word she sings. There's no pretense, no vocal showing-off. She allows the songs to be heard and the words, melodies and phrasing are allowed to exist equally. There's a maturity in this collection both in her voice and in the words and melodies that she sings that I appreciate and am grateful for. I've listened to this album only twice (since receiving it early this morning), but I already feel as though these songs have become familiar and treasured musical friends. I'm sure I will wear this CD out. If you've been a fan of Natalie's past music, I guarantee you will not be disappointed in this new work. If you are somehow just discovering her - buy this album. It's a great introduction to her music. You'll then have all of her other music to discover - lucky you!\n\n1. Ladybird\n\n2. Maggie Said\n\n3. Texas\n\n4. Go Down Moses\n\n5. Seven Deadly Sins\n\n6.

The End\n\nBest of bowie -- 2 CD Set\n\nDavid Bowie\n\n2002 EMI Records\n\nAmazon.com\n\nThough one of rock's most influential figures, David Bowie's accomplishments are pocked by some distinct ironies. His willful efforts at being a musical and visual chameleon spurred triumphs in genres as diverse as folk, glam, new wave, and electronica. Given the dizzying range and success of his '70s incarnations--from Ziggy to the Thin White Duke to the gaunt, goth-cypher of Low and Heroes--he seemed the artist most well-equipped to weather the changing tides of taste and trend, yet saw his career essentially shrink to cult status after scoring his biggest triumphs when he reshaped the soulless, dance-oriented club music of the early '80s into his own image. This 20-track compilation does little to address the Chinese puzzle that has been Bowie's post-'85 career, but it does deliver an artistically dizzying slate of hits as it skips from one early peak to the next, from evocative cabaret (\"Space Oddity,\" \"Changes\") through muscular glam-rock (\"Suffragette City,\" \"The Jean Genie\") to R&B (\"Young Americans,\" \"Fame\") and post-punk flirtations (\"Ashes to Ashes,\" \"Fashion\") to the dance-club hits (\"Let's Dance,\" \"China Girl,\" \"Modern Love\") and '80s one-off duets (\"Under Pressure\" with Queen, \"Dancing in the Streets\" with Mick Jagger) that essentially marked the end of his superstar reign. Whole eras and at least one classic '70s album (Low) go completely unaddressed, but all of Bowie's signature hits are here, as well as Earthling's powerful, underappreciated \"I'm Afraid of Americans.\" --Jerry McCulley\n\nDisc: 1\n\n1.

Rather than take the anticipated path, however, he New York singer offers a twist. Taking a page from Ally McBeal's resident torch singer Vonda Shepard, Osborne turns in an album of stylish covers of contemporary R&B classics. She wraps her husky voice around a supper-club version of Otis Redding's \"These Arms of Mine,\" underscores the message behind Edwin Starr's \"War\" at a funeral pace, and gives James Taylor a shudder with her lush, Eastern-tinged take on Marvin Gaye's \"How Sweet It Is.\" Most unexpected. --Aidin Vaziri\n\nTrack listing\n\n1.

Like Identity Crisis (2003) and Suit Yourself (2005), this sparse, unguarded collection was produced by Lynne, who evokes a live-in-the-studio vibe from a stellar group of musicians.\n\nBorn in Quantico, VA, she grew up in Jackson, AL and headed to Nashville at an early age. At 18, Lynne s demos landed her an appearance on TNN s Nashville Now series, which led to a Top 50 duet ( \"If I Could Bottle This Up\" ) with George Jones and a record deal. Following the release of the critically acclaimed I Am Shelby Lynne in 2000, she won the GRAMMY® for Best New Artist. She made her acting debut in 2005, playing Johnny Cash's mother in the Fox Searchlight motion picture Walk the Line.\n\n1. \"Rains Came\" 2:25\n\n2. \"Why Didn't You Call Me\" 1:39\n\n3. \"Like a Fool\" 3:58\n\n4. \"Alibi\" 4:25\n\n5. \"Something to Be Said\" 3:53\n\n6. \"Family Tree\" 3:45\n\n7. \"Loser Dreamer\" 4:52\n\n8. \"Old #7\" 3:32\n\n9. \"Old Dog\" 5:27\n\n10. \"Home Sweet Home\" 3:32\n\nFunky Good Time: The Anthology -- 2 CD Box Set w/book\n\nThe J.B.'s\n\n1995 Polygram Records\n\nThe J.B.'s recorded under various billings in the early '70s, including the J.B.'s, Fred Wesley & the J.B.'s, Maceo & the Macks, the First Family, the Last Word, and others. This double CD gathers 30 of the prime tracks by all of the above configurations from the first half of the '70s, including all nine of their chart hits and quite a few rare singles and long versions. Often, James Brown himself chips in with incidental vocals (though this is mostly instrumental) and keyboards. The two-and-a-half-hour program can start to sound monotonous if taken all at once, but it's prime, often riveting funk, jammed with lockstep grooves that vary between basic R&B vamps and imaginative, almost jazzy improvisation. ~ Richie Unterberger\n\nTrack Listing\n\nDISC 1:\n\n1.

Few melodies are as captivating as the one Jones sings against the skeletal acoustic guitar and bass backdrop of \"\"Stewart's Coat.'' On the uptempo, swing-folk \"\"Jolie Jolie,'' another nothing-held-back love song, her mumbly voice bends notes and smears them like a muted jazz trumpet. On her version of David Bowie's \"\"Rebel Rebel,\" she brings out the wounded insecurity lurking in the heart of every nonconformist. Traffic from Paradise is only the second album of original songs from Jones in 10 years, and the singer credits Leo Kottke for jumpstarting her stalled interested in songwriting. Kottke cowrote two of the new album's songs and plays guitar on six of them. --Geoffrey Himes\n\n1. \"Pink Flamingos\" – 6:31\n\n2. \"Altar Boy\" – 2:27\n\n3. \"Stewart's Coat\" – 4:31\n\n4. \"Beat Angels\" (Sal Bernardi) – 4:11\n\n5. \"Tigers\" – 5:48\n\n6. \"Rebel Rebel\" (David Bowie) – 4:39\n\n7. \"Jolie Jolie\" – 4:26\n\n8. \"Running From Mercy\" (Jones, Leo Kottke) – 6:01\n\n9. \"A Stranger's Car\" – 2:53\n\n10. \"The Albatross\" (Jones, Kottke, John Leftwich) – 3:12\n\nStars -- Remastered K2HD CD\n\nJanis Ian\n\n1974/2010 Rude Girl-Columbia/Victor Japan (Import)\n\nAfter a three-year (1971-1974) hiatus, singer/songwriter Janis Ian (guitar/vocals) reinvented her craft on the groundbreaking Stars (1974) long-player. Her penchant for hauntingly beautiful melodies and incisive lyrics remains at the center of Ian's craft as she weaves an array of uniquely expressive observations with timeless poignancy. She has publicly acknowledged that the introspective title track that opens the album was inspired by Don McLean's \"Vincent.\" Ian's reflections are almost naked in their intimacy as she looks within the psyche of celebrity and draws comparisons between the respective astral and physical bodies that \"Stars\" inhabit, albeit briefly in either case. The song's sparse acoustic guitar self-accompaniment is somewhat an anomaly as the remainder of the album incorporates various backing combos. The cosy and laid-back \"Page Nine\" demonstrates a jazzier side to Ian's arrangements and features some inviting contributions from percussion legend and studio heavyweight George Devens (vibraphone), who had been performing in Ian's studio coterie since her second release, For All the Seasons of Your Mind (1967). \"The Man You Are in Me\" is instrumentally highlighted by Richard Davis (bass), who impels the rhythm and provides Ian with a sonic backdrop beguiling the listener into its practically hypnotic melody. There is also a fair share of folk-infused material, ranging from the easygoing and heartfelt peon \"Thankyous\" to the decidedly more political and strident \"Dance with Me\" -- which deals fairly directly with the Vietnam experience. Perhaps the best-known cut on Stars also obliquely references the war and is considered the disc's crown jewel. \"Jessie\" is a riveting love song that is as beautiful as it is soul-wrenchingly poignant. The delicate understated score only adds to the composition's empathy. \"Applause\" fittingly concludes the effort in a Broadway-esque fashion with a grandiose production reminiscent of something out of Cabaret or A Chorus Line. The understated and comparatively reticent middle section is dramatically bookended with an otherwise embellished and knowingly campy arrangement. Stars set the stage for Ian to further develop her mature and meditative themes utilizing a wide variety of musical styles -- a hallmark that separated her from her weepy and otherwise introspective peers. ~ Lindsay Planer\n\n1.

Beyond and beneath Parton’s well-publicized and oft-caricatured curves and angles, lurks the heart and soul of one of modern country music’s very best songwriters--the best, perhaps, since the great Loretta Lynn. In fitting celebration of the 35th anniversary of the release of Just Because I’m A Woman, Parton’s very first solo album, contemporary leading ladies of country and pop, including Norah Jones, Alison Krauss, Shania Twain, Joan Osborne, Melissa Etheridge, Emmylou Harris, and Sinead O’Connor have offered up worthy new interpretations of some of Parton’s classic compositions. That said, some of the highlights here are from lesser-known singers: Mindy Smith’s haunting rendition of \"Jolene,\" Kasey Chambers’ bitter-sweet take on \"Little Sparrow,\" and Allison Moorer’s tender turn on \"Light Of A Clear Blue Morning.\" --Bob Allen\n\n\"9 to 5\" - Alison Krauss\n\n\"I Will Always Love You\" - Melissa Etheridge\n\n\"The Grass Is Blue\" - Norah Jones\n\n\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\" - Joan Osborne\n\n\"The Seeker\" - Shelby Lynne\n\n\"Jolene\" - Mindy Smith\n\n\"To Daddy\" - Emmylou Harris\n\n\"Coat of Many Colors\" - Shania Twain and Alison Krauss\n\n\"Little Sparrow\" - Kasey Chambers\n\n\"Dagger Through the Heart\" - Sinéad O'Connor\n\n\"Light of a Clear Blue Morning\" - Allison Moorer\n\n\"Two Doors Down\" - Me'shell Ndegeocello\n\n\"Just Because I'm a Woman\" - Dolly Parton"
