        "text": "Dr. Rene’ Holt has always had a love for animals, especially the exotic ones! She grew up in rural Mississippi and was always surrounded by her family pets which included dogs, cats, horses, sugar gliders, and even a raccoon. There wasn’t a time where she didn’t want to grow up to be a veterinarian. She has always had a true compassion for all animals.\n\nDr. Holt received her Animal and Dairy Science degree from Mississippi State University and from there she continued at Mississippi State and received her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine in 2011. She moved to the Huntsville area with her husband, Michael, after graduation and has been practicing in the area ever since.

Dr. Martin was raised right here in the Rocket City since she was 5 years old. Even from a young age it was clear that she had great compassion for animals of all kinds, including a brown recluse she once caught and tried to keep as a pet. Dr. Martin’s first official furry companion was a ferret named Pooky who she quickly realized needed more friends in the form of 2 more ferrets! Dr. Martin’s interest in animal care only grew with her as she spent more and more time out at the barn with her horse, Pogo.\n\nDr. Martin graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Animal Science from the College of Agriculture at Auburn University before continuing her education at Kansas State University where she earned her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine.
