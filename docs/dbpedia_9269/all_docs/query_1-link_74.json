        "text": "July 29, 2024\n\nNBCUniversal Introduces OLI for Olympic Games Paris 2024\n\nNBCUniversal introduces “OLI,” an AI-powered logic system that helps viewers find when, where and how to watch their favorite live events and programming throughout NBCU’s coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nDeveloped in partnership with Huge, a design and technology company, users navigating NBCU’s websites in the United States, including NBCOlympics.com. NBCSports.com, NBC.com, usanetwork.com, and today.com, can ask questions to OLI to seamlessly find up-to-date information on Paris Olympics programming.\n\nUtilizing natural language chat, OLI is able to tell users when and where they can watch live Olympic events across NBCU’s broadcast and cable channels and streaming service Peacock, as well as how to find coverage of specific athletes, teams, and countries.\n\nFor example, if a viewer wants to know when basketball is on, OLI might say, “You’re in luck! The U.S. women’s basketball team plays Japan today at 3 p.m. ET live on USA Network and Peacock.”\n\nAdditionally, OLI can synthesize personalized best viewing options for users depending on the time of day, time zone, and event schedule.\n\nThe NBC broadcast network and streaming service Peacock are the company’s primary platforms for its coverage of the Olympic Games Paris 2024. NBCU owns the U.S. media rights to the Olympic Games through 2032, which are scheduled for Paris (2024), Milan Cortina (2026), Los Angeles (2028) and Brisbane (2032). The host city for the 2030 Olympic Winter Games has not yet been chosen."
