        "text": "SIX years.\n\nSix years of God stories being shared every Friday.\n\nSix years of encouragement, spurring us on in our Faith walks, and leading us in closer fellowship with Jesus.\n\nI am honored to have journeyed this with you, my friend.\n\nThese 212 episodes will still live on, so feel free to go back and catch those you may have missed!\n\nwww.wrenrobbins.com/podcast\n\nOh, and if you JUST GOTTA HAVE WREN every week, head on over to my podcast ABOUT podcasting Don't Wing It!\n\nIn college, Brian Dixon started out heading down the “music-and-theatre” road, until a life-changing car accident redirected him. After being told he may never have kids (he now has 3) and not walking again (he’s completed numerous marathons and a number of triathlons), he views his life as a picture of God’s redemption and grace.\n\nDr. Dixon ended up training to be a teacher, where he met Julie, now his wife of 20 years. They are raising their children in Charlotte, NC to be entrepreneurial, kingdom-minded humans.\n\nLiving life as a believer means we need to have God’s Word in our hearts. But how does one DO that in these busy times? As Brian points out, we need to get into the Word every single day. It most likely means that we will have to sacrifice something; and, like Jesus, we may have to get up early and “get away.” Brian starts every day reading, praying, listening to the Abide app…doing whatever it takes to get God’s Word into his heart.\n\nListen in for encouragement to keep on keepin on, friend!\n\nFor full show notes, go to: www.wrenrobbins.com/podcast/212\n\nConnect with Dr. Brian Dixon on Instagram\n\nJoin Brian's book club!\n\nConnect with Wren on Instagram\n\nI know we can all agree that we all want to fight to help our kids have a happy, healthy life.\n\nAnd, part of that is teaching them to be healthy in their screen time.\n\nListen as I chat with Tracy Foster, one of the co-founders of S.T.A.R.T.

Can you relate to any of this?\n\nMy guest today, Carmen James, was so busy working hard at trying to achieve success according to the world’s definition, that she forgot a crucial piece enabling her to enjoy the fruits of her labor: self-care and stress management.\n\nNow can you relate?\n\nBut a dramatic and unexpected cancer diagnosis was followed by a three-month-long wait to see a specialist, a time which Carmen described as “the scariest, darkest, most horrific experience ever,” proved life-changing in ways she never expected.\n\nListen and go find Show Notes, here: www.wrenrobbins.com/podcast/210\n\nTo connect with Carmen, go to:\n\n​​http://carmenjamesfitness.com\n\nReach out to her on Instagram @carmenjamesfitness\n\nAnd on Facebook, Desperately Seeking Healthy and Happy\n\nIn today’s episode, I hope you will be touched and ministered by the conversation I had with my childhood friend, Angie.\n\nShe and Nathan have been married for 20 years, and are parents to Mariana (16), Adrian (13), and Graham (11). She works in Women’s Ministry at Faith Baptist Church in Memphis, TN.

Thinking she had done #allthethings a good, Christian wife was “supposed” to do, she realized that this was an example of mankind’s free will being exercised. The day after her family (they had a 13 yr-old and 16-yr-old) moved into the home she and her husband had designed and built themselves, he walked out.\n\nReeling, she remembers thinking “I don’t understand.”\n\nMelinda’s story is both heartbreaking and mesmerizing; alternately filled with pain and promise. Throughout the process of her divorce, one piece of Scripture was especially life-giving:\n\n\"The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.\" Job 33:4\n\nListen in and share this episode!\n\nGrab the FREE download Melinda mentions here:\n\nCharlotte Easley is a life coach with a background in clinical counseling work, specializing in trauma. She works with women to help them understand that their worth doesn’t come from what they do, but rather, who they are.\n\nWhen she was 56 years old, her youngest child went off to military school, but she knew that God wasn’t done with her yet! So she embarked on a “second journey” and began on a Master’s of Social Work program - in a classroom full of 20-somethings.\n\nSo much gold in this episode.

Her bucolic childhood included summers of selling souvenirs to “grockles” (tourists) and talking to people about Jesus at seaside church services. And then, in the dark winters, spending time enjoying family and going cycling in the dark.\n\nListen in to this great episode with Sharon!\n\nTo connect with Sharon, find her on Instagram, 61-things\n\nTo connect with Wren, find her on Instagram as well!\n\nWhen Kate Elmore turned 27, she had a baby.\n\nFive months after giving birth, she discovered she had thyroid cancer. And went through surgery. And radiation. And isolation. And more.\n\nHer faith is what carried her through. It was the light in a bad day, the peace that God gave her, the strength she didn’t know she had…\n\nAnd what brought her to the other side of her pain.\n\nKate sat down with me recently and told me about her journey.\n\nTo connect with Kate go to: www.instagram.com/shopwordwarriors\n\nMy friend and past coaching client Brandice Lardner is the host on The Grace-Filled Plate, where, as she describes it, she: helps Christian women ditch the diet mentality and find food freedom through their faith.

An early goal of hers was to retire by the age of 40. But over time, she began to question the concept of passive income and her approach to both money and work. She began to ask “What does my faith have to do with that and what does God say about it?”\n\n“Financial independence in and of itself isn’t wrong. It becomes wrong when it crosses the line so that I’m relying only on myself, and not on God.” Katie Jones\n\nWHOA...THAT^^^^^\n\nListen in and be encouraged!\n\nAlso, check out the Show Notes: www.wrenrobbins.com/podcast/0201\n\nIn order to celebrate the 200th episode of Friends of a Feather podcast, Monique Scrip interviewed ME.

In the middle of doing the assessment, they realized that their 2-yr-old daughter actually scored higher on the scale.\n\nThus, their adventure began.\n\nAbby talks about the unique specifics regarding their children’s characteristics, and what fueled her current calling to encourage and support parents of children with ADHD, using both Biblical and psychological tools.\n\nConnect with Abby at FlourishingFamilyCoaching.com and on Facebook @fam_flourish\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nFor FULL Show Notes, go to: www.wrenrobbins.com/podcast/199\n\nSend Wren a DM on the Friends of a Feather Podcast on Instagram!\n\nFive years ago today’s guest, Leslie Glass, found herself in a life situation that can best be described as chaotic. Her family moved away far enough to disconnect them from the life they knew, losing the support and closeness to friends and their church fmaily.

Friends of a Feather Podcast\n\n“Growing Slow” is not only the name of author Jennifer Dukes Lee's latest book but the topic of today’s conversation.\n\nLiving on a farm in rural Iowa, Jennifer and her husband loved the idea of leaving their fast-paced jobs to raise a family and run a farm. Far from the hustle and bustle they both had become accustomed to, she had no idea that stress, or “hurry sickness”, would ever again apply to her.\n\nUntil during a routine visit to her doctor, who told her that she truly needed to make some changes.\n\nEnjoy listening to this episode today!\n\nFor FULL Show Notes and links, go to: www.wrenrobbins.com/podcast/194\n\nGrab Jennifer's book here!\n\nConnect with Jennifer on Instagram\n\nConnect with Wren on Instagram\n\nDo you struggle with seeking the Lord in prayer?\n\nDo you ever get to a point where you think “I’m not going to do this well, so why even try?”\n\nIf so, you’re not the only one!\n\nThe perfectionist in us sometimes keeps us from going to God in prayer, and then we tend to feel guilty about that. Listen, getting lost in silly or inconsequential activities will happen (think: scrolling through Instagram or getting lost in Pinterest) - because we’re human.\n\nBut we don’t have to allow shame about doing those things to stop us from going back to God.\n\nWe don’t have to feel defeated before we even start. Val and I had a great conversation about her getting off Instagram last February. And if you’re struggling with getting sucked into any platform and being obedient to what God’s calling you to do personally, there’s lots of “gold” in this episode.\n\nFor Show Notes, go to: www.wrenrobbins.com/podcast/192\n\nGinny Owens has spent the last two decades as a singer/songwriter, author, teacher, and advocate.
