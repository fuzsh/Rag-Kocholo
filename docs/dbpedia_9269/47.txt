Product Description

CCM singer/songwriter Ginny Owens was born and raised in Jackson, MS; blind from the age of two, she graduated Belmont University with a degree in Music Education, but found most schools apprehensive about hiring a sight-impaired music teacher. Around the same time Owens recorded her first demo tape, soon signing to Rocketown Records; her debut album Without Condition followed in mid-1999.
