        "text": "Profession: British Prime Minister\n\nBiography: Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Leader of the Conservative Party from 1990 to 1997. Prior to holding these positions, Major worked in the cabinet of Margaret Thatcher, briefly holding the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nIn his first year, Major presided over British involvement in the Gulf War in March 1991 and negotiated the Maastricht Treaty in December 1991. In 1992 he led the Conservatives to a reduce majority in the House of Commons but won the most votes in British history, at 14,000,000. He also took the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism after Black Wednesday on September 16, 1992. This led to a loss of confidence the Conservative Party and Major was not able to regain a lead in the polls again.\n\nMajor began the Northern Ireland peace process in the mid-1990s. Despite these successes, Major's government suffered and he resigned as party leader in 1995 though was re-elected. At the 1997 general election, the Labour Party led by Tony Blair won a landslide victory and Major resigned as Prime Minister.\n\nBorn: March 29, 1943\n\nBirthplace: Carshalton, England, United Kingdom\n\nAge: 81 years old"
