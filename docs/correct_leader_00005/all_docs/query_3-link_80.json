        "text": "Skip the typical John Major introduction lecture as you launch a study of this Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and, instead, empower students to find their own interesting facts about Major’s life and political work with this “V.I.P. of History” print/post-and-go biography activity.\n\nThis single-page worksheet (includes printable PDF and Google Drive versions) is a powerful research organizer that’ll get students digging deep into John Major’s background.\n\nPlease note: This download does NOT include a specific article or links to defined articles. It is an organizer tool for students to use as they conduct their own research. In my experience, students take more ownership of the material when they are the ones to research and discover the elements that make Major’s life fascinating. They’ve seen enough of our introductory slideshows; this time, let your kids do the work and discuss/determine what they think is meaningful about this prime minister’s life.\n\nHere are a few suggested uses for this flexible research tool:\n\n1. Book your school’s computer lab or have students access John Major’s biographical information on their own devices. Assign students to either work solo or in teams of two. Once the grids are complete, have students share and compare answers in small groups, focusing on Major’s career successes/failures, interesting facts about his life, meaningful quotes, and his political philosophy. Then, pull the students into a full-class discussion, having each group present an interesting finding until every team has contributed. No repeats allowed.\n\nThis assignment works great as an “into” activity, but it could also be a “through” activity to add variety to your in-class routine as you work through a longer unit. It was built with both English and history/social studies teachers in mind.\n\n2. Assign the worksheet as a traditional homework assignment. Launch the discussion mentioned in #1 at the beginning of the next class period.\n\n3. Use the grid as the beginning assignment to a larger project where students must learn about several prime ministers or people from this era. Later, this research worksheet information could be turned into a compare/contrast essay or a speech presentation, if you wish to expand the assignment. Biography sheets on many British prime ministers (from Churchill to today) and a variety of other historical figures are available in my shop if you want to vary speech topics within one class.\n\n4. Use as an emergency sub plan.\n\nI hope you and your students enjoy this activity!\n\nIf you need a V.I.P. of History research organizer for any famous figure not currently offered in my shop, please send a message to me through the “Ask a Question” tab and I’ll do my best to quickly make that happen. Also, please note, the image on the student PDF worksheet is slightly ghosted to save printer/copier ink. I encourage students to doodle/shade in that space as they work.\n\nThis item is included in my value-priced bundle of the British prime ministers (Churchill to today) research organizers. If you need them all, please don’t purchase this individual item; instead, go here to save more than 25% on the full collection:\n\nhttps://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/British-Prime-Minister-Biography-Research-Bundle-Prime-Ministers-PDF-Google-7257403\n\nThanks for stopping by!"
