        "text": "The Presidency\n\nRonald Reagan was elected President of the United States on November 4, 1980. His triumph capped the rise of the new right/conservative wing of the Republican Party and ushered in a new era of governing. Reagan served as arguably the first true conservative U.S. president in over 50 years. Reagan advanced domestic policies that featured a lessening of federal government responsibility in solving social problems, reducing restrictions on business, and implementing tax cuts. Internationally, Reagan demonstrated a fierce opposition to the spread of communism throughout the world and a strong distrust of the Soviet Union, which in 1983 he labeled an \"evil empire.\" He championed a rearmed and strong military and was especially supportive of the MX missile system and the Strategic Defense Initiative (\"Star Wars\") program.\n\nEconomic Policy\n\nWhen Reagan took office the economy was one of double-digit inflation and interest rates near 20%. During the campaign Reagan promised to restore the free market from excessive government regulation and encourage private initiative and enterprise.\n\nReagan's economic policies highlighted his long-standing dislike of high federal income taxes. Reagan embraced the theory of \"supply side economics,\" feeling that tax cuts encouraged economic expansion which would result in increases in federal government revenue at a lower tax rate. Higher revenues would then be used to increase defense spending and balance the federal budget. This overall approach became known as \"Reaganomics,\" or as Republican primary candidate Vice President George H.W. Bush once called it, \"voodoo economics.\" The President also vowed to protect certain entitlement programs (like Medicare and Social Security) while cutting the budgets for other social programs by targeting waste, fraud and abuse.\n\nDuring his first year in office, Reagan engineered the passage of $39 billion in budget cuts into law, as well as a massive 25 percent tax cut spread over three years for individuals, and faster write-offs for capital investment for business. At the same time, he insisted on, and for the most part, was successful in gaining increased funding for defense.\n\nAlthough inflation dropped from 13.5% in 1980 to 5.1% in 1982, a severe recession set in, with unemployment exceeding 10% in October, 1982 for the first time in forty years. The administration modified its economic policy after two years by proposing selected tax increases and budget cuts to control rising deficits and higher interest rates. After the 1982 downturn, the reduced inflation rate (under 5% for the remainder of the administration), lowering interest rates, and added discretionary income from tax cuts sparked record economic growth, and produced one of the lowest unemployment rates in modern U.S. history (unemployment hit a 14 year low in June of 1988). As Reagan left office, the nation was experiencing its sixth consecutive year of economic prosperity.\n\nThe economic gains, however, came at a cost of a record annual deficit and a ballooning national debt. The budget deficit was exacerbated by a trade deficit. Americans continued to buy more foreign-made goods than they were selling. Reagan, however adhered to his free trade stance, and was the primary proponent of the Free Trade Agreement with Canada, which evolved into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). He also signed, reluctantly, trade legislation designed to open foreign markets to U.S. goods.\n\nDomestic Affairs\n\nReagan's domestic policies had a major impact on the American people and have had for many years. He followed up the passage of the largest tax cut in U.S. history by supporting and signing into law the Tax Reform law of 1986. Reagan led the battle for a Social Security reform bill designed to ensure the long-term solvency of the system, and oversaw the passage of immigration reform legislation, as well as the expansion of the Medicare program to protect the elderly and disabled against \"catastrophic\" health costs.\n\nReagan elevated William Rehnquist to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and appointed three justices to the bench: Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and the first woman named to the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O'Connor. Part of the New Right's basic beliefs was that \"judicial activism\" was un-Constitutional and judges should be selected by an adherence to \"judicial restraint.\" Reagan's judicial selections were based on this principle.\n\nReagan consistently received very high approval ratings. He was not popular with some minority groups, particularly African-Americans, many of whom did not benefit from the economic prosperity. In 1986, over 30 percent of the black population had an income below the official poverty level. While many labor leaders disliked Reagan, especially after he fired the air traffic controllers when they refused to end their strike (1981), he was popular with labor union members.\n\nReagan encouraged the development of \"private sector initiatives\" as well as federalism, with the objective of transferring from the federal government some of the responsibilities believed to be better served by private business or state and local government.\n\nAs the president called for international cooperation to stop the influx of illegal drugs, especially cocaine, into the U.S., First Lady Nancy Reagan led the campaign against drug abuse, urging the nation's youth to \"just say no.\"\n\nForeign Policy\n\nAt the heart of Reagan's foreign policy was preventing communist expansion in the world. US actions throughout the world demonstrated this including strong financial and military support of the Contras against the communist Nicaraguan government, the aid given to the government of El Salvador in their fight against the communist guerrillas, the U.S invasion of Grenada when that nation was perceived as falling under Cuban domination in 1983, the support given to UNITA anti-communist fighters in the Angolan Civil War involving Cuban proxy troops, and the support given to rebels fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan. These combined efforts were named \"The Reagan Doctrine.\" While efforts for peace in Central America faltered, the Soviets announced the withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan in 1988, and the Angola conflict was successfully negotiated with a withdrawal of Cuban troops.\n\nReagan believed that the nation should negotiate with the Soviet Union from a position of strength. To such an end, the administration embarked on a strategic modernization program which included the production of an intercontinental missile, a stengthened navy, and a feasibility study for the Strategic Defense Initiative. The increase in military spending, and the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev as General Secretary of the Soviet Union at the beginning of Reagan's second term, opened a new era of relations between the two superpowers. After a number of meetings between Reagan and Gorbachev, the two men signed an Intermediate Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty at the Washington Summit in December, 1987. The agreement promised to eliminate an entire class of intermediate-range nuclear missiles and was the first arms control agreement in history to reduce the nuclear arsenal. In addition, the administration began the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) which would reduce the strategic nuclear arsenals by 50%, including large multiple warhead missiles.\n\nWhen pro-U.S. dictators in Haiti and the Philippines appeared on the verge of being toppled from power, Reagan engineered their safe removal from their countries, ensuring bloodless coups and new government which, he hoped, would be friendly to the U.S.\n\nIn Middle East affairs, Reagan reported in his inaugural address that the 52 American hostages held in Iran for 444 days were at that moment being released and would soon return to freedom. The President maintained a firm stance against terrorism, exemplified by the American retaliating against Libya for an air attack in 1981 and again in 1986 for the death of Americans in a Berlin discotheque. Reagan's peacekeeping force in war-torn Lebanon experienced tragedy in 1983 when a truck bomb killed 241 soldiers. Tragedy struck again in 1987 when a missile from an Iraqi warplane killed 37 sailors aboard the U.S.S. Stark, part of a U.S. naval taskforce which had been sent to the Persian Gulf to keep that waterway open during the Iran-Iraq war.\n\nThe darkest hour of the Reagan administration would become known as the Iran-Contra affair. After lengthy, nationally televised hearings, a special congressional hearings review board reported that Reagan authorized the sale of arms to Iran in exchange for help in freeing U.S. hostages in Lebanon. Investigations revealed the money gained from the arms sale was illegally diverted to aid the Contras, opponents of the Nicaraguan Sandinista government. The congressional report criticized Reagan for his detached, hands-off style of management. In the aftermath of the affair, National Security Advisors Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter, as well as National Security Council aide Colonel Oliver North were indicted by a federal grand jury and convicted of various charges regarding the Iran-Contra operations. McFarlane was later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush and both Poindexter and North's convictions were set aside on appeal for technical reasons.\n\nThe Reagan Legacy\n\nThe eight years of the Reagan presidency was one of the most dynamic periods, in recent U.S. history, resulting in a major refocusing of the nation's social, business, and international agenda. More importantly, his election changed the demographic composition of the Republican Party and built the core beliefs still practiced today: lower taxes, less government restrictions on businesses and individuals and a strong military.\n\nFew presidents have enjoyed the affection of so many of the American people. Support for Ronald Reagan grew when he was seriously wounded by an assassin's bullet in 1981 and during major surgical procedures in 1985 and 1987. Reagan was known as the \"Great Communicator,\" and often went on television to ask the viewers for their support for a particular piece of legislation. When he ran for a second term in 1984 against former Vice-President Walter Mondale, Reagan stood by his record and asked the voters if they were better off now than they were four years ago. At 73 years of age, Reagan became, at the time, the oldest man ever elected president, receiving 525 electoral votes, the most of any presidential candidate. As his second term ended, polls showed that more than half of the American people gave him a favorable rating. When Ronald Reagan became president, he had a distinct vision of what the nation should be and spelled out the direction he hoped it would take during his administration. Reagan had a clear social, economic, and foreign policy agenda, and with political guile and personal persuasiveness he was able to achieve many of his goals. Early in his presidency, Reagan remarked: \"What I'd really like to do is go down in history as the President who made Americans believe in themselves again.\"\n\nA month before the election of his successor, Reagan looked back on his eight years in office: \"I am the same man I was when I came to Washington,\" he said, \"I believe the same things I believed when I came to Washington, and I think those beliefs have been vindicated by the success of the policies to which we hold fast.\"\n\nAbout his foreign policy, he said, \"At every point on the map that the Soviets have applied pressure, we've done all we can to apply pressure against them.\" He went on \"And now we are seeing a sight many believed they would never see in our lifetime: the receding of the tide of totalitarianism.\" Reagan lived to see the dismantling of the Soviet Union's communist empire and it's retreat from surrounding neighboring countries which ultimately resulted in the toppling of the Berlin Wall in the fall of 1989.\n\nChronology of the Reagan Presidency, 1979-1989\n\n1979-1980\n\n11/13/1979 Announcement for Presidential Candidacy\n\n07/16/1980 Ronald Reagan Wins the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention, Detroit, MI\n\n10/28/1980 Reagan/Carter Presidential Debate\n\n11/04/1980 Ronald Reagan Wins the Presidential Election in a Landslide Victory (489-49 Electoral College Votes)\n\n1981\n\n01/20/1981 Inauguration Day\n\n01/20/1981 American Hostages in Iran Released\n\n01/22/1981 Establishment of Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief\n\n01/27/1981 White House Ceremony for Iran Hostages\n\n01/29/1981 First Press Conference\n\n02/05/1981 Address to Nation on the Economy\n\n02/18/1981 Address to Congress on Economic Recovery Program\n\n02/26/1981 Initial Formation of the Cabinet Councils\n\n03/26/1981 Signing of Executive Order 12301 establishing the Presidential Council on Integrity & Efficiency\n\n03/30/1981 Assassination Attempt on the President by John Hinckley, Jr.\n\n04/11/1981 Release from George Washington Hospital\n\n04/28/1981 Address to Congress on Economic Recovery Program\n\n05/17/1981 Honorary Degree from Notre Dame University\n\n07/07/1981 Nomination of Sandra Day O’Connor to Supreme Court\n\n07/19/1981-07/21/1981 Summit of Industrialized Nations (\"G7) Summit in Ottawa, Canada\n\n07/27/1981 Address to the Nation on Federal Tax Reduction Legislation\n\n07/29/1981 Tax Cut Bill Approved by House of Representatives\n\n08/03/1981 Air Traffic Controllers Strike Ultimatum Issued by President Reagan\n\n08/13/1981 President Reagan Signs Tax Cut Bill, the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA)\n\n09/24/1981 Address to the Nation on Economic Recover & Social Security\n\n09/25/1981 Sandra Day O'Connor Sworn-In as First Female Supreme Court Justice\n\n09/29/1981 World Bank and IMF Address on Free Enterprise, Not Aid\n\n10/02/1981 US Strategic Weapons Program Announced\n\n10/05/1981 Voluntarism Initiative Launched\n\n10/06/1981 Assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\n\n10/07/1981 Fifty States Project for Women Launched\n\n10/15/1981 World Affairs Council Speech on Third World & Free Enterprise\n\n10/18/1981-10/19/1981 Celebration of the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Yorktown, with French President Francois Mitterand\n\n10/21/1981-10/24/1981 Cancun Summit on International Cooperation & Development\n\n10/28/1981 Airborne Warning & Control System (AWACS) Sale to Saudi Arabia Approved by the Senate\n\n11/10/1981 Director of the Office of Management & Budget David Stockman's Atlantic Monthly Article on Reaganomics Released\n\n11/18/1981 Arms Reduction Speech to the National Press Club\n\n11/23/1981 First Veto - 1982 Continuing Budget Resolution\n\n12/01/1981 White House Conference on Aging\n\n12/22/1981 Meeting with Defected Polish Ambassador Romuald Spasowski\n\n12/23/1981 Address to the Nation on the Situation in Poland\n\n1982\n\n01/26/1982 First State of the Union Address - Social Programs Transferred to States\n\n02/09/1982 Indianapolis Speech, One of Several Launching New Federalism\n\n02/22/1982 Ceremony on the 250th Anniversary of the Birth of George Washington\n\n02/24/1982 Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) Announced at Organization of American States (OAS)\n\n03/03/1982 J.
