        "text": "What support is available to former prime ministers after they leave office?\n\nPrime ministers are entitled to public financial support in the form of the Public Duty Costs Allowance (PDCA), which was established after Margaret Thatcher resigned. The PDCA allows a former prime minister to claim up to £115,000 a year – for life – for the “necessary office costs and secretarial costs arising from their special position in public life.” It is not a payment or bonus to the former prime minister as an individual.\n\nFormer prime ministers have claimed the following amount in recent years:\n\nIn 2022–23, Boris Johnson was eligible to claim PDCA after his resignation, though did not submit a claim to the Cabinet Office. Between leaving office in October 2022 and 31 March 2023, Liz Truss claimed £23,310.\n\nFormer prime ministers also continue to receive security protection.\n\nDo prime ministers get severance payments?\n\nAll ministers are entitled to a severance payment of 25% of their annual salary when they cease to hold office and are not reappointed within three weeks. For example, in 2021–22, the prime minister was entitled to a salary of £79,936, though Boris Johnson only took a payment of £75,440. This means he was entitled to a severance payment of £18,860.\n\nThe ministerial salary is in addition to the prime minister’s salary as an MP. From 1 April 2022, the annual salary for an MP is £86,584.\n\nDo prime ministers get special pensions?\n\nBefore 2013 there were separate pension arrangements for the prime minister, the speaker of the House of Commons and the lord chancellor (although both Gordon Brown and Jack Straw, then prime minister and lord chancellor, decided to forego these in 2008).\n\nSince the passage of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013, the prime minister has been included in the Ministers’ Pension Scheme, on the same basis as other ministers.\n\nThe Ministers’ Pension Scheme is part of the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund. The Fund also includes the MPs’ Pension Scheme. Former ministers, including former prime ministers, who were MPs receive pensions from both schemes."
