He was Foreign Secretary and then Chancellor of the Exchequer in Margaret Thatcher's last government.\n\nHe became Tory leader and Prime Minister on 28 November 1990, following Thatcher's resignation.\n\nDuring his first year in office, his decision to involve Britain in George Bush's Gulf War in March 1991 was controversial, but his government began the long process of bringing peace to Northern Ireland and, despite the Tories' growing divisions over Europe, it successfully negotiated the Maastricht Treaty in December 1991.\n\nMajor led his party to a historic fourth general election victory on 9 April 1992, albeit with a much-reduced Commons majority of 21, but his new administration quickly ran into problems. Following the disastrous events of 'Black Wednesday' in September 1992, it was forced to withdraw Britain from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, costing the country billions and the Tories their financial credibility.\n\nAt the 1993 Conservative Party conference, Major launched his 'Back to Basics' campaign, which was widely interpreted as a call for a return to 'Victorian' moral values. Sadly for him, the campaign was undermined by a series of scandals involving members of his government and he was criticised by colleagues for his weak leadership. In June 1995 he challenged his critics by resigning and standing for re-election, easily beating his only opponent, the right-winger John Redwood.\n\nNonetheless, his government was doomed. The Labour Party, rebranded 'New Labour' and with Tony Blair as leader, won a landslide victory at the general election on 1 May 1997.\n\nMajor continued to serve as MP for Huntingdon until his retirement from active politics in 2001.\n\nEducation\n\nFrom Margaret Thatcher, John Major inherited an education system which had suffered a significant decline in investment and a corresponding increase in inequality. Many hoped that his government would be less harsh than its predecessor. They were to be disappointed: his administration was equally committed to selection and elitism; equally determined to continue diminishing the role of the local authorities; and equally confrontational in its attitude to the teaching profession.\n\nClyde Chitty argues that Major's philosophy of education was\n\nan interesting mixture of a concern to promote Thatcherite privatising measures and a more traditional Conservative belief in the self-evident values of a meritocratic society. In his ideal world, schools would increasingly compete for pupils by offering various specialisations, with parents being encouraged to consult league tables as reliable guides to local authority, school and pupil performance. At the same time, during his administration there would be a continued blurring of the boundaries between the private and state sectors (Chitty 2009a:55).\n\nEducation secretaries\n\nThe education department was twice renamed during this period. The Department of Education and Science (DES) became the Department for Education (DFE) in April 1992, and then the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) in July 1995. The Secretaries of State were:\n\nSecretary of State for Education and Science:\n\n2 November 1990Kenneth Clarke (1940- )\n\nSecretary of State for Education:\n\n10 April 1992John Patten (1945- ) 20 July 1994Gillian Shephard (1940- )\n\nSecretary of State for Education and Employment:\n\n5 July 1995Gillian Shephard\n\nNovember 1990 - April 1992: Kenneth Clarke\n\nKenneth Clarke\n\nKenneth Clarke (pictured), the son of an electrician, attended Nottingham High School and read Law at Gonville and Caius College Cambridge.\n\nIn 1970 he entered Parliament as MP for Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, and was opposition spokesman on Social Services between 1974 and 1976.\n\nHe held several ministerial posts in Margaret Thatcher's governments, becoming Secretary of State for Health in 1988.\n\nHe was appointed education secretary on 2 November 1990, just a month before John Major replaced Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. He held the post until the general election in April 1992, when he became Home Secretary and, in May 1993, Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nClarke was said to be very popular with his civil servants but he was not much loved by teachers and others in the education service. For example, he was irritated by the complexity of the national curriculum and its assessment; he was correct in that judgement but wrong when he dismissed the standard assessment tasks as 'elaborate nonsense', and returned to simple but unreliable paper and pencil exercises. He was respected for his intelligence but he never gave the impression that he was interested in education in its wider sense (Lawton 2005:109).\n\nThe curriculum\n\nNational Curriculum\n\nIn an interview with Brian Sherratt on 27 June 1994, Clarke said that one of his first priorities on becoming education secretary was to 'get in the final bits of the National Curriculum, which was rolling through this cumbersome process we had created' (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:155). He realised he had the power to make changes to the recommendations of the various subject groups before issuing the Curriculum Orders.\n\nI don't think anybody advised me that none of our predecessors had made the slightest change to anything that came out of these committees. I responded quite strongly to draft recommendations on the subject of music and the subject of sport, I think. I changed the history and geography curriculum from the drafts put to me (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:155).\n\nHis motive for doing so was that he felt there was too little emphasis on knowledge in the drafts, which 'seemed to have lost the point of delivering a key knowledge on the subject that was required' (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:156).\n\nHe was also concerned that the subject committees had been 'subjected to far too much lobbying from outside interest groups' and that this had led to an overloading of the curriculum, which was 'massive' (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:156).\n\nI thought the curriculum should spell out the essential corpus of subject matter, knowledge and understanding that needs to be covered, leaving some scope for the individual teacher to demonstrate his or her flair or interest in delivering the subject (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:156).\n\nNot everyone was happy with Clarke's interference. In an editorial in Forum (Summer 1991), Clyde Chitty and Nanette Whitbread commented:\n\nDespite faults of over-prescription and, particularly, flawed testing, the National Curriculum had some potential for ensuring a 'balanced and broadly based curriculum' as a common entitlement from five to sixteen. ... But Clarke has abandoned that entitlement beyond 14 and instead resurrected the previously much criticised chaotic options just when comprehensive schools were busy devising new patterns, often modular, for more common and balanced learning experiences at 14-16. In arrogant contempt for professional advice, he tampers with content in the arts and humanities, then instructs SEAC to devise 'predominantly written' tests at 11 and 14, specifying 'terminal written examinations' for science and mathematics at 14 (Chitty and Whitbread 1991:67).\n\nSATs\n\nImplementation of the National Curriculum testing regime began in 1991. For schools, this took the form of SATs, variously referred to as Standard Assessment Tasks, Standard Assessment Tests or Standard Attainment Tests. The first Key Stage 1 tests were conducted in the summer term 1991:\n\nThis term many Infants will be minded not taught for several weeks while their teachers test seven year olds (Chitty and Whitbread 1991:67).\n\nAlthough he was a 'fervent believer in testing' (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:156), Clarke was not entirely happy with the arrangements which Kenneth Baker had put in place:\n\nI tried to make some sense of those wretched SATs. I wasn't the greatest fan of the ten levels of attainment system, but it seemed to me that we had gone far, far too far down the track for me to try to change that. But the actual nature of the SATs and the way that they were conducted left a lot to be desired (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:156).\n\nThe Key Stage 1 tests were 'a bit of a nightmare' and Clarke rapidly came to the conclusion that 'whoever devised them ... had not had a very good understanding of what it was really like to conduct a class of 7-year-olds' (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:157). The science tests caused particular problems:\n\nThere was one that involved a most fantastic amount of splashing of water, which people found that a class of 7-year-olds would no doubt enjoy - the 'sinking and floating' test ... certainly didn't work as it was supposed to work - everyone got very wet (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:157).\n\nClarke blamed the School Examinations and Assessment Council (SEAC) for the chaos and made some new appointments, including the head of a Surrey primary school by whom he had been 'wildly impressed':\n\nshe sat me down and gave me a most ferocious lecture about these SATs, and why they had created chaos in her school, and what was wrong with them. She persuaded me that she was genuinely not opposed to the idea of tests and results being available to the parents - it was just these particular wretched tests that she objected to (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:157).\n\nA year later, the second round of Key Stage 1 tests went 'extremely well', and the first league tables were produced 'with the minimum of fuss' (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:157).\n\nThe same could not be said of the secondary school tests which, said Clarke, were 'hopelessly over-elaborate' (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:157):\n\nParts of SEAC appeared to be determined just to grind on regardless with their particular approach, come what may. These tests were presented to me and my junior ministers, and as far as I can see with our comments going in one ear and out the other (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:157).\n\nClarke was concerned that the bureaucracy the government had created was in danger of discrediting the policy:\n\nI mean, the two quangos [SEAC and the National Curriculum Council] were producing mountains of paper, Swedish forests were going to produce cross-curricular themes and advice on the contents of the curriculum. And then SEAC producing these amazing sort of SATs to test it all. I was involved in trying to simplify it for a little over a year (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:158).\n\nReligious education\n\nAs noted in the previous chapter, the 1988 Education Reform Act had set out new rules on religious education (RE) and collective worship (school assemblies):\n\nevery day was to begin with an 'act of collective worship' (Section 6(1)), a majority of which were to be 'wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian character' (7(1));\n\nevery LEA was required to set up a Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education (SACRE) (11(1)) consisting of representatives of religious groups, the Church of England, teachers and the local authority (11(4)); and\n\nAgreed Syllabuses for Religious Education were to 'reflect the fact that the religious traditions in Great Britain are in the main Christian whilst taking account of the teaching and practices of the other principal religions represented in Great Britain' (8(3)).\n\nBy the end of 1990, many local authorities were reviewing their agreed syllabuses. To aid them in this task, in July 1991 the National Curriculum Council (NCC) published Religious Education: A Local Curriculum Framework, which sought to fulfil the Council's duty to\n\noffer advice to SACREs, agreed syllabus conferences, and LEAs who wish to consider the desirability of drawing up attainment targets and programmes of study for religious education in their authority, and to offer advice on their construction (NCC 1991:1).\n\nThe paper included:\n\nan outline of provisions of the 1988 Education Reform Act;\n\na short description of the National Curriculum framework;\n\nguidance on the issues to be considered when writing attainment targets, statements of attainment and programmes of study;\n\nadvice on applying a National Curriculum framework to RE;\n\nadvice on planning the RE curriculum; and\n\ntasks for groups working on a National Curriculum framework for RE.\n\nThe 'Three Wise Men' Report\n\nBackground\n\nBy the end of 1991, a general election was looming and Labour was ahead in the opinion polls. John Major and Kenneth Clarke believed that a return to streaming and old-fashioned teaching methods in primary schools would be a popular campaign policy, so Clarke enlisted the support of the media in launching an 'attack against Plowden and all it stood for' (Wrigley 2014:25). Child-centred approaches were to be replaced by traditional 'chalk-and-talk' teaching.\n\nIn order to provide some authoritative theoretical underpinning for the campaign, Clarke commissioned Robin Alexander, Jim Rose and Chris Woodhead (pictured, left to right) to produce a discussion paper on Curriculum Organisation and Classroom Practice in Primary Schools. Announcing the appointments on 3 December 1991, he said their report would be published by the end of January 1992. The time of year, and the choice of three men to write it, inevitably led to its becoming popularly known as the 'Three Wise Men Report'.\n\nRobin Alexander (1941- ) had been educated at the Perse School and the universities of Cambridge, Durham, London and Manchester. He had taught in schools and colleges before becoming Professor of Education at Leeds (1977-95) and Warwick (1995-2001). He went on to hold a variety of posts at Cambridge and York, and became Director of the Cambridge Primary Review in 2006.\n\nJim Rose (1945- ) had trained as a teacher at Kesteven College in Lincolnshire. He had held several primary school posts, including two headships, and had worked on the Nuffield Science Project at Leicester's School of Education. He had joined HMI in 1975, becoming Chief Inspector of Primary Education and then Director of Inspection for Ofsted. He retired in 1999, but was later invited to lead several reviews, including the 'Rose Review' of the Primary Curriculum in 2009 (see chapter18).\n\nChris Woodhead (1946-2015) had attended Wallington County Grammar School in Surrey and read English at Bristol and Keele. After holding a number of teaching posts, he had moved into teacher training, becoming a tutor on the Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) course at Oxford. His later career included administrative posts in Devon, Shropshire and Cornwall; he was chief executive of the National Curriculum Council (NCC) from 1991 to 1993, and of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA) from 1993 to 1994. In 1994 he was appointed head of Ofsted (more on this below).\n\nThe three were asked to review the available evidence about education in primary schools and to 'make recommendations about curriculum organisation, teaching methods and classroom practice appropriate for the successful implementation of the National Curriculum particularly in Key Stage 2' (DES 1992:1).\n\nThe report\n\nCurriculum Organisation and Classroom Practice in Primary Schools: A discussion paper, argued that there was evidence of falling standards in some 'important aspects of literacy and numeracy' (DES 1992:1). The progress of primary pupils had been 'hampered by the influence of highly questionable dogmas' (DES 1992:1); in particular, Piaget's notion of 'learning readiness', as set out in the Plowden Report, had had the effect of 'depressing expectations and discouraging teacher intervention' (DES 1992:18).\n\nTeachers should be instructors rather than facilitators and, while they should employ a range of organisational strategies including individual and group teaching, there should be more use of whole-class teaching.\n\nThere was a place for well-planned topic work, but greater emphasis should be put on the subjects of the National Curriculum. More specialist teaching was needed in the upper years of Key Stage 2, and the initial training, induction and in-service training (INSET) of teachers should take account of these needs, because many primary teachers were not equipped to teach subjects effectively and there was an acute shortage of specialist expertise. There should be greater flexibility in the deployment of staff as specialists, generalists, semi-specialists and generalist-consultants. The authors asked:\n\nCan a generalist reasonably be expected to profess expertise across a curriculum of the scope and complexity of that now required by law at Key Stages 1 and 2? (DES 1992:8).\n\nPupils should be grouped by ability in subjects ('setted') rather than as a whole class ('streamed'), but 'teachers must avoid the pitfall of assuming that pupils' ability is fixed' (DES 1992:27).\n\nThe National Curriculum should be regularly reviewed to ensure that it made appropriate demands on pupils of different ages and abilities and that it was manageable in terms of the time, resources and professional expertise available in schools.\n\nThe authors concluded by expressing the hope that the issues they had raised would be widely debated:\n\nIt goes without saying that all the observations we offer and the changes we recommend have one over-riding purpose: achieving the highest quality of teaching for all the children in our primary schools. Since this purpose is also shared by those who provide for primary education and teachers themselves we are confident that they will readily accept the invitation we now extend to discuss and address these issues (DES 1992:54).\n\nClarke released the text of the report to the press in late January, two weeks before it was due for publication on 5 February.\n\nThis meant that its intended audience (ie all those involved in primary education - teachers, trainers, governors and parents) did not have the opportunity to participate in the debate the report calls for, until after the topic had been fully exposed to media hype and distortion (Thomson 1992:64).\n\nAnd it was from that 'hype and distortion' that Robin Alexander was anxious to dissociate himself, according to The Independent on Sunday (2 February 1992).\n\nReaction\n\nThe Three Wise Men Report caused considerable controversy. Teachers who had been brought up on Plowden regarded it as an attack on their most dearly-cherished values and practices. The two reports shared some things in common, however. Both were products of their age: Plowden, the progressive sixties; Alexander, Rose and Woodhead, the new age of National Curriculum subjects and testing. Both, too, were widely misquoted and misrepresented, often by people who had not read them.\n\nThere were some genuine concerns, however. Liz Thomson, Deputy Principal at Bishop Grosseteste College, had two main criticisms: first, that the authors had omitted 'any real discussion about the relationship between Key Stages 1 and 2', so that 'we are given the distinct impression that the advent of specialist approaches could well result in a two tier approach to primary education' (Thomson 1992:65).\n\nAnd second, that the report lacked a sense of vision. She concluded:\n\nIf we as a profession accept uncritically the statements about primary practice and the recommendations of the 'three wise men', we will lose what is best in primary education through our own sins of omission.\n\nThe best teachers are those who can be described as thinking, researching and innovative practitioners. Their professionalism is evident through the way they reflect, articulate and question their practice. To do this, teachers need to have a vision of what they are aspiring to achieve. Without such vision and their own rationale, teachers will become little more than compliant technicians and operatives. There are few references to any kind of vision for primary education in the report, which in itself is an instrumental response to a prescribed agenda (Thomson 1992:65-6).\n\nHowever, she added, the three wise men should not be criticised too harshly. Their paper had been produced in just seven weeks and, 'unlike the Magi, they did not have a guiding star for illumination' (Thomson 1992:66).\n\nWriting in The Guardian (5 August 2008), Peter Wilby suggested that the three wise men had disagreed on a number of issues:\n\nby all accounts, the 'wise men' of 1991 were split and Rose sat on the sidelines while the two protagonists, Chris Woodhead, later head of Ofsted, and the educational researcher Professor Robin Alexander slugged it out (Wilby 2008).\n\nWhether the publication of the report contributed to the Tories' victory in the 1992 election is open to debate. It was certainly not, as Major and Clarke had hoped, a resounding endorsement of traditionalist views.\n\nTeacher appraisal\n\nThe 1991 Education (School Teacher Appraisal) Regulations (1991 No. 1511) (24 July) required local education authorities (in respect of maintained schools) and governing bodies (of grant-maintained schools) to secure that the performance of teachers was regularly appraised.\n\nDES Circular 12/91 School Teacher Appraisal (24 July) provided local education authorities and schools with guidance on implementing the Regulations.\n\nTeachers' pay and conditions\n\n1991 School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act\n\nThe 1991 School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act (25 July) established a teachers' pay review body, replacing the Interim Advisory Committee on School Teachers' Pay and Conditions, which had been set up in 1987.\n\nThe new body, whose members would be appointed by the Prime Minister, was to\n\nexamine and report on such matters relating to the statutory conditions of employment of school teachers in England and Wales as may from time to time be referred to the review body by the Secretary of State (Section 1(1)).\n\nIt would make recommendations regarding the remuneration of teachers 'and such of their other conditions of employment as relate to their professional duties and working time' (1(2)). The Secretary of State would 'give directions to the review body as to considerations to which they are to have regard and as to the time within which they are to report' (1(4)).\n\nThe Act gave the Secretary of State extensive new powers. He could\n\nmake provision by order giving effect to the recommendations of the review body, with or without modification, or making such other provision with respect to the matters referred to the review body as he thinks fit (2(1)).\n\nIn other words, he could, if he chose to do so, simply ignore the advice of the review body.\n\nGrant-maintained schools would not necessarily have to comply with pay and conditions orders: the Act allowed their governing bodies to apply for exemption (3(1)).\n\nOfsted\n\n1992 Education (Schools) Act\n\nHaving imposed the National Curriculum and its associated testing regime, the government now turned its attention to the third element in its reform of the education system: the inspectorate. From now on, school inspections would be conducted by privatised inspection teams overseen by the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) though, strangely, this was not named in the Act.\n\nThe 1992 Education (Schools) Act (16 March) made provision for the appointment of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools in England (section 1), who would inform and advise the Secretary of State about 'the quality of the education provided by schools' (2) and make an annual report (4). A corresponding appointment would be made for Wales (5).\n\nSection 9 provided for the regular inspection of county, voluntary, special, grant-maintained and independent schools; city technology colleges, city colleges for the technology of the arts; and maintained nursery schools. Inspectors would be required to report on\n\n(a) the quality of the education provided by the school;\n\n(b) the educational standards achieved in the school;\n\n(c) whether the financial resources made available to the school were being managed efficiently; and\n\n(d) the spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils at the school (9(4)).\n\nAll school inspectors would need to be registered (10).\n\nInspection of religious education in voluntary and grant-maintained denominational schools would be conducted by\n\na person chosen by -\n\n(a) the foundation governors, in the case of a controlled school; and\n\n(b) the governing body, in any other case (13).\n\nFaith schools would thus be subject to two complementary inspections: a 'Section 9' inspection (which became Section 11 in the 1996 School Inspections Act) covering the National Curriculum and other matters such as equal opportunities and health and safety, and a 'Section 13' inspection (Section 23 in 1996) covering the religious education under the control of the governors and foundation bodies.\n\nLocal authorities would retain the right to run their own inspection services and could submit tenders for work in other authorities, provided that 'the full cost of providing the service is recovered by way of charges made by the authority to those using the service' (14).\n\nThe Secretary of State could require any governing body of a maintained school, or proprietor of a private school, to provide information (16).\n\nSchedule 2 to the Act set out the arrangements for school inspections:\n\nEvery inspection shall be conducted by a registered inspector with the assistance of a team (an 'inspection team') consisting of persons who are fit and proper persons for carrying out the inspection (Schedule 2 Section 3(1)).\n\nEach inspection team was to include at least one member 'without personal experience in the management of any school or the provision of education in any school' (Schedule 2 Section 3(2)). These became known as 'lay inspectors'.\n\nEvery inspector was required to complete a course of training approved by the Chief Inspector (Schedule 2 section 4); and governing bodies were, if possible, to arrange for parents to meet the inspection team (Schedule 2 section 6).\n\nFollowing an inspection, the registered inspector would be required to submit a report (and a summary of it) to the governors, the local authority (in the case of maintained schools), and the Secretary of State. Copies of the report were to be made available to the public (Schedule 2 section 9).\n\nGoverning bodies were to\n\nprepare a written statement ('the action plan') of the action which they propose to take in the light of [the] report and the period within which they propose to take it (Schedule 2 section 10).\n\nIn the case of a school 'considered to be at risk', the Secretary of State could require that implementation of the school's action plan should be monitored (Schedule 2 section 11).\n\nOfsted came into being on 1 September 1992, with Stewart Sutherland (1941-2018) as the first Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools (HMCI). (Previously, the head of HMI had been known as Senior Chief Inspector.) Sutherland, a Scottish academic and religious philosopher, had been appointed Vice Chancellor of London University in 1990.\n\nThe first round of inspections was due to take place in 1993, as John Patten noted in a House of Commons written answer:\n\nOFSTED - the Office for Standards in Education - opened on 1 September 1992. Her Majesty's chief inspector, Professor Stewart Sutherland, and his staff are now preparing for the first round of second school inspections to start in September 1993 (Hansard House of Commons 20 October 1992 Vol 212 Col 265W).\n\nReaction\n\nKen Jones has argued that Ofsted was 'in one sense the product of two decades of Conservative critiques of state education, but in another it was the very reverse of their ideals' (Jones 2003:115). It carried out 'detailed and often unsympathetic inspections of schools' (Jones 2003:133).\n\nFor Professor Denis Lawton, Director of the London Institute of Education, the 1992 Education (Schools) Act was 'little short of disastrous' because it reduced HMI, which had had 'a distinguished history', to a 'rump' which would act as 'a kind of quality control within Ofsted' (Lawton 2005:110).\n\nThe Labour Party was concerned about the effect of privatising 'a particularly sensitive part of the education service', and about the cost-effectiveness of Ofsted - which did, indeed, prove to be 'extremely expensive' (Lawton 2005:110).\n\nThe establishment of Ofsted did little to raise teachers' morale. They quickly discovered that an inspection involved huge amounts of paperwork and form-filling; they were suspicious of the motives and abilities of some of the private contractors; they found the week of the inspection itself extraordinarily stressful; and they had concerns about the accuracy and fairness of some of the published reports - which was understandable, given that their careers were at stake.\n\nThe style of inspection became more like an inquisition, so much so that teachers began to dread Ofsted visits, not necessarily because they were unsure about their own competence, but because masses of paperwork were required before, during and after an inspection (Lawton 2005:110).\n\nTeachers did manage to find amusement in some aspects of the process, however, such as the inclusion of a 'lay inspector' in every inspection team. The joke in school staffrooms was that to be a lay inspector you had to know nothing about education.\n\nIn September 1994, Stewart Sutherland was replaced as HM Chief Inspector of Schools by Chris Woodhead who, two years earlier, had been one of Kenneth Clarke's 'three wise men' (see above). Woodhead appeared to take a positive delight in criticising teachers and, as a result, became something of a hate figure in schools up and down the country.\n\nTeacher morale deteriorated even further when government ministers began using Ofsted reports as a basis for 'naming and shaming' so-called 'failing' schools.\n\nIn his interview with Brian Sherratt in 1994, Kenneth Clarke explained why the Tories had felt it necessary to create Ofsted. The 'old schools inspectorate' (HMI), he said,\n\ndidn't inspect a lot of the schools at all, except on a very, very infrequent basis. It regarded its most important role as developing ideas on policy of its own and advising ministers about those ideas; so they were keener on their input to ministerial policy than they were on changing anything in the schools themselves. And they didn't report very openly, except in broad-brush terms on matters of general policy all the time. They were very supportive of the schools, and in the main they were very good people. But the independent inspectorate reorientated the whole outfit and gave it a role that fitted the reforms (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:153-4).\n\nClarke's successor as education secretary, John Patten, agreed. He told Brian Sherratt in May 1994 that HMI\n\nwere people who'd achieved some distinction in the teaching profession. They were able to go into classrooms, report on exactly what they saw, and make their assessments on the basis of the nationwide experience they had from going into classrooms across the whole country. They still are. But the cycle of HMI inspections meant that out of 23,000 schools in the system, only 200 a year had a full inspection; at that rate it meant that a secondary school would get inspected once every forty years before Ken's reforms, and a primary school once every two hundred years. Now it's every school, as you know; in striking contrast, it's once every four years (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:183).\n\nFurthermore, HMI reports had focused mostly on 'what teachers were doing rather than on what pupils were achieving - on inputs rather than outputs'; and when the reports were published - as they had been since Keith Joseph 'took that bold decision some ten years ago' - there was 'no way of ensuring that appropriate action was taken' (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:183).\n\nKen Clarke changed all that. He put in place a system which would ensure that all schools were inspected with the rigour of the 200, that the standards schools achieved were set out in full, that they took any action necessary to improve performance, and that the governing body and senior management were accountable (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:183).\n\nFurther and higher education\n\nThe government published two education White Papers in May 1991: the first, Education and Training for the 21st century, dealt with further education; the second, Higher Education: A New Framework, with higher education.\n\nEach had a laudable aim: the first, to 'end the artificial divide between academic and vocational qualifications' (DES 1991a:ii); the second, to abolish the 'binary divide' or 'binary line' - the 'increasingly artificial distinction between universities on the one hand and polytechnics and colleges on the other' (DES 1991b:4).\n\nSome of the White Papers' other aims were contentious, however. The first proposed the removal of colleges from local authority control: LEAs would 'no longer have a role' (DES 1991a:Vol II:39); and both sought to turn further and higher institutions into independent businesses which would have to compete for students and funding.\n\n1991 White Paper: Education and Training for the 21st century\n\nThe White Paper Education and Training for the 21st century was published in two volumes. (References in this section are to Volume I except where otherwise shown.)\n\nIt began by declaring that:\n\nThe school reforms introduced under the Education Reform Act are already strengthening the education system for pupils up to the age of 16. Youth Training has been transformed. We plan to build on these reforms, so that a fully-integrated system of education and training exists which allows steady progression from school through to further and higher education, and to training in work. Our policies will promote continuous learning from the age of 5 through education and throughout working life (DES 1991a:3).\n\nThe government's aims - 'of engaging more young people in education and training, and raising their attainment' - would 'require improvement throughout the system' (DES 1991a:3). It therefore proposed to:\n\nestablish a framework of vocational qualifications that are widely recognised and used, and that are relevant to the needs of the economy;\n\npromote equal esteem for academic and vocational qualifications, and clearer and more accessible paths between them;\n\nextend the range of services offered by school sixth forms and colleges, so that young people face fewer restrictions about what education or training they choose and where they take it up;\n\ngive Training and Enterprise Councils more scope to promote employer influence in education, and mutual support between employers and education;\n\nstimulate more young people to train, through the offer of a training credit;\n\npromote links between schools and employers, to ensure that pupils gain a good understanding of the world of work before they leave school;\n\nensure that all young people get better information and guidance about the choices available to them at 16 and as they progress through further education and training;\n\nprovide opportunities and incentives for young people to reach higher levels of attainment;\n\ngive colleges more freedom to expand their provision and respond more flexibly to the demands of their customers (DES 1991a:3).\n\nIn order to ensure that colleges were 'free to respond to the demand from students and employers for high-quality further education' (DES 1991a:58), the White Paper proposed that sixth-form and further education colleges should be removed from local authority control:\n\nThe Government intends to legislate to remove all colleges of further education, which offer a minimum level of full-time or part-time day release education, from local authority control.\n\nThe Government intends that sixth form colleges should also be removed from local authority control. ... Sixth form colleges will be able to carry on their strong academic traditions. But the change will provide opportunities for them to extend the vocational education they offer and to attract wider client groups. We expect many of them to seize those opportunities (DES 1991a:58-9).\n\nFrom 1 April 1993, colleges would be funded directly by the government, through new Councils to be 'appointed by and responsible to the Secretaries of State for Education and Science and for Wales' (DES 1991a:59).\n\nA new funding regime would be 'designed to provide a powerful incentive to recruit additional students and reduce unit costs. ... There are great opportunities for increased participation and efficiency gains' (DES 1991a:59). Although it was not spelt out in the White Paper, it was clear that the government expected the colleges to compete for students: they would be 'free to respond to their customers' and would thus be encouraged to be 'efficient' and 'effective' (DES 1991a:64).\n\nThe colleges would work closely with the Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs), which already had specific responsibilities for work-related further education.\n\nOver the following decade, the government's policies would create\n\na modern system of academic and vocational qualifications, both of a high standard and both highly valued, which offer ladders of opportunity right through from school to work and throughout working life [and]\n\na real partnership between education and business, so that both can work together to create a learning environment at the transition from school to work, and to make what is taught at school more relevant to the world of work (DES 1991a:64).\n\nThe government attached great importance to systems which would ensure the quality of education and training provided by the colleges. Of the three existing levels of quality assurance - the colleges themselves, the examining and validating bodies, and the external assessors - the roles of the first two would be 'unchanged by the new arrangements' (DES 1991a:Vol II:38); but the new funding Councils would have responsibility for:\n\na) ensuring that quality systems in general form a satisfactory basis for the funding being provided: responsibility for quality flows from responsibility for finance; and\n\nb) making specific financial allocation decisions which should be informed by quality judgements (DES 1991a:Vol II:39).\n\nPresenting the White Paper (and that on higher education) to the House of Commons on 20 May 1991, Kenneth Clarke said:\n\nThe White Paper sets out in detail the Government's proposals for further education colleges and sixth-form colleges. As I announced to the House on 21 March, we intend that those colleges will become autonomous institutions outside local authority control.\n\nThe colleges will be funded by national Further Education Councils in England and in Wales. They will receive each year a core budget plus additional funds according to the actual number of students enrolled. In that way they will have a powerful incentive to recruit and retain additional students, both young people and adults. The councils will not manage the colleges. They will follow the model of the funding council that has so successfully steered the remarkable growth of the polytechnics after we freed them from the control of local government (Hansard House of Commons 20 May 1991 Vol 191 Col 639).\n\nLabour's shadow education secretary, Jack Straw, replied:\n\nThe Secretary of State has just confirmed the removal from local control of the 557 further education, tertiary and sixth-form colleges of England and Wales and their enforced transfer to centralised control from Whitehall. Is the Secretary of State aware of the enormous opposition that those plans have aroused within his own party? What is his response to the views of many local authority Conservative leaders, including Mr. Tim MacNamara, the leader of Hampshire county council, who said on Friday that the Secretary of State was hell bent on destroying local education authorities without any idea of what to put in its place'; who complained of the Secretary of State's 'government by denigration', and who said these changes were blighting all planning of 16 to 19 education? Was not the same Mr. MacNamara correct to accuse the Secretary of State of acting 'for wholly doctrinal reasons'? ...\n\nIs the Secretary of State aware that only three years ago, by section 120 of the Education Reform Act 1988, the Government imposed new duties on local education authorities in respect of further education? Ministers then expressed 'great confidence that local authorities will fulfil their duty to promote further education'. They spoke of the need for strategic planning for further education by LEAs. What has happened since then to justify these changes? With 60 per cent of 16-plus provision transferred to central control, leaving 40 per cent in local authority sixth forms, who will now plan the system - or is it all to be left to some kind of bogus market? (Hansard House of Commons 20 May 1991 Vol 191 Cols 641-2).\n\nThe White Paper was 'generally considered to be unsatisfactory' (Lawton 2005:109), The Independent (21 May 1991) describing it as a 'Timid Tory Plan for Training'. The Labour Party favoured a more radical solution involving a broader curriculum, while the left-leaning think-tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research (lPPR), recommended the creation of a British baccalaureate.\n\n1991 White Paper: Higher education: A new framework\n\nIn his Foreword to Higher Education: A New Framework, Prime Minister John Major wrote:\n\nIn higher education, our key reform will be to end the increasingly artificial distinction between universities on the one hand and polytechnics and colleges on the other. This will build on our plans to transform education and training for 16-19 year olds by removing the barriers between the academic and vocational streams (DES 1991b:4).\n\nThe White Paper announced 'changes in the five main areas which currently seal the binary line in place', namely:\n\nfunding for teaching;\n\nfunding for research;\n\ndegree awarding powers and quality assurance;\n\ninstitutional titles and governance; and\n\npay and conditions (DES 1991b:7).\n\nThe government believed that\n\nit is in the interests of universities, polytechnics and colleges to continue to look for increased levels of funding from private sources in particular from industry and commerce, from benefactors and alumni, and from present sources of fee income. Such private income can enhance considerably the independence of individual institutions. The Government accepts that public funds will remain the main source of income for funding the projected expansion of student numbers (DES 1991b:10).\n\nThe existing 'separate channels' for the funding of teaching in universities on the one hand and polytechnics and colleges on the other would hinder efficient further expansion of higher education provision. The government therefore proposed to introduce 'a single funding structure for teaching in universities, polytechnics and colleges' (DES 1991b:14).\n\nWith regard to the funding of research, the White Paper set out the following principles:\n\nPlurality: there should be two channels of public research:\n\ngeneral funds, to be used at institutions' discretion; and\n\nfunds tied to specific projects.\n\nCompetition: to promote further the most effective use of resources within higher education, all institutions should be able to compete for research funds.\n\nSelectivity: research funds should be distributed selectively, as now, on the basis of assessment of research quality. This will continue to reward quality, encourage innovation and make the best use of resources.\n\nAccountability: the principle of accountability must apply to higher education institutions receiving general research funding, in the same way as for other bodies receiving substantial public funds. The Government is determined to ensure greater transparency in the planning and use of general research funds, as well as clearer funding arrangements for Research Council projects (DES 1991b:18-19).\n\nA new framework for higher education was needed because 'The binary line underpins the current territorial responsibilities within Government for funding higher education'. Its abolition therefore required 'a fresh settlement of those responsibilities' (DES 1991b:21).\n\nArguments for 'complete coherence' pointed in favour of 'one single Funding Council operating across Great Britain or the United Kingdom as a whole' (DES 1991b:21). However, the government intended to introduce separate Funding Councils for higher education in England, Scotland and Wales.\n\nTo ensure fair competition across territorial boundaries, the funding allocations by each territorial Secretary of State to the relevant body will be informed by the Government's general policy on higher education. Subject to that, funding will take account of each particular set of territorial circumstances, such as the different structure and duration of degree courses in Scotland (DES 1991b:22)\n\nThe Open University would, for funding purposes, be 'brought within the ambit of the new Funding Council for England' but would 'retain its general UK mission' (DES 1991b:23).\n\nWith regard to the quality of teaching and learning, there was a need for 'proper accountability for the substantial public funds invested in higher education'; and students and employers needed 'improved information about quality' if the full benefit of 'increased competition' was to be obtained (DES 1991b:24).\n\nThe White Paper listed five 'aspects of quality assurance in higher education':\n\nQuality control: mechanisms within institutions for maintaining and enhancing the quality of their provision.\n\nQuality audit: external scrutiny aimed at providing guarantees that institutions have suitable quality control mechanisms in place.\n\nValidation: approval of courses by a validating body for the award of its degrees and other qualifications.\n\nAccreditation: in the specific context of the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA), delegation to institutions, subject to certain conditions, of responsibility for validating their own courses leading to CNAA degrees.\n\nQuality assessment: external review of, and judgements about, the quality of teaching and learning in institutions (DES 1991b:24).\n\nIn a chapter on Institutional titles and governance, the White Paper proposed 'allowing polytechnics, if they wish, to adopt a university name or to include it in their titles'. Any such name changes 'would require approval by the Privy Council to ensure consistency in approach and no duplication' (DES 1991b:32).\n\nFinally, with regard to pay and conditions of service, employers in higher education would be expected 'to settle their own negotiating arrangements' in the light of the White Paper's proposals. The government would 'continue to influence pay and conditions of service through the level of funding provided for the new Higher Education Funding Councils' (DES 1991b:35).\n\nCommenting on the White Paper in his 1994 interview with Brian Sherratt, Clarke said\n\nwhat seemed to me mad was to have two totally different systems of distributing money, and relationships with the Department, with bodies all of whom would have been called a university in other countries in the world. ... I thought we could devise for the lot of them parity of esteem, parity of status, and a system which was a fairer way of distributing the money for teaching and research, and would encourage and bring the best out of all of them (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:158-9).\n\n1992 Further and Higher Education Act\n\nProposals from both these White Papers were incorporated into the 1992 Further and Higher Education Act (6 March); the 1992 Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act (16 March) provided for similar arrangements in Scotland.\n\nPart I of the Act, dealing with further education, provided for the establishment of Further Education Funding Councils (FEFCs) (Section 1); and removed further education and sixth form colleges from local authority control (11).\n\nFor Benn and Chitty, the removal of the local authorities from the further education sector was a damaging development. The colleges - now 'further education corporations' - would be subjected to 'quango-funding and control through a privatised market' (Benn and Chitty 1996:14).\n\nFurthermore, local authorities would no longer be able to develop strategic plans:\n\nthere were to be no local systems, only individual education 'businesses' competing with one another for 'customers' within the centrally controlled legislative framework (Benn and Chitty 1996:14).\n\nPart II of the Act dealt with higher education. It ended the 'binary divide' between the universities and other providers - the colleges and polytechnics - by making them all 'higher education corporations', funded by new Higher Education Funding Councils (HEFCs) (62), which replaced the Universities Funding Council and the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council (63). It also abolished the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) (80).\n\nFollowing the Act, the polytechnics and the Scottish central institutions all became universities, almost doubling the number of universities in the UK.\n\nIn 1993 the larger colleges of the University of London effectively became independent universities when they were granted direct access to government funding and the right to confer degrees; the constituent institutions of the University of Wales were later given the same rights.\n\n1992 General election\n\nConservative manifesto\n\nIn its section on 'Schools, Pupils and Parents', the Conservative manifesto for the 1992 election, The Best Future for Britain, stressed the importance of choice and diversity and promised a 'Parent's Charter':\n\nUnder the Parent's Charter, all schools will have to provide at least one written report on the progress of each child each year. Information on the performance of all local schools will be given to parents, enabling them to exercise choice more effectively.\n\nWe believe all parents have the right to choice in education - not only those who can afford school fees. Young people differ in their interests and aptitudes, and we need a range of schools to offer them the best opportunities. We have always fought to maintain diversity in education, protecting the right of local people to preserve their grammar schools, and defending independent schools against mindless Labour attacks. And we have always valued the important contribution made by the churches to our children's education.\n\nIt promised the completion of the ten-subject National Curriculum; 'regular and straightforward tests' for all 7-, 11- and 14-year-olds by 1994; the creation of more nursery places; and the publication of 'full information ... about the performance of all local schools in each area'.\n\nPopular schools which were over-subscribed would be 'given the resources to expand'; and grant-maintained schools would be able to 'change their character'. The Assisted Places scheme would continue to give 'access to independent education to many families who could not otherwise afford it'. The 'partnership between the state and the churches in education' would be strengthened.\n\nThe Tories promised to 'reinforce the professionalism of teachers and the esteem in which they are held'. There would be 'regular appraisal of teachers', and 'reform of the teacher training system to make it more effective in developing classroom skills'.\n\nSixteen-year-olds would be 'free to choose between college, work-based training and sixth form studies'. The 'well-respected A-level examinations' would be defended; and there would be improvements in vocational education, including a new General National Vocational Qualification (GNVQ).\n\nA Conservative government would 'continue to expand the number of students in higher education' and abolish 'the artificial \"binary line\" between universities and polytechnics'. (This had already been legislated for by the time of the election.) The introduction of student loans had given students '30 per cent more money for their living costs than the former system of grants alone', and the government would 'continue to provide generous support for students and to expand our student loans commitment'.\n\nFinally, the 'training revolution' which the Tories had initiated would continue 'to create a framework within which men and women of all ages can develop skills, gain qualifications and shape their own futures'.\n\nLabour manifesto\n\nMeanwhile, the Labour manifesto, It's time to get Britain working again, included a section on 'Raising standards in our schools'. It declared that:\n\nGood education is the best investment in Britain's future. All girls and boys, from every background, must be able to discover their talents and fulfil their potential.\n\nWe want every child to get qualifications that count. We need safe, disciplined schools, where professional teachers work closely with parents. Learning must become a lifetime opportunity, with new chances to update skills at work.\n\nThat is our vision of a well-educated Britain.\n\nThe manifesto noted that 'Britain today invests a smaller share of our national wealth in education than in 1979', and that 'more and more parents are now being forced to pay for essentials in a system which should be free'. Labour would provide an additional £600m for education over two years and then 'continue steadily to increase the share of Britain's national wealth invested in education'. There would be more nursery places and a nationwide childcare strategy. Education standards would be raised through 'better teaching, smaller classes and modern books and equipment'.\n\nWithin 12 months, we will end the scandal of primary school classes of over 40 children. We will then establish and steadily reduce maximum limits on class sizes, until no primary school child is taught in a class of more than 30.\n\nIncreased funding would be provided for class and library books, equipment and laboratories. 'We will start to tackle the backlog of school repairs. For instance, we will invest £30 million to ensure that within 12 months, no child has to use an outside lavatory'.\n\nTeachers would be 'guaranteed a proper salary and career structure'. A General Teaching Council for England and Wales would be created to raise professional standards; there would be 'higher quality training' and better support for newly-qualified teachers.\n\nA national Reading Standards Programme would be established, with a Reading Recovery Programme 'to help those in difficulty'. There would be better provision for children with 'special needs or special abilities'.\n\nWith regard to selection, the manifesto said:\n\nNine out of ten secondary school children are in comprehensive schools. We will end selection at 11 where it still exists. We will introduce a fairer system for all school reorganisations, with independent public enquiries. We will phase out the Assisted Places scheme (without affecting pupils currently on a place, or offered one from September 1992) and redirect the savings to meet wider educational needs.\n\nInstead of the Conservatives' privatised schools inspectorate, there would be an Education Standards Commission which, together with HMI, would 'monitor the performance of every school'.\n\nAll schools would be 'free to manage their day-to-day budgets'; local education authorities would be given 'a new strategic role'; grant-maintained schools would be 'freed from central government control'; and they, and the city technology colleges, would be brought into 'the mainstream of the local school system'.\n\nAn unexpected outcome\n\nAlthough opinion polls had predicted a narrow Labour victory, the Conservatives won the general election on 9 April 1992 with a Commons majority of 21. Some political commentators suggested that Labour's defeat was a result of the party's commitment to raising income tax; others argued that it was due to Neil Kinnock's poor judgement in staging, on the eve of the election, a triumphalist rally in Sheffield which many found distasteful.\n\nTeachers who had hoped for a more constructive, less confrontational, approach to education were profoundly disappointed.\n\nFollowing the election, the Department of Education and Science (DES) was renamed the Department for Education (DFE) and John Patten was appointed Secretary of State for Education.\n\n1992-1994: John Patten\n\nJohn Patten\n\nIn a profile of John Patten (pictured), The Independent (13 February 1993) described his family as 'earnest, tight-knit, happy, though materially impoverished'. His father was a gardener; his mother a devout Roman Catholic from the Czech minority in Austria.\n\nBrought up as a Catholic, Patten attended the Jesuit-run Wimbledon College and then read geography at Sidney Sussex College Cambridge. He taught at Oxford (1969-1979), becoming Fellow and Tutor at Hertford College in 1972.\n\nHe entered Parliament as MP for the City of Oxford in 1979, moving to Oxford West and Abingdon in 1983 following boundary changes. He held a number of junior ministerial posts at the Northern Ireland Office and in the Ministry of Health, served as Minister of State for Housing, Urban Affairs and Construction (1985-87) and then became Minister of State at the Home Office.\n\nHis appointment as secretary of the renamed Department for Education (DFE) in April 1992 was 'unexpected' (The Independent 13 February 1993). He was to preside over\n\na further hectic and paradoxical period of educational change, which led both to the eclipse of 1980s Conservatism, and to the consolidation of its achievements; to a new rise in opposition to its policies, and to their acceptance as the basis of further change (Jones 2003:140).\n\nHe held controversial views on religion, believing, for example, that children should be taught about hell because an absence of fear resulted in criminality and bad behaviour in schools; and he had no time for progressive ideas in education:\n\nHe is convinced that modern educational theories have damaged the chances of people from poor backgrounds and is obsessive in his dislike of those he holds responsible (The Independent 13 February 1993).\n\nLike Margaret Thatcher, he seemed to regard teachers and educationists as the enemy.\n\nHis skirmishing with the profession over the policies he inherited - encouraging schools to opt out of local authority control, league-tabling schools by exam results, testing the national curriculum - has been predictable (The Independent 13 February 1993).\n\nHe avoided meetings with the teacher unions and was reluctant to address their conferences. He refused high-profile television interviews because 'he lacks self-confidence and has no great grasp of the detail of what has suddenly become his field' (The Independent 13 February 1993).\n\nHe was arrogant and tactless: he described representatives of the National Association of Parent-Teacher Associations as 'neanderthals' (The Independent 13 February 1993); and, three weeks after becoming education secretary, he launched an extraordinary attack on Birmingham's Chief Education Officer, Tim Brighouse, telling a party conference fringe meeting: 'I fear for Birmingham, with this madman let loose, wandering the streets, frightening the children.' Brighouse sued, and won a substantial out-of-court settlement, which he donated to educational charities (The Guardian 24 April 2007).\n\nPatten became a life peer following the 1997 general election.\n\n'Selection' becomes 'specialisation'\n\nPatten was as keen as John Major to undermine the comprehensive system, but he realised that public support for comprehensive schools was a problem - one which even Thatcher had been unable to solve. There had been widespread parental opposition to the reintroduction of selection in the wake of the 1979 Education Act; the number of schools choosing to adopt grant-maintained (GM) status had been disappointing; and few firms had agreed to sponsor city technology colleges: the fifteenth and last of these - Kingswood City Technology College in Bristol - had been given approval in April 1991.\n\nA new strategy was needed. Patten's solution was to convert 'selection' into 'specialisation'. In an article in the New Statesman and Society (17 July 1992), he argued that:\n\nSelection is not, and should not be, a great issue of the 1990s as it was in the 1960s. The S-word for all Socialists to come to terms with is, rather, 'specialisation'. The fact is that children excel at different things; it is foolish to ignore it, and some schools may wish specifically to cater for these differences. ...\n\nSuch schools are already emerging. They will, as much more than mere exotic educational boutiques, increasingly populate the educational landscape of Britain at the end of the century, a century that introduced universal education at its outset; then tried to grade children like vegetables; then tried to treat them ... like identical vegetables; and which never ever gave them the equality of intellectual nourishment that is now being offered by the National Curriculum, encouraged by testing, audited by regular inspection. (Patten 1992:20-21 quoted in Chitty and Dunford 1999:27)\n\nCritics, however, warned that giving parents the choice of a diverse range of schools would ultimately result in selection of pupils by the schools themselves.\n\n1992 White Paper: Choice and Diversity\n\nPatten ignored the critics and described his White Paper, Choice and Diversity: A new framework for schools, published in July, as a 'landmark' which would decide the shape of schooling for the next quarter century.\n\nThe government believed that school autonomy and parental choice, combined with the National Curriculum, were together 'the keys to achieving higher standards in all schools' (DFE 1992:15). A single new body, the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA), would replace the National Curriculum Council (NCC) and the School Examinations and Assessment Council (SEAC).\n\nA Funding Agency for Schools would be created as part of 'the evolution of a new organisational framework for the education service' (DFE 1992:19). As more schools became grant-maintained, the Funding Agency would take over the responsibilities of local education authorities (LEAs).\n\nSchool admission arrangements - to be 'exercised increasingly at the school level' - would be designed to 'secure the maximum parental choice possible' (DFE 1992:28). Grant-maintained schools and LEAs would be encouraged to cooperate on admissions, but the Secretary of State would be able to impose common procedures if necessary.\n\nLEAs would be required to increase delegation to their schools under their schemes of local management, and would be able to 'supply support services to GM schools on competitive terms' (DFE 1992:31). The government would 'maintain and strengthen the partnership between the state and the Churches and other voluntary bodies in both LEA maintained and GM schools' (DFE 1992:31).\n\nChapter 8 of the White Paper was devoted to spiritual and moral development. The government would\n\ncontinue to emphasise the importance of the school's role in promoting pupils' spiritual and moral development through its teaching and pastoral care (DFE 1992:37)\n\nLEAs would be required to review agreed syllabuses for religious education if they had not already done so; grant-maintained schools would be able to use 'any agreed syllabus adopted since the Education Reform Act 1988'; and there would be changes in the constitutions of agreed syllabus conferences and SACREs 'once 75% of either primary or secondary pupils in the LEA are in GM schools' (DFE 1992:37).\n\nWith regard to pupils with special educational needs, the White Paper declared that they should be educated in ordinary schools 'to the maximum extent possible' (DFE 1992:40).\n\nThe government wished to see 'much greater diversity and specialisation by schools, particularly in technology, while still ensuring that the full National Curriculum is offered to all pupils'. The 'developing network of specialist Technology Schools, with CTCs at its centre', would be extended through the Technology Schools Initiative (DFE 1992:43).\n\nA separate chapter dealt with implementation of these proposals in Wales.\n\nMost of the White Paper, however, was devoted to strategies to persuade more schools to opt out of local authority control and become grant-maintained. It claimed that there had been 'rapid and successful growth in the number of grant-maintained schools' (DFE 1992:19). In fact, in the four years following the 1988 Education Reform Act, there had been just 428 decisive 'opt-out' ballots in England and Wales, of which 331 were in favour (Chitty 2009a:56). In Scotland, only one school had chosen to become grant-maintained (Fisher 1993a:24).\n\nThe government therefore proposed a series of measures which it clearly hoped would increase the number of grant-maintained schools:\n\nthere would be no need for a second resolution of the governing body before a school held a parental ballot on GM status (DFE 1992:33);\n\na school applying for GM status would be able 'simultaneously to propose a significant change in its character or size' (DFE 1992:33);\n\nthe Education Assets Board would have 'strengthened powers to settle disputes between governing bodies and LEAs in order to speed up the transfer of assets to an approved GM school' (DFE 1992:33);\n\nthere would be stronger measures 'to prevent LEAs removing assets from schools approved for GM status' (DFE 1992:33);\n\nspecial schools would be allowed to apply for GM status (DFE 1992:40);\n\n'failing schools' would be taken over by an Education Association and, once they had achieved 'a satisfactory level of performance', they would 'be considered for GM status' (DFE 1992:48);\n\nsmall primary schools, particularly in rural areas, would be able to opt together for GM status as a group of schools or 'cluster' (DFE 1992:52); and\n\nthe government would consult on the introduction of a 'new and simpler method of calculating grant to GM schools' (DFE 1992:55).\n\nThe White Paper ended with a summary of what Patten hoped it would achieve: 'a great transformation in education which will take at least a decade to work through' (DFE 1992:64).\n\nThe education system of the 21st century will be neither divisive nor based on some lowest common denominator. Diversity, choice and excellence will be its hallmarks, with each child having an opportunity to realise his or her full potential, liberating and developing his or her talents.\n\nThis is the Government's vision for education in this country. This White Paper is another important step towards its realisation (DFE 1992:64).\n\nTo many, however, the White Paper appeared to be based on the educational theories of the 1930s. The Spens Report (1938), for example, had argued that, on the basis of intelligence and aptitude, children could be divided into three groups - the academic, the practical, and the rest - and that, if justice were to be done to 'their varying capacities', they required 'types of education varying in certain important respects' (Spens 1938:125).\n\nSimilarly, the White Paper declared that\n\nUniformity in educational provision presupposes that children are all basically the same and that local communities have essentially the same educational needs. The reality is that children have different needs. The provision of education should be geared more to local circumstances and individual needs: hence our commitment to diversity in education (DFE 1992:3-4).\n\nCritics argued that the White Paper could more appropriately have been titled 'Chaos and Perversity'. Its central policy - that of 'diverting more money away from LEAs into schools which were encouraged to become more and more market oriented' - was criticised\n\nnot only by Labour, but by the press and even by moderate Conservatives for over-emphasising choice, especially in the form of grant maintained schools that were free from local authority interference (Lawton 2005:110).\n\nAnn Taylor, the newly-appointed shadow education secretary, objected to the White Paper's punitive approach to school improvement (Lawton 2005:111).\n\nIn Don't sell pupils short, an article for the Roman Catholic paper The Tablet (10 October 1992), Patten explained that he had devoted a whole chapter of his White Paper to 'Spiritual and Moral Development' because he believed that 'schools must not be value-free zones' (quoted in Tombs 1994:86).\n\nSix months later, the National Curriculum Council published its contribution to the debate about national morality and the part schools could play in developing it. Spiritual and Moral Development a discussion paper (April 1993) argued that 'Schools should be expected to uphold those values which contain moral absolutes' (NCC 1993:4) and it listed these as:\n\ntelling the truth;\n\nkeeping promises;\n\nrespecting the rights and property of others;\n\nacting considerately towards others;\n\nhelping those less fortunate and weaker than ourselves;\n\ntaking personal responsibility for one's actions;\n\nself-discipline (NCC 1993:4).\n\n1993 Education Act\n\nThe White Paper's proposals formed the basis of the 1993 Education Act (27 July). Published in two volumes totalling 290 pages containing 308 sections, it was the largest piece of legislation in the history of education.\n\nIts first five parts covered:\n\nI Responsibility for education\n\nroles of the secretary of state and funding authorities (Sections 1-11);\n\nnew rules about school places, admissions and religious education (12-21).\n\nII Grant-maintained schools\n\nmeasures to make it easier for schools to become grant-maintained (22-37);\n\nmeasures regarding property, staff and contracts (38-47);\n\nestablishing new GM schools (48-54);\n\nthe government of GM schools (55-80);\n\nfunding of GM schools (81-95);\n\nchange of character of GM schools (96-103);\n\nclosure of GM schools (104-116);\n\ngroups of GM schools (117-127);\n\nfurther education in GM schools (128);\n\nprovision of benefits and services by local education authority (129);\n\nother matters, including religious education, admissions (130-155).\n\nIII Children with special educational needs\n\nlegal definition (156);\n\nCode of Practice (157-158);\n\nduty of provision (159-164);\n\nidentification and assessment procedures (165-176);\n\nspecial needs tribunals (177-181);\n\nspecial schools and independent schools (182-190).\n\nIV School attendance\n\nschool attendance orders (192-197);\n\noffences and supervision orders (198-202);\n\nexemption (203).\n\nV Schools failing to give an acceptable standard of education\n\nextension of the Education (Schools) Act 1992 (204);\n\ninspections and reports (205-209);\n\nspecial measures (210-212);\n\nnew powers and restrictions (213-217);\n\neducation associations (218-228).\n\nPart VI Miscellaneous covered a huge range of matters:\n\nestablishment of new schools by local authorities and other 'promoters' (229-230);\n\nnursery education in GM schools (231);\n\nrationalisation of school places (232-237);\n\nincorporation of governing bodies (238-239);\n\nthe right of parents to withdraw a child from sex education lessons except those contained in the National Curriculum (240-243) (see Issues arising below);\n\nabolition of the National Curriculum Council (NCC) and the School Examinations and Assessment Council (SEAC) and their replacement by the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA) (244-248);\n\nCurriculum Council for Wales (249-253);\n\nreview of agreed syllabuses for religious education (254-258) (see Issues arising below);\n\ninspection of religious education and collective worship (259) (see Issues arising below);\n\nadmissions and exclusions (260-262);\n\nprovision of information about city technology colleges (263-265);\n\nadmission appeals committees (266-270);\n\nsponsor governors for aided secondary schools (271);\n\nproposals for alteration of schools eligible for GM status (272-273);\n\nrevision of local management funding schemes (274-276);\n\nclarification of the period of compulsory schooling (277);\n\neducation support grants (278-279);\n\ncharges for musical instrument tuition (280);\n\nassistance for voluntary schools (281-286);\n\nendowments in voluntary and GM schools (287-288);\n\nindependent schools (employment of teachers, corporal punishment not to be 'inhuman or degrading') (290-294);\n\nprovision of goods and services to GM schools by LEAs (295);\n\nabolition of the requirement for LEAs to have education committees (296-297);\n\nsupplementary matters (298-308).\n\nIssues arising from the Act\n\nThe local authorities\n\nIn the second of his interviews with Brian Sherratt (on 6 June 1994), Patten was asked how he saw the future role of local education authorities, given that the 1993 Act provided for the Funding Agency for Schools (FAS) to take over many of their responsibilities as the number of grant-maintained schools increased. He replied that, in some local authority areas,\n\nthe FAS will be in total charge because more than 75 per cent of the places in the secondary sector are grant-maintained; so in those areas the LEA has a more residual role. No one has to have an LEA, a Local Education Authority, any more after the 1993 Act. I think in one or two areas they're looking at putting some of the functions of the LEA together with some of the functions of the Social Services Department and, where there are Housing Authorities, Housing as well, with a kind of all-singing, all-dancing service providing a sort of role (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:192-3).\n\nSex education\n\nIn 1991, the National Curriculum Science Orders had been revised to include teaching at Key Stage 3 about HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and AIDS (Acquired Immunity Deficiency Syndrome), which had become a major public health issue during the 1980s.\n\nHowever, Patten and his deputy, Emily (Baroness) Blatch (1937-2005), seem to have been 'profoundly influenced' (Chitty 1994a:17) by campaigns led by the pressure group Christian Action Research and Education and the fundamentalist Plymouth Brethren sect. Both groups called for a ban on compulsory sex education in schools and the removal of all mention of HIV/AIDS from the National Curriculum.\n\nThe result was Section 241 of the 1993 Education Act, which\n\nremoved everything except the biology of reproduction from National Curriculum Science: there was to be nothing about HIV/AIDS or any other sexually transmitted disease;\n\ngave parents the right to withdraw their children from 'compulsory' sex education lessons; and\n\ntook away from the governors of secondary schools the power to decide whether or not the school would provide sex education.\n\nIn a letter to The Times (17 July 1993), Valerie Riches, director of the right-wing pressure group Family and Youth Concern, supported the changes:\n\nThe right to withdraw children from lessons must be maintained until the sex education lobby shows itself both willing and capable of promoting responsible attitudes towards sexual behaviour, marriage and family life (quoted in Chitty 1994a:17).\n\nThe National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the children's charity Kidscape disagreed. NSPCC policy officer Eileen Hayes warned:\n\nthere is a potential danger that if parents were abusing a child and had the right to remove it from sex education lessons for whatever reason, it might be an advantage to keep that child in ignorance ...\n\nWe feel that if children have some rudimentary sex education and information about their bodies, they are in some way protected against abuse. Otherwise they may be too ignorant to realise what is going on (The Times Educational Supplement 16 July 1993 quoted in Chitty 1994a:17).\n\nRight-wing attitudes to sex education were not shared by the vast majority of parents. A survey conducted by the Health Education Authority, reported in The Times Educational Supplement (4 November 1994), found that 94 per cent of parents supported sex education in schools, with 80 per cent in favour of schools teaching about HIV and AIDS. Only one per cent of parents intended to withdraw their children from the lessons. There seemed to be 'general confidence in the role of teachers in the whole area of sex education', though this view was 'not shared by a quarter of Muslim parents and 17 per cent of Hindus' (Chitty 1995:19).\n\nIn 1987, DES Circular 11/87, Sex education at school, had said:\n\nThe Secretary of State considers that the aims of a programme of sex education should be to present facts in an objective and balanced manner so as to enable pupils to comprehend the range of sexual attitudes and behaviour in present day society; to know what is and is not legal; to consider their own attitudes, and to make informed, reasoned and responsible decisions about the attitudes they will adopt both while they are at school and in adulthood (DES 1987b:4).\n\nThis paragraph, argues Chitty, 'clearly had the hand of HMI on it' (Chitty 1995:19).\n\nOn 6 May 1994, Patten issued Circular 5/94, Education Act 1993: Sex Education in Schools, which set out a 'moral framework for sex education':\n\nThe Secretary of State recognises that sex education ... should lead to the acquisition of understanding and attitudes which prepare pupils to view their relationships in a responsible and healthy manner. It must not be value-free; it should also be tailored not only to the age but also to the understanding of pupils. ... schools' programmes of sex education should therefore aim to present facts in an objective, balanced and sensitive manner, set within a clear framework of values and an awareness of the law on sexual behaviour. Pupils should accordingly be encouraged to appreciate the value of stable family life, marriage and the responsibilities of parenthood. They should be helped to consider the importance of self-restraint, dignity, respect for themselves and others, acceptance of responsibility, sensitivity towards the needs and views of others, loyalty and fidelity. And they should be enabled to recognise the physical, emotional and moral implications, and risks, of certain types of behaviour, and to accept that both sexes must behave responsibly in sexual matters. Teachers need to acknowledge that many children come from backgrounds that do not reflect such values or experiences. Sensitivity is therefore needed to avoid causing hurt and offence to them and their families; and to allow such children to feel a sense of worth. But teachers should also help pupils, whatever their circumstances, to raise their sights (DFE 1994b:6).\n\nRachel Thomson, Information Development Officer of the Sex Education Forum, argued that the problem with sex education in Britain was that it had become totally politicised. 'People on the political Right see sex education as an opportunity for social engineering', she told The Observer (7 November 1993). 'They are worried about recent changes in sexual behaviour and see sex education as a chance to turn the clock back' (quoted in Chitty 1995:20).\n\nFor Clyde Chitty, it was\n\na source of much regret that the Government should have made such an unholy mess of giving schools and teachers sound advice on the all-important area of sex education. This is surely a part of the curriculum where young people should be encouraged to talk freely about values, emotions and relationships. The price of pupil ignorance is the very state of affairs that the Government claims to want to change (Chitty 1995:20).\n\nReligious education\n\nThe new provisions relating to religious education and collective worship were set out in Sections 254-259 of the 1993 Education Act and explained in Circular 1/94 Religious Education and Collective Worship, published by the Department for Education on 31 January 1994.\n\nAn unusually long and detailed Circular (63 pages), it set out the legal responsibilities of head teachers, governors, local authorities, SACREs, agreed syllabus conferences, teachers, and teacher trainers in the light of the 1993 Act.\n\nThe Circular said:\n\nEvery school must by law provide religious education and daily collective worship for all its pupils, with the exception of those pupils who are withdrawn from these activities by their parents. It is a matter of deep concern that in many schools these activities do not take place with the frequency required or to the standard which pupils deserve. The Government's aim is therefore to improve the quality of the religious education curriculum for pupils in order to ensure that they have the best possible opportunity to develop through this area of the curriculum (DFE 1994a:9).\n\nAt the same time, the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA), which had replaced the National Curriculum Council, issued guidance for Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education (SACREs) in the form of National Model Syllabuses for RE. On the day these were published, the London Evening Standard welcomed the increasing focus on Christianity as part of the government's social agenda:\n\nMinisters believe the move will underscore the need to restore traditional family values and help reduce the number of schoolchildren involved in crime (Evening Standard 25 January 1994).\n\nWriting in Forum (Autumn 1994), David Tombs, lecturer in Theology and Religious Studies at Roehampton Institute, argued that\n\nNew Right social interests continue to underpin the government's attempts to influence and control religious education. Two concerns may be identified in the development of government attitudes to religious education. First, pressure for religious education to be predominantly Christian; second, emphasis on moral instruction in Christian values. These developments can only be fully understood when the New Right ideological agenda behind them is recognised (Tombs 1994:85).\n\nDespite the White Paper's title Choice and Diversity, the clear impression was that 'in government eyes moral education [is] concerned with authority and conformity far more than personal choice and cultural diversity' (Tombs 1994:86).\n\nNational Commission on Education\n\nIn his presidential address to the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in August 1990, Sir Claus Moser (1922-2015) (pictured), Warden of Wadham College Oxford and Chancellor of Keele University, called on the government to set up a Royal Commission on education.\n\nWhen the government refused, Moser set up the independent National Commission on Education (NCE), funded by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation and chaired by Lord Walton of Detchant.\n\nThe Commission's final report, Learning to succeed: a radical look at education today and a strategy for the future, published in 1993, listed seven main goals:\n\nhigh-quality nursery education must be available for all 3- and 4-year-olds;\n\nthere must be courses and qualifications that bring out the best in every pupil;\n\nevery pupil in every lesson has the right to good teaching and adequate support facilities;\n\neveryone must be entitled to learn throughout life and be encouraged in practice to do so;\n\nthe management of education and training must be integrated, and those with a stake in them must have this recognised;\n\nthere must be a greater public and private investment in education and training to achieve a better return; and\n\nachievement must constantly rise and progress be open for all to examine (NCE 1993:397-408).\n\nThe NCE was concerned about the Major government's obsession with creating 'a greater variety of secondary schools' and warned that 'as we see it, there is a serious danger of a hierarchy of good, adequate and \"sink\" schools emerging within the maintained system' (NCE 1993:180).\n\nThe aims of giving all children access to 'high-quality' schooling and of creating greater choice and diversity were simply not compatible:\n\nAs we see it, the main task for the future will not be to concentrate on producing highly educated elites, but to achieve higher learning outcomes for all, and particularly for those in the middle and lower bands of attainment. ...\n\nAt present, there is a conflict between, on the one hand, moves towards a greater diversity and choice of schools and, on the other hand, an ideal of equal access for all children to 'high-quality' education. Laudable principles for schools may often work against each other: serving a local community and catering for all abilities as in the comprehensive ideal; or encouraging choice of secondary school. For example, a community school where the neighbourhood is not socially mixed may not have a broad enough social or ability range to operate in a truly comprehensive manner. Choice, when exercised, is often used to escape from the local school, thereby working against the community school ideal. Similarly, those parents who are exercising their choice are tending to use it in favour of schools with other pupils of an 'appropriate background' (NCE 1993:181-2).\n\nClyde Chitty found the NCE report disappointing. Reviewing it in Forum, he noted that there was only one reference to comprehensive schools in the index:\n\nThe Report cannot bring itself to come out unequivocally in favour of a major prerequisite of future advance: the establishment at the secondary level of a national system of community comprehensive schools with no selective or independent enclaves (Chitty 1994b:61).\n\nThe Commission's hope that its vision for the future would be shared by the government was 'wishful thinking of a rarefied kind' (Chitty 1994b:61):\n\nNothing that has happened in the past fifteen years gives one any cause to expect that any significant part of the National Commission agenda for change will be implemented by John Major and his miserable team at the DFE (Chitty 1994b:61).\n\nNational Curriculum\n\nThe National Curriculum had been designed and constructed with very little input from practising teachers: they had been prevented from being curriculum innovators and demoted to being curriculum 'deliverers'.\n\nBased on discrete subjects, it made integrated 'topic' and 'project' work difficult; it was hugely overloaded with content, so that its introduction had resulted in falling standards in some 'important aspects of literacy and numeracy' (DES 1992:1); and its assessment procedures were cumbersome, to say the least.\n\nWith the government's promise (in its 1992 election manifesto) that 'information about the performance of all local schools' would be published, three inevitable - and undesirable - effects quickly became apparent:\n\nschools became unwilling to take on pupils with learning difficulties, since they tended to depress overall test results;\n\nteachers were encouraged to concentrate their efforts on children who were on the borderline between one level and the next, rather than on those who needed attention most; and\n\nthe curriculum became skewed by the need to practise for the tests.\n\nIt was not only teachers who wanted the National Curriculum reviewed. Right-wing think-tanks and pressure groups were unhappy with aspects of the first version and campaigned for\n\nthe simplification and 'Anglicisation' of the national testing system, so as to emphasise basic skills and the English cultural heritage (Jones 2003:141).\n\nThe New Right gained control of the curriculum and assessment councils, where they provoked strong opposition from teachers, especially from teachers of English. By the spring of 1993, teachers were considering a boycott of English tests for 14-year-olds (The Independent 13 February 1993); and there was a widespread boycott of Standard Assessment Tests (SATs) in 1993-4.\n\nAs a result, Patten was forced to commission a review of the National Curriculum and, in April 1993, he appointed Sir Ron Dearing to lead it.\n\n1994 Dearing Review\n\nDearing (1930-2009) (pictured) was a career civil servant who had held various senior positions, including that of Chief Executive of the Post Office. In 1993 he was appointed Chancellor of the University of Nottingham.\n\nHe was asked to 'undertake a Review of the National Curriculum and of the framework for assessing pupils' progress' (Dearing 1994:3) and, in particular,\n\ni the scope for slimming down the curriculum;\n\nii how the central administration of the National Curriculum and testing arrangements could be improved;\n\niii how the testing arrangements might be simplified; and\n\niv the future of the ten-level scale for recognising children's attainment (Dearing 1994:3).\n\nDearing produced an interim report in July 1993; his final report, The National Curriculum and its Assessment, was submitted to Patten on 20 December 1993 and published in 1994.\n\nIt argued that the National Curriculum was 'fundamental to raising educational standards', but that\n\nUrgent action is needed to reduce the statutorily required content of its programmes of study and to make it less prescriptive and less complex (Dearing 1994:7).\n\nThe statutory curriculum Orders should therefore be subject to a 'closely co-ordinated review' (Dearing 1994:7) with a view to\n\ni reducing the volume of material required by law to be taught;\n\nii simplifying and clarifying the programmes of study;\n\niii reducing prescription so as to give more scope for professional judgement;\n\niv ensuring that the Orders are written in a way which offers maximum support to the classroom teacher (Dearing 1994:17).\n\nKey Stages 1-3\n\nAt Key Stages 1-3 (for pupils aged 5-14), the content of the curriculum should be reduced so that twenty per cent of teaching time would be 'for use at the discretion of the school' (Dearing 1994:21). The first priority for this discretionary time should be to support work in the basics of literacy, oracy and numeracy; schools should be accountable to their governing bodies for using the time released effectively.\n\nThe School Curriculum and Assessment Authority (SCAA) should review the attainment targets and statements of attainment with a view to reducing their number. 'No further major changes should be made to the National Curriculum Orders for five years following the review' (Dearing 1994:9)\n\nAppendix 6 of the review set out advice to primary schools on how the level of record keeping, which had been 'a heavy burden for many teachers' (Dearing 1994:14), could be reduced. Dearing himself is said to have reckoned that a primary teacher might have to assess pupils against up to one thousand attainment statements in a year; his review 'provided some relief to teachers who were drowning in assessment requirements' (Wrigley 2014:24-25).\n\nHowever, the pressure was still heavy, especially for teachers of younger primary pupils, and it had damaging results: 'the statutory requirement to report attainment levels in every subject, and multiple strands in some, inevitably distracted from their traditional focus on teaching children to read' (Wrigley 2014:25).\n\nKey Stage 4\n\nAt Key Stage 4 (ages 14-16),\n\nschools should have greater opportunity to offer a curriculum which meets the distinctive talents and individual aspirations of their students. The mandatory requirements should be limited to English, mathematics and single science, physical education and short courses in a modern foreign language and technology. Religious education and sex education must, in addition, be taught by law. Careers education is also particularly important at this key stage (Dearing 1994:9).\n\nDearing 'justified the abandonment of Key Stage Four in the form envisaged in 1987' (Chitty 2013:135) on the grounds that it would allow 'greater scope for academic and vocational options' (Dearing 1994:9). He called for 'the development of three broad educational pathways in post-16 education and training' (Dearing 1994:19):\n\nthe 'craft' or 'occupational' - equipping young people with particular skills and with knowledge directly related to a craft or occupation through National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs).\n\nthe 'vocational' - a midway path between the academic and occupational - leading to General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs).\n\nthe 'academic', leading to A and AS levels (Dearing 1994:19).\n\nVocational qualifications should be developed for use at Key Stage 4 as part of a wider curriculum; the requirement for National Curriculum short courses to be combined with another short course for accreditation purposes should be abandoned; the balance between the content of National Curriculum subjects and GCSE syllabuses should be reviewed; and the removal of history and geography from the mandatory subjects at Key Stage 4 should be implemented immediately.\n\nDearing expanded on these proposals in an address to the Secondary Heads Association's annual conference in Bournemouth in March 1994, when he announced that 14-year-old students would soon be able to study for qualifications in one or other of five vocational areas: manufacturing, art and design, health and social care, leisure and tourism, and business and finance (The Financial Times 21 March 1994 quoted in Chitty 2013:136).\n\nSpecial needs\n\nThe National Curriculum should be available to pupils with special educational needs, and special needs teachers should be involved in its revision (Dearing 1994:11).\n\nAssessment\n\nWith regard to assessment, Dearing argued that\n\nThe ten-level scale is unnecessarily complex and excessively prescriptive. It suffers from duplication and inconsistencies. These failings explain some very real problems teachers have experienced in implementing the National Curriculum (Dearing 1994:11).\n\nHowever, the purposes the scale was intended to serve were sound, and it should therefore be retained but improved, with\n\ni a substantial reduction in the number of statements of attainment to provide a definition of what is expected at each level, which is sufficiently clear and rigorous to be of use to teachers but which avoids the excessive detail of the present approach;\n\nii a reduction in the number of attainment targets to reflect the slimming down of the statutorily required curriculum (particularly at Key Stages 1 and 2);\n\niii the definition, where necessary, of more even steps between levels (Dearing 1994:12).\n\nThe national tests in the core subjects should be simplified 'as far as possible without sacrificing validity and reliability'; and 'the time which is needed to administer the tests must continue to be reduced' (Dearing 1994:13).\n\nSystems of moderated teacher assessment should underpin standards but should not be bureaucratic or require excessive amounts of teacher time; for Key Stage 3, statutory teacher assessment of non-core subjects should be introduced or reintroduced. The Group set up by SCAA to advise on the value-added approach to the measurement of school performance should report by June 1994.\n\nFinally, Dearing argued that the ten-level scale was unnecessary 'for the majority of students at Key Stage 4', and he therefore recommended that 'it should not be used at this key stage' (Dearing 1994:70).\n\nOutcome\n\nThe government accepted Dearing's recommendations so that, by the time the Conservatives left office in 1997, the Key Stage 4 curriculum 'bore little resemblance to the framework devised ten years earlier by Kenneth Baker' (Chitty 2013:136).\n\nThe compulsory subjects in maintained secondary schools were now: English, maths, science, design and technology, information technology (as a separate subject or coordinated across other subjects), a modern foreign language, and physical education. The humanities and arts were demoted to being optional extras: pupils had to choose between history or geography; art or music.\n\nSecondary schools also had a statutory duty to provide religious education in accordance with a locally agreed syllabus, and a programme of 'carefully structured sex education' (Chitty 2013:136). Careers education was scheduled to become a statutory part of the secondary curriculum from September 1998. In those parts of Wales where Welsh was spoken, it was an additional 'core' subject.\n\nReaction\n\nMyra Barrs, Director of the Centre for Language Education, argued that Dearing had left a 'trail of confusion' behind him, which was 'likely to be most marked at Key Stage 4', where he had 'casually demolished a common system of examining at 16+ which it had taken more than twenty years to establish' (Barrs 1994:36).\n\nBut the most problematic element in the final report was unquestionably Sir Ron's decision to retain the 10-level scale as the basis for National Curriculum assessment, despite much public agonising about its inadequacies. It is hard to see how we can go on working with a basic framework for assessment which is obviously so deeply flawed (Barrs 1994:36).\n\nKen Jones has argued that, by reducing the amount of detail and removing 'the stronger signs of the traditionalist and ethnocentric enthusiasms of the New Right' (Jones 2003:141), the revised National Curriculum\n\nmarked the end of the New Right's curricular influence, at the same time as it helped embed the curriculum, and its associated testing system, at the consensual centre of English schooling (Jones 2003:141).\n\nSpeaking in May 1994, just after the publication of the Review, Patten said:\n\nI've added my own twiddles to it; all children between 5 and 7 to have some British history; English to be given close attention in all subjects, whether it's geography or history; if you can't communicate and express yourself in English, then you can't function. We'll have to see what teacher-land makes of it over the next three months, but I think we have got the makings of a settlement now, which I hope will be in place by January next year, when the papers go out to all the schools so they know what they're doing for September 1995 (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:185).\n\nHe hoped that the next five years (1995-2000) would be\n\na period of peace and quiet where we can concentrate on the outputs; on making sure that the test papers are rigorous enough; against a background of some stability, which I'm sure practising teachers would welcome (quoted in Ribbins and Sherratt 1997:185).\n\n1994 Warwick Evaluation\n\nThe Dearing Review was not the only manifestation of anxiety about the National Curriculum: there were particular concerns about the teaching of English.\n\nThere was widespread dissatisfaction with the English component of the National Curriculum from the moment it was introduced in schools in the autumn term, 1990. Six months later the National Curriculum Council (NCC) commissioned the University of Warwick to undertake an evaluation of it: work began in September 1991.\n\nTo complicate matters, a year later the NCC advised the Secretary of State that the English Order needed revising. The Secretary of State asked the NCC to conduct a review, and this was completed in March 1993. The Warwick project team, led by Professor Bridie Raban, Urszula Clark and Joanna McIntyre, therefore had to conduct their evaluation against this changing background.\n\nThe Warwick team published an interim report in 1992; their final report, Imple"
