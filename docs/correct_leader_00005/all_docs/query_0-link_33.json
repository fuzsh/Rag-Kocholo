If you just want to mail a letter with the address above, and do not want anything back, then you can stop reading! If you live in UK send a properly stamped and self addressed envelope (minimum size 8.5\" x 4\") with your request letter and a photo. You can include a piece of cardboard to keep the photo from bending in shipping and also add \"Do Not Bend\" on the envelopes. Send your letter and wait. On average, there is going to be a 3+ month wait for a response. If you do not live in UK, you can purchase your british stamps here *For information on postage prices to receive a letter from UK click here.\n\nFeedback received:\n\nSir John Major Success - July 6th, 2019\n\nSent 2 x 6x4 to Sir John, and received them today back signed.
