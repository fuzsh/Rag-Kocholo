The Cultural Studies major program at JCSU will empower you to examine how culture is a powerful driver in our media-saturated world.\n\nHave you ever wondered how scientists are able to create, operate and maintain large-scale information systems?\n\nAt JCSU, we’re looking for curious minds like yours to help us find solutions to real-world problems in information systems engineering domain that manages the blending of software, hardware, networks and security.\n\nThe actions of one person can have an amazing impact on society. However, today’s social issues are so complex, they require some pretty creative answers.\n\nAs an interdisciplinary studies major at JCSU, you won’t be confined to just one program of study. Our flexible program allows you to combine two or three majors to create a unique major that fits your career goals.\n\nIn the 17th century, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Liebnitz — two giants of the mathematic world — both developed the first real theory of the infinite. They fought over who was first for the rest of their lives, but it created what we call calculus.\n\nCalculus lies at the heart of that idea, and learning how it can be applied to everyday situations will change your world.\n\nSome people were born to shine under the spotlight. If you consider yourself to be a rising star, or if you want to help others tap into their talent through engineering, music production or teaching, our music program may be the right fit for you.\n\nAs a music major at JCSU, you’ll have the opportunity to fine-tune your creativity and develop the skills to express yourself through sound.\n\nThere are few subjects as fascinating and mysterious as the human brain.
