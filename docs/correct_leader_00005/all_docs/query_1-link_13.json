        "text": "(born 1943). Rising above his humble background, John Major became prime minister of the United Kingdom in 1990. He was the youngest person to hold the post since the Earl of Rosebery in 1894. Major served as prime minister until May 1997, when his Conservative party suffered its worst loss in 165 years in national elections and was ousted by the Labour party led by Tony Blair.\n\nJohn Roy Major was born on March 29, 1943, in London. He grew up in the multiracial suburb of Brixton and attended Cheam Common Primary School and Rutlish Grammar School. At 16 he left school and eventually went to work for a merchant bank. He joined the Conservative party, traditionally the choice of those from an upper-class background. In two separate elections during 1974 he tried but failed to get elected to Parliament from the Camden section of London.\n\nIn 1979 Major succeeded in becoming a member of Parliament for Huntingdon, a town north of London. He was government whip (1984–85) and then joined Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet in 1987 as chief secretary of the treasury. On October 26, 1989, after a brief period of service as foreign secretary, he was named chancellor of the exchequer. In this office he developed a reputation for both fiscal conservatism and skillful negotiation. When Thatcher was forced to resign in November 1990 she endorsed Major as her successor, and he was elected by the Conservatives to be party leader and prime minister.\n\nAlthough he had agreed with Thatcher’s domestic polices, he differed from her regarding the European Union (EU). She was critical of too much centralization of power in Europe, but he supported the creation of a common European currency and a strong central bureaucracy in the EU.\n\nIn April 1992 he faced and won his first general election, which tested his attempts to boost his country’s ailing economy. He also adapted to the growing popular opposition to economic union with the EU. Within two years, however, his popularity among Britons had fallen to an unprecedented level. His party suffered severe losses in by-elections and in the European Parliament. In addition, he had raised taxes after campaigning against a tax increase. By mid-1994 he had lost most support within his own party.\n\nIn June 1995 Major called for a party leadership election to decide whether he would continue as Conservative party leader. Opponents had remained critical, despite improved economic conditions and lower unemployment. He won easily and made changes in his Cabinet to strengthen his base of support.\n\nIn February 1996 Major’s government narrowly won a victory in a parliamentary debate concerning the release of an independent report on the country’s sale of military weaponry to Iraq during the 1980s. The report concluded that government ministers acted to cover up the relaxation of curbs on the arms sales. Major argued that the three-year investigation exonerated his government on the most serious charge of intentionally deceiving Parliament.\n\nThe economy of the United Kingdom performed well under Major, making the country one of the most prosperous nations in Europe. Divisions in the Conservative party’s stance on EU issues, however, hindered the prime minister. Those divisions, along with doubts about Major’s ability to hold his party together, a series of sexual and financial scandals that rocked the party and the government, and voter dissatisfaction over Conservative management of the education system, the National Health Service, and the fight against crime, brought about Major’s downfall in May 1, 1997, national elections. After gaining only about 31 percent of the vote—the lowest percentage since 1859—the Conservatives went down to humbling defeat, and Major resigned as head of the party."
