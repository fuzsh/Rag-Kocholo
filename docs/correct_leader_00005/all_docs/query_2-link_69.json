        "text": "A view of the famous cabinet table. See if you can guess which chair the Prime Minister sits in...\n\nOn 7th February 1991, a terrorist mortar bomb exploded in the garden of Number 10, just a few metres from the Cabinet Room. John Major was chairing a Cabinet meeting at the time.\n\nJust like the cabinet room, the study includes a table which has a fascinating history of its own.\n\nThe study's wall pays tribute to one of its most famous residents, thanks to artist Richard Stone.\n\nBlack and white engravings and photographs of all the past Prime Ministers decorate the wall; every time a Prime Minister leaves No. 10, the pictures are moved down one by one to make way for their portrait.\n\nThe Grand Staircase captures centuries of British political history, stretching all the way back to Sir Robert Walpole, generally regarded as the first Prime Minister.\n\nWinston Churchill is the only Prime Minister to have two portraits on the staircase. See if you can find both in the street view tour of 10 Downing Street."
