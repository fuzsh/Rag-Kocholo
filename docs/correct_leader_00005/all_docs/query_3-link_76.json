        "text": "Above: Gottheimer with Hometown Hero Dr. Stephen Angeli, a cardiologist at Holy Name Medical Center, and Gina Gilmore, mother of Kyle Hewlett and a CPR advocate.\n\nFORT LEE, NJ — Today, Monday, July 15, 2024, following the Pennsylvania assassination attempt, U.S. Congressman Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5) called for unity and honored unsung, local life-saving first responders, veterans, volunteers, community leaders, and residents during his Fifth District Hometown Heroes Ceremony, held at the Barrymore Film Center in Fort Lee.\n\nWatch Gottheimer’s Hometown Heroes Ceremony here.\n\nGottheimer honored more than twenty community leaders as Fifth District Hometown Heroes to acknowledge their dedication to helping improve the lives of their neighbors, families, and communities\n\nAmong many other heroes, Gottheimer honored John Pecoraro, who helped remove rubble from the World Trade Center on 9/11 and has served for more than fifty years on the Paramus Rescue Squad; Kate Duggan, CEO of Family Promise of Bergen County, whose organization has served more than 250,000 meals to families in need over the past four years and helped families facing housing insecurity; and Matthew Letizia, a distinguished emergency medicine physician who coordinated more than forty blood drives to support people with blood cancers like his late father.\n\nGottheimer opened today’s event by condemning the disgraceful political violence against former President Trump that occurred on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania: “We cannot allow this depraved act of political violence to extinguish our nation’s hope. On Saturday, I felt hope when I saw our law enforcement heroes work to restore order and protect everyone on the ground. I felt hope when I saw our country’s leaders stand united against violence and extremism. And, I felt hope when I saw everyday Americans set aside their political differences and put our country first,” said U.S. Congressman Josh Gottheimer.\n\nGottheimer continued, “If you look hard enough, you can see incredible stories of hope in our communities everyday: the EMT who has saved countless lives and volunteered decades of service and the young student going above and beyond to help her fellow classmates. Even in the face of our country’s challenges, we need to spend more time showcasing all of the good that happens every day — and recognizing what it means to be a great citizen in the greatest country in the world. Today, we are here to highlight those from across North Jersey who are hard-wired to help others.”\n\nRead about this year’s Hometown Heroes below:\n\nLisa and Ashley Holl, Montvale — In February, Lisa and Ashley noticed smoke emanating from a neighbor’s windows and attic vents.

During the Easter holiday, Rebecca, Linda, Dylan, and Evelyn were taking care of a pediatric behavioral health patient who had been boarded up in the emergency department for two weeks. They wanted to do something to lift the boy’s spirits and make Easter special, so they set up an Easter egg hunt in the behavioral health courtyard. The young patient was ecstatic.

He is the medical director for approximately forty emergency agencies throughout New Jersey, helping them organize everything from ocean rescue to EMS training to law enforcement responses. Five years ago, Matthew’s father, Gary was diagnosed with Leukemia. After a brave year-long battle, he ultimately lost his fight against cancer. But, throughout his fight, he relied on blood donors. Since losing his father, Matthew has made it his mission to increase awareness about blood donation and expand the blood supply. Three years ago, he held the first Gary Letizia Memorial Blood Drive. These drives have taken off since then: two years ago, he ran two additional drives. Matthew ran fourteen successful drives in 2023, and they’re on track to hold 37 more this coming year.

In addition to their service to the town, the duo has worked together to create a second 9/11 monument in Westwood. Andy is a union ironworker who worked “The Pile” after 9/11, the large mass of debris and rubble that formed following the collapse of the Twin Towers. He and his fellow ironworkers carved crosses into the steel beams as a sign of hope and faith. In 2022, Andy approached Daniel, asking to donate one of those steel sections that he salvaged to the town’s Veterans Park. It would memorialize the hard work of ironworkers and first responders who sacrificed their health to help our nation recover after 9/11. They assembled a team of volunteers and local employees from Westwood’s Department of Public Works to move the steel segment to Daniel’s house. They spent months mocking up a design for the memorial and assembling it at Veterans Park. Today, that steel segment sits in Veterans Park with a bronze plaque from Westwood PD to memorialize those who worked so hard and so long to find our people. The memorial is the site of Westwood’s annual 9/11 memorial service, which was coordinated by the late “Skip” Kelley, who we honored as a Hometown Hero last year.\n\nJoseph Powderley, Mahwah — In June 2023, Joseph transferred to Mahwah Police Department after four years of service in Demarest. On one of his first solo patrols with Mahwah PD, Officer Powderley was dispatched to the home of Richard Bernstein, a Grammy-winning Opera singer and Metropolitan Opera veteran. Moments after Joseph arrived, Richard stopped breathing and began turning blue. Officer Powderley immediately recognized that Richard was experiencing cardiac arrest and saved his life with a combination of a defibrillator, oxygen, and chest compressions. Thankfully, Richard made a full recovery, and he’s back to doing what he loves: entertaining audiences with the gift of music. In September, Richard had the opportunity to thank Officer Joseph Powderley in person with his wife. Mahwah Police Department also recognized his heroism with a Life Saving Award.\n\nDr. Stephen Angeli, Teaneck — Dr. Stephen Angeli is a cardiologist at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck. In July 2023, Kyle Hewlett was admitted to Holy Name’s cardiac unit after experiencing extreme fatigue. Dr. Angeli, who was on rotation at the time, diagnosed him with myocarditis, a viral infection that causes heart inflammation, and admitted him. Unfortunately, Kyle’s condition began to deteriorate, and by the middle of the night, he developed ventricular tachycardia. After six unsuccessful defibrillator rounds, Dr. Angeli and his team performed 90 minutes worth of CPR, swapping out when fatigue set in. After the CPR, Dr. Angeli executed a complex procedure, cardiac catheterization, to keep blood flowing and ultimately, save Kyle’s life. Kyle is healthy and now works with his mom, Gina, to spread awareness about the importance of CPR at schools across North Jersey. In mid-May, they traveled to D.C. to advocate for CPR education in Congress. Beyond his life-saving efforts with Kyle, Dr. Angeli has won the Humanitarian Award for his work on the Korean Medical Program at Holy Name Medical Center\n\nDillon Rinaldo (Posthumous), Fair Lawn — Firefighting was in Dillon’s DNA. As a toddler, he had turn-out gear at the base of his bed and would listen to his father’s fire radio so he could try to respond to calls with his father. He and his best friends took turns pulling their red wagon “fire truck” and saving the very lucky citizens of their imaginary world. He joined his father for many years as a volunteer on Fair Lawn’s Company Four Engine. In 2017, Dillon became a full-time firefighter with the Baltimore City Fire Department.He served the people of Baltimore honorably for four years, graduating as valedictorian of his training class and advancing to lieutenant of Engine 46 in July 2022. On October 19, 2023, he was mortally injured in the line of duty, and ultimately, passed away on October 24th. Upon his passing, he was promoted to Captain in recognition of his sterling service.\n\nDr. Kenneth Hoffman (Posthumous), Teaneck — An oncologist, Dr. Hoffman devoted his entire life to saving lives and helping people heal. Dr. Hoffman balanced his medical career with constant service to the township of Teaneck. He was the longtime president of Teaneck’s Junior Soccer League, Chair of the Township’s Playgrounds, Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, Chair of the Municipal Open Space Trust Advisory Board, and a longtime member of the Environmental Commission. Dr. Hoffman was an absolute force who worked around the clock to make sports accessible for every kid in Teaneck. Dr. Hoffman was the singular force behind building the Township’s sportsplex and field house. He ensured that no child would ever be turned away from playing soccer, even if their parents couldn’t afford the fees. Dr. Hoffman also created a college scholarship program for Teaneck High School students who volunteered to coach recreational soccer. Teaneck has honored his incredible contributions by naming the Township’s soccer field after him: “Hoffman’s Pitch at Votee Sportsplex.”\n\nMayor Paul Hoelscher (Posthumous), Harrington Park — Paul served as the Mayor of Harrington Park for more than thirty years and touched countless lives along the way. He was also an educator by trade who taught government at Passaic Valley High School in Little Falls for more than thirty years. As Mayor, Paul went above and beyond to celebrate and connect with his community members, be it a Girl Scout Meeting, a parade, or a graduation. He helped mothers in need and mentored Korean-American youth in Harrington Park, including now-Councilwoman Joon Chung. Paul’s tremendous service to his community and his constituents was recognized in 2012, when he was inducted into the New Jersey League of Municipalities’ Mayor’s Hall of Fame and again in 2017, when he was inducted into the League’s Elected Officials Hall of Fame.
