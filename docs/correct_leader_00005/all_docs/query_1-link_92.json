        "text": "Keir Starmer Labour 2024 – date\n\nBorn: 2 September 1962 in Southwark, London.\n\nKeir Starmer was elected as Member of Parliament for Holborn and St Pancras in 2015 and as leader of the Labour Party in 2020, succeeding the left wing Jeremy Corbyn. As leader of the Labour Party, he worked hard to position his party toward the political centre and achieve credibility with the electorate. In the General Election on 4 July 2024, Labour won a landslide number of seats – 412 to the Conservative’s 121 – on a platform of ‘Change’ and (refreshingly) public service. However, turnout at the election was just 60% and Labour’s overall share of the vote was only 34%, which was 1.4% higher than its worst ever defeat in 2019.\n\nFamous for: Wait and see.\n\nRishi Sunak Conservative 2022-2024\n\nBorn: 12 May 1980 in Southampton.\n\nBackground: Rishi Sunak is the UK’s first Prime Minister of Asian origin, and Hindu, born to parents of Indian descent who migrated to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. He is also the youngest Prime Minister to take office since the Earl of Liverpool, Robert Jenkinson, in 1812. Sunak’s father was a GP and his mother ran her own pharmacy business. He was educated at Winchester College, Lincoln College, Oxford (where he read philosophy, politics and economics) and Stanford, California, where he met his wife, daughter of an Indian billionaire. He had a career in investment banking and hedge fund management before becoming MP for Richmond, Yorkshire, in 2015. The Sunaks are thought to be one of the wealthiest couples in the UK.\n\nRishi Sunak served as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government from 9 January 2018 to 24 July 2019, Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 24 July 2019 to 13 February 2020, and Chancellor of the Exchequer from 13 February 2020 to 5 July 2022. Sunak’s period as Chancellor coincided with the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic, during which he introduced considerable support, including the employee furlough scheme, to help individuals and businesses through the crisis. His resignation as Chancellor, following that of then Health Secretary Sajid Javid, was the second of more than 50 resignations that triggered the departure of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nSunak secured the support of the majority of Conservative MPs in the subsequent competition to select a new leader of his party, losing to Liz Truss in the vote of the whole membership in September 2022. Following Liz Truss’ resignation, Sunak became leader of the Conservatives on 24 October 2022 having secured the required support of more than 100 MPs. The only other declared candidate, Penny Mordaunt, withdrew at the very last minute.\n\nFamous for: Rishi Sunak took office on 25 October 2022 with an even larger set of issues to resolve than those that faced his predecessor, Liz Truss. He committed to unify his party, the nation – and to restore trust.\n\nRishi Sunak took office on 25 October 2022 with an even larger set of issues than those that faced his predecessor, Liz Truss. He committed to unify his party, the nation – and to restore much eroded trust in government and, specifically, the Conservatives. In January 2023, he made five Pledges: Halve inflation (at 10+% at the time); Grow the economy; Reduce debt; Cut NHS waiting lists in England (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage their own health systems); Stop the boats. He only achieved one of those – halving inflation. Perhaps Mr Sunak will best be remembered for being a decent man presiding over a deeply unpopular and flawed party. Rishi Sunak will also be remembered for calling a snap election on 22 May to take place on 4 July, just 6 weeks later. The result was a disaster for the Conservatives, who won just 121 seats in Parliament, a loss of 251. Labour won the election with 412 seats, a gain of 211. It was the Conservative’s worst parliamentary defeat since 1832.\n\nLiz Truss Conservative 2022\n\nBorn: 26 July 1975 in Oxford.\n\nBackground: Mary Elizabeth Truss was educated at Roundhay Scholl, Leeds, then Merton College, Oxford, where she read philosophy, politics and economics. Her parents have been described as ‘left wing’. Whilst at university, Liz Truss was President of the Oxford University Liberal Democrats and supported the legalisation of cannabis and the abolition of the monarchy. She worked as a management accountant before becoming Conservative MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 and is married with two children.\n\nLiz Truss served as Under Secretary of State for Education and Childcare, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Minister for Women and Equalities and Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs. She beat ex-Chancellor Rishi Sunak to win the Conservative leadership contest on 5 September 2022. Truss was appointed Prime Minister by Queen Elizabeth at Balmoral on 6 September, Her Majesty’s final engagement before her death on 8 September. The new PM took office with a raft of issues to resolve, not least spiralling energy costs and general inflation. She announced an energy support package on 8 September and, on 23 September, her Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng launched a euphemistically termed ‘fiscal event’, which included the biggest tax cuts for 50 years, worth £45bn. This drew widespread criticism that the cuts were unfunded, would benefit the wealthy, and sparked panic in the financial markets. The pound fell dramatically and the cost of mortgages increased almost overnight. Hunt, considered a safe pair of hands who might steady the market, promptly reversed most of the Truss/Kwartang tax proposals. There was speculation about how long Prime Minister Truss could last in her position. On 19 October, Home Secretary Suella Braverman resigned. On 20 October, after just 45 days in office, Liz Truss resigned too.Truss formerly tendered her resignation to King Charles III on 25 October 2022, following the selection of Rishi Sunak as the new Leader of the Conservative Party.\n\nFamous for: Crashing the British economy and being the shortest serving Prime Minister in British history. Liz Truss lost her South West Norfolk constituency seat to Labour by 630 votes in the General Election of 4 July 2024.\n\nBoris Johnson Conservative 2019-2022\n\nBorn: 19 June 1964 in New York, USA.\n\nBackground: Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he read Classics. He is an ex-journalist, served as Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, was Member of Parliament for Henley from 2001 to 2008 and has been Member of Parliament for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 2015. He was appointed Foreign Secretary by Theresa May, but resigned following differences over the UK’s departure from the European Union. Johnson became Prime Minister on 24 July 2019, having won the election to become leader of the Conservative Party following Theresa May’s resignation in 2019, winning a significant majority over main rival Jeremy Hunt. He renegotiated the UK’s departure from the EU, which had been re-set to 31 October, but lost the support of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionists and was forced to call for a general election, which was eventually approved by Parliament on 29 October. At the general election on 12 December, the Conservatives won a landslide overall majority of 80 seats in Parliament, promising to ‘level-up’ (make the country more equal) and winning many traditional Labour seats.\n\nJohnson’s tenure in No 10 was dominated by the Coronavirus pandemic that began in early 2020, the government’s handling of the crisis (which included nationwide lockdowns), the fast development and rolling out of vaccines – and, of course, the thousands of deaths (205,000 people in the UK by the time Johnson left office). He will also be remembered for his unhesitating backing of Ukraine following the Russian invasion in February 2022 and for the economic crisis that was made worse by escalating energy costs caused by the war in Ukraine. However, a succession of scandals had begun to mire Johnson’s premiership, made worse by obfuscation and dishonesty. Eventually, a series of ministerial resignations (57 in total) led to his resignation as Leader of the Conservative Party on 7 July 2022. He continued in office until a successor, Liz Truss, had been chosen, tendering his resignation as Prime Minister to the Queen on 6 September 2022.\n\nFamous for: Highly intelligent, charismatic, bad hair, gaffe-prone, uncertain relationship with the truth and championing the cause of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union – ‘BREXIT’. A ‘Marmite politician’ – one who is widely adored or derided. His parting words at his final Prime Minister’s Questions on 20 July 2022 were clearly intended to be prophetic – “Hasta la vista – baby!.”\n\nTheresa May Conservative 2016-2019\n\nBorn: 1 October 1956 in Eastbourne, East Sussex.\n\nBackground: Theresa Mary May (née Brasier) grew up in Oxfordshire and read geography at St Hugh’s College, Oxford. She worked in the financial sector before becoming Member of Parliament for Maidenhead in 1997 and was Home Secretary under David Cameron. She became Prime Minister following David Cameron’s resignation in 2016 and called an election in 2017. Unfortunately, the electorate did not entirely buy her ‘strong and stable’ tagline and she was returned with a significantly reduced majority, forcing a reliance on a minority party, the Democratic Unionists of Northern Ireland. This, together with deep divisions of opinion in the Conservative Party, greatly hampered her ability to achieve much. Parliament repeatedly defeated the departure deal she had negotiated with the EU and in 2019 she announced her decision to resign as Prime Minister, stepping down on 7 June.\n\nFamous for: Theresa May’s tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the issue of ‘BREXIT’ – the UK’s departure from the European Union, which she failed to implement.\n\nDavid Cameron Conservative 2015-2016\n\nBorn: 9 October 1966 in Marylebone, London.\n\nBackground: David William Donald Cameron attended Eton and read philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) at Brasenose College, Oxford. He worked for the Conservative Party from 1988, was Member of Parliament for Witney from 2001 to 2016 and became leader of the Conservative Party in 2005.\n\nFamous for: Being Prime Minister of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, seeking to reduce the deficit in government finances by austerity measures, introducing a referendum on Scottish independence (2014) and then a referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union (EU). When the UK narrowly voted to leave the EU on 23 June 2016, against his recommendation, Cameron resigned as Prime Minister.\n\nDavid Cameron Conservative-Liberal coalition 2010-2015\n\nSee previous entry.\n\nGordon Brown Labour 2007-2010\n\nBorn: 20 February 1951 in Giffnock, Renfrewshire, Scotland.\n\nBackground: James Gordon Brown was brought up in Kirkaldy and read history at the University of Edinburgh. Before becoming Member of Parliament for Dunfermline East in 1983, he had been a TV journalist and college lecturer. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1997 until 2007, when he became Prime Minister following Tony Blair’s resignation.\n\nFamous for: Being the longest-serving Chancellor of the Exchequer in modern times, as UK Prime Minister leading Britain through the global economic crisis that struck in 2008, and playing a key role in maintaining the union between England and Scotland during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. When Prime Minister, the Climate Change Act of 2008 set a target for the year 2050 for the reduction of targeted greenhouse gas emissions and the Counter-Terrorism Act in the same year increased government powers to gather and share personal information.\n\nTony Blair Labour 1997-2007\n\nBorn: 6 May 1953 in Edinburgh.\n\nBackground: Anthony Charles Lynton Blair was brought up in Adelaide, Australia, and Durham, England. He attended Fettes College in Edinburgh and read law at St John’s College, Oxford. He was a barrister before becoming Member of Parliament for Sedgefield from 1983 to 2007. Blair became leader of the Labour Party after the sudden death of John Smith in 1994.\n\nFamous for: Moving the Labour Party to the political centre-right and leading it to three election victories, in 1997, 2001 and 2005. Introducing the National Minimum Wage, Human Rights and Freedom of Information Acts. Holding referenda in Scotland and Wales over devolved government resulted in establishing a new Scottish Parliament and a National Assembly for Wales. One of Blair’s biggest achievements was being instrumental in the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland. Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA, Blair allied with US President Bush to support US-sponsored invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The latter was controversial. The regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq was unpleasant, but secular and nothing to do with Islamic terrorism. Moreover, the invasion was justified by the mistaken belief that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. Nor was there any plan of what to do after the inevitable success of the invasion; thousands died in the subsequent upheaval. Blair’s legacy is often seen as the man who helped cause, and lead the UK into, an unnecessary war.\n\nJohn Major Conservative 1990-1997\n\nBorn: 29 March 1943, St Helier, Carshalton, Surrey.\n\nBackground: John Major grew up in Brixton, South East London, and, unlike most recent prime ministers, he left school at 16 and did not attend university. He was active in local south London politics from an early age and became Member of Parliament for Huntingdonshire in 1979. He rose rapidly and, as Prime Minister Thatcher ran out of ministerial options toward the end of her premiership, she appointed Major Foreign Secretary in 1989 and Chancellor of the Exchequer soon afterwards. He became Prime Minister following Margaret Thatcher’s reluctant departure in 1990, winning a General Election in his own right in 1992.\n\nFamous for: Having an affair with fellow Conservative, Edwina Currie. Leading the UK’s participation in the First Gulf War, surviving an IRA mortar attack on Number 10 during a Cabinet meeting and cancelling the Community Charge, the widely unpopular, ‘poll tax’, introduced by his predecessor. Major’s administration was, possibly unfairly, mired with accusations of ‘sleaze’ – poor moral behaviour – and conflict within the Conservative government over Europe. John Major initiated the work that culminated in the Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement in 1998.\n\nMargaret Thatcher Conservative 1979-1990\n\nBorn: 13 October 1925, Grantham, Lincolnshire. Died: 8 April 2013, Ritz Hotel, London. Buried: Royal Hospital, Chelsea, London.\n\nBackground: Margaret Hilda Thatcher (née Roberts) had a fairly strict Methodist upbringing in Grantham, hugely influenced by her father. She attended the local grammar school and then read chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford before training as a barrister. She was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959, was Education Secretary under Ted Heath in 1970 and then, surprising many, successfully stood against him for the party leadership in 1975. In 1979, the Conservatives won the General Election and Thatcher became Britain’s first woman prime minister. She went on to win two more elections, in 1983 and 1987.\n\nFamous for: Being known as the Iron Lady and dividing opinion, even now. Reform of the trades unions. Pursuing a radical monetarist policy and reducing the role of central government, initially resulting in increased unemployment and contributing to inner-city riots. The successful war to re-take the Falkland Islands from Argentina. Deregulation, privatisation and giving local authority tenants the right to buy their homes. A tough approach that, ultimately, improved the economy. Her status as a world leader, friendship with US President Ronald Reagan and contribution to the ending of the Cold War. Almost constantly being at odds with, albeit a supporter of, the European Union.\n\nJames Callaghan Labour 1976-1979\n\nBorn: 27 March 1912 , Copnor, Portsmouth, Hampshire. Died: 26 March 2005, Ringmer, East Sussex. Buried: Ashes scattered at the base of the Peter Pan statue outside the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London.\n\nBackground: Leonard James Callaghan James Callaghan grew up in difficult financial circumstances, largely due to his father’s early death. He attended Portsmouth’s Northern Grammar School, but was unable to afford university and joined the Civil Service, becoming a tax inspector and trade union official. He served in the Royal Navy during World War Two, leaving with the rank of Lieutenant and was elected Member of Parliament for Cardiff South in 1945. Harold Wilson appointed Callaghan Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary and (in his second administration) Foreign Secretary. He became leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister in 1976, following Harold Wilson’s sudden resignation."
