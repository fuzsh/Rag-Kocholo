        "text": "John Major (born March 29, 1943, London, England) is a British politician and public official who was prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1990 to 1997.\n\nThe son of a former circus performer and vaudeville manager, Major left school at age 16 to help support his family. He worked as a bank accountant for some years and eventually tried to enter politics, twice standing unsuccessfully for Parliament in 1974. He gained a seat in the House of Commons during the Conservative Party landslide of 1979, and his subsequent rise through that party’s ranks was rapid, owing in part to the interested patronage of high party officials from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on down. He became a junior minister in 1986 and chief secretary to the Treasury in 1987, and in July 1989 Thatcher appointed him to the important cabinet post of foreign secretary. Major had hardly been in this post three months when another cabinet reshuffle resulted in his becoming chancellor of the Exchequer. In this post he was well placed to contend for the leadership of the Conservative Party (and the post of prime minister) in November 1990 when Thatcher unexpectedly announced her intention to resign. With Thatcher’s unofficial support, Major won a three-way contest for the party leadership and consequently became prime minister of Great Britain on November 28, 1990. Major shared most of Thatcher’s conservative views, but, as prime minister, he showed himself to be more pragmatic and consensus-oriented in his approach. In April 1992, in the first general elections after his ascendancy, the Conservatives won, confirming his leadership.\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nUnited Kingdom: The government of John Major (1990–97)"
