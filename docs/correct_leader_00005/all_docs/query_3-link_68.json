        "text": "In the early years of the Revolutionary War, Benedict Arnold was one of George Washington’s most accomplished field generals. His legacy today is quite different, with Arnold branded the most notorious traitor in American history, after a failed gambit to trade the vital American outpost at West Point for cash resulted in his defection to the British side.\n\nA Fighting General\n\nA pharmacist by trade, the 34-year-old Arnold joined the rebellion in 1775. After organizing an assemblage of volunteers, he seized munitions from the New Haven arsenal and led his group northward to fight the British.\n\nIn May 1775, Arnold’s forces eventually clashed with the British at Fort Ticonderoga – nestled along the shores of Lake Champlain in northern New York – capturing valuable artillery stores. He achieved this with relative ease, providing the Continental Army with its first victory of the war and a desperately needed boost of confidence. In what would later turn out to be one of the great ironies of the Revolutionary War, Arnold captured Fort Ticonderoga with the assistance of a British spy. The heavy cannons taken by Arnold proved instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston the following year. His exploits, however, were not without cost. In December 1775, he suffered the first of two serious leg injuries during a failed attack on British-occupied Quebec, Canada.\n\nThe Battle of Ridgefield\n\nBy early 1777, Arnold was back in the field, leading his troops in a blocking action against a British advance in Connecticut. The enemy force, commanded by William Tryon, the British Governor of New York and recently appointed general, was acting on intelligence from a British spy about a suspected Continental Army weapons depot.\n\nThe British achieved their objectives but at great cost, suffering twice as many casualties as the Americans in the ensuing skirmish. Arnold narrowly escaped death, having two horses shot out from under him on the battlefield.\n\nBrewing Troubles\n\nArnold’s patriotism and battlefield exploits earned him little reward. Though the British surrender at Saratoga was hailed throughout the colonies, other officers took credit for Arnold’s tactical success and diminished his role. As a further insult, Congress refused to promote Arnold in rank, elevating several junior officers above him.\n\nAs Arnold gradually became more disaffected, his wife, Margaret “Peggy” Shippen, was immersing herself in lavish spending, deeply indebting the general. Adding to the swirl of troubles, Arnold faced a court-martial on charges of misconduct and financial impropriety. Though he was largely exonerated, he received a stinging rebuke from Washington, fanning a deep-seated resentment. Bitter, indignant, and desperate for money, Arnold decided to turn away from his country, brokering a secret agreement to begin spying for the British.\n\nIn 1780, Washington summoned Arnold to rejoin the Army as a top commander, but the disillusioned general had other plans. He requested and was granted command of the American defenses along the Hudson River at West Point. The fortified outpost held much strategic value, controlling lines of communication and transportation between New England and the rest of the country."
