        "text": "When John Major returned to his childhood haunts in Brixton for that famous 1992 election broadcast, he looked distinctly uncomfortable. Dressed in an Armani suit, he was filmed buying kippers at the market before sweeping past his former family homes in a chauffeur-driven car. Then he spotted his parents' old house in Burton Road and his self-consciousness slipped away. \"It's still there,\" he whispered, straining against his seatbelt. \"It is, it is ... it's still there.\"\n\nIt's no secret that he loathed the experience and commentators assumed he was ashamed of his background. The son of a trapeze artist, music-hall entertainer and purveyor of garden gnomes, he was painted as a complex man full of insecurities, suppressed rage and an educational and social chippiness he could never overcome. But not for the first time, perhaps, the pundits misread the signs.\n\n\"I wasn't embarrassed about my background at all, but I was concerned about the privacy of my family,\" he says. \"I'm very proud of what my parents achieved and what they stood for. They didn't have much, but in many ways they were richer than most. But it's perfectly true that I didn't wish to do the Brixton video. I thought the idea was corny, but I was persuaded by Chris Patten and others.\" He laughs gently: \"Everyone said that famous line was fake, but it wasn't. It was absolutely genuine. I thought the house had been redeveloped.\"\n\nNow, as if to prove his doubters wrong, he has placed his parents firmly centre stage in his new book, My Old Man, a homage to his father and the music-hall tradition. But today I suspect that family ties are the last thing on his mind.\n\nIt seems his lot in life always to be overshadowed by meddlesome women. When he was prime minister, it was his \"backseat driver\" Margaret Thatcher. Now it's his former lover Edwina Currie who is also hard on the publicity trail promoting her latest volume of diaries. Indeed, on the day we meet she has revealed more intimate details of their past relationship and the headline, writ large across a national newspaper, reads: \"John Major was a sexy beast.\"\n\nMajor has suggested we meet in the plush surroundings of the Goring Hotel in Belgravia, central London, a stone's throw from Victoria Station. When I arrive, he is having his picture taken in a neighbouring room and there is a large reception committee. Heading the pack is his chief of staff, a commanding woman who, I suspect, is fiercely loyal to her boss, not to mention a publicist and two Special Branch officers. I knew I'd be here to talk showbusiness, but I didn't realise I'd be playing to an audience.\n\nMajor, habitually dubbed the grey man of politics, is today resplendent in a sharp suit and designer specs. If today's headline is bothering him, he shows no sign of it and bounds into the room before firmly shaking my hand. At 69, he looks very much the elder statesman.\n\nBut his beginnings, by his own admission, were very different. Major never really knew his father, Tom Major-Ball, who died shortly before his 19th birthday, and wishes he'd asked more questions. He was, he says, Victorian to the core; loving but remote \"with all the virtues and vices of the age into which he was born\".\n\nFrom 1901, Tom spent nearly 30 years on the road as a music-hall artist, for much of that time the proprietor of his own show. He cut his teeth working in circuses and travelling galas, but in 1902 formed a double act with a singer and dancer called Kitty Grant, whom he later married – performing acrobatics, baton-twirling, patter, comic duets and comedy sketches. They became known as Drum and Major, and topped the bill at big halls such as the Leeds City Varieties. Forty years later, Major was the name on his son's birth certificate.\n\nBut Kitty wasn't John Major's mother. That distinction fell to Gwen Coates, a Lincolnshire girl who joined the company as a dancer. She stepped into Kitty's shoes when a steel girder from a safety curtain struck the unfortunate woman on the head. On her death bed, Kitty asked her to look after Tom and Gwen married him a year later.\n\nAs a boy, Major soon realised his parents were more exotic than those of his friends. For a start, they were much older and often mistaken for his grandparents. But they made no attempt to blend into their suburban surroundings, often reprising their stage routine in the back garden. Did they embarrass him? \"Yes, a bit,\" he says fondly. \"But in retrospect, what does it matter? I wouldn't have swapped them for anything.\"\n\nTom and Gwen had three children; John was his mother's \"just-in-time\" baby. \"My father was 64 when I was conceived, my mother 38, which was late for babies in the 1940s. I think she was very ill when I was born – and so was I. There was some suggestion that neither of us might survive.\"\n\nHis father was the maypole around whom the family danced. \"I knew him only as an elderly man, but his word was law and he could be quite severe. I came home one day, having finished second in an English exam, and rushed in to tell him. He simply commented that if I'd worked a bit harder, I'd have finished first. But he was never unkind. He often saw the ironic, foolish side of life and was a spectacularly good raconteur.\" He smiles: \"And so far as I was able to find out, most of his stories were true.\"\n\nTom wasn't the most practical of men. He made and lost a fortune several times, but his luck ran out in his early 70s when he lost his savings in a business venture and had to sell their modest but comfortable family bungalow in Worcester Park, south-west London.\n\nBankrupt, they moved into two rooms in Brixton owned by \"Uncle Tom\", who Major later discovered was, in fact, his half brother, the result of his father's affair with a married woman 50 years before. His parents never told him who he really was. \"My father was too lofty to explain, and my mother would have moved heaven and earth to protect me from that sort of thing.\"\n\nIt was a claustrophobic existence, though his father, long used to theatrical digs, quickly adapted. \"There was my father, mother, sister and myself, a dog and the odd caged bird,\" he says [his elder brother, Terry, had by now moved out]. \"We shared an ancient cooker on the landing with an eccentric neighbour and the communal loo was three doors down. But there are still people who live like that – and worse – so I'm not screaming hardship.\"\n\nHis parents inhabited a Micawberish world in which – somehow, sometime – all would be well. But it hardly ever was. \"It was extremely painful for our father, who was a proud man, to find himself bedridden, bankrupt, most of his dreams destroyed and knowing that he depended for his livelihood on a tiny pension and the help his children could provide. But there was never any question that those debts shouldn't be repaid, and we treated it as a collective responsibility. What I didn't know was that my mother often borrowed money from my half brother's wife.\"\n\nIronically, it was his mother, \"a Peter Pan figure who never quite grew up\", who shielded his father. \"Her world centred on him and he accepted her care as his right. In this, if in little else in life, he was a lucky man. It was a special relationship. There were a lot of years between them, but you can't define attraction or the emotions that bring people together. They are mixed, varied and not always easy to understand.\"\n\nIt's tempting to see Tom as a dreamer who failed to face up to his responsibilities, but Major quickly puts me straight. \"No, he just didn't care about money. Anyone who reads the book will discover this was pretty typical of music-hall artists. My mother was much better with money and would hoard what little there was to see us through.\"\n\nIt's obvious that young John adored his mother – he often bought her presents with his hard-earned pocket money. His father may have dominated the family, but his mother was at its heart. \"When something threatened the nest, she'd stamp her foot and everybody wheeled in behind her. It happened rarely, but when it did, it was pretty clear who was running the show.\"\n\nGwen bestowed all her hopes on her younger son, but at a price to him. \"She always wished to know exactly what I was doing, who I was with and what I was going to do next,\" he says without reproach. \"I've called it being possessive, but it was also huge interest. To a substantial extent, she was living her life through her youngest child.\n\n\"When she was quite ill, I took her to Spain. In truth, she was like a fish out of water and pretended to like all that wretched hot weather. But what she really liked was the fact that I had cared enough to invite her.\"\n\nHis mother's death in 1970, after a long illness, came as a surprise but his father's decline eight years before seemed inexorable. When Tom's health deteriorated, he took to his bed and his young son became his audience, listening in awe as he sang the songs and recited the monologues from his music-hall days. The bond between youth and age was very strong.\n\nSomehow, word of his father's plight spread and \"careworn and often shabbily dressed\" strangers arrived at their door, former music-hall performers of his father's vintage. Old stories were resurrected and tears often flowed.\n\nInevitably, the curtain had to fall. \"I was with him as he died,\" Major writes movingly in his autobiography. \"I was sitting by his bed and felt the warmth leave his hand. For a man of the theatre, who loved the dramatic, it was a peaceful end.\"\n\nIt was to her younger son that his mother turned instinctively in her grief. \"She clung to me as though she would never let go,\" he writes. \"She knew the show must go on, but her smile was never again so bright.\" I read these words aloud and his eyes fill with tears. I ask if he wishes me to stop. \"No, no ... that's OK,\" he says with quiet dignity.\n\nPoignantly, his parents never lived to see him become prime minister, though his greatest regret is that he wasn't able to share his prosperity and buy his mother new clothes. What would they have made of his achievements? \"My mother would have claimed it was what she had expected all along. My father would have been proud, but wondered why I had gone into politics and where the instinct had come from. We didn't talk about politics at home, though my elder brother and sister said he always blamed the Attlee government for the difficulties his little firm got into in the 1940s and 1950s.\"\n\nHis background, more classically Labour than Conservative, inevitably changed his outlook. \"It was useful because I saw things I wouldn't have seen, though it often made life quite awkward because my natural instincts were quite adrift from the free-market instinct of a typical Tory. One of the things that upset me most was when some colleagues on the right started being censorious about single mothers and I got the blame. They were emphatically not my views and couldn't have been, given my background.\n\n\"I thought I could do something different from any Conservative prime minister before me. But I couldn't. I was trapped with a socking great recession. Shops were closing, people were losing their homes – all the things I went into politics to avoid – and I was almost powerless to do anything about it. And then, after handing over the best economy in generations, I watched other people spend the money. So, was that frustrating? You bet it was.\"\n\nHe never succeeded in shaking off his grey image, and his father's colourful background was often used as a stick with which to beat him. Seemingly, even he came to believe the stereotype, once flatly telling an interviewer: \"Maybe I am just grey and ordinary, like they said.\"\n\nBut it's hard to reconcile the monochrome Major of folklore with the man before me now, whose emotions are rarely far from the surface. Perhaps the image was too simplistic? \"Most images are,\" he says, but adds: \"Who would have thought, those people who deal solely in image, that I was so interested in theatre and ballet and opera? There's always been a lot of ho-hoing behind the hands about me leaving school with three O-levels. What no one has bothered to say was that as soon as I could read, I read everything. And I qualified as a banker in the evenings after I left school.\"\n\nThis will sound chippy in print, I warn him. \"I know. I've had to live with that for a long time,\" he says calmly. \"But who cares? I'm no longer public property, so I no longer care what they think.\""
