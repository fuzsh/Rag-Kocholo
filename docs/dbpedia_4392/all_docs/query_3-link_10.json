CUHK possesses geographical and cultural advantages to spearhead various aspects of China research, with over 200 faculty members and a good number of centres and institutes devoted to various aspects of China Studies.\n\n2) Innovative Biomedicine\n\nWith an ageing population in many parts of the world and the sporadic emergence of global infectious disease threats, biomedical research is essential to defending, upkeeping and enhancing public health. CUHK is a world leader in genetic, genomic and precision medicine. It is a pioneer in, among other things, non-invasive prenatal testing, cancer liquid biopsies and genomics of cancers common in Asia.\n\n3) Information and Automation Technology\n\nInformation technology pervades all aspects of human life. CUHK is a leading institution in Asia in machine learning and AI research. It has attested expertise in data networks, information coding, network security, big data analytics, robotics, financial technologies, optimisation, renewable energy, optical communications and computer-aided design automation, and biomedical imaging.\n\n4) Environment and Sustainability\n\nWith the world facing a climate emergency, CUHK aims to position itself as a global thought leader in research on environment and sustainability in densely populated and highly mobile cities, as well as a global hub in computational approaches to environment and sustainability research. The University’s sustainability research is anchored in a commitment to advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nCUHK is also the leader of several research projects under selected Areas of Excellence being allocated preferential funding by the University Grants Committee of Hong Kong.\n\nResearch Institutes and Centres\n\nCUHK has established multiple research institutes and centres to support interdisciplinary research on a local, national and international level. There are 300 research institutes to date. CUHK has recently founded six InnoHK Centres specialising in health, biomedicine, robotics and artificial intelligence at the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks, the territory’s research incubator, under the Hong Kong Government's InnoHK initiative, combining expertise from CUHK and partners from prestigious global universities, to help position Hong Kong as a global powerhouse of innovation connecting the world with the rapidly emerging research and innovation ecosystem of the Greater Bay Area.\n\nCUHK’s research quality can be further demonstrated by the establishment of five State Key Laboratories entrusted by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China. The University has also been collaborating closely with eminent institutions for higher education and research that are helping to advance knowledge in a variety of subject areas and addressing some of the world’s challenges.\n\nResearch, Innovation and Entrepreneurship\n\nCUHK focuses on integrating research, innovation and entrepreneurship into a dynamic and productive continuum, a superhighway that enables the translation of research into tangible benefits and the delivery of innovation to the world.\n\nCUHK has seeded many start-ups and successful spinout companies. CUHK faculty members and alumni have founded four unicorns*.\n\nThere are also successful collaborations on professional, medical and social innovations with the government, non-governmental organisations, academic institutions and private companies in China and overseas to further the goals of maximising the impact of research and innovation on the global community.\n\n*including SenseTime (founded by Prof. Tang Xiaoou, Sean), SmartMore (founded by Prof. Jia Jiaya Leo), GeneHarbor (founded by Prof. Wang Jun) and Lalamove (founded by alumnus Mr. Shing Chow)\n\nResearch Support\n\nDedicated teams have been set up to render practical assistance to CUHK researchers in translating research output into positive societal impact. The Office of Research and Knowledge Transfer Services (ORKTS) provides professional services for patent filing, and recruits angel and venture capitalists for start-ups. The Office of Innovation and Enterprise (OIE) connects CUHK researchers with appropriate partners, industry and government to bring research to the market for the benefit of society. The Office for Greater Bay Area Developments works in collaboration with governments of the GBA node cities to fuel innovation development and promote collaborations between Hong Kong and mainland China.\n\nApart from generous funding and support schemes to facilitate research and knowledge transfer, CUHK faculty members can tap into grants offered by mainland China through CUHK Shenzhen Research Institute in Shenzhen wholly-owned by the University, which serves as a pivotal base for conducting research, training and technology transfer to complement national development plans for the Greater Bay Area."
