        "text": "Universiade Park is located in the Universiade New Town area of Longcheng Subdistrict, Longgang District. It stretches from the Universiade New Town Red Line in the north, borders the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) in the south, extends westward to the boundary between Shenzhen and Dongguan, and connects to the Universiade Sports Center in the east, forming an ecological zone that runs through the entire central Longgang area.\n\nUniversiade Park is a large-scale sports and ecological park that was built as part of the facilities for the Universiade. It integrates elements of commemoration, leisure, sports, gatherings, and exhibitions. It's positioned as a \"sports and ecological park themed around health and vitality, seamlessly integrated into the natural landscape of mountains and waters.\"\n\nLandscape Corridors: Within the park, there are three distinct and characteristic landscape corridors. These include the \"Ecological Conservation Corridor\" along the western forested area and reservoir, the \"Universiade Commemorative Corridor\" adjacent to the northeast side of the Universiade Sports Center, and the \"Dynamic Fitness Corridor\" expanding from the existing Longgang Sports Center on the southeast side. Additionally, there is the \"Core Ecological Experience Area\" in the central low-lying terrain, forming an overall landscape pattern known as the \"Three Axes, One Core.\"\n\nUniversiade Book Bar: Citizens can read books here and enjoy leisurely reading time. While sitting inside the book bar, visitors can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the U-shaped lake and a sea of bougainvillea flowers they view through the floor-to-ceiling glass windows.\n\nU-shaped Lake: Located next to the Universiade Book Bar, this lake's design inspiration draws from the emblem of the 2011 Shenzhen World University Games \"Joyful U.\" Additionally, its shape also resembles the letter \"U\" in \"UNIVERSIADE\" (World University Games).\n\nBougainvillea Flower Sea: The bougainvillea flower sea along Longfei Boulevard in Universiade Park covers an area of approximately 13,800 square meters. During the peak bloom of the bougainvillea flowers, clusters of vibrant pink flowers create a dazzling sight that extends endlessly as far as the eye can see. Strolling through this sea of flowers brings a refreshing sensation, reducing the heat and adding a sense of leisure. It provides a moment of tranquility, allowing those of us accustomed to urban life to find peace in nature.\n\nEcological Lawn: With an area of approximately 36,000 square meters, it features a park tent relaxation area. During weekends and holidays, citizens can leave behind the worries of life and work, pick up a frisbee, bring along a kite, and on the large lawn shed some sweat, burst into smiles, and relish joyful moments.\n\nUniversiade Park is an important component of the Pearl River Delta greenway network. The park's \"greenway\" system has a total length of approximately 7 kilometers, following the construction of distinctive landscape structures such as the Shenxian Ridge Reservoir, ecological experience area, Flower Mountain & Flower Sea, Diexi Valley, cycling arena, tennis center, public golf course, and the Universiade Sports Center. Among these, there is a dedicated 3-kilometer leisure path for bicycles, incorporating natural elements such as mountainous terrain, reservoirs, and streams within the area."
