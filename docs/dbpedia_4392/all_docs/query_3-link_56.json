        "text": "The 2024 Shekou Food Festival is coming!\n\nFrom August 9th to 11th, for three consecutive days, Shenzhen Shekou invites you to a feast that combines gourmet food, trending toys, intangible cultural heritage, and folk customs.\n\nCome and check out the \"Shekou Flavor\"!\n\nLocation: Shekou Wanxia Center (Haijingjie Phase II), the intersection of Shenzhen Bay Merchants East Road and Houhaibin Road, Nanshan, Shenzhen\n\nYummy! Yummy!\n\nThe food festival covers a wide range of representative Shekou flavors, from time-honored brands, such as Huangli Yangjiang Snacks, Jiahua Snacks, Muxing Beef Offal, Chaojing Fermented Tofu Chicken Wings, to international cuisine. In addition to exquisite coffees and rich beers, you can enjoy the most authentic intangible cultural heritage tea drinks here, including Shekou Second Fishery Village Kading Tea, and Oil Tea from Longsheng, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.\n\n\"Long Table Banquet\" will be set to offer you a taste of Longsheng specialty foods. You can win an admission ticket by participating in the check-in stamping activity and correctly answering the prize-winning question.\n\nIntangible Cultural Heritage\n\nYou will have the opportunity to experience the charm of intangible cultural heritage from Shekou and Longsheng. You can admire the colorful traditional clothing, clothing batik skills, and elegant Hakka costumes, represented by Hakka blue shirts, kerchieves, skirts, and shoes, allowing you to understand the totemic representations of these two places over thousands of years.\n\nThe intangible heritage exhibition will feature Longsheng Long Drum Dance and Long Hair Dance, Cantonese opera, and Hakka mountain songs, bringing you the unique musical style of the Lingnan Region.\n\nThe ancient hair care recipe of the \"World's Number One Long Hair Village\" will be revealed! What kind of shampoo can make the hair 1.7 meters long without split ends or hair loss? Why is an 80-year-old person's hair black? For those with hair troubles, don't miss out.\n\nDIYï¼†Clothes\n\nYou can DIY intangible heritage crafts, such as bamboo wind chimes, lacquer fans, and mother-of-pearl brooches, enjoying the joy of creation. A free trial of intangible heritage clothing will allow you to travel through time. Let food and beauty coexist, and make this unique memory eternal.\n\nAgriculture Products\n\nThe unique geographical location of Longsheng has nurtured high-quality agricultural products. Tea oil, rice, tea, monk fruit, and other products from Longsheng will be sold at the event to satisfy the needs of the public in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.\n\nCitywalk routes in Shekou\n\nOn August 9th, four awesome tourism routes in Shekou will be released, which can provide a \"micro-vacation\" destination for busy urbanites and meet their diverse needs, such as leisure entertainment, dining, shopping, hotel vacation, and art appreciation. Check-in spots include the Shekou Bay West Leisure Belt, Shekou Flavor Council Shops, Tea and Coffee Routes, Shekou Ocean Science Popularization Museum, Shekou Township Museum, and Nanshui Village History Museum.\n\nBy the way, you can get a consumption coupon on-site. With it, consumption deduction is available in any stall. Only a limited number is provided, so it's first come, first served!\n\nFind Nanshan: A new column opens in August 2024.
