        "text": "The WTA has suspended its future tournaments in China and Hong Kong, as questions linger over Peng Shuai, the tennis pro who initially disappeared after she accused a Communist Party leader of sexual assault in social media posts.\n\nPeng resurfaced last month in appearances with Chinese officials, but it was unclear how freely she was able to speak.\n\n“While we now know where Peng is, I have serious doubts that she is free, safe and not subject to censorship, coercion and intimidation,” Steve Simon, the chief executive of the WTA, said in a statement.\n\nThe tour called for the Chinese government to allow Peng, 35, to travel and speak freely and to investigate the sexual assault allegation she made against Zhang Gaoli, a former vice premier of China.\n\nThe tour generally holds its season-ending tournament in Shenzhen, and holds eight other tournaments a year in China.\n\nDespite the women’s tour’s actions, there are still numerous international sporting events scheduled to take place in China over the next year. Much is unknown — about Peng and about how other organizations might react or adjust their events, some of them months in the future.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
