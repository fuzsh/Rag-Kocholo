        "text": "For years, foreign businesses that wanted to reap the riches of the Chinese market have honoured one tradition — don't get political.\n\nTo draw the ire of the Chinese Communist Party was to hurt your own profits.\n\nEveryone from the US National Basketball Association to the Arsenal Football Club has offended the Chinese government and paid a heavy price.\n\nBut one sports organisation is standing up to the rising superpower and refusing to back down.\n\nWomen's Tennis Association (WTA) chief Steve Simon is putting everything on the line to defend his star player.\n\nAnd it's not clear if authorities in Beijing know what to do next.\n\nA long history of vanishing celebrities\n\nUntil last month, tennis player Peng Shuai had transcended sport in China and was a fully fledged celebrity.\n\nBut then she posted serious sexual assault allegations against a senior member of China's political elite to social media site Weibo.\n\n\"Even if it is like an egg hitting a rock, or if I am like a moth drawn to the flame, inviting self-destruction, I will tell the truth about you,\" she said of her alleged abuser Zhang Gaoli.\n\nZhang has not responded to her allegations.\n\nHer post was scrubbed from China's censored internet within 20 minutes, and Peng swiftly disappeared.\n\nShe is not the first Chinese celebrity to suddenly disappear after falling afoul of the government.\n\nIn 2018, China's highest-paid female star Fan BingBing vanished for months after she was accused of tax evasion.\n\nAnd ubiquitous celebrity technology chief Jack Ma has rarely been seen in public since he criticised Chinese regulators.\n\nPeng's circumstances should be seen as the latest in a series of brutal crackdowns where no-one is invulnerable, according to John Delury, professor of Chinese Studies at Yonsei University.\n\n\"It's part of a pattern of an increasingly repressive atmosphere,\" he said.\n\nWhat Peng has working in her favour — and what took Beijing by surprise — is that someone sprang into action.\n\n'Prove that Peng is free'\n\nThe WTA sounded the alarm as soon Peng appeared to retreat from public life and they were unable to contact her.\n\nBeijing attempted to downplay Peng's disappearance and released an email purportedly written by the player to Steve Simon in which she retracted her sexual assault allegations and insisted she was \"resting at home and everything is fine\".\n\nUnconvinced, Simon threatened to pull the WTA's business from China unless the country could \"verifiably prove that Peng is free and able to speak without interference or intimidation\".\n\nA video of Peng dining with friends and her coach was then released by Chinese state media, but something about it felt off for Simon.\n\nLast week, he suspended all tennis tournaments in China, including Hong Kong.\n\nIt was a bold move by the organisation.\n\nChina currently hosts 11 WTA tournaments every year and Shenzhen was supposed to host the finals from 2022 until 2030.\n\nWhy the WTA did what the NBA could not\n\nThe WTA is by no means the first sporting organisation to be involved in a spat with the Chinese state, but it may be the first willing to actually take a costly stand.\n\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) has had a series of altercations with China since Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted — and then deleted — his support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong in 2019.\n\nThe NBA issued a grovelling apology and legendary player LeBron James slammed Morey as \"either misinformed or not really educated on the situation\".\n\nDespite the backdown, China wasn't satisfied.\n\nChina's state-run television broadcaster CCTV banned the NBA — a move estimated to have cost the league around $US400 million ($557.8 million).\n\nThe WTA may have had no choice but to stand up to China, according to Yun Jiang, a senior research officer at the Australian National University.\n\n\"China didn't disappear or arrest members of the NBA,\" he said.\n\n\"It was about members of the NBA criticising China. But they are not Chinese people, so they're not under the jurisdiction of China anywhere.\"\n\nThe WTA, founded by Billie Jean King, was structured to give a greater voice to female players and its current structure still reflects this.\n\nOf the eight-person board, three positions are held by players.\n\nIs this a turning point?\n\nDespite China's attempts to censor Peng Shuai's allegations, it's still generating heat both inside and outside the country.\n\n\"It is still being talked about despite censorship. Some people are very good at avoiding censorship,\" Yun Jiang said.\n\n\"There is still a lot of support for her as well inside China.\"\n\nPart of the attention comes down to the power of Peng's celebrity, and part of it is the timing of her allegations.\n\nWe are just three months out from the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the United States, Australia and Lithuania have all announced a diplomatic boycott of the event, citing human rights abuses.\n\nChina has repeated claimed that is \"against the politicisation of sport\" when queried about both the WTA suspension and the diplomatic boycott of the winter Olympics.\n\n\"I think China does care,\" said Yun Jiang.\n\n\"It does care about its international reputation.\"\n\nHowever, the current pressure is unlikely to change the outcome for a woman making serious claims of sexual abuse.\n\n\"It is a positive message the [WTA are] sending, especially to to its members,\" said Yun Jiang said.\n\n\"I don't think the Chinese Government or the Chinese Communist Party is going to suddenly back down."
