Professor Pan has been examining quantum physics for two decades, he is the Executive Vice-President of the University of Science and Technology of China, and the Director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences‚Äô Center for Excellence in Quantum Information and Quantum Physics. As one of the pioneers in experimental research in quantum information, he has significant influence in the fields of quantum optics, quantum information, and quantum foundations. On 16 August 2016, the world‚Äôs first quantum satellite Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS), named Micius, was launched. Professor Pan once remarked \"Micius is a great ancient scholar in optics, while the technologies our research team uses for quantum communication and quantum satellite are based on light or photons. Naming this quantum experimental satellite after Micius not only pays due respect to this prodigious ancient optical scientist but also demonstrates the self-confidence of our country in scientific research.‚Äú Citation of Professor Pan Jianwei: https://bit.ly/4feRw2W Learn more about the honorary doctorate awardees with CUHK in Focus: https://bit.ly/4cF5ae2 #CUHKHonoraryDoctorate #thechineseuniversityofhongkong #cuhk\n\nCUHK researchers have won 11 #awards at the Silicon Valley International Inventions Festival (SVIIF) 2024, including five Gold Medalsü•áand three Silver Medalsü•à.

This contribution is intended to support academic research and talent cultivation in pure mathematics over the next five years. The ‚ÄúGlorious Sun Postdoc Research Scheme‚Äù and ‚ÄúGlorious Sun Visiting Scholar Scheme‚Äù will be launched following the signing of the agreement. The former will enable the annual recruitment of two postdoctoral students for each university, supporting their progression to full-time research or teaching positions while engaging in ongoing research in pure mathematics. The latter initiative will back the four institutions in tackling the world‚Äôs unresolved mathematical mysteries in partnership with mainland and overseas mathematicians through short-term visits or collaborations funded by the scheme. Additionally, each university is encouraged to host or co-host at least two academic conferences every year to promote knowledge exchange amongst local, mainland and international scholars.
