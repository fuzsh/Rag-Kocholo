Making a choice is difficult because there is a lot of options.\n\nThings You Want to Know Before you Study in China\n\n1. What does a Chinese campus and dormitory look like?\n\nA campus in China is big, vast. Imagine yourself as a mini-city, including shops and restaurants. Sometimes the campuses are near the city, sometimes a whole lot outside it. A Chinese campus is walled off, and you can only get in it through a gate. When you study in China, you could sleep in a dormitory on campus. That means you share a room with other students. Sometimes you are offered your room at the start of your Master’s degree, but bachelor students almost always share a dormitory with other students.\n\nIn China, they have separate dorms for international students and Chinese students. In the past, the dorms for international students were often more luxurious, but nowadays, the standards are increasingly the same. Every dormitory in China has a janitor. There is a curfew: you have to be indoors for a certain period, and in some dormitories the light also automatically goes out at a standard time.\n\nAre you in China a little longer and want to move? Just off-campus, the culture is often also lively, and usually, living space is available there. However, it is often a bit more expensive, and it is a significant administrative job to get it done. For every change in residence status, you have to go to the police station to register it.\n\n2. What can you expect from Chinese lessons and Teaching Methodology?\n\nIn China, compared to education at universities in western countries, you have many contact hours. You make long days, and in the middle of the day, you have two to three hours of lunch break. You, as a student, are expected to listen. Group assignments and discussions held among students, but this happens much less than in western countries. In China, the emphasis is on knowledge transfer and less on educating students to critical, academic thinkers. The tests you get there are focused on reproduction.\n\n3. How is the interaction between students and lecturers in Chinese higher education?\n\nIn China, teachers have absolute authority, and students are not supposed to show enough respect. This will change: there are more and more young, fresh teachers in Chinese education with whom dealing is less rigid. Teachers and their families often live on campus in China. As a student, you often come across teachers outside the classroom. In China, it is much more common to play tennis or eat with your teacher. Although the proverbial distance between student and teacher is more significant because of the more definite hierarchy in China, work and private life are therefore much less separate than in most western countries. In China, the teacher will share his or her Wechat with the students in the first class.\n\nYou must know that China is ruled by one party: the Chinese Communist Party. In China, it is not common for people to criticize the party. Criticizing can be punished. If you’re going to study in China, I’m sure you want to learn a lot from the country and ask for things. Then it is good to know that what is negotiable depends on quite a bit on the context. If a teacher is in the office, he or she will not speak critically any time soon. The teacher will answer as the Communist Party likes to see it. But if you go to dinner with your teacher one-on-one in the evening, he or she can just tell you something else.\n\nStudying in Shanghai\n\nShanghai is one of the most exciting cities in the world and China’s largest city. The town is the embodiment of China’s industrialization, of modernization and economic growth. Shanghai has grown from fishing and textile village to one of the largest port cities in the world in the last century and a half. It is a popular destination for tourists, students and businesspeople.\n\nThe Bund\n\nIn the Pudong business district, which emerged after Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms in the 1990s, you’ll find some of the world’s tallest skyscrapers. On the other hand (west side) of the Huangpu River, a side branch of the Blue River in central Shanghai, you will find the Bund. This is a one-and-a-half kilometer long promenade along the banks of the Huangpu River. Here are dozens of historic buildings in all kinds of different architectural styles, from Gothic to romance. The historic buildings on the Bund have all been renovated.\n\nThe Bund used to be Shanghai’s political, economic, and cultural center. Consulates, banks, companies, and offices of various countries were located here. The contrast with the skyline of Pudong situated on the other side of the river makes the Bund special. It is an example of how old and new can go together well.\n\nShanghai is also a city where East and West meet. For example, you can shop in some of the most exclusive designer shops in the world, but also traditional Chinese shops in the old city.\n\nLife in Shanghai\n\nShanghai has about 24 million inhabitants. The city has proliferated over the past decade, in line with economic development. For many Chinese workers, it’s a popular place to seek happiness. Moreover, Shanghai has become a beautiful city for international traders.\n\nShanghai’s official language is Mandarin, as it is all over China. The language spoken in the Jangtsekiang delta is the Wu language. In Shanghai and its surroundings, the Shanghai dialect is spoken.\n\nClimate\n\nShanghai has a humid, subtropical climate. Summers are hot and humid, and winters are cold, with temperatures below freezing. The average temperature in July is about 25 degrees, and in January 1 degree Celsius. In winter, there is generally no, to little snowfall, and in June and July, heavy downpours are not unusual. The best periods to visit Shanghai are in spring and autumn; it’s hot but not as hot as it was in the summer months.\n\nSelecting your Favorite City to Study in China\n\nShanghai is just one of the many great cities in China. To find your ideal city, you should make a list of the most appealing cities in China to you. Then, when you have made your list, you should do more research on each of those cities to have the best result. Information about each Chinese city could fill thousands of articles. Therefore, it is vital to create a strategy on how to select your favorite cities."
