        "text": "Yang Hongxia said she wants to change the existing resource-intensive process of training large language models into a decentralised, machine-learning paradigm.\n\nEducation Bureau did not confirm such plans but says group will reveal its work results in due course.\n\nIll-fated ‘brand refresh’ may have cost Chinese University of Hong Kong some HK$4 million, but it paid a heavier price in the controversy that followed.\n\nClinical study involving more than 350 patients finds accuracy levels for artificial intelligence-based software are as high as 81 per cent.\n\nThe recruitment comes as the Hong Kong government makes efforts to transform the city into a technology hub by leveraging the research capabilities of its top universities.\n\nProposals by HKUST and Imperial College London may offer training in fields currently unavailable and come at a time when city needs more medical professionals.\n\nChildren with at least one bipolar parent are 7½ times more likely to develop social anxiety, an early sign of the condition, researchers say.\n\nA student advisory council in every secondary school would let young people be heard. We don’t need to settle for reductive understandings.\n\nSchool is third tertiary institution to announce move to increase number of medical students amid shortage of doctors.\n\nStop masking true scale of budget deficits with bond proceeds. Hongkongers are not stupid. They know the government must balance the books.\n\nStudents have ‘very high chance’ of getting university spot if they score 20 out of 35 in their five best subjects for entrance exam, NGO says.\n\nThe Post looks at how a third institution will address the city’s medical problems and boost innovation.\n\nInnovation and technology chief Sun Dong says AI application developed for government use, but will gradually be opened to all residents."
