        "text": "MSA has been recognized by two major international authoritative organizations, CIS and Cognia. It has officially become a Cognia-certified school, and has successfully passed the most important Preparatory Evaluation certification stage of CIS.\n\nCouncil of International Schools (CIS) is currently the most influential and authoritative accreditation body for international school accreditation. The CIS certification demonstrates to the world the high quality of MSA, and the potential for professional performance and continuity in international education.\n\nCognia, formerly known as AdvancED, is the world's largest non-profit international school accreditation authority. Cognia certification will allow graduates of MSA to apply to universities in most countries and regions around the world except mainland China, and apply as an American school without being restricted by their student status.\n\n178 students have graduated from MSA in the past 5 years, and 55 graduates will enter their dream universities for further study in June this year.\n\nThey went to a bigger and farther world, including comprehensive universities and art colleges such as Emory University, Rice University, Washington University St. Louis, New York University, Columbia University (Trinity College dual degree program), University of California, Berkeley, UCLA, University of Minerva, Rhode Island School of Design, Berklee College of Music, in the USA; Imperial College London, University College London, University of Edinburgh, in the UK; University of Toronto, in Canada, Emlyon Business School, in France, University of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, and University of Sydney, in Australia. Graduates also matriculated into top American liberal arts colleges such as St. John's College, Reed College, University of Richmond and Macalester College."
