Location is convenient for taking metro, but not friendly for those taking A21, need to walk quite far. Good stayed for four of us. However the toilet also come out urine smell after using, no matter how many times we flushed. After cleaned by cleaner still the same issue. Another issue about bed bugs, i met this issue first time, didn't know this was due to beg bugs until I felt the itchness. So I decided to inform trip.com about the compensation from the hotel. Unfortunately Royal Plaza Hotel rejected by reason of not inform during the stay. My friend who stayed closer date with me, her kid also got bed bugs bites in this hotel. Anyway, I am happy with trip.com's customer service Jenny who assisted me to approached the hotel although there was nothing help, but she was able to claim some coin for me from trip.com. We won't choose Royal Plaza Hotel anymore in the future.\n\nShow More\n\n3.9/5\n\nGGraceSummerThe building is split into two blocks which require you to go above your floor in a lift and cross over a terrace and go down 2 floors to arrive at the 4th floor hotel room in which we stayed. Unusual and most inconvenient when it came to moving heavy bags and luggage. No baggage concierge is available. A separate stairwell enables access to the ground floor via a private entrance/exit. If flights of stairs are a problem for you this could be an issue, otherwise it will require you to embark on the unusual route of having to go up first to go down if choosing to use the lift if your room happens to be in the separate block. The room itself was pleasant and styled in an appealing old fashioned manner, albeit very cramped with not enough storage space we found. The addition of a small balcony enabling a space to smoke with our double standard room was fantastic. Being able to be outside without leaving your room was very welcome. This was the sole feature (as well as laziness) as to why we extended our stay in the hotel past our initial booking check out date. However management tried to increase the rates the longer we stayed not honouring the prices offered by booking sites only offering 'take now' or lose the room and non-negotiable walk-in prices at the reception. (Don't be fooled), when you would otherwise expect rooms to offer some form of discount the longer you stay. Front of house staff were very friendly and helpful and the efficient cleaners who unfortunately don't clean under the beds for some peculiar reason. However the rest of the room was well maintained daily. Some of our facilities were broken however, the outdoor balcony light didn't work, the tiny sink slender man would have trouble using and the built in usb chargers in the wall did not work at all requiring us to buy one and plug into a regular power socket in order to charge devices. Steady WiFi connection. A handy safe to store valuables, a washing machine on the first floor, hang dry as the dryer was terrible or alternatively using a launderette was a more practical option. As well as a microwave and portable oven for public use downstairs next to the reception. A medium sized smart television with Amazon prime included. A kettle and tea and coffee for two is provided daily as well as a handy sparsely stocked mini fridge whose contents were never touched. However these flaws were not a deal breaker for us, although it could be for others. Wan Chai is also a very busy and noisy road. Soundproofing is not the best so if you are close to ground level noise pollution from pedestrians, buses, taxis, and general traffic as well as shops which advertise with megaphones during opening hours could be a major issue for those noise sensitive. Despite the mingles shortcomings we did find the room endearing and the location is absolutely fantastic and very accessible to many shops and food establishments (breakfast and dinner options on your doorstep), and even a friendly cheap! locals darts bar round the corner within staggering distance (casks darts bar). Ferry, MTR, bus stops and trams to central and causeway bay within short walking distance too. In all we both found we enjoyed our stay in the Mingle. I have no reservations about staying again due to its fantastic location and the provided balcony feature providing current room rates are competitive.\n\nShow More\n\n3.9/5\n\nAAnni43The hotel is well located between Chan Wai and Causeway bay subway stations. The room was at the 20th (last) floor with a nice view on the mountain. The negative point is that we were hearing the vibrations from the airco groups located on the roof (?). The room is clean but extremely old like many hotels in HK so ok it was expected. There are only old plugs and only HK type (normal we are in HK) but not well located so if you place the adapter to the one close to the bed it can't fit... The bath tap is also extremely old. I was afraid to break it each time I took a shower. But water was warm and in quantity so no problem. The breakfast is a buffet but food/dishes were not well prepared. For instance the bacon was overcooked and very hard or looks like if it has been prepared the day before. The cheese looked like if it stayed too long outside. Nothing appetising :s\n\nShow More"
