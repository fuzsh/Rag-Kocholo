        "text": "Yang Hongxia said she wants to change the existing resource-intensive process of training large language models into a decentralised, machine-learning paradigm.\n\nHKU president Xiang Zhang had sought Kenneth Chen for the vice-president role, but the candidate’s HK$5 million yearly package was rejected.\n\nSource says Kenneth Chen, who held Legco role since 2012, being considered for vice-presidency job, after previous incumbent sacked last December.\n\nEducation Bureau did not confirm such plans but says group will reveal its work results in due course.\n\nIll-fated ‘brand refresh’ may have cost Chinese University of Hong Kong some HK$4 million, but it paid a heavier price in the controversy that followed.\n\nClinical study involving more than 350 patients finds accuracy levels for artificial intelligence-based software are as high as 81 per cent.\n\nThe recruitment comes as the Hong Kong government makes efforts to transform the city into a technology hub by leveraging the research capabilities of its top universities.\n\nProposals by HKUST and Imperial College London may offer training in fields currently unavailable and come at a time when city needs more medical professionals.\n\nChildren with at least one bipolar parent are 7½ times more likely to develop social anxiety, an early sign of the condition, researchers say.\n\nReaders discuss the path forward for students to whom the Jupas route to university is closed, and how schools can better cultivate student well-being.\n\nSchool is third tertiary institution to announce move to increase number of medical students amid shortage of doctors.\n\nStop masking true scale of budget deficits with bond proceeds. Hongkongers are not stupid. They know the government must balance the books."
