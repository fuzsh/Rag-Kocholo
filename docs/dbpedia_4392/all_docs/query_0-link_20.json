        "text": "Public university in Kowloon, Hong Kong\n\nThe City University of Hong Kong (CityU) is a public research university located in Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong. It was founded in 1984 as the City Polytechnic of Hong Kong and became a fully accredited university in 1994.\n\nThe university currently has nine main schools offering courses in business, science, engineering, liberal arts and social sciences, law, and veterinary medicine, along with the Chow Yei Ching School of Graduate Studies, CityU Shenzhen Research Institute, and Hong Kong Institute for Advanced Study.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nCity University's origins lie in the calls for a \"second polytechnic\" in the years following the 1972 establishment of the Hong Kong Polytechnic. In 1982, Executive Council member Chung Sze-yuen spoke of a general consensus that \"a second polytechnic of similar size to the first should be built as soon as possible.\"[3] District administrators from Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan lobbied the government to build the new institution in their respective new towns.[3] The government instead purchased temporary premises at the new Argyle Centre Tower II in Mong Kok, a property developed by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation in concert with the then-Argyle station. The new school was called City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, a name chosen among nearly 300 suggestions made by members of the public.[4]\n\nThe new polytechnic opened on 8 October 1984, welcoming 480 full-time and 680 part-time students.[5] The provision for part-time students contributed to high enrolment, with the quota being filled almost immediately.[5]\n\nA tract of land on the former site of a village named Chu Koo Chai [yue] was chosen for the new campus.[6] The architectural contract to design the campus was won by Percy Thomas Partnership in association with Alan Fitch and W.N. Chung.[7] It was originally slated to open by October 1988.[8] The first phase was officially opened by Governor Wilson on 15 January 1990, and boasted 14 lecture theatres and 1,500 computers.[9] By 1991, the school had over 8,000 full-time students and approximately 3,000 part-time students.[10] The second phase of the permanent campus opened 1993.[7]\n\nThe school achieved university status in 1994 and the name was changed accordingly.[11]\n\nIn 2023, to welcome the start of the new academic year, CityU launched CityU Heroes, stories about outstanding alumni, students and faculty that demonstrate CityU's determination to pursue academic excellence and illustrate how to realise their dreams and give back to society through learning-centric pedagogy. The tunnel connecting the CityU campus to Festival Walk proudly champions the stories of the CityU Heroes. Visitors passing through the new-look thoroughfare can access QR codes to learn more about the 12 featured CityU Heroes.\n\nCampus\n\n[edit]\n\nCity University of Hong Kong occupies an urban campus located in Kowloon. The official address is Tat Chee Avenue,[12] Kowloon Tong, Kowloon. Administratively, it is part of Sham Shui Po District.[13] Certain buildings of the main campus are marked as located in the Shek Kip Mei neighbourhood instead of Kowloon Tong in the official address book, such as Nam Shan Building.[14]\n\nThe main campus is connected to the Festival Walk shopping centre and the Kowloon Tong MTR station, which serves the East Rail line and Kwun Tong line of Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway (MTR) system. It is also adjacent to Shek Kip Mei Park and Nam Shan Estate.\n\nThe main campus covers around 15.6 ha (39 acres).\n\nCityU Campus\n\nMain Entrance from Tat Chee Avenue\n\nLogo\n\nBuildings\n\nSwimming Pool, 2019\n\nKirin sculptures near the main entrance\n\nYeung Kin Man Academic Building (Academic 1)\n\n[edit]\n\nYeung Kin Man Academic Building, formerly known as Academic 1,[15] was also called \"Academic Building\"[16][17][18][19] before the completion of Academic 2. It was completed in stages from 1989 to 1994. The floor area is 63,000 m2 (680,000 sq ft), and includes 116 laboratories, 18 lecture halls, classrooms and canteens. The building is divided by colour, in order of purple zone (P), green zone (G), blue zone (B), yellow zone (Y) and red zone (R). Except for the lecture halls, all classrooms and laboratories are numbered by their colour divisions.\n\nYeung Kin Man Academic Building, CityU\n\nEntrance to YKM Academic Building\n\nYKM Academic Building, 2019\n\nYKM Academic Building, 2019\n\nYKM Academic Building, 2019\n\nYKM Academic Building, 2019\n\nLi Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Academic Building (Academic 2)\n\n[edit]\n\nLi Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Academic Building, previously called Academic 2,[20] was designed by architecture firm Aedas. With a total area of 20,900 m2 (225,000 sq ft), it is located on the slope behind the sports complex on the campus, and is equipped with a resource centre, design room, computer room, language practice room, and student dining hall, classrooms, lecture halls, audio-visual rooms, multi-purpose activity rooms and sky gardens.\n\nLi Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Academic Building, CityU\n\nAC2 Void 1, 2011\n\nMulti-functional room, 2019\n\nMain Entrance, AC2, 2011\n\nAC2, 2019\n\nLau Ming Wai Academic Building (Academic 3)\n\n[edit]\n\nLau Ming Wai Academic Building was called Academic 3.[21] The academic building project is divided into two phases. The first phase is a 20-storey high-rise building, and the second phase is a five-storey low-rise building with a total usable area of 20,500 m2 (221,000 sq ft). It is the tallest building in CityU. Facilities include a 600-seat auditorium, classrooms, information technology laboratories, millimetre wave state key laboratories, restaurants, learning shared spaces, and administrative offices.[22] The building was designed by the Hong Kong architectural firm Ronald Lu & Partners. The third and sixth floors are connected to the Li Dak Sum Yip Yio Chin Academic Building, while the fifth to seventh floors are connected to the student dormitory and Shaw Creative Media Centre. There are also terrace gardens on the 6th, 7th and 8th floors.\n\nLau Ming Wai Academic Building, CityU\n\nRun Run Shaw Creative Media Centre\n\n[edit]\n\nRun Run Shaw Creative Media Centre was completed in 2011.[23] It was designed by Daniel Libeskind cooperating with Leigh and Orange Ltd., and received several awards for its design.[24] The building houses the university's School of Creative Media, the Centre for Applied Computing and Interactive Media and the computer science, media and communication, and English departments.[25]\n\nRun Run Shaw Creative Media Centre\n\nRun Run Shaw Creative Media Centre\n\nEntrance\n\nEntrance\n\nLevel 5\n\nJockey Club One Health Tower\n\n[edit]\n\nHu Fa Kuang Sports Centre was a five-storey sports centre which houses a multi-purpose hall and four practice gymnasiums for badminton, basketball, volleyball, martial arts and dance, and other activities. In May 2016, the sports hall roof collapsed due to the weight imposed by a new green roof placed on top.[26]\n\nConstruction work commenced in November 2017 on the Jockey Club One Health Tower at the site of the former sports hall. The work is expected to be completed in 2025.[27]\n\nCityU International Centre\n\nA ground-breaking ceremony was held for the CityU International Centre on 29 November, 2021. Scheduled to open at the end of 2023.\n\nGovernance\n\n[edit]\n\nEstablished in 1984 under Chapter 1132 of the Laws of Hong Kong (City University of Hong Kong Ordinance),[28] CityU is one of the eight statutory universities in Hong Kong.\n\nLike other statutory universities in Hong Kong, the chief Executive of Hong Kong acts as the chancellor of CityU. Prior to the Handover, this was a ceremonial title bestowed upon the governor of Hong Kong.\n\nCouncil\n\n[edit]\n\nThe council is the supreme governing body of the university. The chief executive of Hong Kong has the power to appoint 15 of the 23 council members, seven of which are named directly and eight appointed upon recommendation of the council. The chief executive can also appoint the chairman, deputy and treasurer; the vice-chancellor is in turn appointed by the council.[29]\n\nSenate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe senate serves as the supreme academic body of the university and is responsible for deciding and reforming the university's academic policies. It is mainly composed of academic staff members but also includes the two representatives of the Students' Union and a representative of CityU Postgraduate Association.[30]\n\nAcademic organisation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe university's teaching units are grouped under 10 colleges and schools, offering over 150 postgraduate, undergraduate taught programmes.[31]\n\nCollege/School Departments College of Business\n\nDepartment of Accountancy\n\nDepartment of Economics and Finance\n\nDepartment of Information Systems\n\nDepartment of Management\n\nDepartment of Marketing\n\nDepartment of Management Sciences\n\nCollege of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences\n\nDepartment of Chinese and History\n\nDepartment of Media and Communication\n\nDepartment of English\n\nChan Feng Men-ling Chan Shuk-lin Language Centre\n\nDepartment of Linguistics and Translation\n\nDepartment of Public and International Affairs\n\nDepartment of Social and Behavioural Sciences\n\nCollege of Engineering\n\nDepartment of Systems Engineering\n\nDepartment of Architecture and Civil Engineering\n\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering\n\nDivision of Building Science and Technology\n\nDepartment of Computer Science\n\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering\n\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering\n\nDepartment of Materials Science and Engineering\n\nCollege of Science\n\nDepartment of Chemistry\n\nDepartment of Mathematics\n\nDepartment of Physics\n\nDepartment of Biostatistics\n\nJockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences\n\nDepartment of Biomedical Sciences\n\nDepartment of Neuroscience\n\nDepartment of Infectious Diseases and Public Health\n\nDepartment of Veterinary Clinical Sciences\n\nSchool of Creative Media School of Data Science School of Energy and Environment School of Law Chow Yei Ching School of Graduate Studies\n\nRankings and reputation\n\n[edit]\n\nOverall Ranking\n\n[edit]\n\nCityUHK was ranked #62 worldwide in the QS World University Rankings 2025, #82 worldwide in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024, #120 worldwide in the USNEWS Global Rankings 2022-2023, and #101–150 worldwide in ARWU 2023.\n\nCityUHK was #72 worldwide in terms of aggregate performance across THE, QS, and ARWU, as reported by ARTU 2023.[41]\n\nIt was previously ranked 49th and 48th worldwide in QSWUR 2018 and 2021, respectively.\n\nYoung University Ranking\n\n[edit]\n\nCityUHK is #4 worldwide in the QS \"Top 50 Under 50\" 2021 and #4 worldwide in THE Young Universities Rankings 2024.\n\nSubject/Area Ranking\n\n[edit]\n\nQS Subject Ranking\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024:\n\nSubject (only subjects ranked among top 150 are listed) CityUHK's World Rank Data Science & Artificial Intelligence 39 Linguistics 51 Law 54 Materials Science 62 Business & Management Studies 68 Engineering - Electrical & Electronic 70 Accounting & Finance 70 Computer Science & Information Systems 77 Mathematics 86 Engineering - Mechanical, Aeronautical & Manufacturing 113 Economics & Econometrics 114 Environmental Sciences 144 English Language & Literature 101-150 Modern Languages 101-150 Politics & International Studies 101-150 Sociology 101-150\n\nIn the QS World University Rankings by Broad Subject Area 2024:\n\nBroad Subject Area CityUHK's World Rank Social Sciences and Management 100 Engineering and Technology 147 Arts and Humanities 151 Natural Sciences 183 Life Sciences and Medicine 401-450\n\nTHE Subject Ranking\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Times Higher Education World University Rankings by Subjects (2024):\n\nSubject CityUHK's World Rank Engineering 52 Law 45 Business and Economics 48 Physical Sciences 65 Computer Science 64 Social Sciences 98 Life Sciences 99 Arts & Humanities 126–150\n\nGRAS (ARWU subject rankings)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2023 Global Ranking of Academic Subjects (GRAS):\n\nSubject (only subjects ranked among top 50 are listed) CityUHK's World Rank Library & Information Science 1 Automation & Control 8 Energy Science & Engineering 9 Metallurgical Engineering 10 Nanoscience & Nanotechnology 17 Management 21 Materials Science & Engineering 21 Public Administration 23 Civil Engineering 27 Computer Science & Engineering 29 Instruments Science & Technology 32 Transportation Science & Technology 32 Telecommunication Engineering 36 Chemistry 43 Electrical & Electronic Engineering 45 Mechanical Engineering 46 Business Administration 47 Chemical Engineering 47\n\nGraduate Employability Ranking\n\n[edit]\n\nCityUHK graduates were ranked 89th worldwide in the QS Graduate Employability Rankings 2022.[42]\n\nStudent life\n\n[edit]\n\nStudent residence\n\n[edit]\n\nStudent residences are located on Cornwall Street, near Lau Ming Wai academic building.

Students and alumni launched a petition against the decision while faculty and noted international writers issued an open letter questioning the reasoning behind the closure.[63] Canadian novelist and faculty member Madeleine Thien, writing in The Guardian, was among those who attributed the decision to censorship and diminishing freedom of expression in Hong Kong.[64]\n\nCollapse of roof of sports hall\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 20 May 2016, the roof structure of the Chan Tai Ho Multi-purpose Hall (the Sports Hall) in the Hu Fa Kuang Sports Centre (the Sports Centre) collapsed. Two staff members of CityU sustained minor injuries and a third individual was in shock. The venue was originally scheduled to hold an annual celebration banquet on that night for 700–800 CityU student athletes.[65] The investigation report released by the Buildings Department said three factors contributed to the collapse: (1) a leveled layer of material applied to the surface of the roof structure being thicker than the original design, (2) the laying of greenery on the roof, and (3) large puddles of water.[66] CityU did not seek separate advice from an independent surveyor to conduct feasibility studies and designs before tendering out the project to consultants or contractors. A report by CityU's investigation committee concluded that the surveyor of the green roof project was to be held liable for the collapse despite his repeated denial of involvement in the works.[67] It was reported that CityU vice-president Sunny Lee Wai-kwong (who oversaw the Campus Development and Facilities Office) escaped liability while technical staff would face disciplinary action.[67]\n\nQS ranking dispute\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2017, CityU was accused of providing misleading information to Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) to boost its university rankings.[68][69] The QS review, however, confirmed that the data submitted by CityU was accurate. CityU would submit the case to an external audit firm to verify the data.[69] In January 2018, CityU issued a statement stating that it had commissioned an accounting firm to complete an independent review of the student data declared by CityU and confirmed that it found no declarations that did not meet the scope of QS requirements.[70]\n\nChinese Judge Meeting on campus\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 20 October 2018, National Judges College under the Supreme People's Court of China uploaded an article to its website about a meeting held by \"provisional branches of the Chinese Communist Party\" at CityU. According to the article, 39 party members, including Huang Wenjun, president and party secretary of the National Judges College and 11 non-party members, attended the meeting and gave a lecture. Huang told attendees that judges must take a \"clear-cut stance\" on politics, increase their political sensitivity, learn socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era led by the Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, and should fight against \"incorrect words and deeds.\"[71][72] Despite the fact that the party branches were formed by Chinese judges who studied at CityU, Professor Lin Feng (associate dean of CityU's law school) who liaised with the college in organizing the courses, said the lecture \"had caught the faculty by surprise\". Pro-Beijing legislator Priscilla Leung Mei-fun, an associate law professor at CityU, refused to comment, claiming that she was not aware of the arrangement.[72] Spokesperson for CityU said it maintains political neutrality and that no activities involving politics should be held on campus.[71]\n\nIntervention of students' academic autonomy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2019, Professor Tan who was teaching a digital marketing course sent an email to the students, which warned the students not to deliver any political messages in class presentations or they will be given zero marks. The e-mail caused dissatisfaction among students.[73] Pro-democracy group Frontline Technology Workers pointed out that the presentations were relevant to the course although it was touching the social taboo.[74] They also highlighted academic journal articles which discussed the relationship between politics and marketing.[75][76][77] Students' Union questioned university's promise on academic autonomy.[78]\n\nNew campus security measures\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 2019, CityU barred all students from entering the campus and the student hostel area as some of the facilities had been damaged by the protestors during the Siege of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. On 30 November, CityU reopened the campus but staff and students were required to present their identity cards to gain entry.[79] By December, hoarding panels had been built around the whole campus and turnstiles had been installed at all entrances. CityU issued a press release, stating that the vast majority of members of the Senate and the Court of CityU supported the security measures and the installation of an electronic access system.[80] The Student Union stressed that it opposed and had voted in the Court's meeting against the installation of turnstiles. The Student Union quoted an earlier questionnaire survey conducted by CityU Staff Association, stating that most of the respondents agreed that \"university campuses should be opened to the public.\" The Student Union has repeatedly expressed objections to the university's policy of prohibiting public access to the campus and urged the university to consult teachers and students on the issue.[80]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nCollege of Business, City University of Hong Kong\n\nCommunity College of City University\n\nDemocracy Wall (City University of Hong Kong)\n\nEducation in Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
