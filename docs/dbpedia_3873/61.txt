The Technology team represented The Infatuation in its acquisition of Zagat, the restaurant review brand, from Google. Adding the iconic dining resource brand to The Infatuation’s powerful website, mobile app, messaging and social ecosystems will help continue the company’s mission to create the largest, most influential and most useful restaurant discovery platform in the world.

The Infatuation and Zagat will operate as two distinct brands, with individual platforms, and distinct purposes and points of view. Specifically, The Infatuation will retain its editorial-first focus, producing high-quality situational reviews and guides while continuing its groundbreaking work in mobile and social media.

A Goodwin client since 2013, The Infatuation is a platform and resource dedicated to offering curated, trustworthy restaurant reviews and guides via its website, newsletter, mobile app, Instagram network and text message recommendation service. With a focus on relatable, situational content, The Infatuation reaches over 3,000,000 people per month, worldwide. The company covers major cities in both the U.S. and abroad, including New York, Los Angeles, London, Chicago, San Francisco, Austin and Seattle.
