All members of this multi-national Commando had to pass the Green Beret commando course at Achnacarry in Scotland and the book begins by describing this training. In addition to the six national contingents, the author reveals that there was a secret additional troop, drawn mainly from East European Jews who had either been exiled or had escaped Nazi occupation and persecution.\"--Jacket."
