        "text": "PLPS/OL Products\n\nPremium Label & Packaging Solutions (PLPS) has won a Gold in the \"Best Use of Cold Foil (Label or Carton)\" category at the Foil & Specialty Effects Association's (FSEA) 31st Annual Gold Leaf Awards.\n\nThe winning shrink sleeve label was produced for OL Products for its Infatuated Tanning Lotion and was printed at Overnight Labels, the company’s Deer Park, New York plant.\n\nThe label's deceptively simple black background with red inverted triangles reveals a 3D kaleidoscope effect when it hits light.\n\nPLPS used multiple processes to achieve the look, beginning by laying down the black and red ink.\n\nOnce that was completed, PLPS applied a holographic Pillars of Light cold foil and a second coat of black and white ink.\n\nIn the final step, the web was turned to apply a silk screen UV to the red triangles to boost its dimensionality.\n\n\"We are always driven to maintain a level of excellence in everything we print, particularly when a job demands intricate details,\" said Leslie Gurland, VP of sales and marketing at PLPS. \"This win is a testament to our unwavering commitment to quality and the artistry of label printing.”\n\n“We had a record number of entries in our 31st annual FSEA Gold Leaf Awards, which highlighted a variety of print embellishment technologies,” said FSEA executive director Jeff Peterson. “The creativity and new uses for labels, cartons, direct mail, and other applications continue to amaze me.”"
