        "text": "Image\n\nHometown: Pekin, IL\n\nYear/Graduation: Sophomore, Spring 2026\n\nConcentration: Environmental Science and Management\n\nWhy Illinois? – What factors helped contribute to your decision to attend the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign?\n\nI picked Illinois at an early age, and it was one of the best choices I ever made! I always loved the big and diverse feel of the university. I come from a small town, where everyone knows everyone and everyone has a similar background, but when I came to UIUC (University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign), it was the exact opposite. I loved how everyone was different from each other and how everyone had their own stories to tell.\n\nFrom my first visit, I really loved the atmosphere and the people around the campus. UIUC also was one of the only universities that offered exactly what I wanted to study and would allow me to have a successful career in the future.\n\nWhy NRES? – Specifically, why did you choose to study Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences?\n\nI decided to study NRES (Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences) as it would allow me to pursue my passion for being a voice for the environment. Growing up, I always loved nature, but I didn’t think that I would ever be able to “study.” It was no one from my town who did anything like that when I was growing up. As I grew up, I did my own research and exploring, and I was soon introduced to the world of environmental science.\n\nFrom there on, I spoke frequently with those in the field and thus my infatuation with environmental science only grew from there. From the spreadsheets of data and prints, I grew to love putting all the little pieces together to save the world."
