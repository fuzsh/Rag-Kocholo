        "text": "About\n\nJames is an X-Alps 2023 athlete and one of the few Canadians ever to compete in this race. Hike and fly racing is the perfect combination of his two passions, as well as the realization of his lifelong infatuation with flight. His solid performances in the X-Pyr and X-RedRocks over several years have demonstrated his competitive ambitions, but just as importantly, he loves relaxing flying for the joy of it. James is also integral to the paragliding community in Canada, having served in many leadership and mentorship roles.\n\nInterview\n\nDo you remember your first flight? How was it?\n\nThe second my feet left the ground for the first time in Algodonales, Spain, I knew I found my ultimate calling. As I was flying away from the mountain, I remember thinking that this felt completely natural and I never wanted it to end! There was no looking back after that.\n\nFor which moment do you fly?\n\nI love the evening session after a full day of cross-country flying, when there are long, buoyant glides that seem like they will go on forever. And skimming the tree tops and cliffs on a beautiful mountain top that is totally inaccessible by any other means. I also love flying with friends. The only thing better than flying itself, is sharing the experience.\n\nYour three top flying areas?\n\nMy 'home' site of Pemberton, BC is a rough and rugged adventure flying paradise! However, our winters can be atrocious, so it's best to migrate south to Valle de Bravo, Mexico during our off-season. Monte Cornizzolo in Northern Italy will also always hold a special place in my heart as it's where I discovered XC flying.\n\nWhat are you doing on a day that is not flyable?\n\nUsually dreaming of flying! Lately, all my free time outside of work has been planning and preparing for the X-Alps. This includes planning all the logistics, studying routes, and of course, a huge amount of time dedicated to endurance training. In peak of my training, I'm training for 4-6 hrs per day, several days a week. I also have two little boys and an amazing partner that I love spending time with.\n\nMost important paragliding successes?\n\nI consider success in paragliding as any flight that you won't stop telling your friends about! It's ultimately about the enjoyment factor. On the competition side, last year I tied with Aaron Durogatti on the third day of the X-Red Rocks in Utah and was 7th overall. In the X-Pyr 2022, I was in 11th place.\n\nWhy do you fly for ADVANCE?\n\nADVANCE's uncompromising quality and design are second to none. From the moment you unbox any ADVANCE gear, it's obvious that the workmanship and attention to detail are extremely high. All the way from my first IOTA many years ago, to the OMEGA X-Alps wings, I've loved the way they fly; precise, confidence-inspiring, and with excellent performance. I'm very fortunate to be flying ADVANCE in the X-Alps.\n\nWhat is your favourite food?\n\nI could eat tacos literally all day every day. And ice cream... if that counts as food!\n\nWhat is your favourite quote in life?\n\nYou miss 100 percent of the shots you never take. (Wayne Gretzky)"
