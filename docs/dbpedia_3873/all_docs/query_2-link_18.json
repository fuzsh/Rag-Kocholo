        "text": "You'll have many different types of relationships throughout your life. Most tend to be categorized as acquaintances, friends, family, romantic partners, sexual partners, work colleagues, or situational relationships. Each type comes with different expectations, benefits, and challenges.\n\nInterpersonal relationships are a vital part of life. They can range from close and intimate to distant and challenging. No matter the nature of the relationship, different types of relationships help form the social support network that is pivotal for physical and mental well-being.\n\nWhat Is a Relationship?\n\nA relationship is any connection between two people, which can be either positive or negative.\n\nYou can have a relationship with a wide range of people, including family and friends. The phrase \"being in a relationship,\" while often linked with romantic relationships, can refer to various associations one person has with another.\n\nTo \"be in a relationship\" doesn't always mean there is physical intimacy, emotional attachment, and/or commitment involved. People engage in many different types of relationships that have unique characteristics.\n\nBasic Types of Relationships\n\nRelationships typically fall into one of several different categories (although these can sometimes overlap):\n\nFamily relationships\n\nFriendships\n\nAcquaintances\n\nRomantic relationships\n\nSexual relationships\n\nWork relationships\n\nSituational relationships (sometimes called \"situationships\")\n\nThese different forms of relationships can vary greatly in terms of closeness, and there are also different subtypes of relationships within each of these basic types. Some of the different kinds of relationships that you might experience at some point in your life include the following.\n\nPlatonic Relationships\n\nA platonic relationship is a type of friendship that involves a close, intimate bond without sex or romance. These relationships tend to be characterized by:\n\nCloseness\n\nFondness\n\nUnderstanding\n\nRespect\n\nCare\n\nSupport\n\nHonesty\n\nAcceptance\n\nPlatonic relationships can occur in a wide range of settings and can involve same-sex or opposite-sex friendships. You might form a platonic relationship with a classmate or co-worker, or you might make a connection with a person in another setting such as a club, athletic activity, or volunteer organization you are involved in.\n\nThis type of relationship can play an essential role in providing social support, which is essential for your health and well-being. Research suggests that platonic friendships can help reduce your risk for disease, lower your risk for depression or anxiety, and boost your immunity.\n\nRomantic Relationships\n\nRomantic relationships are those characterized by feelings of love and attraction for another person. While romantic love can vary, it often involves feelings of infatuation, intimacy, and commitment.\n\nExperts have come up with a variety of different ways to describe how people experience and express love. For example, psychologist Robert Sternberg suggests three main components of love: passion, intimacy, and decision/commitment. Romantic love, he explains, is a combination of passion and intimacy.\n\nRomantic relationships tend to change over time. At the start of a relationship when people are first falling in love, people typically experience stronger feelings of passion. During this initial infatuation period, the brain releases specific neurotransmitters (dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin) that cause people to feel euphoric and \"in love.\"\n\nOver time, these feelings start to lessen in their intensity. People develop deeper levels of emotional intimacy and understanding as the relationship matures.\n\nCodependent Relationships\n\nA codependent relationship is an imbalanced, dysfunctional type of relationship in which a partner has an emotional, physical, or mental reliance on the other person.\n\nIt is also common for both partners to be mutually co-dependent on each other. Both may take turns enacting the caretaker role, alternating between the caretaker and the receiver of care.\n\nCharacteristics of a codependent relationship include:\n\nActing as a giver while the other person acts as a taker\n\nGoing to great lengths to avoid conflict with the other person\n\nFeeling like you have to ask permission to do things\n\nHaving to save or rescue the other person from their own actions\n\nDoing things to make someone happy, even if they make you uncomfortable\n\nFeeling like you don't know who you are in the relationship\n\nElevating the other person even if they've done nothing to earn your goodwill and admiration\n\nNot all codependent relationships are the same, however. They can vary in terms of severity. Codependency can impact all different types of relationships including relationships between romantic partners, parents and children, friendship, other family members, and even coworkers.\n\nSomeone who feels more comfortable being needed, for instance, may avoid focusing on their own needs by choosing a partner who constantly needs them.\n\nCasual Relationships\n\nCasual relationships often involve dating relationships that may include sex without expectations of monogamy or commitment. However, experts suggest that the term is vague and can mean different things to different people.\n\nAccording to the authors of one study published in the Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality, casual relationships can encompass situations such as:\n\nOne-night stands\n\nBooty calls\n\n\"Sex\" buddies\n\nFriends with benefits\n\nSuch relationships often exist on a continuum that varies in the levels of frequency of contact, type of contact, amount of personal disclosure, discussion of the relationship, and degree of friendship. The study found that people with more sexual experience were better able to identify the definitions of these labels compared to people with less sexual experience.\n\nCasual relationships are often common among young adults. As long as casual relationships are marked by communication and consent, they can have several sex-positive benefits. They can satisfy the need for sex, intimacy, connection, and companionship without the emotional demands and energy commitment of a more serious relationship.\n\nOpen Relationships\n\nAn open relationship is a type of consensually non-monogamous relationship in which one or more partners have sex or relationships with other people. Both people agree to have sex with other people in an open relationship but may have certain conditions or limitations.\n\nOpen relationships can take place in any type of romantic relationship, whether casual, dating, or married.\n\nThe likelihood of engaging in an open relationship also depends on gender and sexual orientation. Men reported having higher numbers of open relationships compared to women; people who identify as gay, lesbian, and bisexual were more likely to report previous engagement in open relationships compared to those who identify as heterosexual.\n\nSuch relationships can have benefits, including increased sexual freedom, and pitfalls, such as jealousy and emotional pain. Open relationships are more successful when couples establish personal, emotional, and sexual boundaries and clearly communicate their feelings and needs.\n\nToxic Relationships\n\nA toxic relationship is any type of interpersonal relationship where your emotional, physical, or psychological well-being is undermined or threatened in some way. Such relationships often leave you feeling ashamed, humiliated, misunderstood, or unsupported.\n\nAny type of relationship can be toxic, including friendships, family relationships, romantic relationships, or workplace relationships.\n\nSometimes all people in a relationship play a role in creating this toxicity. For example, you may be contributing to toxicity if you are all consistently unkind, critical, insecure, and negative.\n\nIn other cases, one person in a relationship may behave in ways that create toxic feelings. This may be intentional, but in other cases, people may not fully understand how they are affecting other people. Because of their past experiences with relationships, often in their home growing up, they may not know any other way of acting and communicating.\n\nFor example, according to one study, stress caused by negative relationships has a direct impact on cardiovascular health. Feeling isolated and misunderstood in a relationship can also lead to loneliness, which has been shown to have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health.\n\nDefining Types of Relationships in Your Life\n\nHow you define your relationship depends on various factors, including what matters to you and how the other person feels. To define your relationship, it can be helpful to ask a few questions:\n\nDo you have romantic feelings for one another?\n\nWhat does each person hope to get out of the relationship?\n\nHow much time do you want to spend together?\n\nWhere do you see the relationship going?\n\nAre you currently involved with or want to be involved with other people?\n\nFiguring out what matters to you and your partner is an important step in defining the type of relationships you are interested in having. You might find that you are both on the same page or discover that you want different things out of your relationship.\n\nHow to Keep Different Types of Relationships Healthy\n\nRegardless of how you define your relationship, there are important steps you can take to ensure that your connection is healthy. Strategies that can help include:\n\nShowing appreciation and gratitude\n\nCommunicating openly and honestly\n\nBeing affectionate and showing that you care\n\nMutual respect\n\nActively listening\n\nShowing interest in each other\n\nBeing supportive and encouraging\n\nFeeling empathy for each other\n\nSpending time together\n\nHaving healthy boundaries\n\nBeing trustworthy\n\nCommunication is often the single most important thing in a relationship. Good relationships are also marked by honesty, trust, and reciprocity. This doesn't mean that the relationship is purely transactional; it indicates that you naturally engage in a give-and-take that provides mutually beneficial support.\n\nTakeaways\n\nNo matter what type of relationship you have with another person(s), it is important for it to be a healthy one. Healthy relationships are characterized by trust, mutual respect, openness, honesty, and affection. Good communication is also a key factor.\n\nYou can take steps to improve your relationships with other people. Two helpful strategies are to let others know you care and show your appreciation.\n\nBut if a relationship is causing stress or shows signs of being toxic, look for ways to establish clear boundaries, talk to a therapist, or even consider ending the relationship if it is taking too much of a toll on your well-being."
