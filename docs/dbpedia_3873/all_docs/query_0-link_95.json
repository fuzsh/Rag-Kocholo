        "text": "Google is selling the Zagat restaurant review publishing operation to The Infatuation, a startup company in the same space that announced the deal yesterday. For those of us who are both foodies and data nuts, this is the best news since ... well, since Google announced it was buying Zagat from its original owners seven years ago. Since then, Google has neglected the Zagat brand, dragging it down almost into irrelevance. This new ownership could make Zagat relevant again even amid much stiffer competition.\n\nPhrases like \"this place is 28, 4, 10\" or \"that place is 14, 27, 20\" (Zagat ratings for food, decor, and service in restaurants) used to really mean something among restaurant-goers. They don’t anymore, and that’s a shame. “Where should we go for dinner?” is an eternal question in any city. Zagat, in its prime, cracked the code on how to answer that question.\n\nZagat's formula is powerful even compared with its competitors today. Yelp gives you lots of basic data about restaurants: where they are, whether they’re open now (unless it’s a holiday), what forms of payment they take, whether they’re “good for groups,” and what kind of food they serve. But this is the site that brings you such scintillating review comments as “1 redeeming quality. Lots of cleavage in the waitstaff” and “god this place was retarded,” not to mention millions of reviews that are fake and paid for by the owners or their PR agencies.\n\nEater tells you (and often determines) what the 38 trendiest places are in each city. This means you'll probably have a hard time actually eating in any of those places. You’ll be unable to get a reservation and will stand in line for hours. Then, if you try again a year later, the places will all be closed because their styles or ingredients are no longer trendy and the Instagram-your-meal crowd has moved on.\n\nSpeaking of Instagram, there’s Foodspotting. Foodspotting lets you view user-contributed photos of specific dishes at restaurants in your immediate vicinity or another location. This is great as a secondary means of research after you’ve done primary research from a more informative source.\n\nTripAdvisor is constructed so that people who want to review things have to put in more effort, making them more committed. They also are effective at rooting out paid fakes. So you get thoughtful, honest user reviews of restaurants … written by tourists who don’t know your city but sure do know their hotels.\n\nUrbanSpoon? An also-ran in the first place, now languishing in the U.S. market after its acquisition by India-based Zomato. OpenTable ? For reservations, yes, but not for the reviews or the ratings. Chowhound? Hardcore foodie audience, deep content, virtually impossible to search and navigate. New York Times ? Not (nearly) enough data; no mobile app. Dine? Pivoted to dating in 2016.\n\nWhat about Michelin? Michelin hasn’t made much of a dent in American food consciousness beyond restaurant biz insiders and jet setters who can afford to drop in at Eleven Madison Park one night followed by Arpège the next and Osteria Francescana the next. Its website is virtually unusable for restaurant search, and it doesn’t have a mobile app for restaurants.\n\nIn other words, no one else has cracked the code. (We'll talk about The Infatuation, Zagat's new owners, later on.)\n\nHow does Zagat do it? By soliciting reviews and ratings from volunteers, tallying the numbers, and using human editors to create pithy summaries of the crowdsourced reviews. This gives you the wonderful and unique combination of hard data on restaurants from serious eaters and an editorial voice. You have lots of data to search and sort; you trust the sources of that data because the people are committed and there’s no way to game the system, and you enjoy the review format.\n\nBack in the 1980s, Zagat -- which New York lawyers Tim and Nina Zagat originally created for use among their friends -- was the gold standard. Every foodie in NYC knew it by its narrow red paperback books. New issues came out every November, the anticipation was palpable, and the rankings in each new issue made news. It expanded to other cities in the U.S. and then abroad, and its notoriety grew with its geographic reach.\n\nCrowdsourcing became a thing in the mid-2000s; a few years after that, content services rediscovered curated crowdsourcing: human curation as a means for making masses of crowdsourced data comprehensible. Yet Zagat had figured out curated crowdsourcing twenty years before the term was coined. It was a characteristically American alternative to the hegemony of Michelin and its army of inspectors or individual restaurant critics.\n\nZagat even started to make inroads into the Paris dining scene beyond American tourists, confirming some hallowed standard-bearers of Parisian gastronomy while bursting a few bubbles and exposing some hidden gems. (The Zagats were even inducted into France's highly prestigious Legion d'Honneur earlier this decade.)\n\nThe Zagats took a deliberate approach in the digital age. They had been focusing on expanding the brand to hotels, golf courses, airlines, and other areas, and they didn’t have the in-house competence to build good websites or (eventually) mobile apps. For the latter, they partnered with an app development and distribution company called Handmark to offer Zagat To Go apps for mobile devices, starting with BlackBerrys. The apps were clunky, but they finally enabled people to sort and search all that data and to do so while traveling around. The revenue model was subscriptions for a few dollars a month.\n\nZagat gradually started updating the data for each city more frequently than once a year. It released iPhone and Android apps and finally integrated them with mapping features so that you could figure out directions, and with OpenTable so you could make reservations at participating restaurants. The progress toward continued relevance in the Internet age was slow but steady.\n\nThen Google acquired Zagat in September 2011 for a reported $151 million — short of the $200 million it tried to get three years earlier, but still a hefty sum for a niche publication. The deal was masterminded by Marissa Mayer, who was then in charge of Google’s growing location-based services. Her vision was to use Zagat to compete with the upstart Yelp, to expand Zagat data and integrate it with Google Maps and other location-based applications. Tech-savvy foodies were thrilled: if any company on earth knew what to do with all that data and how to present it in useful ways, it was Google.\n\nYet Google’s acquisition turned out to be Zagat’s peak moment rather than a new start. Zagat ratings data did get integrated with Google Maps … sort of … but that was about it. Google produced a new website and Zagat apps for Android and iOS, and made them all free, at first to anyone with a Google+ account, then to everyone. But — preposterously — they shrank the data down to nine cities.\n\nGoogle’s strategy was apparently to make Zagat into Yelp Lite: pointless “news” and social media features followed, and they jettisoned the signature 30-point rating system in favor of the prosaic five-star scale used by Yelp, TripAdvisor, OpenTable, UrbanSpoon, and so many others.\n\nZagat’s importance within Google soon fell victim to typical Silicon Valley behaviors such as short attention spans and frequent reorganizations. The beginning of the end came less than a year later, in July 2012, when Mayer departed Google to take the CEO job at Yahoo. The remaining Googlers weren’t really interested anymore; editorial employees were replaced with temporary contractors, and Google’s acquisition of the larger Frommer’s travel guide group from John Wiley & Sons overshadowed Zagat (even though Google sold it off to the Frommer family only eight months later).\n\nToday, Zagat suffers from a litany of handicaps. Although it has expanded back to 47 cities in North America (45 in the U.S. plus Toronto and Vancouver), its only international city is London. The five-point rating system is utterly generic, like yet another wine-rating site that uses Robert Parker’s 100-point system. Michelin’s three-star/fork-spoon/roly-poly-tire-man system and even the New York Times’s four stars are more distinctive.\n\nThe website and Android app are both buggy, hard to use, and insist on pushing the pointless editorial content at you before you can get to the ratings and reviews. Adding insult to injury, Zagat has been refreshing the app for Apple iOS devices fairly regularly, but it still hasn’t made good on its promise to update the app for the “home team” Android platform; the current Android app dates back to 2014.\n\nThe latest self-inflicted wound is the most recent update to the website, which dumbs down the search and filtering functions and limits the data (once again) to 38 cities. (Among the casualties: the hot dining destination of Pittsburgh, and the entire New York City metro area outside of NYC itself.)\n\nWorst of all, Google is now improving its location-based data independently of Zagat. Google constantly nags Android device users to submit metadata and photos of places they’ve visited, but none of this data makes it to Zagat. It promotes “Google ratings” that are on the same five-star scale but apply to any type of business and are different from the Zagat ratings (not to mention utterly irrelevant to foodies). In fact, Zagat data is no longer to be found anywhere on Google Maps, and Google stopped making it available to third-party app developers two years ago.\n\nAll of these limitations have diminished Zagat’s importance over the past few years. It would be unreasonable to expect Zagat to maintain complete dominance over the restaurant discovery scene today, given the explosion in mobile apps and the legitimately valuable features of some of them. Nevertheless, Zagat has been on a path to irrelevance.\n\nZagat’s profile in the media has suffered greatly in recent years. TechCrunch — in its only story on Zagat since Google's acquisition, until now — reported on the then-new iOS app in July 2016. It said that the previous version of the app had “a massively outdated user interface that made it seem like a holdover from an earlier era on mobile”; yet the old app still exists on Android. The hit 2000 play “Fully Committed,” a deft parody of NYC’s overheated high-end restaurant scene, staged a comeback recently; the show featured a Very Important Food World Person character which was Tim Zagat in the original run but changed to British master chef Heston Blumenthal in the Broadway revival.\n\nAn LA Weekly article complaining about the proliferation of lame new restaurant apps cites Yelp, Google, and OpenTable as useful, and doesn’t even mention Zagat. Only some food and lifestyle blogs’ lists of recommended restaurant apps still include Zagat. Urban Tastebud’s list doesn’t, nor does Mediaite’s or LifeHacker’s or RealSimple’s or MakeUseOf's or InsideHook's.\n\nYet the Zagat brand and formula of data and crowdsourced curation still have value to a certain audience. Zagat can have a much brighter future if it goes back to what made it great in the first place while incorporating the right set of digital features in its mobile apps. And The Infatuation is in a great position to make that happen.\n\nThe Infatuation is a startup that Chris Stang and Andrew Steinthal, both refugees from the music industry, began in 2009. Its original formula was rather like the old Gault-Millau Guides in France: a small group of self-appointed critics reviewing restaurants and assigning numerical ratings. The Infatuation added a couple of twists for the digital age: decimal points in the ratings to make them look \"data-driven\" even though only a small group of humans generated the data, a good mobile user interface with location-based features and practical \"this restaurant is good for ...\" metadata for searching and browsing.\n\nMore recently, The Infatuation has added various savvy social media features, such as human-generated restaurant recommendations by text message and Instagram feeds for the cities they cover. And its coverage has grown from seven U.S. cities two years ago to 18, including London, Sydney, Hong Kong, Paris, Mexico City, Barcelona, Cape Town, Rome, and Tokyo.\n\nThe Infatuation understands the synergies between human input and automation that make a great restaurant review service, and they know how to build good user experiences. And they don't appear to be interested in expanding to airlines, hotels, and golf courses, let alone general location-based data services. They're food people, focused on restaurants.\n\nIn other words, this could be the start of a great turnaround for Zagat and a boon to foodies everywhere. I'll finish with some suggestions for steps The Infatuation can take to save Zagat from oblivion:\n\nRestore the 30-point rating system. Google felt that it was alien and confusing to users. It might be if you’re also rating hotels and golf courses. But the 30-point system is not confusing to foodies. On the contrary: in the U.S. market, it has been more distinctive than Michelin’s iconography. Using everyone else’s five-star system might have fit into Marissa Mayer’s original plan to use Zagat as a source for all local business data, but it has damaged the brand. Zagat should not only restore the 30-point system but embrace it, by constructing cheeky marketing campaigns around it.\n\nLose the editorial content, other than the excellent hand-picked restaurant lists. Move those resources into marketing (for those cheeky campaigns about the 30-point system). Zagat's editorial voice is user review curation. That’s a great thing, and it’s enough.\n\nCharge users subscription fees (again).It’s apparently OK to do this now. We’ve learned that people who want quality content will pay for it. Figure out a limited freemium model a la Spotify and The New York Times. For example, the current app and website have very limited ways of searching and browsing the data as well as limited location-based features; many foodies would happily pay a few bucks a month for a Zagat Unlimited with powerful data features. (For example, no restaurant app has a good way of answering the question: \"We're taking a car trip; where should we eat enroute?\")\n\nLicense data to third-party services for additional revenue and exposure. Imagine foodie/travel articles in Saveur, Conde Nast Traveler, Travel+Leisure, or Food & Wine (or Frommer’s!) with built-in Zagat ratings and reviews."
