        "text": "Get a beautifully flushed and glowing complexion with Colour Veil. An innovative, hybrid blusher combining the intense pigment of a powder with the innovative properties of our best-selling Hydra Veil Primer. This blusher is a buildable pigment in a soft, jelly texture that feels refreshing on application and blends seamlessly. With self-levelling properties, this cheek colour ensures a fresh, airbrushed-effect with zero caking.\n\nPro Tip From Illamasqua Head Makeup Artist - Mel Barrese: Colour Veils are such a unique blusher, offering a combined power house of our iconic Hydra Veil Primer and Illamasqua blusher pigment. These gel blushers give you all the hydrating benefits of a cream blusher, but without a heavy residue. They blend easily onto skin and then set for all-day wear with a soft, satin finish. I love to apply on to the apples of the cheeks with a round, fluffy brush, blending out and building up colour in layers. Using a very small amount of foundation I then go around the Colour Veil to ensure a truly seamless blend of flush to the cheeks.\n\nTop Customer Reviews\n\nWhere reviews refer to foods or cosmetic products, results may vary from person to person. Customer reviews are independent and do not represent the views of The Hut Group.\n\nPerfect\n\nLooooooove this blusher. Only need a tiny bit on a fluffy brush and it's a gorgeous subtle colour. Bought in frisson and it's perfect. Will definitely buy again.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nLovely Light Blusher\n\nBought the slight darker colours this time. Very highly pigment , so only a little needed. Really pleased with the look and ease to apply.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nLovely Light Blusher\n\nLovely light texture, you only need a little which goes a long way but can easily built up.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nGood product\n\nEasy to use on the face and colour looks very natural.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nGorgeous colour and texture\n\nCannot get enough of this blusher. My first time using a gel formula. I do powder formulas usually or cream, but the gel is super cool addition to my collection. The only downside is it needs to sit on a flat surface. Otherwise the product moves around and collects on the lid like moisturisers would do. I therefore cannot travel with it.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nI'm hooked!\n\nThis blush is gorgeous! I need to collect all the colours now. You literally need a teeny dab and it lasts all day, I am so impressed!\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nColor Veil\n\nQuite nice, stays quite long...is not so great to apply....but anyhow....still very great product\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nMy favourite blush rn\n\nOh my Gosh, I love this blush SO much. It looks sooo pretty on my skin (even though I wear pinks so much more than peach). I’m literally obsessed I wanna wear it every day, but I like switching my colours up. It’ll last me SO SO long this one little jar. I literally just tap the surface of the jelly a few times and I get a nice amount of pigment- blend it with my fingers into my cheekbone area, and it’s gorgeous. Recommend for fair skin- it’s beautiful. I might get other colours but this one jar will last me at least 2 years I’m not even gonna lie.\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nColour veil blusher\n\nFrisson- I love this colour blush and the texture is amazing. It doesn't look horrible on your face and you only need the tiniest amount for the pop of colour that you need! This is the second colour veil I have bought now as well as enamour and its my go to blush :)\n\nWas this helpful?\n\nChefs Kiss\n\nWhen I say I uses these every day I mean it, whether adding a flush of colour to a bare face or a strong blush with a full face, these blushers are amazing! I have a few colours now but my all time favourite is Frission. The formula is so unique and works great alone or layers amazing with the powder blushers. (Top Tip: for a strong pop of blush use frission and layer the powder blush in nymph)\n\nWas this helpful?"
