Born Oct1924 and died Nov 2019.\n\nHockaday T. My grandfather reportedly helped fix airfields in France and Belgium following D Day. Stories relayed by my father describe regular sniper attacks targeting the front driver of convoys, usually the corporal, so promotion meant death until they agreed to rotate the front driver role. During one roadside ambush, Thomas took cover in a ditch. His stein gun jammed and, in a fit of rage and frustration, he threw the gun in the direction of the enemy. It landed on the road, where it proceeded to empty its magazine. The story goes that the enemy thought they were being surrounded and retreated. The next story is in a Belgian town, believed to be Ghent. Thomas was about to lead the convoy over a bridge when it blew up, rigged by the retreating Germans.\n\nI thought it would be good to share this with you in case his name or the second hand stories resonate with anyone. Thomas returned to his French polishing job after the war and sadly died in the late 60s following a stroke. My father died a couple of years ago, so these stories need a new home.\n\nAll the best, Paul Hockaday\n\nHolland J. Ser No D/MX 509506 Petty Officer who served on HMS Glenearn.
