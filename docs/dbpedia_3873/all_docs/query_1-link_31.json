        "text": "Here at The Infatuation, we help people find their way to the best meals in an approachable, funny, opinionated, and not-taking-ourselves-too-seriously manner. We’re like Zagat for a new generation. You’ll never find us using words like ‘toothsome’ our ‘mouthfeel’ to describe a piece of meat, but you will find over 1.6k unbiased reviews on the best restaurants around through our Website, our iPhone & Android apps, and Text Rex.\n\nChris Stang, co-founder & CEO of The Infatuation brought me in to help centralize all our creative under one umbrella. We’re a small company with a large audience, and we think branding is one of the most important things for us to focus on. We think critically, down to the smallest details. We provide information to an audience that craves authenticity and opinionated info on restaurant experiences.\n\nThis article covers the overall process we followed while rebranding. The point is to provide an inside look at how we settled on some of these decisions. Every company is different—this process worked for us and fluidly evolved through the duration of the rebrand. If you’re working on a rebrand, hopefully some of this info can help with your process.\n\nAnatomy of our logo\n\nAbove is the redesigned logo. Below, we’ll cover the process we took to arrive at that conclusion. If you need to take a restroom break you should probably do it now, because this is a long one, and you’re going to be sucked into the beauty that awaits. BUCKLE UP.\n\nGetting to the core of what we do\n\nWhen we initially started working on this project, we made an effort to really simplify what we stand for, and what we provide to our users. People access our content in many different ways including:\n\nRestaurant reviews and guides on theinfatuation.com.\n\nEmail newsletters spanning across 7 cities.\n\nText Rex: SMS service connecting users to expert humans who help you figure out where to eat (beta).\n\niOS and Android apps.\n\nSocial: Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nThis is quite a large range of services considering The Infatuation used to be a blog run by Chris and Andrew as a passion project showing their love for good food and disdain for esoteric restaurant reviews.\n\nKeeping all our platforms in mind, we began to think about our positioning as a company. We discovered a common goal with all of these parts—they all help you decide where to go eat a meal.\n\nAfter seeing everything holistically up on a whiteboard — a magic moment struck. We came to the realization that we tend to make up words for things, so, for example:\n\nExperiences = #EEEEEATS (our popular hastag on instagram with over 3.5 million posts).\n\nRecommendations = Rex (following Text Rex, our SMS recommendation service we created in June of 2015).\n\nDecisions = ???\n\nWe needed a special word for decisions, since all of our services have a goal of enabling you to make a decision, or even deciding for you. Many suggestions where thrown around until we reached another magic moment and coined ourselves as:\n\nThe Infatuation: Your Restaurant Decider\n\nWith this identification, the rebrand process became quite a bit easier. Every decision we make fits within the context of our core brand offering of helping you figure out where to go experience a meal. Basically: the main problem we’re trying to solve has to do with why the name of this restaurant is funny and relatable:\n\nStrategizing a logo that can represent us as Deciders.\n\nTime to begin designing the logo. So, open illustrator right? Not quite yet. We took a couple time-saving steps to help suss out the strategy of where we want this thing to land.\n\nSurvey, survey survey.\n\nTo start out, I sent around a survey to the team getting their views on the current Infatuation landscape. This was great input to see where everyone is at mentally, which is to say, WEIRD. To be clear, this is input that can help inform the decision, but it should by no means solely drive the decisions. Here are the questions that were asked of the team to really pin down how everyone was feeling about the brand:\n\nIn your mind, what word best describes The Infatuation?\n\nWhat do you like about the current logo? What does it do well to communicate the brand?\n\nWhat do you dislike about the current logo? What are the ways it improperly communicates what we do?\n\nWhat does The Infatuation provide that other companies in the space can’t?\n\nIf The Infatuation was a restaurant, which one would it be & why?\n\nWhat do our users love most about us?\n\nDo you like Pizza?\n\n17/17 Infatuation folks confirmed that they like pizza. That’s huge news for the team party planning committee.\n\nDistilling information into a creative brief\n\nWith these survey results and through additional conversations, we came up with a creative brief that captured where we wanted the brand to head. I followed an approach learned from Frank Harris that he picked up during his Etsy days. Using this process, we asked ourselves 3 simple questions:\n\nWhat problems does the current logo have?\n\nWhat does the current logo communicate that we want to keep?\n\nWhat objectives do we have for the mark and what are some possible solutions?\n\nThis ensures we keep what we like from the current mark while pushing the branding to the next level. Here’s a link to the full design brief.\n\nAnalyzing the competition\n\nIt’s also important to identify where we sit within the context of our competitors. We drew a couple charts and scenarios to really get a sense of who our competitors are from a primary, secondary, and tertiary perspective. Hint: It’s mostly Domino’s Pizza.\n\nNext, we pulled all the information gathered in the strategy stage and started getting visual. We put up a lot of info. Visual styles that could work well for the brand. Things we personally like. Photos that represent our attitude. We then reacted to each piece with sticky notes. Green for good things, blue for neutral things, and red for bad things. This exercise can only be done effectively when everything is actually printed out for everyone to see. Connections are easier to make when looking at everything holistically—this is harder to do when paging through a PDF on screen.\n\nI found it easiest to create sub mood-boards based on our ideas as well. At one point, we thought maybe the combination of a mouth and a compass could be good to help represent our penchant for good EEEEEATS and restaurant discovery. For that, we made a mouth-board.\n\nWe also wanted to find out a rough brand archetype to help steer the creative. Gathering images around this helped pinpoint a rough direction to pursue. In looking at the “Brand Archetypes” chart, we ultimately decided the Outlaw feel fits us well. We do things differently than other publications reviewing restaurants, and we’re certainly not taking cues from the elder statesmen of the industry. We do what makes sense to us and what’s best for our users and readers — at all costs. We create the unexpected (see the unconventionally branded sony tea pot in the image above), we aim to be witty, but not wacky (see Dave Chapelle), we’re laid back (like The Dude, but less lazy).\n\nGetting Sketchy\n\nOnce the moodboard was roughly set and we were able to react to everything, I dove in with a bunch of different sketches and ideas based on the requirements gathered in the information and exploration phases.\n\nBasically, this is kind of a stream of consciousness on a page to see if any ideas stuck. Really quick sketches — nothing polished (or even good for that matter). It’s more to capture the idea, then bring that idea into illustrator for further refinement.\n\nAfter pinning some of these ideas up, as a team, we started to unpack the word “Infatuation” and all the feeling and action that comes with it. Infatuation defined is:\n\nAn intense but short-lived passion or admiration for someone or something.\n\nIt’s not really love, it’s more like short-lived, intense, obsessive, almost unhealthy love. It’s writing your crush’s name in a notebook over and over again and maybe carving their likeness into a block of cheese. It’s clearing your mind of everything except for the one thing you’re infatuated with.\n\nThe thought of some combination of a heart and a lighting bolt started to make sense, and seemed to represent this word well. Our hearts jumping from one place to the next, just like our obsession for new restaurants and experiences. The idea was slick and on-brand. We rolled with it.\n\nAfter mockup work, iteration, and perfecting the form, the BoltingHeart was born.\n\nFalse Positives\n\nSome people felt good about the BoltingHeart, others didn’t. We grabbed the whole team and gathered around a wall of BoltingHeart to see what the branding felt like as a whole. Logically, everything seemed to be there. But we were missing something. It wasn’t really tangible, it was more of a feel. The mark was too serious.\n\nAlthough the BoltingHeart represented the word Infatuation very well, it didn’t represent who we are as a company. Many positives came from this false positive. It further informed where we needed to head and as a bonus we landed on a wordmark that REALLY felt like us.\n\nFiguring out that feel—what were we missing?\n\nBack to the moodboard—we needed to identify why were missing that humorous and carefree feel. I grabbed a bunch of illustrations and icons with the green, positive post-its on them and locked them up next to our wordmark just for kicks. The results were surprising.\n\nUsing the wordmark as the visual anchor, we found out that some icons we thought were really great for the brand didn’t work at all, and we were surprised to see ones we didn’t think could work feeling really great next to the wordmark.\n\nWe settled on the vibe of the space helmet and the grey flag & shield providing the best ‘feels’ for our brand.\n\nGetting there\n\nAfter figuring out the overall feel we started thinking about this idea of everyday pretentious kitchen items being somehow pulled down from their pedestals. Could we do something funny with a whisk? What about a mandoline? How can we mix this high-brow low-brow together and create an approachable mark? What’s some ridiculous combinations we can make with food / kitchen items and really pump up the humor in the mark? We had this idea around a megaphone and a ham combined, which seemed pretty stupid, so we went with it 😉. Back to the moodboard and sketching — started landing on a couple more ham horn ideas, along with pretentious kitchen items.\n\nAfter some rough sketches to get the overall feel right, I pulled up Illustrator to create a couple more visual styles and mockups. The handle was probably the trickiest part. If positioned a certain way, it can start to feel very aggressive, and more like a cannon or a gun. NO BUENO. Other handle treatments just felt kind of wonky too.\n\nAt this point, it was in a good place to show the team and get their thoughts before diving deep into the details. I put together a quick keynote showing the mark and some possible treatments and presented it. Laughter, smiles, and comments on how ridiculous it was were plenty. THIS IS IT. It felt good to finally land on something that our team felt represented us well.\n\nWith buy-in from the team, it was now time to start working on some of the smaller details, and ham-hornifying the rest of the brand identity.\n\nSelecting color\n\nWe knew we wanted a blue, but the blue we were using in the past didn’t feel quite right. Plus, #80b6fd is a little washed out when used on white, and not accessible to the visually impaired.\n\nWe decided to use blue instead of the typical red most food companies use. Plus, the color blue enhances trust—IT’S SCIENCE. Trust is important when we’re sharing our opinion on many restaurants.\n\nGoing Blue Hunting\n\nAfter sitting at my computer and using the hue selector for about 19 hrs, I thought it would be nice to get out and physically go look at blue colors that could match our vision.\n\nI went and walked around East Williamsburg (the real East Williamsburg not to be confused with Bushwick, just so we’re clear) to grab some reference shots on what could fit us the best. Here’s some of what was captured:\n\nGetting Feedback from Creatives\n\nFeeling good about how the kit of brand parts was coming together, it was time to start getting validation from other creatives in the field to make sure all improvements that could be made were made. When working on a mark, it’s easy to get tunnel vision and easily miss things other creative folks can see instantly. Since we don’t have a large design team at The Infatuation yet, I reached out to external sources.\n\nCreative Friends\n\nI ran mockups by a bunch of creative friends and colleagues that I’ve worked with in the past. Big thanks to Sayaka Sugimura, Jason Strong, Shawn Hoglund, Sasha Tsimbler, Alex Osorio, and Cassie Broeckert for helping make things better. From the overarching brand positioning all the way down to the kerning on the tagline, all the feedback has been instrumental in finalizing the mark.\n\nInspect\n\nBryn Jackson runs a weekly design critique called Inspect where he brings on talented designers and illustrators to take a look at and critique work. This was instrumental to pushing the work further into the goodness zone. Guests Vicki Tan and Ryan Putnam, as well as everyone participating in Inspect were super helpful in identifying how our logo and icon system could be improved.\n\nInspect feedback on the Ham Horn:\n\nInspect feedback on our Instagram iconography (over 2.3 million followers across all handles):\n\nExecuting\n\nSo now, the Ham Horn is born and the overall brand vision is set, here’s how it’s played out in our executions so far. Seeing everything here is a good baseline, and it will be great to see how these executions evolve over time.\n\nThe Mark"
