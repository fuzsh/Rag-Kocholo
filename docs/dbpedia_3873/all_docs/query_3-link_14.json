        "text": "At 2:00am on 1 November, the men of 4 Commando were roused from their billets in the ruins of Breskens. The cold drizzle did little to lift the soldiers’ spirits as they made their way down to the embarkation point. Shells from over three hundred guns screamed overhead towards Flushing and showers of sparks lit up the horizon as they found their target. Mosquitoe fighter-bombers flew low overhead to strafe targets across the estuary. However, low cloud meant that the high level bombing had already been cancelled. The men quietly took their places in the LCAs without interruption and at 4:40am the first pair of landing craft slipped their moorings and headed for Flushing.\n\nFires cast an eerie glow across the horizon as the landing craft approached the shore and the flames illuminated the windmill to the left of Uncle beach; there would be no mistake about where to land. ‘Keepforce’, the men who had surveyed the beach a few days earlier, guided 4 Commando LCAs ashore. Two of ‘Keepforce’s patrol craft led the way in, followed by a section of 1 Troop under Captain Dennis Rewcastle. Although the craft approached the shore unseen, one of the patrol boats swung starboard, away from the beach, in the darkness. Disaster was averted at the last moment when the second patrol boat found the correct landing point, beaching on the end of the Orange Mill promontory. As the beach clearing party set about cutting wire and laying tape across Uncle Beach, their commander, Lieutenant Harry Hargreaves DSC, RNVR, set up a guiding lamp at the end of the promontory ready to guide the next wave ashore.\n\nLCAs crowd Breskens harbour\n\nLCAs ferry troops across the Schelde estuary while Flushing burns on the horizon. H Houterman\n\nLCAs prepare to land on Uncle Beach. H Houterman\n\nWhile ‘Keepforce’s men prepared the shoreline, Rewcastle’s troop set about securing the beachhead. Moving quickly, they clambered onto the sea wall, taking a number of prisoners along the way. CSM Lewis’ group burst into a strong point near the Orange Mill, finding twenty Germans cowering on the floor inside. They were the crew of a 75mm gun. Rewscastle’s men also captured the crew of the beach searchlight in an underground shelter at the shore end of the promontory. Leaving a patrol to block the entrance to Oranjestraat, Captain Rewcastle’s men began to clear the block of streets to the north of Oranjemolen, an area code named ‘Seaford’. They were well on their way to securing the western approach to the beach.\n\nMeanwhile, Lieutenant John Hunter-Grey’s section, from No 2 Troop, headed east to tackle a number of strong points along the shoreline. Sergeant Stanley Mullard’s men burst into the first pillbox, finding twenty startled Germans and a 50mm anti-tank gun.\n\nWhile the advanced parties cleared the perimeter of the beachhead ‘Keepforce’ guided the next two LCA’s in, carrying the rest of No 1 Troop and No 2 Troop. Lieutenant Peter King’s section, landed unopposed, and headed along Oranjestraat towards the Willelm III Barracks. Finding it empty, they headed west along the seafront to engage two machine-guns firing on the approaching landing craft. The commandos quickly overpowered the crews, bringing in ten prisoners. As King’s men headed towards the Arsenal, another machine-gun post came to life on the promontory code named ‘Brighton’, firing across the face of the old harbour. While half the section returned fire, the remainder of King’s men joined No 1 Troop in ‘Seaford’.\n\nMeanwhile, Lieutenant Frank Albrow’s section, from No 2 Troop, had landed unscathed and taken up fire positions covering Lieutenant Hunter-Gray’s advance along the shore line. No 2 Troop advanced quickly through the area code named ‘Troon’, clearing seven defensive positions before the Germans realised what was happening. Mullard’s captured anti-tank gun played an active part in the advance after his men wheeled it out of its gun pit. A German 75mm gun was also pressed into action, engaging targets on the opposite side of the dock. The scratch crew quickly developed the necessary skills to fire their new weapon, silencing two machine-guns and a flak gun. With the area code named ‘Troon’ clear, Lieutenant Albrow moved his men forward sealing off the promontory code named ‘Falmouth’.\n\nSo far the landing was progressing well and the first wave of troops had established a small beachhead. Captain Alastair Thorburn’s Troop had sealed off the town approach while Captain ‘Jack’ Wilson’s men had secured the area east of the beach. Many Germans were caught off guard, surrendering to the commandos at the first opportunity.\n\nUncle Beach and the Harbour; the arrows chart No 3 Troop’s route into the heart of the town.\n\nWhile the leading troops secured the flanks of Uncle beach, No 3 Troop prepared to land. As Major Gordon Webb’s men braced themselves for the landing, a 20mm flak cannon opened fire. It was, however, firing blindly and as the commandos stepped ashore, they watched anxiously as tracer streaked overhead.\n\nAfter assembling beyond the dike, Webb’s men headed towards their first objective, Bellamypark (code name ‘Braemar’), in the centre of the town. Moving quickly along Gravestraat, No 3 Troop made their way to Wilhelminastraat. Finding the old harbour under fire from the pillbox code-named ‘Brighton’, Webb diverted his men along Nieuwstraat. Although the occasional sniper or machine-gun opened fire on the troops as they ran along the dark streets, No 3 Troop only suffered one casualty.\n\nNo 2 Section came across a pillbox as they entered Bellamypark and while Sergeant Jackson led an assault on the strong point, the rest of the section fanned out around the park. The pillbox only managed to fire a few rounds, killing Private Pierre Laux, but its capture made it possible to begin clearing the houses around the park. Although resistance was light, Lieutenant Nicholas Barrass was killed during the house clearing.\n\nWhile No 2 Section cleared Bellamypark, No 1 Section, under Captain Murdoch McDougall, took the lead. Intelligence had reported that the Germans had established a naval barracks along the sea front. Huge pillboxes dominated Boulevard de Ruyter, so McDougall’s men were going to enter through the maze of streets behind the barracks.\n\nIt was now beginning to get light and as time passed, the Germans were beginning to realise that they were being attacked. The section pressed on, stumbling on a startled group of Germans at one corner. In the fire-fight that followed the commandos caused ten casualties for the loss of one of their own. Captain McDougall quickly ordered his men off the street; now that the Germans were aroused, snipers and machine-guns would soon cover every street. Anxious to keep moving, McDougall’s men advanced by any possible means, climbing over sheds and garden walls to reach ‘Hove’. However, ‘Brighton’ pillbox, overlooking the harbour, still continued to harass No 1 Section. Captain McDougall was forced to post sentries in the houses along the line of his advance, in case the Germans decided to counter-attack.\n\nTaking cover as shells target the landing beach.\n\nThe area surrounding Bellamy Park, 4 Commando encountered resistance from ‘Brighton’, ‘Hove’ and ‘Worthing’.\n\nFrench Commandos pose for a moment at the Orange Mill. H Houterman\n\nCommandos cross Bellamy Park under fire.\n\nAlthough his position was secure for the time being, McDougall had insufficient men to clear the naval barracks. A few men were sent into the complex, and by working their way through the maze of rooms established a number of lookout posts covering many of the exits. By the time it was light, McDougall’s commandos were severely limiting the Germans’ movements throughout the barracks.\n\nAlthough No 3 Troop had managed to clear a large part of its objectives, it was in danger of being over stretched. Major Webb requested reinforcements, but difficulties elsewhere in the town would leave him disappointed; his men would have to hold their positions until nightfall.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the beach, the Germans had started to target the landing area and the two LCA’s carrying No 5 Troop came under intense fire as they made their final run-in. The first LCA was hit in the engine compartment, wounding the coxswain. The out of control landing craft soon rammed into the pier, sinking as the commandos disembarked under heavy machine-gun fire. Heavy fire struck the second craft as it approached the beach. In the confusion, Captain Alexandre Lofi’s men disembarked too early, plunging into shoulder deep water.\n\nAfter wading onto the beach, Lieutenants Paul Chaussé and Pierre Amaury cursed their bad luck as they assembled their men. The troop followed a similar route to No 3 Troop, making its way along Oranjestraat, Emmastraat and Wilheminastraat. Chaussé’s section came under fire as they entered Gravestraat, but after few rounds from the section’s 2-inch mortar the enemy post was quickly overrun. Next came St Jacob’s Church in the Oude Markt, where a solitary prisoner was taken.\n\nNo 2 Section moved quickly along Kerkstraat and across Bellamypark, heading down Breestraat. The plan was for Lieutenant Amaury to take up a defensive position in the Groote Markt while Lieutenant Chaussé attacked the barracks along the sea front. Heavy machine-gun and sniper fire greeted Amaury’s section as it entered the market place and after taking cover in the houses and shops, the commandos began working their way around the square. In the face of such opposition, the Germans withdrew into their barracks on the sea front, codenamed ‘Worthing’.\n\nWhile his men prepared for the assault, Lieutenant Chaussé crept forward to find the safest approach route. He was met with a shower of stick grenades and, as Sergeants Paillet and Messanot dragged their wounded officer to safety, it was clear that the way forward was blocked. For the time being, No 5 Troop would have to consolidate its position around Groote Markt and await reinforcements.\n\nIt became almost impossible to move after first light as German snipers and machine guns came alive. WM BU1245\n\nNo 6 Troop, under Captain Guy Vourch, had the furthest to travel to reach their objective. At the north end of the old town, between the inland lake known as Binnenbozem and the shipbuilding yards was a major crossroads, code named ‘Bexhill’. Any German reinforcements intent on reaching the centre of the town had to pass the junction and Vourch’s task was to seize the area as quickly as possible. The machine-gun section would accompany the Troop, consolidating the crossroads position after it had been taken.\n\nAlthough machine-gun fire strafed the Troop’s LCAs as they hit the beach, casualties were light. Vourch was unable to locate the machine-gun section as his men assembled behind the dike and with strict instructions to move as quickly as possible, No 6 Troop set off alone.\n\nThe Troop’s first objective, the Post office in Steenen Beer, was strongly held. Most of the occupants, however, relented in the face of a charge delivered by Lieutenant Jacques Senée’s section. A grenade dealt with a handful that refused to surrender. Continuing through the town along Walstraat, Vourch’s men were hailed by many civilians awaked by the noise of battle. A Dutch section accompanied Vourch’s men, liasing with the local population en route. The section leader, Hendrik van Nahüys, a former Flushing police officer, used his local knowledge to make good progress.\n\nThe troop reached ‘Bexhill’ at 7:45 and the lead section, followed by Vourch’s headquarters crossed Coosje Buskenstraat to take up positions covering the junction. ‘Dover’ pillbox, on the sea front, opened fire as the commandos dashed across the road. The strong point possessed a 20mm flak gun, a devastating weapon at short range. The street was under careful watch by the time the second section arrived. For the time being, No 6 Troop was spilt in two. Before Captain Vourch had time to take stock of his position, he faced two problems. One sub-section entered a school overlooking the crossroads, taking seven prisoners. The large building was quickly turned into a defensive position, securing the commandos grip on the crossroads. Meanwhile, lookouts spotted a large group of Germans, about a company strong, moving down Badhuisstraat towards the crossroads. Setting up a hasty fire position the commandos opened fire, scattering the hostile reinforcements. Captain Vourch had arrived just in time; minutes later and ‘Bexhill’ would have been in German hands.\n\nAlthough Vourch held the junction, his Troop was split in two halves. To make matters worse, at a time when every man was needed, Nahüys had mistakenly led one sub-section west towards the sea front. Infiltrating Germans managed to cut the group off, and many did not return until the following day. Lieutenant Guy de Montlaur’s attempt to enter the shipyard gates east of the crossroads was thwarted by a machine-gun post along Aagje Dekenstraat. As his men did their best to form a tight defensive perimeter, Captain Vourch wondered where the lost machine-gun section was.\n\nTwo pillboxes opened fire as No 4 Troop, the support weapons troop, approached the beach in two LCAs. Although the Bren gun on Captain Knyveth Carr’s LCA returned fire, it made little difference and bullets raked the LCAs on the run in to the beach. Just before it hit the shore the craft struck an iron bar, bringing it to a shuddering halt. Clambering into the water, Carr’s men did their best to salvage their equipment under heavy machine-gun fire. Meanwhile, the LCA carrying the medium machine-gun section landed safely alongside.\n\nThe bottlenecks at Bexhill and Dover threatened to stifle 4 Commando’s advance.\n\nAs the troop assembled under cover of the sea wall, Captain Carr returned to the stricken craft and with the help of Staff-Sergeant Lloyd and Private Leyland, retrieved a second mortar and several cases of bombs. Within half an hour, the mortars were cleaned, in position and ready to fire.\n\nThe machine-gun section set off in search of No 6 troop and eventually reached ‘Bexhill’ fifteen minutes late. Lieutenant C A Kelly ran across the junction under fire, making contact with Captain Vourch. On the return journey, a sniper found his mark hitting Kelly in the chest. His batman managed to drag the wounded officer into a nearby shop. The first crew was about to cross when the same sniper hit Lance-Corporal Lambert in the stomach. As Private John Stoddart ran out to recover Lambert’s tripod, another shot rang out, leaving Stoddart mortally wounded, shot in the head. Captain Carr could see that the crossroads was too dangerous a place, and led the rest of the section along Scherminkelstraat, to find a safer place to cross. Under cover of smoke and supporting fire from one of the section’s Bren guns, Carr managed to get the rest of his men across safely.\n\nBy 8:30am No 4 Commando had established a tight perimeter in Flushing old town. Through moving quickly, and ignoring isolated groups of Germans, the commandos now held key positions. No 3 Troop and No 5 Troop had established a defensive line in the west of the town, behind the seafront, while No 6 Troop held ‘Bexhill’ junction with assistance from the support troop. While No 2 Troop had sealed off the eastern side of the beachhead, No 1 Troop had assembled in reserve awaiting further orders.\n\nKnowing that help was on its way, Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Dawson was anxious to locate his forward line so he could make further plans. So far radio contact had not been established with the three companies in the north or west of the town and Melville had to rely on runners. Lieutenant Hattu braved sniper fire to locate No 3 and No 5 Troops, reporting that both Troops faced heavy resistance. Although 4 Commando had the situation under control for the time being, reinforcements would be needed before they could make further progress.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Dawson.\n\n4th King’s Own Scottish Borderers\n\nTwenty-six LCAs, carrying the 4th King’s Own Scottish Borderers in five waves, began to approach Uncle Beach a few minutes before 8:00am. With the beachhead secure Lieutenant-Colonel Melville was confident that his men could make a safe landing. C Company touched down unscathed and the streets echoed to the sounds of Captain David Colville’s hunting horn as the commandos assembled behind the dike. B Company landed next, and as the two companies prepared to move out, Captain James Bennett, the support company commander went forward in search of the 4 Commando’s headquarters. As Bennett approached Bellamypark, he was severely wounded in the back by a sniper’s bullet; the battalion’s first casualty.\n\nMeanwhile, the remaining LCAs carrying A, D and HQ Companies approached the shore. This time the Germans were waiting for them. Machine-guns and mortars raked the craft as they hit the beach and although casualties were light, the battalion’s communication equipment suffered badly. Both radio links with the mainland were lost on the beach and the battalion control set was damaged beyond repair by shrapnel.\n\nAs his men began to organise themselves, Lieutenant-Colonel Melville decided to seek out 4 Commando’s headquarters for himself, finding it in Bellamypark. After a quick briefing Melville returned to his men, instructing Captain Colville to take C Company and two carrier sections to Bexhill. Meanwhile, the rest of the battalion would wait in reserve until the bottleneck had been cleared.\n\nC Company reached Bexhill by 10:00am, however, crossfire had turned the junction into a killing zone. ‘Dover’ strong point at the end of Coosje Buskenstraat was still active and the machine-gun post along Aagje Dekenstraat was equally alert. Any sign of movement in the street was met by bursts of 20mm cannon and machine-gun fire. Captain Colville did not have any heavy weapons to return fire, or the means to make smoke. After despatching a runner to Battalion headquarters, he ordered C Company to take cover.\n\nAfter hearing Colville’s report, Lieutenant-Colonel Melville took steps to reinforce C Company. So far, radio Communications had failed and Melville personally led B Company towards ‘Bexhill’ to assess the strength of the opposition for himself. He did not have long to wait. Making his way forward along Walstraat, B Company was spotted by a German machine-gun crew at the end of Badhuisstraat. Concentrated fire forced B Company to take cover in side streets and doorways. Melville quickly ordered his men to make their way through the back streets and houses; he now knew for himself that ‘Bexhill’ was a dangerous place.\n\nTroops move cautiously through the ruins.\n\nOnce at Coosje Buskenstraat, Melville could for see himself how the Germans covered the road from every angle and ordered the carrier sections forward to make smoke at two points. Clouds soon filled the street, obscuring the German gunners view, but as a platoon of C Company made the mad dash to the school on the far side. The rest of Colville’s company followed, but by the time a platoon of B Company had crossed, the smoke had begun to clear.\n\nFor the time being, the position north of Coosje Buskenstraat was secure, increasing the KOSBs grip on ‘Bexhill’. Lieutenant-Colonel Melville was confident that his men could hold their perimeter and as time passed, the Scots began to feel the advantage of fire support. Their 3-inch mortars targeted the machine-gun post on Aagje Dekenstraat while the Canadian artillery across the estuary shelled the streets beyond ‘Bexhill’. Even so, the German snipers and machine gun teams remained active, making it impossible to send more troops forward. The KOSBs were caught in a stalemate, unable to advance or regroup; all they could do was watch and wait. Meanwhile, the local population tried to escape the battle:\n\nCivilians surprisingly quick in appearing between periods of shelling and other fire – impossible to control them in any great extent – however, the necessity did not arise, since they disciplined themselves admirably.\n\nAs the attack developed, members of the local resistance emerged to offer advice but despite their good intentions, the soldiers often found the assistance distracting:\n\nIt was found very early that information and assistance from the Underground Army was erratic both in veracity and usefulness. Though their help did increase throughout the action.\n\nAs the battle for Flushing slowly degenerated into deadlock, Lieutenant-Colonel Melville returned to his headquarters in Gravestraat, to consider his next step. Rather than renewing the attack’s momentum, half of his battalion was embroiled around ‘Bexhill’ crossroads. A third company was engaged near ‘Dover’ alongside 4 Commando. The battalion diary sums up Melville’s predicament.\n\nThis sniping, and resistance by isolated machine-guns, extremely difficult to combat owing to Germans’ superior knowledge of ground, and ease with which these small bodies could conceal themselves and change position.\n\nAt 1:00pm Lieutenant-Colonel Melville finally received a reserve radio set and for the first time, he was able to report to Brigadier McLaren on the far side of the estuary. Now that the 4th KOSBs were fully occupied, the 5th KOSBs would have to take over the lead as soon as they landed.\n\n5th King’s Own Scottish Borderers\n\nLieutenant-Colonel William Turner’s men started to embark at 2:00pm, but as A and C Companies set sail, there were growing concerns about the safety of Uncle Beach as the Germans targeted the area with every available mortar and gun. The leading wave of LCAs faced a storm of shrapnel and bullets as it approached the dike and in the words of one coxswain; you could not have fitted a matchbox through that wall of lead. Fearing a disaster, Lieutenant-Commander Vernon ordered his LCAs to return to Breskens making smoke.\n\nThe 5th KOSBs headed back towards Breskens, disembarking under shellfire at 15:00pm. As they headed for cover the beach parties on Flushing shore waited anxiously. They were isolated for the time being; it would be dark when the LCAs returned, forcing a serious delay on Brigadier McLaren’s timetable.\n\nMeanwhile, Lieutenant-Colonel Melville spent the afternoon trying to improve his grip on the town. Although C Company was trapped on the far side of Coosje Buskenstraat, Captain Colville’s men held a secure perimeter. They had managed to capture a quartermaster and cook and the two were put to good use, feeding C Company on German rations.\n\nD Company had reinforced 4 Commando’s attack on ‘Dover’, they had, so far, been unable to reach the strong point. An engineer officer, sent by Melville to assess the situation, had been unable to provide a satisfactory solution. The closest an assault party could get to the bunker under cover was fifty metres; even then, the troops would be forced to emerge via a small window, one at a time. Although a flame-thrower would have been ideal, the Scots had none to hand.\n\nLate in the afternoon 155 Brigade planned to shell ‘Dover’ with the heavy artillery across the estuary. Withdrawing to a safe distance beyond Spuistraat, the Commandos and Scots waited as the shells targeted the strong point. They had hoped the bombardment would subdue the Germans inside. They were to be disappointed. As 4 Commando edged back towards the seafront ‘Dover’ opened fire once more. By nightfall they managed to secure a perimeter around Groote Markt and Paarden Markt. The battle for ‘Dover’ would be renewed the following day.\n\nMeanwhile, A Company of the 4th KOSBs had entered the De Schelde shipbuilding yards, infiltrating the dockyard offices and workshops. It had been hoped that they would be able to increase the hold on ‘Bexhill’, but they were met with heavy fire at dock gates. Although they could see B Company across the street, the Scots were unable to cross.\n\nLater that evening Battalion headquarters was informed that several dockyard buildings had been booby-trapped and there were concerns that German rearguards would try detonate the demolition charges after dark. It was a risk that Lieutenant-Colonel Melville did not want to take. After withdrawing A Company from the area, a small team began searching the area:\n\nThis task extremely difficult: very dark night and exact enemy locations not known; no charges found within limits of search – no building in fact blew up.\n\nAt 9:30pm Lieutenant-Colonel Melville received his orders for the following day. The 5th KOSBs had eventually managed to land under cover of darkness. While the 4th KOSBs held their positions, Brigadier McLaren planned to renew the attack on the New Town with the 5th KOSBs. The attack would begin at 5:30am, preceded by an intense bombardment.\n\nAs the day ended, the head of the Dutch Underground visited Lieutenant-Colonel Melville’s headquarters with worrying news. There had been a large number of civilian casualties during the battle and many had been taken to the hospital at the south-west corner of the De Schelde Aircraft factory. Others had gathered in the building in the hope of escaping the shelling and the resistance leader estimated there were over one thousand men, women and children in the area. Lieutenant-Colonel Melville tried to assure the resistance leader that the artillery would attempt to avoid the hospital. He also promised to try to evacuate as many civilians as possible at first light. In return, Melville asked the Dutch to try to persuade any Germans in the area to surrender. With a promise of fair treatment, should they leave the hospital alongside the Dutch, before the area came under attack.\n\nBrigadier McLaren landed on the island before midnight, joining Lieutenant-Colonel Dawson at his headquarters. Having heard how far 4 Commando had advanced, McLaren issued his orders for the morning. The primary objective was to clear the seafront as far north as ‘Dover’, releasing many of Dawson’s troops. The commandos would attack at first light, targeting ‘Brighton’, ‘Worthing’ and ‘Dover’.\n\nLater that night everyone was relieved to hear that General Daser, the German commanding officer of the 70th Division and overall commander of the island, had broadcast his willingness to surrender on the Canadian frequency. While Brigadier McLaren was aware that many of those defending the island would follow their commander’s lead, some would fight to the last. All units received the following warning in response to the offer:\n\nThis would be accepted provided all German positions show the white flag. Corps policy is to respect the white flag strictly. This to be accepted with provision that if any position showing white flag fires upon any sub-unit, drastic action will be taken against it.\n\nMany soldiers knew from bitter experience that the white flag had to be treated with caution."
