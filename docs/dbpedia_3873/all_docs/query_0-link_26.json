        "text": "Today is D-Day. Shortly after midnight on June 6th, 1944 Airborne units of the combined American, British, and Canadian Armies began landing in Normandy, France. 24,000 Paratroopers and Glider Troops descended into darkness. At 6:30 am, the landings began on the coast, with 5 Divisions attacking along 80 km (50 miles) of beach on the French Normandy coast. The landings were the largest amphibious operation ever mounted, with over 160,000 soldiers landing on June 6th alone: 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British, and 21,400 Canadians. There were 195,700 naval personnel in over 5000 ships. This was covered by a blanket of fighters so effective, that only 2 Luftwaffe fighters penetrated to the beaches on D-Day. Today in 1944 saw the deaths of 2000 Americans on Omaha beach, 50% casualties (933) of the Canadian first wave at Juno Beach, and the heavy price paid by the Airborne units, shouldering 4000 of the estimated 9000 total casualties - 3000 of them fatalities - on D-Day. In France today, streets are named for the men who fought, and died there. It is our duty to remember that our free world was paid for by them. Realize, but for them, how close totalitarianism came to conquering this earth.\n\n#OnThisDay 18 June 1815 The 27th (Inniskillings) Regiment of Foot took their place in the centre of Wellington's line of battle at Waterloo. Wellington later said, 'The (27th) saved the centre of the my line...' But #DidYouKnow The 27th Regiment that fought at Waterloo, some 747 officers and men, was a regiment with a strong family tradition and recruited largely in Ireland. In fact they were the only Irish infantry regiment to be present at Waterloo. Brothers served with brothers and cousins, sons followed fathers. Most of the ordinary soldiers were Roman Catholics and a considerable number were Irish speaking. The average soldier of those days was small by modern standards. Today, the surviving uniforms look as though they were made for boys rather than grown men! The average height seems to have been about 5 foot 5 inches (1.65m). These men would have been tough and fit: they marched long distances, they carried a heavy musket and ammunition, and a pack and rations. They wore newly designed headgear, issued in 1812, called the Belgic shako (Â© Inniskillings Museum). It was made of leather or felt, had the regimental badge in front, a peak at the crest and a feather or plume at the side.

Over 7,000 allied ships operated by almost 200,000 naval personnel were dispatched to disgorge around 150,000 men onto the beaches of Normandy. By the end of the month, more than 850,000 troops, almost 150,000 vehicles and 1,140,000,000 pounds of supplies and ammunition were sent to those same beaches. Of the 4,414 Allied troops killed on D-Day, 2,501 were Americans. More than 5,000 were wounded. In the ensuing Battle of Normandy, 73,000 Allied forces were killed and 153,000 wounded. Some gave everything, and those sacrifices shaped the world balance in favor of the Allies and made the world we inhabit today possible. Take 2 minutes, quietly reflect on the folks that made that ultimate sacrifice that made your world possible. Take 2 more and think about how you yourself might be able to contribute to making the world a better place. #carpediem\n\nðŸŒºToday marks Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand, commemorating those who have served, and continue to do so, in the armed forces. As we pause to reflect on the unique sacrifice of those lost to war this #AnzacDay, let us not forget those whoâ€™ve suffered physically and mentally due to their military service. Stats from the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide report that at least 1677 serving and ex-serving sailors, soldiers and aviators were lost to suicide between 1997 and 2021. Thatâ€™s 20x the number of service personnel killed in active combat over the same period. Let us strive to honour the legacy of those who have served and those still serving by upholding the values they fought for. Recognise the lifelong impacts of military service and remind ourselves of the importance and strength that comes from mateship. The statistics are horrifying, but we can each make a difference. If there is one thing we can do this Anzac Day it is to support those who have fought so hard for us. Check in on your mates. Lest we forget. ðŸŽ– #checkyourmates #anzacday"
