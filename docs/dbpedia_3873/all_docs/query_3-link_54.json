        "text": "Tripping Billy Collaboration\n\nIn May 2024, Pequod’s teamed up with Tripping Billy to raise funds for the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA). This collaboration highlighted Billy Zureikat, a dedicated home cook and pizza maker from Chicago who was diagnosed with a rare form of Muscular Dystrophy in 2021. Since his diagnosis, Billy has been on a mission to raise funds and awareness for the MDA through his culinary creations.\n\nBilly’s unique pizza, aptly named “the Tripping Billy,” has become a symbol of his efforts. This pizza, featuring shishito pepper cream sauce, shishito peppers, and corn, has been showcased at 16 pizzerias across Chicago as part of “The Tripping Billy Chicago Tour.” Each participating restaurant has recreated the Tripping Billy in its signature style, contributing to a significant fundraising and awareness campaign. Pequod’s featured the Tripping Billy pizza for takeout each Thursday in May and sold 296 pizzas throughout the month, with 50% of the proceeds donated to the MDA. This effort resulted in a total donation of $3,700. Our commitment to this cause not only supported Billy’s mission but also brought the community together in a delicious and impactful way.\n\nPequod’s has a stellar reputation for offering some of the best pizza in Chicago, which is no small feat in a city brimming with saucy, cheesy, piled-high pies. So how exactly does Pequod’s Pizza achieve this feat? With a creative crust so mouthwatering you have to taste it to believe it.\n\nIf you’re a cheese-lover, you’ll almost certainly agree that Pequod’s has the best Chicago pizza, as this savory delight comes baked right into the famous crust. The pizza artists at Pequod’s begin by placing a ring of mozzarella around the rim of the deep dish pan which caramelizes as the pie bakes. This is followed up with a hearty helping of freshly made dough that plumps up into a mouthwatering crust that’s focaccia-like in its airy consistency. The pizza comes out with a dark rim that’s a seemingly impossible combination of crispy and chewy all in one decadent bite.\n\nIt’s this rich, enticing crust that’s the staple feature of Pequod’s Pizza. Whether you pile on the pepperoni or go wild for veggies, this deep caramelized crust is at the heart of every piece of Pequod’s deep dish pizza.\n\nPequod’s is most famous for its distinctive take on pan pizza, but this isn’t the only thing on the Pequod’s Pizza menu. It’s worth noting that the restaurant’s cult following is so strong because this pizzeria gets everything right. The thin crust pizza offers a delightfully crispy bite as well.\n\nBoth options are available with dozens of topping choices, including meatballs, giardiniera, Italian beef, ground beef, and more. Get a bright taste of the garden with fresh garlic or fresh basil. Add a touch of tang with green or black olives. You can even pile on the pineapple. Make your pizza your own.\n\nYou can turn your meal into a three-course feast with other Pequod’s dishes, such as a half order of Pequod’s salad to start your meal and a decadent dessert to satisfy your sweet tooth. With options such as chocolate chip brownies, banana split cheesecake, and carrot cake to choose from, there’s something for everyone.\n\nFamous, Scrumptious Pizza in Morton Grove\n\nPequod’s Pizza is one of the most famous recipients of Burt Katz’s culinary genius, but it’s far from the only Chicago destination to bear his fingerprints. Katz began with Gulliver’s Pizza & Pub, which operated in Rogers Park. He worked there for six years, then sold his stake in Gulliver’s so he could move on to a fresh new challenge, which became Pequod’s.\n\nThe original Morton Grove destination is easily accessible for travelers passing through Chicago. This location also offers convenient delivery options for Morton Grove residents. If you prefer pickup, just pull into the lot and a pizza valet will bring your pie to the car to make carryout a cinch. You’re welcome to dine in as well, to enjoy the unique ambiance of the cozy hangout that started it all.\n\nCHICAGO’S FAVORITE DEEP DISH PIZZA\n\nThe original Pequod’s Pizza was so successful that it spawned a second location right in Chicago. Our convenient Chicago location is the perfect spot for gatherings, celebrations, and sports games. You’ll find Pequod’s Pizza in the picturesque Lincoln Park neighborhood among sweeping green spaces and artfully manicured lawns. Pick up a takeout feast and enjoy it in one of the popular local picnic spots such as the Alfred Caldwell Lily Pool, Lincoln Park Zoo, North Avenue Beach, or Millennium Park.\n\nPequod’s is perfectly positioned among a wealth of Chicago highlights, making it the ideal place to recharge in the middle of a memorable day. You can spend your morning perusing the charming boutiques, lunch on award-winning pizza, and then work off your indulgence along the Chicago Lakefront Trail.\n\nThe Chicago Pequod’s took off with such ferocity that it partnered with the neighboring sports bar Whale Tale to provide a comfortable waiting area for patrons. You can enjoy drinks at the bar and watch your favorite game over at Whale Tale while waiting for your table in Pequod’s. These amenities are a fine addition as groups can sometimes wait for two hours or more to secure a table for the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.\n\nPequod’s Pizza in Chicago offers delivery to customers within a 2-mile radius of the restaurant. Whether you’re a local indulging in your favorite slice or you’re staying in a nearby hotel on vacation, this is the way to go when you want to sink your teeth into an unforgettable dinner in the peace and quiet of your own personal space.\n\nGet a Taste of Pequod’s Pizza\n\nWhether you want to hunker down at a table in one of our warm, rustic-feeling locations or you’re looking for the best pizza delivery in the area, Pequod’s can meet your needs. Make a reservation online to cut down on your wait time or place your order via the website to get your delivery or pickup order started. It’s quick and simple to start the process of getting one of these cheese-inspired delights."
