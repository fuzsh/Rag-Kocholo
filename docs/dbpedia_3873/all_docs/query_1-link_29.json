        "text": "Restaurant recommendation website\n\nThis article is about the restaurant website. For similar uses, see Infatuation (disambiguation).\n\nThe Infatuation (formerly known as Immaculate Infatuation) is an American New York–based restaurant recommendation website and messaging service, created by former music industry executives Chris Stang and Andrew Steinthal in 2009. They are most known for publishing restaurant reviews and guides, and as creators of the hashtag #EEEEEATS.[1]\n\nThey have developed an Android and iPhone app,[2] and operate an SMS-based restaurant recommendation service called Text Rex.[3] In 2017 they launched their food and music festival brand EEEEEATSCON.[4]\n\nOn March 6, 2018, the company acquired the Zagat rating company from Google for an undisclosed amount.[5]\n\nOn September 9, 2021, the company was acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co.[6]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nImmaculate Infatuation was established in 2009 by Stang and Steinthal with the aim of providing honest restaurant reviews without accepting invitations from restaurants or announcing their presence to a wait staff.[1] They later shortened the company name to The Infatuation.[7]\n\nFunding\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 27, 2018, The Infatuation raised $30 million from a third round of venture funding from WndrCo, the media holding company co-founded by the Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg.[8]\n\nZagat acquisition\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 5, 2018, The Infatuation acquired Zagat's brand and assets from Google. They did not disclose the amount.[5] They will reportedly operate as two distinct brands, with The Infatuation retaining its editorial-first focus and Zagat will expand user surveys and develop a new tech-driven platform.[9]\n\n#EEEEEATS\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2012, The Infatuation started to use #EEEEEATS as a way to tag their food photos on Instagram. The 5 Es are explained as a way to make \"[what we do] feel fun\" and \"[to not] take things too seriously.\"[1] The hashtag was quickly adopted by the food community and now has grown to over 10 million tags.[10] The company also operates 22 different Instagram handles including the main @infatuation account, one for each of their operating cities, and food-specific accounts like @pizza, @avocadotoast, and @burger.[11]\n\nUnderfinger\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2014, The Infatuation published a satirical review of a faux restaurant by the name of Underfinger, featuring \"farm to finger\" foods like seahorse sashimi and charcuterie gloves. The fictional restaurant was later brought to life in a pop-up event hosted by Brooklyn restaurant Do or Dine.[12] A short-form documentary was created from the pop-up and later earned the company a James Beard Foundation Journalism Award nomination in the Humor category.[1]\n\nEEEEEATSCON\n\n[edit]\n\nEEEEEATSCON is The Infatuation's food festival held at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, CA, Forest Hills Stadium in Forest Hills, NY, The Salt Shed in Chicago, IL, and Bayfront Park in Miami, FL.[4] The event is described as a \"food festival built in the spirit of a music festival\" and includes restaurant vendors, speaking engagements, sponsor activations, and live performances.[13]\n\nFestival Summary by Year Edition Date Location Headlining Restaurants Musicians Speakers 1st May 20, 2017.[4] Santa Monica, CA Chi Spacca, Pasquale Jones, Jon & Vinny's Lizzo, The Knocks Shep Gordon, Nancy Silverton 2nd May 19, 2018[14] Santa Monica, CA Night + Market, Russ & Daughters, Cento Pasta Bar The Spencer Lee Band, Gavin Turek Missy Robbins 3rd October 6, 2018[15] Forest Hills, NY Shake Shack x Emily, Jon & Vinny's, Rubirosa Batalá New York, High & Mighty Brass Band Adam Rippon, Tim & Nina Zagat 4th May 18–19, 2019[16] Santa Monica, CA Shake Shack x Petit Trois, Triple Beam Pizza, Mariscos Jalisco Young & Sick, Hailey Knox, EVAN GIIA Awkwafina, Dan Levy, Cameron Diaz 5th October 5–6, 2019[17] Forest Hills, NY Shake Shack x Uncle Boons, Hattie B's Hot Chicken Lolo Zouaï, Your Smith, Abir Questlove, Dwyane Wade 6th May 16–17, 2020 (postponed due to COVID-19)[18] Santa Monica, CA N/A N/A N/A\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nZagat"
