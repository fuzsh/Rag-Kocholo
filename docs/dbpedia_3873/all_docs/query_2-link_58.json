Putting a show in front of an audience -- especially an audience that was not part of the rehearsal and development process -- gives students a chance to learn what parts of their process/choices/interpretations work for an audience and those that do not. Additionally, college productions create a safer space where feedback can be deeply integrated into the process.\n\nDirectors are encouraged to cast students who will be able to grow into their roles over the course of the rehearsal period. It is always the intention of the department to cast a student in a role that they will be able to successfully perform before an audience.\n\nAdditionally, the California Community College System and College of the Canyons places a high emphasis on the completion of an Academic Program. Casting decisions are always a complex matrix of the needs and goals of the production; the ability and skills of each performer; and the matching of those skills with others in the casting pool. Productions are selected by the department to provide a variety of dramatic styles. Aside from serving the needs to those students in the productions as cast or crew, the productions provide opportunities to see live theatre for theatre students at College of the Canyons.\n\nWhen making casting decisions for the production, directors will consider the above stated educational goals, and the below casting priorities to best serve the production and the students.\n\nStudents who have currently declared one of the majors in the theatre department.\n\nStudents registered for other theatre classes (beyond the productions) the semester the show is to be performed or at least one of the two previous semesters (including winter and summer sessions).\n\nStudents who have declared other majors in the School of Visual and Performing Arts\n\nStudents enrolled in other College of the Canyons classes the semester the show is to be performed or at least one of the two previous semesters (including winter and summer sessions)\n\nStudents who are eligible to enroll in the appropriate section of a production class based on their casting in the production.\n\nNOTE For the musical, music majors, and music classes may be substituted for theatre majors and theatre classes in the above list.\n\nUnless there has been prior approval by the Dean of Visual and Performing Arts and the Theatre Department Chair, all roles are required to be filled by a student enrolled in an appropriate production class. Guest artists (those who fall outside the above parameters) must be approved in advance of any casting announcement.\n\nOnly students who can successfully enroll in the correct production class for a specific production will be considered. Once cast, students are required to promptly enroll in the appropriate production class to participate in the production. Failure to do so will result in the student’s role being recast.\n\nThe department strongly supports diversity in casting. Unless specified otherwise in the script, roles are open to all students without regard to any protected class. The department actively welcomes and encourages all the diverse members of our college community to audition for any role.\n\nBefore announcing casting, directors will share the proposed cast list with the Theatre Department’s full-time faculty and the Dean of Visual and Performing Arts for comments and review for compliance with this policy."
