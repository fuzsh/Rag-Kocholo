        "text": "Thank you for continuously enjoying “Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?: Battle Chronicle.”\n\n[02/16 17:00 Update(UTC+9)]\n\nWe have corrected some inaccuracies in the description of the certain special effects that activate.\n\nWe apologize for the inconvenience this has caused.\n\n“Sweet Infatuation: Operation Valentine’s Day Familia Festival” has started as of 12:00 on 2/16 (UTC+9)!\n\nOverview\n\nThe Familia Festival is a ranking event where Familias compete against each other to earn the most “Sweet Infatuation Medal (Gold).”\n\nSweet Infatuation Medal (Gold) can be obtained by clearing the “Exclusive Quests” that are available during the period.\n\nIn Exclusive Quests, the amount of Sweet Infatuation Medal (Gold) you can gain increases the more you defeat enemies, but the amount of attempts you can clear in a day is limited.\n\nDefeating as many enemies in 1 attempt is the key to reaching the top of the Familia rankings.\n\nIn this Exclusive Quest, an Water Attribute Brownback will appear.\n\nAlso, challenging with characters other than those with advantageous attributes will significantly reduce the damage dealt compared to normal quests.\n\nPrepare by upgrading your Electric Attribute Characters.\n\nAlso, we have implemented the following features starting from this Familia Festival.\n\nAdded the feature to view the points earned during battles in the Familia Festival.\n\nAdded a feature that allows you to see how many points each member of the Familia has earned during the Familia Festival.\n\nIn preparation for the main ranking event, we have added a quest called “Ranking Battle (Practice)” in the Event’s “Very Hard” tab.\n\nIt is the same quest content as the main Ranking Battle, so use it to test for the best setups.\n\nRanking Battles can be cleared by surviving within the 180sec time limit while defeating monsters that keep appearing.\n\nUpgrade the Characters that can gain you the most medals and aim for the top of the rankings!\n\nRewards\n\nBelow are some of the rewards obtainable from the Ranking Event.\n\n-Ranking Rewards\n\nYou can receive event Titles, Selas, and Almighty Bond (Rainbow) based on your ranking.\n\n-Total Point Rewards\n\nYou can receive All-Encompassing Falna, Mystical Falna, Selas, and various upgrade materials.\n\nImportant Notice\n\nPlease note that you can only receive the Familia Festival ranking rewards if you are a member of a Familia.\n\nEvent Buff Effect\n\nThe event-specific buff effects granted to certain characters are also applicable in “Ranking Battle” and “Ranking Battle (Practice).”\n\nThe characters with buff bonuses are as follows:\n\nIcon Character Buff Effect Lady of the Gale: Ryu Lion 20% Naive Youth: Bell Cranel 20%\n\nFor details on buffs, please check the notice ““Event “Sweet Infatuation: Operation Valentine’s Day” Now Live”.”\n\nJoining a Familia During the Familia Festival Event Period\n\nIf you are not currently a member of a Familia, you may join a Familia during the event period.\n\nYou may also create a Familia.\n\nIf you are already a member of a Familia, please note that you cannot leave the Familia until the Familia Festival event is finished.\n\nIf you earn event points while not being a member of a Familia and then join one, please be aware that the event points you earned prior to joining will not be reflected in the rankings.\n\nFurthermore, event points earned after joining a Familia will be reflected in the Familia’s ranking.\n\nYou can still receive ranking rewards even if you join a Familia during the event.\n\nAdditionally, if you join a Familia after the end of the ranking quest’s event period, you will not be able to receive ranking rewards.\n\nPeriod\n\nRanking Battle

Infatuation Medal (Gold)” obtained in this event cannot be used in future Ranking Events.\n\nScene Cards, Battle Items, and Titles that can be obtained as rewards for this event may reappear in the future.\n\nAfter the Event ends, you will not be able to play Event-specific quests or scenarios.\n\nItems cannot be exchanged after the Event exclusive Exchange is closed.\n\nWe hope you continue to
