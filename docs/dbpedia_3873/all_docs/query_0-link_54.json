        "text": "Climb upon my knee, Sonny BoyThough your only three, Sonny BoyYou've no way of knowingThere's no way of showing What you mean to me, Sonny BoyWhen there are grey skiesI don't mind the grey skiesYou make them blue, Sonny Boy Friends may forsake meLet them all forsake meI still have you, Sonny Boy.\n\nThe following year he had changed it to:\n\nWhat I couldn't be, Little PalI want you to be, Little PalI want you to laugh and to sing and to play And look after Mummy when Daddy's awayI pray every night Little PalThat you turn out right Little PalBUT If one day you should beOn a new Daddy's kneeDon't forget about me, Little Pal.\n\nOctober 1944\n\nYou will remember only too well what a difficult assignment WALCHEREN was in 1944. The opening of the Scheldt waterway, to give free access to the port of Antwerp was vital to our advancing troops. The Canadian army had advanced through north-west Belgium and carried out very hazardous duties in the Terneuzen and Breskens area of Holland south of the Scheldt, but the actual invasion of Walcheren and Beveland had not yet taken place. Operation \"Infatuate\" involved yet another D Day in late October and the Naval Task Force had to operate after only the briefest of preparation and in atrocious weather. The \"square-saucer\" shape of Walcheren had become a vast flooded plain after the RAF had bombed huge gaps in the sea defences, heavy damage had been done to the small towns and villages, fuel was in short supply, food for the civilian population was scarce and in some cases did not exist at all. You will remember the tough time the R.M. Commandos had in their sea-borne assault, and the difficult job RNBSS 2 had at Weskapelle. WALCHEREN was a severely cold, hungry, desolate and destroyed island. Half a century later everything is quite different.\n\nOctober 1998\n\nThere was very bad weather for the crossing, just as in the old days, but the P&O Ferry from Hull to Europort arrived on time, and the bus conveyed us swiftly to Rotterdam Railway Station. An efficient double-decker train was soon speeding away southwards to Dordrecht, Moerdijk and Roosendaal, en route to Bergen op Zoom, and so westwards over South Beveland via Goes to Middelburg. As we travelled across the islands the brilliant sunshine highlighted the canals and waterways, and our arrival in the historic town of Middelburg was a delight. A comfortable hotel just across the canal from the station offered a warm Dutch welcome, and the clean traffic free shopping streets gave easy access to the busy colourful market. What a contrast from those war time days of agony, when everything was scarred and destroyed. The dignified and beautiful Stadhuis is now skilfully restored and the bells were playing traditional tunes. All around was the busy excitement of bargaining for superior fruit and vegetables; there was a richness of all kinds of cheeses and fish, plants and flowers in abundance and a never ending variety of goods of all kinds on the stalls and in the shops of this totally transformed town."
