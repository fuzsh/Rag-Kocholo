        "text": "Earlier this year, or maybe late last year, Gecko released a 1:35 scale kit of the British Landing Craft, Assault, a small craft designed in the Second World War for carrying infantry onto hostile beaches. After I finish my Churchill AVRE with SBG bridge, I will move on to this one that is also of local interest to me. However, history of the craft as well as details on how it was used in my area will follow in a later post, after I cover the model\n\nThe Gecko kit comes in a pretty large box, 41 cm × 25 cm × 9 cm in size:\n\nIt has the usual lid that comes off, but it’s on so tight it doesn’t really want to — once I got it off, I tried to put it back on and take it off again, and that was still difficult. I then broke the glue in one of the corners, so the lid is on much looser now Under that lid, though, is not a tray like you would expect, but a cardboard box with a flip-up lid, of the design used to send things through the mail. I have a feeling I will be cutting that lid off, because it will only get in the way otherwise when I’m actually building the model.\n\nThe reason for the size of the box soon becomes clear:\n\nThat hull is about 34 cm long, 9 cm wide and 4.5 cm high, moulded in one piece and (by the looks of it) quite straight. I’m pretty impressed so far.\n\nThe other sprues you get are also all in light grey plastic:\n\nThis is all the sprues, including all duplicates you get. Most of the parts are for the boat itself, but in the last picture, all three G-sprues and some parts on the F-sprues are for wooden blocks that you can pose the finished model on, either on its own or you could use them for a diorama with the boat out of the water, for example undergoing maintenance.\n\nAnd there’s a tiny bit of etched brass, two different thicknesses of thread, and a decal sheet:\n\nYou also get instructions, of course, but see Scalemates for those, where I uploaded a PDF of them a few months ago, soon after I bought the kit.\n\nThere are some options provided. You can build the bow ramp and armoured doors open or closed, and the same goes for the armoured flaps over the steering position. The steering position itself has two different armour layouts, with alternative parts provided, and you also get two different engine room hatches for the rear deck to go along with them, either one circular hatch in the middle or a square one either side of the centreline. Also different tie-down cleats for around the deck, and though the kit doesn’t explicitly say so, you can leave out the benches for the infantry in the hold, as those were removable on the real boat.\n\nUnfortunately, one option that isn’t catered for is the armament: you only get a Bren gun, when the real craft were equipped at least as often with a Lewis gun instead (the aircraft version without the chimney around the barrel, as far as I can tell).\n\nThe painting and marking options are, IMHO, a bit of a missed opportunity. Five options are provided: two grey boats, one during training of US troops in the UK in early 1944 and the other used for landing American troops at Algeria in November 1942, plus three camouflaged boats used on Gold Beach in Normandy on 6 June 1944. The grey boats look OK to me, but for the camouflaged ones the wrong colours are indicated and the pattern can’t be right for all of them — it doesn’t conform to official drawings, and though individual boats often deviated from that, I doubt all three would deviate in exactly the same way … The use of black pennant numbers on D-Day is also suspect, though it could be possible.\n\nI call it a missed opportunity because schemes and markings could easily have been provided for boats used in Commando operations in Norway, in Egypt, at Walcheren, in the Rhine crossings, in Burma, and probably in several other places. I guess Gecko figured that more Normandy options means it will sell better?\n\nStill, if this kit assembles as well as it looks, this should be a good one.\n\nLet’s crack on with some history, then Here are some pages from the US Navy publication ONI-226—Allied Landing Craft and Ships (which you can download here), dated 7 April 1944:\n\nThe LCA was originally known as the ALC, for Assault Landing Craft. When the USA joined the war, though, landing craft were standardised between the UK and the USA, but the Americans insisted on their naming system being used. Thus, the ALC became the LCA, for Landing Craft, Assault (with a comma that most people forget ) and because there was only one model, there is no Mark number to go after it.\n\nIt’s a fairly simple boat, obviously designed for infantry and not vehicles because the front ramp is too narrow for anything but a motorcycle, really. The design is interesting in that it actually provides some protection from the weather for two-thirds of its occupants, by having the benches along the sides under the deck. If you ended up on the middle bench, I guess you were out of luck twice: not only out in the weather (and spray) but also nothing to rest your back against. The benches could be removed when carrying cargo or stretchers with wounded.\n\nThe boat was built out of wood, but with armour plating attached to the outside for much of the length, as well as an armoured steering position forward on the starboard side and armour around the machine-gun position opposite it on the port side, and armoured doors at the front, behind the bow ramp. The Royal Navy had (has?) a very awkward system of indicating armour thickness, referring to it by weight rather than thickness for some reason — as you can see in the ONI-226 pages, the LCA has “10-lb. DIHT” armour. There is an explanation on the KBismarck forums: basically, 40 lbs. = 1 inch, but to make this even easier, 1 inch = 24.9 mm rather than the 25.4 mm you would expect… The reason is that the weight given is for a 1-by-1-foot plate of this armour, but a plate that size and 1 inch thick actually weighs slightly more than 40 pounds, so the Navy basically rounded off to neat numbers. To compensate, use slightly smaller inches when converting to real-world numbers that actually mean something to people. All this means that the LCA’s 10-lb. armour is 10 lb. ÷ 40 lb. × 24.9 mm = 6.225 mm thick — call it 6 mm. I’m not sure what DIHT stood for, but the HT part is for “Heat Treated”.\n\nAt the rear of the craft was the engine room, which held two Ford V8 petrol engines driving a three-bladed propeller each. There was rudder directly behind each propeller and cage-type protection bars over the top of it, above the water.\n\nAll in all, 2030 LCAs were built from 1940 through 1944, naturally with minor variations and improvements over the course of production. Here are some good photos of brand-new LCAs being delivered from a shipyard on the Thames in September 1944:\n\nThe LCA was finished from the factory either in a medium grey or in white with a grey-blue “wave” on the side and stern (as in the photos above), but a variety of other camouflage patterns, or variations, could be seen during the war. All carried the letters LCA and the pennant number on both sides of the bow and on the stern. On grey boats this was normally white while camouflaged boats initially had it in black. From about 1944 on, it was red instead, and photos show that some grey boats also had red numbers (making them hard to see in black-and-white pictures).\n\nThanks, I had found that too\n\nI found a US Army research report referring to DIHT as Dynamic Impact Hardness Tested.\n\nOh, nice one — that’s probably what it is. I found “HT” for Heat Treated somewhere else, and assumed it also applied here.\n\nOn with the history of its actual use\n\nThe LCA was used in most, if not all, British landing operations during the war, some of the earliest ones being Commando raids in Norway. Here, for example, is ALC 106 during Operation Archery, the raid on Vågsøy on 27 December 1941:\n\n(IWM N 481)\n\nNot sure what the construction with the four legs and the tin can is, though\n\nIn Operation Jubilee, the raid on Dieppe, the LCA was the main craft used to carry infantry ashore. Here is ALC 233 being loaded with wounded on the beach there:\n\nIt was, of course, also used in the first really large-scale landing operation of the war, Operation Torch in North Africa. These are American troops boarding LCAs:\n\nThe Americans didn’t operate LCAs themselves, though: if you see American troops in them, the boats are Royal Navy ones (as you can tell by the uniforms of the crews here). The American equivalent was the LCP(R), Landing Craft, Personnel (Ramp) — not to be confused with the LCVP, Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel that evolved from the LCV, Landing Craft, Vehicle (which was similar to the LCP(R) but with a bigger ramp), so as to create a single design capable of doing both jobs.\n\nAlso note the Americans are armed with M1903 Springfield rifles instead of M1 Garands, BTW.\n\nNot sure of the chronology of this photo, but AFAIK it was taken in Egypt:\n\nThis must be earlier than Torch, though, as the craft has ALC on the bow and stern, rather than LCA.\n\nAfter Torch, the LCA was also used for the landings in Sicily and mainland Italy, but of course, the biggest thing it was involved in, was Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy. Here are some LCAs with American troops embarked, in some British port:\n\nNot sure whether this is before the crossing to Normandy or during an exercise, though. TBH, I would assume the latter. And Canadian troops being carried to Juno Beach on 6 June 1944:\n\n(Wikimedia Commons)\n\nBritish troops landing on Gold Beach from LCA 431:\n\n(IWM B 5246)\n\nNote also the armoured bulldozer on the left, towing a trailer full of supplies ashore from one of the LCT (3) or (4)s (Landing Craft, Tank Mk. 3 or 4) in the background.\n\nAfter the Normandy landing, the LCA’s wasn’t that useful anymore in Europe until November, when they were used in Operation Infatuate to invade Walcheren:\n\nInterestingly, there is a fellow in an American helmet in the craft here, talking to the coxswain. He appears in several photos, and it appears that he was a war correspondent, either an American or a Canadian, and probably writing for an American newspaper. The town on the horizon is Vlissingen, but more on this landing in the next message\n\nThe LCA was probably also used for the Rhine river crossing in March 1945, Operation Plunder, but it’s hard to find photos of it. The only pictures I could find just now showed American LCVPs.\n\nBut that’s not the end: in January of 1945, LCAs were also being used in the Burma campaign in South-East Asia:\n\n(source: The Campaign in Burma, published by HMSO for South East Asia Command, undated but probably in 1945)\n\nThis is a very little-known part of the war, but the British-Indian Army performed amphibious operations here as part of the general offensive through Burma, to drive the Japanese back to Thailand. Some were apparently also even used in the Pacific towards the end of the war there.\n\nOh, and this photo may also be of interest here:\n\n(IWM A 14350)\n\nThat’s a wooden replica of an LCA at the Combined Operations School at Dundonald Camp, for practicing how to exit a landing craft.\n\n(With thanks to Arjan Wiskerke for supplying several of the photos above, as well as general information on the craft.)"
