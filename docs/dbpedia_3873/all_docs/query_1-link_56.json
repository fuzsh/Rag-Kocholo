        "text": "Kuya Lord is an elevated fast casual restaurant concept by Chef Lord Maynard Llera featuring regional Filipino dishes that he grew up eating in Lucena City, Quezon Province, Philippines. While the food harkens back to his childhood, Chef Maynard applies his classical techniques in enhancing and reinventing traditional Filipino dishes.\n\nThe monicker Kuya Lord is derived from the Tagalog word for “older brother” combined with the chef’s name “Lord Maynard.” This was also the name of the garage pop-up which developed quite a substantial following, prompting the chef to use the same brand for this Los Angeles location.\n\nA few seats for sit-down dining are available, but mostly accepting take-out and advance order catering.\n\nBefore the pandemic hit in 2019, Llera launched his Kuya Lord pop-ups that brought his spin on Southern Tagalog cuisine to wine bars, breweries, food events, and private dining rooms. Through those pop-ups, he was able to showcase all of his three restaurant concepts: fine dining, fast casual and street food.\n\nWhen COVID-19 struck and Californians were made to stay home, Kuya took the opportunity to do some research and development, and cultivate recipes for his upcoming projects. He then converted his La Cañada Flintridge house garage and backyard into a full kitchen and grill.\n\nFor the first few months, Kuya Lord and his wife Gigi, cooked Filipino food for friends, relatives and people who have been long time followers, and through word of mouth, more people inquired about his food.\n\nThat was how Kuya Lord came to be as people started picking up food on a weekly basis and the most favorite was the gigantic portions of various dishes served family style.\n\nThis snowballed into being featured in many articles written about Kuya Lord's food. That was how he developed his brand.\n\nWith the world opening up once again, he has decided to give this concept a permanent home at a 28-seater space in their East Hollywood location.\n\nCHEF LORD MAYNARD LLERA\n\nBorn and raised in the Philippines, Chef Maynard migrated to the U.S. in 2004 to study culinary arts, with the ultimate goal of opening his own restaurant. After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York, Llera moved to Los Angeles where he hit the ground running. He found himself working in some of the hottest kitchens in the West Coast with Chefs Neal Fraser, Nyesha Arrington, Walter Manske, and more prominently as the sous chef to Ori Menashe at one of the city’s favorite restaurants, BESTIA.\n\nLlera also became the Culinary Director of the h.wood Group, developing its culinary program, and creating restaurant concepts across the US, including its premier signature establishments - The Nice Guy, Delilah, 40 Love, Harriet's and SLAB. He left the company in 2019 and in 2022, he finally decided to open up his very own restaurant, Kuya Lord, located in Melrose Hills.\n\nOn June 10, 2024, Chef Maynard won the James Beard award for Best Chef in California."
