        "text": "Definition of Yahoo Search: The genesis of a web pioneer\n\nThrough our SEO Agency Optimize 360.\n\nWhen it comes to search engines, it's hard to ignore Yahoo Search, a pioneer in the field that has evolved over the years to maintain its place as one of the most widely used online search tools.\n\nIn this article, our SEO Agency will explore the definition of Yahoo Search, as well as its history and its various innovations over the years.\n\nDefinition of Yahoo Search\n\nYahoo Search is a search engine developed by Yahoo, enabling Internet users to search for and consult a wide range of content on the web, including web pages, videos, images, news and commercial products. Although Yahoo is no longer the leading search engine, it was a major player in the early days of the web in the 90s.\n\nDirectory first and foremost\n\nIn its early years, Yahoo Search was more of adirectory rather than a search engine.\n\nIt then listed the various websites and web pages according to a thematic classification, making it easier to navigate between the different pages posted online.\n\nHowever, with the rapid growth of the Internet and the massive influx of new pages, this system quickly showed its limitations, prompting Yahoo to innovate and transform itself into a genuine search engine capable of automatically indexing the entire web.\n\nA history marked by evolution\n\nThe Yahoo Search search engine as we know it today is the result of a long evolution and several acquisitions, but let's take a look back at the major milestones along the way.\n\nThe beginnings in 1994: the creation of Yahoo!\n\nYahoo! was launched in January 1994 under the name \"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web\".created by Jerry Yang and David Filo, two engineering students at Stanford University. Their simple web directory quickly attracted a large number of Internet users. Faced with this growing popularity, the two founders decided to rename their site \"Yahoo!\", an acronym for \"Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle\".\n\nYahoo! was officially launched on 1 March 1995.\n\nThe alliance with Inktomi and then Google\n\nIn the early 2000s, Yahoo decides to move up a gear by upgrading its directory. To achieve this, the company is forging a number of partnerships, including one with Inktomi, a company specialising in search engines.\n\nThe merger has paid off, as Yahoo can now draw on Inktomi's index to display its search results.\n\nHowever, in 2002, Yahoo also entered into an alliance with Google, which was booming at the time. The partnership saw Yahoo use Google's index to improve the relevance of its search results.\n\nAcquisition of Overture and integration of its technology\n\nContinuing its success in the search engine sector, In 2003 Yahoo acquired Overture Services Inc.a company specialising in search-related advertising. In particular, this acquisition will enable Yahoo to integrate \"sponsored search\" technology, i.e. the possibility of generating revenue via advertising links displayed on the basis of keywords typed in by Internet users.\n\nInktomi : Retrieval and creation of the index of pages and websites.\n\nAlltheWeb High-performance search engine for richer query responses.\n\nOverture (formerly GoTo.com) Technology linked to bids for sponsored terms on the first page.\n\nThis strategy paid off: in 2005, Yahoo Search attracted more than two billion unique visitors a month, making it one of the top destinations on the Internet for online searches.\n\nThe last few years : Bing and Verizon\n\nHowever, in the face of Google's growing power and Microsoft's efforts to impose its search engine BingYahoo is struggling to maintain its market position. In 2009, the company signed an agreement with Microsoft to pool their strengths and use the Bing search platform to feed the results displayed on Yahoo Search.\n\nFinally, in 2017, Yahoo is bought by the American group VerizonYahoo Search, which wanted to strengthen its presence in the online media and advertising sector. Since then, Yahoo Search has continued to evolve and offer its services to millions of Internet users around the world.\n\nA comprehensive search engine offering\n\nIt is interesting to note that Yahoo is not just a search engine. Over the years, the company has developed a wide range of services to support Internet users in their day-to-day browsing. These related services include :\n\nElectronic messaging Yahoo Mail provides users with a free, secure online mailbox for managing their email.\n\nThe news Yahoo also offers a comprehensive news and entertainment portal (Yahoo News, Yahoo Sports, etc.).\n\nFinancial income Yahoo Finance: With Yahoo Finance, users can access information on stock markets, companies and share prices in real time.\n\nClassified ads With Yahoo Auctions, Internet users have a space where they can buy and sell various objects or services online."
