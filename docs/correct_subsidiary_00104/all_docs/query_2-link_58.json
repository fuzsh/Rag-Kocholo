The Board of Directors of each of the Company (the \"Company Board of Directors\"), Parent and Merger Sub, has approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.\n\nC. The Company Board of Directors has resolved to recommend to its stockholders approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.\n\nD.

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.\n\nG. For United States federal income tax purposes, the parties intend that the Merger qualify as a \"reorganization\" under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the \"Code\"), and the parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a \"plan of reorganization\" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations, Section 1.368-2(g).\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective covenants, agreements, representations and warranties set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:\n\nARTICLE I\n\nTHE MERGER\n\n1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the \"Reverse Merger\"); provided, however, that if at the Effective Time, the Reverse Merger would not satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(e) hereof, then at the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the Company shall be merged with and\n\n1\n\ninto Merger Sub, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation (the \"Forward Merger\") (either the Reverse Merger or the Forward Merger, as applicable, shall sometimes be referred to herein as the \"Merger\"). The Company (in the case of the Reverse Merger) and Merger Sub (in the case of the Forward Merger), as the surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the \"Surviving Corporation\".\n\n1.2 Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the \"Certificate of Merger\") (the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the \"Effective Time\") as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as defined below). The closing of the Merger (the \"Closing\") shall take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Xxxxxxx & Xxxx LLP, located at 000 Xxxxxxxxxx Xxxxxx, Xxxx Xxxx, Xxxxxxxxxx, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the \"Closing Date\").\n\n1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.\n\n1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.\n\n(a) Reverse Merger. Subject to Section 1.4(b), at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: \"The name of the corporation is Overture Services, Inc.\" and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended as necessary to comply with the obligations of Parent set forth in Section 5.15(a). At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such Bylaws, provided, however, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended as necessary to comply with the obligations of Parent set forth in Section 5.15(a).\n\n(b) Forward Merger. In the event of the Forward Merger, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: \"The name of the corporation is Overture Services, Inc.\" and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended as necessary to comply with the obligations of Parent set forth in Section 5.15(a).

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, the following shall occur:\n\n(a) Company Common Stock. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (together with the associated Company Right (as defined in Section 2.2) under the Company Rights Agreement (as defined in Section 2.2) (\"Company Common Stock\") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the \"Shares\"), other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c), and other than as provided in Section 1.8 with respect to Shares as for which appraisal rights have been perfected, will be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Section 1.6(f)) into the right to receive (i) 0.6108 of a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share (the \"Exchange Ratio\") of the common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent (together with any associated Parent Right (as defined in Section 3.3) under the Parent Rights Agreement (as defined in Section 3.3)) (\"Parent Common Stock\") and (ii) $4.75 in cash (the \"Per Share Cash Consideration\") (collectively, the Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash Consideration are referred to herein as the \"Merger Consideration\") (upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 1.9)).\n\n(b) Repurchase Rights. If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then (i) the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends and (ii) the Per Share Cash Consideration in respect of such shares shall be paid to the holder thereof over time upon satisfaction of the vesting requirements associated with the applicable restricted stock schedule. The Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement in accordance with its terms.\n\n(c) Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.\n\n(d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the \"Merger Sub Common Stock\") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.\n\n(e) Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans. At the Effective Time, all Company Options (as defined in Section 5.8(a)) outstanding under each Option Plan (as defined in Section 5.8(a)) shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.8(a). Rights outstanding\n\n3\n\nunder the ESPP (as defined in Section 5.8(c)) and any other employee stock purchase plan of the Company shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.8(c).\n\n(f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder's Certificate(s) (as defined in Section 1.7(c)), receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest, less the amount of any withholding taxes as contemplated by Section 1.7(f), which are required to be withheld with respect thereto, equal to the product of: (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average closing sale price of one share of Parent Common Stock for the ten (10) most recent trading days that Parent Common Stock has traded ending on the trading day one day prior to the Effective Time, as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (\"Nasdaq\").\n\n(g) Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of (i) any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any declaration, payment or distribution by Parent of any dividend or distribution (whether in cash or other property) in respect of Parent Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.\n\n1.7 Surrender of Certificates.\n\n(a) Exchange Agent. Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the \"Exchange Agent\") in the Merger.\n\n(b) Parent to Provide Merger Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, which shall provide that Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable and cash payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. In addition, Parent shall make available as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time as needed, cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Any cash and Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the \"Exchange Fund.\"\n\n(c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the \"Certificates\") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with\n\n4\n\nsuch letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(a), (y) the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article I after taking into account all the shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all such Certificates so surrendered (together with cash payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f)) and (z) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted, the right to receive the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d).\n\n(d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date hereof with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest (i) promptly after such surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued and amount of Per Share Cash Consideration paid in exchange therefor along with cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.\n\n(e) Transfers of Ownership. If shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in the name of, or Per Share Cash Consideration paid to, a person other than the person in whose name the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 2.7) required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the name of, or payment of Per Share Cash Consideration to, any person other than the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.\n\n(f) Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.4(b)). To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.\n\n5\n\n(g) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.\n\n(h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I shall promptly be paid to Parent.\n\n(i) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section 1.7 shall after such delivery to Surviving Corporation look only to the Surviving Corporation for the shares of Parent Common Stock and amount of Per Share Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(a), cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d) with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 2.4(d)) shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.\n\n1.8 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 1.6, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL (the \"Dissenting Shares\") shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its rights to appraisal or it is determined that such holder does not have appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, or if it is determined that such holder does not have an appraisal right, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive in exchange for each Share the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands except as required by applicable law. The Company shall not, except with prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, unless and to the extent required to do so under applicable law.\n\n1.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued, all cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6(f)) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.\n\n6\n\n1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.
