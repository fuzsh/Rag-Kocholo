The mystery is now solved: Yahoo confirmed to Search Engine Land that it has decommissioned that tool once and for all.\n\nYahoo, which acquired Overture in 2003, said earlier this year it wasnâ€™t supporting the tool anymore because it had developed new, proprietary keyword research features for marketers with Panama advertising accounts. Still, they insisted the tool was still active, just subject to limited server availability. (I tried unsuccessfully to log for a week straight.)\n\nThen, last week, the URL for that tool started to redirect to a Yahoo Search Marketing landing page. And with that, the Overture tool was history.\n\nAlthough Barry Schwartz at Search Engine Land sounds a note of nostalgia for the end of an era in search marketing, he points out that there are plenty of keyword research tools still available for marketers. Check them out in our Online Keyword Research Guide:\n\nhttp://www.marketingsherpa.com/article.html?ident=30683"
