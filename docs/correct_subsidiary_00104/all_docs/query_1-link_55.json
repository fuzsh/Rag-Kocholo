        "text": "US internet giant Yahoo! has continued its acquisition spree, splashing out £319m on online price comparison service Kelkoo, the latest in a series of blockbuster deals that have rekindled memories of the dotcom boom.\n\nKelkoo, which enables users to compare the prices of products across hundreds of online retailers, has seen off several well-funded competitors since its launch in 1999.\n\nDozens of investors saw price comparison as an area in which the internet could beat the high street.\n\nBut only Kelkoo secured the critical mass of customers necessary to attract high volumes of advertising and generate large payments from retailers when shoppers are referred to their sites.\n\nIt now operates across nine European countries.\n\nSince its launch, Kelkoo has acquired rivals in the UK, Spain, Norway and France and has been profitable since the fourth quarter of 2002.\n\nThe founder and chief executive, Pierre Chappaz, said the deal would \"help Kelkoo extend its leading presence in Europe\".\n\n\"Our teams across Europe have worked tirelessly to create the region's number one comparison shopping service and we anticipate this transaction will enable us to further invest in developing the ultimate online shopping experience for consumers,\" he added.\n\nThe latest acquisition, which comes hard on the heels of Yahoo!'s purchase of paid-for search giant Overture and search technology firm Inktomi, ties in with the plan of its chief executive, Terry Semel, to diversify the company's revenue streams.\n\nSince Mr Semel, a former Warner Brothers chairman, took the helm at Yahoo! in 2001, he has attempted to prune back the excesses of the dotcom boom and bust and focus on increasing revenues through search-based advertising and paid-for services such as online dating.\n\n\"Kelkoo will add depth and breadth to Yahoo!'s integrated network of services for consumers and adds another set of powerful tools to marketers seeking to reach them,\" he said.\n\nSearch has become the new battleground for the major US internet giants.\n\nYahoo! and Microsoft are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into catching up with Google, which remains the number one search site.\n\nGoogle recently expanded its own advertising operations, using its search technology to allow advertisers to insert Google-sponsored links next to relevant content on websites.\n\nIt has also launched its own price comparison service, Froogle.\n\nThe rapid growth of paid-for search, which allows advertisers to bid on key words and display their advert next to search results or beside relevant content, has also accelerated the race to dominate the market.\n\nThe purchase of Kelkoo, which has recently launched its own contextual advertising service, will increase Yahoo!'s user base and boost its advertising revenues.\n\n· To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"
