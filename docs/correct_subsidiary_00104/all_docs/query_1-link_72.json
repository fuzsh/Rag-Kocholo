        "text": "Yahoo! was founded in January 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo, who were electrical engineering graduates at Stanford University[1] when they created a website named \"Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web\". The Guide was a directory of other websites, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages. In April 1994, Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web was renamed \"Yahoo!\".[2][3] The word \"YAHOO\" is a backronym for \"Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle\"[4] or \"Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.\"[5] The yahoo.com domain was created on January 18, 1995.[6]\n\nSee also: Timeline of Yahoo!\n\nYahoo! grew rapidly through 1990â€“1999 and diversified into a web portal, followed by numerous high-profile acquisitions. The company's stock price rose rapidly during the dot-com bubble and closed at an all-time high of US$118.75 in 2000.[7] However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached an all-time low of $8.11 in 2001.[8] Yahoo! formally rejected an acquisition bid from the Microsoft Corporation in 2008.[9] In early 2012, Yahoo laid off 2,000 employees (14 percent of the workforce). This was the largest layoff in Yahoo!'s history.[10]\n\nCarol Bartz replaced co-founder Yang as chief executive officer in January 2009,[11] but was fired by the board of directors in September 2011. Tim Morse was appointed as interim CEO following Bartz's departure.[12] Former PayPal president Scott Thompson became CEO in January 2012 and after he resigned was replaced by Ross Levinsohn as the company's interim CEO on May 13, 2012. On July 16, former Google executive Marissa Mayer became the CEO of the company.[13]\n\nMayer resigned as CEO of Yahoo in 2017, when it sold to Verizon for $4.48 billion, following Yahoo's disclosure of security breaches.[14] Guru Gowrappan was CEO of Yahoo from 2018-2021.\n\nJim Lanzone is the current CEO of Yahoo, appointed September 2021."
