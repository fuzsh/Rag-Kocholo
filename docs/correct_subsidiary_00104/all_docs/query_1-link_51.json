        "text": "This case draws upon the literature on appropriate leadership behaviors that Yahoo’s Founders or CEOs could have adopted. It discusses the process of environmental analysis that would have an impact on Yahoo!’s strategy. It discusses and depicts the levels of environmental analyzes that Yahoo! as a firm ought to have undertaken in mapping its competitive environment. Further, this case discusses transformational leadership factors and those behavioral traits that exemplify each of these factors. Finally, the four elements of aspiration in discussing future firm direction are identified. These include an appropriate vision translated into a clarifying mission reflected in specific objectives grounded in explicit value statements.\n\nYahoo!, in its 22 years of existence, has demonstrated remarkable tumult. It has witnessed a succession of six CEOs, exhibited a roller coaster trajectory in its stock price and, for the most part of its existence, played “catch-up” with its strategic competitors. It has also struggled to define its core purpose, its industry category and its very essence of being. In early 2016, CEO Marissa Mayer announced that Yahoo! would be willing to sell its core internet business and that its board would “engage on qualified strategic proposals.” However, the board also reiterated that turning around Yahoo! to prosperity continued to remain a top priority. What went wrong, so terribly wrong, with Yahoo! in an otherwise lucrative industry? Does Yahoo! suffer from a fundamental, essential malaise which, if addressed, could restore it to wealth and vibrancy? This case focuses on the period 1994, the inception of Yahoo!, to early 2016. The acquisition of Yahoo! by Verizon, completed in 2017, is not to be considered for purposes of this case study.\n\nThis case is particularly suited to be taught in a capstone strategic management course for MBA/Master’s level business students, after they have been exposed to core courses in Marketing, Business Law, Accounting, Supply Chain, Corporate Finance. It may also be taught in an advanced strategy course for undergraduate business students, typically in their final year of study. Finally, this case can be used to teach senior management in executive management programs."
