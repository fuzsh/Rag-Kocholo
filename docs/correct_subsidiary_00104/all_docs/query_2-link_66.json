With respect to the licenses granted under this Section 2.5, Overture will undertake all reasonable efforts to cause Overture Affiliates to grant to Yahoo identical licenses under the Overture Affiliate IP in the applicable regional markets. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, to the extent that Overture elects to transfer any Overture Licensed IP to any Overture Affiliate during the term of any license granted under this Section 2.5, such that the affected Overture Licensed IP becomes Overture Affiliate IP, Overture will undertake all steps necessary to ensure that Yahoo maintains the licenses hereunder to that Overture Affiliate IP. (f) Royalty. [*], the parties agree that the royalty payable under the license set forth in [*] should be [*]. For purposes of [*], a FMV royalty shall * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 11 <PAGE> EXECUTION CONFIDENTIAL mean a royalty that would be agreed upon by a willing licensee and willing licensor in an arms length negotiation for a license of a substantially similar scope to the license granted under the applicable Section. Taking those factors into account, the parties agree that the royalty payable by Yahoo for exercise of the license under [*] (the \"Applicable Royalty\") shall be as follows: (1) Upon Expiration. In the event of expiration of this Agreement, the Applicable Royalty shall be as follows: [*] (2) Upon Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement under Section 15.4 (Termination for Change of Control) or other termination of this Agreement other than by reason of Yahoo's breach, the Applicable Royalty shall be as follows: [*] Under no circumstances shall the FMV royalty under [*] or the Applicable Royalty under [*] be payable until Yahoo commences to exercise the applicable license thereunder, nor shall it extend beyond the term of the applicable license (and, in no event, beyond [*]). (g) Procedure for Determination of Royalty. Upon written notice by Yahoo (1) no less than [*] days for purposes of Section 2.5[*], and (2) no sooner than [*] under Section 2.5(f)(2) for purposes of Section 2.5[*], Yahoo and Overture will negotiate in good faith and undertake commercially reasonable efforts to establish a FMV royalty. Upon such notice, each party will provide the other party with such information as the requesting party may reasonably request for purposes of establishing FMV, including but not limited to information concerning royalty-rates or other consideration under any other licenses granted by Overture under any Overture Licensed IP. Failure to mutually agree upon a specific royalty within [*] days after that notice will constitute an Escalation Event under Section 16.5(a) below. If the procedures outlined under Section 16.5(a) fail to resolve the royalty, then, unless the parties mutually agree upon a third party appraiser to determine FMV, the parties agree to submit the determination of the royalty to arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with Section 16.5(b) below, except that the Panel shall hold a hearing and render its decision within 90 days after appointment of the third arbitrator of the Panel. Either party shall be entitled from time to time to request that FMV be re-determined in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5(g), provided that such request shall not be made within [*] months after the previous determination of FMV; such re-determined FMV shall be used to compute the Applicable Royalty prospectively, effective as of the date such re-determination is requested in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5(g). (h) Other License Provisions. At the same time and under the same procedure as for the determination of a royalty under Subsection 2.5(g) above, the parties shall in good faith negotiate to determine the remaining provisions of the licenses under Sections 2.5[*], including but not limited to provisions relating to payment procedure, reporting procedure, record keeping requirements, audit procedure, default and cure, termination and dispute resolution. (i) Assignment. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 16.2, Yahoo may, [*] the prior * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 12 <PAGE> EXECUTION CONFIDENTIAL written consent of Overture, assign the licenses and other rights granted under this Section 2.5 to any entity that succeeds to all or substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Yahoo. Upon such assignment, the license set forth in this Section 2.5 will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and assigns. (j) Covenant not to Sue. Overture, on behalf of itself and the Overture Affiliates, covenants that neither Overture nor the Overture Affiliates will sue either (1) any advertiser for its use of or participation in an Equivalent Search Product operated by Yahoo or a Yahoo Affiliate in accordance with the licenses granted hereunder; or (2) any third party other than an [*] solely for its [*] in accordance with the licenses granted hereunder. For clarity, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit any claims of Overture against any third party with respect to any act or omission other than [*] in accordance with the licenses granted hereunder. (k) Termination. Yahoo will be entitled to terminate the foregoing licenses, in whole or as to any Overture Licensed IP, at any time on written notice to Overture. Should Overture terminate this Agreement under Section 15.2 below by reason of Yahoo's breach of this Agreement, all licenses under this Section 2.5 terminate. In addition, should Yahoo divest itself of all or part of a Yahoo Affiliate, such that the affected Yahoo Affiliate no longer is a Yahoo Affiliate as defined hereunder, all licenses under this Section 2.5 terminate with respect to that affected Yahoo Affiliate. (l) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as imposing any obligation upon Overture to provide any data, know-how or other information to Yahoo or the Yahoo Affiliates under the licenses identified in this Section 2.5. 2.6 Ownership; Reservation of Rights. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not affect ownership by either party of any of its intellectual property rights, content, products and services, and nothing set forth in this Agreement shall be construed as the assignment or transfer of any ownership rights in any of the foregoing from one party to the other. Other than the express licenses set forth in this Section 2, nothing in this Agreement, and nothing in any press release or other statement made in connection with this Agreement (including but not limited to the press release planned under Section 12.3 below), will be deemed a license (by implication, estoppel or otherwise) under either party's patent rights or other intellectual property rights. Nothing in this Agreement, and nothing in any press release or in any other statement made in connection with this Agreement, will be deemed an admission by either party that any existing, planned or contemplated products, services or technology of the other party infringes or does not infringe its (or a third party's) patent or other intellectual property rights or that the other party's (or a third party's) patent or other intellectual property is valid. Likewise, neither party's performance according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement will in any way broaden the intellectual property rights of the other party. Both parties reserve all rights not expressly granted. 2.7 Non-Waiver of Claims. Nothing herein constitutes a waiver of any pre-existing claims of one party against entities, or with respect to businesses, services or product lines, acquired by the other party during the Term of this Agreement or the term of a license under Section 2.5 above. 3. Maintenance of Yahoo Search Box; Delivery of Yahoo Search Queries. 3.1 Yahoo Search Box. Yahoo will enable all U.S. Users to initiate Yahoo Search Queries through the Yahoo Search Box. Yahoo will display the Yahoo Search Box on the front page of Yahoo Search and all Yahoo Search Results Pages. Yahoo will be entitled to display commerce-related \"universal\" search boxes (i.e., shopping and/or auctions) on the front page of Yahoo Search no * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 13 <PAGE> EXECUTION CONFIDENTIAL more than 5 days in a month. The Yahoo Search Box shall be the only [*] search functionality for general searches (e.g., [*]) of the World Wide Web displayed within the Yahoo Network during the Term (e.g., [*]). Yahoo will be entitled to [*] and to derive search traffic [*] (or similar search functionality) on [*] provided that such search traffic is directed to the Yahoo Search Results Pages. If Yahoo exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, then the parties will negotiate in good faith for the purpose of executing an amendment to this Agreement, which amendment will, at Overture's option, either (a) address the manner in which [*] and the method by which Yahoo will be compensated for such traffic; or (b) provide for the suppression of [*] for those Yahoo Search Results Pages displayed in response to a Yahoo Search Query from this [*], in which case the resulting Impression would not be counted hereunder and the provisions of Section 7 would not apply. 3.2 Yahoo Search Queries; Delivery by Yahoo. Except as set forth in Section 5.4, Yahoo will send the Yahoo Search Query to Overture each and every time that a U.S. User initiates a search through a Yahoo Search Box. When a U.S. User submits a Yahoo Search Query by clicking on the \"next\" button on a Yahoo Search Results Page, Yahoo will differentiate the Yahoo Search Query in a manner acceptable to Overture so that Overture can deliver Overture Results that differ from those Overture Results appearing on the prior Yahoo Search Results Pages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Yahoo acknowledges and agrees that Overture will be entitled to deliver the same Overture Results for any Yahoo Search Query initiated by a \"next\" button to the extent that Overture does not have additional Overture Results for the keyword or phrase. As of the Effective Date, the parties do not intend this Agreement to apply to Yahoo Search or to any search functionality within a Yahoo Vertical to the extent that the search functionality is accessed or enabled through wireless or voice services (however, the parties may include such wireless and voice services during the Term by mutual consent). 4. Delivery and Maintenance of Overture Results. 4.1 Delivery by Overture. After receiving a Yahoo Search Query from Yahoo, Overture will deliver to Yahoo, according to the Service Level Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A, either Overture Results or a response that no results are being delivered for that Yahoo Search Query. Overture will be entitled to redirect URLs embedded within the Overture Results in the process of transferring a user to the Advertiser site promoted within the applicable Overture Result, so that Overture is able to record Actual Clicks. (a) Remedies. The parties acknowledge that it is in the financial best interest of both parties to avert Unresolved Catastrophic Problems and Recurrent Problems, as such terms are defined in the Service Level Agreement attached as Exhibit A hereto and this Agreement, respectively, and that the damages attributable to such Unresolved Catastrophic Problems and Recurrent Problems would be difficult to ascertain. Therefore, the parties have specified the liquidated damages below as a reasonable estimate of such damages and as each party's sole and exclusive remedy other than termination (in the event of an uncured, material breach pursuant to Section 15.2 below) for such Unresolved Catastrophic Problems that prevent Overture from fulfilling its delivery obligations pursuant to Section 4.1 above and for Recurrent Problems. For purposes of this Section 4.1, a \"Recurrent Problem\" means any Problem, Severe Problem, or Catastrophic Problem (each, individually, a \"Recurrent Problem Element\"), or any combination of Recurrent Problem Elements, which renders the Overture Results unavailable or unusable for more than [*] in any [*], and is attributable to a single party. (1) Yahoo Remedy for Unresolved Catastrophic Problems. For any Unresolved Catastrophic Problem within the reasonable control of Overture, Overture will pay to Yahoo an amount calculated as [*] of Gross Revenue that Yahoo would have earned pursuant to this Agreement during the period beginning [*] after the earlier of Overture's * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 14 <PAGE> EXECUTION CONFIDENTIAL learning of, or Yahoo's providing notice to Overture that a Problem, Severe Problem or Catastrophic Problem attributable to Overture has been detected but not resolved. Overture's liability for such payment will not extend beyond the point in time when (i) Overture has resolved the Catastrophic Problem, even if Yahoo has elected to manually override pursuant to Section IV(F) of the Service Level Agreement; or (ii) a Yahoo Technical Lapse is in effect. For clarity, Overture's liability would continue to accrue incrementally if Yahoo resolves such Technical Lapse but Overture has not resolved the Catastrophic Problem. (2) Overture Remedy for Unresolved Catastrophic Problems. In the event of any Unresolved Catastrophic Problem within the reasonable control of Yahoo, Yahoo will pay to Overture an amount calculated as [*] of Gross Revenue that Overture would have earned pursuant to this Agreement during the period beginning [*] after the earlier of Yahoo's learning of, or Overture's providing notice to Yahoo that a Problem, Severe Problem or Catastrophic Problem attributable to Yahoo has been detected but not resolved. Yahoo's liability for such payment will not extend beyond the point in time when (i) Yahoo has resolved the Catastrophic Problem to meet the acceptable performance standards set forth in the Service Level Agreement, or (ii) a technical lapse by Overture (such as a Problem, Severe Problem or Catastrophic Problem attributable to Overture) is in effect. For clarity, Yahoo's liability would continue to accrue if Overture resolves such technical lapse but Yahoo has not resolved the Catastrophic Problem. (3) The Parties' Remedies for Recurrent Problems. The party responsible for any Recurrent Problem will pay the non-breaching party (the \"NBP\") an amount calculated as the [*] of Gross Revenue that the NBP would have earned during the total period in which the Recurrent Problem Elements occurred. The beginning of this period commences [*] after the party that is responsible for the Recurrent Problem initially learns of, or receives notice of, the occurrence of the first Recurrent Problem Element in the Recurrent Problem. The liability of the party responsible for the Recurrent Problem will not extend beyond the point in time when the responsible party has resolved the final Recurrent Problem Element in the Recurrent Problem and will not include periods when the NBP experiences a technical lapse during a Recurrent Problem Element. For clarity, the responsible party's liability would continue to accrue incrementally if the NBP resolves such technical lapse but the responsible party has not resolved the Recurrent Problem Element. 4.2 Suppression by Overture. Overture will suppress delivery of certain Overture Results to Yahoo in accordance with the following: (a) [*]-Related Overture Results. Overture will suppress [*]-related Overture Results, at a minimum, to the same degree as the [*] that appear on the Overture Site as of the Effective Date. Upon receipt by Overture of [*] Yahoo Search Query for which Overture has [*] Overture Results, Overture will send to Yahoo such [*] Overture Results. For all other [*] Yahoo Search Queries, Overture shall not return any Overture Results, and if Overture does send an Overture Result, then Yahoo shall be entitled to block such Overture Result from being displayed pursuant to Section 4.5(a) below. The parties acknowledge and agree that the delivery of [*]-related Overture Results to Yahoo is not contemplated by this Agreement and, thus, [*]. (b) Overture Results related to [*]. Overture will suppress Overture Results that link directly to a page owned or operated by [*]. * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 15 <PAGE> EXECUTION CONFIDENTIAL (c) Overture Results in response to Excluded Terms. Overture will not deliver Overture Results to Yahoo in response to a U.S. User's search of the Yahoo Search for an Excluded Term. (d) Overture Results identified by Yahoo. Upon a reasonable request by Yahoo according to Section 4.5 below, Overture agrees to cease delivery of the affected Overture Result. (e) Suppression of all Overture Results. Overture will be entitled to cease delivery of all Overture Results for any Yahoo Search Query in Overture's keyword marketplace that triggers Overture's compliance obligations under this Section 4.2. 4.3 Display by Yahoo. After receiving Overture Results from Overture in response to a Yahoo Search Query, Yahoo will display the Required Number of Overture Results in the Featured Sections as provided for in this Agreement, unless Overture provides less than the Required Number of Overture Results to Yahoo in response to the particular Yahoo Search Query, in which case Yahoo will display all Overture Results provided by Overture in the Featured Sections. (a) Order and Appearance. On the Effective Date and during any population test pursuant to the Estimated Yahoo Payment and Guaranteed Fixed Payment Adjustment Process set forth in Exhibit K, the Yahoo Search Results Page shall be displayed as provided for in Exhibit C. Yahoo will display the Overture Results in the order provided by Overture. Yahoo will display Overture Results in the Featured Sections with Overture's full title and a truncated description, both of which together will consist of no less than 88 characters (as shown in the mock-up attached as Exhibit C hereto), as well as with the full URL of the web page associated with each Overture Result. When viewed via Microsoft's principal \"Internet Explorer\" browser product (U.S. versions 4.0 and higher) on the Microsoft Windows platform or any other browser that easily supports a mouse over implementation, the title will give rise to the full description to the extent that the user passes his or her cursor over the title (a \"Mouse Over\"), which Mouse Over will be substantially similar in form to the example set forth in Exhibit C. Yahoo will not modify [*] of the Overture Results, except that Yahoo will truncate the description as described in the foregoing sentence. The only content in the Featured Sections shall be the Overture Results and the Yahoo Results, as provided for in this Agreement. All of the Search Result Characteristics of the Overture Results and the Yahoo Results in the Featured Sections, as well as the Exclusive Result, shall be identical. To the extent that the [*] of the Overture Results and the [*] are not identical to the Main Body Search Results, Yahoo will provide Overture with written notice, and any dispute regarding the difference between [*] will be deemed an Escalation Event that is not subject to arbitration under * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 16 <PAGE> EXECUTION CONFIDENTIAL Section 16.5(b) below (i.e., [*]). The entire first search result in the Featured Top Section shall appear Above the Fold. The heading of the Featured Sections shall be \"Sponsor Matches\" or such other heading as is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Yahoo agrees that it will not [*]. (b) Increases in the Required Number of Overture Results. Yahoo will be entitled to increase the number of Overture Results that appear within the Featured Sections as long as Yahoo (a) provides Overture with no less than [*] prior written notice of the increase setting forth the keywords and terms for which the number of Overture Results shall be increased and the duration of time that the increase will last (which in no event shall be less than [*]); (b) enlarges the applicable Featured Section, as determined by Yahoo, proportionally to account for the increased number of Overture Results; and (c) confers with Overture regarding possible revisions to the Service Level Agreement in order to account for the additional Overture Results and, to the extent that the parties cannot agree on the appropriate revision or whether a revision to the Service Level Agreement is warranted at all, the parties will resolve the issue via the escalation provisions set forth in Section 16.5(a). If Yahoo elects to [*] within the Featured Sections after the date that is [*] from the Effective Date, then Yahoo will provide Overture with [*] days prior written notice, and Yahoo agrees to add one additional Overture Result to the Featured Top Section with respect to [*] keywords or phrases upon which the parties mutually agree, which agreement will not unreasonably withheld, for the period during which [*]. (c) No Incentives to Click. Yahoo will not provide users with any incentives (e.g., points or special offers) to click on Overture Results. 4.4 Preemption by Yahoo. In response to Yahoo Search Queries, Yahoo will be entitled to display either (a) one Yahoo Result on the first Yahoo Search Results Pages, unless Overture delivers the same Overture Results for any Yahoo Search Query according to Section 3.2 (in which case Yahoo will be entitled to display the same Yahoo Result on subsequent Yahoo Search Results Pages), in the Top Link Position; or (b) one Exclusive Result (as defined below) in the \"Yahoo! Exclusives\" (or similarly named) section of the Yahoo Search Results Pages according to Section 5.1(b) below. If Yahoo elects to display a Yahoo Result in the Top Link Section in response to a particular Yahoo Search Query, then the Required Number of Overture Results in the Featured Top Section for the particular Yahoo Search Query will be reduced to two. 4.5 Removal by Yahoo; Potential Liability; Excluded Terms; Contextual Relevance. Yahoo will be entitled to block the display of any Overture Result for which Overture has an obligation to suppress delivery pursuant to Section 4.2 and this Section 4.5. (a) Overture Results that Yahoo deems Objectionable. As it consistently administers its company-wide advertising policies-(e.g., [*]), Yahoo will be entitled to block Overture Results that do not comply with such policies from the Yahoo Search Results Pages or to amend the list of Excluded Terms to include any keywords or phrases to which those Overture Results relate, as reasonably determined by Yahoo. Yahoo also will be entitled to block or to request removal of any Overture Results that [*]. Yahoo also will be entitled to block or to request removal of any Overture Results that, in Yahoo's reasonable belief, might [*] or might [*]. In any event, Yahoo agrees to notify Overture and to provide Overture with an electronic copy of the Overture Results that give rise to Yahoo's request. (b) Overture Results that Yahoo deems Contextually Irrelevant. As it consistently administers its Yahoo Search-wide editorial policies, Yahoo will be entitled to block or to request removal of any Overture Results that are not contextually relevant to the Yahoo Search Query. The * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 17 <PAGE> EXECUTION CONFIDENTIAL parties will discuss relevancy issues in good faith, including but not limited to the means for resolving relevancy issues (e.g., revision of title and description, filter or removal). Any disagreement between Overture and Yahoo concerning whether an Overture Result is contextually relevant under this Section 4.5(b) shall give rise to an Escalation Event. 4.6 Yahoo Suppression. Yahoo will suppress delivery of certain Yahoo Results in accordance with the following: (a) Results that Overture deems Potentially Damaging. Overture will be entitled to request that Yahoo not display any Yahoo Results that, in Overture's reasonable belief, might subject Overture to criminal or civil liability. (b) Contextual Relevance. As it consistently administers its editorial policies, Overture will be entitled to request that Yahoo not display any Yahoo Results that are not contextually relevant to the Yahoo Search Query. The parties will discuss relevancy issues in good faith, including but not limited to the means for resolving relevancy issues (e.g., revision of title and description, filter or removal). Any disagreement concerning this Section 4.6(b) shall give rise to an Escalation Event. 5. Yahoo Search Results Pages; Featured Sections. 5.1 Creation and Maintenance of Yahoo Search Results Pages. Yahoo will create and maintain the Yahoo Search Results Pages during the Term and, except as set forth in Section 5.4, display a Yahoo Search Results Page in response to the submission of every Yahoo Search Query. (a) Editorial Control. Yahoo will be solely responsible for the design, layout, \"look and feel,\" posting and maintenance of the Yahoo Network, including but not limited to the Yahoo Search Results Pages and any sections thereof. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, except Section 4.3(a) and the introductory paragraph thereto which contain the minimum display requirements, Yahoo will be entitled to redesign or modify [*], of the Yahoo Network, including but not limited to the Yahoo Search Results Pages and any sections thereof. Yahoo will undertake commercially reasonable efforts to provide Overture with a reasonable amount of notice prior to implementing any Redesign of the Yahoo Search Results Pages. (b) Pre-Approved Change to Yahoo Search Results Pages. With respect to Yahoo Search Results Pages on which Yahoo does not display a Yahoo Result, Overture hereby approves Yahoo's creation and display of a \"Yahoo! Exclusives\" (or similarly named) section on the Yahoo Search Results Pages, which section will include no more than one search result (an \"Exclusive Result\") and might appear above the Featured Top Section. (c) Acknowledgement of Redesign. The parties acknowledge and agree that Yahoo might implement more than one \"look and feel\" for the Yahoo Search Results Pages, which \"look and feel\" could vary based on the nature of the Yahoo Search Query, as determined by Yahoo. (d) \"Sponsor Matches\" Link. Both parties acknowledge and agree that, with respect to the page to which users navigate directly from the \"What are Sponsor Matches?\" link (as shown on the mock-up) or other similar link on the Yahoo Search Results Page (the \"Help Page\"), the Help Page that has been used prior to the Effective Date shall be the Help Page that is used after the Effective Date, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the parties. 5.2 Creation and Maintenance of Featured Sections. Yahoo will create and maintain the Featured Sections on the Yahoo Search Results Pages throughout the Term in accordance with the terms of * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

Yahoo will undertake commercially reasonable efforts not to sell advertising units (including but not limited to pop-up windows) that block any portion of a user's view of the Overture Results [*]. 5.4 Jump Page displayed in response to Hybrid Search Queries. With respect to [*] Yahoo Search Queries for which \"filtered\" Overture Results are available (the \"Hybrid Search Queries\"), Yahoo will be entitled to present a jump page (the \"Jump Page\") to each and every U.S. User in response to that U.S. User submitting a Hybrid Search Query, which Jump Page will (a) inform the U.S. User that the Hybrid Search Query is likely to return [*] search results; (b) enable the U.S. User to navigate directly to a contextually relevant Yahoo Search Results Page and, to the extent that the U.S. User selects this option, Yahoo will send the Hybrid Search Query to Overture in accordance with Section 3.2 above; (c) enable the U.S. User to submit a new Yahoo Search Query; and, in some cases, (d) enable the U.S. User to navigate directly to a page within a third party web site on which contextually relevant [*] search results are displayed, thereby terminating the Hybrid Search Query. Any other treatment of Hybrid Queries will be subject to mutual agreement of the parties. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Jump Page does not constitute a Yahoo Search Results Page, and that Yahoo's treatment of Hybrid Search Queries in this manner does not constitute a breach of this Agreement. The parties further acknowledge and agree that the delivery of [*] Overture Results to Yahoo is not contemplated by this Agreement and, thus, Yahoo [*]. 6. Technical Implementation; Interaction between the Parties. 6.1 Compliance with Service Level Agreement. Each party will comply with the terms and conditions of the Service Level Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A. 6.2 Technical Resources; Quarterly Meetings. During the Term, each party will contribute those technical resources reasonably necessary to facilitate the exchange of Yahoo Search Queries and Overture Results and the improvement of the tracking and reporting outlined in Section 8.4 below. The search product development teams of the parties will meet no less than once per Quarter to exchange information regarding relevance of Overture Results and Yahoo Results and developing trends in the search product market. 6.3 No Disparaging Comments. Yahoo will not post any disparaging comments attributable to Yahoo about Overture or the Overture Results on Yahoo Search and the accompanying directory property during the Term (e.g., [*]), and Overture will not post any disparaging comments attributable to Overture about Yahoo or Yahoo Search on the Overture Site during the Term. In addition, during the Term, Yahoo agrees (a) not to use Overture's Confidential Information, the Overture Results or the Overture Reports for the purpose of selling Overture advertisers placement in any Yahoo search sponsor matches program; (b) not to target Overture advertisers by parsing the Overture XML feed for Overture advertiser contact information or by obtaining such information from another source provided by Overture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall this Agreement be deemed to restrict Yahoo in any manner from: (1) marketing any Yahoo product or service (including but not limited to any Yahoo sponsor matches program) to any existing Yahoo advertiser, content provider, or Yahoo registered user; (2) marketing any Yahoo product or service to any potential Yahoo * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

Overture acknowledges and agrees that (1) Yahoo may not have control over [*]; and (2) Yahoo uses and will continue to use the fact that a web site within its directory is [*] for display in the Main Body Search Results. (b) Clarifications; U.S. Users. For clarity, the exclusivity set forth in this Section 7 extends to U.S. Users on Yahoo Search only, unless the parties mutually agree in an executed amendment to this Agreement to broaden the exclusivity to include New Domestic Opportunities or International Opportunities as set forth in Section 7.3 and 7.4 below. (c) Acknowledgements; European Users on Yahoo Search. Overture acknowledges and agrees that Yahoo has entered into agreements with (a) LookSmart International Pty Limited (\"LookSmart Australia\") under which, among other things, LookSmart Australia provides and Yahoo displays Restricted Search Results in response to search queries submitted to Yahoo Search from Internet Protocol addresses within Australia or New Zealand, as measured by Yahoo; and (b) eSpotting Media (UK) Limited (\"eSpotting UK\") under which, among other things, eSpotting UK might provide and Yahoo might display Restricted Search Results in response to search queries submitted to Yahoo Search from Internet Protocol addresses within Europe, as measured by Yahoo. Overture agrees that nothing in this Agreement will be construed to prohibit, restrict, or otherwise prevent Yahoo from continuing to participate in and pursue the foregoing relationships, as long as these pursuits do not violate this Agreement. Nothing in this provision or Agreement shall be construed to constitute an admission by Overture that any third party system does not infringe any Overture intellectual property right. Further, nothing in this provision or Agreement shall preclude Overture from asserting a claim for infringement against any third party for infringement of Overture's intellectual property or seeking an injunction against providing infringing search results to others, including Yahoo. 7.3 Additional Domestic Opportunities. If, during the Term, Yahoo elects to create a new opportunity for a [*] for display on the Yahoo Network but outside Yahoo Search and Yahoo Directory (the \"New Domestic Opportunity\"), then Yahoo will provide Overture with written notice that sets forth Yahoo's business requirements for the New Domestic Opportunity.

If the parties reasonably believe that a Revenue Share Payment will be less than the Guaranteed Fixed Payment in a particular Quarter, then Overture shall pay to Yahoo a [*] reasonable estimate of the next Guaranteed Fixed Payment due (which reasonable estimate shall not bind either party to such number) and, once the parties determine the correct Guaranteed Fixed Payment for that Quarter according to Section 8.7 below, the party that owes money to the other shall pay the same. If Yahoo owes money to Overture, then Overture shall be entitled to reduce its next payment(s) by the amount that is owed until the entire amount has been repaid. <TABLE> <CAPTION> ------------------------------------------------------------ Quarter Guaranteed Fixed Payment ------------------------------------------------------------ <S> <C> Q1 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q2 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q3 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q4 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q5 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q6 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q7 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q8 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q9 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q10 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q11 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ Q12 $[*] ------------------------------------------------------------ </TABLE> * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

[*]. Percentages of Gross Revenue apply solely to Gross Revenue within each of the ranges listed below (i.e., [*]). Revenue Share Payments are due and payable to Yahoo within [*] days after the end of the applicable Quarter.

If the Advance Payment is greater than the amount owed by Overture to Yahoo hereunder, then the difference between the amount of the Advance Payment and the amount owed by Overture to Yahoo hereunder shall be refunded to Overture within [*] days after the effective date of termination. (b) Renewal Fee. If Yahoo irrevocably exercises its First Option (as defined below) according to Section 10 below and so notifies Overture in writing no later than April 30, 2004, then Overture shall pay to Yahoo a renewal fee in the amount of $2,000,000 within 60 days after Yahoo's notice. * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.

The Impression information shall be reflected in the on-line reporting database within 48 hours. In addition, with respect to the Yahoo Results and Exclusive Results, Yahoo will provide Overture with a Yahoo Search Query Report that sets forth in reasonable detail monthly Impressions for the Yahoo Results and Exclusive Results in the aggregate and the aggregate information and data that falls within the same categories as those listed in Exhibit F for which Overture must provide information and data about the Overture Results (e.g., total clicks, average cost per click and average click-through rate). All reports provided hereunder will be accompanied by a certificate of accuracy, signed by Yahoo's Chief Technology Officer or similar officer with responsibility for the reporting function. (d) `Bot Traffic.

Any failure to complete such negotiations will trigger an Escalation Event pursuant to Section 16.5(a) below. (f) Testing. Yahoo agrees to (i) identify search queries submitted by Yahoo in connection with any test conducted by Yahoo in accordance with the Service Level Agreement as \"test\" queries by marking them as such in a data field at the time of submission; and (ii) include a total of these \"test\" queries in the Yahoo Search Query Reports. 8.5 Mutual Audit Rights. Each party (the \"Auditing Party\"), at its own expense, will be entitled to retain a reputable, independent certified public accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the other party (the \"Audited Party\") solely for the purpose of auditing, at a mutually agreed upon time during normal business hours, those records of the Audited Party that relate to the calculation of `bot traffic, Click-Through Rate, Price Per Click, Impressions, Yahoo Results, U.S. Users, Gross Revenue or the Revenue Share Payments. Prior to an audit, the Auditing Party will require the certified public accounting firm (the \"Auditor\") to sign a confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to the Audited Party, and the results of the audit will be deemed \"Confidential Information\". Such audit shall be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and the Auditor will be entitled to disclose to the Auditing Party only whether or not the Audited Party is in compliance and the amount of any non-compliance, if any, and will be precluded from disclosing any other Confidential Information to the Auditing Party without written consent of the Audited Party. If an audit reveals an underpayment, then the Audited Party will immediately make payment to the Auditing Party in the amount of the underpayment [*]. If an audit reveals an underpayment or miscalculation of more than 10%, then the Audited Party will pay the reasonable cost of that audit. Either party shall only be entitled to [*] during the Term, which will apply to the prior [*] under the Agreement.

These ways include (but are not limited to) [*] and [*] may impact CTR through [*]. (b) Estimated Yahoo Payment. Once a Measurement Period is triggered, the Estimated Yahoo Payment and Guaranteed Fixed Payment Adjustment Process set forth in Exhibit K will be followed. If an adjustment in the Estimated Yahoo Payment is required, then the following formula will be used to determine that adjustment: [*] (c) Credit for Guaranteed Fixed Payment. If the Revenue Share Payment is less than the Guaranteed Fixed Payment in Quarter X, then Overture will be credited toward the Guaranteed Fixed Payment in Quarter Y an amount (the \"Credit\") = [*]: (1) [*], or (2) [*]. * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission. Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions. 26 <PAGE> EXECUTION CONFIDENTIAL If the above calculation occurs during the final Quarter of the Agreement (inclusive of any Extension Terms), then the Term of the Agreement will be extended until the actual Revenue Share Payment is equal to the Credit. For clarity, [*]. If the parties mutually agree not to extend the Term as set forth herein, then Yahoo will pay the amount of the Credit to Overture within [*] days after the expiration of the Agreement. (d) Measurement Period. A Measurement Period is triggered when the [*]. At the time a Measure Period is triggered, the Parties shall determine a fair reserve from the Guaranteed Fixed Payment as described in Section 8.1 above. By way of example, [*]. (e) Adjustment. If, in a Quarter subsequent to a Measurement Period, the Yahoo Revenue Share exceeds the Estimated Yahoo payment for that Quarter (as adjusted, if applicable), then Overture will reset the Estimated Yahoo Payment and the Guaranteed Fixed Payment for the subsequent Quarter to the level calculated using the formula in Section 8.7(b) above, subject to the following exceptions: (1) To the extent that the Guaranteed Fixed Payment is adjusted upwards [*]. (2) The Guaranteed Fixed Payment will not be adjusted upwards unless the actual revenue share to Yahoo is greater than or equal to [*]% of Estimated Yahoo Payment for a given Quarter. 8.8 Late Payments.

Yahoo will deliver the Guaranteed Impressions for each Quarter, except that Yahoo will be deemed to have delivered the Guaranteed Impressions for any Quarter in which [*] for that Quarter. Additionally, if [*], then Yahoo will be deemed to have delivered the Guaranteed Impressions for that Quarter, regardless of the number of Impressions actually delivered. For clarity, Yahoo will continue to deliver Impressions hereunder, by virtue of delivering each and every Yahoo Search Query to Overture according to Section 3.2 above, even if Yahoo has delivered the Guaranteed Impressions for a particular Quarter. For additional clarity, the fact that the Guaranteed Impressions are deemed delivered hereunder will not preclude the parties from considering Impressions in connection with an adjustment under Section 8.7 above. 9.2 Remedy, Make-Good. If Yahoo does not deliver the Guaranteed Impressions within the applicable Quarter, then it will \"make good\" the shortfall by extending its obligations hereunder at the end of the Initial Term or the end of the applicable Extension Term, if any, until it delivers the Guaranteed Impressions. 10. Yahoo's Option to Extend. Yahoo shall have two options to extend the Term, each of which shall extend the Term by an additional two or three years, as determined by Yahoo. The first option to extend (\"First Option\"), if exercised by Yahoo, shall extend the Term for a period commencing on May 1, 2005 and continuing until either April 30, 2007 or April 30, 2008 (an \"Extension Term\"), depending on whether Yahoo chooses the two year option or three year option. In order for Yahoo to exercise the First Option, Yahoo must notify Overture in writing prior to [*] of its desire to exercise such option. The second option to extend (\"Second Option\"), if exercised by Yahoo, shall extend the Term for a period commencing on the date on which the first Extension Term expires (i.e., either April 30, 2007 or April 30, 2008) and continuing for a period of either two or three years from * Certain information on this page has been omitted and filed separately with the Commission.
