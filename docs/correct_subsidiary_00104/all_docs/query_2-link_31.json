        "text": "Yahoo, the big Internet portal, announced yesterday that it would buy Overture Services, an Internet search listings service, for $1.63 billion in cash and stock.\n\nOverture, which makes money by selling top spots on search listings to advertisers and then distributing those so-called sponsored results on MSN, Yahoo and other popular sites, has been rumored to be a candidate for a takeover for months.\n\nThe acquisition would give Yahoo greater ability to compete with Google in providing comprehensive Internet search services. Yahoo already owns the Internet search service Inktomi, and Overture recently acquired two other search engines, AltaVista and Fast Search and Transfer. The purchase of Overture gives Yahoo a bigger stake in the arena of advertiser-paid search listings.\n\nThe leading candidates for acquiring Overture were Yahoo and MSN, both of which are paid hundreds of millions of dollars annually by Overture to distribute its paid listings. In the first quarter, nearly a fifth of Yahoo's $282 million in revenues came from Overture listings.\n\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, which is expected to close late this year, Overture shareholders would receive 0.61 share of Yahoo common stock and $4.75 in cash for each Overture share. Overture shares closed at $24.05 yesterday, up $2.54; Yahoo rose a penny, to $32.21.\n\nYahoo's chief executive, Terry Semel, said the deal would help the company in several ways. He said it would eliminate the question of whether Yahoo should build its own service to compete with Overture's and that of Google, which has also developed a successful paid search service. Also, Mr. Semel said Yahoo would incorporate Overture's paid-search method in its various channels, thereby giving small and midsize advertisers Overture's chief clients the chance to compete against national advertisers.\n\nThe acquisition would give Yahoo a foothold in an advertising category that is growing briskly, especially outside the United States, where paid search listings are only now gaining broad acceptance. According to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, revenue from paid search listings will grow from about $2 billion this year to about $5 billion by 2006. \"So the growth is now,\" Mr. Semel said.\n\nYahoo's acquisition of Overture would provide guaranteed distribution of its ads and a measure of financial stability. Overture shares have, particularly in recent years, dipped and surged whenever it has aligned with or separated from a major portal because those portal agreements are critical to advertising distribution. \"Every time there's a rumor, their stock is depressed,\" said Danny Sullivan, the editor of SearchEngineWatch.com, an industry Web site. \"Now they can get away from that.\"\n\nTed Meisel, Overture's chief executive, agreed. Mr. Meisel, who would remain in charge of Overture's operations after the acquisition, said: \"By clearly removing some of the uncertainty associated with the audience traffic, we're now able to focus that much more on product development. By doing that, we'll be years ahead of where we would be if we were doing it alone.\"\n\nAnalysts said that MSN, a unit of Microsoft, would be the loser in the deal because it would be getting its advertiser-sponsored search results from Yahoo, a chief competitor. Yahoo would be able to sift through searches done on MSN to glean aspects of MSN's business. \"They're in a pretty difficult situation right now,\" Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said of MSN. \"This should've been their acquisition.\"\n\nLisa Gurry, group product manager at MSN, said MSN would first discuss the deal with Yahoo and Overture and \"then we'll evaluate our options. But in the short term, there is no impact.\" Mr. Rashtchy said MSN would be likely to have no choice but to stay with Overture for at least a year, as it finds a new search company to sell search spots to advertisers or builds its own version of that service. Forming a partnership with Google is not an option for MSN, analysts said, because Google is potentially a bigger threat for market share than Yahoo.\n\nThe acquisition comes at a time of improving financial results for Yahoo. The company has successfully diversified its revenue sources the last two years with fee-based services like personal ads and e-mail accounts. Such sales reached $70 million last quarter, a 43 percent increase from the comparable quarter a year earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, ad revenue is rebounding from a prolonged industrywide slump. Apart from its dealings with Overture, Yahoo's ad sales last quarter jumped 44 percent versus the 2002 period, to $219 million. Analysts agreed with Mr. Semel's contention that the Overture acquisition would further strengthen Yahoo's advertising business.\n\nMr. Rashtchy of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray noted that Overture had attracted more than 88,000 advertisers, and those merchants were different from Yahoo's existing clients. \"What else can Yahoo sell to them? Probably a great deal of things,\" he said.\n\nWhile those clients may be lured to advertise on Yahoo's Yellow Pages listings, Yahoo's bigger advertisers are likely to use the paid search listings to develop new marketing techniques. For instance, analysts said, Yahoo's topic pages, like its travel page, could more thoroughly incorporate search features that include Overture's paid listings."
