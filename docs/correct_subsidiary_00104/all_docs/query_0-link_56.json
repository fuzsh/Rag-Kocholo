        "text": "by Usama Fayyad, Open Insights\n\nOne of my emotional moments at KDD-2019 in Anchorage, Alaska was a mini-reunion with Ricardo Baeza-Yates. We ran into each other at the exhibits where, and as a surprise to both of us, we found a booth for Yahoo! Research. As many may already know, Yahoo! was sold to Verizon two years ago, and we both thought that Yahoo! Research would be re-branded. But the folks in the booth, led by Kim Capps-Tanaka who welcomed us warmly as \"founders of Yahoo! Research\" and took our pictures after lavishing us with some cool memorabilia. Kim told us that Verizon felt that the brand of Yahoo! Research Labs was so strong that Verizon decided to maintain that branding and continues to grow the team!\n\nPhoto on left: Ricardo Baeza-Yates was founder of Yahoo! Research Chile and Barcelona Labs, with Usama Fayyad founder of Yahoo! Research.\n\nYahoo! Research brings back many memories. From the moment of its founding in late 2005 - when I pitched the Yahoo! executive team on the idea of creating a new lab that would address the \"new sciences underlying the Internet\" - to its phenomenal growth and achievements, it was a source of personal learning, joy, and pride.\n\nAt the time, no one was really doing serious research in areas relating to the new emerging issues that are unique to on-line life. The only area that had gotten research interest was Internet Search - and at the time the leading Search companies, led by Google, were not open to publishing new research. Universities did related research to Search but under \"established areas\" like Information Retrieval and High Performance Computing. IBM was supporting research in the area but focused more on enterprise search and document managing - they had a good critical mass of researchers in Almaden Research Center and at TJ Watson, but they did not have a product in web search.\n\nYahoo! had acquired Overture, Inktomi, and many related companies. The Yahoo! executive team, especially Zod Nazem and Jerry Yang believed strongly that we should do something differentiated and something that would attract the best engineering/research minds to Yahoo! So I was tasked with what we called at the time \"the Tech Branding of Yahoo!\" and I was also asked to decide what we should do in terms of creating an advanced research arm. I took on the task of looking at extending the small team of Overture Research Labs (which was formed by Ted Meisel at the time as a means to address some of the many deep problems in Search Advertising). Indeed, that was pretty visionary of Ted Meisel at the time, since he formed this lab before Overture was acquired by Yahoo!\n\nI agreed to give this project 2 weeks of consideration and then drive for a quick decision by Yahoo! on what to do. My main theme was to create a group that would address many of the problems that did not fit in the academic departments of big research universities. During those two weeks, I took a trip to Redmond to visit Rick Rashid, who founded and ran Microsoft Research (MSR). Rick and Dan Ling had recruited me to MSR back in 1995 at the behest of David Heckerman, Jack Breese, and Eric Horvitz who had founded the Decision Theory Group at MSR. Rick graciously agreed to meet and was generous in brainstorming with me. At the time, he recognized the importance of these new areas, but said that MSR's vision is to create a big research lab (when I joined we were 70 researchers, and by the time I came to visit Rick, MSR had grown to over 600 researchers) covering all areas of computer science.\n\nWhen I went back to report to the Yahoo! executive team, the idea was to create a small-by-design lab (only growing to about 50-100 researchers) but be very focused on \"Inventing the New Sciences of Internet\". The executives were very enthusiastic, and Zod Nazem, Jerry Yang, Dan Rosensweig, David Filo, and Ted Meisel were extremely supportive of this vision and of forming this Yahoo! Research Lab. I remember the tension in the room when we turned to then CEO Terry Semel and asked for a decision. Terry, in his business style asked two questions:\n\nwhat kind of budget commitment would I need?\n\nhow long would we need before we hit critical mass and what kind of impact do we expect on the Yahoo! business?\n\nI will discuss the answers to these questions in another post. But then Terry turned to the executive team and asked for their opinions/votes. And then he addressed me, and in one of the most memorable moments of my life he said: \"Let's do it!\" I remember Zod's big smile, Dan's high five, and Jerry saying \"don't mess it up!\". With that, we decided to boldly create a research lab whose remit was to bring together the best brains in the world that would be able to \"invent the new sciences of the Internet\" - At the time these were:\n\nSearch and Information Navigation\n\nThe new Micro-Economics of the Web\n\nOnline Trust and Social Network Dynamics\n\nComputational Advertising (this name came after we hired Prabhakar Raghavan and Andrei Broder - I credit the name to Andrei).\n\nMy first job was to hire the head of this new lab. That was Prabhakar Raghavan. Our next move was to look to expanding outside the U.S. and that's when we sought Ricardo Baeza-Yates who had published his book \"Modern Information Retrieval\" -- which was then considered the most important reference in this area of research. Ricardo, Prabhakar and I then worked on opening our remote lab in Santiago de Chile, and later an even bigger presence in Barcelona. Ricardo ran both organizations for many years and helped attract top researchers in South America and Europe to these labs.\n\nThe rest of the story was nothing but amazing. Because we were committed to publishing our research openly and to use Yahoo! as one of the largest \"observational instruments on the Internet\" - especially with our investment in building the Strategic Data Systems group at Yahoo! earlier - we ended up attracting the top researchers in the world to the newly formed Yahoo! Research labs. The combination of smart brains, open publication policy, and our insistence on creating a true experimental and applied set of new sciences, we ended up building that team in record time. Within 18 months we had over 50 of the top researchers in these areas. The direct contributions of these researchers to the Yahoo! business were significant.\n\nPersonally I learned so much from these people. Especially the Economists who were doing amazing work led by Preston McCaffee (from Caltech) and Michael Schwarz (from Harvard) as these areas, along with the new Web Sociologists led by Duncan Watts, were entirely new to me. I was particularly pleased with how well integrated our research teams were with the Yahoo! product teams. Perhaps the best metric of this integration was that within 2 years of the founding of Yahoo! Research Labs (i.e. by late 2007) the Chief Scientists for each of the major product groups at Yahoo! were all from Y!R:\n\nRaghu Ramakrishnan became Chief Scientist of Content Group led by Jeff Weiner\n\nAndrei Broder became Chief Scientist of Search Advertising\n\nPreston McCaffee became the Chief Economist of Yahoo!\n\nAndrew Tomkins became Chief Scientist of Yahoo! Search\n\nThis was Yahoo! at its best. Thanks for all the memories. Thanks for all the people who made Yahoo! Research Labs a great institution. Thanks for all the Yahoo!s who worked hard on making it a great success in its time..."
