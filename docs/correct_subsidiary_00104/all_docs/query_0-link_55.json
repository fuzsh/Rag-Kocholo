This acquisition was a significant milestone for Yahoo, as it enabled the company to expand its advertising offerings and provide advertisers with a more comprehensive suite of advertising solutions.\n\nWith the acquisition of Overture Services, Yahoo gained access to advanced technology and expertise in search advertising. This allowed the company to develop more sophisticated advertising products and services, such as advanced targeting and bidding options.\n\nThe Rise of Yahoo Gemini\n\nIn 2014, Yahoo introduced Yahoo Gemini, a new advertising platform that combined search and native advertising.
