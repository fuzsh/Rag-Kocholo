        "text": "By Douglas MacMillan and Dana Mattioli\n\nYahoo Inc. has kicked off an auction for a portfolio of about 3,000 patents expected to fetch more than $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn recent weeks, the internet company sent letters to a range of potential buyers for the patents, which date back to Yahoo’s initial public offering in 1996 and include its original search technology, one of the people said.\n\nYahoo has set a mid-June deadline for preliminary bids, this person said, and hired Black Stone IP, a boutique investment bank that specializes in patent sales, to run the auction.\n\nA Yahoo spokeswoman confirmed the company is exploring the sale of about 3,000 patents and pending applications. “This represents a unique opportunity for companies operating in the internet industry to acquire some of the most pioneering and foundational patents related to web search and advertising,” she said in a statement.\n\nYahoo is launching the patent sale in the midst of a high-profile auction for its core web business. Verizon Communications Inc., seen as the leading contender, bid about $3 billion for the internet properties before the Monday deadline for second-round bids, a person familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThat figure may be lower than initial estimates on the value of Yahoo’s core business — which analysts said could fetch from $4 billion to $8 billion — in part because Verizon isn’t bidding on the bulk of Yahoo’s most valuable patents.\n\nIn April, Yahoo assigned 2,659 patents to a separate subsidiary called Excaliber IP LLC, according to a filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. That action, seen as a step toward a patent sale, occurred on the same day as the deadline for first-round bids in the auction for Yahoo’s core business.\n\nThe trove of Excaliber patents cover key areas such as search, e-commerce and online advertising, including a patent related to ad-matching technology that was at the center of a legal dispute between Yahoo and Alphabet’s Google. That technology, which matched online ads to Web-search results, was developed by Overture, an online ad company that sued Google in 2002 for patent infringement before being acquired by Yahoo a year later. Yahoo and Google settled in 2004, with Google giving Yahoo stock worth more than $300 million in exchange for a perpetual license to Yahoo’s ad-matching technology.\n\nA Yahoo spokeswoman said the company is offering a smaller group of patents — 500 U.S. patents and over 600 U.S. pending applications — as part of the auction of its core web business. Those patents are seen as necessary to the underlying technology of Yahoo’s web properties, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe company has invited strategic buyers, private-equity firms, and investment firms focused on intellectual property to submit bids, the person said. It is unclear how many parties are interested."
