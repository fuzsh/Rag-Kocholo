        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP -- The popular\n\nonline search engines run by Google Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. are banning ads from\n\nonline casinos, reacting to a federal crackdown on Internet gambling.\n\nMountain View-based Google expects\n\nto drop all casino ads by the end of this month. Sunnyvale-based Yahoo! is simultaneously\n\nphasing out the casino ads in its U.S. market but allowing them to continue\n\nto appear in 14 countries where the company operates Web sites.\n\nYahoo!'s decision also affects Microsoft\n\nCorp.'s MSN site, whose search engine depends on a Yahoo! subsidiary, Overture\n\nServices, for its online casino ads.\n\nBoth Google and Yahoo! are imposing\n\nthe ban as federal authorities increase the pressure on the media to stop \"aiding\n\nand abetting\" offshore Internet casinos that have been illegally accepting bets\n\nin the United States.\n\nThe push recently prompted broadcast\n\ngiants Clear Channel Communications and Infinity Broadcasting to stop broadcasting\n\nthe ads of illegal online casinos.\n\nOverture spokeswoman Jennifer Stephens\n\nattributed the casino ban to a \"lack of clarity in the current environment\"\n\nand a desire to conform with its parent company's policies. Yahoo! stopped accepting\n\nbanner ads from online casinos in 2002.\n\nGoogle believes its action will\n\nhelp \"provide the best search and advertising experience for its users.\"\n\nCritics of the advertising ban against\n\nonline casinos say it compromises the media's right to distribute information.\n\nThis isn't the first time Overture\n\nand Google has shunned illegal businesses that previously were allowed to buy\n\nads. Both companies late last year announced an ad ban against unlicensed pharmacies.\n\nGoogle is still trying to develop a system to distinguish between the legal\n\nand illegal pharmacies that operate on the Internet."
