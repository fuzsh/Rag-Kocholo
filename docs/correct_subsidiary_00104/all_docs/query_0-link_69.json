Search recently won two awards from Search Engine Watch for outstanding search service and best image search.\n\nRob Jonas, head of business development at Yahoo! Search, UK & Ireland, said: \"This agreement demonstrates the growing strength of out search technology, as well as our commitment to work with partners to deliver compelling search user experiences.\n\n\"This should be the first of what we hope will be many agreements with popular online properties.\"\n\nThe integrated approach will be set up with the look and feel of each ITV section and searches will be tailored to its user profile and habits to ensure relevancy.\n\nYahoo! will also include all of ITV.com's online content through its content acquisition programme to ensure that Yahoo! UK & Ireland users will benefit by being able to find information about their favourite television programmes.\n\nYahoo has just announced that its profits are up to $755m (Â£430m), however shares slid 10% as analysts voiced disappointment with second-quarter results."
