Ted Meisel, president and chief executive offer of Overture, will continue to head up its operations and report to Dan Rosensweig, Yahoo!'s chief operating officer.\n\nYahoo! revealed its second-quarter results last week, saying that sponsored searches were a major area of growth at the company, contributing to its 42% increase in revenues to $321.4m (Â£197.6m) for the quarter.\n\nThe deal with Overture will see each common share of the company receive 0.6108 shares in Yahoo! as well as $4.75 in cash, valuing the company at $1.63bn.
