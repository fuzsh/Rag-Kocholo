        "text": "Yahoo Inc. this week plans to unveil a program designed to improve the size of its Web index and the relevancy of its search engine results, the Sunnyvale, Calif., company said Tuesday.\n\nThe Content Acquisition Program (CAP) will allow for both free and paid inclusion of Web sites in the Yahoo index, the company said.\n\nCAP’s paid inclusion portion is called Site Match and will be powered by the Yahoo subsidiary Overture. For a fee, Yahoo will ensure that a Web site is included in its index.\n\nCAP is currently available in the U.S. and will be provided abroad later this year, a Yahoo spokeswoman said.\n\nSite Match has no effect on where a participating Web site ranks in search query results. However, Yahoo won’t distinguish in query results whether a listed Web site was included in its index for a fee or as part of Yahoo’s free Web-crawling activities, a spokeswoman for Yahoo said.\n\nSome feel that search engines should make this type of disclosure, while others say it’s a trivial matter for users.\n\n“We’re on the side of it not being much of an issue. We’ve surveyed consumers on this topic, and overall, just 20% of online adults express any concern about mistaking paid listings for natural search results,” said David Schatsky, a Jupiter Research analyst. “This new program should definitely provide a nice revenue stream to Yahoo. I don’t expect any consumer backlash from it.”\n\nYahoo does separate from its main query results what are known as sponsored search results, and it clearly labels them as such. Sponsored search results are a sort of online classified ad that companies pay search engines to display along with relevant searches. “That’s a good practice to do that type of full disclosure, because placement in sponsored listings is clearly promotional in nature,” Schatsky said.\n\nUltimately, what search engine users want are relevant results, and they don’t care very much whether those are in the main query results list or in the sponsored links section, Schatsky said. “The name of the game for Yahoo in search is ease of use and relevancy. If they provide those two elements, they will be successful with consumers,” he said.\n\nSite Match subscribers who submit fewer than 1,000 URLs pay the following annual submission fees: $49 for the first URL, $29 for each of the next nine links and $10 each for URLs 11 through 999, the spokeswoman said. On top of that, subscribers pay a fixed cost-per-click of 15 or 30 cents every time a user clicks on one of the subscribers’ listings. Businesses that submit 1,000 URLs or more participate in the Match Xchange program at no annual fee and at a fixed cost-per-click of up to $1, depending on content category, the spokeswoman said.\n\nParticipation in Site Match also guarantees companies that their Web site’s information in the Yahoo index will be updated every 48 hours, said Diana Lee, another Yahoo spokeswoman. Web sites in Yahoo’s regular index that don’t participate in Site Match get their index information updated at different intervals, with some getting index updates on a daily basis, she said. Currently, about 99% of the Web sites in Yahoo’s index come from the company’s free Web crawling activities, and about 1% from the paid programs, Lee added.\n\nSite Match will group under one umbrella paid inclusion programs from companies that Yahoo has bought, including Inktomi Corp., AltaVista Co. and Fast, and clients of those programs will be migrated over to Site Match, Yahoo said in its Tuesday release."
