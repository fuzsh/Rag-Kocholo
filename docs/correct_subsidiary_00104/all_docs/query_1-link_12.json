        "text": "Overture is a paid listings search engine where Web sites bid against each other to be ranked well for specified keywords and phrases used in search queries. Site owners who pay for Overture listings do so on a cost-per-click model where they pay only when a user clicks on a site's link. Overture distributes those listings to a variety of partners including Yahoo!, MSN, Hotbot, Lycos, AltaVista, AlltheWeb and Ask Jeeves.\n\nOverture purchased AltaVista and AlltheWeb in 2003 and is currently in the process of being acquired by Yahoo!\n\nOverture has been working to combine development of AllTheWeb and AltaVista into Overture Search. Once Yahoo! completes its acquisition of Overture, it is not obvious where Overture Search (aka, AltaVista and AllTheWeb) will fit. Yahoo! is currently working on replacing Google with Inktomi its Web search engine. The purchase of Overture will give Yahoo! three of the major search engines -- Inktomi, AltaVista and AllTheWeb -- which may continue on as separate brands or may be folded into Yahoo! search. We expect there will be significant changes to AltaVista's and AllTheWeb's paid submission programs once Yahoo! completes its acquisition of Overture. In addition, the technology development efforts of the different search engines will likely be combined.\n\nWeb Search Page\n\nhttp://www.overture.com\n\nCompany Info\n\nhttp://www.content.overture.com/d/USm/about/\n\nRecent Press Releases\n\nhttp://www.content.overture.com/d/\n\nUSm/about/press/index.jhtml\n\nOwned By: Overture\n\nStock Symbol & Quote: over"
