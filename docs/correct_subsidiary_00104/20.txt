Yahoo! Inc and Overture Services Inc announced the completion of Yahoo!’s acquisition of Overture.

TERRY SEMEL Yahoo! will offer Overture’s large base of advertisers additional Yahoo! services

Overture is the leading provider of commercial search with more than 1,00,000 advertisers globally. Its assets also include an extensive affiliate distribution network that both Yahoo! and Overture are dedicated to maintaining and enhancing.

This merger furthers Yahoo!’s objective of becoming the leading end-to-end integrated search provider, combining assets capable of generating, distributing and monetising search results. The two companies expect to expand marketing opportunities on the Yahoo! network through the expansion of commercial search into vertical properties such as shopping, travel and yellow pages.

Additionally, Yahoo! will leverage on Overture’s scalable marketplace by offering Overture’s large base of advertisers additional Yahoo! services and by expanding their combined products internationally.
