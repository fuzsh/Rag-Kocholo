        "text": "The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) v. Lime Group LLC was a lawsuit filed by the Recording Industry Association of America against Lime Group LLC and its subsidiaries LimeWire LLC and Lime Wire LLC. The lawsuit was filed on August 4, 2006, and it was based on LimeWire's alleged contribution to copyright infringement by allowing its users to share music, movies, and other copyrighted content without obtaining the necessary licenses or permissions from the copyright owners.\n\nLimeWire was a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing software that allowed users to download and share files with other users on the LimeWire network. The RIAA alleged that LimeWire facilitated and encouraged the illegal sharing of copyrighted material, and that the company profited from this illegal activity by selling advertising space and charging users for its premium services.\n\nThe RIAA argued that LimeWire was responsible for the copyright infringement committed by its users, citing the Supreme Court's decision in the 2005 case MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. In that case, the Court ruled that P2P file-sharing companies could be held liable for copyright infringement if they actively encouraged their users to share copyrighted material illegally.\n\nThe RIAA sought damages of $150,000 per copyrighted work that was shared on LimeWire, which could have amounted to billions of dollars in damages if LimeWire was found liable for all of the copyright infringement committed by its users.\n\nThe case went to trial in 2010, and in May of that year, U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood ruled that LimeWire had indeed contributed to copyright infringement and was liable for the actions of its users. Judge Wood issued a permanent injunction against LimeWire, ordering the company to cease all operations and prohibiting it from continuing to distribute or support its software.\n\nIn addition to the injunction, LimeWire was ordered to pay $1.5 billion in damages to the record labels represented by the RIAA. However, LimeWire filed for bankruptcy in October 2010, and the final amount of damages awarded was significantly lower than the original $1.5 billion figure.\n\nThe LimeWire case was seen as a major victory for the RIAA and other copyright holders, as it established that P2P file-sharing companies could be held liable for the copyright infringement committed by their users. The case also served as a warning to other companies in the file-sharing industry, many of which shut down or changed their business models in the wake of the LimeWire ruling.\n\nIn conclusion, the RIAA v. Lime Group LLC case was a landmark lawsuit that established the legal principle that P2P file-sharing companies can be held liable for the copyright infringement committed by their users. The case resulted in a significant financial penalty for LimeWire and served as a warning to other companies in the file-sharing industry that they would be held accountable for any copyright infringement committed through their platforms."
