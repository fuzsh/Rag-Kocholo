        "text": "2. LimeWire is a free peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) client program that runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and other operating systems supported by the Java software platform.LimeWire uses the gnutella network as well as the BitTorrent protocol.

Types of music available\n\n5. Limewire’s target audience. The target audience for limewire is mainly teenagers. As the tend to download music.

These purposes include programs such as “cracked” versions of photoshop and other programs.\n\n6. Advantages/ Features of using the site.  Ease of use.

Disadvantages of using the site. Copyright Infringement The biggest drawback to P2P file sharing is the ability to break the law and commit copyright infringement. For owners of intellectual property, P2P file sharing sites are a nightmare. Legitimate P2P companies place a disclaimer on the software to inform people of copyright laws, reasons why the theft of intellectual property is wrong and why the website does not endorse or recommend engaging in illegal copyright infringement. That being said, the reality of it is many people still commit copyright infringement by exchanging movies, songs, games and other copyrighted properties. It is important to understand that P2P software and technology isn't what's illegal, but exchanging copyrighted files and property is against the law. The drawback is the software is the tool that enables this to occur and has become a large controversial issue.\n\n8. Malware Unfortunately some P2P software comes with a bundle of spyware and adware which takes residence in your computer. Additionally there is always a risk of downloading viruses or Trojans from other users. Not everyone who engages in P2P file sharing is honorable and some may use the interface for the purpose of spreading nasty bugs to the computers of others. Before using P2P it is of value to understand safe computer practices and some of the potential risks that occur when downloading. A good firewall and virus scanner that is kept up to date is a must.\n\n9. Advertisements To use P2P websites users are prompted to download the necessary software. One consideration is free vs. paid software. Free versions will not cost any money to download or install however they often come with flashing ads and other annoying advertisements. This may not be appealing to all users and some may prefer to pay a bit of money to download software that does not contain advertisements.\n\n10. Trust Strangers Most websites do not police the content that streams through P2P and have no central location to store files that have been checked for being illegal or virus-ridden. The weight falls on users to decide and for those who aren't versed in copyright law or risky computing this can be problematic. P2P is legitimate software and serves a good purpose when used properly, and as time goes on, the value of this technology proves itself in both the business and social environment. Many companies have recognized the value of P2P and have integrated it into their workplaces. That being said, unfortunately there is an entire culture that abuses the technology in order to exploit both the law and other people. This factor is the primarily cause for the biggest disadvantages of P2P file sharing."
