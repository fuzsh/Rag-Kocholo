        "text": "Resort architects leverage colorful plaster additives, such as SPECTRAQUARTZ®, to craft unforgettable and luxurious pool designs. The vibrant hues of our colored quartz additive transform ordinary pools into breathtaking aquatic masterpieces, enhancing the overall aesthetic and creating a unique visual experience that leaves a lasting impression on guests.\n\nUsing high quality filtering media in luxury resort pools is essential for pristine water quality and an exceptional swimming experience for discerning guests. AQUAQUARTZ® premium pool filter sand ensures easy maintenance by filtering dust, algae, debris, leaves, and insects.\n\nNo resort guest wants to be disturbed by maintenance activities while on vacation. Hospitality providers choose paints with our MINEX® functional mineral filler, which provide extended durability in outdoor environments to minimize maintenance work so vacationers can enjoy a serene and restful experience.\n\nMany swimming pool builders prefer ACCEL® dust-preventing paver sand as a long-term solution to their hardscape needs. ACCEL’s unique polymer formula offers rubber-like flexibility, preventing stress cracks while forming a strong yet flexible bond. This advanced chemistry minimizes future maintenance costs, and also offers dust-suppression technology, making it an ideal choice for many hospitality facilities."
