Introduction 1.1 Purpose of this publication Builders in rural areas have for many years constructed water supply systems, such as roof gutters and water tanks for catchment of rainwater, handdug wells, subsurface dams, weirs, sand dams, ponds and small earth dams. The clients have either been individuals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), government ministries, or donors such as Danida, Sida and UNDP. Many of these water projects function well and supply water, and, according to the water- users, do so without problems. However, some water projects do not function very well, while others are complete failures, and the reasons are a mixture of insufficient knowledge about surveying, design drawings, estimating bills of quantities, and costing accurately, as well as inadequate training of technicians and contractors, and improper operation and maintenance by the water users. This handbook, Water Supply by Rural Builders, is the 8th in a series of handbooks that gives guidelines on how to carry out simple, yet adequate, surveys, designs and construction of basic water projects. It is the popular belief that deep boreholes and large earth dams, built by heavy machinery, are the only two solutions to get water in arid and semi-arid lands (= the ASALs). The fact is, that a subsurface dam, built cheaply of soil in a riverbed and with a handdug well in the riverbank, can supply much more water and at a fraction of the cost compared to e.g. a deep borehole equipped with a submersible pump powered by a diesel generator. It is hoped that this handbook, and the whole series of 8 handbooks, will reduce the number of failed and under-performing water projects, and will reduce the significant amounts of money and man-hours wasted on costly, over-designed water projects, whose yields of water could be achieved by applying simple, low-cost, design and construction criteria, with lower operation and maintenance costs. Engineers do not learn the simple techniques required for low-cost water structures, such as they are described in these handbooks. It is therefore very timely that two university lecturers now produce textbooks, for use at universities and colleges, on community water projects. The world is running out of fresh water, partly due to over-exploitation of ground water resources by boreholes, and by contamination of the water in rivers and lakes. In the very near future, the only fresh water source may be the rains, at least where it is not acid due to pollution. Rainwater harvesting is a viable, sustainable and long-term solution, if applied properly, and it is hoped that this series of handbooks can also assist in promoting education on rainwater harvesting and self-reliance in water supply systems, while also improving the environment. 11\n\n12. 1.2 Rural water projects People living in the ASAL areas of the world must fetch water from the nearest water source, perhaps being 10 to 15 km away. Where water sources are further away than that, it may take several days to transport water by donkey or camel. Individuals and communities therefore find it very frustrating when they have worked hard and contributed cash to build a water project, and then find that it cannot supply sufficient water to cover the demand, or even worse, that it cannot supply any water at all. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation in Kenya reports that only 60% of drilled boreholes, costing an average of Ksh 850,000 each, are successful. Many hand dug wells are also sunk in wrong locations where water is brackish or non-existent. Sand dams, which raise the level of sand and water several metres in riverbeds, have a failure rate of around 90%. Earth dams are also problematic, as dam reservoirs get silted up and dam walls and spillways are washed away more often, probably due to global warming, and even some dams that have withstood heavy rainfall over the last 50 years have recently been washed away. This series of handbooks intends to give practical guidelines to show technicians and rural builders how to use simple technologies to design and construct water supply systems, with far more success than has been witnessed over the last three decades. It is hoped that the technical drawings presented on the following pages can be understood by laymen, while still being of a standard approvable by the authorities. The technical drawings are shown in millimetres (mm), centimetres (cm) and metres (m). Since laymen and rural builders in many countries are used to imperial measurements, these are shown in brackets as (”) for inches and (’) for feet, although some of the text also relates to inches and feet, where this was found to be appropriate. Engineers may also find this arrangement useful when they explain measurements to rural builders and farmers. Additional conversion tables are shown on page viii. The designs presented in this publication are shown in two chapters: Chapter 5 deals with construction works that local builders may build without approval by the authorities, while Chapter 6 presents structures for water supply that must be approved by the authorities before any construction works take place. 12\n\n13. 1.3 Consultants and contractors Consultants and contractors are usually self-employed experienced engineers, technicians and builders who work on specified contracts for clients. Consultants Consultants are either self-employed or can be employed on contracts by other consultancy firms. Some consultants have their private consultancy firm, which can be contracted by clients such as Danida, Sida, UN, ministries, NGOs and individuals. Larger consultancy firms may subcontract part of a large project to a smaller consultancy firm, and a small consultancy firm may contract local consultants. In any case, consultants should have proven technical experience and a clean track record, which are clearly presented in their Curriculum Vitae (CV). It is also essential that consultants are conversant with financial management. Most consultants on water development offer their services on activities dealing with water and sanitation, such as: 1) Produce proposals for new programmes 2) Train engineers, technicians, builders and water-user communities 3) Manage new or existing programmes 4) Review and evaluate on-going programmes 5) Present lectures at workshops, seminars and conferences 6) Produce technical articles, manuals and handbooks Contractors Contractors are experienced technicians and builders who are capable of working successfully without close supervision. They must also be able to understand and explain technical drawings, bills of quantities and building procedures to artisans, and to supervise community groups who are usually doing the construction works themselves. Most contractors are specialized in constructing certain types of water projects, although some say they are experts in everything. To avoid hiring an unqualified contractor, a client should always insist on having a look at a contractor’s grade tests, certificates and letters of recommendation before signing a contract with the contractor. The types of construction works which are recommended for small scale local contractors in this handbook are: 1) Manufacturing of bricks and blocks 2) Repairing of leaking water tanks 3) Installation of gutters 4) Service and repair of hand pumps, including storage of spare parts 5) Construction foundations for plastic water tanks 6) Constructing jars and water tanks 7) Constructing new latrines 8) Locating suitable places for sinking hand dug wells by dowsing and probing 9) Sinking hand dug wells safely into deep sand and pits 10) Building subsurface dams of clayey soil in riverbeds 11) Building ponds and small dams of earth 13\n\n14. 1.4 Employed versus self-employed Employees’ constraints Most employed people find that their salaries can hardly pay for their daily expenses and that they have no possibility to increase their financial prosperity above that low survival level. Such people often think that if they could be self-employed they would earn more and increase their living standard. Another constraint for employees is that they must travel to and from work every working day. Traveling by public means is expensive and time consuming. Employees are often blamed by their employer for arriving too late at work in the mornings. Family problems may also arise when employees come home late after work. Employees being harassed at work and, perhaps, also at home for always being late, tired or absent-minded are nearly always looking for a chance to be self-employed. They dream of being their own boss who decides when and where to work with the kind of work they like. They also look forward to take a few working days off to attend private functions or to see the family back home in the rural area. Imagine not having a harsh Construction Foreman or a Manager whom you have to ask for permission to leave work for just a couple of hours! Disadvantage of being self-employed The personal freedom expected by being self-employed may turn out to be many daily working hours and busy weekends with telephone calls at any hour. Time for keeping accounts and preparing quotations or proposals may only be found during weekends and public holidays. Many non-paid working hours have to be spent on talking with potential customers who want to know the cost of this or that. Disappointingly often, such quotations turn out to be a waste of time, because somebody else is given the work for a lower price than that quoted. It costs money to start up a private business, because tools, a computer, machinery or a motor vehicle have to be bought. There is also rent to pay for office or workshop as well as monthly bills for electricity, water, security, VAT, insurance etc. Such financial demands can be stretched over a long period if a business is started up as a spare time activity partly financed by the owner’s salary as an employee, and partly by the business. Another way of learning how to start a business is be an employee or an associate of a contractor who is doing well. Although the pay may be small, it could be a good learning process. 14\n\n15. Chapter 2. Marketing The first activity to consider when thinking of being a self-employed contractor or a consultant is to find out whether the proposed product can be sold. Some methods of marketing are presented below. 2.1 Road side marketing is the cheapest and most efficient way of marketing many types of items. Many items can be sold at good prices along main roads where many travelers pass by, provided there is good and safe parking place for vehicles, such as: Vegetables, chairs, bows, arrows, yokes, bee hives, chickens, sacks of charcoal, stones crushed into ballast and burnt bricks. 15\n\n16. 2.2 Posters and notices are other cheap methods of marketing the sale of goods and the provision of services. Hand written or printed notices pinned onto trees and telephone poles situated along roads with many passers-by are effective messengers. Notice boards in shopping centres, as seen below, and at public offices, also provide excellent marketing opportunities. However, ask for permission before pinning anything on a notice board because there might be a small fee to pay every week or month. The uneven bottoms seen on the notices pinned to the notice board in a shopping centre above, are strips of papers with telephone numbers which can be pulled off by interested persons who want to phone for further details at a later stage. 16\n\n17. 2.3 Signboards are usually painted in bright colours with an arrow pointed to e.g. a hair saloon, which is situated a short walking distance from the road. Often several signboards are required to guide customers to a location which is situated behind several buildings or around some corners. Although a signboard may not be expensive to make, there might be a fee to pay to the local county council, and a signboard needs to be maintained, such as repainting due to graffiti or the weather. While a good signboard set up in a right place might bring many customers, it is doubtful whether a good signboard can attract clients if it is set up among many signboards. Signboards have to be repainted once or twice annually to appear attractive and to show that the business is active and doing good business. This signboard, offering repair of motor vehicles along a main road, can only attract motorists whose vehicles have a total break down just before sunset! 17\n\n18. 2.4 Transportable signboards and exhibits The photo shows a signboard and exhibit of a Super Money Maker pressure irrigation pump. A contractor has made and sold many by transporting the exhibits by bus from one village to another on market days. Contractors could also promote their businesses by selling items such as gutters, spare parts for hand pumps, rope and washer pumps etc. Photos or signboards of repaired and new water tanks as well as hand dug wells, ponds and so on, could also be displayed. Village markets are visited by nearly all inhabitants that live close by and who are interested in selling their farm produce, and, very often, want to find a contractor to repair or construct something which can improve their production of farm produce. 2.5 Photo albums Many small scale manufacturers who cannot afford to display all their produce, such as furniture, use photos to show the various types of beds, chairs, sofa sets, water tanks, gutters etc. which they can make. When a potential customer shows interest in the goods or services being offered, it is important to quote a realistic price with a profit margin of 10% to 20%, plus a similar amount for reducing the price when bargaining. Buyers usually have good knowledge of the going prices, and will walk away if a seller tries to sell an item at double or triple the normal price. 18\n\n19. 2.6 Brochures A brochure can be printed cheaply by somebody having a computer, scanner and printer, e.g. by using both sides of an A4 paper and folding it in three columns. Brochures can be printed in many copies and distributed during agricultural shows, exhibitions and conferences, or attached onto trees, telephone poles and notice boards. 2.7 Company profiles Most potential clients would rely more on a contractor’s capacity if he/she can present a company profile and the legal status of their enterprise. A company profile can be presented like a brochure, but without being folded, and it can consist of several pages. It is advisable to show a few photos and make the text as short and clear as possible, without complicated and technical words, which are not understood by laymen. 19\n\n20. 2.8 Letters of Recommendation Always remember to request satisfied customers to write a Letter of Recommendation, which can be shown as proof of a contractor’s skills and capacity to potential customers. Recommendation letters should contain a description of the services rendered and the customers name and mobile number. Letters of Recommendation can also be written as shown in the following: TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN This is to certify that M/rs ………………….. worked for this company as a Construction Supervisor on small scale water projects in Eastern Province of Kenya from 1st March 2007 to 2nd November 2007. Mr/s ……………. has cooperated well with his/her colleagues, has taken his/her work seriously and performed with integrity. His/her personal conduct is polite and humble. Due to the closure of the small scale water project, Mr/s …………… employment will end on 2nd November this year. Yours faithfully, …………………………… Managing Director 2.9 Curriculum Vitae (CV) CVs are required when applying for employment, but are also useful to show to potential clients who want to know what a contractor can do. CVs are usually presented as follows: Curriculum Vitae Name: Address: Email: Telephone: Sex: Marital status: Date of birth Nationality: Professional Field Technical institutions attended Academic year Institution Grade/Qualifications Referees Name Position Telephone number Attach only photocopies of certificates, diplomas, Letters of Recommendation, ID cards, passport photos etc. to applications. Do not ask for your copies to be returned, because employers are busy people who do not want to waste their time on unnecessary tasks. 20\n\n21. Chapter 3. Agreements and contracts 3.1 Verbal agreements Verbal agreements on the provision of labour between a client and a contractor are the most used method for contracting smaller construction jobs, such as making bricks, concreting foundations, building and plastering walls, and making roofs for water tanks and houses. Normally, the client supplies all the required materials while the contractor brings his tools and equipment. If the contractor comes from far, the client may provide bus fares, food and accommodation in addition to an agreed payment. Such payments are based on a daily salary of about Ksh 500 for the number of working days that the two parties shall agree on. A down payment of 10% to 20% of the total payment is normal when a verbal agreement is made “so that the contractor’s wife can buy food while her husband is going to be away”. Since some clients tend to delay, or even neglect, agreed-upon payment rates, contractors have to ask for the agreed payment rates due to “very urgent matters with the wife and kids at home”. One of the reasons why a client may delay payments to a contractor is that, if the contractor is paid too much up front, the contractor may disappear from work and perhaps for good. Another reason for clients to delay payments is to find out whether e.g. a water tank will develop leakages when full of water. Local contractors can only give a verbal warranty for their work and they are very reluctant to repair their work without extra payment. Dishonestly, some clients never intend to pay the last installment to a contractor, because the contractor cannot bring the case to court due to lack of evidence, such as a written contract. 3.2 Contracts To avoid such problems, it is recommended that a client and his contractor should write a simple contract. Such a contract should state the scope of work and payment rates for the work, such as: down payment, payment rates and a retention fee, which will be paid when the completed structure has functioned for 90 days without problems. Contracts should also state whether 5% withholding tax shall be deducted from monthly salaries exceeding Ksh 24,000. It is also important to state whether the client or the contractor shall pay for the contractor’s medical expenses in case of accidents or sickness during his work for the client. Should a problem arise between a client and his contractor, both or one of them can present the contract to the Locational Chief for a settlement. Should the chief refuse to handle the case, it can be brought either to an advocate or to the chief’s superior, the District Officer. 21\n\n22. A contract could be written as follows: 3.3 CONTRACT FOR CONSTRUCTION OF …………………. This is a contract between ……………………, P.O. Box ….., ………….Tel…….., hereafter called The Client, and M.. ……….……….., ID number………….. , P.O. Box …., ……….…, Tel. …………, hereafter called the The Contractor, who shall construct …………………………………for which the design has been approved by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MoWI) and which is described below: Detailed description of the work to be carried out by the Contractor is as follows: 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6) The Contractor is not an employee of the Client. Therefore no other benefits or compensation than the fee stated below will be provided. The Contractor is responsible for paying his and his employees’ taxes, telephone, stationeries, office facilities, bus fares, accommodation, medical expenses and all other costs that he may incur in connection with this contract. The Client shall pay the Contractor for the services listed above, as follows: A total of Ksh ……..… as follows: Ksh ……… upon signing this contract. Ksh …..…… when the work has been approved by the MoWI and they have issued a Completion Certificate to the Client. Ksh …………. shall be paid as retention fee when the structure has functioned without problems for 90 days after the Completion Certificate was issued. Monthly payments exceeding Ksh 24,000 shall be deducted 5% withholding tax, which the client shall submit by cheque to the Collector of Income Tax before the 20th of the following month. On this we agree .…/…./…. (day/month/year) ……………………………………. ……………………………………. The Contractor The Client 22\n\n23. 3.4 Design and permit for construction of water projects It is the clients’ responsibility to obtain a design and get it approved by the relevant authorities. Whether the proposed project belongs to an individual or a community, it is recommended to contract a water engineer or technician to carry out an evaluation of the project area to find the most potential site in the project area and to draw and design it. Engineers and technicians can also produce a list, called a Bill of Quantities (BQ), with the required working days and materials for the designed project. BQs are used by clients to find the actual construction cost of a designed structure by requesting for quotations from various hardware shops and contractors. Clients are not bound to accept the cheapest quotation, but they will also consider who is most capable of carrying out the task, among others from the contractors’ track records. Applications for water permits must be sent or taken to MoWI and should contain the following: A design drawing in A1 format showing a Plan, a Longitudinal Profile, one or more Cross Sections, a map sketch and a text box in A1 format as shown below. For private water projects the owner should produce an Application Letter with photocopies of his/her Title Deed with its clauses. For community water projects, the project committee should apply with an Application Letter, photocopy of Title Deed with its clauses, a Land Agreement between the owner and the community on the access and usage of the water source, a Registration Certificate with the Department of Social Services and an Implementation Agreement or a contract with the consultant or contractor who designed the project and shall construct it. 23\n\n24. Applications are presented to the nearest office of the MoWI for its approval and submitting it to the Water Resource Management Authority (WRMA) for their approval and assessment of annual fees on behalf of the local Water Services Board (WSB). The annual fee varies for according to the type of water projects. The Water Act of 2002 is now being applied by MOWI through: 3.5 Water Services Trust Fund Their headquarters are situated on 2nd floor, Mara Road, Upper Hill, P.O. Box 49699 – 00100, Nairobi. Tel. 2720696, fax 2723457, email info@wstfkenya.org In an advert in Daily Nation on 22/11/07, the Trust Fund announced that is has funded 131 water projects by October 2007 and that 47 of these projects have been completed, while 60 projects are on-going. The value of the projects funded is Ksh 1.048 billion and the target population is 1,077,000 people. 3.6 Water Services Boards The Water Act of 2002 in Kenya is now being applied through 7 Water Services Boards (WSBs). Applications for construction and rehabilitation of water projects should be submitted to the appropriate Water Services Board on the following address: Athi Water Services Board, P.O. Box 45283, 00100 Nairobi Tana Water Services Board, P.O. Box 1343, Nyeri Coast Water Services Board, P.O. Box 90417, 80100 Mombasa Lake Victoria South Water Services Board, P.O. Box 3325, Kisumu Lake Victoria North Water Services Board, P.O. Box 673, Kakamega Rift Valley Water Services Board, P.O. Box 220, Nakuru Northern Water Services Board, P.O. Box 495, Garissa A map showing the area of the 7 Water Services Boards (WSBs) in Kenya and the location of the 6 water projects constructed as pilot projects for MoWI in 2004-5, which are described in the first handbook of this series Water for Rural Communities. 24\n\n25. 3.7 Quotations for governmental water projects Requests for official quotations consist of a form called S.10, REQUEST FOR QUOTATION, which can be posted to or collected by contractors who have been approved by the District Procurement Officer. Conditions and advice are printed on the reverse of the form. Design drawings, Bill of Quantities and map sketches are attached to the form. This quotation requests a trained contractor to quote his labour cost for constructing a berkad ground tank at Samburu in Kwale. The contractor can reply by filling in his cost, sign the form and return it to the office that sent it to contractor. 25\n\n26. 3.8 Proposals A proposals is made by a contractor with the hope of getting a contract for his/her services and expertise, and the proposal will describe the method and inputs that the contractor intends to use, and the price. Proposals must therefore be written in a clear and transparent way, which can convince potential clients. A potential client may request a couple of contractors or consultants to write and present a proposal, e.g.on conducting a training course or sinking a hand dug well. The client will compare the quotations and select the proposal that they consider to be the most appropriate and realistic, and that is competitive price wise. The client will usually expect the chosen contractor or consultant to change a few things in the proposal before a contract can be agreed upon. The process of writing and presenting proposals is done by the contractor free of charge, as is the task of negotiating a proposal with a client. And no payments are made when a client changes a few paragraphs in a good proposal, and then contracts a third party to implement the proposal, usually at a lower cost than the original proposal. The guidelines for writing a proposal should contain the following subjects in short sentences and clear English, without complicated words or phrases: 1) Why this proposal is needed? 2) State any Positive and Negative Impacts that the proposal will cause 3) Which governmental authorities shall be involved? 4) What is the Time Frame and location of implementation? 5) Are there various Stages of Implementation? 6) State the proposed Work Plan 7) Estimate a transparent Budget 8) What are your Expectations if this proposal will be implemented? 9) What are your Expertise and References for implementing this proposal? 10) Repeat your main points in Conclusions 11) Finally, write the Summary and Contents for the first page of the proposal. Insert some relevant and illustrative colour photos relating to text, where a visual display can explain more than many words. Also explain time frame, work plan and budget in tables. If any risks are involved in implementing the proposal, these must be stated as well as how to deal with the risks. Print and bind the proposal in a neat and professional manner, with a letter head containing telephone numbers, email, postal address, etc. Present the proposal personally by hand to the client directly, while appearing well- groomed and wearing clean clothes and polished shoes. Offer the client to have a look at your photo album or to receive a CD or DVD containing slides, video films or PowerPoint presentations of your work, because the visual impact of a proposal is more efficient than a long written proposal. 26\n\n27. 3.9 Potential donor organizations Proposals on water and sanitation projects can be presented to various organizations dealing with such projects, of which some are listed below. Additional organizations may be found in telephone directories and in the booklet Directory & Profiles of NGOs in Eastern Africa, published by Africa Church Information Service and available from New Dawn Media Services, AJS House, Suite 103, Keekorok/Jainsalak Road in Nairobi, tel. 312776/8, 0720585001 and 0721747968.

Chapter 4. Production of bricks and blocks This chapter explains some of the items that small scale entrepreneurs can produce with a minimum of investments and risks. The investment can be as little as a mobile phone, a tool box, a bicycle and a signboard, which can be displayed at weekly market days. 4.1 Burnt bricks Earth for making soil bricks may be clay, loam or even ant heaps. To test whether a soil is suitable for bricks, mould a trial brick and place it in the sun until dry, and if it hardens without cracking, the soil is suitable. Soil for making bricks can also be analyzed in a transparent plastic bottle filled halfway with a soil sample and topped up with water, as seen in the photo. After a couple of hours, the saturated soil in this sample had a height of 115 mm, of which the upper layer of clay was 60 mm high and the lower layer of sand was 55 mm. The soil sample therefore consisted of: 60 mm x 100 = 52 % of clay and 55 mm x 100 = 48 % of sand 115 mm 115 mm This soil was used to make the burnt bricks described below. Test of burnt bricks The University of Nairobi tested some of the burnt bricks, and found that the bricks can be used for water tanks provided both sides of the brick wall are plastered.

Procedure for making burnt bricks Soil and water are mixed to a soft and thick consistency using bare feet. It takes 3 men about 2 hours and 1 ½ oil drum (300 litres) of water to mould 200 bricks. Bricks are moulded in a box made of timber, with an internal length of 12 inches (30.5 cm), an internal width of 6 inches (15.3 cm) and a height of 4 inches (10.2 cm). Soil is mixed until it has no dry lumps, then thrown into a mould box to press out air. The soil is cut off the top of the box with a stick. A box filled with soil is emptied on the ground by turning the box upside down while dropping it on the ground. The box is then lifted up from the ground, while leaving the moulded brick to be dried in the sun for 3 to 4 days. Sun dried bricks must be stacked in a certain pattern, otherwise the bricks will not be properly burnt. The first layer of sun-dried bricks for a stack of 1,500 bricks is laid in a square measuring 7 feet x 8 feet, with the longest side facing the direction of the wind. Two empty spaces for the firewood, being 2 feet wide, separate the 4 rows of bricks. 29\n\n30. The second layer of bricks is then laid upon the first layer as shown in the photo. The bricks must be stacked close to each other. Any open spaces between the bricks must be filled with small pieces of bricks. The third layer of bricks and the corners of the fourth layer are then stacked upon the second layer. Note how the width over the two places for the firewood is being narrowed. The fourth layer of bricks is completed and the corners for the fifth layer are laid out. The fifth layer of bricks makes the roof for the two firewood places. The sixth layer is stacked. 30\n\n31. The seventh, eight, ninth and tenth layers are stacked in alternate directions in order to stabilize the stack and to distribute the heat from the firewood equally in the stack. Dusty cow manure is placed in a thin layer on top of high stacks to create additional heat during the burning. Logs from a hardwood tree are placed in the two firewood places. The two rear openings are closed with bricks and plastered with mud, except for a few breathing holes. The sides, but not the top of the kiln, are plastered with mud. The firewood is sat on fire in the strong evening wind. More firewood is added until the first bricks start to turn red by heat. Then the fireplaces are closed with bricks and plastered with clay. After 3 to 4 days of burning, the stack begins to cool down and the burnt bricks can be taken out of the stack. The burnt bricks are placed in rows of sloping lines so that it is easy to count them. The sloping position of the bricks also prevents them from being damaged by rainwater. 31\n\n32. 4.2 Concrete blocks Production of concrete blocks can be a profitable enterprise in areas where water, river sand, pebbles and stones are plentiful and cheap. Test of strength The University of Nairobi has tested samples of the blocks and found that the weakest concrete blocks, 1:8:4, can stand a stress 6 times more than is required for water tanks. Type of material Mixing Dimensions Crushing Stress ratio length x width x height load (N) (N/mm2) Concrete blocks 1:5:4 130 x 330 x 180 210 4.90 1:6:4 130 x 330 x 180 165 3.80 1:7:4 130 x 330 x 180 95 2.20 1:8:4 130 x 330 x 180 55 1.30 Minimum requirement 32 0.25 Required tools A steel mould is required, with a length of 38.1 cm (15”), a width of 17.8 cm (7”) and a height of 12.7 cm (5”), which consists of two halves joined together with two iron pins. Other tools are: a mason trowel, a mason hammer, a shovel, a bucket and a wheelbarrow. Mixing ratio 4 different mixing ratios were tested in making the concrete blocks, the first mixing ratio was: 1 part of cement to 5 parts of sand to 4 parts of ballast (1:5:4), the second was: 1:6:4, the third: was 1:7:4, and finally the fourth was: 1:8:4. In order to reduce the consumption of cement and ballast, rubble stones were compacted into the concrete, which reduced the production cost with about 30%. Production cost of 1 block using mixing ratio 1:8:4: Average Ksh 33.69 Item Quantity Cost at Nyayo Cost at Kwale Cost at Mwingi Cement 1 bag 700 700 750 Sand 8 wheelbarrows 600 400 240 Ballast 4 wheelbarrows 300 400 240 Hardcore 1 wheelbarrows 80 40 90 Water 5 jerry cans 70 140 67 Labour 12 hours 180 180 180 Cost of 53 blocks of 1,930 / 53 blocks = 1,860 / 53 blocks = 1,567 / 53 blocks = 1 block 1 bag of cement 36.42 for 1 block 35.09 for 1 block 29.57 for 1 block Production cost per 1 square metre wall Types of bricks and blocks Average cost of 1 Number of bricks or Cost of block or 1 brick blocks per 1 sq.m. 1 sq.m.

Procedure for making concrete blocks The mixing ratio of sand, ballast and cement is measured in a wheelbarrow, where the level of 1 bag of cement is marked on the inner side of the wheelbarrow. The volume of sand is measured by filling the sand up to that mark in the wheelbarrow. If the mixing ratio is 1:8, then 8 wheelbarrows of sand is required for every 1 bag of cement. Manual mixing of concrete should always be made as follows: 1) Off load the required 8 wheelbarrows of sand in a heap. 2) Empty the single required bag of cement on top of the heap. 3) Shovel the first heap into a second heap without water as shown in the photo. 4) Shovel the second heap back into a third heap without water. 5) Shovel the third heap into a fourth heap without water and flatten the heap. 6) Off load the required 4 wheelbarrows of ballast onto the flattened heap of mixed sand and cement. 7) Now add a little water at one edge of the heap of ballast, sand and cement. 8) Then mix the ballast and water with the mixed sand and cement until it has a uniform consistency. 9) Use the mixed concrete in less than 1 hour, otherwise the strength of the concrete will be greatly reduced. 33\n\n34. 10) The steel mould is assembled with the two short iron pins and placed on a level and clean ground, preferably covered with empty cement bags or polythene bags or sheets. 11) A layer of concrete is placed in the bottom of the mould and a couple of stones are laid upon the concrete. The mould is filled up with concrete and it is compacted with a short piece of timber and leveled off. 12) For testing purposes, the mixing ratio was written in the wet concrete. Later in the day, the newly made concrete blocks are sprinkled with water and covered with any type of farm waste which is available, in order to cure the blocks. After a couple of days of curing the blocks on the ground where they were made, the blocks should be piled under a shady tree and covered with empty cement bags of polythene sheets as shown in this photo. Concrete blocks, as well as other concrete works, obtain their maximum strength after 28 days of curing. Lack of proper curing may reduce the strength of concrete works with 50%. 34\n\n35. 4.3 Soil compressed blocks Production of soil compressed blocks is environmentally friendly, because only very little water, very little cement and no firewood is used for the production process. However, a manual operated press machine costs Ksh 45,000, plus transport from Ndugu Metawood Society, P.O. Box 12816, 00100, Nairobi, to its destination. Test of strength of soil compressed blocks The University of Nairobi has tested samples of soil blocks made of the mixture ratio of 1 part of cement to 12 parts of soil (= 1:12), and 1:14, 1:16 and 1:18, under a load of up to 1000 KN against crushing, which gave the following test results: Type of material Mixing Dimensions Crushing Stress ratio length x width x height load (N) (N/mm2) Soil blocks; cement to soil 1:12 110 x 290 x 150 51 1.60 1:14 110 x 290 x 150 68 2.10 1:16 110 x 290 x 150 31 1.00 1:18 110 x 270 x 150 35 1.10 Minimum requirement 32 0.29 Soil analysis A transparent bottle is filled halfway with a soil sample. The bottle is almost filled with water. A pinch of salt is added to segregate the soil particles within a short time. The bottle is shaken for 1 minute. After 1 hour, the heavy sand and gravel will settle at the bottom of the bottle, while lighter clay and silt will settle on top of the sand and gravel. The percentages of gravel, sand, clay and silt are found by measuring the height of the soil sample and divide it with the thickness of gravel, sand, clay and silt, as shown below. Height of soil sample in the bottle: 148 mm = 100 % Height of silt and clay: 26 mm x 100 = 17.57 % silt and clay 148 mm Height of sand: 40 mm x 100 = 27.03 % sand 148 mm Height of gravel: 82 mm x 100 = 55.40 % gravel 148 mm Soil with the lowest content of clay is the most suitable. 35\n\n36. Ratio of cement to soil The ratio of cement to soil depends on the shrinkage of the soil, and the number of blocks that can be produced from 1 bag of cement depends on the mixing ratio. Shrinkage test The shrinkage of soil samples is found by making a box of either wood or metal with the following measurements: Length 600 mm, width 41 mm and height 41 mm, which gives a volume of 1 litre. Mix a sieved soil sample with water until it is fully saturated, then fill it in into the box and remove excess soil by levelling it at the top of the box. The box is then placed in the sunshine, e.g. on a roof, until the water in the soil has evaporated after a few days. By then the soil will have shrunk and cracked. Push the soil to one end of the box and measure the gap in the other end of the box. The soil seen in the photo had a shrinkage of 12 mm. Number of soil blocks from 1 bag of cement Soil with a shrinkage of 12 mm and less is the most economical, because it produces the highest number of blocks from 1 bag of cement, as shown in the table below. Shrinkage Cement Ratio of soil to Number of blocks from cement 1 bag of cement 12 mm 1 bag of 50 kg 12 soil to1 cement 85 blocks 12 mm 1 bag of 50 kg 14 soil to1 cement 95 blocks 12 mm 1 bag of 50 kg 16 soil to1 cement 111 blocks 12 mm 1 bag of 50 kg 18 soil to1 cement 139 blocks Production cost of soil blocks The production cost of blocks reduces as the ratio of soil is increased, because soil is considered a free ingredient. The relation between mixing ratio and cost is shown below.

Procedure for making soil compressed blocks When the best soil has been located using the bottle analysis, and the ratio of cement to sand has been determined using the shrinkage method, the soil is then transported to a site with flat ground, preferably under some large trees giving shade. Lumps in the soil are broken into fine particles by using a short piece of flat timber. Thereafter the soil is sieved on a 3 ft. x 6 ft. (90 cm x 180 cm) frame of 4” x 2” timber, onto which coffee mesh has been nailed with ceiling nails. Small lumps of soil are broken once more with the timber and sieved again. To ensure the correct ratio of cement to soil, a bag of cement is emptied and leveled in a wheelbarrow. The level of the cement is marked on the sides of the wheelbarrow. Sieved soil is then measured by filling it to the marked level on the sides of the wheelbarrow. A ratio of 12:1 means 12 wheelbarrows of soil to 1 bag of cement. The required number of wheelbarrows of sieved soil is offloaded in a heap and 1 bag of cement is emptied on top of the heap of soil. The following method gives the best mixing with a minimum amount of labour: Soil and cement are mixed 4 times without water by shoveling it from the first heap to the top of a second heap, from there to the top of a third heap and from there to a fourth heap. When the machine is oiled and ready for operation, some of the mixed soil is moistened lightly with water and the mould box of the machine is opened and filled with soil. 37\n\n38. Then the lid is closed on the mould box and the handle turned over and pulled down by one person. This action presses the piston, being the bottom of the mould box, up against the lid thereby compressing the soil in the mould box. The correct pressure exerted by the piston is regulated by turning a knob (seen as a short pipe between the legs at the bottom of the machine) either upwards for reducing the pressure or downwards for increasing it. The correct pressure is the weight of a middle- sized person pulling down the handle. The photo shows a big man applying too high a pressure. When the handle has been pulled down, it is raised to vertical position and pulled down on the other side of the machine, while opening the lid on the mould box. This action presses the piston up to the top of the mould box, thereby pushing the compressed block free of the mould box. The block can now be carried to a shady place for curing. Curing is an important part of manufacturing blocks, because they become brittle and weak without proper curing. In the evening of the same day when the blocks are made, a perforated plastic container is used for giving the blocks a light shower of water. Next morning, the block get a second shower and are then covered with any farm waste or paper that can keep the blocks under shade. After a few days the blocks are stacked under a shady tree, as shown on the photo, and covered with e.g. empty cement bags, plastic or old newspapers. 38\n\n39. Chapter 5. Private water and sanitation projects 5.1 Repairs of water tanks Many old water tanks, and some new ones, leak, due to various reasons such as lack of proper curing, insufficient reinforcement, substandard materials or poor workmanship. Most of such tanks can be repaired successfully and profitably by small scale contractors using the guidelines presented below. Leakage through cracked walls Due to insufficient reinforcement of tank walls, water will leak through cracks and fissures of the tanks. Such tanks can be repaired by the following procedure: 1) Chisel off all loose parts on the outside of the wall and the outside of the foundation. 2) Wrap sheets of weld mesh, or BRC mesh, tightly around the tank with 20 cm overlaps. 3) Plaster a 3 cm thick coat of cement mortar 1:3 onto the mesh and smoothen it off. 4) Wrap empty sacks or polythene sheets tightly around the plaster with sisal twine, while keeping the plaster moist for 3 weeks. 5) Then paint the external side of the tank with a weather-proof paint, made by mixing 1 part of cement with 10 parts of lime and water. Weld mesh being plastered Water poured on the plastered with cement mortar 1:3. wall covered with polythene. 39\n\n40. Leakage between foundations and walls Many water tanks suffer from leakage between the foundation and the wall due to poor workmanship. It is rather simple and cheap to repair this type of leakage, by following the procedures below: Carefully chisel a groove, being about 3 cm x 3 cm, all around the joint between the wall and the foundation, on both the external (outside) wall and on the internal (inside) sides. Roughen and thoroughly clean a 15 cm wide stretch of the foundation along the inside and outside groove. Wrap 2 rounds of barbed wire tightly around the external groove. Moisten both grooves and compact cement mortar 1:2 into the grooves. Thereafter compact an apron of mortar 1:2, being 15cm wide and 10 cm high, against the grooves on both sides of the tank. Keep the two aprons moist and under shade for 3 weeks. An internal, curved apron can be made An external apron is smoothened with using a piece of Bamboo or a bottle. a wooden float. 40\n\n41. Seepage through walls Water can seep through parts of the walls of water tanks, although no cracks or fissures are seen. Seepage through walls appears as moist and cool places, and is caused by poorly mixed mortar, too little cement in the mortar, poor curing and/or poor workmanship. Such tanks can be repaired as follows: Chisel off any loose parts on the internal side of the tank. Clean the chiseled off places with water and throw dry cement onto the wet surfaces. Half an hour later, apply cement mortar 1:2 to those places, smoothen them and keep them moist under shade for 7 days. Then paint the internal side of the wall with either paint for swimming pools or Bitumen specifically made for water tanks. Leakage through cracked foundations Usually foundations will crack if the reinforcement and/or the thickness of the concrete is insufficient to withstand the weight of the water in the tank. Another reason for a cracked foundation is that the roots of a tree have found their way under the tank. Therefore no tree should be allowed to grow within 15 metres from a water tank. Cracked foundations cannot be repaired, and a new foundation must be built onto the cracked one, as follows: Cut weld mesh which must cover the whole of the old foundation, right up against the wall, with overlaps being 20 cm wide, which are tied together with binding wires. Remove the circular sheet of weld mesh from the tank. Fill all cracks in the old foundation with Bitumen paste. Compact a 10 cm thick layer of concrete 1:3:3 onto the old foundation. Place the circular sheet of weld mesh on the concrete and compact another 10 cm thick layer of concrete 1:3:3 onto the weld mesh. Smoothen the concrete and apply a coat of cement slurry (NIL) within the same day. Next day, compact an apron of mortar 1:2 around the internal joint of the wall and new foundation. 41\n\n42. 5.2 Tanks built of bricks and blocks Introduction Almost all kinds of bricks and blocks can be used for construction of water tanks, provided they are reinforced sufficiently, plastered to be water proof and kept moist under shade (cured) for 3 weeks. Bricks made of soil in a hand operated press are cheap and suitable for construction of water tanks. The bricks are friendly to the environment because very little water and no firewood are required for making the bricks. Construction procedures Foundation and centre pipe The circular excavation for a 10 cu.m. tank has a radius of 160 cm, and the tank wall must be situated 90 cm from the wall of the house. The foundation is dug to a depth of 250 cm below the eave of the roof and at least 15 cm into solid soil. The foundation is made of a 13 cm thick, concrete mixture1:3:4, with a layer of weld mesh in the middle. Also a 90 cm draw-off pipe of 18 mm G.I. pipe is put in the concrete. A 200 cm G.I. pipe of 18 mm is concreted exactly in the centre of the upper layer of concrete in the foundation as a guide for the builder. The wall of bricks or blocks Tie a 180 cm long wire to the vertical centre post, bend the other end to get a radius of 145 cm, which gives the exact position of the outer corners of the bricks or bends to be laid for the circular wall of the tank. The thickness of the vertical joints between the bricks or blocks is found by laying them out along the circle given by the radius wire, and spacing them without mortar. Do not cut the bricks/blocks. Column and beam When the wall is built to a height of 200 cm, a 100 mm PVC pipe is cut to a length of 185 cm. The ends of 4 lengths of 18 mm G.I. pipes, 60 cm long, are heated over fire and inserted into the PVC pipe at equal distances. The PVC pipe is then placed around the centre pipe and filled with concrete. 42\n\n43. Plaster The outside of the tank is plastered with 2 cm of mortar 1:4. The interior wall and floor is plastered with 2 cm of 1:3 mortar, onto which NIL is applied with a square steel trowel for water proofing. Roof and tap stand If a beam is required for a flat roof of reinforced concrete, it is made in formwork of timber being 10 cm wide and 15 cm deep, and 4 lengths of twisted iron rods are laid into it. The formwork for the roof consists of timbers supported by props. A basin, 2 tins and the overflow pipe are placed on the formwork for the roof. The beam and the formwork are then covered with 10 cm of concrete 1:3:4. After 3 weeks of curing, the formwork can be removed and used elsewhere.

Square gutter made of G.I. sheets. Square gutter made of timber. Gutter made of split bamboo. Gradient of gutters The gutter should have a sloping gradient of 1:100 towards the water tank. The gradient is measured by a transparent hosepipe tied to both ends of a roof, say 20 m long. Water is filled into the pipe until the water level reaches the roofing sheet at Point A. The required gradient, i.e. a drop of 20 cm over the length of 2,000 cm (1:100), is achieved at a point which is 20 cm below the horizontal water level at Point B. 47\n\n48. While a gradient of 1:100 functions well on short roofs, rainwater spills over the gutter on long roofs, where the gutter is situated more than 10 cm below the roofing sheets. This is solved by nailing iron sheets with a vertical lip, a skirting, onto the roofing sheets. Three lengths of skirting can be cut Another advantage of the skirting is that it from an iron sheet being 100 cm wide. can be used for attaching gutters on uneven roofs and on roofs without facia boards. 3 lengths of V-shaped gutters or square gutters are made from an iron sheet being 100 cm wide. Hangers for suspending V-shaped and square gutters from skirtings are made from bent, 3 mm, G.I. wires, which are attached to the skirting with 1 mm G.I. wires. It is recommended that the gutter continues right up to the inlet of the water tank, to avoid expensive and blocked down-pipes. A self-cleaning inlet to a tank is shown above. 48\n\n49. 5.4 Rope and washer pump Hand pumps are expensive to procure and repair for communities and individuals. It is therefore preferable to use simple but functioning water pumps instead of expensive and non-functioning hand pumps. The ACK Eldoret Region, P.O. Box 6495, Eldoret, clrcco@net2000ke.com has been offering training and sale of Rope and Washer Pumps for many years. RELMA of Sida has also been promoting this type of water lifts. It is thought that the production and servicing of these pumps could be a good private enterprise for some contractors. The rope and washer pump can lift water from the well and up to ground level and surface reservoirs, such as ponds, dams and rivers, and up to elevated water tanks as shown above and in the photos on the next page. According to ACK, their rope and washer pumps have the following pumping capacity: Depth in feet Depth in metres Litres per minute Minutes to fill an oil drum 15 5 85 3 24 8 42 5 36 12 27 8 51 17 19 11 63 21 15 14 75 25 13 16 100 33 10 21 127 42 9 25 49\n\n50. A demonstration pump at ACK in Eldoret. Turning the wheel made of an old car tyre causes the rope and washers to move up through the ¾” Class C riser pipe, thereby lifting the water up to the outlet pipe. The nylon rope, with rubber washers made of an old car tyre and spaced at intervals, goes around the wheel and the pulley situated in a concrete block at the bottom. A wheel from a bicycle is welded onto the axle, with the wheel functioning as a non-return mechanism and a bearing. A rope and washer pump on a hand dug well for a community at Kusa near Lake Victoria. Another rope and washer pump being used to lift road run-off water from a ground tank, for irrigation of vegetables in Mwala near Machakos. A long almost horizontal riser pipe delivers water from a pond to an elevated tank, for irrigation purposes at an organic farm near Thika. 50\n\n51. 5.5 Latrines Latrine slabs should ideally be made near a riverbed with easy acces to sand and water. The production site should also be situated at a public road, where many people can see the latrine slabs and latrines displayed for sale. This square slab has 4 handles of iron rods to lift and transport the slab, used in a popular low-cost latrine called the AborLoo, where the slab is placed over a pit, 80 cm x 80 cm wide and only 100 cm deep. When the pit is almost filled up, another pit is dug nearby and the slab is transferred to cover the new pit, while the old pit is covered with soil. The 4 handles are also used for anchoring walls made of light materials, such as bamboo or papyrus mats, or gunny sacks coated with cement slurry, onto the slab. To avoid flies and bad smell, the squat hole should either be covered with a lid, or a few handfuls of soil mixed with ashes should be thrown in after each use of the latrine. The construction cost of building a latrine can be limited to the slab only, if the door is made of two short walls and the roof is made of mats, plastic or gunny bags. Latrine slabs may also be circular, with a hole for a ventilation pipe. In any case, latrine slabs must always be reinforced with a layer of chicken mesh, weld mesh, wire mesh or a mesh of wires spaced 10 cm apart. The concrete mixture should be 1 part cement to 3 parts of river sand and 3 parts of crushed stones (1:3:3), which is kept moist under shade for 3 weeks. 51\n\n52. For those who find squatting painful or old- fashioned, a pedestal can be made as follows: Make a circular hole with a diameter of 20 cm in the slab. Wrap a layer of chicken mesh around a plastic bucket and plaster it with a 3 cm thick coat of cement mortar of 1:3. The bucket is removed after the plaster has been kept moist under shade for 1 week. Make a mould for a toilet seat by pressing a plastic toilet seat, upside down, into a square of freshly made cement mortar 1:3, which is reinforced with chicken mesh. Remove the plastic seat and cure the mould for a week. Smoothen the surface of the mould with fine sand paper and grease it. Cut chicken mesh to fit in the mould, and attach short wires to it for fitting the seat to the pedestal. Compact cement mortar 1:3 on the wire, laying in the mould. Level off the mortar and keep it moist under shade for 1 week. Now mortar the seat to the pedestal with the short wires. Coat the seat and the pedestal with several layers of oil paint.

Chapter 6. Community water projects The three types of structures recommended in this chapter require permits from the Ministry of Water and Irrigation before the construction work can be allowed to start, as explained in Chapter 3. It should also be noted that more detailed survey, design and building instructions are presented in the following hand books of this series, namely Water from Dry Riverbeds, Water from Small Earth Dams and Water from Roads. Should these publications be out of stock, they can be downloaded for free from our website www.waterforaridland.com 6.1 Hand dug wells Water-indicating vegetation The most obvious method to identify places with shallow ground water reachable by hand dug wells is to know certain species of trees, whose roots must reach down into the water table to survive droughts. This traditional information is compiled below. Botanical name Kiswahili / Kikamba English name Depth to names water-level Cyperus rotundus Kiindiu Tall grass 3 m to 7 m Vangueria tomentosa Muiru / Kikomoa 5 m to 10 m Delonix elata Mwangi 5 m to 10 m Markhamia hildebranditi Muu / Chyoo 8 m to 15 m Hyphaene thebacia Kikoko / Ilala Doum Palm 9 m to 15 m Borassus flabellierfer Mvumo / Kyatha Palm w. bulge 9 m to 15 m Ficus walkefieldii Mombu Wild fig 9 m to 15 m Ficus natalensis Mugumo / Muumo Wild fig 9 m to 15 m Ficus sycamore Mkuyu / Mukuyu Wild fig 9 m to 15 m Kigelia aethiopica Mvunga-vunga / Muatini German sausage 9 m to 20 m Piptadenia hildebranditi Mgunga / Mukami 9 m to 20 m Mgunga / Munina 9 m to 20 m Dowsing Gifted persons can use dowsing to locate underground water sources, by using a tool made from a 1m long brazing rod, cut in two halves, with each half bent at the end to make a handle. Hold the dowsing rods loosely, parallel to each other, and point them down-wards so that they can swing freely. The hands must be held steady to allow gravity to pull the rods downwards. When walking slowly over an underground water source, the (parallel) rods will swing inwards. A strong pull indicates much water at a shallow depth, while a small pull indicates either less water, a deep water table, or both possibilities. 53\n\n54. Probing Probing can give accurate profiles of sandy riverbeds, which are used for identifying the most ideal sites for hand dug wells and underground dykes for subsurface dams, weirs or sand dams, as shown in the longitudinal profile of a riverbed below. The sand is deepest and stores water without seepage at probing Point 14. A hand dug well was therefore sunk at that point. A subsurface dam was built of soil onto the underground dyke at probing Point 19. The subsurface dam increased the yield of water from the hand dug well from 10,000 litres per hour to 24,000 litres per hour. Probing consists of hammering a long smooth 16 mm iron rod down into the sand until it reaches the floor under the sand. Thereafter the surface level is marked on the iron rod and it is pulled up. The depth to the water level, or lack of it, is seen on the iron rod and is measured and noted down. Sand is trapped in notches that are cut in the probing rod, to show its coarseness, which determines the volume of water that can be extracted from that particular type of sand. A probing rod with notches. Other potential sites for hand dug wells may be found in seepage lines downstream of earth dams, in land depressions, at foothills and near underground springs and swampy areas. 54"
