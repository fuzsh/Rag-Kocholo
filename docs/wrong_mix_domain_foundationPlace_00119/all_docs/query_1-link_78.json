        "text": "On this page:\n\nCleanup Status\n\nSite Description\n\nContaminants at this Facility\n\nInstitutional/Engineer Controls\n\nLand Reuse\n\nSite Responsibility\n\nEPA has reached agreement on a proposed Prospective Purchaser Agreement (PPA) with Sparrows Point Terminal, LLC (SPT) regarding its purchase of the Facility. SPT proposes to redevelop the Facility property under a long-term ground leasing program with commercial logistics, transportation, and manufacturing tenants. The PPA requires SPT to perform on-shore work; pay $3.0 million for off-shore investigation and pay EPA’s oversight costs. In exchange, the PPA provides SPT with a covenant not to sue under Sections 106 and 107(a) of CERCLA (also known as the Superfund Law), 42 U.S.C. §§ 9606 and 9607(a), and Sections 3005, 3008(a), and 7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 6925, 6928(a), and 6973 for \"Existing Contamination\" as defined in the PPA. As of May 2024, EPA, and the Maryland Department of Environmental Protection (MDE) have completed reviews for the investigation of almost the entirety of the 3,100- acre Site, facilitating the reuse and redevelopment of almost 70% of the property thus far.\n\nCleanup Status\n\nPhase II Work Plans\n\nEPA and MDE (Agencies) have received Phase II Work Plans with proposed soil, groundwater and soil gas sampling points based on the location of potential releases from historical processes conducted at that parcel and sufficient additional sampling locations to provide coverage of the entire parcel. EPA and MDE have approved Phase II workplans for all parcels at the site, except B10 and B12. In addition to the Phase II Work Plans, the Agencies review and approve targeted soil and groundwater sampling plans if results from the initial investigations warrant further work. These plans are submitted as necessary and vary in scope and focus (e.g., delineation of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) or elevated metals).\n\nPhase II Investigation Reports\n\nUpon approval of the Phase II Work Plan, field work can begin at the parcel. Once the field work is completed and the data is validated, an Investigation Report summarizing the sampling results is submitted for the Agencies for review. The only Parcels that remain for a Phase II Investigation and/or Report are B10 and B12.\n\nFinal Remedy Selection\n\nOnce field work is complete, EPA issues a Statement of Basis in which it described information gathered during environmental investigations and proposes a remedy. A final remedy is selected after the public has had the opportunity to make comments during the public comment period. EPA has a remedy for the following parcels:\n\nA1\n\nA2\n\nA3\n\nB3\n\nB4-1\n\nB4 Remnant Area\n\nB15\n\nB16 (Tin Mill Canal)\n\nResponse and Development Work Plans\n\nThis process ensures that redevelopment occurs in a way that protects human health and the environment. The Agencies have approved numerous Response and Development Work Plans (RDWPs) to date. The following RDWPs are scheduled to be submitted to the Agencies for review this year:\n\nB13-2\n\nContainer Terminal Area\n\nB8-1\n\nOther Updates\n\nTin Mill Canal\n\nRemedy Implementation of the Tin Mill Canal (TMC) was completed in February 2021. The TMC is a constructed swale that currently serves as a conveyance for stormwater runoff and groundwater base flow from an approximately 800-acre local drainage area on the Sparrows Point site and stormwater runoff from an approximately 320-acre off-site residential area. The cleanup effort generally included removal and dewatering of sediment, cleaning of outfalls, disposal of non-hazardous sediments at Grey’s Landfill, and placement of a cap.\n\nCorrective Measure Study – Rod & Wire Mill, Coke Point, and Site-Wide Groundwater\n\nThe Agencies anticipate receiving the Site-Wide Groundwater Corrective Measures Study (CMS) in July 2024 and the Coke Point Area Groundwater CMS in August 2024. The CMS for Ride & Wire Mill Groundwater will be submitted after approval of the Site-Wide and Coke Point Area Groundwater CMSs.\n\nEPA anticipates issuing a Statement of Basis detailing a proposed remedy for the site-wide groundwater outside of the Coke Point and Rod and Wire Mill areas after approval of the CMS. The Interim Measures for Rod and Wire Mill and the Coke Oven Areas will continue to operate during the Corrective Measures Studies that are being conducted to evaluate remedial alternatives and develop a recommended final remedy for groundwater.\n\nOffshore\n\nThe Offshore in comprised of three (3) areas: Bear Creek Sediment, Offshore Coke point, and Eastern Shore. On September 9 , 2021 , EPA proposed the Bear Creek Sediments to the National Priorities List, a list of the sites eligible for long-term cleanup financed under the federal Superfund Program. On March 16, 2022, EPA added the Bear Creek sediments site to the National Priorities List. EPA is proposing a Removal Action to address the hazardous substances (including PCBs and metals), oil, and grease found in the contaminated sediment of the Bear Creek Superfund Site.\n\nEPA presented its Preferred Alternative: Alternative #4- Capping with Partial Sediment Removal and Offsite Disposal in the Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA) for public comment. After the close of the public comment period, EPA will consider all comments received, consult with MDE, and as appropriate, move forward with a cleanup plan, which will be documented in the EE/CA Action Memorandum. Additional information can be found on The Superfund Program Bear Creek Sediments Site.\n\nSite Description\n\nInteractive Map of Sparrows Point Site, Sparrows Point, Maryland\n\nView larger map\n\nThe Sparrows Point facility is located on approximately 3,100 acres of a peninsula on the north side of the Patapsco River approximately nine (9) miles southeast of downtown Baltimore. From the late 1800s until 2012, the Site was used for the production and manufacturing of steel. Iron and steel production operations and processes included raw material handling, coke production, sinter production, iron production, steel production, and semi-finished and finished product preparation. In 1970, Sparrows Point was the largest steel facility in the United States, producing hot and cold rolled sheets, coated materials, pipes, plates, and rod and wire. The steelmaking operations at the facility ceased in fall 2012, and the vast majority of the structures have been demolished / removed / scraped. Current plans for the Site include redevelopment over the next several years. Some portions of the Site have already undergone remediation and/or redevelopment.\n\nContaminants at this Facility\n\nA broad range of contaminants were detected at the Site associated with the steel making process. Contaminants include: antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, tin, zinc, ammonia, benzene, cyanide, ethyl benzene, naphthalene, PAHs, toluene, xylene, coal tar, oils, lime sludge, sulfuric acid, waste alkaline rinses, mill scale, and ship yard wastes\n\nInstitutional and Engineering Controls at this Facility\n\nThe need for Institutional Controls is yet to be determined.\n\nLand Reuse Information at this Facility\n\nThe facility is being redeveloped.\n\nSite Responsibility at this Facility\n\nRCRA Corrective Action activities at this facility are being conducted under the direction of the EPA Region 3 with assistance from Maryland Department of Environmental Protection."
