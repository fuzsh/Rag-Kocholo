HADDON, OF MONTANA, TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA; AND EILEEN J. O'CONNOR, OF MARYLAND, TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE TAX DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ---------- WEDNESDAY, JULY 11, 2001 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, D.C. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:05 p.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Leahy, Cantwell, and Edwards. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Chairman Leahy. I do want to welcome Judge Gregory and Judge Cebull and Mr. Haddon and Ms. O'Connor and their families and friends. Just so you know, we are starting this hearing without my good friend from Utah, the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, because he is at a swearing-in at the Justice Department. He wanted us to be able to go ahead because we never know with the Senate schedule whether we will finish. Obviously any questions that he has, there will be time for any other Senators. We set this hearing, as many of you know, after the Senate reorganized. We wanted to start nomination hearings as soon as possible, so I noticed this hearing 10 minutes after we reorganized the Senate. Only yesterday Committee assignments were completed, so now the Committee can proceed with nomination hearings. Judge Gregory is here, of course, for the Fourth Circuit, and I will speak more about that. But knowing also that all my colleagues have remarkable schedules of their own, I see the senior Senator from Virginia, my old friend, John Warner, here; his distinguished colleague, the former Governor, now Senator, George Allen; and our friend, Congressman Robert Scott. I will call on you in that order to speak about Judge Gregory and then, of course, turn to the senior Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, and his colleague, my friend, Senator Burns, to speak on behalf of and introduce the judicial nominees from their States. [The prepared statement of Senator Leahy follows.] Statement of Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, a U.S. Senator from the State of Vermont It is my privilege to call these hearings to order. On behalf of the Committee, I welcome Judge Gregory, Judge Cebull, Mr. Haddon and Ms. O'Connor and their families and friends. This hearing was set on the schedule within 10 minutes of the reorganization of the Senate. I regret that reorganization was delayed through the entire month of June. Just yesterday afternoon, the Committee assignments were completed, and we are now in position to proceed. I know that Judge Roger Gregory, his family, and indeed, all of the people who live in the area covered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, have been waiting a long time for this day. Judge Gregory was first nominated for this position on June 30, 2000, over a year ago. He had the bipartisan support of both his home-state Senators, John Warner and Chuck Robb. Unfortunately, no hearing was scheduled on his nomination and it was returned to the President without Senate action last December. Judge Gregory's nomination is especially meaningful and historic in several ways. Last December, President Clinton named Roger Gregory the first African-American judge ever to sit on the Fourth Circuit by means of a recess appointment, and he resubmitted his nomination in January of this year. President Bush chose to withdraw Judge Gregory's nomination in March. Then on May 9, with the continued strong support of Senator Warner and Senator Allen, President Bush renominated Judge Gregory. This makes Judge Gregory on of the few nominees in our history ever to be nominated by Presidents of different parties. In addition, Judge Gregory is in the unique position of serving by means of an appointment whose term expires at the end of this session of the Senate unless his nomination to a full lifetime appointment is acted upon before that time. His life and career have been exemplary, and his qualifications for this position are stellar. His service on the bench since his appointment has been uniformly praised, and he has proven himself to be fair and collegial. Based on all of these considerations, it seems appropriate that Judge Gregory's nomination be the first considered by the Senate this year. The two nominees to the District Court for Montana both appear qualified and well respected. United States Magistrate Judge Richard Cebull and Attorney Sam Haddon are both strongly supported by their home-state Senators, Max Baucus and Conrad Burns. I have heard from both of them about their enthusiasm for these nominations. I know that Chief Judge Donald Molloy of the Montana District Court will be glad to see them. Judge Molloy is the only active District Judge serving full time in Montana and is anxious to get some help. I thank Judge Molloy for all of his good and hard work, and I am hopeful that we will be able to send him some assistance shortly. Our final nominee of the afternoon, Eileen O'Connor, is nominated to serve at the Department of Justice as Assistant Attorney General for the Tax Division. This is one of the nominations the Attorney General feels is very important to have considered promptly. So, Senator Warner, it is good to have you here, sir. PRESENTATION OF ROGER L. GREGORY, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT BY HON. JOHN W. WARNER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will submit for the record basically my statement because that will enable you to proceed expeditiously. And we have a number of colleagues and distinguished nominees, and, of course, Judge Gregory now sitting as a circuit court judge. I remember very well, Mr. Chairman, when his name came to the United States Senate. I had not known of this gentleman directly, and shortly after he was nominated, I quickly made arrangements to meet him. And that was a meeting at which time we established a close professional bond and friendship, and I have stood by his side ever since through a rather challenging and unusual process of confirmation. Nevertheless, we are here today for the purpose of culminating that process, and I am confident that this Committee and, indeed, the Senate as a whole will respect the President's wishes and that this confirmation of a sitting circuit judge will be done. And I say that with all due respect to colleagues and the process itself. As I say, I will put this into the record. My colleague Senator Allen, and I am privileged to be here with Congressman Scott. We stand united behind this distinguished nominee. And I would also say in fairness, as we do in the Senate, that my former colleague, Senator Robb, was very instrumental in seeing that this nomination came forward. I also wish to acknowledge the efforts of Elaine Jones, Legal Defense Fund for the NAACP, and Dr. Frank Royal. Dr. Frank Royal is a family physician. He and I have been associated as personal friends for many, many years--as a matter of fact, throughout my career in the Senate. And he came to me early on. He happened to be the family practitioner that serves the Gregory family, and I want to acknowledge his valuable contribution to my efforts and that of others to see that this nomination came forward. And, lastly, our former Governor of Virginia, Governor Douglas Wilder, who addressed a letter to me, my colleague Senator Allen, and Congressman Scott, and I would like to read that into the record. Chairman Leahy. Please. Senator Warner. ``Gentlemen: I first want to thank you for the strong and unwavering support relative to the nomination of Roger L. Gregory for a position on the United States Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. It has been invaluable in the process. ``I also want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, for scheduling the hearing, as well as former chairman, Senator Hatch, for the courtesies extended the nominee. I also commend Senator Charles S. Robb for starting the process by recommending Judge Gregory to President Bill Clinton for the bench. Needless to say, there are a number of persons who have played a pivotal role in bringing the nomination to this point, but none more outstanding the record of the nominee himself. I have long felt confident that once a hearing was in place, others would more widely see the sterling qualification of the individual. ``I regret very much that due to a previously scheduled vacation starting last Saturday I will not be in the country to witness and attest to this regard.'' The three of us invited him to join us today. ``I have known the judge since his college days at Virginia State University through the present. I have known him as a student, a law partner, and a friend. I know that he enjoys a splendid reputation with bench and bar, as well as being an integral part of the community at State and local events. His devotion to family and civic responsibilities is outstanding, and his character is beyond reproach. Impartiality, integrity, and resourcefulness will guide him in his decision making. I am confident he will make a very lasting contribution in his State and country.'' And, again, my very thanks to each of you for endeavoring to make this happen. I thank you. Chairman Leahy. Thank you, Senator Warner. Senator Allen? PRESENTATION OF ROGER L. GREGORY, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT BY HON. GEORGE ALLEN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA Senator Allen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having this hearing. And I very much appreciate the opportunity to appear before this Committee and you with my good colleague, Senator Warner, and my good friend and colleague, I suppose, on the other side of the Capitol, Bobby Scott. And we are all here united and honored and pleased to introduce Judge Roger Gregory to you and to your committee. It is my belief that in Roger Gregory the Fourth Circuit and, indeed, all of the United States will have somebody who obviously has a background. Governor Wilder's statements speak for themselves, and I endorse those and concur. But he is a person who will serve with integrity and dignity. He is also here, though, with his family. You have mentioned his family. His wife, Carla, is here, and his children, Adriene, Rachel, and Christina. If you all would stand up. I know you care a great deal about your family. It is good to have you all here. In my judgment, not only does he have a wonderful family, a great record, which I am going to share with you a little bit about, but what matters is judicial philosophy. And I think from my interviews and discussions with Judge Gregory, he understands the importance of adherence to duly adopted laws and respect for the Constitution. But I would like to share with you some of the things that may be missed in some of the statements from even Governor Wilder, who he was a law partner with, because I think Judge Gregory is an embodiment and a testament to what people can do in America with hard work and personal determination. Judge Gregory is the first person in his family to finish high school. He went on to graduate summa cum laude from Virginia State University, a university where his mother once had worked as a maid. He received his juris doctor degree, his law degree, from the University of Michigan and later taught at Virginia State University as an adjunct professor. That is a wonderful story of success. Before being a judge, his investiture as a judge, he was a founding partner of the firm of Wilder and Gregory. He was a highly respected litigator, representing many corporate and municipal clients in his hometown area of Richmond, Virginia. He has been active in many civic and community affairs. He and I both served together on the Board of the Historic Riverfront Foundation in Richmond. He has served for many years on the Board of Directors of the Christian Children's Fund, the Richmond Renaissance Foundation, and the Black History Museum, among others. In 1983, Commonwealth magazine named Roger Gregory one of Virginia's top 25 best and brightest. In 1997, he was the recipient of the National Conference of Christians and Jews Award. He has an AV rating in Martindale-Hubbell, which is the highest combined legal ability and general recommendation rating given to lawyers. He has been a leader of the Old Dominion Bar Association, having served as president from 1990 to 1992. And I am truly impressed and comfortable with his philosophy of what the proper role of a judge should be. He understands, in my judgment, that the judicial branch is not the legislative branch. I think he is one, in talking with him, that judges should not be results-oriented but law is a process, and judicial activism can be--an activist court can be very dangerous. But he also had a respect and I think does have a respect for duly adopted laws by elected legislatures and elected Congresses as well, and that is very important. I am very happy that we are at this stage, because throughout these processes and some of the aggravations and annoyances, not necessarily for your part, Mr. Chairman, but from folks who are in my party, through it all I also want to commend President Bush for listening to Senator Warner and myself and also for all the members of this Committee who are going to put the character and the quality and the competence of this man, Roger Gregory, ahead of any personal piques or aggravations with process. I think that the Senate soon will be acting as statesmen, and I feel, Mr. Chairman, that you and your fellow members of your committee, once you have had an opportunity to closely focus on Roger Gregory's record and then also ask him questions, you will be as impressed as Senator Warner, myself, and Congressman Scott are and will be very pleased to nominate him for a lifetime appointment to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having this prompt hearing. Chairman Leahy. I thank you, too, Senator Allen. I should note that we have had these kinds of questions about blue slips or no blue slips. Both you and Senator Warner made very strong public statements in support of Judge Gregory, and under our new rules I can say this also reflects what was in your private correspondence with this committee, strong words of support. I well remember Senator Warner coming to me early on in this process, and he said that we are going to work this out, Senator Allen and I will be together on this, and if you will just give us some space, we will work it out. Senator Warner being an extremely effective Senator, and I am sure you have had, Senator, the same thing with him, and in all the years we have served together, he has always kept his word. He has always maintained his word. And he has always followed through on his commitments. John, if I might make a personal comment, this is just one more time that you did that, and you are absolutely right in the fact that you and Senator Allen were so straightforward with the new President. Had you not been, we probably would not be at this point. I commend and compliment both of you for that. Senator Allen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Warner. Mr. Chairman, that is a rare moment in a career of 23 years in this institution, but I assure you, the three individuals appearing here on his behalf were the Three Musketeers from day one. [Laughter.] Chairman Leahy. I understand, and I was not going to ignore the other side of the Capitol. I know both of you have to leave for other Committee meetings. Feel free to go any time you want. Congressman Scott, you and I have had a number of discussions about this nominee. You have been unfailingly consistent in your support of him, and you and I have a long and personal relationship of working together on significant issues. Again, I stand behind no one in my admiration of you and your abilities, and so I yield to you, sir. PRESENTATION OF ROGER L. GREGORY, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT BY HON. ROBERT C. SCOTT, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA Representative Scott. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is certainly a pleasure to appear before you, and it is an honor and a pleasure for me to join my two Virginia Senators in introducing Judge Roger Gregory to the committee. Judge Gregory is from Richmond, Virginia, part of which is in the 3rd Congressional District, which I represent, and his nomination to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals is a source of pride for all Virginians. I have known the judge for over 20 years. He is a stellar professional. He has stellar professional and legal credentials. He is a summa cum laude graduate of Virginia State University and a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School. After practicing law with two large firms, he became the founding member and managing partner of the law firm of Wilder and Gregory in Richmond. He is a truly consensus candidate for a permanent appointment to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. He has bipartisan support from the congressional delegation, the Governor, and other political leaders from Virginia. He also has the support of many organizations and individuals from Virginia and beyond. As a judge sitting on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals for the past several months, he has earned the respect of his colleagues on the bench. I hope you will give Judge Gregory's nomination strong consideration. I believe that if he is confirmed, he will be a fine permanent addition to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Congressman Scott, thank you for taking the time to come over. As I said, I knew of your strong support before, and I am delighted to have it reiterated here. Now, in Montana, I know Chief Judge Donald Molloy has been very worried because he has been somewhat home alone. He is the only United States District Judge serving full-time in Montana, and resolved we are going to be bringing up Richard Cebull and Attorney Sam Haddon this afternoon. Now, this is not just because I want to help out Chief Judge Donald Molloy, but I cannot walk in the doors of either the Republican or Democratic side of the Senate without being cornered by either Senator Baucus or Senator Burns saying, ``Where are our judges?'' So here we go. You are going to have the first two district judge nominees this year before you. Senator Baucus, we will start with you as the senior Senator from Montana, and then go to Senator Burns. PRESENTATION OF RICHARD F. CEBULL AND SAM E. HADDON, NOMINEES TO BE DISTRICT JUDGES FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA BY HON. MAX BAUCUS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MONTANA Senator Baucus. Well, thank you very, very much, Mr. Chairman. You are correct in capturing the urgency of this matter. We begin, Senator Burns and I, on behalf of Sam Haddon and Rick Cebull in thanking you very, very much and thanking the Committee for holding this hearing in a very expeditious fashion. We have been in a tough spot in Montana the last few months. As you undoubtedly know, currently only one of our three judgeships is filled, one out of three, and that has placed an enormous strain on our remaining judge, Don Molloy. You have alluded to that. And we are here just to restate how difficult it has been for Judge Molloy. He has traveled day and night throughout Montana doing his duty as one of the Federal judges of Montana, but filling in for two others. We are on the brink of a judicial crisis, and we again thank you. To fill these positions, to ensure that we maintain in Montana swift and certain justice, we thank you again for holding these hearings so we can have all three of our judgeships filled. We are very grateful for it. Second, I am very grateful to my colleague, Senator Burns. He and I are working together in recommending both Richard Cebull and Sam Haddon. I might say that this is a bit unique. It is not too often that two Senators from different political parties are working so closely together, but we are doing so because it is the right thing to do. And I very much thank Senator Burns for even asking me if I want to participate in this process, something he did not have to do, but something that he thought was right for Montana. And I commend him for doing it. Chairman Leahy. If the Senator would yield on that point, I wish more States where you have Senators of opposite parties would do the same thing. It would certainly make my life a lot, lot easier. Senator Baucus. Well, we aim to please, Mr. Chairman, whatever you wish. Richard Cebull has served as a Billings attorney for close to 30 years, Mr. Chairman, specializing in medical malpractice. And since 1998, he has been the U.S. magistrate in Great Falls, Montana. I know he is eager to get back to Billings and fill the shoes of Judge Jack Shanstrom, who has recently retired. Rick is a Montana native. He was born and raised in Roundup, Montana, and has earned the respect of our State, and I am very proud to introduce him and recommend him to you today. Sam Haddon graduated from the University of Montana Law School in 1965 after serving with the U.S. Border Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in the late 1950s and 1960s. He has worked very hard. He has been in private practice in Billings, Montana, and Missoula and is currently a partner with Boone, Karlberg and Haddon, one of the more respected firms in our State. I know that the opportunity to serve as a Federal district judge is a goal that Sam has strived towards for years. This is a culmination of a wonderful dream for him, and in that respect, in addition to his qualifications, I know he will be a first-class judge. And as the first member of his family to go to college, this is certainly an accomplishment for him and for his family to be very proud of. I know both Rick and Sam personally. We in Montana tend to know each other, or if we do not, we tend to know each other at least by reputation. We know a lot about each other. They will be an excellent addition to the Federal bench, and I give them my highest recommendation. I might say, Mr. Chairman, that we are here today witnessing a procedure under one of the most durable agreements that people have put together freely in constituting how they govern themselves, that is, our United States Constitution. Sometimes I think we do not reflect enough on the genius of our Founding Fathers in writing this document, particularly a Constitution with three separate, co-equal branches of Government. And it is unique here today that we are seeing the three branches come together, that is, the President, the executive branch, has nominated two people from our State of Montana to be on the Federal bench, to participate in the judicial branch, and here we are in the legislative branch giving our advice and consent. It is a wonderful document. It is a wonderful procedure. And I know that both Rick and Sam will not only dispense justice fairly in Montana, but they are two people who have a deep respect and reverence for the special quality of our Constitution, and, in particular, a high regard for the third branch of Government, the Federal judiciary. I think it is important for us to remember, too, Mr. Chairman, that the most distinguishing factor that determines whether a country is durable or viable is whether it has an independent judiciary. We in America do. It is something that we should remember and be very proud of and continue to keep thriving and alive. Rick Cebull and Sam Haddon are certainly two people who will help maintain that tradition and that very important part of America. And so it is for all those reasons I recommend them very highly. [The prepared statement of Senator Baucus follows.] Statement of Hon. Max Baucus, a U.S. Senator from the State of Montana, on the Nomination of Richard Cebull and Sam Haddon Good Afternoon. I'd like to begin by sincerely thanking the Senate Judiciary Committee for taking up the federal district court judgeship nominations for Montana today. We've been in a tough spot over the last few months. Currently, only one of three of our judgeships is filled, which is placing an enormous strain on our remaining judge, Donald Molloy. We're on the brink of a judicial crisis. To ensure that we maintain swift and certain justice, Montana must have all three federal judgeships filled as soon as possible. The nominations of Richard Cebull and Sam Haddon are among the first the Committee is considering and all of us in Montana are very grateful. Senator Conrad Burns and I were happy to join together in recommending Richard Cebull and Sam Haddon to President Bush last February. Conrad and I have continued to work together and do everything possible to more the nomination process along as quickly as possible. Both men are deserving of our support and will fill the federal district judgeship positions admirably. Richard Cebull served as a Billings attorney for close to 30 years specializing in medical malpractice work. Since 1998, he's been the U.S. magistrate in Great Falls. I know he's eager to move back to Billings and to fill the shoes of Judge Jack Shanstrom is on senior status. Rick is a Montana native, born and raised in Roundup, and has earned the respect of our state. I'm proud to introduce and recommend him to you today. Sam Haddon graduated from the University of Montana Law School in 1965 after serving with the U.S. Border Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He's worked in private practice in Billings and Missoula and is currently a partner with Boone, Karlberg and Haddon. I know that the opportunity to serve as a federal district judge is a goal Sam has strived towards for years. As the first member of his family to go to college, this is certainly an accomplishment to be proud of. I've had the chance to meet and talk with both Rick and Sam and know the type of work they do. They will be an excellent addition to the bench and I give you my highest recommendation for them today. I'd like to thank the Committee again for holding this hearing today and urge you to continue to move the process forward as quickly as possible. Thank you. Chairman Leahy. Thank you very much, and I agree with you. No democracy can exist without an independent judiciary. Senator, and my good friend, Senator Burns, who again can now leave me alone, we are having the hearing. I am delighted to have you here. More importantly, Mrs. Burns is here. You, like many of us, Senator Burns, married way above yourself. [Laughter.] Chairman Leahy. But we are delighted to have both of you here. As you have often said to me. PRESENTATION OF RICHARD F. CEBULL AND SAM E. HADDON, NOMINEES TO BE DISTRICT JUDGES FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA BY HON. CONRAD BURNS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MONTANA Senator Burns. As you know, Mr. Chairman, there are a lot of us in that same category. [Laughter.] Senator Burns. I will not pick them out today. I am spending your money today. We have Interior Appropriations on the floor and a vote coming up soon, so I will make this kind of quick. I have a letter from the Honorable Don Molloy and his appeal to this Committee to act responsibly and quickly about these nominations and I will make that part of the record. Mr. Chairman, we do have a crisis in Montana. We have now only Judge Molloy as an Article III Judge. If he would just go on for the rest of the year without help, he would handle around 1,200 cases. We do not even work mules that hard. But he has done an admirable job. In fact, he has almost reached the point where he is contemplating emergency procedures in Montana, including the suspension of the Speedy Trial Act, if he does not receive some much needed assistance. I have attached a copy of his letter and want to make it part of the record. Mr. Chairman, when we looked at this situation, it did not take Senator Baucus and I very long to recognize that we did have this crisis, that we had to come up with men of great integrity and someone we could agree on very quickly and move them through the process. And I appreciate Senator Baucus and his efforts and attitude toward this. We worked together very well on this, and I think we have two of Montana's finest. President Bush made Sam Haddon and Richard Cebull his first district court judge nominees and did so on an expedited basis. I am hopeful that Sam and Richard will also be the first district court judges confirmed by this Committee and by the entire Senate. Finally, Mr. Chairman and members of this committee, I want to say a few words about the nominees before you today. I have known Sam Haddon and Richard Cebull for many years. Richard comes from Roundup, Montana, where another famous Montanan made his mark in the Gulf War, General Paul Funk, who commanded the armored division in that operation. So Ric understands and we understand public service. I think you will agree that their respective resumes speak for themselves. Their colleagues have rated them the highest ratings possible. The American Bar Association has given them the highest rating, and done so unanimously. And, finally, between them they have over a half- century of experience in law. But all of these ratings and accomplishments may not tell the entire story. The rest of the story is that Sam Haddon and Richard Cebull are of the kind of character that makes anybody who lives in the State of Montana very, very proud and me very honored to present them to you today. We have heard a lot of things said about Sam and Ric, but one that really matters today is that their hand shake is their word; there are some folks that you would rather have their handshake than a contract. And you are looking at two of those men today. Their integrity is without question. They are fair, decent, and honest men who bring respect and professionalism to the Federal judiciary. Most importantly, I know that Sam and Richard will never forget, when they sit on the bench, that they were appointed and not anointed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and the members of this committee. I look forward to working with you to expedite the confirmation of these two men as our next judges in the court judges of Montana. Chairman Leahy. Well, thank you very much, and also please let Judge Molloy know that help is on the way. You hear the trumpets coming across the mountains. Help will be on the way thanks to both you and Senator Baucus. Senator Baucus. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I must tell you that the jungle drums in the Federal bench are the best I have ever seen. Judge Molloy knows everything that is happening. Chairman Leahy. I will bet he does. He will know ahead of us. Thank you very much. I know both of you have to go to the floor, and I appreciate your coming being here. Senator Burns. Thank you. Senator Baucus. Thank you. Chairman Leahy. I do not want anybody to think that I am forgetting my good friend, Congresswoman Morella, of Maryland. Congresswoman Morella and I have been friends for a long, long time. I know she is here to speak for Eileen O'Connor, who is nominated to be Assistant Attorney General for the Tax Division. While Ms. O'Connor and I both have Irish names, Ms. Morella knows the real secret of my ancestry. And so, Congresswoman, I am delighted to have you here. Please feel free to proceed. PRESENTATION OF EILEEN J. O'CONNOR, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE TAX DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BY HON. CONSTANCE A. MORELLA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND Representative Morella. Thank you very much. Thank you, Chairman Leahy. And I will let the world know that you are part of the Italian-American Congressional Caucus. We are very proud of that, too. I want to thank you very much for the opportunity to allow me to introduce a very distinguished constituent of mine, Eileen J. O'Connor, nominated by President Bush to serve as Assistant Attorney General of the Tax Division of the Department of Justice. I note--and you will agree, I trust--that Eileen O'Connor's career, both public and private, is impressive. Her ability to represent the interests of the United States Government is unquestionable. Just to point out a few of the items from Eileen's distinguished career, she is a graduate of Columbus State University and Catholic University of America's Columbus School of Law. Professionally, her career has been highlighted with positions as corporate tax law specialist with the Internal Revenue Service, tax manager with Arthur Andersen, senior manager and associate partner at Grant Thornton, and the Office of Federal Tax Services, an officer for tax services with Aronson, Fetridge and Weigle. Most recently, Mrs. O'Connor serves as counselor to the Attorney General. Academically, Mrs. O'Connor has served as adjunct professor at both Georgetown University Law Center and George Mason University School of Law. She also serves on the editorial board of the Tax Advisor, a monthly tax journal. Additionally, she holds memberships with the Federal Bar Association, the Bar Association of the District of Columbia, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Federalist Society, and the American Bar Association. So her professional associations and memberships are pretty impressive and extensive. As a respected national tax expert, Eileen O'Connor has authored numerous articles and publications. She has made presentations at many conferences and seminars, focusing on a broad scope of tax issues, such as limited liability companies, women and tax, tax accounting, practitioner-client confidentiality, tax reform, and, last but not least, how to cope with an IRS tax audit. When Eileen is not sifting through the Tax Code and fulfilling the demands of a wife and mother, she works with many committees seeking to improve the tax profession and the tax system. She donates time to her church, and of particular interest, Eileen has drafted a booklet devoted to helping women better understand the Federal income tax system. That is probably something that men could well gain from, also, since we contribute to making this tax system one that does require experts to help them understand it and weave their way through the travails. I believe that after examining the credentials of Eileen O'Connor, you will agree that her education and as an educator, her experience both in the public and the private sector, her proven ability and commitment and her integrity render her worthy of your confirmation. And, you know, I noted also that some time ago I had the honor of introducing her husband, Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, and I was reminded of the fact that behind every successful man is a surprised mother-in- law. Behind every successful woman is a mother-in-law who knew it all the time, and a very proud family. And so I would say, as you consider recommending Eileen O'Connor as Assistant Attorney General for the Tax Division, that in the words of Shakespeare, the force of her own merit makes her way. Thank you, sir. Chairman Leahy. Thank you very much, Congresswoman. As always, it is good to have you here. I also know that you have a very busy schedule on the other side of the Capitol, so please feel free to leave. Representative Morella. Thank you. Chairman Leahy. I am going to ask the staff if they would just clean up the bench here just a little bit, and then we will call Judge Gregory. And I am going to take one minute to respond to one phone call out here. So we will recess for just one minute, and it will literally be one minute. [Recess at 2:37 to 2:39 p.m.] Chairman Leahy. I would note that last December President Clinton named Roger Gregory to be the first African-American judge ever to sit on the Fourth Circuit by means of a recess appointment. He resubmitted his nomination January of this year. President Bush originally had withdrawn Judge Gregory's nomination, but then with the continued strong support of Senator Warner and Senator Allen, the same support that Senator Warner and Senator Robb had shown earlier, the President renominated Judge Gregory. This makes the judge one of the few nominees in our history ever to be nominated by Presidents of different parties for the same judgeship. He is in the unique position of serving by means of an appointment whose term would expire at the end of this session of the Senate unless we acted on it before then, which we will. His life and career have been exemplary. His qualifications for the position are stellar. His service on the bench since his appointment has been uniformly praised. He has proven himself to be fair and collegial. And based on all these considerations, I think it is appropriate that Judge Gregory's nomination will be the first one to the Federal judiciary considered by the Senate this year. Judge Gregory, please come forward, sir, and take--oh, first, introduce your family, please, Judge. I want to make sure their names are in the record. Judge Gregory. Thank you very much. I will introduce my wife, Carla, of 21 years, and my three lovely daughters, Adriene, Rachel, and Christina, and my sister-in-law, Merley Lewis is present. I also have a chamber family here: my secretary/administrative assistant, can't do anything without her, Tammie Hicks; and my three clerks, who have just been wonderful, Maya Eckstein, Gretchen Speidel, and Damon Jones. Chairman Leahy. Why don't you all stand up so we can all see you here. Thank you all for being here, and please take a seat. Judge Gregory, please take a seat. I want to make sure their names--you will be a little bit a part of history because you will be in the record. And also, we have our newest member of the committee, Senator Edwards, who has joined us. Senator Edwards is also, as you know, in the Fourth Circuit, and Senator Edwards spoke eloquently and often on your behalf last year, Judge Gregory. And this year one of the very first things he said to me when we came back in January, he said, ``What are we going to do to get Judge Gregory confirmed?'' So I am pleased to have him here. Judge if you would stand and raise your right hand, please. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before this Committee shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Judge Gregory. I do. Chairman Leahy. Judge, this is your day. Feel free to start with any statement you might have before we begin with questions. STATEMENT OF ROGER L. GREGORY, OF VIRGINIA, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT Judge Gregory. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, first and foremost, I would like to thank you for scheduling this hearing. It is indeed an honor to be considered by this Committee to consider my nomination. I consider it to be one of the highest points of my life. You have met my family, and for the record I would like to put in the names of my late parents, George and Fannie Gregory. Without their unwavering support and their love, this day would not be possible, and I certainly want to recognize them. Also, for the record, we would like to thank Senator John Warner and Senator Allen and Congressman Scott for appearing here and speaking so generously about me and their unwavering support through this process. I thank them very much with their busy schedules to be here today, as well as to recognize former Governor Wilder, whose letter was in the record. His unwavering support and friendship have been wonderful. I thank you. That is all I have for an opening statement or I will begin to reiterate. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for scheduling this hearing. I am very pleased to be here to answer your questions. [The biographical information of Judge Gregory follows.] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.002 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.003 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.008 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.010 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.011 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.012 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.013 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.014 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.015 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.016 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.017 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.018 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.019 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.020 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.021 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.022 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.023 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.024 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.025 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.026 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.027 Chairman Leahy. Well, I thank you very much. I was also pleased with what you said when you mentioned your parents. I was fortunate my parents were still with us when I was sworn in the first couple times in office, and the only two reprints I have of the Congressional Record in my office are the eulogies I gave both of them on the Senate floor. And, like you, I have always felt that whatever I accomplished, it never would have happened without their initial upbringing. Judge let's go into a question that really gets asked of everybody but we need to ask, and that is the question of stare decisis. How do you see stare decisis? Who do you see it binding? And to what extent must it bind all courts at all levels? Judge Gregory. Well, first, stare decisis gives the consistency and the stability in our law, particularly in our constitutional law. And if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed by this Committee and by the Senate, I will follow it and I will consider it, and not only just a task, but it is a duty and a charge that I should follow the precedent of the constitutional rule of law and the precedents set down by the Supreme Court and the precedent of the Fourth Circuit. So I consider as a judge I am bound by that, and as an intermediate appellate court, those are my marching orders, if you will, the rule of law and the precedents set down by the Supreme Court, and I follow that. Chairman Leahy. Well, suppose you have a case where you have a Supreme Court precedent, and you look at it and you do not personally agree with it, but it is a Supreme Court precedent. I am not talking about the Fourth Circuit or any other circuit, but a Supreme Court precedent and you do not agree with it. Do you have to follow it? Judge Gregory. I have to follow it and I will follow it. Chairman Leahy. A more difficult course is when you have to do a statutory interpretation. How do you determine--I mean, I suppose you have a case of first impression, but it involves basically interpretation of a statute. How do you determine congressional intent? Because sometimes our statutes up here are drawn just because of the nature of going through the legislative process of compromise and all, and it may not be quite as clear as you or other judges might like. Do you go into legislative history? How do you determine that? Judge Gregory. Well, first of all, Mr. Chairman, in the rare case that it really is a case of first impression, I think the first response is to my clerks: Go back and look again. Are you sure? Because it is rare. But if, in fact, it is a case of first impression and there is no precedent, I would look for analogous precedent, other cases that speak to guidance in that regard. So I would look for analogous law. And if it is statutory law, I follow the plain language, because Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution says all legislative powers granted herein is in the Congress. Therefore, it is not to make the law. So, therefore, I would look to analogous precedent and the letter of Congress, because I believe what Congress meant, Congress said in the statute. So that is what I would do, analogous precedent and look at the plain language of the statute or the Constitution itself if it is an constitutional question. Chairman Leahy. I agree with you that an issue of first impression is probably not too apt to happen, but it is more apt to happen if we pass something really controversial and your circuit is the lucky one that gets the first test case on it. Senator Edwards? Senator Edwards. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, I look forward very much to serving on this Committee and working with the chairman and the ranking member, this Committee that does so much important work. Judge Gregory, I appreciate your introducing all your family members and your law clerks, and I particularly appreciate your reference to your parents. I know they were proud of you. I know they would be very proud of you if they were here today. And I want to tell you that I have spoken to many lawyers and judges who know you well, and not just recently but also in the past when you were originally under consideration by the President. And you are held in uniform high regard with every single lawyer, every single judge that I spoke to about you. And you are well respected, hard-working, knowledgeable in the law, somebody who, as you said a moment earlier, does not make law but applies the law in a very fair, evenhanded fashion. I heard the same thing from every single person I talked to about you. No one could have come to this Committee with higher marks than you, I can tell you that. And it goes without saying that both your Senators have shown up and Congressman Scott also showed up to speak on your behalf. So we are proud to have you here. I also might add from my perspective, and I hope the perspective of many others, that this is a historic moment. And your confirmation, which I am satisfied will occur, will also be a historic moment. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that serves your State and my State has, I think, the largest African-American population of any circuit court in the country, and it is such a positive thing in our Nation's history that we now have a well-qualified, well-respected African-American judge sitting on the Fourth Circuit. So I think it is an important moment for you, an important moment for your family, but I also think it is an important moment for our country. I cannot tell you how pleased I am. I was pleased when the President did the recess appointment of you. I am pleased that you have been renominated by President Bush, and I congratulate him for doing that and having the wisdom and good judgment to do it. And I know you are going to serve this court and the people of this circuit, not just your State but all of the States of the circuit, well. I can tell you without qualification I will feel very good about any of my 8 million people in the State of North Carolina who appear before you on any matter that they have in that court. So we are very pleased, very, very pleased to have you here, and I think it is an important moment for you, for your family, and also for the country. I also want to add just for my colleagues' benefit that we have had some difficulty over the past several years in getting judges from the State of North Carolina a hearing and confirmation votes on the floor of the Senate for the Fourth Circuit. As a result, our State, which--as much as I love Virginia, our State, which is the largest State in the circuit, has no representation on the court. And I have been having constructive conversations with the White House about working together to find a way to fill those vacancies. As recently as yesterday, I had a conversation with the White House Counsel about that issue. I will continue to talk with them. We want very much for our State to be represented on the Fourth Circuit and to be represented with the kind of quality that you bring to the bench. Hopefully we will be able to get some folks from North Carolina nominated that will be able to serve alongside you and provide you with the support and help that you need. And I feel optimistic about that based on the conversations that we have had. But, more importantly today, I just want to congratulate you. I do not have any questions for you. I already know you are ready for this job. You have been doing it, and you are ready to go on to confirmation. We are proud for you and proud for the country. Thank you, Judge. Judge Gregory. Thank you very much, Senator Edwards. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. To continnue this tough adversarial cross-examination you are receiving, Judge, we will now go to Senator Cantwell of Washington State. Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do also want to welcome Judge Gregory here today. I am pleased that President Bush took a look at your qualifications and decided to renominate you to the Fourth Circuit. I was not here earlier, but I am glad to see that the Senators from Virginia were also here on your behalf. I do believe that it is important to have diversity on the circuit courts, not just in philosophy but in background, and I believe that you will add a lot of diversity and experience to the Fourth Circuit. So, like my colleagues, Mr. Chairman, I do not have questions for Mr. Gregory, but I very much appreciate this nomination and our ability to move forward on it quickly. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. Judge Gregory, normally with the last question, that would be the last question of this afternoon. I do, though, because of the close working relationship and friendship that Senator Hatch and I have, I know that it was an official duty that took him off the Hill connected with his former role as chairman. And I am going to ask at this point, sir, if you could step down but stay here until Senator Hatch comes back should he have further questions. Obviously, the record will stay open for a couple days for any member, but if you would not mind doing that, sir, I would ask if you might rejoin your family, and I would bring Richard Cebull up for his hearing. Judge Gregory. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would be pleased to. Chairman Leahy. Why don't we have both Mr. Haddon and Judge Cebull come on up here? Judge Cebull and Mr. Haddon, come and join us, and why don't I swear you both at the same time. Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this Committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Judge Cebull. I do. Mr. Haddon. I do. Chairman Leahy. Please be seated. Judge Cebull, you might want first to introduce your family so that we have them in the record. STATEMENT OF RICHARD F. CEBULL, OF MONTANA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA Judge Cebull. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I too married above and beyond myself, and that is fortunate. Unfortunately, she was not able to be here, but she is supporting me. Chairman Leahy. I am sure she is. Judge Cebull. Thank you, as are my children and my grandchildren. Chairman Leahy. But I wanted you to at least be able to refer to them so someday they will see that in the record, sir. Judge Cebull. All right. My son Brian and daughter Katie-- Katie lives in Denver with her children and husband, and Brian lives in Billings. And I would have had to rent a van, I think, to get them all here. But they are here. Chairman Leahy. I am glad you are here, sir. Thank you. Judge Cebull. Thank you. Chairman Leahy. Mr. Haddon? STATEMENT OF SAM E. HADDON, OF MONTANA, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA Mr. Haddon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have one person with me today, my wife Betty, who has been the cornerstone of my life for the last 42 1/2 years. Our three children--Elizabeth, Steven and Allison--and their spouses and families are occupied elsewhere, but they have all assured us that they are here in spirit. Chairman Leahy. Mr. Haddon, you were fortunate enough to marry a registered nurse, I understand. Mr. Haddon. That is correct. Chairman Leahy. Not a bad thing to do. It has worked in the Leahy family for 39 years. Mr. Haddon. It has certainly worked in our family, and one of our daughters has followed in her mother's steps and is also a nurse practitioner. Chairman Leahy. That is wonderful. Please take a seat, sir. I will start with you, Judge Cebull. In a case last year, called Lozeau v. Lake County, Montana, you ruled that inmates bringing a lawsuit to affect prison conditions under the Prison Litigation Reform Act were entitled to attorney's fees, even though the suit settled out of court rather than proceeding to judgment. This term--and it was a controversial 5-4 decision--the Supreme Court made the opposite ruling, holding that the party that has failed to secure a judgment on the merits or a court- ordered consent decree is not the prevailing party and may not receive attorney's fees. A very strong dissent in that case took basically the position you did. Your opinion tracks Judge Ginsburg's dissent in this West Virginia case, an opinion you had issued earlier. So have you changed your view of what the law requires on what it means to be a prevailing party when you petition for attorney's fees? Judge Cebull. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I followed Ninth Circuit precedent in my ruling, and I think it was back in April of 2000. And I did hold, pursuant to Ninth Circuit authority, that the prevailing party included the catalyst theory. And I am aware of that May 29, 2001, U.S. Supreme Court decision that says, no, it doesn't. Chairman Leahy. So you would take the same position that Judge Gregory took earlier that the Supreme Court gets the final word? Judge Cebull. Absolutely, and the Ninth Circuit, who is my intermediate appellate court, yes, sir. Chairman Leahy. But you must take some satisfaction in knowing a very strong dissent took the same position you did. You don't have to answer that, Judge. [Laughter.] Judge Cebull. It offers little solace. Chairman Leahy. You have had quite a bit of experience already has a factfinder and a decisionmaker. You were a trial judge in the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court. You were a settlement master. You have been a U.S. Magistrate for the last three years. Those of us who have practiced law know that we have a system that would totally collapse in the Federal court system if we didn't have the magistrates. But how do you anticipate it is going to be different sitting as an Article III judge? Judge Cebull. The main difference, Mr. Chairman, will be the volume and type of criminal cases. Now, I handle only misdemeanor, up through a Class A misdemeanor, and as an Article III judge I will be handling all of the Federal felony criminal cases in my district, if I am honored by this Committee and confirmed by the Senate. Chairman Leahy. Mr. Haddon, I look at your background and you have been in a lot of different bar activities that have improved the profession. You have been active, and I will probably leave some of these out, but the American College of Trial Lawyers, the American Academy of Appellate Lawyers, the ABA, the American Judicature Society, the American Law Institute, the American Bar Foundation. You were on an advisory commission making recommendations to your State supreme court about the standards for admission to practice in Montana. You were Chair of a commission to study and suggest revision to the State's laws of evidence. You have served on the Montana Supreme Court's Commission on Practice, which I understand has ethic complaints and others that go before that. Now, a judge, of course, has some restrictions, obviously, both time but also professionally. But would you see, though, that it would be possible also as a sitting Federal judge to still take part in appropriate bar associations or professional legal associations? Mr. Haddon. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I would, of course, be guided by whatever the constraints are that would apply to any sitting judge, but it would certainly be my hope to continue to be active, where appropriate, in matters related to the advancement of our profession. Chairman Leahy. Mr. Haddon, you have a lot of litigation experience, but I notice that it is virtually all civil. Mr. Haddon. That is correct. Chairman Leahy. And yet the criminal jurisdiction of the Federal courts expands all the time. In fact, in some places it overwhelms it almost to the extent that you can't get a civil case heard. So it would be safe to assume you are going to be handling a lot of criminal cases. Do you anticipate any difficulty in getting prepared for that type of law? Mr. Haddon. Mr. Chairman, I would not anticipate difficulty. I would certainly anticipate a challenge and an obligation to work diligently with the other judges who would be available, to take advantage of the materials that the Administrative Office of the United States Courts has available, and to, as necessary, go back to school to learn what it means to handle a significant criminal caseload. Chairman Leahy. In fact, you know, Mr. Haddon, you said something there that kind of makes me think of this. This could be the same in any profession, but in one way or another every judge can go back to school all the time. I mean, obviously when a case comes before you, you are going to have the advantage of having superb law clerks, but to read that, to go back to reeducate yourself, to take advantage of the various publications; both of you, for that matter. I have always thought in the job that I have, in some ways it is like going back to school all the time, and that is really one of the most exciting parts about it. All the best judges I know look forward to that part of it, to basically reeducate themselves on new points of law all the time. Mr. Haddon. I certainly consider it an exciting challenge. Chairman Leahy. I can imagine it will be. Senator Cantwell? Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also have questions for Mr. Haddon. You mentioned in your paperwork about pro bono work that you did representing members of the Flathead Nation. Could you elaborate on that? Mr. Haddon. Yes, Ms. Cantwell. I have not done a great deal of that. That is a relatively new program that was set up on the Flathead Reservation. I was asked to become a member of the bar of that court, and solicited by, or at least given the opportunity to make myself available to do pro bono work for the disadvantaged folks up on the reservation, and I have done that on a limited basis. I have been asked on perhaps four or five occasions to give advice to tribal members who have had difficulties at one level or another with some matter, very little court work. Most of it has been private consultations with clients. Senator Cantwell. So it was advice in four or five different cases? Mr. Haddon. Yes. Senator Cantwell. Do you believe in tribal sovereignty, Mr. Haddon? Mr. Haddon. I beg your pardon? Senator Cantwell. Do you believe in tribal sovereignty? Mr. Haddon. I'm sorry. I missed the last-- Senator Cantwell. Do you believe in tribal sovereignty? Mr. Haddon. Well, certainly the United States Supreme Court and our treaty system have recognized a substantial measure of tribal sovereignty. I believe that what the Court has said and what the treaties that have been written and are a part of our history say about the role and responsibility of tribal law and the status of Native Americans is a part of our history. It is a part of the body of law that we observe, and it is as significant in its way as any other part of our legal system. Senator Cantwell. I know that you were active in the 1970s, I believe, on behalf of the State at that time, a case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court. You represented the State of Montana in Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. That was an issue of challenging tribal immunity on, I think, an issue of State taxes maybe related to cigarettes. Mr. Haddon. That is correct. Senator Cantwell. Could you expand in your involvement? Mr. Haddon. I was asked to participate in that case as a special assistant attorney general on behalf of the State. The case was tried before a three-judge panel, a three-judge court. The basic position of the Confederated Tribe was that the State of Montana had no authority to tax the sale of cigarettes that were sold by tribal members on the reservation. The position of the State of Montana was just the opposite. The tribes also took the position that the State of Montana could not prosecute individuals who purchased such non-tax-paid cigarettes and took them off the reservation. The three-judge court ruled in favor of the tribes on the issue of taxation, ruled in favor of the State of Montana on the capacity of the State to impose its criminal laws upon individual who purchase such cigarettes and removed them from the reservation. And the United States Supreme Court, following hearing and argument, affirmed the decision of the three-judge panel. Senator Cantwell. Is that the only case that you were involved in representing the State against a tribal nation? Mr. Haddon. Yes, it is. Senator Cantwell. And that was in what capacity? Mr. Haddon. I was designated as a special assistant attorney general for the State. Senator Cantwell. Thank you. That is all the questions I have, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. Well, gentlemen, again this has been an exercise in rigorous cross-examination of both of you. I suspect you will survive. Again, I will ask you, while we call Ms. O'Connor up, for the same reason as I did for Judge Gregory if you might sit back. I hope we will wrap this up fairly soon, but if you could still stay and be available for other members of the committee. Judge Cebull. Thank you. May I thank you on behalf of us both for providing this hearing and the honor of being here. Chairman Leahy. Well, thank you very much, Judge Cebull. I appreciate that. As I said, I noticed these hearings less than 10 minutes after we finally got the Senate reorganized. I intend to move forward vigorously, as much as the Senate schedule will allow us, on these. But I also know the situation you have with Judge Molloy kind of feeling home alone. Judge Cebull. Right. Chairman Leahy. You can call him once we finish this and tell him that help is on its way. Judge Cebull. Thank you. Mr. Haddon. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you.

Ms. O'Connor, your husband is a judge and he has done this a lot, but bear with me. Would you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give before the Committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Ms. O'Connor. I do. Chairman Leahy. I would also give you an opportunity to introduce your husband. STATEMENT OF EILEEN J. O'CONNOR, OF MARYLAND, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE TAX DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Ms. O'Connor. Thank you, with pleasure. I am accompanied today by my best friend, whom I have the great good fortune to be married to, the Honorable A. Raymond Randolph, of the District of Columbia Circuit. Chairman Leahy. Judge, it is good to have you here with us. I am going to put a statement from Senator Feingold in the record. As I mentioned earlier, Senator Hatch was involved downtown on another matter that actually related to his membership and former chairmanship of this committee. That is why I have asked each of you to stand by until he might come back. Why don't you hold, Ms. O'Connor, and let me yield to Senator Hatch? STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Senator Hatch. I will put my statement in the record. Let me just congratulate all of you. I am very pleased that all of you are being put through the committee, hopefully, in the immediate future and that we have this hearing today. I want to thank Senator Leahy for moving ahead and doing this. I am very pleased with this group of nominees, and I will just tell you in advance, so don't worry about me, I will submit my questions in writing. I have looked over all of your backgrounds rather carefully. I want to compliment the President of the United States for making these excellent choices. I am pleased, Judge Gregory, to be able to get this matter resolved and am pleased to be a strong supporter of yours, as well as all the rest of you. This is a real privilege to have you all here. It is going to be a privilege for you to serve in your respective callings, and I believe that you will all act with distinction. So with that, I will just turn the time back to my chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Hatch follows.] Statement of Hon. Orrin G. Hatch, a U.S. Senator from the State of Utah Thank you, Chairman Leahy. It is both an honor and a pleasure to be here this afternoon with these extremely well-qualified nominees for the federal courts and the Department of Justice. I would like to congratulate all of the nominees for their selection by President Bush to serve in these important positions. All of you have distinguished yourselves with hard work and great intellect, and I think you will do great service to the citizens of this country upon your confirmations. Judge Gregory's legal experience, character, and good judgment make him an excellent choice for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. A graduate of Michigan Law School, he has handled just about every kind of litigation. He spent his first four years in practice at two large and prestigious law firms before co-founding a small law firm with the Honorable Douglas Wilder, the former Governor of Virginia. At first, their practice included criminal defense, personal injury, domestic relations, wills, real estate closings, bankruptcy and civil litigation. Eventually the firm began representing large corporate and municipal clients, and Judge Gregory has tremendous experience trying numerous cases in the areas of insurance defense, criminal defense, employment law and commercial law. Since the beginning of this year, Judge Gregory has been doing an excellent job as a judge on the Fourth Circuit. There are a number of vacancies on the Fourth Circuit and we currently have three nominees for that court, all of whom I hope we confirm as soon as possible. President Bush has found Judge Gregory to be well qualified to continue in that position and I believe he should be confirmed. President Bush, in a very significant gesture aimed at changing the tone in Washington, focused on Judge Gregory's qualifications and, with the support of Senators Warner and Allen, nominated Judge Gregory to a lifetime appointment. Judge Gregory's re-nomination is an unmistakable gesture of bipartisanship by President Bush, which I must add is unprecedented in modern times. Today's hearing--along with what I hope will be timely confirmation votes in Committee and on the Senate floor--will be significant, concrete proof of President Bush's good- faith effort to move forward toward a constructive spirit of cooperation with the Senate. The two nominees for the District of Montana also demonstrate the rewards of bipartisanship. Both are highly qualified and are supported by both Senators from Montana one Republican and one Democrat. Judge Cebull has an outstanding record as a lawyer and a judge. He spent 28 years in private practice--both in general practice as well as specializing in the defense of personal injury, product liability, and professional liability cases. From 1970 to 1972, Judge Cebull served as Trial Judge for the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court. His jurisdiction covered criminal trials of tribe members charged with violating tribal ordinances. In 1998, Judge Cebull began serving his appointment as United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Montana, Great Falls Division, where he continues to serve at the present time. During his three years as Magistrate Judge, he has assembled a near-perfect record of having his decisions adopted and affirmed. Mr. Haddon's career is similarly outstanding. As a private practitioner since 1966, Mr. Haddon has developed considerable expertise in a broad range of litigation topics--both at the trial and appellate levels. Mr. Haddon has represented clients before state courts, Indian tribal courts, federal district court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the United States Supreme Court. His cases have included the areas commercial litigation, taxpayer suits, personal injury claims, civil rights, Indian law and constitutional law--to name a few. Mr. Haddon has also unselfishly donated his superior legal talents by performing pro bono work for members of the Flathead Nation Indian tribe--as well as for charitable, religious and philanthropic organizations. Switching now to the Department of Justice, I would like to welcome Ms. Eileen O'Connor, the nominee for Assistant Attorney General for the Tax Division. That is the Division that supervises all federal criminal tax prosecutions. It also defends the United States in tax refund lawsuits, institutes collection actions, defends the IRS in all tort claims, and represents the federal government in bankruptcy actions. In addition, the Tax Division represents federal departments and agencies in cases concerning the federal government's immunity from state and local taxation. Ms. O'Connor has proven to be a highly qualified expert on federal taxation issues. Over the course of her career, she has worked extensively as a partner for national accounting firms, as a corporate tax law specialist for the Internal Revenue Service, and as a sole practitioner. She has also applied her expertise in her role as an adjunct law professor at George Mason University and Georgetown University. In all of these roles, Ms. O'Connor has demonstrated impeccable skill and judgment--exactly the qualifications needed for the important position of Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department's Tax Division. As with the earlier nominees, I commend the president for nominating her. Again, it is a great pleasure to welcome these nominees to this Committee. Chairman Leahy. Well, I would point out, Senator Hatch, that all of the nominees here have undergone strenuous, arduous cross-examination, but none more arduous than what you just put them through there, which gives you some idea, Orrin, of what it has been like this afternoon. Senator Hatch. Well, I appreciate you being so fair to these good nominees. Chairman Leahy. Do you have any objection, then, to all of them, except Ms. O'Connor, leaving? Senator Hatch. I think you ought to be released. I will just submit questions in writing, and if you can get those answers right back, it would help us. Chairman Leahy. Ms. O'Connor, you stay, but Judge Gregory, you and your family, and Judge Cebull and Mr. Haddon, please feel free to leave. I mean, you are welcome to stay, but feel free to leave if you would like. Senator Hatch. I will really doubt your judgment if you stay. Chairman Leahy. Yes, I think you are probably right. That is that Western ``cut to the quick.'' [Laughter.] Senator Hatch. I will just welcome you, Ms. O'Connor. I am very proud of your nomination and look forward to supporting you all the way. Ms. O'Connor. Thank you very much, Senator. I see there are a few hardy people remaining for this exciting section of this hearing. Chairman Leahy. We all love taxes, let me tell you. Ms. O'Connor. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, members of the committee, thank you so much for setting this hearing today. I am very honored and privileged to be before you today as President Bush's nominee to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Tax Division of the Department of Justice. I apologize for my laryngitis, but you don't know how grateful I am to have any voice at all today after what I have been through. I thank Senator Hatch for the time that he spent with me a few weeks ago to get to know me a little bit, and I am very grateful to my Representative, Congresswoman Morella, for making the time to be here today and putting together from what I know not that glowing introduction of me. I very much appreciate the committee's consideration of my nomination and I hope that you will recommend my confirmation to the Senate. I look forward to responding to any questions you have. [The biograhpical information of Ms. O'Connor follows.] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.110 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.111 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.112 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.113 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.114 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.115 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.116 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.117 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.118 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.119 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.120 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.121 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.122 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.123 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.124 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.125 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.126 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.127 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.128 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T0915.129 Chairman Leahy. Thank you. Ms. O'Connor, you have a pamphlet, ``Women and Taxes: Understanding Where Your Money Goes,'' that you authored as part of a series. You wrote, ``Public debate over tax reform almost always produces complaints about tax breaks for the rich, but this is deliberately misleading.'' Who is being deliberately misleading in that regard? Ms. O'Connor. I guess anyone who hears it. I don't recall. It has been over a year since I finished that and if you could read me a little more of the context, I might recall what I was referring to. Chairman Leahy. We will get the context, and I will, if you would hold with us. President Bush's original tax cut plan would have provided the top 1 percent of taxpayers, those with incomes over $319,000 a year, with 43 percent of the benefits of his tax plan, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That same 1 percent, of course, contributes 21 percent of all revenue collected, so they would get about double the percent of revenue they pay the Federal Government. Would that have been a tax break for the rich? Ms. O'Connor. I am not sure I followed all of that. Oh, thank you. I am being handed--I think what I was probably referring to there is the point that President Bush has made in many of his remarks on tax reform, and that is that if you are going to cut taxes, if you are going to cut income taxes, the people who pay them are going to be the ones who get the breaks, and the more taxes you pay, the bigger a break you are probably going to get. I could assure the Senator, though--and I thank him for the question--that any views I have on tax policy have no interference with and do not override my overarching respect for the rule of law, which is what, as Assistant Attorney General of the Tax Division, I will be called upon to enforce. Chairman Leahy. Yes, and let me just back up a little bit. The pamphlet reads well and is well-written. I disagree with some of the conclusions, but I also assume that sometimes we have what has to be enforcing the statutes; other times what is being either an advocate or using the best case to make one's point. I would have to assume with this confirmation that you well understand the difference. Ms. O'Connor. Absolutely, Senator. Chairman Leahy. Let me give you an example on that, then, on some of the differences. The New York Times reported on a growing number of small business owners who are refusing to withhold Federal income taxes on their workers. I have actually gotten some calls on call-in shows in my State of Vermont about that. The small business owners who call themselves the Tax Honesty Movement believe that the Federal Government has no jurisdiction to collect income taxes from most Americans. The IRS has put these small business owners on notice that if they refuse to withhold taxes from workers' paychecks, they might be prosecuted. Is the IRS right on that? Ms. O'Connor. This is a very important issue today, Senator, and it relates also to the point which I just mentioned, which is that the rule of law must be respected. Some people pay taxes because it is the right thing to do, to obey the law. Some people will pay their taxes only if they are afraid not to. We owe it to all of those who pay taxes to make sure that everyone who is supposed to pay taxes does. The protester movements that you mention are a source of some attention both at the Internal Revenue Service and at the Justice Department's Tax Division these days. It is very important that in order for our self-assessment to work, people have to respect the law, and for the law to be respected, it must be enforced. Chairman Leahy. So you believe in this case if enforcement is called for, you see no reason why the Justice Department should not go forward with that enforcement? Ms. O'Connor. I am not familiar with all the particulars of the case you mention, but generally speaking, absolutely the tax laws should be enforced. Chairman Leahy. Now, you also wrote in the same pamphlet we gave you, ``It is not too much to ask that our Tax Code be simple, fair and understandable enough that the average person could do her own taxes in a reasonable amount of time. Simplifying the Tax Code simply makes sense for employers, employees, families and the Government.'' I will tell you, every spring when I am doing my taxes, I couldn't agree with you more. How would you simplify the Tax Code? Ms. O'Connor. Well, first, Senator, I would run for office. Senator Hatch. That is throwing it back down to him. [Laughter.] Chairman Leahy. We have all thought that, too, and we still seem to get more complicated every year. When I first came here, I was told that they have an arrangement for the IRS to any Member of Congress; if you want, they will come up and do your taxes for you. It was also a time when we had free haircuts. Obviously, with my hairline, I did not avail myself of the latter, and decided very quickly not to avail myself of the former. I said I have got to sit down here and go through this myself to see what most Vermonters are going through. Are there any magic bullets in simplifying the Tax Code? Ms. O'Connor. If there were, Senator, I am sure that you and your colleagues would have found it by now. There is constantly a tension between complexity and fairness, and I am sure that the Department of the Treasury will make proposals to you--at least I am thinking that they probably will make proposals to you toward simplification. Chairman Leahy. Well, Secretary O'Neill and I had also talked about that, but your role now will be that of enforcing the laws, if confirmed, not worrying how the Tax Code would be. Ms. O'Connor. That is right, Senator. Chairman Leahy. Well, I thank you very much. I am sorry you have had to stay here so long, but-- Ms. O'Connor. The only problem with that, Senator, is it was so humbling to be in the company of those very excellent judge nominees. Chairman Leahy. You are being very kind to them, but you live in the company of an excellent judge. Ms. O'Connor. I do, indeed. Chairman Leahy. Senator Hatch? Senator Hatch. Well, I just want to congratulate you. I know your reputation very well, I know how outstanding you are, and I expect you to be one of the best people who has ever served in this position. Ms. O'Connor. Thank you very much, Senator. Senator Hatch. So I am very proud to support you, and I appreciated the conversation we had in my office where we discussed a few of these matters. I just want you to know that we will try and put you through as soon as we possibly can. Ms. O'Connor. Thank you very much. Senator Hatch. Judge, we are so happy to have you here. We are honored to have you supporting your wife here in this hearing. It means a lot to us. Chairman Leahy. Just one more of the President's nominees who survived a grueling grilling. Thank you, Ms. O'Connor for being here. Ms. O'Connor. Thank you very much. Senator Hatch. There may be hope yet for these other nominees. Chairman Leahy. He has been working on me. Ms. O'Connor. Thank you very much for your time and your consideration. Chairman Leahy. We will keep the record open for other Senators to have a chance to submit questions, if they have them. With that, we stand adjourned. [Whereupon, at 3:25 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.] [Submissions for the record follow.] SUBMISSIONS FOR THE RECORD Statement of Hon. Richard J. Durbin, a U.S. Senator from the State of Illinois Today, this Committee is holding its first hearing on individuals who have been nominated by President Bush to fill vacancies on the federal bench. I want to thank Chairman Leahy for scheduling this hearing so quickly--within moments after the Senate reorganized on the last day before recess. I think it speaks to the level of commitment to fairness and efficiency that Chairman Leahy has always exhibited in these matters, and I look forward to working with him and my other colleagues on this Committee as we act upon judicial vacancies during this term. As we do so, we need to be mindful of our heavy responsibility. There are few duties more important to a United States Senator than to advise and consent on judicial nominations. Unlike executive branch nominees, a judicial appointment serves for life. Unlike political appointees, judges make decisions that have far- reaching and long-term consequences that can impact the lives of Americans for generations. And unlike term appointees who serve at the pleasure of a President, a judge's decision cannot be overturned easily by the next President, or even by Congress. Therefore, I take my duty in reviewing judicial nominations extremely seriously, and I know my colleagues do as well. I am also mindful of the fact that a vast majority of the vacancies have been pending since the last administration. This, of course, means that those vacancies should have been filled by President Clinton's nominees with advise and consent of the previous Senate. But they were not, and instead, they will now be filled by President Bush. I don't need to go into details about the remarkable delays and rejections that the Clinton nominees suffered, as the record speaks for itself. Names like Helene White, Richard Paez, Marsha Berzon, and Ronnie White became famous not simply because they are great lawyers, but because they had to endure some of the longest delays and procedural obstacles that any successful or unsuccessful judicial nominee ever had to face. I want to emphasize a simple point that I believe the American people recognize: Under the previous Administration, an overwhelming majority of nominees were individuals of integrity and conscience who had distinguished careers in the law, who held moderate views that are in step with the mainstream, and who held the best interests of our nation and its people at the core of their jurisprudence. We should expect no less from this Republican Administration. In other words, dozens of President Clinton's nominees were denied their chances to serve on the bench by the Republican Senate even though they were clearly qualified, and held centrist, moderate, and mainstream views. The people of our nation spoke last November, and the message was clear. The country is evenly split. The President was not given a mandate by the people to change the course of our nation. This is not the time to put forward ideologues or people with extreme views, and the Senate has a duty to see that the third branch of our government reflects the same balance and moderation that the American people chose when they sent us here to represent them 50-50. In looking at the backgrounds of the judicial nominees before us today, I believe these individuals are great examp"
