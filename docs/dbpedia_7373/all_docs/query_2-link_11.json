        "text": "Riley\n\nWe’ve already talked about the basic ground rules, the confidentiality of the proceedings. The only other thing I would mention is the business about Texas. I mentioned this in the letter because SMU [Southern Methodist University] is also doing a project that will cover the gubernatorial years. We will not make the Texas component an area of explicit questioning except for the lead-up to the Presidential campaign. It’s not because we’re not interested in it, it’s just in deference to our colleagues down there. You should, at any point that that Texas experience is relevant and you want to draw on it, feel free to talk about it.\n\nSpellings\n\nThat’s a lot.\n\nRiley\n\nOK, very good. This is the Margaret Spellings oral history interview as a part of the George W. Bush Oral History Project. Thank you for coming to Charlottesville to do this. The other thing we routinely do at the beginning as an aid to the transcriptionist is go around the table and everybody identify yourself and say a couple of words so she or he will know the voice.\n\nI’m Russell Riley, I’m the chair of the Presidential Oral History Program. You are?\n\nSpellings\n\nMargaret Spellings.\n\nRiley\n\nYou’re the subject today.\n\nKuzmich\n\nI’m Holly Kuzmich and I worked for Margaret for eight years. I spent three and a half years at the White House and four years at the Department of Education.\n\nRiley\n\nExcellent.\n\nRhodes\n\nI’m Jesse Rhodes, I’m a professor in the political science department at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.\n\nNelson\n\nI’m Mike Nelson, I teach political science at Rhodes College, and I’m a visiting professor here at the Miller Center.\n\nJones\n\nChuck Jones, Professor Emeritus of Political Science, University of Wisconsin, Madison, and a nonresident Senior Fellow at the Miller Center.\n\nRiley\n\nWhen is your earliest recollection of having the sense that Governor Bush was seriously contemplating a run for the Presidency?\n\nSpellings\n\nSeriously contemplating a run and having at least a glimmer in his eye, those are probably two distinct things.\n\nRiley\n\nOK, let’s deal with the first one, the glimmer in his eye.\n\nSpellings\n\nThe glimmer in the eye thing I remember. Bush was elected Governor in ’94, and the summer of ’95 he nominated me for an American Council of Young Political Leaders international trip to Argentina and Uruguay. On the trip, there was a lot of buzz about “Your boss is going to be the next President.” We all demurred. But when Bush established himself as a successful Governor, bipartisan, education, different kind of Republican, he always had—Come to the D.C. Alfalfa Club. He was always the son of a President and soon to have a brother who was a Governor because [John E.] Bush had lost in that go-round. But that whole Bush thing wasn’t beyond the realm of possibility. It was almost a built-in “it could happen.” I remember as early as that thinking that we wouldn’t want to do anything to preclude that.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nSpellings\n\nIt wasn’t a lead-pipe cinch or anything at that juncture, but it might happen.\n\nRiley\n\nThe buzz was among the people who were traveling with you, the young leaders?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, the young leaders, people across the country. Just like now when people are searching, who is out there? Heck, look at Sarah Palin. Who? What? You kidding me? But for someone who is governing a big state who had the Bush fund-raising moxie, who was doing a great job, who had created a Hispanic coalition around electorally. You do the math. You know who else was out there at the time.\n\nIt was always part of our psyche. But your question was, when did it become more of a definitive deal? He began a series of activities and events where he would host people at the mansion. He would come to Washington periodically making the rounds. Not ever with the “I’m running for President and this is what I’m here to talk to you about” but in the “So-and-so is important, let’s make the rounds.”\n\nAfter the session in ’97, we really had to keep the thumb in the dike all during that early part of ’97. It was like, “He’s running, he’s running, he’s running.” We kept saying, “No, no, we’re just trying to make sure that Texas—” and all of that. So probably late ’96, early ’97.\n\nNelson\n\nWas there any thought at all of ’96 as a possible—?\n\nSpellings\n\nNo.\n\nNelson\n\nWhen you said it was in “our” psyche, who is the we, the people around Bush or Bush himself included?\n\nSpellings\n\nThe people around Bush. I think the President—this is unspoken. It wasn’t overt at all and it wasn’t spoken of, but it was always in the realm of “could happen.” I could be Miss America. I might lose. Those sort of fantasy-life things. I’m sure you think of things like that. Maybe I could climb Mt. Everest.\n\nJones\n\nBut there was no sense in running for Governor of Texas that that was a path.\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, I don’t think so.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have any conversations with him about this specifically that you recall? Eventually you must have.\n\nSpellings\n\nIt was always a crazy “We could form a rock band” kind of thing. Seriously, there was always that “it could happen.” You know politics, it’s all about timing and other conditions and the wave and the weather. It’s so organic. I think he always recognized that the conditions could be created where that would be the right thing, and if they were he was open to it. To the extent that he was involved in helping create some of the conditions and meet the right people and make the right rounds and think about policy in ways that—I think Karl [Rove] clearly did more of this. Not that Bush didn’t have a true love and affinity for education. He knows it, we’ll get into that. It is his favorite policy area. Actually, I think he came to Washington to be the education President and then 9/11 happened. And I’ll talk about immigration too. He really owns this subject and has a personal affinity for it.\n\nTo the extent that Karl and the political types observed, “Wow, a Republican who talks about education in a different kind of way, that could be a differentiator,” and it was. An important one. Some theorize it might have made the difference in the super-razor-thin election.\n\nRhodes\n\nDo you think that was self-conscious on his part? You refer to people around him taking this somewhat different tack to be a different kind of Republican. Had Bush always been, in terms of his policy positions, a little different? Was he thinking about formulating positions on issues like charters or—\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, but it wasn’t overt. He actually believes that immigration policy ought to have an understanding that we’re not going to deport 14 million people. That’s what he actually believes. He would never be for an Arizona type thing. Pete Wilson was, they were doing Prop whatever it was, English only and all those things. We have a thousand miles of border; we would never do that. We talked a lot about that at the time it was going on, what he ought to do. No, it was rooted in his core principles, but it also had some added political value.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me come back then. We talked about a glimmer in the eye and the idea of a possibility of a run. When does this begin to gel more thoroughly? Is it after the Congressional midterms in ’98 when the Congressional Republicans are sort of in disarray, or is he thinking more seriously about it before then?\n\nSpellings\n\nGosh, I cannot remember. I need to think about the dates of all this.\n\nRiley\n\nSome of this, if you want to come back with the transcript you could.\n\nSpellings\n\nWhen Bush was running for Governor it was a real issue the second time, so that was the campaign of ’98. People said, “This is a joke, he’s not going to even get close to filling out his term. This is just a table setter for a run for President. Will you commit and promise that you’re never going to run for President?” It was certainly well discussed by that time.\n\nRiley\n\nBut he felt like he was going to serve out a second term if he ran at the point that he ran?\n\nSpellings\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nOK. [laughter]\n\nSpellings\n\nHow could he? No. We knew.\n\nRiley\n\nSo by the time he’s running in ’98 it is a strong probability.\n\nSpellings\n\nIt’s a strong possibility, I wouldn’t say he was all the way over into the probability stage. Again, back to the organic nature of everything. If someone else had emerged and had raised hundreds of millions of dollars or something like that, certainly he would have fallen by the wayside and that just would have happened. But it didn’t. In fact, we were talking about this when we were down at the Bush Institute the other day.\n\nBush may be the last President, certainly for a long time, who had the luxury of—He was the anointed one. We didn’t have any of this primary business or worries. Everything he did to set the table, to make the rounds, to go to the Alfalfa Club, to do all these unorthodox things for Governors, but he was a Bush and he knew all these people. He had this vast network not only because of his dad’s background but his own, having been in the Washington scene. We just cut everybody off at the pass.\n\nThere was no Mike Huckabee sparring and Mitch Daniels and any of that kind of thing.\n\nRiley\n\nWho was viewed as the most problematic contender at that point?\n\nSpellings\n\nI can’t even remember. Seriously, who was, Holly? You know in Texas—Holly will hate this—but there’s the United States and then here’s us.\n\nRiley\n\nWe’re going to have to add that map. We’re aware of that.\n\nSpellings\n\nThis is Texas, this is other. I don’t even know; I’ll think about it. It was a long time ago.\n\nNelson\n\nHis thinking, maybe your thinking, was if he does go for it in 2000 he’ll get it, at least the nomination.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, and Bush is definitely a risk taker, no doubt about it. It was a pretty good risk. We had done all these very smart things politically, policywise and otherwise. I should have brought our policy book. I’m sure you’ve seen it. When he ran for President.\n\nRiley\n\nYou mentioned it when you were here before.\n\nSpellings\n\nWhy didn’t I bring it? Do you have it? Have you seen it?\n\nRiley\n\nI probably have seen it, but I sure don’t have it. If you’ve got extra copies just put it in with the transcript, it would be useful for the readers.\n\nSpellings\n\nIt is, if I do say modestly, of course I was working on the policy side, pretty darn impressive. It was very dense. There was none of this drive-by, we had budget numbers. The standard was high.\n\nRiley\n\nBut by the time you get to where you’re working on that you’ve already—\n\nSpellings\n\nWe’re already knee deep in it. Even on the policy side we started convening after the session in ’97. Is that right?\n\nJones\n\nAfter the legislative session?\n\nSpellings\n\nWe started convening national leaders by subject.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nSpellings\n\nMaybe it wasn’t 97, maybe it was ’98. I’ll have to think about the date. But we had a series of people come to the mansion. We had Diane Ravitch and Lynne Cheney and Checker [Chester] Finn and all these people. Holly, help me think of those dates. It was all the conservative education glitterati that we were going to have to deal with. It was this giant schmooze-fest to get them on our program.\n\nRiley\n\nIt probably would have been ’97 because you’re running a reelection campaign in ’98 for Governor, right? So it wouldn’t make sense—\n\nSpellings\n\nIt’s possible it was ’99.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s a checkable thing.\n\nSpellings\n\nBy ’99 we’re totally out and really developing policy. Condi [Condoleezza Rice] was coming down and Josh [Bolten] had been at least—yes, they were starting to come to the table.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about how those things were organized and how they unfolded? Do you have any specific memories of events with people you were involved with?\n\nSpellings\n\nSure. Have you been to the Texas Governor’s Mansion? Somebody who is involved in this ought to, it would be an interesting thing, to see the vibe of the place.\n\nRiley\n\nIt’s still there?\n\nSpellings\n\nIt damn near burned down, but it’s being reconstructed. I don’t know if you can get in today but it’s very cozy, it’s very homey, sort of intimate. We would always have some sort of a meal function like a lunch. Bush would come over from the Capitol. These groups were probably a dozen-ish prominent national figures being invited to Texas to the Governor’s Mansion. If Mitch Daniels invited me to the Governor’s Mansion, and I got to have lunch with him and I was sitting around with the 12 most influential people in education policy, I’d think that was pretty cool and pretty smart. So it was just this schmooze-fest.\n\nWe would have a meal and then adjourn to the living room and chat for several hours about American public policy. It was education, it was welfare, it was crime, it was juvenile justice. And each of the people in the Governor’s office who were political also and had policy expertise, we were charged with figuring out who ought to be invited, in conjunction with our political types, with Karl and company.\n\nWe would create an agenda and materials. Bush would engage, he would be there from lunch through five o’clock in the afternoon. He would sit down with these people and ruminate and talk and learn and study.\n\nNelson\n\nWas there any homework for this? Had he been given things to read?\n\nSpellings\n\nOh, yes. Obviously I’m most familiar with education stuff. He knows more about this and has—No Child Left Behind [NCLB] is what he—We’ll get into the whole choice stuff, but reading all of those things. He didn’t need much schooling on that, unlike the foreign-policy type stuff where he, Condi, and Brent Scowcroft, he had a lot more to learn than in this arena. All the domestic stuff, the criminal justice, we had our own experiences.\n\nJones\n\nWas there a product of this? A summary or—there weren’t transcripts I take it.\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, there weren’t transcripts. Whether these can be found or not I don’t know, but we would produce binders, topical-issue papers. So in this four-hour gathering that we’d have with a dozen education luminaries, we’d talk about choice, we’d talk about teacher issues, we’d talk about unions. There was some order to it, and there were materials and an agenda.\n\nJones\n\nI take it in addition to the contacts you were making, it was going in the direction of producing a set of proposals.\n\nSpellings\n\nCorrect, and it became, eventually, a series of speeches and the guts of this policy book. What is the name of that blue book?\n\nKuzmich\n\nRenewing America’s Promise.\n\nSpellings\n\nRenewing America’s Promise. It was around various themes, personal responsibility, those sorts of things. It ultimately became that. We talked about very granular things like how much would this cost, what order of magnitude would you have to invest in? The standard was really high, the level of detail then compared to what you see out of the [John] McCain campaign or the [Barack] Obama campaign. It’s totally different.\n\nJones\n\nAnd what was the hierarchy of approval and refinement?\n\nSpellings\n\nI think it varied. I was a state employee at the time and I had various conditions. This was after hours, all those sorts of things.\n\nJones\n\nSure.\n\nSpellings\n\nOther people were more political operatives and had less—Some of the process stuff varied by virtue of who was involved, it was more individual driven. I was going to tackle the education stuff. Condi was going to tackle her area. Eventually all this stuff flowed up to Josh Bolten, who was the policy director of the campaign, and all of the processes that that netted out. They became a series of speeches that were very strategically planned.\n\nJones\n\nSure.\n\nSpellings\n\nIn Los Angeles we talked about charter schools, he went to a charter school. The policy book—I’m sorry I didn’t bring it—has the speech, the guts of the thing and a little bit of the color around what went on. That’s how it developed.\n\nNelson\n\nBy this time Governor Bush’s education reforms had been enacted into law in Texas. These experts who came in, Ravitch, Finn—\n\nSpellings\n\nLynne Cheney was involved.\n\nNelson\n\nHad they become independently aware of what Governor Bush was doing in Texas before they ever got invited to this sort of thing?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nIs this an area where already he was a player whose actions were—\n\nSpellings\n\nHe was, he absolutely was. One of the themes I’m sure you’ll see, managing your friends is always the most difficult thing. In these early days these types thought, Oh, good, we’re back. But the truth of the matter is that Checker Finn and Diane Ravitch et al. never much liked what we were doing. But they thought, OK, we’re going to end it; we’re going to get this yahoo from Texas all sorted out, and we’ll end up running the show. Then they got the big freeze-out and continue to write nasty things about it to this day.\n\nRhodes\n\nCould you talk a little about that because it was one of the striking things that occurred to me when you were just talking. At least for some of these folks, obviously Checker Finn, it is one thing to have standards and testing and accountability when an individual state is doing it. At least from their perspective. It’s different if you’re thinking about using the ESEA [Elementary and Secondary Education Act] to do things nationally. I’m just curious if those issues were discussed with them, how they responded to it in ’98, ’99. I’m just curious what the dynamic was.\n\nSpellings\n\nHere’s the thing about this. Texans love to brag, that’s how we are, so I’ll just make an apology one time for the next two days. But we were so far ahead of them it wasn’t even funny. We’re down here with a thousand miles of border, don’t come down here and talk to us about educating Hispanics. Besides these people, the old Republican orthodoxy on education was about choice, vouchers, vouchers, and furthermore, vouchers. Big whoop.\n\nWe knew we were going to have choice in there. It’s all they really cared about. As long as they had that and they thought they were going to be in like Flynn, they didn’t even know what we were doing, they didn’t even get it. They really didn’t get it, in my humble opinion.\n\nJones\n\nThey being—?\n\nSpellings\n\nThe Republican old dogs, the old guard.\n\nJones\n\nNot Finn and Ravitch?\n\nSpellings\n\nThey’re part of the old guard, you bet.\n\nJones\n\nSo there are really two old guards here you’re talking about, those who are “experts” and those who are eventually important in making decisions as to whether this is going to happen or not.\n\nSpellings\n\nRight, but standard fare for Republicans in education was trying to abolish the Department of Education, empower parents through choice and vouchers. Of course, Minnesota is going on to the charter movement, it is in its infancy. The famous and infamous KIPP [Knowledge Is Power Program], we founded it, we started it. Mike Feinberg came to me when Bush was Governor and said, “We’ve got this crazy idea with my friend Dave Levin, can you help us?” Barbara Bush got involved. This was a glimmer in somebody’s eye, the charter movement, KIPP academies were founded in Houston and New York. But this was so antithetical to everything they were about. They didn’t even get what we were talking about, as long as they had choice in there and there was some sort of sop to local control.\n\nRiley\n\nMargaret, can you say anything more about distinguishing between these consultations that you’re having on issues like education where he clearly is way ahead of the curve and some of the other issues where you’re bringing in experts like Condi Rice’s group, where as a Governor he wouldn’t have had a real foreign policy.\n\nSpellings\n\nRight.\n\nRiley\n\nIs there a different dynamic in those meetings? Are you a party to those meetings?\n\nSpellings\n\nJust indirectly. It was probably more tutorial than it was—it was more an education thing. Here’s what’s up. Here’s what is at issue. Here’s who the players are. It was literally more like a tutorial.\n\nRiley\n\nGot you. Were there any, in your memory, that went sour? Any of these consultations where somebody came in and either the Governor was underwhelmed by what he was hearing or—?\n\nSpellings\n\nThis was also a great way to size up people clearly for future use if it came to that, and see how they played with others, what their own agendas and philosophies were. All the way across the board. It ended up being an important vetting process.\n\nRiley\n\nOf course.\n\nSpellings\n\nI think some people Bush was more inclined toward than others, but none of the groups blew up or any of that.\n\nRiley\n\nYou knew the Governor very well at this point. What kinds of things did he like to see in these outside experts who came in? What were the kinds of things that if you had a five-minute conversation with somebody you could size up and say, “This is somebody George W. Bush is going to like”?\n\nSpellings\n\nThat’s a very interesting question. I never really thought of it like that, but he is inclined toward one type of person more than others. The cerebral, pontificating academics—sorry—the cigar-smoking, he makes fun of that sort of thing. He literally would make fun of people who smoked pipes. “Who could smoke a pipe? Constantly have to light the stupid thing,” that sort of deal.\n\nHe is fast paced, high energy, give it to him in chunks, get to the nitty-gritty. So people who tease up and the “here’s why this is important,” no, that’s not his style. That continues to be true to this day. He also was looking for places—because he was very sensitive about his dad’s people, his dad’s orthodoxy, and the old whatever—he could differentiate, and education was clearly a great example of where he could do that.\n\nJones\n\nBefore we get too deeply into the details of education, what’s the source, in your judgment, of his wanting to be an education Governor, an education President? Where did that come from? There are a lot of policy areas.\n\nSpellings\n\nI think a couple of data points. He didn’t just wake up and say, “Oh, I think I want to be the education President.” His mother was extremely involved in literacy and all those sorts of things. Laura Bush is a teacher and librarian and educator. He himself with that program, that at-risk thing in Houston. Do you remember the name of it?\n\nKuzmich\n\nNo.\n\nSpellings\n\nHe had been involved with some groups in Houston in his young days where he saw the value of education. He saw that it was the differentiator as to whether poor kids made it or not. I think he really believed that. When he ran for Governor the first time he used to say that the best criminal justice policy, the best welfare reform policy, the best whatever policy is education policy. He saw that as the headwaters of all the rest of this stuff and most fundamental. Of course I can’t disagree with him. He thought if you got that right, a lot of this other stuff would take care of itself.\n\nNelson\n\nWe’re talking about what impressed Bush, what kinds of personal qualities impressed Bush. Who impressed Bush in this education meeting, in others that you were involved with? Who impressed Bush and as a result was somebody he wanted to bring further into his orbit, even into the administration?\n\nSpellings\n\nPart of the gatherings we had were taking soundings on what hoi polloi thought. I don’t think he ever thought, Man, that Checker Finn is one smart son of a bitch and I need to have him in our government, ever. But he was like, “OK, I know I’ve got to go see the elders and have them buy in and not give me trouble.” He was impressed by people like Mike Feinberg, Wendy Kopp—Teach for America was just starting in those days—education entrepreneurs. There’s a bunch of people around Texas, Terry Flowers in Dallas, a charter school operator. Jaime Escalante. He’s more drawn to the shake-up-and-move-out types than the academics or the policy wonks.\n\nRiley\n\nThese were not just people with demonstrated Republican credentials, these were folks who were—\n\nSpellings\n\nThe kind of brain trust skull sessions were for the most part demonstrated Republicans. Of course he had known Sandy Kress in Dallas, but Sandy was party to a lot of these discussions. He had been the chairman of the so-called Kress Commission in Dallas, was the president of the Dallas School Board, ran for Congress. He was the former chairman of the Democratic Party in Dallas. At that time that was kind of an oxymoron. Now Dallas, the big D.\n\nRiley\n\nYes.\n\nSpellings\n\nSo it wasn’t all Republican.\n\nRiley\n\nBecause you mentioned, as I recall from the symposium we had, you jokingly were poking fun at Bruce Reed for having grabbed some things from their show.\n\nSpellings\n\nOh, we definitely did, we absolutely did. The Republican skull sessions were useful, but they were also political. We did it because we thought it would be real smart to get them on the reservation, sound them out, smoke them out and say that we did.\n\nRiley\n\nFind out where they were.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes.\n\nRhodes\n\nYou mentioned Sandy Kress. I was just curious if you’d be willing to talk a little about the role of the discussions with the business community, the Texas Business Commission, Texans for Education. It has been my impression that there was some exchange there.\n\nSpellings\n\nGovernor [Ann] Richards had created this thing called the Governor’s Business Council. She was a character in her own right, and she created this Governor’s Business Council to soak up a lot of the money and create a legitimate forum to pretend like you were getting input from the business community. These were mostly Bush-inclined people, but we kept the thing and used it as our high-level lobby group if you will—they hired a lobbyist—and a way to create very high-level engagement around policy issues. It was terrific. It was an excellent way to do public policy because it was a who’s who of Texas. They would meet quarterly. At the time I think Ken Lay was the chairman, although it was a rotating thing. There were others who became chairman, but I think initially Ken was the chairman. Ain’t that a wild deal?\n\nSo Bush would go quarterly to this who’s who of Texas business, and literally these were the CEOs [chief executive officers], and say, “You know what I care about a whole lot? Education. If you care about me, if you care about—” They all had important issues with the state of Texas. So when the Governor said, “This is what I want you to do,” they got with it. It was highly effective.\n\nNelson\n\nAnything else on this general area of Bush and these sessions where people are invited in?\n\nSpellings\n\nA couple of things that it did. It was also a way for him to audition for people who were out in the chattering class, who may have thought, Here’s sonny boy. For him to show that he was smart and able and strategic and energetic. It was part of cutting everybody off at the pass. Whether that was overt or not, it allowed him to audition for people who were out and say, “This guy’s got some stuff.”\n\nRiley\n\nI wanted to ask about your sense of how Governor Bush liked to receive information. You’ve talked about getting briefing materials, written materials. But this is a combination. You’re giving him things to read, and then there is a great deal of interaction with a group of people. Is he somebody who preferred to receive information orally? Was there something special about having groups of people?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes. I do want to say this, I don’t know who else has worked for him, was in his employ from the campaign for Governor the first time through the entirety of the Presidential administration, it might just be me. “Dude!” as my children would say. Seriously. What the hell was I thinking about? No, it was great.\n\nRiley\n\nThat’s why we have you number three on the list.\n\nSpellings\n\nHe obviously reads things, but what I’ve learned over the course of working with him is brief, to the point, page-and-a-half typed memo and then discussion. From my Texas Governor days here’s how the policy process would work. This is what I loved about working for him. But I was a free agent. Education was not something—this is true at the federal level and it was true in Texas. It is such a dominant—50 percent of your budget is education, and you have to have somebody you have a lot of confidence in who knows what they’re doing and some staff people and so on. But there’s not all that much comingling with other things. I didn’t need to work with the people who were doing natural resources or doing whatever. This was the two-ton gorilla issue.\n\nUnlike other areas in public policy where there is more competition for resources and more of the highway people have to work with the environmental people and they have to work with the economic development people. That’s less true in education, wouldn’t you say? Certainly that’s the case at the federal level.\n\nKuzmich\n\nYes.\n\nSpellings\n\nThe policy process went like this for the entire time, six years that I worked for him as Governor and even during the campaign. It was me, my own self, writing some stuff down, going up there and saying, “This is what you ought to do,” talking through it with him and then we’d go do it. I’d say, “You need to come to the next meeting of the Governor’s Business Council, we need to do X.” It all worked fine and dandy. There wasn’t a lot of “everybody gets a vote.” That changed when we came to the White House and a lot of people wanted to mess in our business. But in the good old days—\n\nJones\n\nIt occurs to me in thinking about the Governor of Texas that outside Texas has always been that it is basically a weak position.\n\nSpellings\n\nOh, yes.\n\nJones\n\nAnd weak in part because the Governors have perhaps accepted that notion and not been very policy innovative and so forth. So here comes someone who is, who sees it as a job for problem solving, and that contributes to the notion that perhaps this person might be Presidential timber.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes.\n\nJones\n\nAnd in particular because his reputation before was not necessarily that strong, there was even talk about Jeb being the potential President. So there is a creation there quite apart from his own ambition. There is the creation there of someone who is bound to get some national attention because it doesn’t quite fit what one would assume would be the case for a Texas Governor. Does that make any sense?\n\nSpellings\n\nThat’s a great point. One of your last questions on here, “What do people need to know about George Bush that they don’t know?” What is George Bush’s gift and talent and ability that is different from Jeb? I know them both well. George Bush can put the right people together who are the influential, driver types and move out around something. So what if the Texas Constitution has a weak Governor position? When you knit together every major CEO in our state and have all the legislative leadership—not the least of which is Bob Bullock, the two-ton gorilla Democrat—working your program, you’re going. It is the ability to do that. The reason I’ve worked for him from Day One until the end is that people want to be part of something big and meaningful and important and constructive. He plays to your better angels.\n\nWhen I think back about the way he governed versus now, it just makes me sick to see all of the people who were Bush supporters and going in the same direction are now all fighting among themselves. The whole [Rick] Perry–[Kay Bailey] Hutchison deal. We never had any of that kind of thing. But it wasn’t an accident. That just doesn’t happen spontaneously, you’ve got to keep people pulling in the same direction, and that is what he is a master at.\n\nNelson\n\nThere were some pretty prominent Texas Republicans on the national scene—[Thomas] DeLay, [Richard] Armey in the House, Phil Gramm—how did he think about them when he thought about stepping out onto the national stage as a candidate? Did he see that as an asset, as a problem to be solved?\n\nSpellings\n\nBoth, depending on who you were talking about.\n\nNelson\n\nWell, let’s take them in turn and maybe—\n\nSpellings\n\nI don’t necessarily want to talk about them. [laughter] But obviously Bush has more, philosophically and by personality, in common with some than others. He was very fond of Phil Gramm and thought he was smart, a doer and a goer. You asked about the type of people that Bush liked to connect with, Phil Gramm more than Tom DeLay , absolutely. That was always true. But so what. He certainly recognized them as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nRiley\n\nWho in the Texas universe has an underappreciated role in Bush’s background, particularly during the gubernatorial years, that helped launch him into the national discussion or helped create somebody who is a Presidential candidate? Is there anybody, or is the cast of characters the people who follow him to Washington and that we get to know, the Margaret Spellings and Karl Roves?\n\nSpellings\n\nKarl was very influential politically, but there was a series of kind of wise men.\n\nNelson\n\nNot in the background.\n\nSpellings\n\nNot in the background. A series of wise men in Texas, the Louis Beecherls and the Peter O’Donnells and the Fred Meyers. The Republican wise men who had been there for years and counseled and mentored. And of course Bullock. [James E.] Pete Laney, they are very fond of each other. The Texas old guard of both parties. Back to the genius of George Bush, he knows how to work people, and he knows how to be respectful. He’s about to run for President or be President, and he knows how to be respectful and seek that kind of guidance. There’s nothing old men love more than that, seriously. It was authentic, it wasn’t like, “I’m going to go schmooze these old farts.” It was genuine, it was authentic, it was a two-way deal.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you walk us through the process of deciding that you genuinely were going to do this? You’ve got the meetings coming in. There must be a point at which you have to make a go or no go decision, well before a formal announcement.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes. Holly’s from Indiana and we talk a lot about Mitch Daniels. But there is a mating dance. You can see it with the Mitch deal. You’re on course to think you’re doing everything necessary and proper and appropriate, and you’re 90 percent decided.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nSpellings\n\nWhen that actually goes from 90 to 100, it almost becomes a nonevent because you look back and it’s like you’re on a journey. You’ve gone through all the towns and sure enough you’re there.\n\nRiley\n\nWhen you actually get into the end of ’99 into 2000 when he’s—I don’t remember when the formal announcement was.\n\nSpellings\n\nIt was in Austin and it was a cavalcade of stars at the Austin Convention Center and people were like, “Holy shit, get out of the way.” It was Colin Powell and Don Rumsfeld and Jennifer Dunn and Henry Kissinger, you name it, they were there. We can get the names of everybody. Every important Republican you would want on your team was locked and loaded. It was summer of ’99.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you have a piece of the action in setting that up?\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, not really. It was a national event. We all went. It was a big deal, but I guess Karl and others recruited the cavalcade of stars. When he announces early that summer, he has a ton of money in the bank, he’s been everywhere and he has every prominent Republican you’d want—moderate and conservative alike—around him.\n\nRhodes\n\nCan you talk a little about behind the scenes, the response of Republican Party members, particularly the conservative activists? Was their thought, We’ve got a winner, this is someone who looks very strong going into the first general election campaign, or were there undercurrents of concern, questions about some of the unorthodox positions he was taking on education issues?\n\nSpellings\n\nReally not. When you think about it, we’re all thinking about this in the context of today and this whole huge brouhaha going on between the right and the less right. That just wasn’t the case at the time. Republicans had been in the wilderness for a long time. Conservatives were important. I don’t mean to minimize their views or their involvement, but it wasn’t this amped-up, highly public time at all. We were unified. It wasn’t a Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee versus Mitch Daniels argument about whether you have enough credentials and the whole tea party. It wasn’t anything like that.\n\nNelson\n\nThere were Republican conservatives who strongly objected to the notion of compassionate conservatism. What was that about?\n\nSpellings\n\nWhy did they object? Different kind of Republican. The compassionate conservatism is a different kind of Republican thing, that was distinguishing.\n\nNelson\n\nLet me rephrase the question. First, when does that term become one Bush embraces, and are you part of that process?\n\nSpellings\n\nKaren Hughes was the mastermind of that phraseology, “compassionate conservatism.” I think that was actually after he was elected the second time. We certainly used that kind of formulation in the last legislative session. Probably after he announced but into that summer and fall, the whole different kind of Republican. After it was pretty clear that the Bush juggernaut was coming through and there would be no primary, that stuff became more prominent and that’s when education, immigration, and other things—But we never really had a primary, we never really had anything to fight about with the right.\n\nNelson\n\nMcCain was there.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, he was there, but it didn’t seem like it lasted very long. Maybe I’m in my little tunnel vision.\n\nNelson\n\nIt didn’t last very long, no.\n\nRhodes\n\nIn his book it talks about the extent to which Bush’s deep faith and his understanding paired up perfectly with people who were talking about compassionate conservatism as a new approach. Did you see that?\n\nSpellings\n\nAbsolutely. That all has a lot to do with his own personal story and drinking and recovery and all that. I think the whole compassionate conservatism thing really developed in his own mind when he was Governor. He would go to these prison ministries or these—I’m sure you’ve read the story about talking to the young black prisoner, and the young man asked Bush, “What do you think of me?” Connecting with him on a human level about recovery and about frailty.\n\nIt was so personal with him. You can’t really get in somebody’s chili about their faith experience when it is so authentic. Or at least nobody did.\n\nRiley\n\nWas that an experience you shared with him?\n\nSpellings\n\nAm I in recovery?\n\nRiley\n\nNo, that wasn’t actually my question. Let me step on your answer. Did you have evangelical roots also or not?\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, I was raised Catholic and drifted off to Episcopalianism for a while and then drifted back to Catholicism.\n\nRiley\n\nBut it wasn’t something that was a requirement within—\n\nSpellings\n\nHe’s not somebody who wears any of this on his sleeve, but I can tell you. He reads the Bible daily. That little The Word or whatever it is, the little Bible verse thing. You would see it on his desk when he was Governor. But he absolutely didn’t wear it on his sleeve. Donnie Evans, I’m sure you’re going to talk to Don, they went to church together and had a very faith-related—\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nSpellings\n\nBut it’s related to his recovery, to his—\n\nRiley\n\nBy the time you knew him he didn’t drink anything, is that right?\n\nSpellings\n\nI’ve never seen him take a drink.\n\nNelson\n\nWhat did you do in the campaign? Once it was launched and announced what did you do in the campaign? Did you leave your Texas position?\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, I wore two hats, and I had to be very careful about following the rules of the road on that. There were a couple of us, very damn few. It was me and Vance McMahan, state employees who were involved in the campaign at all. We created this whole apparatus. To the extent there were two people who were the overlap and had to do cross pollinating. I worked for the state of Texas and was trying to keep the ship of state afloat in conjunction with others. It was a weird time in that respect too. Bush had to be able to trust people were holding that up while he was out running around the country and that it was passing muster and it was vigorous and he was on the job and all of those sorts of things and have an eye toward where we were headed.\n\nJoe Allbaugh had gone over to the campaign and Clay Johnson [III]—I assume you’re going to talk to Clay—was back at the ranch. That all worked out fine. We birthed our policies and then got more tactical over time.\n\nNelson\n\nYou got more tactical over time?\n\nSpellings\n\nIt became about voter registration and going to Iowa and the caucuses. I didn’t have really anything to speak of in that.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there any rearguard efforts you had to fight in Texas that were launched by the Democrats to try to keep the Governor off his balance while he was trying to focus on a national campaign?\n\nSpellings\n\nNot that I recall at all.\n\nRiley\n\nHe had supporters, Bullock in particular.\n\nSpellings\n\nOh, yes, Bob Bullock and Pete Laney were the presidents of the fan club.\n\nRiley\n\nOK, interesting.\n\nSpellings\n\nWhen I think about it, the only vexing thing at all was Rick Perry. He was starting to kind of measure the drapes and wanted to encroach on, become Governor before his time.\n\nNelson\n\nOne of the things I’m hearing underneath your account so far is that from the start the Bush campaign had a general election strategy. In other words, the nomination didn’t seem like that big a fight.\n\nSpellings\n\nRight.\n\nNelson\n\nThe other kind of Republican strategy sounds like it is aimed more at independent voters.\n\nSpellings\n\nDefinitely.\n\nNelson\n\nIn November rather than a Republican primary, is that accurate?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, I would say that’s accurate. The primary strategy was to go and pick off everybody through good works and schmoozing and button down all the troops. Then it becomes a nonevent, right? It wasn’t as if there was no primary strategy, the primary strategy was to not have a primary strategy, but it was complicated. He had dozens and dozens of dinners and meetings, and would make the rounds. I remember when he and Marc Racicot, Racicot was Governor of Montana at the time, but he went to Israel with a number of Governors. Things like that had profile beyond—a Governor taking a foreign trip that’s not a trade mission with other Governors. That kind of thing.\n\nNelson\n\nSo it’s not like he’s doing the typical thing, which is you run right to get the nomination and then you have to tack back to the center.\n\nSpellings\n\nRight.\n\nNelson\n\nHe didn’t have to run right.\n\nSpellings\n\nNo.\n\nRhodes\n\nSome people come to mind in education, and perhaps other issues as well, I wouldn’t put it entirely tactically, but efforts to reach out to or pick off Democrats. So people in education like Kati Haycock or—\n\nSpellings\n\nWe did.\n\nRhodes\n\nOr Bill Taylor.\n\nSpellings\n\nWe did.\n\nRhodes\n\nIf you could just talk a little bit about that.\n\nSpellings\n\nWe were having Republican politics until we started to have some of these speeches, and he started calling for accountability and he talked about the achievement gap and change in demographics and all of these sorts of issues that were really unusual. That got a lot of buzz and attention in Washington. Not only back here working on the Hill. They noticed and we courted them. So Kati and Amy [Wilkins], you bet. We talked to them; they would say nice things about him. Probably at some considerable cost to themselves.\n\nWhat other Democrats were kind of helping us at times? Kati and Amy most notably, Bill, God rest his soul, probably later, but Bill becomes really important when it comes time to defend No Child Left Behind for real. I’m trying to think who else. But what he also did was shut a lot of Democrats up. People who would normally be castigating a Republican for their voucher-only, federalist blah-blah-blah were just quiet as mice, really.\n\nRhodes\n\nSo they would convey the message to people like George Miller, other Democrats or do you mean—\n\nSpellings\n\nWhen Bush met George Miller for the first time, which was at the mansion before the famous luncheon, I was party to their first conversation. “We’ve been watching you; you’ve been doing great things. We’ve tried to do a lot of the stuff and the Congress couldn’t get it through.” Back to the DLC [Democratic Leadership Council] stuff, although we obviously built away on it, annual assessment, disaggregated data, closing the achievement gap, all those sorts of things. Some Democrats had been advancing that kind of thing, and we show up and say, “That’s a really good idea, and by the way, we’ve been doing it and getting some really good results down here in a state that has 10 percent of the student population of the country.”\n\nRiley\n\nWere there any other issues on your portfolio during the pre-campaign and the campaign season?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, I also did appointments to boards and commissions. That is the power of the executive in Texas. Some judicial vacancies, not a ton of judicial stuff but I did all the public utility commission, a lot of the higher ed boards, our higher education coordinating board. Governing bodies, the Texas Juvenile Probation Commission. Kid-related things, education-related things, and some judicial things.\n\nThe power of George Bush, in addition to his leadership ability and kind of “Music Man” ability, is the way he can attract very solid people into the government. We really worked at that, people who didn’t make government a career but came into government because he talked them into it.\n\nRiley\n\nBut there weren’t any direct implications for what you were doing there with the campaign other than just making sure you didn’t slip up or that you were covering your bases within the state?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes. Part of the campaign of course is having to respond about your record. So it is “Why did you do this?” or “Did you grant a permit for that?” and all of that. The defensive side. Vance McMahan and I were highly involved in that. A questionnaire that came in from the NRA [National Rifle Association] and having to go through all of that and square it with your record and why did you sign such-and-such a bill, or why didn’t you sign such-and-such a bill. So all the defensive record-related stuff to being in government.\n\nJones\n\nMy recollection is that the announcement followed something. Was it the end of the legislative session?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes.\n\nJones\n\nAnd there was no anxiety that you should get going?\n\nSpellings\n\nThere was anxiety. Bush was very adamant about wanting to close out the session but—the only analogy I can make is when your child is about to go off to college and you’ve got to hurry up and get him there because you’re both about to erupt. They’re about to break out and you’re about to strangle them. So it was a tense time keeping it all contained through the last days of the legislative session and pretending like, “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.”\n\nJones\n\nDid this include the Governor at all getting anxious? Or was he a calming influence?\n\nSpellings\n\nProbably he was more of a calming influence on the rest of us, yes. He still had a sense of some equities on state policy issues. People wanted to write it off because they didn’t—so on his behalf we had to do that kind of business. It wasn’t necessarily a lead-pipe cinch we were going to win. We almost didn’t.\n\nRhodes\n\nGoing into the general election, I’m curious to hear you talk about what the campaign or how the campaign perceived [Albert, Jr.] Gore as a candidate and how for education Gore didn’t have a strong background but [William J.] Clinton did. So Gore was trying to pick up on what Clinton had been pitching and trying to do. How did you and other folks working on domestic policy see Gore and try to develop policy in order to put forward the best campaign?\n\nSpellings\n\nI’ve been involved in two gubernatorial campaigns for him and two Presidential campaigns, and the thing about George Bush that is true throughout is that we worried less about the other candidate and more about ourselves. What we were going to do is say what we were about and not engage—it was more offensive than defensive. Absolutely that was true with Ann Richards.\n\nThat’s his orthodoxy. People wanted him to say bad things about her, he never did that. We didn’t support the Gore proposals, but that was an afterthought. It wasn’t, “We’re going to do this because they’re going to do that.”\n\nRiley\n\nDo you have any memorable trips from the campaign season, either the primaries or the—you said you made a few trips.\n\nSpellings\n\nTons from Texas days. It’s a long time ago and kind of a mish-mash. I remember traveling with his mother more than him because by the time I was traveling, although not very much with him on the campaign trail, I’d been working with him for seven years and it was just here we are and whatever.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat about the convention? Did you go to the convention?\n\nSpellings\n\nOh, hell, yes. That was a nightmare. You know what happened?\n\nRiley\n\nNo, I don’t know.\n\nSpellings\n\nTommy Thompson, God bless him, was the chairman of the platform committee. This is where we had some issues with our old friends on the right. I thought, Isn’t this great, got a new outfit, here we are. I’ve never been to Pennsylvania. Not really, of course; I’d been to Pennsylvania. Sitting in the convention center thinking this was just going to be a pro forma little deal. Well, we proceed to watch the—and we were so worried about abortion that all the Bush loyalists were stacked onto the health committee, and we were going to not have any eruptions on the health committee. There had been nary a peep over anything we’d been talking about in education.\n\nI’m sitting in the front row; Sally Lovejoy is staffing the thing. [Charles] Chip Pickering was supposed to chair the thing, but his flight had been delayed. So Bill Frist happened to wander through—anyway, the wheels came completely off and they were like, “We’re not for any of this crap.” In fact, our campaign platform says—it was 180 degrees different from what we adopted last time. “What in the hell is this?”\n\nRhodes\n\nDidn’t they want to put the plank to abolish the Department of Education in there?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes. Not only did they want to put that back in, but they wanted to gut a lot of the policy pieces of our agenda. Needless to say, I sprang up out of my chair. I didn’t even know Bill Frist really except to say, “You’ve got to come in here and help us get this thing back on track.” He did the best he could at the committee level, and we had some parliamentary maneuver to hit pause.\n\nThen it ended up having to get restored in the full committee with Tommy Thompson at the helm with a big lobbying effort with the platform committee. Within 24 hours the whole thing was buttoned back up and good to go. But, yes, that was the convention.\n\nThe other role I had there was to make the rounds to various delegations and sort of sell the—I remember going to the Ohio delegation, Sandy Kress was up there too and we were tag-teaming Nina Rees. We’d go around selling Republicans on the Bush education stuff. Little did I know that was a harbinger of things to come.\n\nRiley\n\nHow did the platform get in the condition it was in? Who was the guilty party?\n\nSpellings\n\nI don’t know. The platform committee had bought into our stuff. It was all there, and all they had to do was affirm it. But then people didn’t pay enough attention to this committee. They put the right-wingers on the education committee so the right-wingers would not be on the health committee.\n\nRiley\n\nOK, got you.\n\nNelson\n\nWho were they? Clearly this would have been a huge story.\n\nSpellings\n\nPhyllis Schlafly for starters was there.\n\nJones\n\nThat’s a starter.\n\nSpellings\n\nAnd she was at the second convention too.\n\nNelson\n\nSo she, and those who were working with her on this, must have known that if she succeeded it would be a huge national story: “Republican Platform Rejects Nominees’ Main Issue.”\n\nSpellings\n\nRight.\n\nJones\n\nIt was covered at the time.\n\nSpellings\n\nIt was definitely covered at the time. I don’t even want to know how it all went down, but somehow it took care of itself.\n\nRiley\n\nWere you the principal involved in repairing the damage here or are you calling on others?\n\nSpellings\n\nAt this point we have a political and parliamentary problem that I don’t know anything about solving. So Karl and Josh, Tommy Thompson, Bill Frist. I don’t think Chuck Pickering, who was supposed to be our chairman, ever did show up. He was totally on board with the Bush thing and was a bona fide conservative, so his job was to manage the process and he never showed up. That was how I think it got derailed in the first place.\n\nNelson\n\nWere you involved during the nominating campaign in debate prep or speech preparation?\n\nSpellings\n\nSpeech prep and the speechwriting, absolutely. Debate, no. Remember we had cooked the policy stuff. There was no primary, so it came out pretty early. Bush had said everything he was going to say about education probably by year end.\n\nNelson\n\nYear-end meaning ’99?\n\nSpellings\n\nEnd of ’99, with a few tweaks and responsive-type things. But he had laid out his vision by then.\n\nNelson\n\nSo the speech prep you were involved in was in ’99 rather than the primary campaign itself?\n\nSpellings\n\nI need my book to look at the dates of the speeches. But my recollection is it was the summer after he announced. I think the first speech he made was on education. It was in Los Angeles.\n\nNelson\n\nA lot of Governors who run for President find their first experience with speechwriters is as a candidate. Clinton was that way, [Jimmy] Carter was that way, they never dealt with speechwriters. Bush, in developing speeches, was that a smooth process weaving together the writers with policy people with the candidate himself?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, he had a lot of practice as a Governor. We got upgraded speechwriters when he started running for President. Josh brokered all that. We certainly saw iterations and did corrections and wanted to have the right point of emphasis and stuff. I didn’t see that as a problem at all.\n\nRiley\n\nI promised I was going to get you a break before lunch so why don’t we do that?\n\nM. Spellings, 8/5-6/2010 2\n\n[BREAK]\n\nSpellings\n\nKaren was there at the beginning but she left early. Dan Bartlett left early; Karl Rove left early. Josh Bolten.\n\nRiley\n\nDoes Condi count?\n\nKuzmich\n\nNo, because she left—\n\nJones\n\nNot as Governor.\n\nRiley\n\nBut who was doing the consultations?\n\nSpellings\n\nNot from him, only in Labor.\n\nRiley\n\nFollowing up on Mike’s question, can you talk a little bit about how the process of integrating the non-Texans with the Texans went? Was that hard?\n\nSpellings\n\nDuring the campaign?\n\nRiley\n\nMostly during the course of the campaign, but we can carry it over into the administration too.\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, because they came to Texas, and we just made them Texans. They had to harmonize with us as opposed to the other way around. I know this sounds crazy, but it was sort of the place to be. If you were a national operative worth your salt you were trying to get to Austin, Texas. There was some difference not having a Presidential campaign headquartered in Washington, D.C., the center of the universe, to have it in Austin. It was a little unorthodox in that way too.\n\nIt was Josh and Joel [Kaplan] and Ken Mehlman and Maria Cino and Mary Matalin. It was all people Bush had known for a long time. That was the other thing, these are known players to a lot of us. It went fine and dandy actually.\n\nRiley\n\nAnybody have any more questions about the campaign that you want to delve into?\n\nJones\n\nJust a general question of what happens to the policy people during the campaign. The scenario is pretty well set as far as the speeches and all that sort of thing. So what did you—?\n\nSpellings\n\nIt turned into debate prep. Josh ended up being the king of all that. You’ll see when you talk to Josh, he’s such an influential and weighty character, period, that even though he was the head of the policy shop, the policy apparatus was not like the afterburner of the spaceship, it continued to be very integral.\n\nJones\n\nWhat about the selection of the Vice Presidential candidate?\n\nSpellings\n\nI remember having a conversation with Bush about that. He is still Governor of Texas while this was going on. He would have days he would come to be Governor where we would have to do state business. Vance and I, the two overlappers, were having some time with him on a bunch of state issues. We got into that conversation. I remember Vance saying something—you ought to talk to Vance. He’s a Texas person, so he’ll be part of the SMU deal, but he is important to the campaign. He said, “What about picking the picker?”\n\nBush gave him the look askance, “You figured it out” kind of thing. So that was probably in late ’99, is that right? Was it 2000?\n\nRiley\n\nWe thought it would have been 2000.\n\nSpellings\n\nI guess it was 2000, it’s all running together a bit.\n\nNelson\n\nDid your role change at all when the general election campaign began, or were you still in Texas?\n\nSpellings\n\nI was still in Texas, and it was a bit excruciating in the sense—I was a single mother at the time. I didn’t really want to go to Iowa and live in the Hampton Inn and all that kind of thing. It had lost its luster. I’d worked in other Presidential campaigns. But just to be down there alone, “Home Alone,” that’s the name of that chapter in the book. It’s the state of Texas, it’s not an inconsequential place. Through your own relationships and general moxie to act like everybody was home and we were full throttle, when in fact it was the tip of the iceberg and the iceberg was the campaign. To run state government and do press and all that.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you dodge any hardships during that period of time? You said the Democrats hadn’t created any backfires.\n\nSpellings\n\nThey really didn’t. There was Karla Faye [Tucker], a highly controversial and high-profile execution. The woman had supposedly had a faith conversion and all of that. That was probably the biggest thing. We are always executing people in Texas, you know that.\n\nRiley\n\nThat wasn’t a piece of your portfolio.\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, but it was a prominent state policy issue.\n\nNelson\n\nWhen you said “doing press” what did that involve?\n\nSpellings\n\nI say this modestly. Clay and I and Vance McMahan were the three people Bush looked to for the Texas Governor thing and to be involved generally in things that were going on for him. There was a press job. Karen was on the road but Linda Edwards, other people who were back home alone, but Karen didn’t have all the facts. So our roles became more generic than just “do education policy.” It was more “see about Texas.”\n\nNelson\n\nIn the last weekend of the campaign when the story broke about Governor Bush’s DUI [driving under the influence], was that one of the things where you were expected to step up and provide background or spin to reporters?\n\nSpellings\n\nVance did a lot of that, as the criminal justice stuff was all in his bailiwick, but yes, there was interface between the campaign and the state of Texas. That kind of stuff and defensive record and debate prep things. “Here’s an exemplar of what I’m talking about. My record in Texas.” But it was pretty darn harmonious. We would go over there for lunch a couple of times a week, right down the street.\n\nRiley\n\nSo where are you on Election Day? Election night?\n\nSpellings\n\nWhich night? [laughter]\n\nRiley\n\nThe first night.\n\nSpellings\n\nWe laughed, we cried. Oh, gosh, I vividly remember this night, of course. My daughter Mary, my oldest child, was then probably 12 or 13 years old. We were in the center of history. We thought we were going to win, of course. We were preparing for a big party. There was a sort of VIP gathering. Downtown Austin from the Capitol to the campaign is a short urban area that you can easily walk. So the party was probably over 10 city blocks. We thought we had won, and then we thought we lost. It was just a blur. After we lost Mary and I went home because she was a little child, so I was not at the mansion all night.\n\nThen I woke up to the whole beginning of the however-many-day journey it was. How many days was it?\n\nRhodes\n\nThirty-five.\n\nSpellings\n\nI was going to say 45, it felt like 45. That was surreal. To show up and be at the state of Texas and the Governor of Texas in the eye of the storm. There are a bunch of funny stories about all that.\n\nThis didn’t happen to me, but lawyers were dispatched immediately to get down to Florida. Joel Kaplan has the funniest story of all. Kevin Martin, who was the general counsel of the campaign, calls Joel and says, “Get down to such-and-such county.” He was literally leaving to drive back to D.C., and he got a call at the Dallas Airport, “Park your car at the Dallas Airport, get on a plane, and get over there.”\n\nSo he did. They get local counsel in Florida from the Bush team, and of course the trial lawyers are all with the Gore team. The first thing they do is have some kind of hearing before a judge. The judge says, “OK, everybody who is licensed to practice, I’m going to go ahead and just give you a waiver or whatever to practice in Florida, to practice in fill-in-the-blank county. Anybody have a problem with that?” Joel Kaplan raises his hand and says, “May I address the bench” The judge said, “Whatever it is, why don’t you just tell us?” Joel said, “I’m not licensed to practice.” He said, “Oh, yes, I’ll just give you a waiver, you can practice in Florida now.” He goes, “I’m not licensed at all.”\n\nThe judge said, “Did you go to law school?” He said, “Yes, sir, I did.” “Which law school?” “Harvard.” “Have you ever sat for the bar?” “No, I intend to.” The judge said, “That’s good enough.”\n\nAnd Joel literally just sat for the bar after he left the administration. He’s a Harvard lawyer who never sat for the bar. There are a lot of wild west stories like that.\n\nRiley\n\nWe love wild west stories like that.\n\nSpellings\n\nThe PS [postscript] to the story is that Joel proceeds to be there for 35 days, and then he goes back to Dallas to get his own car from the airport parking lot, and it was literally $1,200 or something to get his car out.\n\nJones\n\nBut he didn’t dare represent himself to challenge.\n\nSpellings\n\nI think he sent the bill to the campaign. At that point we’d won, and we knew we could pay it.\n\nRiley\n\nSo you’re in Texas the whole time.\n\nSpellings\n\nI’m in Texas the whole time until the transition starts, of course, and the transition started before the actual victory. Clay Johnson, as you know, led that. Most of December we were up here in our headquarters.\n\nRiley\n\nUp here being Washington?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, Washington. We had two headquarters, the one that was by Dulles Airport, which was our first one. I do remember Cheney being highly involved in everything. He and Clay did not have the happiest of relationships. That just didn’t get any better.\n\nRiley\n\nWhy was that?\n\nSpellings\n\nClay knows George Bush and he is a tactical, linear, get it done guy. If we say the competencies for the job are X and we need Mr. X, we don’t care if he contributed to Ronald Reagan or not. Cheney is much more political.\n\nRiley\n\nSure.\n\nSpellings\n\nI’ll never forget when it came to picking the Secretary of Education. This is going to be the whole redacted part.\n\nRiley\n\nNot redacted, held.\n\nSpellings\n\nSuspended.\n\nRiley\n\nHeld, suspended.\n\nSpellings\n\nI don’t know if you suspend it or not, maybe this ought to get all told. But it was really fascinating. We were trying to figure out No Child Left Behind. We knew education was going to be the first thing up, and Josh was emphatic that we have a bill draft, which was a joke. We weren’t ever going to have a bill draft. We’d be lucky if we had the semblance of something that went from a campaign speech into something you can reasonably hand off to the Congress and stay involved with.\n\nSo education first up, that was our first mission. Needless to say, I was involved in the selection of the Secretary of Education, and we had all kinds of names including Floyd Flake, the Congressman from New York. Cheney was pushing hard for him because the conservatives liked him and he was very much a choice guy, African American Congressman and so on. I went for the who, what, where. We did a criminal check, and his background came back that was quite unsavory and that was the end of it. But Cheney kept pushing. I think there was a DUI and bounced checks. Things like that. It wasn’t homicide or anything like that, but some warts on old Floyd that made him not the ideal choice.\n\nThere was a lot of negotiating around all that. Karl thought we ought to—I’ll never forget. This is the first time I heard the words a “movement conservative” in the Cabinet. A lot of things had been filled out, and we got to how many chairs remained around the Cabinet table that were filled, and we still didn’t have any movement conservative. We had Justice open, we had Education open, whatever the last four or so were to be filled because everything else was all teed up. I was worried we were going to have a “movement conservative” in Education. But the movement conservative went to the Justice Department and at the end of the day, I knew he wasn’t a movement conservative, but the John Ashcroft story has turned out to be quite interesting.\n\nRhodes\n\nI have a follow-up question. Was there any talk about or push for a stalwart’s moment in history, any indication like Bill Bennett or Lamar Alexander? Did those names come up or were there people—because these were in history, the conservative movement and ties to Reagan.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes. Bush was and maybe even is still sensitive about—he doesn’t want 41 retreads, especially at that level. This was not going to be your daddy’s administration. I think he was very mindful of that.\n\nNelson\n\nWhere did Rod [Roderick] Paige’s name come from, and was he your candidate?\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, he was. I knew him and he was brought into what we were trying to do in the whole Texas deal. But it was really late in the process. The campaign finally ends and they move immediately out of the Austin headquarters. There were two—the transition office, the temporary one that we were paying for before we moved into the official government transition deal. Clay and I met with Rod on Christmas Eve or December 23rd, down in the moved-out transition, previously Bush headquarters. It was like the Whos in Whoville and the Grinch comes and takes everything out of the house and there’s just one little light bulb hanging down. It was literally like that, a war zone, and we’re interviewing a potential Cabinet member there.\n\nGod bless Clay Johnson for being the one to lift Paige because I didn’t want it to seem like it was like a whole lot of just home cooking for Margaret, I was getting my person, my operative. Clay thought that was great. Of course, we didn’t have a suitable alternative, we honestly didn’t. So we got Rod Paige.\n\nRhodes\n\nHe was a Texas person. Was he a Bush person? Did Bush have much interaction with him?\n\nSpellings\n\nCertainly Bush knew him. I wouldn’t say he was—and whoever wrote that big Houston–Austin Mafia thing, that was the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard, who is that guy? I know it’s not you, Chuck? [Ed. note: Peter Brewton] Who is that? I wouldn’t know him if I fell over him, I never heard of him. Anyway he’s writing the definitive word on how this goes down. But you are going to have the definitive word.\n\nThey knew each other. Rod Paige is a wonderful, sweet, kind human being. He’s not somebody who relates interpersonally very well, and Bush is the opposite of that. So they never had a particularly—it was cordial and pleasant. There was no animus or anything, but it wasn’t like a gee-haw kind of thing.\n\nJones\n\nI’ve forgotten whether he had any experience in Washington.\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, he did not have any.\n\nRiley\n\nIs your own portfolio during the course of the transition restricted to education?\n\nSpellings\n\nI’ll never forget the day that Clay Johnson—I’m sitting in my office. This is in the waning days of the Texas Governor business. We won, I’m cleaning out my desk, and Clay comes in and says, “Andy Card wants to talk to you.”\n\nI had met Andy Card. This is election night, real election night. Andy had already been selected. He wanted to meet me. So Andy Card and Joe and Diane Allbaugh and I had dinner, the first time I met Andy. He had not been announced as Chief of Staff at this point. Clay Johnson comes and says, “Andy wants to talk to you.” I said, “About what?” He said, “I think they’re going to ask you to be the Domestic Policy Advisor.” I said, “You’ve got to be kidding me.”\n\nI was thinking maybe I would go to D.C., maybe I wouldn’t even go and maybe I could be the education chick. I was just stunned when Andy did call. This is classic. Maybe you’ve heard this story because Karen has written it. He starts, “The President wants you to be the Domestic Policy Advisor, but I just want to tell you something. You will never see your children. Washington is a meat grinder. It’s the most painful—” He just went on and on about how awful it was going to be. He gave Karen Hughes the same treatment. So Karen and I compared notes and said, “Oh, my God, there’s no way we can do this, we’re just going to have to stay behind. We can’t.”\n\nKaren was going to see the President that day and she said, “I’m just going to tell Bush that this is not for us, and of course you can talk to him after.” So she did. The next thing I know Andy Card gets a call from Bush saying, “Are you running off the mothers?” Then Andy Card calls back sheepishly and says, “I was just trying to make sure you knew what all was involved.” Needless to say, the mothers did not get run off, and we went to Washington.\n\nRiley\n\nBut during the period of the transition, up until that point, your emphasis was entirely on education.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, because it was going to be the first thing up. Literally, the first day on the job, the first week on the job, we’ve got to have some stuff. We’ve got to have some meetings and some people and some paper and some Members of Congress and I don’t know how the hell we got through that. I remember Beth Ann Bryan and I were bumbling around the White House and kind of backed into the Oval Office. We looked around and, “I think this is the Oval Office.” On that side door, not going through the front door. This is before any kind of staff secretary stuff or processing. It was crazy.\n\nRiley\n\nI just want to bear down here to be sure that during the transition, your education portfolio included everything, personnel as well as the development of this piece of legislation that is coming up.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, you bet. Paige was getting confirmed and bringing his staff and his chief of staff and various people he wanted to bring from Houston, all that.\n\nRiley\n\nCan you say anything more about the business of getting that blueprint ready during the period of the transition, the legislation that is a roadmap rather than something that is—?\n\nJones\n\nAnd along with that your contacts with the outgoing administration.\n\nSpellings\n\nOK, two great questions. We had a transition team, which you have in here, obviously the high-falutin’ types, and then we had a working team and Sandy and I and Sarah Youssef were the main writers and drivers, and we farmed out various pieces of it. Have you seen that document? I need to get you that too. Was it called the blueprint?\n\nKuzmich\n\nI think it was called the blueprint.\n\nRiley\n\nI’m pretty sure it was.\n\nKuzmich\n\nIt was an outline.\n\nSpellings\n\nIt was an outline, but it had enough substance to say how things would work. It was notionally pretty complete. It wasn’t legislative language, but it talked about how often things would be done and how long the timeframes would be. It was almost an executive summary for a piece of legislation without the legislation.\n\nRiley\n\nRight.\n\nSpellings\n\nSo we had to develop that and have it ready basically for Day One. It strikes me, I’m only thinking about this now, the first big push Bush made when he ran for President was on education, and the first thing he did when he was President was education. I think that speaks to a couple of things. One is his level of comfort. We wanted him and needed him to show well right out of the box, have command of the subject, intensity of personal feeling about it, authenticity. We had all of that.\n\nJones\n\nSo that was the first week.\n\nSpellings\n\nLiterally that first day on the job, that first week on the job. During that first week, you can pull the schedules we had, I can’t remember which thing was on which day but we had the so-called big four, the leading Members of Congress come over. We had them over for a movie—I need to tell you that story. We went to a school in Anacostia with key staff and the leadership and the First Lady, we met with the principal of the school with everybody in tow. I can’t remember that we ever did that again. It was highly unusual to have that sort of thing happen.\n\nWe had a thing in the Roosevelt Room with the preeminent reading researchers. Every single day that week was education something or other.\n\nKuzmich\n\nYou should mention the meeting.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, before all of that he hosted a lunch in Austin with leading legislative influencers and legislators at the Governor’s Mansion.\n\nRiley\n\nExplicitly on education.\n\nSpellings\n\nExplicitly on education. It was George Miller and John Boehner and [Johnny] Isakson, and you can find the names, but not Ted Kennedy. Judd Gregg was there, not Jim Jeffords.\n\nRiley\n\nYou’re putting this meeting together?\n\nSpellings\n\nI’m putting the substance of the meeting together. Actually, Judd Gregg, who was Bush’s debate partner, he was the Al Gore. He’s from New Hampshire, as you all know. They’d known each other for a long time. If you run for President you spend some time in New Hampshire. They have a good personal relationship and did have for a long time. So he trusted Judd to figure out the right legislative types who ought to be included.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nSpellings\n\nHe knew Boehner less well, had campaigned with Boehner, but he deferred to Judd, that’s how he got the invitation list. I had nothing to do with, “Let’s not invite Ted Kennedy” or whatever.\n\nRiley\n\nSo what happens at the meeting?\n\nSpellings\n\nGeorge Miller sits next to Bush. There are probably three tables of eight, something like that, there were about 25 people. Bush got up and made a speech about how much he believed in this stuff; how passionate he was. He showed immediately his command of the subject and his passion for the subject. The nation had just come through this divisive and intense election. He got that. “Here’s a place where we can come together. It is important that we’re part of showing our country working and healing. Let’s get to work.”\n\nHe sat next to Miller. Miller was very impressed and very forward leaning. I remember, not really even thinking, what do I know about Washington? Obviously I knew that Ted Kennedy was going to be important. Why wasn’t he there, why wasn’t Jeffords there? For some reason that never occurred to me, but it became abundantly clear that we were going to need to get him involved.\n\nIt was basically a good will, “I mean business, I’m going to be bipartisan. I’m really serious about this stuff.” It was interactive too. They talked about how they tried to reauthorize it twice and they couldn’t get it done, and it was going to be helpful to have the Republicans be part of the solution and not part of the problem and all of that. “We need you, Mr. President, to get your team in line.” That was true too. So that was all fine and dandy, and we had good feelings coming into Washington to work on it.\n\nRiley\n\nBut this is where the signals are beginning to emanate that choice is not a crucial piece of the package? Does it happen this early?\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, not that early.\n\nRhodes\n\nI was curious to hear you discuss the dynamic with Gregg and Boehner because historically Gregg had a pretty conservative legislative record.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes.\n\nRhodes\n\nBoehner hadn’t previously been largely involved in education, but in the Republican revolution he had been on the train to abolish the Department of Education.\n\nSpellings\n\nRight.\n\nRhodes\n\nSo how did that play out?\n\nSpellings\n\nWhat had just happened was that Boehner had been spurned as part of the leadership and the booby prize was the chairman of the Education Committee, which he was like, “You’ve got to be kidding me.” He didn’t like any of this stuff. I’ve said this this week, Arne Duncan was running around talking about it. They’re going to have a reauthorization some time. Baloney. They’re not. You have to make the politics right. George Bush ran on education as one of his key pillars. We spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising, organizing, and everything else. He campaigned with all these people, literally every dang Member of the Congress practically stood on a platform with him, and while he was talking about education he brought along—Left to their own devices Republicans are not dialed in to closing the achievement gap. That’s not where they live. It’s not that they didn’t get there, but it wasn’t an accident. Absolutely it wasn’t an accident.\n\nAnd Judd, in fact they came a long way from where they started. We used to joke about it. When John Boehner cries these giant tears about how it is the most important legislation of his career—no kidding, right?\n\nKuzmich\n\nYes.\n\nSpellings\n\nFrom someone who started out adamantly opposed.\n\nNelson\n\nI’m interested that with an issue so important to Bush, the choice of the Education Secretary came toward the end, that it was regarded as one of those offices that might be implied for filling a slot, a conservative slot. That even though this was going to involve a major legislative initiative, you chose somebody who had no Washington experience.\n\nSpellings\n\nTwo things I would say about that. With all modesty, I think he thought, Margaret is going to take care of whatever needs to happen on that. So we had a level of comfort. And on our side of the aisle the only kind of Republicans you can find are those who want to abolish the damn place. Seriously, who are we going to get? Somebody with a criminal record or someone who wants to abolish the thing or a Texan?\n\nNelson\n\nSo the assumption was that this was going to be driven out of the White House. Development of the bill.\n\nSpellings\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nNelson\n\nSelling the bill.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nAnd was Rod Paige seen as somebody who would be really good at implementing the bill?\n\nSpellings\n\nFirst of all, starting an agency and getting your act together and getting stepped up and confirmed—You remember the tail end of the Clinton administration they put all those regulations in place. The Department of Education hadn’t had a clean audit in a dozen years. It was a mess, a real mess. So Paige’s job was to go over and set up shop and start cleaning up the place and staffing. What do we have, what do we not have? What are these regulations that were just dark-of-night stuff? The meat-and-potatoes stuff. It was always that we were going to run the policy out of the White House.\n\nNelson\n\nWhen it came to the choice of assistant secretaries and so on of Education did you defer to Paige or did you develop those nominees yourself?\n\nSpellings\n\nMore the latter than the former but not solely. Gene Hickok was, to the extent the conservatives were unhappy—it’s not that they were unhappy with Paige, but we picked a traditional educator. Here’s why we picked Paige. He was a traditional educator pretty much. Former dean of an ed school, superintendent.\n\nRhodes\n\nThe Texans were not unhappy with him, right?\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, and that’s for the SMU people to find out about. But we saw somebody who could sell the soap to the establishment in a very credible way. He’d done the stuff in Houston, he was African American, he closed the achievement gap. He believed all this. For real. It wasn’t a fake thing, and he was running the fifth-largest school district in the country.\n\nJones\n\nWas there ever a point at which you were considered initially?\n\nSpellings\n\nNot that I’m aware of, nor would I have been the right person. I wouldn’t have been the right person at the time.\n\nJones\n\nYou didn’t think about it?\n\nSpellings\n\nHell, no, I wanted to be at the White House. That’s where the action was and where we were going to do the stuff.\n\nJones\n\nYou were going to say something about that transition period and the work during that time, having contacts with the Clinton administration, the Department of Education?\n\nSpellings\n\nOh, yes. It was after we moved from the Bush/Cheney transition that we paid for to the one the government paid for. I called Bruce Reed and went over and saw him, John Bridgeland and I did together. John was going to be my deputy, and we spent an hour or so with Bruce, maybe it was longer than that. Saw the office. Bruce is a delightful human being. It was a tomb over there, as you might imagine. But he was very forthcoming with advice. Then when I was named, I called all my predecessors. I called Jim Pinkerton, talked to a bunch of them. Said, “What advice do you have?”\n\nNelson\n\nReed was obviously a major DLC figure who I’m sure had been paying attention.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes, we talked about it of course.\n\nNelson\n\nDid he say, “I like what I think you’re going to be trying to do in this”?\n\nSpellings\n\nHe was very affirmative personally and couldn’t have been nicer. We did talk about some of the commonalities. He gave me, it’s tradition, but Gordon Liddy had started it. You probably know this story, a bottle of scotch for the Domestic Policy Advisor and you leave it for your successor? Bruce Reed gave me the scotch at the time. He also showed me the office where Bruce was and I was. I don’t know if that’s still the Domestic Policy Office today. Is that where Melody Barnes is?\n\nKuzmich\n\nI think it is.\n\nSpellings\n\nPrior to 9/11 you used to be able to go through this little storage closet in your office and there’s a window and a little ladder and you could climb out onto the roof of the West Wing. You could go up there and wander around, have a cocktail, have the greatest view of the city.\n\nRiley\n\nWith a bottle of scotch.\n\nSpellings\n\nSo we wandered out onto the roof. After 9/11 when they put the sharpshooters out there they closed it down. There was a “hometown girl makes good” story in the Austin American Statesman with a picture of me standing on the roof.\n\nRiley\n\nWe missed that in the briefing books. How did John Bridgeland become your assistant? Was that your choice or did Andy or others designate?\n\nSpellings\n\nI’m going to say he was not my choice. He wasn’t my choice. The staffing of the White House, both at the assistant and the deputy level, was somebody’s master plan. Of course I knew Bridge from the campaign and was thrilled to have him, loved him to death. That seemed like a great idea. What I had and knew was not what he had and knew, and we were a great team.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat did he know? What were your differences?\n\nSpellings\n\nHe had been on the Hill, worked for Rob Portman and had the D.C. pedigree, which I did not. I knew George Bush better and had the President’s trust and confidence. So we were a great team. I was just a girl from Texas, I didn’t know all the niceties that it mattered where you park and people’s titles and all of that. I remember Bridge being quite insistent about, he wanted to be my deputy, that was all fine and dandy, but he also wanted to have the title, a “tiara” as Josh Bolten called it at the time and I still remember that phraseology, of the chairman of the Domestic Policy Council.\n\nThe Domestic Policy Council per se is an act of fiction. It is a structure, but it is not something like you meet as a body and decide stuff. So, fine.\n\nRiley\n\nThat explains that, because it is a bit of a mystery trying to read through the materials that are available, some of which are in the book and some are not, about exactly what the structure was there. From the outside you’re trying to see what the structure—\n\nSpellings\n\nI remember this, Josh had it on our do list. Bridge and I, good Lord, it was like being in a foxhole together. We had to hire staff. Josh kept hammering on us about getting the Clinton executive orders re-up’ed and modified or tweaked or whatever we were going to have done with them to create our Policy Council. It was months. Of course Bridge had the action on that because he was a lawyer. What we did was basically re-upped the Clinton structure, which worked fine. The only thing that’s material about the thing is what bucket an issue goes into. Is it a domestic matter or is it an NEC [National Economic Council] matter?\n\nBecause of Mark McClellan’s role we had the healthy part of Health, so we had flu—the flu was nothing at the time, but we had AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] and we had diseases, and they had Medicare and Medicaid. They had Medicare and Medicaid and we had everything else.\n\nNelson\n\nIn the health area.\n\nSpellings\n\nAnd domestic policy.\n\nNelson\n\nWere there any other—\n\nSpellings\n\nThere were arguments about what to do with the environmental crowd. They ended up with us. Not arguments, there were discussions about that. There were things you could easily slice or dice. Social Security was sort of—There were some things we shared a little bit. The technology stuff ended up at NEC, probably should have been with us. NASA [National Aeronautics & Space Administration] was with us, you could argue—so it was just what bucket this stuff should go in.\n\nNelson\n\nCard tells you that you won’t see your children, Bush says something to indicate you will. In practice is Card describing the job accurately? Do you get to go home at night?\n\nSpellings\n\nMy children were in school, so this is January and I have two sisters who live in D.C. I commuted back and forth to Austin to let my kids finish out the school year in that last semester, that January-to-May time frame. I went home every weekend or sometimes every other weekend, they were with their dad. It worked out pretty well in the sense that they weren’t getting disrupted and I could be all White House all the time and get my bearings. Those were the days when we’d show up at the White House at 6:00 or 6:30 in the morning, 7:30 senior staff meeting every single morning. We’d get there around 6:30 and start to sort through so you’d have something to say at 7:30. I left usually around 9, 10 o’clock at night.\n\nWe worked, in the early days, half a day on Saturday, until noon. So Saturday afternoon was your only day to get to the dry cleaners and so on. Holly, I don’t know if you remember this story, but one time I had not been to the cleaners at all. I was there on a Saturday, not having gone home, and George H. W. Bush was wandering around the White House for some reason. He was in town visiting his son. I hadn’t been to the cleaners, and the only clothes I had to wear was a pair of leather pants. This was 10 years ago, so I was a little cuter and a little slimmer then. So there I am in my leather pants, and of course you always stand up when the President of the United States comes in. I’m like, Oh no, I have to stand up in these leather pants. I stood up behind the desk hoping he wouldn’t notice. Of course he did and said, “Man, you’re looking pretty foxy today.” He probably doesn’t remember it, but I digress.\n\nJones\n\nMaybe he does.\n\nRhodes\n\nYou said you had some interesting or funny stories to say about romancing Democrats on NCLB.\n\nSpellings\n\nWe need to talk about that baby, and then we need to talk about [Joseph] Lieberman and [Evan] Bayh. That first week we had a movie night with all the important Members of Congress and their spouses. Miller came with his wife, and Kennedy and Vicki [Kennedy] came and Boehner. We had hotdogs and hamburgers, very informal. Then we went to the White House movie theater, and the movie was Thirteen Days, about the Cuban Missile Crisis. And the whole thing, if you’ve seen the movie, is basically in the Oval Office.\n\nHere we are at the White House movie theater; down the hall you can see past the colonnade toward the Oval Office. George Bush and Ted Kennedy were sitting in the front row together, watching this story about JFK [John Fitzgerald Kennedy], the brother of, in the White House, the Oval Office. And I thought, What in the hell am I doing here? It was surreal. Can you imagine?\n\nWe had to get Kennedy motivated to move on education. There was this, “I didn’t get invited to that lunch—” I don’t know that we overtly thought it would work out like this at the time, we just thought we had to get started some way or another. So Joe Lieberman, who had been hugely Mr. DLC and had gone into a lot of this stuff and was very receptive to a lot of these ideas, and Evan Bayh created a little bit of a rump group and they started working. Holly can say more about this because she was more party to the actual guts of it, but Kennedy got wind of all of this and he was not—\n\nKuzmich\n\nWe’d meet in the evening. In the day we’d negotiate with Kennedy and the committee and then in the evening we’d have this sort of—\n\nSpellings\n\nThe rump group.\n\nKuzmich\n\nThe rump group. Who no one knew was meeting.\n\nSpellings\n\nThen Kennedy got word of it, and it kicked him into high gear because he was not to be upstaged by some rump group, and we were off to the races.\n\nNelson\n\nSo he wasn’t so offended by his exclusion from various things that he decided to stomp on this. Instead he said—\n\nSpellings\n\nHe said, “I’ll take that mantle.”\n\nNelson\n\nThat’s interesting.\n\nSpellings\n\nYes.\n\nNelson\n\nWho knew enough about Kennedy to know that is how he would be likely to respond instead of responding in a very antagonistic way because he’d been snubbed?\n\nSpellings\n\nParticularly after the whole lunch incident?\n\nNelson\n\nYes.\n\nSpellings\n\nI don’t know that Nick Calio knew him well enough. Bush—and part of this was going on—so that’s the sort of staff skulduggery going on, but meanwhile back at the ranch Bush and Kennedy had had some interaction at this point. This is where some of this choice stuff comes into play. The first time they’re in the Oval Office together, and being there just personally and seeing this firsthand I should write about this in my own voice at some point. But seeing them start to establish a trust relationship, kind of lean forward and say, “Can we work together?” That happens say on Monday. Wednesday night it’s the movies. Thursday we’re at the school together. So for Ted Kennedy to be at three Bush-organized education things the first week on the job after this horrible campaign and after all this, he was giving him the benefit of the doubt. If there are any political dynasties in our country it’s those.\n\nNelson\n\nThat’s true.\n\nSpellings\n\nWhen they met in the Oval Office, and I think this was really important to Kennedy, Bush said, “OK, we’re going to let the press in for a little photo.” It wasn’t a press conference or anything like that, it was just a photo release. For the amateur newbie President two days on the job saying, “OK, the only thing the press is going to want to know is are you going to agree on vouchers or have you thrown vouchers over or whatever about vouchers. They’re going to ask and here’s what I’m going to say. I’m going to say we’ve had a collegial, constructive, productive meeting and we’re going to work together.” In other words, I’m not going to take the bait. I’m not going to grandstand; I’m not going to whatever. He didn’t say, “I suggest you do the same” or anything like that, it was just, “Here’s what I’m going to do.”\n\nI think Kennedy respected that, and he didn’t take the bait either. So when he went out into the sticks afterward, I was following him out there, he just said, “It’s a great start.”\n\nRiley\n\nI know we’ve got to watch the time, we’ve only got about five minutes, but you had known Governor Bush for a long time and we really haven’t, other than this point on Kennedy, focused very much attention on him during the transition. As a result of the Florida events, to get a picture of how he’s responding to this. Are you watching a man who is in personal transition here?\n\nSpellings\n\nDefinitely.\n\nRiley\n\nIs he trying to figure out, “How do I become President at the moment I’m being inaugurated?” Can you walk us through this a little bit?\n\nSpellings\n\nDefinitely. Obviously he had advice from his dad, from Andy Card, from pros around who had done it. But I think what Bush instinctively knew or had figured out by virtue of all this advice was that the thing to do was to own it, to be the President. Remember the whole Clinton stealing the W’s and having pizza parties and wearing jeans in the White House. We were going to respect the office and the honor of the office, and it connoted a humility that this is bigger than me. He did understand his place in history and the need to heal and the need to balance using political capital for some end, getting some things done, accomplishing some things. He didn’t want to be just a wet blanket. But also understand that he had to do some things that demonstrated that bringing together.\n\nJones\n\nMy impression is that did not just begin with his finally having won.\n\nSpellings\n\nYou’re right.\n\nJones\n\nHe thought about it. Let’s start when the election itself was held, on election night, he appeared, at least to me at the time, he had begun then for sure to think about himself as being President and what it meant.\n\nSpellings\n\nAbsolutely. Yes.\n\nJones\n\nThere were two photos in the New York Times right after. One is Gore playing touch football, and the other is Bush meeting with Condi Rice, Andy Card, and Cheney, I believe, and the whole notion was they had begun to think about looking forward to a transition. It was time to think Presidential. That’s my impression, I’m just asking you.\n\nSpellings\n\nNo, that’s absolutely right. I think Bush understood the time and the situation. This is what people need to know about George Bush. He’s not tone-deaf. In fact, quite the contrary. He is the most in-tune person with human beings. He could read a situation better than anybody I’ve ever known. He understood what place he was going to have to take and what he was going to have to do.\n\nRiley\n\nDid you notice any changes in him during this period?\n\nSpellings\n\nThe whole thing was excruciating in the sense of do we or don’t we and having to keep your cool. I guess he was not seen out and about all that much. Or when he went out, he was very measured and calm. Conveying that kind of persona. But, yes, you could see him coming to terms with not only being the President of the United States, which on a good day is a big deal, but in this extraordinary historic circumstance.\n\nRiley\n\nMaybe we ought to break here.\n\nSpellings\n\nWe’re going to go have our call.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nRiley\n\nOK, we’re back after lunch. I have two questions to start with. The first one is based on a conversation we had at lunch about record keeping, and this is as good a time as any to pose the question to you about whether you kept a diary, or what your own thinking was as a public official about recording your thoughts outside memos and so forth.\n\nSpellings\n\nYou’re aware that you think, Oh, my gosh, this is all historic and I ought to be doing some of that, but you’re also working 18 hours a day, and you literally have no time to do it at all. Someone gave me a mini tape recorder while I was in the White House, maybe for Christmas the first year after I got there. I remember using it one time. I came across it the other day cleaning out my car. I should listen to it. But I used it one time when we were working on immigration, which I do want to talk about as a policy thing.\n\nWe were working on immigration policy before 9/11 and if I do say modestly, if I, Margaret, have a stamp on anything, it is on immigration policy and on education.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nSpellings\n\nOne day we had a meeting. Immigration is like the opposite of education. I was telling you all the things about it like, “This is my deal, nobody bug me.” We did our own thing. We didn’t have to check with anybody but George Bush. We used to say, “We only have one vote, but it’s his.” Cheney did not like a lot of the stuff we were doing, nor did his staff—we’ll get into that. But immigration was the opposite. You have to get consensus with Colin Powell, Elaine Chao, John Ashcroft, Condi Rice, and David what’s his face who worked for Cheney.\n\nRiley\n\nAddington.\n\nSpellings\n\nAddington, how could I forget? All on the same wavelength, and it was virtually impossible. One day we had a principals meeting in my office and it was David, Ashcroft, Colin Powell, Elaine Chao, I think Condi was there. We weren’t going to get there. We had totally different points of view on the matter. I took out my little recorder on the way home from work that day and talked about it. That’s probably the one thing I committed to some kind of record.\n\nRiley\n\nWe’d be happy to have it transcribed for you if you’d like. We can put it as an appendix to the interview and insert it right here. But beyond that your comments off the tape have indicated that you were pretty careful about—\n\nSpellings\n\nVery careful. The only thing I would say that I have in terms of a record are speeches I gave and that kind of thing, which are sanitized to some degree, of course.\n\nRiley\n\nSure. But were you given instructions by the counsel’s office when you came in to beware of recording anything?\n\nSpellings\n\nI might not have listened to what they told me anyway, but they probably did tell me. We had all these rules about the Staff Secretary and stuff like that. We never followed them on something. We were not supposed to share things with agencies. How could they do their work? It was ridiculous for us not to involve the people responsible. If you trust them enough to be running these government agencies, you have to share stuff with them. There were all sorts of rules. I just didn’t think it was prudent, and I’d seen a lot of people go down with the ship because of things they’d written.\n\nNelson\n\nYou weren’t supposed to share stuff with the agencies?\n\nSpellings\n\nThis is not the Bush administration necessarily; I think it is just standard protocol. We were not to share, of course, internal White House memos. We were not to share calendars. You don’t want the President’s calendar floating around. I didn’t send them a copy, but I would call Paige once a week and say, “Here’s what’s going on.” Not just Paige but Tommy Thompson, tell them, “Hey, we’re going to have an event the second week of August. Get ready.” But with the rules we were supposed to follow, literally you call them the day before and tell them what he’s saying in the speech. It’s stupid.\n\nKuzmich\n\nWe weren’t supposed to share speeches.\n\nSpellings\n\nWe weren’t supposed to share speeches. Then what really irritated me when I got on the other side of the aisle was when they would start to follow the rules and then someone would find other ways. I’m like, “I know about those rules.”\n\nNelson\n\nIf the President was going to give a speech on education policy the Secretary of Education wasn’t given an opportunity to look at it in advance?\n\nSpellings\n\nNo.\n\nNelson\n\nMuch less offer suggestions.\n\nSpellings\n\nOfficially, no. But I would certainly share it with the people I thought needed to have it, yes.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd the rules are coming from the Chief of Staff or from the Staff Secretary? You mentioned the Staff Secretary a couple of times.\n\nSpellings\n\nEnforced by Staff Secretary really. General counsel and Staff Secretary more than the Chief of Staff. And likewise things about the budget.\n\nKuzmich\n\nRight.\n\nSpellings\n\nBudget development. Good Lord. And it frankly doesn’t serve the Presidency or the President very well to have that kind of ridiculous ignorance.\n\nJones\n\nBut the process of developing speeches or developi"
