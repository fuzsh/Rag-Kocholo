        "text": "With every step of Janine Davidson’s combined 30 years of academic, civilian and military service, she has demonstrated a commitment to excellence and the betterment of society and her community — precisely what the prestigious George Norlin Award stands for.\n\nDuring her rich career, Janine initially held many roles within the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), including deputy assistant secretary of defense for plans, where she oversaw the formulation and review of military war plans and global force posture policy. For her work, she was awarded the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service. This award recognizes outstanding service of significance to the DOD, including personal sacrifice in the performance of that service and motivation by patriotism, good citizenship and a sense of public responsibility.\n\nHer military service culminated as the 32nd Under Secretary of the U.S. Navy, as appointed by President Barack Obama. During that time, she planned the execution of a $900-billion, five-year budget, ensuring readiness, modernization and the health of 900,000 military and civilian personnel and their families.\n\nNow, Janine serves as president of Metropolitan State University of Denver, Colorado’s third-largest public university. In this role, she’s described as “a fierce advocate for MSU Denver’s 17,000 students,” according to nominators Gardiner Porter and Laurie Porter (Bus’88).\n\nDuring her time at MSU Denver, Janine has staunchly supported the DREAM Act and the university’s DACA students, as well as its minoritized, military and veteran students. She’s also an active steward of the processes that make our democratic society work, launching MSU Denver’s Institute for Public Service, which focuses on inspiring and preparing students for careers in government and the nonprofit sector.\n\n“She has championed the role public universities play in ‘holding the line on the American dream,’” said the Porters.\n\nIn addition to her professional achievements, Janine serves on numerous national and Denver-area boards, including with the Chair Defense Policy, Foreign Affairs Policy, UMB Financial Corp, Colorado Concern, Downtown Denver Partnership and Denver Metro Chamber Leadership Foundation.\n\nAs shared by her nominators, “Janine has demonstrated a long-lasting commitment to excellence in her professional career rising up to senior leadership positions within the U.S. Departments of Defense and Education.\n\n“Her consistent devotion to the betterment of society and our community is articulated by her devotion to our country … but also from her more recent efforts to develop high-quality, career-oriented undergraduate and graduate academic programs at MSU that serve Colorado’s communities and power its economy.”\n\nWillie L. Hill Jr.’s career has run the gamut — from sharing stages with musical icons like Dizzy Gillespie to advocating for arts to leading workshops for public school children. Through it all, Hill provided exceptional time and dedication to provide services for the communities with which he was associated.\n\nA jazz saxophonist, Hill has appeared in concert with artists such as Liza Minelli, Johnny Mathis, Sammy Davis Jr., Lou Rawls and Lena Horne. With over 45 appearances as a guest soloist with iconic big bands and as guest conductor at over 35 venues, he continues to inspire the national jazz scene.\n\nBut it’s off the stage that Hill’s impact reaches even further.\n\nHill gave generously of his time throughout his career, first serving as a teacher with Denver Public Schools and later as a professor at the CU Boulder College of Music. As director of the CU Jazz Summer Camp, he inspired generations of young people in high school and college.\n\n“I learned from and worked with Willie and saw his teaching powerfully reach generations of students,” said College of Music Dean Emeritus Daniel Sher. “I found him to be a consummate virtuoso on the saxophone, and his leadership was an inspiration to his colleagues.”\n\nThis was only the beginning of an impressive trajectory of impact. As president of the National Association for Music Educators, Hill led an organization of music educators and college student chapters — over 125,000 members. Similarly, as president of the International Association of Jazz Educators, he led 15,000 members from over 35 countries.\n\nHe has been inducted into the Colorado Music Educators Hall of Fame, Grambling State University Hall of Fame and National History Makers Organization, and he has received numerous awards and accolades, including the Benny Golson Jazz Master Award, Lawrence Berk Jazz Educator of the Year Award and DownBeat Magazine Achievement Award in Jazz Education. He is also a founder of the Rick Matterson/Clark Terry Telluride Jazz Academy and Mile High Jazz Camp in Boulder.\n\nMost recently, Hill retired from his position as director of the Fine Arts Center at the University of Massachusetts in 2019. In this role, he made a profound impact on communities by developing outreach initiatives to provide children with access, and also supported participation in music, dance, theater and the arts. Through his engaging personality, drive, energy and optimism, his participation made significant progress in the Fine Arts Center’s efforts to build community and develop the strategies and initiatives that break down cultural and societal barriers while promoting arts and culture.\n\nSaid Sher, “I heard from patrons and attendees of the events he performed in, planned or strategized that he was the kind of leader who always saw the best in people and always saw the glass as half full, no matter the challenge.”\n\nKayce Casner Anderson (EPOBio’01) had all the makings of a renowned ecologist.\n\nAfter discovering an interest in honeybee research at CU Boulder, Anderson pursued the study of insect and animal species for more than a decade. She received her doctorate in ecology and evolutionary biology at the highly selective University of California, Davis, and her research on butterflies in the Andes and California found an important correlation between declining butterfly populations and climate change.\n\n“I have no doubt that the stage was set for Kayce to have a highly productive and important career as an academic scientist,” said Michael Breed, a CU Boulder professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology who taught Anderson.\n\nBut there was much more for Anderson to accomplish — this time with humans.\n\nIn 2014, Anderson founded For the Good, which seeks out and partners with remote and disadvantaged communities in Kenya to keep girls in school.\n\n“Given a secondary education, girls earn higher incomes, have fewer and healthier children and are more likely to send their own children to school,” declares For the Good’s website.\n\nAs executive director of For the Good, Anderson uses her scientific past to drive evidence-based program approaches and evaluations. She helps open secondary schools in remote Kenyan villages; works with local political, religious and cultural leaders who can influence parents to send children to school; and targets families who may not have easy access to schooling.\n\n“Kayce feels strongly that education is a right for all people and a leverage point to address many global challenges,” said Breed.\n\nIn addition to her work abroad, Anderson — a Glenwood Springs resident — is also director of the Casner Family Foundation, which provides support for first-generation and low-income students on Colorado’s western slope.\n\nAnderson has said of her humanitarian work: “My leap from studying ecology and evolutionary biology to studying problems that keep youth out of school in Kenya might seem drastic, but it actually feels like I just changed systems as I have many times before — from research on honeybees as an undergraduate to butterfly species for my PhD to aquatic insect communities when working as a postdoc to human communities in Kenya. The driving questions in all cases have been infinitely interesting, and the process to understand them is the same.”\n\nWhen Christine Marie Arguello was a junior in high school, her classmates laughed at her aspirations to get a degree from Harvard Law School. But her English teacher, Mrs. Poplin, knew otherwise: She looked her in the eyes and said, “Chris, I know you can do it.”\n\nThe encouragement from Mrs. Poplin and others propelled Arguello to success. Her trailblazing career as a lawyer, judge, educator and public servant has consistently broken down barriers and inspired other underrepresented students to follow their dreams.\n\nAfter attending CU for a bachelor’s degree in education, Arguello graduated from Harvard Law in 1980 — the first Latina from Colorado to graduate from the prestigious program. She went on to become a private practice lawyer, tenured professor at the University of Kansas School of Law and university counsel at CU Boulder. Since 2008, she has presided as a district court judge in the U.S. District Court for the State of Colorado.\n\n“She has made a positive impact on a national scale through her service as a federal judge,” said Professor Joseph Polman from CU’s School of Education. “She has demonstrated a long-lasting commitment to excellence in her professional career and a devotion to the betterment of society and her community.”\n\nArguello has been lauded throughout her career with awards such as the 2013 Latina Trailblazer award from the Latinas First Foundation, induction into both the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame (2014) and the Colorado Latino Hall of Fame (2020), a 2020 Award of Merit from the Denver Bar Association and the 2021 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Center for Legal Inclusiveness.\n\nPerhaps her most defining characteristic, though, is her generous spirit. In 2014, she founded a Colorado-based law school pipeline program, “Law School… Yes We Can (Sí Se Puede)” to mentor underrepresented students who, like her, dream of going to law school. Since 2014, the program has delivered over 350 workshops, mentored nearly 80 fellows and facilitated 25 internships. The program has a 95% college completion rate. Two students in her program have graduated from law school, and five others are currently in law school.\n\n\"As a federal judge, [Arguello] does not have to devote her energy to these causes, does not have to pause to encourage diverse young students to pursue their dreams, and does not have to work to make the legal system better, fairer and more equitable,\" said Patrick O'Rourke, former board chair of the Center for Legal Inclusiveness, as well as executive vice chancellor and chief operating officer at CU Boulder.\n\n\"But she does, and that says everything about her.\"\n\nA 12-time Emmy Award winner with a knack for thought-provoking interviews, sportscaster Jim Gray started his fabled career at CU Boulder in the 1970s. In the 40 years since he graduated with an advertising degree, Gray has given the American sports audience a front-row seat to many classic sports moments.\n\nAlways asking the tough but fair questions, Gray has used his skilled reporting to allow anyone to experience the magic, joy and heartbreak of professional athletes on and off the court, the field or the green.\n\n“Jim Gray is a legendary figure in sports broadcasting,” said Lori Bergen, dean of the College of Media, Communication and Information. “He has been trusted by countless iconic athletes to tell their stories — of both triumph and disgrace — and Gray has had unprecedented access to the biggest names, events and moments in the last four decades of sports.”\n\nBesides his numerous Emmy wins, Gray has earned some of the most prestigious honors in sports journalism. He was inducted into four Sports Halls of Fame, including the International Boxing Hall of Fame, and was honored by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He was also named Sports Reporter of the Year three times.\n\nCurrently, he works for Showtime, Fox and SiriusXM Radio. At Sirius, Gray is the host of a weekly show alongside broadcast partner Tom Brady, the most decorated quarterback in Super Bowl history.\n\nOutside of his professional work, access to education is Gray’s most significant philanthropic priority. At CU Boulder, he and his wife, Frann, established an endowed scholarship in honor of his parents, Jerry and Lorna Gray, to benefit first-generation college students who graduate from Denver Public Schools. He participated in CMCI’s first media summit and held a public Zoom event for CU Boulder about his book, Talking to GOATs: The Moments You Remember and the Stories You Never Heard, a national bestseller published in fall 2020.\n\nIn addition to his scholarship support at CU, Jim and Frann are very active in numerous philanthropic endeavors, charities and events.\n\nOn and off screen, Gray has garnered a reputation for being an honest reporter and a trusted friend.\n\nWhen asked if he had one word to describe Gray, the legendary Kobe Bryant responded, “Honest.”\n\n“Jim interviewed me after my prolific fights. We were a sensational duo,” said acclaimed boxer Mike Tyson. “Out of the ring, Jim became my most trusted friend. He’s there no matter what and never afraid to give it to me straight. He’s always coming from a place of love and compassion. You know where you stand.”\n\nMany young minds are attracted to CU Boulder for the beauty of the mountains. For Tandean Rustandy, his decision to become a Buff came down to being able to work his first semester of college washing dishes.\n\n“I had to work right away to pay for my expenses, and I started my work-study job at the bottom — in the dining hall, washing dirty pots and pans,” said Rustandy. “I took it very seriously. Little by little, I was asked to take on more responsibility. I was asked to cook, I started working with the manager in the cafeteria and I also worked at the University Club.”\n\nRustandy’s family sacrificed greatly to send him to college, and he took his education and work in Colorado seriously. He was committed to expanding his knowledge and expertise so he could bring it back to his home country.\n\nDespite his dedication to work, finances were tight. In his junior year, Rustandy’s parents sold their house to pay for his tuition. By senior year, with that money gone, Rustandy’s roommate lent him money to pay for part of his tuition.\n\n“We are friends to this day,” said Rustandy. “I will never forget his kindness and generosity.”\n\nRustandy’s dedication and his family’s sacrifice paid off. After graduating from CU, he moved back to Indonesia and started his career in the lumber industry. In 1993 he transitioned to the ceramic tile business, developing an environmentally friendly business model that also supports local people through job placement and access to education and healthcare.\n\nHis ethical and green-focused business, PT Arwana Citramulia Tbk, now has five factories and employs 3,000 people. His lines of tile are developed specifically for low-income Indonesians; its affordability allows many families to enjoy tile flooring rather than dirt floors.\n\n“Tandean has demonstrated exceptional devotion to the betterment of society, consistent integrity and has made a transformative impact on a national and global scale,” said Sharon Matusik, dean of the Leeds School of Business. “He credits CU Boulder for teaching him entrepreneurial thinking and the importance of creating economic and social value at the same time, through thoughtful business decisions.”\n\nRustandy has given over $10 million to CU Boulder, most notably in support of the Rustandy Building connecting the Leeds School of Business and College of Engineering and Applied Science. The building celebrates its ceremonial grand opening Nov. 7, 2021. He has also partnered with Leeds to support the highest caliber of faculty as well as global career treks to bring students to Indonesia to learn about international business.\n\n“Being at CU laid the foundation for everything I would do,” he said.\n\nRustandy is unequivocal about the impact of his CU education and his commitment to paying it forward.\n\n“He is a stellar role model for our students. Throughout his professional life, he has showcased how a business can be both profitable and community minded,” said Matusik. “His tenacity, commitment to his values and unwavering dedication to education can be seen in everything that he does.”\n\nIn the early ‘90s, Tom Garfinkel (Comm’91) found himself tending bar in Chicago as a young CU graduate. Within a couple years, he was managing the place, along with two other bars.\n\nThe experience, which included negotiating beer deals and running marketing campaigns, set the stage for his entire career.\n\nThirty years later, Tom serves as vice chairman, president and CEO of the Miami Dolphins and Hard Rock Stadium and is considered a commanding voice in South Florida and the sports industry.\n\n“Without any personal fanfare, Tom Garfinkel has transformed a 33-year-old football stadium into a modern, state-of-the-art, year-round sports and entertainment facility,” said Dick Anderson, former Buffs and Dolphins football legend.\n\nSpearheaded by Tom, the Dolphins have not only renovated their stadium and increased attendance — in addition to hosting the 2020 Super Bowl — but also have expanded their charitable efforts and community outreach.\n\n“Seizing on the opportunity to educate and unify the culturally diverse South Florida community, Tom created the Football Unites program,” said Florida Senator Marco Rubio. “With more than 61 community partners, Football Unites has successfully linked organizations together, reaching and educating countless constituents.”\n\nFootball Unites, started in 2018, has several initiatives, such as “Ride Along,” which connects the Dolphins, local law enforcement and youth organizations to encourage dialog and understanding.\n\n“We want to change how people look at and interact with each other,” Tom told CBSN Miami. “We can hopefully help heal what is, in a lot of ways, a very polarized nation.”\n\nAs a board member for the Dolphins Cancer Challenge, Tom helped the Dolphins raise over $6 million for Miami’s Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in 2020, the largest such fundraiser of any NFL team.\n\nTom also led an initiative to be the first stadium to eliminate 99% of single-use plastics and became the first stadium in sports to achieve GBAC-Star certification during the pandemic, which is an objective third-party expert standard for cleanliness.\n\nBefore his role in Miami, Tom — who has an MBA from the University of Michigan — served as president and CEO of the San Diego Padres, COO of the Arizona Diamondbacks and executive vice president of Chip Ganassi Racing’s NASCAR team. He also worked in sales and marketing at both Miller Brewing and Texaco Inc.\n\nAnd finally, Tom’s love for sports is what drives much of his work. He met his wife, Allison, at the 1998 Miami Grand Prix and played high school football and basketball.\n\nThe father of three sons told the Coloradan alumni magazine last year, “Sports, and especially football, invokes the human spirit to inspire and motivate and educate us about ourselves, both the good and the bad.”\n\nImagine a classroom where students teach as much as they learn. Where the students are as diverse as the teaching methods. Where every voice matters.\n\nKris Gutiérrez (PhDEd’87) is creating those classrooms.\n\nKris is an internationally recognized researcher, advisor, teacher and mentor in the education field. A prolific writer, she has long championed equity in schools. In particular, she has helped transform education for marginalized groups, including immigrant and migrant communities.\n\nIn developing her concept of “third space,” Kris recognized that both teachers and students can bring expertise to the classroom based on their unique experiences. She has also studied how learning environments can be better organized to reflect and respond to non-Western cultures.\n\n“She is a genius at bridging contexts — not just bridging between academic and real-world contexts, but within academia bridging among divergent approaches,” said Barbara Rogoff, a distinguished professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz.\n\nAs a public scholar, Kris is generous with her time. She was a member of President Barack Obama’s Education Policy Transition Team in 2008–09 and was also appointed by President Obama to the National Board for the Institute of Education Sciences.\n\nShe has served as president of the American Educational Research Association, the largest educational research organization in the world, and remains active as a keynote speaker, committee member and foundation advisor.\n\nBut Kris’ most direct, personal impact comes from her teaching and mentoring.\n\n“Her courses are legendary for their rigor, playfulness and innovation,” wrote Arturo Cortez and José Ramón Lizárraga, assistant professors in CU’s School of Education.\n\nMichael Cole, professor emeritus at UC San Diego, remembered co-teaching courses with Kris using online technology to increase the diversity of participants. “She is a remarkably accomplished scholar who has a great impact on contemporary education, particularly the education of Latinx children, youth and young adults,” he said.\n\nKris has mentored many doctoral students who have gone on to be leaders in the education field. She is committed not only to passing on her own knowledge and expertise, but to being an ally to underserved students.\n\n“She has charted a path for scholars like us (queer, Latinx, first-generation college [students], as well as high school graduates) to have a place in the academy,” wrote Arturo and José, “and to continue the important work of imagining, designing and creating a new equitable and just world.”\n\nAfter earning her doctorate from CU Boulder and serving as the inaugural Provost’s Chair in the School of Education, Kris is now the Carol Liu Chair in Educational Policy and a faculty member in the Learning Sciences and Human Development department at UC Berkeley, as well as a former professor at UCLA. Recently elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences — whose members have included Albert Einstein, Joan Baez and a member of the National Academy of Education — Kris continues to transform the educational system and inspire new scholars and teachers.\n\n“Along with her indefatigable work ethic, her brilliant intellect and her inspiring leadership,” said Joseph L. Polman, associate dean for research at the School of Education, “Dr. Gutiérrez is a person of deep warmth and caring who maintains fierce attention to equity and transformational change.”\n\nThe human life — any life — is of utmost importance to Nikhil Mankekar (Fin’01).\n\nWith a focus on diversity, inclusion, gender equity, housing protections, fair wages, preventing hate crimes and more, Nikhil has been a compassionate champion for women, black, Indigenous and people of color, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community, the homeless population and under-resourced and under-served communities in Boulder and greater Colorado.\n\nIn short, Nikhil cares deeply about building a safe, welcoming, and inclusive community.\n\n“He is a strong force in improving Boulder city and county, and Colorado, and brings innovation to social justice work and policy,” said Joanne Belknap, a tenured CU Boulder ethnic studies professor.\n\nA Boulder native with a career spent in financial consulting, venture capital and social entrepreneurship, Nikhil’s confident leadership as a member and chairman of the City of Boulder’s Human Relations Commission for more than six years has led to several monumental changes in Boulder law and social policy. In 2019, he led the effort to add innovative updates to Boulder’s hate crime ordinance, including enhanced prosecutorial ability, protections for religious expression and new ways to offer support for hate crime victims. He created trainings and resources on the new law, and all were introduced to the entire Boulder Police Department.\n\n“Nikhil has been an outstanding partner, ally and leader in the fight against hate,” said Michael T. Dougherty, the elected Boulder County District Attorney.\n\nAs the first Indian and Sikh-American appointed to a city board in Boulder, he spearheaded new housing and mobile home protections, added gender inclusive language and protections to the city’s human rights ordinance and fought the criminalization of homelessness in Boulder with compassionate, creative and effective solutions. He co-founded and was instrumental in the creation and planning of Boulder’s Indigenous Peoples Day, making the city the 14th in the nation to do so. He also worked directly with Boulder’s mayor and city council on many other civil and human rights policies.\n\n“Nikhil did an extraordinary job as a human relations commissioner where he achieved a long list of accomplishments and became known for his perseverance in advocating for human rights and working on behalf of marginalized and voiceless populations,” said Boulder’s former mayor, Suzanne Jones. “He deserves our appreciation for his dedication to the community and the advancement of human rights. I have greatly valued working with him.”\n\nIn 2017, the United Nations Association awarded Nikhil the International Human Rights Award for his work. He said upon receiving the award, “The reason I’ve stayed and lived in Boulder, even despite discrimination that I’ve experienced, is to do what I’m doing now and to make it a better place for everyone.”\n\nNikhil is also a musician, artist, educator, and facilitator. He is the producer and host of his own radio talk show and podcast, and has appeared on NPR’s All Things Considered, helping educate and raise cultural awareness in the community. He also serves on the board of directors for a variety of local nonprofit organizations serving the arts, equity, education and economic development.\n\nCU Boulder also benefits from his compassion and grit. Nikhil graduated with a 4.0 GPA and received the Chancellor’s Recognition Award. The 2001 CU Boulder valedictorian and Outstanding Graduate of the Leeds School of Business is a regular moderator and panelist for the annual Conference on World Affairs and has served as a mentor for CU students.\n\nSaid Edie Hooton, a Colorado state representative, “Nikhil’s continued dedication, willingness to volunteer and his track record of initiating substantive change in policy make him an effective leader and advocate for social justice in our community.”\n\nWith Nikhil, Boulder is in good hands.\n\nEducator. Researcher. Mentor. Leader. There are many ways to describe Jackie Colt. The most important might be this: Change-maker.\n\nJackie dedicated her 40-year career in public education to improving literacy and the student experience, as a district literacy coordinator, CU instructor and chair of CU’s School of Education Advisory Board.\n\nPerhaps her most significant contribution began in Longmont’s St. Vrain Valley School District, where she directed the Right Start Reading Project. In addition to pulling struggling readers out of class, the program integrated remedial reading instruction into elementary classrooms. This unprecedented approach was especially helpful for special education and bilingual students.\n\n“The Right Start Reading Project created a culture shift in the school,” a peer said. “Everyone became a teacher of reading.”\n\nDistrict-wide literacy levels improved dramatically, and the project model was later implemented around the country. “Her efforts and results were monumental — all because she not only believed all students could learn, but developed a program that proved it,” another peer said.\n\nAs a clinical professor at CU, Jackie married research and teaching, using the fruit of her research to reform the way future teachers learn reading instruction.\n\n“Researchers often have difficulty making their work accessible to practitioners,” said one scholar, “but with Jackie on the team, we were able to bridge that gap for the benefit of teachers, administrators and students.”\n\nNow retired, Jackie continues to support literacy for adults as a volunteer. She also contributes to a CU scholarship supporting educators who teach in high-poverty schools. Thousands of students continue to benefit from her life’s work.\n\nJacalyn Colt Award Video\n\nSometimes, all you need to solve a tough problem is a rocket scientist with a good golf game. Fortunately, at least one exists: Safwan Shah studied both electrical and aerospace engineering at CU Boulder before establishing himself as a Silicon Valley serial entrepreneur in financial technologies, or FinTech.\n\nAlong the way, he designed experiments for the US space program and researched artificial neural networks and AI.\n\nToday Safwan is CEO and founder of PayActiv, which helps workers gain instant and timely access to earned wages, alleviating financial stress between pay periods and allowing them to avoid punitive fees of pawn shops and predatory lenders. Walmart, ADP, Visa, Uber and many others partner with PayActiv.\n\nEarlier, Safwan cofounded Infonox, which produced payments technology widely used in the casino industry and also developed the first biometric ATM.\n\nBorn in Pakistan and now a California resident, Safwan met his wife, Ginni Dhindsa, in Boulder. He is an intimidatingly good golfer with a voracious appetite for new knowledge, a friend said.\n\nSafwan has taught at Cal-Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and UC Santa Cruz’s Baskin School of Engineering, and advised CU Boulder on innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives.\n\n“Safwan is a perpetual learner, reading everything he can get his hands on, absorbing, analyzing, critiquing and challenging ideas often taken for granted,” a friend said. “He challenges the status quo constantly and has the unique ability to apply knowledge from the multitude of physical and social sciences to finding solutions that could have a meaningful impact on society.\n\n“His passion for learning is only matched with his love for sharing his knowledge.”\n\nSafwan Shah Award Video\n\nIn the early 1980s, Olester Benson was an active-duty U.S. Army Pharmacy Specialist assigned to the Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora. A husband and father, he studied at night for a bachelor’s degree at CU Denver. There a professor noticed Olester’s talent for chemistry and urged him to pursue graduate work — then personally drove him to Boulder to introduce him to future mentors here. By 1988, Olester was a CU Boulder PhD and on course for a remarkable life in science. In the 29 years since, he’s distinguished himself at Minnesota-based 3M Corp., which ranks him among its top researchers for his combination of scientific prowess, ability to apply science to real life and commitment to mentoring. A corporate scientist there — 3M’s highest rank — Olester has developed manufacturing technologies enabling more than 300 products with applications in medicine, renewable energy, aerospace, traffic safety, semiconductors and electronic displays. He’s earned more than 70 patents. Others are pending. Grateful for his own mentors, Olester has prioritized mentorship and service to the benefit of aspiring young scientists around the country. At CU Boulder, he served on the graduate school advisory council for a decade. He’s recruited our graduate students for positions at 3M. And he made a gift that helped endow a graduate fellowship in organic chemistry. In 2017, the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers recognized him with its top award. Part way through graduate school, Olester switched from active to reserve status in the Army. The PhD retired as a master sergeant in 1997.\n\nOlester Benson Award Video\n\nHerb IIisaurri Schroeder went to Alaska in the 1970s to work on a construction project. He didn’t have a college education, but he dreamed of becoming an engineer. Those early experiences inspired a lifelong mission to prove that the most important factor for success in science and engineering is not test scores, but curiosity about the world and delight in solving problems. Today Herb, who ultimately earned a PhD in civil engineering from CU Boulder, is vice provost for the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The program, which he founded, works to eliminate biases against Alaska Native students while empowering them to succeed in STEM disciplines. “While Herb is both a gifted engineer and a great teacher,” a colleague said, “his true genius is in seeing potential in young people and giving them the tools they need to realize their dreams.” The program has changed the lives of many thousands of students with 2,500 students currently enrolled from middle school to the university level. 800 Natives have graduated with STEM BS degrees from the University of Alaska since its inception in 1995. “Herb is a shining light among non-Native Alaskans in actively working to right historical wrongs and support Alaska Natives in creating a positive future for our state,” said an Alaska Native and colleague. Herb has received dozens of national awards, including the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring from President George W. Bush. More impressive still, another colleague writes, is the honor the Alaskan Native students and their families have bestowed on him: The name “Ilisaurri.” It means “teacher.”\n\nHerb Schroeder Award Video\n\nLorenzo Trujillo has had three outstanding careers — in education, law and music — and at times he’s even managed to blend them. “The rarity of Lorenzo’s range of talent and enterprise is…striking,” said a peer. Currently Lorenzo is an affiliate professor of music at Metropolitan State University in Denver. He began the CU portion of his fruitful journey majoring in Spanish and then completing a master’s degree in dance. Soon after graduation, he began teaching Folklórico classes – Mexican folk dance – as faculty in the dance department offering courses and performing with students across Colorado and Wyoming under the banner of the University of Colorado Ballet Folklórico. Then he earned a doctorate in education from the University of San Francisco and embarked on a career in education administration. As executive director for humanities for Jefferson County Public Schools for eight years, he fostered interest among students in the arts, languages and social studies. Over a period of eight years in Adams County Schools as a district administrator, legal counsel and principal at Lester Arnold Alternative High School, he increased graduation and attendance rates. At age 39, he came back to CU — as a law student. An attorney for more than two decades, Lorenzo prioritized underrepresented populations in private practice and at CU Boulder, where he served as a law school assistant dean. He co-founded the four-year mentoring program, “Law School…Yes We Can,” for underrepresented undergraduates interested in law. Lorenzo’s passion is the well-being of family and community as developed through education, access to justice and the joy of life through music and dance. A versatile violinist who plays in various styles, including classical and mariachi, Lorenzo now directs Metro’s mariachi ensemble.\n\nLorenzo Trujillo Award Video\n\nGeorge “Geoie” Writer is a legend in the Colorado building industry. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, Geoie Writer returned to Denver and founded The Writer Corporation, a home building company, in 1965. Mr. Writer’s vision was to build communities, not just homes, which included open space parks, school sites, walking paths and recreational centers with pools and tennis courts. He’s built more than 12,000 homes in communities across the Front Range including Willow Creek, The Dam, The Knolls, South Park, Devil’s Thumb and The Peninsula. Mr. Writer is passionate about design with an enduring impact, and all of his communities – including those that are 50 years old – are still thriving and evolving.\n\nMr. Writer built the iconic Writer Square in downtown Denver, named the 1980s top architectural and functional urban development by the Colorado Design Council, and received their 25-year award for architectural design of enduring significance.\n\nIn 1978 he was the youngest recipient to be named National Builder of the Year by Professional Builder magazine. The magazine’s editor described him as someone who was “furthering the professionalism of the building business in America.” His accolades continued with Man of the Year awards from both the Colorado and Denver Housing Industry.\n\nMr. Writer, who has five children, eight grandchildren and five great grandchildren, retired in 2004, but remains dedicated to improving others’ lives. Mr. Writer continues to inspire the next generation through his engagement with the CU Leeds Center for Education on Social Responsibility (CESR). In the words of a CESR leader: “Geoie has clearly cultivated habits of community service that drive him to serve the common good of society and his community.”\n\nView George Writer Jr. Award Video\n\nFor more than three decades, professor Yusur Wajih Al-Madani of Kuwait University has made extraordinary progress for students in her country. But first, she gleaned inspiration in Boulder. Yusur came to CU in the late 1970s and was the first Kuwaiti to earn a PhD in English literature with an American emphasis. She demonstrated great ability in deciphering complex texts and an eloquent writing style, despite her non-native language.\n\nSaid a friend from CU: “As a professor of literature I am totally awed by Yusur’s intellectual and scholarly development in a range of literatures and cultures that would seem to have taken several lifetimes to master.”\n\nYusur returned to Kuwait to create more opportunities for students to study foreign literatures and cultures. She also wanted students to express themselves in the arts, including music, filming and acting.\n\nShe delivered on her vision as Head of the English Language and Literature Department by establishing in 2003 the English Day, an outlet for creativity for students which has become a standing tradition since then.\n\nAs Associate Dean for Academic Affairs at Kuwait University, she developed and gained accreditation for the university’s College of Arts. From there, she also chaired the now thriving French Department.\n\nShe also chaired the college’s now-thriving French department until February 2017. In 2009, Yusur was awarded the Palm Academic Award by the French Ambassador on behalf of the French Republic for her efforts in launching the department, the first in the Gulf area.\n\nSaid a colleague: “Yusur makes everyone around her — undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and administrators alike — want to aim higher for themselves, for the university and for community.”\n\nView Yasur Wajih Al-Madani Award Video\n\nWith more than four decades spent at CU Boulder, Lorrie Shepard was often the trusted go-to for campus administrators concerning policies, programs and possibilities. “She is known for her sharp analytical skills, her articulate questions and her tenacious commitment to fairness,” said a former CU vice-provost.\n\nIn her own work, Lorrie has contributed extensive research on psychometrics, testing and assessment policies, and the use and misuse of tests in educational settings. She is a champion of classroom formative assessments that help improve student learning, and she is committed to equipping and supporting future teachers to serve all students.\n\nA former doctoral student said, “I often feel the positive difference in the way that colleagues look at me when they learn that I was a student of Dr. Shepard’s.” . “I hope that a fraction of her skills rubbed off on me.”\n\nHer leading contributions to research nationally did not diminish her impact as a university leader locally. As dean of the School of Education for 15 years, Lorrie built a productive, effective and dedicated faculty, tripling total research grants. She also helped establish the CU Engage center, connecting CU students and faculty with community members, and she helped create the school’s first development advisory board. Lorrie remains on the faculty as a distinguished professor.\n\nSaid a peer: “She is regarded widely as a clear thinker, an audacious proponent of quality education for underserved students and a champion of teachers who make the K-12 educational system work.”\n\nView Lorrie Shepard Award Video\n\nDave Grusin’s achievements could make anyone feel like an underachiever. It’s among his gifts that he never does.\n\nIntimates describe the 10-time Grammy winner and Academy Award recipient as a rare species — a “creative genius” who brings out the best in others, whether they’re seasoned professional musicians or amateurs with a dream.\n\nA masterful jazz pianist, Dave has been composing, playing, arranging or producing music professionally since the 1960s.\n\nHe has performed worldwide and worked with Quincy Jones, Jobim, Paul Simon, Bobby MacFerrin, James Taylor, Renee Fleming and many others. He’s written music for more than 100 films and television programs, including “The Graduate,” “Tootsie,” “On Golden Pond” and “St. Elsewhere.”\n\nNominated for the Academy Award eight times, he won in 1988 for his score for “The Milagro Beanfield War.”\n\nAdmired for his contagious enthusiasm, collaborative spirit and highly original output, Dave’s work often blends elements of jazz, pop and classical music.\n\nAmid all this, Dave has made CU Boulder a priority.\n\nA founding member of the College of Music Advisory Board, he has participated in the Conference on World Affairs for decades — and once returned early from an overseas tour to appear at the Tuesday night jazz concert. He’s performed live with CU musical groups, led students in master classes and given generously of his resources, providing major support for the renovation of the space today called Grusin Music Hall.\n\nIn the words of one CU music professor,\n\n“He is a hero to us.”\n\nW. Harold “Sonny” Flowers didn’t have many fellow black classmates at Boulder High in the early 1960s, but he found community among black CU student-athletes he befriended on The Hill.\n\n“Even then,” one mentor wrote, “Sonny stood out as a young man who would go places.”\n\nAfter enrolling at CU, Sonny, now a prominent Boulder attorney and citizen, emerged as a champion for campus diversity.\n\nHe continued this role at Colorado Law, distinguishing himself as a bold debater who traveled the state recruiting students of color to the school.\n\nOver the decades he’s served CU loyally — not least as president of the Alumni Association’s board of directors, as a member of the CU Law and CU Foundation boards and as mentor of black student-athletes, future lawyers among them.\n\nSonny helped establish the Black Alumni Association and create an endowed scholarship for students of color at both Colorado Law and the University of Denver.\n\nA litigator with Boulder’s Hurth, Sisk & Blakemore, LLC, Sonny is a leader in Colorado’s legal community whose service includes the presidencies of the Sam Cary Bar Association, the Boulder County Bar Association and the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association. He continues his more than 10 years as co-chair of the Colorado Trial Lawyers Annual Convention, and is the current president of the Colorado chapter of the American Board of Trial Advocates, an invitation-only membership group of trial lawyers who represent both civil defendants and plaintiffs.\n\nA determined advocate for friends, clients and CU alike, Sonny’s gifts include the ability to champion a cause and build community at the same time.\n\n“One of the areas that set Sonny apart,” a law school contemporary said, “was that even though he was oftentimes adamant, the difference of views did not carry over to the next class.”\n\nKathryn Tobey had pictured herself in the petrochemical industry.\n\nWith oil prices slumping as commencement neared in 1984, the CU chemical engineering major pivoted to aerospace, an industry her father had been a part of for over 30 years.\n\nHer challenge was to convince Martin Marietta, now Lockheed Martin, to hire her — as a software engineer.\n\nThat bold move paid off: More than 30 years later, Kathy is a seasoned Lockheed executive whose numerous responsibilities have involved spacecraft design, laser-based remote sensing systems, Mars chemistry experiments and management oversight of national security space programs.\n\nFrom the start, Kathy was an anomaly — a chemical engineer at an aerospace firm and a woman in a male-dominated field. She has helped break the mold for high-level aerospace and defense leaders.\n\n“Kathy stands as a shining role model for all others,” said a fellow aerospace executive.\n\nToday Kathy is vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Special Programs Line of Business. She oversees a broad portfolio of technologies and programs with national security applications.\n\nA stalwart and continuous CU supporter and a vigorous advocate for women in STEM careers, Kathy serves as co-chair of the engineering college’s Broadening Opportunities for Leadership Diversity (BOLD) Center, on the dean’s advisory committee and as the Lockheed Martin University Executive. She is a trustee for the Women’s Foundation of Colorado.\n\nKathy’s husband and two sons are Buff alumni and her extended family has earned 13 CU degrees.\n\nA proven leader in the Denver community, Olivia Omega has a passion for inspiring young people to make their dreams a reality. And her values of inclusion and access drive both her career and community contributions.\n\nAs a TEDx speaker, diversity and inclusion advocate, author, branding strategist and seasoned entrepreneur, Olivia has over 20 years of brand positioning and digital marketing experience across startup, nonprofit, and public and private sectors. During this time she has studied the importance of authenticity for both brands and individuals — and what it means for personal brands to show up in a genuine way.\n\nAs senior director of marketing and communications at the nonprofit Denver Scholarship Foundation (DSF), Olivia helps make college possible for students and builds the educational and economic future of Denver. She collaborates with Denver Public Schools high school students, families and partners statewide to increase access and completion of post-high school learning, while also expanding generational exposure to career and entrepreneurial opportunities.\n\nOlivia is tasked daily with communicating the importance of post-secondary education and the value of a college degree, as well as sharing the stories of students and scholars. Given her own familiarity of growing up in a single-parent, low-income home, she is personally dedicated to helping students receive the support, resources and guidance they need to access the educational and professional pathways of their choice.\n\nHer own journey and experience at CU Boulder also gives Olivia the ability to talk to students about the importance of a college education. Her life is a testament to the value of a CU Boulder degree, and CU’s close to 400 DSF Scholars continue to show the quality of students who can call themselves Forever Buffs.\n\nBeyond the personal value she has gained from her time at CU, Olivia has inspired hundreds of students by returning to campus for 15 consecutive years to host marketing and personal branding sessions in addition to coaching and mentoring.\n\nThroughout her career, Olivia has consistently volunteered for CU Boulder programs such as the Precollegiate Development Program, Leeds Diverse Scholars Program and Key Bank Business Leadership Program. She is also an alumna of the Presidents Leadership Class (PLC) — one of the oldest collegiate leadership programs in the United States — and now serves on its Board of Advocates and as chair of its DEI committee.\n\nAs shared by nominator Stanley Hickory of CU Boulder’s Research & Innovation Office, “Olivia has spent 22 years giving back to the university and can now see the individual and collective impact of her dedication through the feedback of the former students she mentored and sponsored. She exemplifies ambassadorship and is a walking example of how the investment in students comes back full circle.”\n\nKim Christiansen has appeared as a friendly, calm presence in the homes of Coloradans for more than 30 years. As the lead anchor of Denver’s 9News broadcast, she has earned a reputation as a trusted source for news — and beyond.\n\nCatch her anchoring the 4, 5 and 10 p.m. daily newscasts and hear her voice on the “Train to the plane” at DEN airport.\n\n“Kim Christiansen’s superpower is her empathy,” said 9News colleague Chris Vanderveen (Jour’96). “It makes her a better person. It makes her a better journalist. She cares in a way that’s never been common in this business. She cares about people. If you want to be a better person, seek out any of the work from Kim.”\n\nKim, who grew up and lives in Arvada, is a staunch Colorado advocate and is fiercely loyal to her state. You’ll also find her in the stands of Folsom Field on a football game day with her family, fully decked out in CU gear and brimming with school pride.\n\nKim is the epitome of a Forever Buff. She often gives gleaming accolades for the university and supports many of its happenings. As a journalism student in the 1980s — where she also was twirler for the marching band — she credits the foundations of writing and reporting she learned with helping her land her first job at the 9News station in 1985. She’s also now a parent to a recent graduate, her son Tanner Feith (Mktg’23).\n\nAnd, since 2016, the nine-time Emmy Award winner has dedicated hours of her time to CU Boulder’s annual Alumni Awards ceremony as emcee and video narrator. Her involvement with the event has elevated the status and prestige of the historic ceremony, which celebrates its 94th year in 2023.\n\nSaid Brennan Jones, director of Forever Buffs engagement and outreach, who runs the ceremony: \"She has done so with grace and always has been willing to go above and beyond.”\n\nAnn Miller Scott is a CU fan through and through.\n\nScott is a dedicated contributor to the CU Boulder community — and she consistently goes above and beyond. Whether at Buffalo Belles (a group of engaged supporters of CU Athletics) or in her many positions across campus and over the years, she always promotes CU with enthusiasm and sincerity.\n\nAfter graduating from CU Boulder with her bachelor’s degree in 1971, Scott was a public school teacher for Baltimore City Public Schools before transitioning to a 35-year career in higher education with a return to her alma mater in 1977.\n\nShe started as a data entry operator and worked her way up to become the director of registrations, better known as registrar. Managing staff and the many volunteers known as the \"registration ladies,\" she registered 20,000 students three times a year.\n\nLater, as a fundraising leader at CU, Scott raised millions in current and estate giving for departments, colleges and schools throughout the campus.\n\nOver the years, her progressively significant roles included senior director of development in the College of Engineering and Applied Science, director of reunion giving for the Leeds School of Business and assistant dean for advancement in the School of Education. In the latter role, she increased planned giving to the School of Education by more than two-fold and was instrumental in securing the largest gift in the school’s history for its new building initiative.\n\nHer ability to expertly connect with donors, alumni and fellow Buffs supporters and their unique passions is paramount to her accomplishments as a fundraiser. Further, her contributions to CU Athletics, the School of Education and CU’s culture of philanthropy have had enduring impacts on the university well beyond her tenure as a fundraising leader.\n\nIn true Buffs fashion, Scott also served as a mentor to many.\n\n“Ann Scott is someone who truly embodies the idea of being a Forever Buff and exhibits it through quiet actions of leadership,” said Matt Young, assistant vice chancellor for CU Boulder Advancement. “She always has the best interests of the university in mind — whether it be through taking on responsibilities as an employee, serving as an informal ambassador connecting alumni and friends to the institution or skillfully mentoring younger Buffs as they find their way within the community.”\n\nScott retired in 2020 but not without creating a network of authentic and up-and-coming fundraisers who are stronger professionals thanks to her leadership and model of service to the university. Even as a retiree, she continues to connect potential supporters and advocates. In fact, those supporters have come together to name the assistant dean for advancement office in the new School of Education building in her honor.\n\nSaid Young, “Her positive impact on the CU family is easy to see and impossible to quantify.”\n\nCol. Barry Baer and Sue Baer have deep roots at CU Boulder.\n\nThey met on campus in 1964 as university undergraduates, marrying less than two years later. As strong believers in the value of public education, Barry and Sue remained committed to the university that brought them together — long after leaving Boulder in 1972.\n\nDuring their time away from CU, Barry and Sue pursued meaningful careers in both the public and private sectors. Barry served 27 years in the United States Army, achieving the rank of colonel. He commanded an armored cavalry troop in Vietnam, a finance battalion in Germany and an airborne finance brigade during the Gulf War. His service has earned him numerous awards. Sue, meanwhile, continued to pursue her own dreams working as a teacher, counselor, cooking instructor and food stylist before finding her calling as a children’s author.\n\nAfter moving back to Boulder in 2003, the Baers immediately re-engaged with the university, attending events, volunteering on boards and providing financial support. This includes Sue’s service on the Dean’s Board of the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Music Advisory Board. Barry has served as a CU trustee, as well as advisory board president for the Program in Jewish Studies, committee chair of the College of Arts and Sciences’ Dean’s Board and chair of the AROTC Board.\n\nFurther, their philanthropic gifts have provided opportunities for students of myriad backgrounds and interests to pursue their passions and receive important financial assistance — whether that’s through Barry & Sue Baer Endowed Undergraduate and Graduate Student Scholarships, the Baer Crown Institute Scholarship or their contributions to the university’s Student Emergency Fund.\n\n“‘Alums give back to CU, city in multiple ways,’ was the headline written about the impact Barry and Sue Baer have on CU and the city of Boulder — and that was back in 2015,” says Michelle Gaffga, director of development in the College of Arts and Sciences. “In the six years since this alumni spotlight, they have given back in ways that are more audacious. CU would not be where it is today without the generosity of Barry and Sue Baer.”\n\nIn addition to their support, the Baers are active members of the CU Boulder community, regularly auditing courses and attending countless campus events.\n\n“There’s a Hawaiian word, ‘ohana,’ which means family,” said Barry. “CU Boulder has become part of our ohana, our extended family.”\n\nColoradan Mary Ann Casey exemplifies what it means to be an internationalist, a trailblazer and a leader. After studying international affairs at CU Boulder, her education was a launchpad for her diplomatic career, during which she became the first woman U.S. ambassador in North Africa, serving in the countries of Algeria and Tunisia.\n\nFollowing her tremendous international career — including two ambassadorships and a fellowship at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution — Casey returned to her alma mater in 1997 as a State Department Diplomat in Residence.\n\nIn that role, she taught international relations classes, mentored CU students who are now diplomats themselves, helped launch the Smith Hall International Program and helped power the international affairs committee for the Conference on World Affairs.\n\nCasey also co-founded and generously contributes to the International Affairs Global Grants Endowment at CU, which annually funds over 20 scholarships for education abroad for Boulder-based international affairs majors.\n\nShe also chaired the Advisory Board for CU Boulder’s International Affairs Program for nearly a decade, building it up to become a model for alumni engagement in the College of Arts and Sciences.\n\n“Ambassador Casey's dedication to CU Boulder is extraordinary in every way,” remarked Alexander F. Becker (Ger’06), chair of the Advisory Board for CU Boulder’s International Affairs Program. “From the mentoring of students to her unprecedented engagement with the International Affairs alumni community to the co-founding of and major financial support to the Global Grants Endowment, her leadership and service to CU Boulder will continue to make a lasting impact for decades to come.\n\n“She established opportunities for future generations of Colorado students to create positive change around the globe. Her accomplishments and contributions indeed define what it means to serve Colorado and to be engaged in the world.”\n\nWell-being is at the heart of Daniel Conroy’s (Hum’91) work. As co-founder and director of the CU Collegiate Recovery Center (CUCRC), he offers support and community to students struggling with addiction. Some credit him with saving their lives.\n\nThe CUCRC is a non-clinical space in the University Memorial Center where students support each other, with professional help, as they grapple with substance use disorders, mental health issues and other personal challenges. Ninety-five percent of participants graduate or remain enrolled in classes at CU.\n\nEarly in his career, while working at Sierra Tucson and CEDU (pronounced see doo), Daniel noticed gaps in support for young adults returning home following substance use disorder and mental health treatment. He began consulting for schools, treatment centers, wilderness programs and residential programs about ways to improve the long-term outlook for young adults facing mental health issues.\n\nIn 1999, Daniel and his wife, Mae Martin, began AIM House in Boulder, a residential program for young adults recovering from substance and mental health issues. They have successfully treated thousands of participants and their families. Now in its 21st year, AIM House is thriving.\n\nSaid a long-time colleague: “Daniel embodies that rare combination of creative entrepreneurship and compassionate service that makes positive change possible.”\n\nDaniel also helps other Colorado universities establish recovery programs. And former CUCRC students have followed his lead and begun programs elsewhere, including Wake Forest and Iowa.\n\n“In 2013, I got sober. In 2016 I graduated from CU,” said a CUCRC alum. “Those are two of my greatest accomplishments, and Danny was there active during every step of my journey.”\n\nDaniel Conroy Award Video\n\nBrian Cowan (Mktg’79) was a CU superfan for the ages.\n\nThe former U.S. Navy commander and hard-driving entrepreneur, who died in January at age 61, served the Alumni Association board for seven memorable years, including two as chair, combining a businessman’s discipline with a cheerleader’s spirit to the lasting benefit of the CU Boulder community.\n\nA vigorous champion for the revival of a robust and varied Homecoming Weekend, Brian cared deeply about connecting Buffs with each other. He led the establishment of a formal alumni reunion program, hosted dinner for groups of Buffs in his Virginia home and financially supported several key Alumni Association initiatives. At every board meeting, he belted the “CU Fight Song,” often in a large cowboy hat.\n\nBrian, a ROTC student at CU, spent 20 years in the U.S. Navy, retiring in 2001 at the rank of Commander. He went on to earn an MBA from the University of Virginia and founded his own information technology and supply chain management consulting business, Cowan & Associates. His commitment to country never wavered: In the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, he responded as a civilian to the flaming Pentagon to help with rescue operations.\n\nBrian, a father of four, died Jan. 14, 2019. The cause was brain cancer. He was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery with military honors.\n\nThe CU Boulder community mourns his loss and will be forever proud and grateful for his service to country and to CU. He was, in the words of a friend and fellow CU alumna, “a true servant-leader.”\n\nBrian Cowan Award Video\n\nJohn F. Leach knows you can’t have a healthy democracy without first-rate journalism. That’s why he championed the creation of CU’s College of Media, Communication and Information.\n\nAfter receiving his journalism degrees from CU in the 1970s, John moved to Arizona and ultimately became managing editor of The Arizona Republic, the state’s largest newspaper. He’s now managing partner of the website consultant service Digital Strategies LLC and an adjunct journalism instructor at Arizona State University. John served on CU Boulder’s School of Journalism and Mass Communication advisory board from 2007 to 2010, including two years as chair. After the school was discontinued, he joined the new journalism department’s advisory board as a founding member. He has also joined as a member of CMCI’s newest advisory board and will serve alongside Dean Lori Bergen. When the journalism program was up for re-accreditation in 2017, John traveled to a snowy Boulder from warm and sunny Phoenix to meet with the accreditation council, which strongly endorsed the CU program. John has personally established two student scholarships: The John F. Leach Endowed Scholarship and the Leach Family Scholarship Fund. Both are for undergraduate students, predominately from Colorado’s Western Slope where John grew up. He makes it a point to attend the college’s annual scholarship banquet and to connect with the scholarship winners. He continues to keep in touch with many of those recipients today. “I’ve known alums who were generous financial supporters of our program, other alums who proclaimed their support for the program in various public settings, others who offered creative suggestions to help us thrive and others who served as wise mentors to students. John is all four of these,” said a CMCI professor. “And that combination makes him the most outstanding alumnus I’ve ever known.”\n\nJohn Leach Award Video\n\nGood times or bad, Matt McElhiney makes them better. Ask anyone involved in the Alumni Association’s successful but complex transition from arm of the CU Foundation to university unit. Matt, a lawyer in Denver, joined the board of directors (now advisors) in 2007, as it grappled with thorny organizational and financial challenges, including large deficits and heavy staff turnover.\n\nLess committed, creative newcomers might have fled. Matt dove in headfirst and stuck around for nearly a decade, playing a starring role in establishing today’s thriving association. By the time he stepped down in 2016, Matt had been a committee chair, treasurer and chair of the board. He’d also become the longest-serving member ever. Matt’s “perseverance, diligence and leadership,” one nominator wrote, “provided the glue that allowed the Alumni Association to survive and prosper.” And he did it while beaming 360 degrees of positive energy with a delightfully impish smile. In his day job at Kutak Rock LLP, Matt focuses on corporate law, including mergers and acquisitions, real estate transactions, dispute resolution and business contracts. Law Week of Colorado named him a Corporate Counsel of the Year in 2010. Matt also makes time for the adventures Coloradans are famous for (skiing, hiking and biking) and at least one we’re less famous for (sailing). He lives in Denver with his wife, Colleen, and their son, Max. A member of the Director’s Club, a “big brother” for his fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta, Matt is always a lively Homecoming presence.\n\nMatt McElhiney Award Video\n\nIf you were naming Forever Buffs who live and breathe CU, you’d have to include Ron Scott. CU has been part of his identity for more than 50 years, and he lets you know it. “One common theme for Ron throughout his life is carrying the CU torch at all times whether he is working, volunteering or doing errands on a weekend,” said a CU Advancement colleague.\n\nRon came to CU as part of football coach Eddie Crowder’s first freshman class. He was a star on the field, and started three seasons as middle guard.\n\nAfter college, he spent 14 years in the private sector, including a stint as general manager of Hotel Boulderado. He returned to his alma mater in the ‘80s and served as the Buff Club’s development director and as assistant athletic director, helping to raise $14 million for the Dal Ward Athletic Center.\n\nFrom that point, Ron was a fundraising dynamo, shepherding large gifts to CU Athletics. He’s seen at virtually every CU event and activity, whether it’s giving a potential student a tour of campus or attending a game-day tailgate, and establishes meaningful conversation beyond the world of sports.\n\n“Ron Scott is the epitome of professionalism and enthusiasm,” said one CU Regent.\n\nRon is a true CU steward. As a former teammate summed things up: “To many of us, Ron is CU.”\n\nView Ron Scott Award Video\n\nThere are many recipes for success in our world. All share this ingredient: Opportunity. Time and again, Jeff Osterkamp has proved his commitment to producing it for CU Boulder students — especially students from groups underrepresented in engineering fields.\n\nA high-level executive at Ball Aerospace and past chair of the advisory council for the engineering college’s BOLD Center (Broadening Opportunity through Leadership and Diversity), Jeff shows up and makes things happen.\n\nOne signature initiative has paid especially rich dividends: The creation of Ball internships for students in the college’s GoldShirt program. These promising Buffs, typically from under-resourced high schools, have obvious potential, but need an extra year of engineering fundamentals to prepare for the full curriculum. Every year the Ball program brings Goldshirt students into, and often back to, the company, positioning them for full-time employment later.\n\n“Jeff walks the walk for diverse students,” said an engineering assistant dean.\n\nDespite the demands of Jeff’s role as Ball’s vice president for mission assurance, leading quality control for all products and processes, the 30-year aerospace industry veteran is a frequent campus presence.\n\n“You can always find Jeff at a student networking event by locating the largest circle of students,” the assistant dean said. “Jeff will be in the middle.”\n\nSaid a Ball colleague who’s witnessed it: “He will make an effort to talk to each and every student.”\n\nAlways it’s with sincerity and respect.\n\n“Regardless of rank, status or title,” another of Jeff’s fans said, “he always treats everyone the same.”\n\nView Jeff Osterkamp Award Video\n\nIt was Sept. 15, 1984 and CU football was playing in Oregon. Buffs tight end Ed Reinhardt took the ball on a routine play near the game’s end.\n\nAs he was tackled, his head struck an Oregon player, then the field. A blood vessel burst and a radically new life began.\n\nRushed to the hospital for immediate surgery, performed by a neurosurgeon who’d been at the game, Ed was in a coma for 62 days.\n\n“Ed had to draw upon all of his courage and competitive spirit just to live,” said Bill McCartney, then CU’s head coach.\n\nThe 6’5”, 235-pound sophomore with a 3.65 GPA awoke to a lifetime of reinvention that should be an inspiration to us all.\n\n“Ed’s enthusiasm and friendly spirit is not only infectious, but reassuring to his fellow campers that anything is possible,” said a Brain Injury Alliance of Colorado coordinator who has worked with Ed, who is still partially paralyzed, to raise scholarships for the group’s outdoor adventure program for adults with injuries.\n\nFor 25 years, Ed and his father, Ed Sr., have traveled the country speaking about the value of a fighting spirit. Ed, who had to relearn basic speech and movement, loves singing and acting, performing in plays and musicals, as well as at fundraisers and, from time to time, Folsom Field.\n\nOnce, before a show with Magic Moments, group that integrates performers with special needs and local actors, Ed fell backstage, injuring his hip.\n\nRather than leave the show, he requested a wheelchair, then took the stage.\n\n“The show,” he’d said, “must go on.”\n\nA 1981 graduate in anthropology and history known to friends as “Mikhy,” Michele Ritter has built an inspiring career in education, providing access and programing for diverse populations.\n\nWell known for her philanthropic and humanitarian causes — including CU’s College of Music, the Italian department, children, developmentally disabled adults and the “lost girls” of South Sudan — she keeps finding new ways to make CU a magnetic force in higher education.\n\nShe is a founding board member of the College of Music’s pioneering Entrepreneurship Center for Music and incoming chair of the Music Advisory Board. In 2015 she and her family provided funding for an endowment that established the Ritter Family Classical Guitar Program.\n\nAn Italophile, Michele has been a reliable supporter of and lively presence at Italian department events.\n\nOff campus she volunteers at a Missouri camp for seriously ill children and has helped nearly 20 South Sudanese girls, survivors of an ethnic cleansing campaign, resettle in Boulder. Five have graduated from CU; one went to work for Michelle Obama in the White House.\n\nMikhy’s admirers describe her as “generous” yet “humble,” “a unique caring presence” and “one of the strongest advocates for a truly Liberal Arts education on the CU Boulder campus.”\n\nShe also knows the big value of small kindnesses and has provided “mounds of pizza” for music students’ recital celebrations.\n\n“Hers is a life lived with the utmost integrity,” an admirer wrote, “rich in compassion, love and dedication — to humankind in general and to her alma mater in particular.”\n\nGary Anderson worked hard for his CU Boulder degree, and not just in the classroom: Student by day, he drove a forklift at night to support his young family.\n\nNow a retired business executive, he’s never forgotten what balancing school and work was like, and has helped later students find ways to integrate paid work and academics. Notably, as a member of the College of Engineering & Applied Science’s advisory council (EAC), he was a prime mover behind the “Earn-Learn” apprenticeship program.\n\nOver years of steady service to CU, Gary has led CU Boulder’s engineering fundraising council, served on the University of Colorado Foundation’s board and helped found a joint program of CU Denver and CU Anschutz — displaying integrity, enthusiasm, executive ability and a prodigious work ethic that has inspired others to act on CU’s behalf.\n\n“I consider Gary to be one of my earliest mentors in ‘How to be a good alum,’” said one engaged fellow Buff.\n\nGary worked at Honeywell for more than a decade and spent nearly 20 years at StorageTek, the digital storage systems firm, rising to director and corporate vice president. In retirement he’s pursued investing and philanthropy, with CU as a major beneficiary of his time, treasure and expertise.\n\nGary has helped improve student retention in engineering, advocated for Engineers Without Borders and contributed his financial and organizational savvy to college, campus and system. He is a recipient of the University Medal and the Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award.\n\n“When I think of the ideal role model for men and women in engineering, business and the community,” said a former EAC member, “I think of Gary Anderson.”\n\nTom Shepherd’s CU Boulder family pride has a wide range: His mother, wife, son and several extended family members are all Forever Buffs.\n\nHe wanted this huge display of school enthusiasm to be evident in other CU families, too. So, as a master of getting things done — evident in his work as the now-retired vice president of logistics for global berry company Driscoll’s — he got to work on a new university initiative.\n\nThe Buffalo Legacy Program launched during his nine-year tenure on the CU Boulder Alumni Association’s Advisory Board. Today, through the program — which Tom donates to — first-year students with parents, step-parents or grandparents can apply for legacy-related scholarships, and graduating students can wear a complimentary black and gold cord over their gowns during commencement ceremonies.\n\n“Through Tom’s ongoing commitment and work, hundreds of families and students are positively impacted each year,” said Julann Andresen (Mktg’85), senior director of Forever Buffs engagement and outreach.\n\nTom served on the board of advisors from 2008 to 2012 and from 2015 to 2020, notching nearly a decade of volunteer time for the Alumni Association, including four years as chair of the board. Despite his prominent career position directing logistics for Driscoll’s, he flew to Boulder from his California home several times a year for board meetings and was instrumental in transitioning the board from one focused on committees and tactics to a group focused on strategy and initiatives.\n\nHis strategic input on how the alumni board could better support the rapidly changing Alumni Association and university will endure for years to come.\n\n“The change he has enacted leaves a generational impact on supporting and growing our alumni and university,” said Colin Finch (PolSci’05), former Alumni Association Advisory Board chair.\n\nOutside of the Alumni Association, Tom was involved with the Professional Mentorship Program with the Leeds School of Business for 12 years.\n\nSaid Alumni Association executive director Ryan Chreist (Kines'96, MPubAd'09): “Tom exemplifies what it means to serve selflessly as a volunteer to make CU a better place.”\n\nAs part of the CU Boulder community since childhood, Stephen Hatfield exemplifies what it means to be a Forever Buff.\n\nStephen grew up in Boulder and surrounded by the world of CU, where his father was an adjunct professor in the interdisciplinary telecommunications program. This connection to the university led him to discover what would become his ultimate passion: CU Athletics.\n\nFrom an early age, Stephen was often in the stands at football games, cheering on his beloved Buffaloes in Folsom Field. Years later, he enrolled at CU and graduated with a degree in business administration, later earning his executive master’s of business administration from CU Denver in 2003.\n\nAfter years of putting his business acumen to work in marketing and sales roles, he returned to CU Boulder where he joined the Forever Buffs Alumni Association Advisory Board from 2019 to 2020. He went on to serve as chairperson of the board from 2020 to 2022, serving both the Boulder and Denver chapters.\n\nDuring this time, Stephen worked on several impactful engagement and fundraising opportunities, including a showing of documentary film Mission Mt. Mangart, which chronicles the story of the 10th Mountain Division ski troops. This event was the most successful fundraising event for any Forever Buffs chapter to date.\n\nWhile on the board, Stephen was known for his contagious excitement whenever he gained momentum on a project or solicited support. Even in the midst of the 2021 Marshall Fire tragedy in Boulder County — amid a global pandemic, nonetheless — Stephen’s positivity and professionalism persevered. He is a shining example of grace and professionalism, capable of stepping into any role that needs extra attention.\n\n“Stephen’s leadership is directly attributable to our success,” said Andrew North, chapter officer of Forever Buffs Boulder. “In his first year as a board member, Stephen executed multiple events of unprecedented scope, attracting numerous high-profile attendees and top donors, which garnered significant funds for scholarships.”\n\nStephen even carries the spirit of CU Boulder into his personal life: For a milestone birthday, he asked guests to make contributions to the CU Boulder Alumni Association scholarship program in lieu of gifts for himself.\n\nWith his innate capacity for empathy, Stephen continues to build and nurture relationships with CU faculty, staff and students, always on the prowl for new ways to affect positive change in people’s lives. His undeniable and unwavering dedication to the CU community makes him a quintessential recipient of the Leanne Skupa-Lee Award.\n\nVanessa Lopez thrives on giving back to her community.\n\nA board member for both the Forever Buffs Latinx club and Forever Buffs Boulder chapter, Lopez consistently takes a leadership role in building connections and creating impact.\n\n“It is likely impossible to calculate the total hours that Vanessa has volunteered with the Forever Buffs community, but it is clear that her ongoing dedication has had a tremendous impact on the efforts of the university,” said Aja Ringenbach, program manager for alumni volunteer engagement. “She is consistently a volunteer who stands out above the rest.”\n\nTake her role in the Buffs Give Back national volunteer event, which returned last spring. When Lopez heard the event was coming back after a pandemic hiatus, she immediately became a project leader for both Forever Buffs Latinx and Forever Buffs Boulder, coordinating two different shifts for volunteers at the Marshall Fire Donation Center.\n\nWith Lopez at the helm, the groups spent the day unpacking, sorting and shelving donations for individuals impacted by the fires in Superior, Louisville and unincorporated Boulder County. Both shifts filled up completely, and Lopez — who has participated in four Buffs Give Back projects to date — was able to connect with over 20 local Buffs, including several alumni who had not regularly engaged with the groups before.\n\nLopez also finds joy in building connections with students. A co-chair for the May 2022 Latinx Graduation, she had a direct, positive impact on the experience of graduating Buffs. With planning that began in January, she was highly intentional and vocal about creating a meaningful event that represented the values of the CU Boulder Latinx community.\n\nAs a volunteer for the Forever Buffs scholarship program, Lopez has helped provide students with transformative scholarship awards. In 2022, she reviewed 41 scholarship applications — when the average reviewer reads only 10 to 15. In all, Lopez helped the Forever Buffs Latinx club award $30,000 to 10 deserving students, and she helped start the new Forever Buffs First Generation Scholarship, awarding $15,000 to five students.\n\nIn all, Lopez remains committed to giving back to her CU community. She said, “While we all can’t reach global or even national recognition for our contributions to society, we all are capable of making an important impact in someone’s life.”\n\nIf Lisa Ayala-Williams is your mentor, you’ve got a friend for life. The former Disney vice president has been a CU student mentor since 2012.\n\nShe makes time for regular communication, lending support, career guidance and networking. A former student even landed her dream job in marketing at Walt Disney Animation Studios after Ayala-Williams helped her become an intern.\n\n“She truly bleeds black and gold and is always promoting the benefits of a CU Boulder education and staying involved with the institution, to everyone with whom she interacts,” said the Alumni Association’s senior director, Julann Andresen.\n\nIn 2002, Ayala-Williams joined the film marketing team at Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment as a supervising producer. As a vice president for eight years, she led creative services and strategic marketing teams at The Walt Disney Studios. Over a more than 17-year tenure, she and her teams created global advertising campaigns for Disney, Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel films on digital, movie apps, DVD, Blu-Ray and for 3D theatrical film releases.\n\nWhile working, Ayala-Williams also established a strong relationship with CU Boulder, beginning with the Leeds School of Business and expanding to the Alumni Association. She served as an executive board member for the Alumni Association for nearly four years, serving as a brand ambassador to help guide decisions related to alumni and student programming, especially Homecoming Weekend.\n\nWhile she’s proud of her many creative awards, becoming CU’s PAC-12 “Spotlight Alumnus” in 2016 was a career highlight.\n\nAt Leeds, she’s a three-time “Mentor of the Year” nominee. She also regularly speaks to MBA student groups and on women’s panels.\n\n“Every time Lisa visits Boulder, we get together for a meal to catch up and discuss our goals,” said a mentee of Lisa’s in 2017. “Lisa’s love of the university is contagious, and makes me look forward to coming back and being involved as an alumnus.”\n\nToday, Ayala-Williams is also a board member for ForeverGold, a highly engaged group of alumni and friends of the university who advance CU through the support of student scholarships, capital projects and increasing overall engagement.\n\nSaid Andresen, “CU Boulder needs more involved, engaged and generous people like Lisa.”\n\nTo know Carrie Scott was to know passion, tenacity and kindness. One of her greatest passions was her alma mater, where her legacy lives on in the community she nurtured and the students whose lives she touched.\n\nA devoted CU Boulder fundraiser and Parent Leadership Society leader, Carrie loyally served CU until her death last year at age 60.\n\nAfter shepherding daughter Shoshanna (Art’17) into the CU family, she catalyzed the growth of the CU parent community in Southern California, hosting events at her home and generating major financial resources for CU student services.\n\n“The southern California community continues to grow today thanks to Carrie,” a CU partner said.\n\nCarrie, who had a 20-year career in advertising, was also involved in a series of charities, including Dollies Making a Difference, Birthright, Stop Cancer and Jewish Federation. She loved strolling beaches, playing Mahjong, scuba diving and traveling.\n\nWhile at CU, she attended Semester at Sea — paying for it herself by successfully auditioning for Hollywood Squares and winning $15,000 in prizes.\n\nIn addition to Shoshanna, Carrie is survived by her children Zachary and Rachel, and her husband of 31 years, Michael B. Scott.\n\n“Carrie once told me that the best thing you could do for the world is to help children achieve their goals in life,” a fellow CU parent said. “She did just that, time and time again.”\n\nUp until a month before she died of cancer, Carrie was still referring students and parents to her beloved CU. Said another CU parent, “Colorado was ingrained in her soul.”\n\nCarrie Beth Scott Award Video\n\nScott Steinbrecher is a big-picture guy who sweats the details.\n\nWhen he coordinated a CU scholarship fundraising event, nothing went unnoticed. Tickets for 200 people, food and drinks to satisfy a crowd, a busy silent auction… Scott juggled it all.\n\nAmid the happy hubbub, Scott, an international student programs coordinator at CU Denver, kept the event’s fundraising mission front and center. He’s proud to have raised and awarded over $75,000 in scholarships for incoming CU freshmen during his time with the Boulder alumni chapter. Of course, he had lots of enthusiastic Boulder chapter volunteers also hard at work in generating those funds.\n\nAn active CU volunteer since 1990, Scott has led the Boulder alumni chapter and chaired its scholarships committee. He‘s also been an important voice on the Alumni Association Board of Advisors.\n\nAlso a member of CU Advocates, the university’s official grassroots network, Scott has helped build a stronger link between the program and the Boulder alumni chapter, to the benefit of students, alumni and community members.\n\n“He is always keeping an eye out for appropriate connections to advance the reach, exposure and mission of CU,” a fellow Advocate said.\n\nAlways looking for unique ways to support, celebrate and recruit students, Scott has represented the university at college admission fairs and serves on the board of the Buffalo Bicycle Classic, which raises money for CU scholarships. In 2017 and 2018, he even led the Homecoming Parade down Pearl Street, ensuring that the student groups did not run into the band.\n\nWhether he’s juggling details or rousing a crowd, Scott keeps CU close to his heart.\n\nAs a Directors Club member put it, “Scott represents what it means to be a truly engaged alum, putting countless time and energy into strengthening our alumni association and alumni family.”\n\nScott Steinbrecher Award Video\n\nIf there’s a CU celebration happening in Kansas City, Alex Passett knows about it — and probably planned it. Since assuming the role of Kansas City Alumni Chapter president in 2001, the loyal Buff has hosted hundreds of CU events, including tailgates, watch parties and spirited send-offs for Boulder-bound freshmen and their parents. At the 2007 pregame he organized at Kansas State, he fed the entire CU Marching Band.\n\nEach year, Alex — senior project manager at digital marketing agency Intouch Solutions — hosts at least six football and five basketball watch parties for local Buffs fans. Representing CU, he annually volunteers at a high school college fair, and he’s led selection of the chapter’s student scholarship recipients since 2001. Alex’s enthusiasm for all things silver and gold has led to a reliable corps of 30 alumni in the Kansas City area who attend nearly every local CU event. “We’ve watched his kids grow up in front of us at tailgate parties, watch parties and picnics,” says a fellow chapter member. Alex has made his mark in Boulder, too. He served five years on the Alumni Association’s then-board of directors and was instrumental in implementing the Forever Buffs dues-free membership model in effect today. He also organized two successful fall reunions for his fraternity, Lambda Chi Alpha, drawing alumni from as far as Hawaii and Canada. Said a peer: “CU could not possibly mean more to anyone else as it does Alex.”\n\nAlex Passett Award Video\n\nSvein Hasund is the volunteer organizations yearn for. Fortunately for CU Boulder, Svein is around a lot. When Svein gives his time, which is often, he’s fully committed. He’s among the first to arrive and last to leave.\n\nAt an Alumni Association event for nearly 2,500 graduating CU seniors this spring, Svein, who was then 74, stood and greeted students for four hours straight. Immediately after the party ended, he put himself to work hauling tables without a word.\n\n“I think anyone in our organization would agree that he is our most dedicated event volunteer,” said an Alumni Association staffer.\n\nSvein’s time serving CU has more than made up for the years he lost touch with the university during his 42-year career in the oil and gas industry, both on- and off-shore. The Norway native lived in places as far away as Alaska and the UK. However, his strongest CU tie was with him the whole time: Svein met Pauline, his wife of more than 50 years, while a student here. Their sons are also CU graduates.\n\nIn addition to their own children, the couple has contributed to the lives of more than 55 babies through philanthropic efforts and foster programs.\n\nSince returning to Boulder in 2000, Svein has served on the Alumni Association and Directors Club boards among other CU commitments.\n\nAs a board peer put it: “He believes in the institution of CU and is willing to do whatever is needed to spread the word.”\n\nView Svein Hasund Award Video\n\nIf there’s a CU game to be watched, Buffs in Los Angeles know where to show up: Grunion’s Sports Bar and Grill. It’s all thanks to Barbara Cooke. As the L.A. alumni chapter leader since shortly after its founding in 1988, Barb has ensured that L.A. Buffs have a place...\n\nto watch the biggest CU athletic events. Today, the chapter remains one of the most active in the country.\n\n“Barb’s enthusiasm, love of all things CU and sincere inclusiveness were the recipe for success that set a standard for other alumni chapter gatherings,” said a former Alumni Association staff member.\n\nIn addition to the watch parties — which often include a roaring rendition of the “CU Fight Song” — Barb coordinates the yearly awarding of scholarships to Los Angeles CU students, participates in high-school college fairs and admissions events, and leads a team of alumni volunteers in organizing a range of alumni activities in the Los Angeles area from networking events to concerts. To stay current with the university, Barb often travels to Boulder.\n\n“Her leadership and mentorship as I was forming the Minneapolis/St. Paul Chapter was invaluable,” said a fellow chapter leader.\n\nThe L.A. chapter holds a special personal tie to Barbara too. At the first organizational meeting for the chapter, she met her now-husband Raymond (Fin’79), who also remains committed to its success.\n\n“I’m willing to bet that Los Angeles has the longest-running CU football watch party location outside of Colorado,” said Ray. “We’ve probably outlasted four owners of that Manhattan Beach bar, and it’s Barb who keeps it going.”\n\nBesides Barb’s involvement with the local CU alumni chapter, Barb is a former member of the CU Alumni Association Advisory Committee, and recently retired from 30 plus years as a IT Project Manager and Consultant. She also serves as a chapter leader for her Professional Organization, Project Management Institute Los Angeles, having lead that chapter as its president and now as a Trustee for the past 10 years. Barb and Ray live by the beach in Los Angeles, along with one very spoiled two year old cat, Dusty.\n\nView Barbara Cooke Award Video\n\nAs both student and proud alum, Colin Finch, a senior project manager at software firm Four Winds Interactive, has been involved in club sports, helping grow the swim team to a consistently victorious National Champion.\n\nFrom 2001-2012 Colin served on the Department of Recreation’s Board of Directors, overseeing the multi-million-dollar budget and policies. He was a vocal champion for the $63.5-million Rec Center renovation project, completed in 2014.\n\nThe day CU broke ground for the renovated Rec Center, Colin retired from his 12-year role. He had a lot to be proud of — and new ways of serving CU in mind.\n\nSince then, Colin has taken the helm of the Boulder Alumni Chapter and set his sights on bettering CU through additional roles on the executive committee of the Alumni Association Board of Advisors and the CU Directors Club.\n\nUnder his leadership the chapter has diversified the type of events it hosts and grown the number of annual events to 30. The chapter has created its own branding and has partnered with the Alumni Association, the CU Advocates, and others to engage more alumni. Currently the Chapter is building a scholarship endowment.\n\nColin is the youngest executive board member of The CU Directors Club, which offers 12 CU scholarships, contributions toward capital improvements and special projects, as well as exceptional events that enhance and engage interest in an enduring connection to CU.\n\nFor his tireless work for CU, Finch was named CU Advocate of the Year in 2015.\n\nWhen Eddie Taylor stepped atop Mount Everest in May 2022 after years of planning and training, he celebrated a much greater accomplishment than reaching the top: He just had helped double the amount of Black climbers to ever reach Everest’s summit.\n\nEddie was a member of the Full Circle climbing team, which was composed of 10 other Black climbers who raised more than $800,000 for the historic expedition. The team’s accomplishment was featured in USA Today, Outside magazine, National Geographic and CNN.\n\n“They made it to the top of the world — while also making history,” declared a USA Today article after Eddie and six other Full Circle team members reached the summit.\n\nEddie, a former CU decathlete, was approached by Phillip Henderson, the leader of the\n\nFull Circle team, while ice-climbing in Ouray.\n\n“It was his drive and passion for mountaineering that made him a great fit for the team,” said Henderson.\n\nWhile the experience on Mount Everest was memorable for Eddie, there’s one thing that has always remained a top priority for him: his students. A former water chemist, Eddie realized teaching was his calling after he began coaching track at Broomfield High School. He received his master’s degree in education from Regis University and took a position teaching science at Centaurus High School in Lafayette, Colorado, where he also serves as head track coach.\n\nWhen Phillip originally asked him to join the Everest team, Eddie was hesitant to leave during the last few weeks of the spring semester and miss his graduating seniors. His wife convinced him to go.\n\n“Eddie's climbing accomplishments are clearly deserving of attention, but we should also celebrate the work that he does each and every day as a teacher, coach and role model for students at Centaurus High School,” said Daniel Ryan, principal at Centaurus High School. “His example is inspiring the next generation to challenge themselves and find success.”\n\nThe fields of aerospace engineering and finance aren’t commonly combined when building a career path — but Brock Kowalchuk is hardly common.\n\nAfter graduating from CU Boulder in 2011, Brock spent seven years working for Goldman Sachs. During this time, he also earned a master’s degree in information and data science from UC Berkeley, before transitioning to Kaspien, an innovative e-commerce company.\n\nKnown by colleagues for his professionalism, Brock quickly climbed the ranks from senior vice president of finance to his current role as chief executive officer in four years, serving as chief financial officer and chief operations officer along the way. In these four years, Brock led the company through several rounds of funding and guided its restructuring efforts through the departure of two CEOs, before stepping into the role himself. The e-commerce company now has 80 employees, works with hundreds of brands and generates more than $100 million in revenue per year.\n\n“Brock had a unique way of entering our organization and quickly earning the respect of the company through his strong financial leadership and acumen,” said Mitchell Bailey, a former executive of the company.\n\n“He connects with people, listens to their ideas, and creates an inclusive and welcoming environment that is contagious. He has influenced significant and unprecedented change to benefit our organization, and I attribute a large portion of his abilities to his background in engineering.”\n\nIn 2018, Brock brought his storied career experience and unflappable work ethic to CU Boulder’s inaugural College of Engineering and Applied Science Graduates of the Last Decade (GOLD) Board. As co-chair, he helped establish the initial board structure and future expectations for the role, implementing clear performance indicators.\n\nUnder his leadership, the board grew to 17 members with three subcommittees and had 100% philanthropic participation from all members. During this time the board also established the now semesterly tradition of pairing engaged alumni with current students to practice their professional interviewing skills in a low-stress environment.\n\nOutside of the board, Brock has volunteered to speak on student-facing panels, sharing his life experiences. He uses his speaking opportunities with students to show that their degree can open professional doors outside of engineering. Additionally, he donates generously to the College of Engineering and Applied Science, and he believes in the power of philanthropy to support the next generation of engineers and leaders.\n\nBrock is only just getting started with his outstanding career accomplishments and is building the foundation to make meaningful contributions for years to come. Through his early successes he has remained connected and committed to CU Boulder — and to ensuring that future generations have the opportunity to make an impact wherever they go.\n\nBusiness Analytics Minor (’15)\n\nTechnology, Art and Media Minor (’15)\n\nLess than 2% of venture capital funding assists female-founded companies. Hayley Leibson is part of that 2%, and looking to increase that figure for others.\n\nIn an interview with CU Boulder in 2018, Leibson said her mission was to “inspire, motivate and move millennial women to enter the tech industry.” At the time, she was a growing name in the technology sphere and creator of the influential and wildly popular blog, “Lady in Tech,” dedicated to empowering women to pursue careers in technology.\n\nSince then, she co-founded and serves as COO of Lunchclub, an AI-powered networking site, which is expected to have more than 1 million active monthly users by the end of 2022. The startup — which matches professionals based on their goals — has raised over $30 million from top-tier investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Michael Ovitz and is valued at over $100 million.\n\nLeibson, named to Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list for consumer technology, wrote her first book, Raise Early Stage Venture Capital. She also is a key investor and advisor for women and minority-founded companies. She was named a top founder angel investor recently by Business Insider.\n\nLeibson has spoken around the world, including at Stanford and Harvard Universities, on topics ranging from startup building to diversity and inclusion. She credits some of her success to her time at CU and her studies in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences in the technology, arts and media (TAM) program.\n\n“Through TAM, I discovered the best way to make a positive impact on the world is through technology, and I have carried this belief forward ever since,” said Leibson.\n\nFor her work, Leibson was named one of Entrepreneur’s “15 Entrepreneurs Under 30 to Watch Out For” and was selected for the Women in IT Award’s 2019 Silicon Valley Rising Star of the Year Award, among other recognitions, and she has been featured on such media outlets as the BBC and ABC and in The Wall Street Journal.\n\n“We need all perspectives and viewpoints represented as we build the future,” Leibson said. “Utilizing the talent that exists means we’re assembling smarter, more innovative teams.”\n\nVanessa Aponte’s career is out of this world — quite literally. A systems engineer focused on human spaceflight and landing systems, she has spent the past two decades pursuing humanity’s final frontier.\n\nOriginally from Puerto Rico, Aponte first came to CU in 1996 as part of the Summer Multicultural Access to Research Training (SMART) program for undergraduates. There, she met the crew of NASA’s 77th space shuttle mission and was inspired to pursue an advanced degree and career in aerospace.\n\nAs she was working on her doctorate in aerospace engineering at CU, she worked on life support systems as well as controls, dynamics and propulsion at NASA’s Kennedy, Dryden and Johnson space centers.\n\nAfter graduating with her PhD, she was hired at Lockheed Martin, where she has since launched a remarkable career working on the Orion Spacecraft, leading the company’s new technology evaluation board, spearheading research and development for human space exploration and leading mission ops for the ascent element of their human landing system. Through all that, she was an astronaut candidate finalist herself … twice.\n\n“Vanessa helped pave the way for humanity’s return to the moon and "
