QUARLES, JR., NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND; AND GREGORY L. FROST, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO ---------- WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2003 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, D.C. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:34 a.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman of the committee, presiding. Present: Senators Hatch, Kyl, DeWine, Graham, Craig, Leahy, and Kennedy. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH Chairman Hatch. Okay, we are ready to go. Senator Leahy will be here shortly and we will begin. I am pleased to welcome to the Committee this morning four excellent nominees for the Federal bench. All of you are to be commended for your impressive qualifications and accomplishments, and I think congratulated without question for your nominations. Our first panel today will feature an outstanding Circuit Court nominee, Jay S. Bybee, who has been nominated to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Bybee is no stranger to this Committee or to Committee hearings, having appeared most recently before the Committee in October of 2001. We will also hear from three District Court nominees, Judge Ralph R. Erickson for the District of North Dakota; Judge William D. Quarles, Jr., for the District of Maryland; and Judge Gregory L. Frost for the Southern District of Ohio. And of course I would also like to express appreciation for the members who have taken time to come and present their views on the qualifications of our witnesses today. We will hear from them in a moment. I am especially honored to have Mr. Jay Bybee here today, who has been nominated by President Bush to serve on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Professor Bybee comes to us with a sterling resume and a record of distinguished public service. Professor Bybee is currently on leave from UNLV's William S. Boyd School of Law, where he has served as a professor since the law school's founding in 1999. He has served as an Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, the OLC, since October 2001. Notably this is a post formerly held by two current Supreme Court Justices. As head of the Office of Legal Counsel, Mr. Bybee assists the Attorney General in his function there as legal advisor to the President and all Executive Branch agencies. The office is also responsible for providing legal advice to the Executive Branch on all constitutional questions and reviewing pending legislation for constitutionality. I am sure Professor Bybee can attest that his work has been more than challenging, especially since he joined the OLC soon after the events of September 11th, but without question our Nation is lucky to have him. Professor Bybee is a Californian by birth, but he made the wise choice of attending Utah's own Brigham Young University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics, magna cum laude, and a law degree cum laude. While in law school he was a member of the BYU Law Review. Following graduation, Mr. Bybee served as a law clerk to Judge Donald Russell of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals before joining the firm of Sidley & Austin. In 1984 he accepted a position with the Department of Justice, first joining the Office of Legal Policy, and then working with the appellate staff of the Civil Division. In that capacity Mr. Bybee prepared briefs and presented oral arguments in the U.S. Courts of Appeals. From 1989 to 1991 Mr. Bybee served as Associate Counsel to President George H.W. Bush. Professor Bybee is a leading scholar in the areas of constitutional and administrative law. Before he joined the law faculty at UNLV he established his scholarly credentials at the Paul M. Hebert Law Center at Louisiana State University, where he taught from 1991 to 1998. His colleagues have described Professor Bybee as a first rate teacher, a careful and balanced scholar, and a hard-working and open-minded individual with the type of broad legal experience the Federal Bench needs. The recommendations of two individuals in particular deserve special note. Bill Marshall, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina and a former Associate White House Counsel under President Clinton, who also participated in the judicial selection process for Clinton Administration appointments while at OLP, said of Mr. Bybee: ``The combination of his analytic skills along with his personal commitment to fairness and dispassion lead me to conclude that he will serve in the best traditions of the Federal Judiciary. He understands the rule of law and he will follow it completely.'' Stuart Green, a law professor at Louisiana State University, who describes himself as a ``liberal Democrat and active member of the ACLU'' has written the committee: ``I have always found Jay Bybee to be an extremely fair- minded and thoughtful person. Indeed, Jay truly has what can best be described as a `judicious' temperament, and I would fully expect him to be a force for reasonableness and conciliation on a court that has been known for its fractiousness.'' We hear a great deal from some Committee members about the need for ``balance'' on the Federal Courts. Here we have a self-described liberal Democrat who testifies that Professor Bybee would bring some balance to the Ninth Circuit. I would welcome some balance on a court on which 14 of the 24 active judges, including 14 of the last 15 confirmed, were appointed by President Clinton. A court which is seldom out of the news and often seems to court controversy with its decisions needs some leavening once in a while. We are all familiar with the Ninth Circuit's Pledge of Allegiance ruling this past summer, and the Ninth Circuit's high reversal rate by the Supreme Court is well documented, but less known is the Ninth Circuit's propensity for reversing death sentences, some judges voting to do so almost as a matter of course. No doubt the Ninth Circuit has some of the Nation's most intelligent judges, but some just seem to not be able to follow the law. Just this term the U.S. Supreme Court has summarily reversed the Ninth Circuit three times in a 1 day, and vacated an opinion 9-0. With two judicial emergencies in the Ninth Circuit we need judges who are committed to applying and upholding the law. I firmly believe Professor Bybee represents this type of judge. I am very much looking forward to hearing from Professor Bybee today, and to working with this Committee to obtain the committee's positive recommendation to the full Senate, and to the full Senate's confirmation. He will be a terrific judge, I think by any measure. In addition to the nomination of Professor Jay S. Bybee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, we have the privilege of considering three District Court nominees. Our nominee to the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota, Judge Ralph Erickson, has carved out a stellar legal career on both sides of the bench. Judge Erickson served as a private practice litigator for more than a decade before being elevated to the State Court Bench in North Dakota 8 years ago. According to a secret poll conducted by the Forum, Fargo's daily newspaper, in 2002, Judge Erickson was selected as ``Best Judge in Cass and Clay Counties'' by a survey of over 300 lawyers in those counties. He also has experience as a city prosecutor and attorney in private practice. Judge William Quarles, our nominee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, has an impressive record in both the private and public sectors. Upon graduating from Catholic University Law School, Judge Quarles clerked for Hon. Joseph C. Howard of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. In addition to private practice experience in complex commercial, corporate, antitrust and products liability litigation, Judge Quarles has served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, primarily focusing on organized crime prosecutions. Judge Quarles is currently an Associate Circuit Judge for the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, where he has handled more than 4,000 criminal cases and tried more than 150 jury trials. That is a great record. Judge Gregory Frost, our nominee for the Southern District of Ohio, has an impressive background in the private and public sectors. Upon graduation from Ohio Northern University Law School in 1974, Judge Frost served as an assistant Licking County prosecuting attorney. In this capacity he handled a variety of cases including juvenile and felony prosecutions. From 1974 to 1983 Judge Frost was a partner at Schaller, Frost, Hostetter & Campbell, where his practice consisted of civil litigation including domestic relations law, oil and gas law, estate planning and personal injury law. From 1983 to 1990 he served as a judge for the Licking County Municipal Court, and since 1990 he has served as a judge for the Licking County Common Pleas Court. I am confident that all three of these fine nominees have the intellect, experience and temperament necessary to serve with distinction on the Federal Courts. I look forward to hearing from them today and to working with my colleagues to bring their nominations to a vote very soon. So we welcome all of you here this morning. With the understanding that as soon as Senator Leahy arrives, we will give him the opportunity of giving his opening remarks. I think what we will do is begin with you, Senator Sarbanes, and we will go across the table by seniority if I can. I am delighted to have you Senators here and Congress people here. It means a lot to us, and your recommendations are important to us. PRESENTATION OF WILLIAM D. QUARLES, JR., NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND BY HON. PAUL SARBANES, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND Senator Sarbanes. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. I am very pleased to appear before you this morning to commend to you the nomination of William Quarles to become a U.S. District Judge for the District of Maryland. You have already made comments about Judge Quarles, and I agree with those, Mr. Chairman. Judge Quarles is a native of Baltimore, a graduate of Catholic University Law School here in Washington. Following graduation he clerked for 2 years for Judge Joseph C. Howard, who I had the honor and privilege of recommending to this Committee many, many years ago. Judge Howard was the first African-American Judge to sit on the Federal District Court in our State. Following his 2-year clerkship with Judge Howard, Judge Quarles practiced shortly with a firm here in the District of Columbia, with Finley, Kumble, Wagner, and then went into the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland and served 4 years as an Assistant U.S. Attorney. He then joined the very distinguished law firm of Venable, Baetjer and Howard, one of our State's leading firms, and practiced there for 10 years. Both the experience in the U.S. Attorney's Office, trying complex criminal matters involving organized crime, and his very complex civil legal practice at Venable, Baetjer and Howard, obviously gave him I think a very important basis with which to handle trial matters. He then went on the Circuit Court in Baltimore City, which is a trial court of general jurisdiction in our State, and he has been on that trial court since 1996. So I think he brings to this nomination to the Federal Bench the kind of experience in practice, both public practice in the U.S. Attorney's Office, private practice in a leading law firm, and then actually sitting on the State Bench himself now for the past 6-1/2 years. It would obviously stand him in good stead to be a Federal District Judge. We are very proud of our Federal Bench in Maryland. Maryland Senators over the years, both Democratic and Republican, have worked assiduously to sustain the high quality of our Federal Bench. We have been fortunate that we have been able to appear before this Committee consistently in support of the nominees, and as a consequence I think our bench has gained a reputation as one of the finest District Court benches in the country. I believe that Judge Quarles will sustain and add to that reputation, and I am very pleased to come before the Committee this morning and recommend him to you. I very much hope that in the near future you will report him favorably to the floor of the United States Senate. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you so much, Senator Sarbanes. That is high praise indeed and we appreciate you being here. I will turn to you, Senator Ensign, and then we will turn to Congressman Pomeroy. PRESENATION OF JAY S. BYBEE, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT BY HON. JOHN ENSIGN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA Senator Ensign. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you having this hearing today. I appreciate you bringing nominee Bybee before the Committee today. I am here representing myself to recommend Jay Bybee, but also Senator Reid. Senator Reid is very strongly behind Jay Bybee as well. Both of us have gotten to know Jay on a personal level as well as on a professional level over the least several years. I would ask that my full statement be made part of the record with your consent. Chairman Hatch. Without objection. Senator Ensign. Mr. Chairman, just a few thoughts and a few observations on Jay Bybee. First of all, the UNLV Boyd School of Law, which is a new law school, looks like it is going to get its full accreditation, one of the fastest law schools in history to do that. Jay Bybee was an outstanding member of the faculty at the Boyd School of Law. It is interesting to note, when you talked about the balance needed on the Ninth Circuit, Jay Bybee provided a lot of balance at the Boyd School of Law, and talking to some of the people there that were more of the liberal professors at the Boyd School of Law, Jay Bybee was well thought of by conservatives in the legal community as well as liberals in the legal community in the State of Nevada I think that the job that he has done since he has been at Justice has shown the type of temperament and the type of thoughtful person that he is going to be on the Ninth Circuit. For those of us who live in the West, we have not necessarily been pleased by a lot of the actions that the Ninth Circuit has brought forward, and I think that Jay Bybee is going to be an intellectual giant on that court. And I do not say that lightly. I think that viewing and reading some of his statements and some of his publications that he has put out, you can tell how thoughtful he is, how he respects the law, and how he respects equal justice under the law. So I am here to offer my strongest recommendation to this committee, that you favorably move Jay Bybee to the floor of the Senate, where hopefully we can approve him as quickly as possible. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. Thank you so much, Senator Ensign. We appreciate that. Because of his heavy duties, we will turn to Senator Reid at this time, so that he can get back to the floor. PRESENTATION OF JAY S. BYBEE, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT BY HON. HARRY REID, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEVADA Senator Reid. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. These hearings are always very educational, not only for the people on the panel and of course the people that are appearing before the panel, but for Senators, because, John, I never realized we had a liberal member of the faculty at UNLV Law School. [Laughter.] Chairman Hatch. It would be a very rare faculty if you did not. [Laughter.] Senator Reid. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, I am very happy to be here to commend my friend, Jay Bybee, to be a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I am pleased that Mr. Bybee will be given an opportunity to discuss his excellent legal qualifications, judicial philosophy and other issues with the members of this committee. The committee's work is vitally important to gathering a record upon which each and every Senator may rely on discharging the constitutional duty we have to consent to the President's judicial nominees. Chairman Leahy is not here, but I wanted to commend him for his hard work during his 15-month tenure as Chairman of the committee, where he worked to approve 100 judges that were sent forward by President Bush. During Senator Leahy's chairmanship these nominees moved in the order the President sent them to the Senate. Time ran out in the 107th Congress without any action on Mr. Bybee's nomination. Under Chairman Hatch's leadership today the Committee will her that Mr. Bybee has received a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association. His legal skills certainly merit this distinction. Mr. Bybee served as legal advisor in the first Bush Administration, and has helped to each a generation of new lawyers as a former professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas Boyd School of Law. I was pleased to introduce with my friend, Senator Ensign, Mr. Bybee to the Committee just a short time ago for the position he now holds as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice. And something that is not in my prepared remarks but I think will, in my estimation, is more important than all these legal qualifications that this fine man has, and that is what a fine family man he is. He has a wonderful family. I had the opportunity on a flight from Florida recently to spend some time with his wife. She is a lovely woman. She has a great understanding of what his job is. So I, without any qualification, ask this Committee to approve as quickly as possible Jay Bybee to be a member of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Chairman Hatch. Thank you, Senator Reid. You and Senator Ensign working together, I think make a tremendous difference with regard to an nominees that you bring forward, so we are very grateful to have both of you here, and grateful to have your testimony here. Senator Reid. Could we be excused, Mr. Chairman? Chairman Hatch. Sure can. Congressman Pomeroy, if you can just wait, I think I had better finish with Judge Quarles. Senator Mikulski. Mr. Pomeroy, are you okay? Do you have a vote? Mr. Pomeroy. No, I am good. I am fine, Senator. Thank you. Chairman Hatch. If you do, let me know, because I will interrupt anything. Mr. Pomeroy. I am just fine. Chairman Hatch. If we can go to Senator Mikulski, then we will do that. PRESENTATION OF WILLIAM D. QUARLES, JR., NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND BY HON. BARBARA MIKULSKI, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND Senator Mikulski. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. I know that the advise and consent function that we perform in terms of the Judicial Branch is one of our highest and most important duties. When I always look at who should be a judge, I look at three criteria, their competence that they bring, their sense of integrity as individuals, and also their dedication to protecting core constitutional values and guarantees. I come here today with real enthusiasm to recommend that this Committee approve the nomination for William Quarles to become a member of the Federal Bench. I wanted to nominate him 10 years ago. The Maryland system put forth his when--if you might, Bush I or Bush the Elder, or Bush 41, however we do it-- Mr. Quarles was then up for nomination. Well, time ran out, politics changed. So here we are one decade later, and I come with enthusiasm to do this. We have a tradition in Maryland that regardless of who is the party in power, we really put forward the best of the best to be our judges. Mr. Quarles brings great intellect and great integrity. He was born in Baltimore, attended Baltimore area schools, City College, Catholic University. He comes from a really wonderful family. His father was a stevedore and dock worker. He learned the values of hard work and the importance of education. His sister is a minister. His daughter, Eloise, is a successful securities lawyer. His dear wife, Mary Ann, works for the District Court of Maryland as a pretrial service specialist. So you can see what his roots are. Having learned hard work and excellent education, he went on then to be a law clerk for Judge Joe Howard, who was a civil rights activist and was the first African-American appointed to the Federal Bench in Baltimore. But he comes not only with a background that is personal qualities and values; he comes with a great legal career. Early on he worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Baltimore, handling complex and civil litigation. He coordinated the President's Task Force on Drug Enforcement, got a lot of awards for that. He left that and then went to one of our most prestigious white-shoe law firms, Venable, Baetjer and Howard in Baltimore. You might recall, Mr. Chairman, that is the law firm that gave us Ben Civiletti, who was an Attorney General. At Venable he handled civil litigation, antitrust and appeals. He was promoted to manager of the D.C. litigation practice. Then in 1996 he was placed on the Maryland Circuit Court in Baltimore City. This is Maryland's highest trial court, where he has now served with distinction, presiding over major civil and very serious and violent criminal matters. While on the bench he chaired the Sentencing Review Panel for the Eighth Circuit, coordinated the electronic filing project. He brings technology to the bench. And also, how do his peers feel about him? Well, not only is he a member of all relevant bars in Maryland, but the American Bar Association, with the majority of evaluation, gives him ``very qualified.'' He has written in Maryland Bar, Inside Litigation. He is active in his church and community and gets awards from everything from the Boy Scouts to the DEA. So as you can see, I think we have really a wonderful and distinguished person to present to you from Maryland. I do it without reservation and with great enthusiasm, and I hope the Committee puts him forth to our colleagues. I think you will be proud as Senator Sarbanes and I are of Judge Quarles. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you, Senator Mikulski. Your recommendation means a lot to the committee, along with Senator Sarbanes, and we really appreciate you taking time to be with us today. And I think, Judge Quarles, you have got some pretty heavy firepower behind you. And that is good. Senator Mikulski. And we are saying this about a member of the other party, you know what I mean? [Laughter.] Chairman Hatch. That really is an exceptional thing, let me tell you. We are grateful to see you here. Senator Mikulski. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And, Congressman, thank you for the courtesy. Mr. Pomeroy. Thank you. Chairman Hatch. Senator Dorgan, Congressman Pomeroy has been waiting a long time. Can I just have him-- Senator Dorgan. Absolutely. Chairman Hatch. I think he needs to get back over to the House. With your permission and deference, I would like to do that. Senator Dorgan. Of course. PRESENTATION OF RALPH R. ERICKSON, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NORTH DAKOTA BY HON. EARL POMEROY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Representative Pomeroy. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I will be brief, but I do want to commend to your attention the President's nomination for the opening in the bench in North Dakota. Judge Ralph Erickson is someone I have known for 23 years. Prior to his time as the District Bench in 1994, Ralph throughout those years was an active Republican and I have been an active Democrat, but we have maintained a close friendship. I have enormous respect for him. After assuming his role on the District Bench we have really been able to see what a wonderful jurist Ralph has proven to be. He is competent, fair minded, hard working, conscientious, has impeccable integrity, and as a result has really demonstrated a superb judicial temperament. He has told me that his personal philosophy is to treat lawyers like he would like to be treated when he was a lawyer, and that means being prepared, listening, understanding the law as best as possible. As he has applied these values, it has shown, because he has run for re-election to the bench without opposition, and the lawyers in this poll you referenced in your introductory remarks, Mr. Chairman, a survey of Fargo/Morehead lawyers rated him simply the best, the best of the District Bench. So I think the President has made a superb choice in advancing for your consideration Judge Ralph Erickson, and I echo my whole-hearted support. He will be an excellent addition to the bench in North Dakota. Chairman Hatch. Well, thank you, Congressman Pomeroy. We appreciate you taking time to come over to the lesser body and speak to us. We are grateful to have your testimony, and that weighs very heavily in favor of the Judge. Representative Pomeroy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. Senator Dorgan, we are honored to have you here. PRESENTATION OF RALPH R. ERICKSON, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NORTH DAKOTA BY HON. BYRON DORGAN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA Senator Dorgan. Senator Hatch, thank you very much. I am pleased to be here. I will not add too much to what Congressman Pomeroy said. Congressman Pomeroy, Senator Conrad and I feel all pretty much the same about this candidate. Judge Ralph Erickson has been nominated. I fully support and enthusiastically support his nomination. I think he will make an excellent Federal Judge in the U.S. District Court in North Dakota, on the east side of North Dakota. He is a native of Thief River Falls, Minnesota. His J.D. was received with distinction from the University of North Dakota. He spent 9 years in private practice before becoming a District Judge, Cass County Magistrate first, then a District Judge for the East District Judicial District. He has presided over some of the most high profile cases in our region, and as you indicated, and as Congressman Pomeroy did, the largest newspaper in our State indicated that he is the best in the region in their evaluation. I think the staff on both sides of the Judiciary Committee received that word when they called around North Dakota as well. The kind of reaction they received, fair, hard working, even tempered, thoughtful, good reputation. Those are exactly the kinds of things you want to hear about a judge. My understanding is he is one of the few people who will come before this Committee who has actually been in prison. He as an intern at Leavenworth when he was in law school. [Laughter.] Chairman Hatch. We like to hear that. [Laughter.] Senator Dorgan. He may want to tell you more about that, but he also is someone--I had about 2 months ago the opportunity to sit in his courtroom. I asked if I could be allowed to sit in the Youth Drug Court that he presides over. And I sat there I guess an hour and a half or so that day and watched, late afternoon, and watched Judge Erickson deal with some young offenders, young men and women who came before him. I must tell you, not only is that a terrific idea and a very important part of our system, but I was very impressed with the way Judge Erickson handled that. He is a credit to the Judiciary, and if we are able to put more and more people like Judge Ralph Erickson on the Federal Bench, the Judiciary in this country will be in very good hands. So I am here to say that this is an excellent nomination. I am proud to support him. I think you all will be very proud to confirm that with an affirmative vote, and I know that he has been accompanied by his wife and his children and others, and I am sure he will introduce them at an appropriate time. Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding the hearing and I hope we will move this nomination quickly. Chairman Hatch. Thank you very much, Senator Dorgan. We really appreciate your taking time from what we know is a very busy schedule. Thanks for your honoring the judge. We will now turn to the distinguished Democratic leader on the committee. Senator Leahy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Like all of us, I was-- Chairman Hatch. Senator, could you-- Senator Leahy. Sure. Chairman Hatch. I forgot to do one thing. Senator Conrad very much wanted to be here today to introduce Judge Erickson, but unfortunately had a scheduling conflict he just could not change, so I am pleased to submit his written statement for the record in favor of Judge Erickson. [The prepared statement of Senator Conrad appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Hatch. I am sorry. I just thought that would be better to get that in at this time. STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Senator Leahy. And I am sorry I missed our colleagues, but each one of them have talked to me, at one time or another, about the nominees who are here. Like all of us, we end up with about three different committees going on at the same time. Here, we are going to hear four nominees for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench--one to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, three to District Courts in North Dakota, Maryland and Ohio. The arrangement, one Court of Appeals judge, three District judges, basically follows years of precedent in the way we schedule these. I think it is more reasonable and more sensible than what we faced last week, when we had three Circuit Court nominees at one time, all three controversial, and there in a hearing until about 10 o'clock at night, a rather rushed hearing. Here, having one Circuit Court nominee, we are able to give each of the people who have traveled here with their families and friends the kind of attention they deserve. I compliment the Chairman for doing it this way, as compared to last week. I thought having three controversial nominees scheduled together meant that none were adequately discussed. At the same time, I do not want to go back to the days, for example, when this Committee did not hold a single hearing on a judicial nominee until mid-June, as was the case in 1999. I think we could work on more fair schedules, as we have had in the past 17 months, where we were able to get 100 judges through in that time. Today, the Circuit Court nominee before us is Jay Bybee. He is currently serving in the Justice Department as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, OLC, and the head of OLC serves as the Attorney General's lawyer, and advises him on legal issues underlying Administration and Department policies. In the wake of September 11th, Mr. Bybee's responsibilities have included rendering opinions on many controversial decisions that have come from the Justice Department, including its ability to try terrorist suspects in military tribunals; its ability to use State and local police to make arrests for civil violations of immigration laws; its use of gun purchase databases to track terrorist suspects; its decision that, contrary to Secretary of State Colin Powell's opinion, they did not need to declare the al Qaeda and Taliban detainees prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention, and I assume other controversial policies. So I am interested in his views on these questions of law. I am concerned the role he may have played in perpetuating the culture of secrecy that has enveloped the Justice Department over the past couple of years. The office which he heads has long been a leader in sharing its work with the American public, and in recent years that office even began publishing its legal opinions on a yearly basis. Many of these opinions are available in legal databases. I think they provide a very valuable tool for lawyers and nonlawyers, just to understand how the legal underpinnings of our Government work. But of the 1,187 OLC opinions that have been published on the Lexis legal database since 1996, only three are from the period when Mr. Bybee headed the office. Up until now, there has also been a history of OLC releasing numbers of opinions on the Department of Justice website, where all Americans, from students to retirees, can, with the click of a mouse, pick them up. They have also responded, of course, to requests by the Judiciary Committee, under either Republican or Democratic leadership, but that practice, too, has ended under Mr. Bybee's leadership at OLC. A Government works best when it is open and answers questions, and I am worried that we see a change from both Republican and Democratic administrations of openness, and if we go to this nondisclosure, then I think it follows this pattern of an expansive view of executive privilege that has marked the time that Mr. Bybee has been in Government, and I want to hear from him on that issue. This is something, this lack of openness, concerns have been expressed by me, by Senator Specter, by Senator Grassley, by Senator Hatch, by Senator Schumer and by a number of other son this committee. Now, the District Court nominees from North Dakota, Ohio, Maryland appear to be more moderate and bipartisan than the President's Circuit Court nominations. Judge Erickson is currently a judge in the East Central District Court of North Dakota. He is supported by both of the Democratic home-State Senators, well-respected in his community as being a hardworking, thoughtful, fair, even-tempered judge. Incidentally, I was pleased to see, Mr. Chairman, that Judge Erickson has been involved in developing an initiative in Fargo to assist juveniles involved in drug crimes, and he will be joining the other judge from North Dakota that we approved when I was chairman, Judge Hovland. We will hear from Judge Quarles, who is nominated in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. He has served as an attorney in private practice, assistant U.S. attorney in Baltimore before becoming a Circuit Judge of the Circuit Court for the City of Baltimore. He is supported by both the Democratic Senators from his home State. And Judge Frost, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, has been on the bench for 12 years. He is either currently or formerly a member of numerous charitable and civic organizations. I would like to note that he has been very principled in ensuring the organizations of which he is a member do not discriminate, including, if he thought that they did, to leave. I would also note that he is supported by both the Senators from his home State, both Senator DeWine, a valued member of this committee, and our friend, Senator Voinovich, a highly respected member of the Senate. So thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. Thank you, Senator Leahy. We will now turn, last, but not least, and very importantly, to our colleague on the committee, Senator DeWine, to speak about our judge from Ohio. PRESENTATION OF GREGORY L. FROST, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO BY HON. MIKE DEWINE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OHIO Senator DeWine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much. It is certainly my pleasure to introduce to the Members of the Committee Judge Gregory Frost. My friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, certainly wanted to be here with us today, but unfortunately will not be able to attend, but he did ask me, Mr. Chairman, to submit his statement to the record, and I would ask, with unanimous consent, it be made part of the record. Chairman Hatch. Without objection. [The prepared statement of Senator Voinovich appears as a submission for the record.] Senator DeWine. Judge Frost, as has been pointed out, has been nominated by the President of the United States to serve as a United States District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio. He currently serves as judge on the Licking County Common Pleas Court of Newark, Ohio. So I would like to welcome to the Committee several people who are here to support Judge Frost: First, his wife Kristina Dix Frost and his son Wes. We welcome both of them to the committee. Kris and Wes, thank you very much for being here with us today. I would also like to welcome Judge Frost's mother Mildred; his mother-in-law Helen Dix; his sister Beth Thomas and her husband Kim; as well as Doug McMarlin, a good friend of the Frost family; Sarah Barrickman, Judge Frost's law clerk; and Shawn Judge, a friend of Judge Frost. Also here to show their support are Mike Nicks, an attorney from Newark, as well as Nancy Dillon and a man named Leonard, both friends of the Frost family. Judge Frost is a 1971 graduate of Wittenberg University. Judge Frost received his law degree in 1974 from Ohio Northern University. Judge Frost's long career in both public service and private practice makes him well-qualified for the District Court. He has been a Licking County judge for the past 19 years, serving as Municipal Court judge from 1983 to 1990, and then, Mr. Chairman, as Common Pleas judge from 1990 until the present. While serving on the bench, Judge Frost was selected to take the lead in writing the jury instructions for the entire State of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, of course, we all know the importance of jury instructions. These jury instructions, of course, provide the framework in which all jury cases in the State of Ohio are deliberated. Prior to his service on the bench, Judge Frost was a partner in the law firm of Schaller, Frost, Hostetter and Campbell in Newark. While with that firm, he also served as an assistant Licking County prosecutor from 1974 until 1978. Judge Frost is an excellent jurist whose dedication and graciousness have earned him the respect of those inside and outside of the courtroom. Now, Mr. Chairman, I was particularly struck by a letter Gary Walters, the Clerk of Courts in Licking County, wrote to the Newark Advocate newspaper. This is what he said regarding Judge Frost, and I quote: ``He arrives to work well before daybreak and before anyone else in the courthouse. He works hard all day, and routinely is the last one to leave in the evenings.'' Similar to you, Mr. Chairman. I note that from having an office right next to yours. Chairman Hatch. That is a very habit. Senator DeWine. I know. I do not think he plays music as loud as you do, though, Mr. Chairman. He probably does not write music either, I do not think. [Laughter.] Senator DeWine. ``His work ethic is second to none. As Clerk of Courts, I am in the courtroom with Judge Frost. He recognizes that jury service is difficult and sometimes unpleasant. With his sense of humor and his willingness to explain every step of the process, he puts the jurors at ease and makes the experience an educational one. Many jurors have made a point to tell me that their jury experience was extraordinarily valuable because of the attention Judge Frost devoted to preparing them for their duties.'' Mr. Chairman, this statement provides, I believe, an excellent illustration of both Judge Frost's temperament in the courtroom and his dedication to his position. In addition to that, Judge Frost has committed a great deal of time and energy to his Licking County community. He has served on the board of directors of the Licking County Alcoholism Prevention Program, and the Maryhaven Alcohol and Drug Addiction Treatment Center in Columbus. He is also an Executive Committee member of the Central Ohio Council of the Boy Scouts of America. Indeed, as a lifelong resident of Licking County, Judge Frost has made significant contributions to his community. Without question, Judge Frost will be a fine addition to the District Court. He has the experience, Mr. Chairman, the temperament and the dedication to be an excellent Federal judge. I might add, Mr. Chairman, on a personal note, that I have known Judge Frost for many, many years, and I believe that he is the type person that we need to serve on the Federal District Court. I strongly support his nomination, and I thank the chair for the time. Chairman Hatch. Thank you, Senator. Before we begin, let me just say that I want everybody here on the Committee and all staff to listen very good to what I have to say. I was outraged today to read all over the paper today, including in Al Kamen's column in the Washington Post, information that was contained in the ``confidential'' section of the committee's file on Mr. Bybee. This is wrong. It is outrageous, and it is dirty politics, and it is violative of Committee rules that are very, very important rules that have been abided by. This is the worst I have seen since the Clarence Thomas hearings. Now, Senator Leahy, when he was chairman, changed the Committee questionnaire to move some of the nominees' information, normally in the FBI files, into the ``confidential'' section. Now, I want everybody to know that we are going to go back to what the Committee has always done before. The FBI files are to be held in confidence, and nobody is to breach that confidence, and I think this is a perfect illustration why we need to do that. So, just so everybody is put on record, we are just not going to put up with that type of stuff, and I am going to investigate it and see if we can get to the bottom of it. No nominee should be treated any differently than we treated the nominees during the Clinton administration. They are to be treated exactly the same, whether they are President Bush's nominees or anybody else's. Having said that, Mr. Bybee, if you could get ready to stand and raise your right arm to be sworn. Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before the Committee will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God? Mr. Bybee. I do. Chairman Hatch. Thank you. Senator Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to have the opportunity to inquire of Mr. Bybee. We are, as you know, there is an important conference on Haitian refugee policy, which is a matter of very important consequence to our Refugee Committee here, which I was at earlier today, and now I understand that the Secretary of State is going to be addressing the Security Council on one of the most important probably moments, in terms of American history, which will be very significant on the issues of war and peace. So I am not going to be able to be here for the time of Mr. Powell's speech to the Security Council. I think I have a responsibility to do that, but I do have questions, so I will try and work this out with the chair. I do not have enormous numbers, but I do have questions that I would like to ask the nominee at some time. Chairman Hatch. Well, we will accommodate the distinguished Senator and former Chairman of the committee, of course. We would like to finish the hearings as soon as we can, but if you could come right back-- Senator Kennedy. I would be glad to come over right after Mr. Powell's address when it is finished. Chairman Hatch. If you will, that would be great. We will reserve that time for you. Senator Kennedy. Thank you. Chairman Hatch. What we may do is ask some questions of Mr. Bybee and then bring up the other judges until you come back. Senator Kennedy. That is fine. Thank you. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Well, let us begin then, and we will reserve that time. I would like to see that myself, but I think we better move ahead here. Mr. Bybee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. I will be able to see it on C-SPAN, I am sure. But I do not blame any Senator for wanting to see that. This is an historic moment, and I personally just want to express my regard for Colin Powell and the terrific job he is doing as Secretary of State and for his resolute strength in this administration. I have tremendous respect for him, always have, and it has grown in my eyes even more since he has been acting as Secretary of State. So this is an important, historic time, and I cannot blame any Senators for wanting to see that. I would like to myself. But we are going to move ahead here so that we do not inconvenience our judges, and then what we will have to do, Mr. Bybee, if we finish with our questions, we will move ahead with the other judges and put you in abeyance until Senator Kennedy and any other Democrat or Republican who wants to question will come back. But let me just ask a few basic questions of you so that we uncover some of the things that I think are critical. The Founding Fathers believed that the separation of the powers in the Government was critical to protecting the liberty of the people. Thus, they separated the legislative, the executive and the judicial powers into three different branches of Government, so-called co-equal powers: The legislative power being the power to balance moral, economic and political considerations and make law; the judicial power being the power only to interpret laws made by Congress and by other people, which sometimes involve the President, through Executive Order and otherwise; the judicial power being the power to interpret laws, something that we have really been concerned about on this Committee because of the actions of some of the judges and the various Circuit Courts of Appeals and, in particular, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In your view, is it the proper role of a Federal judge, when interpreting a statute or a Constitution, to accept the balance struck by the Congress of the people or to rebalance the competing moral, economic and political considerations? Mr. Bybee. Thank you for that thoughtful question, Mr. Chairman. The separation of powers was fundamental to our constitutional design, and fundamental to that design was the idea that neither of the branches, none of the branches, should exercise any of the power of the other branches. When the Federal Courts seek to balance important moral or political decisions, they usurp the power of this body, the Congress of the United States, and that is not the appropriate role of the courts of the United States. They have been given substantial powers under our Constitution, but it is the power of interpretation, not the power of decision in the first instance, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Hatch. Thank you. You know, I have been very rude here because I have not given you a chance to even make an opening statement and, above all, I would like you to introduce your family and your friends who are here. I apologize to you. I am so anxious to get you through that-- [Laughter.] Chairman Hatch. I think sometimes I place that above everything else. So please forgive me, but I would like you to make any statement you care to make, and of course introduce your family and friends who are here. STATEMENT OF JAY S. BYBEE, OF NEVADA, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT Mr. Bybee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have many members of my family here that I would like to introduce, and I have many friends and colleagues who have attended as well. I will forebear from introducing friends and colleagues in the interest of time, but I appreciate the opportunity of introducing my family. Seated behind me is my lovely wife Dianna, my wife next week as of 17 years. We have four children, and I will ask them to stand because they may be a little short. My oldest, Scott, is 15; my son David is 12; my daughter Alyssa is 10; my son Ryan is 8. Chairman Hatch. That is great. We are glad to have you young people with us, I will tell you. Mr. Bybee. My mother, Joan Bybee is here in the front row as well. Someplace in the back are my wife's parents, Harvey and Nada Greer, who came in last night from Sacramento, California. I appreciate them making the trip. Chairman Hatch. Please stand as well so we can see you. Great. Glad to have you here. Welcome. Mr. Bybee. I have all of my siblings and their spouses are here. My brother David and his wife Rene. Chairman Hatch. Please stand. We want to look everybody over. These are important positions. [Laughter.] Mr. Bybee. My sister Karen and her husband Jeff Holdaway, and two of their children, Christopher and Cameron Holdaway. Chairman Hatch. Karen worked up here on Capitol Hill and did a great job while she was here. Mr. Bybee. My youngest brother Lynn and his wife Melissa. Chairman Hatch. Welcome. Mr. Bybee. Have I left anybody out? Oh, my niece Kelli Frazier is here. Chairman Hatch. Great. Nice to have you, Kelli. Mr. Bybee. We have additional extended family and additional friends in the audience, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much. Chairman Hatch. Yes, I see a lot of your friends out there in the audience. It is just great. Welcome to all of you. We are grateful that you here. I have tremendous respect for Mr. Bybee, and I think everybody who has had any contact with him also shares that respect. Do you have anything else you care to say? Mr. Bybee. No, Mr. Chairman, but I do thank you for holding this hearing and affording me the opportunity of talking before the Committee today. Chairman Hatch. We will give 10 minutes for each person to ask questions and maybe some more to others who want to ask some more. The making of the law is a very serious matter. To make constitutional or statutory law, the text of a proposed amendment or statute must obtain a set number of formal approval of the people's elected representatives. Now, this formal approval embodies the express will of the people, through their elected representatives, and thus raises the particular words of a statute or constitutional provision to the status of binding law. Would you agree that the further a judicial opinion varies from the text and original intent of a statute or constitutional provision, the less legal legitimacy it has? Mr. Bybee. Yes, Mr. Chairman. This is a very important question, and it is a very important challenge for the judiciary to recognize that Congress is a collegial body, representing a diverse group of Americans and that Congress has come together and has undertaken a difficult process of arriving at consensus, and that ought not to be undone by a single judge or by even a single panel of judges who are not representative and have been given certain protections under our Constitution that indeed ensures that they will not be subject to the kind of political pressure that this body is rightfully subject to, that kind of--that's a check of the people. And for a judge or for any panel of judges to undertake that responsibility is to assume the responsibility of the legislature and act as a political body. Chairman Hatch. Do you think that it is the proper role of a Federal judge to uphold the legitimate will of the people, as expressed in the law, or to basically impose his or her own view of what that judge thinks the law to be? Mr. Bybee. Mr. Chairman, the responsibility of the judge, as Chief Justice Marshall said as early as Marbury v. Madison, it is to say what the law is. Chairman Hatch. Well, under what circumstances do you believe it appropriate for a Federal Court to declare a statute enacted by Congress unconstitutional? Mr. Bybee. Mr. Chairman, that is a very good question. That is a question the law professors are always very excited to discuss in class, and I think it is a hard challenge for judges to undertake that responsibility to review for constitutionality statutes enacted by Congress. On the one hand, Senator, any judge should begin from the assumption that legislation is constitutional. We must begin from that because you have taken the same oath to uphold the same Constitution that the judges have. Now, aside from that, it is the responsibility of the Judicial Branch, from time-to-time, to strike down where it believes that Congress has overstepped its bounds in certain legislation. In those rare cases, the judiciary should examine carefully the text of the statute and ensure that it really does not comport with the plain text of the Constitution. Chairman Hatch. In general, the Supreme Court precedents are binding on all lower Federal Courts and all Circuit Court precedents are binding on the courts within that particular circuit. Now, are you committed to following the precedents of higher courts faithfully and giving them full faith, and credit and effect, even if you personally disagree with these precedents? Mr. Bybee. Senator, any judge who assumes this responsibility must set aside his or her personal beliefs as they enter the courtroom door. They are not appointed in their personal capacity as a judge, and it is their responsibility to interpret the law faithfully. Chairman Hatch. What would you do, if you conclude very honestly, and you believe that the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals had seriously erred in rendering a decision, would you nevertheless apply that decision or would you apply your own best judgment on the merits? Mr. Bybee. Senator, one of the Framers commented that the Constitution was established that it might be a Government of laws and not a Government of men. I would faithfully apply the precedent of my circuit and the precedent established by the Supreme Court. I think to do otherwise would be chaotic, and I think disserves the people who then cannot count on understanding what the law is. They have no way of knowing what law will be applied if a judge is free to ignore the dictates of higher courts. Chairman Hatch. It would not be long for the Constitution to go down the drain if we had judges just doing what they felt within their souls was right, rather than applying the law, as the precedents demand. Mr. Bybee. It would be chaotic, Senator. Chairman Hatch. Yes, it would. Well, if there were no controlling precedent, dispositively concluding an issue with which you are presented in your circuit, to what sources would you apply to obtain persuasive authority? Mr. Bybee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I faced a situation in which there were no controlling precedents, then I would begin with the text of the statute. That is the clearest record of what Congress meant. I begin with the text of the statute. In those cases in which there might be some ambiguity that cannot be resolved by referring directly to the text of the statute or to the broader structure of the act that it is a part of or to some clear understanding or history, then I would look to other tools that would help me understand what Congress meant. Chairman Hatch. In what circumstances, if any, do you believe an appellate judge should overturn precedent within his or her own circuit? Mr. Bybee. Mr. Chairman, that's a hard question, and I think that's one that each judge will have to decide for himself or herself. The second Justice Harlan I think took the position that he would dissent three times to make his views known where he believed that the Court had erred, and then he would accept the circuit precedent or the Supreme Court's precedent. In the case where you have a firm belief that the Court has plainly made a mistake Circuit Courts may revisit their decisions, but I think that would take a very, very careful weighing of what compelled the decision in the first place, how long it had been in place, what kind of reliance people or companies or States had placed upon that decision, and I think one would have to think very carefully, long and hard, before one would overturn it. Nevertheless, Senator, there certainly are a number of instances in the Supreme Court and in the Courts of Appeals where courts have been compelled to overturn themselves where they believed that they did make a mistake. Chairman Hatch. Thank you. My time is up. I am going to turn to Senator DeWine. Senator DeWine. Mr. Bybee, Senator Leahy raised some important points about some activities in which the Department of Justice has engaged. As you are aware, this Committee does have jurisdiction over oversight over the Department of Justice. Let me a"
