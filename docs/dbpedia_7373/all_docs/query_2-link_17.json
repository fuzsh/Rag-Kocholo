FIRESTONE, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS; LYDIA KAY GRIGGSBY, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS; AND THOMAS L. HALKOWSKI, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ---------- WEDNESDAY, JUNE 4, 2014 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:02 a.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Leahy and Grassley. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT Chairman Leahy. Well, good morning. Today we are going to hear from four very well qualified judicial nominees--one to the district court in the State of Vermont, without being overly parochial, and three to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. I am happy to welcome Vermont Supreme Court Justice Geoffrey Crawford. Justice Crawford has significant criminal and civil experience. He was a Vermont trial court judge for 11 years; he recently became an Associate Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. In fact, the Governor's comment to me when I recommended Justice Crawford to the President was, ``Hey, you are taking one of our best Supreme Court Justices.'' He formerly was a partner in a Burlington law firm. And I am glad to see Jerry O'Neill here in the audience. Justice Crawford earned his B.A., cum laude, from Yale and his J.D., cum laude, from Harvard Law School. I recommended Justice Crawford to President Obama after he was vetted and recommended to me by Vermont's nonpartisan Judicial Nominating Commission. I did not know him before this process, but I read the report of those who did the work of the Nominating Commission, and then I met for an extended time, Kristine Lucius, Chief Counsel, and myself, and John Tracy, the head of the Vermont office, with Justice Crawford, and I was struck by his brilliance, his compassion, his humility, and his devotion to his family. He has earned a stellar reputation in Vermont's legal community and from those who appeared before him as a careful jurist who understands the effects that legal rulings have on people's lives. I have no doubt that once confirmed he will bring the same understanding and impartiality to the Federal judiciary in Vermont. We are just one district, but he will be sitting in Rutland, Vermont. Then we have three nominees to serve on the Court of Federal Claims: Judge Nancy Firestone, who is well known to the most important member of this Committee, Kristine Lucius; Thomas Halkowski; and Lydia Griggsby, who has served on my Judiciary Committee staff since 2006 and currently serves as my Chief Counsel for Privacy and Information Policy. I recommended Lydia to the President for the position because I know her intellect and good judgment will make her a fine judge. And that is what I told the President. Before Lydia came to work with me on the Committee, she served in the Justice Department. She tried several matters before the Court of Federal Claims. I did tell her father this morning that the one reason I might vote against her is to keep her here on the Committee. But I will proudly vote for her. Judge Nancy Firestone has served with distinction on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims since 1998, and I am sure she will continue that with another 15-year term. And Mr. Halkowski is a principal at Fish and Richardson; that is a law firm specializing in intellectual property law in Wilmington, Delaware. He started off clerking on the Court to which he is nominated for Judge Roger Andewelt. He also clerked for then-Chief Judge Helen Nies on the Federal Circuit, so once he is confirmed, his career will have gone full circle. I welcome you all, but I will turn first, of course, to my friend and colleague Senator Grassley. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHUCK GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA Senator Grassley. First, I congratulate today's nominees, and I know your families and friends that are here are proud of you. And, of course, professionally it is an important milestone in all of your careers, and so I welcome you. I will not go into the details he did, the Chairman did, but I can associate myself with those remarks and point out that I know today's hearing is of particular significance for the Chairman because I have had an opportunity to have a lot of Iowans in the same place that you are from Vermont for the Chairman. And so it is important for the Chairman as well as it is for you. Not only do we have a nominee for the District of Vermont, but we also have a nominee for the Court of Federal Claims, Ms. Griggsby, whom we all know very well. She has been a counsel on the Chairman's staff, and just like I have people leave my staff, he is going to miss you as well when you go to this very important position you have been appointed to. I know that you joined the Committee staff after being both in the Department of Justice as well as the U.S. Attorney's Office. We know Lydia well. She has worked on many important Committee matters, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act, and other privacy issues. Through that work Lydia has a well-earned reputation of being diligent, very thoughtful, and professional. Ms. Griggsby, you are now in a seat that several of your colleagues have occupied before you, fielding questions from all of us. So once again, even though I only spoke about two of the four, congratulations to all of you. Chairman Leahy. Thank you very much. Please, all four of you, stand and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give in this matter will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Justice Crawford. I do. Judge Firestone. I do. Ms. Griggsby. I do. Mr. Halkowski. I do. Chairman Leahy. Let the record show that all responded in the affirmative. We will begin with you, Justice Crawford. If you have any statement you would like to make, please go ahead, and you may introduce your family. STATEMENT OF HON. GEOFFREY W. CRAWFORD, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF VERMONT Justice Crawford. Yes, Senator, I would like to thank the Members of the Committee for their time and attention. I would like to thank you in particular for the trust that you have placed in me. And I would like to introduce my family, if I might. My wife, Leslie, is here, and my children: my daughter, Jocelyn, and her son, Matthew; and her husband and older daughter, Evelyn, who is 3, are home in Wisconsin. My son Tobias and my son Elliott; and my daughter-in-law, Christine, and her son, James; and my son, Nicholas. And with me also is my dear friend and former law partner, Jerry O'Neill. Chairman Leahy. Who I might add has been a friend of mine for decades, also. [The biographical information of Justice Crawford appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Leahy. I would note to the--and I am not trying to get rid of anybody from here, but please feel free with young children, if you need to take a break, you can go right straight through that door, and there is a table there. But I was delighted to meet all of them before. That was not a hint. [Laughter.] Chairman Leahy. My wife and I just had a chance to spend a week with two of our five grandchildren, and I enjoyed every single second of it, even though at times the decibel level was such that the satellites went out of orbit. [Laughter.] Chairman Leahy. Judge Firestone, did you---- STATEMENT OF HON. NANCY B. FIRESTONE, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS Judge Firestone. Thank you. I want to thank the Committee and the President for this honor, and I would like to just quickly introduce the staff that makes my work possible as a judge: my judicial assistant, Diana Perez-Kidwell; Richard Hagerman and Steven Reilly, who are my two law clerks. It is my pleasure to have them here with me today. [The biographical information of Judge Firestone appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Leahy. Thank you. Ms. Griggsby, did you wish to say something and introduce family members? STATEMENT OF LYDIA KAY GRIGGSBY, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS Ms. Griggsby. I would. Thank you very much, Chairman Leahy, and thank you for your very gracious and kind introduction. Thank you, Ranking Member Grassley, as well for your kind introduction and words. I am very honored and blessed to have my father with me today, Professor William L. Griggsby, from Pikesville, Maryland, seated behind me. My mother, the late Mary Kate Rainier Griggsby, passed away in 2011. She is with us in spirit today, and I want to honor her as well. I am also joined by many mentors and friends and colleagues. I would like to acknowledge Dr. Wyneva Johnson-- please stand--seated behind me, a long-time mentor and attorney with the Department of Justice. I also have several friends farther back in the audience, Delta Sigma Theta sorority sisters, club sisters, and many other mentors. I thank them all for their love and support. And many other family members who are watching via the Webcast today across the country. [The biographical information of Ms. Griggsby appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Leahy. I remember the sadness of everybody when your mother passed. I remember that time. And I have a feeling she is watching. Mr. Halkowski. STATEMENT OF THOMAS L. HALKOWSKI, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS Mr. Halkowski. Thank you, and thank you to the President for this truly humbling honor of being nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. And thank you, Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley, for convening this hearing and the opportunity to be heard. I have here just a few folks: my oldest son, Mick, who is just recently graduated, he is headed down to Texas to work as a chemical engineer at Dow. And my mother and father, Eleanor and Phil Halkowski, traveled here from my home town in St. Francis, Wisconsin. I could go on about their sacrifice and hard work, but I will simply say that I am indebted to them for everything. Also here are my mother- and father-in-law, Michael and Kathy Philps, who traveled here from California to lend their support, as well as my brother- and sister-in-law, D'Arcy and Cecilia Philps, along with their children, Miranda and Spencer. Unfortunately, my wife, Dana, could not be here, which is ironic because without her love and support I myself would not be here. But she is attending the high school graduation of our youngest son, Benjamin, back in Unionville, Pennsylvania, which is going on at this very moment. I am assured, though, from my son, Ben, that I am not missing anything. He is going to be doing the exact same thing in 4 years at the University of Pittsburgh. And thanks to this hearing, that promise is now on the record. [Laughter.] Chairman Leahy. And we will make sure he gets a copy of this record. Mr. Halkowski. My daughter, Scout, also, unfortunately, cannot be here due to commitments back at her college in Pennsylvania. I have many relatives, two brothers, three sisters, back in Wisconsin, as well as many others whose support I appreciate. One person I do need to mention, my Grandma Nuffky back in Wisconsin. She will be 99 years old on June 14th. She assures everyone, however, to hold off on the celebration until next year, because she wants to do her 100th birthday big time. [Laughter.] Mr. Halkowski. Finally, there are just two people I need to acknowledge who are no longer with us today: Judge Roger Andewelt as well as Chief Helen Nies. Judge Andewelt served on the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, gave me my first job out of law school, and was the best mentor I could have ever hoped for. And Judge Nies similarly provided--generously provided her time and wisdom. And I miss them both, but I carry with me the lessons that they taught me over the years. And with that, I thank you again for convening this hearing, and I look forward to the opportunity to address your questions. [The biographical information of Mr. Halkowski appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman Leahy. Well, thank you. Justice Crawford, I had occasion to talk with the President shortly after I had met with you, and I told him of your appreciation for his nomination. And I told him that this was one nomination he will not have to worry about. You served as a Vermont State court trial judge for 11 years, and you have been on the Supreme Court now since last year. What lessons do you take from a State court as you transfer over to the Federal court? Justice Crawford. I think the principal lesson is twofold: one is the real need to stay close to the facts in every case, to really try and understand what is going on; but even more important, in dealing with the litigants, to try and keep it fresh, to try and bring something new to each case, not to become routine or jaded, to try and really engage with each case anew. And the State trial court judges do a fine job, I think, in both those regards. Chairman Leahy. I enjoyed my years as a trial lawyer and as a prosecutor. But I left that time with an abiding feeling that courts' judges should think not just of the people who are in there all the time--the prosecutors are, a well-known litigant like Mr. O'Neill is, others--but the people who are there, this is their one and only time they may be before the court. Can you give us assurance that everybody who comes in your court, no matter what their political party or their economic status or whether they are plaintiff or defendant, government or defendant, that they will be treated the same? Justice Crawford. Senator, I can make that commitment. That has been my effort over the course of the last 12 years, and I intend to continue as I started out. For many people we are in the courts the face of government that they deal with very directly, and it is crucial that they feel that they have been heard and that they have been treated fairly and listened to with care. Chairman Leahy. One of my predecessors as Chairman of this Committee was Senator Strom Thurmond. We had different philosophies on a number of things, but one thing I always agreed with. He always said to somebody coming on to the Federal bench that, you know, it is a lifetime appointment, you can do anything you want, but do not forget you are there for everybody in that courtroom. I am not even going to ask you that question because I have watched enough about you to know that is the way you will be. And the last question, which is sort of the standard one, the Second Circuit opinions are binding on the district court, as are the Supreme Court's. Do you have any difficulty in applying stare decisis even though you might wonder in a particular case, ``What the heck were they thinking?'' Justice Crawford. Not at all, Senator. I work within and I have worked within a system of authority where I look to and respect the judgments of the courts above us. Chairman Leahy. Well, thank you. Judge Firestone, you have presided over, I am told by Ms. Lucius, more than 700 cases. You must have had--in some ways it must be routine, but it certainly was not when you first came there. What are some of the difficulties you had to overcome? Judge Firestone. Well, I would say that the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims is quite broad. It ranges from tax to contracts to Indian claims and so forth. One of the big advantages that Court has is we have the Justice Department representing the United States in every case, and as an alum of that organization, they do an excellent job in not only advocating but I would say educating the Court. And we have had excellent practitioners on the other side. And so when you are new as a judge, you spend a lot of time educating yourself as to what is the law, and you spend a lot of time ensuring that you understand the arguments of the parties. But, interestingly enough, it is a very high quality of representation that appears on the Court, and with hard work you get to learn different things. But every case actually comes to you, I would say, pretty new. Although issues generally repeat, for the most part the reason they are in front of us is because they could not resolve it on their own and there is some twist. And so that is actually what keeps the job fresh and challenging, as it has been for the last 15 years and, if confirmed, hopefully for the next. Chairman Leahy. So you find it still interesting when you come into the courtroom. Judge Firestone. I wake up every morning challenged and enjoying the job. I would say it has been the greatest privilege of my life to serve on that court. Chairman Leahy. I know the feeling in the job I have. Judge Firestone. I share it in a different way, but, yes, I love the work. Chairman Leahy. And, Ms. Griggsby, we know you so well from your past decade in the Senate, both the Ethics and the Judiciary Committees, and a trial attorney at the Department of Justice and U.S. Attorney's Office in DC and private litigation. Sort of somewhat along with what I was saying to Justice Crawford, how do you feel about how people should be treated when they come in the courtroom? You are used to walking into this room, for example. You used to walk into courtrooms. But a lot of people coming in there, it is their first time, maybe their only time. How do you feel about that? Ms. Griggsby. Thank you, Chairman Leahy, for that question. During my decade as a Justice Department attorney and my decade here in the Senate, I have always felt that you should treat people fairly, with impartiality, and with courtesy. That has always been my practice as an attorney. It was my practice as an attorney appearing before the court, and that is the practice I would have as a judge. Every citizen should feel welcome and that they are going to be treated fairly and receive justice under the law. Chairman Leahy. And one of the questions I had for you, Mr. Halkowski, you already answered when you spoke about your mentors as judges. But even having worked for judges, clerks and whatnot, you have now been in private litigation, and all of a sudden you are not rising when the judge comes into the courtroom. Everybody is going to be rising when you come in the courtroom. That can be a heady feeling. But how do you handle that transition and do it in such a way that you saw it being a litigant and now you would be an impartial trier of facts? Mr. Halkowski. Simply, if I am so fortunate to be confirmed, keep in mind one word really, and that is, ``respect''--respect for the limited role of the courts amongst the branches of Government, and respect for the law and applying stare decisis, and so you just simply apply the law to the facts of each case. And, finally, as Ms. Griggsby alluded to, respect for each of the parties that come before you and keep an open mind and listen to them and do your best to provide justice. Chairman Leahy. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. Yes, I am going to start out with Justice Crawford and go across the table. I am going to ask you about some issues dealing with sentencing, because you have spoken on that. And at this point I do not find any fault, but I want to give you an opportunity to expand. In 2013, you spoke to the press about sentencing practices in your State. At that time you expressed the opinion that judges have been, as you put it, ``oversentencing'' criminal defendants. You also mentioned that many of those defendants should be placed into drug or mental health courts and that judges and prosecutors should focus on treatment and reconciliation instead of incarceration. So these would be-- expand on those statements by saying what--by my asking what do you mean when you stated that Vermont's criminal defendants have been oversentenced. And I have one more question. Justice Crawford. Of course, sir. Thank you. It is an important issue. Within the State court system, we see two kinds of criminal defendants, particularly in the area of drug addiction, drug abuse, and drug trafficking. We see the people that make it their living to harm our communities by selling drugs, and for those people I do not see an important change. I think the sentencing practices have been correct. For people who are addicted and are more customers than traffickers, we have had success in Vermont. I have worked for several years in the drug court, and we have seen real change in people's behaviors, in their ability to support their families, in their ability to return to the rest of us as honest citizens. And it is that group that I think can be directed toward treatment, directed toward drug court-type programs, which are no walk in the park--they are strict, and if you fail in your treatment, you spend the weekend in jail. It is almost a sterner model than simply putting people on probation or jailing them for short periods of time. So what has interested me is a commitment from the courts for people who are addicted to redirecting them so that we can get them back in our midst as productive people. Senator Grassley. What are your thoughts on mandatory minimums? And can you tell us a little bit about your experiences with limitations on sentencing discretion within the Vermont judicial system? Justice Crawford. Within the State system, we have only a handful of mandatory minimums. They represent the decision, the serious decision of the legislature to treat certain offenses with particular seriousness and care. And I have always respected that decision and imposed the mandatory minimum because the legislature is in charge of that decision, and I would expect to continue to do so in the event that I am confirmed here. Senator Grassley. Then that would bring me to the Supreme Court's Booker decision on Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Of course, they are no longer mandatory, so let me ask you a couple questions, and then a third one, but two at first. What is your view on the guidelines? And do you believe that the guidelines have resulted in oversentencing of criminal defendants? Justice Crawford. I cannot tell you in a numbers kind of a way what the result of the guidelines has been within the Federal system. What I can tell you is that what I like about them is it brings out into the open the concerns about sentencing, about deterrence, about rehabilitation, about punishment, which are involved in every sentencing decision. On the State court side, those things are not always discussed in an open way in court. Sentencing guidelines compel the judge and the defendant, his attorney, and the Government to talk about them in an open way and to apply them in a way which is more uniform from case to case. So I think those are important positive aspects of the Sentencing Guidelines. Senator Grassley. In the cases of nonviolent drug offenders or drug offenders with little or no criminal history, do you believe that downward departures would be warranted under the guidelines? Or do you think that such individuals would be better off in a drug court setting? Justice Crawford. What I can tell you, Senator, is that I have seen success for people that meet in the State system-- that people that meet those criteria in a drug court setting, where they are involved for 6 or 12 months, meeting weekly, speaking as you and I are, with the judge, reporting on their progress. Whether that translates easily into the Federal system it would be difficult for me to say. I have seen it work person to person in the State court system. Senator Grassley. Okay. Then my last series of questions for you. You mentioned the importance of treatment and reconciliation during your comments to the press in 2013. Would you tell us what you meant by that statement? And then let me quickly add to that. If confirmed, would you focus on treatment and reconciliation when sentencing criminal defendants in the Federal system? And if so, how would that focus affect sentencing in your courtroom? Justice Crawford. What I have tried to do, Senator, in my sentencing practices is to look at each person as best I can as an individual and to make an individual judgment about whether incarceration is required, whether a mandated treatment program is going to be sufficient, whether a mixture of those two is appropriate. And it would be my intention to continue to-- within the framework of the Sentencing Guidelines, to continue to try and make that judgment, separate out the business people who are harming our communities from the people who have fallen into drug addiction and treat those two as different types of problems. Senator Grassley. Now, the rest of you are going to feel like you are not very important if I do not ask you as many questions. [Laughter.] Senator Grassley. But I am not going to, so do not take it personally. For you, Lydia, the Court of Federal Claims adjudicates cases across a broad range of subject matters. Since 2006 you have served the Committee by providing advice relating to the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Could you please share how this experience might help prepare you for the Federal Claims Court if confirmed? Ms. Griggsby. Yes, thank you, Senator, for that question. During my time on the Committee, I have worked on a number of complex legal issues, including, as you mentioned, ECPA reform and FOIA reform. In the context of that work, I have had to work very closely with co-counsel and opposing counsel, various offices on the Committee, as well as stakeholders with a variety of different perspectives and competing interests. I think I have always done that in a very fair and open-minded way, and I think that those skills have equipped me well to be a fair and open-minded judge, if confirmed to the Court of Federal Claims. Senator Grassley. Okay. And, Ms. Firestone, you have now served at least one term. Aside from the knowledge of how the Court works, what have you learned during your first term that would assist you in a second term, if confirmed? And that does not mean things have to be any different, but I just wondered if they would be. And let me follow that up with how, if at all, would you change your approach in cases from what you have learned during your first time. Judge Firestone. Well, Senator, I hope after 15 years I have become a bit more efficient, and so I will say that there is--I do not intend to change the way I judge cases in any way. The oath is the same, and I will abide by that and look at each case individually and decide each one on its merits based on the facts and the law. What it has allowed me to do after 15 years is to become more of an educator with regard to the Court, and so I have the opportunity now to do things with regard to the Judicial Conferences of our Court, with regard to our Advisory Committee, that allows me to take some of the experience that I have had and share that with new judges, and to work with judges and members of the bar to improve the administration of justice, which I think helps, having had enough experience that I can judge whether or not I think those recommendations will be valid. And I hope to continue to do that work as well in the next 15 years. Senator Grassley. Okay. In your view, Ms. Firestone, are there particular challenges facing the Court of Claims? Do you see any areas where improvement is needed? And this could be from two standpoints. One, is there any suggestions you have for Congress to make any changes? Or, number two, any changes that you would see that the Court itself could make? Judge Firestone. Well, Senator Grassley, I appreciate the question. I think that the Court is always looking to find ways to improve its administration internally, and I do not have any--we are constantly, by virtue of now the whole new change in electronic filings and things like that, the efficiency of the court system has actually improved markedly. I would say that with regard to things for Congress I leave that to people different than myself to make those suggestions, and, indeed, that is why we have advisory committees and so forth who involve outside attorneys as well as Justice Department attorneys to make those types of suggestions to the Congress. Senator Grassley. My first question is--I am from Iowa, and you evidently have Midwest roots. Where is St. Francis, Wisconsin? [Laughter.] Mr. Halkowski. Thank you, Senator. Senator Grassley. And how big is it? Mr. Halkowski. Thank you, Senator, and I can handle that question. It is just south of Milwaukee. It is actually a suburb of Milwaukee. It is right along Lake Michigan, and its population--well, now it is a little bit smaller, but probably around 10,000. Chairman Leahy. You did a heck of a lot better on that answer than I ever could. [Laughter.] Senator Grassley. Well, I was about ready to tell you, even though I am close to Wisconsin, about all I think about is Madison and Milwaukee. Mr. Halkowski. There you go. Senator Grassley. And do not tell the Green Bay Packers. Mr. Halkowski. We all suffer with having to root for Green Bay. Senator Grassley. Now, to be a little more serious, the Federal Claims Court adjudicates cases across a broad range of subject matters. What experience do you have in tax refund suits, takings cases, Government contract cases, contract claims, or other claims that come before the Court? And if you do not have any experience, I am not asking that in a negative way. I just want to know how you feel you are prepared for it. Mr. Halkowski. Sure. Thank you again, Senator. I was fortunate to clerk at the Court starting out my legal career, so I actually had a bit of experience in a broad range of cases, including tax cases and Government contracts. I then went to the court of appeals and had, again, some experience with cases that are appealed from the Court of Federal Claims to the Federal Circuit. Next, I went to the Justice Department where I actually litigated many, many cases in front of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, including takings cases and some breach of trust cases involving Native American claims. So I have a broad array of experience, and then most recently I have been in private practice and focused on intellectual property and patent claims, which, again, is a type of claim that is brought before the Court. There are, of course, some areas that I have less experience in, and those I would just simply dig in and work a bit harder on. Senator Grassley. During your time at Justice, you defended the Federal Government in cases where plaintiffs sought compensation under the Fifth Amendment for alleged uncompensated taking. How would you transition from defender of the Federal Government to a neutral arbitrator? Mr. Halkowski. Again, thank you, Senator. My focus as a judge, should I be fortunate enough to be confirmed, would be strict fidelity to the law and, again, respecting the parties that come before me and listening with an open mind and then applying the law as it is set forth by the Supreme Court as well as the Federal Circuit, and rendering a decision based on that and taking into account no other factor. Senator Grassley. You do not have any problem with that transition? Mr. Halkowski. I do not, Your Honor. I will say also that-- and maybe I was unusual. I do not know. But when I worked at the Justice Department, I always saw my role as not to win the case but to come up with an outcome that would render justice, because I felt as someone who was not only representing the Government but also representing the citizens, that would be appropriate. Senator Grassley. Last, congratulations to all of you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leahy. Thank you. And one of the questions you asked Justice Crawford made me think, and I am now being parochial as a Vermonter. You talked about our drug courts and basically diversion programs and so on. Has it not been our experience in Vermont that doing that rather than doing a one- size-fits-all in the court system has actually saved Vermont taxpayers a huge amount of money and it has kept a more productive society? Is that correct? Justice Crawford. I think that has been the case, Senator. Chairman Leahy. And looking at the budgets--oh, Senator Grassley. I am going to keep the hearing--no, no. I am going to keep the hearing record--I just wanted you to know I will keep the hearing record open until Friday. And now that you have all had this enormously tough grilling, we will stand in adjournment. Thank you very much. Justice Crawford. Thank you. Judge Firestone. Thank you. Ms. Griggsby. Thank you. Mr. Halkowski. Thank you. [Whereupon, at 10:40 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.] [Additional material submitted for the record follows.] A P P E N D I X Additional Material Submitted for the Record [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] NOMINATIONS OF PAMELA HARRIS, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT; HON. PAMELA PEPPER, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN; BRENDA K. SANNES, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK; PATRICIA M. McCARTHY, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS; AND HON. JERI KAYLENE SOMERS, NOMINEE TO BE JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ---------- TUESDAY, JUNE 24, 2014 United States Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:18 a.m., in Room SD-226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Chuck Schumer, presiding. Present: Senators Schumer, Coons, Blumenthal, Grassley, and Cruz. Senator Schumer. The hearing will come to order, and to help our colleagues get on with their busy schedules, Senator Grassley will put his opening statement in the record. [The prepared statement of Ranking Member Grassley appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Schumer. We will proceed immediately to Senator Mikulski of Maryland. PRESENTATION OF PAMELA HARRIS, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT, BY HON. BARBARA A. MIKULSKI, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND Senator Mikulski. Good morning, Senator Schumer, Senator Grassley. Senator Cardin and I want to thank Senators Leahy and Grassley for scheduling this hearing and Senator Schumer for graciously agreeing to preside. Today Senator Cardin and I are delighted and honored to bring to your attention a nominee for the Fourth Circuit, Pamela Harris. You are really going to like Pamela Harris as you get to know her, and I hope we will get to vote for her. Senator Cardin and I recommended her to President Obama with the utmost confidence because of her ability, her talent, and her competence. The ABA agrees with us. They gave her the highest rating and said she was unanimously well qualified. Today, as we bring her to your attention, know that we take our advise-and-consent responsibility very seriously. I have four criteria: absolute integrity, judicial competence and temperament, a commitment to core principles of the Constitution, and a history of civic engagement in Maryland. Pamela Harris is the embodiment of these principles. She has dedicated her practice and her career to furthering the practice of appellate lawyer activity and enhancing the role that law plays in the public interest. She is an outstanding nominee and will be absolutely an asset to the Fourth Circuit. Ms. Harris' career spans academia, private practice, and Government with a common thread of public service and public commitment. We are proud to say that Ms. Harris is a homegrown girl. Although born in Connecticut, she has called Maryland her home since she was a child, graduating from our public schools and then she went on to Yale. We forgive her for that, but we welcomed her back when she came. At Yale, she received both her bachelor's and law degrees. She then went on to complete a clerkship for the D.C. Circuit Court, and she was also a clerk for Justice Stevens on the Supreme Court. Serving at the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, she then spent 10 years appearing on a regular basis before the Supreme Court. This is a woman who has extensive appellate experience while counsel and then partner to O'Melveny and Myers, taking on very complex issues. She has a distinguished career in academia, being a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, at the Harvard Appellate Practice Clinic, and later at Georgetown. She served as the executive director of the Supreme Court Institute. But at the same time, she found her way back to Maryland and stayed very close to people. Whether it was a pro bono appellate clinic at O'Melveny, to work with Maryland's public defender on an amicus curiae brief involving Montgomery County Schools, or other activity, she has worked to enhance law, to give her services pro bono, and to work with people. I believe her temperament is such that you are going to find her a keen mind and yet a humble personality, unusual among many lawyers at that level, but she then is an unusual nominee. She comes with a great personal narrative that I know she will share with you, an incredible resume, but a real commitment to our Constitution and our core principles. I think she would be a great asset in the Fourth Circuit. So I hope that the Committee reports her favorably to the full Senate and we act on this expeditiously before we adjourn in November--in October. Senator Schumer. Thank you, Senator Mikulski. I got scared when you said November. [Laughter.] Senator Schumer. Senator Cardin. PRESENTATION OF PAMELA HARRIS, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT, BY HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND Senator Cardin. Chairman Schumer, Senator Grassley, thank you very much for the courtesy of allowing us to introduce Pam Harris. I am very proud to be a partner with Senator Mikulski in a process on judicial nominations in which we have an interview process where we try to get the very best to serve on our courts. And as a result of Senator Mikulski's leadership, I am very proud of the nominees that have been brought forward to this Committee by President Obama with the strong support of Senator Mikulski and myself. Pam Harris is an exceptional candidate. I have interviewed several candidates for judgeships. I do not think I have ever seen a person more suited and more qualified to sit on our appellate court than Pam Harris. She has devoted her entire career basically to appellate law and to understanding our judicial system. She is well qualified. She has worked in the executive branch. She has worked in Justice. She has worked for our courts as a clerk, as Senator Mikulski has pointed out. She is exceptionally well qualified with tremendous legal experience in Government, the private sector, and academia. She is an excellent Supreme Court litigator and in my view one of the best in the country for this type of practice. Ms. Harris has an appreciation for the rights and responsibilities of each branch of Government, having clerked at the Federal appellate courts, supervised policy initiatives at the Department of Justice. She has dedicated her career and professional life to improving the administration of justice as a public servant. She has demonstrated a commitment to protect civil rights and individual liberties through her pro bono work. Her roots are in Montgomery County, Maryland. She is an active member of her community, giving back to her local schools and volunteering in the community. Let me just tell you a little bit of background about her family because I think it is telling, because this truly is the American dream. Her grandmother was a Polish Jewish immigrant to the United States who valued education and worked hard to overcome personal adversity. Her mom put herself through law school with young children after a divorce and died from cancer a few years later. Ms. Harris herself relied in part on a Pell grant to attend college at Yale, and I understand that all of Ms. Harris' siblings are now lawyers. So it is safe to say that her family story and history is truly the American dream and the American experience, and the public service and seeking to uphold the rule of law runs in the blood of her family. You have heard Senator Mikulski talk about her extraordinary background, the law firms that she has worked for, her public career. Ms. Harris co-directed Harvard Law School's Supreme Court and Appellate Practice Clinic and was a visiting professor at Georgetown University Law School. In 2009, Ms. Harris was named the executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown, serving as executive director until 2010. Ms. Harris then joined the Justice Department Office of Legal Policy where she served as the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General until returning to Georgetown in 2012. She is currently a visiting professor at Georgetown University Law Center and a senior adviser to the Supreme Court Institute. As Senator Mikulski pointed out, it is not surprising that she has been given the highest qualifications by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Let me just mention one or two other points, if I might. First, there is a letter--and I will ask these letters be made part of the record. Senator Schumer. Without objection. [The letters appear as submissions for the record.] Senator Cardin. They are from a long list of distinguished lawyers who have served in Republican and Democratic administrations who praise Pam Harris' qualifications and urge the Committee to quickly confirm--recommend confirmation of her appointment. She has taken hundreds of cases before the Federal Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, and her practice has been pretty evenly divided between civil and criminal matters, so she understands both of them exceedingly well. She has experience also at the State court level, so she has the whole package. She has the experience, criminal, civil, private, public; she has an incredible career for pro bono work. So I personally want to thank her, and I want to thank her family for being willing to serve in this capacity. We know it is going to be a challenge as far as the demands that will be on her time, and we strongly recommend her confirmation. Senator Schumer. Thank you, Senator Cardin. And that completes the introductions for Pamela Harris. We have five members of the bench--and I understand you both have busy schedules, so feel free to go on to your business if you would prefer that. Senator Mikulski. Mr. Chairman, we ask unanimous consent that two letters of support--one from the list of bipartisan legal professionals supporting Ms. Harris--be entered into the record, and then a letter from the National Women's Law Center on her---- Senator Schumer. Without objection. [The letters appear as submissions for the record.] Senator Schumer. Okay. Good. Now we have five district court nominees to speak about. They are Brenda Sannes, of the Northern District of New York; Pamela Pepper, of the Eastern District of Wisconsin; Patricia McCarthy, of the Federal Court of Claims; and Jeri Somers, of the Federal Court of Claims. We will let our two guests--I want to say a few words about Ms. Sannes from the Northern District, but I will do that after our two guests say their words about Pamela Pepper. And I know that Senator Coons, who has graciously agreed to take over for me chairing this hearing, has some words to say about Patricia McCarthy and Jeri Somers. So if that is okay with everyone, we will go Johnson, Baldwin, Schumer, Coons. Senator Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin. PRESENTATION OF HON. PAMELA PEPPER, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN, BY HON. RON JOHNSON, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN Senator Johnson. Thank you, Chairman Schumer, Ranking Member Grassley, Members of the Committee. I am here to recommend to the Committee another Pam, the Honorable Pamela Pepper, to be the United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Pam has served with distinction as the current chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Although not native to our State, she has set down deep roots in Wisconsin, first serving in the office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, followed by private practice in Milwaukee, and finally serving 9 years as a bankruptcy court judge. Pam was born in the Delta of Mississippi in a town called Leland. Her parents were both teachers and instilled in her an intellectual curiosity which has been apparent throughout her career. She migrated north for college and attended Northwestern University in Chicago, where she received a degree in theater. After helping a friend get through the LSAT review course, she realized she might want to explore other careers and ended up taking the LSAT herself. She obviously had prepared herself well because she performed well on the LSAT and was accepted into Cornell University School of Law. Senator Schumer. An excellent school, I might add. [Laughter.] Senator Johnson. Apparently. After graduation, she clerked with distinction for Judge Frank Johnson on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and then moved on to become a prosecutor in the United States Attorney's Office in Chicago. Pam is widely respected within the profession, evidenced by having held offices as the president of the Milwaukee Bar Association and the chairperson of the Board of Governors of the State Bar of Wisconsin. She is an instructor of national stature and speaks frequently on trial practice and evidence. She is currently an instructor at the Federal Judicial Center. I have had the opportunity to speak to practitioners that have appeared before her bankruptcy court. They have told me of her patience with attorneys, which is a virtue of hers they all value. Pam possesses a great sense of humor, which she often uses to put litigants at ease. She displays compassion in making tough decisions by explaining the rationale for those decisions clearly so her reasoning is understood by all. She has shown great dexterity in reacting to difficult situations in court with calm reasoning. Finally, Pam has been described as a practical judge who promptly resolves disputes while faithfully adhering to the rule of law. Pam's intellectual curiosity, her demonstrated ability to learn new areas of the law, and efficiently administer her office has convinced me she would continue to excel in a new role as a Federal district court judge. Judge Pepper has my full support, and I am happy to recommend her to the Senate for swift confirmation. I would like to conclude my remarks by thanking the hard- working members of our bipartisan nomination commission for their dedication and efforts. I would also like to thank Senator Baldwin for her continued support of this successful nominating process that has once again resulted in the selection of a well-qualified jurist, Judge Pamela Pepper, who will serve the Nation and the people of Wisconsin's Eastern District well. Thank you. Senator Schumer. Thank you, and I thank both you and Senator Baldwin for your bipartisan efforts in this area. Senator Baldwin. PRESENTATION OF HON. PAMELA PEPPER, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN, BY HON. TAMMY BALDWIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Chairman Schumer, Ranking Member Grassley, Senator Coons, and all other Members of the Committee who may be here today. It gives me great pleasure to appear before you this morning to introduce Judge Pamela Pepper, the President's nominee for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. And I am proud to speak before you for the second time this year in support of a highly qualified individual nominated to fill a judicial vacancy in my home State of Wisconsin. Ensuring that the people of Wisconsin are supported by dedicated public servants in our judicial system has been a top priority of mine since I joined the Senate last year, and I am proud of the work that my colleague Senator Johnson and I have done together to advance this important goal. Judge Pamela Pepper has had a distinguished career as a judge, a Federal prosecutor, public defender, and an attorney in private practice, and I applaud the President for nominating her. She will continue her outstanding service on the bench, and the people of Wisconsin will benefit from having this experienced and dedicated public servant as a U.S. district judge. Pamela Pepper has served as the chief bankruptcy judge for the Eastern District of Wisconsin since 2010 and has served as bankruptcy judge on that court since 2005. Judge Pepper has also contributed significantly to the field of bankruptcy as a leader in the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges and the American Bankruptcy Institute, and as associate editor for the American Bankruptcy Law Journal. Before assuming her position as a bankruptcy judge, Pamela Pepper spent 8 years as a solo practitioner engaged in criminal defense work, including through appointments by the Wisconsin State Public Defender Service and the Federal Defender Service of Wisconsin. Judge Pepper began her legal career in public service working for 7 years as a Federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Offices in Chicago and then in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Prior to assuming her role on the bankruptcy court, Judge Pepper also held numerous leadership positions in the legal community, including with the Board of Directors of the Federal Defender Service of Wisconsin, the State Bar of Wisconsin, and the Eastern District of Wisconsin Bar Association, and the Milwaukee Bar Association. As you heard, Judge Pepper received her J.D. from Cornell, where she was an editor in the Cornell Law Review and a winner of the Sutherland Moot Court competition. From 1989 to 1990, she was a law clerk to the Honorable Frank J. Johnson, Jr., of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Judge Pepper lives in Shorewood, Wisconsin, with her son, Leland, who I am delighted joins us here today. Senator Johnson and I strongly support Judge Pepper's nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, and I urge this Committee and the entire Senate to confirm her expeditiously. Senator Schumer. Thank you, Senator Baldwin, and I thank you and Senator Johnson for being here. I know you two have busy schedules, so we understand if you cannot stay to listen to the rest of the proceedings. Now I am going to read my remarks about Brenda K. Sannes of the Northern District, and then I will turn the gavel over to Senator Coons, who has graciously agreed to continue chairing this panel, and I believe he has remarks for Patricia McCarthy and Jeri Somers. Then we will, at Senator Grassley's request, first do the circuit court judge nominee, Pamela Harris, and then do the four district court nominees--Ms. Sannes, Ms. Pepper, Ms. McCarthy, and Ms. Somers. Four women, excellent. Okay, five women altogether. Yes, that is very good. PRESENTATION OF BRENDA K. SANNES, NOMINEE TO BE DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, BY HON. CHUCK SCHUMER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK Senator Schumer. Good morning, and I want to thank Ranking Member Grassley for being here, and I want to thank Senator Coons, who I said a moment ago has graciously agreed to chair the hearing--he has many good qualities, and graciousness is indeed one of them--and for all our witnesses. Now, I could not be more pleased to come before the Committee today to introduce my 20th nominee to the Federal district court bench in New York, Brenda K. Sannes. Ms. Sannes is the very model of a Federal judge in both qualification and temperament. Ms. Sannes passes my three-part test for becoming a Federal judge within an A-plus, a grade that she appears to have received at every juncture in her career. Indeed, my first criteria is excellence, to be legally excellent, not a political hack or anything like that. Ms. Sannes earned her B.A. magna cum laude from Carleton College and her law degree, also magna cum laude--it is too bad our two witnesses are gone--from the University of Wisconsin Law School, where she was articles editor of the Law Review. After graduating, Ms. Sannes clerked for the renowned Judge Jerome Farris of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. She settled first in Los Angeles, where she worked as a litigation associate with the law firm of Wyman, Bautzer, Christensen, Kuchel and Silvert, and then moved to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California. But, fortunately for central New York and for upstate New York, Ms. Sannes next moved to Syracuse where, since 1988, she has dedicated her talents to our Nation's service as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York. Most recently, her work as head of the appellate division there has earned her the respect and accolades of judges all over the Second Circuit. Along the way, Ms. Sannes has received awards that are literally too numerous to mention here. By way of example, she has been lauded by the FBI, the L.A. Police Department, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. Ms. Sannes' experience in public service has helped her to meet my second important qualification for becoming a judge: moderation. I do not like ideologues on the bench, far left or far right, because they tend to--they often impose their views rather than interpret the law. Talk to anyone who has practiced law with her or judges before whom she has appeared or even counsel who have been on opposing sides of cases from her. They will tell you she is unerringly fair, listens intently, makes reasonable decisions, and presents only the most solid argument in her cases. And not only has she dedicated herself and her entire career to public service, she has found time to mentor young lawyers and teach and lecture aspiring lawyers on a host of criminal justice issues. Finally, all other things being equal, I look for diversity in candidates on the bench. I think it is important that the communities served by our Federal judges see judges who are like them and whose values and experiences are likely to reflect their own. Ms. Sannes will be only the second female judge in the history of the Northern District of New York, one whose arrival will be welcome not just by women, of course, but by everyone who values the quality and fairness of the Federal judiciary. I was proud to nominate the first woman nominee to the bench in the Northern District, and now I am equally proud to nominate the second. In fact, Ms. Sannes' entire family reflects the great community that they come from. Here today with her is her husband, Steve Clymer, and he has earned very high marks for his service in the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of New York. She is also accompanied by her sons Matthew, 19, a physics major at Cornell--as I mentioned, a great institution--Samuel, who is 16; and Benjamin, who is 10. I am told that Ben will be missing his second to last day of school, which is Movie Day, to be here with his mother. I hope they are showing a good legal movie, you know, like ``The Last Angry Man,'' or I do not know, some legal movies or other. Anyway, I am not going to pretend that this is going to be better than a movie, but I do think that, Ben, you will remember it a lot longer. I know you are all very proud of your wife and your mother, and I am pleased to have you all here today. With that, I am going to call on the gracious Senator Coons to chair the hearing and to make two introductions. Senator Coons [presiding]. Thank you very much, Senator Schumer, Senator Grassley. Let me, if I might, just conclude the introductions for our panel today. It is to me impressive that we have five such exceptional nominees with a wealth of experience, and I applaud my colleagues for making progress in continuing to fill the vacancies in our Federal judiciary. We do have 61 current vacancies, and although we have made progress in the past few months, we still have much work to do. Seven percent of the Federal bench remains vacant, and this is an important step toward filling those vacancies. Today's nomination hearing is also a key step toward making our Federal judiciary more diverse. This is the first all- female judicial nomination hearing in over a decade and the first such hearing ever with five female nominees. Let me, if I might, continue to introduce the remaining two nominees for today. Patricia McCarthy, a nominee to the United States Court of Federal Claims, and since 1994, Patricia has served in the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice, where she currently serves as Assistant Director. Prior to Government service, Ms. McCarthy worked as an associate at Bingham, Dana and Gould in Boston from 1989 to 1994. Born in Medford, Massachusetts, she received her B.A. cum laude from Colby College and her J.D. from Cornell Law School, about which we have already heard a great deal. [Laughter.] Senator Coons. Our last nominee today is Jeri Kaylene Somers, who is nominated to the United States Court of Federal Claims. Since 2008, Judge Somers has been Vice Chair of the United States Civilian Board of Contract Appeals where she formerly served as a board judge. She is also currently a lecturer in law at George Washington University Law School. For the first 21 years of her legal career, she also served as a judge advocate and a military judge in the United States Air Force. Born in Wichita, Kansas, Judge Somers earned her B.A. from George Mason University and earned her J.D. from the American University Washington College of Law. Now, by prior agreement, we will move now to nominee Pamela Harris for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Ms. Harris, if you will come forward and, following the tradition of this Committee, be sworn. Please stand and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give to the Committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Ms. Harris. I do. Senator Coons. Thank you. Let the record show the nominee has answered in the affirmative. Please be seated. I would now like to invite you, Ms. Harris, to give an opening statement and feel free to recognize loved ones and supporters who may be with you today as well. STATEMENT OF PAMELA HARRIS, NOMINEE TO BE CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT Ms. Harris. Thank you, Senator Coons, and thank you for chairing this hearing. I would like to thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley and the entire Committee for its consideration. It is a great honor for me to be here today, and I appreciate it. I also would like to thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Cardin for their exceptionally kind introductions and for their support. And, finally, I would like to thank my family and my friends who are here today, and if I may just briefly introduce my family. Senator Coons. Please. Ms. Harris. I have my cousin, Lauren Kline, with her husband, Andrew, and daughter, Becca. Lauren is just a few years older than me, but that is old enough to make her the matriarch of our family. So she is here also representing my entire extended family. I also have my brother, Geoffrey Harris, and my two sisters, Elizabeth Harris and Tiffany Harris. And as has been mentioned already, all three of them are lawyers as well because all of us followed in the footsteps of my mother, Ellen Harris, who went to school at night to become a lawyer and then did become a lawyer while she was raising the four of us as a single parent. Her dedication and her integrity as a lawyer were an inspiration, and I know that she would be very proud of us today. Finally, I have my husband, Austin Schlick, and my two children: Henry, who is 15, and Ellen, who is 13. My family is the joy of my life, and I am very happy that they are here today. And, with that, I am very happy to answer your questions. [The biographical information of Ms. Harris appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Coons. Thank you very much, Ms. Harris. We will begin with 5-minute rounds. First, would you just start by describing for us your judicial philosophy? Ms. Harris. Senator, I do not have an overarching judicial philosophy. I believe that the role of a judge is to decide cases through impartial application of law and precedent. It is a limited role. Judges do not make law. But it is an important role. What they do is they decide the concrete disputes in front of them with attention to particular facts, attention to the arguments of the parties and their briefs, and, again, by applying law and precedent to those facts. And that is the only philosophy I would take with me if I were confirmed. Senator Coons. You have had a distinguished career, as mentioned by the two Senators who introduced you, as an appellate litigator, as an academic professor and scholar at three of our Nation's leading law schools, and you have helped to found and lead prominent law and policy organizations. During your career you have been able to advocate for and publish your views on a very wide range of legal issues. If confirmed to the Fourth Circuit, how would your prior advocacy influence your judging? Ms. Harris. It would not, Senator. I understand these as being very, very different roles. I think that as an advocate, your position is essentially given to you. You start with a position that benefits your clients, and then from there you develop the best, reasonable legal arguments that can be made on your client's behalf. I think as a judge the role is entirely different. You start with neutral, careful, fair consideration of the law, and then you apply it to the facts in front of you without regard to how it affects any particular party. So I do think of them as very different roles. Senator Coons. And I would agree. Over the course of your private practice, you have helped to defend a wide range of issues in your advocacy, for example, compulsory arbitration agreements in the employment context. You have argued on behalf of Mobil Corporation, plaintiffs injured by Mobil-produced asbestos ought not to be able to pursue their claims through mass adjudication. These positions are quite in contrast to some of the other advocacy organizations you have been involved in. But I would wager that you are able to resolve that tension in some way going forward. Would you help us understand how you would distinguish between positions taken on behalf of clients and positions taken on behalf of policy organizations, and how you would view different sources as you move toward being a judge? Ms. Harris. Senator, with respect to my representations of clients when I was at O'Melveny and Myers, where I worked for 10 years as an appellate and Supreme Court litigator, I took positions based on what was best for my client, and that was true whether they were some of the corporate and business interests you have identified, whether they were indigent individuals, organizational pro bono clients. I took those positions without regard to any personal views I might have had on the matter. I think the through line there is that, of course, as a judge I would fairly and impartially apply precedent, again, without regard to any personal views I might have on any matter, and without regard to any advocacy positions I might have taken on behalf of clients. Senator Coons. Thank you. While in private practice, you did establish an admirable cooperative program between O'Melveny and Myers and the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, through which the firm provides pro bono appellate representation to indigent defendants in Maryland State court. What led you to do that? And what role do you think judges broadly should have in ensuring access to justice? Ms. Harris. Senator, access to justice has been an animating value of my entire career. I just think the appellate process works best and appellate judges depend on vigorous advocacy on both sides of the issue. The whole system depends on the idea that the best arguments will be put forward on both sides of the argument regardless of a client's ability to pay and regardless of any other issues. I was happy to help found that partnership with the Maryland Public Defender's Office, in part because Maryland is my home State and I was always looking for ways to contribute in Maryland, and in part because I believe so deeply in this value that people must be represented before the courts because that is how the courts work best. Senator Coons. A last question, if I might. You have spoken publicly and litigated cases that advanced the cause of diversity, in particular diversity in education. Speak a bit, if you would, about your views on the importance of diversity in the Federal bench as well and how you think that impacts the functioning of the judicial system and access to justice. Ms. Harris. I think as a general matter, if the courts broadly reflect the diversity of the litigants who come before them, that is good for the courts. I think it helps encourage public confidence in the courts. It helps a sense of legitimacy about the courts. I also think that having a broad range of judges can provide valuable role models for young students--I see this all the time with my own law students--for other young people considering professional careers. Senator Coons. Thank you very much, Ms. Harris, for your answer. Senator Grassley. Senator Grassley. I am well aware of the answers to your first two or three questions of Senator Coons, and I respect that answer. I think my line of questioning will be along the lines of some things you have said in the past and how they seem to be inconsistent with your view of judging. In a Washington Post article on same-sex marriage issues, you are quoted as saying, ``Justice Kennedy should be changing the same way the whole country is changing''--regarding same- sex marriage. First question: Why do you believe a Supreme Court Justice should change his or her views and, therefore, judicial interpretation based upon public sentiment if we have a judiciary that is supposed to do what you just said, apply precedent and fact to deciding the case? Ms. Harris. Senator, thank you for that question. I am happy to have an opportunity to clarify. That was a comment I made to a journalist. I am often asked as a Supreme Court litigator to sort of opine and speculate about issues before the Court. I would never suggest that a Justice of the Supreme Court or any judge should change his or her opinions based on public opinion. That is not the way I view the role of a judge. I am confident it is not the way Justice Kennedy views his role or any other judge views his or her role. When we talk as commentators about the individual views of Justices, we are usually talking about their written record as it has developed through their majority opinions, their separate writings. And what I was doing in that comment is likely I had been talking about Justice Kennedy's distinct record on issues involving classifications based on sexual orientation and predicting where those legal views might bring him in future cases. Senator Grassley. Okay. In the same interview, you also stated that you thought ``the tide of history is going one way,'' and that you did not think that--well that is the end of that part of the quote--and that you did not think that the Justices ``wanted to be on the wrong side of that.'' Do you believe it is appropriate for a judge to consider which ``side of history'' their judicial interpretation should be? Ms. Harris. Again, no, Senator, I do not. And I did not mean to suggest that. I think there is another sentence in the article that makes clear, the context makes clear that what I was talking about was a notion of judicial restraint that courts, the Supreme Court, might want to be especially cautious on social issues when the political branches and political institutions sort of deeply and rapidly engaged in those issues, that the courts might want to take small steps, not take big steps, and leave as much as possible to the democratic process. Senator Grassley. In 2013, you moderated a panel on the Supreme Court's upcoming term during which you said, ``The Constitution evolves. It has to keep pace with changes in the factual predicates. And, yes, our readings of constitutional provisions ought to change and evolve in light of circumstances on the ground like that.'' Before I ask a question, I would like to say that you have been very clear on your views of the Constitution. We know where you stand. But I would like to know how you intend to decide what changed particular societal circumstances you will consider, if confirmed. Let me say it this way: It is clear from your writings and speeches that you are talking about shifting public opinion rather than simply technological advances. For example, in the introduction of a book, ``It Is a Constitution We Are Expounding,'' you wrote, ``Justice Brennan explores the importance of the judge's obligation to speak for the community, the current community, in interpreting the Constitution.'' You have also discussed what you call ``constitutional legitimacy coming from social movements.'' The problem with this view is that it tends--or it leads to a judge's imposing personal views into cases. Justice Scalia expressed it this way well in dissent regarding the Eighth Amendment, writing, ``Of course, the risk of assessing evolving standards is that it is all too easy to believe that evolution has culminated in one's own views.'' Once you start considering shifting public opinion, you are essentially reducing constitutional interpretation to public poll. So assuming you will interpret the Constitution in a way that all of your writing suggests--and I know the answers to Senator Coons suggest otherwise--how do you intend to guard against imposing your own views as opposed to what you view as shifting public opinion? Ms. Harris. Senator, let me start by saying that as a Supreme Court litigator and appellate litigator, as someone who has specialized in preparing other advocates for their arguments before the Court, I always have been keenly aware of the boundaries of judicial decisionmaking. And as a litigator, every argument I ever advanced took as its starting point the methodologies that have been used by the Supreme Court and the lower courts and the methodologies that have been approved by those courts. That is how I have conducted my career. In terms of some of the other comments you have raised, I do not believe that it is the view of a judge ever to import his or her own personal values into judicial decisionmaking. In cases in which the Court has looked to things, to social conditions, things like that, what the Court--and, again, I would follow the Court's precedent on this. What they have looked to is objective indicia of such things. They have looked to State laws. They have looked at common law. They have looked at practices in the States. I am aware of no account of legitimate judicial decisionmaking that has judges either taking public opinion polls or using their own personal preferences to decide cases. Senator Grassley. My time is up. I would submit some more questions for answer in writing. Ms. Harris. Of course. Senator Grassley. I would appreciate a response, and sometimes if you raise questions with your answers to us, sometimes we followup. So do not expect--or, I mean, expect some questions. Ms. Harris. Of course, Senator. [The questions of Ranking Member Grassley appears as a submission for the record.] Senator Grassley. Thank you. Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Senator Blumenthal. Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your service in the past, and your willingness to do it in the future, and thanks to your family as well for supporting you. You have an extraordinary career, a career of distinction and dedication to public service. And with anyone who has served or written or done things over the course of public life, obviously there are things that you can say could be misinterpreted, could be interpreted in different ways. And I would like to ask you about one point in particular. In your questionnaire to the Committee, you submitted letters that you sent in support of President Bush's, George Bush's judicial nominees: Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Tenth Circuit. And in one of those letters, you stated that you are sometimes in disagreement with Judge Gorsuch on political matters, and I assume the same could be said of Judge Kavanaugh. Ms. Harris. Yes, it could. Senator Blumenthal. And given those opposing views on political issues--and some on this panel may disagree with you on some political issues--what led you to support them as nominees to the court of appeals? Ms. Harris. Senator, I supported them as nominees because I think judging has nothing to do with politics. I was very confident that both of those nominees would put to one side any political views they might have in judging the issues that came before them and that they would approach those issues with an open mind, impartially, and base their rulings on law and precedent. I do not think politics are relevant. I would do exactly the same thing if I were confirmed that I was so sure those two nominees would do. Senator Blumenthal. And that is really one of the key points here, is it not? That a nominee's past political views ought not to shape his or her service on the court and ought not determine the outcome of our decisions here, because we want to look to the qualifications and the willingness of a nominee to put those past views aside. And I believe that you would. That would certainly be your goal. Ms. Harris. Yes, Senator, that is right. As a litigator for so many years in private practice, I always had full confidence, when I came to a court, that those judges would be deciding the cases on the law, that they would approach the briefs and arguments with an open mind, fairly and impartially. It is the cornerstone of the system, and I would be honored to do the same if I were confirmed. Senator Blumenthal. And you have been a prolific writer going back to your days on the Yale Daily News. Ms. Harris. Yes. Senator Blumenthal. Some of us regret what we may have written on school newspapers in the past when it is presented to us years or decades later. But I assume that you would follow the law and attempt to conform your views to what the U.S. Supreme Court says the law is. Ms. Harris. Senator, I would conform my views to what the U.S. Supreme Court says the law is. Senator Blumenthal. Tell me, in the short time I have remaining, the Georgetown University Law Center's Supreme Court Institute, which you have headed, is a real resource for anyone who advocates before the Supreme Court. I do not think I have ever used it, but I have heard a lot of great things about it. As executive director of the institute, how did you determine who participates in the program? Ms. Harris. Senator, the institute runs on a strictly nonpartisan basis, on a first-come/first-served basis. We prepare advocates for their arguments before the Supreme Court without regard to the position being taken, without regard to the nature of the client. The commitment really is to the appellate process, to ensuring that the best legal arguments are presented on either side of the issue to the Supreme Court. Senator Blumenthal. And one reason why that is important is that the courts make better decisions when both sides are represented ably. Is that---- Ms. Harris. That is the entire value behind the Supreme Court Institute, that it is a matter of assisting the Court by ensuring that the best possible legal arguments are presented. Senator Blumenthal. And your goal, one of your goals, to the extent that you are able to do so, I hope would be to assure that both sides of an argument are represented ably before your court. Ms. Harris. Absolutely, Senator. Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. Ms. Harris. And I would give full and careful respect to both sides as they represent it. Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. I appreciate your very helpful answers to my questions. My time has expired. Ms. Harris. Thank you. Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. And Senator Blumenthal is going to take "
