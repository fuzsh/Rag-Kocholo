        "text": "“We have one set of laws in this country and they apply to everyone,” he said. The investigation was being conducted with utmost integrity, he added, and promised to seek a speedy trial. He did not take questions.\n\nThe indictment gives the clearest picture yet of the files that Mr. Trump took with him when he left the White House. It said he had illegally kept hold of documents concerning “United States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack; and plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack.”\n\nThe indictment names one of his personal aides, Walt Nauta, as a co-conspirator who assisted in obstructing the investigation into the former president’s retention of sensitive defense documents at his residence and resort in Florida.\n\nProsecutors presented evidence that Mr. Trump shared a highly sensitive “plan of attack” against Iran to visitors at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., in July 2021 — and was recorded on tape describing the material as “highly confidential” and “secret,” while admitting it had not been declassified.\n\nIn another incident in September 2021, he shared a top secret military map with a staffer at his political action committee who did not have a security clearance.\n\nThe filing includes many pictures of what appear to be bankers’ boxes, some containing highly sensitive national documents, which were haphazardly moved by Mr. Nauta and other aides at Mr. Trump’s behest. Some of the boxes appear to be sagging — and on Dec. 7, 2021, Mr. Nauta found that one of the boxes had toppled and spilled its contents on the floor.\n\nThe files that splayed on the carpet included the designation “SECRET/REL TO USA, FVEY” — which meant that they were meant to be seen by officials from the U.S., Britain, New Zealand, Australia and Canada with high-level security clearances.\n\nMr. Trump is expected to appear in Federal District Court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon. Judge Aileen M. Cannon is scheduled to preside over that initial hearing, according to people familiar with the matter. It was not clear whether Judge Cannon, who was criticized by a higher court for handing Mr. Trump a series of unusually favorable rulings during the early stages of the investigation, would remain assigned for the entirety of the case.\n\nThe indictment, handed up by a grand jury in Miami, is the first time a former president has faced federal charges. It puts the nation in an extraordinary position, given Mr. Trump’s status not only as a onetime commander in chief but also as the current front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination to face President Biden, whose administration will now be seeking to convict his potential rival of multiple felonies.\n\nMr. Trump continued to rail against the indictment on Friday, calling it the “greatest witch hunt of all time,” in a Truth Social post.\n\nHere’s what else to know:\n\nThe indictment reaches back to the end of Mr. Trump’s term in January 2021, when the documents — many of which were said to be in the White House residence — were packed in boxes along with clothes, gifts, photographs and other material, and shipped by the General Services Administration to his private club and residence in Florida, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTwo lawyers, James Trusty and John Rowley, have left Mr. Trump’s legal team, and will no longer represent him in the documents case. “I will be represented by Todd Blanche, Esq., and a firm to be named later,” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nA recording of a meeting involving Mr. Trump in July 2021, six months after leaving the White House, is expected to be a key piece of evidence against him. During that meeting, he described a document in front of him as “classified” and “highly confidential,” according to a person briefed on the matter.\n\nCharlie Savage and Nicholas Nehamas contributed reporting.\n\nThe indictment would divide the nation, he said, but Mr. Trump had brought that on himself with poor conduct that “was completely self-inflicted.”\n\nMr. Christie said he still believes Hillary Clinton should have faced charges in response to her mishandling of classified documents on a private email server, and still does not believe the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nBut, he added, “Each case needs to be assessed on its own merits, and the facts that are laid out here are damning.”\n\nThe prosecution of Mr. Trump is about “holding to account people who are in positions of responsibility,” he said.\n\nMr. Christie, who opened the broadcast by noting his own record as a federal prosecutor, has made his willingness to draw critical attention to Mr. Trump central to his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. But only he and one other candidate, Asa Hutchinson, the former governor of Arkansas, spoke favorably on Friday of the government’s case against the former president.\n\nThe other candidates, balancing their need to curry favor with Mr. Trump’s supporters against the imperative to dislodge him as the front-runner, have largely taken the side of the Republican base, which sides with the former president.\n\nRather than saying the Justice Department is holding Mr. Trump to an unfair standard, Mr. Christie said a man of Mr. Trump’s stature and ambitions should be held to a higher standard.\n\n“The conduct is bad,” he said of actions described in the indictment. “And it is bad for anybody in this country to do it, but it’s particularly awful for someone who has been president and who aspires to be president again.”\n\nIn an address to Republicans in North Carolina on Friday night, his first public remarks since the unsealing of federal charges against former President Donald J. Trump, Mr. DeSantis trod carefully and danced quickly past the subject.\n\nPreviewing how he might criticize the Justice Department’s case without letting Mr. Trump entirely off the hook, he offered a somewhat backhanded defense of the now twice-indicted former president — whose loyal followers Mr. DeSantis is seeking to avoid angering — by drawing on his own experiences as a Navy lawyer.\n\nSeeming to muse aloud, Mr. DeSantis asked what the Navy would have done to him had he taken classified documents while in military service. “I would have been court-martialed in a New York minute,” he said, in a riff on Mr. Trump’s hometown.\n\nWhile Mr. DeSantis made his remark in reference to the fact that Hillary Clinton did not face charges over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, his comments could just as easily have applied to Mr. Trump. And they suggested that he believed both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton should have faced charges — or neither.\n\n“Is there a different standard for a Democrat secretary of state versus a former Republican president?” he asked. “I think there needs to be one standard of justice in this country. Let’s enforce it on everybody and make sure we all know the rules.”\n\n(A yearslong inquiry by the State Department found that Mrs. Clinton had not deliberately or systemically mishandled classified information.)\n\nThe nature of Mr. Trump’s federal indictment, which emerged in full view on Friday, left Mr. DeSantis and several other Republican presidential contenders ever more wobbly on the tightrope they are walking, trying to defend a rival accused of cavalierly and illegally keeping sensitive documents about U.S. nuclear programs and the country’s vulnerabilities to military attack.\n\nMany of these candidates now find themselves in the difficult position of rallying around Mr. Trump even as they seek to differentiate themselves from his legacy while he continues to dominate them in the polls.\n\n“This is not how justice should be pursued in our country,” Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and Mr. Trump’s United Nations ambassador, said on Twitter. “The American people are exhausted by the prosecutorial overreach, double standards and vendetta politics.”\n\nSuch caution struck a sharp contrast with the two Republican candidates most willing to criticize Mr. Trump.\n\nFormer Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey called the indictment “devastating,” telling CNN that “the facts that are laid out here are damning.” And in an interview with The New York Times, former Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas pushed back against claims that Mr. Trump was being treated unfairly and reiterated his belief that he should drop out of the race.\n\n“To pejoratively say this is the result of a political prosecution is not in service to our justice system,” Mr. Hutchinson said, adding, “It would be doing a disservice to the country if we did not treat this case seriously.”\n\nJack Smith, the special counsel leading the investigation, urged the public on Friday to understand the “scope and gravity” of the charges.\n\nMr. Trump is expected to appear in Federal District Court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon to face charges including willfully retaining national defense secrets in violation of the Espionage Act, making false statements and conspiracy to obstruct justice. On his Truth Social website, the former president called Mr. Smith “deranged.”\n\nSome voters who attended Mr. DeSantis’s speech in Greensboro, N.C., suggested they were growing weary of the controversy surrounding Mr. Trump, even as they expressed a belief that the charges were politically motivated. (Mr. Trump also faces charges in state court in New York for his alleged role in paying hush money to a porn star.)\n\n“Even if he gets elected again, they’re never going to leave him alone. So what’s the point?” said Mary Noble, 70, who voted twice for Mr. Trump but has not made up her mind in the 2024 primary. “He’ll never be effective. That’s my fear.”\n\nTom Wassel, who sells air pollution control equipment and also supported Mr. Trump in both previous elections, did not mind that Mr. DeSantis had touched on the indictment only briefly, and not very forcefully.\n\n“I want him to talk about what he’s going to run on,” Mr. Wassel, 70, said.\n\nBeyond Mr. Christie and Mr. Hutchinson, Republicans running for president were largely supportive of Mr. Trump, with some arguing that the prosecution amounted to an extraordinary and unfair political vendetta and one going so far as to bluntly promise to pardon him.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, an entrepreneur who has positioned himself to secure the backing of Mr. Trump’s supporters if the former president’s legal problems derail his political comeback, said, “I commit to pardon Trump promptly on Jan. 20, 2025.”\n\nIn a radio interview on Friday before the indictment was unsealed, former Vice President Mike Pence seemed to contrast Mr. Trump’s conduct with his own diligent return of classified documents to the National Archives. But he added that he was “deeply troubled to see this indictment move forward” and took a swipe at what he called “years of politicization” of the Justice Department.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the Republican nominee for president in 2012 and a leading critic of Mr. Trump, was one of the few G.O.P. officeholders to condemn him, saying the former president had “brought these charges upon himself by not only taking classified documents, but by refusing to simply return them when given numerous opportunities to do so.”\n\nJonathan Weisman contributed reporting from Chicago, and Luke Broadwater from Washington.\n\nFrom Austin, Texas, to Jerusalem and Rome, their survival tactics have sometimes paralleled Mr. Trump’s playbook, aggressively working to delegitimize inquiries. Others have tried a different strategy, making efforts to appear sanguine as they denied wrongdoing.\n\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won another term last fall despite a felony corruption case. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Netanyahu has long cast cases against him as the equivalent of a “witch hunt” while seeking to dismiss members of law enforcement who threatened his standing as politically motivated.\n\nIn Italy, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who became the country’s first sitting prime minister to testify as a criminal defendant, faced years of legal turmoil that he often rebuked by suggesting that proceedings against him amounted to efforts at a political coup.\n\nTheir messages are similar to Mr. Trump’s broadsides against America’s law enforcement system — and they are not the first politicians in legal trouble to attack that system.\n\nAhead of his federal corruption and bribery trial in 2002, then- Rep. James A. Traficant Jr., a Democrat from Ohio, declared: “I am not liked by the F.B.I. I am not liked by the Treasury. I am not liked by the courts. And you know what? Quite frankly, I don’t give a damn.”\n\nMr. Traficant became the fifth House member in history to be expelled from Congress.\n\nThere have been other candidates to run for office after being charged with or convicted of crimes, from Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist leader and anti-World War I activist who ran for president from prison in 1920, to Marion S. Barry Jr., who in 1994 won another mayor’s race in Washington, D.C., despite having been convicted on a cocaine charge.\n\nIn the last several years in Texas, a number of candidates have sought office under a cloud of legal questions.\n\nLast year, the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, prevailed in both his primary contest and in the general election, even as a long record of legal troubles — including having been indicted and arrested on criminal securities-fraud charges — followed him through his campaigns. Throughout those races, he bear-hugged Mr. Trump, tried to dismiss the scrutiny as politically motivated and endeared himself to much of the Republican base by leaning into cultural battles.\n\nHis challenges, though, have caught up with him even within his own party: He was impeached by the Texas House last month, over charges that he had used his position to benefit himself and a campaign donor. On Thursday, that donor was arrested by the Travis County Sheriff’s Office on behalf of the F.B.I.\n\nAnd in 2015, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas announced a presidential bid despite having been indicted on two felony charges of abusing his official capacity and coercing a public servant.\n\nMr. Perry, denying wrongdoing, sought to project an air of confidence, smiling in a mugshot that went viral and going out for frozen custard with his legal team.\n\n“The takeaway was that ‘this is a ridiculous indictment, a ridiculous process, and I’m going to approach it in an unflappable manner,’” said Ray Sullivan, who co-chaired a pro-Perry super PAC during that presidential election and had served as one of his top aides.\n\nThe case was later dismissed.\n\nKaton Dawson, a former chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, was a supporter of Mr. Perry’s during his relatively short-lived campaign.\n\n“It hampered everything we did,” he said of the indictment against Mr. Perry. “It was something that took some of the steam out of our sails.”\n\nBut Mr. Dawson, who is supporting Nikki Haley — the former South Carolina governor who later served as United Nations ambassador — in the 2024 presidential race, was skeptical that Mr. Trump’s indictment would have a similar effect on him, at least for now, with Republican primary voters.\n\n“He will get another bump in the polls,” Mr. Dawson predicted, saying that he expected many Republican voters to see the indictment as political. Still, he added, “That political capital runs out at some time. The question is, when does it run out and people say, ‘I’ve had enough.’”\n\nKitty Bennett contributed research.\n\nBut he emerged on Friday to make a concise case for his decision to charge Mr. Trump in connection with the former president’s retention of classified documents at his residence in Florida.\n\n“Adherence to the rule of law is a bedrock principle of the Department of Justice,” he said. “And our nation’s commitment to the rule of law sets an example for the world. We have one set of laws in this country, and they apply to everyone. Applying those laws. Collecting facts. That’s what determines the outcome of an investigation. Nothing more. Nothing less.”\n\nBut visuals, as Mr. Trump has so often claimed, matter just as much as words — and Mr. Smith cut a striking figure.\n\nHe looked very much like a widely circulated photograph of him taken when he was a war crimes prosecutor in The Hague a couple of years ago, with the same graying beard, deeply lined face and solemnity — but without the black-and-purple judicial robe.\n\nHis team had considered waiting until Mr. Trump’s arraignment in Miami next week before issuing a public statement, according to several people close to the situation, but he seems to have decided that presenting a more complete rationale for his actions was needed to counter the narrative of political persecution put forth by Mr. Trump and his allies.\n\nThe decision to hold a news conference at Mr. Smith’s office, rather than at the department headquarters, was also tactical, intended to underscore Attorney General Merrick B. Garland’s distance from the decision-making process.\n\nMr. Smith spoke for just under three minutes, and took no questions, but in that time he delivered a defense of his team’s work, which Trump allies dismiss as a politically motivated witch hunt.\n\nStill, Mr. Smith played down his own presence, casting the indictment as unavoidable, given what he described as “the gravity” of the crimes Mr. Trump, and his co-defendant, Walt Nauta, are accused of committing.\n\nHe ended by thanking his staff for “upholding the rule of law in our country,” then walked out of the room, ignoring questions and leaving news photographers staring at his image in their viewfinders.\n\nNevertheless, it would be extraordinary for a person who is under indictment, let alone convicted of a felony, to be a major party nominee.\n\nThere are only a few historical examples of somewhat serious candidates who even come close. They include the unsuccessful run in the 2016 Republican primary by Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, after he was indicted on charges of abuse of power (the charges were dismissed months after he dropped out of the race), and the 1920 run by Eugene V. Debs as the Socialist Party nominee while he sat in prison for an Espionage Act conviction.\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to be elected president while a felony case against him was pending or after any conviction, many complications would ensue.\n\nThe Justice Department has in the past taken the position that even indicting a president while in office would be unconstitutional because it would interfere with the president’s ability to perform duties as head of the executive branch. Mr. Trump would surely try to get the case dismissed on that basis. There is no definitive Supreme Court ruling because the issue has never arisen before.\n\nNotably, in 1997, the Supreme Court allowed a federal lawsuit against President Bill Clinton to proceed while he was in office. That was a civil case, however — not a criminal one. Mr. Trump also faces a state case, an indictment in Manhattan in April, where he is accused of falsifying business records related to a hush-money payment.\n\nEven more extraordinary complications would arise were Mr. Trump to be convicted and incarcerated and yet elected anyway. One possibility is that he could win a federal court order requiring his release from prison as a result of a constitutional challenge. Another is that upon the commencement of his second term, he could be immediately removed from office under the 25th Amendment as “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”\n\nMr. Jordan has for years vilified the F.B.I., and since taking the helm of the Judiciary panel he has been grasping for evidence that the bureau is corrupt and has unfairly targeted Mr. Trump and conservatives. The letter was Mr. Jordan’s latest effort to press those claims.\n\nIn it, he cited an interview his panel conducted this week with Steven D’Antuono, the former head of the F.B.I.’s Washington field office, whose concerns about the search warrant last year were detailed earlier by The Washington Post.\n\nMr. Jordan said that during his closed-door interview, Mr. D’Antuono had testified that he believed a search conducted with the consent of the former president — rather than a surprise search — would have been “the best thing for all parties involved,” including “the F.B.I., for former President Trump, and for the country.”\n\nMr. D’Antuono declined to comment about his interview.\n\nAmong the other concerns Mr. Jordan said Mr. D’Antuono had listed were that Washington officials, not the Miami field office, had conducted the search and that the F.B.I. did not wait until one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers was present to begin the search.\n\nBut Mr. Jordan omitted several facts from his letter in an apparent effort to place Mr. D’Antuono’s account in the worst possible light.\n\nMr. D’Antuono has told associates that he was not opposed to executing the search warrant, but wanted to give Mr. Trump’s legal team one last chance to hand over the documents before sending agents into his club — a position that his superiors overruled.\n\nProsecutors believed that Mr. Trump’s lawyers had already misled them once, falsely certifying to the F.B.I. and the Justice Department that they had searched for documents at the club and turned over everything they could find. The 37-count indictment against Mr. Trump and one of his aides released on Friday laid out in detail the actions the former president took to deceive prosecutors and cause the lawyers to make the false certification.\n\nMr. D’Antuono has also told associates that he was worried about the optics of F.B.I. agents entering Mr. Trump’s property in raid jackets, given the continued vilification of the bureau by the former president and his supporters.\n\nMr. D’Antuono also believed that the Miami field office should have been more involved in the investigation because of its proximity to Mr. Trump’s resort and the substantial Jan. 6 investigation that had consumed the Washington field office’s resources, according to the account he gave associates. But he told Mr. Jordan during the interview that he understood that his counterintelligence agents were involved because they were experts on the matter, according to a portion of the interview transcript released by Democrats on the panel.\n\nAnd Mr. D’Antuono told him that the prosecutors handling the Trump case had not done anything wrong, another assertion that Mr. Jordan did not mention in his letter.\n\nDemocrats on the panel said Mr. D’Antuono provided information that did not portray Mr. Trump favorably.\n\nMr. D’Antuono told the panel how the classified documents hidden at Mar-a-Lago included documents so highly sensitive that not even he, as the head of the office, could read them, according to excerpts from his transcript released by the committee’s Democrats. Mr. D’Antuono testified he had to call in outside help to prevent further “spillage” of those classified materials.\n\nAnd Mr. D’Antuono testified that Mr. Trump was physically present for a key act of potential obstruction, according to excerpts. Mr. Trump was standing with one of his lawyers at the steps of Mar-a-Lago when the lawyer handed investigators the letter falsely certifying that all classified documents had been returned, Mr. D’Antuono testified.\n\nDuring that meeting, Mr. Trump told the F.B.I. and Justice Department officials that he was “open book.”\n\n“This country didn’t vote for an altar boy. Everybody has skeletons in the closet,” said Peter Demopoulos, 68, who operates a cattle farm in Fredonia, Wis., a rural village about 30 miles north of Milwaukee.\n\nMr. Demopolous, who moved to the United States from his native Greece in 1971, said he had voted for Mr. Trump in the two previous elections and would vote for him again in the coming Republican primary, whether or not he’s found guilty in the documents case or in other investigations.\n\n“Everybody comes here for a reason, to be successful,” he said. “And I think having Trump or somebody like Trump, I think it’s a beautiful thing — to create jobs, to do the right thing, to motivate people.”\n\nIt is far too early to measure the political impact of the latest indictment. A Yahoo-YouGov poll conducted last month found that while majorities of Democrats and independents considered removing “highly classified documents from the White House and obstructing efforts to retrieve them” a serious crime, Republicans were more divided. The poll found 42 percent of Republicans called it a serious crime, while 35 percent said it was not serious, and 22 percent said they were not sure.\n\nAs Mr. Trump continues to portray the investigations against him as a vast conspiracy, some Republican voters repeated those claims and echoed what they see as Mr. Trump’s achievements in office. Others were more unsure about how much weight to give the federal indictment and how to factor it into a voting decision in 2024.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Don Fretz, 76, a registered Republican, said he had voted “grudgingly” for Mr. Trump in 2016 and 2020 but after the new indictment, was unwilling to do so again. He hoped to vote for another Republican nominee in 2024, he said.\n\n“I think the man should step down,” from the race, Mr. Fretz, a retiree, said outside a convenience store in Souderton, Pa. “He has too much baggage. He has great policies, but he doesn’t know when to be quiet.”\n\nJohn Lanser, 60, who does masonry work among other construction-related tasks, stopped at a bakery in the Fredonia area in Wisconsin on Friday morning to get doughnuts while on his way to pick up a load of cement. He voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020 and plans to support him again, regardless of his legal situation.\n\n“People didn’t like Trump or who he was,” Mr. Lanser said. “But what he did for the country was great.”\n\nMr. Lanser said that the former president’s leadership yielded results.\n\n“Gas prices were lower,” he said. “The economy was good. Everything was better in terms of cost of living than what it is now.”\n\nHeather Stein, a businesswoman in Pennsylvania, said she had not voted for Mr. Trump in past elections and didn’t plan to vote for him or President Biden if they are the nominees in 2024. Still, she said she didn’t understand why Mr. Trump was being charged in connection with taking classified documents after his term ended.\n\n“Every president leaves the White House with boxes of stuff,” she said outside a supermarket in Blue Bell, Pa., hours before the indictment was unsealed. “It could be that there was something egregious in the documents, I don’t know. But I don’t have a lot of faith in that process at the moment.”\n\nMs. Stein, 47, who did not specify a political affiliation, said she might be tempted to vote for a third-party candidate in 2024.\n\n“I wish they would both just go away,” she said of Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden. “I’m not more or less likely now to vote for either of them. I want one of those T-shirts that says, ‘Any functioning adult 2024.’”"
