        "text": "NCJW/Essex Career Closet is the Recipient of\n\nHandbag Trade-In Days from Brighton Collectibles at the Mall at Short Hills\n\nThe Career Closet, a program of the Linda and Rudy Slucker NCJW/Essex Center for Women, was the recipient of a special trade-in event at the fashion accessories store Brighton Collectibles that took place from July 14th to 23th. This is the sixth year the Brighton Collectibles store at the Mall at Short Hills participated in this event with the Career Closet being the recipient.\n\n“Brighton is to be commended for its support of women entering the workforce who are faced with the financial challenge of having interview and work appropriate clothing,” said Isabel Margolin, co-chair of the Career Closet. “This is really a wonderful thing for the NCJW/Essex Career Closet.”\n\nBrighton offered $25 – $50 off new handbags when buyers traded in their own gently-used handbags. The gently-used handbags were then donated to the Career Closet. This year the Career Closet received 92 handbags from the annual 10-day event.\n\nVolunteers at the NCJW/Essex Career Closet, located in Livingston, NJ, serve as personal shoppers to assist women in obtaining career attire and accessories appropriate for the workplace. Women are referred by the NCJW/Essex Center for Women and other social service agencies and receive coordinating clothing and accessories appropriate for interviewing and the workplace at no cost. The objective is to help women enter an interview or begin a new job with confidence. The Career Closet is open to clients by appointment only.\n\nMary Ricciuto, Store Manager at Brighton Collectibles in Short Hills, explained that throughout the year Brighton For Good partners with organizations at both the local and national level to give back to communities in a variety of ways. “By donating a gently used handbag at the Handbag Trade-In event, a woman in need is given a small luxury that others may take for granted,” she said. “Both Brighton Collectibles and the NCJW/Essex Career Closet benefit from this wonderful collaboration.”\n\nLocal Fundraising Group Supports the\n\nNCJW/Essex 9th Annual Back 2 School Store\n\nThe National Council of Jewish Women, Essex County Section (NCJW/Essex) received a generous donation from a local ad hoc group of the Rotary Club of the Caldwells to support this year’s 9th Annual NCJW/Essex Back 2 School Store.\n\nThe group of three local women who call themselves “The Vixens,” are focused on raising funds and awareness for hyper-local causes to help women and children in the West Essex area. Their efforts raised $2500 in conjunction with the Rotary Club of the Caldwells to benefit the Back 2 School Store.\n\nThe NCJW/Essex Back 2 School Store is held each year and provides an opportunity for disadvantaged children, grades K-5, to “shop” cost-free in a one-day pop-up store full of brand new clothes and school supplies donated by NCJW/Essex and its sponsoring partners. Each child is escorted by a volunteer “personal shopper” through the store to pick out his or her own new backpack with school supplies, and a new outfit complete with a winter coat, pants, shirt, sneakers, undergarments, and winter hats and gloves. Since 2009 and including this year, the Back 2 School Store has benefitted nearly 4700 children and utilized over 3200 volunteers who were involved in planning, organizing and working at the store on the day of the event.\n\n“We chose the Back 2 School Store as our focus this year because we recognized that there were many children in need, right in our own backyards,” said Samantha Cordaro McCoy, West Caldwell Library Director and one of The Vixens. “We heard a presentation about the project and knew we had to do something. We all had fond memories of the beginning of school and the shopping that went along with it and we wanted to make that possible for local children who are economically disadvantaged.”\n\n“On behalf of NCJW/Essex, we want to thank The Vixens for their generous donation,” said NCJW/Essex president Shari Harrison. “We are so grateful to have such incredible sponsors to contribute to a cause so close to our hearts. Without them, none of this would be possible.”\n\nBig Grins and High Fives!\n\nNearly 800 Children Shop Cost-Free at NCJW/Essex Back 2 School Store\n\n“I got the coolest stuff!” said one young boy running up to greet his father after attending the 9th Annual NCJW/Essex Back 2 School Store (B2SS) on Sunday, July 30th. “My new backpack makes me feel smart and important!” said another child. With walls completely lined with coats, rows of brand new sneakers and racks and racks of clothing, the B2SS outfitted nearly 800 economically disadvantaged children with the help of 475 volunteers. The children were able to shop cost-free for brand new attire, school supplies and personal care items, encouraging a well-equipped and confident start to the new school year.\n\nThe day kicked off with a ribbon cutting ceremony for dignitaries and supporters of the store led by Shari Harrison, NCJW/Essex President. B2SS co-chairs Jill Sorkin Johnson of Montclair, NJ, Margie Zucker of Short Hills, NJ, and Karen Cherins of West Orange, NJ joined with dignitaries to cut the ribbon. This year’s B2SS would not have been possible without major support from many individuals, foundations and corporations.\n\nFollowing the ribbon cutting, the store was opened to a long line of excited children, eager to enter and pick out brand new outfits including pants, shirts, winter coats, gloves, socks, undergarments and hats. The children, referred by over 30 social service agencies, were greeted by a personal shopper who led them on their shopping excursion. First stop: a hallway of colorful new backpacks! Then each child received a warm welcome into the 4,000 sq foot space, hosted at B’nai Shalom in West Orange. By the end of the spree, each child had a big bag of clothing and a backpack filled with personal care items and school supplies. New this year, each child also got to select a new book from the Tabak-Fass Book Nook, with all levels of books donated by Scholastic.\n\nWhile the children shopped, parents and guardians visited the onsite Gaelen Family Resource Center. Lining the halls were organizations such as Advocates for Children NJ, the Essex County Family Justice Center, KinderSmile Foundation, the NCJW/Essex Center for Women, Planned Parenthood of Metro NJ, and the Rachel Coalition along with University Hospital which offered free health screenings and health information. “This is truly a great day,” said Sara Peña, Senior Community Outreach Coordinator at University Hospital. “We are excited about this partnership and our ability to provide services and support to the local communities.”\n\nThe cost of school supplies is often overlooked as a major annual expense. Families that are living in poverty struggle with the rising cost demands of public education. In Essex County alone, 22% of households with children lived below the poverty level in 2015. NCJW/Essex believes that no child should start off the school year already behind, and has put together the B2SS for the past nine years to meet this need.\n\n“Being here makes me feel happy because a bunch of kids like me are able to get all new clothes and be excited about school together,” said one young boy in attendance. Another rising first grader was so excited to pick out jeans, a sci-fi t-shirt and Velcro sneakers that he wore them home. “I wish I could come back every day,” said one little girl. “I just don’t like it here – I LOVE it!”\n\nRanging from college freshman to grandparents, the passion each volunteer brought was undeniably visible through the smiles of hundreds of children who filled the store. With three shifts throughout the day, volunteers underwent specific training on how to optimize the shopping experience for each child. From picking out pens and calculators to help finding jeans with the perfect fit, the personal shoppers guided and encouraged each child through every step.\n\nWith shoes that fit just right and smiles from ear to ear, the children exited the store to be reunited with their parents. “Thank you all so much,” said one mother departing with her son and daughter, shopping bags in tow. “We’ve come to this event for years and it never fails to give my kids the confidence and excitement they need to start off their school year right.”\n\nJenna Bush Hager,\n\nTeacher, Author & Journalist\n\nto be Keynote Speaker at NCJW/Essex Opening Event in October\n\nThe National Council of Jewish Women, Essex County Section (NCJW/Essex) announces its 2017 Opening Event featuring teacher, author, and journalist Jenna Bush Hager, a contributing correspondent for NBC’s Today.

The event, on Sunday, July 30, 2017, outfitted nearly 800 children with the help of 475 volunteers.\n\n“The support from Investors Foundation is important to the success of this community-wide event,” said Shari Harrison, President, NCJW/Essex. “We rely on the generosity of many individuals, foundations and corporations to enable us to purchase brand new items for the children including pants, shirts, winter coats, gloves, socks, undergarments, hats and backpacks.” Harrison explains that the children are referred by over 30 social service agencies and are escorted through the store with a personal shopper.

Hager discussed her work as a teacher in Baltimore and working in Latin America where she learned about the power of education “to change lives and to save lives.” She encouraged the audience to tell the stories of people making seemingly small, ordinary changes that can ultimately impact people’s lives in a big, extraordinary way.\n\nHager, this year’s keynote speaker for the NCJW/Essex yearly kick-off event, is a contributing correspondent for NBC’s Today, an editor for Southern Living magazine and chair of UNICEF’s Next Generation which works towards reducing the number of preventable childhood deaths around the world. She is the daughter of former U.S. President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush.\n\n“There is no definition of a successful life without service,” said Hager to the audience of NCJW/Essex volunteers, relaying the message she learned early on from her grandfather, former U.S. President George H. W. Bush. With poise, charm and wit, Hager spoke of her own experiences as a teacher, author, journalist, daughter, sister and mother. She read a few excerpts from her just released book of short stories, Sisters First: Stories from Our Wild and Wonderful Life, co-authored with her twin sister, Barbara Pierce Bush. The mix of funny stories and more serious anecdotes brought the audience to tears in one moment and laughter the next.\n\nAlso addressing the audience was Deacon Francis Dixon of the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, NJ, who shared his experiences with the NCJW/Essex Back 2 School Store and the partnership that has been created between NCJW/Essex and the Church. Deacon Dixon reflected on the kindness of NCJW/Essex volunteers who believe in the work they do stating, “Long after the shoes and clothing provided by the Back 2 School Store no longer fit, the young people whose lives you touched will remember you for your kindness.”\n\n“The messages from our Opening Event were positive and uplifting,” said Shari Harrison, president NCJW/Essex. “They give us renewed inspiration to continue our work of providing compassion and community support to change lives for the better.”\n\n“$100 for 100” Event Benefits Families from the\n\nLinda & Rudy Slucker NCJW/Essex Center for Women\n\nNineteen children from 9 different families identified by the Linda & Rudy Slucker NCJW/Essex Center for Women attended a very special shopping event on Sunday, December 10, 2017 at Dick’s Sporting Goods in Union, NJ. Sponsored by Joyal Capital Management Foundation, Inc., the “$100 for 100” event helps young people in need during the holidays and gives them the opportunity to shop with a generous gift of a $100 gift card. Children enjoyed hot chocolate and donuts while shopping for sporting equipment, clothing, ice skates, boots, and hundreds of other items throughout the store.\n\nSixteen-year-old Bruce Armistead of Linden, NJ, picked out a snowboard and some other winter items. “I’d like to thank the Joyal Foundation for its generosity,” he said. “The spreading of love and positivity that you have shown through giving has inspired me to be more generous in my day to day life.” Another mother who brought her two children to the event said, “My kids were ecstatic to learn that they could spend $100 on items of their choosing at Dick’s Sporting Goods. I am all about making good memories and I know that this is something they will never forget.”\n\nThe “$100 for 100” began at a single store in 2008 and has grown to be an interactive community giving event which has expanded to 12 states and benefits more than 12,000 children each year. At each event, the Joyal Foundation provides gift cards to 100 children in need who have been nominated by members of the community or community agencies.\n\nNCJW/Essex was included as a partner organization thanks to Matthew Stadtmauer of Summit, New Jersey, the state’s Lead Volunteer for “$100 for 100.” Stadtmauer’s mother, Trudy Elwood, was an active member of NCJW/Essex and impressed upon him the importance of the organization’s advocacy work for women, children and families. “It was a natural fit,” says Stadtmauer, who adds that with each child who comes in to shop, his hopes for the program are realized.\n\nThe NCJW/Essex Center for Women, which offers career services, computer classes, workshops for women and support programs, was honored to partner with the Joyal Foundation for the third year in a row. “The generosity of the Joyal Foundation is truly inspiring,” comments Patty Kremen, Career Services Manager at the Center for Women. “It is wonderful to see how much joy it brings to children and families. Parents are able to grant wishes to their children and children feel exhilarated and empowered to be able to choose the items they really want.”\n\nPHOTO CAPTION 1: Pictured (l to r) are Davanna Armistead of Linden, NJ, Patty Kremen, Career Services Manager at the NCJW/Essex Center for Women, and 16-year-old Bruce Armistead who attended “$100 for 100” at Dick’s Sporting Goods in Union, NJ.\n\nPHOTO CAPTION 2: Pictured (l to r) are Chiquita Byrd of Newark, with Patty Kremen, Career Services Manager at the NCJW/Essex Center for Women, along with shoppers Aniyah, age 14, and Shuntez, age 8.\n\nDanger: Pregnancy Ahead\n\nExamining the Growing Number of Infringements on Women’s Access to Health Care\n\nA Special Event to Commemorate the Anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Decision\n\nThe threats to women’s health care are real. Today, in the name of fetal rights and under the guise of the war on drugs, women have been arrested for being pregnant and continuing to term in spite of a drug or alcohol problem. In addition, training and technological advances in the area of reproductive health care are under attack. If you share the concern that women’s overall health is being alarmingly jeopardized, plan to attend the NCJW/Essex Lunch and Learn, Danger: Pregnancy Ahead, on Thursday, January 18, 2017. This special event commemorates the anniversary of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision ensuring a woman’s right to a safe and legal abortion. The program, from 12:00 pm – 2:00 pm, will be held at Congregation B’nai Jeshurun, 1025 South Orange Avenue, Short Hills, NJ.\n\n“Danger: Pregnancy Ahead” will focus on the punitive and counterproductive child welfare interventions that threaten pregnant women with child neglect or abuse, restrictions faced by health care providers and how they impact patient care, and the challenges in New Jersey related to reproductive health care. The program will feature a panel of experts in reproductive health and advocacy including: Nancy Rosenbloom, JD, Director of Legal Advocacy, National Advocates for Pregnant Women, Noa’a Shimoni, MD, Medical Director of Student Health Services, NJ Medical School Department of Family Medicine, and three speakers from NJ Medical School Department of OB/GYN & Women’s Health — Mark H. Einstein, MD, MS, Professor and Chair, Lauren Barlog, MD, Assistant Professor, and Natalie Roche, MD, Assistant Professor.\n\nDanger: Pregnancy Ahead is being co-sponsored by many community organizations supporting reproductive justice. The program is $20 and includes a buffet lunch. Pre-registration is required. Please call (973) 740-0588 or visit www.ncjwessex.org to register."
