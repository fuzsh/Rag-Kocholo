        "text": "Josh came to the firm after serving as a judicial law clerk for the Hon. Gregory F. Van Tatenhove, U.S. District Judge, Eastern District of Kentucky. Previously, he participated in the firm’s summer associate program and served as a legal intern for the Hon. Karen K. Caldwell, Chief U.S. District Judge, Eastern District of Kentucky. Before going to law school, Josh was a United States Probation Officer for the Northern District of Georgia and served as a Management Specialist and Probation Officer for the Georgia Department of Corrections.\n\nOutside of the firm, Josh enjoys domestic and international travel – especially when paired with culinary indulgences – and loves all things outdoors, particularly hiking and camping. He is active in the Lexington community, serving on the Board of two local non-profits, AthensWest Theatre Company and Seedleaf, Inc. He routinely looks for ways to stretch the boundaries of his comfort zone and, in doing so, has found himself participating in multiple 200+ mile relay runs and one ultramarathon."
