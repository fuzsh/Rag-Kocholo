He also served as a research assistant to professor Dana Remus at the University of North Carolina School of Law. Colston received his juris doctor from the UNC School of Law. An accomplished musician, he has a bachelor’s degree in music from UNC, a master’s degree in music from Baylor University and a doctor of musical arts from John Hopkins University.\n\nCollins will focus their practice on education law, employment law and litigation. A former educator, Saint has a background working with students and advocating for public education. They were a legal intern with the Council for Children’s Rights in Charlotte, where they navigated the special education and student discipline processes. They also worked as a summer associate at Brooks Pierce in 2016. Saint received their juris doctor from Wake Forest University School of Law. They have both a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a master’s degree in school counseling from the University of Alabama.\n\nBailey will focus her work on transactional law, including business mergers, acquisitions and entity formations. She will also do some work in commercial real estate, representing both buyers and sellers. Before joining Brooks Pierce, she clerked for North Carolina Supreme Court Chief Justice Mark D. Martin. Bailey received her law degree from the University of Texas School of Law and her bachelor’s degree in international studies and economics from UNC.\n\nWhorton will focus her practice on entertainment, media and intellectual property law. Before entering law school, she worked as a television producer for two PBS stations in Florida.
