        "text": "by Mandy Hicks\n\nNicholas “Nick” Rabold has joined English, Lucas, Priest & Owsley, LLP as an associate attorney. Rabold currently practices in the areas of general litigation, healthcare and government, and appeals.\n\nRabold previously served as Assistant United States Attorney for the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Kentucky. There, Rabold handled matters ranging from multimillion dollar fraud to capital prosecutions. Prior to serving as Assistant United States Attorney, he served as law clerk to both the Honorable Karen K. Caldwell and the Honorable Edward B. Atkins of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. Rabold was a summer associate with both McBrayer, McGinnis, Leslie & Kirkland, PLLC and English, Lucas, Priest & Owsley, LLP.\n\nRabold is originally from Bowling Green and graduated from the Honors College at Western Kentucky University (WKU) in May of 2014 with a B.A. in History and Legal Studies. As an undergraduate, he was a four-time recipient of the President’s Scholar Academic Achievement Award. Rabold twice won first prize for his presentations at the Research Experiences & Creative Heights Conference, and he successfully defended his Undergraduate Thesis with ‘Distinction.’\n\nRabold attended the University of Kentucky College of Law, earning his J.D. in May of 2017. In his first year, Rabold was named Champion of the UK Law 1L Appellate Oral Advocacy Competition. He went on to compete in two national competitions, including both the Albert R. Mugel National Tax Moot Court Competition and the UCLA Williams Institute Moot Court Competition. He was admitted as a pupil of the Central Kentucky American Inn of Court and was recipient of the Winslow Kentucky Law Journal Scholarship. His final year, Rabold was named Editor-in-Chief of the Kentucky Law Journal—the highest academic honor attainable.\n\nBob Young, Managing Partner for ELPO Law, says, “We are excited to have Nick come back to join the ELPO Law team. Nick has a great deal of experience in the practice of law and will add much value to the legal services that we are able to offer to our clients.”\n\nRabold currently lives with his spouse in Bowling Green. He is the incoming President of the Bowling Green-Warren County Landmark Association and a board member of the Friends of Riverview at Hobson Grove. He is a fourth-generation member of the Bowling Green Garden Club and a seventh-generation member of the Presbyterian Church of Bowling Green."
