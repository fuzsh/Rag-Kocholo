        "text": "It would be natural and understandable to imagine that silent movies are a primitive form of cinema made when the basic techniques and conventions were in their infancy. Such an assumption would be wrong. In some respects, the early films benefited from their newness. They were not treading familiar hackneyed storylines, because there were no previous movie storylines to follow. Everything was still fresh and new.\n\nBut what about the techniques? Surely they were unsophisticated and weak? Certainly they were not as advanced as we are used to seeing, but the person who therefore imagines that silent movies are therefore limited and a little dull is obviously a person who has not taken the trouble to sit down and watch many of the best silent films.\n\nF W Murnau was one of the most talented directors of the silent era, and he had a gift for putting images on the screen that still look breathtaking and remarkable today. In fact the movies of Murnau were far in advance of many early talkies, which were handicapped by the need to soundproof noisy cameras. He was able to create a visual spectacle that is just as captivating today as it was then.\n\nThere is a kind of wizardry about the best silent moves – the ability to use the most basic of methods to make something extraordinary. Perhaps the very limitations of the films actually helped make them more convincing. When you watch a silent movie, you are never in doubt that you are watching a film. The images may be grainy or flickering. The movement of the images may be jumpy. There is no sound but music. Actors talk and yet we hear no words. Occasionally an intertitle flashes on the screen to tell us something that they said.\n\nThis is in contrast to movies ever since. The images on the screen have become clearer, the special effects have become more sophisticated, the dialogue is audible. It is possible to lose oneself in the film and treat it as reality. As a result, the moviemaker cannot afford to use sets, props or effects that look too phoney, as they break the viewer’s suspension of disbelief.\n\nMurnau did not have this problem, because the silent movie is by its nature dream-like and unreal. When Murnau shows Faust and Mephisto flying amidst dark and looming clouds, passing by peculiar birds that look almost like pterodactyls, the director can use models of houses, mountains, rivers and waterfalls below the actors, and we accept the illusion. In other scenes, we do not mind that flames are being created by burners, or that fans are being used to make the characters’ cloaks billow in the wind. The image still convinces.\n\nSometimes it is remarkable to wonder how the visual trickery was achieved. Images are superimposed on the screen. The devil is seen looming over the earth, dwarfing the entire town. Mephisto draws up a diabolical pact for Faust to sign, and we see glowing words appear slowly on the scroll, a scene which took an entire day to film.\n\nIn any case, the film embraces opportunities for looking artificial. Houses are crooked, camera shots are slanted, and parts of the screen are darkened so that we are only allowed to focus on the part of the image that Murnau considers to be important.\n\nFaust was F W Murnau’s last German film, and it proved to be the most expensive one that the film company UTA (Universum-Film Aktiengesellschaft) had ever made. This was soon superseded by the even-more-costly Metropolis a year later. Murnau used two cameras recording at the same time while filming (a new concept then), and filmed his scenes many times over. There are also five different versions of Faust available, as the film was cut for different international audiences.\n\nThe story is taken largely from Goethe’s Faust, but it incorporates ideas from older legends too. The legend of Faust dates back to the seventeenth-century. One of the earliest literary treatments was by Christopher Marlowe in his play Dr Faustus. Murnau’s version of the story follows the same structure as his later film, Sunrise. It begins in horror, moves into a comical and romantic central section, and ends with a return of the horrifying elements, leaving us in doubt that the hero will triumph over his own dark side after all.\n\nWe open with a wager made between an archangel (Werner Fuetterer) and the demon Mephisto (Emil Jannings). The subject of their wager is an elderly alchemist called Faust (Gösta Ekman) who lectures about the wonder of choosing between good and evil. We may well note the ambiguity of Faust’s praise here.\n\nMephisto sees Faust as a man who preaches good and does evil, because Faust is obsessed with turning metal into gold. Mephisto pledges to steal Faust’s soul and destroy what is divine in him. If he wins, Satan will be given dominion over the Earth.\n\nReligious imagery abounds in Faust. We open with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse riding through the sky, and this is a world where the Devil looms ominously over the town, and an angel competes with a demon. Intentionally or not, the film does not present the Christian god in a good way. A man’s soul is endangered purely in order to win a bet, and no god intervenes to baulk the evil deeds done by Satan.\n\nThis is not purely a specious wager set up to create dramatic interest. It contains an echo of an actual Bible story, the Book of Job, where God allows Satan to destroy the happiness of one his most loyal followers as a bet to prove that Job will remain loyal to the god who sat back while Satan ruined Job’s life.\n\nMephisto’s first evil deed is to send the Black Death to Faust’s village. God does not help his own people. The pious villagers kiss a cross, and the rest of the village cavort in the streets, preferring to dance and to die in each other’s arms, if die they must. A preacher lectures to them, but in the end it is the preacher himself who succumbs to the plague.\n\nAs intended, Faust’s beliefs are shaken by a disease that he cannot treat, and he loses his conviction that faith will be any use against the plague. “We are lost! Belief will not help you, nor shall knowledge! Everything is lies!” he exclaims. He throws his alchemy books on the fire. While he is doing so, his Bible falls open. He reads a passage about God’s mercy. The hollowness of the words causes Faust to add the book to the conflagration.\n\nOne book escapes the flames. It is a work that describes how to summon the Prince of Darkness. Some of the movie’s most amazing imagery follows as Faust performs the service to conjure the devil. A circle of light appears around Faust, reminiscent of the circles around the robot in Metropolis. Amidst the flames and lights, Mephisto appears, taking the form of an old man with glowing eyes who doffs his cap at Faust.\n\nMephisto is ready with a contract for Faust to sell his soul to the Devil in exchange for favours. Of course Faust has to sign using his own blood. The alchemist is resistant at first and seeks to renounce Satan, but the image of the helpless townsfolk’s hands reaching up to him reminds him of his wish to save their lives, and he agrees to a one-day trial: “Then I will help in the Devil’s name,” he proclaims.\n\nThere is always a catch in any favour offered by the Devil, as Faust soon learns. When he tries to heal the sick, he is repelled by the presence of a cross. The townsfolk realise that he is Satanically inspired and chase him away with stones. This is Faust’s last attempt to behave in an altruistic manner, and we hear no more about the plague.\n\nHowever Mephisto has other entiements to offer Faust: “Do you want a woman, a card game, an orgy?” he asks. The possibilities for a lifetime of pleasure are a strong temptation for Faust, and a seductive replacement for doing good deeds, as Mephisto intended. For good measure, Mephisto makes the offer more alluring by making Faust young again. Mephisto too appears younger. His features are still diabolical however. He has slanted eyebrows, and the tufts of hair at either side that serve to simulate (or perhaps conceal) his horns.\n\nThe temptations of the flesh are offered to Faust in the form of the Duchess of Parma (Hanna Ralph). While Faust seduces the Duchess, Mephisto murders her groom in a supposed duel where the demon cheats in a macabre fashion, reappearing next to his own seemingly dead body and killing his hapless adversary.\n\nAs Mephisto offers to take away Faust’s powers at the end of the day before he can fully enjoy the Duchess, he leans insinuatingly into Faust’s ear and asks him to sign his soul away permanently. On a wave of lust, Faust accepts. It seems that Faust has become entirely corrupted by the Devil.\n\nHowever the divine spark in Faust is not dead yet. He soon tires of obliging women, and begins to turn his attentions to a purer woman. This is Gretchen (Camilla Horn), a young and innocent girl. Perhaps Faust can be saved yet. However Mephisto instead sees this as an opportunity for further mischief. He gives Faust a gold chain with which to tempt Gretchen while he flirts with her maiden Aunt Marthe (Yvette Guilbert).\n\nThese scenes are felt to be the weakest in the movie. After the creepy atmospherics of the first part, we now watch sweetly romantic scenes of Faust wooing Gretchen interspersed with comic moments as Mephisto courts her aunt in an unlikely manner. Certainly these scenes do not generate the same interest and excitement of what went before, and what is to come.\n\nHowever this may reflect a problem in the story of Faust itself. Many versions of the legend sag in the middle, including Marlowe’s play, where the great scientist is reduced to using his power to play childish pranks on people. In this case, Faust uses his gift for little beyond seducing a naïve young girl.\n\nThis sense of anti-climax is dramatically less exciting, but artistically necessary. Faust cannot be allowed to achieve too many good things, or else his deal with the Devil will seem like a worthy act, and the Devil will emerge as a force for good in the play. It is necessary that Faust’s pact should be a hollow one.\n\nHence Faust’s attempts to heal the sick fail, and he loses interest in everything but the indulgence of his pleasures. Set on the other side, Faust’s hedonism cannot take too evil a form, or else we will lose all sympathy and compassion for him before the third act. This restricts how far the story can take Faust’s uses and abuses of his newfound capabilities, and the full potentialities of unlimited power cannot be explored.\n\nWhile Faust thinks Mephisto is serving him, the demon is serving his own master and secretly working against Faust. After Faust sleeps with Gretchen, Mephisto is quick to wake up her mother (Frida Richard) who dies of shock when she sees her daughter has been seduced. Mephisto also stirs up Gretchen’s brother, Valentin (played by William Dieterle, a man who went on to become a respectable director in his own right, making films such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame).\n\nValentin confronts Faust, but of course Mephisto does not rely on Faust, who is naturally squeamish about fighting his lover’s brother. Instead Mephisto treacherously murders Valentin, and treacherously runs down the street shouting ‘Murder!’ Faust makes his escape with Mephisto, and the dying Valentin condemns Gretchen as a harlot.\n\nThe story grows darker as the supposedly Christian congregation shun Gretchen at the funeral of her family members, and she is placed in the stocks. Holding the baby that she had from her dalliance with Faust, she seeks support from the local woman who refuse to help the disgraced maid.\n\nThe contrast between the half-crazed woman exposed to the snow while clutching her baby, and the choir singing about a child born at Christmas once more shows up the hollowness of a religion whose morality does not extend to supporting those most in need once they have fallen. Worse follows, and Faust realises too late that he has been betrayed by Mephisto and by his own desires: “Damn! Damn the delusion of youth!” cries the distraught alchemist.\n\nWhether Faust is able to save Gretchen or himself is something I will leave you to find out from watching the movie. The archangel tells Mephisto of: “The word that rings joyfully throughout creation, the word that alleviates every pain and sorrow, the word that absolves all the guilt of humanity, the eternal word.” The word is of course love. However love has also misled Faust and Gretchen. Will they be absolved or damned by love, and at what cost?\n\nI like to categorise the films that I blog about so that I can see if there are any genres which I am neglecting. Faust is a difficult film to place. It is not a full-on horror movie like F W Murnau’s most famous film, Nosferatu. However it contains much of the imagery of a horror film. It could also be labelled as a drama or a fantasy movie.\n\nThis confusion of labels reflects the complexity of the film, which crosses genres. The theology of the film is also ambiguous, perhaps more than was intended. However the artistry of Faust lies more in the brilliance of its imagery and style than in its attempt to present any specific message.\n\nThe movie uses religious language and representations, but perhaps we could see it more simply as being about the conflict between the nobler and darker sides of human nature, a central theme in Sunrise too. The archangel and demon are on one level the outer representations of an inner psychological struggle in the personality of Faust, and it is one that we too are fighting inside ourselves."
