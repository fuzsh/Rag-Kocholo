        "text": "ON May 25, 1913, Col. Alfred Redl, one of the most powerful intelligence agents in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, was found shot to death in Vienna, an apparent suicide. Why he did it remains almost as much of a mystery today as the deaths - at Mayerling in 1889 - of Crown Prince Rudolph and his mistress, Baroness Marie Vetsera. The Austro-Hungarian Empire may have been a wobbly political entity, but its functionaries were unbeatable at cover-ups.\n\nThe story of what MIGHT have prompted Redl's suicide is the subject of ''Colonel Redl,'' a new West German-Hungarian-Austrian co-production by Istvan Szabo, the Hungarian director whose ''Mephisto'' won the Oscar as best foreign language film of 1981. The film will be shown at the New York Film Festival today at 6:15 P.M. and tomorrow at 9:30 P.M., and opens Friday at the 57th Street Playhouse.\n\nConsidering all of the sensational possibilities of the mystery, ''Colonel Redl'' is a rather tame and perfunctory period melodrama. Like ''Mephisto,'' it has a lot more style - not all of it great - than substance. It features a good performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer (''Mephisto'') in the title role, and photography so fancily filtered that it recalls the kind of camerawork that might be called Early Art House. The mists of time, through which we see the story, are no longer metaphorical but as visibly thick as a fog in the London of Jack the Ripper.\n\nMr. Szabo and Peter Dobai, who collaborated on the screenplay, make no claim that their version of the Redl mystery is based on fact. Instead, they describe it as ''a work of fantasy,'' a film ''inspired'' by history as well as by John Osborne's play ''A Patriot for Me,'' which receives screen credit, though the film makers appear to be allergic to its wit.\n\nTheir fantasy is, in fact, an initially interesting one. It's their idea that Redl is a nearly perfect product of a corrupting, repressive social system. Born the son of an ordinary farmer, Redl very early begins to mold himself to meet the demands of that system. Being uncommonly bright and ambitious, he wins an appointment to an exclusive military academy where he hobnobs with the sons of the aristocracy.\n\nHe works hard to satisfy his superiors in the military and to acquire the manners required by society. Eventually, he even assumes an aristocratic background. As he rises in the ranks, he doesn't hesitate to inform on his friends, if it's to his advantage, and, until he moves out into the world, he rigorously denies his homosexuality. His first true love, which is apparently unconsummated, is for an aristocratic classmate. In the young man's place, he takes the young man's sister.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
