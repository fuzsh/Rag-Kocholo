In a sense, however, this was a predictable policy because, more so than any other artistic contributions to film, the soundtrack is supposed to be ignored—in order to most effectively manipulate your emotions. Thus, if you find yourself paying attention to the background music, that is usually a sign that either the movie is awful or the music is entirely wrong for the sequence it is underscoring. Still, there is one conspicuous exception to the rule, a unique talent whose major works are both extremely noticeable and utterly effective, and the man who unquestionably merits the status of the greatest science fiction film composer of all time. I am referring, of course, to Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nWhat's that, you say? You were expecting another name? Well, I'll mention that other fellow later, but for now, let me focus on the case for Goldsmith. His career commands attention, first of all, because of its breadth and its length. He began by working for television, contributing distinctive music to several episodes of The Twilight Zone, including his extensive, amazing efforts for the classic episode that entirely lacked dialogue, \"The Invaders.\" After he had left the series, his music was surely reused in more later episodes than the one episode (\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\") that I happen to know featured his recycled work. He moved on to other early science fiction series like Thriller, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, and The Man from U.N.CL.E., until John FRANKENHEIMER recruited him to accentuate the suspense of his grim near-future thrillers Seven Days in May and Seconds. He went on to a productive forty years of film work, usually at least one film score per year. But his first major triumph was his score for Planet of the Apes. As a teenager, when I saw the film for the first time, I was struck by the odd-sounding music that accompanied the opening scenes of the film, which was doing far more than the actors or director to convey that the astronauts had indeed landed in a strange, unsettling world full of grim surprises to come. He also had the wisdom to write absolutely no music at all for the film's final scene, fully recognizing that its stunning conclusion would have the greatest impact with nothing but the sounds of the ocean waves and Charlton HESTON's anguished scream.\n\nGoldsmith then became a film composer who regularly received major assignments, including several of the big-budget science fiction movies that became increasingly common in the 1970s, largely due to the success of the Goldsmith-scored Planet of the Apes. But an achievement that really stands out is his score for The Omen. Watching the rough cut, Goldsmith surely recognized that, despite the high-profile talents involved with the film, it was in fact an execrable mess, and the only possible solution would be some unusual, and unusually prominent, music to provide the needed aura of suspense and excitement that the film so obviously lacked. Skillfully employing a high-pitched vocal chorus to great effect, Goldsmith triumphed against impossible odds to make the movie a huge hit, paradoxically just about the only film around that is worth watching solely in order to listen to its score. An awestruck Academy gave Goldsmith his only Oscar for Best Original Score and even, bizarrely, nominated a ditty from Goldsmith's score named \"Ave Satani\" for Best Original Song.\n\nAt this point, with statuette in hand and a track record of proven success, Goldsmith should have become the most sought-after film composer in Hollywood. Unfortunately, there was at the time a trite, bombastic, overemphatic film composer named John WILLIAMS who had teamed up with a trite, bombastic, overemphatic director named Steven SPIELBERG to score a few big hits, inspiring everyone in Hollywood to want their next film to have a John Williams score. In these dire circumstances, Goldsmith then became the man you asked to create a John Williams score whenever John Williams wasn't available. The first major sign of this sad development was Goldsmith's work for Star Trek: The Motion Picture. True, the film did have a few touches of the old Goldsmith, like the ominously low-pitched tones that accompanied the immense alien spacecraft V'Ger, and true, the film's rousing theme music was regularly used in later films and the series Star Trek: The Next Generation, becoming the music most closely associated with the durable Star Trek franchise. (Indeed, as additional evidence of his genius, consider how often Goldsmith's music has been reused by later filmmakers who could well afford to commission original work—so that, long after his death, one must continue to update his filmography.) But, for the most part, the score for Star Trek: The Motion Picture was perfectly functional but unmemorable."
