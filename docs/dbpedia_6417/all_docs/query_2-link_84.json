        "text": "The Batman has finally been released, and I was thoroughly entertained by it. (No Spoilers in this review) It's probably the most like a Batman comic of any live action adaptation so far. Batman is finally a proper detective and the movie is very much a film noir. The cast was uniformly excellent. Zoe Kravitz and Colin Farrell are easily my favorite live action versions of Selina Kyle and The Penguin, I look forward to seeing more of both in the movies and on streaming shows. I wanted more of both Alfred and Commissioner Gordon, but they were also excellently realized, especially in their interactions with Bruce Wayne/Batman. Paul Dano was very effective as The Riddler, even if the character was a few steps too far away from his comic book counterpart for my taste. Robert Pattinson himself made for a great Batman, though his Bruce Wayne was missing the bored socialite act - but that is an element that can be explored in future installments, he's still perfecting his dual roles at this point. The fight choreography was very well done, you could actually see what was happening. Gotham looked fantastic and felt like a real place and the score was moody and thrilling. The Nirvana song worked, but we'll see how much it dates the movie like Prince's contributions to Batman '89 as the years pass. I didn't mind the 3 hour run time, though that may change with repeated viewings. I absolutely loved that we got a little bit of Batman voice over narration just like in the comics, and hope we get even more the next time around. The costume looked better onscreen than I had been expecting, and I look forward to seeing what upgrades he gets the next time around. I still miss the white eyes, but I don't know if we will ever get them with this ultra grounded version of the character. In fact, that's my only real quibble with the movie - it is so gritty and down to Earth, that I don't know how any of Batman's more fantastical foes like Man-Bat or Clayface could ever fit in here - let alone connecting it to a larger DCU with Superman and the Justice League and so forth. Matt Reeves has expressed interest in using Mr. Freeze, though, so maybe this world will broaden its comic book horizons going forward. Cant wait for it to hit HBO Max in 5 weeks so I can watch it again!"
