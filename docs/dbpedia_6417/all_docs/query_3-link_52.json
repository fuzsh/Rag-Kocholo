No withholding tax contributions, national tax contributions or social security tax contributions have to be paid.\n\nIn either case the 25% tax rebate applies.\n\nHungarian Taxes\n\nVAT currently applicable is 27% on most goods and services.\n\nVAT is fully recoverable on all goods and services of the production.\n\nHowever restaurant bills, fuel and taxis are excluded.\n\nNo taxes or fringes have to be paid on Hungarian crew, talent or extras – each individual is responsible for adhering to the relevant tax law.\n\nDefinition of eligible Hungarian Spend\n\nProduction expenditure as per the film’s registered budget. Spent by the Hungarian Production Company registered by the NMHH Film Office (“National Film Office”) and accounted for in its statutory tax books. Paid to Hungarian tax registered subcontractors (both companies and individuals).\n\nDefinition of eligible non-Hungarian Spend\n\nSame as above with the exception that it can be paid to any foreign (non-Hungarian) entity for costs material to the completion of the production. It is capped at 25% of the eligible Hungarian Spend.\n\nThe qualifying non-Hungarian expenses can be incurred in any country, any location. The non-Hungarian expenses are subject to the same qualifying rules as the Hungarian expenses.\n\nCompatibility with tax incentives of other countries\n\nBased on several years experience the Hungarian model can very effectively can work together with other countries’ tax credit, therefore the total benefit raised from the participating countries can reach a higher cash-back of the total budget.\n\nWhere do the funds come from?\n\nThe funds come from corporate sponsors, typically large companies with a significant Hungarian corporate income tax base, who are motivated by the tax incentives. Corporate sponsorship takes the form of a tax credit with a parallel tax base deduction.\n\nThe Hungarian National Film Fund pools these amounts together into their accounts. The production can directly contract with the National Film Fund to receive the rebate from them, for this they take a 2.5% fee of the rebate amount.\n\nResources\n\nResources & Services For Managing Your Hungarian Tax Rebate\n\nProcedure\n\nThe film needs to be registered at the Film Office. The registered Hungarian production company (can be an SPV) files the application at the Film Office and liaises with the authority.\n\nTo register the film 100% financing of the local (and in case of co-productions also the foreign) costs as detailed in the budget needs to be verified, apart from filing the script (Hungarian translation), the production schedule, financing plan, documentation on tax credit, PSA or co-production agreement. Documentation shall be filed within 30 days before the first shooting day in Hungary.\n\nThe NFO identifies the amount of tax credit based on the budget submitted the amount of tax credit the production will be able to receive.\n\nUpon completion of the production or after having finished a certain part of the production (either quarterly or monthly) an application for Tax Certificate is to be filed with the Film Office. The application needs to include the ledgers and other relating lists obtained from the accounting books of the applicant(s) and the supporting documents (eg.: contracts, bank statements, etc.). The audit is solely performed by the NFO based on the ledgers and books provided by the production company.\n\nAfter the NFO has concluded an audit of the submitted documentation, the final amount of the eligible Hungarian, and non-Hungarian spend is calculated and the rebate confirmed. NFO issues the Tax Certificate on the basis of the confirmed rebate amount.\n\nOn average the whole procedure from filing the application for the Tax Certificate until receiving fund from the tax payer sponsor takes approximately 50-90 days.\n\nMaximizing the 30% tax incentive\n\nThe Hungarian tax incentive is quite unique as it allows foreign spend to also qualify.\n\nIf we want to maximize the Hungarian tax incentive then it is optimal to spend the whole budget in a way that qualifies.\n\nThe optimal ratio is to maximize the foreign qualifying amount and spend 25% of the Hungarian Budget abroad, or 80% of the Budget in Hungary and 20% of the Budget abroad.\n\nORIGO FILM GROUP\n\nORIGO FILM GROUP"
