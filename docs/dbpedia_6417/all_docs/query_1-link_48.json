A welcome addition to Eureka! Entertainment’s ‘Masters of Cinema’ imprint, presenting the director’s early works from his audacious debut with János Vitéz / Johnny Corncob (1973) to his experimental and highly accomplished Fehérlófia / Son of the White Mare. Also taking in two arty shorts, Sisyphus (1974) and Küzdők / The Struggle (1977), and including Dreams on Wings (1968), an advertising feature made for Air India. Represented here is the development of his distinctive, dreamlike and graphically fluid style that shows influences drawn from traditional folk motifs fused with swinging sixties psychedelic pop art that, in turn, influenced the commercial graphics of the 1980s."
