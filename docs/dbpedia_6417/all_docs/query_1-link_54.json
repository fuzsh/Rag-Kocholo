        "text": "Dear Friends,\n\nHello from Budapest. These are not easy days. My family — already brimming with drama — has been struck by grief. I am grieving.\n\nI am grateful for the welcome distractions of work, be it this weekend digest, or all the wonderful conversations coming up on my platform, Interintellect.\n\nI will write more about my dad later, and the onslaught of feelings his illness and unexpected passing two days ago had brought to me. Adult life is just a temporary escape from frailty, that’s all.\n\nI have in fact written quite a bit about my family these past years, and the many ruptures that run throughout. I’ll leave you with one piece now to capture some of it, the impossibility, and nevertheless the hope, of it all: On Separation.\n\nAnd now, let’s read others! Since I’m back “home” in Budapest, I have collected some excellent Hungarian content for your erudition and pleasure. I hope you’ll enjoy it. Love x Anna\n\nThe Atomic Bomb Considered As Hungarian High School Science Fair Project\n\nThe joke was that this explained why the Manhattan Project was led by a group of Hungarian supergeniuses, all born in Budapest between 1890 and 1920. These included Manhattan Project founder Leo Szilard, H-bomb creator Edward Teller, Nobel-Prize-winning quantum physicist Eugene Wigner, and legendary polymath John von Neumann… The coincidences actually pile up beyond this. Von Neumann, Wigner, and possibly Teller all went to the same central Budapest high school at about the same time, leading a friend to joke about the atomic bomb being basically a Hungarian high school science fair project.\n\nBut maybe we shouldn’t be joking about this so much. Suppose we learned that Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach all had the same childhood piano tutor. It sounds less like “ha ha, what a funny coincidence” and more like “wait, who was this guy, and how quickly can we make everyone else start doing what he did?” In this case, the guy was Laszlo Ratz, legendary Budapest high school math teacher.\n\nScott Alexander\n\nMagda Szabó and the Cost of Censorship\n\n“I have come to realize that if I can’t bear to speak the truth even to you then I am beyond all help,” Eszter Encsy, the narrator of Magda Szabó’s 1959 novel, The Fawn, says…\n\nThe censors hounded [Szabó]. They hoped to splinter the New Moon group, hungry for the cultural legitimacy the writers’ acquiescence might lend the regime. Szabó claimed to have lost the will to write. She took a job teaching children. But, all the while, she was writing fiction, keeping it secret even from other New Moon writers.\n\nCharlie Lee; The New Yorker\n\nThe writer of our discontent: Remembering when a Hungarian staging of Richard III became a way to take on eastern Europe’s dictators\n\nRichard III was staged in Kaposvár which had the country’s very best theatre at the time. This was 1982. The superb actors wore camouflage military uniforms, and the action took place behind prison bars. At the end of the performance, Richmond’s speech was broadcast on closed-circuit television to the auditorium. A talented extra played the role of the obnoxious figure, but that wasn’t why charges were brought against the production, they were brought because the Earl of Richmond wore dark glasses. A few weeks earlier, on 13 December 1981, General Wojciech Jaruzelski declared a state of emergency in Poland. For health reasons he wore sunglasses every time he appeared in public. László Babarczi, the director of the play, was reprimanded. He defended himself by stating that the actor did not wear sunglasses.\n\nGyörgy Spiró; Index on Censorship\n\nJust divine: Nicholas Lezard is on a personal crusade after reading Journey by Moonlight, the compulsive page-turner by Antal Szerb\n\nI can't remember the last time I did this: finished a novel, and then turned straight back to page 1 to start it over again… The story, written in 1937, is of a bourgeois Hungarian businessman on holiday in Venice with his wife…\n\nI found out only after finishing it that Journey by Moonlight is the novel most loved by all cultivated Hungarians. Please believe me when I tell you that a cultivated Hungarian is about as cultivated as you can get while remaining in the presence of warmth and humanity.\n\nNicholas Lezard; The Guardian\n\nThis Nomadic Eccentric Was the Most Prolific Mathematician in History\n\nErdős was a notoriously bad house-guest. In Hoffman’s book, mathematician Michael Jacobson of the University of Colorado Denver recounts a story in which Erdős came to his home, and they worked on math until 1:00 A.M., when Jacobson finally succumbed to exhaustion. Erdős, who tended to put in 19-hour days, stayed up and, at 4:30 A.M., banged pots in the kitchen incessantly to wake up his host. Jacobson eventually teetered downstairs in his bathrobe. He described the ensuing interaction with his colleague to Hoffman: “What were the first words out of his mouth? Not ‘Good morning’ or ‘How’d you sleep?’ but ‘Let n be an integer.’”\n\nJack Murtagh; Scientific American\n\n‘Ben Hur,’ but Bigger and Better — Hungarian writer György Spiró’s newly translated novel ‘Captivity’ powerfully sets the perils of modern Jewry in Early Christian Rome\n\nThere is always something a little comic about historical fiction that enlists real personalities as characters. The comedy comes from the overdetermination: The only witness to life in Jewish Alexandria that we possess is Philo, the philosopher, and so it is inevitable for Uri to become Philo’s confidant. Likewise, no novel set in Judea in 33 CE is going to miss the chance to bring Jesus on stage, and Spiró does just that. Indeed, circumstances work out perfectly for Uri to be thrown in jail in the very same cell with Jesus and the two thieves on the eve of the crucifixion. But Spiró handles this episode with a light touch—Jesus goes unnamed, and it takes the reader a moment to realize that the middle-aged, balding, puffy prisoner is actually the Christian messiah. Uri himself doesn’t realize this until much later in the book, when the growing cult of “the Nazarenes” has turned Jesus into the Son of God. “I saw him! I spoke with him!” Uri tells his own son, Marcellus, who has converted to Christianity. “He was human just like you or me! … He was a man, a wretched, decent, and honest man like you or me!”\n\nAdam Kirsch; Tablet\n\nBook Review: Raise A Genius!\n\nI was hoping that this book would explain Lazslo Polgar’s secrets for raising gifted children. It does so only in very broad strokes. Nor does he seem to be holding much back. But it looks more like he doesn’t really have secrets, per se. The main things he does differently from everyone else are the things he’s talked about in every interview and documentary: he starts young (around the time the child is three), focuses near-obsessively on a single subject, and never stops.\n\nScott Alexander again\n\nAndy Grove: Refugee, Tech Pioneer And Immigrant Entrepreneur\n\n“I was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1936,” writes Grove in his memoir Swimming Across. “By the time I was 20, I had lived through a Hungarian fascist dictatorship, German military occupation, the Nazis’ ‘Final Solution,’ the siege of Budapest by the Soviet Red Army, a period of chaotic democracy in the years immediately after the war, a variety of repressive Communist regimes and a popular uprising that was put down at gunpoint.” …\n\nGrove’s contributions to America far exceed those whose careers or government positions have been devoted to preventing refugees like Grove from reaching the United States. In 1997, he was named Time magazine’s Man of the Year for being “the person most responsible for the amazing growth in the power and the innovative potential of microchips.” Grove died in 2016, but his life serves as an example of how America gains when it opens its doors.\n\nStuart Anderson; Forbes\n\n‘I shall hate her still’ — The twisted tale of a friendship soaked in enmity\n\nThe presence of the uncanny recurs in Szabó’s work. Occasionally, as in her later novel Katalin Street (1969; see TLS, May 29, 2020), this crosses over into the supernatural, but more often its presence is ambiguous, a feeling that something about a person or situation is indefinably wrong. The Door (1987), Szabó’s best-known novel, features an old woman with a peculiarly close bond to a dog. In The Fawn the impression is of a skewed fairy tale.\n\nNick Holdstock; Times Literary Supplement\n\nReview: In ‘1945,’ Hungarian Villagers Are Forced to Revisit Wartime Sins\n\nFerenc Torok’s lean, suggestive Hungarian feature, “1945,” shot in gorgeous, high-contrast black-and-white, is a Holocaust film built, consciously or not, on a reversal of the tropes of the western, down to ticking clocks that might as well be nearing high noon.\n\nBen Kenigsberg; The New York Times\n\nLászló Fehér\n\nCertain archetypal motifs constitute ongoing and recurring themes in his work, such as stairs, water and houses. Despite their mystical content, these motifs retain their everyday character and spontaneity. Although the dominant colours in his work have changed over the years, its unchanging essence, the message, is an intricate relationship between the human figure and its surroundings: emotionally complex, often visually shocking, and at once harmonious and disharmonious. Today, his works are found in many private and public collections, in Hungary and around the world.\n\nQ Contemporary\n\nThe Path to Autocracy\n\nAs Szabolcs Panyi, an investigative journalist, told me, Orbán can count on his propaganda machine reaching most Hungarians while constantly disparaging independent journalists. “You know,” he says, describing the playbook of delegitimizing objective reality, “there’s no facts, it’s just opinion, everything is partisan.” He says it’s a “psy-op” intended “to try to shift our focus from our work to what they are saying about us.”\n\nBen Rhodes; The Atlantic\n\nRobert Capa, the world's best-known war photographer had a passionate desire for peace\n\n\"It's not enough to have talent, you also have to be Hungarian\", said Robert Capa, the greatest war reporter in the history of photography, born as Endre Ernő Friedmann in Budapest. During his daring and adventurous life, he captured five wars from the firing line, and then, fulfilling his own destiny, lost his life on the battlefield…\n\nIn 1945, he returned to Paris, where he fell in love with Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman, whom he followed to Hollywood, where they lived together for two years. The actress was married and was ready to leave her husband for Capa, but the photographer refused to commit. Instead, in 1947, he and his fellow photographers, such greats as Henri Cartier-Bresson and William Vandivert, founded Magnum Photos, named after the champagne they drank when they founded it. It was the first cooperative agency of international freelance photographers, and Capa was finally able to photograph civilian life. He and John Steinbeck were the first American correspondents to travel to the Soviet Union beyond the Iron Curtain, and Steinbeck published a book about the trip, entitled A Russian Journal, richly illustrated with Capa's photographs.\n\nDr Adrián Szász; Képmás\n\nÁgota Kristóf's The Notebook awoke in me a cold and cruel passion\n\nThe Notebook tells the story of young twins living with their grandmother in a small Hungarian town during the last years of the second world war and the early years of communism. The twins are thoroughly immoral – they lie, blackmail, kill – yet they stand for authentic ethical naivety at its purest.\n\nSlavoj Žižek; The Guardian\n\nGloomy Sunday\n\n“Gloomy Sunday” is a song composed by Hungarian pianist and composer Rezső Seress and published in 1933, as “Vége a Világnak” (“End of the world”).\n\nIt became well known throughout much of the English-speaking world after the release of a version by Billie Holiday in 1941. Lewis’s lyrics referred to suicide, and the record label described it as the “Hungarian Suicide Song”. There is a recurring urban legend that claims that many people committed suicide with this song playing…\n\nThe BBC banned Billie Holiday’s version of the song from being broadcast, as being detrimental to wartime morale\n\nbillieholiday.com\n\nThe Philosophy of Anger\n\nMy parents decided to leave Hungary when the synagogue on our block was blown up. (After that, the Jews in the area went to my grandmother’s house to pray, secretly.) When we arrived in New York City, my parents pulled me out of public school after I was beaten up for wearing a necklace with a Star of David. They could not afford private school, but Orthodox Jewish elementary schools were willing to accept my sister and me for free, as charity cases. Why? Because the Holocaust, of course…\n\nAgnes Callard; Boston Review.\n\nThe Obsessive Fictions of László Krasznahorkai\n\nAscribing Krasznahorkai’s allure to plot is rarely fruitful; at best, the events are an armature over which the thickened material of consciousness can drape and flow. (Another of Krasznahorkai’s translators, the poet George Szirtes, has described his work as “a vast black river of type.”)\n\nDustin Illingworth; The Paris Review\n\nThe trauma doctor: Gabor Maté on happiness, hope and how to heal our deepest wounds\n\nWhen he was 11 months old, his mother sent him with a stranger to be cared for by his aunt. In the book, he quotes her diary from the time: “My dear little man,” she starts, explaining that she was forced to part with him because “your little organism could not possibly endure the living conditions [in the] fenced-in Budapest ghetto”.\n\nEllie Violet Bramley; The Guardian\n\nPolymorphous Adversity - Péter Nádas’s new novel explores the nexus of eros and politics\n\nNo one who has read Péter Nádas’s novel A Book of Memories (1997) will be surprised that the very first character introduced in Parallel Stories, a middle-aged man who happens to be a corpse, immediately becomes an object of desire: The male police officer investigating the scene sniffs the dead man’s penis in order to determine what kind of sex it might have recently had. Let’s pretend that he’s all business; “the secretion tests would provide exact details.” Meanwhile, the student who discovered the body—in Berlin, just after the dismantling of the wall—finds himself called upon by God to confess to the murder. He, too, feels sexually attracted to the dead man, and evidently also to the brown-eyed police investigator. “He could no more break free of the trusting pair of brown eyes than he could of the figure of the unknown corpse, the gentle, white, bladelike stripes of snow, the magical coolness of the discovery.”\n\nWilliam T. Vollmann; Bookforum\n\n”I always walk on the shadowy side of life” — One Woman in the War: Introduction\n\nBefore the publication of One Woman in the War in 1991, Alaine Polcz was widely recognized as a psychologist ministering to the needs of disturbed and incurably ill children and their families, as the author of numerous articles and several books on thanatology, and as the founder of the hospice movement in Hungary. To those who knew her through these dedicated engagements with death and the dying, the account of her experiences in the closing months of the Second World War was a revelation of past horrors in Hungary which, until then, had lingered on in the farthest reaches of the national memory as rumor and suspicion about the violent acts committed against women during a time of chaos, havoc, and savagery.\n\nCentral European University\n\nJust for kicks: how a kung-fu fighting female TV detective reshaped gender norms in the Eastern Bloc\n\nAs if militant feminism was yet another “exotic” notion to be exploited in a manner no different to kung-fu.\n\nYoana Pavlova; Calvert Journal\n\nThe Hungarian Ban on Gender Studies and its Implications for Democratic Freedom\n\nOn October 12, 2018, the Hungarian government officially removed Gender Studies Masters and PhD degrees from the list of accredited subjects in the country. The government also issued a decree rescinding the accreditation and funding for Gender Studies programs at two Hungarian universities, Eötvös Loránd University (a state-run school) and Central European University (also known as CEU), two of the top universities in the country…The Hungarian government did not provide any explanation for its action…\n\nBecky Prager; Harvard Journal of Law and Gender\n\nPieces of a Woman follows the course of child birth, death and remembrance\n\nPieces of a Woman is the Hungarian Mundruczó’s English-language debut. His earlier works, including the Cannes nominees White God (2014) and Johanna (2005), were altogether more slippery, more mysterious, more surreal. Pieces of a Woman feels more tonally aligned with the flinty realism of Kenneth Lonergan’s Manchester by the Sea, another Massachusetts-set film about a grieving parent.\n\nCatherine Wheatley; British Film Institute\n\nMarcel Breuer: the Bauhaus furniture master with a passion for architecture\n\nMarcel Breuer is famous for his tubular steel furniture, yet his real interest was architecture. For our Bauhaus 100 series, marking 100 years of the influential school, we profile the Hungarian designer who championed a rational approach to design…\n\nJon Astbury; Dezeen\n\nMagyars in the Movies\n\nCasablanca (1942) … Adolf Zukor was one of the architects of the Hollywood film industry. Born to a Jewish family in rural Hungary, he was just 15 when he lost both of his parents, then subsequently emigrated to America and made his fortune in the fur business. In 1903 he started a venture with Marcus Loew for a new chain of movie theaters. In 1912 he established Famous Players, which evolved over time into Paramount Pictures…\n\nFunzine\n\nA Review of: Detective Story by Imre Kertesz\n\nIn 1975, thirty years after his liberation from a concentration camp, the Hungarian author Imre Kertész published his first novel, Sorstalanság, which has been translated into English as both Fateless and Fatelessness. Whichever you prefer—I like Fatelessness, personally—it’s one of those destined-to-be-a-classic books against which everything else he writes, including Liquidation, Kaddish for an Unborn Child, and his newly translated Detective Story, will forever be contrasted. That it took him three decades to compose his masterpiece and so matter-of-factly describe a Holocaust-era childhood should come as no surprise. But what can any artist really say about our greatest human atrocities that isn’t self-evident? Both Fatelessness and Detective Story reveal that the answer, for Kertész, has something to do with fate—and the lack thereof…\n\nAndrew Ervin; The Believer\n\nThe Siege of Budapest: One Hundred Days in World War II — Review\n\nBy the time the city came under attack in December 1944, the highest drama had already passed. As the front had moved closer to Hungary earlier in the year, the government, in the person of Regent Miklós Horthy, tried to open channels of negotiation with the Western Allies. The Germans responded by clamping down on their wavering ally, occupying the entire country. Not coincidentally they also rounded up, deported and murdered most of the Hungarian Jewry, until that moment the last national Jewish community of any size still extant in Nazi-occupied Europe. Then, in October 1944, the Horthy government actually tried to abandon the Axis and take Hungary out of the war. The Germans again responded quickly, arresting the regent within hours…\n\nHistoryNet\n\nThe Round-Up (Miklós Jancsó, Hungary 1966)\n\nIn fact, the power of the state is so complete that even the tantalizing openness of nature is illusory. If anyone makes a break for it, there is literally nowhere to hide.\n\nHamish Ford; Senses of Cinema\n\nCanadian Psychologist Who Used LSD Forty Years Ago Permanently Barred from Entering U.S.\n\nAndrew Feldmar, a psychologist who has worked for the UN to help Chernobyl victims, was accustomed to traveling to the U.S. five or six times a year to visit his children, according to a story this week in the Tyee, an independent Canadian newspaper. But when a border guard pulled the 66-year-old out of line last summer for a random search, Feldmar's trip quickly turned into a bad one. The guard turned up online evidence that Feldmar had dabbled in drugs for therapeutic research in the past. Of course, that was nearly four decades ago. And everyone was high then.\n\nLuke O’Brien; WIRED\n\nWe Made It: The Bogányi Piano\n\nIs there no way the sound can ever be improved? That is the possibility which has gnawed away at Hungarian concert pianist Gergely Bogányi for years. “The imagination of a musician is always at a higher level than the actual sound,” he explains. “The notes coming out of pianos were always different to the ones in my head.” His great compatriot Franz Liszt was always worrying away about improving sound quality, so it was a great surprise to Bogányi when he had a chance to play on Liszt’s piano, which is housed in a museum in Budapest. “I was quite shocked. That was the sound was much warmer and a more human sound than the modern pianos.” It was much closer to the sound he heard in his imagination when playing. But unfortunately those older pianos are simply too brittle to withstand the barrage of a modern concert performance. Then about ten years ago Bogányi started talking in earnest to a piano technician.\n\nJasper Rees; The Arts Desk\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nEmail me at anna@interintellect.com.\n\nAttend our public online salons here.
