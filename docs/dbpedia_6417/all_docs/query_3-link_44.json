        "text": "In the past decade, Hungary has grown from a peripheral destination of Hollywood runaway productions into the second biggest European filming location. At the same time, after decades of absence from the domestic and international scenes, local productions have made a return, filling national cinemas and winning prestigious international awards. This article investigates the development of Hollywood runaway production in socialist and post-socialist Hungary. On the macro level, it explores how political and economic tendencies, together with individual agents' networks, affected local industries and Hollywood runaway production from the 1960s to the present. On the micro level, the article looks at Hungarian crew members' self-perceptions and professional identity formation. Doing so, the article strives to reveal the possible links between the two tiers and the effect of wage-work on domestic production.\n\nThe book explores east-central European media industries (namely those of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary) through the lived realities of producers as key initiators, facilitators, and cultural intermediaries. Based on a broad set of in-depth interviews, it looks closely at how their agency is circumscribed by the limited scale and peripheral positioning of the markets in which they operate, and how they struggle to come to terms with these constraints through their business strategies, creative thinking and professional self-perceptions. Each of the seven chapters discusses a specific producer type and area of producer practice: independent producers circumscribed by the smallness and/or peripherality of their home markets; a prominent arthouse producer who managed to overcome the limits of the peripheral market; the ‘service producers’ working on large Western projects in Prague and Budapest, vitally dependent on financial incentives introduced by their national governments; the ‘minority co-production’ that serves national policymakers as a measure of internationalizing local producers and gaining more festival recognition; in-house producers of public service television, whose agency is limited by the broadcast organization; the regional operation of HBO Europe, which uses original local content production as a vehicle of its transnational corporate strategy; and finally, short-form online video production, which is an extremely diverse and volatile field, but promises dynamic growth in the era of mobile, ‘procrastination’ viewing. However diverse, all these cases illustrate how producers in east-central Europe are affected by and act upon the transformative forces of digitalization, globalization and Europeanization.\n\nThis paper explores how the (social) aesthetics of film noir envelop the politics of space, violence, and social paranoia in Central European film in the second half of the twentieth century. Does violence always carry an element of spectacularity, or is there a more silent, more indirect violence inherent in systems of repression, mobilizing specific traits of psychological response? By looking at emblematic examples of the Hungarian and Czech (oslovak) film-production of the second half of the twentieth century, I will try to argue that a specific sense of tragedy, the haunting spectacularity of latent violence and the technics of ideology are constitutive elements of modern urban realism not only in the American hard-boiled tradition, but also in a Central European context, especially as regards the entanglement of politics, power, and social paranoia.\n\nThis chapter examines the ways in which Eastern European cinema has become Europeanized. It looks at how the idea of Eastern Europe and its cinema has been shaped vis-à-vis the West, and redefined after the collapse of communism. Contrary to the received wisdom that a new paradigm emerged in 1989, this chapter argues that it is only since 2000 that Eastern European cinema has enjoyed recognition after the near collapse of its film industries in the 1990s. In the three case studies of the Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr, Eastern European female directors and the Romanian New Wave, the chapter analyses the emergence in Eastern Europe of a new complex model of film production aligned with its larger European counterpart. This producer-driven model is based on three further aspects: the national film institutes, international co-productions and participation in film festivals."
