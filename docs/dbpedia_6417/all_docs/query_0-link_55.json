        "text": "Watching Hungarian movies is a great way to learn the language. Hearing native speakers use the language in various contexts will help you get used to certain phrases and patterns as well as familiarize you with colloquial Hungarian—both of which are very important for your future conversations with locals.\n\nAnother benefit of using movies to supplement your Hungarian studies is that it doesn’t feel like studying at all! And that’s the key to language learning: making the process enjoyable. This allows you to learn much faster and with ease because studying will no longer feel like a burden.\n\nFor this article, we’ve collected ten of the top Hungarian movies that you must see. These films will not only help you grasp the language in natural contexts, but also give you a better understanding of Hungarian culture.\n\n→ Before we dive into our Hungarian movies list, we wanted to mention that we also have a lesson series on the Top 10 Hungarian Films and Filmmakers. Feel free to check it out!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe Witness – A tanú (1969)\n\nMephisto – Mephisto (1981)\n\nSunshine – A napfény íze (1999)\n\nGlass Tiger – Üvegtigris (2001)\n\nA Kind of America – Valami Amerika (2002)\n\nMade in Hungaria – Made in Hungária (2009)\n\nFor Some Inexplicable Reason – Van valami furcsa és megmagyarázhatatlan (2014)\n\nSon of Saul – Saul fia (2015)\n\nThe Citizen – Az állampolgár (2016)\n\nSing – Mindenki (2016)\n\nHow HungarianPod101.com Can Help You Reach Your Full Potential\n\n1. The Witness – A tanú (1969)\n\nIMDb rating: 8.7 / 10\n\nThis old Hungarian movie, directed by Péter Bacsó, is a must-watch if you’re interested in the history of Hungary. The satirical piece was banned for ten years before its official release in 1969 because of its criticism of the Communist regime in Hungary after World War II. Its censorship illustrates how important this Hungarian movie is in context of the nation’s history. Given its release date, you’ll likely hear a few expressions that are no longer used in everyday Hungarian speech.\n\nThe story is about József Pelikán, a dike-keeper who commits a silly crime—slaughtering his pig—for which he is not sentenced but rather elevated into a serious position that was reserved for the Communist regime. Although he does not understand why this happened, he is later called in to falsely testify against his good old friend at a trial as a favor for the regime that “saved him” from doing time in prison.\n\nCurious what kind of language and dialogue you can expect to hear while watching? Here’s a sample of dialogue from the film:\n\nBástya:\n\nMi ez?\n\n“What’s this?”\n\nPelikán:\n\nEgy narancs.\n\n“An orange.”\n\nBástya:\n\nEgy narancs?\n\n“An orange?”\n\nPelikán:\n\nAz új magyar narancs. Kicsit sárgább, kicsit savanyúbb*, de a miénk.\n\n“The new Hungarian orange. It’s slightly yellower, it’s slightly sharper*, but our own.”\n\n*While this is the original Hungarian transcription, do keep in mind that “sharper” literally translates to élesebb (not savanyúbb, which means something along the lines of “sour”).\n\n2. Mephisto – Mephisto (1981)\n\nIMDb rating: 7.8 / 10\n\nOne of the best Hungarian movies of all time is surely Mephisto, directed by István Szabó and starring Klaus Maria Brandauer alongside many other great Hungarian actors.\n\nThis Hungarian film is set in 20th-century Germany, and it’s about a stage actor named Hendrik Höfgen who wants to become well-known and have a successful career. His biggest goal is to play the part of Mephisto. However, desperation to see his dream finally come true drives him to collude with the Nazis. The party offers him the fame he always wanted and he accepts the offer—but at what cost?\n\nHere’s a quote from the film:\n\nNem én vagyok a legrémisztőbb gonosztevő, akit valaha láttál?\n\n“Am I not the most dreadful villain you have seen?”\n\n3. Sunshine – A napfény íze (1999)\n\nIMDb rating: 7.5 / 10\n\nSunshine debuted in 1999 and is one of the most popular Hungarian drama movies, telling the story of a Hungarian Jewish family in the 20th century. This film has played a large role in Hungarian culture since its release, so if you’re thinking about watching Hungarian movies online, this one should definitely be on your list!\n\nLike Mephisto, this Hungarian movie was also directed by István Szabó. The story follows three generations of a Hungarian Jewish family; viewers witness their successes, the horrors they face during the Holocaust, and how the 1956 revolution affects them.\n\nWe especially recommend this film for beginners, as the original audio is in English. By watching the film with Hungarian subtitles, you can more easily pick up new words, broaden your vocabulary, and become more familiar with Hungarian history and culture.\n\nHere’s a quote from the film:\n\nAz antiszemitizmus bosszús és sikertelen emberek hitvallása…a filiszteusok filozófiája. Ízléstelen.\n\n“Anti-semitism is a creed of resentful and unsuccessful people…the philosophy of Philistines; it’s in bad taste.”\n\n4. Glass Tiger – Üvegtigris (2001)\n\nIMDb rating: 7.7 / 10\n\nThe Hungarian movie Glass Tiger is a comedy that could be considered the “visual anthem” of the nation (alongside A Kind of America, which we’ll introduce in a bit as well). It was partially directed by Péter Rudolf, who also starred in the movie alongside Gábor Reviczky and József Szarvas.\n\nThe story is about six good friends who normally live very boring lives. In the film, however, they encounter quite a handful of interesting situations. The ‘Üvegtigris’ (a buffet truck that the character Lali owns) is at the heart of the whole movie.\n\nHere’s a recurring sentence that, because of this Hungarian film, became a famous catchphrase in the Hungarian language:\n\nÍzirájder, öcsém, ízirájder!\n\n“Easy rider, bro’, easy rider.”\n\nThe guys in the film use this phrase to describe a “laid-back dude” or some loser that “copies Americans.”\n\n5. A Kind of America – Valami Amerika (2002)\n\nIMDb rating: 6.9 / 10\n\nOur list of the top Hungarian movies could never be complete without A Kind of America, which is a prime example of the typical Hungarian comedy movie.\n\nThe film follows the story of an up-and-coming film director named Tamás, who lives in Budapest. He has a great idea for a film, but lacks the money to make his dream come true. One day, an American film producer reaches out to Tamás and praises him for the script he’s written—Tamás sees this as a grand opportunity and, with the help of his two brothers, tries to impress the producer once they meet in person. But it’s not such an easy task, after all…\n\nThe cast of this film includes several famous Hungarian actors and actresses, such as Győző Szabó, Ferenc Hujber, Szonja Oroszlán, and Claudia Liptai. If you would like to perfect your language skills—and pick up some slang too, of course—by watching a silly and humorous Hungarian movie, this film should be at the top of your list!\n\nHere’s a quote from the movie that’ll make you smile:\n\nOlyan vagyok, mint a spanyolnátha. Bárki megkaphat.\n\n“I’m like the Spanish flu. Anybody can get me.”\n\n6. Made in Hungaria – Made in Hungária (2009)\n\nIMDb rating: 6.9 / 10\n\nAmong the best films to learn Hungarian is Made in Hungaria, a lively musical with a captivating plot, charming characters, and songs you’re going to love. Regarding the language of the film, the vocabulary is nowhere near as rough as that of Üvegtigris or Valami Amerika, for example. There are a couple of curse words and a little bit of slang, but these aspects of the language do not feature prominently in the film.\n\nMiki and his parents return to Communist Hungary in the 1960s after living in America for some time. He finds it hard to assimilate at first, as even his old friends don’t know what to make of his new style and personality. Throughout the story, we can see Miki (who happens to be a young musician) trying to win over his childhood love, Vera, and to make his old friends trust and like him again—all while getting ready to participate in a talent show.\n\nSeveral famous actors feature in this film, including Tamás Szabó Kimmel, Iván Fenyő, and Péter Scherer.\n\nNow, for some sample dialogue:\n\nMiki’s mom:\n\nJesszus, miért vagy vizes?\n\n“Jesus, why are you wet?”\n\nMiki:\n\nÚtközben megáztam.\n\n“I got wet on my way home.”\n\nMiki’s mom:\n\nDe hát nem is esett!\n\n“But it didn’t even rain!”\n\nMiki:\n\nAhol én voltam, igen.\n\n“It did where I was.”\n\nMiki’s dad:\n\nA Tűzoltó utcában, ugye?\n\n“In Tűzoltó street*, right?”\n\n*Tűzoltó street is located in Budapest.\n\nMiki:\n\nHonnan tudod? Valaki beköpött?\n\n“How do you know? Did somebody rat me out?”\n\nMiki’s dad:\n\nEz Magyarország. Itt mindenki tud mindent.\n\n“This is Hungary. Everybody knows everything.”\n\n7. For Some Inexplicable Reason – Van valami furcsa és megmagyarázhatatlan (2014)\n\nIMDb rating: 7.5 / 10\n\nThis is one of the more recent Hungarian movies, written and directed by Gábor Reisz. It has won eight awards in total, including the Adolph Zukor Prize at the Jameson CineFest and the Best Feature Film at FEST New Directors/New Films Festival.\n\nThe film tells the story of Áron, a nerdy guy who is about to turn thirty but is recently single, unemployed, and lacking any kind of purpose in life. In search of meaning and excitement, he buys a ticket to Lisbon and flies there to find himself. The film depicts the truth of what it’s like to be a young professional and what hardships one must encounter throughout their life.\n\nQuote:\n\nHihetetlen, hogy a rossz dolgokat mindenki elhiszi, ami jó, az meg állandóan magyarázatra szorul.\n\n“It’s unbelievable how everybody believes the bad things, but the good ones always need to be explained.”\n\n8. Son of Saul – Saul fia (2015)\n\nIMDb rating: 7.5 / 10\n\nWe had to include this one on our list of the top Hungarian movies. It’s quite possibly the most famous Hungarian film nowadays, having won an Oscar as well as 62 other prizes. The film, directed by László Nemes Jeles and featuring the acting talent of Géza Röhrig, even had a screening at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film shows just two days of the main character’s (Saul’s) life. He is a Jewish Hungarian captive in Auschwitz who tries to have a boy, believed to be his son, buried properly by a rabbi. He refuses to join the others in a rebellion they’re planning, choosing instead to save the remains of the child as he feels guilty for not having taken care of him while he was still alive.\n\nWatching this Hungarian film will give you a glimpse into the horrors that took place in Auschwitz.\n\nHere’s some sample dialogue from the film:\n\nAbraham:\n\nCserben hagytad az élőket a halottért.\n\n“You failed the living for the dead.”\n\nSaul:\n\nMár halottak vagyunk.\n\n“We are dead already.”\n\n9. The Citizen – Az állampolgár (2016)\n\nIMDb rating: 7.2 / 10\n\nOne of the latest Hungarian movies to debut, this film touches on sensitive topics related to immigration practices and refugees in Hungary.\n\nIt depicts the life of an African-American man in his fifties who has been living in Hungary as a refugee, but would like to acquire Hungarian citizenship. To achieve this goal, he studies a lot for exams and even learns the language, trying to assimilate into the culture. However, his journey is not easy as he constantly encounters racist people and those who do not trust or believe in him.\n\nThe main character’s charm lies in the fact that the part is played by an amateur actor—Dr. Cake-Baly Marcelo—who’s a former refugee in real life and currently a resident of Budapest.\n\nThis movie is perfect for language learners because there’s a person on-screen they can relate to: somebody who’s trying to learn a new, rather challenging language. In the film, you can see that effort matters and that the path to mastering a language is through trial and error. Plus, you can try to understand Wilson’s lines without English subtitles (although Netflix does provide them).\n\n→ Psst…speaking of language learning struggles, when was the last time you checked your knowledge? See our page Quick & Easy Hungarian Review for Beginners to figure out where you stand!\n\nHere’s a quote you’ll hear in the film:\n\nHazádnak rendületlenül légy híve, óh magyar!\n\n“To your homeland, without fail be faithful, oh Hungarian.”\n\nThis is the first line of Szózat, a Hungarian patriotic song written by Mihály Vörösmarty. It happens to be the second most important one, after the national anthem (Himnusz).\n\n10. Sing – Mindenki (2016)\n\nIMDb rating: 8.1 / 10\n\nLast but definitely not least, here’s a short Hungarian film that conveys a wonderful message.\n\nThe story is based on a true event and set in Budapest in the 1990s. It follows an award-winning children’s choir and questions certain pedagogical methods. When a new girl joins the school choir, she slowly discovers the truth behind why the group became famous in the first place. This Hungarian film is less than half an hour long, but it will surely leave you speechless.\n\nQuote:\n\nHa mindenki szót fogad, mindenkinek jó lesz.\n\n“If everybody obeys, it’s going to be good for everybody.”\n\n11.

Have you seen any of the films on our list already?\n\nWatching TV shows is a great way to learn a language, and Hungarian is no exception. For some people, it’s rather hard to find the motivation to sit down at a desk and open a language book. If you happen to be one of them, you’re going to love this article. We’re presenting you with the best Hungarian TV shows to help you study the language in a highly efficient way, without feeling like you’re actually studying. Sometimes tricking your brain is the way to go.\n\nWith the help of Hungarian TV series, you’ll be able to pick up slang words and detect any slang that’s being used in a conversation when you’re visiting Hungary. Of course, it depends on the kind of show you’re watching, but most of them use shortened language (slang), i.e. how people of a given nation actually use their language in their daily lives.\n\nFor this reason, it might be a bit challenging to improve your Hungarian by watching TV shows as you might come across words that aren’t in the dictionary. Instead, in such cases, you’ll have to rely on your instincts and try to master “reading from context” so that when you guess what the characters are saying, you actually succeed. We’re not going to lie: it takes practice. But the good thing is that practice here means watching Hungarian TV channels.\n\nWatching TV shows of a given language is not only helpful for learning new phrases and vocabulary, but also for picking up expressions. For example, you can easily start to detect how Hungarians use body language and facial expressions when speaking. Do you see any gestures they’re often making when they say a certain sentence? Do they get angry or happy if they hear a given word or phrase? Do they articulate much or murmur under their nose? How does their face change when they say specific words or phrases? You can learn so much by watching Hungarian TV!\n\nOkay, okay, but what are the best TV shows to learn Hungarian? Well, we’ve got you covered. We’ll introduce you to ten of the best Hungarian TV shows, and will even tell you how to stream Hungarian TV (legally, of course).\n\nWe hope you’re ready to study the fun way. Take a look at what we have for you and decide which show interests you the most.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAnimations\n\nSitcoms / Dramas\n\nTalk / Reality Shows\n\nHungarianPod101.com Gives You the Best Ideas to Make Studying Fun\n\n1. Animations\n\nShow #1: Mézga család (The Mézgas) — 1968\n\nIf you’re interested in old Hungarian TV shows, this is definitely worth a watch!\n\nThis show follows the Mézga family. Their thirteen-year-old boy, Aladár, is a genius. He creates gadgets and machines that make even time travel and travel through space possible. His family, however, often gets into trouble because they don’t know how to use these machines properly. Thus, Aladár always has to save his family.\n\nHis best friend and constant companion on his journeys is his dog, Blöki. Other members of the family include his stubborn and strict father, Géza Mézga, who doesn’t really approve of Aladár’s machines. His mother, born Paula Rezovits, often faints on their exciting journeys due to her poor nervous system. Aladár often fights with his not-so-bright sister, Kriszta, who has a pet cat named Maffia.\n\nThe story is built around these six characters and their spectacular journeys, though some episodes feature their angry neighbor, Máris. It also features, in speech only, Pisti Hufnágel, who used to be one of Paula’s past lovers. She often voices her regret of not marrying him instead of Géza.\n\nThis is one of the best Hungarian TV shows, though it’s not aired anymore. For this reason, you can only stream it; you can’t catch an episode of Mézga család if you’re watching Hungarian satellite TV. Since this Hungarian series is rather old, you’ll find that the slang the characters use is a bit outdated. This can be both a positive and negative aspect of watching this show.\n\nThrough watching this series, you won’t learn lots of slang, but rather the usual way that Hungarian works. Also, given its time of creation, you’ll probably be able to understand the speakers better, as the characters don’t speak as fast as people do these days.\n\nRecurring Sentences in the Show\n\nAnya, szólj rá!\n\n“Mom, rebuke him.”\n\nKriszta says this when Aladár is annoying her.\n\nMiért nem a Hufnágel Pistihez mentem feleségül?\n\n“Why didn’t I marry Pisti Hufnágel?”\n\nThis sentence leaves Paula’s mouth in every episode. In the Hungarian version, the a (meaning “the” ) before the name Hufnágel Pisti is grammatically incorrect. You’re not supposed to say “the” before names, but that’s how people do it in Budapest and the surrounding areas, as well as in some Transdanubian places.\n\nShow #2: A nagy ho-ho-horgász (The Great Fisherman) — 1982\n\nThe persevering fisherman (horgász) and his best friend, Chief Worm (Főkukac), are the main characters of one of the best Hungarian TV series. There’s nothing better than sitting at the breezy waterside on hot summer days. Our protagonist does the same and, in the meantime, gets himself involved in unexpected adventures.\n\nFor him, it doesn’t matter if it’s summer or winter. On cold days, he fishes from rooftops and chimneys, and out of bathtubs, aquariums, and even fountains. Nothing stops him and his little friend from having a good time fishing.\n\nYou can expect the same kind of language exposure from this show as you can from Mézga család. It’s an old cartoon, but one of the best Hungarian children’s TV shows.\n\nRecurring Sentences in the Show\n\nÉn fogtam ki a világ legjobb szívű halacskáját! Ez is világcsúcs!\n\n“I got to fish a little fish with the biggest heart. This is a world record, too.”\n\nMegőrülök! Ez még a maradék halat is elriasztja! Ilyen tehetségtelen csalival kell nekem horgásznom!\n\n“I’m going crazy. He scares away even the remaining fishes. And I have to work with such untalented bait.”\n\n2. Sitcoms / Dramas\n\nIf you want to watch Hungarian drama online, RTL Most and TV2.hu are going to be your best friends. These are the sites to check out even if you want to watch free Hungarian live TV online. Your favorite Hungarian television shows are only a few clicks away.\n\nShow #3: Jóban rosszban (In Good and Bad) — 2005\n\nThe story of this Hungarian TV show is set in Csillagkút, a village not far from the capital of Hungary, Budapest. Life in this little village suddenly becomes quite lively after everyone starts talking about the Csillagvirág Clinic and its mysterious director, Péter Pongrácz (played by Tibor Gazdag, a great Hungarian actor and composer in real life). All that the residents of the village know about him is that he left his perfect life in the USA behind to come home to Hungary and open a private clinic in Csillagkút.\n\nEverybody is happy that the old castle has been transformed into a new hospital…well, almost everybody. Előd Várnagy had different intentions for the castle, but Péter beat him to it.\n\nLove stories, cheating, betrayals: these are all parts of everyday life at the Csillagvirág Clinic. Although the characters are willing to betray and even kill each other—and they do—some of them are willing to support one another…in good and bad.\n\nBy watching this series, you’ll be exposed to all kinds of language. You’ll encounter healthcare terminology as well as everyday expressions, including day-to-day conversations and slang. Thus, this is the perfect Hungarian TV series for you if you love drama and are open to learning Hungarian in a fun way.\n\nImportant Sentences in the Show\n\nEgyet jegyezz meg! A szerelem elmúlik… de a férfiak ostobasága soha!\n\n“Remember one thing. Love fades away…but the stupidity of men never does.”\n\nA kudarc kell. A siker elkényelmesít, de a kudarc megtanít megbocsátani, és megmutatja, hogy kik és mennyire fontosak az életünkben.\n\n“Failure is needed. Success makes you too comfortable, but failure teaches you to forgive and shows you who the important people in your lives are, and how much.”\n\nShow #4: Barátok közt (Amongst Friends) — 1998\n\nThis one is an oldie but a goldie, and is a must-watch for Hungarian learners who want to experience popular Hungarian TV shows.\n\nThe main characters of this Hungarian TV show are the members of the Berényi family. This show has been following their everyday lives, and that of those living around them, for more than twenty years now.\n\nThe story starts with a bunch of kids who become really good friends. Later on in their lives, they end up living in the same block of flats, which is something they never would have thought. Their aim is to create modern mansions and a good community in the building where they first met as children. However, betrayals, hook-ups, and other surprising events make this seem like a rather hard thing to do.\n\nThis Hungarian TV show is perfect for you if you love drama, complicated relationships, and excitement.\n\nIn some cases, you can access the episodes on Hungarian TV channels online. Barátok közt is one of them. Just go to RTL Most (RTL Now) and you can stream all 20+ years’ worth of Barátok közt episodes right away.\n\nPopular Quotes from the Series\n\nAz emlékek megszépítik a múltat.\n\n“Memories make the past seem more beautiful.”\n\nNincs szeretet elfogadás nélkül.\n\n“There is no love without acceptance.”\n\nAkár aggódsz, akár nem, az a dolgokon nem változtat.\n\n“Whether you worry or not, that does not change things.”\n\nEgy férfinak minden helyzetben kell, hogy legyen terve.\n\n“A man must have a plan in all situations.”\n\nA szerelem vak, és ez csak addig közhely, amíg a saját bőrünkön nem tapasztaljuk meg.\n\n“Love is blind and it is a cliché only until you experience it on your own skin.”\n\nWhich quote is your favorite?\n\nShow #5: Válótársak (Divorce Buddies) — 2015\n\nBálint, Dávid, and Joci are best friends. Not only do they live together in their mancrib, but all three of them are going through a divorce. The show follows their lives through this process.\n\nBálint has cheated on his wife, Zsófi, so she files for divorce. Bálint is trying to get Zsófi back and ruin her forming relationship with his brother. However, Bálint can’t restrain himself and keeps cheating on Zsófi with other women.\n\nDávid, a rich entrepreneur, has been dumped after six years of marriage because his wife, Tamara, found him boring. Dávid gets a heart attack because of this, and he soon falls in love with his doctor, Dalma. While trying to win Dalma over, he’s in constant war with his ex. However, the stricter and harsher Dávid is with Tamara, the more she finds him interesting and wants him back.\n\nJoci and Szonja have been trying to have a child for ages, but couldn’t succeed. As soon as they decide to break up, Szonja gets pregnant with twins. Joci is trying to escape the father role, so he even hires a lawyer, Leonóra, whom he soon starts to date and build a new relationship with. But Szonja isn’t going to let the love of her life be anybody else’s.\n\nThis is definitely one of those Hungarian TV programs that you can’t miss if you want to have a good laugh. It’s quite popular in Hungary, largely due to the fact that one of the main characters, Bálint, is played by the famous Hungarian actor András Stohl.\n\nRegarding the language of the show, you might want to be careful, as this series is explicit and features intercourse and similar 18+ (or 16+) content. So, there you have it: if you want to learn Hungarian curse words and slang while having heaps of laughter, this is definitely the show to watch.\n\nFamous Quote from the Show\n\nCsak az első hiba számít, a többi az következmény.\n\n“Only the first mistake matters. The rest is the consequences.”\n\nShow #6: Jófiúk (Good Boys) — 2019\n\nThis comedy is one of the newer TV shows in Hungarian and is a big hit nowadays in Hungary, alongside Válótársak.\n\nJófiúkis is a Hungarian TV series about a group of clumsy policemen who cause more problems than they solve. Gyula, a very unmotivated policeman, and his team are mistakenly relocated to the most ructious part of the city. On their first day, the team has already had to deal with a dead body, meanwhile Gyula and his family struggle with the new neighborhood.\n\nThis series is also explicit, but very funny at the same time. So, the same “rules” apply to this one as to Válótársak. If you want to have a good laugh and study Hungarian slang, you might want to consider watching this Hungarian TV show.\n\nFamous Quote from the Show\n\nSzolgálunk és védünk.\n\n“We serve and protect.”\n\nThis is the slogan of the Hungarian police.\n\nShow #7: A tanár (The Teacher) — 2018\n\nThis series gives an inside view of the lives of high-schoolers and their community. The episodes feature social issues such as adoption, search for identity, and rivalry amongst students. Each episode introduces the life of a student and their problems.\n\nThe main character is Szilárd, a chemistry, physics, and P.E. teacher (played by Ervin Nagy, who is rather famous in Hungary and also appears in theater plays). He tries to help the children in the school in his own way, which often puts a humorous spin on the show.\n\nThis series is worth watching for its interpretation of social issues and their take on them. The channel that airs this Hungarian TV show is RTL Klub, so if you’re interested in it, and you’re all for streaming Hungarian TV, you can easily watch this series on RTL Most.\n\nPreparing for a Hungarian language exam is really no different than preparing for any other language exam. However, in the case of Hungarian, you might want to pay special attention to spelling, as the way Hungarians write and pronounce words differs greatly at times. Therefore, you might want to do as many mock tests regarding Hungarian grammar as you can. And we think A tanár is a great way to experience this first-hand.\n\nFamous Quote from the Show\n\nIsten hozott a birodalmamban.\n\n“Welcome to my empire.”\n\nThis is the first sentence, with which the main character, Szilárd, greets his students.\n\nShow #8: 200 első randi (200 First Dates) — 2018\n\nThis is one of the best TV series for learning Hungarian.\n\nIt’s a witty, funny, and emotional story that follows the everyday life of a thirty-year-old woman, Luca, who’s a bit clumsy and disorganized.\n\nHer sister’s engagement came as a great surprise to this single lady, and their mother makes bitter remarks on the fact that her sister will marry sooner than Luca, and that she’ll probably go to the wedding without a partner. Because of this, Luca swears that she will find The One in 200 days, meanwhile trying to live up to the expectations of her boss at work. Whether she succeeds and love finds her or not, and whether she manages to find herself, will be revealed in the sixty episodes that this Hungarian TV series has.\n\nYou’ve found the perfect show to watch if you fancy a good love story, and if you feel like you can relate to the main character. The dialogue is composed in a witty and funny way, so you won’t be bored for a second.\n\nThis series reflects on everyday Hungarian life, so you will find some slang in the show—but not teenagers’ slang. The pace of speech might be a bit too fast for beginners, but practice makes perfect. If you don’t hear something clearly, just rewind the episode a bit. This is one of the best aspects of watching Hungarian TV shows online!\n\nFamous Quotes from the Show\n\nAhogy a nagymamám mondta, a dolgok legyenek áttekinthetőek, a csoki pedig jó tömény.\n\n“As my grandma used to say, things must be clear and chocolate high in cocoa.”\n\nMindig a jók mennek el… meg Félix.\n\n“Always the good ones go away…and Félix.”\n\n3. Talk / Reality Shows\n\nShow #9: Heti Hetes — 1999\n\nThis Hungarian TV show is different from the ones we’ve gone over so far. This almost works like a talk show, and it used to be aired once a week on Sundays (up until 2016). Seven people got together and talked about social issues, everyday life, the news, etc. It was very amusing as every guest was able to give their own perspective and take on the topic.\n\nYou’re not very likely to come across any slang—or maybe just a few slang words—in this series, as the guests are mainly middle-aged or elderly. The pace of speech, therefore, is normal, not usually too rushed. We have to admit, though, that you’re most likely to enjoy this show if you know more about Hungarian culture and news, as the topics are linked to current issues in the country.\n\nThis Show’s Theme Song\n\nPolitika, botrány, bulvár, pletyka, sztárhegyek. Ez a Heti Hetes, a feketeleves.\n\n“Politics, scandals, tabloids, gossip, mountains of celebrities. This is Heti Hetes, the black soup.”\n\nThis used to be the theme song of the show. “Black soup” in Hungarian refers to something unexpected and unpleasant. This reflects the controversial nature of the show, as the guests aren’t afraid to convey their real opinions, even if those opinions aren’t in favor of the government, for example.\n\nShow #10: Való Világ (Real World) — 2002\n\nValó Világ is one of the most-watched Hungarian reality TV shows.\n\nThere are thirty-six candidates, selected by a jury based on homemade videos, who will compete with each other to win over the viewers who can get them into the villa by a call or an SMS. Every day, there are three candidates at a time, and only one of them can get in. Once they’re all in the villa, the voting begins to eliminate each of them until there’s only one left inside—the winner.\n\nThere have been nine seasons so far, with a new season coming out roughly every two years. In each of the seasons, there’s always something new.\n\nYou’re going to love this Hungarian TV show if you’re all for reality shows. As all realities, this one is vulgar and explicit. In this type of show, the only thing you’ll hear are super-easy and short sentences—the very basic everyday Hungarian dialect, swear words, and slang.\n\nHowever, you might want to double-check every expression before memorizing it, because the people in these shows are usually not the brightest and they often make grammar mistakes or simply use phrases or words the wrong way. This may be a good test for more advanced Hungarian learners, to see if you can spot the mistakes the candidates are making.\n\nImportant Quote from the Show\n\nItt a lét a tét.\n\n“Here ‘being’ is the stake.”\n\nThis is the motto of the reality show.\n\n4.

Hungarian Cities Where You’re Most Likely to Find a Job\n\nJobs in Hungary for foreigners are somewhat limited, especially for those who don’t speak the local language. But you can still land a great job here if you know where to look!\n\nThe first city that most foreigners think of is Budapest, which is no surprise. The percentage of citizens who speak second and third languages is the highest here, so as a foreigner, you probably have the best chance of finding a job in Hungary in the capital.\n\nThat said, the type of job you would like to get and the lifestyle you’re after play a huge role in which city you should opt for. Although Budapest is the best place for foreigners to find jobs, it’s possible that the big city life just isn’t for you! You could easily find smaller cities in Hungary offering jobs with no language requirements—neither English nor Hungarian.\n\nFor example, all you need in order to do construction jobs in Hungary are two talented hands and strong arms. Even smaller cities need buildings put up and roads fixed. You might want to try Szeged, Debrecen, or Pécs for this type of work.\n\nThe same goes for hotel jobs in Hungary, or for being a waiter or waitress in a local restaurant. Typically, “handy” jobs like this are perfect for those who don’t speak Hungarian or those who just don’t want to live in a big city like Budapest. These manual job openings are mostly found in local newspapers, but you can apply for them through working agencies as well.\n\n2. Top Websites for Job Hunting in Hungary\n\nWhile searching for work opportunities in Hungary, there are a few websites you should definitely check out:\n\nLinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn features tons of job listings in a variety of industries, making it one of the best places to find work in Hungary for foreigners. Of course, because LinkedIn is also a networking site, it’s a great place to find potential connections who will help you get your foot in the door.\n\nGlassdoor\n\nGlassdoor is not very popular in Hungary, but it’s still worth checking out.\n\nProfession.hu\n\nDo you already know some basic Hungarian? Then your best bet for finding your dream job is to check out Profession.hu. The majority of job descriptions here will be in Hungarian, but because this platform is even more popular in Hungary than LinkedIn, you’re sure to find a position with your name on it here!\n\nAnd a few more honorable mentions:\n\nCvonline.hu\n\nJobline.hu\n\nJobmonitor.hu\n\n3. The Best Jobs in Hungary for Expats\n\nNow, let’s look at the top jobs in Hungary for foreigners.\n\nBefore we dive in, you must bear in mind that unless you’re from the EU, EAA, or Switzerland, you’ll need a work permit to work in Hungary. Permission to work is granted by the Blue Card, which can be used for working in the country for up to two years without any problems.\n\nA- Language Teaching Jobs\n\nLanguage teaching jobs are another great start for foreigners, especially those who speak a unique language such as Chinese or Japanese. That said, this is also a popular job category for native English speakers and others who have incredible proficiency in their native tongue. This makes teaching one of the most suitable jobs for Americans in Hungary, for example.\n\nYou’ll be able to find plenty of English teaching jobs in Budapest, but other parts of the country are also in need of language teaching professionals. In fact, there is currently a shortage of professional language teachers in the country, and many language schools are actively searching for foreign teachers to employ. While many schools will ask candidates for some previous teaching or tutoring experience, they might just turn a blind eye if your language skills are through the roof!\n\nUniversities are the best place for job hunting in Hungary if you would like this type of position. Even if the school in question does not hire you—as they require candidates to have serious teaching qualifications—they might know of and connect you with other institutes who could help you find a job in Hungary.\n\nBlue-Collar Jobs\n\nAs mentioned earlier, foreigners who do not speak Hungarian will have the easiest time finding jobs that involve manual labor. It’s not uncommon in Hungary to hire foreign workers for blue-collar jobs, so you should definitely give it a go if your Hungarian knowledge is limited or nonexistent.\n\nThese types of jobs are much in demand in Hungary, as there are always buildings to be built and food to be processed. Because these are the most common jobs in Hungary, your chances of landing a blue-collar position are quite high.\n\nYou can apply for blue-collar jobs through government organizations or job centers, as the government is usually the employer. Of course, you can also find blue-collar work for private companies or even individuals.\n\nOffice Jobs\n\nWhen looking for office jobs in Hungary, you could apply for a position with a national company or with a multinational company.\n\nNational\n\nWhen it comes to national companies, you will most likely need to have some solid Hungarian language knowledge to get the job. This is especially true if you’re applying for a position with a smaller company, where the workforce mostly comprises Hungarian-speaking locals who work closely with each other each day.\n\nMultinational\n\nOn the other hand, multinational companies employ people from multiple cultures and backgrounds. Because they are more welcoming of foreigners, these companies offer work environments where speaking Hungarian is not a necessity (though it would still be an advantage!).\n\nMultinationals are also a wonderful place to find student jobs in Hungary. Bigger companies are more used to the greater turnover rate of interns and trainees, as many students do their compulsory internships at large companies. Further, because multinational companies in Hungary value the fresh perspectives that foreigners bring, they are a great place for international students to look for part-time jobs.\n\nYou can search for office job openings online through LinkedIn, Profession.hu, and the Careers page of any companies that catch your eye. Make sure to check often so you never miss your golden opportunity!\n\n➜ Before applying, make sure to study our vocabulary list Talking About the Workplace and our lesson Hungarian Words for the Workplace.\n\nHealth, Science, and Technology-Related Jobs\n\nAnother set of jobs in demand in Hungary are those related to the fields of health, science, and technology. If you have the qualifications, you’re a natural winner!\n\nIT jobs in Hungary are especially easy to find, even if you don’t speak the local language. The best place to search for work in IT or other data science fields is LinkedIn.\n\nHealthcare workers are also in-demand, especially in Budapest. To search for positions in the healthcare industry, you could inquire in hospitals directly or reach out to any contacts you may have in the country. If you’re short on connections, you may have better luck searching for open positions online. Do note, however, that LinkedIn may not be much help in this field; postings on this site tend to be geared toward office workers.\n\n➜ Are you considering a healthcare position in Hungary? Then see our vocabulary list Hungarian Words and Phrases for Visiting the Hospital to brush up on relevant vocab.\n\n4. Tips to Help You Find a Job in Hungary\n\nAre you wondering how to find work in Hungary? Here are a few tips you can apply to your hunt for a part-time or full-time position.\n\n1. Have a general idea of the field or industry you want to work in, as well as the type of work you would like to do: full-time, part-time, remote, etc.\n\n2. Do your research. Make sure you know everything about working in Hungary and its regulations, as well as the paperwork you’ll need to get done.\n\n3. Register on the appropriate website(s), such as the Hungarian job portals mentioned earlier. For most of them, you’ll need to create an account. Of course, if you don’t want to scroll through endless job opportunities yourself, you can search for a headhunter agency to do the dirty work for you. This is a common way for foreigners to find jobs abroad.\n\n4. Do a basic search of what the market can offer you in your desired field.\n\n5. Alter your existing CV or write a new one, making sure to highlight your most relevant and impressive qualifications.\n\n6. Apply for as many jobs as you can, but make sure you’re more or less qualified for all of them. Don’t be careless when applying for jobs!\n\n7. Don’t just sit around waiting for an answer. Keep improving yourself. For example, start learning a new language (like Hungarian) as this is definitely an advantage in any field or position.\n\n➜ Are you already a member of HungarianPod101?

However, New Year is also a time to celebrate beginnings, and to say goodbye to what has passed. This is true in every culture, no matter when New Year is celebrated.\n\nSo, how do you say Happy New Year in Hungarian? Let a native teach you! At HungarianPod101, you will learn how to correctly greet your friends over New Year, and wish them well with these Hungarian New Year wishes!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow to Celebrate New Year in Hungary\n\nMust-Know Hungarian Words & Phrases for the New Year!\n\nTop 10 New Year’s Resolutions in Hungarian\n\nInspirational New Year Quotes\n\nInspirational Language Learning Quotes\n\nHow To Say Happy New Year in 31 Languages\n\nHow HungarianPod101 Can Help You Learn Hungarian\n\nBut let’s start with some vocabulary for Hungarian New Year celebrations, very handy for conversations.\n\n1. How to Celebrate New Year in Hungary\n\nLet’s discuss a few examples of Hungarian traditions and rituals related to New Year’s Eve, called the Day of Sylvester or szilveszter. This is a time of relaxation after the intimate Christmas holiday, which is usually celebrated within the family. Do you have the chilled bubbly in the fridge? Is the traditional lentil soup ready? Ok, then let’s get on with it!\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of lentils, do you know the answer to this question?\n\nWhat is the secret behind the tradition of eating lentils – lencse on New Year’s Day?\n\nIf you don’t already know, you’ll find out a bit later. Keep reading.\n\nDecember 31 is the last day of the year, and in Hungary, it is the name-day of people called Sylvester. People start preparations during the afternoon of the 31st for the New Year’s Eve celebrations that are held that night. Trumpets, horns, confetti and fireworks vendors all line the streets, making it quite the festive atmosphere. Most people go to house parties, but lots of restaurants also offer New Year’s parties as well. When the clock strikes 12, everybody remains quiet and stands at attention while listening to the Hungarian National Anthem, in Hungarian Magyar Himnusz.\n\nMoving on from the modern New Year’s parties of the cities, let’s take a look at what goes on in the countryside to learn something about traditional customs aimed at bringing good health, wealth, happiness and good luck to the next year. On New Year’s Day in Hungary, one is not allowed to eat poultry and fish. This is because of the local belief that chickens bury our good luck and fish will swim away with it. In contrast, pigs dig the luck out, so eating pork on New Year’s is thought to bring you good luck for the rest of the year. Taking out or throwing anything from the house away is also thought to bring bad luck, because wealth and good luck are believed to leave the house along with it. Even throwing out trash is forbidden! Strudel or rétes is typically baked as well, because the dish is associated with a life as long as the stretched sheets of strudel dough.\n\nWhen it comes to good luck and happiness for the new year, Hungarians do not leave anything to chance. Another thing they do for the sake of good luck is give small gifts to each other that are thought to bring good luck to the receiver of the gift. Four-leaf clovers are well-known as charms for good luck, as well as the so called “good-luck piglet.” Chimney-sweepers are also believed to sweep bad luck out of one’s life. If one has done all the above-mentioned tasks, there is nothing left to stop the coming of a perfect New Year! In Hungarian, I wish you Happy New Year is Boldog új évet kívánok! – or as abbreviated in Hungarian, “B.ú.é.k.!”\n\nBut beware! In Hungary, use of fireworks, or tűzijátékok, and fire crackers, or petárdák, is only permitted during New Year’s Eve; using such devices at any other time is illegal, and heavy penalties may apply!\n\nNow it’s time to answer our quiz question-\n\nWhat is the secret behind the tradition of eating lentils on New Year’s Day?\n\nThe shape of the lentil – in accordance with traditional beliefs – is also the symbol of money. It is thought that the more lentils you eat on New Year’s Day, the richer you will become in the coming year.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nBoldog új évet!\n\n2. Must-Know Hungarian Words & Phrases for the New Year!\n\n1- Year\n\név\n\nThis is pretty self-explanatory.

When do you celebrate New Year?\n\n2- Midnight\n\néjfél\n\nThe point in time when a day ends and a new one starts. Many New Year celebrants prefer to stay awake till midnight, and greet the new annum as it breaks with fanfare and fireworks!\n\n3- New Year’s Day\n\nújév\n\nIn most countries, the new year is celebrated for one whole day.

They are popular for announcing the start of the new year with loud noises and colorful displays! In some countries, fireworks are set off to scare away evil spirits. In others, the use of fireworks is forbidden in urban areas due to their harmful effect on pets. Most animals’ hearing is much more sensitive than humans’, so this noisy display can be very frightful and traumatising to them.\n\n8- Countdown\n\nvisszaszámlálás\n\nThis countdown refers to New Year celebrants counting the seconds, usually backward, till midnight, when New Year starts – a great group activity that doesn’t scare animals, and involves a lot of joyful shouting when the clock strikes midnight!\n\n9- New Year’s Holiday\n\nÚjévi ünnep\n\nIn many countries, New Year’s Day is a public holiday – to recuperate from the party the previous night, perhaps!

It’s best to keep your resolutions realistic so as not to disappoint yourself!\n\n14- Parade\n\nfelvonulás\n\nNew Year celebrations are a huge deal in some countries!

Here are our Top 10 New Year’s resolutions at HungarianPod101 – what are yours?\n\nLearn these phrases and impress your Hungarian friends with your vocabulary.\n\n1- Read more\n\nTöbbet olvas.\n\nReading is a fantastic skill that everyone can benefit from.

You will be surprised by how much this will improve your Hungarian language skills!\n\n2- Spend more time with family\n\nTöbb időt tölt a családdal.\n\nFormer US President George Bush’s wife, Barbara Bush, was quoted as having said this: “At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, a parent.” This is very true! Relationships are often what gives life meaning, so this is a worthy resolution for any year.\n\n3- Lose weight\n\nLefogy.\n\nHands up, how many of you made this new year’s resolution last year too…?! This is a notoriously difficult goal to keep, as it takes a lot of self discipline not to eat unhealthily.

Alcohol is a poison and harmful for the body in large quantities!\n\n8- Exercise regularly\n\nRendszeresen mozog.\n\nThis resolution goes hand-in-hand with ‘Lose weight’!

However, many countries have adapted Christmas and its religious meaning to tally with their own beliefs, or simply in acknowledgment of the festival’s importance to other cultures. If you want to impress native Hungarian speakers with culturally-appropriate Christmas phrases and vocabulary, HungarianPod101 will teach you the most important ways to wish someone a ‘Merry Christmas’ in Hungarian!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nHow to Celebrate Christmas in Hungary\n\nHoliday Greetings and Wishes\n\nMust-Know Christmas Day Vocabulary\n\nTwelve Days of Christmas\n\nTop 10 Christmas Characters\n\nHow HungarianPod101 Can Help You\n\n1. How to Celebrate Christmas in Hungary\n\nThere is no doubt about it, the most significant holiday in Hungary is Christmas, or in Hungarian, karácsony. The holiday is awaited in anticipation by adults and children alike. Some get excited about the gift-giving, and others simply look forward to getting some rest after the intense holiday shopping. Let’s take a look at how Christmas is celebrated in Hungary.\n\nNow, before we get into more detail, do you know the answer to this question?\n\nWhat is the reason behind the Hungarian custom of eating fish at Christmas, instead of poultry?\n\nIf you don’t already know, you’ll find out a bit later. Keep reading.\n\nUnlike several other countries, in Hungary gifts are said to be brought not by Santa Claus, but by the baby Jesus, or Jézuska. December 24 is an official holiday, and on this day everybody is busy preparing for Christmas Eve. Many people rush to buy last-minute gifts, and every member of the family is engaged in preparing the Christmas dinner and the Christmas tree, in Hungarian called karácsonyfa.\n\nAfter all the preparations are complete, families gather around the dinner table to start the formal Christmas dinner. Fish soup, called halászlé in Hungarian, fried fish, stuffed cabbage and bejgli, a rolled, glazed cake with poppy seed or chestnut filling, are some of the most common dishes. The highlight of the evening is the lighting of the Christmas tree, which announces the arrival of baby Jesus. Depending on the year, the following two days (December 25 and 26) can be official holidays, but even on years when they are not, most people take them off anyway. On Christmas Day, festivities are continued with enormous lunches and dinners, and on December 26th–also known as Boxing Day–people visit members of the family who live further away.\n\nIn the countryside, the old Christmas customs of putting on plays representing “Bethlehem”, or betlehemezés, and regölés, which means “to sing folk songs”, are kept alive. During Bethlehem plays, people dressed in appropriate costumes walk from home to home re-enacting the biblical story of the birth of baby Jesus with funny dialogue. In return, members of the visited household give gifts and entertain the actors. The custom of regölésis comprised of men, generally in groups of four, walking through the streets of the village making lots of noise by shaking sticks with chains and blowing bagpipes and recorders. They wish for an abundant harvest and good luck to the farmers, who, in return, offer these men a glass of their best wine and best cake, made by the women of the household.\n\nThere is a small Hungarian village named Nagykarácsony, which literally means Large Christmas. This is the home of the Hungarian Santa Claus, called Mikulás. During Christmas this is probably the busiest post office in the country, because postcards posted here are stamped with a special Christmas stamp.\n\nNow it’s time to answer our quiz question-\n\nWhat is the reason behind the Hungarian custom of eating fish at Christmas, instead of poultry?\n\nIn accordance with old traditional folk beliefs, eating poultry at Christmas is not fortuitous because it is said that chickens will bury one’s good luck for the following year, whereas fish and fishing are the traditional Christian symbols of Jesus Christ.\n\n2.

It has its roots in African American modern history, and many people celebrate both Kwanzaa and Christmas!\n\n3- Have a happy New Year!\n\nBoldog Új Évet!\n\nIn countries where Christmas is not officially celebrated, but a Gregorian calendar is observed, this would be a friendly festive-season wish over New Year.\n\n4- Happy Hanukkah!\n\nBoldog Hanukát!\n\nHanukkah is the beautiful Hebrew festival over November or December each year.

This would be a good way to say goodbye to your friends and family.\n\n7- Warm wishes!\n\nMinden jót kívánok!\n\nAn informal, friendly phrase to write in Hungarian Christmas cards, especially for secular friends who prefer to observe Christmas celebrations without the religious symbolism. It conveys the warmth of friendship and friendly wishes associated with this time of year.\n\n8- Happy holidays!\n\nKellemes Karácsonyi Ünnepeket!\n\nIf you forget how to say ‘Merry Christmas!’ in Hungarian, this is a safe, generic phrase to use instead.\n\n9- Enjoy the holidays!\n\nÉrezd jól magad az ünnepek alatt!\n\nAfter saying ‘Merry Christmas’ in Hungarian, this would be a good phrase with which to wish Christmas holiday-goers well!

And in this respect, Hungary is no different.\n\n1- Köszönöm.\n\nIn Hungarian, “Thank you.” is Köszönöm.\n\n2- Köszönöm szépen.\n\nYou can emphasize köszönöm by adding szépen, which means literally “nicely, well.” You could say Köszönöm szépen, which would be equivalent to “Thanks a lot.” a more polite expression than just köszönöm. In Hungarian, there are other ways to express one’s gratitude, but they are all variations using köszönöm, which is a verb, and the adverb szépen, which can make the construction more formal to mean “thank you very much.”\n\n3- Nagyon szépen köszönöm.\n\nThere will be occasions where you will really want to show your appreciation and politeness. During occasions such as these, you can use the adverbs nagyon and szépen. “Thank you very much” in Hungarian is Nagyon szépen köszönöm. The first word nagyon, “very,” is used to make the phrase very formal. This is followed by szépen köszönöm, which literally means something like “thanking you in a nice way.”\n\nCultural Insights\n\nQuick Tip 1\n\nBy far, köszönöm is the most common way to say “Thank you.” Use the most formal version nagyon szépen köszönöm sparingly, only in very formal situations, like when extending your visa or handling some other kind of official problem in a government office. Remember: when in doubt, keeping it simple is always your safest bet. You don’t have to worry about formal or informal situations; köszönöm can be used with just about anyone, anywhere, and anytime. You say köszönöm when the waiter brings your food or drinks; when the clerk in the hotel takes your luggage to your room (of course, throwing in a tip won’t hurt either!); and when somebody welcomes you, or congratulates you. No matter his/her profession or age; köszönöm or köszönöm szépen will always be an appropriate response.\n\nQuick Tip 2\n\nIf you are around friends, you might hear shorter versions of köszönöm, like köszi, or even kösz. Both of these mean “thanks” or “cheers”; they are very informal. If you know the people well enough, feel free to throw one of these in—your knowledge of informal Hungarian will surely be appreciated.\n\nOn the run to Hungary? Wait!
