        "text": "Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (PÃFF) announces Hungary as the Focus Country for this yearâs 25th edition of the festival. The festivalâs Opening Film will be IldikÃ³ Enyediâs The Story of My Wife.\n\nThe Story of My Wife, which premiered in competition at Cannes this year, will join 18 more Hungarian films screening as part of the In Focus: Hungary programme, including 10 films in a special archive section and 8 new films representing the best of current Hungarian cinema.\n\nThe programmes are presented in collaboration with the National Film Institute - Hungary. In addition to the main programme, a programme of short films from Hungary will be shown as part of PÃFF Shorts and JÃ³zsef FÃ¼lÃ¶p, the rector of Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design (MOME), will serve on the Shorts National Competition jury.\n\nEight current feature films will be shown at PÃFF25, including GÃ¡bor Fabriciusâ Erasing Frank, which premiered in Venice this summer, KornÃ©l MundruczÃ³âs Evolution, which premiered in Cannes, and PÃ©ter Bergendyâs Post Mortem, Hungaryâs entry for the Academy Awards. The archive programme includes cinematic gems from acclaimed directors including IldikÃ³ Enyedi, MiklÃ³s JancsÃ³, MÃ¡rta MÃ©szÃ¡ros and IstvÃ¡n SzabÃ³.\n\nCsaba KÃ¡el, chairman of the National Film Institute - Hungary, commented that âwe are celebrating 120 years of Hungarian cinema in 2021 and this felt like the perfect occasion to collaborate with Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival and present the depth and breadth of filmmaking tradition we have in Hungary to a new audience in Northern Europe. We are very grateful and excited to have this opportunity and PÃFFâs audience have a real treat to look forward to this year, in exploring the rich past and exciting novelties of Hungarian cinema.â\n\nPÃFFâs festival director Tiina Lokk added, âHungarian cinema has for many years stood out for its quality and creative vision. Iâm delighted to host such a strong lineup of films this year, from a country whose films I have hugely admired since my earliest days as a young critic and student of cinema. Itâs a wonderful birthday present for PÃFF and Estonian cinema goers.â\n\nThe Story of My Wife will open the festival on November 12. Set in the 1920s, a middle-aged Dutch seaman bets his cynical business partner that he will marry the first woman who enters the cafÃ© they are sitting in and the story fans out beautifully from there. IldikÃ³ Enyediâs grandiose ninth feature - her first in English - is an adaptation of the Hungarian poet MilÃ¡n FÃ¼stâs novel of the same title â and loosely based on the legend of the cursed Flying Dutchman.\n\nOne Hungarian feature has been previously announced as part of the Official Selection programme: GyÃ¶rgy PÃ¡lfiâs Perpetuity. And another, Wild Roots, will join the Just Film sub festival.\n\nThe press screenings and first public screenings of the remaining films will run from November 13 to 27. Competition films will be available to watch for press and industry professionals with an appropriate accreditation regardless of their geographic location.\n\nThe full line-up of Black Nights will be announced at the start of November.\n\nTicket sales for the Opening Film and ceremony will begin today, October 27, and, for the other In Focus: Hungary films in the programme, on November 5th\n\nFilm Details\n\nOpening Film / In Focus: Hungary\n\nThe Story Of My Wife / A felesÃ©gem tÃ¶rtÃ©nete (2021, Hungary/Germany/Italy/France, Director: IldikÃ³ Enyedi)\n\nOfficial Selection - In Competition / In Focus: Hungary\n\nPerpetuity (2021, Hungary, Director: GyÃ¶rgy PÃ¡lfi)\n\nIn Focus: Hungary Programme\n\nErasing Frank (2021, Hungary, Director: Gabor Fabricius)\n\nEvolution (2021, Germany/Hungary, Director: KornÃ©l MundruczÃ³)\n\nPost Mortem (2021, Hungary, Director: PÃ©ter Bergendy)\n\nThings Worth Weeping for (2020, Hungary, Director: Cristina Grosan)\n\nPreparations to be Together for an Unknown Period of Time (2020, Hungary, Director: Lili HorvÃ¡t)\n\nCream (2019, Hungary, Director: NÃ³ra Lakos)\n\nIn Focus: Hungary / Just Film Programme\n\nWild Roots (2021, Hungary, Director: Hajni Kis)"
