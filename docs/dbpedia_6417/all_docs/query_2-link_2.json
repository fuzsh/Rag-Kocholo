        "text": "In the strange manner of life, this is the the story of two actors whose lives are intertwined, though they never met -intertwined in the creation of a movie that opens today at Cinema I, trailing such laurels as an Academy Award nomination for best foreign film and the award for best screenplay at last year's film festival in Cannes.\n\nThe movie is ''Mephisto,'' an opulent-looking Hungarian-German coproduction that traces the ascent into hell of a brilliant German actor named Hendrik Hofgen, who sells his soul to the Nazis.\n\nThe two real-life actors who figure in the film are Klaus Maria Brandauer, a prominent Austrian-born performer in European theater and television who portrays Hofgen on the screen, and the masterly German actor Gustav Grundgens, the man whose life inspired ''Mephisto.''\n\nThe film ''Mephisto'' is based on a controversial novel by Klaus Mann, the son of Thomas Mann - a novel banned in both prewar and postwar Germany.\n\nThe lives of Grundgens and Mr. Brandauer become linked on the very same day in 1963 when the young Austrian actor faced the opening night of his debut on the German stage; and the old German actor died in a hotel room on the other side of the world in Manila. Mr. Brandauer read the obituary of Grundgens and the very next day purchased a copy of ''Mephisto'' -and the memory of it never left him.\n\nNearly 20 years passed, and in the spring of 1980, at the Burgtheater in Vienna, where he was playing Moliere's Tartuffe, Klaus Maria Brandauer took a telephone call from Berlin. The voice on the other end belonged to the Hungarian director Istvan Szabo. ''I want to make a film from the book by Klaus Mann - 'Mephisto,' '' Mr. Brandauer remembers him saying. ''And I said, 'Stop, Mr. Szabo. I want to state that I have known the book for years, and I'm your man.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
