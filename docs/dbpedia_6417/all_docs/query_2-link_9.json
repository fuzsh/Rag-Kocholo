        "text": "Directed by Istvan Szabo\n\n1981, 15, Freemantle, Â£15.99\n\nThe first and best film in a dazzlingly intelligent trilogy of political fables made in German by Hungary's most accomplished director, each based on a real-life story, in which the great Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer impersonates three prominent Europeans spiked on the horns of moral dilemmas in the first 40 years of the 20th century.\n\nIn this one, Brandauer plays a German actor, personally ambitious, professionally innovative, celebrated for his Mephistopheles in Goethe's Faust, who moves from left to right. Deserting his working-class roots and the liberal family he has married into, he attains state preferment through a Faustian bargain with the ascendant Nazis. It is based on a 1936 novel by Heinrich Mann that indicted as a political and cultural traitor his one-time lover and brother-in-law, Gustaf Grundgens (1899-1963), one of the great figures of German theatre. Rolf Hoppe is brilliant as the anti-hero's Nazi tempter, a cross between Goebbels and Goering, and the picture won an Oscar for best foreign language film. The other movies, Colonel Redl (1985) and Hanussen (1988), star Brandauer as the bisexual officer who betrayed Austro-Hungarian secrets to the Russians on the eve of the First World War, and the brain-damaged Austrian soldier who became a celebrated clairvoyant in the Twenties and foresaw, and influenced, the rise of Hitler.\n\nBrandauer dominates the trilogy through the subtlety of his performances and his extraordinary physical presence. He is like a bull that thinks he is the matador. But he is surrounded by excellent performers, and the movie is superbly designed and photographed. The trilogy's refusal to make easy moral judgments has been given additional support and a peculiar poignancy by the recent revelation that Szabo had been forced by the Hungarian secret police to spy on his colleagues.\n\nNext week: Luis Bunuel's Viridiana"
