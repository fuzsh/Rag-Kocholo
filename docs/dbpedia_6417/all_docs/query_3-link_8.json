        "text": "“Béla Tarr is one of the cinema’s most adventurous artists, and his films, like Sátántangó and The Turin Horse are truly experiences that you absorb, and that keep developing in the mind.” said Martin Scorsese.\n\nHe started out as an amateur filmmaker, working on films from his teens and even making an independent feature film in 1981 with the support of experimental filmmakers before gaining a place at the Hungarian University of Theatre and Film at the age of 22. His first films were documentalist in style, often using amateur actors and shooting on location. In the late 1980s, he developed his strong style and started his collaboration with the writer László Kransznahorkai and composer Mihály Víg. His films’ absurdity and stylization overpasses documentative film sensibility. What quickly became known worldwide as Tarr’s trademark film language is typically a dark, black and white, slow-paced world of decay with figures hopelessly existing in the bleak Hungarian countryside. Controlled camera work and extremely long takes of scenes void of action or narrative lead to his strong, unique film style, which may seem similar to Tarkovsky, but only superficially, since this is a raw, post-Christian world lacking spirituality. The bleakness can also be read as the general pessimistic and cynical mentality of late-soviet states. He went on to direct seven films in this style, among which the most famous is undoubtedly Satan’s Tango.\n\nEver since the debut of his first film, he has received international acclaim among filmmakers and critics, as well as global attention, that has only intensified as he developed and matured as a director. He shot The Man from London in 2008, starring Miroslav Krobot and Tilda Swinton and was featured at that year’s Cannes Film Festival. His last film is named The Turin Horse, which was premiered in 2011 and was awarded the Silver Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. He then stated that he is retiring from directing feature films. He was only 56 years old at the time. He believed to have made everything he wanted to, so it was time to stop shooting, not wanting to bore anyone by repeating himself. Then between 2013 and 2016 he founded and taught at the Sarajevo film.factory film university. In 2017, he created an interactive film exhibition in Amsterdam about the refugee crisis and human dignity, creating a summary of his life-work. He is still active in international film education, aiming to assist the next generation of filmmakers into this world.\n\nHis trademark style is so prominent that it often leads him to surpass other famous directors, leading him to become one of the most well-known directors of independent film, even outside this genre. This is how he has earned such key places in film listing as 13th in The Guardian’s list of the world’s 40 best film directors, overtaking Tarantino, Altman, Almodovárt and Spielberg."
