        "text": "The National Film Institute's Studios in Hungary's FÃ³t will undergo a major expansion project as part of the country's economic protection program. The government plans to increase the studio's capacity to 12,200 square meters, creating hundreds of new job opportunities.\n\nFour new soundstages, each measuring 2500 square meters, will be built on the 10,000 square meter lot, bringing the total studio capacity to 12,670 square meters. The soundstages can also be used as two 4800 square meter stages, making the NFI Studios a versatile and attractive option for both international and Hungarian productions. The soundstages will feature state-of-the-art facilities, close proximity to backlot sets and support facilities, and the flexibility to accommodate a variety of production types.\n\nWith soundstage occupancy rates reaching a critical level in Hungary, the expansion will meet the increasing demand for studio space. The FÃ³t production hub expansion will be the country's largest state-funded film studio development project, aimed at boosting the Hungarian film industry.\n\nNFI Studios, located on a 23-hectare plot in FÃ³t, offers a range of backlot sets and soundstages, along with a wide variety of props and wardrobe. The studio complex is just a 30-minute drive from Liszt Ferenc Airport or 20 minutes from Budapest city center and serves as a filming location for some of the biggest Hollywood productions, Netflix shows, and indie films. With the addition of Europe's largest outdoor water tank, the NFI Studios are well-equipped to handle any type of film or TV production.\n\nThe Hungarian film industry has seen tremendous growth in recent years, with film production spending reaching HUF 100 billion annually and contributing significantly to the country's GDP. Budapest is the second most popular place to shoot films in Europe, and films produced in Hungary are eligible for a 30% rebate based on their expenditure in the country."
