        "text": "The article focuses on Hungarian films produced between 1939–1944 by examining how they tend to refrain from representing conflicts, and scrutinizing the political as well as social issues. However, directors started to revise this avoidance of conflicts by employing a so-called noir sensibility from the beginning of the Second World War in certain films, especially in “doomed love movies” such as Deadly Spring (Halálos tavasz, 1939), Mountain Girl (A hegyek lánya, 1942), and A Woman Looks Back (Egy assszony visszanéz, 1942), or melodramas, such as At the Crossroads (Keresztúton, 1942), Lent Life (Kölcsönadott élet, 1943), and Black Dawn (Fekete hajnal, 1943). The essay also offers a case study of the banned Hungarian movie Half a Boy (Egy fiúnak a fele, shot in 1943, but only shown in February 1946) by D. Ákos Hamza, which represented and protested against the stigmatization of Jewish people. Half a Boy is an often-cited emblematic film of its era. It is also an enigmatic one: it is a work full of social and political-historical reflections. Its humanistic point of view makes it outstanding in its era, nevertheless it is also rather ambivalent in terms of its orientation of values.\n\nThis article explores synergies between Hungarian critical sociology in the 1960–70s and the documentary films made in Balázs Béla Stúdió in the same period. It treats the rationalization of social phenomena as a battle ground for meaning and claims that both representatives of the social sciences and filmmakers, on the one hand, called upon deficient social mechanisms and the inner contradictions of existing socialism and, on the other hand, pointed to the discrepancy between ideological and empirical perceptions of reality as the root cause of the crisis characterizing the consolidated Kádár regime. Adopting Clifford Geertz’s conceptual matrix of the experiencenear and the experience-distant production of social meaningfulness, the article explores how sociologists and makers of sociographic documentaries alike resisted the prevailing epistemic regime, more specifically how they punctured and undermined the ideological meanings of such concepts as maternity, the Romani, and cooperative democracy.\n\nIn the present paper I examine the so called neo-avantgarde films made in Balázs Béla Studio, Budapest, Hungary, between seventies and eighties. These films eventually were made not by professional film directors, but by artists who were active in many branches of art, e.g. conceptualism, happening, performance , experimental painting, photo and literature etc. They were focusing on materiality of film, geometric abstraction and seriality, intermediality, experimental montage and renewing of the classical tradition of allegorical montage, new combinations of sound and image etc. Naturally, these procedures were not permitted in mainstraim film industry, not to mention the fact that they were not acceptable from the point of view of the ideology of social realism. The question is how these films tried to improve the double criticism the targets of which were the hegemon ideology in politics and the hegemon forms of reality.\n\nCloser scrutiny of international classical documentaries (Nanook, Land without Bread, Spanish Earth, etc.) has put big question marks behind the traditional (or naïve?) concepts of documentation and reality, as if any theorist looking for documentary could only nd ction. On the other hand, thènon-existing' documentary is ourishing, both in the commercial media and the art houses. Cinema-goers or TV-viewers (though not all of them) seem to appreciate something special in these oerings. The aim of this essay is to analyze some of the classical Hungarian documentaries from Höllering to Schier, Ember and Gulyás: do the artistic methods they used, the documentarists' discipline and ethics they followed oer us some useful clues to the contemporary discussion about the essence of documentary lmmaking? The Real and the Truth There is a Hungarian poem, which has played a crucial role in dening the public thinking in Hungary about the concept of the real. Attila József, one of the justly canonized Hungarian poets of the 20 th century, wrote in early 1937 a poem of 36 lines: Welcoming Thomas Mann (Thomas Mann üdvözlése) upon the occasion of the famous German writer's visit to Budapest.\n\nThis study firstly emphasize the importance and relevance of analysing newsreels from a history of education aspect, which is a blind spot in the Hungarian research. The official Leninist ideology deeply influenced the genre, used as a channel of overall propaganda, during and after the communist takeover, between 1945 and 1954. Production and broadcasting depended on the political goals and turns of the Communist Party, combined simple messages with easily understandable narrative forms, to support campaigns, spread intended knowledge and so on. The footages has now digitized and open to access for everyone (https://filmhiradokonline.hu/): using the webpage, through a three-step data collecting and selection process, a database made, with 205 items to analyse. Three archetypes, basic storytelling forms are detected, I called them metaphorically One from the many, Occupying space and Learning society. The development and progression of the country after WW2 always represented in individual life-stories and personal backgrounds to get close these stories to the audience, trying to make Soviets and communists more popular. At the same time, more and more spaces are occupied by the new power, both physically and symbolically, for example the former castles became schools, training sites, etc., which signed the expropriation the past, too. Definition and scope of education extended in the discourses, because every member of the society would learn repeatedly the language of the new establishment. Propaganda and persuasion was overall in this process, one could not avoid interacting and reflecting somehow to this.\n\nCloser scrutiny of international classical documentaries (Nanook, Land Without Bread, Spanish Earth, etc.) has put big question marks behind the traditional (or naive?) concepts of documentation and reality. As if any theorist looking for documentary could only find fiction. On the other hand, the 'non-existing' documentary is flourishing, both in the commercial media and the art houses. Cinema-goers or TV-viewers (though not all of them) seem to appreciate something special in these offerings. The aim of this presentation is to analyse some of the classical Hungarian documentaries from Höllering to Schiffer and Ember: do the artistic methods they used, the documentarists' discipline and ethics they followed offer us some useful clues to the contemporary discussion about the existence and essence of documentary filmmaking? Beyond a close reading of some films, the presentation also uses material from interviews the author conducted with Hungarian filmmakers during the past thirty years.\n\nThe article introduces the collective research project entitled The Social History of Hungarian Cinema, 1931–2015, executed by the staff of Film Studies Department Eötvös Loránd University. This data-driven research aims to examine how and why Hungarian films have changed over time. Using the case study of conflict types in the plots of Hungarian films this study discusses the methodological problems of longitudinal explanations of change in Hungarian film history (periodization and dividing film between genre-based film and auteur films/art cinema). Based on the analysis of statistics and trends, the study presents the most important types of conflict in Hungarian film history. With respect to the political turning points and the periodization of Hungarian film history, the article states that each of the three broad periods (1931–1944, 1945–1989, 1990–2015) is characterized by its own distinctive set of prominent conflict types. The pre-1945 era is characterized by a massive number of love conflicts, the socialist period by the highest rate of political conflicts (and the lowest rates of love and crime conflicts), and the post-socialist period by a high rate of crime and generational conflicts. Furthermore, by analysing the connections between conflict types and genres, the study reveals recurring patterns and trends of shorter periods: it shows how the range of conflicts narrowed considerably over the 1970s and discusses the extent to which this is related to the dominance of auteur films in the era."
