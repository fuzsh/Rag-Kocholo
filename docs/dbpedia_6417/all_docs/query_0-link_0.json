After all, I am just an actor.” So how did an up-and-coming thespian with a mixed- race mistress and left-wing sympathies make it to the top of Nazi Germany’s theatrical world? Klaus Maria Brandauer’s Hendrik Hoefgen overwhelmingly triumphs in the role of Mephistopheles, the demonic tempter in Goethe’s Faust. Adapted from Klaus (son of Nobel laureate Thomas) Mann’s 1936 novel, so transparently about his brother-in-law Gustaf Gründgens (the bowler-hatted criminal boss in Lang’s M and one of Germany’s greatest stage actors) that it couldn’t be published in Germany until 1971. Hungary’s first-ever Foreign Film Oscar winner, keyed by Brandauer’s riveting performance. DCP. Approx. 144 min.\n\nA KINO LORBER RELEASE. \n\nREVIEWS\n“There has been precious little incisive appraisal of the precise seductive allure of fascism, and certainly none to match that offered by Szabó’s remarkable film.”\n– Paul Taylor, Time Out (London)\n\n“Magnificent and distinguished. It’s more than a mercy, it’s a coup.”\n– David Thomson\n\n“a performance of electrifying power.”\n– Roger Ebert",

His is a great performance, nothing less.”\n\n– Richard Schickel, TIME Magazine\n\n“Marked a new humanism in German-language cinema after the German new wave of the 1970s.”\n\n– Andrew Pulver, The Guardian\n\n“The film does that first necessary thing for films of the Reich––it suggests the foul breath of these handsome people. It’s a world in which you can’t breathe for the stink.”\n\n– David Thomson"
