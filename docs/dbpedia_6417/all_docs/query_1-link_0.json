        "text": "Happy Thursday! This issue of the Animation Obsessive newsletter is all about Hungarian animation — as seen in three great films.\n\nThe projects we’re featuring today come from the ‘60s and ‘70s, when Hungary was communist: Sisyphus (1974), The Kidnapping of the Sun and Moon (1968) and Honeymation (1975). They’re important products of the so-called Hungarian School of Animation, which contained many of the most experimental animators in the whole Eastern Bloc.\n\nWe’ve mentioned all of these films in the newsletter before — they’re favorites of ours. Yet we haven’t explored them in detail (or embedded full versions) until now. We’re excited to do so, and to bring you a number of details never before printed in English.\n\nHere we go!"
