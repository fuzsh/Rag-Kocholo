        "text": "We could not be more happy. Thank you so much, we are blessed and so appreciative of your company and team of people who helped make our home purchase a reality.\n\n~ Domenic G., Vacaville, CA\n\nVery good from start to finish.

We thank all the staff who have been very friendly & responsive.\n\n~ Margie S., Tucson, AZ\n\nWe love the layout of our home. The large windows provide lots of natural light coming in which is very important to us. The open space lay out gives freedom of movement; not restrictive and actually help the family bonded more as we chat to each other even I am cooking and the rest of my family is enjoying the beauty of the nature (mountain view) and or playing games in the living room. We are truly blessed!!\n\n~ Denis D., Tucson, AZ\n\nFrom start to finish Richmond American Homes was the best!\n\n~ Kevin R., Surprise, AZ\n\nOur overall experience was great because of the wonderful staff employed by Richmond American Homes.

My overall experience with this crew was/is epic. Thank you.\n\n~ Kurt H., Coolidge, AZ\n\nTo start, Richmond did not raise the price of our home during the building process.

Each and every person I worked with throughout my Richmond home buying process was amazing!\n\n~ Paige D., Payson, UT\n\nWe built our prior home with another builder and it was not as good of an experience as what we had with Richmond. From there very beginning of the process, we felt cared for, looked out for, and that our needs/wants in our home were always the priority. Every person that we dealt with was willing to hear us out to provide us exactly what we were looking for.\n\n~ Casey L., Syracuse, UT\n\nOur overall experience was really pleasant, everyone who works at Richmond helped and treated us good, always in touch with us.

We received the house according to the initial plan, on time. All details was covered. Recommended 100 %.\n\n~ Jaime D., Herriman, UT\n\nEveryone at Richmond has been communicative, knowledgeable, and great to work with.
