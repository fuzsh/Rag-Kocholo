        "text": "The barbecue styles of Kansas City, Memphis, and Texas are well known around the U.S., but Californiaâs Santa Maria Valley claims a method that has flown slightly under the radar. Dating back to the mid-1800s, ranchers in the Santa Maria Valleyâan area about an hour north of Santa Barbaraâcreated its own barbecue style, and local chefs have maintained and refined the tradition ever since.\n\nMajor media has taken note of the Santa Maria style; in recent years, the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and the Food Network show BBQ with Bobby Flay have all featured the simple but flavorful cuisine.\n\nâThe Santa Mariaâstyle barbecue tradition is seeing a bit of a renaissance as more and more people embrace the concept of authentic regional foods,â says Susan M. Righetti, founder of Susie Qâs Brand of artisan foods and seasonings and daughter of the owners of Far Western Tavern, one of the original restaurants to offer the style. âSanta Maria Valley is the only California locale that has its own unique regional cuisine.â\n\nThe style is defined by three elements: the cut of the beef, the cooking method, and the ingredients. Tri-tip, a triangular sirloin cut, is traditionally used, and is cooked slowly over an open flameâas opposed to a closed grillâfrom California red oak, indigenous to the region. The beef is minimally seasoned with a garlic, salt, and pepper rub, then served alongside grilled French bread, green salad, salsa, and locally grown pinquito beans.\n\nâThe beauty is in its authenticity, simplicity, and economy,â Righetti says.\n\nTo taste this California specialty, head to one of the family-run restaurants that have been serving the traditional cuisineâsome for nearly a centuryâsuch as the Hitching Post in Casmalia (with a second location in Buellton), Far Western Tavern in Orcutt, and Jockoâs Steak House in Nipomo.\n\nFor your first sampling, definitely try the steak, advises Terri Ostini Stricklin, the general managerâand sister of the ownersâof the original Hitching Post. (Her two brothers each own and operate one of the restaurants; you may recognize the Hitching Post II from the 2004 movie Sideways.) You can watch as one chef prepares every entrÃ©eâsometimes 50 to 60 at once, Stricklin saysâfrom an open kitchen. âOur menu hasnât changed since 1952,â she says. âWe keep it simple so that we can do it right.â"
