Fresno Pacific University (private) is building a full campus in Visalia. Back before UC Merced was built, Visalia was in the running as a location for the UC.\n\nI've never head of anyone not being able to find what they are looking for in Visalia. They also have a Circuit City, Best Buy, Mervyns, Kohls, Sears, Marshall's, Ross, JC Penny's. They have some tourism (gateway up to sequoia).\n\nI think my biggest issue with the definition you propose is that is assumes all Urban areas have tons of wealth. I just don't know if thats really true. Though obviously Visalia is no LA or New York. I have an issue with it being called a Suburb of Fresno as well, as Visalia has its own economy independent of Fresno, plus its 45 miles away. If anything Visalia floats somewhere inbetween independent Urban area and Suburb of Fresno, because granted, you do have to Fly out of Fresno and the State College in Fresno is popular with many Visalians.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by MWJamesLDS\n\nThough Admittedly Visalian's do have to commute for an Airport or State College, thats about it.

If anything Visalia floats somewhere inbetween independent Urban area and Suburb of Fresno, because granted, you do have to Fly out of Fresno and the State College in Fresno is popular with many Visalians.\n\nTrust me, 45 miles of Fresno makes it a suburb. If you look down in LA area, that's an average commute time. An hour at max is a commute time. I think Fresno is getting more tax revenue than Visalia, and Visalia being so close to the sequioas is why they want to keep it smaller and less urban than Fresno. Let's not forget Visalia ppl like going to Fresno's theme park and clovis's water park. And Fresno has some better stores. I also dont think Visalia is urban because of it's surrounding cities are spread apart and only tulare, dinuba, and porterville have average urban population densitys. San Luis Obispo's suburbs are all grouped together and have high population density since they are at the beach. Morro Bay, Nipomo, Halycon, and Los Osos are a bit more spread out.\n\nCity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nTo me, an urban city has got to have it's \"real\" suburbs, have some good tax revenue base, main transportation, have all the shopping centers, a college, and the entertainment.\n\nAt the very least, Visalia is a strong suburb that draws rural cities to it. But Visalia doesnt have any suburbs, it has rural cities surrounding by it and it doesnt meet the tax revenue base. It really has no core market, no college, and no airport.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by MWJamesLDS\n\nThis is straight off of Wiki, so not vouching for accuracy, but nevertheless.\n\nThe United States Census Bureau has defined 363 Metropolitan Statistical Areas[1] (MSAs) for the United States of America. The Census Bureau defines a Metropolitan Statistical Area as one or more adjacent counties or county equivalents that have at least one urban core area of at least 50,000 population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties.[2]\n\nMetropolitan Statistical Areas of the United States of America Rank Metropolitan Statistical Area Nickname State 2007 Pop 2000 Pop Δ Pop Combined Statistical Area\n\n112 Visalia-Porterville, CA MSA Tulare County CA 00,421,553 00,368,021 A061+14.55% ZZZ\n\nThat's the state's system of couting how many people live in an area. They really don't define city to city that are urban, rural, or suburban.\n\nThe part of the urban core thing is like San Luis Obispo and El Centro having almost 50,000 population (but have population in college, rural areas, and illegal living residents), and then having adjacent territory and/or counties (suburbs) that has economic relationship with the urban core.\n\nVisalia is an adjacent city within an hour of Fresno where the urban core. Visalia has no adjacent territories that have economic relationship. Hanford and Tulare, but thats about it.\n\nI just dont think Visalia has the urban core El Centro, San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and Santa Barbara have.\n\nEl Centro has 43,000 population now, but is estimated to have 50,000 population by 2030 or 2040. Not to mention there is 150,000 population within 20 minutes of the city, and the city has about 5,000 residents in county rural land and then 2,000 so illegal citizens.\n\nSan Luis Obispo has 45,000 population, but is estimated to have 50,000 population by 2050 form the orcutt, margaritta, and airport road annexations. Not to mention there is 150,000 population within 20 minutes of the city, and the city has about 5,000 residents in the county rural land and then 6,200 college students living in the Cal Poly dorms.\n\nThat is why these urban cities w/ rural fringe are considered urban even though they have less than 50,000 population. San Luis Obispo and El Centro have made exceptions to the 50,000 population minimum. And I have a hard time believing that 50,000 population is what it takes to be an urban core. I think 40,000 population or 45,000 population is what it should be.\n\nVisalia lacks the financial stability, major transportation, state college, entertainment, all shopping needs, and tourism. There are Visalians that have to commute to Fresno (6,000 ppl commute), and Visalia has alot of Fresno-based companies in the city that make-up alot of those jobs.\n\nAlso after re-reading what the wiki page says. I think they ment an area having at least 50,000 population and then having an area with less than that. Which even Paso Robles area has 50,000 population with adjacent smaller areas. I think San Luis Obispo and Visalia are urbanized areas since they have over 50,000 population within 10 minutes of each city.\n\nhttp://www.leiderhayes.com/images/Property_PDF/VABS%20Leasing%20Flyer%20With%20Insert.pdf (broken link)\n\nLast edited by the city; 08-05-2008 at 05:01 PM..\n\nSuburban is still different than your rural fringe classification that you started with. But it still isn't the correct class. Since you now want to use RUCA, lets do that.\n\nBut your demographic researcher contact needs to talk to other demographers about Visalia the city, not the MSA.\n\nHe/She either did not check the census tract level data or they just gave you a quick answer based on Tulare County which covers Visalia's MSA.\n\nRUCA, Rural-Urban Continuum Areas codes, are a Federal program that create 10 categories.\n\nHere is the county classification by the Federal Govt.\n\nSan Luis Obispo County is a Code 3.\n\nTulare County where Visalia is located is a Code 2.\n\nERS/USDA Data - 2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes\n\nBut that refers to the entire county. RUCA classifications typically use a 30% commute factor for a Code 2 area, much more than the commute maps show leaving Tulare County. So residents are commuting but not necessarily to Fresno.\n\nIf we look at Zip Code approximations for RUCA codes Visalia's Zip Codes (93277, 93278, 93279, 93291, 93292, etc) we can get the RUCA code for the City of Visalia. You can download the Excel file which converts census tract info to zip codes here:\n\nUW RHRC Rural Urban Commuting Area Codes (http://depts.washington.edu/uwruca/download.html - broken link)\n\nVisalia shows as a RUCA code 1, (the column labeled RUCA2) the same as SLO's Zip Codes of 93401, 93403, 93406, 93408, etc. They are not 1.1, commuting to a larger urban area. So Visalia like SLO is its own urbanized area.\n\nSo both Visalia and SLO qualify as RUCA 1, Metropolitan area core: primary flow within an urbanized area (UA).\n\nNow Tulare (93274, 93275) shows as RUCA 4.2 flow to a larger area, probably Visalia. So you could say Tulare is a suburb of Visalia.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by FresnoFacts\n\nSuburban is still different than your rural fringe classification that you started with.

So you could say Tulare is a suburb of Visalia.\n\nI'm still not sure as how Visalia can be considered an urban city when it looks to Fresno for the airport, entertainment, more stores for shopping needs, looks to Fresno's companies to bring jobs into Visalia, and then there's the 6,000 ppl in Visalia that commute there for work. Also the tourism is going into the smaller towns around Visalia where the sequioas are. And, then there's the fact that Visalia has no Macy's in the area and Macy's hasn't even considered into building in that area.\n\nI'm not sure how to check to see if your translation of the RUCA code is correct. But you are telling me the only problem with my list is that Visalia should be under urban. Well, would you be willing to consider Visalia as ex-urban? Since I still believe Visalia has it's primary urban core in Fresno and then it's own smaller urban core in the city....\n\nShould I make a seperate list for ex-urban areas? I dont think there are many ex-urbs in California, but I can make a list of them."
