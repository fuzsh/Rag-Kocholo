Through their weekly BYB meetings, bimonthly mixers, Hispanic Business Group events, ribbon cuttings, social media shout outs, and my business profile on their website, I've connected with key business owners in the community, gained valuable referrals, and boosted my visibility. As a Chamber member, I leverage my affiliation to showcase my credibility, positioning my businesses as the go-to choice for photo booth experiences, digital marketing, and event services.Being a Chamber member is more than just self-promotion. It's about giving back to our community via leadership, building a successful business network, and contributing to Santa Maria's journey. If you want increased visibility, community impact, and credibility, make the investment to join the Chamber as I have and hundreds of other businesses and organizations have!\n\nVanessa Grossman, Owner of That One Photobooth & Vanessa Rae Media\n\n\"Since joining the Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce, I’ve developed so many new relationships unique to our local chamber business community. The new business generated immediately paid for itself many-fold! I am grateful for my fellow chamber members like Kelsi Fitzgerald of Veritas Innovative Pest and Termite Solutions whose support and encouragement has been such a warm welcome to the SMVCC family. My business certainly wouldn’t be where it is today without my chamber of commerce relationships.\"\n\nMarina Garcia-Endert\n\nOwner of Truly Gifted \"Your Professional Gift Company\"\n\n\"As a 40-year resident of Santa Maria, there was never any question where I would start my own business! I have owned Wine & Design in Orcutt for over two years now, and I know first-hand how the right community support can help your business grow! Being a member of the Chamber has opened doors for Wine & Design that we may not have found otherwise! The camaraderie and extensive networking opportunities are second to none! If you are not yet a member, feel free to call and ask me about it! If you are a member, do your business a favor, and look into attending as many Chamber functions as you can! Chamber members take care of one another!\"\n\nJulie Jorge\n\nOwner, Wine & Design Orcutt\n\n\"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce for all the work they have done to keep the busieness community informed during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. As a sponsor member of the Chamber, we have used the services offered to businesses many times. We find that the SMVCC website has numerous resources available to fit the needs of our business. Being a Chamber member also helps us to make connections and gain exposure in the communities we service. This has enabled us to grow our business through networking with other businesses. We would highly recommend any business to become a member.\"\n\nOmar & Petra Hernandez\n\nOwners, Shred 2 You, Inc.\n\n\"The Santa Maria Valley Chamber of Commerce has been an excellent partner in helping promote and generate visibility to Allan Hancock College’s new skills-based career readiness app/job board; Career Connect powered by Jobspeaker. Working together with SMVCC, we have developed a consistent and efficient way to build and maintain relationships between our local employers and students at Allan Hancock. Our new regional platform is an easy and intuitive way for students to interact with employers. This new app scientifically increased our ability to build and expand relationships with our employer partners and for employers to access an excellent pool of career ready students across the region. As local businesses continue to re-open and look to find the right candidate, Career Connect can help find the candidate with the skills sets that the best suits their need. We look forward to our continued partnership with SMVCC, to generate opportunities for employment and successful placement, as well as to empowering and lifting our community.\"\n\nAlma Miranda\n\nCareer Readiness Specialist, Allan Hancock College\n\n\"I can honestly say that the Chamber and Visitors' Bureau has significantly helped me with my sales personally. With them always sending us updates on events and what is going on within the city and even the Central Coast, I have been able to turn that information into selling points to get tourist groups to not only visit my hotel but also go to some of these events supporting Santa Maria Valley. Without their assistance and constant updates, especially during COVID-19, we would probably not be doing as well as we are now. Thank You Santa Maria Valley Chamber & Visitors' Bureau! Best Western PLUS big America appreciates you!\"\n\nRobert Cooks\n\nSales Manager, Best Western PLUS Big America\n\n\"Proud to be part of the Santa Maria community! At PODS Moving and Storage, we’re honored to be a part of the vibrant Santa Maria community. The Chamber provides a fantastic platform for businesses like PODS to connect with the community and other local businesses. We believe in teamwork and are grateful for the Santa Maria Valley Chamber’s dedication to building a thriving local economy. We’re proud to be part of this incredible community!”\n\nSteve Yapp,\n\nOwner, PODS Moving and Storage\n\n\"Joining the Santa Maria Valley Chamber has exceeded my expectations! We have operated in Santa Maria since 2007, but since covid, had lost some connection with the community. Since joining, they have worked with us on numerous occasions. We have attended every mixer, were a part of the Strawberry Industry Appreciation Dinner, and most recently were a last minute add to the Expo. Every event has been high quality, the people incredibly helpful and welcoming, and we are extremely happy with the level of support and enthusiasm they bring to all members. Thank you for being such an outstanding and active chamber and for making a positive difference in our community and business!\"\n\nLinda Ozawa Olds\n\nJamba Operator and Co-Founder"
