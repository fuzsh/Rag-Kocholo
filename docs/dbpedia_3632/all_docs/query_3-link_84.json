        "text": "The YMCA of Metropolitan Milwaukee is proud to partner with the area school districts to provide before and after school care for children in grades K4-12. Our licensed program is led by qualified, caring staff and designed to complement the school day with fun activities that also support character development, healthy lifestyle choices, and academics — while still making time for fun!\n\nProgram Basics\n\nPROGRAM DATES\n\nOur School Age programs are in-session for the duration of the school year and coincide with the respective school district’s calendar. We offer School’s Out Days on most of the days that your child’s school is closed. Parents will be notified of these programs in advance and allowed to enroll for an additional fee. This program is separate from our regular before and after school program.\n\nHOURS\n\nCare may be available both before and after school when the school is in session. Times vary by school. Before school care typically begins at 6:45 AM and continues until students are dismissed for the start of the school day. After school care begins at the end of the school day and typically runs until 6:00 PM.\n\nREGISTRATION\n\nChildren in K4 (must be toilet trained) through 12th grade are welcome. Check with your school for their site-specific program ages.\n\nProgram availability varies based on each site’s licensed capacity. Capacities will be posted at each licensed location.\n\nSpots are limited; register early to avoid being put on the waitlist.\n\nParents must keep the information on all forms updated and notify the YMCA immediately of changes.\n\nFORMS\n\nAll submitted registration information will be kept confidential and will only be shared with necessary Y staff. When necessary, Y staff will be informed and updated on each child’s special health needs; all information will be shared in a private setting.\n\nRegistration\n\nHOW TO REGISTER\n\nRegistration is not finalized until confirmation is received from the School Age Registration Office. If you are having problems with online registration, please contact us at schoolage@ymcamke.org.\n\nLogin to Register\n\nONLINE\n\nIf you have an online account with us, log in using your email address or phone number. If you do not have a login, learn how to create or manage your account.\n\nHave an account but need to add a child to it? Fill out this online form for assistance.\n\nOnce logged in, scroll to the Membership section and click on your child’s name to complete the Child Profile information.\n\nThe Child Profile carries over to other YMCA programs, like Summer Day Camp, so if you register for additional programming, you will have an easier time registering.\n\nBe prepared to have your child’s immunization records ready before starting registration.\n\nOnce the Child Profile is complete, save changes and go back to your account. Repeat steps for any additional children on the account.\n\nUnder the Activities tab, select “Register for a program”.\n\nSelect the “Before and After School” tag under the Categories tab.\n\nOn this page, you’ll be able to select the school location you prefer and the program that matches your child’s needs (i.e. afternoon care 2 days per week).\n\nSelect the month(s) and day(s) of attendance and click “Next”.\n\nSelect the child you will be registering for these selections.\n\nContinue through until month/day(s) are in your cart.\n\nIf you have additional programming to register for and/or children you wish to register for Before & After School programming, select the next child and repeat the process.\n\nA one-time $40 registration fee per child is due at the time of registration.\n\nIN PERSON\n\nOnline registration is preferred. If you are unable to register online, please contact us directly at schoolage@ymcamke.org or 414-274-0759.\n\nREMINDERS\n\nRegistration is limited and is based on availability; please register early.\n\nA $40 registration fee will be added to your account at time of registration. Your child will not be registered until this fee has been processed.\n\nRates are based on a FLAT MONTHLY RATE. Rates are established based on schedule, not attendance. There are no credits for time off, holidays, vacations, or absences due to illness or behavior.\n\nA fee of $1 will be charged for every minute after the end of program/care that your child is not picked up. Late pick-up is only to be approved in emergency situations. Repeated late pick-up may result in the removal from the program.\n\nADDITIONAL CHILD DISCOUNT\n\nFamilies will receive a 10% discount for each additional registered child. The 10% discount will be applied to the lower rate(s).\n\nFor registration and billing questions, contact our office at schoolage@ymcamke.org or 414-274-0759.\n\nPayment Information\n\nPOLICIES\n\nREGISTRATION & REGISTRATION FEE\n\nA $40 registration fee will be added to your account at time of registration. Your child will not be registered until this fee has been processed. Registrations that are missing information will receive a pending email and will not be processed until all information is provided. A confirmation email will be sent once the registration is processed.\n\nRATES\n\nRates are based on a FLAT MONTHLY RATE. Rates are established based on schedule, not attendance. There are no credits for time off, holidays, vacations, or absences due to illness or behavior. All fees must be paid the first of the month of service.\n\nLATE FEE\n\nA fee of $1 will be charged for every minute after the end of program/care that your child is not picked up. Late pick-up is only to be approved in emergency situations.

The 10% discount will be applied to the lower rate(s).\n\nPROGRAM SCHEDULE CHANGE OR WITHDRAWL\n\nA four-week notice is required for a permanent schedule change affecting the numbers of days a student attend the program and/or withdrawal from the program. Adjustments to the monthly rate will be made four weeks after initial date of notice to the School Age Office.\n\nFor registration and billing questions, contact our office at schoolage@ymcamke.org or 414-274-0759.\n\nFinancial Assistance & WI Shares\n\nYMCA FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\n\nIndividuals and families may apply for financial assistance for membership or programs, such as Summer Day Camp. Assistance is based upon a number of factors, including total household income and number of dependents. The process is confidential.\n\nApply Online\n\nWISCONSIN SHARES CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE\n\nThe YMCA of Metropolitan Milwaukee offers many Summer Day Camps that are licensed by the Department of
