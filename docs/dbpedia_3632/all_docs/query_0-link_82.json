        "text": "Top Reasons why San Luis Obispo is so HAPPY\n\nand the Best Place to Live!\n\nSan Luis Obispo on the Central California Coast could easily qualify as paradise. The climate is among the country's most pleasant, with 285 mostly sunny days per year and temperatures rarely above 90 degrees, or below freezing. The presence of academic heavyweight Cal Poly helps anchor the local economy- the unemployment rate is well below the national average. It's fortunate that local jobs are plentiful, since it's too far to commute to Los Angeles or the Bay Area. Considering further its low crime and unemployment rates, the San Luis Obispo area seems to have it all. But home prices here have risen steadily in the last few years, so that the median listing price is now $925,000. While this isn't unreasonable by California standards, it can be out of reach for many of us thinking of moving from other parts of the country.\n\nSee this video for a 36 hour tour of San Luis Obispo and a few of the unique places to visit, eat and shop. Why not buy a home where you would want to vacation?\n\nThanks to National Geographic and Oprah Winfrey we have all heard that San Luis Obispo is the Happiest Place in America and arguably the WORLD. SLO was also ranked the 3rd best place in America to live (above Santa Barbara, San Francisco, Monterey, Newport Beach, Honolulu, etc.) Here are a few reasons why we think San Luis Obispo is so loved by all its residents and visitors. It is no fluke. There are very sound reasons.\n\nSan Luis Obispo is social. On the Oprah segment, Jenny McCarthy said it well. San Luis Obispo is our version of being SOCIAL. She loved the beautiful and scenic outdoors, filled with bikers and hikers on trails that went all over the hills to the oceans, the sight of friends hanging out with friends at the farmer's markets and spending \"happy hours\" in SLO's popular downtown.\n\nSan Luis Obispo truly has farm to table lifestyle. There are four farmers markets in San Luis Obispo every week and one every day of the week throughout the county, so access to fresh foods is easy. Not to mention that SLO is home to some of the most amazing restaurants, world-class chefs and finest wines anywhere. Farms and ranches are throughout the rambling hills and sister peaks of San Luis County.\n\nSan Luis Obispo is happily active. San Luis Obispo was recently cited as one of the most active cities in the nation. Many residents bike and walk to work every day. There are more than 6,500 acres of protected open space for hiking, biking and yearlong outdoor activities.\n\nSan Luis Obispo supports the arts. Residents love their art â€“ from performance art to the visual arts. San Luis Obispo is home to the Christopher Cohan Performing Arts Center, a state-of-the-art performance facility that exposes the Central Coast to varied, high quality arts events designed to serve diverse audience interests.\n\nSan Luis Obispo weather is as pleasant as it gets. San Luis Obispo County has one of the world's most comfortable climates. The weather is perfect 306 days of the year. While more than half of the country is trekking through snow, ice, sleet and rain this time of year, we're enjoying perfect 75 degree weather without a cloud in the sky. Sure, it rains here, and we have our moments of unpleasant weather, but for most of the year, we enjoy beautiful sunny skies and a moderate climate. The summers here are delightfully mild, with daytime highs usually in the low 80s, and cool evenings. Winters are even better with daytime highs in the 60s and 70s, and crisp, clear nights. Frost is rare, snow almost unheard of. (A dusting of snow always makes the front page of the local paper.) This perfect weather allows us to be more social and active when residents of other cities in the nation are holed up inside.\n\nLet Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate | Haven Properties introduce you to one of the finest environments on this Earth!\n\nHere are some more videos and articles on San Luis Obispo, THE BEST PLACE TO LIVE!\n\nAre You Happy?
