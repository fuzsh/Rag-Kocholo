While the revenue stream will fluctuate, the goal was to raise $250 million annually to help end homelessness across greater Portland.\n\nSHS taxes are now supported by TurboTax.\n\nDo I owe Metro’s supportive housing services tax?\n\nHere is how to find out more:\n\nHow much and who pays?\n\n1% on Oregon taxable income above $125,000 for individuals or $200,000 for couples filing jointly (example: line 19 on tax form OR-40)\n\nA 1% business income tax on net income for businesses with gross receipts above $5 million.\n\nFile by Monday, April 15, 2024.\n\nWhy do I send payment to the Portland Revenue Division?\n\nMetro has contracted with the City of Portland for revenue collection – even outside of Portland – to save administration costs."
