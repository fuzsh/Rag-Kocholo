This enabling legislation mandates local governments to prepare general plans and zoning to ensure orderly physical growth and development within their jurisdictions as well as the protection of public health, safety, and wel- fare. Traditional local control over regulation of .land use in the coastal zone was substantially modified with the passage of The California Coastal Zone Conservation Act (Proposition 20) by the voters of California on Novem- ber 7, 1972. The forces leading to the passage of this landmark initiative were complex. The key factor, however, was the visible deterioration of the. coastal environment due to increasing development pressures from a growing population. Under Proposition 20, the California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission and six Regional Coastal Commissions were created and given a dual mandate of preparing a statewide \"comprehensive enforceable plan for the orderly, long-range conservation and management of the coast\" and regu- lating development while this plan was being prepared. From 1973 to 1975, the Coastal Commissions, both Regional and State, held Titerally hundreds of hearings on the evolving plan. The California Coastal Plan was submitted to the legislature on December 1, 1975. During the 1976 legislative session, several coastal bills were introduced, all modifying to some extent the Coastal Plan. By the summer of 1976, SB 1277, the California Coastal Act, emerged from both houses as the basis of California's Coastal Zone Manage- ment Program. SB 1277 was amended by a trailer bill, AB 2948, which was it- self amended by AB 400. On January 1, 1977, the Coastal Act and other leg- islation came into effect, establishing a permanent coastal management pro- gram for Cali forni a. 1.2 GOALS, PRIORITIES, AND POLICIES In enacting the Coastal Act, the Legislature established the following goals for future activity in the coastal zone: (a) Protect, maintain, and, where feasible, enhance and restore the overall quality of the coastal zone environment and its natural and manmade resources. (b) Assure orderly, balanced utilization and conservation of coastal zone resources taking into account the social and economic needs of the people of the state. (c) Maximize public access to and along the coast and maximize public recreational opportunities in the coastal zone consistent with sound resources conservation principles and constitutionally protected rights of private property owners. (d) Assure prior .ity for coastal-dependent development over other development on the coast. (e) Encourage state and local initiatives and cooperation in prepar- ing procedures to implement coordinated planning and development for mutually beneficial uses, including educational uses, in the coastal zone. The hear t of the Coastal Act is found in Chapter 3, Coastal Resources Planning and Management Policies. These policies constitute the standards that local plans must meet in order to be certified by the State as well as the yardstick for evaluating proposed developments within the coastal zone. Topics covered by coastal policies include: beach access, low and moderate income housing, recreation, marine environment, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, agriculture, visual resources, and coastal dependent and in- dustrial development. In essence, these policies are the rules for future growth and development in the coastal zone. The Act also attempts to establish a framework for resolving conflicts among competing uses for limited coastal lands. The policies which spell out priority uses constitute this framework. The Coastal Act places as its highest priority the preservation and protection of natural resources in- cluding environmentally sensitive habitat areas, i.e., wetlands, dunes, and prime agricultural lands. In the case of habitat areas, only uses dependent on these resources are allowed within such areas. For agricultural land, the intent of the Act is to keep the maximum amount of prime land in produc- tion. On lands not suited for agricultural use, coastal dependent develop- ment (i.e., development that requires a site on or adjacent to the sea to be able to function at all) has the highest priority. Public recreational uses have priority on coastal sites which are not habitat areas and not need- ed for coastal dependent uses. For sites that are not reserved for habitat preservation, agriculture, coastal dependent uses, or public recreation, pri- vate development is permitted. However, visitor-serving commercial recreation has priority over private residential, general industrial and general commer- cial development. These priorities must be reflected in the land use plans prepared by local governments. -2- 1.3 IMPLEMENTATION Each of the 15 counties and 53 cities along the California coast is required by the Coastal Act to prepare a Local Coastal Program (LCP)., The LCP consists of \"a local government's land use plans, zoning ordinances, zoning district maps, and@implementing actions which, when taken together, meet the requirements of, and implement the provisions and policies of (the Coastal Act) at the local level.\" (30108.6') The land use plan means the 11relevant portions of a local government's general plan, or local coastal element,,which are sufficiently detai.led to indicate the kinds, location, and intensity of land uses, the applicable resource protection and devel- opment policies and, where necessary, a listing of implementing actions.\" (30108.5) The zoning ordinances and district maps are the legal tools for @implementing the land use plan. The Coastal Act also requires each LCP to 11contain a specific public access component to assure that.maximum access to the coast and publ'ic recreation areas is provided.\" (30500(a)) In - addition, the local land use plans are required to consider uses of more than local importance. (30501(c)) As-noted in the LCP Regulationsi* such uses generally include: (1) state and federal parks and recreation areas and other recreational facilities of regional or statewide significance; (2) military and national defense installations; (3) major energy facilities; (4) state and federal highways and other transportation.faci-lities (e.g., railroads and airports) or public works,facilit,ies (e.g., water supply or sewer-systems) serving larger-than-local needs; (5) general cargo ports and commercial fishing facilities; (6) state colleges and universities; and (7) uses of larger-than-local importance, such as coastal agriculture, fisheries, wildlife habitats, or uses that maximize public access to the coast, such as accessways, visitor-serving developments, as generally ref- erenced in the findings, declarations, and policies of the California Coastal' Act-of 1976. The land use plans and zoning, after receiving local review and approval, must be submitted to the Regional and State Coastal Commissions. The Com- missions must make the finding that the land use plan is consistent with the policies of Chapter 3 of the Act. The zoning and implementing ordinances are then reviewed to determine conformance with the approved land use plan. After certification of the land use plan and zoning components of the LCP, the review authority for new development within the coastal zone, which is now vested in the Coastal Commission, will be returned to local qovernment. The local government, in issuing coastal development permits after certifica- tion, must make the finding that the development is in conformity with the approved LCP. Any amendments to the LCP will have to be approved by the State Coastal Commission. After certification of the LCP's, the Regional Coastal Commissions will be phased out. The State Coastal Commission will, however, continue to *LCP Regulations, adopted by the Coastal Commission on May 17, 1977. -3- exercise permit jurisdiction over certain kinds of developments (i.e., dev- elopment in the State Tidelands), and will continue to hear appeals and review amendments to certified LCP's. Only certain kinds of developments can be appealed after a local government's LCP has been certified; these in- clude: (1.) Developments approved by the local government between the sea and the first public road paralleling the sea or within 300 feet of the inland extent of any beach or of the mean high tide line of the sea where there is no beach, whichever is the greater distance. (2) Developments approved by the local government not included within paragraph (1) of this subdivision located on tidelands, submerged lands, public trust lands, within 100 feet of any wetland, estuary, stream, or within 300 feet of the top of the seaward face of any coastal bluff. (3) Developments approved by the local government not included within paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision located in a sensitive coastal resource area if the allegation on appeal is that the development is not in conformity with the implementing actions of the certified local coastal program. M Any development approved by a coastal county that is not designated as the principal permitted use under the zoning ordinance or zoning district map approved pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Sec- tion 30500). (5) Any development which constitutes a major public works project or a major energy facility. The State Commission is also required to review periodically the progress of local governments in carrying out the Coastal Act. This review is to occur at least once every five years. -4- CHAPTER 2: THE LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM (LCP) .2.1. THE COASTAL ZONE IN SANTA BABBABA COUNTY On the mainland, the coastal zone in Santa Barbara County spans 110 miles of coastline and includes approximately 184 square miles. In addition, the offshore islands of Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa are entirely within coastal jurisdiction. While the coastal zone boundary line generally extends inland only 1,000 yards, the Santa Barbara coastal zone extends further inland in several areas because of important habitat, recreational, and agricultural resources. These areas include the lands surrounding Guadalupe Dunes and Point Conception, and most of the Carpinteria Valley. The coastal zone of Santa Barbara County is world-renowned for its beauty and diversity. The South Coast is characterized by sandy beaches, bluffs, and coastal terraces. Urban development and agriculture have nestled along the narrow coastal shelf against the spectacular backdrop of the Santa Ynez Mountains. The coastline from Point Conception north to the Santa Maria River is rugged and rural, consisting of rolling hills, mountains, rocky head- lands, steep bluffs, and the extensive sand dunes between Mussel Point and the Santa Maria River. The Santa Barbara-County coastal zone, like so many other areas in Cal- ifornia, has a history of controversy over its,use and development. Many projects have been proposed for the coastal zone in recent years; some have been implemented and others have failed to obtain necessary public support. Some of the better-known proposals include Exxon's proposal for an oil pro- cessing plant at Las Flores Canyon and the residential development proposals for El Capitan and More Mesa. 'While Santa Barbara County has managed to maintain extensive areas of undeveloped coastline, it is clear that adopted plans and policies are not adequate to ensure wise management, development, and conservation of its coastline in the future. Stronger policies and appropriate land use desig- nations will be required to ensure protection of Santa Barbara County's out- standing scenic values and diverse habitat resources, preservation of prime agricultural lands, and provision of maximum opportunities for recreational use of its beaches while allowing for orderly growth and development. -5- 2.2 THE LCP PLANNING PBOCESS The land use plan has evolved in two phases. The first phase, January to June 1977, concentrated on developing a framework for involving the public and affected agencies in the planning process, preparing a sound data base for land use decisions related to recreation, access, and environmentally sensitive habitats, and included a preliminary study of greenhouses and ag- riculture in the Carpinteria Valley- .The second phase (July 1977 to November 1978) has involved actual prep- aration of the land use plan. Staff effort throughout these 16 months has been concentrated on Santa Barbara County's critical coastal planning issues: agriculture, environmentally sensitive habitats, energy development, shore- line access,, and recreation. Draft reports, which are on file at the Plan-' ning Department, were produced for all of the critical issues. Much of the background information in these draft reports is not repeated in the land use plan. Where possible., the information that has been developed for the land use plan has been translated into graphic form through a transparent overlay map- ping system. The overlays display geologic and flood hazards, habitat areas, soils, and other factors which are important in making land use decisions. Extensive opportunities for public involvement in the development of the land use plan have been provided. For example, special public workshops were held to discuss habitat areas, recreation, access, and energy issues. A four-session Coastal Planning Series was conducted in the spring of 1978, sponsored by the Continuing Education Division of Santa Barbara Community College. The Series provided an orientation session on requirements for land use planning under the Coastal Act, established the critical coastal issues, and included presentations on agriculture in the Carpinteria Valley, coastal recreation and access, energy development, and habitats. Early in the land use planning proQess, an Agricultural Advisory Committee was formed to assist staff in studying the complex nature of agriculture in the Carpin- teria Valley. The Committee met numerous times to critique LCP draft reports. Finally, the County's General Plan Advisory Committees have played an impor- tant role in the development of the land use plan. The Committees' land use des ignations contributed significantly to LCP staff decisions on appropriate land uses in the coastal zone. 6- 2.3 THE LAND USE PLAN The purpose of the land use plan is to protect coastal resources, pro- vide greater access and recreational opportunities-for the.public's enjoy- ment, while allowingfor orderly and we.ll-*planned-urban development and the. siting of coastal dependent industry. T.he-plan incorporates,- to the maximum possible extent, local plans and.policies.which are consistent with the Coas- tal, Act. Where inconsistencies have been identified, modifications and re- visions have been made. In general, the land use plan places a'stronger-em- phasis on expanding public access opportunities to the County's beaches, preserving prime agriculture land, and protecting environmentally sensitive habitats than is found in prevailing local policy. . The changes in existing land use regulations that are proposed in the plan are moderate. Ample provision has been made for continued growth and development within the bounds of the generally accepted one percent growth rate that has guided both the preparation of the County's Proposed Compre- hensive Plan and transportation plans, and served as the basis for project- ing future water needs. The land use designations within the plan can accom- modate new development through the year 2000, assuming that sufficient water resources are available. The plan does not, however, put forth provisions for phasing or controlling the rate of growth. There are too many factors external to the jurisdiction of the plan which would make such an undertak- ing tenuous at best. These include: State water importation, the County split, the Missile X program, the Space Shuttle, the proposed LNG facility, lease sale 48, and UCSB enrollment policies. The plan proposes that firm urban-rural boundaries be established which will have the effect of redirecting growth from an outward expansion to infilling. In this sense, the plan will result in more compact urban development, thereby assuring the long-term protection of surrounding agri- cultural lands and recreational resources. The land use plan has two components: the maps and the text. The land use plan maps show the kinds, location, and intensity of land uses proposed for the coastal zone of Santa Barbara County. The text explains the ration- ale for the land uses and establishes policies to guide future development. These local policies, along with the policies from Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act, will constitute the,decision rules for evaluating projects after cert- ification of the land use plan. The heart of the land use plan is Chapter 3, The Resource Protection and Development Policies. This chapter contains a discussion of each of the major policy sections of the Coastal Act, relevant issues and problems within the County's coastal zone, and the proposed policies and actions which respond to these issues. Chapter 4 is devoted to a more in-depth discussion of the planning @issues and problems in the seven planning areas within the coastal zone. Some additional policies and actions are recommended for each of these geographic sub-areas. Chapter 5 studies the availability of water resources, transportation, and wastewater treatment facilities with respect to the allowable build- out in the land use plan. It also provides a basis for comparing allowable development under existing zoning with the densities proposed in the land use plan. It is, of course, anticipated that the land use plan will need revision from time to time in accordance with changing conditions. The Coastal Act requires that certified plans be reviewed at least once every five years to determine whether the program is being effectively implemented in conformity with the policies of the Act. Local recommendations for revisions of the certified land use plan could be considered as part of the five-year review process or they could be initiated by the County at any time, subject to the approval. of the State Commission. -8- 2.4 THE LAND USE P AN MAPS The land use plan maps.reveal two levels of information. The base maps show principal land use designations such as agriculture, commercial, resi- dential, and industrial. The second level of information is contained in overlay maps. The.overlay maps illustrate specific information such as flood hazard areas, view corridors, environmentally sensitive habitats, and areas which require special site design. They are placed over the base maps as a means of showing where potential constraints on development may exist. The land use plan maps have been developed at two scales, one for the urbanized South Coast (Ellwood to Rincon) and another for the rural areas. The maps for the urbanized South Coast are at 500 scale (one inch = 500 feet). They provide enough detail for precise planning and zoning on a parcel-by- parcel basis. Such detail is not necessary in the rural areas where parcels are.generally largerand land use issues are not as complex. Therefore, 200 0 scale maps (one inch = 2000 feet) have been used for these areas. The key to the maps is the land use classification system (Table 2-1) which has been jointly developed by the LCP and Proposed Comprehensive Plan staffs. The land use classifications specify the principal permitted land uses within the coastal zone. Included in the land use classification sys- tem are the four \"overlay\" designations. Each of the land use classifications is defined in Appendix B of the land.use plan. Policies that are associated with the overlay designations, View Corridor, Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area, Flood Hazard, and Site Design, are included in Chapter 3.

The resource protection policies govern land resources, which include environmentally sensitive habitat areas and prime agricultural lands, recreational resources, the marine environment (i.e., streams, wetlands, and coastal waters), scenic resources such as views to and along the ocean, and air quality. The stress of these policies is on resource conservation. Coastal Act development policies govern all aspects of development including land divisions, industrial development, and new and/or expanded public works facilities. The emphasis of the development policies is on encouraging well-planned and orderly develop- ment which is compatible with resource protection and conservation. The text and the policies set forth in this chapter are, in many respects, the core of the land use plan. They establish the parameters for'evaluating development projects within the coastal zone, and set forth the measures that the County should take to achieve the degree of resource protection required by the Coastal Act. Furthermore, they will serve as the foundation for developing the ordinances that will implement the land use plan. The chapter is organized into major topics which reflect the principal coastal resource protection and development issues in Santa Barbara County. Each section is prefaced with pertinent policies from the Coastal Act and is followed by a discussion of local issues and problems related to the topic. The issues section attempts to pin- point where County practices and regulations fall short of, or conflict with, the provisions of the Coastal Act. Finally, each topic area is concluded with recommended policies to bring the County into conformity with the Coastal Act. 3.2 -DEVELOPMENT 3.2.1 COASTAL ACT POLICIES There are many sections of the Coastal Act that address, either directly or indirectly, the issue of devel.opment. Only those polici.es that.are-not addressed in other sections of the plan are included here. 30250. (a) New development, except as otherwise provided in this division, shall be located within, contiguous with, or in close proxi- mity to, existing developed areas able to accommodate it or, where such areas are not able to accommodate it, in other areas with adequate pub- lic services and where it will not have significant adverse effects, either individually or cumulatively, on coastal resources. In addition, land divisions, other than leases, for agricultural uses, outside exist- ing developed areas shall be permitted only where 50 percent of the us- able parcels in the area have been developed and the created parcels would be no smaller than the average size of surrounding parcels. (b) Where feasible, new hazardous industrial development shall be located away from existing developed areas. 30252. The loca Ition and amount of new development should maintain and enhance public access to the coast by: (1) facilitating the pro- vision or extension of transit service; (2) providing commercial facil- ities within or adjoining residential development or in other areas that will minimize the use of coastal access roads; (3) providing non- automobile circulation within the development; (4) providing adequate. parking facilities or providing substitute means of serving the devel- opment with public transportation; (5) assuring the potential for pub- lic-trans,it for high-intensity uses such as high-rise office buildings, and by (6)'assuring that the recreational needs of new residents will not overload nearby coastal.,recreation areas by correlating the amount of development with local park acquisition and development plans with the provision of on-site recreational facilities to serve the new de- velopment. 3.2.2 PLANNING ISSUES The policies of the'Coastal Act require that new development* be con- centrated within existing developed areas to avoid costly urban sprawl and to protect coastal resources, i.e., prime agricultural lands,.scenic quality of rural lands, habitat areas, etc. The Act specifies that development adjacent or proximate,to environmentally sensitive habitat areas be designed to avoid adverse impacts; that development be-sited so as to avoid risks to life and property due to natural hazards; and that coastal visual resources be protected by careful placement and design of new development. Each of these development-related issues is treated in subsequent sections of this chapter'. The Act also requires that public works facilities (water, sewer, *Refer to Appendix A for definition of development. 12- and roads) be adequate to serve new development; issues regarding service system capacities and availability of resources are addressed in Chapter 5. Concentrating New Development Coastal policies require that new development be 1ocated within, con- tiguous with, or in close proximity to-existing developed areas. In the County's coastal zone, urban development is currently concentrated on the South Coast from Ellwood east to the Ventura County line, with rural areas extending west of Ellwood and, to the east, encircling the urban areas of the City of Carpinteria and the community of Summerland. Concentrating new development in existing developed areas is, therefore, an issue for Carpin- teria, Summerland, and Goleta, given their adjacency to rural lands. Accord- ing to the Coastal Act, development should take place within these urban areas prior to expanding outward. As noted in the agriculture section of the plan, past urban expansion in Goleta and the Carpinteria Valley has re- sulted in.the conversion of much prime agricultural land. In order to pre- vent unnecessary conversions in the future, a stable urban/rural boundary is needed which clearly delineates areas for urban uses from those that are suited for agricultural or other rural uses. Within the rural lands of the Carpinteria Valley and Summerland, there exists a number of residential enclaves, known as Shepard's Mesa, Los Arcos, La Mirada, Ocean Oaks, Serena Park, Padaro Lane, and Sandyland. Boundaries for these neighborhoods need to be established which allow for completion of the neighborhood without encroachment onto surrounding agricultural lands. Land Divisions The Coastal Act requires that land divisions outside existing developed areas be permitted.only where 50 percent of the usable parcels in the area have.been developed and the created parcels would be no smaller than the average size of surrounding parcels. The rural lands of the North County coastline and from Gaviota to Ellwood are currently zoned for large parcel sizes, in most cases 100-acre minimums. Where subdivision to this minimum parcel size would not jeopardize agricultural ranching operations or con- tritute to pressures for introducing related urban uses, the 100-acre mini- ,mum is adequate for determining land divisions in rural areas and the 50 percent criterion is not needed. Similarly, a 40-acre minimum for prime lands in rural areas is adequate when agriculture is not threatened and ur- .ban pressures for premature conversion are not introduced. In other rural areas of the South Coast, existing zoning may permit division of land inconsistent with the 50 percent criterion. Larger lot zoning and other measures for the preservation of agriculture are needed in rural areas surrounding Carpinteria and Summerland to avoid the possib- ility of premature urbanization of rural lands. Availability of Services and Resources The Coastal Act requires that development be located in areas where adequate public services are available and where it would not have signifi- cant adverse affects on coastal resources, including depletion of groundwater -13- resources. The most immediate constraint to new development in the South Coast area is the lack of water resources.. Detailed discussion of resource constraints is deferred to Chapter 5 of the.plan. 3.2.3 POLICIES Policy 1: All development, including agriculture, adjacent to areas desig- nated on the land use plan maps as habitat areasi shall be reg- ulated to.avoid adverse i.mpacts on,habitat resources. Regulatory measures include, but are not limited to, setbacks, buffer zones, grading controls, noise restrictions, and maintenance of natural vegetation. Policy 2: In designated rural neighborhoods, lot splits shall be permitted for the purpose of infilling if the parcels created will be no smaller than the minimum parcel size stipulated for the neighbor- hood as shown on the land use plan maps. Policy 3: In designated residential ranchette and rural residential areas, a lot split shall be permitted if parcels created will be no smaller than the average size of the parcels located within a one-fourth-mile radius of the proposed lot split. Policy 4: Resource-conserving water devices shall be used in all new devel- opment. Policy 5: No new sewer extensions shall be allowed outside the designated urban boundary as defined on the land use plan maps. Policy 6: Within designated urban areas, new development, other than that for agricultural purposes, shall be serviced by the appropriate water and sewer district. Policy 7: Prior to issuance of a development permit, the County shall make the finding, based on information provided by environmental docu- ments, staff analyses, and the applicant, that adequate services (i.e., water, sewer, roads, etc.) and resources are available to serve the proposed development. The applicant shall assume full responsibility for costs incurred in service extensions or im- provements that are required as a result of the proposed project. Lack of available services or resources shall be grounds for denial of the project or reduction in the density otherwise in- dicated in the land use plan. Policy 8: The County shall reserve the right to reduce the density specified in the land use plan for a particular parcel if it is determined that such reduction is warranted by conditions specifically applic- able to the site,- such as topography, geologic or flood hazards, habitat areas, or steep slopes, particularly when such constraints are indicated by the overlay designations on the land use plan maps. -1-4- Policy 9: If a development is proposed for any of the major ranches in areas designated as rural on the land use plan maps, a clustered develop- ment shall be preferred to a standard subdivision into lots of equal size, i.e., 100-acre subdivision. Policy 10: In the furtherance of better water management, any private wells that are to be developed within the coastal zone for agricul- ture or other \"nondevelopment\" uses shall install a meter and maintain records on well extractions. Extraction records shall be submitted annually to the appropriate water district. 3.2.4 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT While the requirements of the Coastal Act regarding the location and intensity of development are addressed by the designations on the land use plan maps and general policy recommendations, these-requirements may not be adequate to ensure well-planned development of key parcels in the coastal zone. The principal threat to remaining large parcels that are intended for residential use is from piecemeal development. In order to ensure well-plan- ned and designed development of remaining, large, residentially designated parcels and preservation of coastal resources, site design requirements are needed. Site Desi;gn Over.lay Designation The purpose of the site design overlay designation is to ensure well- planned development of large, residentially designated lots that are subject to environmental constraints (i.e., geologic or flood hazards) or have im- portant resource values (habitats, scenic qualities, significant vegetation, archaeological resources, etc.). It is the intent of this designation to avoid the resource degradation that often results from piecemeal develop- ment of large lots. It is also the intent to allow for flexibility and in- novative design in the development of residential subdivisions. All devel- opment in areas designated in the land use plan with the Site Design Overlay shall be subject to the following policies: 1. The entire site shall be planned as a unit. Prior to approval of any lot splits or development, the applicant shall submit a site plan show- ing the ultimate development of the site, including lot lines and cir- culation pattern, and a general indication of the location of all resi- dential structures. This plan shall be reviewed by the Subdivision Committee and the.Planning Commission. 2. Use of flexible and innovative design concepts, including clustering of units, mixture of dwelling types, etc., shall be encouraged to accomplish any of the following goals: a) protection of the scenic qualities of the site; b) protection of coastal resources, i.e., habitats, streams, arch- aeological sites, etc.; c) avoidance of siting of structures on hazardous areas; and d) provision of public open space, recreation, or beach access. 3. Permitted uses shall include: a) residential units, either attached or detached, b) recreational facilities, including but not limited to tennis courts, swimming pools, playgrounds, and parks for the private use of the prospective residents, c) open space, -16- And in developments of 200 residential units or greater, conditionally permitted uses include: d) commercial recreational facilities (private or public) that are compatible with the proposed residential units, e) convenience establishments of a commercial and service nature, including stores, laundry, and dry-cleaning agencies and establish- ments, beauty shops, barber shops, and the like (but specifically excluding gas stations, repair garages,, and drive-in eating and drinking establishments) provided: 1. such-convenience establishments are an integral part of the general plan of development for the Planned Residential Development and provide facilities related to the needs of the prospective residents. 2. such convenience establishments and their parking areas will not collectively occupy more than one (1) acre per two hundred (200) dwelling units. 3. suc h convenience establishments will be located, designed, and operated to primarily serve trade and service needs of persons residing in the Planned Residential Development and not persons residing elsewhere. 4. such convenience establishments will not by reason of their location, construction, manner or timing of operations, signs, lighting, parking arrangements, or other characteristics have .adverse effects on residential uses within or adjoining the development, or create traffic congestion or hazards to vehic- ular or pedestrian traffic. 5. no building permit for any convenience establishment shall be issued before at least one hundred (100) dwelling units are constructed within the development. 4. Open Space: The amount of public, private, and common open space shall be spec- ified in the development plan. a) Public open space shall include public parks, beaches, access corri- dors such as bike paths, hiking or equestrian trails, usable nat- ural areas, and vista points which are accessible to members of the general public. Public open space shall not include areas which are unusable for recreational purposes, i.e., private or public streets, parking lots, hazardous areas such as steep slopes and bluff faces, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, archaeological sites, etc. b) Common open space shall include recreational areas and facilities for the use of the prospective residents of the project such as tennis courts, swimming pools, playgrounds, community gardens, or other open areas of the site needed for the protection of habitat, -17- archaeological, scenic, or other resources. Common open space shall not include driveways, parking lots, private patios, or other developed areas. c) Private open space shall include patios, decks, and yards for- the private use of the residents of individual units. Amount of Open Space: The required amount of common open space within a Planned Residential Development shall be at least twenty (20) percent of the gross area. The County shall determine the amount of public open space required for coastal access and rec- reation and protection of public view, if not specified elsewhere in this plan, but in no case shall it be less than twenty (20) percent of,the gross area. NOTE: Refer to Sections 4.4 and 4.5 for additional requirements,for Hammond's Meadow, More Mesa, and Santa Barbara Shores. 3.3 HAZARDS 3.3.1 COASTAL ACT POLICIES 30253. -New development shall: (1) Minimize risks to life and property in areas of high geologic flood, and fire hazard. (2) Assure stability and structural-integrity, and neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion, geologic instability', or destruction of the site or surrounding area or inany way require the construction of protective devices that would substantially alter nat- ural landforms along.bluffs and cliffs. 30235. Revetments, breakwaters, groins, harbor channels, seawalls, cliff-retaining walls, and other such construction that alters natural shoreline processes shall be permitted when required to serve,cdastal- dependent uses or to protect existing structures or public beaches in danger from erosion and when designed to eliminate or mitigate ad- verse'impacts on local shoreline sand supply. Existing marine struc- Aures causing water stagnation contributing to pollution problems and fishkills should be phased out or 'Upgraded where feasible. 30236. Channelization's, dams, or other substantial alterations of rivers and streams shall incorporate the best mitigation measures fea- sible, and'be limited to (1) necessary water supply projects; (2) flood control projects where no other method for protecting existing structures in the flood plain is feasible and where such protection is necessary for public safety or to protect existing development, or; (3) develop- ments where the primary function is the improvement of fish and wild- life habitat. 3.3.2 PLANNING ISSUES Recent events have provided strong evidence of the vulnerability of certain coastal areas to natural hazards. Following saturating rains in the winter of 1978, large sections of the cliff face in Isla Vista fell into the sea, threatening several apartments.; soil slippage caused a road wash- out in the community of Summerland; severe erosion occurred in graded areas above Summerland; several bluff-top homes slid into the sea in neighboring Santa Barbara; and flooding and heavy wave action damaged some homes along Miramar Beach. Also in 1978, an earthquake disrupted a rail line in the Ellwood area, produced numerous bluff slides and fissures along the South Coast, and caused considerable.structural damage in the surrounding areas. The Coastal Act requires that the risks to'-new development from such occurrences be minimized. Moreover, it specifies that new development must be located and built neither to \"create nor contribute significantly to ero- sion, geologic instability, or destruction of the site or surrounding area or in any way require the construction of protective devices that would sub- stan*tially alter natural landforms along bluffs and cliffs.\". The County has an array.of policies and'regulations within its zoning, grading, and fire ordinances, and bui'lding code which address many of the _19- concerns of the Coastal Act. In addition, Santa Barbara County has under- taken public works projects in recent years which now protect large areas that were previously vulnerable to flooding. Extensive creek channeliza- tions in the Carpinteria Valley and the construction of upstream debris dams are two recent examples. However, in spite of measures currently imposed by the County, recent problems with bluff top development and severe erosion in certain hillside agricultural areas suggests that more stringent controls are needed. Bluff and Beach Erosion Bluff erosion is a potential hazard for new development and continues to be a recurring hazard for existing development in portions of the South Coast. The bluff areas along Del Playa Drive in Isla Vista, sections of More Mesa and Hope Ranch, and areas along,Channel Drive and Padaro Lane are all subject to hazards due to bluff erosion. Because of this recurring threat, many retaining walls, groins, and sections of rip-rap have been needed to protect life and property. In the aftermath of the 1978 winter, property owners have initiated additional protective measures, such as major seawall projects proposed for Isla Vista and Padaro Lane. The County's policy on bluff development is handled on a case-by-case basis except in Isla Vista. In Isla Vista, a 30-foot setback requirement exists. It is based on an engineering study that was undertaken in 1963 to.determine cliff stability and related problems in the Isla Vista area. The study identified an average \"natural\" rate of cliff retreat at six in- ches per year and recommended that a value of twice the apparent retreat , rate (12 inches)-per year be applied for safety purposes, along with spec- ific site drainage requirements. Assuming an average \"economic life\" of 30 years per structure, the County developed the 30-foot setback for the area. The inadequacy of the present requirements with respect to the Coastal Act is apparent in Isla Vista, since new \"protective devices\" which may sub- stantially alter natural landforms along bluffs and cliffs are now necessary to protect property. Bluff areas adjacent to development at More Mesa have been eroding at an average rate of ten inches per year, while along a section of Padaro Lane bluff losses of up to two feet per year have been reported. These examples provide additional evidence why County setback standards should be strength- ened in order to eliminate the possibility of needing new \"protective de- vices\" in areas where future development may occur. While serious beach erosion occurred during the winter storms of 1978, damage was localized and temporary in most cases. Heavy river and stream flows replenished much of the losses. Existing and proposed flood control projects are not considered to have a significant impact on sand supply to the beaches that would require corrective measures. Geologic Hazards Geologic hazards include-seismic hazards (surface ruptures, liquefac- tion, severe ground shaking', t@sunami runup), landslides, soil erosion, -20- expansive soils, and subsidence. Since these hazards can affect both life and property, additional siting criteria or special engineering measures are needed to compensate for these hazards. The entire South Coast lies in an area of high seismic risk. Seismic, landslide, and tsunami hazards have been mapped by the.County and are used by the Public Works Department to review development proposals. Where faults are identifiable, the County Public Works Department has been generally re- quiring a 50-foot setback from the fault, though precise setback decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. In addition, geologic and soil engineer- ing reports may be required under'Grading Ordinance No. 1795 for obtaining a grading permit. These reports are used to identify geologic and soil problems and to establish conditions for siting and constructing structures where hazards or problems exist. With the exception of a slope hazard area behind Summerland, problems due to slope instability.are generally confined to areas outside of the proposed urban development limits set forth in the land use plan. 'Although the coastal zone between Ellwood and Point Arguello is either hilly or moun- tainous with variable and complex geologic conditions, only low-intensity, nonurban land uses will be located in this area. Consequently, slope-related hazards will be minimized. Soil erosion is a slope-related hazard which has become more proble- matic in recent years because of extensive agricultural development on slopes of 30 percent or more. A recent study conducted by the Agricultural Unit of the Regional Water Quality Control Board documents severe erosion in some areas of the South Coast where new orchards are being established. The Co- unty Grading Ordinance No. 1795 (as amended by Ordinance No. 2770) exempts farming and agricultural grading operations on parcels zoned exclusively for agricultural use which are larger than five acres from obtaining a grading permit. However, the County's Brush Removal Ordinance (No. 2767), which applies to the South Coast, does regulate removal of vegetation on parcels over five acres in size, and requires a permit and approval of drainage and erosion control devices-before agricultural grading commences. Flooding Flooding has occurred along Santa Barbara's South Coast in recent ye ars, particularly in the Carpinteria Valley, sections of Montecito, and the Santa Barbara airport area. Severe floods in 1969 undermined a section of U. S. 101 in Montecito. These flood hazards are progressively being eliminated in the populated portions of Carpinteria Valley and other areas of the South Coast as a result of stream channelizations and the construction of debris dams and silt basins by the Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, the U. S. Corps of Engineers, and by the U. S. Soil Conservation Service. The U. S. Department-of Housing and Urban Development through the Nat- ional Flood Insurance Program has investigated the existence and severity of flood hazards in the unincorporated areas of Santa Barbara County. One of the objectives of this study is to provide information to local planners in promoting sound land use and flood plain management. The Federal Insur- ance Administration has adopted the 100 year flood (the flood having a one -21- percent chance of being equalled or exceeded in any given year) as the nat- ional standard for purposes of flood plain management. The 100-year \"flood plain\" is comprised of a \"floodway\" and a \"floodway fringe\". The floodway is the channel of a stream, plus any adjacent flood plain areas, which must be kept free of encroachment in order that the 100-year flood be carried without substantial increases in flood heights. As minimum standards, in- creases in flood heights are limited to 1.0 foot, provided that hazardous velocities are hot produced. The areas between the floodway and the bound- ary of the 100-year flood is termed the floodway fringe. This area encom- passes that portion of the flood plain that could be completely obstructed without increasing the water surface elevation of the 100-year flood more than 1.0 foot at any point. County Flood Combining Regulations, administered by the Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, regulate construction, excavation, and grading in a \"designated\" floodway. The designated floodway, as defined in Ordinance No. 661, only includes \"land reasonably required to provide for the construction of a flood control project for passage of a flood against which protection is provided or eventually will be provided by said project including land necessary for construction of project levees.\" Thus, the restrictions are not as comprehensive as those recommended by HUD. In addition, the \"FH\" Flood Hazard Combining Regulations currently apply only to areas in Carpinteria and Goleta, along Atascadero Creek, and the Goleta Slough. New regulations covering all development within the 100-year flood plains, Countywide, have been formulated. The Flood Hazard Area Ordinance is currently in the process of being adopted in order to comply with the re- quirements of the HUD-sponsored Federal Flood Insurance Program in which this County is participating. Fire Areas of moderate fire hazard within urban areas of the coastal zone are restricted to hilly sections of the Carpinteria Valley and Summerland. High fire conditions also exist west of Ellwood in rural areas of the coas- tal zone. Developments within any of the hazardous zones in rural areas will be very low density and subject to stringent building, brush clear- ance, access, and water storage capacity restrictions (for fire suppression purposes) by the County Fire Department and/or the U. S. Forest.Service. 3.3.3 POLICIES Seawalls and Shoreline Structures Policy 1: Where seawalls are required for the protection of existing devel- opment, seawall design and construction shall respect, to the degree possible, natural land forms. Policy 2: Where seawalls are required for the protection of existing devel- opment, they shall not impede lateral beach access and should be designed,,to the degree possible, to minimize visual impacts by use of appropriate colors and materials. -22- Po I icy .3: Revetments, groins, cliff retaining walls, and other such con- struction that alter natural shoreline processes shall be per- mitted when designed to e1iminate or mitigate adverse impacts on local shoreline sand supply and so as to not block lateral beach access. Policy 4: To avoid the need for future protective devices that could impact sand movement and supply, no permanent structures shall be per- mitted on the dry sandy beach except facilities necessary for public health and safety, such as lifeguard towers. Bluff Protection Policy 5: In areas of new development, no structure shall be located within 50 feet of the bluff edge. Additional setback requirements may be imposed by the Santa Barbara County Public Works or Planning Departments on a case-by-case basis if necessary to avoid hazards or visual impacts on public beaches. Policy 6: Within this 50-foot setback, natural vegetation shall be main- tained unless it is to be replaced with landscaping consisting of native species. Grading,. as may be required to establish proper drainage or install land scaping, and minor improvements that do not impact public views or bluff stability may be per- mitted. Policy 7: Development and activity of any kind beyond the 50-foot minimum bluff top setback shall be constructed to insure that all surface and subsurface drainage shall not contribute to the erosion of the bluff face or the stability of the bluff itself. Policy 8: No development shall be permitted on the bluff face, except for ehjineered,staircases or accessways to provide public beach access. Drainpipes shall be allowed only where no other less environmentally damaging drain system is feasible and the drain- pipes are designed and placed to minimize impacts to the bluff ,face, toe, and beach. Drainage devices extending over the bluff face shall not be permitted if the property can be.drained away from the bluff face. Geologic Hazards Due to the presence of earthquake faults, the entire South Coast area lies within a high seismic hazard zone. Within this area, known faults, tsunami runup areas, and landslide areas are mapped. (These maps are on file at the County Department of Public Works.) The following policies shall apply in addition to the regulations and performance standards estab- lished in the County Grading Ordinance, No. 1795, Chapter 21 of the County Code governing subdivisions, and the Uniform Building Code as modified by Ordinance No. 2913. Policy 9: Applications for grading and,building permits, and applications for subdivision shall be reviewed for adjacency to, threats from, -23- and impacts on geologic hazards arising from seismic events, tsunami runup, landslides, beach erosion, or other geologic haz- ards such as expansive soils and subsidence areas. Mitigation measures shall be applied where necessary. Policy 10: Utility transmission lines which cross fault zon es, including water, gas, sewer, electrical, or crude oil, shall be subject to additional safety standards, such as emergency shutoff, where applicable. Policy 11: All structures shall be sited a minimum of 50 feet from a histor- ically active fault, active fault, or fault zone. Greater set- backs may be required if local geologic conditions warrant. Flood Hazard Area Overlay Desiqnation The intent of the Flood Hazard Area Designation is.to avoid exposing new developments to flood hazard and reduce the need for future flood con- trol protective works and resulting alteration of.stream and wetla6d envir- onments by regulating development within the 100-year flood plain. The flood hazard areas designated on the overlay maps fall within the 100-year flood zone boundaries as mapped by the Federal Insurance Administration (U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development).* An up-to-date set of the HUD maps is available for inspection in the County Flood Control Dis- trict Office. All development in designated flood hazard areas shall be reviewed by County Flood Control for conformance with the following policies: 1. All development, including construction, excavation, and grading, except for flood control projects and non-structural agricultural uses, shall be prohibited in the floodway unless off-setting im- provements in accordance with HUD regulations are provided. If the proposed development falls within the floodway fringe, devel- opment may'be permitted, provided creek setback requirements are met and finish floor elevations are above the projected 100-year flood elevation, as specified in the Flood Hazard Area Ordinance. 2. Permitted development shall not cause or contribute to flood hazards or lead to expenditure of public funds for flood control works, i.e., dams, stream channelizations, etc. 3.3.4 HILLSIDE AND WATERSHED PROTECTION Coastal Act Policies In addition to Section 30253 which requires that new development neither create nor contribute significantly to erosion, the Act requires that bio- logical productivity and quality of coastal waters, streams, and wetlands be maintained and that development be sited to minimize alteration of natural landforms. *HUD flood hazard mapping has not been completed for all areas of the Cou nty. The streams on the urbanized South Coast area have been studied in detail. Information on flood hazards in other areas of the coastal zone is not as comprehensive. -24- 30231. The biological productivity and the quality of coastal waters, streams, wetlands, estuaries, and lakes appropriate to maintain optimum populations of marine organisms and for the pro- tection of human health shall be maintained and, where feasible, restored through, among other means, minimizing adverse effects of waste water discharges and entrainment, controlling runoff, prevent- ing depletion of ground water supplies and substantial interference with surface waterflow, encouraging waste water reclamation, main- taining natural vegetation buffer areas that protect riparian habi- tats, and minimizing alteration of natural streams. 30251. The scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas shall be considered and protected as a resource of public importance. Permitted development shall be sited and designed to protect views to and along the ocean and scenic.coastal areas, to minimize the alteration of natural land forms, to be visually compatible with the character of surrounding areas, and, where feasible, to restore and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas. Implementation of these sections of the Act will require regulation of devel- opment on hillsides and watersheds. Background Disturbance of hillsides* and watershed lands\" can result in the lost of soil and slope stability as-well as increased erosion. The removal of vegetation deprives the soil of the stabilizing function of.roots and this loss of soil stability increases erosion and thus lowers downstream water quality as a result of siltation. Wetlands and streams are particularly impacted by increased siltation. Heavy rains on unstable slopes can pro- duce landslides, slumps, and flaws, especially in steeply s loping areas., Disturbance of hillsides and watershed lands by development may also alter the natural drainage pattern and thus produce increased runoff and erosion. Removal of vegetative.cover decreases percolation of precipitation into the soil, thereby reducing the amount of groundwater recharge and add- ing water to runoff that would ordinarily be transpired by trees and shrubs. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roads and buildings, also de- creases the amount of groundwater percolation and increases the amount of runoff. Increased runoff, in addition to producing intensified erosion, creates downstream flood hazards. Moreover, runoff from land surfaces is often contaminated with a variety of industrial, agricultural, commercial, or household residues. The most serious pollution problems often result from persistent erosion of soil, from fertilizers and biocides applied to the land, and from nutrients and toxic substances in watershed discharges. Estuaries are the termini.for coastal watershed drainage systems and there- fore such substances tend to concentrate in them. *Hillsides are.defined as lands with slopes exceeding 20 percent. **Watersheds are-defined as lands which have potential for impacts on coastal streams, wetlands, estuaries, and groundwater basins through runoff and per- colation. -25- Disturbance of hillside and watershed lands can result in high costs to a community. For example, degradation of hillsides as a result of erosion, landslides, and loss of vegetation can reduce scenic values, de- crease real estate values, and impact the tourist industry. In addition, poorly designed and constructed hillsi-de developments can frequently result in substantial costs to the public, either for repairs or for protective measures to prevent further damage. Increased runoff and sedimentation from denuded hillsides require increased public expenditures for flood con- trol and storm water management. Decreased biological productivity of coastal streams and wetlands has even farther-ranqinq Public costs. Protection of hill sides and watersheds is, therefore, necessary to 1) minimize risks to life and property from flooding, slope failure, and landslides; 2) insure continued biological productivity of coastal streams and wetlands; 3) protection of groundwater resources; and 4) preservation of scenic values. Policies In order to ensure the long-term preservation of the biological produc- tivity of streams and wetlands, protection of visual resources, and the avoidance of hazards to life and property, the following policies shall apply to all construction and development, including roads, on slopes greater than 20 percent and on lands within the watershed of any coastal stream or wetland. Policy 1: Plans for development shall minimize cut and fill operations. Plans requiring excessive cutting and filling may be denied if it is determined that the development could be carried out with less alteration of the natural terrain. Policy 2: All development shall.be designed to fit the site topography, soils, geology, hydrology, and any other existing conditions and be oriented so that grading and other site preparation is kept to an absolute minimum. Natural features, such as trees, shall be preserved to the maximum extent feasible. Areas of the site which are not suited to development because of known soil, geologic, flood, erosion or other hazards shall remain in open space. Policy 3: Mass grading shall not be permitted. For necessary grading operations, the smallest practical area of land shall be exposed at any one time during development, and the length of exposure shall be kept to the shortest practicable amount of time. Policy 4:' Sediment basins (including debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps) shall be installed in conjunction with the initial grading operations and maintained through the development process to remove sediment from runoff waters. All sediment shall be retained on site. Policy 5: Temporary vegetation, seeding, mulching, or other suitable stab- ilization method sha-11 be used to protect soils subject to erosion that have been disturbed during grading or development. All cut -26- and fill slopes shall be stabilized as soon as possible with planting of native annual grasses and shrubs, appropriate non- native plants, or with-accepted landscaping practices. Policy 6: Provisions shall be made to conduct surface water to storm drains or suitable watercourses to prevent erosion. Drainage devices shall be designed to accommodate increased runoff re- sulting from modified soil and surface conditions as a result of development. Water runoff shall be retained on-site when- ever possible to facilitate groundwater recharge. Policy 7: Degradation of the water quality of groundwater basins shall not result from development of the site. Pollutants, such as chemicals, fuels, lubricants, raw sewage, and other harmful waste, shall not be discharged into or alongside coastal streams either during or after construction. Policy 8: All development within the coastal zone shall be subject to the slope density curve (Plate A) of the County Zoning Ordinance No. 661 (Article VII, Section 20).. However, in no case shall structures be sited on slopes exceeding 40 percent. -27- 3.4 VISUAL BESOUBCES 3.4.1 COASTAL ACT POLICIES 30251. The scenic and visual qualities of coastal areas shall be considered and protected as a resource of public importance. Permitted development shall be sited and designed to protect views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas, to minimize the alteration of nat- ural land forms, to be visually compatible with the character of sur- rounding areas, and, where feasible, to restore and enhance visual quality in visually degraded areas. New development in highly scenic areas such as those designated in the California Coastline Preservation and Recreation Plan.prepared by the Department of Parks and Recreation and by local government shall be subordinate to the character of its setting. 3.4.2 PLANNING ISSUES The.scenic resources of Santa Barbara's coastal zone are of incalcul- able value to the economic and social. well-being of Santa Barbara County. The beauty of the Santa Barbara coastline is world-renowned; it is the basis of the County's strong tourist and retirement economies and is a source of continuing pleasure for the local populace. The visual resources of the coastal zone include its beaches, sand dunes, coastal bluffs, headlands, wetlands, estuaries, islands, hillsides and can- yons, upland terraces and plains, and its rivers and streams. These resour- ces are vulnerable to degradation through improper location and scale of building development, blockage of coastal views, alteration of natural land forms by poor cutting, grading, and filling practices, and by poor design or 'placement of roadside signs and utility lines. The primary concern of the Coastal Act is to protect views to these scenic resources from public areas such as highways, roads, beaches, parks, coastal trails and accessways, and vista points. Local policies which have visual resource implications are developed in the County's zoning, subdivision, and other ordinances. These include the Beach Development (BD) and the Exclusive Agriculture (A-14) zone re- strictions, Ordinance #2188 governing the County's Board of Architectural Review (BAR), Division 8 of the County's Subdivision Ordinance pertaining to Special Treatment Areas, and County Sign Ordinance #2077. The \"BY zone is in effect from Jalama to Ellwood and in Summerland. it is intended to \"preserve and protect.a. limited natural resource, ocean beaches; ... to control construction of developments at sea level that may be threatened by destruction from ocean storms; to control construction on bluffs which may be threatened by collapse of beach bluffs caused by erosion, slides, or slippage of such bluffs; and to control the construction of sea walls and groins which might disrupt the littoral drift of sand along the coastline and cause erosion in the vicinity of such walls and groins.\" In general, the restrictions of the \"BD\" zone,serve to limit construction on beaches to recreational facilities and establish a 15-foot or one story building height maximum for structures. Such restrictions have indirect -28- visual resource protection implications since they reduce unnecessary devel- opment on beaches and control the scale of permitted developments. However, the zone does not assure that permitted development is sited and designed to protect views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas or that it is visually compatible with the character of the surrounding areas as re- quired by the Coastal Act. This is because the zone extends inland only to the bluff line and therefore.does not affect residential structures on top of the bluffs. In addition, the fact that the \"BD\" zone allows development on the beach for other than public safety and welfare purposes appears to be incompatible with the intent of the Coastal Act. .Views of scenic bluffs from beaches are no t protected by the \"BD\" zone, nor are they protected by blufftop setback requirements developed by the Public Works Department. The latter establishes a setback of 30 feet in Isla Vista (see Section 3.3 on Hazards) and on a case-by-case basis else- where. These setback regulations were formulated for safety purposes with- out regard to visual considerations. The County's \"A-14,\" Exclusive Agricultural Zone, does address some of the visual problems associated with greenhouse development in the Carpin- teria Valley. The zoning standards require that hothouses, greenhouses, or other plant-protection structures be set back at least 50 feet from the cen- terline of any street and require landscaping which, within five years, will \"reasonably block the view of any structures and on-site parking areas from outside of the property.\" Landscaping along all streets is also a require- ment of the A-14 zone, but the degree of view blockage is not specified. While the,A-1-X zone does attempt to subdue the visual impacts of green- houses and hothouses, the degree of protection provided does not assure visual compatibility with the rural character of the Valley, especially as seen by the passerby along the Valley's rural roads. County building height standards, which in most zones permit two story structures of up to 35 feet in height, are not necessarily sensitive to visual resource protection. For example, a building of 35 feet located on a low coastal bluff sot back 30 or 50 feet can be highly visible from many vantage points along a beach, and may consequently degrade'the natural scenic value of the bluff. Further setbacks and/or height restrictions are needed to ensure protection of views. The County's Board of Architectural Review (BAR) process is sensitive to visual resource concerns, including building mass, relationship of build- ings to topography, and-compatibility of buildings with the immediate area, but BAR's jurisdiction is limited, since not all zones are subject to re- view.@ Only areas which fall under \"D\", Design Supervision Combining Regu- lations, are under review bythe County's Board of Architectural Review, although Summerland, Hope Ranch, Hollister Ranch, and the Embarcadero tract have their own review committees. While the \"Y designation is in effect for many critical undeveloped parcels in the coastal'zone, there are large vacant waterfront parcels which are not currently subject to design review. Furthermore, BAR policy does not contain language which encourages the pro- tection of views to and along the ocean and scenic coastal areas nor the \"restoration and@enhancement of visual quality in visually degraded areas.\" While these concerns may be operative in practices of the BAR, they are not spelled out in the BAR's \"Standards of Architectural Review.\" -29- The \".Special Treatment\" section of the County's Subdivision Ordinance contains policies which are directed to the protection of hillsides as a visual resource. This section notes that extensive hillside areas in the County dominate the view from the most heavily travelled and highly devel- oped areas. Many of.these same areasare subject to building construction and grading operations or the removal of the native cover which can substan- tially affect the natural scenic background for such travelled and developed areas. The \"Special Treatment\" section recommends that subdivisions and other developments \"shall be designed to preserve, to the extent which is reasonable and feasible, the natural appearance of extensive hillsides.\" it instructs the Subdivision Committee to require grading which preserves the natu'ral..contours of land,', retain trees and other native vegptation,.. minimize road cut scarring, reduce grading, and establish landscaping to conceal raw-cut slopes. Though the scope and purpose of the \"Special Treatment\" area would appear consistent with the policies of the Coastal. Act, no special treatment areas have'been designated to date. The Recreational District is another existing zoning policy which ac- knowledges the importance of visual resources, though it too has not been used to date. The purpose of the District is to protect and-enhance areas which have both active and passive recreation potential because of their beauty and natural features. It would restrict building heights to 2.5 stories, establish bluff setbacks of 50'feet when a bluff is more than 50 feet in height, and require Board of Architectural review for development proposed within the zone. The County Sign Ordinance No. 2077 it sensitive to the visual impacts of signs. The effect of the ordinance is to subordinate signs to man-made and natural features. One of the.significant features of the ordinance is its restrictions on billboards. Billboards are categorized.as an \"off- premise\" sign and allowed only in heavyindustrial and heavy commercial dis- tricts. Length and width limitations set forth in the ordinance are smaller than the standard billboard sign. A number of billboards do exist in the County coastal zone which, due to their size and location, impact on coastal visual resources. These signs are located on the upland terrace shelf north of Highway 101, between Ellwood and Gaviota; their legal status expires in May 1979. 3.4.3 POLICIES AND ACTIONS Policy 1: All residential developments of three units or greater and all commercial, industrial, and recreational development shall be required to obtain plan approval from the County Board of Architectural Review. Policy 2: Bluff top development shall be set back from the bluff edge sufficiently far to insure that the development does not infringe on views from the beach except in urban areas where structures on both sides of the proposeddevelopment already impact public views from the beach. In such cases, the development shall not be lo- cated closer to the edge of the bluff than the adjacent structures. Policy 3: Off-premise signs shall be prohibited in the coastal zone. -30- Policy 4: Utilities, including television, shall be placed underground in new developments except where cost of undergrounding would be so high as to deny service. Action 1: The County shall develop design criteria for protection of visual resources in the coastal zone. These guidelines shall address issues related to scale, height, materials, colors, and landscap- ing and provide specific criteria and standards for development sited on visual resources, i.e., bluffs, dunes, hillsides, etc. These guidelines shall provide a reference for developers in de- signing projects and be used by the County Board of Architectural. Review and other local design review committees in evaluating projects in the coastal zone. NOTE: There are policies in other sections of the plan which, if implemented, will result in protection of coastal visual resources. These include policies for the preservation of habitat resources (Section 3.9) and protection of .bluffs, hillsides, and watersheds (Section 3.3). 3.4.4 VIEW CORRIDOR OVERLAY DESIGNATION A view corridor overlay designation has been created for the purpose of protecting areas of the coast where development may block or impede views from a major public road to the ocean. All development in areas designated by a View Corridor Overlay in the land use plan shall be reviewed by the County Board of Architectural Review for conformance to the following poli- cies: 1. The develo pment shall be sited and designed so as to minimize obstruc- tion of public views to the ocean. 2. Development shall be clustered to the maximum extent feasible. 3. Structures shall be screened with appropriate landscaping; however, such landscaping should not, when mature, impede public views. 4. Building height shall not exceed one story or 15 feet, unless an increase in height would facilitate clustering of development and result in great- er view protection, or a height in excess of 15 feet would not impact public views to the ocean. -31- 3. 5 HOUSING 3.5.1 COASTAL ACT POLICIES Section 3021j. Lower cost visitor and recreational facilities and housing opportunities for persons of low and moderate income shall be protected, encouraged, and, where feasible, provided. ... New housing in the coastal zone shall be developed in conformity with the standards, policies, and goals of local housing elements adopted in accordance with the requirements of,subdivision (c).of Section 65302 of the Gov- ernment Code. 3.5.2 PLANNING ISSUES The coastal area of Santa Barbara County is an especially desirable place to live. People of all economic sectors have chosen to locate in this area, particularly in the urbanized areas of the South Coast, and t:his has created a wide diversity of life styles and * housing needs. As housing costs have soared in recent years, accommodating the housing needs of all economic levels has@become an important local issue, evidenced by concern over rent control, interest in condominium conversions, and formation of housing co- operatives. The housi ng'policies of the Coastal Act focus primarily on the needs of persons of low and moderate income. Within the County's coastal zone, substantial housing opportunities for low and moderate income households currently exist in areas such as Summerland and Isla Vista; these opportun- ities need to be protected. In these and-other segments of the coastal zone, new low and moderate income housing units need to be provided as well. At present, the County is addressing the housing needs of persons of low and moderate income primarily through the Federal rent subsidy program ad- ministered by the County Housing Authority and proposed housing rehabili- tation programs through Community Development Block Grant funding. Addi- tional County housing policies for the.coastal zone will * be necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Coastal Act, a.s will be borne out in the following discussion of the housing issues and recommended policies for ad- dressing them. Protecting Existing Low and Moderate Income Housing Opportunities The Coastal Act requires that existing low and moderate income housing opportunities be protected. Many of these housing opportunities are found in multiple-.unit apartment complexes and in older residential neighborhoods where the housing stock, including both single family and multiple units, is often in poor condition. Removal of these housing opportunities, either through c*onversion:of comparatively lower cost apartment rentals to more expensive owner-occupied units or demolition of existing units, can displace low and moderate income people if adequate housing alternatives are not available withi n the loca 1 area*. Rehabi I i tati on In several areas of the coastal zone fr om Ellwood to Carpinteria, e.g., Isla Vista, portions of Goleta, and,Summerland, a large proportion of the _32- existing housing stock is in need of major repair. This finding is based on a County-wide Housing Condition Survey completed in June 1977, which provided the County with an inventory of exterior housing conditions. Ac- cording to this survey, forty-one percent (41%) of the single family resi- dences in Summerland are in need of rehabilitation (\"C\" condition; see Appendix A). These older, rehabitable dwelling units which provide sub- stantial housing opportunities for low and moderate income households need to be preserved. The County has applied for Community Development Block Grant funding for a \"pilot\" housing rehabilitation program in Summerland and Carpinteria which, if approved, would become effective in 1979. These and other reha- bilitation efforts need to be encouraged to protect existing low and mod- erate income housing opportunities. Demolition and Replacement of Existing Low and Moderate Income Housing Units Demolition of dilapidated housing (\"D\" condition) is sometimes required for health'and safety reasons, resulting in the displacement of low or mod- erate income households. This is particularly a problem in rental situations . In some cases, replacement of the low and moderate income units that have been removed is necessary to protect housing opportunities. A determination of the number of units to be replaced needs to be made on a case-by-case basis, reflecting the housing needs of the community. In other instances, a land use other than residential may be preferred following removal. For example, pockets of low income housing off of South Fairview Avenue in Gol- eta are located under the flight line of the airport and intermingled with commercial and industrial uses; because of health and safety considerations and incompatibility with adjacent uses, commercial or industrial land use may be better here. In such cases, it will be necessary to replace the low and moderate income units that are removed in other areas with comparable proximity to public services and employment. Conversion of Existing Apartment Units to Condominiums Conversion of apartment units to condominiums can have the effect of decreasing rental opportunities for persons of low and moderate income. According to a recent housing study conducted for the South Coast area, low income'households tend to reside in larger, multiple-unit apartment com- plexes (General Research Corp., An Evaluation of the Housing Market for UCSB Students, April 1977). Conversion of these comparatively lower cost renta Funits to condominium needs to be carefully monitored to prevent dis- placement of low and moderate income persons, particularly on the South Coast where the vacancy rate for rental units is below the five percent level recommended in the State Commission's housing guidelines. (Accord- ing to the 1975 Special Census, the average vacancy rate for the County was four percent. At the present time, the vacancy rate on the South Coast is estimated to be close to one percent, based on the results of a survey conducted by the County Planning Department in the spring of 1978). Currently,, the County does not have a condominium conversion ordinance which addresses building requirements (i.e., minimum square footage per unit, pro- vision of individually metered utilities, etc.) or the housing opportunity aspects of conversions. It is anticipated that the County Planning Commis- sion will commence public hearings on such an ordinace in the near future. -33- Encouraging and Providing for New Low and Moderate Income Housing According to the policies of the Coastal Act, new low and moderate in-. come housing shall be provided where feasible, in conformity with the goals and policies of'the local housing element. The principal deterrent to im- plementing this policy is that the high costs of land and construction preclude the building of units which are affordable to persons of low and moderate incomes. However, the need for affordable housing is presently a major issue County-wide and must be addressed in both the*LCP and County's Housing Element. Other factors which need to be considered in determining the amount and type of new housing in the coastal zone are the employment characteristics of the market area and resource constraints. Af fordabi 1 i ty Overpayment, defined by the Department of Housing and Urban development as housing payments in excess of 25 percent of gross monthly income, is currently the most severe housing problem in..Santa Barbara County@for rent- ers and owners. According to the 1975 Special Census, 47.4 percent of all @ental households in the County and 53.4 percent of the rental households in the South Coast housing market area exceeded the 25 percent standard. A consistent pattern has emerged throughout the County that low and moderate. income households spend a larger proportion of their incomes for rent than do hi?her income.families. Among the poorest households, those earning less than 4,000 in 1974, the median proportion of income spent as rent varied from 43 percent to 100 percent of gross income. Also, households in mul- tiple units pay a higher percentage of gross income for rent compared to households renting single family, 2-to-4 units, or mobile homes. In 1974, overpayment affected 21,000 households in the County with the very low in- come households accounting'for 46.6 percent of these. Given the high in- cidence of overpayment among lower income households on the South Coast and, thus, the need for.affordable housing, inclusionary housing provisions and incentives for constructing new low and moderate income housing are needed. Relationship with EmDlo,vment Opportunities Employment opportunities in a housing market area play a large role in determining the type of housing that is needed. Thus, the housing policies of the LCP must be related to the land use plan and its implications-for the future growth of the County. For example, Coastal Act priorities for the preservation of agriculture are reflected in the land use plan which estab- lishes agriculture as a long-term land use. Such land use decisions will certainly sustain, if not increase, the demand for farm laborers and sig- nificantly impact the housing market for areas*such as the City of Carpin- teria. Constru 'ction of the LNG facility at Point Conception or the space shuttle at Vandenberg Air Force Base would bring hundreds of construction workers to these coastal areas and greatly affect the demand for temporary and permanent housing in the County. Also, visitor-serving commercial uses, which are priority uses under the Coastal Act, provide many service-oriented jobs for low and moderate income people. All of these potential employment effects need to be linked to their impacts on the housing market at the time new development is proposed. -34- Resource Constraints Water moratoria currently ore in effect for the Goleta, Montecito, and Summerland water districts. Thus, new housing in these areas is directly dependent on the use of private wells@ In the Carpinteria County Water District, a limited water resource situation prevails and priorities for the remaining water supply need to be established. New development through- out the coastal zone must be tied to' the availability of resources and phased according to local plans for expansion of public services, i.e.,. water,sewer, and roads. 3.5.3 RELATIONSHIP TO THE COUNTY'S PROPOSED HOUSING ELEMENT Th e Housing Component of the Local Coastal Program builds upon the work that is currently being done toward development of a Housing Element for the County's Proposed Comprehensive Plan. The LCP Housing Component. draws as much as possible on the housing needs analyses and program rec- ommendations that have been prepared to date in conjunction with the Hous- ing Element, since LCP and County housing policies must be in conformity. In addition, the Housing Component of the LCP focuses on housing opportun- ities for persons of low and moderate' income. To this end, special LCP needs analyses were conducted for designated low and moderate income areas of the coastal zone: Isla Vista/Ellwood, Goleta, and Summerland. The re- sults of these analyses are reflected in the planning area discussions of the land use plan (Chapter 4). It should be noted that separate housing components are being prepared by the Cities of Santa Barbara and Carpinteria for their respective jurisdictions in the coastal zone. As outlined in preliminary drafts of the Housing Element, the County is divided into five housing market areas (HMA): Lompoc, Santa Maria, Santa Ynez, Cuyama, and the South Coast (Gaviota to the Ventura County line). Of these, the South Coast is the only market area in which major portions of the coastal zone are urbanized; and, within this market area, housing is a coastal planning issue for the urban area from Ellwood east to Carpinteria. The coastal zone west of Ellwood to Gaviota, through the Hollister and Bixby Ranches, and north to Guadalupe, is rugged and rural. Housing in this area is primarily incidental and necessary to agricultural operations and will remain so over the foreseeable future. Therefore, in the LCP Housing Component, the coastal zone from Ellwood east to the Ven- tura County line is viewed as one housing market area within which existing low and moderate income housing opportunities are identified and deficien- cies addressed. Housing issues for'each planning subarea (Goleta, including Isla Vista and Hope Ranch; Montecito; Summerland; and the Carpinteria Valley) are then evaluated in the context of the total market area. This approach has led to the formulation of general housing policies which apply to the County's entire coastal zone, as well as additional local policies and act- ions for individual planning areas., 3.5.4 POLICIES AND ACTIONS Policy 1: If less than five existing low or moderate income rental housing units are to be removed for health, safety, or other reasons' which are consistent with the goals of the Coastal Act, the County shall assist tenants who are displaced by such removal -35- in finding comparable housing within the same general housing area. If comparable units are not available, provision of com- parable income units shall be included in the new development plan and offered first to displaced tenants. If fiv.e or more units of low or moderate income rental housing units are to be removed, housing opportunities for low and moderate income-households shall be included in the new devel- opment plan un.less continued residential use of the parcel is not designated in the land use plan6 Action I.. The County Building and Planning Departments in conjunction with the California Department of Housing and Community De- velopment shall determine whether the structure(s) should be removed for health and safety or other reasons which would be consistent with the goals of the Coastal Act. 2. The County Planning Department shall determine the approp- riate amount of low and moderate income housing to be in- cluded in the new development plan based on the needs of the housing market area. (See Policy 3, Section l.a, for procedure to determine prorrtion.of low and moderate in- come units to*be included. Policy 2: Convers ion of apartment complexes of fi've units or more to con- dominiums shall not be permitted where 50 percent or more of the units are rented by persons of low or moderate income who would be displaced by such conversion unless: (a) comparable rental units are available in the same general housing area for displaced low or moderate income persons, as evidenced by a five percent rental vacancy factor for six months preceding conversion, and (b) tenants have been given.notice of intent.to convert at least.120 days prior to conversion and first option to purchase the proposed condominiums, and two-thirds of the low or moderate income tenants have chosen to exer- cise their purchase option. Action 1. The applicant shall provide' .the County Planning Department with the following information: a. percentage Of low or moderate income renters at the time of the proposed conversion, and b. the number of low or moderate income tenants who exer- cise the optionto purchase one of the condominium units. 2. The County Planning Department shall-determine the vacancy factor in the general area six months preceding conversion and the availability of comparable rental housing. Following these and other determinations that may be required for consistency with other provisions of this plan, the Planning Department staff shall recommend approval or denial of the pro- ject to the Planning Commission. Policy 3: For any new residential development of five units or more, the appropriate proportion of low and moderate income housing that must be included in the project shall be determined by the Plan- ning Department and made a condition of approval. Action 1. The County Planning Department will review each new develop- ment plan for five residential units or more to determine the following: a. The proportion of low and moderate income housing units to be included, if not specified elsewhere in this land use plan. The proportion should be based on the hous- ing needs of the market area at the time the project application is submitted, as follows: Current Households in Need* Proporti on of Total Occupied Units Units to be Included *Current Households in Need = Total Households in Need as identified in the Housing Assistance Plan - House- holds currently receiving assistance. If housing needs analyses are not available for individual planning areas, County-wide data will be substituted. As a means of providing the required low or moderate income housing units, application shall be made for such programs as Federal Section 8, rent subsidy. As an alternative, the County shall offer density bonuses where it can be shown that public services, i.e., water, sewer, and roads, are adequate to accommodate the additional units. In cases where it may be necessary to modify existing planning re- quirements for parking, setbacks, landscaping, etc., to offer the density bonus, approval shall be granted only if it can be shown that there will be no adverse impact on the affected neighborhood or environment. The maximum density bonus shall be 20 percent above the density permitted by zoning; the following graduated program shall be used: Percent Low/Moderate Income Units Density Bonus 0 - 24% 5% 25 - 49% 10% 50 - 74% 15% 75+% 20% _37- Policy 4: To protect existing low and moderate income housing opportunit- ies, rehabilitation programs for areas in need shall be developed.' Action The'County Planning Department shall identify areas which meet the requirements for government-funded rehabilitation programs, prepare the necessary applications for funding, and develop programs for implementation. Program The County shall implement a pilot rehabilitation program in Summerland and Carpinteria effective 1979, pending'approval of the County's application for Community Development Block Grant@ Junding for this purpose. Policy 5: The County shall develop and implement a variable density stan- ard that would allow for increases in density to provide for a greater diversity in the types of multiple units available for low and moderate income households (e.g., an increase in the number of studio and one-bedroom apartments in response to decreasing household size in the County).' Policy 6: Residential developments of five units or more which provide housing opportunities representative of all socio-economic sectors of the community shall be preferred. Such developments would include a range of apartment sizes (studios, one, two, three, and four bedroom units) and a mix of housing types (apartments, condominiums, townhouses, and single family detach- ed) to provide for balanced housing opportunities. Action The County shall devel op PRD and Variable Density Ordinances to accommodate a mix of housing types in large residential devel- opments to encourage flexibility and innovative land use. Policy 7: Review and evaluation of proposed residential developments nec- essary to carry out the policies set forth in this housing com- ponent shall be performed by the planning analyst within the County Planning Department who is responsible for coastal permits. The duties of this staff position shall include: (1) staff an- alysis of proposed residential projects in the coastal zone to determine appropriate incentives for the applicant to construct new low and moderate income housing; (2) requirements or con- ditions for approval to obtain the neces sary number of low and moderate income units; and (3) mechanisms for ensuring that low and moderate income units are retained as affordabl-e units over the long term. -38- Policy 4: Administration of housing programs shall be shared and coordin- ated as much as possible with agencies such as the Area Planning Council* and County Housing Authority to avoid additional staff- ing requirements and increased costs to the County. Recommendation To provide for a balanced housing mix that will accommodate all econ- omic segments of the community, review and approval of new development in the coastal zone, i.e., agriculture, coastal dependent industry, visitor- serving commercial, etc., shall include an assessment of its growth-induc- ing impacts on population, types of emDlovment opportunities, and sub- sequent impacts on housing needs. The provision of aclequate housing shall be a necessary corollary to new growth-inducing developments. *The Santa Barbara County-Cities Area Planning Council is currently examining a series of techniques (e.g., variable densit planned unit Z developments, and fair share housing allocation program to promote low and moderate income housing. A seri.es of staff reports is expected during 1979.
