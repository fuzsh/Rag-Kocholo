        "text": "The Inland Empire (locally known as the I.E.) is a region in Southern California; an urban and metropolitan area centered around the cities of Riverside and San Bernardino. The Inland Empire is located east of Los Angeles County.\n\nThe Inland Empire is sometimes considered co-extensive with the federally-defined Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area, which covers more than 27,000 square miles (70,000 km2) and is part of the Greater Los Angeles area. Home to over 4 million people, the metropolitan area consists of Riverside County and San Bernardino County, is the 13th most populous metropolitan area in the United States, and the third largest in the State of California.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the region was a major center of agriculture, including citrus, dairy, and wine-making. Agriculture declined through the 20th century, and since the 1970s a rapidly growing population, fed by families migrating in search of affordable housing, has led to more residential, commercial, and industrial development."
