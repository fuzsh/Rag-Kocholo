        "text": "NAR created the profile of home sellers for each metropolitan area. The following reports cover information on demographics and housing characteristics of their homes. The information provided helps to gain insight about the trends of homeownership at the local level.\n\nLooking for information on home buyers by MSA? Check out the NAR profile of home buyers by metropolitan statistical area.\n\nThe American Community Survey releases the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files every year, which include population and housing unit records with individual response information. According to the NAR’s Home Buyers and Sellers Survey, the average tenure of homeowners was nine years in 2017. Focusing on homeowners who moved into their home in the last five to nine years (as being categorized from the U.S. Census), NAR was able to identify the characteristics of the home sellers and their homes at local level.\n\nAreas with the highest concentration of sellers\n\nNAR calculated the share of owners who bought their home five to nine years ago for 382 metropolitan areas. The following large metropolitan areas are expected to see an uptick of the existing home sales because of the high concentration of owners who are reaching nine years of tenure:\n\nLas Vegas-Henderson-Paradise, NV (21.1%)\n\nAustin-Round Rock, TX (19.6%)\n\nPhoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ (19.4%)\n\nMcAllen-Edinburg-Mission, TX (19.3%)\n\nCape Coral-Fort Myers, FL (18.9%)\n\nRiverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA (18.8%)\n\nDes Moines-West Des Moines, IA (18.8%)\n\nTulsa, OK (18.5%)\n\nHouston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX (18.4%)\n\nDurham-Chapel Hill, NC (18.4%)\n\nThe map above shows the share of sellers for 382 metropolitan areas.\n\nProfile of Home Sellers by Metropolitan Area\n\nBased on the NAR’s Home Buyers and Sellers Survey, a typical home seller buyer was 55 years old and earned nearly $99,000 in 2017. What is the profile of the home seller at your local area?\n\nSelect a metropolitan area from the dropdown below and see the characteristics of the home sellers and their homes at your area:"
