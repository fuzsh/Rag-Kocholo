Thanks to voters, funds are now available to support housing access and stability for people across greater Portland.\n\nLearn how Metro is making progress toward new affordable homes across the greater Portland region.\n\nGreater Portland is growing. How do we want to grow?\n\nThe Portland Expo Center has a complex history that needs acknowledgment. It also requires a long-term plan for financial sustainability. The Expo Future project exists to address these issues.\n\nHow can we provide excellent garbage and recycling services for everyone? Learn how Metro is planning to expand and improve garbage and recycling facilities in greater Portland.\n\nPeople have come to Blue Lake for generations to gather, play, and connect with nature. But the infrastructure at the park is aging, and improvements are needed to keep Blue Lake Regional Park fun, safe and welcoming.\n\nSix times during the last two decades, voters across greater Portland have approved funding measures to support a network of regional parks, trails and natural areas. Learn how Metro uses the money to protect water quality, restore fish and wildlife habitat, and improve access to nature.\n\nThe TV Highway project will complete planning and design for a better bus to improve safe access and transit travel time while connecting people to essential jobs, healthcare facilities, shopping and community services from downtown Beaverton to Forest Grove.\n\nThe Metro Auditor’s Office administers the Metro Accountability Hotline. The hotline gives employees and the public an avenue to report fraud, waste, or abuse of resources or position in any Metro or Metropolitan Exposition Recreation Commission facility or department.\n\nMetro is committed to ensuring its services and activities are accessible to every resident of the region."
