All the Conductor needs to scan is that code/box in the upper left corner on a paper printout or smart phone. At the time that we made the reservations, the only return, direct Surfliner was 794 leaving Santa Barbara at 6:50 pm (after dark) and a 9:46 arrival back in Fullerton. However, some quick iPhone work by Matt found an earlier return direct train that left about 1:20 and got us back to LA about sunset.\n\nDon and I qualified for the Senior Discount (10% Senior discount which is applicable to travelers aged 60 and over), but there are also discounts through Santa Barbara Carfree (link below)\n\nMake Your SoCal Trip Extra Special.

Both depots are on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe 1930 Santa Fe depot serves as an Amtrak ticket office and passenger waiting area and has a cafe. It features Spanish Colonial Revival style architecture, as evidenced by the stuccoed walls, red tile roof, and decorative wrought ironwork.\n\nThe Union Pacific Railroad was the third railway to lay tracks through Fullerton and to build a depot. This helped firmly establish Fullerton as the regional rail center for northern Orange County. The 1923 Mission Revival style building was designed by John and Donald Parkinson. Fullerton's redevelopment agency moved the station next to the Santa Fe depot in 1980 to preserve it] Now it is occupied by an Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant.\n\nPacific Electric constructed an interurban railway to Fullerton in 1917, located just north of the Santa Fe station and providing a transfer point to their system.\n\nIn September 1983, the Orange County Transit District (now the Orange County Transportation Authority) opened the Fullerton Transportation Center bus depot which is located across the street from the station which is served by OCTA routes 26, 43, 47, 143, 213 and 543.\n\nThis station became one of the original 9 stations on the Metrolink Orange County Line when it opened on March 28, 1994 and also one of the original 7 stations when the 91 Line (now the 91/Perris Valley Line) opened on May 6, 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the Fullerton Railway Plaza Association (FRPA) began fundraising and lobbying for the creation of an interactive railroad attraction or museum at the site, while continuing preservation efforts. Starting in 1999 the Amtrak station and the FRPA were hosts for the annual \"Fullerton Railroad Days\" event at the Santa Fe depot, an event that attracted between 30,000 and 40,000 participants.[citation needed] Due to the city not supporting the FRPA museum,[citation needed] Railroad Days was not held in 2009, and FRPA looked elsewhere, choosing to hold its 2010 event in neighboring Brea. The organization subsequently changed its name to the Southern California Railway Plaza Association (SCRPA). However, Railroad Days for 2020 was canceled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nService\n\nThe station is served by the Metrolink 91 Line and Orange County Line commuter rail services, plus Amtrak intercity Pacific Surfliner and long-distance Southwest Chief services however, all Southwest Chief trains going to Los Angeles stops only to discharge passengers while trains going to Chicago stops only to pick up passengers.\n\nThe BNSF San Bernardino Subdivision has three tracks through the station. Westbound passenger trains use the north track and its side platform; eastbound trains use the south track and side platform. The center track is for freight use only. An additional siding track with a side platform south of the mainline tracks is used for short turn trains that run between Fullerton and Laguna Niguel or Oceanside.\n\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerton_Transportation_Center\n\nOur Surfliner No. 765 arrived at 8:39 a.m. in push mode. At LA, a stub in station, it would reverse and be in pull mode north to Santa Barbara.\n\nOn the upper level of some Superliner coaches, in the center of the car are 4 facing seats with a table reserved for groups of 3 or more. We walked through and found a coach with such seating (above). Don wanted to be on the engineer's left side so he could see the Amtrak yard before we arrived at the station. Since the train reversed in the LA Station, we moved to the opposite side on the way to Santa Barbara to be on the ocean side.\n\nFrom the flyover we could see the LA River bank to bank with runoff water from weeks of recent rain when usually the bottom of the concrete channel can be seen with only a small center lower channel of water. Earlier rain for the day had cleared and the clouds were clearing.\n\nWe passed the Amtrak turntable as seen from the flyover with the restored Santa Fe 3751 under tarps on the right.\n\nNearby was a Genesis locomotive and long-distance coaches and a Superliner Siemens locomotive.\n\nWe went under the 6th Street Viaduct over the LA River that also crosses over the railroad tracks and yards.\n\nMore than a bridge: Michael Maltzan’s 6th Street Viaduct addresses mistakes of L.A.'s past\n\nMichael Maltzan’s design for the 6th Street Viaduct replaces a 1932-era design by city engineer Merrill Butler that had succumbed to structural problems. That bridge — a beloved lowriding thoroughfare and international cinematic icon — consisted of a flat deck that traveled over an industrial spaghetti of railways, freeways and the channelized Los Angeles River. Its most notable flourish was a pair of steel arches that marked the point at which the bridge traveled over the water.\n\nMaltzan’s design tips its hat to Butler — while also creating something daringly new. Spanning 3,500 feet from end to end are 10 pairs of arches whose forms echo Butler’s design, with the tallest arches framing the river crossing. Imagine the ebullient pattern left by a bouncing ball or a rock skipping across water.\n\nFrom: https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-06-29/architect-michael-maltzan-6th-street-viaduct-la-river-bridge\n\nFrom the Surfliner coming in from the south, one can only see the tops of the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nMany earlier generation Metrolink locomotives and coaches align out tracks into Los Angeles Station.\n\nWe took on more passengers as we were stationary below the Metro Headquarters Building.\n\nThe Metro Headquarters Building (or One Gateway Plaza) is a 398 ft high rise office tower in Los Angeles, California. It is located in Northeastern Downtown Los Angeles, east across the tracks from Union Station . Completed in 1995, it serves as the main headquarters for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority\n\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Headquarters_Building\n\nThis Red Cap had decorated his electric cart in red/white and blue.\n\nLeaving LA Union Passenger Station, an original bridge near Dodger Stadium\n\nMetro Rail (lightrail) yards\n\nIf video past Metrolink Yard does not play, go here: https://youtu.be/DMulkW0XEqg\n\n.\n\nWe saw the Taylor Yard Bikeway and Pedestrian Bridge\n\nThe Taylor Yard Bikeway and Pedestrian Bridge, an aesthetically distinctive steel structure, is ushering in a new generation of bridge crossings over the LA River. Now open, the bridge is designed exclusively for pedestrians and bicyclists, connecting the Elysian Valley neighborhood with the active, residential Cypress Park community. While providing a safe and memorable path to travel on, the bridge offers two cantilevered lookouts with expansive north and south views of the adjacent communities and natural surroundings of the Glendale Narrows section of the river.\n\nTaylor Yard Bikeway and Pedestrian Bridge is one of three pedestrian crossings recently erected along the LA River as part of the Los Angeles’ River Revitalization Master Plan. This crossing will eventually connect to the Taylor Yard G2 River Park, a new, sustainable recreational greenspace to be built on the 42-acre site adjacent to the river known as the G2 parcel.\n\nWe passed the Van Nuys Airport, above, as well as the Burbank Bob Hope Airport.\n\nThe Burbank Bob Hope Airport is the closest LA regional airport which many people, hoping to avoid the congestion of LAX, take then take the Pacific Surfliner to downtown LA or points south.\n\nThis family was enjoying their first family train ride.\n\nThe Ventura Pier and distant Channel Islands.\n\nThe Crowne Plaza Hotel between the tracks and the pier.\n\nThis is the first time I have seen an Amtrak Station sign with the red sign.

The Coast Starlight runs once daily in each direction between Los Angeles and Seattle, Washington. The Pacific Surfliner trains serving this station run ten times daily (five in each direction) between San Diego and the Santa Barbara suburb of Goleta, with two of those running in each direction to/from San Luis Obispo further to the north. The station is fully staffed with ticketing and checked-baggage services.\n\nHistory\n\nSanta Barbara station in a 1910 postcard\n\nThe station was built in 1902 by the Southern Pacific Railroad in the Spanish Mission Revival Style. Design work was by Santa Barbara architect Francis W. Wilson.[3] It is located within walking distance of Santa Barbara Harbor, Stearns Wharf and State Street, Santa Barbara's main thoroughfare. The historic depot was renovated in 2000; the project included the restoration of the ticket office and upgrades to the plumbing, electrical and heating and cooling systems.\n\nFor most of the first decade of the Amtrak era, the station was only served by the Coast Starlight, which ran southbound during the evening rush and northbound at lunchtime. In 1988, Amtrak and Caltrans extended the San Diegan, previously a Los Angeles-San Diego service, to Santa Barbara, providing an additional round trip between the Central Coast and Los Angeles. Eventually, service was extended to nearby Goleta and later all the way to San Luis Obispo, resulting in the route being rebranded as the Pacific Surfliner in 2000.\n\nDue to the length of the platform, when Amtrak's Coast Starlight train is stopped, it blocks the two streets to the north and south of the depot.\n\nOf the 74 California stations served by Amtrak, Santa Barbara was the 15th-busiest in FY2012, boarding or detraining an average of approximately 834 passengers daily, and serving a total of 304,382 passengers in FY2012.\n\nThe station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 2, 2006.[2]\n\nFrom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara_station\n\nWe had planned to eat at the Monterey Bay Fish Company (under the flag above), but it was no longer there. The Ronald Reagan Ranch Foundation is between the Fish Company and the Amtrak Station.\n\nWe had lunch at The FisHouse,101 E Cabrillo Blvd, Santa Barbara, CA 93101\n\nI had Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi.\n\nWe walked west on Cabrillo past the Blue Water Grill with faux lighthouse then up State St. to the station.\n\nCeramic tile bench at the station with image of former coastal passenger train.\n\nThe train we had taken to Santa Barbara had laid over at Goleta and was the same train we took south back to LA and Fullerton.\n\nOur view from the upper level of the Superliner of State Street south and the Sterns Wharf.\n\nThe tracks run along the bluffs south of Santa Barbara.\n\nThe tracks and 101 are squeezed between the bluffs and the surf near La Conchita, California, Ventura County.\n\nArriving back in LA about sunset.\n\nBridges of LA County\n\nAs you leave Los Angeles Union Passenger Station heading south along the Los Angeles River, you pass under several vintage bridges.\n\nDon reflecting on the day as a Surfliner passes heading for LA.\n\nFrom the flyover, lower tracks cross the Los Angeles River looking east.\n\nSouth Soto Street from the flyover looking north. 5:20 pm 1/16/23\n\nBack in Fullerton on Track 3.\n\nOur Surfliner heads on south toward San Diego as we head for the Pedestrian Bridge and home.\n\nYours Truly\n\nCheers to Don's birthday and another Pacific Surfliner Rail Adventure to Santa Barbara. --Author\n\n..\n\nLINKS\n\n.\n\nThe Cafe Car Attendant announced his menu and this coupon which could be downloaded on passenger's smart phone or other connected device. We 3 used the coupons for $3 off any $5 purchase in the cafe even though it said it was expired. The attendant explained that they originally planned to offer it for 3 weeks, but were still using it."
