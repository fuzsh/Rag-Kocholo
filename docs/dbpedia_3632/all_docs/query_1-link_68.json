        "text": "The Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) unveiled today the names of 34 program participants selected to participate in its 2024 Culture and Community Design (CCD) program. The Culture and Community Design program runs from August through mid-December.\n\nThis is the second class of the immersive program where participants will examine the space between community building, arts and cultural work, and urban planning. The 2024 class is comprised of artists, organizers, local officials, and planners, who will work with two community organizations, serving underrepresented populations, to design projects and planning initiatives focused on arts and culture.\n\nCCD is a component of ARC’s Culture, and Creative Placemaking Strategic Plan, which provides a blueprint for integrating arts and culture into ARC’s planning work to help build a thriving and healthy region. The program will be co-led by Rosten Woo, a Los Angeles-based artist, designer, writer, and educator. Woo produces civic-scale artworks and works as a collaborator and consultant to a variety of grassroots, non-profit organizations, and local governments such as Los Angeles Poverty Department, the Black Workers Center, as well as the city of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County.\n\nHis work has also been exhibited internationally at art and design institutes and can be found at public housing developments and shopping malls, on tugboats, and in parks. Woo is also the co-founder and former executive director of the Center for Urban Pedagogy, a New York-based, non-profit organization and winner of a national design award for institution achievement.\n\n“We have a wonderful cohort excited about how to think of arts and community engagement in planning,” said Roshani Thakore, head of Community Engagement & Culture at ARC. “Over the past two years, we’ve been refining our community engagement and culture class. We can’t wait to see how the diversity in perspectives and experiences will shape their projects and ultimately the ecosystem of arts, culture and creative placemaking across the region.”\n\nAbout CCD’s 2024 Chosen Community Partners\n\nCCD class participants will explore community issues such as mobility justice, collective ownership, and community preservation by collaborating with two Community-Based Organizations (CBOs):\n\nVillage Skatepark ATL, located in Atlanta’s Bankhead neighborhood, is a family owned indoor skatepark nonprofit centering mobility, justice, youth engagement, and community building through skate culture.\n\nThe Kɘ’nekt, located in Atlanta’s Westview community, is a Black-led community collective based on mutual aid, solidarity economics, and collective wealth building.\n\nCCD Class of 2024:\n\nAnna-Kay Sinclair, Atlanta Regional Commission, Program/Project Coordinator\n\nAysha Pennerman, ADJ Designs, Artist\n\nCara Soh, Page Southerland Page, Inc., Senior Project Manager, Associate\n\nChantha Son, Atlanta Regional Commission, Senior Transportation Planner\n\nCharity Hamidullah, Artist/Muralist\n\nChristina Hiroko Kelly, DanceATL, Development Coordinator + Community Engagement\n\nColline Hernandez-Ayala, Perkins & Will, Principal\n\nDaisy Wellcome, Perkins & Will, Marketing Coordinator\n\nEdith Courtney, Atlanta Mayor’s Office of Cultural Affairs, Cultural Affairs Project Coordinator\n\nEmida Roller, Emida Roller Productions, LLC, Artist/Muralist\n\nEmily Mottola, Decatur Arts Alliance, Project Manager\n\nErica Chisolm, E L Creative LLC, Muralist, Creative Placemaking Consultant\n\nGavin Bernard, Reimagine ATL, Teaching Artist & Producer\n\nHaven Hendrix, Gwinnett County, Planner I\n\nHope Pollard, Gwinnett County, Senior Community Planner\n\nJacquelyn Pritz, Catching Mangoes Dance, Founder and Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Program Coordinator\n\nJennifer Ramirez-Soto, 85 Community Development Corporation, Bilingual Outreach Specialist\n\nJustine Schwartz, Atlanta Regional Commission, Education and Public Engagement Specialist\n\nKelsey Mitchell, Perkins & Will, Designer II\n\nLaQuita Williams, City of Sandy Springs, Planner I\n\nLauren Wiggins, Atlanta Regional Commission, Climate and Resilience Project Manager\n\nMaria Edwards, Hootsuite, Senior Program Manager\n\nMarisa Carter, Hummingbird, Community Engagement Strategist\n\nMarissa Jackson, City of Fayetteville, Senior Planner\n\nMayira Bunting, City of Doraville, Business and Community Engagement\n\nNicole Gilbert, City of Fayetteville, Planner\n\nNicole Le, Artist\n\nPaul Lorenc, City of Lawrenceville, Planner\n\nRebecca Payoute, Gwinnett County, Planner II\n\nRyan Sellers, Planning and Zoning Consultant\n\nSarah Lawrence, Design Emporium LLC, Founder & Principal Designer\n\nSarah Kitchens, Get Out The Bed Productions, Creative Director and Owner\n\nSteven Aceto, City of Atlanta Department of City Planning, Urban Planner\n\nTyrone Webb, Georgia Council for the Arts, Rural and Community Programs Manager\n\nFor more about the Culture and Community Design program, visit ARC’s Culture and Community Design Class page.\n\n###\n\nThe Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) is the official planning agency for the 11-county Atlanta Region, including Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, and Rockdale counties as well as the City of Atlanta and 74 other cities.
