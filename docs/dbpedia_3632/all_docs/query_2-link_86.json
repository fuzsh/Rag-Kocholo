        "text": "With over 500,000 cardiac arrests occurring each year, CPR training from the American Red Cross can be the difference between life and death. Developed and taught by experts, our training satisfies OSHA, workplace or other regulatory requirements. From personalized learning to interactive scenarios to peer-to-peer learning and hands-on skill practice, you will be prepared to provide care when it's needed most.\n\nOur CPR/AED course is flexible depending upon training needs and so course length varies depending on the course components taught and the learning method used. Overall, though, courses range from approximately 2 hours to just over hours.\n\nWhile they can understandably be confusing, BLS (Basic Life Support) is not the same as a CPR/AED course. CPR/AED courses are designed for non-medical personnel who want the knowledge necessary to recognize and care for someone in cardiac arrest or who is choking. BLS is designed primarily for healthcare professionals including nurses, physicians, EMS professionals and other healthcare and public safety personnel.\n\nYes, but they will differ based on the type of classes you choose. For example, prior to completing an online CPR course, there will be an online skills assessment portion that allows you to review what you've learned and self-test your skill proficiency. However, only in-person and blended learning courses allow you to demonstrate your skills to a certified instructor, which is often a requirement for workplace safety certification.\n\nYes. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), if cardiac arrest happens to someone near you, it's better to act than to do nothing, even if you've never had formal training. Call 911, begin CPR and continue it until medical professionals arrive. Even if your technique isn't perfect, it will give the victim a far better chance of survival. Of course, the best way to save lives is by staying current on your CPR certification. While CPR certifications last two years, your skills can begin to decline within months of training, according to the Red Cross Scientific Advisory Council."
