Based on the 2010 census, the population was 423,895. The county seat is Santa Barbara, and the largest city is Santa Maria. The county was created February 18, 1850. The Santa Barbara Channel received its name from Sebastian Vizcaino when he sailed over the channel waters in 1602. December 4, 1786, he founded the nearby Mission Santa Barbara (Saint Barbara). The county derives its name from the mission.\n\nSanta Barbara County comprises the Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nEtymology - Origin of Santa Barbara County Name\n\nThe Santa Barbara Channel received its name from Sebastian Vizcaino when he sailed over the channel waters in 1602.

The county seat is Santa Barbara, and the largest city is Santa Maria.\n\nIn 1848 Mexico signed a treaty ceding California to the United States. The territory became a state in 1850 when the population exploded to nearly 100,000 with the discovery of gold. While California was still a territory, county boundaries were formed. The present county of Ventura was originally included within Santa Barbara County until 1873 when the Legislature separated the area into the present Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties.\n\nSanta Barbara County\n\nhttp://www.cagenweb.com/santabarbara/sbarhist.htm\n\nGeography: Land and Water\n\nAs reported by the Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 3,789 square miles (9,814 km2), of which, 2,737 square miles (7,089 km2) of it is land and 1,052 square miles (2,725 km2) of it (27.77%) is water.\n\nThe Santa Ynez River and its tributaries drain the rugged and picturesque Santa Ynez Mountains north of Santa Barbara. The 25 mile-long upper Santa Ynez River is the longest stretch of free flowing river.\n\nNeighboring Counties\n\nBordering counties are as follows:\n\nNortheast: Kern County\n\nEast: Ventura County\n\nSouthwest: North Pacific Ocean\n\nNorthwest: San Luis Obispo County\n\nEducation\n\nThere are 20 independent school districts in Santa Barbara County, and the Santa Barbara County Education Office serves as an intermediate agency between those districts and the California Department of Education.
