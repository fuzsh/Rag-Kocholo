        "text": "It's almost time for the kids to head back to school all across Amarillo. Every year, our social media feeds get filled to the brim with photos taken by sentimental parents celebrating their \"baby's\" first day of school. When you take those photos, there is one thing you shouldn't do, and it will go a long way toward keeping your kiddo safe.\n\nWhat Not To Do When You Take Your Kid's Back To School Photo This Year\n\nThere's a trend on social media that didn't exist when I was growing up. My mom took photos of my brother and me in our back-to-school outfits with a disposable camera or the massive one she'd had forever. There weren't filters or cute poses. It was just my brother and I making weird faces or looking in the opposite direction.\n\nSorry, mom.\n\nNow, parents are having their kids hold up these blackboards with their name, school name, grade, teacher's name, and other fun tidbits of information. The thing you need to keep in mind is that those fun tidbits of information is that it's personal information about your child that a lot of people have access to once it's put online. Don't put all of that information about your child online for the world to see. Use your parental \"spidey sense\" and you can imagine all of the awful ways someone could use that info.\n\nWhat To Do When You Take Your Kid's Back To School Photo\n\nDon't worry, mom. You'll still get your ridiculously cute photo with the date, age, school, teacher name, blah blah blah, of your kid. Before you post it online, though, you'll want to do some editing.\n\nPotter County Sheriff's Office posted a great idea, and it's pretty simple. Take two photos. One featuring the full dossier of your child. In the other, take out all that personal info and post that photo online to social media. This keeps your kid's info safe, and you get all of that mommy clout that comes with the first day of school.\n\nIt's insane how much there is to think about nowadays when it comes to keeping our kids safe. Take the extra time this year and don't post all of your kid's info online."
