        "text": "City Endorses San Vicente-Fairfax Route as Metro Considers Three Options\n\nThe City of West Hollywood is announcing the start of Metro’s formal public comment period for the Northern Extension of the Metro K-Line (K Line North), which aims to bring rail service to West Hollywood. Metro is evaluating underground rail options through West Hollywood, Mid City, and Hollywood and will decide between three routes this fall.\n\nPublic comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) will be accepted until Thursday, September 5, 2024. The City of West Hollywood endorses the San Vicente-Fairfax route, which would include three stations in West Hollywood and serve a greater number of workers, residents, and destinations than the other proposed routes.\n\nResidents and stakeholders are encouraged to participate in one of Metro’s upcoming in-person or virtual hearings to express their preferences and concerns. Those unable to attend a hearing can still submit comments, emails, and formal letters. Detailed information on how to provide feedback is available at www.weho.org/metro.\n\nThe public hearing schedule is as follows:\n\nSaturday, August 10, 2024, 10 a.m. – 12 p.m. at Dorsey High School, 3537 Farmdale Avenue (near Metro Farmdale E Line Station)\n\nTuesday, August 13, 2024, 6 p.m. – 8 p.m. at the Pan Pacific Park Recreation Center, 7600 Beverly Boulevard (served by Metro Bus 14 and 217)\n\nThursday, August 15, 2024, 12 p.m. virtual meeting via Zoom\n\nAll meetings will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Spanish translation will be provided at all three meetings, while Russian translation will be available at the Pan Pacific Park and virtual meetings only.\n\nFor years, the City of West Hollywood has collaborated with West Hollywood Advocates for Metro Rail (WHAM), the All on Board Coalition, and the City of Los Angeles to support the K-Line North project. Efforts have been made to accelerate its completion by up to 20 years.\n\nThe regional impact of the K-Line North project is significant, as it will improve transit access for underserved communities and provide a more direct connection from Los Angeles International Airport to Central Los Angeles, West Hollywood, and the San Fernando Valley. The San Vicente-Fairfax route would enhance mobility and access to key locations such as Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the Pacific Design Center, the Grove, and the Hollywood Bowl. The project is expected to improve the efficiency of the transit system and provide equitable access for transit-dependent residents across the metropolitan area.\n\nA video titled “Finish The Line: A Route to Connect More People to More Places” is available on the City of West Hollywood’s WeHoTV YouTube channel. It highlights the City’s preference for the San Vicente-Fairfax route. Note that the K-Line is referred to by its previous name, the Crenshaw/LAX Line, in the video.\n\nFor more information about the Northern Extension of the Metro K Line, contact David Fenn, Senior Planner for the City of West Hollywood, at (323) 848-6336 or dfenn@weho.org. For the Deaf or hard of hearing, please call TTY (323) 848-6496."
