In the Matter of Fairview Assessment District No . 1963- 3 1913 Improve- ment Act Proceedings. The background of subject proceedings was reviewed and an alternate method of proceeding was offered . Miss Lauralea Trisler, of O'Melveny & Myers, Counsellors at Law on subject proceedings, appeared before the Board and noted that there is still some question as to the extent of the project as to whether all the improvements should be made . As far as the school benefiting from the assessment district, it was pointed out by Supervisor Grant that the school board determined that there was no benefit to the school. The property owners affected by the district have met to discuss aspects of the entire improvement proceedings and there was discussi on before the Director Public Works and Road Commissi oner on the entire project , and there appears to be a difference of opinion. The peopl e most concerned with the overall improvements were John Lucian and Harley Bar ling as well as the Goleta Presbyterian Church . Because of the total cost of the proceedings , there is some discussion on whether a portion of the relocation of Las Vegas Creek should be considered at this time on the overall program, or the bridge connecting Sherrell Way . It was pointed out that there is a new petition which includes the bridge and the road, for the revised project, signed by Messrs . Lucian and Barling. Donald C. Hertel, Engineer from Penfield & Smith Engineers, Inc., engineers for the project, appeared before the Board, and spoke of the reluctance of Mr. Lucian and Mr . Barling to go forward with the entire project . Under the I ' May 24, 1965 Act, the County must take an ea~ement for flood control work and realign Las Vegas Creek. Their concern is in committing the division of their property . They are willing to construct the box culvert under Sherrell Way and do the upstream flood control work to allow a bridge to be built in a permanent location. Mr. Hertel referred to the new petition signed by Messrs . Lucian and Barling which was prepared by O'Melveny & Myers, Counsellors at Law to which is attached the property maps indicating the limited amount of work requested: The new petition and maps were filed with the Clerk as part of the record Supervisor Grant stated that in the original proceedings, the Flood Control District was to participate to the extent of $25,000.00 in the overall project. It was not thought that the $25,000 .00 should be considered for the bridge and road construction. During the ensuing discussion, it was pointed out that the principal objection bad been the matter of the permanent easements correcting the channel ~ location, which would result in permanent division of both properties of Messrs . Barling and 1.ucian. Miss Trisler pointed out if the new petition is accepted by the Board, the old proceedings must be abandoned . The new petition could not provide for reimbursement for the money already spent on the proceedings. It would be necessary to enter into a new contract with the engineer and attorneys and there would be additional costs. With a compromise where the property owners merely participate in the box culvert and road extension, they could salvage from the total original plans $15,000.00 for engineering and legal fees, etc. to be applied to the new project . John T. Walser of the Goleta Presbyterian Church, appeared before the Board and read from a prepared formal statement which was filed with the Clerk The statement indicated the desire of the officers of the Church for the full district and their willingness and ability to participate in it. They will accept their share of the bonded indebtedness for both the road improvements and the alignment and improvement of Las Vegas Creek. John Lucian appeared before the Board, indicating his surprise on the reversal of the Church officials. He said they had an agreement last week to go ahead only with the road program and pick up the tab for the engineering. He thought the Church people could go ahead with their flood control part of the project, and he and Mr. Barling will participate in the road program on their property. Miss Trisler stated that this would be a new project and plans would have to be modified to accomplish this. Supervisor Grant stated that it would still be necessary for the County to acquire relocation easements through the Barling property . Mr . Harley Barling appeared before the Board and stated that it is his understanding that if they used their own funds to divert the canal to its permanent box culvert position, they would not have to grant the easements . It was explained that if the flood control work for the Church is done by them, Messrs. Barling and Lucian would do theirs. Mr . Walser reappeared to state that they are interested only in permanent structures - the box culvert at the west end next to Holiday Park. If they participate in a smaller district, as outlined, only the road could be bu"
