        "text": "Description\n\nShared Lane Markings (SLMs), or “sharrows,” are road markings used to indicate a shared lane environment for bicycles and automobiles. Among other benefits shared lane markings reinforce the legitimacy of bicycle traffic on the street, recommend proper bicyclist positioning, and may be configured to offer directional and wayfinding guidance. The shared lane marking is a pavement marking with a variety of uses to support a complete bikeway network; it is not a facility type and should not be considered a substitute for bike lanes, cycle tracks, or other separation treatments where these types of facilities are otherwise warranted or space permits. The MUTCD outlines guidance for shared lane markings in section 9C.07.\n\nClick on the images below to view 3D concepts of shared lane markings. The configurations shown are based on Portland, OR, and San Francisco, CA, examples.\n\nTreatment details can be accessed below under design guidance.\n\nShared Lane Marking Benefits\n\nEncourages bicyclists to position themselves safely in lanes too narrow for a motor vehicle and a bicycle to comfortably travel side by side within the same traffic lane. Read More+\n\n“The average distance bicyclists rode from the edge of the lane (called lateral position) increased only marginally, usually between four and eight inches, but a large shift in the mode occurred along multiple sites—at least three feet in many cases.”\n\nThe Center for Transportation Research, The University of Texas at Austin. (2010). Effects of Shared Lane Markings on Bicyclist and Motorist Behavior along Multi-Lane Facilities.\n\nAlerts motor vehicle drivers to the potential presence of bicyclists.\n\nAlerts road users of the lateral position bicyclists are expected to occupy within the travel lane.\n\nIndicates a proper path for bicyclists through difficult or potentially hazardous situations, such as railroad tracks.\n\nAdvertises the presence of bikeway routes to all users.\n\nProvides a wayfinding element along bike routes.\n\nDemonstrated to increase the distance between bicyclists and parked cars, keeping bicyclists out of the “door zone.” Read More+\n\n“Along Dean Keeton Street, where bicyclists rode alongside on-street parked vehicles, the marginal increase in lateral position resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of bicyclists who rode within the range of an opening car door.”\n\nThe Center for Transportation Research, The University of Texas at Austin. (2010). Effects of Shared Lane Markings on Bicyclist and Motorist Behavior along Multi-Lane Facilities.\n\n“Overall, the presence of a marking increased the distance of cyclists to parked cars by 8 inches.”\n\n“When passing vehicles were present, the markings caused an increase of 3 to 4 inches in the distance between cyclists and parked cars. In addition, the markings caused an increase of over 2 feet in the distance between cyclists and passing vehicles. The bike-and-chevron had a greater effect (by 3 inches) on the distance between cyclists and passing vehicles.”\n\nSan Francisco Department of Parking and Traffic. (2004). San Francisco’s Shared Lane Pavement Markings: Improving Bicycle Safety.\n\nIn the Cambridge, MA, study, the percentage of bicyclists who rode within 40 inches (i.e., near the door zone) of parked motor vehicles decreased.\n\nFederal Highway Administration. (2010). Evaluation of Shared Lane Markings. FHWA-HRT-10-041.\n\nEncourages safe passing by motorists. Read More+\n\n“Regarding motorist behavior, motorists were more likely to change lanes when passing, less likely to pass, and less likely to encroach on the adjacent lane when passing, all of which indicate safer motorist behavior.”\n\nThe Center for Transportation Research, The University of Texas at Austin. (2010). Effects of Shared Lane Markings on Bicyclist and Motorist Behavior along Multi-Lane Facilities.\n\nIn the Chapel Hill, NC, experiment, motorists moved away from the markings, providing more operating space for bicyclists.\n\nFederal Highway Administration. (2010). Evaluation of Shared Lane Markings. FHWA-HRT-10-041.\n\nRequires no additional street space.\n\nReduces the incidence of sidewalk riding. Read More+\n\n“Both the markings significantly reduced the number of sidewalk riders: the bike-and-chevron by 35% and the bike-in house by 25%.”\n\nSan Francisco Department of Parking and Traffic. (2004). San Francisco’s Shared Lane Pavement Markings: Improving Bicycle Safety.\n\n“Before the arrow was placed, 39.3% of bicyclists rode in street, with traffic [versus on sidewalk.] After the arrow was placed, the proportion of bicyclists riding in street with traffic increased to 45.3%.”\n\nPein, W.E., Hunter, W.W., and Stewart, J.R. (1999). Evaluation of the Shared-Use Arrow. Florida Department of Transportation,Tallahassee, FL.\n\nReduces the incidence of wrong-way bicycling. Read More+\n\n“The bike-and-chevron marking significantly reduced the number of wrong-way riders by 80%. The bike-in-house marking did not have any significant impact on the percentage of wrong-way riders.”\n\nSan Francisco Department of Parking and Traffic. (2004). San Francisco’s Shared Lane Pavement Markings: Improving Bicycle Safety.\n\nTypical Applications\n\nShared lane markings should not be considered a substitute for bike lanes, cycle tracks, or other separation treatments where these types of facilities are otherwise warranted or space permits. Shared lane markings can be used as a standard element in the development of bicycle boulevards to identify streets as bikeways and to provide wayfinding along the route.\n\nDesirable shared lane marking applications:\n\nTo indicate a shared lane situation where the speed differential between bicyclist and motorist travel speeds is very low, such as:\n\nOn bicycle boulevards or similar low volume, traffic calmed, shared streets with a designed speed of < 25 mph. On downhill segments, preferably paired with an uphill bike lane. If space permits, consider a wide downhill bike lane. On streets where the traffic signals are timed for a bicycling travel speed of 12 to 15 miles per hour.\n\nAs a reasonable alternative to a bike lane in limited circumstances:\n\nWhere street width can only accommodate a bicycle lane in one direction. On hills, lanes should be provided in the uphill direction. Within single or multi-lane roundabouts. Read More+\n\n“The complexity of vehicle interactions within a roundabout leaves a cyclist vulnerable, and for this reason, bike lanes within the circulatory roadway should never be used.”\n\nUS Department of Transportation. (2000). Roundabouts: An Informational Guide. FHWA-RD-00-067.\n\nAlong front-in angled parking, where a bike lane is undesirable.\n\nTo designate movement and positioning of bicycles through intersections. To designate movement and positioning of bicyclists through a combined bike lane/turn lane. To assist bicyclists in taking the lane in the presence of a double turn lanes. Double turn lanes are undesirable for bicyclists. In the street alongside separated bikeway facilities such as cycle tracks, to permit continued use of the street by bicyclists who prefer to ride in the street.\n\nGenerally, not appropriate on streets that have a speed limit above 35 mph. Read More+\n\n“The Shared Lane Marking should not be placed on roadways that have a speed limit above 35 mph.”\n\nFederal Highway Administration. (2009). Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Section 9C.07 02.\n\nThe Toronto Cycling Study (2010) found that while 72.5% of all existing bicyclists are comfortable riding on major roads with bike lanes, only 54% reported feeling comfortable on major roads with sharrow markings.\n\nCity of Toronto/Ipsos Reid. (2010). City of Toronto Cycling Study: Tracking Report (1999 and 2009).\n\nDesign Guidance\n\nMaintenance\n\nFrequent, visible placement of markings is essential.\n\nLateral placement is critical to encourage riders to avoid the “door zone.”\n\nThe shared lane marking may be placed in the center of the lane between wheel treads to minimize wear.\n\nTreatment Adoption and Professional Consensus"
