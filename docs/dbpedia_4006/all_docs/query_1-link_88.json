        "text": "By Joe Pisani\n\nFAIRFIELD — By his own admission, Paul Piorek, the chief meteorologist at WICC and fifth-grade teacher at St. Thomas Aquinas School, hasn’t worked a day in his life. Well almost.\n\nYou see, as he tells his students, “If you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life.” And he clearly loves what he does in his career, which has been a convergence of three lifelong passions for meteorology, teaching and radio.\n\nSeven days a week, Piorek broadcasts the weather for WICC 600 AM and 107.3 FM — five of those days he does it live from his fifth-grade classes at St. Thomas Aquinas, where he is known for inspiring his students with a love of science and mathematics.\n\nPiorek’s own story began when he was a student at Andrew Warde High School in Fairfield. With his diploma barely in hand, he set out for adventure and told his parents he was pursuing a career in radio. They told him he was crazy. Well, he was just crazy enough to drive downtown Bridgeport and knock on the door of the city’s premier radio station, WICC, and ask for a job. And he got one.\n\n“I always wanted a career in radio or TV, so I went to WICC on State Street and knocked on the door, and told them, ‘I’d love to be on the air.’ I was 18,” he recalls.\n\nThe stars must have been in alignment (Piorek also loves astronomy), because the station manager said, “You’re in luck — our overnight host is leaving, and you can start on Monday.”\n\n“So I went home and told my father and mother, and they were in shock,” he said.\n\nThat was back in 1978. In his new job, Piorek got to the station at 10 pm to prepare and was on the air from midnight to 6 am, playing records and engaging nocturnal fans on the phone in discussions about rock ‘n’ roll and timely events. It was the beginning of his radio career. He worked there from 1978 until 1986, until returning a year ago to do the weather sevens days a week.\n\nPiorek also had an acclaimed career in television as the long-time morning meteorologist at News 12 Connecticut, where he was honored to receive a New York Emmy in 2007, five Emmy nominations, and the Associated Press Broadcasters’ Association award for Best TV Weathercast in Connecticut four times, along with two Communicator Awards of Distinction.\n\nPiorek’s other great love is teaching. He taught at Greenwich Catholic Elementary School from 1990 to 1995, and in 2016, he started at St. Thomas Aquinas School.\n\n“I love every minute of it,” he says. “The best part is that I teach science and math. I have a love for all things science — geology, earth science, physics, and weather,” he said. “When you bring that passion to the classroom, students can recognize it. And I tell them they can make a career out of this too because if you do what you love and love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life.”\n\nPiorek also enjoys teaching religion because faith is a fundamental part of his life. A lifelong member of St. Pius X Parish in Fairfield, he had the distinction of being baptized in the church just days after it opened in 1958 and was a member of the first class to attend all eight grades at St. Pius X School from 1964 to 1972. Over the years, in service to the parish, he has been a lector, a catechist, an usher and an Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion.\n\nOne of his fondest memories was working with the renowned Dr. Mel Goldstein, a meteorologist who was revered by his colleagues around the state. Piorek describes him as “the best and most well-respected meteorologist in Connecticut.”\n\n“I learned meteorology from Dr. Mel at Western Connecticut State University,” he recalls. “Then, he hired me as an on-air broadcast meteorologist at WCSU for a host of radio stations, which ultimately led to my position at News 12 Connecticut.”\n\nHe was also responsible for typing the very popular weather column by Dr. Mel into the computer and sending it to newspapers statewide for many years. He credits Dr. Mel with giving him the inspiration to start his own weather blog, titled, “Paul’s Local Weather Journal for Southwestern Connecticut” at (www.localweatherjournal.blogspot.com)\n\nSo, you might ask, where does he get his weather? Piorek formulates his own forecasts and starts working on them early in the morning.\n\n“I get up at 4:15 and use my own weather models to put together my forecasts,” he says. “When I’m asked about how accurate I am, I say, ‘I do it to the best of my ability.’ I don’t do any percentages, and I am wary of 10-day forecasts.”\n\nSo if you want to hear him broadcasting live from St. Thomas Aquinas, tune in to WICC 600 AM or 107.3 FM during the week at 7:46 am, 8:16 am and 8:46 am.\n\nEditor’s note: The following was originally published by Vatican News on December 18, 2023, in order to explain the Declaration “Fiducia supplicans,” which permits blessings for couples in “irregular situations,” including same-sex couples.\n\nWhen two people request a blessing, even if their situation as a couple is “irregular,” it will be possible for the ordained minister to consent. However, this gesture of pastoral closeness must avoid any elements that remotely resemble a marriage rite.\n\nThis is what is stated the Declaration “Fiducia supplicans” on the pastoral meaning of blessings, published by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and approved by Pope Francis.\n\nThe document explores the theme of blessings, distinguishing between ritual and liturgical ones, and spontaneous ones more akin to signs of popular devotion. It is precisely in this second category there is now consideration of the possibility of welcoming even those who do not live according to the norms of Christian moral doctrine but humbly request to be blessed. 23 years have passed since the former “Holy Office” published a Declaration (the last one was in August 2000 with “Dominus Jesus”), a document of such doctrinal importance.\n\n“Fiducia supplicans” begins with the introduction by the prefect, Cardinal Victor Fernandez, who explains that the Declaration considers the “pastoral meaning of blessings,” allowing “a broadening and enrichment of the classical understanding” through a theological reflection “based on the pastoral vision of Pope Francis.”\n\nIt is a reflection that “implies a real development from what has been said about blessings up until now, reaching an understanding of the possibility “of blessing couples in irregular situations and same-sex couples without officially validating their status or changing in any way the Church’s perennial teaching on marriage.”\n\nAfter the first paragraphs (1-3) that recall the previous pronouncement of 2021 that is now further developed and superseded, the Declaration presents the blessing in the Sacrament of Marriage (paragraphs 4-6) stating as inadmissible “rites and prayers that could create confusion between what constitutes marriage” and “what contradicts it,” by avoiding any implication that “something that is not marriage is being recognized as marriage.” It is reiterated that according to the “perennial Catholic doctrine” only sexual relations between a man and a woman in the context of marriage are considered lawful.\n\nA second extensive part of the Declaration (paragraphs 7-30) analyzes the meaning of different blessings, whose recipients are people, objects of worship, and places of life. It is recalled that “from a strictly liturgical point of view,” the blessing requires that what is blessed “be conformed to God’s will, as expressed in the teachings of the Church.”\n\n“When a blessing is invoked on certain human relationships” through a special liturgical rite, the Declaration notes, “it is necessary that what is blessed corresponds with God’s designs written in creation” (par. 11). Therefore, the Church does not have the power to impart a liturgical blessing on irregular or same-sex couples. It is also necessary to avoid the risk of reducing the meaning of blessings to this point of view only, expecting for a simple blessing “the same moral conditions for a simple blessing that are called for in the reception of the sacraments” (par. 12).\n\nAfter analyzing blessings in Scripture, the Declaration offers a theological-pastoral understanding. Those who ask for a blessing show themselves “to be in need of God’s saving presence” in their lives by expressing “a petition for God’s assistance, a plea to live better” (par. 21). This request should be received and valued “outside of a liturgical framework” when found “in a realm of greater spontaneity and freedom” (par. 23).\n\nWhen seeing them from the perspective of popular piety, “blessings should be evaluated as acts of devotion.” Those requesting a blessing “should not be required to have prior moral perfection” as a precondition, the Declaration notes.\n\nExploring this distinction, based on the response of Pope Francis to the dubia published last October that called for discernment on the possibility of “forms of blessing, requested by one or more persons, that do not convey an erroneous conception of marriage” (par. 26), the Declaration affirms that this kind of blessing “is offered to all without requiring anything,” helping people feel that they are still blessed despite their mistakes and that “their heavenly Father continues to will their good and to hope that they will ultimately open themselves to the good” (par. 27).\n\nThere are “several occasions when people spontaneously ask for a blessing, whether on pilgrimages, at shrines, or even on the street when they meet a priest and these blessings “are meant for everyone; no one is to be excluded from them” (par. 28).\n\nWhile it is not appropriate to establish “procedures or rituals” for such cases, the ordained minister may join in the prayer of those persons who “although in a union that cannot be compared in any way to a marriage, desire to entrust themselves to the Lord and his mercy, to invoke his help, and to be guided to a greater understanding of his plan of love and of truth” (par. 30).\n\nThe third part of the Declaration (paragraphs 31-41) opens then to the possibility of these blessings that represent a sign for those who “recognizing themselves to be destitute and in need of his help—do not claim a legitimation of their own status, but who beg that all that is true, good, and humanly valid in their lives and their relationships be enriched, healed, and elevated by the presence of the Holy Spirit” (par. 31).\n\nThese blessings should not necessarily become the norm, the Statement notes, but entrusted to “a practical discernment in particular circumstances” (par. 37).\n\nAlthough the couple is blessed but not the union, the Declaration notes that what is blessed is the legitimate relationship between the two people: in “a brief prayer preceding this spontaneous blessing, the ordained minister could ask that the individuals have peace, health, a spirit of patience, dialogue, and mutual assistance—but also God’s light and strength to be able to fulfill his will completely” (par. 38).\n\nAlso clarified is that to avoid “any form of confusion or scandal,” that when a couple in an irregular situation or same-sex couples ask for a blessing, it “should never be imparted in concurrence with the ceremonies of a civil union, and not even in connection with them. Nor can it be performed with any clothing, gestures, or words that are proper to a wedding” (par. 39). This kind of blessing “may instead find its place in other contexts, such as a visit to a shrine, a meeting with a priest, a prayer recited in a group, or during a pilgrimage” (par. 40).\n\nIn conclusion, the fourth chapter (paragraphs 42-45) recalls that “even when a person’s relationship with God is clouded by sin, he can always ask for a blessing, stretching out his hand to God” and desiring a blessing “can be the possible good in some situations” (par. 43).\n\nBy Rose Brennan\n\nFAIRFIELD—The United States is home to just under 62 million Catholics, who make their homes in 175 American dioceses. And each diocese is home to one to two cathedrals that serve as the bishop’s seat in that area.\n\nAnd here in the Diocese of Bridgeport, one man is on a mission to visit every single one of them.\n\nBut Andrew Masi isn’t planning on stopping there. No, he’s also planning on visiting each of the basilicas in the United States as well. And he’s stopping at quite a few shrines along the way, too.\n\nTo date, Masi has visited 102 cathedrals and 59 basilicas. He reached lucky number 100 over Veterans Day Weekend, traveling to Missouri to visit the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception and the Cathedral of St. Peter in Kansas City, as well as the Cathedral of St. Joseph in St. Joseph.\n\nIt sure is becoming a whirlwind tour, but it all began for Masi in 2014, when he attended an Easter Mass at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark, N.J. It was only a few weeks following the death of his grandmother Josephine, whom Masi cites as a major model of the Catholic faith in his life. And as he sat in the cathedral, he began to think.\n\n“In the middle of Mass, I’m gazing at the cathedral and looking at its magnificent structure and the stained-glass windows, and I’m just in awe of the beauty of it,” he said. “And then a thought ran into my head: ‘Hey, I wonder if every cathedral in the United States looks just as gorgeous and magnificent as this one does.’ And that’s when the idea came in to go out there and see for myself.”\n\nWhile he sees the beauty of each cathedral and basilica he visits, Masi isn’t above playing favorites. So far, the one structure that stands out most in his pilgrimage is the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis in Missouri—at which he was captivated by the intricate mosaics decorating the sanctuary.\n\n“When you walk into that cathedral, your eyes are drawn to the ceiling and the beautiful mosaics … that were put in piece by piece very delicately. It took so long to put them in,” he said. “It just made them more magnificent and more beautiful. It’s like walking into one of the cathedrals in Rome.”\n\nThis isn’t the first pilgrimage Masi has undertaken, however. He faced a similar challenge in 2004, when then-Bishop William E. Lori challenged him to visit every parish in the Diocese of Bridgeport, which he completed in just 11 months. Among them, Masi designated St. Augustine Cathedral in Bridgeport and the Basilica of St. John the Evangelist in Stamford as his favorites.\n\nNow, of course, Masi’s widened his scope to the entire country. But he’s not putting the camera down once he’s visited every cathedral and basilica in the United States. Once this pilgrimage is done, he wants to visit major cathedrals and basilicas across the world, notably in Canada, Europe and Asia.\n\n“The cathedrals have withstood the tests of time, especially Notre Dame in Paris,” Masi said. “It nearly burned down a few years ago, but thank God, Our Lady watched over it and spared the cathedral any major damage.”\n\nWhen Masi visits the cathedrals and basilicas, he is often filled with gratitude for the opportunity to undertake this pilgrimage, as well as the way it’s helped deepen his Catholic faith.\n\n“It makes me closer to God, and I thank him for giving me the great opportunity to do this wonderful pilgrimage,” he said. “God gave me the sign to do this, and I answered the call with a ‘yes.’”\n\nMasi knows his ability to visit each of the country’s cathedrals isn’t one everyone has. And the photographs he takes almost become an act of service to those who might never see the beauty of the sanctuaries in person—including the homebound and elderly, and those who are otherwise unable to travel.\n\n“It’s a way to give them the opportunity just to see the church, even though it’s virtual,” he said. “People have told me, ‘I feel like you’ve taken me on a virtual tour.’”\n\nMasi noted he’s received a lot of support from clergy both in the diocese and around the country. He cited his major supporters as Bishop Frank J. Caggiano, Archbishop Lori, Cardinal Timothy J. Dolan of the Archdiocese of New York, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley of the Archdiocese of Boston and Father Peter Cipriani, the pastor at Masi’s home parish of Our Lady of the Assumption in Fairfield—who gives him a blessing prior to each trip he takes to photograph the cathedrals.\n\n“They all see my pictures and they praise them, and they give me their prayers of support,” Masi said. “Like, ‘Keep on going, Andrew; get to the finish line!’”\n\nToday we remember the lives of the children and educators who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School 11 years ago today, on December 14, 2012.\n\nWe pray for the repose of the souls of the victims, for healing and peace for their loved ones and survivors, and for an end to all violence in our community, especially for an end to gun violence in our country and across the world, and for the children who deserve childhoods filled with joy and free from violence and terror.\n\nWe remember\n\nCharlotte Bacon, 6\n\nShe wanted to be a veterinarian when she grew up, and liked practicing Tae Kwon Do with her father and brother.\n\nDaniel Barden, 7\n\nHe loved to ride waves at the beach and played drums in a band with his brother and sister.\n\nRachel D’Avino, 29\n\nShe was a hard worker and a risk-taker, and did everything with confidence, but never arrogance.\n\nOlivia Engel, 7\n\nShe would lead the family in praying grace before dinner, and loved riding on her grandfather’s boat.\n\nJosephine Gay, 7\n\nShe loved peanut butter and would use a new spoon for each mouthful.

She asked Mrs. Patty Schickler, the seventh-grade teacher and student council moderator, to have the students work in their classes and make trees to donate.\n\nThis year, each tree decorated by the students had a different theme. The pre-school tree was Curious George; kindergarten was Crayola; first grade was First Responders; second grade was Beavers; third grade, Sports; fourth grade, Taylor Swift; fifth grade, Sweet Treats; sixth grade, Star of Bethlehem; seventh grade, Hawaiian; and eighth grade, Space.\n\nThe school financed the trees and the materials. The room mothers purchased the materials and worked with the classes to create the decorations.\n\n“Trees of Hope is such an important tradition at SCSS because it gives the children a hands-on opportunity to participate in charity, said Tara Craig, second-grade room mother. “By engaging them in the process, we are able to open up a conversation about why we, as a school, do these trees and who the Ronald McDonald House benefits. It can be difficult for children to not be able to keep something they work hard on creating, but when they hear what good their gift can bring, a lesson in generosity is learned.”\n\nSince 1990, the Trees of Hope benefit has been an annual event sponsored by Ronald McDonald House Charities of Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. The 34th Annual Trees of Hope will be held December 2 to 10, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily at the Maritime Center at 555 Long Wharf Drive in New Haven.\n\nThe event, which is open to the public, will feature more than 150 holiday displays donated and sponsored by individuals, businesses and community organizations. Raffle tickets are sold for $1 each, and attendees will be able to distribute their tickets towards the displays they would like to win. The proceeds will benefit Ronald McDonald House.\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House of Connecticut is at 860 Howard Avenue in New Haven, close to Yale-New Haven Children’s Hospital. The facility has 18 guest rooms and two respite rooms to serve families with children undergoing specialized medical treatment at hospitals and healthcare facilities around the state. (There is another house in Springfield, Mass.)\n\nWhen the Connecticut facility opened in 1985, it was a 12 guest room house. In 2017, a new house opened as “a home away from home” for families of children who are being treated at nearby hospitals, including Yale-New Haven, the Hospital of St. Raphael and Bridgeport Hospital, among others.\n\nBy Emily Clark\n\nAmid flickering candlelight and softly glowing evergreen trees came prayers of thanksgiving, chatter among friends, and a unique message of hope. Advent by Candlelight – An Inspirational Evening drew close to 100 women to the parish center at St. Pius X Church on Saturday evening, December 2. In addition to sharing a meal and fellowship, guests were inspired by the words of keynote speaker Jenny Hubbard, president of the Catherine Violet Hubbard Animal Sanctuary which she founded in memory of her daughter who died in the Sandy Hook School shooting.\n\nIn the dimly lit room, illuminated only by candlelight, tables set with mini Christmas trees and a tiny creche, fresh flowers and a little St. Nick welcomed those looking to begin this sacred, albeit hurried, season with moments of peaceful reflection. For event coordinator Karen Lannigan, such an intimate experience provided greater reverence to the season as women gathered together in community.\n\n“I feel this is the right way, a beautiful way to start Advent,” said Holly Tilton of Norwalk, who shared a table with her friend Dorece Criscuolo of Easton. “This can be such a loud and busy time, so I really appreciate this quiet and reflective event.”\n\nCriscuolo agreed, saying, “It’s women taking the time and putting the Lord first despite so many distractions in our lives.”\n\nFollowing the meal, Lannigan introduced Jenny Hubbard, a role model for compassion, she said, whose personal testimony is a witness to faith and hope following the death of her daughter. “The decision to have Jenny as our guest speaker is because her story is so close to home,” Lannigan said. “She inspires women with the singular message that God is with us, no matter what the circumstances.”\n\nWhile people associate Hubbard with the Sandy Hook tragedy and the loss of Catherine along with so many others 11 years ago, the messages emanating from her stories, though caused by suffering, were those of trust and acceptance. Suffering, she said, is a sacred place where we encounter the true and living God.\n\n“When you hear of someone suffering, let your heart crack open a little bit. That is one way that we grow as Catholic women,” Hubbard said. “Through our suffering, He will always provide a way. We may not always like it, but we must accept it. He is there to protect us. I know this to be true.”\n\nDuring Advent in another time and place, Hubbard experienced profound suffering – and acceptance. On December 14, 2012, waiting at the Sandy Hook Firehouse for news of her daughter Catherine, a first grader, she received comfort from a friend whom she had met through a Bible study. Her hands tightly gripping a strand of rosary beads, Hubbard prayed, “Dear God, bring her home.” Later that day, she realized that He had answered that prayer, as her daughter was home with Him in Heaven.\n\n“God watched over Catherine and protected me because of the way He allowed me to live my life – through prayer and friendship,” she said, noting the importance of friends who helped her through those darkest days. Looking around at the tables before her, she gave a nod to the power of friendship among Catholic women, saying, “We are made for fellowship. I love seeing gatherings like this.”\n\nFor Lannigan, Hubbard embodies the hope experienced during Advent as Christians everywhere await the birth of Jesus. “There is a time and season for everything in our life and there is purpose in our suffering,” she said. “We just have to trust that He will reveal it in time.” Lannigan added that the event also allowed attendees to offer a donation to St. Pius X School and the Hunt Ridge Montessori School in Fairfield.\n\nFather Sam Kachuba, pastor at St. Pius X, said such events “remind us that the Church is a community of communities. As Advent begins, I am very happy to see these women bound by the gift of their Catholic faith. They can look forward, together, to the coming of the Lord Jesus.”\n\n“Lean into our Lord God,” Hubbard said in closing, “so when Christmas comes, you can celebrate.”\n\nNORWALK—Assisting those most in need is one of the ways the Knights of Columbus St. Matthew Council 14360 give thanks to God for their many blessings.\n\nRecently the council joined forces with six local councils from Norwalk, Darien, New Canaan, Westport and Wilton on Saturday, November 4, at the Family & Children’s Agency Ben Franklin Community Center in South Norwalk. More than 750 brand new coats, gloves, hats, and scarves were distributed during the Knights of Columbus Coats for Kids event. This event helps keep kids warm over the winter months by providing this necessity. The goal of the Coats for Kids program is to ensure that children in need across North America have a warm, winter coat.\n\nThrough the dedication of councils across the United States and Canada, hundreds of thousands of new winter coats have been distributed to children since the program’s inception. Over 11,000 brand new coats were distributed by Connecticut Knights Councils at eight separate locations over the last month.\n\n“Inflation has created an even bigger need in our community, so we do what Knights do by assisting our brothers and sisters when times are rough,” said Project Chair and Council 14360 Past Grand Knight, George Ribellino. “My biggest joy is seeing the smiles of the kids’ faces as they try on a brand-new coat.”\n\nThe council has been assisting the Family & Children’s Agency in several ways since 2009 including being a sponsor of their annual Foster Care Holiday party.\n\n“I am so grateful to the Knights of Columbus for providing brand new coats to our clients in need. As prices rise and children grow, winter clothing can be a financial burden for families, so this partnership with the Knights has been truly impactful in the community,” said Robert F. Cashel, President & CEO of FCA.\n\nOn Thanksgiving Day, Council 14360 members helped usher, read and clean for the 9 am Thanksgiving Mass at St. Matthew. In addition, the Council also provided a Knights of Columbus Honor Guard for the Mass. At the conclusion of the Mass, the council teamed up with Bishop Fenwick Assembly 100 and the Catholic Daughters of the America’s St. Matthew Court 2640 to provide and deliver a Thanksgiving meal for the residents of Homes for the Brave for the tenth consecutive year.\n\n“Our men and women appreciative of the delicious food, and we could not be more appreciative. What a blessing St. Matthew Council #14360, Bishop Fenwick Assembly 100 and Catholic Daughters Court 2640 have been to us. All of us at Homes for the Brave are extremely grateful as you made the day incredibly special for our residents,” said Homes for the Brave CEO/Executive Director, Vince Santilli.\n\nOn Black Friday, November 24, council members started off the day by going to Mass at St. Matthew. After Mass, three carloads of food collected at Thanksgiving Mass was delivered to Blessed Sacrament Parish’s pastor, Father Skip Karcsinski.\n\n“Giving back to those in need during the Thanksgiving season is truly a blessing for our council. One of the most profound ways we can truly give thanksgiving to God is through serving others,” said Grand Knight Chris O’Connor.\n\nThe Council prepared for Advent by hosting the Annual Keep Christ in Christmas Creche Blessing and Christmas Tree Lighting at St. Matthew Church. The St Matthew Children’s choir sang Christmas Carols for all in attendance and council chaplain and St Matthew Pastor, Father Frank Hoffmann blessed the creche and Christmas Tree and the beautiful Norway Spruce dedicated in memory of former pastor Monsignor Walter Orlowski was lit. The St. Matthew Knights provided pizza and beverages in the parish center Great Room to end the festive event. All parishioners received a free Keep Christ in Christmas pin as a gift from the council.\n\n“This is a great way to get ready for the Advent season in preparation for the celebration of the birth of Christ,” said Council 14360 Grand Knight Chris O’Connor.\n\nThe council will continue to give back to the community this Advent season by assisting the Norwalk Toys for Tots organization with the picking up of all the Toys for Tots boxes in Norwalk, Westport and Fairfield to help distribute toys to those in need.\n\nThe goal of the Knights of Columbus Council at St. Matthew in Norwalk is to perform acts of charity. Providing those in need with a range of support from financial to tactical help in dealing with a wide variety of challenges. Council members work together to foster the founding principles of our order: charity, unity, fraternity, and patriotism. Our goal as a council is to continue to identify specific needs in our community and muster support and help to alleviate these challenges and hardships to the best of our abilities and resources.\n\n(For more information, please go to kofc14360.net.
