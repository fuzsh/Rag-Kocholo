        "text": "It was great honestly, I had tons of fun and learned a lot. It is like a small community so you know everyone and the teachers are great and understanding, the principal, and faculty were a great help also. The coaches were amazing and would help you with anything that you needed. Great school to prepare you for college and the counselors will help you navigate for college and help you with anything you need.\n\nBoth of our children graduated from Bishop Grimes. It was a very rewarding experience for both! The smaller class size, the genuine commitment of the administration and teachers, the course offerings and the importance of their faith development were of primary importance to us! Bishop Grimes more than provided on all counts! That is why we are overjoyed that now our grandchildren have had the same opportunity to attend BG! Our granddaughter graduated in June and is now a freshman in college studying Elementary Education. Because of her preparedness, she received numerous scholarship offers from various colleges! Our grandson is a junior at Grimes and thriving in academics, sports and music! Bishop Grimes continues to serve God and families in the finest ideals! Go Cobras!\n\nBishop Grimes will forever be my family. I am a proud alumni from the class of 2000! Grimes was my foundation…the start of helping me become the person that I am today. I have succeeded in my career because the teachers took the time to invest in me, to teach me basic as well as the advanced skills needed in life! I learned so much about myself, my faith, my career options and goals during my time there. Bishop Grimes put me on a path to success and the teachers made sure I had the knowledge and strength to go out into the “real world”. I will forever be grateful for the 6 years I spent at Grimes, and am honored to be part of the BG family! Go Cobras!\n\nI look back on my years at BG with a lot of fondness. Some of my very best friendships were made at Bishop Grimes and those people continue to be in my life today. The teachers always took an interest in making sure that I was prepared both in and out of the classroom, and, most importantly, I felt that I was very prepared upon entering my freshman year of college. I am proud to say that now that I have children of my own they are also attending Bishop Grimes, and they're receiving an education that is top quality as well. The teachers go out above and beyond to help, the counseling office offers services that have been extremely helpful to my children, the music and art programs have allowed my children to gain incredible self-confidence, and my children have had an opportunity to play sports at various levels, which they would not have been able to do at a larger public school. It is a special school that has impacted my life and my family's life in wonderful ways.\n\nI have been involved with BG for many years. My children went grades 7-12 at BG and they received a wonderful education. The school prepared them both for college. My grandchildren both also thrived at BG enjoying a great education while being involved in sports, music, performing arts and community service. This school does a wonderful job in providing a well rounded student, ready to tackle college and life as a worthy contributor to society. I have nothing negative to impart"
