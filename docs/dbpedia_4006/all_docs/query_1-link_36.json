        "text": "BRIDGEPORT—The dedication of the new Thomas Merton Family Center in Bridgeport was an occasion to celebrate Catholic social service, charitable giving, and the power of partnering with other health and social service providers to serve the most vulnerable in the Greater Bridgeport area.\n\nMore than 150 volunteers, staff and donors were joined by area leaders today for the ribbon cutting ceremony at the fully renovated, 13,000 square foot facility at 1406 State in Bridgeport. One highlights of the ceremony was the dedication of the center’s new dining facility in honor of Fr. Charles Allen, S.J., retired Fairfield University administrator and teacher.\n\nStaff and volunteers at the new site will officially begin serving meals to the working poor, hungry, and homeless next Wednesday, but the center will also make room for a wide variety of support services including healthcare, job counseling, and immigration service.\n\nRenovation of the two-story building is largely complete but for finishing touches and includes the new a dining hall, state-of-the art commercial kitchen, food pantry, healthcare rooms, a conference room, showers and offices.\n\nThe move to the new location represents an historic moment for Merton Center, which was founded in 1974 by the Diocese of Bridgeport. After operating from two previous downtown locations, it has been serving the poor since 1989, at 43 Madison Avenue in Bridgeport.\n\n“What a moment of grace and blessing for all of us. Thanks be to the Lord for, has allowed us to come to this milestone in the life of the Thomas Merton Family Center. Thank you for being here and for supporting this miracle in the very heart of the city of Bridgeport,” said Bishop Frank J. Caggiano in his introductory remarks.\n\n“We gather today, both as the diocese and as Catholic Charities for this exciting expansion of the Thomas Merton Family Center. For almost 50 years, the center has existed to serve the most vulnerable residents of this great city of Bridgeport. Their mission rests on the belief that every human being has dignity and respect, and everyone who comes to this place is coming into his or her home, where they will be respected and served and loved as the children of God and moving towards the self-sufficiency that we all want for each of our brothers and sisters,” said the bishop.\n\nCatholic Charities Executive Director Mike Donoghue introduced the many community partners who will share space in the Thomas Merton Family Center in order to create to a “one stop” visit for a variety of human services including nutrition and health care, within an environment of caring and respect. He also thanked the many volunteers and donors who have made the move possible.\n\n“I’d really like to thank you for two things; you trusted us to make this project happen, and you supported it with your hard-earned money. Thank you for choosing the Thomas Merton Family Center and for caring about the people in the world that most people don’t want to see or pay any attention to– the homeless, the mentally ill, the working poor. You cared, and it’s going make a big difference on their lives.”\n\nPhotos by Rose Brennan\n\nDonoghue also had words of praise and gratitude for Merton Center director Bill Colson, who always puts the guests first by making the Merton Center “a safe, loving and hope-filled place” for its guests.\n\nHe said that when Merton Center surveyed guests to learn more about what they need in addition to nutrition, they cited healthcare, housing, immigration assistance, and job training.\n\nHe said that by partnering with other agencies in the city like Southwest Community Health Center, Housatonic Community College, Career Resources, and Catholic Charities behavioral health programs, Merton Center can now deliver a wide range of services.\n\nDonoghue also announced that plans are underway to convert the Merton Center site on Madison Avenue, the former St .Joseph German Church, to become 50 units of housing in partnership with Connecticut Housing Partners. The Greater Bridgeport Transit Department has also agreed to provide transportation for Hollow residents to the new facility on State Street.\n\nConnecticut State Representative Steve Stastrom recalled working as a Merton Center volunteer when he was a sophomore at Fairfield University, and he praised the Church’s role in the community.\n\n“We, under-appreciate the role that the Catholic Church plays in really being a pillar of the nonprofit community here in the city of Bridgeport and throughout Fairfield County. You know, we too often devalue the role that our faith institutions play.”\n\n“What I feel here is dignity,” said State Senator Marilyn Moore to staff and volunteers, “I feel that you put your heart and soul into this and that is what it takes when you talking about building community and taking care of people.”\n\nFr. Alex Moronta, Pastor of the nearby St. Peter Parish and newly named chaplain of Merton Center, told the gathering that he worked in South America as a missionary for 30 years and worked in Harlem with the Sisters of Mother Teresa. “She saw the face of Jesus in every person she met. She said that love begins in the. Home, and Merton Center is a home.”\n\nSister Kathleen Deignan, CND, one of the original founders of Merton Center, told the gathering that Merton House grew out of the campus ministry of Sacred Heart University and the leadership of the late Fr. John Giuliani who was inspired by Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker Movement. His vision was also instrumental in the founding Good Shepherd Houses in Norwalk, New Covenant House in Stamford, and Dorothy Day House in Danbury.\n\nThe ribbon cutting ceremony concluded with the dedication of the center’s new dining facility in honor of Fr. Charles Allen, S.J., retired Fairfield University administrator and teacher, who was present for the event and received warm applause from the gathering.\n\nThe bishop said that Fr. Allen’s advocacy for Merton Center as a master of ceremonies for many of its fund raisers over the years helped to keep the doors open and to inspire giving.\n\n“Father Allen understands deeply with a true ear of heart. And to walk with them in compassion and love. Whoever that person may be, most, especially those who are the working poor and the homeless and those who are hungry I am delighted to be able to say that we are going to honor your legacy and your passion by dedicating the largest room of this center to you.”\n\nMerton Center currently services 400 meals every day for breakfast and lunch. It also has a shower program for guests, a mail program to provide an address for the homeless, a food pantry that serves 425 families each month, and case management services.

During the Italian lockdown, anxiety and separation seemed to afflict everyone’s lives. There was so much uncertainty, he thought, as ideas began forming for a book he would write about “the night” that touches the human soul.\n\n“The night that was being lived out was something deeper, vaster and less tangible. It was a sense of disorientation caused by a pandemic that separated individuals, halted future planning and brought into question some of the structures people had based their lives on,” said Dr. Badetti, Professor and Coordinator of Service Learning at Loyola University Chicago, John Felice Rome Center.\n\nOn that evening, as he watched people passing, he says, “It seemed that there was a big question mark hovering in the air, comprising questions like ‘Where are we going? Why? And ‘What is going to happen?’”\n\nBorn in Rome and raised in Stamford, Dr. Badetti says from those initial experiences, his latest book was conceived. “Hope in Darkness: Leaving Night,” which was published by Paulist Press, has been described as “a contemplation of five simple and yet profound questions: Who, What, Why, Where and When?”\n\nThe purpose of the book is to help people “find hope in moments of disorientation.”\n\n“During moments of disorientation, crisis and loss,” he says, “we may grapple with questions that have to do with identity (who we are), community (where do we find support and belonging), time (when will what we wait for come about), reality and meaning (what are we living and why or what for).\n\nHis book refers to these questions as the 5 W’s, which we must answer. He encourages us to live through the questions rather than avoiding them or pushing them aside because answering them will ultimately lead to a “hopeful horizon and new life direction.”\n\nNight is a common theme in the New Testament, he says. Night can connote betrayal and hardship as in the Agony in the Garden that Jesus suffered. But night also can connote freedom and liberation as when St. Peter and the apostles were freed from jail by an angel.\n\n“My book invites readers to live through their nights with fresh hope,” Dr. Badetti says. “It invites them to become aware of their moments of disorientation and difficulty, face the questions that arise through them, and find through those very questions spaces of hope they might not have imagined before.”\n\nThe book contains stories of parents, workers, young adults, refugees, the homeless and the disabled, who are dealing with their personal “nights,” and it includes reflections about our spiritual and psychological needs.\n\n“I bring together a variety of experiences,” he says. “Hopefully, people won’t fall into the trap of thinking, ‘Oh, it’s about that group of people, so it doesn’t speak to me’ … because it does.”\n\nDr. Badetti returned to his native Rome to teach theology at the John Felice Rome Center of Loyola University Chicago. He also coordinates Service Learning and the First Year Experience. As part of Service Learning, he encourages students to combine in-classroom learning with reflective engagement with marginalized communities in Rome. The First Year Experience supports first-year students as they transition and grow into the experience of a new educational context, a new country, and a new community.\n\nIn 1998, his family moved to Stamford, and he graduated from Westhill High School. He went to Franciscan University of Steubenville in Ohio where he received a degree in theology and communications and a minor in philosophy and mental health and human services.\n\nHe received a master’s in clinical psychology from the Institute for Psychological Studies in Arlington, Va., and a doctorate in disability studies from the University of Illinois, Chicago.\n\nWhile he was a student at Franciscan University, he began reading about L’Arche communities, consisting of homes and workplaces where people with and without intellectual disabilities live and work together as peers in a spirit of simplicity. He began volunteering at a Massachusetts community outside of Boston and later served as Director of Community Life at L’Arche Chicago.\n\nL’Arche communities provide homes and workplaces where people with and without intellectual disabilities live and work together as peers in a spirit of simplicity. “L’Arche” is French for “the ark,” referring to Noah’s Ark, a symbol for refuge and the covenant between God and humanity.\n\nWhile in Chicago, he taught at Loyola University’s Institute for Pastoral Studies and DePaul University’s Peace, Justice and Conflict Studies program.\n\nHis first book, “I Believe in You,” is a compilation of stories about how people with disabilities can widen our understanding of ourselves and of God.\n\nThe following pastoral letter was written by Father William Platt, pastor of the Parish of St. Catherine of Siena-St. Agnes, Riverside.\n\nMonday, November 27, 2023\n\nDear Parishioners,\n\nAs we end the liturgical year and begin the Advent Season on Sunday, December 3, 2023, I would like to share with you important news affecting our parish community.\n\nThe Future of the St. Agnes Campus\n\nAs you know, the parish has been deeply involved in a heartfelt conversation over the past several months on the future of the St. Agnes campus. It was important for me as pastor to hear the thoughts and opinions of everyone in the parish, including the Parish Council and Finance Council. To this end, I held a parish leadership meeting on August 23, 2023, in which I presented the recommendation to close the St. Agnes campus. Attendees at this meeting included members of the Finance Council, including Bob Rooney, George Erensen, and Bob Howe; members of the Building and Grounds Committee, including MJ Desnoyers, Althea Howe, Eileen Grasso and Kevin Ruebenstahl; parish trustees – Jeannemarie Baker and Kevin Erensen; members of the Parish Council, including Evelyn Wilson, Rhonda Morley, and Tom Gallagher; and Anne McCrory; and the Chief Legal and Real Estate Officer, Diocese of Bridgeport, among others.\n\nSubsequently, I published a Pastoral Letter to the Parish Community dated August 24, 2023, in which I shared some important developments in the life of the parish, including the acquisition of 19 Riverside Avenue and the possible closure of the St. Agnes campus.\n\nWe then held four open meetings in September and October 2023, in which any parishioner could attend to offer their thoughts about my August 2023 proposal to Bishop Caggiano to close the St. Agnes campus and consolidate parish activities at the St. Catherine campus. Over 200 people attended the four meetings. In view of the fact that about 500 people attend Mass on any given Sunday at both campuses, this represents a significant direct representation of the people of the parish.\n\nI also followed up those general meetings with a number of personal meetings for those who had lingering questions about the rationale that has prompted my August 2023 proposal to Bishop Caggiano to close the St. Agnes campus.\n\nFurther, Bishop Caggiano visited the parish for a meeting of the Finance Council on September 14, 2023, attended by Bob Rooney, Kevin Erensen, Tom Raymond, Bob Howe, George Erensen, Jessica Baehr and Tom Gallagher. Subsequently, on October 7, 2023, Bishop Caggiano met at the parish with the broader parish leadership, including the two trustees – Jeannemarie Baker and Kevin Erensen, joined by George Erensen, Bob Howe, Jessica Baehr, Sandra Marr, Kevin Ruebenstahl, Tom Raymond, Tom Gallagher and Rhonda Morley, among others, as well as parish staff.\n\nAt each meeting, Bishop Caggiano asked a series of questions in order to better understand the nature of any objections to the proposed closure and sale. Bishop Caggiano found the interchanges to be very helpful and informative. Subsequently, the Finance Council and the Parish Council – both advisory councils, voted 6-4 and 11-1-1, respectively, to move forward with the closure and sale of the St. Agnes campus. According to canon law, such votes of both councils are consultative in nature. This means that the vote is meant to help guide me, the pastor, in whatever decision I make in this regard. This is the case because the pastoral life and welfare of the people of the parish are the paramount responsibility of the pastor, whose perspective is naturally different from the perspective of individual parishioners, or even groups within the parish. In short, these votes do not dictate whether to close the St. Agnes campus. They are meant to give additional guidance to the pastor who will make the decision and send it to Bishop Caggiano for ratification.\n\nThe Role of Bishop Caggiano in the Process\n\nBishop Caggiano received my proposal to close and sell the St. Agnes campus in August 2023. He then undertook broad consultation with the parish, as outlined above, and with his diocesan advisors. The bishop’s role is to either ratify or overturn the pastor’s recommendation.\n\nOne might say that the bishop is making the decision. In fact, it is significantly different for two reasons. First, it is always presumed that any pastor, having heard his people, once he makes a decision and sends it to the bishop, does so because he has concluded that the action is in the best interests of his people and his parish. What is essential in validating any pastor’s proposal is that he has spent time listening to his people and reflecting upon what they have said, both publicly and privately, and in good faith makes his decision and can articulate the reasons that motivate his decision.\n\nBishop Caggiano has met with me three times and I have answered all of his many questions. In addition, I have presented Bishop Caggiano a pastoral plan that articulates my vision for the parish. A copy is attached at the link below. As such, my decision to close and sell the St. Agnes campus is not arbitrary or motivated to hurt the people of the parish. Bishop Caggiano has found no canonical grounds that can justify overturning the proposal.\n\nBishop Caggiano believes very strongly that the principle of subsidiarity must be respected in the proper governance of the Church. What does this mean? Essentially, what this implies is that the pastor has true leadership over his people precisely because he is on the local scene and knows the people, issues and problems facing his community better than the bishop.\n\nTo ensure further due diligence, Bishop Caggiano brought my proposal to consultation at the diocesan level at the Diocesan Finance Council (composed of lay business leaders from throughout the diocese), the Presbyteral Council (composed of 24 priests, the vast majority who serve as pastors and deans throughout the diocese) and the College of Consultors (seven priests who serve as the highest body with which the bishop consults). All three bodies heard the proposal, read my rationale for a pastoral vision moving forward, and asked a number of clarifying questions. All three bodies voted unanimously to recommend the proposal be ratified.\n\nA Changing Landscape for Ministry\n\nOver the past few months, some have commented on the statement that Bishop Caggiano made at the time of the merger that the St. Agnes campus would not be sold. At the time of the merger and capital campaign, Bishop Caggiano made those comments in good faith and meant what he said. However, what is now changed is the situation we face as a Church. The situation that existed four years ago is radically different coming out of the pandemic. Given the lack of recovery in the post-pandemic Church, what is clear to Bishop Caggiano is that the principles upon which we based our past planning and ministerial activities are insufficient to revitalize the Church. If they were effective, then those who saw no reason to return would have returned. However, they have not returned.\n\nThe birth of the “One” is the Bishop’s direct response to this essential change. As you may know, the “One” refers to the one priority that will reorganize and advance all pastoral ministry in every parish and school, providing every believer with opportunities to re-encounter Christ on a daily basis and to be accompanied in discipleship. Over time, this single priority will reshape almost every aspect of parish and diocesan ministry. Thus, what was inconceivable even four years ago may now be viable within a larger plan for revitalization. In other words, the question whether the St. Agnes campus is sold or not must now be seen against this new context – a context that no one, including Bishop Caggiano, could have imagined we would face just four years ago.\n\nThe Closure of the St. Agnes Campus\n\nAfter much deliberation and discernment among the Parish community and with me, Bishop Caggiano has ratified my decision to close and sell the St. Agnes campus.\n\nWe Stand with Christ Capital Campaign (WSWC)\n\nDonors to the We Stand with Christ Campaign will receive a separate communication shortly regarding how the St. Agnes campus closure may impact their gift to the capital campaign. We are mindful that some donors, large and small, in light of the decision to close the St. Agnes campus, may feel differently about the donations given to support the St. Agnes campus project. The specifics on requests for return of campaign donations are clearly explained in this separate communication.\n\nDiscussions with Greenwich Country Day School\n\nThe parish is in formal discussions with Greenwich Country Day School (GCDS) about the sale of the recently appraised St. Agnes campus to GCDS. We have just received an updated appraisal, which confirms that the current sale being negotiated with GCDS is well within the range of the appraised value of the land. The sale of the St. Agnes campus would require agreement by both parties through a fully negotiated Purchase and Sale Agreement.\n\nThe Reinterment of Monsignor James J. McLaughlin (1913-1985)\n\nA former St. Agnes pastor, Monsignor James J. McLaughlin, was moved several years ago from his original interment at the Priests’ Circle at St. Mary’s – Putnam Cemetery and reinterred in the front lawn at the St. Agnes campus. Independent of the decision regarding the St. Agnes campus, the diocese determined that in order to be consistent with its policies governing the respectful burial of priests in Catholic cemeteries, the issue needed to be addressed. The diocese has reserved, dignified burial graves for all diocesan priests, given to them as a gift, to be their final place of rest. Therefore, Monsignor McLaughlin was reinterred at the Priests’ Circle on November 14th. The respectful transfer was handled by a team from the Diocesan Cemeteries office in association with Hoyt Funeral Home.\n\nAdvent and Christmas Services at the St. Agnes Campus\n\nMass during Advent will take place each Sunday at 10 am at St. Agnes. The 8:30 am Sunday Mass at St. Agnes has been discontinued. The Spanish and Korean Masses will be relocated to the St. Catherine campus for the first Sunday of Advent.\n\nChildren’s Christmas Pageant\n\nAs we enter the Advent season, there will be much activity at the parish, and we encourage you and your families to participate and be present for these events. On Sunday, December 10, 2023, at 1:30 pm, there will be a bilingual Christmas Pageant at the St. Catherine’s campus. More information will be available soon.\n\nFinal Mass at the St. Agnes Campus\n\nThe final Mass at St. Agnes will be on Sunday, December 31, 2023, at 10 am. A parish celebration of the legacy of St. Agnes will be planned and more information will be forthcoming on this event. We encourage suggestions from parishioners as we plan this event, particularly those with long histories at St Agnes.\n\nThe St. Agnes Campus Grotto\n\nIn the coming weeks, the St. Agnes campus grotto will be moved to the St. Catherine’s campus and stored until a fitting location is established as its new home.\n\n###\n\nThis has been a trying time for all of us at the parish as we, along with Bishop Caggiano, discerned a way forward. It is no doubt particularly difficult for those whose lives have been intertwined with the St. Agnes campus for many, many years. The parish is going through a transformational moment in time. My prayer is that each of us will embrace this transformation and contribute to it with our time and talent.\n\nWe pray, especially during the Advent Season, that we will be well-prepared to welcome the Infant Jesus on Christmas morning.\n\nVery truly yours in Christ,\n\nReverend William F. Platt\n\nPastor\n\nBy Joe Pisani\n\nThe Fairfield County Catholic Cemeteries will host two Trees of Remembrance events during Advent and Christmas to give families an opportunity to remember loved ones who have passed by hanging ornaments in their memory.\n\nMembers of the community are invited to take part in the events, which will be held at St. Mary-Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich and the St. Joseph Center in Trumbull. The family members do not have to be buried in the Catholic Cemeteries.\n\n“Hanging an ornament with the name of a person you love who has died can be so healing,” said Carolyn Killian, Director of Bereavement for the Diocese of Bridgeport. “It can take a hard time and transform it into a healing moment, not just for you but for other members of your family.”\n\nJenine Berardesca, Family Services Director for Catholic Cemeteries, began the tradition last year in Greenwich, where some 200 people gathered to put ornaments on a 10-foot-tall spruce, which was lit throughout the Advent and Christmas season. She says they are already getting inquiries about this year’s event from throughout the diocese.\n\n“It will give families a time to come together mutually and celebrate their loved ones during the holiday season,” Berardesca said. “The event is family friendly, and it will be a celebration of the season and a celebration of life. It is not limited to families of any denomination or to families only from Greenwich. Our invitation is joyously extended to everyone.”\n\nBerardesca recalls that last year one of the employees of Catholic Cemeteries, who had lost his father, volunteered to hang the ornaments and was surprised to be holding one that said, “Merry First Christmas in Heaven, Dad.”\n\n“It had a great impact on him and showed him that all people have a common bond when it comes to grief,” she said.\n\nAnother employee was observing the 20th anniversary of his brother’s death and was moved by the impact the Remembrance Tree had upon him.\n\n“It gave them both an outlet for their grief,” Berardesca said. “And showed them that the miracle of Christmas can turn even grief into hope. It’s not an evening about loss, but about the reunions that are sure to come. The Holy Spirit was with us, and it wasn’t a time of loss. It was a time of hope.”\n\nThe tree at St. Mary-Putnam Cemetery will be available to the public from Monday, November 27 until Friday, January 5, 2024. There will be a lighting ceremony with a special blessing, music and complimentary refreshments on Thursday, November 30 from 5 to 7 p.m. at 399 North Street in Greenwich. Berardesca requests that you do not bring ornaments that have great sentimental or financial value. For further information, call (203) 742-1510 or go to info@ctcemeteries.org\n\nCarolyn Killian, who is organizing the event at St. Joseph Center in Trumbull, said individuals and families can bring an ornament or choose a complimentary one to place on the tree, which will be blessed by Father Nick Pavia, chaplain, during a lighting ceremony on Wednesday, November 29 at 4 p.m. St. Joseph Center, which is a nursing care facility, is located at 6448 Main Street in Trumbull. Complimentary refreshments will be provided by Abriola Parkview Funeral Home.\n\nFor further information, call (203) 404-0820 or email nancy.bentley@ctcemeteries.org\n\n“It is very healing to have rituals in place at Christmas because they help you remember to hold the person you’ve lost in your heart during what can be a difficult time of year for those who are grieving,” Killian said. “In the holiday season, everyone seems to be very happy, but when you’re grieving you often feel you can’t do this stuff anymore.”\n\nShe encourages anyone, who knows someone suffering a loss, to reach out with simple acts of kindness, such as helping them set up their tree if they plan to decorate one, saying a prayer for them, and offering to assist them any way possible during a painful time in their lives.\n\n“These small gestures will help them on their healing journey — along with other members of their family because we never grieve alone,” Killian said. “When you hang an ornament on the tree with the name of someone you love, you recognize your grief, you remember your loved one, and you perform a small act that moves you forward and helps you heal.”\n\nKillian also said the event at St. Joseph Center is intended to help the elderly community, many of whom have seen many losses in their lives.\n\n“We have to support our seniors,” she said. “And knowing how difficult the holidays can be for them, I thought an event like this would recognize them, give them a way to grieve, and provide an opportunity to come together.”\n\nBy Joe Pisani\n\nSTRATFORD — How often have you heard the sad lament of a discouraged parent: “Where did I go wrong?” Especially when kids don’t turn out the way you wanted them to. But what about a father who utters, “Where did I go wrong?” because his son wants to be baptized a Catholic, who prays the rosary and who opposes abortion.\n\nCatholic author James Carmody of St. Mark Church in Stratford, wrote a short play that centers on a discussion between a father and a son from a fractured family. The angry middle-aged man and his college-aged son see the world differently — and find themselves poring over the tragedies in their family and debating the Catholic faith, abortion, and the power of prayer. Somewhere in that intense and agonizing conversation, God’s grace intervenes … and things will never be the same.\n\nCarmody’s play, “Falling Apart to Come Together, was among six that were selected for the 2023 Catholic Playwrights Festival at Theatre 71 at Blessed Sacrament Church, just off Broadway in Manhattan.\n\nCarmody wrote the play and acted in it. The character of the son was played by his son, Andrew, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering at Franciscan University of Steubenville.\n\n“The play is about a man who is very anti-Catholic, and we don’t really know why,” Carmody said. “And when the play starts he is sitting with his son, who tells him he has to debate about abortion at his Catholic college.”\n\nThe father informs the boy, “This is a pro-choice family.” But after a few minutes, you realize the play involves much more than a debate about Catholic morality. There’s a lot of repressed pain and anger.\n\nHis wife, who was Catholic, died and gave her son a rosary, which he uses to pray for his father, who is an angry and wounded man. His other son left home for New Mexico because his girlfriend got pregnant, and the father insisted she have an abortion.\n\nEventually, the son gets to the point and tells his father he’s going to be baptized at the Catholic college he attends and wants him to be there. And slowly but certainly God’s grace is at work through the young man.\n\n“The question is can the father accept the grace that is being offered,” Carmody said. “Can he see it and recognize it as a way out of his anger and pain and have a reunification with his son, who giving him an opportunity to cooperate with God’s grace. God is working through the son.”`\n\nThe emotional intensity of the play escalates. At the end, the father and son embrace as the man says, “I don’t get it … where did I go wrong? I didn’t see any of this coming. I was blind to all of this. When did you begin to think about all of this?”\n\nThe son responded: “When Mom gave me this, shortly before she died.” And he shows him the rosary. “I have been saying this rosary every day since Mom gave it to me.”\n\n“I never wanted my life to be like this,” the father says. “How did our family fall apart like this?”\n\nThe son tells him, “There was never anything to hold it together … until now.”\n\nCarmody, who taught English and theater at New York’s Information Technology High School, had a previous play titled, “Where’s Mommy,” performed at the Harold Clurman Theatre. He is currently working on two plays, one about Ukraine and the other about homelessness.\n\nCarmody also spent more than a decade researching and writing a historical novel about Lt. Joseph Petrosino titled, “The Giant Killer,” based on the life and exploits of the most renowned Italian-American law officer in the city’s history, who was known as the “Italian Sherlock Holmes.”\n\nThe book, which was published by Pocol Press and is available on Amazon, begins on January 5, 1905 when one of the worst blizzards in history paralyzed the city. A bomb set off in a barber shop leaves one man dead, and in the weeks that follow, there is a series of bombings as Petrosino pursues his investigation.\n\nTheatre 71, which sponsored the series of short Catholic plays, is connected to Blessed Sacrament Church on 152 West 71st Street.\n\n“Theater 71 at Blessed Sacrament presents professional theatrical and musical performances, which support our parish community both financially and spiritually by uplifting spirits of those who attend,” said Susan Campochiaro Confrey, the artistic director. “We regularly have different performances, music, dance and films that are appropriate for a Catholic audience — with events for children as well as adults.”\n\nFor more information, visit (https://www.theatre71.org)\n\nDANBURY – A celebration of sacred masterpieces for choir and organ that offer reverence to the Mass will be performed at St. Joseph Parish in Danbury. Antonín Dvořák’s Mass in D major will be performed at 3 pm in the Robinson Avenue church on Saturday, November 19.\n\nThis is the third concert being presented to the parish community and the Greater Danbury area that focuses on the prominent works of master composers who have enhanced the musical and spiritual experience of the Mass.\n\n“Bishop Frank Caggiano in his pastoral initiative called ‘The One’ reminds us that beauty is a doorway to the sacred,” said Father Samuel V. Scott, pastor of St. Joseph’s. “St. Joseph Parish is offering an opportunity to open that doorway with an experience of sacred music of extraordinary beauty.”\n\nThe featured work is a glorious setting of the Ordinary of the Mass, including the “Lord Have Mercy, Gloria, Creed, Holy, Holy, Holy and Lamb of God,” composed by Dvořák, said Robert Fertitta, Director of Music at St. Joseph Parish. “It is magical and miraculous the way he captures it all.”\n\n“These texts are universal,” Fertitta said. “To go to an event where this text is being sung in Latin with the English translation in hand is a highly rewarding experience.”\n\nThe opening words of the second section, “Gloria in Excelsis Deo,” are set to an exuberant fanfare, followed immediately by a complete contrast with the words, “and peace to His people on earth” set in a lyrical but still joyful mood,” Fertitta explained. The exuberance then continues with the words “we praise You, we bless You, we adore You, we glorify You,” bringing the opening section of the Gloria to a powerful conclusion.\n\n“In a way it is operatic, in that it is dramatic but not to a secular text,” Fertitta said. “The listener gets to hear all five pieces in succession, unlike the way they are presented during an actual Mass.”\n\nDvořák’s work is structured as the mass text prescribes, with most parts performed by both soloists and choir including the Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus and Agnus Dei.\n\n“The interplay between the choir and organ is remarkable throughout the entire Mass,” Fertitta said.\n\nThe hour-long concert¸ which will feature 13 professional singers, many of whom have previously performed at St. Joseph Masses, will conclude with masterpieces by Felix Mendelssohn and César Franck.\n\n“Our choral artists under the direction of Robert Fertitta, the Director of Music and organist at the parish, are giving us a graceful opportunity to grow in our cultural formation and draw us closer to God,” Father Scott said. “We stand in a debt of gratitude to them.”\n\nIn June, “Remembrance: A Concert of Sacred Vocal Masterpieces,” was hosted at the church and in December an international 200th birthday celebration for the work of Catholic composer César Franck was held.\n\n“The audience will be hearing something unique,” Fertitta said. “The healing power of musical masterworks is like no other. It is a rare and special way to experience the Mass.”"
