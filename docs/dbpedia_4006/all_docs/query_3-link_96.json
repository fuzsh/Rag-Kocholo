Rowboat and kayak rentals are available weekends only through Columbus Day at the Boat House, weather permitting.\n\nPet Policy\n\nA maximum of two pets are allowed in campsites and day use areas unless prohibited by sign or directive. Pets are to be supervised at all times and either be crated or on a leash not more than 6-feet in length. Proof of rabies inoculation shall be produced if requested by staff. Pets are not permitted in playgrounds, buildings, golf courses, boardwalks, pools and spray-grounds or guarded beaches (this does not apply to service animals).\n\nGreen Lakes State Park's outstanding features are its two glacial lakes surrounded by upland forest. Both Round and Green Lakes are meromictic lakes, which means that there is no fall and spring mixing of surface and bottom waters. Such lakes have a high potential for evidence of ancient plant and animal life. Another special feature of the park is the 18-hole Green Lakes State Park Golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones. Visitors can also snowshoe in winter, and there are 15 miles of trails that cross-country skiers can use.\n\nDue to the sensitive nature of both Green and Round Lakes, no outside/private boats, kayaks, or canoes are allowed. You can rent rowboats and kayaks from our boat house right at the beach. Open Memorial Day to Labor Day.\n\nThanks to a grant from Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, a Hippocampe Beach/All Terrain wheelchair is now available at Green Lakes State Park to access beach and trails. The wheelchair is available for use at no charge on a first come, first serve basis from 11am-7pm. Please check with the lifeguards at the beach for availability.\n\nPavilion Information\n\nGreen Lakes has five pavilions/rooms. Prices range from $100 to $600 and can accommodate 25 to 100 people. Check availability at ReserveAmerica.com\n\nCurrent Water Quality - Beach Results\n\nPet Policy: Pets are to be supervised at all times and either to be crated or on a leash not more than 6-feet in length. If staying overnight in the campgrounds, proof of rabies inoculation will need to be shown to park staff. Pets are not permitted within our boats, playgrounds, buildings, golf courses, boardwalks, and guarded beaches (this does not apply to service animals).\n\nWe are fully booked for May and June Field Trips! If you are looking for a summer program with us please fill out our Ladders to the Outdoors Program Request Form:\n\nhttps://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=6rhs9AB5EE2M64Dowcge50l-lS9vmkpMtn91Hna9vVpUMVBaOTdXS0xIRFoxV1hKWlVFRFEwSjFCSy4u\n\nThe Central Region Environmental Education Team offers a variety of programs in our parks. Each park offers their own free public programs.\n\nGroup Programs\n\nWe offer guided programs for groups (of 10 or more). To coordinate a group program at Clark Reservation or Green Lakes State Park please email Katie.Mulverhill@parks.ny.gov. If you are interested in a program at any of our other state parks, please reach out to the park office directly to schedule your visit.\n\nField Trips\n\nGreen Lakes State Park: Home to rare lakes, old growth forests, and aquatic habitats, Green Lakes State Park offers the perfect outdoor classroom. Students see scientific concepts come to life in the real world. Our programs align with NY P-12 science standards. Each program has three four 30-min stations that classes rotate through.\n\nCheck back in August for our 2024-2025 Field Trip Request Form\n\nK-1: Animal Survival Skills- Explore adaptations animals use to survive in many different habitats at Green Lakes. Observe real life animals captured on trail cam videos to see what they do when they think no one is watching! Any season.\n\n2: Engineers Against Erosion- Get your hands dirty learning how engineers are protecting our visitors and lakes from erosion. Then test out your own ideas! Spring only.\n\n3-4: Sculpted by Nature: Learn how glaciers carved the park's landscape and created our unique lakes full of unusual life. Try your hand at carving the landscape by reading topographic maps. Spring or Fall.\n\n5: Ecosystem Encounters- Discover what interdependent relationships in ecosystems can teach us about protecting wildlife at Green Lakes State Park. Any season.\n\n5-6: Environmental Field Days- Join us for this annual event that's over 20 years old! Classes rotate through six 20-min stations throughout the day! Presenters from across CNY lead the stations, including live animal presentation. This even is usually held on the first Thursday and Friday of October.\n\nHigh School: Our Lake Study field trip includes hands-on water quality testing and studying life from the lake (from small bacteria to fish!) Fall only.\n\nFor Everyone: our most popular request is for a guided hike around Green Lakes. These can be formal or informal and can include an array of different topics.\n\nWe offer several program topics to choose from, but if you don't see what you are looking for let us know. We are working on adding to our lesson plans and will gladly create something teachers request if time permits. The Education Center has heat, so visit us any time of year.\n\nConnect Kids to State Parks Field Trip Grants: Looking for ways to make field trips more affordable? Our Connect Kids to Parks Transportation Reimbursement Grants cover most of the costs associated with a field trip to state lands; including busing, entrance and program fees, or contracting for special programs."
