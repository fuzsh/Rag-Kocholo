        "text": "A Lesson in Faith\n\nUSD Magazine (Spring 2002)\n\nBy Susan Herold/Photos by Gary Payne ’86\n\nOpening a private Catholic school in one of San Diego’s poorest neighborhoods is a huge challenge, but David Rivera ’96, prefers his challenges giant-sized. His students are labeled “at-risk,” his teachers have no experience, and money is a constant problem. Yet his belief in God gets him through.\n\nA mouse is running loose in the tottering, two story Victorian David Rivera to house his volunteer teachers and it’s got him stumped. A visit from the Orkin man proved fruitless. Unsprung traps, picked clean of their food, taunt him. And now, the pricey electronic device that is supposed to emit a noise and scare away the furry thing, is discovered unplugged. The 10 teachers who live in the house (9 of whom are women) are understandably getting edgy. Rivera is starting wonder what kind of rodent he is up against.\n\nIt’s not surprising that a man who chose the most improbable of scenarios as his life’s work - opening a tuition-free, Catholic school in San Diego’s worst neighborhood, with a staff of greenhorn college graduates as teachers is playing David to a Goliath of a mouse. It’s a role he’s been comfortable in since the age of 26, when he decided that slaying giants in the form of social problems was his calling. Turning his back on a six figure income, a hilltop house and a player lifestyle, Rivera did what many consider unthinkable: he adopted a bare bones existence and an unshakable faith in God that compels him to serve others.\n\nHe has found himself serving a handful of 11-year-olds left behind by the education system, kids labeled “at-risk” because they are poor, can’t read or act out because that’s the only behavior they know. Rivera opened a one-room school in their neighborhood in September and promised a 12-hour school day, Saturday classes and breakfast, lunch and dinner. He filled the kids’ heads with dreams of a college degree if they committed to the demanding curriculum. He filled their parents’ hearts with hope.\n\nRivera used his considerable charm and determination to wheedle money and advice from community leaders frustrated with politicians’ empty promises to improve education. He lured graduates from the nation’s top universities to teach in exchange for room and board. He convinced his alma mater, USD, to help his rookie teachers become great teachers by covering most of the cost of their master’s degrees in education.\n\nOn this day, like most, Rivera is trying to do too much with too little. In between taking a delivery of donated copier paper and frantic calls about mutant mice, he is looking for more money to keep the small school afloat. The tired van that transports the kids to swim lessons is barely lurching along. About $18,000 in bills comes due each month and he has $6,000 in the bank. A promised big-money donation fell through because of the flailing stock market. Yet Rivera’s not worried. He believes in divine intervention, says God will provide. He has in the past — in October, with $19 in the bank, a donor came through to keep the school going.\n\n“How big of a risk really is it?” says Rivera, now 34, of his decision to walk away from a successful career and try to improve education For San Diego’s poor kids.\n\n“I could get a job doing anything tomorrow. There is no risk in it for me compared to the children and families here who have little hope or opportunity,” he says from outside his “house,” an 8-by.20.foor construction trailer behind the teachers’ home in Logan Heights. An extension cord snaking across rhe dirt backyard provides his electricity; he sleeps on a cot. His salary is $91 a week.\n\n“These kids who come to school and these teachers who traveled a thousand miles to work here for nothing, they are the ones who are taking the risk,” he says. “Talk to them. They’re the story, not me.”\n\nBut you can’t tell the story of this improbable school without David Rivera. Those who signed on for his dream of giving low-income kids a first-rate education will tell you the sheer force of his will makes the school possible. “Would this school exist in San Diego without David Rivera? No,” says USD Provost Frank Lazarus. “To start a school like this takes a visionary with an absolute passion for getting it done. David has that.”\n\nA little more than two years ago, Rivera walked into Lazarus’ office with nothing more than an idea - finding a way to help San Diego’s poor kids get a better life. He began by asking Lazarus the same question he had posed to other San Diego community leaders. “What is the biggest need these kids have?” The responses were identical: education.\n\nSo Rivera, who has no background in education, decided he would find the worst neighborhood in the city and come up with a better way to reach its kids.\n\nHe turned down job offers as an attorney that would have covered the $60,000 he owes for his Notre Dame law degree to move back into his parents’ San Diego house. He covered his bedroom walls with city maps, analyzed census data on income, crime and home occupancy, pored over tables on public school performance. The pushpins rose like a red welt out of Logan Heights, a hardscrabble neighborhood east of downtown, where the annual household income is $18,000 and the population is two-thirds Hispanic.\n\nRivera had a neighborhood. Now he needed a plan. On a flight to a friend’s wedding in Philadelphia, Rivera leafed through a Parade Magazine and found a story about Nativity Prep schools. Started 30 years ago by a group of New York Jesuits, the Nativity Prep philosophy contends that 12-hour class days, a low student-teacher ratio, college-prep work and a healthy respect for Catholic values will lead at-risk children to success. The concept works: 80 percent of the children graduating from the original Nativity Prep in New York have gone on to college. There are now 40 similar schools throughout the country.\n\nWhen Rivera’s plane landed, he rushed to a phone booth, looked up the address and found Philadelphia’s school. After meeting the well-mannered kids, who talked about their plans to go to college despite their circumstances, he knew what he wanted to create.\n\nRivera parked himself in the principal’s office at the University of San Diego High School to learn as much as he could about running a school. He set up meetings with experts like USD’s School of Education Dean Paula Cordeiro and veteran Catholic school principal Brian Bennett. He picked their brains, asked for their help and created an education advisory board.\n\n“There was nothing in San Diego similar to Nativity Prep, a school that deals specifically with very, very low-income students and develops a Catholic relationship,” Rivera says. “I told my advisers about it, and they said, ’Go out and do whatever you need to make it happen.’”\n\nRivera did. He got help writing a business plan and a needs assessment to get funding for the school, landing 5300,000 in grants - including 550,000 each from San Diego companies Sandicast and Hoehn Motors, and S120,000 from the Catholic Cassin Foundation—on little more than his passion. “I had no idea what a needs assessment was,” Rivera says. “I was embarrassed to tell Dean Cordeiro that when she said I needed one.”\n\nHe convinced one of his advisers, veteran Catholic school principal Bob Heveron, to come out of retirement and run the school. Rivera had to hire teachers, bur had no money for salaries. With USD’s help he discovered that AmeriCorps would send him volunteer teachers, college graduates interested in service work for two years. To make the deal sweeter, he convinced Lazarus and USD to pick up most of the tab for the teachers’ graduate degrees in education.\n\nRivera and his advisers decided the school should start out teaching fifth graders. Eleven-year-olds, they reasoned, had yet to hit puberty, and hopefully were not drawn in by the gangs and drugs and sex that filled their streets. They’d reach the kids through their parents, pitching the school during Mass in neighborhood parishes, posting fliers, going door-to-door. It was last summer, and Rivera wanted classes to begin in the fall.\n\n“People said I should slow down, consider other areas of San Diego, wait,” says Rivera. “But the need was too great. I wanted kids in those seats.”\n\nIt was a great plan, a beautiful dream. And it had next to no chance of coming together.\n\nTwo thousand miles from San Diego, Tracey Pavey hung up the phone. The Notre Dame graduate just promised Rivera, who she had met via e-mail, that she would teach at his school in San Diego, a city she had never visited, for two years for $35 a week.\n\nPavey was thrilled. She always had teaching in the back of her mind, although she majored in business. The thought of giving it a try ata new school for low-income kids appealed to her altruism. Her mom was worried about her moving halfway across country; her dad thought she was nuts for pitching a Notre Dame business degree in favor of volunteer work.\n\nBut Pavey liked the idea of receiving a USD master’s degree without having to take out a loan. She liked what Rivera told her about living in a big house, a la MTV’s “Real World,” with other college grads who wanted to help poor kids. She liked the idea of putting her business background to use in a start-up education venture.\n\n“I thought it would be cool to be in on building a school from scratch,” says Pavey, who hails from Rushville, Ind. With her dishwater blond hair hanging at her shoulders, her clean-scrubbed face and broad smile, the 22-year-old looks more like a big sister than a math teacher who answers to the name Ms. Pavey.\n\n“I e-mailed and talked to David several times, and he convinced me to move out. I get out here, and there is nothing. No school. We don’t even have a house to live in. I thought, ’Are you kidding me?’”\n\nWhen Pavey and the other teachers arrived last August, their house - which was the site of several recent drug busts - was still in escrow. The building Rivera hoped to lease for the school had been rented to another tenant. Nativity Prep was to open in six weeks, and it didn’t even have students.\n\n“David told us that everyone in the county knew about Nativity Prep. My first day here, I passed out fliers about the school in the neighborhood, and people were saying ’What new school?’ ” Pavey says. “They hadn’t heard of us. It was frustrating.”\n\nWhile waiting for escrow to close on the six-bedroom, two-bath house that had been turned into apartments, Rivera scrambled, moving the teachers from donated dormitories at USD to a Best Western hotel. When keys to the $205,000 house were turned over to Rivera, a woman and her five grandchildren were still living in the upstairs flat. The electricity didn’t work in two of the bedrooms. The kitchen and bathrooms were filthy. The transplanted teachers had to rip up carpet and knock down walls, doing much of the work by candlelight.\n\nTeacher Margaret Liegel lived out of her suitcase in the living room with another teacher for nearly three months. Her room was the one occupied by the grandmother, who Rivera didn’t have the heart to evict until she found another place.\n\n“We had to go out and get donations to get the house fixed, and we’re washing walls with cockroaches running out,” says Liege!, who graduated from Boston College. “I think I came out here thinking this is a really cool thing we’re doing, and then it hit you, oh my gosh, what am I doing here?”\n\nA few weeks before classes were to begin, Rivera signed a lease on an empty building in Logan Heights for the school. Seven days before the doors opened, the teachers hosted an open house for interested families. They scattered the few textbooks they had throughout the room to make it more impressive.\n\n“We were rearranging stuff to make it look like we had something,” says Pavey. “We didn’t even have bulletin boards. I thought the families would turn around and walk out.”\n\nThey didn’t. Nineteen children enrolled, and Rivera’s school had its first class. Driving through San Diego’s Logan Heights neighborhood, you would miss Nativity Prep Academy unless you knew exactly what to look for. The one-room school is in a squat, concrete structure tucked between warehouses and plywood homes behind chain-link fences. A hand-painted sign with the school’s logo - a white dove soaring over the three-story schoolhouse - is propped up against the curb. The only hint that children may be here is the lone basketball hoop in a corner of the parking lot, which doubles as the playground.\n\nInside, Liegel clears off some space from a table piled with papers to pore over her notes from her language class. Each day, she and the other teachers prepare incredibly detailed reports of their students’ progress and behavior. When parents arrive at 7 p.m. to pick up their kids, the teachers hand them the reports. They’ll pull a parent aside if they have a concern. It’s just one example of the intensive approach the school takes. “A lot of these kids were sullen when they first came here, they never smiled,” says Liegel, 23, whose glasses and ponytail enhance her rep as one of the “hard teachers among the kids.\n\n“They pretended they were tough because in this neighborhood they had to. Here, though, they can be kids.” If a child is having a bad day or acts our, a teacher’s first instinct is to phone the parents and find out what is going on at home. In one case, a student’s big brother was getting out of prison and moving back into the house; in another, a student missed school because the family lost their apartment and was living at the Sr. Vincent de Paul shelter.\n\nNearly all the students have special needs - most tested at or barely above third-grade level in reading and math. Some have trouble speaking and understanding English. Every one of them comes from the neighborhood’s public schools, where they were promoted from grade to grade along with the rest of the kids.\n\nTo make sure the children get the attention they need, two teachers are always in the classroom; usually there are four or five. Reading, language and math are taught in blocks. Lesson plans are theme-based: a week may focus on insects, so students do math problems, write a research paper and do experiments revolving around bugs.\n\nReligious studies, art history, physical education and social skills also are taught. The kids are awarded points for good behavior - raising their hand, saying please, not talking out of turn - and use the currency to buy computer time, pencils or notebooks.\n\n“It’s almost a 180-degree change from what (schools) these kids came from,” says Principal Heveron, who began his teaching career in Los Angeles’ Watts neighborhood in the 1960s. “We don’t fault the public schools, because we know the pressure they are under with large class sizes. What we are doing is showing these parents and kids we are committed, that we are in this for the long haul.”\n\nThe commitment is evident in kids like Francisco. When he first came to class, he could barely speak English, could not read or write Spanish or English and could not distinguish letters. Half the time he fell asleep in class. The teachers weren’t even sure he attended school because his school records never materialized.\n\nFrancisco was tutored privately - an impossible luxury in public school. While the other kids took tests on geography, Francisco, who didn’t know the difference between a city and a state, received private lessons. Today, he speaks English, reads simple books and looks his teachers in the eye when he speaks.\n\n“He has come so far,” says Pavey, who can’t help but worry about the kids when they leave for their homes each night. “I hope we teach them there is more than violence, drugs and gangs, and that they are capable of going on to college. But in the community they grow up in, college isn’t something parents push the kids into.”\n\nSome educators are critical of programs like AmeriCorps or Teach for America, saying that sending inexperienced teachers to tough areas is a recipe for failure, because they are not prepared to deal with the issues of inner-city life.\n\nLiegel counters by saying her classes at USD have filled in any gaps in her teaching methods, and that Heveron and her professors help with the day-to-day problems she faces. She and the other teachers say what they learn in USD classes at night is applicable the next day.\n\nMost important, Liegel says she has learned more about herself from kids like Francisco than she thinks she could ever teach them. “There are times when the kids are driving you crazy and you think, why are they acting like this?” she says. “Then you remember that their father is gone or their brother is in prison. And you are amazed they can even get up and go to school on a regular basis.”\n\nOne aspect of the Nativity Prep model that especially appeals to Rivera and his supporters is that the school is an integral part of church and neighborhood. Rivera and the teachers live in Logan Heights, shop at its stores, worship in its churches. The Mission Valley YMCA provides free swimming lessons and summer camps, and county health workers give medical screenings at Nativity Prep.\n\n“No school is just a school, not in the inner-city,” says Heveron, who watched as several Catholic elementary schools left the inner-city for the suburbs in recent years (Nativity Prep receives no financial assistance from the Catholic diocese but does get support from individual parishes). He came out of retirement to run Nativity Prep in part because of Rivera’s relentless enthusiasm, but primarily because he believes in its educational philosophy.\n\n“I inherited 10 enthusiastic teacher volunteers and a warehouse with next to nothing in it,” he says. “Together, and with all the other help we’ve received, we’ve made this school happen. We did it by holding on to the vision David created.”\n\nRivera wasn’t always such a visionary. For much of his young life, he slid along on his incredible charm, his athletic ability and his good looks. The third of four boys growing up in the Skyline area, he tagged along with his parents, vibrant leaders in San Diego’s Hispanic community who knew political and church leaders on a first-name basis. His father co-founded several nonprofits and helped immigrants find jobs; his mother had a 35-year career as a social worker for the county.\n\nRivera stayed up late as his dad cooked carne asada for friends. He got used to the bishop dropping by the house after Mass. He loved the social whirl that surrounded his parents, but cared little for the issues. Rather, he dreamed of being a pro athlete and spent his free time playing basketball, baseball and football at Helix High School. Rivera was the kid who showed up early and stayed late for practice. Because of his small size, he often played hurt.\n\nHe bounced around between a half dozen community colleges on various athletic scholarships, playing football and baseball. But Rivera’s dream ended when his ankle shattered during a botched play. He left school with a 1.47 GPA and four metal screws in his leg.\n\n“I quit school, came back to San Diego and got a real estate license,” he says. “I wanted to make a lot of money and I didn’t want to work too hard.”\n\nHe researched the market and discovered that the west Lemon Grove area of the city had few real estate agents. In his first year of selling, he made $1,200. By year three, his commissions totaled in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. By then he had the hot car, the great house, the big-screen TV the all-night parties. Bur one moment changed his life - when God mapped outr, with absolute clarity, his life’s mission.\n\n“I’ve tried to describe that night before and I never can get it right,” says Rivera of Oct. 16, 1993, the date of what he calls his religious conversion. He falls silent for a few moments before he begins. ” It late at night and I was wide awake, looking out the window and the lights below Mount Helix, just reflecting. I had been all about athletics and wealth up until then and I just wasn’t satisfied. I was just really disgusted with my life.\n\n“And then,” he says, “I was overcome with thoughts that I knew weren’t coming from myself.”\n\nThose thoughts included a blueprint for his future: Graduate from USD, attend Notre Dame Law School, return to San Diego and help its poor children by starring a non-profit venture. That night, Rivera quit his realty job by leaving a message on his boss’s answering machine. That weekend, he sold most of his possessions, put his house up for rent and gave his big screen TV to his stunned brother.\n\nBy Monday morning, he was sitting in a USD counselor’s office, asking what it would take for him to get accepted. “USD is the Catholic university in San Diego, and there were certain relationships I needed to develop there,” says Rivera, who hadn’t attended Mass in 11 years but later was a leader in University Ministry.\n\n“I was leaving a certain type or lifestyle and taking on a new one with God at its center. And USD is where I had to be to do it.”\n\nRivera took the slate of community college classes suggested by the counselor, got good grades and was accepted into USD. In 1996, he graduated with a 3.4 GPA in political science and philosophy. He then focused on getting into Notre Dame Law School - another step in the plan. Placed on the wait list, he campaigned for admission by writing a letter a week to the school’s dean. He even had a going away party for himself at his parents’ house, even though he had no guarantee he would get in.\n\n“Part of me thought David was nuts,” says Mike McIntyre, USD’s director of University Ministry, who ministered to Rivera while he was a student. “The other pan of me thought if anyone could make it happen, Dave could. He doesn’t take no for an answer, and I mean that in the best sense of the term.”\n\nRivera showed up on the first day of law school orientation and planted himself in the dean’s office. When the dean’s secretary - who opened the dean’s mail - asked Rivera his name, she came over and gave him a hug. “She went and got the dean, who came out after a few minutes and said I was in,” says Rivera. “I had no doubt. It was pan of the plan.”\n\nAs always, Rivera has more to his plan. He intends to enroll a new crop of fifth graders this fall, and provide sixth grade instruction to the current group of students. Most of his volunteer teachers are committed to a second year, and 65 college seniors already applied for the new teaching positions.\n\nBut Rivera dreams big. He sees the Nativity Prep model eventually expanding from kindergarten through high school, teaching thousands of students and including a residential component. To help make that a reality, this month he will join Nativity Prep adviser Brian Bennett in a proposal before the San Diego Unified School Board to open a K-5 charter school in Logan Heights that, like Nativity Prep, includes a 12.hour school day and volunteer teachers.\n\nWith charter school status comes a guaranteed stream of income to run the school, eliminating one of the major hurdles that Nativity Prep now faces. In exchange for the state money, however, the new school could not be designated Catholic, to preserve separation of church and state. Rivera doesn’t see that as an issue. Because the school day is longer than that required by the State, he says religion would be offered as an elective, afterschool activity. “It’s big,” he says of his plan. “We’re talking about thousands of kids in a college prep program in the lowest income areas of San Diego. It will go K-12. Absolutely.”\n\nPart of his plan relies on USD, which Rivera would like to help supply and train more teachers. Aware of the financial burden an expanded program could mean (USD currently covers about $180,000 in tuition costs for Nativity Prep teachers), and wanting to maintain autonomy between USD and Nativity Prep. Lazarus and Cordeiro are looking at ways to possibly expand USD’s assistance if the school grows.\n\nOne option may be to partner with a None Dame program that gives students interested in serving low-income areas a crash course in education before they are sent out to teach. Many of USD’s undergraduates join VISTA or the Peace Corps, and Lazarus sees this as a way for them to serve their local community (several USD seniors have applied to teach at Nativity Prep this fall). Alternative means of delivering the master’s curriculum to the teachers also may be considered.\n\nLazarus is cautious about the loss of independence that comes from a charter designation, as well as the Catholic identity issue. Yet he says the Nativity Prep model is so vital to inner-city kids that it must carry on. “Will USD continue to support David whenever it can, in organizational as well as personal resources? Yes,” says Lazarus, who first became familiar with Nativity Prep through a school in his former hometown of Milwaukee. “There comes a time and place where people have to decide where they stand on education, and you have to do what it takes to make it happen. This is that time.”\n\nIf the charter designation isn’t granted, Rivera says with all earnestness that he isn’t worried. He says the Nativity Prep concept will carry on, because it works and because there are enough talented people supporting it. As he has in the past, he says God will see to it that the children will be taught.\n\nIn an uncharacteristic moment of uncertainty, Rivera wonders aloud if he might not be the best person to lead the school. He admits he gets easily distracted by the little things—mousetraps and copier paper. He worries that he doesn’t know enough about education, that his expertise lies more in raising money, raising hope. His humbleness refuses to let him take credit for what he has created. “’I think if I went away someone would come in and pick up the slack and do a better job,” he says.\n\n“’This isn’t thriving because of me, it’s thriving despite me. The spirit is leading this and it has a life of its own. I’m just going with the flow of what the spirit wants me to do.”\n\nShow Less > | Go to Top\n\nLeap of Faith\n\nSan Diego Union-Tribune (January 20, 2002)\n\nBy Chris Moran\n\nSan Diego—Opportunity knocked on doors in Logan Heights and Stockton last summer, borne by a 22-year-old Midwesterner three months removed from life as a college student.\n\nThe white solicitor with the economics degree definitely wasn’t from the largely Latino neighborhood. But Lisa Martin made an alluring pitch, and in Spanish.\n\nShe asked people to send their children to a school with fewer than 20 students. Nativity Prep Academy would have at least two teachers in the classroom, and sometimes as-many as SLX, she promised. School would last 12 hours a day during the week and four hours on Saturday. The school would take care of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The curriculum would emphasize college preparation and Catholic values.\n\nAnd Martin mentioned something that translates well in any language—this would all be free, gratis.\n\nMartin was there because she had responded to a sales pitch herself to be a teacher at the school.\n\nIt came from David Rivera, an upstart University of San Diego graduate whose vision. was an ideal school for underprivileged children led him to trade in a four-bedroom hilltop house and the streaky money of real estate for a trailer without plumbing and the austerity of a pioneer.\n\nRivera is the 34-year-old son of Chicano activists from San Diego. His parents’ generation participated in movements for fair housing, equal employment opportunity and an end to discrimination. Rivera has gone the more solitary entrepreneurial route in the most high profile civil rights cause of recent years - the education of the urban poor and minorities.\n\nHe needed college-educated people to teach on Market Street, east of downtown San Diego, for $35 a week. In return for a two-year commitment, he pledged to give them a free place to live and cover their tuition and expenses for a teaching credential or master’s degree program.\n\nHe got 49 applicants. Ten showed up for this uncertain venture, but there was no school, no teacher’s home and Rivera had not yet lined up USD to train the teachers.\n\nWhen asked how she knew everything would work out. teacher Caroline Sekula said, “I didn’t really. I just took a plunge. All of us, I think, just took a tremendous leap of faith in coming out here.”\n\nOf course no one could teach until they had students. To find them, Rivera dispatched teachers to canvass the neighborhood, speak at churches and meet community leaders.\n\nThey braced for an open-house night to await the results of their door-to-door and pew-to-pew recruiting. They were nervous. Would anyone show?\n\nThe panic melted away as families showed up.\n\nMargarita Vera, one of Martin’s recruits, was sold when she entered the warehouse on Market Street that would be the school’s home.\n\n“They already knew the names of my child and myself,” Vera said.\n\nVera had been concerned about the social environment at her son’s public school, the fights, the lack of civility. Her son was introverted, she said. She could see academic ramifications for Jose, who had to compete with 30 other kids for a teacher’s attention.\n\nBut Vera didn’t feel she had a choice. She didn’t work, and her family couldn’t afford Catholic school on the salary her husband received painting trucks. Then she got the house call from Martin.\n\nRosa Herrera had been waiting for two years to get her son bused out of Logan Heights when she heard about Nativity Prep.\n\nIt wasn’t Logan Elementary School that concerned her. It was the after-school latch-key hours. She lives on a block where boys loiter, drink, smoke and sometimes do worse. She knows because her older son was one of those boys until he went to jail. She thought a 12-hour day would be just the thing to keep Adrian, 10, out of trouble.\n\nStill, the choice came with risks. None of Nativity Prep’s teaching corps had taught before, and none had even majored in education.\n\nHowever well-intentioned, programs that thrust rookies into schools in poor neighborhoods have been criticized because students in these schools need the very best instruction if education is to prove an economic equalizer. Instead. poor children are most likely to attend schools staffed by the least experienced teachers.\n\nKati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a reform group that advocates for better schooling for low-income for black and Latino students, said not just any college grad can do what a teacher does. But if volunteer teachers are cream-of-the-crop college grads, she said, they may do as well or even better than first-year teachers with traditional training.\n\nBrian Bennett, a veteran Catholic school principal and an advisor to Nativity Prep, said the low student-teacher ratio at the new school and the training from USD could offset inexperience.\n\nIn the end, though, he said parents were being asked to experiment with their children’s education. “These parents look a huge leap of faith,” Bennett said.\n\nOn the morning of August 20, escrow closed on a $205,000 house at South 31st Street and Martin Avenue. A house that only hours earlier had been the scene of a drug bust, was the new home of the teachers for Nativity Prep Academy.\n\nRivera, the founder who had raised more than $300,000 to launch the school, moved into an 8 by 20-foot trailer in back of the house. It’s his office and his bedroom, separated by a shower curtain. He leased property for the new school at 3275 Market Street, and he sealed the teacher-training deal with USD. Amid the challenges of serving 17 students this year, Rivera looks ahead to serving thousands. He sees the current crop of fifth-graders as the leading edge of expansion until they graduate as the class of 2009.\n\nFurthering his commitment, Rivera will play a role in Bennett’s plan to open a 232-student charter school in Logan Heights in September. Bennett will seek San Diego city schools’ approval early next month. It would be Nativity Prep without the religion.\n\nThis is a calling. You don’t live in a trailer unless you feel you have a calling or a passion for a cause,” Rivera said, “and that calling is definitely religiously driven. My faith is why I’m here. My faith is why I work so many hours. Seven days a week, with no days off.”\n\nThe calling began October 16, 1993, a weekend night like many for Rivera, a 20-something college dropout who was making heady money in San Diego’s real estate market.\n\nFriday night partying had ended early Saturday, and Rivera was alone in his big house. Maybe his activist pedigree compelled some altruism. Maybe the solitude triggered an existential reckoning. There was a void, and what rushed in to fill it was what Rivera calls a religious conversion. It came with instructions: Get a degree from USD, go to Notre Dame Law School, and lead a nonprofit organization to help at-risk children.\n\nAt 2 a.m. he called his boss and left a message that he was never coming back to work. Then he beefed up his transcript and grade point average at several community colleges, got accepted at USD and earned his degree. In 1996, he applied to Notre Dame Law School.\n\nWhen he was put on the waiting list, he campaigned for admission with weekly phone calls inquiring about his status and a series of biographical chapters to supplement the information in his application. Finally, he just packed up, left San Diego and crashed orientation.\n\nThen-Dean, David Link, had been examining Rivera’s epistles. When there was a no-show or two among the newly arrived law students, Link went to his waiting-list files and pulled Rivera’s dossier. In such cases, he said, it was his custom to call admissions and ask, “Do you think this person is still available?” The admissions counselor’s reply: “We’re sure he’s available, because he’s sitting outside your office.”\n\nLaw degree in hand, Rivera became a squatter in the principal’s office at University of San Diego High School. Rivera got a desk where he could research how to start a school and tap into Principal Dick Kelly’s contacts.\n\nOne was Bennett, a fellow law school graduate, and so began the partnership of two educators trapped in lawyers’ bodies.\n\nBennett saw Rivera’s proposal as a start-up with spirituality, a nonprofit in the service of literacy. Together they researched where they could do the most good, and the numbers pointed to an area in Logan Heights around Market Street that is 89 percent poor and 68 percent Latino. Average annual income for the families of Nativity Prep is $18,000.\n\nTo make the case for the need for Nativity Prep, they documented what they consider the educational neglect of a neighborhood. For example, they concluded that the abysmal test scores at a dozen public schools in the area meant parents have poor choices provided by the government.\n\nSaid Nativity Prep Principal Bob Heveron, who has 20 plus years experience in local Catholic schools, “That does bother me as an educator who’s worked most of his life in center cities.”\n\nNativity Prep Academy borrows from a model started by Jesuits 30 years ago in New York City. Nativity schools specialize in students who are behind academically and from poor families. Rivera said Nativity targeted fifth-graders because he perceives it as the point at which students start selecting “good” or “bad” peer groups. The original Nativity schools took a four R’s approach reading, ’riting, ’rithmetic and religion - in sending 82 percent of its students to college.\n\nThe rich have always had their choice of schools. They buy homes new the best public schools or pay tuition at the best private ones.\n\nNativity’s business plan says inadequate schooling is both the cause and effect of poverty. Its goal is to break the cycle of poverty through academics and character building.\n\n“How do people overcome adversity?” Rivera asked. “Through education and faith.”\n\nRivera still receives an occasional jolt that raises anew the question of survival. Last month he carried his $91 weekly paycheck to the bank, and the teller told him the school’s account had insufficient funds. He said the $40,000 he raised later in the month should carry me school through the end of this month. After that is a question.\n\nThe stock market plunge exacerbated by September 11th caused a major donor to renege on a six-figure pledge. He said Nativity will need to come up with $120,000 to finish the school year.\n\nFive months into it, the teachers now talk about the comfort of routine, one that involves 60 hours a week in classes as teacher or student or even as they cook preparing dinner for the students. Some split their volunteer teaching time between Nativity and other schools in the area - Logan Elementary, St. Jude’s Academy and a science education group called Aquatic Adventures. They knew it would be a lot of work, but they came from Notre Dame, Boston College and Colgate, schools that emphasize service.\n\nAfter their workday, the teachers carpool to classes at USD, where they’d be paying thousands of dollars a semester for books and tuition were it not for their affiliation with Nativity. They say they apply their lessons learned in lectures the very next day.\n\nExcept for the length of the day and the religion, the academic schedule at Nativity Prep looks similar to that of other schools. After breakfast and a quick prayer meeting, there’s a two-hour language arts block. Then there’s two hours of math and after lunch. there’s a half hour of religion, and depending on the day, science, social studies, Spanish, theater or physical education.\n\nNativity’s leaders based the curriculum on state standards and private and charter-school successes. They chose books from state-approved publishers. Since about 60 percent of the students live In Spanish-speaking homes, the reading program is geared toward language acquisition.\n\nWhat the kids and parents seem to like best about Nativity is its size and personal attention. Andres Navarette, 10, who went to school in National City last year, said at his new school, “the teachers are younger, and we get to do stuff like plays.” Every student was involved in the holiday pageant put on last month for parents.\n\nTeachers are able to have one-on-one discussions after instances of mischief. They also have a yellow tally sheet for each student, on which they quantify conduct. With the accumulation of points come rewards. Brandishing the sheet with a threat to subtract from the total generally gets students to behave.\n\nNativity has started with the support of experienced educators. USD High Principal Kelly’ is on the board of directors. Its advisory board includes Frank Lazarus, vice president and provost of USD; Paula Cordeiro, dean of USD’s School of Education; and Jose Cruz, associate director of the San Diego Literacy Council.\n\nBennett said Nativity will succeed if parents stay happy and the school can keep committed teachers in one of San Diego’s poorest neighborhoods. “We just want to prove that it works,” Bennett said.\n\nThere’s not much evidence of academic success. Heveron said the students have shown consistent growth on the tests supplied with the reading program, but since they started nearly two years behind their grade level, on average, there’s a big deficit to close, “We’re dealing with young minds and this doesn’t happen overnight,” Heveron said. “We see steps, not leaps.”\n\nShow Less > | Go to Top\n\nCreating Hope and Opportunity\n\nNotre Dame Lawyer (July 2002)\n\nBy David Rivera ’99 J.D., with Katie Evans ’98\n\nMany students attend Notre Dame Law School intending to receive an education that will enable them to effect some positive change in society. Four years ago, when I chose to attend NDLS, I was no different in my desire to make a difference. But although I had set my heart on creating some sort of a nonprofit organization that would improve the quality of life for at-risk children, I didn’t have a clear vision of what, exactly, would make the greatest impact. So, like all lawyers confronted with a new problem, I set out to research the issue. As the facts unfolded before me, it became increasingly evident that education had the greatest potential to create a sense of hope as well as tangible opportunities for children living in poverty.\n\nMy hometown of San Diego, California, is often referenced to as ’’America’s Finest City.” Reasons for this designation abound, but climate and opportunity top most of the lists that rate such things. When it comes to climate, I can’t quarrel with those who place San Diego near the top of their lists. But when it comes to opportunity - particularly, economic opportunity - the rankings don’t tell the entire story.”\n\nSince 1980, San Diego County has grown much faster in economic terms than both the state of California and most of the rest of the nation, with the economy doubling over the last two decades. Despite a strong population surge during that time, San Diego’s per capita economic indicators rose by 32 percent. Our economy and workforce have both prospered remarkably - on average.\n\nA recent and more thorough analysis of San Diego’s economy suggests that fewer and fewer individuals benefit from the community’s overall prosperity. During the same period that saw impressive growth, the county also experienced a dramatic increase in income inequality and in the number of people living in poverty. The middle class has declined from 80 percent of the population to 60 percent, and the income gap between the wealthiest and poorest individuals has grown by 30 percent. Today, over 900,000 people in San Diego County - 32 percent of the population - live in poverty.\n\nEven more tragic are the statistics regarding our children. The number of children living in poverty is growing three times faster than both the national average of all persons living in poverty and the average of senior citizens living in poverty. In one generation that number has increased from 16 to 29 percent of the children in the county - a staggering 300,000 children are living in poverty.\n\nOf particular significance is the plight of abused and neglected children. Children in extreme poverty are 18 times more likely to be sexually abused and 25 times more likely to live in otherwise endangering circumstances. San Diego County receives 6,000 child-abuse calls each month, removes 20 children each day from their homes and supports 7,000 children in foster care. But children brought under the protection of the state don’t fare much better. Most foster children drift through seven to 11 homes - and sometimes staying in as many as 30 different homes before leaving the system at age 18. Fully half of San Diego’s foster children do not graduate high school - a rate almost 25 percent higher than for foster children nationwide - and will become homeless by the age of 20.\n\nChildren in extreme poverty are also 56 times more likely to be educationally neglected, and the condition of California’s education system exacerbates an already serious problem. Despite recent reforms, California remains last or next-to-last among the states in students per teacher, per principal, per counselor and per librarian. The state spends 20 percent less per pupil than the national average. Local newspapers provide a nearly constant stream of anecdotes about angry parents, low teacher morale, under-performing schools and apathetic legislative responses to these serious problems.\n\nBut these statistics and news stories tell only part of the story. As compelling - even daunting - as these facts are, it is difficult to fully comprehend the depth of the problems facing San Diego’s youth. My spirit nearly breaks when I think about the overwhelming burdens our broken systems force our children to shoulder.\n\nFaced with the results of all of my research, but bolstered by my conviction to do something to solve this overwhelming problem, I began searching for answers. An article in PARADE magazine last summer sparked my interest in a unique educational system that simultaneously addresses the material, educational, spiritual and health needs of disadvantaged children.\n\nThe article described an educational model consisting of extended school days and Saturday school, small classes of seven to 12 students, daily tutoring and long term mentoring programs. Beyond tending to the academic needs of its students, this model also incorporates other services into a comprehensive program designed to alleviate the difficulties inherent in an underfunded, often inaccessible and fragmented social-services system. After reading that article, I committed myself to opening just such a school, Nativity Prep Academy of San Diego, because I believe that it addresses the causes, rather than just the effects, of childhood poverty.\n\nNativity schools trace their roots to Jesuits who counseled poor Puerto Rican youths in New York in the 1950s, believing that early intervention and prevention could save disadvantaged children from the siren calls of poverty, drugs and death that abounded on the streets around their impoverished homes. The Jesuits believed that, by challenging and encouraging young people to reach their full potential, they could counter the overwhelming pressures to become involved in a destructive “street” culture.\n\nThe Jesuits opened their first formal Nativity school in 1971. Using both remedial and enrichment programs, as well as featuring a small student-faculty ratio, the school provides its elementary-school-aged students with highly focused educational opportunities. Over the last few years, 90 percent of Nativity’s students have gone to college. Thirty more schools have opened across the country using Nativity’s model.\n\nImagine! A place where a disadvantaged child can be nurtured, loved and given the opportunities and tools to turn dreams into reality. A place where a poor child can feel safe. A place where a neglected child is encouraged to be creative, where that child’s faith can grow and flourish. Most of us experienced this in our own homes. Most of us take for granted that we have the ability to provide this type of environment for our own children. For many children in my community, however, such experiences have been the stuff of imaginations rather than real experiences - until now.\n\nWhen Nativity Prep Academy of San Diego opens in the fall of 2001, we will employ the core elements of the proven Jesuit model and will focus on providing hope and opportunity co children in crises. Bur we’ve also expanded on the early Jesuit model to some extent, having added a high school component, to serve grades 5 through 12, and by providing onsite nutrition and health services, as well as some residential care.\n\nNativity’s mission promotes the academic, moral and social growth of at risk students through the rigors of an intensive curriculum, heightened expectations and a highly structured environment. When they graduate, I am confident that our students will have the resources and confidence to compete successfully at all levels.\n\nThe project has proceeded with amazing speed. Much like the grace of God, helping children proves to be irresistible for many people. Thanks to the assistance of community leaders and financial supporters, Nativity Prep Academy of San Diego is becoming a reality. Currently, dozens of volunteers - college interns, attorneys, doctors, urban school teachers - conduct research raise funds and help us develop valuable links to important community resources.\n\nEven with these early successes, many people ask me why I would devote my life to this cause. My friends call me a “tragic optimist” --\"optimist” because I know, despite the scope of this project, that Nativity Prep will succeed, but “tragic” because of the breadth of the problem I’m trying to solve and because of the vast amounts of resources required to succeed. I can respond only by saying that r have found my passion in helping those in need. And when I reflect on my life, I realize that this passion has grown from a seed planted by my parents a (long time ago and has been more fully formed by experiences I have had along the way.\n\nBoth in their careers and in their social lives, my parents advocated for San Diego’s poor and disenfranchised. My earliest memories are of attending community organizing meetings, fundraising events, rallies and numerous other athletic, church and political activities. Through their words and their works, my parents taught me the value of service.\n\nMy return to the nonprofit service world came, however, after a slow process of realization and self-discovery. Through trial and error, I sought fulfillment in many different activities. Intercollegiate athletics and a six figure corporate income as a real estate broker did not provide me with the inner satisfaction that I thought they would, although both greatly shaped my character and work ethic. A few years submerged in the subculture of drugs and alcohol, understandably, resulted in even greater inner conflict, strife and confusion. Only through embracing my faith in Christ did I find the inner peace I so desperately sought.\n\nCertainly, many individuals embark on a path to service without similar experiences. But I feel blessed finally to have reached a stage where a meaningful relationship with Christ has replaced emptiness and disconnectedness. I now understand that the lack or presence of popularity or possessions did not prevent me from truly living. Rather when I followed my heart’s passion, I began to experience a more fulfilling life.\n\nI also learned that I needed more education to learn how to help give others the same wonderful opportunities my parents had given me. So I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of San Diego and then chose to attend Notre Dame Law School.\n\nMy law school education gave me the practical knowledge I needed to succeed in my endeavor - particularly, a core body of information required to address the vast array of legal and business issues I faced daily. A Notre Dame law degree also adds a special legitimacy in the eyes and minds of potential benefactors and collaborators. And through friendships formed at Notre Dame with classmates, faculty and alumni, I have had tremendous opportunities to develop, discuss and refine this vision.\n\nEven University President Emeritus Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh, CSC, has supported our effort. “I was delighted to learn that you are establishing a series of schools for at-risk children… I think it is wonderful… This endeavor is badly needed if we are ever to alleviate the cycle of crime, drugs, and poverty that plague our inner cities. Keep up the good work and be sure of a daily prayer from here for all success.”\n\nI have truly been blessed. My family, my friends and my Notre Dame family have been tremendously supportive of me and of this effort. I cannot imagine a greater manifestation of God’s plan for me, of complementing his ways with my talents and life experiences. God has blessed me with the gift of hope and with a wonderful opportunity to work toward making my dream a reality), And as I work toward fulfilling this dream, some of San Diego’s most impoverished children may find hope and opportunity in their lives as well.\n\nShow Less > | Go to Top"
