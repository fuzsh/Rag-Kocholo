His goal in ministry is to help those who work to uncover the relevance of spirituality in general, and following Jesus in particular, as relevant in a world which should and will constantly be changing.\n\nJohn likes cooking, gaming, nature, reading, languages, and history. He speaks French and Spanish and has some working knowledge of Latin, Biblical Greek and Hebrew, German and Italian.\n\nHis cat, Edward, does not share many of John’s interests, but does enjoy naps, sitting in the windowsill, and wet food. He loves Sundays as the day he receives the “good stuff”. He is adept at chasing string, and he won the Cutest Cat in North Georgia title in the 2022 Rotary Cutest Pet contest.
