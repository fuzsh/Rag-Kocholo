        "text": "Welcome to the Diocese of Syracuse home page in partnership with Franciscan University’s Catechetical Institute!\n\nIf you would like to find resources for personal enrichment, want to learn more about what the Catholic Church teaches, or as part of preparation or ongoing formation in a particular area of ministry, these online workshops will be especially helpful.\n\nTo set up your individual \"free\" account, click on the middle blue box on the right below, labeled \"My Parish or School is already registered...\" (Note: All the parishes, Catholic schools and some diocesan offices are already registered.) Follow the instructions to register as an individual user. Once you create an account, you will be able to select from a dropdown menu: your parish, school, or one of the registered diocesan offices.\n\nTake time to explore the topics and workshops available to you on your dashboard. There are several you can choose from, based on your role in your family, parish, Catholic school, or area of ministry.\n\nNot sure where to start? Go to Institution Tracks under the Start Learning section, and select “Getting Started - Foundational Workshops”. These are a few workshops recommended by our diocesan Collaborative Leadership Group as a good place to begin. (They recommend that you start with “Praying with Scripture: Lectio Divina,” followed by the other 3 workshops in no specific order.)\n\nIf you have questions, please contact me directly by phone or email.\n\nSister Laura Bufano, CSJ\n\nOffice of Pastoral Leadership\n\n[email protected]\n\n315-459-7158"
