        "text": "The following is the annual letter that I sent to family and friends for Christmas 2018, recounting the blessings of the past year.\n\nChristmas/Pasko 2018\n\nNew Year/Bagong Taon 2019\n\nThe peace of the Christ-Child be with you always!\n\nAfter a year and a day in the novitiate, I professed my temporary vows as a Benedictine monk of Saint Meinrad Archabbey last August 6 during the celebration of Vespers for the Feast of the Transfiguration. Before God and the relics of His saints, and in the presence of Archabbot Kurt Stasiak, OSB, and the monks assembled there in choir, I promised for three years stability in this community, fidelity to the monastic way of life, and obedience, according to the holy Rule of our holy father, Saint Benedict. I read the hand-written charter of my vows from the ambo and, for the first time, said aloud my new name in religion: Mateo.\n\nThe custom of most monasteries, including our own, is that no two monks share the same name. Since we already have a Fr. Noël (Mueller), OSB, here, I knew that I had to change mine. I presented three choices to the Abbot—Mateo (after Matthew the apostle and evangelist), Quentin (after the martyr of Amiens), and Pio (after Pope Pius V)—and he graciously picked my first choice. This new name is yet another reminder that I have entered a new and different life: the old Noel is no more; I am now Mateo. It takes time to go by a new name, just as it takes time to be that new man in Christ. But, every time I introduce myself, I recall my vocation to prefer nothing—not even everything that I had before—to the love of Christ.\n\nMy novitiate though was not without sorrow. I lost three of my uncles during that time: Bapang Siu (Deogracias S. Zamora), my Dad’s eldest brother and the patriarch of the Zamoras of Salapuñgan; Uncle Frank (Francisco C. Lim), my Aunt Cel’s husband; and Uncle Ron (Ronald W. Bennett), my Aunt Lyna’s husband. In February, my Dad underwent an emergency craniotomy to remove an acute subdural hematoma. I had to forego burying my uncles and attending to my father on his sickbed, because, as a novice, I was not allowed to spend a night outside the cloister. I had known that this was part of the deal even before I had entered the monastery. It was a price that I was willing and ready to pay. I just did not expect that it would have been demanded from me so soon.\n\nThat year as a novice, I found myself making Job’s prayer my own: “The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord!” (Job 1:21).\n\nBy God’s grace, two weeks prior to my profession, my Dad was cleared by his neurologist to fly from sunny California to southern Indiana. He and my Mom were among the 35 guests who traveled to witness my vows. My aunts Lyna Bennett and Lita Natac, and cousins Lorenzo and Theresa Natac also flew in from California. My sister Ivy and her family drove down from New Jersey. My cousins Elda and David Jamora drove up from Tennessee. Some of my closest friends from the Filipino community in Kentucky as well as parishioners and brother-priests from the Diocese of Lexington also came in for the celebration.\n\nAfter my profession, I received permission to spend some time with my family while they were here in the Midwest. I took them to visit Runnymede, the famed horse farm of Fr. Chris Clay’s family in Paris, Kentucky. I also introduced them to Kits and Tess Rivera who feted us with a Filipino feast in their lovely home in Lexington. But, most of all, we got to tour the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, the one Kentucky destination that my late Uncle Ron had hoped and had planned to visit before his untimely death.\n\nSorrow often follows sorrow in this vale of tears. But, “the mercies of God are not spent” (Lam. 3:22) and His consolations come in manners and moments that are often unexpected.\n\nAs a junior monk, I continue my work as the Archabbey Stipendiarius. I receive, acknowledge, record, and schedule requests for Mass intentions to the monastery. I have also been welcoming vocation guests in the monastery as the juniorate guest master. I have also been assigned as the valet to our Fr. Bonaventure Knaebel, OSB, who, aside from having served as the fifth abbot (and second archabbot) from 1955 to 1966, is also the senior monk in the Swiss-American Congregation by age (100 years), profession (80 years), and ordination (75 years). I read him his mail, write his letters, and do other small chores for him.\n\nFr. Abbot Kurt, OSB, has given me permission to continue my work as a Defender of the Bond for the Tribunal of the Diocese of Lexington, writing animadversiones (canonical briefs) on annulment cases. He has also allowed me to teach a practicum class for Advanced Homiletics here at our seminary this past fall semester. I will teach another practicum class here for the spring semester, this time for Introduction to Homiletics. He has also sent me out to preach on behalf of our monastery and the seminary and I have promoted our mission at parishes in the Archdiocese of Indianapolis and in the Dioceses of Evansville and Owensboro.\n\nI continue to be heavily involved with our Benedictines Oblates (the faithful who are affiliated with the archabbey and have promised to live by the Rule of Saint Benedict in their daily lives). I have been able to present my reflections on the Rule to the various chapters of our oblates in Indiana (Bloomington, Evansville, Indianapolis, Jasper, Muncie, St. Meinrad, Tell City), Kentucky (Louisville), and Ohio (Cincinnati and Dayton). I was thrilled to direct my first ever retreat to our oblates in New York this past Labor Day weekend. It went so well that they have invited me to return for their next retreat in the summer!\n\nThat retreat in New York also allowed me to visit family and friends out east. On the way to New York, I was able to visit my former bishop, Bishop Ronald Gainer in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and I was able to see his mother, Mrs. Anna Krolick, and give her my blessing a week before she died. Before the retreat, I got to stay with my friend from college, Marni (Aguas) Alvarez, in her home in Rye, New York, and we got to watch together the musical Mean Girls at the August Wilson Theater. She also got me a ticket to see Hamilton on Broadway! After the retreat, I spent several days with my sister Ivy and her family in East Windsor, New Jersey, before I drove to see Fr. Matt Buening at the Newman Center at Towson University in Maryland.\n\nGod and chapter willing, in three years, I hope to profess my solemn vows as a Benedictine monk on the Solemnity of the Assumption of our Lady on August 15, 2021. I would then be excardinated (canonical term for a complete transfer) as a priest of the Diocese of Lexington and would be bound permanently to those vows and to this monastery until death.\n\nPlease include me in your prayers that I may continue to persevere in my monastic vows. Know that you are always in my mind and heart every time the bells beckon me to go to the Archabbey Church and pray. I pray that all of us may learn to prefer nothing to the love of Christ and may He bring us all to everlasting life!\n\nPublished on January 21-22, 2017 in the Parish Bulletin of Jesus Our Savior Catholic Church, Morehead KY\n\nOn Easter Monday, April 17, 2017, I will be stepping down as Pastor of Jesus Our Savior Catholic Church here in Morehead and its Newman Center at Morehead State University, Saint Julie Catholic Church in Owingsville, and our Frenchburg mission in Menifee County. After a long period of prayer and discernment and with the Bishop’s permission and blessing, I have begun the process of applying to enter the monastery at Saint Meinrad Archabbey in southern Indiana to be a monk.\n\nI have asked Deacon Dan Connell, the present chair of our Parish Council, to head a task force that will hold meetings for our parish and to prepare from this consultation a summary of our parish’s present needs and strengths as well as what you hope to have in your next pastor. Deacon Bill Grimes will do the same for Saint Julie in Owingsville. These summaries, along with the statistical and financial reports that are already available through the Diocesan Chancery, will then be forwarded to all the priests in the Catholic Diocese of Lexington to give them the opportunity to apply to be the next pastor or to nominate a priest whom they believe would be the best fit for the parish. The Bishop will then review these nominations with the Priest Personnel Board before assigning your new pastor.\n\nIt is through these parish meetings that you will be able to give your input on what sort of leadership that our parish needs as we move forward. The Parish Report that will be prepared from these meetings is due by February 21 to the Vicar for Priests.\n\nTo assist with the transition, we will have Fr. Arturo Molina living with me at the Montgomery House starting Ash Wednesday, March 1. Fr. Art is a priest of the diocese who had been away working as a chaplain for the Federal Bureau of Prisons until his retirement last year. This arrangement will help him ease back into parish work and it will also address the needs of Hispanic ministry here in northeastern Kentucky. After I step down as Pastor, he will take over as Parish Administrator pro tempore on April 17. The Diocese will cover his salary and benefits until then, at which point the parish will be responsible. The Bishop hopes to announce the appointment of the next pastor before May 15. The new pastor will then begin his ministry here on July 1.\n\nMy appointment here as your pastor came as a surprise. It was not something that I sought; it was something that I was asked to do. Nevertheless, it has been a time filled with grace and it has pushed me to minister in ways that I never thought that I was capable, such as, for example, cheering and praying for a football team. But, the call to the monastery has been something that has stayed with me longer than I have been ordained and both my family and my life are finally in a place in which I am able to pursue it. I ask then that you pray for me during my period of transition as I will pray for you in yours.\n\nAll that We Have: The New Crucifix in the Sanctuary of Saint Julie Catholic Church\n\nPublished on December 17-18, 2016 in the Parish Bulletin of Jesus Our Savior Catholic Church, Morehead KY\n\nOn this Fourth Sunday of Advent, I will bless the new crucifix that will soon grace the dark blue wall of the sanctuary of Saint Julie Catholic Church in Owingsville, Kentucky, during the 8:00 AM Mass there. This crucifix will be dedicated in memory of Jeffery Lee Porter, a former parishioner of Jesus Our Savior Catholic Church in Morehead, Kentucky, two days after what would have been his 49th birthday. A small plaque, which is an inch tall and three inches wide, is found at the back of its base and bears this inscription: “In memory of Jeffery Lee Porter, Dec. 16, 1967-Aug. 2, 2015.”\n\nThis new cross was built by Jeff’s father, Roger Porter (born 1945), who used a dark cherry wood that is 3/4 of an inch thick. It is a large Latin cross that is 46 inches tall with a horizontal arm that spans 29 ½ inches. It has an open space cutout of another Latin cross in its middle, evoking the design of an earlier cross that had been used in that sanctuary.\n\nFixed on this Latin cross is the 21 inch tall figure of the Crucified Christ that was hand-carved from batikuling (Elaeocarpus calomala), a wood native to the Philippines, and hand-painted by the now defunct studio of Romeo D. Lao in my hometown of Angeles City. The sculptors who had fashioned it hail from Betis in Guagua, a locale in my native province of Pampanga that is famous for its woodcraft. They are known for their attention to detail, as evidenced in the soft eyelashes and the painted glass eyes of this image.\n\nThe corpus, especially its arched back, evokes Cimabue’s (c. 1240-1302) iconic crucifix for the Basilica di Santa Croce in Florence, Italy. It features the Christus patiens, the Suffering Christ who bore the burden and shared the pain of humanity. A white veil-like loincloth is the sole garment that covers His naked body. A gilded metal crown of thorns rests on His head, but three golden rays, called the tres potencias (three powers), also adorn it, recalling the tria munera of Christ: His three-fold office as Priest, Prophet, and King. Above His head is a titulus that is 3 ½ inches tall and 6 ½ inches wide, bearing the Latin letters ‘INRI,’ the acronym for the inscription: Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum (cf. Jn. 19:20).\n\nThis image was a birthday gift to me several years ago from my parents, Jose Manuel and Amelita Zamora, who had commissioned it originally for the sanctuary of Saint Andrew Catholic Church in Harrodsburg. But, the sculptor had misunderstood the instructions: he was asked to fashion a corpus no bigger than the measurements given; instead, he made one much bigger than the intended size. This has turned out to be a happy mistake, now that this piece has finally found a home at Saint Julie’s.\n\nThis new crucifix will be raised in the sanctuary of Saint Julie’s as a sign of our faith, but also as an invitation to recall the Lord’s sacrifice on the cross, the same sacrifice that we remember at the altar at every Mass. I hope that it will also serve as a summons to lift in prayer to our Lord on the cross those who live with pain and suffering and those who have died, especially Jeff Porter, that they too may “reap the harvest of salvation planted in pain by Christ Jesus” (cf. Book of Blessings, no. 1250).\n\nPublished on November 19-20, 2016 in the Parish Bulletin of Jesus Our Savior Catholic Church, Morehead KY\n\nThis year, I have one more reason to give thanks to God: the extraordinary way in which our parish family has stepped up to give families in need in our local community a reason and the means to celebrate Thanksgiving.\n\nEvery year, eleven agencies in town compile a list of families in need and they ask local Churches to commit to a certain number of baskets for the Community Thanksgiving Basket drive. Jesus Our Savior Church usually provides 10-15 baskets for this annual appeal. (I am told that there was one year that we were able to provide 20 baskets.) This year, thanks to your generous giving, our Social Concerns Committee counted 28 baskets from our Church and there were enough additional miscellaneous items and donations that could have raised that number to 32 baskets!\n\nThis, of course, has been the shared effort of our whole parish. Many of our parishioners contributed items for the baskets while some families assembled full baskets for the drive. Our children in Religious Education provided the cans of green beans and corn for all the baskets. Our parish staff put together a basket, as did the college students of our Newman Center. I was edified to learn that Coach Rob Tenyer and the Morehead State University Eagles Football Team had brought in eight baskets to the Church!\n\nIn addition to these assembled baskets, we received donations from several households and from our Knights of Columbus Council No. 16206. Our Social Concerns Committee used some of that money to purchase individual items to fill up some of the baskets, but they have also asked the donors if they would consider redirecting their donations to the Senior Boxes for Rowan County Christmas. Last year, we were only able to raise $140 of the $400 that we needed to provide these boxes for senior citizens in need in our community. Thanks to the redirected donations, we have already raised $200, half of what we need for this worthy cause.\n\nEvery year, we celebrate Thanksgiving as a nation, knowing full well that we have received all that we have, all that we are, and all that we are able to give away from the hand of our God who never tires in giving us His bountiful blessings. The best thanksgiving, of course, is for us to emulate the Lord’s gesture of giving, to give from what has been given to us, something that our parish family has done so wonderfully for our neighbor this Thanksgiving Day.\n\nBut, the season of giving has only begun. This weekend, we will have the Angel Tree set up in the Church foyer for Rowan County Christmas. We will also have a box for donations for the Senior Boxes. I hope that we will continue to step up as a parish family and exceed once again not just our own expectations in giving but the needs of the needy in our county.\n\nThat in itself would be another reason, not just for me but for all of us, to give thanks to God.\n\nPublished on July 16-17, 2016 in the Parish Bulletin of Jesus Our Savior Catholic Church, Morehead KY\n\nMy first parish assignment as a newly ordained priest was Mary, Queen of the Holy Rosary Catholic Church in Lexington, the parish where I stayed at when I first arrived here in the United States. I found that assignment to be an extraordinary blessing. I had no trouble trying to get to know the parishioners by name; I already knew them and, in fact, many of them crowded my first Mass of Thanksgiving at the Church. I had worked with the parish staff before as a seminarian; their only adjustment was calling me by my new title. I already knew how to get around the parish, where to find files and supplies, and whom to call for help. I hit the ground running as soon as I reported for duty and the parish welcomed me, their long lost son, as their newest Father. Nevertheless, I would sometimes tease some of the parishioners, especially the Knights of Columbus there, that, if they had known that I was going to be their priest, they would have treated me a whole lot better when I was a seminarian.\n\nI had been warned that a new parish assignment often involved a stressful transition for both the priest and the parishioners. But, I found out that it was not so at Mary, Queen, because I already knew the parish and the parish also knew me.\n\nI think that this is one of the more compelling reasons why we assign our seminarians as parish interns for the summer and why we promote the upcoming Rock the Collar tour around the diocese: we let our seminarians experience firsthand the inner workings of the parish office and the daily routine of a priest, but we also allow them to meet and fall in love with the people of God whom they will serve one day. Hopefully, that experience will inspire them later on to request the Bishop to return to the parish and minister there.\n\nThis summer, our parish has had the pleasure of having Danny Taylor as our seminarian intern. On Thursday, August 4, eleven of his brother-seminarians will come and visit Jesus Our Savior Catholic Church as part of their Rock the Collar tour. I have asked Sr. M. Judine Lambert, SND to give them a tour of the Saint Claire Regional Medical Center, but I also hope to take them around Morehead and Rowan County. I will celebrate Mass for them at the Church at 6:00 PM and our Knights of Columbus will host a cookout afterwards to welcome them to Jesus Our Savior.\n\nI know that many of us already have summer vacations planned before the start of school, but I encourage those who will be in town that week to come to this Rock the Collar Mass and cookout. This is not only our opportunity to meet our future priests and, perhaps, even our future pastor; it is also their opportunity to meet us in our own backyard. I hope that their stop here, albeit brief, will be so meaningful and memorable that one—or more of them—will, even now, look forward to coming back to serve our parish.\n\nI want us to make a good first impression on these young men, as we already have with Danny Taylor and now Fr. Terrence De Silva. I believe that we can welcome them warmly to Morehead and treat them well even while they are still seminarians so that they will remember to treat us even better when, God willing, they will be assigned to our parish as our priests.\n\nAll that We Have: The New Vessels for the Holy Oils at Saint Julie Catholic Church\n\nPublished on March 19-20, 2016 in the Parish Bulletin of Jesus Our Savior Catholic Church, Morehead KY\n\nOn Holy Tuesday, March 22, 2016, during the 10:30 AM Chrism Mass at the Cathedral of Christ the King in Lexington, Kentucky, the Most Reverend John Stowe, OFM Conv. (born 1966), Bishop of Lexington (2015-), with all of the priests of our diocese concelebrating, will consecrate the Sacred Chrism and bless the Oil of the Sick and the Oil of the Catechumens that will be used in the celebration of the Sacraments this year. There will be representatives from each parish, mission, and Catholic hospital to receive these blessed oils, but everyone in our diocese is invited to attend and participate at this Mass.\n\nThe Oil of the Catechumens and the Sacred Chrism will be used to anoint those who will be received into the Catholic Church this Easter as well as those who will be baptized during the rest of the year. The Sacred Chrism will also be used for those who will be confirmed, those who will be ordained priests and bishops, and in the dedication of altars and Churches. The Oil of the Sick will be used in the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick.\n\nThe Chrism Mass is perhaps one of the most powerful and palpable signs of the oneness of our Holy Catholic Church. The oils blessed at this Mass bind those who are anointed in the Sacraments to our Bishop and to the rest of the faithful. The Bishop himself may not be able to celebrate every baptism in our diocese or visit every parishioner who is sick or is dying, but the holy oils that he will bless will make present to them his own blessing and prayers as well as the blessing of all of his priests and the prayers of the people of God. Thus, we not only share the common experience of the ritual of the Sacraments; we also are linked physically by the use of the same sanctified substance. There is then no private celebration of a Sacrament, because, even in the most isolated of hospital rooms, these holy oils still connect us to the communion of saints.\n\nThe holy oils that will be blessed at the Chrism Mass will be received at Saint Julie Catholic Church in Owingsville, Kentucky during the 6:00 PM Mass for Maundy Thursday of the Lord’s Supper. They will be placed in the crystal vessels that were given to the Church this Lenten season by Fr. Richard Watson (born 1961) and Saint Francis of Assisi Catholic Church in Pikeville, Kentucky. I blessed these vessels on March 18, 2016 during the 6:00 PM Vigil Mass for the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, the spouse of the Blessed Virgin Mary, at Saint Julie’s.\n\nThe vessels for the holy oils are often called ampullae and these particular ones had been used at Saint Francis in Pikeville until the dedication of the new Church on May 23, 2015. Each fluted ampulla has a square bottom that measures 2 ½ inches. With its round-head stopper, each ampulla stands 7 ½ inches tall and is able to contain, at the most, four fluid ounces. Initials are engraved on one side to indicate which holy oil is contained in it: INF stands for Oleum Infirmorum or the Oil of the Sick, CAT for Oleum Catechumenorum or the Oil of the Catechumens, and CHR for Sacra Chrisma or Sacred Chrism.\n\nAll that We Have: The New Processional Cross of Saint Julie Catholic Church\n\nPublished on March 12-13, 2016 in the Parish Bulletin of Jesus Our Savior Catholic Church, Morehead KY\n\nOn March 13, 2016, during the 8:00 AM Mass for the Fifth Sunday of Lent, I will bless the new processional cross for Saint Julie Catholic Church in Owingsville, Kentucky. It will be used for the first time by that Church next weekend when they commemorate the Lord’s Entrance into Jerusalem on the Palm Sunday of the Passion of the Lord.\n\nThis processional cross was given to Saint Julie’s this Lenten season by Dominic Capria and the Fr. Beiting Appalachian Mission Center (FBAMC) in Louisa, Kentucky. It had been used at the now closed Saint John Neumann Catholic Church in Hode, Kentucky, a mission of Saint Jude Catholic Church in Louisa from 1980 to 2015. Roger Porter (born 1945) of Jesus Our Savior Catholic Church in Morehead has painstakingly re-stained its handle and stand, cleaned the grime off the corpus, and made a new Latin cross to replace the damaged original.\n\nThis new cross was made with wood that is 3/4 of an inch thick. It is 22 inches tall and its horizontal arm spans 13 inches. Fixed on it is the foot tall figure of the Crucified Christ that was hand-carved from linden wood. Above this corpus is a matching titulus that is 1 ½ inch tall and four inches wide, bearing the Latin letters ‘INRI,’ the acronym for the inscription: Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum (cf. Jn. 19:20). The cross is mounted upon a rounded staff of dark cherry wood which complements the frames of the stained glass windows, the Stations of the Cross, and the rest of the furniture in the Church sanctuary. The cross with its staff stands six feet and five inches tall. When not in use, the processional cross can be put on a square stand that is four inches tall and 10 ½ inches wide.\n\nA processional cross is simply a crucifix that is usually mounted upon a long staff or handle so that it may be more easily seen at the head of a procession. Traditionally, the figure of the Crucified Christ faces the direction towards which the procession is moving. In the liturgy, and especially on Palm Sunday, it is a powerful call to the faithful to follow Christ into Jerusalem and beyond. The wounded figure of the Crucified reminds the Christian of the price involved in following the Lord, but it also presents to him the prize that He offers, for the cross is raised, not only as a standard to lead the faithful in their journey but more so, as the trophy of the Lord’s crucial victory over death.\n\nPublished on July 25-26, 2015 in the Parish Bulletin of Saint Andrew Catholic Church, Harrodsburg KY\n\nOn August 6, 2015, I will assume the role of Pastor of Jesus, Our Savior Catholic Church in Morehead KY, its Newman Center at Morehead State University, and its mission, Saint Julie Catholic Church in Owingsville KY. I will be taking the place there of the Very Rev. Paul G. Prabell as he returns to the Cathedral of Christ the King in Lexington KY for his second stint as its Rector. The Rev. Albert J. DeGiacomo will replace me here as Pastor of Saint Andrew and Saint Mary in Perryville. Fr. Al comes to us from the Newman Center at the University of Kentucky, Holy Spirit Parish in Lexington KY, where he has been serving as Pastor for the past six years.\n\nUnforeseen transitions like these often throw all of our plans, hopes, and expectations in disarray, and so I ask you to be patient with us and to pray for us as we move in and out of our parishes. You and I now share five years worth of history and it is foolish to think that those bonds just go away just because I have moved away. I already have assured the couples whom I have prepared for marriage that I am committed to presiding over their weddings as scheduled. I also promise you that, insofar as I am available, I am open to any invitations to come back and celebrate with you the sacraments. I will make an effort to attend funerals when I can and be accessible to couples who would want me to prepare them for marriage. But, I also realize that you need to welcome Fr. Al as much as you have welcomed me. I ask you then to give him the same chance that you have given me in my brief time as your pastor so that you too may form with him a lasting bond of friendship and faith.\n\nI have made it clear to our staff and to our Peer Ministry and Service Committees that I do not want to have a going-away party. I would rather have you save all that energy and expense for the welcome that you will give to our new Bishop when he comes to install Fr. Al as your new pastor on August 16. If you would like to honor me, I would prefer that you give a donation to the Saint Andrew Building Fund. We still have three and a half more years before we are able to pay off our Church debt. I had hoped that we would have paid it all off before I leave; your gift though will go a long way into making my dream of a debt-free parish a reality.\n\nThose who would like to keep contact with me after I leave can do so through Facebook or through my new mailing address: 404 North Wilson Avenue Morehead KY 40351. I also plan on keeping my cell phone number even as I move to a place where the area code is 606.\n\nThe weekend of August 1 and 2 is supposed to be my last here at Saint Andrew and Saint Mary. I look forward to seeing all of you then around the table of the Lord where we hope He will gather us again in His future full of hope (cf. Jer. 29:11)."
