        "text": "I may be a bit biased toward BG for a number of reasons (I’m an alumnus and currently involved in a volunteer capacity). Their enrollment is around 80-100 more than Ludden, and that’s after taking a hit the past few years on international student enrollment due to a combo of the prior administration’s student visa policies and the pandemic.\n\nWhere you send your kid honestly may depend on where you end up living. West-Enders and western suburb kids usually go to Ludden. North and east sides of the city and northern and eastern suburbs tend to go to BG (or CBA or MPH). Happy to chat further via PM.\n\nNorth suburbs like Clay, B’ville tend to head to Ludden while other Northern suburbs like Cicero, North Syracuse tend to head to Grimes, based on geography. Western suburbs like Westvale, Camillus, Onondaga Hill, Lafayette etc to Ludden while Eastern suburbs like East Syracuse, Dewitt more often head to Grimes. None of these are absolutes though since it’s a personal choice and you can go to either school regardless where you live. Our youngest went to Ludden, did well academically there and in college. My husband was a graduate many moons ago - yes in the Mark Wadach era.\n\nLike any school, it’s all personal preference. It’s all about what one considers a better fit. Have your child spend a day on a visit to each of the schools you are considering, going to actual classes etc, it will definitely help the child make an informed decision.\n\nFTR, I graduated from Grimes in the mid-90s. My freshman class started with about 90 kids and was down to 45 by the time I graduated. I am not sure if this is still the case, but this was common at the time as lot of parents would send their kids to Grimes for 7th-9th grade to avoid some of the public jr highs that had less than sterling reputations.\n\nI wish I could tell you that I had warm fuzzy memories of my time there, but I don't. I was/am an independent thinker with a wide streak of oppositional defiance, and most of the teachers there did not know what to make of me, so I ended up spending a lot of time in detention; admittedly most of them were well earned.\n\nThat being said, I did receive a decent education and had a few very good teachers. The other nice thing about the small class size was that it allowed me to play a sport every season. I am not a great athlete, but due to the limited student body, I was good enough to make any sports team I tried out for. TBH playing sports and not wanting to miss games or practices was the only thing that kept me grounded enough in the classroom to not be expelled.\n\nI do not have any friends from my time there, nor do I really care to relive that time. Grimes and I were just not a good mix. However, both my siblings went there and had excellent experiences. I know that my sister still has several close friends from her time there.\n\nFTR, I graduated from Grimes in the mid-90s.
