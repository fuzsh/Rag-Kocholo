The Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse made history today as Christopher Celentano becomes the first son of a permanent deacon to be ordained a priest. An ordination Mass started 10 a.m. at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception at Columbus Circle in downtown Syracuse. Celentano, 29, a native of Lyncourt and a member of St. Daniel Church in Lyncourt, is the son of Deacon Joseph and Diane Celentano of Lyncourt. Deacon Celentano is principal of St. Daniel/St. Matthew Academy in East Syracuse. The diocese's newest priest attended the former St. Daniel School and is a 1997 graduate of Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School. He earned a bachelor's degree sports management from Ithaca College in 2001 and completed his theological studies at St. Mary Seminary in Baltimore. He describes himself as a "huge Yankees fan" who hopes to continue to stay in shape with sports. "They thought I was a jock when I went to seminary," he said. After college, he worked with the Augusta, Georgia, Green Jackets baseball team, had a job in the finance field, and was accepted to law school. "In the meantime I was discerning it was the priesthood that was knocking," he said.
