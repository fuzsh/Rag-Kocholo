Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School is a Diocesan Preparatory School committed to providing a quality Christian education in the Catholic tradition.

The Bishop Grimes community provides a faith driven environment that nurtures each individual's overall development.

In an atmosphere that respects diversity and promotes global awareness, students are prepared and commissioned to go forth and use their God given gifts to effect positive change in the world.

We, at Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School, recognize our responsibility as ministers of the church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse to share in the mission of Jesus.

As disciples in this mission, we are both inspired and motivated by Vatican II and the pastorals of the American Catholic Bishops concerning the values of peace, justice and love.

We treasure the unique potential of each individual and strive to create a nurturing, spiritual, academic and emotional environment.
