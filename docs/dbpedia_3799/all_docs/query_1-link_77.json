        "text": "The dramatic cover art is a crop of Malcolm Wilde Browne’s iconic photograph of the self-immolation of Thích Quảng Đức, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, in Saigon in 1963. Đức burned himself to death at a busy road junction in the city in protest against the South Vietnamese government for their persecution of Buddhists in the country. Although the photo is of a completely different scene, it has a similar feel to other rock album covers of the period preceding the Rage album, such as ‘Bleach’ by Nirvana (1989) and to a lesser extent Mudhoney’s ‘Superfuzz Bigmuff’ (1988), all being action photos shot in black and white. The image ties in well with Rage’s protest agenda and their international outlook. Browne himself was undoubtedly an inspiration for the band members, recognised for his international reporting, and himself influenced by his mother, a Quaker with fervently anti-war opinions. The band members wore their heart on their sleeves in terms of outlook.\n\nIn 2001, Zach De La Rocha interviewed someone he really respected, Avram Noam Chomsky, the famous American linguist, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historical essayist, social critic, and political activist. The engagement between these two men from very different backgrounds but with much overlap in their interests and views, was a magical time, thankfully captured on video. De La Rocha comes across as a very eloquent, patient interviewer, starting with a question on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which locked Mexico into a ‘treaty’, framed as being of benefit to both countries, but actually revealed as a quashing of democracy. With his strong connections to Mexico, this whole scenario is close to the singer’s heart, Chomsky reporting the negative effect on the population, particularly the poor indigenous farmers and their right to land – Colonialism without war. Globalisation is another topic discussed, the drive to pander to massive corporations and put profit before human rights, the ‘ordinary people’ paying the costs.\n\nGoing a couple of steps further than Queen’s statement ‘no synthesisers’ that they displayed on their seventies album covers, Rage Against The Machine proudly declared on their records “no samples, keyboards or synthesizers used in the making of this record”, thereby setting out their stall as a rock band, pure and simple – guitar, bass and drums – albeit they were certainly pigeon-holed in ‘rap-metal’ subgenres and were influenced by hip-hop artists in their musical style. Their covers album ‘Renegades’, released in 2000, includes versions of songs by prominent multi-racial r’n’b/hip-hop/funk/rap artists Eric B. and Rakim, Afrika Bambaataa and Cypress Hill, contrasting with punk, garage, and more mainstream rock/singer-songwriters, all unified in a musical sense by the unmistakable Rage Against The Machine take on things.\n\nThe Rage Against The Machine ‘formula’ for songwriting, performing and recording produces very powerful results, the rhythm section of Commerford and Wilk one of the strongest in the rock canon. That coupled with Morello’s supertight riffing, inventive approach to effects and his unique ‘solos’ created using techniques that he dreamt up, made the band’s music stand out on its own, an opportunity seized on by former Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell who formed ‘supergroup’ Audioslave in 2001 with the trio, after Rage dissolved. The genie in the bottle for Rage is of course Zack De La Rocha, frontman, activist, lyricist and rapper/vocalist extraordinaire, without whom the band could not exist, an irreplaceable force of nature, his machine-gun delivery perfectly suited to the thunderous rock soundscape underneath.\n\nOpener ‘Bombtrack’ starts with a Tom Morello palm-muted guitar figure in standard tuning until Zack De La Rocha tells us that “It’s just another bombtrack” and the song bursts into life, the singer rapping over a tight band groove that mutates through the track. The repeated vocal hook is “Burn, Burn, yes you’re gonna burn!”, apt for a track made by a band on fire, playing their musical protest for the like of Thích Quảng Đức, a proponent of peace engulfed in flames to draw the world’s attention to the plight of the oppressed…\n\n‘Killing In The Name’ is in drop D tuning, “a tuning often favoured by guitarist Tom Morello, as it appears on no less than eight songs within the first two albums.” [3.] – This involves tuning the lowest string from E (the usual pitch in standard tuning) a whole tone down to D. Morello has since said that the riff was one from his archives, something he used years before when teaching a guitar student how to play in ‘drop D’ tuning. The track has become the band’s signature tune and the eerie intro is now very familiar. The first ‘verse’ sets out their stall, with multiple repetition of the lyrics “Some of those that work forces are the same that burn crosses..”, a reference to the Klu Klux Klan or KKK, the sinister white supremacist organisation in the USA that hid behind decency in public life, donning their garb to disguise their real characters – racist, violent and ruthless. In an interview in 2000, Tom Morello refers to his experience with ‘The Klan’ as a child:\n\n“I was raised in the white suburb of Libertyville, which is near Chicago. There was only one black person, me, in a town of 14,000 people. Being black in America is an instantly politicising experience. Libertyville wasn’t the most tolerant of places to live. My mother would find Ku Klux Klan material left in her office, and once a noose was hung up by some racist in her garage.” [4.]\n\n‘Killing In The Name’ is a protest against police brutality in the States and De La Rocha does not hold back with the repeated refrain at the end of the song, exclaiming “Fuck you I won’t do what you tell me!” and then screaming “Motherfucker!”. Radio-friendly unit shifter it ain’t but the song made it on to mainstream airwaves by hook or crook, and sometimes by complete ignorance, DJs like Bruno Brookes in the UK not knowing what the content was, putting down their headphones while the song blared out there, and the complaints flooded in – job done! Even the creepy machiavellian Simon Cowell was targeted by the song, when a fan started a campaign in 2009 to make ‘Killing In The Name’ the Christmas number one in the UK, in order to keep out a pop cover by a talent Cowell had groomed through his slimy show. The success of getting the song to the top ended up hinging on fans downloading a live version that Rage had recorded that year after hearing about the unlikely goings on…\n\nOn the third track ‘Take The Power Back’, De La Rocha is in speed delivery mode, telling us that “ignorance is taking over, yeah we gotta take the power back”. The lack of knowledge of ‘reality’ out there is a recurring theme in Rage’s lyrics, as well as other rap and hip-hop artists, notably Michael Franti’s ‘Disposable Heroes Of Hiphoprisy’ whose song ‘Television, the drug of the nation’ ranted that the box was “breeding ignorance and feeding radiation”.\n\nMuch slower and starting with a bass figure by Tim Commerford, ‘Settle For Nothing’ has an eerie feel, “and now I got a name” is the trigger for things to burst into life, De La Rocha’s scream of “suicide!” taking the dynamics back down. “Genocide!” A pretty, melodic guitar improvisation gives the listener some breathing space, Morello drifting into jazzier territory with a clean tone. De La Rocha picks up the anger again at the end, repeating the refrain “If we don’t take action now, we’ll settle for nothing later…We’re settle for nothing now, and we’ll settle for nothing later” Unsettling for sure.\n\n‘Bullet In The Head’ is the most ‘hip hop’ of all the album tracks, at least in its musical feel in the first part of the song. “And motherfuckers lost their minds” is the trigger for the catchy, angry hook “Just victims of the in-house drive by, They say jump, you say how high” – a reference to television, the drug of the nation? At the end, the song bursts out from it’s hip hop groove into a full-on rock out, then dropping down to an interlude leading to Zack screaming repeatedly “You gotta bullet in you fuckin’ head” before the final rock out closes it off.\n\nIn the intro to ‘Know Your Enemy’ De la Rocha tells us that “we’re gonna do another bombtrack – some kind of reprise of the opener? The track “features a guest appearance by Tool’s Maynard James Keenan, whose haunting melodic approach adds a new stylistic approach to the bridge.” [3.] “I got no patience” says Keenan. “Fuck the norm!” says De La Rocha. Another guitar break full of Morello’s technical wizardry takes us into the outro. “Ignorance, hypocrisy, brutality…All of which are American dreams” raps De La Rocha, the latter phrase repeated a cappella to end the song in powerful fashion.\n\n‘Wake Up’ was used in the final scene of the successful cult film ‘The Matrix, released in 1999, and the song closes the film soundtrack album, after an eclectic playlist provided by artists as diverse as Marilyn Manson, Propellerheads, The Prodigy and Monster Magnet. The lyrics criticise racism within the United States government, particularly organisations such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with references to former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover as well as black american heroes such as Cassius Clay (later to rename himself Muhammad Ali), Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, part of the latter’s speech delivered at the end of the famous Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, march, which in turn took from a phrase in 6:7 of the Epistle to the Galatians, the ninth book of the New Testament in the Bible: “whatever a man sows, this he will also reap”. Paraphrases of this appear in many popular songs, as well as being commonly used in conversation.\n\nIt’s another machine gun delivery from De La Rocha over an infectious funky groove, with wah wag, as Zach sticks “a fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy.”\n\n“I think I heard a shot” takes us back to the intro riff, an outro where Zack screams at us to wake up then recalls Doctor King’s words to end it on “How long, not long, because what you reap is what you sow.”\n\n‘Fistfull Of Steel’ “offers another take on the sentiments expressed in the more directly titled fifth track ‘Bullet In The Head’.” [3.] “Silence, something about silence makes me sick”, says Zack – The only silence on this album is in the gaps between tracks! The inevitable repeated phrase on this tune is “with a fistfull of steel” whilst in the penultimate, upbeat ‘Township Rebellion’, powered by an insistent bass in the beginning, it’s the indelible outro “Why stand on a silent platform? Fight the war, fuck the norm”. Commentary on ghetto culture with a worldwide perspective, from South Africa to LA, ‘Johannesburg or South Central’, the song has some brilliant lines, like ‘cape of no hope’, ‘our freedom or your life’ and the unforgettable repeated soundbite “Shackle their minds when they’re bent on the cross, When ignorance reigns, life is lost…”\n\nClosing track ‘Freedom’ has its moments, full of catchy riffs and changes in dynamics, with some great lyrics delivered by De La Rocha:\n\n“Brotha, did ya forget ya name?\n\nDid ya lose it on the wall\n\nPlayin’ tic-tac-toe?\n\nYo, check the diagonal\n\nThree brothers gone\n\nCome on\n\nDoesn’t that make it three in a row?”\n\nThe quietly spoken “Anger is a gift’ introduces some heavy rockin’, which gets even heavier at the end of the tune, De La Rocha growling/screaming (greaming/scrowling?) “Freedom” before the record ends in a collage of Tom Morello guitar effects…\n\nRage’s rise to fame was quick – The band played their first public show in 1991, signed to Epic a year later, released their debut that year (1992) and achieved instant approval from the industry, followed by huge sales and fan following.\n\nOften criticised for ‘selling out’ and ‘working for the man’ they rallied against, Rage found themselves in a no-win situation over and over. Interviewed in 2000, guitarist Tom Morello, who tenaciously defended their stance and decision-making through the years, summed up the band’s situation:\n\n“There have always been bands trying to make political music. But what is unprecedented is that Rage Against the Machine, an overtly political band, has sold 15 million records.\n\nA lot of this has to do with the compelling nature of our music, which combines punk, hip-hop and hard rock. We see our music as part of a cultural battlefield. We want to cut through the bullshit the system slams down young people’s throats.\n\nWe are trying to present an alternative view of the world. Rage Against the Machine want to build a bridge between the music and the movement. As well as doing a number of benefit gigs, the band also donates a proportion of every concert ticket sold to homeless charities, the Mumia campaign or the garment workers’ union.\n\nI’ve been arrested for civil disobedience. Zack, the band’s singer, spends nearly all of his free time in Mexico supporting the Zapatistas’ fight for freedom. The key to bringing about change is not music-it’s about being politically active.” [4.]\n\nAt times, there was a ‘gonzo journalism’ aspect to the band’s life, making things happen to film and write about them, activism in the style of maverick Hunter S. Thompson? This excerpt from an interview with Tom Morello in 2000 testifies to such:\n\n“Two days before we arrived in Britain we shot a video for our new single, ‘Sleep Now in the Fire’. Radical filmmaker Michael Moore directed the video. We shot the film on the steps of the Federal Building, which is across the street from the New York stock exchange.\n\nWe invited Rage Against the Machine fans to come along and join us in our video. Around 300 showed up. Suddenly the police arrived and arrested Michael. They dragged him off to jail. The rest of us stormed the stock exchange. About 200 of us got through the first set of doors, but our charge was stopped when the stock exchange’s titanium riot doors came crashing down.\n\nOur protest stopped trading at the stock exchange for the last two hours of the day. I guess we stopped downsizing for at least a couple of hours. It was a good day at the office. What is amazing is that all of this is all going to be in the new video.” [4.]\n\nRage Against The Machine recorded three more studio albums, ‘Evil Empire’ (released in 1996), ‘The Battle Of Los Angeles’ (released in 1999) and covers collection ‘Renegades’ (released in 2000). All these are great, but my favourite is still the first album, and that appears to be the general consensus. Two official live albums have also been issued: ‘Live & Rare’ and ‘Live At The Grand Olympic Auditorium’. The band have toured on and off since calling it a day the first time in 2001, hitting the road again this year, 2022, but unfortunately having to cancel their European tour dates, much to the chagrin of the fan base, after Zack De La Rocha badly injured his leg during a concert in the US, then being advised by his doctor that he had to go home and rest. Never has there been a better time to go back to 1992 and relive these protest songs, just as relevant now as they were then, powered by rock music and vocal delivery that makes you feel good to be alive!\n\n‘Rage Against The Machine’ – ‘Guilty Parties’:\n\nZack De La Rocha: vocals\n\nTimmy C.: bass\n\nBrad Wilk: drums\n\nTom Morello: guitars\n\n‘Rage Against The Machine’’\n\nOriginally released: 1992\n\nLabel: Sony/Epic\n\nRecorded at: Sound City, Van Nuys, California, USA\n\nProduced by: Rage Against The Machine and Gggarth\n\nMixed by: Andy Wallace\n\n‘Rage Against The Machine’ tracklisting:\n\n01.
