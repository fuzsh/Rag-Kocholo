Now, drawing from years of experience, Herstand has written the definitive guide for other like-minded artists, the ones who want to forge their own path and not follow the traditional markers of success, like record sales, hits on the radio or the amount of your label advance.‚Äù\n\nClick here to get it on Amazon üìö\n\n‚ÄúHow Music Got Free: A Story of Obsession and Invention‚Äù by Stephen Witt\n\n‚ÄúHow Music Got Free is a riveting story of obsession, music, crime, and money, featuring visionaries and criminals, moguls and tech-savvy teenagers.

His career spanned the entire history of the movies, from the silent era to the present, and he was guru to Alfred Hitchcock, Marilyn Monroe, Marlon Brando, and Jimmy Stewart, and to a new generation of filmmakers beginning with Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. For more than four years, Dennis McDougal interviewed over 350 people who knew the man with the giant dark horn-rimmed glasses ‚Äî colleagues, relatives, rivals ‚Äî and drew on tens of thousands of pages of documents to produce this extraordinary and first-ever portrait of a legend and his times‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nClick here to get it on Amazon üìö\n\n‚ÄúPlease Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk‚Äù by Legs McNeil & Gillian McCain\n\n‚ÄúA contemporary classic, Please Kill Me is the definitive oral history of the most nihilistic of all pop movements.

Author Dan Sicko demystified techno‚Äôs characteristics, influences, and origins and argued that although techno enjoyed its most widespread popularity in Europe, its birthplace and most important incubator was Detroit.

He feuded with David Geffen and outmanoeuvred Rupert Murdoch. He was also addicted to cocaine and alcohol ‚Äì until his doctor gave him just 3 months to live.‚Äù"
