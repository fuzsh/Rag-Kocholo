The band was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility, in 2017, then again in 2018, 2019, and 2021, but all of their bids were unsuccessful.

With B-Real, Chuck D, and DJ Lord, Morello, Commerford, and Wilk created Prophets of Rage in 2016, which produced one EP and one full-length studio album before disbanding in 2019.\n\nAfter an eight-year break, Rage Against the Machine announced in November 2019 that they would reunite for a world tour. The tour was originally intended to begin in 2020, however due to the COVID-19 epidemic, it was postponed until 2021, then to 2022.\n\nThis is a list of their nominations and awards; Rage Against the Machine has won two Grammy Awards and has received six nominations.
