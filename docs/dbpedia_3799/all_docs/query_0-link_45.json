        "text": "Rage Against the Machine\n\nAllmusic Biography : Rage Against the Machine earned acclaim from disenfranchised fans (and not insignificant derision from critics) for their bombastic, fiercely polemical music, which brewed sloganeering leftist rants against corporate America, cultural imperialism, and government oppression into a Molotov cocktail of punk, hip-hop, and thrash. Rage formed in Los Angeles in the early 90s out of the wreckage of a number of local groups: vocalist Zack de la Rocha (the son of Chicano political artist Robert de la Rocha) emerged from the bands Headstance, Farside, and Inside Out; guitarist Tom Morello (the nephew of Jomo Kenyatta, the first Kenyan president) originated in Lock Up; and drummer Brad Wilk played with future Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder. Rounded out by bassist Tim Bob (aka Tim C., born Tim Commerford), a childhood friend of de la Rochas, Rage debuted in 1992 with a self-released, self-titled 12-song cassette featuring the song \"Bullet in the Head,\" which became a hit when reissued as a single later in the year.\n\nThe tape won the band a deal with Epic, and their leap to the majors did not go unnoticed by detractors, who questioned the revolutionary integrity of Rage Against the Machines decision to align itself with the labels parent company, media behemoth Sony. Undeterred, the quartet emerged in late 1992 with their official debut, Rage Against the Machine, which scored the hits \"Killing in the Name\" and \"Bombtrack.\" After touring with Lollapalooza and declaring their support of groups like FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), Rock for Choice, and Refuse & Resist, Rage spent a reportedly tumultuous four years working on their follow-up; despite rumors of a breakup, they returned in 1996 with Evil Empire, which entered the U.S. album charts at number one and scored a hit single with \"Bulls on Parade.\" During 1997, the group joined forces with hip-hop supergroup the Wu-Tang Clan for a summer tour and remained active in support of various leftist political causes, including a controversial 1999 benefit concert for death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal. The Battle of Los Angeles followed later in 1999, also debuting at number one and going double platinum by the following summer. In early 2000, de la Rocha announced plans for a solo project, and the band performed an incendiary show outside the Democratic National Convention in August. The following month, bassist Commerford was arrested for disorderly conduct at MTVs Video Music Awards following his bizarre disruption of a Limp Bizkit acceptance speech, in which he climbed to the top of a 15-foot set piece and rocked back and forth.\n\nPlans for a live album were announced shortly thereafter, but in October, de la Rocha abruptly announced his departure from the band, citing breakdowns in communication and group decision-making. Surprised but not angry, the remainder of Rage announced plans to continue with a new vocalist, while de la Rocha refocused on his solo album, which was slated to include collaborations with acclaimed hip-hop artists including DJ Shadow and El-P of Company Flow. December 2000 saw the release of de la Rochas final studio effort with the band, the Rick Rubin-produced Renegades; it featured nearly a dozen covers of hip-hop, rock, and punk artists like EPMD, Bruce Springsteen, Devo, the Rolling Stones, the MC5, and more. By 2001, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford had formed Audioslave with former Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, and the group released an eponymous album by the end of 2002. With a de la Rocha solo album still not announced, Epic finally released the long-promised concert album Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium on CD and DVD in time for Christmas 2003.\n\nOver the next few years, rumors of a Rage Against the Machine reunion always swirled but never came to fruition. Two Audioslave albums followed in 2005 and 2006 before the group split, then the next year Morello began releasing protest folk-punk as the Nightwatchman. That year also brought the long-anticipated Rage Against the Machine reunion. First, the band played the closing day of 2007s Coachella festival, then in 2008 several other gigs followed, usually coinciding with major festivals in Europe and the U.S. No new studio work from Rage Against the Machine materialized but de la Rocha collaborated with former Mars Volta drummer Jon Theodore in a group called One Day as a Lion, who released an EP that year. The next burst of Rage activity came in 2009 when there was an Internet campaign to get \"Killing in the Name\" to the top of the U.K. charts, all in the hopes of thwarting an X Factor winner from taking the pole position. The viral campaign worked and Rage played a free celebratory concert at Finsbury Park in the summer of 2010.\n\nDespite all these gigs -- including a summer 2011 appearance at L.A. Rising, a festival the band arranged -- and word of a new album, no recordings appeared. In 2013, their debut album received a deluxe reissue and then the 2010 Finsbury Park gig saw a CD/DVD release in 2015. The next year, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford joined forces with Public Enemys Chuck D and Cypress Hills B Real to form the supergroup Prophets of Rage.

This is probably because the uniquely combustible creative relationship between guitar wizard Tom Morello and literate rebel vocalist Zack de la Rocha could only burn this bright, this once. While the formers roots in 80s heavy metal shredding gave rise to an inimitable array of six-string acrobatics and rhythmic special effects (few of which anyone else has managed to replicate), the latter delivered meaningful rhymes with an emotionally charged conviction that suburban white boys of the ensuing nu-metal generation could never hope to touch. As a result, syncopated slabs of hard rock insurrection like \"Bombtrack,\" \"Take the Power Back,\" and \"Know Your Enemy\" were as instantly unforgettable as they were astonishing. Yet even they paled in comparison to veritable clinics in the art of slowly mounting tension such as \"Settle for Nothing,\" \"Bullet in the Head,\" and the particularly venomous \"Wake Up\" (where Morello revises Led Zeppelins \"Kashmir\" riff for his own needs) -- all of which finally exploded with awesome power and fury. And even listeners who were unable (or unwilling) to fully process the bands unique clash of muscle and intellect were catered to, as RATM were able to convey their messages through stubborn repetition via the fundamental challenge of \"Freedom\" and their signature track, \"Killing in the Name,\" which would become a rallying cry of disenfranchisement, thanks to its relentlessly rebellious mantra of \"Fuck you, I wont do what you tell me!\" Ultimately, if theres any disappointment to be had with this near-perfect album, its that it still towers above subsequent efforts as the unequivocal climax of Rage Against the Machines vision. As such, it remains absolutely essential.

As the title suggests, their rage and contempt for the \"fascist\" capitalist system in America hadnt declined in the nearly half-decade they were away. Their musical approach didnt change, either. Lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha is caught halfway between the militant raps of Chuck D and the fanatical ravings of a street preacher, shouting out his simplistic, libertarian slogans over the sonically dense assault of the band. Since the band didnt perform together much after 1993, there isnt a collective advance in their musicianship. Nevertheless, guitarist Tom Morello demonstrates an impressive palette of sound, creating new textures in heavy metal, which is quite difficult. Even with Morellos studied virtuosity, the band sounds leaden, lacking the dexterity to fully execute their metal/hip-hop fusion -- they dont get into a groove; they simply pound. But that happens to fit the hysterical ravings of de la Rocha. Though his dedication to decidedly left-wing politics is admirable, his arhythmic phrasing and grating shouting cancel out any message he is trying to make. And that means Evil Empire succeeds only on the level of a sonic assault.

Recorded in less than a month, The Battle of Los Angeles is the most focused album of the bands career, exploding from the gate and rarely letting go the whole way through. Like a few other famous revolution-in-the-head bands (most notably Minor Threat), Rage Against the Machine has always been blessed by the fact that the band is spewing just as much vitriol as its frontman. Any potential problems created here by Zack de la Rochas one-note delivery and extremist polemics are smoothed over by songs and grooves that make it sound like the revolution really is here, from the single \"Guerrilla Radio\" to album highlights like \"Mic Check,\" \"Calm Like a Bomb,\" and \"Born of a Broken Man.\" As on the previous two Rage Against the Machine albums, Tom Morellos roster of guitar effects and vicious riffs are nigh overpowering, and are as contagious as the band has ever been since their debut. De la Rocha is best when he has specific targets (like the government or the case against Mumia Abu Jamal), but when he attempts to cover more general societal problems, he falters. If anything less than one of the most talented and fiery bands in the music world were backing him, The Battle of Los Angeles wouldnt be nearly as high-rated as it is. Album: 5 of 11\n\nTitle: Renegades\n\nReleased: 2000-11-28\n\nTracks: 12\n\nDuration: 51:33\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Wikipedia Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Microphone Fiend (05:01)\n\n2 Pistol Grip Pump (03:18)\n\n3 Kick Out the Jams (03:11)\n\n4 Renegades of Funk (04:35)\n\n5 Beautiful World (02:35)\n\n6 Iâm Housinâ (04:56)\n\n7 In My Eyes (02:54)\n\n8 How I Could Just Kill a Man (04:04)\n\n9 The Ghost of Tom Joad (05:38)\n\n10 Down on the Street (03:39)\n\n11 Street Fighting Man (04:42)\n\n12 Maggieâs Farm (06:54)\n\nRenegades : Allmusic album Review : Rush released after the late-2000 split between Zack de la Rocha and the rest of Rage Against the Machine, the covers album Renegades salutes the bands musical and philosophical roots, ranging from the old-school Bronx to the hard-rockin Motor City to protest-central Greenwich Village to gangsta-ridden L.A. As could be expected, the set works best when the group focuses on material from its most recent forebears: rappers and hardcore bands. Indeed, Renegades begins with a pair of powerful hip-hop covers -- Eric B & Rakims \"Microphone Fiend\" and Volume 10s \"Pistol Grip Pump\" -- that spotlight Rages immense strengths: Tom Morellos clean, heavy riffing and vocalist de la Rochas finely tuned spray of vitriol, just this side of self-righteous. Another hip-hop blast (and the one closest to home), Cypress Hills \"How I Could Just Kill a Man,\" is even more devastating, an easy pick for the highlight of the album. Listeners familiar with the originals, however, may have trouble with Rages covers of EPMDs \"Im Housin,\" the Stones \"Street Fighting Man,\" and Dylans \"Maggies Farm,\" a trio of original versions whose anger and emotion were conveyed more in the lyrics than the performances. Still, drummer Brad Wilk sets an appropriately frenetic hardcore tempo for the excellent version of Minor Threats \"In My Eyes,\" and de la Rocha stretches out well on the MC5s \"Kick Out the Jams.\" With just a bare few excepions, Renegades works well, in part because Rage Against the Machine is both smart enough to change very little and talented enough to make the songs its own.

The finished product isnt a very good look at one of the finest metal bands of the 90s, not because the performance quality is lacking but because of mixing problems and the simple problems inherent in transferring the energy of a live concert to record. Featuring highlights from the two shows, recorded September 12th and 13th, this delayed version of Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium also downplays the cover material that comprised the bands last studio album, Renegades, which is a good thing for the fans who agree that Rage performed better with originals than covers. Early on, the band storms through three of its career highlights -- \"Killing in the Name,\" \"Bulls on Parade,\" and \"Bullet in the Head\" -- with intense performances that capture its combination of heavy metal strut and punk rock disdain. Something is lacking here, though. Zack de la Rochas vocals are too high in the mix, and the band sounds powerful but surprisingly muddy. Tom Morellos ragged guitar work and siren effects occasionally cut through the fog, but the songs here add little to what fans know of the studio albums. The two covers, cut down from five, add little to the concert; Rages version of the EPMD classic \"Im Housin\" is a misguided attempt at injecting melodramatic tension into an original that was eerie precisely because the vocal was so nonchalant, and MC5s \"Kick Out the Jams\" is butchered by de la Rocha, whose attempts to sing the song are flubbed badly.

Featuring their self-titled breakout, Rage Against the Machine, as well as Evil Empire, Battle of Los Angeles, their covers album Renegades, and the live show, Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, this compilation charts the rise of the incendiary rap-rock act as they blew up both speakers and minds with their socially conscious lyrics and groove-heavy aggression. While all five albums are housed in mini-LP sleeves, there isnt anything in the way of B-sides or previously unreleased material, so this set is definitely more for the newly initiated than the die-hard fan.
