        "text": "Like you, every time I pop into the beat, I get Fresh.\n\nI’m not a scholar of old-school hip hop, and my knowledge of contemporary hip hop is limited to when my children change the station on the bathroom radio. I have played them “Rappers’ Delight” and “White Lines” and they have been way more respectful than I’ve been of Pitbull.\n\nParents can be tyrants. We often go way above our pay grade as far as imposing things on our children. While society approves of my supervising homework, curating media intake, and demanding that my offspring eat deep green vegetables, I often make them listen to Led Zeppelin in the way I hated ex-girlfriends shoving Ani DiFranco down my throat (“Now listen to this part!”), all the while I say terrible things to them about Lana Del Rey while they cry and cry.\n\nBut we all agree on Rage Against the Machine’s “Renegades of Funk,” and for years I had no idea it was a cover of an Afrikaa Bambaataa song from a generation before.\n\nThis song expertly blends musical and lyrical bombast, somehow comparing Tom Paine, the writer of the Revolutionary War tract “Common Sense,” to a band that can get a man to dance.\n\nNot only that, but it identifies the band as interstellar travelers and troubadors, going from land to land, singing “e-lectronic chants.”\n\nIn addition to a bass line that seeks to rip your spine from your back, “Renegades of Funk” suggests we destroy all nations.\n\nThis song is particularly inspirational to my daughter who, in fourth grade, already knows that “Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece, right down through the Middle Ages, Planet Earth kept going through changes. And then the Renaissance came, and times continued to change” makes for a sloppy essay.\n\nBut that’s the magic and power of a great song, isn’t it? You can hear it a thousand times over decades and not only love it for its faults but love it more because of them. That is why my next marriage will be to the song “Baby Got Back.”\n\nI like to think that the Sultans of Swing and the Renegades of Funk eye each other cautiously at Christmas parties, like Mumford & Sons does with Arcade Fire.\n\n“Renegades of Funk” performed by Afrikaa Bambaataa and by Rage Against the Machine\n\nYears: 1983, 2000\n\nComposers: Afrika Bambaataa, Arthur Baker, John Miller & John Robie\n\nLyrics\n\nNo matter how hard you try, you can’t stop us now\n\nWe’re the renegades of this atomic age\n\nThis atomic age for renegades\n\nRenegades of this atomic age\n\nThis atomic age for renegades\n\nSince the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece\n\nRight down through the Middle Ages\n\nPlanet Earth kept going through changes\n\nAnd then the Renaissance came, and times continued to change\n\nNothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades\n\nLike Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine\n\nDr. Martin Luther King, Malcom X\n\nThey were renegades of their time and age\n\nThe mighty renegades!\n\nWe’re the Renegades of Funk\n\nFrom a different solar system many many galaxies away\n\nWe are the force of another creation\n\nA new musical revelation\n\nAnd we’re on this musical mission to help the others listen\n\nAnd groove from land to land singin’ electronic chants like\n\nZulu nation\n\nRevelations\n\nDestroy all nations\n\nNow renegades are the people with their own philosophies\n\nThey change the course of history\n\nEveryday people like you and me\n\nWe’re the renegades we’re the people\n\nWith our own philosophies\n\nWe change the course of history\n\nEveryday people like you and me\n\nC’mon\n\nWe’re the Renegades of Funk\n\nWe’re poppin’, shockin’, rockin’, put a side of hip-hop\n\nBecause where we’re goin’ there ain’t no stop\n\nPoppin’, shockin’, rockin’, put’ a side of hip-hop\n\nBecause where we’re goin’ there ain’t no stop\n\nWe Poppin’,and shockin’,and rockin’, and put a side of hip-hop!\n\n‘Cause we’re poppin’, shockin’, rockin’ put a side of hip-hop\n\nPoppin’, shockin’, rockin’, put a side of hip-hop!\n\nWe’re the Renegades of Funk\n\nWe’re teachers of the funk\n\nAnd not of empty popping\n\nWe’re blessed with the force and the sight of electronics\n\nWith the bass, and the treble, the horns, and the vocals\n\n‘Cause everytime I pop into the beat we get fresh\n\nThere was a time when our music\n\nWas something called the Bay Street beat\n\nPeople would gather from all around\n\nTo get down to the big sound\n\nYou had to be a renegade in those days\n\nTo take a man to the dance floor"
