Muse took inspiration from it on Interlude (pre-Hysteria song). It is featured on Absolution and is played before Hysteria on each concert since the start of The Resistance tour.

This arrangement featured Bellamy's Kaoss Pad, with Wolstenholme playing single notes on delayed bass. No drums were used.\n\nThe riff/intro made it's return when Matt got his doubleneck Manson guitar in 2010. He played this as in the intro to Resistance on the top neck.

The anthem was adopted in 1948, the year the country was formed.\n\nThe lyrics of Aegukga were originally set to the music of Auld Lang Syne, before Ahn Eak-tai wrote the composition specifically for the anthem in 1935 (hence why it's similar to Auld Lang Syne at times).\n\nAegukga has four verses, but on most occasions only the first one, followed by the chorus, is sung when performed publicly on events.\n\nBellamy played the anthem as an intro Hysteria at the 2013 Hyundai Card Super Concert in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nAll Apologies\n\nRiff or jam Name All Apologies Artist Nirvana Writer/composer Nirvana Appearance 2022-10-14, 2023-04-18, 2023-11-04\n\nListen to the audio here\n\nAll Apologies is a song by Nirvana, released as the final song on their last album, In Utero, in September 1993.\n\nMatt played a snippet of the intro before We Are Fucking Fucked in Toronto during the Will of the People Theatre Tour in 2022.

After 2003 it was include mostly in the New Born outros riffage, and eventually in the Stockholm Syndrome one too.\n\nWith Showbiz's return in 2017, this riff was used as an outro to most performances of the song going forward, including its surprise performance at Rock Werchter in 2023.\n\nAsturias\n\nRiff or jam Name Asturias (Leyenda) Artist Isaac Albéniz Writer/composer Isaac Albéniz Appearance 21st April 2005 - 11th October 2013\n\nListen to the audio here\n\nAsturias (Leyenda), is a musical piece composed by Spanish composer and pianist Isaac Albéniz.

An unknown heavy riff that was first played after Psycho at the secret Exeter Cavern gig in April 2022. After the riff was heard publicly at the Eventim Apollo a month later, it was speculated to be the riff to Kill or Be Killed, or another heavy song, off of the then upcoming album Will of the People. However, this turned out to not be the case with it not being present on the album. It bears similarities to the heavy riff from Fury.\n\nThe Apollo riff has so far been played after Psycho and Map of the Problematique, but has also made one appearance being played after Stockholm Syndrome.\n\nCherub Rock\n\nRiff or jam Name Cherub Rock Artist Smashing Pumpkins Writer/composer Billy Corgan Appearance 9th December 2018, 12th April 2019, 25th February 2023\n\nListen to the audio here\n\nA song by American rock band Smashing Pumpkins from their second album, Siamese Dream, released in 1993.

The Wembley version was played often up until 2019, when for the Simulation Theory World Tour, the band decided to also include a synth with the guitar, so the two passed the motif between them (second clip).\n\nDMV\n\nRiff or jam Name DMV Artist Primus Writer/composer Primus Appearance 23rd November 2007 ; 6th August 2011 ; 28th January 2013\n\nListen to the audio here\n\nDMV is a song written by Primus from their 1993 album Pork Soda.

It was originally called Grande Marche Chromatique as it heavily used chromatic scales throughout the piece. It was, in 1901, rearranged for American wind bands by Canadian composer Louis-Phillipe Laurendeau under the title Thunder and Blazes, published by American publisher Carl Fischer.

Piano virtuoso Vladimir Horowitz stated that he refuses to perform this étude in public, saying that it is the most difficult of all the études.\n\nIt was played on piano as an intro to Sunburn probably due to the fact that the song was inspired by Chopin himself.
