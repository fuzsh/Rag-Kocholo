The head-banging, electrified punks have plans to return to the stage with as much fury as when they formed in 1991. In true Rage Against The Machine fashion, the band promoted this tour announcement with some social media guerrilla marketing.\n\nThe Instagram account with the handle “rageagainstthemachine” sat firmly below ten followers. With no other promotion, a singular post on the account dropped like a bomb. Featuring Susana Hidalgo’s photography of the protests in Chile, the post provided nothing more than five tour dates: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and two in Indio — better known as the setting for the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Less than 24 hours later, the account has skyrocketed to 100,000 followers.\n\nFrom packing out record stores in Southern California in 1992, to free pop-up shows at political conventions, to selling out gargantuan stadiums, Rage Against The Machine has ascended to the echelon of icons in the music realm. These reunion shows are ones you’re not going to want to miss. If you want to keep up to date, keep an eye out on social media, including the official Rage Against The Machine website.\n\nDive deep into the story of Rage bassist Tim Commerford featured on Ernie Ball’s “Inspired By” series down below.\n\nGear\n\nTim Commerford destroys using his “weapon” that is his Ernie Ball Music Man Stingray Special and uses Ernie Ball Regular Slinky bass strings.\n\nListen"
