Purple Rain is the sixth studio album by Prince, the first to feature his backing band The Revolution, and is the soundtrack album to the 1984 film of the same name. Purple Rain is regularly ranked among the best albums in music history and is widely regarded as Prince's magnum opus. Time magazine ranked it the 15th greatest album of all time in 1993, and it placed 18th on VH1's Greatest Rock and Roll Albums of All Time countdown.

Released in 1969, Aretha's Gold is the chart-topping greatest hits compilation that features her biggest hits from her early Atlantic albums: \"Respect,\" \"Think, (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\" \"Chain of Fools,\" and more.\n\nI Care 4 U is the first posthumous compilation album by the \"Princess of R&B,\" Aaliyah. Following her tragic and untimely passing, Blackground Records released a posthumous record including songs from her studio albums and previously unreleased tracks and demos, as well as hit singles and recordings that ultimately did not land on any previous albums. The compilation album was a commercial success and debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum, and features the previously unreleased \"Miss You.\"\n\nLimited vinyl LP repressing in gatefold jacket. Thriller is the sixth solo studio album by Michael Jackson. It was released by Epic Records on November 30, 1982, as the follow-up to Jackson's critically and commercially successful 1979 album Off The Wall. Thriller explores similar genres to those of Off The Wall, including pop, post-disco, rock, and funk. Recording sessions took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles with a production budget of $750,000, assisted by producer Quincy Jones. Seven singles were released from the album, all of which reached the Top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. In just over a year, Thriller became-and currently remains the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 65 million copies worldwide. It has become the first album ever to be certified 32 times multi-platinum for U.S. sales, marking more than 32 million sales shipped. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including for Album of the Year.\n\nThe work of one of the Most Awarded Female Artists of all time lives on in this 1 LP vinyl, Whitney. Reaching 10x Platinum status, the artist's GRAMMY-nominated second studio album went Diamond-certified, adding to the artist's superstardom that eventually included being the first African-American woman to earn three Diamond album certifications. \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),\" \"Didn't We Almost Have it All,\" \"So Emotional,\" and \"Where Do Broken Hearts Go\" all turned into Billboard Top 10 Singles.\n\nVinyl LP pressing. Highly anticipated 2015 debut album from Fort Worth, TX native Leon Bridges. Coming Home was produced by Austin Jenkins and Josh Block of White Denim. Bridges began writing and performing 1950s and '60s style soul music that was described by Austin 360 as \"a transmission straight from the heart.\" He began to attract followers and his break in the music industry is attributed to a run in he had at a bar with White Denim guitarist Austin Jenkins. The duo discussed clothing at the bar and a few weeks later Jenkins and bandmate Joshua Block ran into Bridges during a performance in north Texas. It was the performance of his original song Coming Home that caught the attention of Block and Jenkins. This debut includes that track and nine other originals.\n\nThe album Tribe Called Quest wanted to make from the very beginning. It's their most even, consistent album of the original trilogy that also includes People's Instinctive Travels... and the Low End Theory. But in spite of this, or maybe because of it, it's also their most uninteresting. With so many competent tracks, there's no chance for something to stand out above the pack, like \"Scenario\" did on Low End Theory or \"Can I Kick It ?\" did on People's Instinctive Travels. The celebration is there (\"Stir It Up\"), the jazz drums kick (\"Oh My God\"), and the stand-up bass dribbles, keeping perfect pace with Q-Tip's unmistakable mic-touch (\"Electric Relaxation\"). There's even a Native Tongues armistice/reunion with De La Soul (\"Awards Tour\"). Although it comes together like a seamless tutorial in jazz hip-hop style, it comes together so damn well that it's hard for any one track to excel, cursing the album with consistent quality.\n\nBethlehem Records earned its place in jazz history with the release of debut albums from artists like Carmen McRae, Chris Connor, Herbie Mann, and Johnny Hartman. Bethlehem's most famous release is the 1958 debut album by Nina Simone, Little Girl Blue. So when DJ Maestro got the chance to remix this album, he was thrilled. Soon he got the idea to ask some of his favorite producers to collaborate, like Mop Mop, Renegades of Jazz, Gramophonedzie, Fab Samperi, The Reflex, and Mees Dierdorp. They all had one thing in common: excitement to work with the original recordings from this iconic album. The result is 14 remixes, each with a unique approach to the original song, and all with a contemporary feel. Little Girl Blue Remixed is available on black vinyl.\n\nTwo LP set of Universal Motown's multi-platinum-selling, Grammy award winning singer/songwriter/actress Erykah Badu who returns to the music scene with her album New Amerykah featuring the debut single \"Honey.\" Laced with Erykah's bluesy grit and MC style vocals, the song is bolstered by producer's 9th Wonder's (Jay-Z, Nas, Mary J. Blige) razor sharp Hip Hop beats. The release of \"Honey\" marked Badu's 10th year in the music industry. The gifted trendsetter, Badu, has enlisted some of the most talented, groundbreaking underground producers and engineers in the Hip-Hop game to support her breakthrough return, including Mike Chav Chavarria and R&B singer Bilal."
