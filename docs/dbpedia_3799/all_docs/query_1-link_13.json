The group's lineup is: Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello, Tim Commerford, and Brad Wilk, Public Enemy's Chuck D and DJ Lord, and Cypress Hill's B-Real. Zack de la Rocha is not involved. They'll debut tonight at the Whiskey a Go-Go in Los Angeles, and will perform songs by all three groups, as well as new music. Proceeds from the show will benefit PATH, an organization that works to end homelessness. In an interview with KROQ, Morello referred to the band as \"an elite task force of revolutionary musicians.\" Watch the interview below.

Read the full interview here.\n\nProphets of Rage have also sent an email to fans confirming their existence and announcing the L.A. show. They write:"
