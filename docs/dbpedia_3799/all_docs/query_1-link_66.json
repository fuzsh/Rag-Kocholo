        "text": "The singles chart at 70\n\nHow the UK Christmas No 1 became a national obsession – and a vicious competition\n\nCharity singalongs, novelty hits and Facebook campaign curveballs – the festive top spot holds a symbolic power for the British. Is that why Mariah still can’t win it?\n\nTom Morello: ‘We came within a baby’s breath of a fascist coup in the US’\n\nLockdown and ‘looking after the grandmas’ may have kept the Rage Against the Machine guitarist away from recent protests – but he refuses to be silenced\n\nGang of Four: 'They made me realise anything is possible'\n\nGuitarist Andy Gill was working on a 40th anniversary album when he died last year. Now famous fans – from the Chilis’ Flea to La Roux – have finished the job, and Damien Hirst has designed the sleeve. They talk about what the band meant to them\n\n'Someone called me the antichrist': behind the battles for Christmas No 1\n\nChristmas No 1 was once a fiercely fought-over prize. From RATM v Joe McElderry, Slade v Wizzard and George Michael in Wham! v George Michael in Band Aid, winners and losers recall the great festive stand-offs"
