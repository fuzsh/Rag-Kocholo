On December 5th 2000, "Rage Against The Machine" released their last studio album to this day, almost two months after the band's official and first breakup.

The album is a homage to artists who influenced the band members and had a significant role in music history in the eyes of the Rage Quartet.

This is Rage's only album to not be accompanied by a supporting tour. Shortly after the release of the album, three of the four band members (minus vocalist Zack de la Rocha) formed a new band, "Audioslave", with Chris Cornell. RATM did, however, release the live album "Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium" in 2003, consisting of their final two concerts before their initial break-up.

The album's cover art is a parody of the pop artwork "LOVE" by Robert Indiana, with the word "love" replaced with "rage" and the letter G at the bottom left corner slanted (in the original sculpture, the slanted letter O is at the top right corner). The album's packaging also includes a poem by Josh Koppel. On the back of the album's cover, there is an artwork with a photograph of an American one-dollar bill with the message "You are not a slave" written on the back.

The album achieved platinum status a little over a month after its initial release.

There is no doubt that each and every song in the album was adapted to the Rage style and it sounds like an original Rage album!!
