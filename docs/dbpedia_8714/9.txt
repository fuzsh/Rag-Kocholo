Looks like, the New Year has brought in a lot of good luck for Reshmi Ghosh, as she has been signed to feature in not one but two new shows in the very first week.

As reported earlier, the charming beauty has been roped in to essay a role in Zee TV’s Buddha. Moreover, a source has informed us that there is another 2-hour episodic of Shapath (Fireworks Productions) of which Reshmi will be a part of.

In the show, the actress will play the role of a century-old Queen who lives in the 21st century. In a commanding position, she will create chaos in the lives of people living in that era. Reshmi starts shooting for the episodic from 7 January.

When we contacted Reshmi in regards to the same, she confirmed by stating, “I will shoot for Buddha from 5 January while for Shapath I start shooting from 7 January. Earlier too I have worked for Shapath and have full faith in the production house. So, once I was given a brief that I will be essaying a Queen who belongs to a decade old era, I did not think much before signing on the dotted lines as I am sure that it would be a great experience.”

Looks like the way shows are coming to her, the actress is poised to keep herself busy all round the year.
