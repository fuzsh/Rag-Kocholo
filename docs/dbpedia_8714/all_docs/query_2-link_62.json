        "text": "Reshmi Ghosh who shot to fame as Bhoomi in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi is on cloud no. 9 nowadays. Guess why? Her tenure of her 5 long years with boyfriend Amit Gupta has finally taken the shape of marriage.\n\n“Yes, finally I am getting married”, says an excited Reshmi. “I have dreamt of marriage since childhood and now finally it is happening with me. Once we wrap up Nach Baliye maybe…Most probably early next year we will tie the knot”.\n\n“Amit and I have been dating each other past 5 years. 5 years is long enough to know that one can spend his/her life with their partners. I know Amit in and out. He is the kind of guy always dreamt of. We understand each other very well and that is what makes a relationship”, says Reshmi confidently.\n\nReshmi still is not confirming her marriage dates. She says, “It is for our parents to decide. I always wanted to get married to a marwari and after meeting Amit I knew he is the one. The one with whom I can spend my life with. I am in love with the marwari culture and I am happy Amit is a marwari”.\n\n\"I want to do it in a very grand way. A wedding of 11 days with all my friends and relatives,\" says the actress.\n\nReshmi says she will let everyone know once her marriage dates are out. “I am too excited to know when I am getting married and so I will tell the whole world too”."
