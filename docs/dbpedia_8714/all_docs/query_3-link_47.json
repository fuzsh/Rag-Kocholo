        "text": "​\n\nI am mostly a self-taught upcoming emerging artist of India. The three words that describe my art in brief are Culture, Traditions and Spirituality. I am fascinated by the ancient culture of my motherland – India, which has a history spanning thousands of years and this along with the traditions of this land forms the basis of my art. This connects me with my roots and gives me a sense of belonging.\n\n​\n\nI am a Chartered Accountant by profession and after over twenty years of teaching Finance, I decided to dedicate my life in the pursuit of my passion - visual arts. I had enrolled for Fine arts course on weekends and learned water colours from Artist Milind Mulick and other masters of art. I tried my hands in traditional and tribal arts of India like Warli, Madhubani and Pichwai painting under the masters of those arts. The soulful and meditative arts like Mandalas and Zentangles mesmerized me and enriched my soul.\n\n​\n\nMy professional art interest started when I signed up for membership for Art NextLevel with Sergio Gomez, an international artist based in Chicago, USA. During the pandemic I started working on my series titled \"Nostalgia Rajasthan.\" My art and story in this new painting series is about the artistic people of this land, the art found in the rural areas, in their attire, architecture, bazaars and rituals. The rich traditions, friendly people and the delicious cuisine inspired me to create these art works.\n\n​\n\nDuring the Ganpati festival of 2021 saw me release a series titled: 'Suddhi Vinayaka' where I have used Lord Ganesha as a protagonist to help us fight the evils of all kinds of pollution like Air, Noise and others and he also asks us to 'Beware of Fake news'. I released another body of works titled \"Cosmic Connections\" about my study of patterns of nature in December 2021.\n\nIn the month of March 2022, saw me coming up with my first Solo Art Exhibition at Malaga, Spain at MUSEO EI MOLINO where 15 of my paintings were exhibited.\n\n​\n\nI also had a group show with Akrutee group of artists at Balgandharav Pune on the occasion of International Women's Day of 2022; the proceeds of sale of paintings went for an NGO. I participated in a Group show at the Taj Art Gallery, Mumbai in November,2022. In March 2023, I took part in an International Group show at the Entertainment Society, Panjim Goa. I participated in a group show in May 2023 at the Raja Ravi Verma Art Gallery, curated by Ajay Chandak. (Press: \"ELEGANZ”: 31 Self-taught artists present International Group Art Exhibition at Pune - Chinha Art News)\n\n​\n\nI am currently working on a new series titled \"Descent into India's Incredible Stepwells of India' and will be releasing a new body of works in the year 2024. I am travelling to different parts of India to have a firsthand information about these ancient structures and research extensively on my art project. Come, explore with me the world of Stepwells through my mixed media art.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL\n\nINFORMATION\n\nRashmi Ghosh, a Chartered Accountant by profession, transitioned from a successful career in finance to pursue her lifelong passion for visual arts, accumulating over two decades of experience in teaching. Having undertaken a Fine Arts course during weekends, she received instruction in watercolors from renowned artist Milind Mullick and other masters of the art.\n\nAn emerging artist poised to launch her art career; Rashmi has already left a notable mark on the art scene. Her artistic endeavors have been showcased in over ten group exhibitions across India, an International Solo Show in Malaga, Spain, and the International Virtual Art Exhibition titled \"Opening,\" curated by Sergio Gomez in Florida, USA.\n\nPresently, Rashmi's artistry is on display at The India Art Architecture and Design Biennale 2023 at the Red Fort, Delhi, curated by Vikramjit Singh Rooprai and Dr. Abira Bhattacharya.
