        "text": "The charming and pretty looking Rashmi Desai charmed millions of hearts by being a participant in various shows such as Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 5, Comedy Circus and through her current show Uttaran. However, recently she hit headlines for her alleged break up with husband Nandish Sandhu.\n\nIn conversation with Tellychakkar.com, the beautiful Rashmi talks about her likes and dislikes in life in our quickie section.\n\nWhat is your comfort food after a hard day’s work?\n\nI like having simple food. I like eating either dal rice or roti and vegetables.\n\nMost played song on your iPod?\n\nI like listening to romantic songs and ghazals. My choice of song depends on my mood.\n\nIf you were to get stuck somewhere with no phone or internet, where would it be and with whom?\n\nIt could be anywhere in the world with my mother who is also my best friend.\n\nLive-in or marriage?\n\nThe decision depends on person to person.\n\nLove is…\n\nLove is life.\n\nSex is…\n\nSex is need of the body.\n\nCraziest rumor you have heard about yourself?\n\nI have heard a lot of them but there is nothing which I can recollect. That is primarily because I am more focused on my work and personal life.\n\nWhat is best done slowly…eating or kissing?\n\nEating should be done slowly.\n\nEvery person needs?\n\nEvery person needs peace in life.\n\nWhat is something that you need to stop doing immediately?\n\nI really need to learn how to politely avoid certain situations and people by saying a ‘no’.\n\nWhat have you always wanted to do but never done?\n\nI have always wanted to bungee jump but never got an opportunity to.\n\nOne word that describes you…\n\nI am a very effervescent and vibrant person.\n\nThe ongoing track of Life OK’s Devon Ke Dev…Mahadev (Triangle Film Company) focuses on Mahadev (Mohit Raina) motivating and blessing Kartikey (Rishiraj Pawar) to fight against Arunasur (Rahul Dev).\n\nAs seen, Kartikey challenges Arunasur to fight with him, but the latter refuses to accept the challenge. Kartikey tries to attack Arunasur, but Arunasur succeeds in defending himself. Arunasur takes Kartikey to his kingdom, in order to revive his mother and on seeing the dead body of Arunasur’s mother, Kartikey stops fighting with him. Kartikey, in turn promises him that he will convince the Gods and bring back Arunasur’s mother and seeing this Shiva (Mohit Raina) and the other Gods are in for a major shock.\n\nWell, the coming episodes of the show will add on to the inquisitiveness of the viewers and spice element in the show.\n\nA source informs us that Kartikey will get into a major argument with his father, Mahadev, demanding him to breathe life into Arunasur’s mother without realizing that it is an emotional trap laid upon him by the evil Arunasur. While Mahadev and the other Gods try to explain him the fact, the show will witness a whole lot of melodrama on the same.\n\nWill Mahadev grant the stubborn child, Kartikey his wish to help Arunasur?\n\nThe answer is ‘no’.\n\nMore drama will unfold with Mahadev leading the fight which was put down by Kartikey. But with Lord Bhrama’s (Radha Krishna Dutt) blessing upon him that no human, God or a four legged creature will be able to kill Arunasur, Mahadev won’t be able to kill Arunasur.\n\nQuite interestingly, Devi Parvati will transform herself into Bhramridevi, a six legged huge creature and will end up killing malevolent Arunasur, a scene which will finally hit another mind-blasting chord with its audience.\n\nRishiraj Pawar. who essays the role of Kartikey, says, “It will be an interesting watch for the viewers to see how Arunasur gets killed.”\n\nStay tuned for this interesting track in Mahadev.\n\nShaleen Malhotra is very articulate; perhaps that is the training from his MTV Roadies days. The handsome, dashing and mesmerizing actor who plays Arjun Suryakant Rawte in Arjun – Har Yug Mein Aayega Ek on Star Plus may not be that good an investor, but shares with us on how he manages his expenses. Read on to know more about Shaleen.\n\nHow important is money to you?\n\nA lot of people say that money cannot buy you happiness, and relationships are more important but all those people talking about are actually earning moolah also. I feel money is very important to fulfill one’s needs, earn status, feel secure and live a comfortable life. Money is very important, but if I speak about my priorities, it is not more important than family values and respect towards my own people.\n\nAre you an impulsive buyer?\n\nYes. Thank God I am shooting for Arjun (Star Plus) at the moment and keep myself busy or else I would be purchasing something or the other.\n\nWhat are the investments that you have made?\n\nIt is too early to talk about this, but I have invested in a small property and some gold.\n\nWhat has been your most expensive purchase?\n\nI own a car. That has to be my most expensive purchase so far.\n\nDo you feel financially secure?\n\nI do not feel financially secure as of now.\n\nWho handles your expenses?\n\nUnfortunately, I handle my own expenses. I wish someone could handle my expenses as I am bad at it.\n\nWhat was your first salary?\n\nMy first salary was Rs. 600 that I earned while anchoring a mall activity.\n\nHow much money do you carry every day?\n\nI am a poor man (laughs).\n\nYour advice to new investors?\n\nI am a very wrong person to advice people on investment matters\n\nDope…dope…dope!!!\n\nYes, Tellychakkar.com has just learnt from a credible source that lot of drama is unfolding off screen on the sets of Life OK’s Gustakh Dil (Ravi Ojha Productions).\n\nWe will straight get in to the meat.\n\nYash Sinha and Amrapali Gupta, the married couple who was last seen in Nach Baliye (season 6), apparently has been bumped off by the production personnel of the above show on grounds of creative and monetary differences.\n\nHere’s more info from the same source: “Yash and Amrapali were supposed to play the role of Nikhil’s (Vibhav Roy) friends. They would have come down to Nikhil’s house and take him and Lajjo (Sana Amin Sheikh) out on a trip for some fun time. All was good, but then when they came to the sets creative and monetary issues cropped up and then were let go.”\n\nWhen we buzzed Yash he denied going to the set and said, “Yes, we were in talks but due to date issues things did not materialize.”\n\nHowever, a credible source from the sets shared that Yash and Amrapali did come on the sets and left later.\n\nSo who has come in as replacements? Well, the names are Namrata Thapa and Chaitanya Chaudhary.\n\nSaid Namrata: “One of the primary reasons for taking up the cameo role was that I have been essaying a lot of traditional positive characters on television where I get to dress up in a saree most of the time. This character is that of a bubbly lady wearing western outfits with a modern personality. I have worked earlier in Ravi Ojha’s Badalte Rishton Ki Dastaan and it is a good production house. I and Chaitanya play husband and wife on-screen.”\n\nShared Chaitanya: “I have also worked with Ravi Ojha Productions earlier for Badalte Rishton Ki Dastaan on Zee TV and it has been a great experience working with them. The production house wanted to get a known personality to essay a cameo role for 4-5 episodes and who will bring more understanding between Nikhil and Laajo. I am currently shooting for a film so a cameo role interested me as I have got some time in hand.”\n\nKeep reading Tellychakkar.com for more details!!!\n\nTelevision actor Rohitashv Gaur, who is popularly known as Mukundilal in SAB TV’s comic show Lapataganj Ek Baar Phir, is quite experienced when it comes to the magnitude of work he has done, be it on TV or the big screen.\n\nIn conversation with Tellychakkar.com, the talented talks about his journey and experience in this competitive industry. Read on to know more about the actor…\n\nYou have acted in a lot of films and television. How has your experience been in the industry?\n\nIt has been an amazing experience. Having acted in films and television, I must say that television has given me a lot in terms of a platform to showcase my talent. I have acted in films such as Matrubhoomi, Dhoop, 3 Idiots andMunnabhai M.B.B.S. where I was offered clichéd cameo roles, but television has given me an opportunity where I was able to showcase my flexibility in acting.\n\nWhat have you learnt from your experience in the industry?\n\nWell, the industry as of today has shaped up very well and what I have learnt and would love to share is that television medium is vast and has a lot of scope and so do films. But television shows are regular and helps one to shape up his or her character better than the characters in films. I feel an actor should be open to films and television and not be choosy about acting in particular mediums. Look at our industry today, while actors from the television industry are stepping into films, there are many doing both films and television like Rajeev Khandelwal, Anil Kapoor and Mr. Amitabh Bachchcan too! In fact I have recently signed Rajkumar Hirani’s upcoming filmPeekay, and in a conversation I had with the man, he too feels the same.\n\nWhat genre are you most comfortable with?\n\nWell, if one observes, I have always preferred doing roles which have more of the elements of drama. Even inLapataganj, I play Mukundilal who is a part of the situational comedy and not slapstick. Apart from comedy, I would really like to essay something like what Anup Soni essays in Balika Vadhu (Colors).\n\nSome television show you really wish to be a part of today?\n\nI really wish I could essay a role in Balika Vadhu. In fact, I was also offered a role too, but could not take it up as I had committed to Lapataganj. I do not regret not taking up the role but I really wish to pursue such kind of a character in future.\n\nSome actors face a hard time in this industry so much that they decide to pack their bags and go back to their hometown. Have you faced a similar situation in your career?\n\nI have gone through such a phase in my life. It was in 1989 when I first came to Bombay. At that time satellite network was not available in the market and the industry entertained viewers through the morning transmission on Doordarshan. It was impossible for me to even step into the competition then. I later enrolled myself into the National School of Drama and made my survival possible in this industry.\n\nNow that you have acquired name, fame and stability, yet do you feel insecure at times?\n\nEvery actor is insecure. When actors take a step into the world of acting, they feel insecure of whether they will be able to make it as actors or not, and once they have that fame and desired success, they are insecure about sustaining the same.\n\nAdvice to aspiring actors?\n\nThere is a saying called, ‘Door Ke dhol bahut suhane lagte hai’. I would advise all the aspiring actors to think 10 times before taking up acting as it is not an easy profession to survive in.\n\nLooks like, the New Year has brought in a lot of good luck for Reshmi Ghosh, as she has been signed to feature in not one but two new shows in the very first week.\n\nAs reported earlier, the charming beauty has been roped in to essay a role in Zee TV’s Buddha. Moreover, a source has informed us that there is another 2-hour episodic of Shapath (Fireworks Productions) of which Reshmi will be a part of.\n\nIn the show, the actress will play the role of a century-old Queen who lives in the 21st century. In a commanding position, she will create chaos in the lives of people living in that era. Reshmi starts shooting for the episodic from 7 January.\n\nWhen we contacted Reshmi in regards to the same, she confirmed by stating, “I will shoot for Buddha from 5 January while for Shapath I start shooting from 7 January. Earlier too I have worked for Shapath and have full faith in the production house. So, once I was given a brief that I will be essaying a Queen who belongs to a decade old era, I did not think much before signing on the dotted lines as I am sure that it would be a great experience.”\n\nLooks like the way shows are coming to her, the actress is poised to keep herself busy all round the year.\n\nThe talented and gorgeous Paridhi , who was seen as the parallel lead in the Star Plus’ Ruk Jana Nahi, made a royal comeback in television as Jodha in Balaji Telefilm’s historical Jodha Akbar on Zee TV.\n\nIn a talk with Tellychakkar.com, the gorgeous lady makes a style statement as she defines fashion for our Lifestyle section. Excerpts:\n\nFashion is: Fashion is wearing something which one is comfortable in and looks presentable at the same time.\n\nWho chooses your clothes?\n\nI have a personal designer who chooses clothes for me.\n\nDo you wear accessories?\n\nI personally do not like to accessorize myself but if I have to, I make use of Kundan work jewellery that I have in a lot.\n\nDo you follow any brands?\n\nNope. I buy anything which interests me and that can be from a street or a shop.\n\nFavourite shopping destination?\n\nI love shopping in my hometown, Indore.\n\nMost expensive buy:\n\nMy most expensive buy was my bridal lehenga which worth Rs. 5.5 lakh.\n\nClothes you are comfortable in:\n\nI am most comfortable in an Indian wear.\n\nMust have in your wallet:\n\nHmm…lip balm, my kajal, my lipstick, money and credit & debit cards.\n\nFavourite perfume:\n\nAmongst a host of perfumes which I like, I love wearing Provogue, Elizabeth and some brands from France such as Ulric De Varens.\n\nDescribe sale in one word:\n\nFor me sale means low quality.\n\nCurrently your wardrobe is overflowing with?\n\nA lot of anarkali dresses.\n\nYou have the hardest time getting dressed for?\n\nI have the hardest time getting dressed for my costume in Jodha Akbar.\n\nAny fashion disaster you have come across recently?\n\nNot really…\n\nIf you had to choose a fashion era, which period will it be?\n\nI believe that every era has its own charm.\n\nSeen as a rebellious teenager Keshav Desai (KD) in Channel V’s The Buddy Project, Fahad Ali hails from Dehradun. The chocolate boy came down to Mumbai with a dream to make it big on the silver screen. He is of the feeling that every person has got one life and one needs to listen to his/her heart and follow it. Read on to know more about the talented Fahad in our Quickie section:\n\nWhat is your comfort food after a hard day’s work?\n\nI like having juices and shakes with salad full of proteins.\n\nMost played song on your iPod?\n\nI love listening to Mirrors by Justin Timberlake.\n\nIf you were to get stuck somewhere with no phone or internet, where would it be and with whom?\n\nAhh, I would love getting stuck in Dehradun with my family.\n\nLive-in or marriage?\n\nI believe in the institution of marriage.\n\nLove is…\n\nA different feeling! Whoever experiences love should know that it is a gift from God.\n\nSex is…\n\nSex is two souls expressing their love for each other.\n\nCraziest rumor you have heard about yourself?\n\nLast year I heard a rumour that I was no more interested in Buddy Project. That was a time when I was actually getting the feel of the character and motivated to do full justice to it.\n\nWhat is best done slowly…eating or kissing?\n\nAccording to me, kissing should be done slowly.\n\nEvery person needs?\n\nEvery person needs love.\n\nWhat is something that you need to stop doing immediately?\n\nI need to stop taking too much stress.\n\nWhat have you always wanted to do but never done?\n\nI have done a lot of adventure and water sports but not bungee jumping. So that is something I really want to do.\n\nOne word that describes you?\n\nI am one who chases his dreams only till it comes true. I feel we have got one life and one needs to listen to his/her heart and follow it. When I started from Dehradun, I came with the same thought.\n\nActors are often subject to minor accidents while shooting.\n\nSimilar was the case with Kanwar Dhillon who suffered a minor injury but this time it was out of the recklessness of the crew of Life OK’s Do Dil Ek Jaan (Nautanki Films Pvt. Ltd.).\n\nAs we all know that the show is planning a leap. While shooting for a particular sequence in which he was to be shown hurt, female lead Shritama Mukherjee had to apply Dettol and put a bandage on the artificial wound on Kanwar’s head. However, little did Kanwar know that he was in for a greater shock.\n\nDivulged Kanwar, “When the Dettol was being applied it burnt me a little. I presumed that it was giving a burning sensation as it was an antiseptic. But when I took of the bandage after an hour it pulled out my skin too. Later I learnt that the Dettol was not diluted.”\n\nThough the shoot was called off for sometime Kanwar bounced back for the shoot with his real wound (as the artificial wound was no more needed).\n\nCommenting on the incident, the handsome Kanwar added, “Well these kinds of incidents keep happening. All we can do is learn from such incidents. I will henceforth make it a point to check things particularly the medication which I am being put to use.”\n\nBe careful, buddy!!!"
