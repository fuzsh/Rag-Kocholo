        "text": "So very many design choices, technical choices, and human-centered insights go into this. It's been really rewarding to get to work in what is essentially a new technological space. Not often do you get a chance to participate in shaping a novel new frontier, and the constant learning, speed of product building, and even the navigating the tension between how things have worked for decades and how they will work in the future is, well, exciting. Exhausting. Amazing. Addictive. Among the amazing opportunities and challenges in this work is how to generate useful human and user focused learning to shape the product making in a moment where the product on Monday is not at all what it is on Tuesday. Keeping pace with and getting ahead of the engineering and design choices has required seeing the problem space in a fundamental and broad manner, with a dash of seeing around corners and into the future.\n\n#MicrosoftCopilot is a digital companion for your whole life that will create a single #Copilot user experience across Bing, Edge, Microsoft 365, and Windows. 😉 The new Copilot icon and user experience will start to roll out across all Copilots, first in Windows on September 26 and then in Microsoft 365 Copilot on November 12.
