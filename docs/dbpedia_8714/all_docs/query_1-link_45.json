        "text": "Dusky beauty Reshmi Ghosh who had taken a sabbatical from Hindi television post Sankatmochan Mahabali Hanuman will soon be seen in a travel show.\n\nSays Reshmi, “I have stayed away from hosting, but a travel show is different kettle of fish and yes I have wander lust. We cover every city very deeply and that is fun, for only then you understand its peculiar food, clothing, cultural habits etc. Each place is unique from the other and this diversity makes India rock.”\n\nReshmi who has been around for many years doing films and TV (Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Karam Apnaa Apnaa, Kayamath, Buddha and more recently Sasuaral Simar Ka) attributes her long innings to, “Hard work, professionalism and yes patience. You need to keep at it, for there will be long periods when nothing will happen.”\n\nFor the moment Reshmi is once again exploring Bengali cinema. “In films I like realistic portrayal. Hence Bengali flicks are the best. I am in talks for a few projects, but nothing concrete as of now. As for the over top drama, I have done that in TV. Also there are South films.”\n\nAlthough our industry is full of Bengali beauties, Reshmi stands out in the sense that her Hindi is clear. “I have always loved the national language. Having said that, even I could not properly pronounce certain words. I worked on them taking help of Urdu diction coaches. Many Bong actors still have issue with their accents.”\n\nApart from TV and films Reshmi would also love to try out web series. “This is very high on my bucket list, for their stories and mounting are classy and film like. Also its limited nature allows us to give our best.”\n\n“However I am not comfortable doing bold stuff which most web shows including Ekta Kapoor’s ALTBalaji offerings require today. I am sure there will be characters which suit my sensibilities as well. Having said it, you never know tomorrow I might be game for bold roles also, never say never,” avers the actress.\n\nBest of luck, Reshmi!!"
