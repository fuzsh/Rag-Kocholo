        "text": "On a wet, rainy day in Mumbai, in fact the wettest day according to the Met's office, ayurveda specialist, philanthropist and social worker Dr Samir Mansuri launched his NGO Blind's Dreams in Mumbai on Sunday. Though it didn't just rain, the skies opened and it poured, the wet weather didn't dampen the spirits of the motley group of committed persons who made it to the event in spite of the flooded roads at Andheri.\n\nAt the inauguration Dr Samir Mansuri's NGOs Blind’s Dreams and the Indian Forum for the Blind announced the institution of the OCEAN MIRACLE AWARDS for exemplary performance by individuals who are physically challenged, handicapped and blind in India. The first edition of the awards will be held on 9th July 2013 at Sea Princess hotel, Juhu in Mumbai. The OCEAN MIRACLE AWARDS will also honor normal individuals who are not physically handicapped or blind but have become icons in their respective fields.\n\nWhile announcing the awards in Mumbai, ayurveda expert and chairperson of Blind’s Dream Dr Samir Mansuri said, “The OCEAN MIRACLE AWARDS will be held on 9th July 2013 in Mumbai to encourage, motivate, support and sponsor physically challenged, handicapped and blind persons in India. The purpose of the awards is to encourage and motivate physically challenged persons, both male and female to take up challenges in life, to face life in spite of their handicap and with perseverance and dignity. Deserving students will be given scholarships and sponsor ships to help them tide over financial hurdles, while those who have scored well over the last year will be honored and awarded prizes. Through the OCEAN MIRACLE AWARDS, we intend to encourage the spirit of entrepreneurship among handicapped and disabled youth so that they can support themselves and stand up to the challenges in life.\"\n\nWell-known model and television actress Reshmi Ghosh has been selected as the spokesperson for the OCEAN MIRACLE AWARDS, said Dr Samir Mansuri.\n\nDr Samir Mansuri's personal life story is really touching. He has lived on railway platforms, washed dishes in restaurants, slept and lived beneath stair cases in dilapidated or under construction buildings and worked in massage parlors as a masseur to earn his living and save money for his higher education. Mansuri completed his graduation in Arts and then went on to do a specialization in Ayurveda.\n\nPresent at the event were the General Secretary of the National Association of the Blind (NAB) Anand, Gujarat chapter Ms Sudhaben K Patel and her sister Radhaben Patel - co-incidentally the first blind woman sarpanch in India along with popular television actress Reshmi Ghosh and upcoming model and actor Dolly Arora along with other dignitaries and officials of other Blind and Handicapped persons associations in India."
