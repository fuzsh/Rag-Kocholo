        "text": "Adaa - Will Kill U brings together Miss World Diana Hayden, the first Asian Mr World Rajeev Singh, singer-actress Vasundhara Das in her first Bollywood film, and the 'baddest man' of them all, Gulshan Grover.\n\nAs if all the beauty queens weren't enough, the film also features Miss India 2002 Reshmi Ghosh in a 'special' role.\n\nVasundhara, playing Rajeev Singh's wife, is rightfully excited about her Hindi film debut, and feels that sensuality is not vulgar, if handled with sensitivity.\n\nOn being asked about the skin she bares in the film's promos, she says it's about being \"natural\" and about how a husband and wife behave in real life.\n\nThe film's contents have been kept strictly under wraps by the cast and crew, and all one can speculate from the images on display are that the film will be quite steamy. With all the eye-candy and sizzling scenes, the movie is attempting to work based on all the beautiful people involved.\n\nWhen asked about bold scenes in his film, director Ajeet Sinha told Indian Television, \"Cinema is just a reflection of society. We have programmes like Wild On on television. We have young girls dressed up in tank tops and jogging shorts walking in the streets. So what is wrong if the heroine of our films wears something similar?\""
