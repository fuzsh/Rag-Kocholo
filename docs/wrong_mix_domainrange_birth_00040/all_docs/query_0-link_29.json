        "text": "SARAH BRYAN is a folklorist from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. She directs the North Carolina Folklife Institute and edits the Old-Time Herald, a magazine about traditional string band music. The recipient of a 2020 literature fellowship from the North Carolina Arts Council, she is currently working on a collection of essays. She last wrote for the magazine about the music history of Kinston, North Carolina. ERIC CRAWFORD, director of the Joyner Institute for Gullah and African Diaspora Studies at Coastal Carolina University, holds a PhD in musicology from the Catholic University of America. In 2007, he began extensive field recordings on Saint Helena Island, and his transcriptions are held at the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. His most recent publication is At Low Tide: The Voices of Sandy Island. LAUREN…\n\nAt Hitsville U.S.A. recording sessions, when Motown Records producers would give James Jamerson, the studio’s in-house bassist, the charts for new songs, they provided him only the chord changes with no actual bass lines. No one could tell Jamerson how to play. No one could hear what he heard beneath a chord progression and melody. “They’d let me go on and ad lib. I created, man,” he told journalist Nelson George. “I picked things up from listening to people speak. From the intonation of their voices. I could capture a line. I look at people walking and get a beat from their movement. I’m telling you all my secrets now.” Jamerson died at just forty-five in 1983, and because Motown didn’t attribute the players on its sessions for years, his…\n\nThe Charleston band Ranky Tanky has described itself as “four Gullah descendants and one disciple.” It was the disciple, guitarist Clay Ross, who approached his longtime musician friends Quentin Baxter (drums), Kevin Hamilton (bass), and Charlton Singleton (trumpet) about forming a Gullah-inspired band with lead singer Quiana Parler in 2016. “When Clay approached us about Ranky Tanky, honestly the first thing I said was ‘Why would we go out and do Gullah?’” remembered Singleton in a recent interview with Garden & Gun. “I can go to church right now and hear folks singing those songs…. What I learned is that everybody can relate to it somehow.” Ranky Tanky released a self-titled debut album in 2017 and it quickly rose to the top of Billboard’s Jazz charts with their contemporary interpretations…\n\nIn 1989 in Charleston, a young man named Matt Jones, a tech whiz and DIY hip-hop producer who went by DJ Wizard, invited the neighborhood over to his mom’s house on Kracke Street to make a record. Jones and company put together six songs for an EP he called The Musical Prophesy, which he self-released under the banner Genius Productions. Of the three hundred copies he had pressed, precious few survive, with many of them lost to Hurricane Hugo, which devastated Charleston that year. For “Lowcountry for Old Heads” (page 50), Dave Tompkins caught up with Jones, who still lives in the city and still has one or two copies of his old masterpiece, as well as the customized vintage machines he used to make it. “A lot of things weren’t…\n\nIf I heard someone talking about Moon Pie between the late 1970s and early ’80s in upstate South Carolina, I knew that it wasn’t a reference to the wondrous confection hailing from Chattanooga. Nope, they would have been talking about the best goddamn rock & roll band ever that hadn’t yet made it to the big time. I came to know this quartet from my college buddy Michael Hunt—now a theater professor in Virginia—a man one year older than me in age and forty years older in music and literature experience. “Come with me to see the best goddamn rock band ever that hasn’t yet made it—Moon Pie,” he said to me. He knew these guys, who were a few years older, because they all went to the same high…\n\nIn 2014, singer-songwriters Sam Beam (better known by his folk nom de guerre Iron and Wine) and Ben Bridwell (leader of indie rock band Band of Horses) met up in Asheville to record an album of covers, calling it the jam session they never got to have back when they were growing up together in Columbia. “The process of picking the songs to cover was really reminiscent of more than fifteen years ago when we used to mail each other cassettes and CDs of music we were into,” Beam said. “And the end of every recording day found us cutting up with friends the way we used to when we’d cross paths in South Carolina.” Among their offerings is the beautiful “Ab’s Song” by Spartanburg’s rock & roll icons the…"
