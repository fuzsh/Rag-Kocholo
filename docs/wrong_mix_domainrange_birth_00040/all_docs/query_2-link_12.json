        "text": "You are guided by a fire burning within you. You rarely heed the warnings of reflection and reason; instead, you listen to your instincts, as if your unconscious were perpetually emerging. This is the source of your spontaneity and passion. Because you are continually being born, you champion all phenomena symbolic of birth: breaking ground, beginning, clearing. You have little interest for pursuing the new ideas you brought into being, because your inner flame is always urging you to move on quickly to the next innovation.\n\nYou are not a good manager. You are straightforward. When you commit yourself, you do so with mind, body, and soul. Restraint and moderation are concepts which are totally foreign to you, because you live by the fullness of your instinct, the force of your desire. Due to your energetic temperament, your determination immediately invents the action necessary to fulfill your desires. It goes without saying that your attitude engenders certain risks. Sometimes your impetuousness, or a lack of maturity or patience, or a keen appetite for experience leads you into a blind alley. But risk is a part of your life. Since your fervor is immune to calculation, second thoughts, and cunning, you have no fear. You are the type of hero whose courageous deeds are difficult to distinguish from acts of bravado or of sheer foolhardiness.\n\nYour top priority is to take action, immediately. Delay is torture to you. You are in a hurry to live, to take your urges and impulses to their ultimate conclusion, even though your lack of forethought may actually make your goal take longer to accomplish. You rarely evaluate obstacles objectively: instead, you dash into the fray, bristling with determination, oblivious to the size or scope of the difficulties. You ride home triumphantly, whether you have battered your head against a brick wall or met no resistance whatsoever. But you have a true hero’s courage and vitality. You are undaunted by challenges and real danger, to the surprise of outside observers. Like everyone, you sometimes experience failure. But you rarely despair or become overly discouraged by it; it never overcomes your. You don’t see it as a tragedy; you just figure you missed that time, but next time, you won’t. In fact, you’ll muster even more strength and power for the next attack, since you are convinced you can succeed.\n\nYou sometimes have problems finishing something you have started. Once the glamour of the initial urge and enthusiasm is dulled,\n\nEmmylou Harris finds her work rewarding. Daily life and routine activities are excellent sources of self-fulfillment for her.\n\nEmmylou Harris is attentive to work and profit. She will probably be financially comfortable throughout her life.\n\nAt the time of your birth, your rising sign was located in Cancer (the Crab), while the sun was passing through the sign of Aries (the Ram). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide your personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of your character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nSensitivity – Individualism – Imagination – Vitality and passion – Eccentricity – Pugnacity – Savings and thrift – Impatience – Impetuosity – Obstinacy – Enterprise – Premonition – Innovation.\n\nEmmylou Harris was born on the third day before the full moon in a gibbous moon configuration. This “soli-lunar” configuration gives her a rich and complex personality, although she sometimes struggles with the feeling that she is lacking something. Indeed, a feeling that she is lacking something may preoccupy her until she finds a spiritual or humanitarian cause worthy of her devotion. Devotion will be important to her as a foundation for her inner and outer development. If she fails to encounter a great and noble cause to which she is willing to pledge herself, she could always make do with a person whose aura and magnetism attract her. Whatever she decides, it is by working to serve a cause or another person that she will approach her own self-transformation.\n\nThis relationship could yield a high degree of psychological compatibility and powerful mutual attraction. Emmylou Harris’s personality will exert a magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of your partner.\n\nEmmylou Harris’s moon is located at 5° VIRGO. Her ideal match is a partner with the sun at 0/10° VIRGO or PISCES.\n\nEmmylou Harris would be particularly well-matched to someone who mirrors her underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal she cherishes of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with her ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the Moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nEmmylou Harris’s Venus is located at 3° PISCES. Her ideal match is a partner with Mars at 0/10° PISCES or VIRGO.\n\nThis type of partner would reflect and fulfill your ideal of sensuality to the greatest degree. Moreover, your ideal partner would resonate lastingly with your own psychic projections of your ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual yearnings of both partners would be likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nEmmylou Harris is sentimentally romantic. Her sensitivity is so powerful that it can be cloying. In love, she yields completely; she enjoys merging with the person she loves. Although it is not easy for her to express the depth of her loving feelings, she displays them through her limitless devotion and generosity. This type of partner, endowed with great psychic sensitivity, would be an especially good match for her. They would share a taste for mystery and secrecy, keen artistic and musical pleasures, a fertile imagination, and spiritual aspirations.\n\nMars is located at 22° PISCES. Your ideal match is someone with Venus at 16° PISCES or VIRGO."
