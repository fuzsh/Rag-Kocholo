        "text": "My marvelously unique mother, Bettie Lee Grbavace, was the daughter of two immigrants from Eastern Europe. Her mother, Stella Ruth Piva, committed suicide when Mama was a very young girl. Bettie Lee suffered a brutal upbringing during the severe economic slump of the 30s, with her father, Mijo Grbavace, who kept a shabby “roof over her head” but not much else in terms of food and clothing.\n\nAs a boy, Mijo, my grandfather, stowed away on a ship sailing to from Yugoslavia to America because he mistakenly believed he had killed his brother by way of a blow to the head with a shovel but in reality had only knocked him unconscious. After working for a while in a bicycle shop in New York City he returned to Yugoslavia and came back into the United States legally at seventeen. He was a master tinkerer and made his way to California, where he became an auto mechanic. He spoke seven languages and became one of the first people to make the journey from the west coast to Texas in an automobile. He and Mama’s short-lived new stepmother, Gladys, settled on what later became “the family farm” in Sunset, Texas, just north of Fort Worth. I sort of knew Mijo when I was a kid. He made moonshine, even after prohibition, as his drink of choice, ate dried armadillo meat, and was bent towards paranoia and delusions of grandeur. Not knowing he was probably dangerous, I observed him with an innocent curiosity and liked the way he called me “Lily Monkey” in his weird almost Italian-sounding accent. I can’t say I loved him and don’t recall ever sitting in his lap or such things one usually does with a grandfather. I had once survived an extremely frightening ride in the cab of his pickup truck across a plowed field on the way to “run a trap” one afternoon, so I was not terribly shocked when he died in a fatal head on collision . . . on Father’s Day. So, understandably, we were not allowed to ask about my mother’s girlhood either.\n\nI marvel that my parents could be so loving and good to me, given the unspeakable traumas of their upbringings. They were, of course, not at all like the “ideal” parents my friends had, but they owned extraordinary strength and resilience and were true believers in life itself, and I feel blessed to have been their girl and to have inherited the courage and dumb blind faith one needs to be an artist. Relatively, normal life seems abnormal. I was allowed more freedom to run absurdly wild than any of my friends, and I never had to eat anything I didn’t want to, like squash and spinach. I could walk as far away from home as I wanted, by myself and barefoot, as long as I was back by dark. Later, when I questioned my mother about how she could possibly know how to be such a good parent, she always said she knew exactly what kind of mother she wished she’d had so it was easy. She would stay up all night sewing a dress for me to wear to school the next day and then head to work having had little or no sleep. She never ever,—ever— let us down. She bailed Daddy and brother Mike out of trouble many times. She was our angel.\n\nOne Christmas when times were tough and Daddy was enjoying the holiday “spirits” so much that he forgot to come home for a couple of weeks, Mama showed extraordinary faith by wrapping rocks in the boxes under the tree because we liked to shake our presents and try to guess what was inside. Just before Christmas when the money (and my Dad) arrived just in the nick of time, she unwrapped them on the sly and inserted gifts but forgot and left a rock in one of mine. When I opened it on Christmas morning the rock rolled across the floor.\n\nI looked up at my parents, puzzled. Daddy improvised, “Oh that’s a magic rock so you can wish for anything you want.” That moment has become a shrine by the wayside in my memory. Our existence depended on an undying belief in things we couldn’t see. I still believe that you can have what you want in life if you keep the faith until somehow you reach what you envision.\n\nWhen I was a girl, my mother, the bedrock of my reality, would take a yearly trip to Dallas for a three-week Bell Telephone Company training seminar. A disturbing insecurity crept into my young soul as we steered down the windblown stretch to the Lubbock Municipal Airport. As I rode quietly in the backseat beside my brother I gamed a means to distraction by turning my head in sync to row after row after row of cotton plants discovering that if perfectly timed you could see straight down each line. Once we’d reached the tiny airfield I clung to the chain-link fence watching Mama’s thick but shapely legs in patent noir stilettos click down the tarmac and mount the stairs to disappear into the hull of a screaming silver plane. She was so beautiful, clothed in her excitement, impeccably fitted business suit, jet black curly hair, red lips, sexy silk stockings, and never quite voguish but well organized purse. I loved my mother so very much.\n\nBack in the car her scent still filled the air though the world seemed to have taken on an entirely different atmosphere, one of danger and intrigue. My father’s anima was suddenly on holiday, signaled by a loosened necktie and a dreamy face with a Lucky Strike dangling from the corner of his lips. Riding shotgun in the front seat I watched with a slightly raised brow as he switched on the radio, allowing a 60s country croon to enter the smoky air. We arrived back to a home now void of a chaperone. Mama had instructed me to be the woman of the house while she was away. At six years of age I had no idea how to “be a woman” but I was working on it in the back of my mind, determined to stand and deliver, once I had it wired. Hamburgers and French fries were eaten, and I cleared the greasy bags responsibly. Then unexpectedly, Daddy, the sole heir to my safekeeping kissed me on the forehead and left.\n\nMy memory skips past most of however brother Mike and I must have filled the evening hours and zooms to one magical moment that usually happened around 3:00 a.m. all of the nights until the relief of Mama’s return. Mike would eventually put himself to bed in our shared room in the back of the house, but I was frightened, so I left the too vividly bright ceiling light burning and took to my hiding place between my parents’ bed and the wall to stare facing the fan-shaped window of the exterior door to await Daddy’s safe return from the honky-tonk on the edge of town. Lubbock had synchronized trains that rocked through, whistling the passing of each hour, so if you kept track you would know the time. It was a sound for which there is no good word, so much deeper and more lucid than “so lonesome I could cry.” I kept count, understanding nothing of bar time, of course, but some internal clock trained me to know when it was okay to surrender to a dizzy, knowing that Daddy would soon be home. Sitting in silence, listening as the night trains passed, wonderfully alive, autonomous and almost painfully self-aware, I witnessed my own ageless mystery to the ticking by of the stars outside the glass. I hummed and thought and hummed and watched the white door and came to know my heart as I slipped through the mystical space between wake and sleep.\n\nIn what eventually turned out to be forty-three years of faithful service to the company, Mama received a grandfather clock as a reward of perfect attendance, which still stands beside my front door, testifying to the uncanny fact that she was never once late and never missed a single day of work.\n\nHeaven Too\n\nlyrics by Kimmie Rhodes\n\nAll the garden needed was the sweetness of the air\n\nAnd the little barefoot , brown-skinned girl with the black and curly hair,\n\nwho played among the flowers on a summer’s afternoon.\n\nAll of this and heaven too.\n\nA garden made of dreams is given you.\n\nAll of this and heaven too.\n\nDays are pebbles tossed into a pond of years .\n\nSo fast, they they ripple into memories and 30 summers passed.\n\nWhen friends around the birthday cake would laugh and ask her age,\n\nThis is all the black-haired girl would say,\n\nA prayer is just a wish that’s given you.\n\nAll of this and heaven too.\n\n60 summers passed and still the roses smell as sweet\n\nAnd the coolness of the earth .still feels the same beneath her feet.\n\nThe child inside remembers why they put the roses there\n\nAnd the sun still looks as pretty shining on her hair.\n\nA garden made of days is given you.\n\nAll of this and heaven too.\n\nWe get all of this and heaven too.\n\nRADIO DREAMS PROMOTIONAL TOUR\n\nSPRING 2018\n\nA fascinating, intimate and spontaneous evening of stories and songs with legendary singer/songwriter Kimmie Rhodes (accompanied by multi-instrumentalist Gabriel Rhodes with special guest Robert Vincent) in conversation with broadcasters, BBC Radio 2 Bob Harris OBE, BBC Ulster Ralph McLean and RTE Dublin Sandy Harsh, reflecting on Kimmie’s rich musical history, the sounds of Austin and the legacy of Texan songwriting.\n\nhttps://kimmierhodes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/01-1.-Radio-Dreams-Full-Song.mp3\n\nRadio Dreams by Kimmie Rhodes & Gary Nicholson – get a free download here when you join the email list > https://kimmierhodes.com\n\nTo purchase the book click here > https://kimmierhodes.com/books/\n\nBRITAIN\n\nCountry cousins: ‘Whispering’ Bob Harris hits the road with Kimmie Rhodes – 20th April, 2018\n\nTim Hughes @OxMailTimHughesFeatures and Music Editor\n\nThere’s a good reason Bob Harris is known to his fans as ‘Whispering Bob’. His voice is delightfully mellifluous – velvet coated, soothing and engaging.\n\nWhether he is regaling you with an anecdote about his wild rock & roll years – when he partied with John Lennon, Bob Marley and David Bowie – or sharing a tip about a new artist you really ought to listen to, he does so with a lilting, almost hypnotic tone – and you can’t help but hang on every word.\n\nThe face – and voice – of The Old Grey Whistle Test, he pioneered serious music broadcasting in the 1970s. Now aged 73 – he has just celebrated his birthday – he is championing country music.\n\nThe darling of Nashville and Austin, he is successfully introducing a new generation of US country stars to the British, and vice versa, and helping the genre become the phenomenon it has become.\n\nHe spends his time zig-zagging between his home in Steventon, near Abingdon – where he records his hugely popular Bob Harris Country show for BBC 2 – and the United States. In recent months he has recorded from former Fairport Convention guitarist Richard Thompson’s home in Malibu, Judith Owen’s house in New Orleans and Beth Nielsen Chapman’s place in Nashville.\n\nThis week, Bob changes things around by inviting over to his place one of country music’s biggest stars – Kimmie Rhodes.\n\nThe pair’s Radio Dreams show will give us a chance to hear the broadcasting legend in conversation with Kimmie, sharing stories about her life and career, and that of her late husband and soul mate, US radio personality Joe Gracey Jr. It will also see her playing some of her own tunes live.\n\nThey will be joined by one of Bob’s current hotly-tipped artists, Robert Vincent.\n\nThe tour starts tomorrow at Bush Hall, London, moving on to The Stables in Milton Keynes on Sunday and The Cornerstone, Didcot – a guitar pick’s throw from his home – on Tuesday.\n\n“It’s going to be fabulous,” he says.\n\n“We thought that if Kimmie was going to come here and do a few gigs, it would also be nice for me to be there to chat to her. It’s a format that works at The Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. It will be a gentle evening of music and reminiscences.”\n\nHe will be joined by his wife Trudie, son Miles, and trusty assistant producer – and The Oxford Times photographer – Marc West, who help run his Whispering Bob Broadcasting Company (WBBC) from Bob’s Under the Apple Tree studio – appropriately situated in the middle of an orchard in his garden.\n\nOne of the greats of country, Kimmie’s contribution to music cannot be overstated.\n\nRaised in Lubbock, Texas – the hometown of Buddy Holly – she has recorded 16 albums, contributed to a string of film soundtracks and had her songs covered by Willie Nelson, Wynonna Judd, Trisha Yearwood, Waylon Jennings, Peter Frampton, Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris.\n\nThe platinum-selling songwriter will share tales of her and Joe’s three decades together. It’s a story of triumph and tragedy, ending in Joe losing a hard fought battle with cancer.\n\n“Radio Dreams is the result of a collaboration between Kimmie and Joe, who was a hugely important figure in the emergence of the country scene in Austin in the 70s,” says Bob. “He sort of did what I do – playing what he liked and discovering new artists. And he touched a chord.\n\n“Sadly he got cancer and lost his tongue, which took away the very thing that made him famous, so he moved into production.\n\n“Radio Dreams is the story of all of this and the acknowledgement of an incredible legacy.”\n\nBob, who himself fought off prostate cancer, has recorded a companion audio documentary and retrospective CD with Kimmie.\n\nThe project follows a fruitful period for Bob, which saw him once again at the helm of The Old Grey Whistle Test for a one-off show to mark the 30th anniversary of its final broadcast.\n\n“It was such a dream to do it,” says Bob. “The look of the show was the same as when we started out – and there was so much love in the room.\n\n“It made a huge impact. It saw one of BBC4’s biggest audiences ever, with well over a million people watching it, and it showed how much love there is for the programme.\n\n“It was quite moving.”\n\nIt also shows the popular presenter at the top of his game.\n\nHe adds: “You are always going to have ups and downs but there are so many wonderful moments, and I am keeping fit, walking five miles a day around the village. That’s the reason I’ve got so much energy to sustain all this.\n\n“WBBC has become a real energetic force. Miles is doing really well, Trudie puts so much energy into it and Marc is also an important part of things. Between us we have created this amazing thing.”\n\nAnd broadcasting remains a passion. “I love doing it,” he says. “I love getting the CDs every morning, going to the studio, finding out about new albums and putting on a show.\n\n“Country music is so vibrant right now – and it’s great to be a part of that.”\n\nLeft to Right – Bob Harris, Kimmie Rhodes, Gabriel Rhodes, Robert Vincent, Miles Myerscough-Harris\n\nIRELAND\n\nCQAF in Association with Frontier Music Club Present Kimmie Rhodes: Radio Dreams\n\nCQAF in Association with Frontier Music Club Present Kimmie Rhodes: Radio Dreams\n\nIn conversation with BBC Radio Ulster’s Ralph McLean\n\nWATERFRONT STUDIO, BELFAST: Saturday 05 May\n\nKimmie Rhodes & Ralph McLean of BBC Radio Ulster backstage at The Belfast Waterfront Studio\n\nA fascinating, intimate and spontaneous evening of stories and songs with legendary singer and songwriter Kimmie Rhodes – accompanied by guitarist Gabriel Rhodes.\n\nTo celebrate of the release of Radio Dreams and the Companion audio documentary – produced by Bob Harris OBE – BBC Radio 2 – this very special ‘In conversation with’ BBC Radio Ulster broadcaster Ralph McLean will reflect on Kimmie’s rich musical history, the sounds of Austin and the legacy of Texas songwriting.\n\nRadio Dreams is a dual memoir which invites readers into the unique and private world of platinum-selling songwriter and recording artist Kimmie Rhodes and her deceased soul mate, beloved radio personality Joe Gracey, Jr.\n\nWeaving her own poetic prose with wry and witty words from his journals, Rhodes returns him to the conversation to tell the fascinating story of their three decades together.\n\nHer trippy songwriter’s tales and his hilarious and poignant writings will take you on a time-machine adventure from Saturday mornings spent watching country-and-western stars on TV to the wild ‘70s era in which the hippies, weary from protesting the raging Vietnam War, joined the rednecks to kick back and play some music in the “Groover’s Paradise” of Austin, Texas.\n\nRiding with fellow outlaws Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Cowboy Jack Clement, Emmylou Harris, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Doug Sahm and other famous—and infamous—characters, they help turn Austin into a scene and outlaw country into a sound before facing Gracey’s final cancer battle.\n\nThrough triumph and tragedy, grief and gratitude, their story speaks of the extraordinary life and inspiring love they shared.\n\nFor fans of Texas songwriting and outlaw country music scene this is one story that has to be heard!\n\nArts Q&A: Kimmie Rhodes on Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson and the power of love\n\nJenny Lee puts performers and artists on the spot about what really matters to them. This week, Texan singer-songwriter Kimmie Rhodes\n\n1. When did you think about a career in music and what were your first steps into it?\n\nFate landed me in the studio of Joe Gracey in Austin, December 1979. I had a handful of songs I had just written and decided I’d like to try to make a record. It was the luckiest day of my life. It opened a whole new world to me as an artist and little did I know that Joe Gracey would become the love of my life.\n\n2. Best gigs you’ve been to?\n\nMost recently my kids treated me to Brian Wilson and Pet Sounds at Austin City Limits Music Festival, for Mother’s Day, and it was fantastic. I saw the next-to-last show that the famous Texas Playboys did in San Marcos, Texas, in the late 80s. We opened the show and then I sat on the stairs to the stage and just soaked it all in. Another favourite memory of mine, in terms of my own shows, was playing with Willie Nelson and legendary fiddler Johnny Gimble in Indianapolis for 80,000 people at a Farm Aid concert.\n\n3. Fantasy wedding/birthday party band?\n\nRay Benson and Asleep at The Wheel or Delbert McClinton. You pick.\n\n4. The record you’d take to a desert island?\n\nIf we were talking singles I’d have to say Bob Dylan’s Like A Rolling Stone. It’s my favourite record of all time because it’s everything a recording should be… live, spontaneous and incredibly musical. If we’re talking albums I’d take a compilation of my own songs so I could reminisce about the fun I’ve had recording through the years and think of all the great musicians I’ve known and worked with and all the wonderful songwriters I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating with.\n\n5. And the book?\n\nThe Five Things We Cannot Change: And the Happiness We Find by Embracing Them. It would be the best book to read about accepting what we can’t change and therefore I might be able to not go crazy from the isolation.\n\n6. Top three films?\n\nThe Blues Brothers, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Red Headed Stranger – all for the music.\n\n7. Worst film you’ve seen?\n\nTornado. I went to see it to escape a drought in Texas in July. It was great to be in the dark and watch it rain and hear lightening and thunder for a couple of hours, but the script was just horrible. It was so stupid I wished I could have watched it with the dialogue tracks muted.\n\n8. Favourite authors?\n\nAlan Lightman, Carl Jung and Shakespeare.\n\n9. Sport you most enjoy and top team?\n\nI like baseball and don’t care which team long as it’s live, and I used to like to go to University of Texas football games with Joe Gracey.\n\n10. Ideal holiday destination?\n\nParis or New York City at Christmas or Venice for New Year’s.\n\n11. Pet hate?\n\nPolitics.\n\n12. What’s your favourite:\n\nDinner – Gumbo without okra.\n\nDessert – Crème brulee.\n\nDrink – French Rose wine with lots of ice.\n\n13. Who is your best friend and how do you know each other?\n\nMy mother, because she loves me so much.\n\n14. Is there a God?\n\nIf God is love, then I believe in God. If God is not love, then I believe in love. Many good and bad things have been done on this Earth in the name of God, but love never fails.\n\nThe Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival, in association with frontier music club present Kimmie Rhodes: Radio Dreams in conversation with BBC Radio Ulster presenter and Irish News columnist Ralph McLean at Belfast’s Waterfront Studio on Saturday May 5. Tickets from Waterfront.co.uk\n\nBELFAST\n\nWhat an adventure! I just spent last week in my hometown Lubbock, Texas with some really great people getting a LOT of good work done on the Radio Dreams Project, working in the Crossroads of Texas Music archives department at Texas Tech, helping hand over many pictures, recordings, writings, memorabilia, costumes, original scripts and drawings from theatre productions. I also visited and lectured a 20th Century Music, Texas Music Race Class and Gender, Women’s Studies and songwriting class.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights of the week was “Women and West Texas Music” a Lubbock community event, hosted by Dr. Curtis Peoples, at the International Cultural Center featuring a panel discussion and some music… Guests: Kimmie Rhodes (Musician, playwright, and author), Amy Maner (Producer, designer, and Lubbock Lights documentarian), Kathleen Hudson (Educator, and author of “Women in Texas Music” and “Telling Stories, Writing Songs: An Album of Texas Songwriters”), Tamara Saviano (Grammy Award winner, Guy Clark biographer, and manager for Kris Kristofferson’s record label, among other things) and Diana Finlay Hendricks (Delbert McClinton biographer, educator, writer.) It was a real honor to share the stage with such talented writers and producers. The first session was a 45 minute on stage discussion about my new book “Radio Dreams,” which included some songs. The second session was all women on stage discussing their careers and ties to West Texas music. For more information contact Curtis Peoples 806-834-5777, [email protected]\n\nAs an ambassador for The Buddy Holly Educational Foundation http://www.tbhef.org I performed and told stories at a book signing event hosted by The Buddy Holly Center. https://www.mylubbock.us/departmental-websites/departments/buddy-holly-center/home\n\nThanks to all of you who made this possible by supporting the Radio Dreams Project! Below are some pictures taken of the work and events.\n\nStay tuned for the next phase… The Country Music Hall of Fame Museum comes to our home in Austin to pick up all the tapes and many other precious things we are donating to the museum in anticipation of the “Outlaws and Armadillos: County’s Roaring 70’s” exhibit that opens May 25 and runs through February 14, 2021.

His dedication and passion for preserving and recording the history is an inspiration. I’m very grateful for his interest and his help placing these archives in a permanent place where they can be used for education and research. Curtis not only booked all the events for the adventure and arranged scheduling but also escorted me to all of the classes I visited and lectured during the week.\n\nJohn Holmes, Kimmie Rhodes & Curtis Peoples in the archives department.\n\nJournals and lyrics dated and labeled and filed in acid free materials ready for processing and cataloguing.\n\nThanks to the good folks at The Buddy Holly Center for hosting a successful book signing for “Radio Dreams” that included a tour, performance and storytelling. I also had a chance to discuss my treasure I have placed there on loan for the next few years… my autographed lyric sheet from the day Waylon Jennings and I wrote our song “Lines” and sing the song. Here’s what it looks like below…\n\nKimmie Rhodes and Diana Finlay Hendricks at The Walk of Fame in Lubbock, Texas\n\nTelling the story of Radio Dreams and how the book and project began at the Women and West Texas Music event.
