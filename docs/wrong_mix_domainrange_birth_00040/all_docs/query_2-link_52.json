        "text": "Welcome to the first edition of Slayed by Voices …\n\nSong: “Red Dirt Girl”\n\nArtist: Emmylou Harris\n\nYear: 2000\n\nAlbum: Red Dirt Girl\n\nWriter: Emmylou Harris\n\nProducer: Malcolm Burn\n\nFor the past two years, Emmylou Harris has been my muse.\n\nI fell late, but I fell hard. My awareness of her does go back a ways, and two combo efforts in particular stood out — her “This Is Us” (no relation to the TV show) duet with Mark Knopfler, and “After the Gold Rush” with her longtime pals and collaborators Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt.\n\nIn the fall of 2019 came Ken Burns’ Country Music documentary for PBS, and though I wasn’t any kind of serious country music fan, I watched all of it. (I guess as far as Burns and PBS are concerned, mission accomplished.) In the immediate aftermath, I dug into several of the artists who passed through my television. Far more than anyone else, Harris embedded herself within me. And as I worked on my novel, she inspired me.\n\nShe has a song for every occasion, every emotion. Not every one of them is for me — even after this recent baptism, I’m not able to get completely countrified — but so many are so evocative and so moving. In fast order, I built a playlist of nearly 100 of her songs. I truly could not stop listening to her, as you can see this little piece of news from Spotify at the end of 2020 …\n\nI could have chosen so many other songs of hers to showcase here. If you want to go down a rabbit hole, for starters check out “Boy From Tupelo,” “My Antonia,” “Bang the Drum Slowly,” “Not Enough,” “Strong Hand,” “My Songbird,” “Prayer in Open D,” “Michelangelo” or “Timberline.” She has done outstanding covers of Bob Dylan’s “Every Grain of Sand,” Townes Van Zandt’s “If I Needed You” and Bruce Springsteen’s “Tougher Than the Rest” and “Racing in the Street.” (Her version of “Born to Run,” by contrast, is not Springsteen.)\n\nBut for the launch of Slayed by Voices, it had to be “Red Dirt Girl,” the song that sealed the Emmylou Harris deal for me. I think it’s absolutely exquisite.\n\nLet’s dig in …\n\nMe and my best friend Lillian\n\nAnd her bluetick hound dog Gideon\n\nSittin' on the front porch, coolin' in the shade\n\nSingin' every song the radio played\n\nWaitin' for the Alabama sun to go down\n\nTwo red dirt girls in a red dirt town\n\nMe and Lillian\n\nJust across the line\n\nAnd a little southeast of Meridian\n\nKicking things off, Harris sketches an incredibly vivid and lively opening illustration in nine lines. The dog, the porch, the shade, the radio (the two friends were slayed by voices, just like me), the Alabama sunset and most of all, the red dirt, which you’ll find Harris wields for different purposes throughout the song like a Swiss Army knife.\n\nRed dirt, in case you don’t know, is really a thing in Alabama.\n\nThe red color is due to oxidized iron. The clay itself is the product of the weathering of volcanic rocks. Water reacts with feldspar in granite, and one of the products is clay. … Sometimes soil can be so filled with iron oxide that it coats other minerals in the soil and causes it all to look red. The bedrock below the surface is an iron-rich clay, making their dirt very red.\n\nI also love the structure of “Red Dirt Girl,” including how Harris links the stanza-ending half-rhymes of Lillian and Meridian. In particular, the way Harris will make use throughout the song of Meridian, which is where the story doesn’t take place, is a marvel.\n\nShe loved her brother\n\nI remember back when\n\nHe was fixin' up a '49 Indian\n\nHe told her, “Little sister, gonna ride the wind\n\nUp around the moon and back again”\n\nHe never got farther than Vietnam\n\nI was standin' there with her\n\nWhen the telegram come\n\nFor Lillian\n\nNow he's lyin' somewhere\n\nAbout a million miles from Meridian\n\nIt doesn’t hurt that the Vietnam-era lines evoke one of the most near-and-dear episodes of television that I have ever watched, the pilot of The Wonder Years. “Red Dirt Girl” reminds us not only of the personal cost of war, but also the long-term effects of its horror. The love from older brother to younger sister is beautiful, but the journey from fantasy to reality is all too real.\n\nBut Lillian doesn’t give up hope. Instead, she’s determined.\n\nShe said, “There's not much hope for a red dirt girl\n\nSomewhere out there is a great big world\n\nThat's where I'm bound\n\nAnd the stars might fall on Alabama\n\nBut one of these days I'm gonna swing\n\nMy hammer down\n\nAway from this red dirt town\n\nI'm gonna make a joyful sound”\n\nSo here’s the thing, and part of both the inspiration for Slayed by Voices and maybe the challenge I have in executing it. The words “joyful sound” truly resonate with me — really, not just with me, but within me. And yet, I’m not sure I convey that without you hearing that within the song itself. So what am I really doing here, except calling them out? And yet … I feel they need to be called out.\n\nIt’s all the more tragic how quickly that dream of the joyful sound dies.\n\nShe grew up tall and she grew up thin\n\nBuried that old dog Gideon\n\nBy a crepe myrtle bush in the back of the yard\n\nHer daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard\n\nGot in trouble with a boy from town\n\nFigured that she might as well settle down\n\nSo she dug right in\n\nAcross a red dirt line\n\nJust a little south east of Meridian\n\nI guess the passing of Gideon was inevitable, but it doesn’t make it any less sad, underscored by the evocative burial spot. But there are two more words in this verse that burrow their way into me: Her mama “leaned hard.” It’s so unspecific, yet you can feel the pressure on Lillian as if she were a once-supple branch fighting for her life through a storm.\n\nIn the very next line, when Lillian gets pregnant, her drive and ambition are already gone. That she “dug right in” illustrates her toughness, but at this point, we’re just hoping she isn’t damaged beyond repair.\n\nYes, she tried hard to love him\n\nBut it never did take\n\nJust another way for the heart to break\n\nSo she learned to bend\n\nLillian is losing count of all the ways she’s heartbroken. There’s a certain resignation — a hint of peace, maybe — but that’s only a tiny breath before this brutal truth.\n\nOne thing they don't tell you about the blues\n\nWhen you got 'em\n\nYou keep on fallin'\n\n'Cause there ain't no bottom\n\nThere ain't no end\n\nAt least not for Lillian\n\nHow many of us have felt that about the blues?\n\nIt’s devastating.\n\nAnd the end is near — too near.\n\nNobody knows when she started her skid\n\nShe was only 27 and she had five kids\n\nCould-a been the whiskey, could-a been the pills\n\nCould-a been the dream she was tryin' to kill\n\nLillian isn’t idly drinking to avoid the blues. It’s an active act, with motive and execution.\n\nThe dream is fighting for its life, but it can’t win.\n\nBut there won't be a mention in the News of the World\n\nAbout the life and the death of a red dirt girl\n\nNamed Lillian\n\nWho never got any farther\n\nAcross the line than Meridian\n\nHarris makes the sad case that Lillian, at the time of her death, is disposable.\n\nThe world simply spins on without her.\n\nNow the stars still fall on Alabama\n\nTonight she finally laid that hammer down\n\nWithout a sound\n\nIn the red dirt ground\n\nThe power of the single word “sound,” no longer joyful, embodyies the journey from innocent aspiration to gutted desolation. I find it extraordinary the way that Harris spins the life story of her protagonist in those four minutes.\n\nHere’s Harris’ take on the song, from an interview with The Guardian.\n\nAlthough the red-dirt girl herself is a fictional composite, Harris sees much of herself in the story. “To me, there were always two red-dirt girls,” she says of the narrator and protagonist, Lillian, who kills herself in the end. “I could have just as easily been the other one who made some decisions and took their life down a road that wasn’t nearly as good a path as that other person. It doesn’t mean I’m better than that person. I was lucky.”\n\nPerhaps more of a surprise would be the influence of the movie Boys Don’t Cry, as told to American Songwriter.\n\n\"I had driven to New Orleans with my dog Bonaparte and I passed the sign for Meridian, and I started making rhymes in my head. So I had this rhyme scheme but I didn't know what it was about. You get crushes on words and then the rhymes come. Anyways, right after I got there, I went to see the movie Boys Don't Cry. This story about the lost lives of these young people with nowhere to go and it turns into such negative things …\"\n\nEmmylou Harris - “Red Dirt Girl” (Live at Farm Aid 2005)\n\nI haven’t talked about the music. It’s inadequate to say that it’s beautiful and poignant, at once stark and melodic. A few different versions of it are floating around — I’m not fortunate enough to have seen Harris live, but apparently it remains a concert staple to this day. In any performance, the music is a real showcase for Harris’ voice, beginning country blunt, rising with her endearing croak to something angelic.\n\nFor me, it’s a song that’s impossible not to love, and for me, this is the perfect song and artist to kick off what I hope will be an interesting if not inspiring series.\n\nLeave a comment\n\nShare"
