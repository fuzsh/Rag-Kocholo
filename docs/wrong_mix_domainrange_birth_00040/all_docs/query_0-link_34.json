Boomers have embodied many trends, from the sexual revolution to rising women’s workforce participation to changes in intergenerational relationships. While unique for its sheer size, the cohort is also unique for its trajectory. The Baby Boomers came of age during a period of great technological and social innovation. With important implications for family life, their aging is a testing ground for theories of cohort and generation, and it underscores the importance of research on the older population and later life. To review facts well known to sociologists, the Baby Boomers were born between 1946 and 1964. Their defining feature is the cohort’s size. Much to the surprise of demographers accustomed to the low fertility of the 1930s, the U.S. birth rate remained high for nearly 20 years before it fell to the low levels we know today” (Treas and Marcum 2011:132).\n\nRelated Video\n\nAdditional Information\n\nAging and Social Gerontology Resources – Books, Journals, and Helpful Links\n\nFamily and Kinship Resources – Books, Journals, and Helpful Links\n\nWord origin of “baby boomer” – Online Etymology Dictionary: etymonline.com\n\nBonvalet, Catherine, Céline Clément, and Jim Ogg. 2013. “Baby Boomers and their Entourage.” International Review of Sociology23(1):123–40. doi:10.1080/03906701.2013.771054.\n\nCornman, John M., and Eric R.
