It is a word that takes genesis in our universe inspired by the folklore(s) of North-East India. This story speaks of a world where the relation of the people to the fish is very different than ours. In that world, a fish is the soul of a person. If we are to look for the meaning of the word Panixiya, it will mean those people who stitch water into homes. In this story, we witness the struggle of a soul as it slips away from its familiar realms.\n\n“Freedom” by Jordan Hart\n\nDirector: Michael Joseph McDonald & Joe Bluhm • Canada • 5:32\n\nAs the first animated film to star a character with Down syndrome, “Freedom” is the coming-of-age story of Jon, a boy who learns to navigate the world with a loving mother, an absent father, a classroom bully, and a life-long crush. The animated short doubles as the song’s music video.\n\nSHORTS: Music Videos – Mississippi\n\nSaturday, March 26, 2022 7:30 pm\n\nMalco: Tito’s Handmade Vodka Auditorium\n\nOxford Film Festival is known for having the ultimate showing of music videos with a Mississippi connection.
