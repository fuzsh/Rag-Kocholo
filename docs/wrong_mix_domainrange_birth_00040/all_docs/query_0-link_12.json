        "text": "I grew up in Southern California and I absorbed everything that was on the radio and in the air in the ‘60s: Buffalo Springfield and The Beatles, Joni Mitchell and Jefferson Airplane – and then The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers. I loved country music when I was a little kid. But then, as a pre-teen and teen, that was my parent’s music. Yes, Patsy Cline was phenomenal; Merle Haggard, “Silver Wings” – one of the greatest songs ever written; Dad’s “Ballads of the True West” and “Hey, Porter” – love it. But let’s just put it over here. I’m going to go with Buffalo Springfield for the moment.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Rosanne went on the road with her dad. It was from that experience – and listening to Emmylou Harris – that she felt a calling to return to country. She began writing songs and recorded her first self-titled album, mostly produced in Germany; it impressed Columbia Records’ Rick Blackburn enough that he offered her a contract.\n\nIn the decade that followed, Cash would release six critically and commercially successful albums with Columbia, produced by her then-husband Rodney Crowell, including eleven No. 1 Billboard country singles. Her album, King’s Record Shop, spawned four No. 1s – a record for female country artists at the time – and Rosanne was heralded as a leader in the “young country” movement. But she did not feel fulfilled, creatively.\n\nHer next album, Interiors, filled with her own songs, was not promoted by her label. She left Columbia Records, moved to New York City, began writing all her songs, and, she remembers, “I didn’t have any more hits – but I was happy.”\n\nSince then, her work has been focused on a return to the roots of country and a reflection of her life experiences. In 2010, her LP The List – based on a list of iconic country songs her father had given her when she was 18 – received the Americana Award for Album of the Year. The River and the Thread (2014), a collection of songs inspired by the American South written with her husband and collaborator John Leventhal, won three GRAMMY Awards, Best Americana Album and Best American Roots Song and Best American Roots Performance for “A Feather’s Not a Bird.” In 2018, Cash released She Remembers Everything, with songs that tell of how love and loss, unfulfilled dreams, and small victories shape our lives and make us who we are. “I could not have written them 10 years ago,” Rosanne says. “Time is shorter. I have more to say.”\n\nCash is also a talented essayist and author and has written articles for The New York Times, Rolling Stone, the Nation, and the Oxford-American. The Chicago Tribune called her best-selling memoir, Composed, “one of the best accounts of an American life you’ll likely ever read.”\n\nRosanne Cash was awarded the SAG/AFTRA Lifetime Achievement Award for Sound Recordings in 2012 and received the 2014 Smithsonian Ingenuity Award in the Performing Arts. She was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters’ Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nBorn: May 24, 1955, Memphis, Tennessee"
