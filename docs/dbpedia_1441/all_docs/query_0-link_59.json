        "text": "A lively history of Colby College from its founding in 1813 to the present day. Download this book: http://digitalcommons.colby.edu/colbiana_books/7/ Using anecdotes and biographical asides to humanize this history, Earl H. Smith describes Colby's shift from a religious focus to secularism, from \"coordination\" to coeducation, and from provincialism to global notice. Smith tracks the growth of an ever-stronger faculty who were willing to make innovative changes in the curriculum and of trustees who dared to revolutionize student life by shedding outdated traditions. He brings to life the voices of students during the 1960s and 1970s, eager to change the old rules, protest an unpopular war, and demand equality and social justice on campus and worldwide. And perhaps most important of all, Smith illustrates how Colby College slowly reversed its role from the protected to the protector of the city that saved it."
