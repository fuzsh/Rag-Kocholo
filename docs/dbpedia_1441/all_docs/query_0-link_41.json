In the view of Dr. Sprague the present monetary policy of the Government \"threatens a complete breakdown of the credit of the Government.\" \"The Recovery program,\" he stated, \"involves expenditures far in excess of current rev¬ enues,\" and he adds: \"Certainly as much as two billions of dollars must be borrowed during the remainder of the fiscal year.\" The effect on Government bonds of the Adminis¬ tration's policy was pointed out by Dr. Sprague, who noted that \"already many issues of Government securities have dropped below par, including the issue that was brought out in October.\" The belief was expressed by Dr. Sprague that the President was faced \"with the alternative either of giving up tbe present policy or of the meeting of Government ex¬ penditures with additional paper money.\" In concluding his letter of resignation, Dr. Sprague said: as position for many weeks hoping against hope prevail. a I have now reached the conclusion that drift into unrestrained inflation other than an It is for the purpose of contributing organized public opinion.

Mr. Warburg made the further statement that \"I believe that the announced intention to arrest depreciation and to bring about a revaluation in terms of gold of all currencies now off gold will prove more of a stimulus to business revival than any amount pf planned regulation and control.\" He expressed it as his further conviction \"that the soundest monetary policy can be rendered void by a fiscal policy which leads by excessive expenditure to the printing press.\" Mr. Warburg likewise declared: Even if I assume inventing, in theory, population of the country will suffer. modity prices may soon result in unbridled speculation, \"There there is any uncertainty as to that Professor Warren a money or someone else is capable of better than that developed by centuries of experience, I do not believe that as a practical matter anything other than a gold standard will work satisfactorily.

There can be increase in business activity so long as there is any uncertainty as to no the future of the monetary unit or as to the future of Government credit.

Other New York were on the program included Henry Morgenthau, former Ambassador to Turkey and father of the Acting Secretary of the Treasury; United States Senator Elmer Thomas of Oklahoma and former Senator Robert L. Owen of the same State. All of these speakers appealed for united support of the President, while occasionally references were made to a meeting being held in New York City on the same evening in opposition to the Administration's monetary policies. In the course of his address he denounced \"the bankers,\" J. P. Morgan, Wall Street and \"the Tory news¬ papers.\" \"Take the gun away from the highwayman,\" he exclaimed. \"Take the gold away from the bankers. They've grabbed our gold, contracted our currency, and now they call us inflationists when we're the sound-money people and they are the radical debt inflationists.\" He aroused the rival audience by his demand: being stopped.\" to the ences interest between the two nations. The President said that his authority for the doctrine of experiment rested in the same ideals which had led to the founding of Georgia. Admitting that there was no quick remedy for \"the chronic illness that beset us for a dozen years,\" he declared: \"But, my friends, we are on the way.\" The President said that \"while we are celebrating the planting of the colony of Georgia, we remember that if the early settlers had been content to remain on the coast there would have been no Georgia to-day. It was the spirit of moving forward that led to the exploration of the great domain of Piedmont and mountains that drove the western border of the colony to the very banks of the Mississippi River itself.

Important changes in the Treasury Department were the developments of the month and resulted in the designation by President Roosevelt of Henry Morgenthau Jr; as Acting Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Morgenthau has been Governor of the Farm Credit Administration, and his successor in that post, named Nov. 16, is Dr. W. I. Myers. The Treasury Department changes involve an indefinite leave of absence granted by the President to William H. Woodin, and the resignation of Dean Acheson, as Under-Secretary; the latter had been Acting Secretary during the absence of Secretary Woodin because of ill health. among On Nov, 15 it was made known that Mr. Woodin had tendered his resignation on Oct. 31 to the President, but the latter declined to accept it, and instead urged upon Secretary Woodin \"a complete leave of absence health and strength, without any responsibility or thought of work.\" Indicating the foregoing as breaking up the Treasury resistance to the to .

One of the first official orders issued by Henry Morgenthau Jr. after he became Acting Secretary of the Treasury was a rule promulgated on Nov. 20 that Treasury officials are not statistical or other information to reresentatives of newspapers, and that all news pertaining to the Treasury must be given out either by him (Mr. Mor¬ genthau) or by Herbert E. Gaston, whom he designated as press contact man for the Treasury Department. Mr. Gaston, a former member of the staff of the New York \"World,\" has been associated with Mr. Morgenthau as Deputy Governor of the Farm Credit Administration. This order governing the issuance of news from the Treasury Department was immediately interpreted in most news¬ paper circles as an attempt to set up a \"censorship\" and although Mr. Morgenthau denied that any censorship had been imposed or was intended, the Treasury Correspondents Association, composed of newspaper men assigned to that Department, wired a formal protest on Nov. 21 to President Roosevelt at Warm Springs, Ga., against the prohibition. On the same day Mr. Morgenthau made public his \"Treasury Department Order No. 1\" which contained the substance of his verbal instructions to bureau chiefs and departmental permitted experts.

Britain took the lead iit the movement by indicating publicly on a number of occasions that Ger¬ many must be treated as an equal. The war scare in Europe that followed the German withdrawal from the League of Nations and the General Disarmament Conference gradually died away under the tendency toward greater harmony in the relations of the leading European States. But actual disarmament appears as distant as ever, since heavily-armed France shows willingness to discard no single gun, a tank, or airplane. or national debate currently being redrawn in the inter¬ are in progress in Europe was shown in at Geneva, from Nov. 18 to 23, attended by British, French and Italian representatives, and of course American observers also were on hand, but The situation occasioned by the German withdrawal of Oct. 14 was dis¬ cussed, and the tendency of the British representatives was disarmament resume negotiations on the basis of the convention submitted by the London Government, with¬ draft out the French addition of provision for a a four-year \"trial\" period of international control and a subsequent four-year period for limited disarmament by the heavily-armed coun¬ tries and moderate re-armament by Germany.

The colony, having the status of Dominion, cannot be forced to surrender its self- a government, and the approval of the Alderdice regime there¬ fore is indispensable if the project is to be carried through.

The Governor would act on the advice of three to be a special commission of six members, appointed by the United Kingdom and three by Newfoundland.
