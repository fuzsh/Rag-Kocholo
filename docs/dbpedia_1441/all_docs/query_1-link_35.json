        "text": "Maine Vertical File s\n\nThe Maine State Library houses a unique collection of vertical files on Maine-related subjects; these folders and clipping books include not only newspaper clippings, but also magazine articles, pamphlets, and ephemera. The materials must be used at the State Library, and may be photocopied. Be prepared to wear gloves when using the files.\n\nThe amount of material in any particular file varies. Some contain extensive material; others contain only one or two items. You may contact the reference department to discuss the contents of any particular file.\n\nThis list is a work in progress. Less than half the files owned by the library are listed here. Expect changes to the content and format of this site as more data is added and edited.\n\nBrowse or Search for Topics\n\nOnly first 200 topics display; search for others below. Search tips: Use last names of people or use both the singular and plural forms of words\n\nBy Subject or Title [4 letter minimum]:\n\nNote:Sort by title, subject, or coverage by clicking on the header; not all columns sort."
