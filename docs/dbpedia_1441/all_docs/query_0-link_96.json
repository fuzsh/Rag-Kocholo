My grandfather was the last one listed on my branch of the family, in the book by M.M.Wilkinson, published in 1949, \"WILKINSON & KINDRED FAMILIES\" I have found lots of mistakes in this book (as always is in genealogy work) and also found some members of a family left out.

Any branch of this family would be most welcome. If you relate to any of this, any connection, I would dearly love to hear from you.

Seeking info on three Wilkinson who were in Texas in the late 1830's into the early days of the Republic. I believe they were brothers: Warren G., Hardin G. & Livingston Wilkinson. They were born in Hardin County Kentucky (their first names are all names of Kentucky Counties). May be related to James G. Wilkinson who was at the Battle of San Jacinto, in which case their father may also be named James who married a Sarah (unk) who was born in South Carolina.
