        "text": "The DF/HCC Leukemia Program conducts innovative basic, translational and clinical research to improve the understanding and treatment of leukemia and related disorders, with a focus on discoveries that will lead to improvements in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy.\n\nProgram members have expertise in identifying oncogenes, defining basic mechanisms of neoplastic transformation in cell culture and animal models of leukemia, analyzing the biology of myeloproliferative neoplasms, developing novel immunotherapeutic approaches, conducting clinical trials of novel therapies, and improving outcomes using stem cell transplantation and adoptive cellular therapies. Program publications include landmark advances that have improved the understanding of leukemia pathobiology and translated gains into improved therapies. To harness the power of interdisciplinary translational science, the Program brings together over 86 investigators representing multiple DF/HCC institutions, departments, and disciplines."
