Poor sleep quality may also increase alcohol use and alcohol craving, yet bi-directional relations between sleep quality and AYA alcohol use are poorly understood.\n\nPurpose\n\nThis study examined bi-directional associations between sleep quality, alcohol craving, and alcohol use in AYA using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and explored if biological sex, age, or race moderated these associations.\n\nMethods\n\nThis pre-registered secondary analysis pooled EMA data from the baseline, pre-randomization period (M = 8.18 days, range = 1–17) in two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials examining medication effects on alcohol use in AYA (N = 115). Each morning, participants reported sleep quality and alcohol consumption (i.e., number of standard drinks) from the previous day, and craving was rated at several random points each day.\n\nResults\n\nMultilevel modeling showed that poorer average sleep quality was associated with higher levels of alcohol craving for females but not for males, and better overall levels of sleep quality were associated with decreased likelihood of engaging in alcohol use. No other person- or day-level associations between sleep and alcohol use emerged.\n\nConclusions\n\nBetter sleep quality may be protective against alcohol use in AYA, and female AYA who report poorer sleep quality may experience higher levels of alcohol craving. Research and clinical assessment of AYA sleep quality can contribute to understanding of factors promoting alcohol craving and use.\n\nKeywords: Adolescents and young adults, leep behaviors, lcohol use, raving, cological momentary assessment\n\nBetter sleep quality may protect against alcohol use among youth. For female youth, in particular, better sleep quality also may also be a protective factor against alcohol craving.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAdolescence and young adulthood are the peak developmental periods for the initiation and escalation of alcohol use. By the end of high school, nearly two-thirds of adolescents have consumed alcohol in their lifetime, and most emerging and young adults (ages 18–25 years) consumed alcohol in the past 30 days [1]. Yet, despite these high prevalence rates, alcohol use among adolescents and young adults (AYA) is not benign; it is associated with myriad short- and long-term consequences, such as unintentional death and injury, increased engagement in other risky behaviors, and increased risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD) across the lifespan (e.g., [2, 3]). Relatedly, the prevalence of AUD spikes during the AYA years: in 2018, 1–2 out of every 100 adolescents, ages 12–17 years, met criteria for an AUD, versus 1 in 10 young adults [1]. Rates of heavy drinking similarly increase dramatically during these developmental periods [1]. This rapid escalation in alcohol use and AUD onset during this developmental window highlights the public health significance of identifying risk factors for AYA alcohol use.\n\nLike alcohol use, poor sleep quality is common among AYA and linked to persistent sleep problems in adulthood [4, 5]. The most common aspect of poor sleep quality among AYA is inadequate sleep duration (i.e., receiving less than 8 h of sleep per night, on average [6, 7]). Approximately 62–72% of adolescents report shorter than recommended sleep durations, with youth who identify as female, and/or youth identifying with racially, and ethnically minoritized backgrounds disproportionately impacted [8, 9]. Notably, biological and psychosocial factors contribute to poor sleep quality among AYA (for a review see Crowley et al. [10]). For example, AYA often have biologically driven shifts toward evening chronotypes (i.e., later sleep onset) that are incongruent with early school or work start times, resulting in shorter sleep durations. Lifestyle choices (e.g., caffeine use, technology usage), academic work, mental, and physical health-related functioning, socioeconomic status, and other psychosocial factors also compromise sleep quality among AYA [10]. Broader sociocultural factors, such as ethnic/racial discrimination, geographic location/neighborhood safety, and exposure to environmental toxins also influence sleep health in youth and contribute to sleep disparities [9, 11].\n\nAlcohol Use and Sleep Problems\n\nAlcohol has both stimulating and sedating properties that acutely affect sleep [12]. Drinking alcohol can facilitate sleep onset, shorten durations of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep early in the night, and lengthen durations of restorative deep sleep, which promotes the perception that it improves sleep [13, 14]. As blood alcohol levels decrease, however, sleep disruption ensues via more night time awakenings, less slow wave sleep, and more REM sleep [15, 16]. Conversely, insomnia and other sleep problems are identified risk factors for alcohol use [12, 17], and these associations are well documented in adults (e.g., [15]). Prevalence rates of co-occurring AUD and insomnia in adults are estimated to be 41–65% [17, 18]. Relations between these constructs are less studied in AYA, however, and this gap is notable because AYA are developmentally and contextually prone to both sleep problems and alcohol use.\n\nUnique Considerations for Examining Indicators of Sleep Quality and Alcohol Use in AYA\n\nAdolescence and young adulthood is a unique period for examining associations between alcohol use and sleep. Pubertal onset and related hormonal changes trigger a biologically mediated preference for later sleep timing (i.e., chronotypes [6, 10]) along with sex differences in sleep quality and prevalence of sleep disorders that persist into adulthood [19, 20]. Further, preclinical and human data indicate that AYA are less sensitive to the sedating effects of alcohol [21–23] and more sensitive to its stimulating effects [24]. Drinking frequency and intensity of AYA also differ from adults; alcohol use among AYA tends to be less frequent and often restricted to weekends [25]. This is notable given that AYA often use weekends to compensate for weekday sleep loss caused by early-wake times for school [26]. Relative to other developmental periods, AYAs are also more likely to engage in heavy drinking, which is positively related to sleep problems in this age group [27]. Lastly, recent trends show shifts in sex-related differences in AYA alcohol use such that females report more alcohol use and heavy drinking than males due to decreases in male drinking [1]. This shift is notable since female adolescents also tend to have higher rates of sleep problems [28].\n\nState of the Science of Sleep Behaviors and Alcohol Use Among AYA\n\nCross-sectional (e.g., [29–31]), and prospective studies (e.g., [32, 33]), show associations between sleep problems and alcohol use among AYA. Adolescent alcohol use is prospectively and cross-sectionally associated with disruptions across multiple dimensions of sleep health [e.g., 34–37]. Prospectively and cross-sectionally, AYA with AUD tend to experience more sleep problems than non-drinking AYA [e.g., 38]. Additionally, prospective reports of insomnia/sleep problems in non-drinking youth are associated with alcohol use initiation and frequency of alcohol use among early adolescents [33] as well as increases in drinking over time in college students [32].\n\nThus, a bi-directional relationship between alcohol use and sleep problems seems likely where each construct dynamically influences the other. Few studies, however, examined this possibility among AYA [36,39–42], and only three studies used methods aptly suited to test these associations (e.g., intensive longitudinal assessment [36,40,41]). Intensive longitudinal assessments, such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), are optimal for examining associations among highly variable, contextually dependent behaviors, like sleep and alcohol use, in real-time. Traditional longitudinal designs with long time gaps between assessments cannot capture the daily interplay between constructs. Further, EMA integrates assessments on a fixed (e.g., daily morning reports) and random schedules, which can identify how dynamic processes (e.g., alcohol craving) fluctuate throughout a given day. This is a notable advantage over traditional methods given recent findings that alcohol craving shows a reliable 24-h rhythm that peaks and troughs between 20:00–21:00 and approximately 08:00, respectively [38, 43].\n\nExistent intensive longitudinal studies of alcohol use and sleep recruited college students with varying levels of drinking and sleep behaviors [36,40,41]. Surprisingly, two [36,40] found that better self-reported sleep metrics were associated with higher levels of next-day drinking. Specifically, sleep efficiency in Miller et al. [36,44] and perceived sleep quality, morning alertness, and earlier awakening (despite less sleep quantity) in Fucito et al. [40] were associated with increased next-day drinking. In contrast, Graupensperger et al.’s [41] longitudinal EMA study, which involved twice-daily surveys for five 14-day sampling bursts over a 2-year period, found that participants’ poorest reports of sleep health were on alcohol-only use days (as compared to poly-substance use days).\n\nLimitations of Existing Work\n\nIn sum, findings are mixed across the few studies that utilized intensive longitudinal assessment approaches to examine bi-directional, within-person relations between sleep and alcohol use in AYA. Further, alcohol-related outcomes (e.g., engagement in drinking, quantity of alcohol consumed) fail to consider other dynamic, subjective processes related to alcohol use, such as craving [45]. Craving is a key component in models of substance use disorders and relapse and intervention target. Indeed, among adolescents in particular, levels of alcohol craving relate to increased likelihood of alcohol consumption [37]. Likewise, young adults with later (versus earlier) sleep and circadian timings may experience peak alcohol craving relatively later in the evening [38, 43]. Preliminary research with adults suggests that sleep problems and craving levels are related both prospectively [34, 46] and cross-sectionally [47].\n\nThe Current Study\n\nThis pre-registered (OSF Identifier: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/MT6ZV) analysis of existing data aimed to address gaps in the literature by testing day-level, bi-directional associations amongst sleep quality, alcohol craving, and alcohol use in AYA (age 14–24) who consume alcohol regularly (i.e., an average of two or more days per week). Using an intensive longitudinal design, sleep quality, and alcohol use, including number of standard drinks consumed, were assessed daily via EMA. Alcohol craving was assessed throughout the day during random EMA assessment, which allowed for examination of within-person moment-to-moment fluctuations in craving in relation to the day-level reports of alcohol use and sleep quality. We hypothesized that mornings when AYA reported worse sleep quality would be prospectively associated with (1a) greater alcohol craving that day, (1b) a greater likelihood of consuming alcohol that day, and (1c) consuming a greater quantity of alcohol that day, and that, (2) greater quantity of alcohol consumed would be prospectively associated with worse sleep quality that night. Given that sleep problems, including poor sleep quality, are more prevalent in females than males, interactions between age, sex, and key study variables were considered in an exploratory aim. Due to documented racial disparities in sleep health, race was also included as a covariate [9, 48].\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize rigorous EMA approaches to capture individual variability among AYA who consume alcohol regularly to examine day-level bi-directional relations between sleep quality, alcohol use, and craving. Given that sleep quality and alcohol use are both modifiable health behaviors that benefit from early intervention [44], increased understanding and consensus regarding shared relations in these processes can provide valuable information to inform novel intervention and prevention efforts.\n\nMethods\n\nData for this secondary analysis were pooled from the approximately 1 week baseline periods (prior to randomization) from two double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials examining the effects of topiramate (herein referred to as Study 1; [NCT01641445]) and naltrexone (herein referred to as Study 2 [37]) on AYA alcohol use. Eligible AYA had to drink alcohol at least two days per week on average in the past 28 (Study 1) to 30 days (Study 2), read simple English, and be post-pubescent. Age ranges differed slightly by study: Study 1 included AYA aged 14–24 years, while Study 2 included 15 to 19-year-olds. Exclusionary criteria were a history of alcohol treatment or seeking formal treatment; opioid use in the past 30 days; current or lifetime diagnosis of opioid use disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR [49]); a positive urine toxicology screen for amphetamines, narcotics, amphetamines, opiates or sedative hypnotics; a score of > 10 on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-AR) [50]; suicidal ideation or psychosis; prescribed medication or diagnosed with medical conditions that contraindicated taking the study medication (topiramate or naltrexone). Data collection for Study 1 occurred from September 2012 to April 2016 while data collection for Study 2 took place from July 2009 to November 2010. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for both studies.\n\nStudy Procedures\n\nAYA interested in participating completed a telephone pre-screen. Those who were potentially eligible were scheduled for an in-person screening. Informed consent was obtained from participants ≥ 18 years of age and parent permission was obtained for minors (< 18 years of age); minors provided assent to participate. Participants completed baseline assessments and were instructed on the EMA protocol using a detailed graphic manual. EMA protocols were implemented on Samsung handheld devices and included a combination of device-initiated assessments with auditory prompts (e.g., “random assessments”) and user-initiated assessments (i.e., “morning reports”). Random assessments were administered within 3-h blocks throughout the day except while sleeping or engaging in activities where completing assessments was not feasible or safe (e.g., driving). For more information on the EMA protocols see [37, 51].\n\nMeasures\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics were collected at baseline. AUD diagnoses, based on the DSM-IV-TR criteria [49] were determined by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders for School-Age Children (K-SADS [52]).\n\nSleep quality\n\nEach morning, participants completed two items to capture their subjective sleep quality rating from the prior evening [53]. Using an 11-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extreme trouble), participants rated “How much trouble did you have sleeping last night?” Participants were also asked, “How many times did you wake up during the night?” (range = 0–61). Since these items were assessed on different scales, they were standardized prior to being averaged together to form a sleep composite variable. Prior to averaging, outliers for the sleep efficiency item were recoded to 3 standard deviations above the mean because the variable was non-normally distributed (skew = 13.51, kurtosis = 278.42) [54]. This led to two observations (0.002%) being recoded, which improved this variable’s distribution (skew = 2.63, kurtosis = 10.03). The sleep quality composite variable was normally distributed (skew = ‐1.27, kurtosis = 1.48).\n\nOf note, the pre-registration called for utilizing three items from the morning report to assess sleep quality: (i) How much trouble did you have sleeping last night?” (ii) “How many times did you wake up during the night?” and (iii) “How tired do you feel right now?” The third item assessing tiredness was removed from the sleep quality composite as tiredness is related to sleepiness but is a distinct construct [55, 56]. Moreover, tiredness may not reflect sleep quality as it can result from an array of conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, or pain).\n\nAlcohol craving\n\nTo examine the effects of sleep quality on subsequent alcohol craving, participants rated their craving during random assessments. This single-item measure is widely used with AYA in the laboratory and with EMA [22, 37]. Specifically, participants were presented with a visual analog slider bar, “How strong is your urge to drink alcohol right now?” Responses were from 0 (i.e., no urge) to 10 (strongest ever). Craving responses were limited to random assessments that occurred prior to alcohol or cannabis use each day and averaged within day.\n\nAlcohol use\n\nDuring EMA morning reports, participants reported how many standard alcoholic drinks they consumed the prior day. In the United States, a “standard drink” is defined as a drink containing 0.6 fluid oz. or 14 g of pure alcohol (e.g., 12 fluid oz. of regular beer, 1.5 fluid oz. of distilled spirits, or 5 fl. oz of wine [57]). Alcohol use quantity was non-normally distributed (skew = 7.17, kurtosis = 82.75) and zero-inflated (52% of observations were 0 s); observations were recoded to three standard deviations above the mean [54]; six observations were recoded (0.01%), which reduced the skew (1.98) and kurtosis (3.57). Models predicting quantity of alcohol use only assessed alcohol use on drinking days.\n\nCannabis use\n\nTo account for high rates of cannabis use among youth who engage in alcohol use [58]. Cannabis use was included as a statistical control variable. EMA morning reports captured whether participants used cannabis the prior day and, as relevant, how many grams of cannabis they consumed the prior day. To ensure accurate estimates of day-level cannabis quantity, participants were trained during the baseline appointment to estimate different cannabis quantities by weighing a surrogate substance (i.e., oregano). This approach has demonstrated evidence of validity and reliability in prior research [59, 60], including EMA studies [61]. Cannabis use was initially non-normally distributed (skew = 17.97, kurtosis = 392.43), and 12 observations (0.01%) were recoded to three standard deviations above the mean [54], which reduced skew (3.13) and kurtosis (1.09) to acceptable levels.\n\nData Analytic Plan\n\nMultilevel modeling (MLM) was used to test our hypotheses given the nested structure of the data—repeated assessments (level 1) nested within individuals (level 2). MLM for continuous outcomes, alcohol craving, quantity of alcohol use (measured in standard drinks), and sleep quality, was implemented using Proc MIXED in SAS 9.4. Proc GLIMMIX was used for the categorical outcome, likelihood of alcohol use, in SAS 9.4. Continuous outcome models were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation and categorical outcome models were estimated using pseudo-likelihood estimation which allowed for the inclusion of subjects with missing outcome data. Time-varying predictors were person centered, meaning that person-averages were subtracted from day-level values. This allowed for separately assessing the relation between average levels of each time-varying predictor (person-level effect) and daily deviations from average levels of each predictor (day-level effect) on AYA alcohol craving, the probability of alcohol use, quantity of alcohol use, and sleep quality. Thus, day-level effects capture within-person processes, that is, on days where an AYA’s sleep quality was lower than their average sleep quality do they engage in greater alcohol use, and person-level effects capture between-person processes, that is, do adolescents with overall poorer sleep quality, relative to the overall sample, engage in greater alcohol use?\n\nOf note, models for alcohol craving, the probability of alcohol use, and quantity of alcohol use (e.g., number of standard drinks) examined prospective associations such that sleep quality the prior night predicted next-day outcomes. The model predicting sleep quality was arranged such that alcohol use on use days predicted sleep quality that night. Assessments for sleep quality and past-day alcohol use both occurred at the same morning report. Age, study of origin, race, and weekend status were included as statistical covariates. Sensitivity analyses were conducted when predicting sleep quality controlling for day- and person-level grams of cannabis smoked. Day- and person-level grams of cannabis smoked were also included as statistical covariates when predicting the likelihood and quantity of alcohol use.\n\nModel building occurred in a sequential fashion. First, an intercept only MLM was conducted to assess variability at the person- and day-level of analysis. Second, focal predictors and covariates were added to the model. Third, a log-likelihood nested model test was conducted to determine whether the inclusion of a random slope for the day-level focal predictor (i.e., day-level alcohol use and sleep quality) led to a significant increment in model fit. Lastly, nested model tests were conducted to determine whether the inclusion of biological sex interactions and age interactions led to a significant increment in model fit.\n\nPower Considerations\n\nSleep quality at the day- and person-level were the focal predictors in the models predicting alcohol craving, and the probability and quantity of alcohol use. The focal predictors for the models predicting sleep quality were alcohol use at the day- and person-level. Assuming a moderate intra-class correlation coefficient, with an overall sample size of 115 participants and 8 days of EMA for participants, on average, the analyses were powered to detect small day-level effects and small to medium size person-level effects for sleep quality predicting alcohol use outcomes and alcohol use predicting sleep quality based on simulation work [62]. Cross-level interactions with age and biological sex were powered to detect medium effects.\n\nResults\n\nIndividual Level Descriptive Statistics\n\nThe overall sample consisted of 115 youth with 86 coming from Study 1 and 29 coming from Study 2. The average age was 20.04 (SD = 2.19; range = 14–24). Half the sample was female (N = 58, 50%); the majority was White (74%), 13% were Black or African American, 5% were Asian, and 4% were Pacific Islander. Overall, 20% of AYA indicated Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. Approximately 60% of the sample were full time students (N = 69) and half of the sample (N = 57) graduated high school, college, or had some college education. Parent education level (as reported by participants) varied: 3.5% of mothers and 7.5% of fathers completed some high school or less, 24% of mothers and 20% of fathers completed high school, 28% of mothers and 21.5% of fathers completed some college, and 44% of mothers and 51% of fathers attained a college or graduate degree.\n\nA total of 67 youth (58%) met DSM-IV-TR criteria for alcohol dependence. On average, participants reported consuming alcohol on 3 days (M = 2.98, SD = 2.20), drinking 3.67 standard drinks (SD = 2.72) on alcohol use days, and an average daily alcohol craving of 2.15 (SD = 2.46) during the assessment period. On average, youth reported smoking cannabis on 2 days (M = 2.06, SD = 2.92) and smoking 0.30 g (SD = 0.61) on alcohol use days. Average trouble sleeping was 2.66 (SD = 2.95), and youth reported waking up 1.12 (SD = 1.73) times per night (46% of observations reported waking up 0 times the prior night, 14% reported waking up 2 or more times). For trouble sleeping (measured on a 0 [none at all] to 10 [extreme trouble] scale), 30% of observations indicated no trouble sleeping (0) and 21% of observations reported trouble sleeping as a 5 or greater. On average, youth completed EMA reports for 8 days (range = 1–17). Overall, youth completed 857 out of a possible 950 morning reports (90%). Completion rates were slightly lower in Study 1 (89%; 677/759 possible morning reports) compared to Study 2 (94%; 180/191 possible morning reports). Youth completed 77% of random assessments, with Study 1 having lower compliance (74%, 1721/2330 possible random assessments) compared to Study 2 (88%; 649/735 possible random assessments).\n\nDaily- and Person-Level Variability\n\nPrior to estimating MLM with predictors, intercept only models determined the variability in the study outcomes at the daily-level (within-person variability) and person-level (between-person variability). For alcohol craving, 53% of the variability was due to person-level differences and 47% of the variability was due to day-level differences. 23% of the variability in the probability of alcohol use was due to person-level differences and 77% was due to day-level differences. For quantity of alcohol use on drinking days, 20% of the variability occurred at the person-level and 80% occurred at the day-level. For sleep quality, 34% of the variability was due to person-level differences and 66% was due to day-level differences.\n\nSleep Quality Predicting Alcohol Craving and Use\n\nAlcohol craving\n\nA log-likelihood nested model test supported including a random slope for day-level sleep quality predicting alcohol craving [χ2(2) = 9.7, p = .007]. Nested model tests did not support including age [χ2(2) = 1.1, p = .576] or biological sex interactions [χ2(2) = 4.3, p = .116]. Of note, the non-significant nested model test for the biological sex interactions was driven by a non-significant day-level interaction; inclusion of the person-level interaction significantly improved model fit [χ2(1) = 4.1, p = .042]. Given the significant person-level sleep quality × biological sex interaction, we retained daily- and person-level sleep quality × biological sex interactions.\n\ndisplays the final MLM results predicting alcohol craving, which included day-level sleep quality × biological sex and person-level sleep quality × biological sex interactions as well as a random slope for day-level sleep quality. There was a significant interaction between person-level sleep quality and biological sex. This interaction was probed to assess the relationship between person-level sleep quality and alcohol craving for males and females. As depicted in , simple slopes indicated that poorer average sleep quality was associated with higher levels of alcohol craving for females (B = ‐0.77, p < .0001). In contrast, there was no relationship between overall sleep quality and alcohol craving for males (B = ‐0.25, p = .16).\n\nTable 1.\n\nAlcohol cravingProbability of alcohol useQuantity of alcohol use+ B SE t-value B OR SE t-value B SE t-valueIntercept2.440.279.05***‐0.73–0.22‐3.27**3.440.3410.03***Biological sex‐0.710.34‐2.08*‐0.280.760.27‐1.06‐0.570.42‐1.34Age‐0.080.09‐0.930.251.280.073.47***‐0.180.11‐1.54Race (relative to White) Black‐0.130.49‐0.27‐0.300.740.39‐0.781.040.681.54 Other0.060.520.12‐0.400.670.41‐0.98‐1.220.65‐1.89Study0.200.450.450.491.630.371.330.820.641.28Weekend0.060.130.480.852.340.184.65***0.680.302.25*Day-level cannabis use–––0.862.360.312.82**0.740.451.63Person-level cannabis use–––0.331.390.211.570.990.313.21**Day-level sleep quality‐0.030.07‐0.39***‐0.010.990.05‐0.110.080.090.91Person-level sleep quality‐0.770.18‐4.23‐0.220.810.10‐2.14*‐0.040.16‐0.23Day-level sleep quality × biological sex‐0.040.09‐0.47–––––––Person-level sleep quality × biological sex0.520.252.05*–––––––\n\nProbability of alcohol use\n\nA log-likelihood nested model test did not support including a random slope for day-level sleep quality predicting the probability of alcohol use [χ2(2) = 1.1, p = .579]. Log-likelihood nested model tests for interactions with age and biological sex resulted in negative chi-square values. Consequently, Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) were used to assess if the inclusion of interaction terms improved model fit. Lower AIC and BIC values indicate improved model fit. Relative to the model with a random intercept, focal predictors, and covariates (AIC = 864.49, BIC = 900.51), inclusion of age (AIC = 868.68, BIC = 901.08) and biological sex (AIC = 868.41, BIC = 900.81) interactions did not improve model fit. As reported in , older aged youth (i.e., a 1-year increase in age) and weekends, relative to weekdays, were both significantly positively associated with the probability of alcohol use (B = 0.25, p < .001; B = 0.85, p < .001, respectively). Similarly, youth were more likely to drink alcohol on days when they used more grams of cannabis than they typically use (B = 0.86, p = .005). Youth who reported higher average sleep quality across the monitoring period were less likely to drink alcohol (B = ‐0.22, p = .03). Contrary to our hypothesis (1b), day-to-day fluctuations in sleep quality were not associated with the likelihood of alcohol use on a given day.\n\nQuantity of alcohol use\n\nA log-likelihood nested model test did not support including a random slope for day-level sleep quality predicting quantity of alcohol use [χ2(2) = 0.50, p = .778].

Person-level grams smoked of cannabis were positively associated with quantity of alcohol use on use days such that youth who overall consumed more grams of cannabis drank a greater amount of alcohol on use days (B = 0.99, p = .002). There were no other significant predictors of the level of alcohol use on use days.\n\nAlcohol use predicting sleep quality\n\nA log-likelihood nested model test did not support including a random slope for day-level alcohol use predicting sleep quality [χ2(2) = 2.60, p = .272].

Day-level and person-level quantity of alcohol use was unrelated to sleep quality. For the sensitivity analysis with cannabis use in the model, alcohol use at the day- and person-level remained unrelated to sleep quality. Further, grams of cannabis smoked at both the day- and person-level were unrelated to sleep quality.\n\nTable 2.\n\nSleep qualitySleep quality (sensitivity analysis) B SE t-value B SE t-valueIntercept‐2.090.25‐8.32***‐2.120.25‐8.43***Biological sex0.100.300.310.100.310.33Age‐0.010.08‐0.130.000.08‐0.01Race (relative to White) Black0.000.450.010.090.460.20 Other‐0.210.47‐0.46‐0.280.47‐0.59Study0.110.430.250.140.440.31Weekend0.200.220.910.220.221.00Day-level alcohol use‐0.010.07‐0.190.000.060.08Person-level alcohol use‐0.020.07‐0.260.000.080.04Day-level cannabis use–––‐0.170.31‐0.56Person-level cannabis use–––‐0.120.23‐0.51\n\nDiscussion\n\nSleep problems and alcohol use among AYA are considerable public health concerns that often co-occur [63]. Yet, temporal relations between these constructs are under-studied, leaving important questions unanswered about whether and how sleep and alcohol use are related among AYA. This study extended prior sleep and alcohol research by leveraging EMA to discern whether daily fluctuations in sleep quality, alcohol use, and alcohol craving are prospectively related among AYA who drink alcohol an average of two or more days per week. We hypothesized that worse sleep quality would be prospectively related to greater alcohol craving and a higher likelihood and quantity of alcohol use later that day, and that alcohol use would prospectively predict poorer sleep quality that night. An exploratory aim of this pre-registered analysis of existing data was to consider if individual characteristics (biological sex, age, race) moderated bi-directional associations between sleep problems, craving, and the likelihood of use.\n\nOn average, poorer sleep quality was associated with higher levels of alcohol craving among females but not males, and better overall sleep quality was associated with decreased likelihood of alcohol use (although day-level, or within-person, sleep quality was not associated with probability of alcohol use). No other person- or day-level associations between sleep and alcohol use emerged. These findings are broadly consistent with theory [64] and prior studies linking sleep quality and craving of salient reinforcers such as nicotine [65], illicit substances [66], and food [67]; yet, sex-related differences in relations between sleep and craving in the current sample are distinct. Moreover, results align with research showing that sleep problems heighten reward sensitivity among AYA [68]. This heightened reward sensitivity may leave sleep-deprived AYA who drink alcohol more likely to use it, especially when faced with environmental cues that elicit alcohol craving.\n\nNovel Insights: The Potential Importance of Sleep Quality for Alcohol Craving for Females\n\nExamining relations between sleep quality and alcohol craving—a modifiable, subjective process closely related to alcohol use—among AYA is a unique contribution of this study. That poorer sleep quality was related to elevated alcohol cravings among females but not males highlights the importance of considering biological sex differences in AYA research. Indeed, half of the variance in alcohol craving was due to between-person differences in the current analysis. This is similar to findings from an EMA study with adults [34] indicating that between-person effects of sleep quality on craving were stronger than within-person effects; however, sex differences were not observed in their analyses. Based on their findings, Freeman and Gottfredson [34 posited that poor sleep quality may have a cumulative effect on cravings in adults over time. The present study further suggests that this cumulative effect may be moderated by sex differences in AYA. Prior work has shown biological sex differences in multiple aspects of sleep including chronotype, circadian rhythm, menstrual phase, and pubertal development [69, 70]. However, few studies have specifically investigated sex differences in relations between sleep and alcohol [15, 20], especially among AYA—a notable limitation given differences in pubertal status between AYA and adults. Additionally, poor sleep is an established predictor of increased next-day negative affect [71]. Other research suggests that negative mood is associated with higher levels of craving among females than males with alcohol dependence [72] and, in a different sample, mood disturbances explained cross-sectional relations between craving and sleep problems [47]. Thus, while measures of affect over time were not tested in the current study, it may be that poorer sleep was linked to elevated craving among females via changes in affect and mood. Overall, the present study suggests that additional examination of alcohol craving and sex differences in AYA sleep research is warranted.\n\nEquivocal Findings Persist When Examining Bi-Directional Relations Between Sleep Quality and Alcohol Use in AYA\n\nStudy hypotheses concerning the bi-directional nature of sleep quality and alcohol use were not supported. That is, within-person changes in sleep quality were not related to subsequent within-person changes in the likelihood or quantity of alcohol use (or vice-versa). These results are in line with a few prior studies that found that alcohol use for sleep aid was not associated with poorer sleep outcomes over time among college students [14, 73].\n\nConversely, the current results diverge from prior studies in college-aged youth that found sleep quality was worse on drinking days (e.g., [41],) or that alcohol use was greater on days following better sleep quality [36,40]. Mixed results between sleep quality and alcohol use could be due to methodological differences across studies, including sample characteristics, and the duration and type of study assessments. For example, methdologically, Graupensperger and colleagues [41] enrolled non-treatment seeking young adults who completed five, 14-day bursts of fixed morning and evening surveys over a 2-year period while Miller et al. [36, 44]’s study with college students with insomnia and heavy drinking episodes utilized online daily diaries completed for approximately 7–10 days. Further, Graupensperger et al.’s [41] sample had lower and higher levels of alcohol and cannabis use, respectively, than in the current study. Alternatively, while Fucito and colleagues’ [40] sample more closely resembles participants in the current study, their study combined self-reports and sleep-wake activity monitors to collect more detailed data on sleep behaviors (e.g., time of sleep and wake onset). Lack of consesus across studies also suggests that there could be other unexplored moderating and mediating factors (e.g., affect) that influence relations between sleep and alcohol use in AYA.\n\nLimitations and Considerations\n\nIt is important to consider our findings within the context of the study’s limitations and strengths. Study assessments were limited to self-reports and did not include measurement of sleep duration, sleep onset, wake time, time spent awake in bed, or if substances were being used as a sleep aid. Relatedly, the sleep quality index variable was a combined average of individual items that assessed key aspects of sleep quality (trouble sleeping, sleep efficiency), as defined by the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project [53], but this variable is not an exhaustive or validated assessment of sleep quality. Although data from biosensor technology (e.g., actigraphy) has generally not demonstrated significant relations between sleep behaviors and alcohol use (e.g., [36],) it does offer a rich, objective evaluation of aspects of sleep quality when used as part of a multimodal assessment battery. Likewise, including a biomarker of alcohol use would have complemented self-reported drinking.\n\nParticipants also self-reported their daily cannabis use quantity in grams based on training during the baseline appointment. While this approach has been shown to produce valid and reliable estimates [59, 60], more recent research has also called into question participants’ ability to accurately estimate cannabis quantity [74], especially for non-flower cannabis products (e.g., edibles). Future research would benefit by incorporating methods to measure cannabis quantity that accounts for distinct routes and modes of administration. Additionally, sleep problems were not part of the eligibility criteria for either study. In fact, EMA data showed that, on average, participants had low frequency of nightly awakenings on average and low reports of trouble sleeping. Thus, low base rates of poor sleep quality may have contributed to a lack of demonstrated relations between alcohol use and sleep quality. Relatedly, sleep quality ratings and relations between sleep and alcohol use among this sample of AYA may not be representative of the experiences of AYA with clinical sleep problems. Findings may differ in a sample of AYA that use alcohol and report more pervasive sleep problems. These findings may also not be generalizable to a sample of AYA seeking treatment for alcohol use.\n\nImportantly, the present study did not assess for structural (e.g., racism, discrimination), societal (e.g., legal), cultural, or environmental factors that may contribute to alcohol use and/or sleep behavior disparities among persons based on race, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Considering these factors in future work is an important step in understanding associations between sleep quality and alcohol use. Also, in this sample, older age and weekend days increased the probability of alcohol consumption. While this pattern of use replicates prior findings that alcohol consumption among AYA is more likely on weekends than weekdays [25], it is possible that sleep quality was not related to alcohol use in the current analysis because opportunities to drink were restricted by the limited number of weekends in the study timeframe.\n\nSeveral strengths should also be considered. Our study design allowed for naturalistic observation of sleep quality in AYA with alcohol problems and prospectively assessed nightly sleep behaviors as well as next-day functioning, both of which are germane components of sleep health. It is also worth noting that certain sleep behaviors (e.g., perceptions about trouble sleeping) are inherently subjective and cannot be comprehensively measured with objective measures alone; thus, this study leveraged use of self-report to capture those experiences. The use of rigorous EMA methods was another notable strength that likely minimized recall bias of prior day sleep behaviors and alcohol use and allowed for in vivo assessment of alcohol craving. Likewise, compliance rates were excellent and exceeded recent meta-analytic results showing that the weighted average compliance rate for EMA protocols with AYA is 78.3% [75]. Moreover, implementing random assessments throughout each study day allowed for a more comprehensive examination of alcohol cravings that have been shown to fluctuate within a given day based on different environmental contexts (e.g., presence of peers and alcohol cues [76]). Lastly, to our knowledge this is the first study to assess daily sleep quality and alcohol cravings in the context of alcohol use among AYA with alcohol problems.\n\nConclusions and Future Directions\n\nSleep problems and alcohol use remain prevalent among AYA and are associated with short- and long-term consequences across myriad domains, including mental health, social, emotional, and physiological development. Thus, there is a pressing need to better understand how sleep and alcohol use are interrelated among AYA. The current study sheds light on person- and day-level relations between sleep quality, alcohol use and craving among AYA who use alcohol regularly. Close examination of sleep quality and craving, a previously unexplored and modifiable component of AYA alcohol use in the context of sleep research, is particularly novel. Future work should consider the role of cannabis craving in conjunction with alcohol craving in order to determine if there are differences and/or unique contributions of craving for different substances on sleep. Findings from the current study shed light on potential sex differences in relations between sleep quality and craving that may moderate these effects and impact underlying mechanisms linking sleep and substance use. While the underlying behavioral and biological mechanisms linking poor sleep quality and craving are relatively unexplored in AYA, results concerning sleep quality and subsequent alcohol craving have potential intervention implications that warrant future research. Specifically, behavioral interventions like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) have demonstrated efficacy in improving sleep quality and reducing alcohol use among individuals with AUD [77]. However, more research is needed to understand the extent to which improved sleep quality resulting from CBT-I interventions also reduces alcohol craving. Further, the current findings suggest that combining CBT-I with components that seek to improve effective strategies to cope with cravings (e.g., urge surfing) may be especially helpful for AYA females.\n\nFinally, heterogeneity persists amongst research examining bi-directional relations between sleep and alcohol use in AYA. Thus, future research needs to examine additional individual (e.g., mental health, emotion regulation, BMI), social (e.g., parenting/family behaviors, racial discrimination), and environmental (e.g., housing) factors that may influence relations between sleep and alcohol use.\n\nFunding\n\nThis research was supported by grants from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA; R01AA007850, PI: Miranda; R21AA017273, PI: Miranda).
