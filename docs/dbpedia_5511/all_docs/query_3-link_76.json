        "text": "The first and oldest educational institution of the Southern Baptist Convention disclosed in a report Wednesday that its four founders together owned more than 50 slaves, part of a reckoning over racism in the nation’s largest Protestant denomination.\n\nThe 71-page report released by the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary is a recitation of decades of bigotry, directed first at African slaves and later at African-Americans. Beginning with the founding of the seminary in Greenville, S.C., in 1859, the report found that the school, with few exceptions, backed a white supremacist ideology.\n\n“The moral burden of history requires a more direct and far more candid acknowledgment of the legacy of this school in the horrifying realities of American slavery, Jim Crow segregation, racism, and even the avowal of white racial supremacy,” wrote R. Albert Mohler Jr., the president of the seminary, which is now in Louisville, Ky.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention has tried before to atone for its past. The denomination began in 1845 when it split from Baptists in the North over slavery. In 1995, on its 150th anniversary, the church issued a formal apology for its support of slavery and segregation. Last year, the convention, which has 15 million members in the United States, condemned white supremacists.\n\nSix current and former faculty members spent a year researching the report. Their findings include:\n\n• In its early years, faculty and trustees defended the morality of slaveholding.\n\n• The faculty worked to preserve slavery, nervous that President Abraham Lincoln’s election could doom the practice.\n\n• After slaves were freed, one of the school’s founders, Basil Manly Sr., called the black people in Greenville an “incubus and plague.” (He later advocated for equal rights.) The faculty, meanwhile, supported the restoration of white rule in the South during Reconstruction.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
