        "text": "Doctrines&nbspBaptists do not have any creeds or confessions of faith which have binding authority. However, there are six underlying principles which govern Baptist belief.\n\nThe Bible alone is a sufficient and authoritative guide to faith.\n\nBaptism is only undertaken by believers accompanied by a profession of faith.\n\nOnly convinced Christians should belong to the church.\n\nEach member of the church has equal say in the running of the church, and, therefore, the minister does not have any special priestly authority.\n\nEach local church is autonomous.\n\nChurch and state are separate. Behind this principle lies the belief that the state should guarantee freedom of belief.\n\nHistory&nbspDuring the final years of the 16th century radical groups emerged in the Anglican church impatient with the church's slow pace of reform. Many of these broke away from the established church and became known as Separatists. One such group was established in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire under the leadership of Thomas Helwys and John Smith, a former Anglican preacher. In 1608 this group moved to Amsterdam in order to escape persecution in England. In Amsterdam Smith became convinced that baptism should be available only to those who are convinced believers. Smith baptised himself and his followers, thus forming the first Baptist church. In 1611 Thomas Helwys and some of his followers returned to London and established the first Baptist church in England. These came to be known as General Baptists because they believed that Christ died for everyone, and not an elect few. In 1638 a Baptist church was formed in Southwark, London whose theology was Calvinistic. Those churches that followed this theology came to be known as Particular Baptists because they believed that only a particular elect group would be saved.\n\nThe Baptist church grew steadily during the first half of the17th century. However, the restoration of the British monarchy in 1660 led to renewed persecution of dissenting churches. During this time the Baptist preacher John Bunyan, author of Pilgrim's Progress, spent 12 years in prison.\n\nThe 18th century saw renewed growth in the church. In 1792 the English Baptist Missionary Society was organised under the leadership of William Carey, planting Baptist churches in India and other parts of Asia.\n\nChurch membership continued to grow throughout the 19th century. Concomitant with this growth was the quest to establish cooperation among different Baptist churches. In 1891 the General and Particular Baptists were united in the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland. Baptist churches were also set up throughout central and eastern Europe.\n\nThe twentieth century has witnessed a growth in international cooperation among Baptist churches. In 1905 the World Baptist Alliance was set up in London. Since then meetings have occurred in different cities roughly every five years. Today there are Baptists in all continents of the world."
