        "text": "The six Singing Men of Texas chapters – sponsored by Texas Baptists Music & Worship – reach into every corner of the state. Each chapter consists primarily of music ministers, but pastors and other church or associational staff members as well as music faculty of colleges and universities are also welcome. Each group meets regularly for a time of fellowship, rehearsal and concert performances.\n\nIf you’d like more information about becoming a member please get in touch with your local chapter below. Membership requirements vary from chapter to chapter.\n\nEstablished in 1975 by Dr. Sam W. Prestidge, Jr., the Singing Men of Texas® was founded as a ministry of the Texas Baptists Church Music Department.\n\nThere are six regional groups comprised primarily of ministers of music, pastors, other church or associational staff members and laymen who actively involved in the music ministry of their churches. The Singing Men of Texas® exists for the purpose of glorifying God through music, proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ, providing an opportunity for Christian growth, inspiration, fellowship and mission service. The groups have participated in outreach efforts across Texas and the United States and have ministered in sermon and song around the world including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Eastern and Western Europe, China and Spain.\n\nToday each of the six regional chapters functions as partners of Texas Baptists Music & Worship team and ministers independently within their region of the state through monthly concerts, mission projects and public appearances in Denominational meetings, community events, sports functions, government gatherings and cultural opportunities with community symphonies. They have sung in numerous conferences and conventions. In 1997, one group was featured at the National Day of Prayer in Washington, D.C. Numerous recordings have been made by each Singing Men group individually and combined.\n\nIn 2000, the entire organization presented a 25th-anniversary concert at the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, Texas. The group was accompanied by a full orchestra and conducted by Dr. Stephen Holcomb, Director of Choral Studies at Dallas Baptist University. In 2005 the combined groups participated in the Impact North East emphasis with the North American Mission Board and served churches in New England. In 2010 and 2012 the groups participated in 4 separate evangelistic projects at the invitation of the Ukraine Baptist Union.\n\nThe individual groups are a valuable ministry that strives to glorify God and proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ through music and to provide opportunities for Christian growth, inspiration, fellowship, mission service and to encourage musical excellence within the local church.\n\nTo become a member, contact the chapter nearest you for more details."
