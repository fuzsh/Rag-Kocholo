        "text": "When choosing the right retirement community to call home for you or your loved one, there are a number of questions that need to be answered so you are well equipped to make an informed decision. Baptist Retirement Homes has a stand-out legacy of offering exceptional care throughout North Carolina — two Life Plan Communities offering the full continuum of care (Brookridge and Taylor Glen), one community offering assisted living and skilled nursing (Western North Carolina), and a free-standing assisted living community (Taylor House). Here’s a list of some of our most frequently asked questions, and we also invite you to please contact us to learn more about Baptist Retirement Homes.\n\nWhat is Baptist Retirement Homes?\n\nFounded in 1951, Baptist Retirement Homes of North Carolina, Incorporated (BRH) is one of North Carolina’s most respected providers of long-term care. With four long-term care facilities located throughout the state, BRH provides all levels of care for older adults, including special programs for seniors with dementia-related disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Baptist Retirement Homes is a not-for-profit, church-related organization that has a historical relationship with the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina.\n\nAre Residents of Baptist Retirement Homes Primarily Baptists?\n\nResidents of Baptist Retirement Homes are not primarily Baptist, nor is that a requirement by any means. We have a diverse representation and welcome residents of all walks of life.\n\nWhat is the Cost of Services? Are Financial Resources Available for Those Who Cannot Pay?\n\nFees vary according to communities and the level of care chosen or required by residents. A full schedule of fees for each facility is available upon request. Contributions received from churches and individuals via the North Carolina Offering for Older Adults, in addition to direct contributions from local churches, are used exclusively to help the communities provide care for those older adults with little or no financial resources in either assisted living or nursing care at the Brookridge, Western North Carolina, and Taylor House communities.\n\nDoes the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina Support Baptist Retirement Homes?\n\nBaptist Retirement Homes has a historical relationship with the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina but is a separate and distinctive corporate entity. Funds received from local churches via the North Carolina Offering for Older Adults and direct contributions from local Baptist churches are used to support older adults living in assisted living or nursing care who lack sufficient financial resources to pay for the care they need and deserve."
