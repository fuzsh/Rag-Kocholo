        "text": "Â Â SHAKESPEARE,\n\nÂ Â JOHN THE BAPTISTÂ\n\nÂ Â Â Â and SALOME\n\nThis paper has no pretensions to be a history, already adequately covered by others.1 With a request to produceÂ âsomething personal, something scholarlyâ the result is more akin to impressionism. By âpersonalâ I understand not only âthe way I see itâ but also a limited amount of personal anecdotal experience not found elsewhere. ByâÂ scholarlyâÂ I understand âbased on fact and evidence not fiction or fancyâ, raising questions which may have some relevance to where we are today . . . or tomorrow. The result is a personal response to Shakespeareâs ministry, visionÂ and limitations and a comment on the long term influence on the Union, the Baptists and the Gospel.\n\nSetting the SceneÂ\n\nThinking in biblical terms, I see John Howard Shakespeare as a John the Baptist figure. Not the Messiah. No pretensions to Messiahship, but sensing that the world is changing. Not content with what he sees around him, he has a hunch there is something in the atmosphere (he knows not what but it harbours change) and he wants to give it a push.\n\nUnfortunately Shakespeare and I just missed each other. He retired in 1924 and died just a few months after I was born. Had we met I would have wanted to ask him about his first day in the office, because I imagine him sitting at his desk, facing east so as not to miss the first hint of sunshine because if he looked over his shoulder the outlook was certainly not good.Â Waiting for that sun to rise that morning must have seemed an eternity. Any vision he had could only be seen through a glass darkly as through a thick London fog. Despite his name and reputation he had never before written a play, nor performed on a stage like this.\n\nFor 300 years Baptists had fairly successfully negotiated rocks and reefs on church, ministry and ordinances (sacraments came later) but when Shakespeare sat at his desk on that morning he knew that there were two (possibly three) amber lights flashing. One was doctrine (the Downgrade Controversy2 still cast its shadow), one was church relations (Anglicans making overtures to the Free churches) and the third was the increasing challenge (or threat) from people like John Clifford and his colleagues, who were exploring the mists of contemporary biblical scholarship and the more liberal attitudes of a social and political agenda. Three clouds, three shadows, three rocks that could wreck the boat or become stepping stones to terra firma. And Shakespeare was the new Captain.\n\nWisely he decided to start in a different place âÂ soft-pedal faith and doctrine, pump up church structures and institutions âÂ and I visualise him taking out a piece of paper and writing down three thoughts.3\n\n1 Â Â If the Union is to survive itâneeds a clear foundation and structures.\n\n2 Â Â If the Baptists are to make a significant contribution they have to plant their tanks on the ecclesiastical Â Â Â lawns of the wider Christian family and acquire recognition.\n\n3 Â Â If the Gospel is to make an impact Baptists must learn to relate to the 20th century world.\n\nSo with that as a framework we will explore occasional highways and byeways as we make the journey.\n\n1Â Union Foundation and Structures\n\nShakespeareâs first review of the troops must have told him that what he had was not an army but a rabble â a collection of independent institutions, sustained by the powerful independency that had created them, and beyondÂ a measure of consanguinuity with those who practised believersâ baptism by immersion, Baptists for the most part were preoccupied with themselves and their survival.Â Tensions were still rumbling between Generals and Particulars and the Down Grade Controversy still too close for comfort. Neither battleground had been cleared, future relationships were tenuous to say the least, minor skirmishes were always likely to break out, and did, and even for a man of Shakespeareâs reputation, experience and ability, to say that the job was a challenge was the understatement of the century.\n\nOrganising independency called for leadership and money. As for leadership John Howard had quite a bit going for him. Born in the north, son of the manse (so hopefully discreet), grown up in the Midlands and trained at Regentâs (so a touch of class) and having ministered in Norwich, this man was no ingenue when it came to Baptists. He was forty, old enough to have acquired wisdom, young enough to have 25 years to make his mark, which he did. A pacifist, clearly from the more liberal wing, committed to church unity (ecumenism not yet having arrived) and not afraid of going out on a limb with one eye on the possibility of a united church, even with episcopacy and re-ordination.\n\nAs for money, being a Yorkshireman, I guess he âknew a bit aâbaht brassâ. Practical. Down-to-earth. 'Called a spade a spade', so keep facing east, hope the clouds behind will go away, let the 19th century dust settle, brush it off and move on to other more practical and less controversial measures.Â\n\nErnest Payne describes those the first ten years, reflecting a Cliffordian type of agenda, as âa decade of developments of almost breathless qualityâ,4 backed by two five-year remarkable funding programmes the fruits of which continued into the second decade and beyond. First, the Twentieth Century Fund (Â£250,0005) whichÂ provided headquarters in Southampton Row and 75 new church buildings âwhere Baptists were inadequately represented,6 followed by a similar sum for the Settlement and Sustentation Fund, thereby opening the door to a minimum stipend, closer relationships with the churches and Associations (Federation), Superintendency, with ministerial selection, training and accreditation, and (he hoped) the Colleges.\n\nIn twenty years Shakespeare had laid the foundations and structures. Seeds had been sown. Not all flourished but some thrived and celebrated their 50th anniversaries mid-century, and anyone born after 1925 would take most of them for granted. He also created the mood music for the century as the fundamental themes came and went, never quite the same but never really different. In a different world or at a different time, his offspring might have been a still birth, or at best a struggling âpremâ. In reality his infant grew steadily and rapidly: a good brain, a healthy body, and a capacity for creating a distinct trend with a knock-on effect on some of his contemporaries. By 1924, the sun was not exactly high in the sky but there was more than a touch of light in the east and re-visiting those years, I sense a new atmosphere. An infectious mood of deus vult in the air of a new century, and our âJ the Bâ had caught the tide just right. But then what?\n\nFortunately there was no Salome out to get him, but Salomeâs shadow (a woman nurtured in tradition, doctrine and dogma) never quite went away, and whenever she surfaced the ride was always a bit bumpy. For most Baptist churches the priority was the local church and ministry.7Â The Union was peripheral.\n\nSo how were Shakespeareâs changes received, how well did they work, and how long did they last?\n\n(i)Â The BMS\n\nSalomeâs first shadow was the BMS. In the 1880s TR Glover (right) had unsuccessfully mooted the possibility of closer integration between BU and BMS.8 Shakespeare was not interested. Salome let it pass but never forgot and her shadow returned in the 1930s when a proposal to purchase a site in Russell Square for Joint Headquarters was voted down by the Assembly,9 and again in the 1950s when further popular pressure was postponed until after the BWA Golden Jubilee Congress, 1955, with an assurance that the matter would then be dealt with, but it never was. Joint Headquarters was the sine qua non, so I saw the move to Didcot in 1984 as prophetic fulfilment. âMy heart leapt up when I beheld a rainbow in the skyâ, until on the opening day I was told that if you went through the main entrance you would find the BMS on the left and the BU on the right.Â Plus Ã§a change, plus la mÃªme chose . . . which leads to my first âWhat if . . .â question.\n\nThree good questions. No answers.\n\n(ii) Â Federation\n\nSalomeâs second shadow budded up with any hint of Federalism. Not a natural for Baptists. Independency was a watchword. Centralisation was a âcus-wordâ. Add in geography and communications, even church members of wider vision rarely got beyond their own District or Association, and of 2,000 Baptist churches in 1883 no more than 500 had any connection even with Associations,10 but by 1911 Federation was a live issue. Churches were encouraged to âjoinâ . . . to âbelongâ . . . . to âpay duesâ to the Union. Imagine the enthusiasm.Â\n\nSome recognised the need, embraced the positives and quietly acquiesced. Some were acutely resistant. Some thought they âbelongedâ already and some didnât know whether they did or not. But for all, raising money and sending it to London was never a priority.Â Could it be that despite all his experience Shakespeare was unaware that something reasonable and innocuous in a London Committee could be lethal by the time it got to the Pennines, and if it meant forking out money, never mind sending it to London, a typical reaction would be, âWhatâs it got to do with us what they are doing in London?â And this was never going away.\n\nNevertheless, Federation slowly established itself, but only ever as a drip-feed.Â Even in the 50s Arnold Clark was still struggling to sell his dream of âSing-a-Song-of-Sixpenceâ for the Home Work Fund.Â And Salome let it pass.\n\n(iii)TheColleges\n\nNot so when it came to the Colleges, where Shakespeare met his Waterloo and Salome got her first scalp. Shakespeareâs plans for a Northern Baptist College uniting Rawdon and Manchester were abandoned by 1903 and had to wait sixty years for fulfilment, but his logically reasonable attempts to incorporate the Colleges into the Union remained âno-goâ territory. How much the Colleges were motivated by genuine differences and how much by self-interest can only be guesswork, but by the middle of the century many of the differences were more historic than divisive. As William Shakespeare might have said, âSome colleges were born with an identity, some acquired an identity and some had an identity thrust upon themâ. With time such distinctions seemed less of a problem, despite the occasional bumpy ride over Accreditation and Settlement, where initial tensions between Principals and Superintendents rumbled on and were only resolved by a new batch of incumbents.\n\nBy mid-century College differences were largely matters of choice, variety and uniformity but had I asked a local Baptist in the mid-40s which College I ought to choose I might have got a somewhat âjaundicedâ View from the North.\n\nÂ It is (and was) of course a travesty, and like all travesties should not be taken too seriously, but contained a crucial grain of truth. To some extent the differences between the colleges reflected the differences within the denomination. Their distinguishing features had a positive value and were not to be dismissed.Â Taken together they were a serious reflection of what it meant to be Baptist and to try to understand Baptists through simply one college was to leave oneself very deformed. We needed them all for a full picture.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, however, their reluctance leaves two nagging questions. With Denominational Colleges closing down or losing their identity, like ice puddles on a spring morning (Wesley in Bristol, Richmond and Heythrop in London,Â Lancashire, Didsbury, and (to some extent)Â Brighton Grove in Manchester),\n\nBut then again . . .Â\n\n(iv) Â The Superintendency\n\nSalomeâs fourth shadow was in response to the Superintendency, and if churches were suspicious of Federalism many ministers were no less suspicious of Superintendents, possibly with good reason as this Rochdale story (which I stumbled on by accident when browsing the web) demonstrates.\n\nIn 1935, as a seven-year-old growing up seven miles from Rochdale, Superintendent matters were not on my agenda, but little pigs have big ears and I was not too young to pick up the vibes from visiting ministers who stayed with us.Â Some seemed hardly aware of them, some were cautiously cooperative, and a few positively anti.Â Some (both churches and ministers) just didnât take them seriously. Herbert Motley became North Western Superintendent in 1934. I think it was getting on for ten years before he visited our church and even then he had to invite himself. For us he just didnât figure. Henry Townsend did and (as we saw earlier) that tension between Supers and Principals persisted to the end of WW2.\n\nPersonally my experiences of Superintendents were always good and positive, but that was not the case for every minister and in twenty years of pastoral work, and an even longer spell closely involved in Union affairs, observation suggested that they blossomed in two colours. One saw himself as pastor to ministers and churches to help them achieve what they wanted to do, and Douglas Hicks was a good example. The other came with plans for co-operation and seemed to think he was there to organise the churchesâ programmes. The one usually succeeded, the other often came unstuck, as the Rochdale story amply illustrates.\n\nOnce they found their niche, my overall impression was that most Superintendents settled in well and did a fair job, though I sometimes felt the system did not help them in two respects. One was their Domains which varied considerably in size, affecting workload and priorities. Lancashire and Cheshire (including North Wales and Carlisle) was huge, scattered, and coterminus with the Association of which the Superintendent was also Secretary. At the other extreme, the Central area embraced eight compact Associations and the Superintendent was Secretary of none.Â\n\nThe other was their Job Descriptions. They were neither fish nor fowl. Strictly speaking they were BU staff, employed by the Union, but whereas in Council Meetings BU staff sat round a central table and were not allowed to speak or vote Superintendents sat in the body of the Council and did both. On one occasion that caused considerable confusion when the Council went into Closed Session and Superintendents objected to being excluded with the staff, and since nobody knew quite what to do nobody had any authority to do it.Â\n\nSalome, however, mostly quiescent on this front, kept a watchful eye to the end of the century before sending in Samson, to flex his muscles, shake the pillars, and watch the whole temple come tumbling down. Jonahâs gourd . . . rose and perished, not in a night but in a century.\n\nBut then hereâs the next âWhat if . . .â question.\n\nSurprisingly perhaps, I have a touch of sympathy for Shakespeare on Episcopacy, the result of an experience on a visit to Zimbabwe in the 1980s. I took the night train from Harare to Bulawayo where I was to be the guest of the Anglican Bishop. I arrived in the very early morning. Hardly anyone got off the train and the platform was deserted save for one man who looked a bit lost. Deciding he must have come to meet me I approached him and said, âAre you the Bishopâs Representative?â âNoâ, he replied, âIâm the Bishopâ. When I expressed surprise that he should meet me personally, he smiled. âNo problemâ, he said, âwe can teach the English something about episcopacyâ. Only later did I find myself wondering why my forbears a century before never thought of it. Probably because throughout the 19th century Episcopacy was a major bone of contention, second only to baptism, but why did our forefathers handle the two so differently?\n\nIn the case of baptism13 the emphasis was always clear and positive (believers and immersion) not negative (babies and sprinkling). In the case of episcopacy we took the concept as worth fighting over but made no effort to refine or replace it. Over the years our view of baptism established itself in the ecclesiastical market place and though not widely followed at least gained recognition to the extent that open baptistries and the baptism of believers is not unknown in Anglican churches.14Â\n\nBut did we miss a trick? We would probably never have had bishops but we might well have enriched ecclesiastical and theological thinking with a different understanding of episcope no less important than baptism.\n\nIn 1989 I was unaware that fresh thinking was in the air: Paul Fiddes15, Geoffrey Reynolds16 and NIgel Wright17 were busily making valuable contributions backed by biblical and historical evidence, but when I looked more closely the overall objective seemed to be an enquiry into how best we can draw on traditional episcope to adjust current patterns of Baptist oversight rather than a root-and-branch examination of biblical and historical interpretations as a basis for a totally new Baptist episcope, which had it been more actively pursued might well have led to Nigel Wrightâs conclusion18 that when it comes to title, âbishopâ is âperhaps the best alternativeâ (title) . . . if not the only one.\n\n(v) TheBaptistUnionCouncil\n\nUndergirding all these structural changes was the BU Council. Mid-century, it consisted of Association Representatives and allied bodies plus 100 others (70 elected by the Assembly and 30 co-opted from unelected nominees, some of whom just had to be there and some representing nobody but themselves having acquired a reputation among Baptists. 1959 is where I came in as one of the seventy.Â\n\nFor the next 34 years I had a ringside view of the Unionâs activities, focused particularly on Ministerial Accreditation, Publishing and Administration, including the Selection Committee for Payneâs successor, five years as part-time Editor of the Carey Kingsgate Press (1962-67), Chair of MR (1971-74) and Chair, Baptist Times (1983-1993).\n\nIn some respects the Council had a touch of the Shareholdersâ Meeting about it â programmes, problems and prospects, either for approval or support, plus all the Committees and a fair number of âShakespeareâs babesâ (now fully grown) reporting on their work. It was mostly legalistic and practical, with little opportunity for serious debate of issues, imagination or creativity. (Any Baptist student seeking a research topic might consider a survey of Council Agendas to compare with today).\n\nMost of my work was behind the scenes, supporting and questioning others as their programmes came before Council and Committees, but on two occasions quite unintentionally I âput the cat among the pigeonsâ, both of which serve to reflect the tensions and delicacy of footwork required when tradition or motivation were even questioned, never mind challenged.\n\nThe first was in 1967. I had been a member of the GP&F Committee for some time so was familiar with the ropes. I was also a member of the Selection Committee for Payneâs successor, so had a full grasp of all that had, or had not, been done. The crunch came when our nomination was put before the GP&F for approval. All went smoothly until I quite spontaneously expressed concern that we had had no discussion whatsoever on Job Description, Terms and Conditions and (most important) salary. The atmosphere was electric. I donât think the Chairman (Len Champion) ever forgave me andÂ the Treasurer angrily declared that he would never tell anyone what he paid Dr Payne! But the issue soon had traction and the Committee went berserk, not so much because the issue had come up but because nobody knew how to handle it, and only after a tussle did the Committee agree that the time had come for such information to be in public domain. But how? Â\n\nFeeling responsible for this fracas I thought it was up to me to come up with something so I proposed that having established the principle the âhowâ called for reflection and could come back next time. Champion (still angry) would have none of it: âthe Committee has made the decision and the Committee now must decide how to handle itâ. Fortunately someone remembered that the BMS had already gone down this road, come up with a perfectly acceptable solution and the Committee was only too pleased to follow suite to mixed cries of relief and satisfaction.\n\nThe other âeventâ was in the MR Committee on which I sat for many years, succeeding WG Channon as Chair in 1971 until I left the pastorate in 1974 and was no longer eligible for the office. Of all the Committees I ever sat on I always felt the MR was one of the most interesting and valuable. We never had to find a niche or develop a programme. We knew exactly what we had to do and the denomination could not function well if we didnât do a good job. It also called for a good mix of strict legalism (applying the rules) and sensitive empathy with the candidate in front of us at a crucial turning point in life. But Salome was always hovering in the wings.Â\n\nFor example, ministerial candidates who had pursued a satisfactory Baptist College course and had the Collegeâs recommendation were ipso facto accredited by the Union. The accreditation of ânon-collegiatesâ (commonly known as âBU Menâ) was a different matter. Some had virtually no training at all but their reputation and years of pastoral experience made them eligible for consideration and accreditation by the Union, following local backing, an assessment of their record and a fairly cursive interview by the London Committee, and they too presented few problems.\n\nIssues arose post 1945 with an increasing number of candidates who could make no claim to experience but who could claim College training albeit in a College not affiliated to the Union, mostly Bible Schools. Did they have sufficient Baptist content and understanding in their training? Many were from the London Bible College whose Principal was Baptist minister Ernest Kevan, which added an element of acute sensitivity, almost to the point where sometimes the debate reflected committee membersâ reactions to Kevan as much as to the candidate.Â\n\nIn the interests of fairness the Committee required a balance of members (ie liberal and evangelical) which again for the most part worked well, but once issues arose tribalism soon clicked in and debate could be fierce and long. It was all part of the game, but what struck me as a newcomer was that after a fight over one man the next man almost invariably went through on the nod.Â Weariness and time pressures seemed to take over. In this case, either through boldness or inexperience, I drew attention to it, only to get a flea in my ear from a senior brother, which encouraged me to think that I might be right and perhaps something different was called for.Â\n\nThankfully, the Chairman, WG Channon, responded positively, and the direct result of our good personal relationship (despite our very different public persona), was a major revision replacing a twenty-minute interview and a large Committee with a two-day Selection Conference and a small group of selectors. I had stirred the pot and came up with the recipe, Channonâ s skill and reputation piloted it through, and by the time it got to Council his mantle had fallen on me do the rest.\n\n2Â Â BaptistRecognitionandTanksonLawns\n\n(i) Â Hugh Martin\n\nWith a wealth of familiar and generally unrewarding historical material on church unity in the first 30 years of the century, I propose in this section to focus on Shakespeareâs point of Baptist Recognition and tell the story through the eyes ofÂ three key personalities and two quite different major events, leading up to an assessment of 20th century ecumenism.Â\n\nIf the Colleges were Shakespeareâs Waterloo, his dream of a United Free Church of England proved his nemesis. Salome struck again, a fatal blow from which (according to Underwood) Shakespeare never recovered. His quest for Baptist recognition by other churches â Tanks on Lawns â was salutary and prescient, yet scant evidence of any attempt to initiate it.19\n\nCompared to his warm enthusiasm for the 1905 BWA Congress, Shakespeareâs cool indifference to Edinburgh 191020 speaks volumes but, fortuitously perhaps, that left an open door for Hugh Martin, a young Scottish Baptist minister, one of only two Baptists present in Edinburgh (as stewards),21 for whom it proved an experience that according to Ernest Payne,22 was âa decisive influence on (Martinâs) developmentâ and triggered the ecumenical course of his life, so touched was he by friendships with those from other traditions and this wider vision of the world.Â\n\nAnthony Cross23 and several obituaries have pointed out what an undervalued Baptist personality Hugh Martin was, so there is no need for me to dwell on it save to add a personal tribute. A cursory glance at his phenomenal contribution to Public and Baptist Life speaks for itself but in addition to his full-time commitment toÂ publishing it was in Ecumenism that he made his greatest mark, for which he received the rare award of a Companion of Honour.\n\nBy 1930 he was obviously destined for ecumenical leadership. Nobody did more than he to establish Baptist tanks on ecumenical lawns. He always seemed to be in the room when ecumenism was in the air. Scarcely any major âecumenical pieâ that didnât have his finger in it.Â Where he was, the Baptists were. His quiet manner and his independence from high ecclesiastical office gave him a freedom to do and say things denied to officialdom and at the same time made him so crucial in tricky negotiations.\n\nIn the case of Lambeth 1920, for example, he was up there with ME Aubrey24Â (left), Gilbert Laws (right) and JH Rushbrooke. He produced a paper on 'The Faith of the Baptists' (part of the official Baptist response), wasÂ persona grataÂ to the other Free Churches and acted as their principal spokesperson in conversations with Cosmo Lang, Archbishop of Canterbury. He was present in a personal capacity in Lausanne 1927 (First World Conference on Faith and Order). In 1937 he was responsible forÂ Towards Reunion,25Â one of nine Baptists inÂ aÂ nineteen strong Free Church Unity Group to draw upÂ A Plan for Unity,26Â and when things were flagging a bit he it was who gave the whole Reunion Movement a push toward connexionalism, though not episcopacy.\n\nFrom the 30s to the 60s he was the Free Church Leader (alongside Henry Townsend and Wilson Black) in the establishment of the National Free Church Federal Council, and gave more than twenty years unbroken service leadingÂ to the creation of the Free Church Federal Council and subsequently the British Council of Churches,27 from its inauguration in 1943 serving as Vice-President (1950-52), Moderator (1953), and Chair ofÂ theÂ Executive Committee (1956-62).\n\nPersonally, from an early stage I felt an affinity with Hugh Martin â a bit on the fringe rather than mainstream, an academic who never held an academic appointment, publisher, (SCM for him, Lutterworth for me), a writer and editor (Two Baptist Hymnbooks, he in 1962 and me in 1989), and both intensely loyal to the Baptists but equally at home working with other traditions in the interests of good and rewarding relationships.Â\n\nUnfortunately I never had the privilege of working with him nor actually seeing him at work but I did have a couple of personal contacts. In 1955 I sent him the mss for my first book to enquire about the possibilities of publication in the hope that he would recommend it to SCM from which he had recently retired. He didnât. He wanted it for the CKP of which he had just become Chairman. The other was in 1962 when I became Editor of CKP and sought him out for some publishing expertise. He responded by inviting my wife and me to lunch at his home, in the course of which (a delightfully human touch) he told us we were sitting on the two chairs on which they had sat at the coronation of the Queen in 1955 when he was Moderator of the Free Church Council and which they were allowed to keep.Â\n\nOne of his lesser known contributions was the creation of the Friends of Reunion in the 1930s serving as Free Church Secretary for the first ten years. I first came across FoR in the early 50s and went to one of their Conferences. Hugh Martin was not there but I was warmly greeted by a woman who asked me who I was and when I said I was a Baptist gave me a look of shocked surprise (Baptists being a bit thin on the ground in their territory) and said âBy Gad, I ought to know you. Iâm Gwenyth Hubbleâ, so in conversation I told her I had just started the Baptist Student Society in Manchester and was currently the secretary of the Baptist Student Federation. That was not my best line. She highly disapproved of all denominational societies but left me in no doubt that I had met an outstanding personality and a leading Baptist light28 of the century â a light which she certainly did not hide under a bushel though not excessively fanned by her constituency. Like Hugh Martin, she too cut her teeth in SCM and the Baptist world and contributed in no small way to putting âBaptist tanks on ecumenical lawnsâ.\n\nAll these bricks led to Baptists becoming a significant unit in the BCC, where Hugh Martin, backed up by Ernest Payne, played a prominent role, supported by countless Baptists in prominent ecumenical appointments in many parts of the world.29 By the mid-century Baptists had arrived. Shakespeareâs hopes were being fulfilled\n\n(ii) Â ErnestAPayne\n\nMid-century, change ushered in a new era with the retirement of ME Aubrey, the appointment of Ernest Payne as his successor, and the loss of Percy Evans, whose personal support led Payne to accept the appointment and whose untimely death therefore left Payne somewhat exposed to the right wing, not least because theÂ 19th century shadow of doctrine and dogma (Salome still at it) had not altogether gone away, and indeed in the post-war years had seen something of a comeback.\n\nNobody who knew Ernest Payne could ever imagine him being âswept off his feetâ by anyone or anything, yet that was his phrase to describe his experience as a seventeen-year-old when he read Shakespeareâs The Churches at the Crossroads with âits elegant plea for Christian unityâ.30 Small wonder therefore that from his appointment as General Secretary in 1951 to his retirement sixteen years later (and beyond) he was a giant in ecumenism, highly regarded on all sides in BCC and WCC circles, yet he never lost his Baptist roots and convictions, was assiduous in his work for European Baptists, and a consummate diplomat on behalf of Baptists behind the Iron Curtain where he visited several times.Â\n\nOver thirty years on the Council (1959-92) I donât recall him ever fighting his own line, but I do remember him raising relevant issues for consideration, checking unwise extremities and doing all he could either to ensure that Committee recommendations were satisfactorily passed or amended. Criticised by some for being remote and unapproachable, he had a sound pastoral heart and always ready to go the second (even the third) mile where tact and diplomacy were called for.Â\n\nNeither a public speaker nor a charismatic character, leadership to him was spotting what was needed followed by encouragement and support for others who were ready to do it, as âThe Tale of Christian Baptismâ demonstrates. Without his understandlng and support it may never have seen the light of day, nor was this the only door he opened for me, nor was I the only one to have this experience. To work with him, and alongside him, was an inestimable privilege.\n\n(iii) Â BillyandHarringay(1954)\n\n1905 havingÂ trumped 1910, Shakespeareâs mood music fading with time, and the Baptist Revival Fellowship always ready to drum up the conservative beat, Billy Graham arrived in the 50s to turn up the volume. Suddenly Baptist tanks were centre stage and welcomed on everybodyâs âlawnsâ.\n\nTo say that Harringay31 split the denomination would be a gross overstatement, but it certainly highlighted divisions: for some an answer to prayer, for others an unwelcome reminder that Salome was still around. The old tensions between Generals and Particulars were making a comeback.Â Stand by for a bumpy ride. The media loved it â Hollywood razzmatazz, soft lights, sweet music, Cliff Barrows and George Beverly Shea. It put religion in public domain. Other churches, without our Baptist hang-ups, had nothing to match it and Billyâs impact on personal lives was unquestionable, but looking back now after a further fifty years I find myself still with two lingering questions and a powerful memory. Questions first.\n\nNow for the memory. With half the denomination running after Billy others were much more interested in Iona and George Macleod, but it was no surprise when half-way through the Campaign Billy was billed as principal speaker for the Closed Ministerial Session at the Assembly but surprisingly he was to share the platform with George Macleod and it proved a memorable occasion. Perfect for a bit of âhurrah-booâ music hall stuff.\n\nBut then Sydney Morris, thanking George Macleod in his closing speech, paused, gave him aÂ hug, and said, âBut youâre not always rightâ. Loud applause. He then turned to Billy â same thanks,Â same pause, same hug . . . but then, âBut youâre not always right eitherâ. Sydney Morris at his best.\n\n(iv) Â F Townley Lord\n\nErnest Payne, asked by a confused Baptist what to make of it, could only say he found it âpuzzlingâ. Townley Lord, however, took a different view and was fully supportive, and despite not sharing Townleyâs view on Harringay I want to redress the balance, because if Hugh Martin suffered from a lack of recognition Townley may be said to have endured too much, not always favourable, and if I felt a touch of affinity with Hugh Martin, in Townley I always felt a touch of warmth.Â\n\nTownley started my 60-year BT writing career by publishing an unsolicited article on worship in 1952 (six months before I left college} followed closely by another dozen before he retired in 1955. Maybe it was our shared Lancashire genes (we were born and grew up within 10 miles of each other, though 30 years apart) but then my personal feelings were matched quite independently by my wife who as a student in London was a regular attender at Bloomsbury and always paid tribute to the quality of his preaching and pastoral care.\n\nSadly, there were those who felt differently and his liberalism and âwishy-washinessâ were something of a joke in my college days.Â When Ingli James was minister at Cannon Street, Accrington (where Townley grew up)Â Ingli had a gift for âstirringâ, or âcausing troubleâ, and on one occasion Fred Lord (Townleyâs father) decided it was time to intervene. âWhy is it, Mr Jamesâ, said Fred, âthat you always seem to be upsetting people? Why canât you be like our Fred . . . he never upsets anybody?â Possibly true, butÂ Â thatâs not to say he was pusillanimous. He wasnât. It was an unworthy âjokeâ which I relate not to denigrate the man but to show the shallowness of critics who so much enjoyed telling it.Â\n\nAlongside his genial personality, his record speaks for itself. Few others could have so satisfactorily sustained nearly 30 years at Bloomsbury (1930-57), 14 years coterminous with editor of theÂ Baptist TimesÂ (1941-55), often with Tuesday at the printers. He was also an annual visitor to the mid-week lunchtime services in Manchester Central Hall (a regular appointment for Manchesterâs theological student community) alongside Martyn Lloyd-Jones, Weatherhead and Sangster, and when the BT needed an obituary on a relatively unknown public figure an hour in his office proved sufficient to come up with the finished product. In retirement, he spent five years globe-trotting as BWA President and remained a Baptist ambassador to within a couple of years of his death. Few others could have matched it.\n\n(v) Â From HarringaytoNottingham\n\nAs the Mood Music of 1905 faded it was quickly replaced by a quite different Mood Music, for a different audience, and if the starlight of the 50s was Harringay 1905, the star of the 60s was Nottingham 1910, with the 1964 Faith and Order Conference, and its dream of a UK United Church by Easter 1980. Â\n\n550 delegates from 15 denominations. Baptist tanks now firmly established on ecumenical lawns â Ernest Payne, Don Black, Michael Taylor, Neville Clark and the rest. I was Vice Chairman to Donald Allchin in one group and I think Morris West had a similar appointment in another â and with a firm proposal for a united church by 1980. Had Shakespeare been alive, he might have sensed mobilisation round the corner. Alas, no!\n\nFor the British churches it was the nearest we got to the unity we never achieved and by 1980 its failure cried out . . . but was barely noticed. Why? I think two (possibly three) reasons. Â\n\nOne, the resolution did not really arise from the body of the conference and the discussions that took place. It was more the brain child of Horace Dammers, in a panic measure as the end approached and nobody could see the next chapter.\n\nTwo, there was no plan for follow-up. No âChurchillâ to drive the engine.Â\n\nThree, and more tentatively, either the mood in the country was not right (the constituencies needed a lot of work doing on them) or the generals sensed the price they would pay, lacked the conviction that it might be worthwhile, and joined the turkeys who donât vote for Christmas.Â\n\nBy the end of the century âecumenismâ had become a dirty word.\n\n(vi) Â Ecumenism:FailureorSuccess?\n\nSo how do we assess half-a-century of ecumenical endeavour? Was it âall talk and no doâ? Yes and no. Yes in the sense that it failed to achieve what it set out to do and left a lot of unfulfilled dreams and expectations. But No, and for two reasons:\n\n1Â That was the 60s. By the end of the century the world was a different world. Had we gone ahead it would have absorbed a lot of energy we could ill afford. Time also demonstrated that institutional unity was no longer the priority. Unity of purpose, programmes and plans were; so too was an emergent âLocal Ecumenism with a Differenceâ, much of it powered by close personal relationships where time and circumstance were so different.32Â\n\nThe arguments were reasonable and had a certain validity. Church relations and ecumenism cannot be limited to official committees or institutional unity and by the end of the century that seemed to be increasingly recognised, which is why the dissolution of the British Council of Churches was such a tragedy, because if the Nottingham failure was salutary the dissolution of the BCC was to say the least regrettable when local leadership was never more needed at the local level.\n\nPositively the arrival of Applied Theology in our colleges and universities is a big plus, but no substitute for an ecumenical powerhouse with a unique capacity to enable all the churches to relate the gospel together to the wider world, emphasising what is common, refining the excesses and helping all to find their way through the often confusing mists of time.Â\n\nWithout it, where in the 21st century do we cultivate a common Christian thinking on social and political issues leading to common programmes of education for local churches to work on together?\n\n2 The ecumenical environment provided a double spin-off for Baptists. On the one hand it effectively killed the notion (never popular with many Baptists) that what we needed was one big âtankâ combining everybodyâs varying instruments and incompatible software. On the other hand contacts with other churches widened our horizons, gave an incentive to examine our software and their software, and to learn sensitively to share where we could.Â That leaves yet one more unresolved question for the 21st century\n\nAnswers (not on a postcard) call for a separate paper, as I hinted in the case of episcopacy and will return to again when we get to liturgy, but for now let us stay with what actually happened and since the field is vast, and what you see depends on where you look, I therefore propose a whistle-stop tour of the literary output over the third quarter of the century, hopefully leading to Shakespeareâs third issue, âlearning to relate the gospel to the 20th century worldâ.\n\nBefore we âwhislestopâ, however, we need to go back a decade to take a quick look at Tools for Ministry, which in 1952 amounted to little more than Wheeler Robinson (1925),33 Frank Bryan (1943),34 Henry Cook (1947),35Â AC Underwood (1947)36 and RC Walton (1946) challenging the status quo (were we a Church of a Sect?) with The Gathered Community.37\n\nOrdination, for example, (first recognised in 1922), was still a questionable âfeastâ, leading to a spat in the 40s between Dakin,38 who wanted Ordination to relate only to a single church and to be repeated on each move, and Payne with a broader view which carried the day in 1948, leading to an official statement by the Council,39 an Enlarged Edition of The Fellowship of Believers (1952), a further Statement on Ordination (1954),40 and a fuller Report on Ministry,1961).41\n\nSo how did Baptists respond when from the 60s to the 80s we were suddenly, plunged into a world where all the churches (though not necessarily allÂ the members) were going head over heels to reinterpet the gospel for a new world order, and the question to keep in mind is how much of this would have happened if Shakespeare had not given us a nudge get out there and get in the swim.\n\nTheology in theÂ 60s was hardly a re-run of Shakespeareâs first decade but had he been around I think he might have felt at home with a touch of deja vue or even deus vult in the world ofÂ Tillich,42Â Bonhoeffer,43Â Honest to God,44Â Teilard de Chardin,45Â Harry Williams46Â and Soundings,47Â van Buren48Â and Harvey Cox,49Â sensing the change in the atmosphere and wanting to be part of it.\n\nTrue, we didnât have a Shakespeare but we did have a small coterie of ministers who picked up the vibes and wanted the Baptists to be part of the action (Something for All), emulating Shakespeareâs desire to see Baptists not only putting tanks on lawns but mobilising 20th century tanks for 20th century theology: gospel, scholarship and action.\n\nSomething for All\n\nWas this not also the Century when Baptists discovered Liturgy . . . and then lost it again? For the first fifty years of the 20th century we hardly knew what liturgy was. Sunday services were âa hymn sandwichâ, the sermon dominated, preceded by âthe preliminariesâ which often bore little relation to each other.\n\nAubrey, in the 1940s, was the first to dip his toe in the water withÂ A Ministerâs Manual,60Â little more than basic ministerial guidance for Births, Marriages and Deaths, but a significant start. Post 1960, thanks toÂ Stephen Winward,Â with encouragement from Ernest Payne,Â Orders and Prayers for Church WorshipÂ provided a feast ofÂ liturgical material,61 Â some of which found its way intoÂ The Baptist HymnbookÂ (1962), for all manner of occasions. This was slimmed down somewhat inÂ Praise God,62Â which concentrated more on basic weekly pastoral needs, followed ten years later byÂ Patterns and Prayers for Christian Worship,63Â making good the deficiencies ofÂ Praise GodÂ without going all the way back to Payne and Winward.\n\nDespite some initial resistance the movement made a distinctive contribution to Sunday worship which came to be generally not only accepted but appreciated, but then by the end of the 80s (Salome again) the storm cones were out; two in particular. One was the indifference, if not downright opposition, to Baptist Praise and Worship (1991). The other, identified by Bernard Green in the Preface to Patterns and Prayers for Christian Worship, reflected\n\nTime will tell. My first impression is simply that most churches have ditched liturgy and gone back to the preliminaries and a hymn-sandwich, though limited experience leads me to believe it approximates more to a soufflÃ© than a sandwich. No meat, no protein, little nourishing and nothing likely to give me a mild headache or a bit of indigestion, without which health is at risk.\n\nWith the exception of Michael TaylorâsÂ Variations on a Theme,64Â however, what we never achieved was a serious study of Liturgy as against the provision of liturgical material, and when I ask why two further questions come into play.\n\nThe traffic, however, was not all in one direction. Salome, enjoying a brief somnolence following the setting up of the Baptist Revival Fellowship65Â in 1938, was given a wake-up call with the changing mood of the 60s and the arrival of the Baptist Renewal Group66Â which appeared as a counter force, but after a brief 'bumpy ride' a change of leadership in the Union tempered BRFâs antagonistic approach, making way for Mainstream67 in the 70s, a calming influence which steadied the ship to the end of the century.\n\n3 Â TheGospelinthe20thCentury\n\nSo where does that leave us with Shakespeareâs third point: ârelating the gospel to the 20th century worldâ? Â Three points.\n\n(i) Â Language\n\nThe gap between everyday language and church language throughout the century was phenomenal. Church language was so âyesterdayâ and too often âthe-day-before-yesterdayâ. Maybe it was less of a problem in Shakespeareâs time, but had he been around in the 60s I am sure Language would haveÂ been be high on his agenda. We were not good at talking, and even worse writing, about matters of faith in the common language ofÂ the people.Â\n\nOne key to improvement lies with the editors of church papers at all levels, from the village church to the national broadsheet or website. In an attempt to keep on board their readers who like to read news in traditional church language they seem slow to realise that they are missing out on so many for whom that style and language have no meaning whatsoever, and these are the very people who most need the church andÂ the church needs them.\n\n(ii) Â Content\n\nGiven an opportunity anywhere to talk about the Gospel, what did we focus on? Reviewing a recent collection of articles by Harvey Cox68Â (a leading Baptist light of the 1960s in the USA) my attention was drawn to a couple of quotes69Â from two distinguished mid-century Asian ecumenical leaders: one from MM Thomas,70\n\nand the other from DT Niles,71\n\nWhether Shakespeare would have put it like that is debatable, but I like to think that had he been there at the time he would have approved.Â\n\n(iii)Â ActionÂ\n\nOn this point most of Shakespeareâs agenda worked fine for the first half of the century, increasingly Clifordian (practical action) rather than Spurgeonic (dotrinal), but once some of that pioneering became redundant with inevitable social change, and the Gospel successfully shamed the State into taking over responsibility for some of the others, I find a loss of momentum. It wasnât that there were no issues. The womenâs battles were not done and dusted once we got women ministers and a few more women on our committees. Inequality and harassment in the workplace were not waiting in the wings but very much alive on the shop floor, and though the whole range of current gender issues has emerged in the 21st century the seeds were there long before. Local responses to emergencies (debt, homelessness, food banks, refugees, &c,) I think held up well but what I find lacking is that pioneering thrust which turns gospel proclamation into gospel action leading to the transformation of society. Which brings me to my last question:\n\nHave we paid too much attention to the apostles\n\nand too little to the prophets?\n\nWhen it comes to relating the Gospel to the world the prophets can be an excellent starting point. Not what they said nor what they did (both largely irrelevant in todayâs world), but rather the prophetic skill for seizing the moment and identifying God in it. Harold Macmillanâs âEvents, dear boyâ was the staple diet of the prophets. which brings me to my final personality of the century, David Russell.\n\n(iv) Â DavidSRussell\n\nNot one you would immediately associate with the prophets. Hardly a Clifford, though his sympathies all pointed in that direction. Neither was he an Ernest Payne, but one thing they had in common was a commitment to Europe and Human Rights, fortifying a British Baptist commitment to Europe going back to Rushbrooke. Both made substantial, if slightly different, contributions. Both battled in a Cold War environment and for David the focus was on the churchesâ educational and literature requirements, particularly as Chair of the EBF Books and Translations Committee for a decade, where I worked closely with him and succeeded him as Chair.\n\nDavid wanted money for European Baptists. His office prevented him from specialised fundraising. I wanted Feed the Minds72Â to open up a front in Europe but had no contacts. A marriage was arranged. EUROLIT was the result and the partnership flourished. David promoted the cause among Baptists. EUROLIT evaluated the projects in collaboration with his Committee.\n\nDavidâs initial commitment was in a co-operative effort (European Baptists, US Southern Baptists, and Mennonites), to translate the William Barclay commentaries into Russian. In that, EUROLIT had a minor role, more in the technicalities than in finance. In line with EUROLIT policy the Books and Translations Committee was directed more at providing small machinery, paper, technical advice and training, to enable the European churches to do the job of writing, printing, publishing and marketing themselves.Â One of the first projects was making Rowleyâs Bible Atlas available in Poland and Hungary. One of the last and most substantial was financial support for the Reformed Church of Hungary not long before the end of the Cold War when the Hungarian Government agreed to Religious Education in State schools, and handed over the whole operation to the Reformed Church who had no expertise or professionalism in the field and no money to do it.Â With Russellâs drive and Baptist generosity, EUROLIT supplied them with both.\n\nThe initial (EBF/Eurolit) target was Â£10,000 pa. Over two decades grants totalled Â£200,000, half from Baptist sources and half from others, providing Â£20,000 for mini-libraries for 300 Baptist Eastern Europe pastors and Â£40,000 for Hungarian RE textbooks for schools.73Â David was a prophet and an Old Testament scholar. In Hebrew dabhar knows little distinction between âwordâ and âdeedâ, and neither did David. Much more could be said about Davidâs wider contribution but for this purpose suffice it to focus on that European programme which was so dear to his heart that he insisted it be one of three tributesÂ at his Memorial Service.\n\nDenouement\n\nAs for Shakespeare, were he to return, I like to think he would still be a John the Baptist, sensing something in the atmosphere, different in detail from that first foggy morning, but reassuring himself in the words of Robert Browning, one of his favourite poets,\n\nâGodâs in his heavenâ\n\nAllâs right with the worldâ (Pippa Passes)Â\n\nor still singing (courtesy of Edward Burns,) we haveÂ\n\nâa gospel to proclaim, good news for all throughout the earthâ (BPW 585)\n\neven if Burns did stop halfway, because âProclamationâ is but one step to âPracticeâ and the prophetic role includes the battle to achieve. Todayâs language, in todayâs world, transcending any and every biblical text, ecclesiastical doctrine or theological dogma.Â\n\nFocussed, simply and literally, on that âgood newsâ, having begun with John the Baptist, let me end with John the Evangelist. Iâll take the liberty of substituting âgood newsâ for logos and then emulating TW Manson74Â with the emphasis on the words in bold type\n\nâIn the beginning was good news,\n\nand good news . . . was with God,\n\nand good news . . . was God.\n\nÂ Â"
