This document provides an introduction to the classification system of “religious groups” defined by the author, with the amplification of the typology by means of an annotated outline that seeks to define the origin, the historical development and the particular doctrines of each Major Religious Tradition, Family and Subfamily that exists in the Americas, particulary in Latin America and among Hispanics in the USA and Canada.

This paper argues that the Regular and Separate Baptists differed less theologically, that they shared a common theological outlook, and a common concern for lost sinners, but diverged in certain aspects of practice as a result of social context. Both Regular and Separate Baptists felt the effects of the evangelical Calvinism of the First Great Awakening, giving them a basis for maintaining God’s sovereignty in salvation and a motive for taking the gospel to any who would hear. In the end, what made the Separates more successful than the Regulars in the hinterlands may have been a matter of cross-cultural communication.
