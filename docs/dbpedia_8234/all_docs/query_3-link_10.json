        "text": "The Ranchería People\n\nAs the Spaniards moved northward during the 1500s and 1600s, they found an amazing diversity of indigenous groups. Unlike the more concentrated Amerindian groups of central Mexico, the Indians of the north were referred to as “ranchería people” by the Spaniards. Their fixed points of settlements (rancherías) were usually scattered over an area of several miles and one dwelling may be separated from the next by up to half a mile.\n\nThe renowned anthropologist, Professor Edward H. Spicer (1906-1983), writing in Cycles of Conquest: The Impact of Spain, Mexico, and the United States on the Indians of the Southwest, 1533-1960, stated that most ranchería people were agriculturalists and farming was their primary activity, but they also supplemented their crops with hunting and gathering. They generally had a decentralized political structure, with no single tribal chief.\n\nTotorame\n\nThe Totorame tribe occupied the coast of Sinaloa from Mazatlán and the Piaxtla River southward. Their territory extended inward into Nayarit and included the primary settlements of\n\nAztatlán, Sentispac and Chametla, the latter on the Baluarte River and the first two in Nayarit territory.\n\nThe Totorame were closely related to the Cora Indians of Nayarit and belonged to the Aztecoidan linguistic group. The geographer Carl O. Sauer estimated the aboriginal Totorame population at 100,000, with a population density of 10 people per square kilometer. Also known as the Pinome, they inhabited the Sinaloa coastal strip south of the Piaxtla River and extended inland into parts of present-day Nayarit.\n\nThe sedentary Totorames were farmers, cultivating corn, beans, squash, chili and cotton. They consumed sea products and collected salt from natural deposits for their own consumption and for trade with other groups. The Totorames were not aggressive people, but had to defend themselves frequently against the Xiximes and Acaxees who came down from the sierras to take away their crops on a regular basis.\n\nInhabiting the area that included the present-day city of Concordia, the Totorames achieved their greatest achievements in pottery, agriculture and fishing. A short history of the Municipio of Concordia, declares that the influence of the Totorame culture in that area was “extraordinary.” People who visit the remains of their settlements today can see vestiges of a once great culture.\n\nTahue\n\nThe Tahue Indians occupied the lowlands between the Piaxtla and Mocorito rivers with their main settlement at Culiacán. From a cultural standpoint, they were very similar to their southern neighbors, the Totorames. One of the main Tahue towns was Culiacán. The Tahue were farmers, cultivating corn, beans, squash, chili, cotton, guava and plum, but they also picked wild fruits. They fished in both the rivers and the sea, where they obtained a great variety of fish and seafood that constituted an important part of their diet. They collected salt from the numerous natural deposits that form on the coast. The Tahues were also skilled potters, who produced pieces of ceramics beautifully decorated for domestic use. Like their Totorame neighbors, the Tahue were peaceful people and only practiced defensive war when it was necessary to do so.\n\nAccording to Cuarta Relacion Andnima (1955), Tahue men were described as highly tattooed and the women considered to be the most beautiful encountered along the Sinaloa coast.\n\nThe Acaxees and Xiximes\n\nAt the highest points of the Sierra Madre Occidental, east of the region occupied by Tahues and Totorames, lived the Acaxees and Xiximes, in a territory that the Spaniards called the Sierra de Topia. Both groups had very similar lifestyles and similar languages, belonging to the Taracahitian branch of the Uto-Aztecan linguistic stock.\n\nHowever, in spite of their cultural similarities, the Acaxees and Xiximes were irreconcilable enemies. For the most part, both groups occupied the western region of the current state of Durango, but their western limits were within what is today known as Sinaloa. Life in the rugged Sierras forced the Acaxees and Xiximes to live in small communities that were scattered through a sizable area. Both groups practiced agriculture and cultivated small plots where the land allowed it, usually planting corn, beans, squash and chili.\n\nThe Cáhitan Language Group\n\nAt the time of the Spanish contact, the Cáhita group of tribes were living in pueblos and permanent villages along the banks of the Mocorito, Sinaloa, Fuerte, Mayo and Yaqui Rivers in the coastal regions of both southern Sonora and northern Sinaloa. Speaking eighteen closely related dialects, the Cáhitan group is part of the Uto-Aztecan Language Group and is most closely related to the Pima and Cora languages.\n\nNumbering about 115,000 at contact, the Cáhitans were the most numerous of any single language group in northern Mexico and included the famous Yaqui and Mayo ethnic groups, who lived along the middle and lower portions of the valleys of the Yaqui, Mayo and Fuerte rivers in the southern Sonora and northern Sinaloa. Other Cahitan groups included the Bamoa, Sinaloa, Ocoroni, Zuaque and Tehueco, all of which are now culturally extinct. Living in the fertile valleys along these rivers, most of the Cáhita engaged in agricultural pursuits, growing corn, cotton, calabashes, beans, and tobacco, and also in cultivating the mezcal-producing agave.\n\nThe Cahitan cultures were less developed than those of the Tahues and Totorames, but there is a great deal more information about them due, among other factors, to the fact that they were evangelized by Jesuit missionaries, who were constant observers of the customs of their parishioners. Many of the Cáhitans were semi-nomadic, lacking permanent settlements and moving periodically within a large territory, which they recognized as their own and which they defended energetically if they were invaded by neighboring groups.\n\nGuasave and Achires\n\nThe Guasaves and Achires inhabited the marshes of the coast between the San Lorenzo and Fuerte rivers. They were the only groups whose language differed markedly from the Cáhitans. They did not practice agriculture and primarily relied on fishing, hunting and gathering of wild fruits.\n\nThe Guasave Indians lived along the Pacific coastline of Sinaloa between the Estero de Agiabampo and the San Lorenzo River. This group was presumably a subclass of the Cáhita-Opata and Tarachitian family, similar to the Comopori, Ahome, Vacoregue and Achire (all now extinct groups). The Ahome were a division of the Guasave living near the mouth of the Fuerte River.\n\nThe Colonial Period (1531-1821)\n\nFrom March 1531 to Mexican independence in 1822, the Spaniards of Colonial Sinaloa dealt with a large group of indigenous peoples, settling in their territory and occasionally fighting wars against them. Although Sinaloa’s northern neighbor Sonora continued to wage war on its Mayo and Yaqui residents well into the 20th Century, most of Sinaloa became pacified by the time of independence.\n\nDuring the colonial period, the Tahue, Totorame, Acaxees, Xiximes and the numerous Cáhitan speaking groups became assimilated into Spanish colonial society. However, they assimilated, but they did not disappear. They were transformed into Mexican citizens. And many of Sinaloa’s current inhabitants descend from these groups.\n\nIn the recent 2015 Mexican Intercensal, 12.83% of Sinaloa’s 2,966,321 citizens considered themselves (Se considera) to be of indigenous background by culture. And four Sinaloa municipios had populations in which more than 25% of their residents claimed to be of indigenous background: El Fuerte (43.47%), Choiz (39.38%), Elota (28.78%) and Ahome (28.49%).\n\nIndigenous People in the 1921 Census\n\nIn the unique 1921 Mexican census, residents of each state were asked to classify themselves in several categories, including “indígena pura” (pure indigenous), “indígena mezclada con blanca” (indigenous mixed with white) and “blanca” (white). Out of a total state population of 341,265, only 3,163 individuals (0.9%) claimed to be of pure indigenous background. A much larger number – 335,474, or 98.3% – classified themselves as being mixed.\n\nIndigenous Languages Spoken in Sinaloa in 2010\n\nThe 2010 Mexican census revealed that nearly half of the 23,841 indigenous language speakers 3 years and older in the State of Sinaloa spoke the Mayo language. The other 46 languages spoken in the state were languages transplanted from other states, including:\n\nNáhuatl (2,136 speakers — 9.0% of all indigenous speakers)\n\nTarahumara (1,864 speakers — 7.8%)\n\nMixteco (1,646 speakers — 6.9%)\n\nZapoteco (1,319 speakers — 5.5%)\n\nYaqui (325 speakers — 1.4%)\n\nPurépecha (Tarasco) — 239 speakers — 1.0%)\n\nWhile the Tarahumara are primarily from Chihuahua, the Yaquis are from Sonora. In addition, the Purépecha originated from Michoacán, while the Mixtecs and Zapotecs come from the State of Oaxaca. For this reason, the Mayo language is the only language truly indigenous to Sinaloa. All other languages are transplants from other regions.\n\nCopyright © 2019 by John P. Schmal.
