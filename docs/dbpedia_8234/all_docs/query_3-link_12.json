        "text": "A farmer’s paradise with an extraordinary cuisine that reflects the bounty of its land and coast\n\nStretching along northern Mexico’s west coast, Sinaloa is nicknamed “Mexico’s breadbasket” because it produces 40% of the food for the entire country. Its extraordinary cuisine reflects the bounty of the land and coast and is a source of pride for its people. It’s known for chilorio, especially from Mocorito, which is one of Sinaloa’s many “pueblos mágicos” or magic towns. And its long Pacific coast, home to the destination city of Mazatlán that’s called “the pearl of the Pacific,” is packed with shrimp.\n\nDive into Sinaloa Content →\n\nSinaloa\n\nA farmer’s paradise
