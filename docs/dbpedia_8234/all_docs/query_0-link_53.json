        "text": "Michael McCabe\n\nManaging Director\n\nMiguel Angel FÃ©lix Gallardo, known as âThe Godfatherâ was one of the founders of the Guadalajara Cartel.\n\nHe was one of the first drug lords to spread drug dealing on a large scale in Mexico. At first, he worked as âmadrinaâ for the federal police, meaning he worked as a police agent who carries out espionage or other clandestine services. During the 1960âs he worked as bodyguard for the Governor of Mexico, Leopoldo SÃ¡nchez Celisâ children, at the same time he started drug dealing. Gradually, he grew his organisation which trafficked poppy and marijuana in the states of Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua, Baja California, Jalisco, Guerrero and Nayarit.\n\nDuring the 1980âs the Guadalajara Cartel emerged becoming the most powerful cartel, by that time Miguel Gallardo had made contacts with Colombian criminal gangs. In the mid-1980âs a United States DEA agent, Enrique Camarena, was tortured and murdered by the cartel. Following this incident, the Mexican government focused on dismantling the Guadalajara Cartel. Miguel Gallardo split up his territory in 1987, creating other cartels to make the complete dismantling of the organisation difficult.\n\nThe Mexican Public Prosecutorâs Office has recently revealed that there are currently 36 criminal cells linked to nine different cartels which operate in Mexico. Anotnio Luigi Mazzitelli, representative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean presented a report âÂ¿Mafias en Mexico?â in 2016 where he describes the origins and growth of Mexican cartels. He declared that five of the Mexican cartels are weaker than before due to internal fighting: Los Arellano FÃ©lix, Familia Michoacan, Caballeros Templarios, Juarez Cartel and Los Zetas cartel. The other three have ensured stability and security, and the one left, CJNG, is the strongest cartel nowadays.\n\nThe Cartel of Jalisco New Generation (CJNG)\n\nIt is the most prominent cartel today in Mexico. They recruit finance experts and well-connected people who have a US visa or contacts in the European Union.\n\nORIGIN: It was originally one of the cells under El Chapoâs control for Jalisco, Colima, MichoacÃ¡n and Veracruz, however it is now one of the most powerful Mexican cartels. According to Panama Papers, the groupâs leader, âEl Menchoâ was under the command of Ignacio Coronel (Sinaloa Cartel lieutenant) whose death caused a split in his Jalisco-based organization, as âEl Menchoâ wanted to take his place, however, did not and therefore formed his own cartel. CJNG has taken advantage of the serious blows dealt to other drug cartels (Sinaloa, Caballeros Templarios and Zetas) by authorities.\n\nLEADER: Led by Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, also known as âEl Menchoâ, former local policeman of Cabo Corrientes, a village on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nNemesio Oseguera Cervantes\n\nCELLS: Associated with the Cuinis*, led by Abigael Gonzalez Valencia and his brothers (CuÃ±ados Mencho).\n\nAREAS OF INFLUENCE: Jalisco, Colima, MichoacÃ¡n, Guanajuato, Nayarit, Guerrero, Morelos and Veracruz State.\n\nCRIMINAL ACTIVITY: Extortion, drug dealing and fuel-theft.

Considered both him and his mother by the US government as operators of Sinaloa cartel\n\n**Los Cuinis: principal associate of CJNG has dealt in cocaine and methamphetamines since the 90âs. Their leader was Abigail Gonzalez Valencia who was arrested last February at Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco State, he was Nemesioâs brother in law.\n\nThe Cartel of Sinaloa (CDS)\n\nIt is one of the largest drug-trafficking organization in the world. They seldom seek confrontation with the state. One of the groupâs features is that the majority of its members are relatives or locals, therefore they share values and ethics giving the cartel more cohesion.\n\nORIGIN: Pedro Aviles Perez was one of the pioneer drug lords in the State of Sinaloa. He was killed during a skirmish with police in 1978. The second generation of Sinaloan drug dealers were Rafael Caro Quintero, Miguel Ãngel FÃ©lix Gallardo, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo and JoaquÃ­n âEl Chapoâ GuzmÃ¡n.

It was linked to Colombian cartels: Cali and MedellÃ­n cartel and Juan RamÃ³n Matta Ballesteros, also known as âDon Mattaâ or âEl Negroâ a drug dealer in Honduras who was the main intermediary between Mexican and Colombian drug lords.
