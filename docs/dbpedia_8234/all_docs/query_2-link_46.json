It’s a daily lunch, a date, a late-night dinner outing, a mandatory stop after school or after prom, and even the perfect way to satisfy a pregnancy craving. Many cannot easily resist the tacos al pastor, a carne asada burrito, tacos de tripa.”\n\nEAST BAY EXPRESS\n\nDestination-Worthy Tacos in the East Bay\n\n“One of the classics in Fruitvale, there’s really no wrong order at Tacos Sinaloa #2. All of the proteins are well-composed and flavorful, but it’s hard not to fall totally in love with the carnitas and cabeza tacos.”\n\nSF EATER\n\nThe Currys celebrated the end of the Warriors parade at this legendary Oakland spot\n\n“Depending on where your taco allegiance lies, Tacos Sinaloa is often considered among the best, if not the best, place for tacos in Oakland. The food truck on International Blvd., is famous for its selection of delicious meats, deployed in both taco and burrito form.”\n\nSFGATE"
