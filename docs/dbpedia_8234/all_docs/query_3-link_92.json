Stroll through Mazatlan’s Historic Downtown\n\nAlthough Mazatlan has made a name for itself as a beach destination, it is an old city founded in the 16th century by the first wave of conquistadors, who needed ports to send their exploited wealth back to Spain.\n\nOld Mazatlan is a piece of heaven with its streets and traditional buildings, including the cathedral, several small squares, the Angela Peralta Theater, the Archeology Museum, and cozy outdoor cafes.\n\n2. Cathedral Basilica\n\nThe city’s main Catholic temple is an eclectic building in the historic center.\n\nIt was completed in 1899 and has two bodied towers, three naves of the same height, and an octagonal dome.\n\nThe main facade has three pointed arches with neo-Gothic lines. The main altar is of Gothic style and shows beautiful images carved in Carrara marble.\n\nAt the back of the main altar is a magnificent sculpture of the Immaculate Conception, to whom the basilica was consecrated.\n\n3. Angela Peralta Theater\n\nThe Mexican soprano Ángela Peralta Castera gained worldwide fame in the 19th century when she was called El Ruiseñor Mexicano (The Mexican Nightingale).\n\nShe toured Europe three times, taking her privileged voice to the great opera stages of Milan, Rome, St. Petersburg, Madrid, and other cities, and on her return to Mexico, she made national tours.\n\nShe died in Mazatlán at the age of 38, a victim of a yellow fever epidemic.\n\nThe Sinaloan city honored her by naming the town’s main theater after her, an imposing building in the historic center restored in the 1990s.\n\n4. República, Machado, and Hidalgo Square\n\nMazatlan is also known for its small landscaped plazas in the historic center.\n\nThe Plazuela República is the most emblematic and prestigious for its surrounding buildings, including the cathedral, the municipal palace, and the old Post and Telegraph buildings.\n\nIt has a beautiful kiosk of French lines. The oldest square in the city is the Machado, dating from 1837, with a kiosk installed in 1881.\n\nPlazuela Hidalgo is the second oldest and was the site of the first market in the port of Mazatlan. It is also called Plaza de Los Leones because of its sculptures.\n\nIn its center, a kiosk was demolished to build two libraries.\n\nThe Plazuela Zaragoza was formerly called Puerto Viejo because of its proximity to the city’s old port and has a beautiful kiosk.\n\nDomestic animals used to graze on the grounds of Plazuela Angel Flores, which is why it is also known as Plaza del Burro (Donkey Square).\n\n5. Mazatlan Boardwalk (El Malecon)\n\nThe modern space that symbolizes Mazatlan is its long and active boardwalk.\n\nIn its 21 kilometers in front of the ocean, there are spectacular beaches, open-air art, natural formations, and all the establishments and services demanded by tourists.\n\nOne of its busiest sectors is the one in front of Olas Altas beach.\n\nHere you can admire monuments such as the Sinaloa State Coat of Arms, El Venado, the Mazatlecan Woman, the Continuity of Life, and the one erected by the legendary singer and actor Pedro Infante, the best-known Mazatlecan.\n\n6. Mazatlan Beaches: Can you swim in the ocean?\n\nMazatlan has paradisiacal swimmable beaches and a first-class hotel and service network to make your vacations in the Pearl of the Pacific unforgettable.\n\nOlas Altas, the city’s most traditional beach, is in the Old Mazatlan sector, in front of the boardwalk.\n\nGaviotas Beach is very active in the Golden Zone because of its calm sea that invites you to swim.\n\nBecause of its width, Gaviotas is frequented by those who practice sand sports, such as volleyball and beach soccer.\n\nCamarón Sábalo, to the north of Gaviotas, is a beach with moderate swell that can occasionally become quite rough, good for surfing.\n\nOthers are Playa Norte, Cerritos, El Delfín, Isla Venados and Isla de La Piedra.\n\n7. Venados Island\n\nVenados is the largest of 3 islands located 2.3 kilometers off the coast.\n\nIt is colloquially called Isla del Medio for being in the middle of the island group, guarded by Isla de Chivos and Isla de Pájaros, and has almost virgin beaches.\n\nVenados is frequented for its clear and calm waters, ideal for underwater entertainment.
