        "text": "Sinaloa is a state of Mexico that is located in the northwest of the country. Located between the Sierra Madre Occidental (a mountainous group that goes from Arizona to Jalisco) and the Pacific Ocean. It is located in a privileged place in resources and landscapes, and that, together with its people, makes this a special place on the planet.\n\nWe share some curious facts that perhaps you did not know about this state so that you are encouraged to visit it. Or if you already have, or live in it, so you have more information to brag about.\n\n1. It is one of the main food producers in the country\n\nThe state of Sinaloa is in position 5 in the states that produce the most agricultural products year after year, with an estimated total of 12 million tons of products. Among them, the production of grain corn stands out, with a total of 6 million tons, making it the main producer of white corn in the country.\n\nSo, you may already have had a taste of Sinaloa simply by consuming a tortilla made from corn.\n\n2. It has 11 rivers that give life to the region\n\nThe development of the state cannot be understood without talking about the natural importance of the rivers that cross it. Most of the settlements have been formed in the vicinity of these waters, which provide a source of irrigation for agriculture but are also the scene where the daily life of Sinaloa takes place.\n\n3. More than 30 mother tongues are spoken\n\nIn addition to Spanish, which is the language most spoken by Sinaloans, there is a large number of mother tongues spoken by people who emigrate to the state from different parts of the country. The Mayo and the Tepehuano are officially recognized as original and the Tarahumara, the Mexiquense. But there are studies that recognize communities that speak Triqui, Mixtec, Zapotec, Nahuatl, and many others. Without a doubt, it is a reflection of the cultural diversity of the country.\n\n4. It has a diversity of archaeological sites\n\nAs an indelible trace of the passage of the different peoples that have inhabited the region, there remain some archaeological remains distributed throughout the state, and perhaps many more still undiscovered.\n\nThe site “Las Labradas” stands out, where there are rocks engraved on the shores of the ocean, with elements of the cosmovision of the ancient Sinaloan settlers; Chametla, one of the oldest settlements in America, and “El Calón”, the only pyramid in Sinaloa, made from seashells.\n\n5. It is the only place in Mexico where the Mesoamerican ball game is practiced: ulama\n\nThis ball game is associated with the one formerly played by the Aztec and Mayan cultures, where they used different parts of the body, usually the hips in the south of the state, and the forearm in the north, to hit a leather ball towards another team. until one of them failed to return the ball.\n\nToday it is still practiced in a traditional way in the south and north of the state and means a direct connection with our ancestors.\n\n6. The word Sinaloa means “round dragon fruit”\n\nIt is believed that it comes from the word cahíta “sina” which means pitahaya and “lobola” which means “round in shape”. So it is assumed that at the beginning he referred to the region as “sinalobola” which later became Sinaloa.\n\nThe pitahaya is a fruit that is considered exotic in other parts of the world, and whose cultivation has spread to other parts, but its origin lies in Mexico, where its varieties are widely consumed.\n\n7. The Mazatlán Carnival is a celebration that is more than 100 years old.\n\nWhat is now one of the most important carnivals in the country, began as a celebration in 1898 in the port of Mazatlán. Currently, it is made up of an international festival with events over 5 days, in which attendees enjoy music, special events, dances, parades and food. It has undoubtedly become one of the main tourist events in the state.\n\n8. Banda’s music has German roots\n\nThe Mexican musical genre is known as “banda” or “Sinaloan band” has its origins in the late 1800s, when brass instruments such as trumpet, trombone and tuba entered the country, with which the inhabitants of each region began to compose songs in their own style.\n\nHowever, due to the European settlements that existed in the state of Sinaloa during the time, the influence of this musical style is remarkable. Mainly the styles of the Bavarian polka, characteristic of Germany, are noticed. Currently, the Sinaloan band is listened to by millions of people in Spanish-speaking countries.\n\n9. There is a great variety of climates and landscapes in the state\n\nDespite not being one of the largest states, different types of climates and landscapes can be found in Sinaloa, which also creates different habitats for a wide variety of animals and plants.\n\nIn a single day of travel, you can go from seeing a snowy landscape in the mountains, between cabins and pine trees, to being on a sunny beach with cacti and seagulls. Any corner of the state can become a beautiful postcard that will remain in the memory of all who visit.\n\nSource: tusbuenasnoticias.com"
