Caro-Quintero also has previous ties to Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, and Costa Rica.\n\nCaution:\n\nRafael Caro-Quintero is wanted for his alleged involvement in the kidnapping and murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent in 1985, in Mexico. Additionally, Caro-Quintero allegedly holds an active key leadership position directing the activities of the Sinaloa Cartel and the Caro-Quintero Drug Trafficking Organization within the region of Badiraguato, Sinaloa, Mexico.\n\n(From U.S. Department of state narcotics and rewards)\n\nALIASES:\n\nDOB: October 24, 1952\n\nPOB: Mexico\n\nNATIONALITY: Mexican\n\nCITIZENSHIP: Mexico\n\nHEIGHT: 6 feet\n\nWEIGHT: 160 Pounds\n\nHAIR COLOR: Grey\n\nEYE COLOR: Brown\n\nRafael Caro Quintero is indicted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California on numerous U.S. federal felony charges.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1984, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) special agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena investigated the drug trafficking organization of Rafael Caro-Quintero and others in Mexico, which was responsible for the cultivation and ultimate distribution of over 10,000 tons of marijuana in the United States. The DEA investigation led to drug seizures that severely damaged the organization. Beginning in 1984, members of the Caro-Quintero organization engaged in a series of actions to retaliate against the DEA and in 1985 Caro-Quintero and others murdered John Clay Walker and Alberto Radelat, U.S. nationals who were mistakenly thought to be DEA agents. Later in 1985, Caro-Quintero and others kidnapped, tortured, and murdered Agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena and Alfredo Zavala Avelar, a pilot who was assisting Special Agent Camarena.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State is currently offering a REWARD OF UP TO $20 MILLION for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Rafael Caro-Quintero.\n\nwww.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/rafael-caro-quintero\n\nwww.state.gov/j/inl/narc/rewards/275634.htm\n\nwww.dea.gov/fugitives/la/DC666E8E-4281-4FB5-B803-9773F40868F0.shtml\n\nAny thoughts?? The stakes are high now on the Top Ten List, with the “Narco of Narcos” being amongst them. Also I’m confident he’s going to be caught soon since they have an image of him from when they did an interview with him in 2016.\n\nAdmin Note #1: According to his FBI wanted poster, If you have any information concerning the whereabouts of Rafael Caro-Quintero, please call 1-800-CALL-FBI or contact your nearest American Embassy or Consulate.\n\nAdmin Note #2: If you have any news-related updates on this case, please contact us here: amwfans.com/thread/1662/website-contact-form\n\nPost by тσρтєиhυитєя on\n\nThe reward is now the highest of anyone currently on the list, and in this case it appears they just increased it from $5M to $20M. I think this is what the list needed after the removal of Victor Gerena. One would think this guy would have been added to the FBI Criminal Enterprises section, but this the one exception since this is a case I’ve heard about and i would love to see some closure here.\n\nLet’s hope this is a quick capture since he alleges on his interview in 2016 that he’s not a drug trafficker (obviously he still is) and that he doesn’t have any beef with “El Chapo” Guzmán, and here’s an article from today stating that a month ago the government sent troops to find RCQ dead or alive.\n\nwww.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/the-fbi-just-put-the-narco-of-narcos-on-its-10-most-wanted-list/ar-AAvOUvF?li=BBnbcA1\n\nAlso here’s the press release video\n\nt.co/gOHbZBMrPJ\n\nAnd the translation of the interview from recently.\n\nwww.borderlandbeat.com/2018/04/english-translation-of-new-rafael-caro.html?m=1\n\nPost by Scumhunter on\n\nOh wow, I was very familiar with Mr. Caro-Quintero but this is still perhaps the most unexpected addition or additions since Semion Mogilevich and Eduardo Ravelo back in 2009. I know we said the open slot could go to a cold case, but wasn't expecting THIS cold case.\n\n20 million dollar reward, even $100K gets the public off their butts, let alone 20 MILLION but still feel this is more a put pressure on Mexico addition.\n\nI've been very critical of the war on drugs as while not condoning drugs but I feel the war has been a failure, but there are some guys that are so evil like \"El Chapo\" Guzman that you put your differences aside and say \"this guy needs to be caught.\"\n\nCaro-Quintero allegedly falls into that El Chapo category and also allegedly was involved in the murder of a DEA agent and that is unforgivable.\n\nThe question is how easy or difficult will the manhunt be, even with the top ten list. We will wait and see.\n\nPost by тσρтєиhυитєя on\n\nOh wow, I was very familiar with Mr. Caro-Quintero but this is still perhaps the most unexpected addition or additions since Semion Mogilevich and Eduardo Ravelo back in 2009.

We will wait and see.\n\nAlso it puts into perspective why there’s a huge reward difference between Eduardo Ravelo and Rafael Caro-Quintero, 1 is a hitman and the other an actual cartel boss in case since many have that misconception about Eduardo Ravelo.\n\nToday definitely feels like we went back to the 1990s or 2000s since various drug traffickers from Mexico, some of whom were associates with Caro-Quintero, were added in the 90s. Deign Montoya Sanchez was added in 2004. Many of them last from 5 months to 4 years on the top ten list.\n\nI don’t think this case is as cold as we think, but when your talking about Drug Cartels and terrorists, be prepared for an exhausting several years. But this case is an exception since we have an image from 2016 and there’s apparently another interview he gave late last month as well.\n\nHopefully this doesn’t take forever and we get him quick.\n\nPost by Maddog on\n\nThere is an incredibly valid reason this man was added to the list. Enrique Camarena was tortured to death over the course of about 30 hours. He was burned with cigarettes, beaten (an autopsy later showed his windpipe, ribs and facial bones were crushed), and they even drilled a hole in his head before finishing him off with a crowbar. The torture was also recorded on tape, and Camarena on the two-hour tape pleaded for his life and for his family to remain unharmed. To make matters worse, the cartel hired a doctor to revive Camarena with amphetamines whenever he slipped into unconsciousness from the beating.\n\nCaro-Quintero also ordered the brutal murders of Americans John Clay Walker and Albert Radelat. Walker was a writer living in Guadalajara, Mexico, and Radelat, his good friend and a dental student, were eating lunch at a Guadalajara restaurant. They were leaving when they accidentally stumbled upon a party Caro-Quintero was hosting. He immediately ordered his guards to seize the men and interrogate them as he thought they were undercover DEA Agents (they weren’t). Both men were taken to a back room and tortured with ice picks. Walker died of blunt force trauma to the head. They buried him and Radelat (who was still alive at the time he was buried) in a park outside town.\n\nI think the reason they added this man is not only due to the extreme danger he poses, but because they are prodding Mexico to look harder for him. Seriously, nothing says, “look harder” than raising a reward to $20M.\n\nPost by тσρтєиhυитєя on\n\nThere is an incredibly valid reason this man was added to the list.

Seriously, nothing says, “look harder” than raising a reward to $20M.\n\nHonestly this addition was very necessary, after a year without a million dollar fugitive since Gerena was removed, I feel the list was somewhat bland, and accepted the fact that we more likely wouldn’t see another million dollar fugitive, but thankfully this addition happened.\n\nI don’t think RCQ is going to be on the list for several years, especially with the bounty being much more significant than all the drug traffickers at large at the moment. Also they have an image of him from 2016, and he allows himself to get interviewed, so all that’s needed is to set up a trap and he’d be the 485th capture.\n\nPost by Maddog on\n\nI think what ultimately propelled him onto the list was the fact he gave another interview last month. I'll bet that riled up the FBI to no end. I really hope he is captured and extradited, and that Enrique Camarena's family gets justice.\n\nOne hurdle: They will have to extradite Caro-Quintero on new charges and not the charges for Caro-Quintero's murder, because Mexico will not extradite anyone who has been convicted of the same crime in Mexico despite charges for the same crime existing in the US. Thus, they'll probably have to charge him with more drug charges in order to extradite him.\n\nPost by тσρтєиhυитєя on\n\nWell the day he was added to the list they unsealed an indictment on additional drug trafficking crimes, so there shouldn’t be a problem there. Also I must point out that Caro-Quintero is only #2 to Ayman Al-Zawahiri, the leader of Al-Qaeda, & Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, the leader of IS, which is at $25,000,000 right now, which also means RCQ is the #1 most Wanted drug cartel boss at the moment since everyone else is at a $5,000,000 reward.\n\nI don’t know about everyone else, but to me, it seems that Rafael Caro-Quintero in a way fills the vacuum left open by the removal Victor Gerena in December 2016.\n\nPost by тσρтєиhυитєя on\n\nAccording to this article it states that the indictment was issued in January of 2017 and was unsealed on the day RCQ was added, in addition to that it also says, ever since the extradition of El Chapo Guzmán in 2017, there has been infighting within the faction lead by Damaso Lopez Nunez since he wanted to make a bid for the leadership, but calmed afterwards to insure stability.\n\nIn the event that Rafael Caro-Quintero, now the most sought after cartel leader in the world (even El Chapo didn’t get to the level RCQ is currently), is captured or killed, this could destabilize the Sinaloa cartel, and also sadly add further violence in Mexico.\n\nworldview.stratfor.com/article/20-million-reward-cartel-leader-mexico-hiding-dea-camarena-caro-quintero-narco"
