        "text": "Prior to the arrival of the Spanish Empire, the entire region was once populated by the Cahíta, an indigenous ethnic group. The Spanish Empire maintained a very tight grip over the region, and committed numerous atrocities — the Cahita had been largely displaced, numerous tribal leaders were executed for instigating uprisings and rebellions against the Spanish, and many were forced to work as slaves. The state was once a part of Sonora, but in 1830, Sinaloa split to become a separate region.\n\nThroughout much of the 1800s and 1900s, Sinaloa was a very popular destination for immigrants, receiving waves of people from all corners of the world; many Germans moved to the city of Mazatlan and were able to make it a popular seaport, the state was a major source of opium partly because of Chinese settlers, and the state is home to a large community of Arabs, most of whom trace their roots to either Lebanon or Syria.\n\nSinaloa is widely known as \"Mexico's breadbasket\" — The state has one of the largest fishing fleets in all of Mexico, it is the country’s leading producer of rice and vegetables, and is the second largest producer of wheat and beans. These factors have helped to make Sinaloa one of the richest and most developed states in all of Mexico.\n\nSince the 1990s, political instability, crime, and the ongoing drug wars have beset the state. One of the most infamous drug cartels in the world, the Sinaloa Cartel, is based here and it has been widely regarded by many as the largest and most influential drug cartel in the world. Its influence in the state is so profound that the state's culture has been influenced by them and even the Mexican government often doesn't have any clue on how to deal with them. As evidence, in October 2019, a major shootout took place in Culiacan in which the government was forced to release a member they captured because the Cartel proved to be too problematic for the government to handle.\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nThe music of Banda sinaloense is the type of music recognized as original and typical of the state of Sinaloa. Its instrumental composition differentiates it from the other musical styles of the country. The dominance of banda music in this region of the country cannot be overstated.\n\nBanda is performed by large bands composed primarily of brass and woodwind instruments. A 20-member band is fairly typical of well-known banda performers, such as Banda el Recodo (the most popular band in Sinaloa, performing since 1938, with many platinum albums, Grammy, Billboard and other awards to their credit).\n\nNorteña music is also extremely popular in Sinaloa. In fact the most popular and widely known norteña group, Los Tigres del Norte, are from the small town of Mocorito, in between Los Mochis and Culiacan. Controversial for their narcocorrida songs that many feel glorify criminal organizations, their music has earned them millions of fans in every corner of Mexico and beyond.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nSinaloa has a warm climate on the coast; moderately warm climate in the valleys and foothills; moderately cold in the lower mountains, and cold in the higher elevations. Its weather characteristics vary from subtropical, found on coastal plains, to cold in the nearby mountains. Temperatures range from 22 °C (72 °F) to 43 °C (109 °F) with rain and thunderstorms during the rainy season (June to October) and dry conditions throughout most of the year. Its average annual precipitation is 790 millimetres."
