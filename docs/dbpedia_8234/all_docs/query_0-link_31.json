Nevertheless, the spread of human trafficking in Mexico has declined, yet the biggest problem has moved into the Mexican mountains, where remote areas have little or no authority at all. These areas are where the cartel usually pays off the authorities. But, in the case\n\nIn the late 1970’s, Guzman worked under the drug lord Hector “El Guero” Palma by transporting narcotics near U.S.-Mexico border through aircraft. Although Guzman’s rank in the cartel was very minimal, he took his job very seriously. For example, if any of his drug shipments were not on schedule, he would kill the smuggler himself usually letting them experience a slow and painful death. Business partners quickly learned that ripping Guzman off or betraying him was not an option. The way Guzman handled business helped him gain popularity. In the 1980’s, the dominant Guadalajara Cartel introduced him to Felix Gallardo, one of Mexico’s high ranked drug lords. Guzman began working for Gallardo as a chauffeur then quickly moved up in the business with the role of coordinating drug shipments from Columbia to Mexico through land, air, and sea. Palma on the other hand delivered his drugs into the United States. Guzman earned himself a lot of respect for his work and began working for Gallardo directly. Throughout the late 70’s and early 80’s, Mexico drug traffickers were the middlemen for Columbian drug trafficking groups. They would simply transport drugs into the U.S. and receive a fee for each kilogram. At this point Gallardo was the top drug kingpin in Mexico. When Gallardo was arrested, Guzman reportedly lived in Guadalajara, Jalisco. He owned several houses throughout\n\nAfter DeLuna’s trial, prosecutors told the jury that police had looked for Carlos Hernandez but said he was not a real person, and had been a fabrication made up by DeLuna. However, four years after DeLuna was executed, a private investigator was hired to look for a trace of Hernandez. After just one day of investigating, it was found that Carlos Hernandez was indeed a real person, and not just a fabrication. Hernandez was an alcoholic and always carried around a certain type of knife; a buck knife. Throughout his life he was arrested thirty-nine times, thirteen times for carrying a knife and had been on parole for most of his life. Hernandez was also known for his violence against women. In 1979, he was arrested twice, on the suspicion that he stabbed Dahlia Sauceda and carved an “X” into her back. Hernandez was arrested 4 years before DeLuna and once again while DeLuna was on death row. To continue, only two months before DeLuna was put to death, Hernandez was sentenced to ten years in jail for attempting to kill a woman named Dina Ybanez, with a knife. Still, not one person thought to alert the state of Texas, of this\n\nJoaquin Archivaldo Guzman Loera, also known as El Chapo, was born in the rural community of La Tuna, Badiraguato, Sinaloa (Beith, 2010). Guzman Loera started his trafficking career in the 1980’s working for the powerful Miguel Angel Felix-Gallardo (U.S Department of State, 2015); he was able to quickly move up the ranks because of his expertise in air logistics (U.S DOS, 2015). Guzman Loera is now the most powerful drug trafficker in the world and the leader of the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico. Thousands of killings have been attributed to Guzman Loera’s organization, along with kidnappings, and extortions. Mexican authorities arrested Guzman Loera on June 9th, 1993, for murder and drug related charges and was given a twenty year sentence in a maximum security prison in Jalisco, Mexico. However, he managed to escape from the maximum security prison on January 19, 2001 (U.S DOS, 2015). His escape from the maximum security prison in Jalisco has allowed him to\n\nEventually one of Cortes’ men led a massacre of the Mexican nobles, and murdered Montezuma. These conquests led to other conquests with the motivation of more gold and more land. Another conqueror, Francisco Pizarro, also led his men to capture an emperor, Atahualpa of the Incans, and held him for a ransom of silver and gold. With this gold and silver, as well as land, they executed Atahualpa. These violent raids proved beneficial to the Spanish, helping them spread their conquered land further south in the Americas. This quest made the Spanish not only rich in silver and gold, but in land and with slaves, by use of violent force.\n\nIn 2001, El Chapo escaped from Mexican prison, 13 years later he was caught by the navy. But that didn’t stop him from trying again, recently three months ago on January 8 of 2016. El Chapo’s planned an escape that was only feasible with the help of an employee of the government or an employee of the prison he was at. Corruption in the government and in other federal branches of Mexico is a common occurrence and the two El Chapo escapes has shined a light in this problem."
