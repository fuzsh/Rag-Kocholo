        "text": "According to the Associated Press, the two were tricked into flying into the U.S. They boarded the plane believing they were heading elsewhere, an official, who chose to remain anonymous, told the outlet. The person did not provide further details regarding the person who convinced the pair about the destination or where they believed they were going to.\n\nPresident Joe Biden celebrated the news in a statement released on Friday, praising authorities and saying his administration will \"continue doing everything possible so lethal drug dealers continue to be held accountable and save American lives.\" \"Too many have lost their lives due to the scourge of fentanyl. Too many families have been broken and suffer as a result of this destructive drug,\" he added.\n\nBorn in Culiacán in January 1948, \"El Mayo\" has been a legendary figure in the world of drug trafficking. For decades, he was one of the most prominent leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, a position that made him a top target for both Mexican and U.S. authorities. Despite numerous efforts to apprehend him, El Mayo had managed to evade capture until Thursday.\n\nHis involvement in the drug trade dating back to the 1970s. Over the years, he has been implicated in multiple federal cases in the United States, accused of facilitating the trafficking of cocaine, marijuana and fentanyl into the country. Following the capture of his infamous counterpart, Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, El Mayo inherited the mantle of leadership within the Sinaloa Cartel, solidifying his status as a kingpin.\n\nOver the decades, he ascended to the top echelons of the Mexican narcotics hierarchy, especially after the arrest of Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo in 1989. Since then, his name appeared in U.S. intelligence reports as a key figure in the Sinaloa Cartel, alongside El Chapo and Juan José Esparragoza Moreno, also known as \"El Azul.\"\n\nThe story of how it happened was fictionalized in Netflix's \"Narcos México.\" El Mayo's character was identified as Mr Ismael.\n\nThe pursuit of El Mayo had intensified in recent years, especially as the U.S. faced a growing crisis related to fentanyl, a potent opioid that has led to over 100,000 deaths annually. U.S. authorities pointed to major Mexican drug organizations, particularly the Sinaloa Cartel, as primary traffickers of this deadly substance.\n\nDespite his long-standing involvement in drug trafficking, the DEA noted a remarkable fact about El Mayo Zambada: until today, he had never spent a day in prison. His ability to remain at large contributed to his legendary status, fueled by a life of evasion, secrecy, and survival."
