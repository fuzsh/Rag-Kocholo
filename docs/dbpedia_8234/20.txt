The son of a top Sinaloa drug cartel leader has been arrested and accused of running a drug distribution network and managing gang finances.

The suspect was identified as Juan Jose Esparragoza Monzon, the 45-year-old son of Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno, also known as 'El Azul' or the Blue One.

'El Azul' is considered to be one of the top three leaders of the infamous Sinaloa gang along with Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán and Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada.

National Security Commissioner Renato Sales announced the arrest yesterday of the man but omitted his surnames identifying him as Juan Jose.

Sales said he was arrested on January 19 in Culiacán in the drug gang ridden state of Sinaloa.

Esparragoza is said to have been accused of distributing drugs and being part of the organisation's finances and was found with another man referred to simply as 'Jesus N,' according to Proceso.

The captured man is part of Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto's list of 122 gangsters wanted over their links with the Sinaloa cartel.

He is also considered a 'generator of violence' in the cities of Mexicali and Tijuana which are both just to the south of California.

His father, Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno, was originally part of Mexico's intelligence agency the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS) before founding, with other drug kingpins, the now disbanded Guadalajara cartel in the 1970s.

He went onto to the Juarez cartel before settling with arch rivals the Sinoloa cartel where he rose to become one of the group's key figures.

Esparragoza Moreno has a US$5 million bounty placed on his head by the United States Department of State under its Narcotics Rewards Program and is also one of Mexico's most wanted.

The State Department said he is wanted over 'the importation of over 14 tons of marijuana into the United States'.

However unconfirmed reports suggest he died in hospital under a fake name.
