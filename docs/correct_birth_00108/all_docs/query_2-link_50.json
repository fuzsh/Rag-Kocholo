        "text": "For more than 20 years, Sinton had shared his home, the former Longworth mansion on Pike Street in downtown Cincinnati, with Anna; her husband, Charles; their two sons; and their two daughters, including Anna Louise, whose name would figure prominently into local history one day. The Taft couple traveled around the world, amassing a collection of more than 600 paintings and works of art.\n\nHaving made a fortune in iron manufacturing and real estate, 93-year-old Sinton died in 1890, at which time the New York Times said he was “the richest man in Cincinnati.” He left Anna, his sole heir, a $20 million estate.\n\nART\n\nIn 1927, two years after constructing the law building, Charles and Anna bequeathed their home and private art collection to the people of Cincinnati. After extensive remodeling and updating, their mansion opened in 1932 as the Taft Museum of Art, where College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning faculty continue to use the collection as a resource and inspiration. As recently as 2011, two UC ceramicists exhibited porcelains inspired by the decor and collection of the museum.\n\nHUMANITIES\n\nWhen Charles died in 1929, Anna memorialized her husband by giving UC $50,000 to endow the Charles Phelps Taft Memorial Fund, which supports studies in humanities, languages, economics and mathematics at UC, including Taft fellows and professors, as well as the Taft Research Center. Since Anna’s initial gift, the fund has grown to have an asset value of $38 million, according to the center’s annual report."
