        "text": "When you're Cincinnati's only president, your birthday's a big deal.\n\nThis year, Taft fans and the William Howard Taft National Historic Site are celebrating \"Big Bill's\" 161st birthday Friday with what organizers hope will be the first annual Taft Day series of events. (Taft's actual birthday is Saturday).\n\nThough he's most famous for getting stuck in the White House bathtub (which historians can't confirm actually happened), Taft was also the only president born and raised in the Queen City.\n\nMore: William Howard Taft house under renovation\n\nTaft was elected 27th president in 1908, almost 14 years before the advent of Cincinnati chili. He lost re-election four years later.\n\nReds fans should note Taft invented the presidential first pitch in 1910 at a Washington Senators game. That year, the Reds were just 41 years old (they're 149 now, though they don't look a day over 130).\n\nTaft grew up on Auburn Avenue, now across the street from Christ Hospital. After graduating Yale, he studied law at the University of Cincinnati, but you can't call him a Bearcat -- the mascot didn't emerge until 1914.\n\nWhile still a student at UC, Taft moonlighted as a reporter for the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune. The Commercial was purchased by The Enquirer in 1911, so he technically worked for us, right?\n\nTaft gets a lot of flak for being America's heaviest president, over 350 pounds. But Taft is also the only president to also be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"I don't remember that I was ever president,\" he said of his appointment in 1920. He's the only president to swear-in two other presidents.\n\nTaft was also the last commander-in-chief to sport facial hair in office.\n\nThe Taft family's legacy can be spotted across Cincinnati, from the Taft Museum of Art, Taft Theatre, Taft Elementary, UC's Taft Research Center and Taft Road. There's even a craft brew named for the larger-than-life president, the \"Gavel Banger\" poured at Taft's Ale House.\n\nTaft biographer Jeffrey Rosen and Sen. Rob Portman will speak at the breakfast and tour the William Howard Taft National historic site.\n\nBut the Taft Day lunch will be a family affair: former Ohio governor Bob Taft, the 27th president's great-grandson, will speak at the event.\n\nLater, Rosen will give a 3 p.m. lecture on Taft at the UC College of Law."
