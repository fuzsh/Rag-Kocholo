        "text": "The Life and Times of William Howard Taft\n\nAuthor: Henry F. Pringle\n\nPublished: 1939\n\nOver a thousand pages on William Howard Taft between the two volumes of Pringle’s biography, and not one mention of a bathtub. Before I started this presidential biography journey, I could have told you about the bathtub and the Supreme Court, and what century he was president, but that was about it. Reading a biography on Teddy Roosevelt filled in a lot of the other details, but it was pretty great reading one about Taft and getting the other side of the story. Although Roosevelt kind of towers over Taft in stature (whether because of years in office or literally towering on a mountain face), the two men are very much connected both in their rises to power and their falls. I’d argue Taft actually came out better in the end (at least during their lifetimes) but both were flawed men whose political careers magnified some of their shortcomings.\n\nMy impression of Taft throughout the book was he was a politician who wanted to be a judge. Although Taft liked to claim he was consistent in his views, when election time came around all bets were off. Although always a Republican, and not a radical like Roosevelt (in the end), Taft would fluctuate within the party and even towards the Democrats depending on who the candidates were. This included his position on getting involved with World War I and his overall evaluation of Woodrow Wilson. He was better as a judge, but the author still pointed out times he appeared to contradict his earlier stated positions on major labor policy issues.\n\nHe also greatly benefitted from privilege, both in name recognition and location. I have a hard time seeing why he got his judge, solicitor general, or governor positions based on what’s in the book and those directly led to him becoming president. He performed the jobs all adequately, taking advantage of every opportunity presented to him. Here’s some other stuff I found interesting:\n\nBorn into – Taft was born in Ohio. While Virginia is technically the leader with eight presidents, Ohio is right behind at 7 and more of those are modern presidents (4 of the first 5 presidents are from Virginia, of the 8 from Ohio six came after Ulysses Grant). That’s a pretty good head start on its own. Taft’s dad was also a lawyer, then a judge, and even served in Grant’s cabinet. He also had the connections and finances to attend Yale for college (where he was the Salutatorian) and Cincinnati Law School. I’d say that’s a great head start in life. 1 out of 5\n\nPre-President – After law school, Taft’s first public job was as a reporter. He followed that with jobs as a prosecutor and internal revenue collector. His biggest case as an attorney was trying to discipline a defense attorney who kept getting murderers off. He was unsuccessful at that and also all the other big cases spotlighted in book. He was appointed judge at the young age of 29; nobody seems to know why. Apparently he was well liked and his family name helped a lot. When an opening for the Supreme Court became available that same year, Taft threw his own hat in the ring but was passed over. He was given the position of Solicitor General as a consolation prize (still at 29).\n\nAfter a few years in that role, became a Circuit Court judge where he was interested in policy and seemed to do a nice job. His career took an odd turn at that point when he was appointed head of the Phillipines governing group following the Spanish American War. The explanation by the author is McKinley was looking for somebody from Ohio that was also trustworthy. This was the best section of either book, with Taft learning Spanish and give his best effort to do a good job. By most accounts, his only major misstep was in stifling a political party that didn’t support a permanent relationship with United States leading to additional strife in the islands.\n\nTaft next got sent to Europe to deal with a Catholic Church controversy where Spanish Friars were removed from the Philippines and the question became how to either replace the friars or purchase their land. No satisfactory resolution occurred while Taft was there. Taft finished his Philippines work prior to Roosevelt’s bid for reelection in 1904, and became Secretary of War as part of cabinet. As cabinet member, he was Roosevelt’s right hand man. He also filled in for the Secretary of State when needed, and was even acting president when Roosevelt was out of country. During this time he aided in Roosevelt’s triumphs (Panama Canal) and pitfalls (Brownsville incident where entire company of black soldiers was permanently discharged over murky evidence of violent incident).\n\nRoosevelt pointed to Taft as his successor to the Republican party where there was no real competition. Like every Republican of that era, he ran against William Jennings Bryant who sabotaged his own chances by advocating the government take over the railroad lines. Taft avoided most controversies on campaign tail. He got some grief for being unitarian in religion (believed in God, not in divinity of Christ). He also supported making it a requirement of showing where candidates got their financial contributions (but not until after his election). He won his election handily, but the victory was also over half as small as Roosevelt’s had been four years earlier. 4 out of 5.\n\nPresidential Career – Taft filled his cabinet with lawyers, drawing criticism but he was happy with the selections. His first strife with Roosevelt was Taft saying he would keep Roosevelt’s cabinet and then not keeping all of it. Throughout his term he battled over tariffs with other Republicans; on one major issue Taft held out and got his way on a lumber issue and made some enemies in the party. (Later even more so when he called it the best bill ever passed by Republicans.) One large scandal to the public involved a government employee in Alaska who was purported to have rigged the system so lands with coal would go to certain businesses. The book spent a lot of time on this and author suggested nothing was really improper on this and it didn’t result in any major issues aside from the controversy.\n\nAnother break with Roosevelt was on conservation, where Taft felt Roosevelt’s conservation measures exceeded legality by the Executive branch and he didn’t continue/extend on those matters. The Supreme Court was a revolving door while he was president and he appointed SIX justices during his four years. Another slight scandal occurred when Taft pardoned Charles W. Morse, a financial crook, on grounds that he was about to die in prison. Taft likely just relied on bad medical evidence, as Morse outlived Taft by three years and continued to defraud people after his release. One area where Taft was consistent with Roosevelt policies was the busting up of monopolies, taking on Rockefeller’s oil and many others. The author points out that Taft was lenient on the banking monopoly of JP Morgan however, which contributed to disaster of stock market crash and great depression. Not alone in his dealings with other countries, Taft’s strategy of dollar diplomacy was unsuccessful, particularly regarding Mexico.\n\nThe rift with Teddy Roosevelt was major issue for Taft. Author argues for Taft it was based on Roosevelt going beyond what the Constitution allowed and Roosevelt becoming radical when he ran for office again. Taft was often emotional about the conflict with his former best friend and mentor, and initially refused to respond or criticize him. During the election, Taft finally broke down and decided to confront the things Roosevelt was saying about him. Roosevelt blamed party bosses for getting Taft the Republican party nomination, and there is some evidence to support that but not to the extent that Roosevelt was claiming. When the election was held, Roosevelt ran as 3rd party, and Taft only won 2 states, Vermont and Utah. Dramatic events during the campaign were the Titanic sinking (and conspiracy that Taft had sent messenger on it to court Catholic voters at Vatican) and Roosevelt being shot. 2.5 out of 5.\n\nVice President – V.P James Sherman was only mentioned twice in the book. He was a compromise pick at the Republican convention, specifically: “So Sherman, of New York, a conservative political hack distinguished chiefly for his nickname “Sunny Jim,” was nominated. Pg. 355 He was mentioned again when died in office just before Taft’s reelection bid. According to Wikipedia, he’s the first VP to fly in an airplane or throw out a first pitch at a baseball game. 1 out of 5.\n\nFirst Lady – Taft married Nellie Herron, a woman he was very sweet on who made him wait a long while first to date and then to marry. She provided strong support for her husband any time the advancement of his career was a possibility, and was not afraid to confront him on who she believed his enemies were. The book doesn’t discuss his parenting or children much but she was the mother to three children, one of whom became a senator. 2.5 out of 5.\n\nPost Presidency – Taft was cordial with Wilson on his way out the door and soon after got a job as a professor of Law at Yale after leaving office. Taft and Roosevelt even kind of patched up toward the end of the 1910’s, as they both were critical of Wilson and worked together to support the Republican party in that time. His first foray back to Washington was serving as judge on national labor board disputes. He continued to let it be known he would accept a Supreme Court seat if it were the Chief Justice. President Harding made that come true, appointing Taft who served with such titans as Brandies and Oliver Wendell Holmes. Taft was very conservative, facing major issues like prohibition and taxes. While he didn’t support prohibition, he upheld its legality and even authored the opinion that allows vehicles to be searched. He also weighed in on minimum wages (against), child labor laws (sometimes against) and government regulation (it depends). Taft was critical of judges that dissented, often wanting unanimous decisions and judges to now draw the attention to themselves instead of the law. He died at the age of 70, still Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. 5 out of 5."
