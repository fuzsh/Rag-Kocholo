It was the birthplace and childhood home of William Howard Taft, the 27th president and the 10th chief justice of the United States. It is a two-story Greek Revival house built circa 1845.\n\nThe William Howard Taft Memorial Association eventually acquired the house for $35,000 (the assessment price), instead of the $75,000 Bellinger was demanding for it.\n\nBy 1961, the house was in poor condition and needed restoration, to the tune of $92,500. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964. A ceremony on September 15, 1964 (William's 107th birthday), celebrated the home becoming a National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe association gained full title to the house in 1968 and in 1969 transferred it to the National Park Service, which currently operates the site as a historic house museum, so that its future upkeep is ensured. The United States government took the property title on November 1, 1970.\"\n\n(visit link)\n\nStreet address:\n\n2038 Auburn Ave\n\nCincinnati, OH United States\n\n45219County / Borough / Parish: Hamilton CountyYear listed: 1966Historic (Areas of) Significance: Law; Politics/Government; ArchitecturePeriods of significance: 1825-1849Historic function: Single dwellingCurrent function: Museum; ParkPrivately owned?: noHours of operation: From: 8:30 AM To: 4:45 PMPrimary Web Site: [Web Link]Secondary Website 1: [Web Link]Secondary Website 2: [Web Link]Season start / Season finish: Not listedNational Historic Landmark Link: Not listed\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nPlease give the date and brief account of your visit.
