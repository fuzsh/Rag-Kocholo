        "text": "The papers of William Howard Taft (1857-1930), twenty-seventh president of the United States and tenth chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, consist of approximately 676,000 documents (789,441 images), which have been digitized from 658 reels of previously reproduced microfilm. Held in the Library of Congress Manuscript Division, these papers constitute the largest collection of original Taft documents in the world. The collection contains family papers, personal and official correspondence, presidential and judicial files, speeches and addresses, legal files and notebooks, business and estate papers, engagement calendars, guest lists, scrapbooks, clippings, printed matter, memorabilia, and photographs dating from 1784 to 1973, with the bulk of the material dated 1880-1930.\n\nTaft’s papers thoroughly document his public service career, especially his presidential administration from 1909 to 1913. The materials address the major issues that confronted his presidency, including tariffs, federal income tax, international arbitration, antitrust enforcement, conservation, Republican party politics, U.S. investment in Latin America, and the construction of the Panama Canal. Other phases of his career are documented as well, including the years he served as U.S. solicitor general, U.S. Court of Appeals judge for the Sixth Circuit, governor general of the Philippines, secretary of war under Theodore Roosevelt, professor of constitutional law at Yale University, and chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1921 to 1930. Taft’s chief justice files document his administration of the Supreme Court and federal court system, including his successful efforts to secure for the Supreme Court the right to control its own docket. The collection also contains substantial material on the Taft family and includes the papers of Taft’s father Alphonso Taft (1810-1891), who was a prominent lawyer, jurist, cabinet secretary, and diplomat\n\nThe Index to the William Howard Taft Papers was created by the Manuscript Division in 1972 after the bulk of the collection was microfilmed. The index comprises six volumes, each of which is available online. Volume 1 provides alphabetical listings of presidential subject or case files in Series 5, Series 6, and Series 7, as well as legal case files in Series 12 and Series 13. The remaining volumes provide an alphabetical list of correspondents found throughout the collection: Volume 2: A-C; Volume 3: D-H; Volume 4: I-M; Volume 5: N-S; and Volume 6: T-Z. The information in these volumes is helpful in finding individual letters or documents in the online version. Items in Series 27, an addition to the collection, came to the Library after 1972 and are not included in the index.\n\nA current finding aid (PDF and HTML) to the William H. Taft Papers is also available online with links to the digital content on this site.\n\nBrief History of the Taft Papers\n\nThe William H. Taft Papers were acquired by the Library of Congress through deposit, gift, and purchase during the years 1919-2009. When Taft left the White House in 1913, he asked that his War Department and presidential files be sent to him in New Haven, Connecticut, where he would be teaching constitutional law at Yale University and working on writing projects. Taft had a judge’s regard for documentary evidence and had preserved his papers throughout his career. When the Library of Congress solicited his collection in 1919, Taft agreed to place his papers on deposit in the Library’s Manuscript Division. He himself returned to Washington two years later as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Taft made regular additions to his collection between 1919 and 1929 as more material was found in the White House, his home in Washington, and the homes of family members. After his death in 1930, his estate and members of his family continued to deposit material. His children Helen Taft Manning, Robert A. Taft, and Charles P. Taft converted the deposit to a gift in 1952. Additional items were acquired through gift and purchase between 1952 and 2009. Portions of the collection were loaned to Taft’s biographer Henry F. Pringle in the 1930s, and part of the collection was sent to Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, for safekeeping during World War II.\n\nA fuller history of the collection was prepared in 1972 for the Index to the William Howard Taft Papers, pp. v-x, and was subsequently reproduced in the finding aid. A version of it appears on this website under Articles and Essays.\n\nDescription of Series\n\nThe William H. Taft Papers are arranged in 27 series.
