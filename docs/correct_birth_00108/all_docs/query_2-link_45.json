        "text": "William Howard Taft was born on September 15, 1857, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was raised in Cincinnati by his parents, Alphonso Taft and Louise Torrey. He had four siblings, including Charles Phelps Taft II and Henry Waters Taft. Taft graduated from Woodward High School in 1874. He then attended Yale College, where he graduated second in his class in 1878. He went on to attend Cincinnati Law School and graduated in 1880. Taft began his political career as an assistant prosecutor for Hamilton County, Ohio. He then served as a judge and later became the Solicitor General of the United States and a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals. He also served as the Governor of the Philippines and Secretary of War under President Theodore Roosevelt. Taft married Helen Herron in 1886, and they had three children together, Robert, Helen, and Charles. In 1908, Taft was elected as the 27th President of the United States, succeeding Theodore Roosevelt. He served as President from 1909 to 1913. After his presidency, Taft went on to serve as a professor of law at Yale University and as the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He is the only person to have held both offices in the United States. Taft passed away on March 8, 1930, in Washington, D.C."
