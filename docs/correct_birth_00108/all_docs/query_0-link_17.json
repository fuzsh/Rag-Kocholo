        "meta_description": "\"The William Howard Taft Birthplace was the home of the only man to serve as President of the United States and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. William Howard Taft (1857-1930) was born here and lived in this house until he left Cincinnati to attend Yale University. Alphonso Taft bought the 2-story brick house in 1852 and added the rear portion. He was president of the Mt. Auburn Street Railway Company, a judge on the Superior Court of Cincinnati, and the first member of the family to achieve national prominence, serving as secretary of war, attorney general, and ambassador to Austria-Hungary and Russia. The Taft home was rented out after Alphonso Taft became secretary of war in 1876, and was divided into apartments by the 1920s. Over the years it suffered from hard use, age, and neglect. The William Howard Taft Memorial Association finally acquired the property in 1960. The National Park Service, which assumed curatorial duties in 1972, completed preservation and restoration.\"",
