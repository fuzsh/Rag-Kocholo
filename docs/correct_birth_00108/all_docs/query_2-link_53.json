He served as Solicitor General of the United States, Appeals Court Judge, Governor-General of the Philippines, Provisional Governor of Cuba, Secretary of War, twenty-seventh President, and Supreme Court Chief Justice. He is the only person to be President then put on the Supreme Court. He ran for President in 1908 and was supported by the outgoing president Theodore Roosevelt. William H. Taft and James S. Sherman won a decisive victory over William J. Bryan and John W. Kern. His policies during his term and his leanings to the conservative wing angered Theodore Roosevelt who rant against him in the Republican primary in 1912, when Roosevelt lost the primary he created the Progressive Party and splitting the republican vote giving the election to Woodrow Wilson."
