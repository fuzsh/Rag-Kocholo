        "text": "Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nThe first (and only) U.S. President to also serve as a Supreme Court Justice, William Howard Taft was born in the then-Cincinnati suburb of Mount Auburn, Ohio in 1857. After graduating from Cincinnati’s Woodward High School and getting his law degree from Yale, where he was a member of Skull and Bones (for the record, his father was a founding member of the organization), Taft returned to Cincinnati to practice law.\n\nTaft’s career took off, and, helped by his father, Alphonso Taft’s connections, William found himself moving through the ranks, serving first as a Solicitor General of the United States, then a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.\n\nDuring this time, his career ascent was helped by a fellow Ohio President, William McKinley, who trusted him enough to appoint Taft as the Governor-General of the Philippines. After McKinley’s assassination in 1901, now-President Theodore Roosevelt gave Taft the positions of Provisional Governor of Cuba and later U.S. Secretary of War.\n\nAll of this essentially set up Taft to become the next President, and he won the election in 1908, succeeding his mentor, Theodore Roosevelt. A member of the Republican party, Taft spent his single term as President not really accomplishing much. He’s known for his Dollar Diplomacy, pushing for free trade with Canada, the 16th Amendment, and what he called his “Southern Policy.” The latter is one of the largest blemishes on his record, as he removed African Americans from federally appointed positions in the south and refused to appoint any to positions in the north, claiming that he want to avoid “racial friction.” You can interpret this as you will.\n\nAnother thing that Taft is known for is the bathtub story. According to rumors, he was so large that he once got stuck in a bathtub during his time in the White House. This isn’t correct, but a huge tub was commissioned for the place, ensuring that this would never take place.\n\nThis rumor and fact (about the huge tub) are addressed during the tour provided by an employee at the William Howard Taft National Historic Site. Owned and run by the National Park Service, the site is housed (literally) in the Mount Auburn home that he was born and raised in.\n\nWilliam Howard Taft Birthplace and Historical Site\n\nMany artifacts and pieces of furniture owned by Taft and his family are on display in rooms set up much as they were back in the mid to late 1800s.\n\nThere are plenty of curios, lovingly cared for period chairs, and plenty of other things to peruse.\n\nThe tour includes information about the history of the house. For example, the Taft family lived in the home from 1840 until 1899, when Alphonso Taft’s widow sold the house and surrounding property. William Howard Taft only lived there from 1857 until 1874, when he went off to college.\n\nIn 1969, the home was made into the National Historic Site that it now is, thanks to President Richard Nixon, who signed the legislation turning the home over to the National Park Service.\n\nOn top of the many artifacts on display in the front half of the home, there are a number of museum exhibits arranged in the back half, including information and items from Taft’s Presidential campaign, his time working as a Presidential appointee to the Philippines and Cuba, and more.\n\nThere’s even information about his wife, Nellie, as well as their children, Robert, Helen, and Charles.\n\nAfter his single term as President, Taft went back to Yale to work as a professor. He stayed there until 1920, when yet another Ohio President, this time Warren G. Harding, gave him the honor of an appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. There he stayed until his death in 1930. He then became the first U.S. President and U.S. Supreme Court Justice to be buried in Arlington National Cemetery. However, a piece of his life will always remain in Ohio.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/places/taft-family-house.htm\n\nhttps://www.history.com/news/did-william-howard-taft-really-get-stuck-in-a-bathtub\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/william-howard-taft/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howard_Taft\n\nFurther Reading"
