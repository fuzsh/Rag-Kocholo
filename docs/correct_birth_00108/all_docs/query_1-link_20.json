        "text": "William Howard Taft was born into a wealthy family on September 15, 1857, in Cincinnati, Ohio. His parents were Alphonso Taft and Louisa Maria Torrey. His father was secretary of war and attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nTaft graduated from Yale University in 1878 and Cincinnati Law School in 1880. He married Helen (Nellie) Herron in 1886. They had three children.\n\nIn 1887 Taft became a judge of the superior court of Ohio. He was named a judge of a U.S. circuit court in 1892.\n\nRoosevelt supported Taft in the presidential election of 1908. He believed that Taft would continue his reforms. A Republican, Taft defeated the Democrat William Jennings Bryan to become president.\n\nAs president, Taft failed to solve the growing split between conservative and progressive Republicans. The progressives wanted Taft to continue Roosevelt’s reforms. Taft did continue to attack the big business groups known as trusts. However, Taft disappointed progressives by approving a high tariff, or tax on imports. He also refused to hire progressives as his advisers.\n\nRoosevelt and the progressives soon left the Republican Party to form the Progressive Party. In the 1912 presidential election the Republican Taft ran against the Progressive Roosevelt and the Democrat Woodrow Wilson. The split in the Republican Party allowed Wilson to win the election.\n\nAfter leaving office Taft taught law at Yale University. In 1921 President Warren G. Harding appointed Taft chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Taft was happier in this post than he was as president. He helped the Court to work faster and to focus on the most important national cases.\n\nSuffering from heart disease, Taft resigned on February 3, 1930. He died on March 8 in Washington, D.C."
