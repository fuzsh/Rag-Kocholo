        "text": "The Michelin Guide's review\n\nThe nation's 27th president, William Taft (1857-1930), lived in this handsome Greek Revival dwelling (1841) from his birth until he embarked on his political career 20 years later. Today the Taft Birthplace is split evenly between the Tafts' downstairs living spaces and upstairs exhibition rooms that trace the trajectory of Taft's life and times with personal mementos, photographs and even music. Happy to give up the cutthroat politics of the presidency, Taft became the 10th chief justice of the Supreme Court. He remains the only American to have held both positions."
