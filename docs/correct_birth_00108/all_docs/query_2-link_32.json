        "text": "Scope and Contents of the Collection\n\nThe William Howard Taft Letters consist of six outgoing items of Correspondence written between 1891 and 1929. The three items to John Proctor Clarke concern recommendations for appointments. There are also two letters to Lyman Kennon relating to issues concerning the Philippines, including the raising of a native militia and the use of American engineers for construction purposes. In addition is a letter to Henry MacFarland discussing a plan for the government of Manila:\n\nThe city is surrounded with such peculiar conditions that we are convinced that we must make it a city of the Archipelago and treat it as Washington has been treated and not as part of a province. In the government of such a city as this the natural tendency to corruption of the Tagalog and Filipino politician would make a popular government here result in a terrible condition of things.\n\nReturn to top\n\nRestrictions\n\nAccess Restrictions\n\nThe majority of our archival and manuscript collections are housed offsite and require advanced notice for retrieval.
