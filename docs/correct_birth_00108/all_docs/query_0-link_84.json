        "text": "Served: March 4, 1909 – March 4, 1913\n\nBorn: September 15, 1857\n\nBirthplace: Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nDied: March 8, 1930\n\nOccupations: Lawyer, jurist\n\nPolitical Party: Republican\n\nSpouse: Helen Herron\n\nFrom President to Chief Justice\n\nWilliam Howard Taft was the 27th president of the United States. He is also known for his role as the 10th chief justice of the United States, a position he was appointed to after his presidency. In fact, to this day he is the only president to hold both roles.\n\nIn addition, Taft served as a judge on the Cincinnati Superior Court, solicitor general of the United States, judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, governor-general of the Philippines, and secretary of war under President Theodore Roosevelt. In fact, Roosevelt picked Taft for the role of secretary of war with him in mind as his potential successor.\n\nA Man of Many Organizations\n\nTaft attended Yale College and was a member of various school clubs including the Linonian Society, Skull and Bones, and Psi Upsilon fraternity.\n\nHe was nicknamed “Old Bill” by his closest friends and “Big Lub” because of his size. By his graduation, Taft ranked second in his class, and from there he attended Cincinnati Law School, graduating in 1880.\n\nIn 1886, Taft married Helen Herron; they had three children. In 1887, he became judge of the Superior Court of Cincinnati, thus launching a successful and long career in law.\n\nA Law Career Interrupted by the Presidency\n\nAlthough William Howard Taft had made law his career from the get-go, in 1908 he won the bid for presidency, having been hand-picked by Roosevelt to succeed him in office.\n\nTaft served only one term, and he focused on civil service reform, trust busting, passing the 16th Amendment, and the postal service. Additionally, through foreign policy he supported both Latin America and Asia in economic development.\n\nHowever, his presidency was not without strife, and by the end of his term, many voters felt alienated. He lost his second election and went back into academia and law. His last role, before his death in 1930, was chief justice, a role that he seemed not only destined for, but passionate about.\n\nDid You Know…?"
