        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1857–1930). The only person to hold the two highest offices in the United States was William Howard Taft. He was elected the 27th president of the United States in 1908 and later served as chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. No one was better fitted for these posts by long years of experience. Taft had been in public office almost continuously since 1881. He was the first civil governor of the Philippines (1901–03) and secretary of war in President Theodore Roosevelt’s Cabinet (1904–09), only two of the many high positions he held.\n\nHis large size and his famous chuckle made Taft a memorable figure. He was 5 feet 11 inches tall, with fair skin, clear blue eyes, and light hair. At the time he was president he weighed 350 pounds. He joked about his bulk and took no offense at the jokes of others. Asked to accept a “chair of law” at Yale University, he replied that he would if they could make it a “sofa of law.”\n\nHis best-known biographer, Henry F. Pringle, described the Taft chuckle: “It was by all odds the most infectious chuckle in the history of politics. It started with a silent trembling of Taft’s ample stomach. The next sign was a pause in the reading of his speech, and the spread of a slow grin across his face. Then came a kind of gulp which seemed to escape without his being aware that the climax was near. Laughter followed hard on the chuckle itself, and the audience invariably joined in.”\n\nHe had a reputation for laziness and for putting things off from day to day that was probably unfounded, for Taft accomplished a vast amount of work. A brilliant conversationalist and storyteller, he was considered to be a perfect host. He loved to entertain and be entertained, and he often dined out in private homes, though presidents usually do not do so while they are in office. He was a graceful dancer and played tennis well. He rode horseback almost daily, was an ardent golfer, and a baseball fan.\n\nChildhood and Marriage\n\nWilliam Howard Taft was born into a wealthy and socially prominent family of Cincinnati, Ohio. The first Taft in America, Robert, was a carpenter and farmer by trade. He emigrated from England and settled in Massachusetts in 1678. William’s father, Alphonso, was a successful lawyer and judge who served as secretary of war and attorney general in President Ulysses S. Grant’s Cabinet as well as serving as minister to both Austria-Hungary and Russia.\n\nAlphonso’s first wife, Fanny Phelps, died in 1852. Two sons, Charles Phelps and Peter Rawson, survived from this marriage. In 1853 he married Louisa Torrey. They had five children, of whom four survived—William Howard, born September 15, 1857, Henry Waters, Horace Dutton, and Frances Louise.\n\nThe family lived in a large house in the Mount Auburn section of Cincinnati. William Howard was known as Big Lub, for he was heavy from infancy. Good-natured and popular, he had a happy boyhood. He engaged in feuds and battles with stones with the gangs of neighboring hills. He played baseball in an old quarry and swam and skated. In the summer the five boys visited grandfather Torrey in Millbury, Massachusetts, and paid for their vacations by cutting wood for him. William attended the Unitarian church; he was a member all his life.\n\nIn 1874 Taft entered Yale University, from which his father had graduated. Although he was not a brilliant student he worked at his studies, and in 1878 he was graduated second in his class. He received his degree from the Cincinnati Law School in 1880.\n\nHe practiced law very little. His father’s prominence and his own friendly personality won him a succession of political appointments—assistant prosecuting attorney (1881–82), collector of internal revenue (1882–83), judge of the Cincinnati Superior Court (1887–90), solicitor general of the United States (1890–92), and judge of the federal circuit court (1892–1900). By now he was dreaming of an appointment to the United States Supreme Court, his greatest ambition.\n\nTaft first met Helen (Nellie) Herron, daughter of a Cincinnati attorney, at a winter night’s sledding party. A few years later she organized a literary salon, of which he was a member. They were married in June 1886. Nellie’s father gave them a lot on Walnut Hills, and they built a house overlooking the Ohio River. They had three children—Robert Alphonso, Helen, and Charles Phelps. In the summers they vacationed in Murray Bay, Quebec, on the St. Lawrence.\n\nThe president’s wife was a fine musician, and her frequent White House musicales with guest artists were delightful affairs. In the family’s travels she had learned to love the cherry blossoms of Japan and the evening band concerts on the Luneta, a drive in Manila, capital of the Philippines. She was responsible for the planting of the famous cherry trees along Washington’s Tidal Basin and had Potomac Park converted into a Luneta, with a bandstand at either end. On pleasant summer evenings people strolled or drove through the park, visiting with their friends and listening to the music. The president often attended, riding his big black horse.\n\nGovernor of the Philippines\n\nIn 1900 President William McKinley had made Taft president of the Philippine Commission. His task was to form a civil government in a country disrupted by the Spanish-American War and the insurrection of Emilio Aguinaldo.\n\nTaft became very fond of the Filipinos and soon endeared himself to them. General Arthur MacArthur, the military governor, had been ruling them in despotic fashion and the two men came into immediate conflict. On July 4, 1901, Taft was appointed civil governor of the Philippines, with full responsibility for reorganizing the national and municipal governments, the judiciary and police, and the taxation system. Taft went to Rome, Italy, to discuss the land ownership of the Spanish friars with the pope. As a result, almost all the land owned by the friars was purchased and sold in small parcels on easy terms. By 1912 there were 50,000 new landowners.\n\nSecretary of War—Roosevelt’s “Troubleshooter”\n\nAt the end of 1903 President Theodore Roosevelt requested that Taft replace Elihu Root as secretary of war. When Roosevelt went on his frequent trips away from Washington he felt that all would go well because he had “left Taft sitting on the lid.” During an illness of John Hay, Taft was acting secretary of state. After Hay’s death, Root returned to the Cabinet as secretary of state. Roosevelt, Taft, and Root worked together so closely and so harmoniously that they came to be known as the Three Musketeers.\n\nAs Roosevelt’s “troubleshooter,” Taft traveled almost as much as his chief. He visited the Canal Zone many times to supervise construction of the Panama Canal. In 1905, while the Russo-Japanese War was being waged, Roosevelt sent Taft on a trip to the Far East. He visited the Japanese royal family and let it be known that the United States was determined to maintain peace in the Pacific. In 1906 he rushed to Cuba to stop a threatened revolution.\n\nThe Presidency\n\nAs the election of 1908 drew near, Roosevelt began to think of a successor who would continue his policies. The story is told that one evening in the White House, in conversation with William Howard and Helen Taft, Roosevelt leaned back in an armchair, closed his eyes, and in a funereal voice said, “I am a seventh son of a seventh daughter, and I have clairvoyant powers. I see a man weighing 350 pounds. There is something hanging over his head. I cannot make out what it is. At one time it looks like the presidency, then again it looks like the chief justiceship.” “Make it the presidency,” she said. “Make it the chief justiceship,” he said. The president’s wife and his brothers persuaded Taft to accept the nomination for the presidency. He was easily elected over William Jennings Bryan, who was now defeated for the third time. In 1909, with James S. Sherman as vice president, he began a term that was doomed to trouble.\n\nUnlike the dazzling Roosevelt, Taft was unable to popularize his accomplishments. He wrote, “It is a very humdrum, uninteresting administration, and it does not attract the attention or enthusiasm of anybody, but after I am out I think that . . . I can look back with some pleasure in having done something for the benefit of the public weal.”\n\nHis administration, however, was overshadowed by quarrels within the Republican Party and by the final break with his old friend Roosevelt. The party under Roosevelt was beginning to split into two factions. The Stalwarts, or “standpats,” were popularly regarded as the champions of Wall Street and of the “money interests.” Their leaders were United States Senator Nelson W. Aldrich of Rhode Island and the speaker of the House of Representatives, Joseph “Uncle Joe” Cannon. At the opposite extreme were the younger Republicans, most of them from the West and Midwest. They wanted to go further than Roosevelt with his reform of big business and the trusts. They also called for a revision of the political nomination system and for more aggressive social legislation. Known as the Insurgents, they later became the Progressives. The party’s popular nickname of Bull Moose was derived from Roosevelt’s colorful description of his own strength and vigor. Their leaders were Senators Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin and William E. Borah of Idaho and Congressman George W. Norris of Nebraska.\n\nTaft’s lack of political insight soon became apparent in his indifference toward the growing division between conservatives and progressives within Republican ranks. He actually encouraged the split by failing to appoint any of the liberal wing to his cabinet. The first task before the new administration was a revision of the tariff. The West wanted lower rates; the manufacturing East wanted full protection. Nelson Aldrich, leader of the Senate, wrote the bill to suit himself, raising the duties on some 600 items. The Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1909 was a victory for the Republican Stalwarts. It seemed a clear violation of the party platform that had promised to revise the tariff downward. The Insurgents charged that Taft had abandoned the Roosevelt policies.\n\nConservation became a political issue soon after the tariff bill was enacted. Roosevelt had been an ardent supporter of the conservation of natural resources. Charges were made that the new secretary of the interior, Richard A. Ballinger, was favoring the coal, mining, and timber interests that were exploiting the public lands of the West.\n\nA quarrel involving Ballinger and Gifford Pinchot, the forester of the United States, became an open scandal, forcing Taft to intervene. He upheld Ballinger, Pinchot’s superior, and dismissed Pinchot. The Insurgents attacked Taft as the agent of big business and as a traitor to the cause of conservation. An investigation by Congress upheld the president. The Insurgents called it “whitewashing” Ballinger. Pinchot went to Europe, where Roosevelt was traveling, to tell his side of the story to his old chief. From then on Roosevelt was increasingly cool to Taft.\n\nIn March 1910 the Insurgents combined with the Democrats to change the rules of procedure in the House of Representatives. Under the old rules the Insurgents were regularly suppressed by the speaker, Joseph Cannon. He refused recognition to Insurgents when they arose to speak unless they had previously obtained his consent. He appointed all committees and was the leading member of the committee on rules, which controlled the course of legislation. Under the new rules the speaker was ineligible for membership on the rules committee, and the House selected its own committees. Taft’s refusal to support the Insurgents in this controversy added to his unpopularity. In the fall elections of 1910 the Democrats won a majority in the House.\n\nA reciprocity treaty, under negotiation with Canada, would have lowered American duties on foodstuffs in return for Canadian reductions on manufactured goods. The measure cost Taft the support of the farmers, and then Canada rejected the treaty.\n\nIn spite of all these reverses, Taft’s record as a Progressive was as great as Roosevelt’s. Twice as many suits were brought against trusts in his administration as in Roosevelt’s. The Mann-Elkins Act gave the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) jurisdiction over telephone and telegraph lines; authorized it to suspend rate increases until satisfied that they were reasonable; and created a Commerce Court to hear appeals from the ICC. The 16th Amendment, authorizing a graduated federal income tax, was adopted. Alaska was made a territory in 1912, and Arizona and New Mexico were admitted to the Union.\n\nAfter the 1912 Election\n\nThe Progressives made every effort to prevent Taft’s renomination in 1912. Roosevelt was persuaded to run again. He found most of his old associates lined up with Taft, and though he made a good fight, a majority of the delegates to the convention were pledged to Taft. The Roosevelt supporters organized the Progressive Party, nominated Roosevelt and Hiram Johnson, and entered the campaign. The Democratic nominee was Woodrow Wilson. With the party split, the Democrats won the election with a minority of the popular vote.\n\nSoon after leaving the presidency Taft became a professor of constitutional law at Yale University. As the bitterness of the fight of 1912 faded, the ex-president’s opinions on public affairs were welcomed and respected. His views on the use of arbitration to prevent war reflected the spirit of the time.\n\nDuring World War I Taft devoted his influence to the promotion of an international league to enforce peace. President Wilson endorsed the movement and in 1917 made its proposal the center of his own policy. The League of Nations that was incorporated in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 owed much to the support of Taft. In 1918 he was made one of the two joint chairmen of the new National War Labor Board.\n\nThe last public service of the ex-president began in 1921 when President Warren G. Harding named him to the post he had longed for throughout his career—that of chief justice of the United States Supreme Court. Those who had considered Taft’s views to be rigid and reactionary were agreeably surprised at the liberality and progressive quality of his decisions. On February 3, 1930, he resigned because of a heart ailment. He died in Washington on March 8 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery."
