        "text": "In many ways, Jeff Wyler has lived the prototypical UC story. He was born literally across the street from campus, worked multiple jobs to pay his own way through college, used his business degree to gain a foothold in industry before acting on his entrepreneurial instincts, and made himself a success in the community he loves.\n\nWyler is the founder and CEO of the Jeff Wyler Automotive Family, a retail network of 35 franchises in three states. One of the country’s top 50 dealership groups, the company employs 1,300 and sells more than 40,000 new and used cars annually. It’s a far cry from the fledgling Batavia, Ohio, dealership he took over in 1973 at age 32, with 12 employees, six service bays, 20 parking spaces, and first-year sales of 383 vehicles. The phenomenal growth was a product of Wyler’s dogged determination, willingness to take calculated risks, and unerring focus on the needs of his customers.\n\nWyler spent much of his youth in the western U.S. as his family moved around for his stepfather’s job with Chevrolet. After graduating from high school in Texas, he briefly served in the U.S. Army Reserves and eventually returned to his native Cincinnati where he worked multiple jobs to put himself through college while taking a heavy course load. His degree in finance from UC could have propelled him into a career with one of the heavyweights in the financial sector, but instead he accepted an offer to work for Chevrolet like his stepfather, where his acumen and work ethic took him up the corporate ladder during his eight years there. While he appreciated the stability his work afforded him, his entrepreneurial streak compelled him to get out from under the layers of management at GM, so he bet on himself by taking over the struggling Chevrolet dealership in Batavia. Relying on the inner toughness that had seen him through his UC years, he persevered mightily when the Arab oil crisis of 1973 brought fuel shortages and gas rationing during his first year, emerging stronger for the experience.\n\nBefore long, opportunity knocked when a friend and customer suggested he advertise on TV since, as a Clermont County business, Wyler was prohibited from advertising in Hamilton County newspapers. In his down-to-earth and soon-to-be trademark fashion, Wyler began his long-running ad campaign to convince Greater Cincinnatians that “cars, like eggs, are cheaper in the country,” with “country” fairly describing Clermont County four decades ago. But with traffic around I-275 continuously increasing, customers started finding their way to Batavia in growing numbers, and the dealership took off.\n\nFurther innovation would follow. Anticipating changes in his industry, in the early 1980s Wyler acquired imported car franchises and consolidated his east-side dealerships by pioneering the “automall” concept where his domestic and foreign franchises, plus a used car dealership, were co-located. By de-emphasizing the specific brand of car in favor of greater convenience, wider selection and lower pricing, Wyler built a more user-friendly car-shopping experience as well as greater equity in his own Wyler brand.\n\nThrough the years, Wyler has been an extremely engaged corporate citizen in the communities where he’s done business, and a great champion of his alma mater. He brought a sharp focus to elevating the UC academic experience during his time as chairman of UC’s Board of Trustees, seeking to help elevate more programs to world-class status while exposing more people in the region to the university’s outstanding offerings. He has also been a long-time staunch supporter of Bearcats athletics. Wyler is also currently chair of the UC Health board of directors.\n\nThe word “family” in his company’s name refers to its dozens of linked dealerships, but the Jeff Wyler Automotive Family is also a family business, and Jeff Wyler is unabashedly a family man — proud to have his children deeply involved, including his son and son-in-law as partners and successors in running the region’s most successful automotive network. Its credo has been “Treat customers with honesty, fairness and respect,” and that recipe for success has been evident throughout the many business and community relationships that Wyler has built over the years.\n\nBill and Sandy Wiesmann had always found fulfillment in their decades of faithful support to their alma mater, including work on behalf of the UC Foundation and UC Alumni Association, service on the alumni advisory boards of their respective colleges, leadership in their Washington D.C. alumni group, and support of scholarships. Yet in recent years they had begun to feel they could and should do even more to make their involvement more impactful. They wanted to work together, unite their respective college backgrounds, help students discover a richer educational experience, and be personally involved along the way.\n\nUltimately the couple chose an innovative path that reflected their particular passions and life’s work — he a doctor, researcher and entrepreneur, she a career educator and advocate for teachers — while providing Bearcats following in their footsteps with something available nowhere else. They created the Next Generation Leadership Scholars program in which exceptionally talented undergraduates with financial need can engage in multi-year scientific research opportunities at Synedgen, Bill’s California-based biotechnology firm. Scholarship recipients are students of the STEM disciplines within Bill’s College of Arts and Sciences as well as the School of Education within Sandy’s College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services.\n\nFor the students, the opportunity provides pure experiential education similar to co-op as offered in other colleges. In addition to scholarship support, Next Generation Leadership Scholars work during the summer with professional scientists — many of whom are former professors who are accustomed to working with students — as they explore and develop groundbreaking research. Students say they relish learning essential procedures that reinforce and expand concepts covered in their UC classes — building their resumes as well as their life skills to help position them for greater success. And because traveling and living on their own in California is an entirely new experience for them, the students also receive plenty of “real-life guidance” that further enlarges the scope and impact of their scholarship, including insight on career paths, personal growth, and professional contacts. And getting to know them over the course of their two-year terms as Next Generation Leadership Scholars allows the Wiesmanns to cultivate and appreciate their growth, thus deepening their investment in the students’ futures and serving as a gratifying and driving force behind their philanthropy.\n\nAs UC’s vice provost for academic programs, Dr. Chris Lewis is deeply devoted to improving the lives of students. As founder of the Village Life Outreach Project, his passion for service extends to East Africa where the non-profit organization, in partnership with UC, is committed to enhancing the lives of rural villagers in Tanzania.\n\nIn true UC style, Lewis’ work displays a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to experiential learning. As a third-year UC medical resident serving a global health elective in Tanzania in 2003, he was so moved that he founded the Village Life Outreach Project the following year to “unite communities to promote Life, Health and Education.” As he and others from UC visited, listened and learned of the villagers’ daily challenges, he realized most problems revolved around access to clean water and education for area children. Rather than simply begin executing potential solutions in their behalf, Lewis recognized the need for a true partnership where all parties worked to raise the quality of life, but where the villagers would truly own the ongoing process and ultimate outcomes — “a hand up rather than a handout mentality, a mission of empowerment,” Lewis says.\n\nSince the Village Life Outreach Project began 17 years ago, Lewis has led more than two dozen trips to Tanzania with over 700 UC and UC Health faculty, residents and students, and the level of activity and impact has continued to rise. They treat the sick, establish methods of ensuring clean water, build schools (with the help of UC’s Engineers Without Borders chapter), create feeding programs for the schoolchildren, help village leaders craft systems by which they can sustain the work and its benefits, and much more.\n\nAs great as he feels about the difference Village Life has made on the ground in Africa, Lewis takes enormous satisfaction in its reciprocal nature; Village Life is transformational for everyone it touches. “It’s much bigger than our just coming in to serve,” he says. “We are the recipients of more service than we give. We have the opportunity to have our lives changed by the lessons we learn in Tanzania — lessons in humanitarianism, the importance of community, what poverty and wealth really mean.”\n\nBesides working in UC’s provost’s office, Lewis holds a faculty position as professor of family and community medicine. He had previously worked for the Office of Diversity and Inclusion at the College of Medicine where his commitment to fostering inclusiveness was evident through his student recruitment, retention and advising work while helping generate over $1.7 million in scholarship funding.\n\nThose who knew, taught and worked with Anndréa Moore when she was a UC student clearly saw a young woman on her way to great things. A Carl H. Lindner Honors PLUS Scholar, Darwin T. Turner Scholar and University Honors Distinguished Scholar, she received the Presidential Leadership Medal of Excellence in recognition of what she’d achieved on campus and what she seemed destined to accomplish going forward.\n\nHer professional career has taken her to Google, Apple, and Facebook, and she's received an advanced degree from Harvard Business School. From consulting with small and medium-sized businesses on digital marketing strategy to leading teams that launch global product features impacting millions of users, she has gladly shared her marketing and product growth expertise, including digital marketing, product storytelling, email engagement, and customer journey optimization. Her experience in the tech industry led her to see the vast potential in a formal network of her peers, so she founded and became CEO of Black Tech Women, growing it from a small online community to an organization of more than 3,000 members internationally. She now leads a team of 15 that executes partnerships with many premier tech companies toward advancing the community of black women to become senior leaders in the technology space.\n\nContinuing to focus on creating access and opportunity for others, Moore actively coaches and mentors others in their professional journeys. She advises with the Management Leadership for Tomorrow Career Fellows Program, coaching more than a dozen juniors across the country to secure internships in the technology, media and entertainment fields. She has also been a panelist and speaker at SxSW 2018, Tech Inclusion, the Black Enterprise Entrepreneurship Conference and the Google Online Marketing Challenge Summit."
