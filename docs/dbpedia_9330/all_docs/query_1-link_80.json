        "text": "Two suspects have been arrested in connection to a Rochester fire that and injured two firefighters.\n\nTiakalya Hendrix, 21, and Taquida Hendrix, 31, who are sisters, were arrested Tuesday, charged with second-degree murder and first-degree arson. The sisters pleaded not guilty in court Wednesday morning.\n\nThey are being held in the Monroe County Jail without bail.\n\n\"I hope this sends a message to those that think they can wreak havoc in our city, that we will hunt you down and make sure you will be held accountable,\" Mayor Malik Evans said during a press conference held Tuesday night.\n\nThe investigation found the pair used a flammable substance to light the front porch of the home on fire around 2 a.m. July 29, trapping Stovall on the second floor before he was rescued.\n\nStovall was brought to Strong Memorial Hospital with burns to more than 75% of his body, but he died from his injuries days later.\n\nThis was absolutely senseless for a little 5-year-old kid to lose his life because cowards and people with reckless regard for human life decided to set a porch on fire with no regard to the damage they could cause to an entire family and community,\" Evans said.\n\nStovall's 19-year-old babysitter, who was in the home at the time of the fire, was taken to Strong Memorial Hospital for smoke inhalation.\n\nTwo firefighters were hurt at the scene and remain out of work as they continue to recover, according to Rochester Police Captain Frank Umbrino.\n\n\"Malakai and his family had absolutely nothing to do with the tragedy that occurred,\" Umbrino said. \"They had no connection to anything that may have precipitated in the setting of the house on fire.\"\n\nStovall's mom, Brianna Akers, shared a statement with 13WHAM:\n\nI would like to say thank you to everyone that has helped find the people that did this to my son. I would also like to say to the people that would ever think that I would put my child in harms way intentionally or have a lifestyle that would put my child in harms way, you're evil and I just want to be able to grieve and remember my baby boy, my only baby boy in peace. I think we deserve that.\n\nIt was Malakai’s world, I was just living in it, and it is going to take a mountain of support for me to even have a glimpse of happiness of what Malakai brought to me.\n\nAgain, I would like to thank the Rochester Police Department and fire department for doing their absolute best.\n\nFor the people that killed my baby, I hope you see my precious boys face every single day and every night before you go to sleep. I will see you at every court case and send you letters in prison to remind you of what you’ve taken from me. A stranger, yet you’ve taken my whole world away.\n\nStovall's grandmother, Karen Mitchell, also shared a statement:\n\nWe the family of Malakai Stovall are elated to see that an arrest was made today, and we will now rely on the justice system to prosecute these people to the fullest extent of the law. Although nothing makes this right, this is the first step towards getting Kai Kai the justice he deserves. Our lives have forever been changed by this senseless act of violence and these people must pay.\n\nWe also continue to pray for the health of the two injured firefighters, and would like to express our most heartfelt gratitude to all of the firefighters who fought so hard to rescue our sweet Kai Kai.\n\nAdditional charges related to the firefighters' injuries may be presented to a grand jury at a later date."
