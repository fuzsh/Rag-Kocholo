        "text": "I. STOP POLITICAL BRIBERY\n\nMake it illegal for politicians to take money from lobbyists.Politicians get extraordinary sums of money in the form of campaign donations from the special interests who lobby them. In return, politicians create laws favorable to these special interests – even when those laws hurt voters.\n\nUnder the American Anti-Corruption Act, people who get paid to lobby cannot donate to politicians.\n\nBan lobbyist bundling.\n\nLobbyists regularly bundle together big contributions from their friends and colleagues and deliver them in one lump sum to politicians. This turns lobbyists into major fundraisers, giving politicians an incentive to keep them happy by working political favors.\n\nThe Act prohibits lobbyists from bundling contributions.\n\nClose the revolving door.Lobbyists and special interests routinely offer public officials high-paying lobbying jobs. Politicians and their staff routinely move straight from government to these lucrative lobbying jobs, where they get paid to influence their former colleagues.\n\nThe Act stops elected representatives and senior staff from selling off their government power for high-paying lobbying jobs, prohibits them from negotiating jobs while in office, and bars them from paid lobbying activity for several years once they leave.\n\nPrevent politicians from fundraising during working hours.Most federal politicians spend between 3 and 7 hours a day fundraising from big donors instead of working on issues that matter to voters.\n\nUnder the Act, politicians are prevented from raising money during the workday, when they should be serving their constituents.\n\n► Learn more about how we can crackdown on corruption\n\nIII. FIX OUR BROKEN ELECTIONS\n\nEnd gerrymandering.\n\nPoliticians are intentionally drawing the lines around voters in order to guarantee their own re-election and give their political party an unfair advantage.\n\nThe Anti-Corruption Act ends gerrymandering by creating independent, fully transparent redistricting commissions that follow strict guidelines to ensure accurate representation for all voters, regardless of political party.\n\n► Learn more about our plan to end gerrymandering\n\nLet all voters participate in open primaries.\n\nBy controlling the primaries, the political establishment controls which candidates we can vote on.\n\nThe Act makes all candidates for the same office compete in a single, open primary controlled by voters, not the political establishment. This gives voters more control over our elections and more choices at the ballot.\n\nLet voters rank their top candidates, avoid “spoilers.”\n\nOutdated voting systems force voters to choose between the “lesser of two evils” at the ballot box or vote for a “spoiler” candidate.\n\nUnder the Act, voters can rank their top candidates, allowing them to support their top choice without fear of inadvertently helping elect the other party’s candidate. If their top choice isn’t going to win, their vote transfers to their second choice, and so on. This makes it easier to elect independent-minded candidates who aren’t beholden to establishment special interests.\n\n► Learn more about our Ranked Choice Voting\n\nAutomatic voter registration.\n\nOur voter rolls and registration systems are outdated, error-prone, and costly. New and proven systems can save taxpayer money and ensure that all eligible voters are able to participate on Election Day.\n\nThe Act automatically registers all interested eligible voters when they interact with government agencies – whether it’s when they go to the DMV, get a hunting license, apply for food assistance, or sign up for the national guard. Voters can always opt-out from being registered. Information is transmitted electronically and securely to a central source maintained by the state.\n\n► Learn more about how we expand the freedom to vote\n\nVote at home or at the polls.\n\nElection Day is a mess. Forcing voters to take time off from work and their families to stand in long lines on a Tuesday is ineffective, insecure, and outdated.\n\nThe Act improves voter service by sending ballots to voters at home and allowing them to mail it back on their own timeframe, or drop it off at a professionally-staffed voting center. Voters can still vote in person or receive assistance at a voting center.\n\n► Learn more about vote-by-mail\n\nReasonable term limits.\n\nWhen elected officials are allowed to become career politicians, our elections become uncompetitive and new ideas have a harder time being heard.\n\nThe Act sets reasonable term limits of 18 years total at each level of government, so that candidates focus on public service instead of staying in office.\n\nChange how elections are funded.\n\nRunning a political campaign is expensive, but few Americans can afford to donate to political campaigns. That makes politicians dependent upon – and therefore responsive to – a tiny fraction of special-interest donors.\n\nThe Act offers every voter a small credit they can use to make a political donation with no out-of-pocket expense. Candidates and political groups are only eligible to receive these credits if they agree to fundraise solely from small donors. The Act also empowers political action committees that only take donations from small donors, giving everyday people a stronger voice in our elections."
