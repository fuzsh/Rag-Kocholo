        "text": "Lord Acton (1834-1902) was a nineteenth-century English historian, a Liberal Catholic who intensely disliked the counterrevolutionary direction down which the Church was headed under the leadership of Blessed Pius IX. He is a hero to many modern men and women who share his Enlightenment outlook on society, politics, and especially the meaning of freedom. These include the directors of a powerful and well-heeled American think tank, the Acton Institute, which has an enormous influence in Catholic circles around the entire western world.Acton is most well-known through his teaching that power tends to corrupt, and absolute power to corrupt absolutely. This dictum, repeated by constitutionalists and libertarians alike, is supposed to force those of us who justify Church and State use of power to face honestly the unpleasant truth about ourselves: that we are on the low road to becoming despicable tyrants or friends of tyranny. But it seems to me that a solid Catholic analysis of the Power Dictum leads to a quite different conclusion: that it is actually this teaching of Lord Acton which tends to corrupt, and the absolute dedication to promotion of his beliefs, represented by foundations like the Acton Institute, which corrupts absolutely. For the Actonian PD, in practice, reflects a Gnostic and Manichean vision totally incompatible with the one taught by the holy babe born in Bethlehem.Gnosticism is an ancient world view which argues that matter is evil and brought into being through the work of wicked demigods. It is the antithesis of the Christian belief that Creation is the loving gift of a good God who even offered it redemption once human sin caused His supernatural plan to go astray. Mani (216-276), a Third Century Persian religious leader, gave his name to the most successful Gnostic movement known to history. Manicheanism has owed its strength through the ages to the writings and organizational ability of its founder and his disciples. Both have promoted an extremely effective strategy of superficially accepting the varied religious and cultural beliefs they encounter in their missionary labors, and then deconstructing and redefining them to serve their own subversive purposes.Manichean Gnostics were very powerful in certain parts of Western Europe in the early Thirteenth Century. Many Christians were fooled by their policy of subtle cooption of familiar religious language to teach a message alien to orthodox Catholicism. But the Manichean Mayor of a well-known central Italian town found to his chagrin that one of his fellow-citizens had hit upon a sure-fire way of checkmating otherwise highly successful Gnostic maneuvers. The city was Assisi; the citizen, St. Francis; his tool, the crèche. St. Francis knew that thorough going Gnostics cringed at the thought of everything connected with childbirth and its announcement of the arrival of yet another lump of wicked matter into the universe. He counted on the fact that Manicheans from Assisi would turn away in disgust at the sight of the crèche, just as they literally spat at the feet of all pregnant women crossing their path. And when they did so, they would proclaim themselves to be implacable enemies to truly believing Christians, all of whom reacted lovingly to the babe in the crib, even when they could not grasp the import of intellectual attacks on the Incarnation.The message of that Incarnation is one of the need to redirect the entirety of fallen Creation to the glorification of God. Such a redirection is made possible through what St. Irenaeus calls the “recapitulation” of everything in Christ, the Word Incarnate. This recapitulation entailed Christ’s “gathering up” of each and every aspect of existence into one sublime effort to nurture and raise human persons to eternal life with the Trinity. That enterprise required recognition and redemption of all natural goods and relationships, in the manifold ways that history had developed and meshed them together, and with due respect for the intricate hierarchy of earthly and supernatural values.A number of the great Church Fathers of the Fourth and Fifth Centuries, the Cappadocian St. Gregory of Nyssa prominent among them, were fully awakened to what this message meant for Greco-Roman culture. They showed how an opening to the teaching of the Babe born in Bethlehem involved a new study of the thoughts and achievements of their civilization, from the time of Homer onwards, to see whether they might be mobilized to aid the task of salvation. What was required for the success of such an enterprise, they realized, was a docility to supernatural correction of their natural culture’s flaws, and a readiness to allow grace to guide its insights to uses much more exalted that anything it was capable of imagining when left purely to its own earthly devices.One of the most important elements of the Greco-Roman Tradition that the mainline of the Church Fathers appreciated and sought to mobilize for Christ was its clear sense of the importance of familial and state authority. The value of such authority for identifying and gaining possession of all that was beautiful in human life, the evils befalling men who fled from its corrective application, and its troublesome and seemingly insoluble problems, were brilliantly presented in the writings of the great men of classical culture, its Hesiods, Solon the Lawgivers, Platos, and Aristotles.Far from rejecting their brilliant insights, Christianity, with its teaching of submission to the authority of the Babe of Bethlehem, seemed to the Church Fathers to confirm them. Greco-Roman Christians were compelled to study, purify, complete, and transform what their forebears had already said and done in this realm. The Christian task was one of showing how a disciplining and coordination of all of the natural authorities, developed by complex and troublesome human experience under the supernatural authority of the Incarnate Word and His Church, could assure an infinitely more successful movement towards the True, Good, and Beautiful; a march from darkness to light which would be sublimely beneficial for society as a whole, all of its individual members, and the very holders of authority themselves.Men and women presented with the opportunity or need to wield a social authority built upon natural Greco-Roman foundations and purified by Christian teaching and grace, do not tend to be corrupted by it. What they tend to become, instead, is much more aware of the enormity of the burden that such authority places upon them to serve those subject to their control. Yes, it is very possible that this heightened sense of awareness may then lead them into a sinful hunt for ways of fleeing clear responsibilities, or cynical and hypocritical masquerading of abuse of power. On the other hand, it is also very possible that it will guide them down the pathway to sanctity.Those who meditate on the lessons of the crèche know that Mary and Joseph are there to press them down this road to holiness through willing acceptance of authority. The blessed couple of Bethlehem said “yes” to a sublime authority over Christ which it exercised for quite some time, raising the God-Man to adulthood and providing us the model for the Holy Family in the process. All parents and fathers of nations who embrace their varied forms of social authority under analogous circumstances can be transformed in Christ and attain personal perfection through their decision. They can become ever more conscious of flaws they need to overcome in order to fulfill their responsibilities to their charges properly. They can, under the pressure of that responsibility, become ever more aware of inner talents that they had no previous knowledge of possessing.Nineteenth-century counterrevolutionary Catholics were part of a movement of rediscovery of the fullness of the Christian past leading them back to the insights of Church Fathers regarding the message of the Incarnation and the consequences for human perfection of the full cooperation of nature and grace. They eagerly applied what they learned to one of the burning questions of their own day, the relationship of authority and individual freedom. Article after article in journals such as the Jesuit review, La Civiltà Cattolica emphasized the conviction that strong natural and supernatural authority was a precondition for the perfection of personal liberty as well as all other human goods. For obedience to the fullness of authority was bound to ensure the fullest opportunity for self-correction and introduction to the Truth that really set men free. Rejection or limitation of the fullness of authority, on the other hand, entailed an opening to passion and a stubborn commitment to ignorance which was certain to work in favor of the strong, at the expense of the weak, but to the ultimate disadvantage and perdition of both.\n\nWhen the right of command, or authority, is exercised in all its fullness, then all individuals, even the most weak, may use in all fullness their own rights; with the result that the fullness of liberty corresponds precisely to the fullness of authority….”[note]Taparelli, Di una apologia catholic deli ordain rappresentativi”, ii, 1 (1853), 273n.[/note]\n\n“And the truth is that this freedom, as any other unlimited liberty not circumscribed by anything, is nothing other than the privilege agreed upon for the strong to assassinate the weak. In this case, the freedom of the strong is offended, since he is given the arbitrary ability to abuse his faculty, and the freedom of the weak is offended, as he remains the undefended victim of the abuse.[note]Curci, “Una censure della stamps”, iii, 1 (1856), 387.[/note]"
