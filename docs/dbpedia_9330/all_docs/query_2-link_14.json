I think you would find no expert in the field of sociopathy/psychopathy/antisocial personality disorder who would dispute this...That a small minority of human beings literally have no conscience was and is a bitter pill for our society to swallow â€” but it does explain a great many things, shamelessly deceitful political behavior being one.\"\n\nIn short, political power attracts those most likely to compulsively seek power to the point of casting aside ethical norms. During those times when ethical norms themselves are in a weakened, conflicted condition in a society, the problem is magnified.\n\nWhy does absolute power corrupt absolutely? If a person is benevolent why would it?\n\nBecause the acquisition of power changes a person considerably. No matter how benevolent and down-to-earth they were before. If an ordinary person suddenly gets great power and influence, their lifestyle and way of thinking gets transformed due to their new position in the world. With absolute power, the ruler also has no accountability to anyone and, as such, no consequences to fear.\n\nWhen someone experiences such a massive change in their life, it will inevitably change them as a person and no one is immune to this, you need a special mindset to not go power mad in such a position as the temptation is massive.\n\nThis statement is really just a democracy-centered narrative and is not necessarily true in all circumstances. The fact is, power is relative, and there is no such thing as absolute power. Even kings and emperors have to worry about mass stability at the bottom even if they have no political rivals at the top. The very fact that people have to be obsessed with acquiring power or maintaining control shows that said person, business, or regime's power is not stable and absolute. This is especially true in nominal democracy regimes where one party gained prominence over other rival parties through unconstitutional means. However, a person, business, or regime that rules or dominates through constitutional means and does not actually have to worry about losing power to rival factions often DO act for the benefit of the common good because it does not actually have to waste significant time or effort at preventing losing power or competition to rivals and only have to worry about mass satisfaction (or external threats/competition). For this reason, business monopolies or authoritarian regimes do not necessarily hamper growth. It's like food, only poor people fight over it. But rich people have plenty of resources and time to invest in other things, and food became only a bare minimum and not something that they spend most of their time fighting over.\n\nThe fact is, power is relative,\n\nBeat me to it; I've run across some pretty corrupt local politicians and civil servants who in reality are no more than tiny fish in a very big pond.\n\nI agree that there's no such thing as absolute power in a philosophical sense.However, in reality, having the power of life and death over everyone around comes pretty close. Does that level of power always corrupt? I really don't know.\n\nGreat power may corrupt because of the perception that there are no personal consequences.\n\nOf course it may also be true that such power does not necessarily corrupt the individual at all. It may simply be that such a person forms very different moral values than ordinary people without such power. EG He/she may have concepts such as doing things for the greater good, even if at the expense of a minority. Or even more basic, may have come to think that overall, the world operates on one and only one principle; \" the ends justify the means\". Such a core value would free the powerful man to behave in any way he saw fit. That would make him very corrupt to most people.\n\nIt does not matter how benevolent you are, if you have the power to do as you will, not everything you do will be seen as benevolent by all persons unto whom you do it.\n\nAnd when pother people try to STOP you from being benevolent... how do you respond?\n\nHitler did not see himself as a villain. He saw himself as a savoir.\n\nI am reminded of the old sci fi classic Forbidden Planet, about hos a race of aliens came up with a machine that would instantly manifest their desires, confident in their own evolved benevolence. Only to be destroyed by the demons from their own Id. Their animal jealousies, passions, and cravings.\n\nAnd of the dunning kreuger effect. Anyone who thinks they are entirely benevolent is certainly delusional to some extent. Or do you choose as a ruler the person who is certain he is not perfect? The one who admits his limitations?\n\nWhen you are all powerful, even in the limited context of wealth and fame, you end up surrounded by people whose own limited self interest is to keep you satisfied, in saying yes to every demand, and never telling you things you don't like to hear. You end up isolated from reality, Like a Michael Jackson, or Elon Musk, and what effect does that insulation from adverse opinion and denial have on your own personal development? What happens to the benevolent man when he lives in a palace surrounded by yes men where everything he desires is within his easy grasp?\n\nPower corrupts because power is an AMPLIFIER. It magnifies our smallest foible into dictates that afflict millions. It takes the ordinary obliviousness of other's we all suffer from at times but rather than hurt the feelings of a spouse, or child or friend, it multiplies it into an injury to entire classes of people.\n\nWe are never so smart that we can foresee ALL the potential consequences of any action we take. For most of is this shortsightedness affects only us, the ripples of our mistakes spread only thru our immediate circle. But for the powerful, even their best intentioned short sightedness creates tidal waves that might inundate millions.\n\nPure speculation here, but it I believe it is elated to humans' Darwinian origins. The more an animal can control its environment the more likely its survival. With human consciousness providing an almost open-ended list of potential wants even beyond survival, the quest for the power to acquire those wants can drive a relentless quest for power.

A portion of such people start out in a quest for wealth, but the list of wealthy people who eventually move to the political realm is a disturbingly long one. A pretty decent indicator of honesty in those who wield substantial economic power is the degree to which they avoid politics.\n\nDr. Martha Stout, a psychologist and author of The Sociopath Next Door, put this in psychological terms when she commented in 2012 that:\n\n\"Politicians are more likely than people in the general population to be sociopaths. I think you would find no expert in the field of sociopathy/psychopathy/antisocial personality disorder who would dispute this...That a small minority of human beings literally have no conscience was and is a bitter pill for our society to swallow â€” but it does explain a great many things, shamelessly deceitful political behavior being one.\"\n\nIn short, political power attracts those most likely to compulsively seek power to the point of casting aside ethical norms. During those times when ethical norms themselves are in a weakened, conflicted condition in a society, the problem is magnified.\n\nNot just that. People, being social animals by nature, love power. Even when thrust into a position of power by chance, like inheriting a throne, they want to keep it and extend it as much as possible, which often requires doing some nasty things. Very few give it up voluntarily, and those who do often lose more than just the power. That's why separation of powers and constitutional process is required.\n\nHave you ever been in a position of absolute power? Personally, I don't know what would happen to me if born to a throne.\n\nWhat is the purpose of this question given that the answer is obvious? There's plenty of historic examples of people who have been in such a position, both of people who became better or worse for it. In which case I don't need personal experience to judge the validity of the quote, I only need to review the historical examples.\n\nI myself will probably give it away if I was in such a position like macaquerie said. Too much responsibility/stress, not enough faith in my own competence/foresight, one mistake could cause the deaths of millions and I don't want that on my head, etc. etcâ€¦\n\nIf those types of people are the only types you can think of then you are either cherry-picking examples or those are the only types of history you studied.\n\nPlus, are you claiming the peoples in your list were morally better people before gaining \"absolute\" power? (Quotes because as heavenlykaghan pointed out, power is relative and never truly absolute). Because I don't see evidence of this, even when in jail Hitler was quite a giant racist and you can tell from the Mein Kampf (the book he wrote while in jail) that this was a person who could have committed something like the Holocaust.\n\nCan you give some examples of people who after reaching absolute power remained decent human beings? Only George Washington comes to my mind, but his power was still far from absolute.\n\nYou'd have to define what corrupt or corruption means, or for that matter what power is exactly. One way to look at it is that all power gives you the ability to enforce your will. If you force someone to do something against their will, that is corruption. Another way to look at it is what it takes to uphold power or absolute power. More often than not it requires you to corrupt the societal structures. Ie. place people who support you in charge of things. If you look at things from the perspective of human rights, freedoms, and democracy, then the only morally right thing that a person with power can do is give that power away. Apart from rare exceptions, it always goes the other way. Such people try to gain more power, ignoring more and more of their own rules and morals, and at the same time corrupting the institutions, laws and establishments of their own societies.\n\nAnd should we look at it from the opposite viewpoint, from a society whose only value is to hold absolute power, it still corrupts the functions of the society as the support for that power can only be bought by corruption. It always goes against meritocracy and is one of the main reasons why Empires seem to collapse suddenly...for example because the main military command is controlled by prestigious nobles due to \"birthright\", as opposed to a commander who actually knows what they are doing. There is really no way to use power to hold on to that power that isn't a corrupted action in some way. And in that regard it doesn't really matter what the rules of the society are. Because whatever the rules of the society are, power allows you to disregard those rules."
