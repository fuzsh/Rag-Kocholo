        "text": "I love this question. It is one of the most fascinating dynamics of Star Wars, in my opinion.\n\nSummary answer first, then I'll back it all up.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe Jedi knew the Republic was corrupt, but went along with it because:\n\nThey didn't know just how bad it was.\n\nThere was nothing better at their disposal.\n\nThey were happily complacent in their bubble where they can just pretend evil does not exist and hide the dark side from their students.\n\nThey were too arrogant to open their minds to the idea that the Dark Lord of the Sith was not only in their presence, but actually had power over them.\n\nThe dark side of the Force was masking the Sith presence.\n\nBy the time they figured it out, they had little choice.\n\nOBLIVIOUS TO HOW BAD\n\nI think the Jedi knew the Republic was corrupt. They were simply in denial. In Attack of the Clones, Count Dooku explained that Qui-Gon Jinn knew all about the corruption in the Senate, but went along with it. He also said that Qui-Gon would not have gone along with it if he were aware the the Dark Lord of the Sith was controlling it. This makes sense. They knew it was bad... but not that bad.\n\nNOTHING BETTER\n\nWhat could they have done? It's not like there was a second Galaxy-wide democratic government they could switch their allegiance to. As Obi-Wan put it:\n\nOBI-WAN: Anikan, my allegiance is to the Republic, to democracy!\n\nEven if true democracy wasn't really in the Republic anymore, the Republic was the symbol of democracy, politically. What else would the Jedi protect?\n\nARROGANCE & COMPLACENCY\n\nI think the Jedi had become arrogant and complacent. Yoda even admitted to the arrogance:\n\nOBI-WAN: His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.\n\nYODA: Yes, a flaw more and more common among Jedi these days. Even the older, more experienced ones.\n\nMace Windu and Ki-Adi-Mundi demonstrated their absolute confidence that Count Dooku would never murder anybody:\n\nMACE WINDU: You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone, it is not in his character.\n\nKI-ADI-MUNDI: He is a political idealist, not a murderer.\n\nIn The Phantom Menace, Mace Windu says the Sith could not have returned without their knowing.\n\nMACE WINDU: I do not believe the Sith could have returned without our knowing.\n\nYODA: Hard to see, the dark side is.\n\nVISION CLOUDED BY DARK SIDE\n\nYoda and Mace Windu discussed their inability to see what was going on:\n\nYODA: Blind we are, if creation of this clone army, we could not see.\n\nMACE WINDU: I think it is time we inform the Senate our ability to use the Force has diminished.\n\nThe Dark side was clouding their vision:\n\nPALPATINE: Master Yoda, do you think it will really come to War?\n\nYODA: The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see, the future is.\n\nConfirmed by Count Dooku:\n\nDOOKU: What if I told you that the Republic was under the control of the Dark Lord of the Sith?\n\nOBI-WAN: Impossible. The Jedi would be aware of it.\n\nDOOKU: The dark side of the Force has clouded their vision my friend. Hundreds of senators are under the influence of a Sith Lord, called, Darth Sidious.\n\nWookieepedia backs this up: https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_training\n\nThe Sith were trained to mask their presence.\n\nFEAR OF THE DARK SIDE\n\nIn Revenge of the Sith, Palpatine/Darth Sidious explained that the Jedi stick to their dogmatic comfort zone.\n\nANAKIN: You know the dark side?!?\n\nPALPATINE: Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.\n\nfrom https://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-Revenge-of-the-Sith.html\n\nThis backs up how strongly against the dark side the Jedi had become. They were so convinced it was pure evil, wrong, and most arrogantly, that it was eliminated from the galaxy. In the old days, the Jedi used to teach students about the dark side. They understood the dark side. They knew what its strengths were, and they knew its risks. They knew how to avoid its temptations. In the time of the movies, they had become so set in their ways that they didn't bother talking about the dark side other than telling students that it is bad.\n\nShortly before Revenge of the Sith and near the end of the Clone Wars, Yoda is approached by the ghost of Qui-Gon Jinn and brought through trials where his internal dark side is tested. This was done to prepare him because it was clear that in order to survive the imminent Great Jedi Purge, they needed a Jedi who understood the dark side, was comfortable with it, and could avoid its temptations at all cost. He was put through a dream where he could learn who the mysterious Dark Lord of the Sith is in order to defeat him, but the cost would involve Yoda himself succumbing to the dark side.\n\nSee https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Destiny_(episode)\n\nUltimately, the wisdom that Yoda gained from this, which is that the Jedi are going to lose, the dark side must be understood rather than dismissed, and someone who can handle the dark side must survive at all costs. This, in my opinion, is why Yoda flees his fight with Palpatine. It becomes clear to him that the odds of him defeating Palpatine in direct combat are, at best, 50/50, and perhaps worse. There is more at stake than him winning a battle. He had to put his ego aside and run away for the greater good. Compare this with Mace Windu, who bet everything on hand-to-hand combat, and never considered that he was being manipulated.\n\nYoda is the only Jedi who got it. Aside from Yoda, I think they were all so complacent that they didn't see any reason to resist the corruption.\n\nNotice what went differently in Luke Skywalker's training. Yoda taught Luke about the dark side. He exposed him directly to evil temptations in a way where Luke could easily observe the consequences of it. Because of this training, Luke was able to use his inner darkness (fear, anger, hate) to defeat Darth Vader, without himself succumbing to the Dark Side. It was about balance.\n\nA bit of a tangent, but I think it's all related.\n\nNO OTHER OPTIONS\n\nThe Jedi knew the system was corrupt, but it was the best thing around, and they didn't know the Sith were manipulating it, through a combination of arrogance and the Sith hiding their presence extremely well. Simply put, the Jedi lived in a bubble and didn't figure out what was happening until it was too late.\n\nThe Jedi were backed into a corner. When they began to sense the dark side around them, there was really nothing they could do.\n\nMACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.\n\nKI-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grevious, then he should be removed from office.\n\nMACE WINDU: The Jedi Council would have to take control of the senate in order to secure a peaceful transition.\n\nYODA: To a dark place this line of thought could carry us. Great care we must take.\n\nFalse Premise\n\nSurely the Jedi knew the Republic was a democracy in name only\n\nThis isn't correct. It was a democracy. A corrupt democracy at times, sure, but a democracy nonetheless.\n\nThe fact that it was so inept in its handling of Naboo during the Trade dispute of Episode I and was so easily manipulated by Darth Sidious doesn't by itself make it worse than any other form of government.\n\nIn Episode II, Padme even tells Anakin that the government's biggest problem was disagreement, not corruption or structure as you imply:\n\nPADME: You really don't like politicians, do you?\n\nANAKIN: I like two or three, but I'm not really sure about one of them. (smiling) I don't think the system works.\n\nPADME: How would you have it work?\n\nANAKIN: We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems, agree what's in the best interests of all the people, and then do it.\n\nPADME: That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't always agree. In fact, they hardly ever do.\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Clones Script\n\nThe Republic's Ideals\n\nThe Jedi were firm believers in the Republic's democratic ideals, ideals many real-life people share. In Episode III, Obi-Wan echos that sentiment saying:\n\nAnakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy!\n\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Sith Script\n\nI feel like I shouldn't need to spend time arguing the virtues of democracy so I'll just say it's generally accepted that democracy = good and dictatorship = bad.\n\n20/20 Hindsight\n\nDespite our feelings on how good of a government The Republic was, we cannot argue with history. According to Sio Bibble in Episode II:\n\nThere hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic.\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Clones Script\n\nThat's 1000 years of relatively little conflict. 1000 years. In a fictional universe characterized by the title, STAR WARS, I'd say that's pretty darn successful.\n\nBy comparison, the Old Republic saw Sith Wars, the Mandalorian War and more. The Galactic Empire was so poorly run, it only lasted 25 years or so. Now, with new movies and books rolling out, we're seeing a New Republic that after only 30 years in place has had its capitol completely destroyed and new conflict raging.\n\nHistory tells us that The Republic is the most successful government the galaxy far, far away has ever seen.\n\nIt's hard to fault the Jedi for fighting to preserve it.\n\nIt's much like today's politics (who would have guessed?) that the Republic itself is not corrupt. A lot of people found ways to abuse the system, but that is not the same.\n\nEven worse, the Republic worlds themselves had to a degree armed forces and while the Jedi are very well trained in battle, they are not an army.\n\nAdditionally, the first people to suffer horribly during a probably bloody revolution would be the poor that cannot afford to get out of harms way. So the first thing the Jedi would have done in an uprising would have been to bring a lot more suffering to the people.\n\nAlso violence is a Jedi's last measure and it has to be. If the Jedi would use violence too much, they'd risk drifting towards the dark side - not all of them of course, but some would. These would add to the problem of the Jedi being severly outnumbered already in such a case.\n\nFinally, the Jedi believe in democracy but in general they are apolitical. They do not interfere with daily politics. It could be seen as being reclusive by outsiders, but if you look at the Jedi philosophy, that this behaviour is actually in line with it. The Jedi try to be calm and serene which is doubtful to maintain if they take an active political role - also it might antagonize the general population if they did. Powerful beings striving to make politics wouldn't be looked upon too kind by others.\n\nSo any kind of uprising by or with help of the Jedi would likely yield catastrophic results. It would be totally against the Jedi philosophy to risk that.\n\nI think the question exposes an interesting thematic tension that really came to a head in the \"prequel\" movies. In the original trilogy, Jedi were seen as \"good\" and Sith as \"evil\". In reality, that is clearly not the original intention, and Lucas was interested in a more subtle take on what Jedi were supposed to be. A better dichotomy between the \"prequels\" Sith and Jedi might be \"passive\" versus \"agressive\". This reflects, to some extent, some of the differences between Western philosophy and theology, and Eastern mystical theory. In Eastern thought systems, \"balance\" might be considered more important than dualistic \"good vs evil\" splits.\n\nWhat is the difference? In Western classical theology, good cannot be passive. It cannot simply tolerate evil, or it ceases to be good. Those who sit by and let evil happen, while not actively engaging in the evil themselves, are certainly morally culpable, since to be purely \"good\" is to actively resist evil, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Western mythology and classical folklore is filled with heroes who resist evil in the face of overwhelming opposition, and paint those who sit by and allow evil to happen in a very poor light.\n\nIn Eastern mythology and tradition, things aren't always so simple. Concepts of \"harmony\" and \"balance\" can push up against the moral imperative to resist evil. Not only that, but the Confucian respect for elders, betters, and existing institutions can override an individualistic (more \"Western) moral demand on those who are \"good\" to stand even against their own government/society.\n\nTo us old school, O.G. Star Wars fans, this was a bit confusing, because Jedi were called \"knights, which seemed to imply a more \"Western\" view. On the other hand, as the movies continued, the Jedi philosophy seemed to mirror Eastern philosophy more and more. By the time the \"prequel\" movies came out, it was pretty clear that the consistent direction Lucas had been heading for quite a while was the \"Eastern\" school of philosophy. Jedi were not \"good\" in the classical, Western sense. They had no problem living alongside and tolerating corruption in the Republic because they sought \"balance\", \"harmony\", and a lack of emotional upheaval far more than \"justice\". Justice is a disruptive notion, and we see in the Prequels repeatedly that Jedi are not Western paladins crusading against evil, but more like mandarins who are part of the \"celestial bureaucracy, sitting in their circular room and debating the best way to preserve balance.\n\nThis almost naturalistic view of Jedi might even explain the Midi-chlorian heresy. The universe as a whole is basically seen as an organic system and the Jedi are merely white blood cells moving around combating viruses. The viruses themselves are part of nature (thus, there can be no final victory of \"good\") and even the question of who is a Jedi is determined by cosmic forces beyond anyone's control. Jedi are a mere instrumentality or organs of a totally impersonal, amoral universe that ebbs and flows like a tide between \"dark\" and \"light\".\n\nNeedless to say, a lot of O.G. Star Wars fans never liked this (basically depressing) cosmology and eventually rejected Lucas himself rather than give up on the image of the heroic, crusading Luke challenging Vader to a hopeless duel to save his friends even though he had no chance. In a final irony, many people attribute Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces as a major source of inspiration for the original movie. Campbell based his work largely on a Western mythological basis which strongly assume Western values (like a small group of freedom fighters seeking justice in the teeth of overwhelming odds, willing to completely throw away balance and harmony to do it, and individuals convinced of their moral virtue in the face of every political and cultural authority). In the end, in my opinion, your question hits on the central weakness of the \"prequel\" movies themselves. Star Wars had retreated from the messy necessity of clear black and white morals and heroes that people can root for in favor of a patina of mystical moralistic dodging and naturalistic cynicism. It became so hard to distinguish \"good\" versus \"evil\" in this environment that Lucas had to literally have Anakin walk through a Jedi temple and massacre children to finally differentiate him from everyone else. In the process, he broke the character's inner integrity, but that is another discussion.\n\nThe original question is flawed.\n\nWhere in all of Earth's history has there ever been a non flawed and thus non corrupt realm? When has there ever been a society with 100 percent totally good ideals? When has there ever been a society where all members and all officials always followed their society's ideals (good and bad) 100 percent?\n\nNever, never, never.\n\nIf the Jedi are the peacekeepers of the Republic, their job is to end conflicts in the republic. Presumably violent conflicts. And if the Galactic Republic doesn't have an army or navy at the time of The Phantom Menace the main method the Jedi and the Republic they serve use must be diplomacy.\n\nSo basically the Jedi reason with the groups in conflict and get them to agree to a compromise that satisfies both groups, at least enough to stop fighting.\n\nNo doubt there were a lot of things wrong with the Galactic Republic, enough that Palpatine saw that it could fall soon and sought to make certain that it would fall to him and the Sith and not to someone else.\n\nBut if the Republic's default method of handling armed conflicts between members is to send ace negotiators to persuade the two sides to make a peaceful compromise, and if that usually works quickly, then in that important respect the Galactic Republic at its worst was far better than most historic and contemporary governments on Earth, probably including RichS's own national government.\n\nSo RichS might as well ask why any more or less \"good\" person has ever served any flawed and partially evil and partially corrupt government, and - since every known government has been flawed and partially evil and partially corrupt - thus why any more or less \" good \" person has ever served any government by seeking to preserve peace and avoid bloody civil war.\n\nThe Jedi were religious fanatics. Religious fanatics are not well known for readily changing their path in reaction to circumstances; they instead will tend to stick to the old way of doing things in hopes that the situation will change again so that their actions make sense again in context.\n\nI can provide evidence both of the Jedi being religious fanatics as well as the actions of religious fanatics if you really need, but both have such an overwhelming preponderance of commonly known evidence that I haven't bothered.\n\nEdit: What are some common traits amongst religious fanatics? Mind you, we distinguish here between those who deeply believe and those who are obsessed with their religion.\n\nThe fanatic will typically form a group and their first act will be to secure their borders from outsiders. I'm not talking about having a holy sanctuary that only believers may enter. I mean to minimize contact between the believers and those who are not believers. Jonestown is an extreme example where the believers left the continent. But it can actually be more subtle than that, taking over a neighborhood and having private security patrols can act similarly. Said patrols may just be members of the community.\n\nOnce the true believers have sectioned themselves off, the next phase begins. Classically a charismatic person or council will be in charge and dominate the lives of those under them, casting as absolute evil those who do not agree with them as heathens- and I'm not just talking about people of other religions but people who argue their interpretations are also anathema.\n\nTo ensure their control, those in charge will begin to enact their own arbitrary rules which will typically make no sense to anybody outside of the religion. Not to put too fine a point on it, it's usually something sex related. It might be that all are married to the leader, it might be pedophilia, it might be genital mutilation, it might be enforced virginity. Doing so will often be seen as a path to purity as well as a sign of devotion. It is also a way of ensuring that people are obedient. This will typically be seen as a sign or mark of the people.\n\nNow that the True Believers are marked, the next phase begins. By this point the folks will likely go along with just about anything since they've already left everyone and everything in their lives that they cared about for the religion and even sacrificed something with their genitals. Now is typically where weird stuff with children begins. There will usually be kids and the religion will begin to raise them to also be True Believers. The only book they are told that they ever need to read is their holy book, because it contains all the answers to any question that they may have. All other books are full of lies because they come from outsiders, all of whom are liars and evil. But being faithful makes the True Believers wealthier, stronger, smarter, better looking than the outsiders.\n\nIf the group grows large enough and lasts long enough, they eventually break out like a zit and begin to enact their will upon the people around them, insisting that others must live to their own rules and laws and commandments. The Believers will enforce that rule wherever they can. They will often believe that their belief makes them right, makes them the only ones who are right or who can be right, gives them the strength to enforce the necessary rules. Contrary to what folks may think, this may not be a stage where they forcibly convert others; not all religions believe in that. But they will outright reject the freedoms of others to enforce their own rules.\n\nSo, let's look at these points through Jedi lenses.\n\nThe Jedi have formed their own group (the Jedi) with their own training school and such.\n\nThe Jedi have a council. Those who disagree with the council are labeled as Dark Siders. Not a friendly term in the slightest. They are of course the brightest and wisest of the Jedi and therefore the brightest and wisest folks around.\n\nNo Jedi make other little Jedi. They don't wear their virginity but they carry light sabers to distinguish them from others around them.\n\nJedi will kidnap the children of other people to raise among their own (they have to since none may marry and have children). They'll present it as a great opportunity. They will instead be instructed in the Secrets and Mysteries of the Order. All the Padawans need to do with their lives in study the Force. Doing so makes them better than those around them.\n\nThey become interplanetary cops. That doesn't appear to be an official job. They carry no badges of authority to indicate legitimacy of their actions. Instead, they just intimidate people around them with their magic to enforce their own particular morality on people. Any who disagree are destroyed or, if the Jedi is in a good mood, has their mind clouded. The Jedi will go to a planet which has nothing to do with them, that has its own rules and laws and traditions and beliefs and enforce their own morality.\n\nEdit: I mean, take a moment to really picture this. You're in your hometown, doing your everyday business. Out of nowhere a group of folks in a foreign (that is, not locally practiced) religion that practices magic suddenly appear one day, swaggering around, telling everybody that suddenly your way of life is against their rules and you have to abide by how they want you to live. They go to your government and demand changes in the laws to reflect their beliefs, and if they don't like what they hear, they will straight up kill your ruler and overthrow the government at need. And you know they'll do this because they've done it before. They seem nice and reasonable as long as things are going their way, but anybody who disagrees with them finds a core of steel, and they will lie, trick, or straight up hypnotize you if you disagree so that you end up allowing them to do what they want anyway. Which seems to be for everybody to follow their religious tenets while they swagger through the streets with lethal weaponry strapped to their sides ready to go. Did I mention that they are the only ones allowed to use that weaponry? Because they are.\n\nDo these really sound like good guys to you?\n\nEdit: just spotted this article which discusses these ideas with regard to the original trilogy, and how Luke becomes a religious extremist here."
