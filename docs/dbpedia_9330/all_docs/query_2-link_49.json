        "text": "“In this eye-opening debut study, Frerick, an agricultural policy fellow at Yale University, reveals the ill-gained stranglehold that a handful of companies have on America’s food economy…It’s a disquieting critique of private monopolization of public necessities.” --Publishers Weekly, starred\n\nBarons is the story of seven corporate titans, their rise to power, and the consequences for everyone else. Take Mike McCloskey, Chairman of Fair Oaks Farms. In a few short decades, he went from managing a modest dairy herd to running the Disneyland of agriculture, where school children ride trams through mechanized warehouses filled with tens of thousands of cows that never see the light of day. What was the key to his success? Hard work and exceptional business savvy? Maybe. But more than anything else, Mike benefitted from deregulation of the American food industry, a phenomenon that has consolidated wealth in the hands of select tycoons, and along the way, hollowed out the nation’s rural towns and local businesses.\n\nAlong with Mike McCloskey, readers will meet a secretive German family that took over the global coffee industry in less than a decade, relying on wealth traced back to the Nazis to gobble up countless independent roasters. They will discover how a small grain business transformed itself into an empire bigger than Koch Industries, with ample help from taxpayer dollars. And they will learn that in the food business, crime really does pay—especially when you can bribe and then double-cross the president of Brazil.\n\nThese, and the other stories in this book, are simply examples of the monopolies and ubiquitous corruption that today define American food. The tycoons profiled in these pages are hardly unique: many other companies have manipulated our lax laws and failed policies for their own benefit, to the detriment of our neighborhoods, livelihoods, and our democracy itself. Barons paints a stark portrait of the consequences of corporate consolidation, but it also shows we can choose a different path. A fair, healthy, and prosperous food industry is possible—if we take back power from the barons who have robbed us of it.\n\n\"In this eye-opening debut study, Frerick, an agricultural policy fellow at Yale University, reveals the ill-gained stranglehold that a handful of companies have on America’s food economy…It’s a disquieting critique of private monopolization of public necessities.\"\n\nPublishers Weekly, starred\n\n\"Wow. This is one important book… If you want to know how corporations control the food supply, start here.\"\n\nMarion Nestle, Food Politics\n\n\"[Frerick] dissects not only the food barons’ business practices, but also the disastrous impacts of these practices… The author, who frequently sounds as though he is fighting to control his personal rage at the people he’s writing about, backs up his statements with facts and figures. This is an angry and accusatory book, but also a fair and well-documented one.\"\n\nBooklist\n\n\"After reading [Austin's] book, I have come away with a completely different idea of agriculture that I cannot unsee.\"\n\nBloomberg Odd Lots\n\n\"For readers with a serious interest in public policy and food production.\"\n\nLibrary Journal\n\n\"In a carefully researched book, Frerick makes ordinary insider knowledge both compelling and urgent.\"\n\nDaily Yonder\n\n\"[Frerick] has a knack for making explicit the connections between policy and the concrete realities of people’s lives... [Barons is] an indictment of our regulatory system and the many ways the government — under both Democratic and Republican administrations — has failed to break up monopolies, prevent them in the first place, or meaningfully hold them accountable for wrongdoing. \"\n\nFERN\n\n\"[One of] my top book picks so far this year.\"\n\nBloomberg Odd Lots Newsletter\n\n\"Frerick’s skill as both a serious academic and gifted storyteller keeps the pages turning as his colorful cast of characters build empires with everyday dinner items like pork chops, milk, coffee and strawberries.\"\n\nAlan Guebert, Farmers Advance\n\n\"Frerick’s greatest strength is in drawing out the federal, state, and local policies (and policymakers) that fueled the rise of the captains of industry he profiles.\"\n\nAmerican Prospect\n\n\"Some may herald Barons as an overdue update of 'The Jungle,' the 1906 book by Upton Sinclair.\"\n\nBleeding Heartland\n\n\"Rookie Austin Frerick has smacked a homerun in his first swing at authoring a book.\"\n\nMilkweed\n\n\"Time will tell whether Austin Frerick’s Barons joins that elite list [of classic books on the food system]. It certainly could given how well he’s structured the story, how seamlessly he grapples with complex policy, and how effortlessly he guides readers through the consequences to so much of American real estate, so many communities, and so many people.\"\n\nMode Shift\n\n\"It’s an important and compelling read...Frericks book... is a shot across the bow of the corporatocracy.\"\n\nRobert Leonard, Deep Midwest: Politics and Culture\n\n\"Through engaging and richly researched storytelling...Frerick deftly illuminates how decades of big-business-friendly government officials have worked to undermine and reverse labor, environmental and other laws.\"\n\nLittle Village Mag\n\n\"Frerick takes apart [the barons’] strategies patiently and methodically, almost as though he is turning an engine upside down to figure out its workings... Though his writing style is restrained, it simmers with damning facts and figures.\"\n\nAmbrook Research\n\n\"Although the vehicle of stories about each of these barons in turn is an interesting read, what I found most valuable was the final chapter where frerick lays out a way forward.\"\n\nOrganic Broadcaster\n\n\"Each chapter of Frerick’s book is based on a tremendous amount of research, as well as anecdotal scenes of the author’s personal contacts with US agriculture. His prose is refreshingly accessible and nonacademic.\"\n\nLos Angeles Review of Books\n\n\"Frerick is a staunch Democrat, but if there is one issue where the left and the populist right can make common cause, it’s farm policy.... Conservatives should read Frerick’s book.\"\n\nAmerican Conservative\n\n\"The Best Books of Spring 2024… Frerick yanks back the curtain on a truly astonishing collection of violations, legal and moral in the American food system… Despite the dire subject matter, Frerick is able to inject moments of humor and ends the book with sincere hope for change in the future if we are willing to work together to make a difference.\"\n\nElectric Literature\n\n\"[Barons] Illuminates some dark and shady corners of our food system, where companies you’ve heard of and others you surely haven’t operate in ways that ruthlessly seek profit at everyone else’s expense.\"\n\nThe Equation, Union of Concerned Scientists\n\n\"In his highly readable book, Frerick describes the businesses of barons who dominate seven sectors of the US food industry. In the process he illuminates much in recent American history and goes a long way towards diagnosing environmental ills, socio-economic ills, and the ill health of so many food consumers…. For people not already deeply familiar with industrial agribusiness and its associated environmental, labor, health and political ills, Barons is a compelling read.\"\n\nResilience\n\n\"The impact of these companies can be felt globally and makes the book essential reading.\"\n\nSlow Food UK\n\n\"What is interesting about Barons is that it appeals to people on different spectrums politically and that's a rare achievement these days.\"\n\nMichael T. Roberts, Professor of Policy at UCLA School of Law and Executive Director of the Resnick Center for Food Law and Policy\n\n\"Barons is an explosive and absolutely riveting tour through a hidden world of big-money powerhouses that control our food system. Frerick is a fantastic storyteller, with the rare combination of on-the-ground empathy for rural communities and sparklingly brilliant analysis. This book is essential to understand our new food system, and the dangers it poses to everyone who eats.\"\n\nChristopher Leonard, author of 'The Meat Racket' and 'Kochland'\n\n\"Austin is one of the most important and exciting voices in the next generation, and he lays out a road map to bring about a delicious revolution that addresses climate, health, and taste.\"\n\nAlice Waters, founder and owner of Chez Panisse\n\n\"Frerick traces the items in our grocery carts to uncover a radical consolidation of economic power that has put our communities and democracy in jeopardy. Most importantly, he shows how none of this is inevitable, but rather the outcome of decisions that are in our power to change.\"\n\nStacy Mitchell, Co-Executive Director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and author of 'Big-Box Swindle'\n\n\"Austin Frerick shows just how much consolidation has devastated family farmers. But what makes Barons so good is how clearly he explains how those changes were caused by policies that benefit Wall Street and corporate America at the expense of everyone else.\"\n\nRob Larew, President of the National Farmers Union\n\n\"Well-written, maddening, and inspiring, Frerick takes us into the power networks of food, and brings the reader out the other side deeply informed about the structural problems in the food syste"
