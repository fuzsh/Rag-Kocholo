        "text": "America and the rest of the world are enduring the exercise of massive governmental power as the primary means of dealing with the China-based COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCitizens in free countries like ours have acquiesced in what is “normal” in despotic regimes under the assumption that such broad authority was necessary to prevent millions of deaths. After two months of economic, social and religious shutdowns, it is necessary and proper to evaluate their wisdom and justice.\n\nThe use of emergency powers in times of crisis has long been acknowledged as legitimate in the United States, as long as they are focused on the immediate threat, and cease when it ends. But precisely because those powers are broad, it is wise to be wary of undue resort to them.\n\nBefore turning to the specific aspects of the current situation, a few words are in order about the quotation (not “quote”) in the headline.\n\nJohn Dahlberg-Acton was a prolific writer during the Victorian era in Great Britain, whose views inspired people on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, especially American conservatives in the 20th century. Ironically, his famous maxim appeared in a letter critical of Papal infallibility. Too often, the word “tends” is omitted, suggesting wrongly that Acton objected even to limited governmental power, which he did not.\n\nIt is fair to cite the man known as Lord Acton (he was a baron) because absolute power is actually being wielded by governors and mayors across this country, leaving many of us wondering when, if ever, this phase shall pass and what condition we will be in as a result.\n\nThe justification given for executives to require citizens to self-quarantine in their homes, observe social distancing and wear masks, while permitting only “essential” goods and services, was that it was necessary in order to slow the rate of infection, illness and death (especially the last). Evidence for that result was a flattening of the statistical curve. That is well short of a complete eradication of the virus or a vaccine.\n\nBut more and more people, in government and out, have questioned the weeks- (now months-) long prolongation of the shutdown because the curve has indeed flattened in most jurisdictions.\n\nYet some governors and mayors (largely Democrats) have moved the statistical goalposts, so to speak, arguing that until a cure is found, the shutdown must continue. New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said that “if even one life is saved” the shutdown must go on.\n\nIn a previous column, I counseled charity for the mistakes made by all parties, political or otherwise, in the early stages of the pandemic. But experience is, or ought to be, a great teacher. We know, for instance, that countries like Sweden and states like South Dakota refrained from imposing draconian measures with results not significantly different from those who did.\n\nPerhaps the most startling thing about this shutdown now appears to be have been its failure to deter, much less prevent, infections. Gov. Cuomo himself cited the statistics in his state regarding where infections occurred, and it turns out that more than 60% were in homes! His eminence failed to draw the obvious conclusion.\n\nIf that weren’t enough, the Empire State’s chief executive actually ordered elderly coronavirus patients to be admitted to nursing homes, swelling the already alarming number of deaths to 4,813. In a remarkable display of arrogance, Cuomo declared that no one should be prosecuted for this calamity, least of all himself.\n\nI learned from the Powerline blog that one Neil Ferguson, the “expert” who persuaded the government of the United Kingdom early on to confine people to their homes, setting an example the rest of the world soon followed, was recently fired from his position when it was learned that he had twice entertained his married mistress at his home, hardly consistent with lock down, much less, “social distancing.”\n\nThere are other examples of official hypocrisy, such as Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot getting an illicit haircut because she is “in the public eye.” And then there is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who keeps going to the gym. CNN’s virus-infected Chris Cuomo departed from his basement broadcast “headquarters” to go outside without a mask.\n\nI know that the president and vice president have been “seen” without masks, but at least they didn’t pontificate about it. The point is, if public officials are not following the guidelines, why should we take those strictures seriously?\n\nRemember how we were told not to wear masks because they weren’t even effective, even as health care workers and others were wearing them? Let’s get real, folks, and follow the science.\n\nNext week I will examine the political aspects of the shutdown."
