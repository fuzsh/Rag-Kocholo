        "text": "Wonka is perhaps the most important movie of the Century, and quite possibly even more than that. The movie reignites a sense of wonder. It is the sense of delight we can get from something we deem non-essential, and only when we taste it, tasting how it should be made‚Äîfrom a sense of deep Calling and devotion to Craft‚Äîare we brought into undeniable relationship with the reality of how utterly essential, how utterly significant it actually is and always has been, and that we simply, somewhere along the line forgot. And in that, it dawns on us, sadly, that we have somehow been complicit in that forgetting. Watching the movie, made me realise I was in the presence of pure genius. The idea and with it the feelings that belong to that idea came rushing back and kept filling my heart in a way for which the word ‚Äòoverwhelm‚Äô had no meaning. (Overwhelm is the language of the part of us that is ill in this world.) My heart opened again, in a way it had not been for a very, very long time. The idea and the feelings that belong to that idea, was that each of us, and then collectively together all of us, can imagine our own inspiring truth that transcends the state of ugliness we keep trying to look away from in the world. We can create a world of our own, and based on our choices and how infectious we can make our ideas and our dreams, we can share them, let them catch fire, and eventually realise them. This is actualisation. See Link for the full Article.\n\nUnstoppable Grit: Hugh Glass‚Äôs Epic Comeback Listen up! Hugh Glass's survival story from 1823 is the definition of beast mode. This fur trapper got mauled by a grizzly bear in South Dakota. His crew managed to take down the bear, but thinking Glass was done for, they left him behind. They didn‚Äôt even bury him‚Äîjust took his gear and bolted. But Glass? This guy‚Äôs got heart and guts. He wakes up, sets his own broken leg, and embarks on a grueling 200-mile trek to the nearest settlement. We‚Äôre talking about braving the elements, letting maggots eat away dead flesh to prevent gangrene, and fighting off wolves for food. No revenge on his former crew‚Äîjust pure, relentless determination to survive and thrive. And if you think this story sounds epic, you‚Äôre right. Hollywood took it up a notch with the 2015 movie *The Revenant*, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass. The film brings this jaw-dropping tale of survival and resilience to life, showing the sheer willpower and toughness of Glass in all its gritty glory. When life throws a grizzly-sized challenge your way and people bail on you, channel your inner Hugh Glass. Stay fierce, keep moving forward, and show the world what true grit looks like. You‚Äôre tougher than you think‚Äînever forget that. So go get them tiger: üêØ #BeastMode #SurvivalStory #HughGlass #RawDetermination #NeverBackDown #AgainstAllOdds #UltimateGrit #KeepPushing #LegendarySurvivor #FightThroughIt #TheRevenant #LeonardoDiCaprio #Inspiration And here‚Äôs the scene where Hugh glass, blade by Leonardo DiCaprio, gets mauled by the bear üêª but survives: https://lnkd.in/ewAUtPtx\n\nüìΩ Who remembers \"The Neverending Story\"? üìΩ Did you know it's celebrating its 40th anniversary this year? Thanks to Penn Cinema for running it here locally. Up there with the \"Flight of the Navigator,\" \"E.T.,\" and \"The Goonies,\" this was one of my favorite childhood movies. So I just had to drag my family out to watch it on the big screen. Mixed reviews from my teens -- the CGI is a bit hokey by today's standard, but they definitely recognized the title track from its placement in S3 of Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" (remember Dustin serenading Suzie with the catchy tune...). The message of the movie is a timeless story of faith, hope, and perseverance. It follows Bastian, a young boy who discovers a magical book that pulls him into the world of Fantasia. There, a destructive force called \"The Nothing\" threatens to consume everything. A young warrior named Atreyu must save Fantasia, but Bastian soon realizes his own role in the story is just as crucial. üîë Takeaways: Imagination is Everything: Bastian shows us that believing in our imagination can change the world around us. Keep Going: Characters like Atreyu remind us to keep pushing forward, even when things get really tough. It‚Äôs all about staying determined and brave. The Nothing = Despair: The Nothing symbolizes spiritual darkness and how the distractions and despair of the modern world can creep in and take over. But creativity and hope can fight back against the darkness and emptiness. Faith and Stories Matter: Bastian‚Äôs journey through the book highlights the power of faith and stories to inspire and uplift us. Sometimes a good story is what we need to aim us toward hope. Finding Yourself: Bastian‚Äôs adventure is about discovering his own strengths. Knowing ourselves better can lead to greater confidence and optimism. Lean on Faith and Others: The relationships in the movie, like Atreyu and his horse Artax, show how important it is to have faith and support. Connections with faith and others can be a huge source of strength. Good stuff from an old '80's movie... and it's far from \"neverending\" at a quick 90 minutes from title to credits. https://lnkd.in/eQsKtcHg\n\nWhat have Georgia O'Keefe, Virginia Wolf, Richard Feynman, Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, Mr. Bean and YOU in common? In her stunning autobiographical reflection 'Moments of being', Virginia Woolf beheld the cosmos of connections in a single flower üåºin a similar way like Siddhartha Gautama and MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa saw a flower and smiled. The Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman offered a different, complementary lens on the art of seeing through his now-famous monologue known as ‚ÄúOde to a Flower.‚Äù Before Feynman, before Woolf, another titan of the creative spirit found a powerful metaphor for how we experience the world ‚Äî how we see it, and how we don‚Äôt ‚Äî also in a flower. Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe wrote as she contemplated the art of seeing ‚ÄúTo see takes time, like to have a friend takes time‚Äù ...and also in love with a rose, the Little Prince from Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry sighed his timeless sigh: ‚ÄúWhat is essential is invisible to the eye.‚Äù Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, whose book 'I am That' brought him worldwide recognition and followers, especially in North America and Europe, said: \"The ultimate point of view is that there is nothing to understand, so when we try to understand, we are only indulging in acrobatics of the mind. Whatever you have understood, you are not. Why are you getting lost in concepts? You are not what you know, you are the knower\" Finally Mr Bean, in his emotive and deeply insightful speech in the video says that \"My job is to sit and look\". I confess I am more like Mr Bean, and hope that my boss does not read this after making so evident that I sit and look at my job. So, what do all have in common? In fact, what have all of us humans in common? Different ways of seeing the world That's what we all are Nothing more And nothing less That's all we have in common. Different views to see the world. Approximately 8 billion different perspectives. And how many planets Earth are there? One. What if next time we think we are right, we simply.... ....see what we are... ...and from where do we see things... https://lnkd.in/eBt_w3Bk\n\nAfter 1095 days, I rewatched the movies Super Deluxe & Vikram Vedha. I noticed a clear difference in my angle of perspective now. The motive for writing this post is to deliver my view on these films as they hold a great message about life, society, and people. In my opinion, I wish to share some points that these two films share in common. ‚ü´ Which is right? Which is wrong? This is a highly debatable topic in terms of life, society, and people. But from the perception of these two films, The situation decides everything. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Killing someone is a crime. But killing someone in a war becomes self-defence. 2Ô∏è‚É£ According to society, A policeman is the right person. A criminal is the wrong person. But there is a chance that both may commit crimes in future due to circumstances. ‚ü´ The world is like a \"Chain\" Everything that happens around us may have positive or negative effects on us. 1Ô∏è‚É£ If snow melts in the Arctic‚õìÔ∏èit raises the sea level‚õìÔ∏ècreates disasters that destroy us. 2Ô∏è‚É£ If a bird spits the seed of a fruit somewhere‚õìÔ∏èit blooms into a plant or tree‚õìÔ∏èproduces rain‚õìÔ∏èbenefits the people living there. So, these two points were crushing my mind and I feel blissful after sharing this with you. Comment \"AGREE\" if you accept my above perception. Or write your unique perception of these films in simple words. #society #right #wrong #circumstances"
