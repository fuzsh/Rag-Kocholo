        "text": "Our Investigation\n\nHere are the products of our investigation into Joe Biden’s Vice Presidential records that helped lead to the impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives. Our litigation against the Biden Administration uncovered thousands of emails between the White House and Rosemont Seneca. Contrary to Joe Biden’s claim that there is an “absolute wall between the personal and private, and the government,” the White House asserted executive privilege to withhold over 300 of the emails with “Seneca Global Advisors” and “Rosemont Seneca” in their entirety because “Release would disclose confidential advice between the President and his advisors, or between such advisors.” But, we uncovered over 20,000 emails between the Office of the Vice President and Seneca Global Advisors or Rosemont Seneca.\n\nAs of now, NARA has processed 1,340 emails sent to or received by the Office of the Vice President between April 2009 and February 2014 that contained the names of Hunter Biden’s companies — “Seneca Global Advisors” and “Rosemont Seneca.” In these documents, we discovered that even though Hunter had no official role in the Obama-Biden Administration, he was intimately involved in planning for high-profile White House events. We also uncovered a cozy relationship between VP Biden’s office, Rosemont Seneca, and the press. We confirmed that Joe Biden used his personal email for official White House business."
