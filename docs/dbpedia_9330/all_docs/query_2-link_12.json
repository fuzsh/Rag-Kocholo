        "text": "“Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority; still more when you superadd the tendency of the certainty of corruption by authority.”\n\n“Despotic power is always accompanied by corruption of morality.”\n\n“Authority that does not exist for Liberty is not authority but force.”\n\n“Everybody likes to get as much power as circumstances allow, and nobody will vote for a self-denying ordinance.”\n\n“Absolute power demoralizes.”\n\n“Liberty becomes a question of morals more than of politics.”\n\n“Liberty is the harmony between the will and the law.”\n\n“Property, not conscience, is the basis of liberty. For the defence of conscience need not arise. Property is always exposed to interference. It is the constant object of policy.”\n\n“Liberty has not only enemies which it conquers, but perfidious friends, who rob the fruits of its victories: Absolute democracy, socialism.”\n\nAll liberty is conditional, limited and therefore unequal. The state can never do what it likes in its own sphere. It is bound by all kinds of law.”\n\n“Liberty consists in the division of power. Absolutism, in concentration of power.”\n\n“By liberty I mean the assurance that every man shall be protected in doing what he believes is his duty against the influence of authority and majorities, custom and opinion.”\n\n“Towns were the nursery of freedom.”\n\n“Conscription is not tolerated by a people that understands and loves freedom.”\n\n“Political atheism: End justifies the means. This is still the most widespread of all the opinions inimical to liberty.”\n\n“Free trade, to improve the condition of the people and fit them for freedom.”\n\n“The will of the people cannot make just that which is unjust.”\n\n“Moral precepts are constant through the ages and not obedient to circumstances.”\n\n“The notion of sin and repentance waned with the belief in authority. Men thought they could make good the evil they did.”\n\n“A public man has no right to let his actions be determined by particular interests. He does the same thing as a judge who accepts a bribe. Like a judge he must consider what is right, not what is advantageous to a party or class.”\n\n“There is another world for the expiation of guilt; but the wages of folly are payable here below.”\n\n“A convinced man differs from a prejudiced man as an honest man from a liar.”\n\n“Political economy cannot be supreme arbiter in politics. Else you might defend slavery where it is economically sound and reject it where the economic argument applies against it.”\n\n“Self-preservation and self-denial, the basis of all political economy.”\n\n“Politics = the ethics of public life.”\n\n“Example is of the first importance in politics, because political calculations are so complex that we cannot trust theory, if we cannot support it by experience.”\n\n“Divided, or rather multiplied, authorities are the foundation of good government.”\n\n“Bureaucracy is undoubtedly the weapon and sign of a despotic government, inasmuch as it gives whatever government it serves, despotic power.”\n\n“Bureaucracy tries to establish so many administrative maxims that the minister is as narrowly controlled and guided as the judge.”\n\n“Limitation is essential to authority. A government is legitimate only if it is effectively limited.”\n\n“Government rules the present. Literature rules the future.”\n\n“The danger is not that a particular class is unfit to govern. Every class is unfit to govern.”\n\n“It is easier to find people fit to govern themselves than people fit to govern others.”\n\n“In England Parliament is above the law. In America the law is above Congress.”\n\n“The Americans, having broken the thread in 1776, spliced it together again. They became eminently conservative in 1787.”\n\n“The great novelty of the American Constitution was that it imposed checks on the representatives of the people.”\n\n“What the French took from the Americans was their theory of revolution, not their theory of government — their cutting, not their sewing.”\n\n“There could never be a revolution less provoked by oppression than America. Thenceforth the right of a nation to judge for itself could not be denied.”\n\n“Americans dreaded democracy and contrived their constitution against it.”\n\n“[On France:] The country that had been so proud of its kings, of its nobles, and of its chains, could not learn without teaching that popular power may be tainted with the same poison as personal power.”\n\n“Inequality: the Basis of society. We combined and put things in common to protect the weak against the strong.”\n\n“A liberal is only a bundle of prejudices until he has mastered, has understood, experienced the philosophy of Conservatism.”\n\n“It is bad to be oppressed by a minority, but it is worse to be oppressed by a majority.”\n\n“There should be a law to the People besides its own will.”\n\n“All partisanship depends on concealment. Mere strong language and special pleading take in nobody.”\n\n“Official truth is not actual truth.”\n\n“Every doctrine to become popular, must be made superficial, exaggerated, untrue. We must always distinguish the real essence from the conveyance, especially in political economy.”\n\n“There is not a more perilous or immoral habit of mind than the sanctifying of success.”"
