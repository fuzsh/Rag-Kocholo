        "text": "Not to be confused with the song \"Our Hometown\"\n\n\"Hometown\" is the twelfth Story chapter of Goddess of Victory: Nikke.\n\nAfter separating from Absolute and Counters squad during their joint operation to obtain the Heretic fragment, the protagonist, Rapi, and Matis become trapped in an underground base. Unbeknownst to them, this base is home to a malicious entity.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nBad news: The protagonist is stuck inside an underground Rapture base with Rapi and Matis due to a trap.\n\nWorse news: The facility seems tailor-made as a labyrinthine deathtrap.\n\nGood news: Matis can find the way through the facility.\n\nBad news: There's a very distinct reason why they can navigate the facility...\n\nThe Meaning of the Strongest[]\n\nFollowing their sudden skydive, Rapi, the protagonist, and Matis are securing their surroundings while simultaneously balking at the sheer scale of the underground base. Shifty morosely reports that the jamming signal is so strong that she can't get anything from scans, be it topography or Rapture detection. Even communications could go down without warning.\n\nMaxwell deduces that the jamming needs to be cleared up before they can do anything, which unfortunately traps them in a catch-22. They need to destroy the jammers to clear up their scanners, but without their scanners, they can't locate the jammers. Maxwell seems confident that Drake can handle that, but the self-proclaimed villain refuses unless the others beg on their knees for her aid. Eventually Drake settles for Maxwell buying her some Nutrium, and begins to focus...\n\nShifty and co. are surprised to hear that Drake's body has the ability to sense radio waves, allowing her to mostly replace an operator. She may only be about 70% as effective as dedicated equipment, but it's still impressive for an ability built-in to a Nikke's body without any extraneous parts.\n\nRapi notes that Drake's ability likely allows Matis to operate as widely and independently as they do, to which Laplace declares that her squad can do it all as long as they have electrical power. With Maxwell's tech and repair know-how, Drake's sensors, and Laplace's undisputed might, none may contest Matis' claim as \"the strongest,\" or so she boasts. Though her bluster deflates when Rapi makes a few musings. In the face of an enemy as mercurial as the Raptures, what constitutes \"the strongest\" may change between situations...\n\nSoon enough, Drake gets a heading, and the group is on their way...\n\nRendezvous in The Dark: A[]\n\nSoon enough, a jammer is located, predictably surrounded by Raptures. Maxwell immediately declares their intent to destroy it, to which Shifty has no major objections. Even now, their radio line to the Ark is breaking up with their proximity to the jammer...\n\nRendezvous in The Dark: B[]\n\nWith the jammer destroyed, communications are fully restored. Shifty initiates a scan of the area...and detects high energy signals...right in Matis' blindspot!\n\nThe clicking of guns thankfully accompanies the presence of Counters and Absolute, who while relieved to see the protagonist safe are still...displeased...with Matis' stunt at the bridge.\n\nWith the whole gang back together, Shifty starts setting up guidance towards the Heretic Fragment. Along the way, Absolute asks for any occurrences on Matis' end, paying special attention when Rapi reports that everyone was struck by tentacles for some reason...\n\nA Bad Feeling[]\n\nRapi asks Shifty for an ETA update, which according to the coordinates is another hour to the destination. Unfortunately it doesn't seem that way to Rapi. Eunhwa and Rapi agree to keep their conclusions until they have definitive proof, though the Absolute leader has to rein in her temper again as Anis starts needling at her, much to Vesti's awe...\n\nStanding Still[]\n\nAfter some more walking, Eunhwa orders a full stop and tells everyone to take a good look around. One of the walls has the same marking they'd left before to denote their passage, meaning they've gone full circle back to start. Based on how Shifty reads a change in coordinates despite this seeming lack of progress, that can only mean one thing; the base is actively shifting its interior to stall their advance. Between this and the tentacles, it's clear that this place is 100% Rapture territory, and they're not above dirty tricks when it comes to dealing with intruders. Rapi posits that this facility is intended as a trap for Nikkes without an operator, to induce panic and make them prone to mistakes.\n\nDespite the looming risk of being trapped forever in this base, Anis seems to be the only one concerned. Laplace and Vesti are confident that even if this entire base is a Rapture, they just have to kill it to get out. Rapi remains silent amidst the conversation...\n\nIn the Belly of the Beast[]\n\nShifty reports to the group that now the reverse of their situation is happening. The walls around them are shifting, but according to the coordinates, they haven't moved a single step from their previous position. The layout seems to change every time Shifty does a scan, and figuring out the pattern requires time they may not have. Maxwell asks if the Heretic Fragment is in the same location, which according to Shifty, it is. Maxwell suggests they keep going towards the Fragment, despite Rapi's advice to pull back and wait for Shifty to establish a pattern. Sadly neither Absolute nor Matis seem intent on giving up their record of no failed missions thus far, even if it means taking greater risk.\n\nWith that plan set, Laplace points out to a writhing passageway, which her \"hero instincts\" are telling her is the correct path. All of Matis seems to agree on it, so Eunhwa has them lead the way in case she needs to shoot them since they seem so confident...\n\nOminous Certainty[]\n\nDespite skepticism on Anis' part, Shifty reports that Matis' guidance is effective in navigating the labyrinth towards the Heretic fragment. Along the way, Rapi seems to communicate with gestures to Emma and Eunhwa. Anis and Neon look confused, but after a moment, they too understand the \"conversation\" and Anis curses aloud. Whatever the content of their discussion, it seems to be something they have no intention of explaining to the protagonist...\n\nHer Will: A[]\n\nWith the destination finally reached, Rapi and Eunhwa...open fire on Matis?! The protagonist demands an explanation, and gets an answer he probably wishes he didn't; corruption. One look at Matis and it's easy to see. Each and every one of them sports red eyes and keeps beckoning them nonstop, almost like that time...\n\nThe protagonist asks how Matis managed to get corrupted, to which Emma posits the tentacles from earlier were a medium for infection. As for how Rapi seems to be unafflicted, she believes the tentacle hit too shallowly to induce the corruption, with Absolute confirming they did not see the same signs in Rapi...\n\nEmma explains she is...quite familiar with certain facial tics associated with corruption symptoms. Neon expresses guilt over hiding this from the protagonist, but Rapi rationalizes that telling him would led to his interference, since he would've assumed that he'd be forced to execute a corrupted Nikke again. The man in question can offer no rebuttal as Rapi continues. His empathy towards Nikkes is a virtue, she will not besmirch him for that. But here would be the wrong time to exercise that, in the middle of enemy territory with three of their strongest combatants gone rogue...\n\nUnwilling to discuss Having greater concerns than his holding of the idiot ball, the protagonist addresses the situation with Matis, who as far as he knows just got riddled with bullets second prior. Eunhwa and Rapi explain they used nonlethal suppression rounds to incapacitate Matis. The latter explains that typically, a corrupted Nikke is either executed in the field or scrapped on return. However, there is precedent that if a Nikke is given a memory wipe within 3 hours of exposure, they can be restored like nothing ever happened...\n\nThe protagonist reasons out that Matis knew the path through the base because they were corrupted, and the Raptures let them lead the others in here. Rapi agrees with that conclusion, commenting that this is exactly like what happened with Marian...\n\nEunhwa asks Shifty to scan the area and see just what Matis was leading them to. As far as the instruments say, there's just the Heretic Fragment, not a single blip on the radar to indicate a Rapture. The operator asks the protagonist to use the Combilink to try and manipulate some of the machinery, only to freeze and warn everyone of a Tyrant-class signal. Going by the feelings above, below, and around...the signal is propagating from all over. The entire room is a Rapture.\n\nThe room shudders and screeches as tentacles pop up from the ground. Rapi warns of the corruption risk of the tentacles as combat ensues...\n\nHer Will: B[]\n\nWith the Tyrant's signal gone, everyone breathes a sigh of relief. All Raptures in the vicinity have either been destroyed or fled. They're free to take the Heretic Fragment. Before they actually do so, the protagonist declares his intent to contact Andersen and Ingrid. With the risk of corruption present throughout the facility and Matis compromised, he deems the situation too dangerous to just do it on their own...\n\nAs Rapi moves to retrieve Matis, Shifty reports that Andersen and Ingrid have sent out airships and troops to secure the area and the Fragment, as well as extract Counters and Absolute. The ETA for both is one hour. While Shifty scans the area more thoroughly to ensure safety, Neon's attention is drawn to a series of boxes. The self-proclaimed spy moves to open one as Shifty reports no hazards for the box, only for the operator to warn against opening it, though sadly it comes too late...\n\nEveryone is appalled to see the box contains a mishmash of Nikke corpses, all crumpled up like stuffing sardines in a can. The protagonist bolts for the lid and closes the box, warning the others against opening any more boxes and trying to reassure Neon...\n\n40 minutes later, Shifty reports the imminent arrival of their reinforcements. Sadly, the good news is broken by a squeaking noise, which everyone follows to see...a corrupted Laplace, having shaken off the suppression rounds and reactivated. Rapi readies more suppression rounds, but before she can fire, Laplace starts screaming...\n\nA light and a gust of wind knocks everyone over. Shifty reports Laplace has activated a plasma field, which will vaporize anything and anyone that gets too close. The corrupted hero starts babbling about justice as she pulls out her cannon and points the barrel to the sky. A moment of horror strikes as everyone realizes Laplace is aiming for the transports, only for her to...suddenly start screaming again, and throw her gun away?\n\nIt seems Laplace is fighting to assert her will against the corruption, proclaiming that imperiling others is the antithesis of a hero. She struggles with her coat for a moment before pulling out a pistol, and with some effort, brings it under her chin. The Matis leader makes clear her intent to terminate herself before she jeopardizes the mission any further. She apologizes for the trouble and bids Eunhwa to take over from here. Just as she's about to pull the trigger, a voice calmly rings out with a command; \"Stop.\"\n\nEvery single Nikke suddenly freezes in place as Shifty declares the arrival of Extrinsic squad, Elysion's counter-Nikke black-ops unit. The leader Maiden confirms that all Nikkes have ceased movement from her kotodama, and orders Guillotine to disable Laplace's cannon. With a flip of her eyepatch and some chuuni monologue, the cannon's barrel flickers and sputters out...\n\nGuillotine chuunis like mad monologues some more about the power of her eye, only to be cut short by Maiden ordering their withdrawal. Said monologue is mixed with a warning to the protagonist, advising him not to disclose of their existence in any official capacity. Maiden orders all Nikkes to reactivate, and though slightly disoriented, Rapi and Absolute waste no time resuppressing Laplace.\n\nAs Shifty gives the all-clear, Rapi asks the protagonist about what they just experienced. Remembering the earlier warning, the protagonist wisely remarks that he didn't see anything, to which Rapi voices her understanding as they prepare to return...\n\nIncorruptible[]\n\nSafely back at the Ark, the protagonist meets with Andersen and Ingrid for the post-operation debriefing. The Heretic Fragment has been secured using a 12-layered Atlas Case, and analysis is currently in progress.\n\nAs for Matis, they've been put into stasis to stall their corruption. In a fit of bratty nonsense vehement opposition, Syuen has denied any attempts to wipe Matis' memories, even if it'd allow them to immediately be redeployed. Rapi reports that she is still fine despite being hit by the same tentacles, to which Ingrid asks the protagonist if he knows how memory wipes work. He recalls the explanation he received about NIMPH,[1] which simplifies this for Ingrid.\n\nLong story short, Rapture corruption hijacks NIMPH's processes and forces it to fire off signals in the brain. This allows the Raptures to manipulate Nikkes. So for Rapi to be unaffected by corruption can only mean one thing; her brain has no NIMPH. This also means the memory wipe Rapi was previously subject to had no effect on her. Ingrid wanted to see if Rapi's brain was truly without NIMPH, though she assured Anis that this could be done via a simple scan. She would not need to extract Rapi's brain. The real question would be how and when Rapi was introduced to Vapaus, which would neutralize her NIMPH. Sadly, Rapi has no information regarding that.\n\nWith that, the conversation turns towards investigating Vapaus. Unfortunately, Ingrid reports that the Central Government databases contain no information beyond Vapaus' effects of destroying nanomachines. Fortunately, between the bullet they still possess, and Rapi's presence as proof of its effects, she believes they can eventually narrow down what Vapaus is made of and how to synthesize it.\n\nThe conversation changes again to the underground facility where the Heretic Fragment was retrieved. While full details will have to wait until the Fragment is analyzed, there's no denying it; each and every box down there was stuffed to the brim with Nikkes. Further details are pending investigation, so for the time being, Counters is dismissed to rest up at the Outpost. Ingrid volunteers to accompany them back as...an escort...\n\nEnvy[]\n\nOnce the five return to the Outpost, they are annoyed surprised to find Syuen and the Wardress squad waiting for them. Ingrid was in no mood to see her fellow CEO here and while Mihara wanted to use her abilities, Yuni reminded her to wait... in case she gets grumpier. Though the Mihara that Yuni once knew has yet to remerge, she's slowly rebuilding her bit by bit. The two squads intermingle again, though Mihara doesn't remember who the Counters are. Only after Yuni reminds her does she know how to respond. With everyone reacquainted, Syuen wants to start this meeting.\n\nSyuen gets straight to the point; she wants the Vapaus and will pay the commander any amount to get it. Ingrid was shocked that she had learned about it, but as a fellow CEO, there was little chance she and Andersen could keep it a secret for long. She again insists on buying the bullet off of him and he deduces that she intends to use it on Matis. In theory, by terminating the NIMPH, they can be cured of corruption. Anis snaps at her hypocrisy of favoring them while treating the other Nikkes created by her company as disposable. She didn't do anything to prevent Mihara's memory wipe, but now she's willing to do anything to restore Matis. To Syuen, they are special, but they don't need to know why. She asks again to buy the Vapaus, but the protagonist declines her offer.\n\nShe is willing to take it as a gift, but her insistence is getting on Ingrid's nerves. From her standpoint, the mission almost ended in failure because of Matis. From destroying the bridge, to being corrupted, to putting both the Counters and Absolute in danger, along with the operational costs incurred by their actions. Because they got corrupted, she had to unveil her \"ace-in-the-hole\". She blames Syuen for every misfortune that happened and is irate because she would still had the gall come here expecting to leave with the Vapaus. If they aren't going to agree to her offer, she insists that... they let her borrow Rapi?\n\nSeeing as Rapi is here now and was also infected with the same corruption Matis was, Syuen knew the memory wipe didn't work on her because she was exposed to Vapaus herself, a revelation that comes as a shock to both her... and Yuni. Ingrid was now furious that she was willing to share confidential information so brazenly, but Syuen was willing to experiment on Rapi just to learn more about Vapaus, a request that the commander again rejects. Now it's Syuens turn to get angry due to both his repeated refusal of her \"generosity\" and her desperate need to save Matis. Even though he wishes for them to recover just as much as she does, there's no way he's sacrificing Rapi to do it.\n\nOut of options, Syuen orders Mihara to exchange her senses with the protagonist and to... commit suicide! Before she could smash her head to pieces, Ingrid intervenes, even more disgusted that she would even consider such a thing. This entire time, Ingrid has been trying to help Syuen, but she was too selfish to see it. To calm things down, the commander promises to find a way to cure Matis. Though she's not exactly assured with just his word alone, she's willing to take it if there's no other alternative. If he somehow pulls through for her, she will forever be in his debt. If he can't, then his life is forfeit...\n\nSyuen leaves in a huff and Ingrid was glad she joined them. Anis didn't understand why the brat shows genuine concern for Matis over the other Nikkes she created. Wardress lags behind, with Yuni having some things to say to Rapi. She grabs onto her wrist. Needless to say, she was less than thrilled to learn that her memories are intact while Mihara's were erased. As the sadist's grip begins to tighten, her frustration grows and grows, until cracking noises can be heard from Rapi's hand. From her perspective, Yuni thinks Rapi is happy that she can remember everything while her friend can't. While the Counters have the same relationship as always, the masochist views Yuni as a stranger. Rapi got to live while the Mihara she knew is dead. After snapping Rapi's wrist, Yuni takes her leave. Mihara follows her lead.\n\nEveryone in the room understands Yuni's feelings and it's not only Rapi's wrist that's in pain right now.\n\nMaterial H[]\n\nIngrid and the Counters go to M.M.R. to see Mana, one of the scientists of the squad of the same name. The lab looks like a mess and she shares that an accident had occurred recently. As for why she called them over, she begins her report by stating the Heretic Fragment shall be referred to \"Material H\" from now on, a name choice that Anis sort of understands. Upon confirming that it is composed of nanomachines, they studied its response to electrical stimulus. Upon shocking it, a tentacle-shaped appendage extended and... attacked all 18 Nikkes in the vicinity. There were no survivors and they were all \"absorbed\". It turns out it will only consume Nikkes, meaning humans and other machines will be left unharmed. With the Nikkes in its system, its weight increased by 378 grams, a surprisingly light amount. It is believed that they were disintegrated and only \"necessary substances'’ are absorbed. Material H is now being stored in an Atlas case for everyone's safety.\n\nAs of now, Material H weighs approximately 12kg and has absorbed 450 Nikkes. It becomes apparent to Neon what was stored in the boxes in the underground facility, but Mana has a full explanation for that as well. In essence, the facility functions similar to an ant colony. The portion they had visited was a small part of a grand design, with numerous similar rooms scattered about. Though she doesn't know how large it actually is, she estimates it's roughly 1300 square kilometers. All other chambers connect to the one Material H was found in. Many other fluctuating routes are used to disorient and corrupt unwary Nikkes. If they die close to the substance, they become food for it. If they are too far away, they are placed in one of many \"storage\" rooms spread across the colony. By bringing unsuspecting Nikkes to the facility, they can fuel Material H, and therefore, make it larger. Should it continue to grow, the Heretic that created it will be resurrected.\n\nIngrid compares the facility to more of a breeding colony. Mana continues by informing them that around 200 Nikkes were being \"stored\" in boxes. They most likely ended up there after getting lost while on patrol or on a mission and that explains why so many of them disappear in the area. This also explains Ludmilla's worries about not being able to find lost Nikkes. When it comes to the amount of Raptures in the facility, there aren't nearly as many, comparatively speaking. However... due to Modernia joining the war, most have retreated. Mana concludes her report, but has one last casual observation to mention. For all intents and purposes, the underground facility is... structured similarly to the Ark? It's to the point where it is essentially a miniature version of it...\n\nIngrid praises Mana for a job well done.\n\nOperation: Destroy the Heretics[]\n\nWith the new information about the underground facility and Material H, Andersen assembles the CEOs of the Big Three and the commander so they can plan out their next move. Ingrid, Syuen, and Mustang are also in attendance. A major battle is brewing and a potential opportunity is presenting itself. Their objectives are twofold.\n\nDestroy the underground facility.\n\nApprehend the Heretic Modernia if possible. If not, then they must eliminate her.\n\nShould they succeed in this mission, humanity will be one step closer to reclaiming the surface. As for how Andersen intends on pulling off phase 1, he explains that explosives will be planted on the facility's walls and they will be detonated, collapsing the colony in the process. Given it is filled with narrow passageways and Raptures galore, only their best squads will be sent into the fray. Ingrid is willing to send Absolute and Mustang offers up Cafe Sweety, Tetra's problem-solving squad. With Matis out of commission, Syuen has no one to represent Missilis Industry, which Andersen understands.\n\nOnce the facility is nothing but rubble, Modernia should head to the surface. She will be accompanied by numerous Raptures in tow, most worrisome of which is Chatterbox. Phase 2 consists of eliminating every single Rapture in the area, creating a clear path to the Heretic. If they can complete those two phases, the final part of the plan can commence. Their main objective is to capture Modernia alive, a notion that surprises Syuen. He intends on having the Counters make direct contact with her. It will be up to the protagonist to do everything in his power to bring Marian back. This is a rare opportunity that they are giving him and this serves as compensation for having discovered the facility in the first place. If there is no way to reason with her, shooting her with the Vapaus becomes top priority, something that has the potential to kill her...\n\nThere's no way of knowing what will happen to Modernia after the Vapaus enters her system, but since she is made of nanomachines, there may or may not be some kind of effect on her, perhaps even a miracle. No matter what happens, Andersen hopes things work out in the end, and the protagonist agrees. The operation begins at 05:00 tomorrow and he tells the commander to get some rest. The day of, he will go into further detail.\n\nEnd It[]\n\nThat night, the protagonist was exhausted and was about to head to bed. The biggest battle of his life is less than a day away, so he wants to be in top form. As he lays down, a surprise visitor enters his room...\n\nSnow White has stopped by to alert him that she intends on joining the fight as well. Though she plans on helping them, she has one non-negotiable prerequisite; Chatterbox is hers to eliminate, something he can live with. She tells him to get some rest before disappearing.\n\nHe stares into the distance for a brief moment before nodding off.\n\nCharacter appearances[]"
