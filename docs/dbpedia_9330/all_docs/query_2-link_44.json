This volume focuses on literary texts that have dealt most memorably with this theme to help readers better understand different views and treatments of this concept. These important works are crafted to be effective as literature, not mere statements. The essays in this title will seek to define how definitions of power and corruption have changed throughout history, the criteria by which some uses of power are judged corrupt, and whether or not these criteria can be considered objective or universal. Critical Insights: Power & Corruption will also delve into how human differences (gender, race, and class) affect definitions and perceptions of power and corruption."
