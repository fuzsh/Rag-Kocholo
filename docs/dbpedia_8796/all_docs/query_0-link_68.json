Paul Freedman initially suggested the topic, helped me get situated with my archival research in ­Catalonia by drawing on his extensive network of colleagues, and assisted me in countless invaluable other ways throughout the project’s long development. I would like to recognize Teo Ruiz for being such a warm and caring mentor, friend, and role model for life. Carlos Eire and Adam Kosto were also ­instrumental—and Carlos has continued to support me with boundless encouragement ever since. I remain deeply grateful to my ­undergraduate professors at Princeton University. Numerous other colleagues have ­provided camaraderie, assurance, and assistance over the years, including Ibrahim Al-Marashi, Michelle Armstrong-Partida, Pere Benito, Jeff Bowman, Karen Burgess (CMRS), Nancy Caciola, Brian Catlos, Albert Curto, Andrew Devereux, Rowan Dorin, Daniel Duran i Duelt, John Eldevik, Gemma Escrivà, ­Hussein Fancy, Benjy Gampel, Rodrigo García-Velasco, Pat Geary, Claire Gilbert, Piotr Górecki, Matthew Herbst, Michelle Herder, Maya Soifer Irish, Bill ­Jordan, Marie Kelleher, Arash Khazeni, Mat Kuefler, Kristina Markman, Susan McDonough, Sara McDougall, Ted Melillo, Mark Meyerson, Maureen Miller, Greg Milton, David Nirenberg, Natalie Oeltjen, Laurea Pagarolas, Stéphane Péquignot, Gwen Rice, Erin Rowe, Mike Ryan, Flocel Sabaté, Alyssa Sepinwall, Dan Smail, George Trumbull IV, Lucas Villegas-Aristizábal, Ed Watts, Scott Wells, Ken Wolf, Matt Wranovix, and Antonio Zaldivar. I also acknowledge friends in Catalonia, including Marta Herreras, Xavier Sanahuja and Helena Garrigós, Teresa Julià, and Edgar Vergara. The California Medieval Seminar, Spain-North Africa Project, Mediterranean Seminar, and UCLA’s CMRS served as vital venues for learning from other experts and for testing out many of the ideas presented in the following pages. I also recognize the helpful archivists and staff members of the ACA, ACL, ACT, ACTE, ADM at Poblet, AHN, AML, Arxiu Nacional de Catalunya, and Biblioteca de Catalunya. Thanks are due to my wonderful History (and non-History) colleagues at the University of San Diego as well as to my supportive deans, Noelle ix\n\nx A C K N O W L E D G M E N TS\n\nNorton, Kristin Moran, and Ron Kaufmann. I’m especially grateful to Colin Fisher for assisting me as department chair with numerous reviews, grant and fellowship applications, and other responsibilities. Damian Smith has been a source of encouragement and support and provided vital constructive feedback on the manuscript. I have also benefited from kind and supportive correspondence with Larry McCrank, whose important scholarship on many of the topics addressed in this book has been an invaluable resource to me. I am grateful to my editor at Cornell University Press, Mahinder Kingra, for taking a chance on this manuscript and offering insightful suggestions on how to improve it, to Bethany Wasik, Carmen Torrado Gonzalez, and Karen Laun for assistance with the manuscript preparation and marketing, Deborah Oosterhouse for wonderful copyediting, and Kate Mertes for help with the preparation of the index. Numerous grants and fellowships provided vital financial support, which I acknowledge with gratitude: the Andrew Mellon Graduate Fellowship, the Yale Graduate Fellowship, a Fulbright Fellowship, an Allan Sheldon III Memorial fellowship (Yale), a Heckman Research Scholarship (Hill Museum and Manuscript Library), a Grant-in-Aid fellowship (Oberlin College), an ACLS Fellowship, and numerous International Opportunities grants and Faculty Research grants from the University of San Diego. Publication costs were offset by a generous grant from the College of Arts and Sciences of the ­University of San Diego. Chris Woolgar and the Journal of Medieval H ­ istory graciously allowed me to use some of the research already presented in “Lords, Settlers, and Shifting Frontiers in Medieval Catalonia,” vol. 36 (2010): 204–52, in chapters 5 and 7. For friendship over the years, I would also like to recognize Audrey and Kevin Barrett, Ed Batts and Robyn Hudgens, Beth Brett, Jordan Cohen and Sheila Gujrathi, Juliana and Scott Draper, Scarlett Freund, Shilpi and Anand Gowda, Henri Dolset and Patrick Leroy, Chris Kelley, Daniel Mason and Sara Houghteling, Rich and Koki Reasons, Jeff and Heather Slosar, Yi Sun and Gary Boggs, John and Tammy Unikewicz, Ben and Julie Waltzer, and Manasi Watts. I owe a huge debt to my parents and step-parents, who inspired me to enter academia and have supported me throughout the long journey. I’d especially like to acknowledge my father, Doug ­Barton, who ­encouraged me to study history at Princeton and was a powerful, ever-positive role model throughout my life. I’d also like to thank my extended family, Greg, Julie, Rachel and Lucy Barton, Jamie and Laura Barton, Betty Barton, Joe ­ ardlow, and Kristl and David and Candee Lee, JJ Lee, Denise Tu and Bryan W Tu. My wife, Whitney, deserves recognition for picking up the slack during\n\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S xi\n\nall of my research trips and long absences over the years. I lovingly dedicate this book to her. Thank you for always and unconditionally supporting my strange passion for premodern history. My three daughters, Mele, Koa, and Nanea, are my other great source of joy. I look forward to learning someday what they think of this mysterious book that took up so much of my time and attention as they were growing up.\n\nq Aanbbrevi ati ons , Nami ng, d Co i n age\n\nGenerally, only the most reliable version is cited in the case of duplicate archival sources or multiple editions. In addition to the acronyms specified in the bibliography, the following abbreviations are used throughout the notes: Arm. (Armario), c. (carpeta, calaix, c­ apítol), chap. (chapter), doc. (document/o), C (Cancillería Real), fol(s). (folio), leg. (legajo), no(s). (número), n (note), perg(s). (pergamí/­pergamino), Reg. (Registre/o). The names of individuals that appear in the chapters that follow generally reflect the linguistic cultures of their home regions, whenever distinguishable. For example, a Latin document referring to a certain “Jacobus” clearly deriving from the town of Salou, in Catalonia, would appear as Jaume, whereas a “Jacobus” from Zaragoza or Toledo would be named Jaime. Similarly, due to their dynasty’s long-standing identification with Catalonia, the count-kings of Barcelona and Aragon have Catalonian naming (Alfons, Pere, Jaume, etc.). Catalano-Aragonese monarchs following the merger with Aragon are numbered according to Catalonian tradition: for example, Alfons I “El Cast” (r. 1154–96) and Pere I “El Catòlic” (r. 1196–1213). Generally, the names of individuals appear as spelled by scribes without diacritical marks. However, well-known Jewish or Muslim historical figures, such as Muh· ammad ibn Abı¯ ʿA¯mir (al-Mans·ur) or ibn H·azm, appear in their standard printed forms. Place-names that are commonly anglicized will appear as such throughout the text: for example, Catalonia and Aragon, not Catalunya and Aragón. Lesser known place-names will appear in their native forms: for example, Lleida and Zaragoza. Terminology such as aljama, lleuda, pedatge, and prohoms will be defined or explained when first employed. Since there are relatively few of these terms, this book does not utilize a glossary. Although this study does refer to various distinct types of coinage and seeks to show how coinage could serve as a political tool, a detailed understanding of the Iberian Peninsula’s complicated history of coinage is not necessary to follow its argumentation. It will suffice to appreciate that a number of roughly equivalent silver solidus coins circulated throughout the realms of the Crown of Aragon. As was the case with all currencies, the purchasing xiii\n\nxiv A B B R E V I AT I O N S ,\n\nN A M I N G , A N D CO I N A G E\n\npower of these solidi varied from year to year, but each, nevertheless, was subject to the traditional Carolingian ratio of one pound to twenty solidi to twelve denarii. Similarly, although the morabetin coins mentioned throughout this book fluctuated in value, each was worth about nine Catalonian solidi, and three morabetins were roughly equal to five masmudines.1\n\nGibraltar Ceuta\n\nNavas de Tolosa Granada\n\nAlarcos\n\nToledo\n\ns alu d n\n\n-A AlSeville\n\nNUncastillo Jaca\n\nre arPamplona v a\n\nAlmería\n\nAlcoi\n\nn\n\nMurcia\n\nC\n\nw ro\n\nof\n\nle sti Map 4 area of detail\n\nCaAranda\n\nSahagún\n\nBurgos\n\nMap 1.

The king had good reason to scrutinize these privileges. Narbonne’s traders moved a great deal of commerce through the port, and this exemption cost the government a significant stream of revenue. In this case, however, the royal administrators’ aims were frustrated by Narbonne’s procurators, who appeared before the bishop to furnish the original charter of enfranchisement issued by none other than Jaume II’s distant ancestor, the count-prince Ramon Berenguer IV (r. 1131–62). Only with vital financial and military assistance from the Narbonnese, the bishop noted, had Ramon Berenguer “extracted Tortosa from the hands of the Muslim enemies.”1 In preparation for the siege and as a means of securing their vital support, Ramon Berenguer had promised these allies these potentially lucrative trading exemptions as well as a monopoly over an enfranchised trading outpost (known as a fondaco) in the city that would only take effect upon the success of the venture.2 Even though the conquest had transpired nearly 150 years before this court appearance, the Crown was legally bound to recognize the continued validity of Jaume’s great-great-grandfather’s perpetual privilege. Accordingly, within the year, royal administrators were 1\n\n2 I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nin the process of purchasing these concessions from the Narbonnese in an attempt to eliminate the liability once and for all.3 Such perpetual privileges were common during preparations for conquest and left durable marks on the political, economic, and juridical landscapes of captured territories. Ramon Berenguer IV’s desire to secure these lands and need for assistance were so great that he signed away future revenue sources and landed rights to enlist and incentivize supporters. At that time, he and his advisors could not comprehend the true cost of the endeavor to the economic and political health of his domains, possibly concluding that they had nothing to lose and everything to gain from the acquisition of these territories. These sorts of concessions initially reduced already limited revenues from these lands. They also constrained the count-prince’s ability to mount the pressure on neighboring Islamic territories necessary to defend his conquests and capture lands to the south. Over the coming decades, the difficulty of making these acquisitions economically and politically viable within the governmental context of the Crown of Aragon would threaten the stability of this dynasty’s political supremacy and hold over security throughout its realms. Given these apparent considerable short- and long-term challenges that repeatedly plagued victorious regimes, how can we account for this insatiable drive to conquer and expand? What implications did these difficulties and setbacks have for the integration and redevelopment of these acquired lands and for their evolving relationships with the societies that had seized them? Numerous studies have underscored the importance of conquest and colonization throughout the medieval period for the creation of the cultural, economic, and political expanse that came to be known as Europe. Robert Bartlett, for example, asserts that expansion along Christendom’s external frontiers was “a process of replication, not differentiation” in which “codifiable blueprints” from the core were implanted in the peripheries.4 He contends that “the legal and institutional blueprints or models which were easily exportable and adaptable but also resistant” in “new circumstances . . . could be modified and survive, but they also transformed their surroundings.”5 While sharing in his view of the central importance of expansion for medieval European history, subsequent work has critiqued Bartlett for overemphasizing the homogeneity of the cores and peripheries and the resulting “deepening cultural uniformity of the Latin West.” Nora Berend, for example, prefers to emphasize the adaptability of the models implanted along the shifting frontiers of a Christendom that “diversified as it expanded.”6\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N 3\n\nBartlett does acknowledge the potential for greater heterogeneity when it comes to the orchestration of territorial integration. Far from an orderly process conducted by an established and uncontested sovereign based in the core, he perceives that structures developed within these peripheries under the direction of numerous competing, “many-headed,” nonroyal authorities with the capacity to be more spontaneous and less risk averse than the average king. “The knightly-clerical-mercantile consortium, not the apparatus of kingly power,” he writes, “orchestrated the most characteristic expansionary movements of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.”7 Indeed, Bartlett has proposed that the strengthening of royal authority around the turn of the fourteenth century in some cases may have served as “some kind of brake on the expansion of Latin Europe.” “The absence of political masterminding in the colonial ventures of the Middle Ages,” he suggests, “is illustrated not only by the prominent role of these eclectic consortia, that is by the agents of expansion, but also by the distinctive nature of the forms of expansion.”8 This book engages with these and related debates over the mechanisms and implications of territorial expansion through the analysis of Catalonia’s interaction with neighboring Muslim-ruled states to the south. Our long-term scope, combined with the richness of this region’s source materials, enables us not only to identify, with considerable detail, the societal elements that helped motivate territorial acquisition but also to evaluate the implications of expansionism for the lands undergoing colonization as well as for the conquering host society itself. As we shall see, various institutions that took root within these new lands became, either by design or through development, distinct in notable ways from those of settled Catalonia to the north. At the same time, the processes of acquisition, integration, and assimilation would exert profound and enduring influences on the economy, demography, and most notably the political affairs of both the captured lands and the conquering entities.\n\nCatalonia’s Southern Frontier Wedged between the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean in northeastern Iberia, Catalonia emerged in the early Middle Ages as a conglomeration of counties, viscounties, and other lordships of varying shapes and sizes. Over the eleventh and early twelfth centuries, it gradually fell under the control of the counts of Barcelona. After these magnates secured title to the kingdom of Aragon by the mid-twelfth century, Catalonia developed into the political and cultural core of the expansionist Crown of Aragon.9\n\n4 I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nBetween the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, Catalonia bordered to the south the Muslim-ruled Upper Frontier of Al-Andalus, which was chiefly administered by the Andalusi cities of Tortosa (Turtu¯ša) and Lleida (La¯rida). ˙ ˙ This region underwent a dramatic shift in the mid-twelfth century. Occupying the prized fertile valleys of the lower Ebro and Segre Rivers in a sector of northeastern Iberia now known as New Catalonia, these Muslim states succumbed to two distinct coalitions of Christian forces led by Ramon Berenguer IV. These conquests had materialized after many unsuccessful attempts by successive regimes punctuating generations of relatively peaceful interaction. Although religious fervor, emboldened by the Second Crusade, encouraged and invigorated these campaigns, political, demographic, and economic shifts on either side of the frontier more significantly influenced the timing and outcome of the conquests. Christian and Muslim rulers and warlords were chiefly interested in asserting their control over wealth and resources, and their activity was less motivated by religious identification. Exhortations to conquer by the papacy and local church leaders who were eager to restore churches on Muslim-held territory could influence these stakeholders at opportune moments, however, especially when there were worldly incentives at play to justify promoting the ecclesiastical agenda.10 These captured territories along the lower Ebro River valley represented the very edge of Christendom in this region for roughly eighty years following this conquest. After ardent campaigning into northern Valencia and only modest territorial gains under Ramon Berenguer IV’s son and grandson, the so-called count-kings of Barcelona and Aragon, Alfons I (r. 1162–96) and Pere I (r. 1196–1213), Jaume I (r. 1213–76) orchestrated the effort that culminated in the fall of Muslim Valencia. This victory, and the resulting effort to pacify, settle, and restructure Valencia, further buffered the former Ebro frontier from Muslim-ruled lands and thereby accelerated the ongoing, painstaking effort to consolidate territory along these former limits of Christian control. The political challenges and fiscal crises experienced by the monarchy in these two generations between the conquests of New Catalonia and Valencia simultaneously shaped and were colored by the dynamics of this turbulent border region with the Islamic world. Economic and demographic fluctuations may have helped generate these campaigns, yet once the battles were over, this vast landscape, with its sizeable population of Muslim inhabitants and high exposure to frontier danger from neighboring Al-Andalus, presented its captors, and anyone who sought to capitalize on it, with formidable organizational challenges. The new territorial rulers, despite being able to draw on resources from their domains in Catalonia and Aragon, lacked the subjects, administrative experience and capacity, and resources to\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N 5\n\nquickly and decisively stabilize and assimilate the captured territories. Over time, as the war effort they struggled to maintain failed to sustain sufficient momentum to yield significant new conquests, the count-kings of Barcelona and Aragon had to reevaluate their goals. They weighed whether their wealth and political capital would benefit more from investing further in this southern frontier than in other costly projects they had inherited from their predecessors. From the very beginnings of Christian rule, this frontier landscape’s institutions, demography, and political framework were distinct—in some respects by the rulers’ explicit design—from those of the core society that was attempting to colonize it. More than previous work has recognized, this frontier zone was also internally diversified and only became more differentiated with the effort to settle and develop the territories.11 For example, the consolidation of these lands witnessed a sharp dichotomy between urban and rural areas. Urbanized cores were much more rapidly invested with Christian institutions due to a comparatively sizeable influx of Christian settlers (and small minority of Jews) stimulated by generous privileges and exemptions. Rural spaces, on the other hand, especially those more exposed to Muslim attack from across the frontier, naturally witnessed sparser settlement and resisted acculturation by Christian-ruled society, even after additional conquests distanced the boundary with Islamic society. Such diverse territorial conditions encouraged jurisdictional differences that grew over the course of consolidation. Ultimately the expansion of Catalonia’s southern frontiers held mixed outcomes for the monarchy and wider society. The attempt to settle, develop, and integrate these captured territories was haphazard. It was hampered by the monarchy’s failure to implement its emerging sovereign ideology and to apply sophisticated, efficacious techniques of consolidation. Over the latter decades of the twelfth century and early years of the thirteenth, the ambitious but weak count-kings would increasingly delegate administration of much of the acquired territory to a range of lords as they struggled to maintain control over public order throughout the realms. Although New Catalonia has a reputation for lacking the peasant servitude that came to afflict Old Catalonia to the north, the postconquest, colonizing dynamic along the Ebro frontier did witness the concentration of resources by the rapid crystallization of oligarchies that worked to the detriment of the local Christian and Muslim peasantry. This was no Turnerian landscape, and as Josep Torró notes, “there was, therefore, strictly speaking, no tabula rasa of equality of opportunities.”12 Most of the powerful or ascendant members of these frontier societies secured their privileged\n\n6 I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\npositions within this landscape owing largely to connections and resources they brought with them. Furthermore, if we look at Catalonia as a whole, we can appreciate how the idea of liberation could promote marginalization elsewhere.13 According to Paul Freedman, the push by lords from the later twelfth century to lay down legal barriers to peasant mobility in Old Catalonia was partly prompted by their concerns that their tenants might relocate to what they assumed were more favorable tenures within the conquered territories of New Catalonia.14 Long after their time on the shifting frontier with Islam had passed, these communities of the lower Ebro valley still lived under the dark shadow of this victory. Considerable research has demonstrated how the manner in which individual cities, towns, villages, and regions were integrated and the extent to which they sought to maintain preconquest infrastructure and patterns could exert a powerful influence over their subsequent development.15 The frontier foundations of their society remained highly noticeable. Many residents and their collectives also clung to the customs, policies, and practices instituted chiefly by the monarchy in the early years of consolidation even as they fell subject to increasingly pervasive seigniorial domination. As this landscape developed, and Europe transitioned from the booming yet rudimentary twelfth into the administratively top-heavy and labyrinthine thirteenth century, it became the site of greater institutional conflict. In the years leading up to the mid-thirteenth century, the monarchy experienced a great infusion of wealth and an accompanying boost in prestige and resources due to the long anticipated definitive conquests of Valencia and Mallorca. By this point, much of the former Ebro frontier had developed into a landscape of quasi-autonomous lordships held by both lay and religious lords. For a variety of reasons, these entities became the target of the ascendant monarchy. Empowered by their recent territorial enrichment, significant improvements in their governmental administrative apparatus, and an emboldened ideology of sovereignty, the later thirteenth-century monarchs sought to subjugate or eradicate these seigniorial autonomies to restore the direct governance once carefully guarded by their predecessors over a century earlier. The inherent conservatism of medieval society made the timing of this enterprise even more significant. The territorial organization and societal institutions imposed by the monarchy, lords, and settlers, sometimes emulating Muslim precedents, formed a blueprint for the future history of the region. Within the broader framework of European growth and development, this book thus argues for more enduring, highly individuated legacies carried by each swath of consolidated frontier territory, and accordingly a\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N 7\n\nmore locally diversified picture of European society and culture. Expansionism on the frontiers did implant increasingly homogenized European social institutions, as Latin Christendom became more interconnected under the growing authority of monarchies and extralocal potentates like the papacy. Yet the human and institutional memories and vestiges of conquest and consolidation rendered these new lands institutionally and culturally distinct from those of their colonizers, despite not being administered as or considered colonial regimes. These differences, however, ultimately owed more to the course of territorial development than to any enduring crusader or conqueror identity among the settlers. When Europe emerged as a colonial power in the fifteenth century, it may itself have been a product of conquest and colonization, as Bartlett has remarked, but its most active principalities remained, in Thomas Bisson’s words, more “federative than integrative.”16 The Crown of Aragon, in particular, persisted as federative because it remained “a cluster of lordships.”17 Thus, in contrast to Bartlett’s belief in a general rising trend of homogeneity throughout Europe and its peripheries, this book presents the view that heterogeneity was enhanced rather than diminished by centuries of expansionism and indeed remained the norm rather than the exception throughout as well as beyond the medieval period. At the realm-wide level, this book asks whether engagements with these lands, culminating in conquest, strengthened or destabilized the power ­relationships between the ascendant rulers in Catalonia, the counts of ­Barcelona, and their competitors within and beyond the region, which included assertive nobles as well as a number of other comital families, not to mention the kings of Aragon and Castile. After the conquest, were Ramon ­Berenguer IV and his successors able to capitalize on these victories by ­effectively ­consolidating the spoils and using the new frontier as a s­ taging point for raiding and capturing additional territories? Did such territorial accumulation facilitate further centralization throughout the conquering regime or did it help foster the creation or empowerment of rivals determined to undercut royal authority? Did governmental centralization under a single ruler or king promote or deter territorial expansionism? At the local level, we must evaluate how the count-kings drew on the resources derived from conquest to increase their prestige and ­administrative capabilities, consequently reducing the autonomy of diverse lords t­ hroughout Catalonia. Furthermore, we will examine to what extent these conquerors replicated their institutions when integrating captured territory. Did the imposition of certain “blueprints” have a lasting influence on the development of societies taking shape on these lands?\n\n8 I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nMethodology and Structure Controversy surrounds the concept of frontiers, with some scholars proposing to do away altogether with use of “frontier” as a term within the context of medieval society.18 As with other baggage-ridden terms employed by medievalists (in many cases, reluctantly), such as “feudalism” and “othering,” “frontier,” when not employed with precision or attention to historicity, does run the risk of complicating the situations it seeks to describe. These problems originate not only in the application of models that may not suit the historical situations in question, but also in the use of the same term to characterize societies that were arguably exceedingly different from one another.19 The approach employed here is to utilize “frontier” and descriptions of space in precise ways that are consistent with the historical evidence in order to facilitate analysis and enhance reader comprehension. As we shall see, medieval documents from Catalonia recognized frontier regions as a distinct category of landed space known as a marchio that could be claimed as a political territorial unit by a potentate. Sources also occasionally did employ the term frontera to refer to the political boundary with Islamic ­territory that ­ nstable,20 rendered the neighboring Christian-ruled lands dangerous and u but much more frequent references use other words, such as “desert” and “waste,” that seem to evoke the untamed and vacant frontier wilderness envisioned by Turner, which could serve as “a gate of escape from the bondage of the past” for intrepid settlers.21 However, as many scholars now recognize, these references in fact often described a wilderness devoid not of people but of inhabitants who were part of the Latin Christian social order or power network. Indeed, they could, within the crusader ­mentality, have served as means to deny those who maintained independent existences or who did not recognize the sacred authority of Christians and their church the right to occupy their lands legitimately.22 Nuanced readings of the sources, rather than merely models and theories imported from other fields and time periods, will guide our observation and interpretation of the dynamics of this frontier environment. In its methodology and design, this project seeks to contribute to scholarship on both Iberian and wider European expansionism. Previous work on Iberia has tended to focus chiefly on conquests and their immediate aftermaths, thereby giving short shrift to the preconquest developments that often had important implications for the course of land capture as well as the dynamics of the ensuing consolidation. In limiting their treatments to the first generation of Christian rule, these studies have rarely been in a position to observe the long-term gestation of the frontier landscape.23 This book, by\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N 9\n\ncontrast, traces over 150 years of postconquest societal development in order to consider how the nature of New Catalonia’s conquest and ensuing colonization exerted a sustained yet variegated influence on this region’s organization and administration. Those projects that have studied long-term societal change have primarily been interested in the interaction of ethno-religious minority groups, a process still referred to as convivencia by many scholars even as that term has increasingly fallen subject to criticism.24 Due to this focus, much of this work has not been equipped to examine the broader social context surrounding such interfaith relationships.25 Scholars have also been attracted to thirteenth-century conquests when royal administration was more dominant and capable and, accordingly, produced more systematic documentation.26 As a result, they have often neglected the study of twelfth-century conquests when the contest between royal and seigneurial power was more volatile and when techniques crucial to later expansionism into the Balearic Islands, Valencia, and the wider Mediterranean were still in the early stages of development. Historians of medieval Iberia have tended to grant conflicts with neighboring Muslim societies, and the diverse, piecemeal, and often disconnected efforts to conquer the lands under their control, traditionally known as the Reconquista,27 a central position in the historical narrative.28 Given this tendency, it is somewhat surprising that the broader political and institutional history of Catalonia’s southern limits during these centuries has yet to be examined in depth by a modern study in any language. Although Catalonia’s development is admittedly not well accommodated by the nationalistic, Castile-centric conceptualization of the Reconquista, its frontier history has nevertheless long been viewed by Catalan historians as a formative golden age during which its social fabric and país were forged.29 Moreover, the vast local archives in Tortosa and Lleida, a core documentary focus of this project, have been left virtually unexplored by previous scholarship. Prior work has tended to study individual settlements within New Catalonia in isolation or focus on a single institution or collective rather than viewing them within the broader societal context of the conquered region.30 In keeping with these objectives, historians of conquest also often rely primarily on one type of documentation (e.g., royal, municipal, ecclesiastical, monastic, or noble), which can promote skewed historical perspectives. This project instead seeks to present a multidimensional social history of consolidation by relying on documents from each of these points of view and from a diversity of archives. This book’s focus on the administrative implications of territorial expansion has necessitated a deliberately Eurocentric approach that should not\n\n10 I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nimply that I consider the history of non-Christian groups to be less relevant to this history.31 Indeed, this book is deeply connected, in terms of both its underlying research and argument, to other work I have recently published, most notably my first monograph, Contested Treasure: Jews and Authority in the Crown of Aragon, which examined how the changing policies of the monarchy and local lords within this conquered landscape influenced the administrative conditions and status of Jewish communities within Tortosa and other centers and areas within the Crown of Aragon and wider Europe.32 Victory’s Shadow contextualizes the case study of Tortosa by showing how the administrative patterns it assessed were related to broader trends in Christian-ruled society’s efforts to manage these frontier territories. Due in part to the pronounced shift in the historiography toward the study of Andalusi systems and the experience of ethno-religious minorities following conquest over the past several decades, the implications of the transfer from Muslim to Christian control on the society and government of Christian-ruled Catalonia to be addressed here has received less recent attention and remains less well understood. Another aspect of this history that this book contextualizes but will not address in detail is the restoration and development of the dioceses of Tortosa and Lleida. The establishment of these sees was part of a broader process of organizing the ecclesiastical space of the captured territories and ordering the relationships between the bishoprics and other newly founded religious institutions within these lands that is the subject of a third, in-progress monograph related to this line of research, From the Hands of the Infidels: The Christianization of Islamic Landscapes in Europe.33 Readers should approach these books as a loosely interconnected trilogy, despite their order of publication. This present volume engages in the long-term analysis of the development, conquest, and consolidation of this frontier that serves as a framework for the other two more focused monographs. This study frames its analysis using two interrelated and interwoven narratives. First, it presents and assesses the intricate political and military history of the conquest of New Catalonia over the course of the eleventh and twelfth centuries and numerous attempts to push that frontier further southward into Valencia that would witness limited success until the unprecedented campaigns of Jaume I in the 1230s. Second, it examines in detail how the emerging governmental structures within Catalonia confronted, and were influenced by, the trials they faced in managing the conquest and the consolidation of the Ebro valley frontier as well as the subsequent war effort along that front with Valencia. Each of these ongoing enterprises were, in turn, linked to formidable challenges to their rule by a range of\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N 11\n\nrivals, from petty castellans and frontier warlords to more powerful counts and viscounts. There is naturally inherent value in reconstructing and analyzing the history of the integration of Catalonia’s understudied southern territories. It is my hope that this book will offer more by providing a complicated perspective on the relationship between a core and periphery to readers interested in comparing the gestation of frontiers and encourage them to further nuance their generalized models. Catalonia’s southern boundary was internally variegated across time and space, and its influences on the rest of the region were similarly diverse and dynamic. Far from being peripheral and distanced from the important turning points faced by the colonizing society, this frontier zone remained integral to the political developments that shaped the entirety of Catalonia, and the Catalano-Aragonese culture that pervaded it.\n\nq Pa rt I Interaction and Conquest\n\nq Ch ap ter 1 Parias and Churches along the Eleventh-Century Frontier\n\nScholars have long been perplexed and intrigued by the coexistence of conflictive and collaborative modes of behavior in the interactions of Christian- and Muslim-ruled societies within the premodern Iberian Peninsula. Their dealings were often aggressive and exploitative and usually culminated in territorial conquest. They could also feature mutually beneficial collaboration and even friendship that feel out of place in reference to the traditional view of Christian–Andalusi relations as chiefly a religiously defined war.1 Potentates who held lands that bordered the Islamic world faced a heightened potential of invasion or extortion at the hands of their Muslim neighbors. At the same time, direct access to the Andalusi world facilitated vital alliances with these Muslim rulers and increased opportunities for enrichment and expansion.2 Territorial lords themselves recognized the importance of these interfaith relationships, so much so that they became accustomed to adopting titles over their frontiers as honorific distinctions and as testaments to the fact that they were members of an upwardly mobile elite group of frontier potentates.3 At the same time, there can be no question that frontier interaction had a religious bent to it. Documentation, especially the sources produced by church leaders, underscores the religious dimensions of the campaigns to regain formerly Christian territory that had stood under Muslim rule since 15\n\n16 PA RT\n\nI . I N T E R A C T I O N A N D CO N Q U EST\n\nthe Arabs wrested the bulk of the Peninsula from Visigothic control centuries earlier.4 Fixated as they were on the Christianization of the landscape, popes showed little interest in or comprehension of the political divisions of the Upper Frontier of al-Andalus that were fundamental to territorial accumulation by Christian regimes. When Urban II outlined the effort to Pedro I of Aragon in the 1090s, for example, he relied exclusively on ecclesiastical markers, ancient dioceses held captive by the “domination of the Muslims” (sarracenorum dominacio), to describe Andalusi territory.5 Although papal and local church sources issued from the later eleventh century onward are helpful for piecing together the ecclesiastical context of Christian campaigns into the Ebro valley, they can also provide a skewed picture of the involvement of other factors linked to developing political affairs in the region. Such documentation can lead us to overemphasize the extent to which the restoration project dictated Christian interaction with Muslim societies. It is not always clear that rulers saw their world exclusively, or even predominately, from this religious perspective.6 Their frequently opportunistic decisions to violate alliances with Muslim counterparts in order to push for territorial conquest were surely the result of numerous complicated factors, only one of which was a sense of religious calling or the desire for spiritual favors. As the first in a series of three chapters constituting the initial part of this study, the pages that follow will begin our examination of the interactions between Christian- and Muslim-ruled lands that took place many decades before Christian forces would embark on the campaigns that would realize the definitive conquest of the Ebro River valley. In order to set the stage, this initial chapter will pursue a line of argument that follows two main threads. First, it will assess the extent to which political survival in the Christian territories of the northeastern Peninsula depended on interaction with Islamic peoples to the south. Although scholars have long recognized the significance of such contact for the political entities and forces within this region in general, they have not explored in detail the full implications of communication, collaboration, and conflict across the Ebro frontier preceding the mid-twelfth-century conquest by Christian forces. This analysis will be relevant to our discussion later on in the book when we will observe how the dynamics of this jockeying for positions and influence along the frontier would, in certain respects, have powerful repercussions for the nature of the capture and consolidation of these lands. Second, we will examine how church leaders, based locally in the northeastern Peninsula and further afield, sought to campaign for the cause of restoring the “captive” churches and dioceses by pressuring rulers and their allies to view interaction\n\nPA R I A S A N D C H U R C H ES A LO N G T H E 1 1 T H - CE N T U R Y F R O N T I E R 17\n\nwith Muslim-ruled society exclusively through an ecclesiastical lens. As we shall see, these two modes of interaction were not always in direct opposition to one another and at times could be surprisingly complementary.\n\nFrontier Engagement and Political Development in the Eleventh Century In 1038, just three years into his tenure as count of Barcelona, Ramon Berenguer I (r. 1035–76) gave two of his men “vacant land” (terra nostra erma) at the far limits of his county of Barcelona. This territory would eventually come to be known as the Conca de Barberà, and within two centuries of this donation it would be situated at the core of Catalonia and the Crown of Aragon. In 1038, however, as Ramon Berenguer was careful to stipulate in his charter, this “barren” land, “where no man lives or sheep graze,” faced the “Ishmaelite peoples.” The count mandated that, in addition to inhabiting and working the land, these two men would have to build a castle to defend the position against these Muslims. The donor and recipients had already surveyed the territory and identified a “hill that they call Forés” as the ideal spot for the fortification.7 An increasing proliferation of these sorts of transactions by the counts of Barcelona and other rulers and magnates with a frontier presence during the eleventh century served to strengthen their hold over the furthest reaches of their claimed territories and support assaults against Muslim fortifications and settlements to the south. This new trend contrasted sharply with the circumstances that had predominated in this region over the past few generations. Aside from the “unofficial” expansion caused by the unregulated migration of settlers to the fringes of Christian territory, the frontiers of the “Catalan” and “Aragonese” counties of Barcelona, Osona/Manresa, Cerdanya, Urgell, Pallars, Ribagorza, Sobrarbe, and Aragon with the Islamic world had barely moved since around 950.8 During the early decades of the eleventh century, the upsurge in the Muslim offensive during the career of the powerful chamberlain known as al-Mans·u¯r (r. 977–1002) seemed poised to disrupt this stasis. Al-Mans·u¯r’s activity had augmented the prestige and military dominance of the caliphate through twice-yearly campaigns against the petty Christian states clustered along the frontier. The Christian rulers across the Peninsula had once again found themselves on the defensive. Caliph al-H·akam II al-Mustans·ir had died in 976 with only one young son, Hisha¯m. Muh·ammad ibn Abı¯ ʿA¯mir, later known as al-Mans·u¯r, had worked to effect Hisha¯m’s accession and subsequently rose to prominence as his most important advisor, known officially\n\n18 PA RT\n\nI . I N T E R A C T I O N A N D CO N Q U EST\n\nas h· a¯jib or “chamberlain.”9 The most famous of these devastating raids, in 985, culminated in the defeat of Count Borrell II (r. 947–92), the sacking of his administrative base in Barcelona, the enslavement of part of its population, and the destruction of the comital archives.10 Barcelona alone was besieged or infiltrated by Muslim forces no less than five times during this period (in 978, 982, 984, 985, and 1003).11 Al-Mans·u¯r’s campaigns were not confined to the Christian lands of the northeast.12 His armies also afflicted many of the major Christian principalities bordering Muslim-ruled territory, burned Christian monasteries and holy sites, and carried off large amounts of booty (including, infamously, church bells) from as far north as Santiago de Compostela.13 Although these raids penetrated deeply into Christian territory and inflicted significant damage, they secured no notable lasting territorial gains for al-Mans·u¯r.14 When they were not having to fend off Muslim raiding, these Christian principalities had their own internal struggles and the integrity of their frontiers with Christian-ruled neighbors to preoccupy them.15 The political map of this region underwent many alterations during this period, and by the mid-eleventh century, the autonomous Christian principalities along the frontier with al-Andalus were much reduced in number. Only the county of Barcelona, with its affiliate county of Osona/Manresa, the county of Urgell, and the kingdoms of Aragon and Navarre remained of what had once been an extensive patchwork of independent states.16 Despite winning many battles against the Christians, al-Mans·u¯r’s focus on these campaigns, to the exclusion of other considerations, eventually lost him the war. His fixation on reforms meant to increase the caliphate’s military strength at any cost transformed al-Andalus into a land whose nativized inhabitants were subject to a foreign Berber soldier elite transplanted from North Africa. Increasingly, internal conflicts arising from political discontentment distracted him from his military preoccupations.17 This political reorientation by non-native elements was not limited to the early eleventh century. It was a pattern that would continue to influence al-Andalus in subsequent generations, most notably with the entrance of the centralizing North African Almoravids and Almohads beginning in 1085 and 1147, respectively.18 And just as the late caliphate’s reliance on transplanted Maghrebian forces was inherently unstable, these later dynasties, as we shall see, would never be able to maintain stable rule over the lands of al-Andalus for long. Even so, al-Mans·u¯r’s death did not in itself foment the dissolution of the centralized state of al-Andalus. His son and successor, ʿAbd al-Malik (r. 1002–8) struggled to maintain these military efforts against the Christians every year until his death in 1008. The effective power\n\nPA R I A S A N D C H U R C H ES A LO N G T H E 1 1 T H - CE N T U R Y F R O N T I E R 19\n\nof the Umayyad caliphate of Córdoba was ultimately reduced to nothing during his weak reign.19 Numerous constituencies within and outside Córdoba sought, unsuccessfully, to control the deteriorating caliphal office. As the authority of the caliphate rapidly disintegrated with the civil war (fitna) following al-Mans·u¯r’s death in 1002, the decentralizing forces of the disparate regions overwhelmed any further attempts to hold al-Andalus together in one piece.20 After another Umayyad emir failed to resuscitate the caliphate and ended up fleeing to Lleida to the north, the vizier Abu¯ H·asm ibn Jahwar, who headed the leading men of Córdoba, proclaimed the caliphate officially abolished.21 The cities of North Africa detached themselves from Córdoba, and Muslim-ruled Iberia shattered into a multitude of separate autonomously administrated states known as taifas (from the Arabic t· a¯ʾifa, “party” or “group”).22 Although the caliphate initially broke up into at least thirty-eight individual taifa states, their composition would vary over the coming years.23 The Upper Frontier of al-Andalus (or Thaghr al-ʿAqsa), which occupied much of the length of the Ebro River valley, was less affected by this process of fragmentation due to its ingrained political organization and administrative culture.24 During the emirate and caliphate, Córdoba had practiced a policy of periodically changing governors in order to discourage any tendencies to establish local bases of independent power. This practice did not become normative in the Thaghr, however, where permanent military governors (qa¯ʾid) tended to administer each major urban center (madı¯na).25 As early as the ninth century, this emerging pattern was fostering the development of local ruling dynasties.26 The dominance exercised by the Banu¯ Hu¯d family over the eastern Thaghr during the latter half of the eleventh century, for instance, was based on the governmental structures already well in place during the final years of the caliphate.27 Following the dissolution of the caliphate, the governmental structures of al-Andalus would never again attain such a high degree of administrative cohesion. The forces of political entropy remained too powerful for any centralizing group to counteract for long. When it fractured into the taifa states of Zaragoza, Lleida, and Tortosa, the Thaghr came to mirror the segmented political units constituting the former Carolingian “Spanish March” to the north. Despite sharing similar cultures, religious creeds, administrative structures, and languages,28 the taifas were locked in competition with each other that compromised their collective struggle against the Christian principalities to the north.29 Some degree of localized centralization did occur within the Thaghr during the eleventh and early twelfth centuries. Under this same Banu¯ Hu¯d family, most notably, Zaragoza developed into arguably the most powerful taifa\n\n20 PA RT\n\nI . I N T E R A C T I O N A N D CO N Q U EST\n\nkingdom in al-Andalus. From the 1040s, Zaragoza achieved even greater influence. Under this dynasty’s most significant rulers, Ah·mad ibn Sulayma¯n al-Muqtadir (r. 1049–81) and his descendants, Yu¯suf ibn Ah·mad (r. 1081–85) the and Ah·mad ibn Yu¯suf (r. 1085–1110), the Hu¯dids temporarily exercised authority over the whole of the eastern Thaghr.30 They incorporated Huesca sometime in the first half of the eleventh century and acquired Lleida in 1139–40. Tortosa fell under Hu¯did influence in 1060.31 When the emirate and caliphate had been at their peaks of power, they had been able to demand large tribute payments from exposed Christian polities in return for peace. As al-Andalus decentralized, however, Christian rulers reversed this relationship and extorted similar payments (parias) from different taifa kingdoms.32 Count Ramon Berenguer I of Barcelona was among the earliest to be able to secure such tribute by developing castral positions along the limits of his lands during the early years of his reign.33 By the mid-eleventh century, the influx of gold via parias into Ramon Berenguer’s coffers, and those of rival Christian rulers, had greatly heightened the stakes of interaction with the taifa states, putting at risk the independence of any Christian principality that did not participate in this enrichment. From this point forward, frontier rulers found themselves pitted in fierce competition to appear as the most imminent threat to neighboring Muslim frontier potentates. These Christians magnates appear to have understood well that the success of this delicate, diplomatic zero-sum game depended on their ability to control the men they delegated to guard the castles within striking distance of Muslim territory. They sought to exercise this control via tightly worded written agreements that were littered with security clauses. In one representative agreement from 1076, Counts Ramon Berenguer II (r. 1076–82) and Berenguer Ramon II (r. 1076–96) appointed Bonafill Oliba to fortify a holding at Puig de Anguera, on Barcelona’s furthest limit (marcha extrema) at the north of Tarragona’s camp. The rulers not only restricted Bonafill from selecting another lord or alienating the holding but also claimed full authority over his right to make peace or war with the Muslims.34 Given the instability of this political environment, rulers seeking to consolidate their power and nobles desiring to enhance their autonomy often preferred the quick gains of plunder and tribute over costly and more risky campaigns aimed at conquering territory.35 The chancery records of Ramon Berenguer I of Barcelona are peppered with documentation concerned with maintaining or regaining payments of tribute. In 1058, for example, he\n\nPA R I A S A N D C H U R C H ES A LO N G T H E 1 1 T H - CE N T U R Y F R O N T I E R 21\n\npromised Ramon Guifré, count of Cerdanya, an annual payment of gold and other pecuniary concessions as an aid for increasing the “marca d’Oluges” toward Muslim territory. In exchange, Ramon Guifré swore his fealty to the count and promised to help him obtain parias from Lleida and Zaragoza as well as to maintain Tortosa’s established payment of tribute.36 As with any other right or possession, present and future parias could be shared or pledged, as Ramon Berenguer did to his wife, Almodis, along with a long list of frontier castles, in 1056.37 Ramon Berenguer’s successful tactics earned him 9,000 mancus annually from Lleida, Tortosa, and Zaragoza between 1050 and 1060.38 Far from being mutually exclusive, projects to expand territorial boundaries and establish new fortified positions supported this growing interest in maintaining the flow of tribute. Conquests and castles could improve defensive and offensive capabilities, which, in turn, could serve as means to extort more effectively further tribute over the competing ambitions of Christian rivals. For example, when the first king of independent Aragon, Ramiro I (r. 1035–63), attacked Zaragoza’s town of Graus in 1063, the taifa was at that time already a tributary of Ramiro’s half-brother, King Fernando I of Castile-León (r. 1037–65).39 Fernando was keen on protecting Zaragoza, and thereby monopolizing its tribute, until its resources were exhausted or he were able to conquer it. Accordingly, Fernando quickly dispatched an army, led by his son and Rodrigo Díaz, the future Cid, to assist Zaragoza’s ruler, al-Muqtadir, in mounting a defense against the Aragonese. These allied forces soon confronted the Aragonese, killing Ramiro I and compelling his men to lift their attack on Graus and take flight.40 Such competition over parias and territory frequently occasioned these sorts of complicated interfaith alliances. Two decades later, in 1082, for instance, Count Berenguer Ramon II of Barcelona organized a major coalition composed of Aragon, Navarre, and his tributary, al-Mundhir ibn Ah·mad, ruler of the affiliated taifas of Lleida-Tortosa, against al-Muqtadir’s successor, al-Muʾtamin of Zaragoza. Yet again, a federation of Muslim and Castilian troops commanded by Rodrigo Díaz moved in to defend Zaragoza. They defeated Berenguer Ramon’s coalition at Almenar, north of Lleida.41 Undeterred, Berenguer Ramon continued to engage in careful diplomacy with an eye to maintaining the flow of parias from his tributaries that was vital to his ongoing struggle to strengthen his authority over his rebellious vassals. He soon sought to help this same dependent, al-Mundhir, gain control of Valencia in order to buffer al-Mundhir’s territories from erosion by the combined forces of Zaragoza and Castile. After numerous expeditions\n\n22 PA RT\n\nI . I N T E R A C T I O N A N D CO N Q U EST\n\ntargeting Valencia in the late 1080s, however, Berenguer Ramon again suffered defeat by the forces of Rodrigo Díaz in 1090 at Tévar. By then, Rodrigo had been appointed the protector of King al-Qadir of Valencia, effectively eliminating the count of Barcelona’s chances to capture Valencia and furthermore losing him the parias of Lleida, Tortosa, and Zaragoza. This turn of events also hurt Berenguer Ramon’s reputation among church leaders because it raised doubts regarding his ability to secure the restoration of the archiepiscopal see of Tarragona.42 By the late 1080s, after being accused of fratricide, Berenguer Ramon II had been demoted from count to serving as quasi-regent to the young Ramon Berenguer III (r. 1086–1131), a position he held until 1097. Rodrigo Díaz had counterparts in Aragon and Catalonia, who similarly negotiated between Christian and Muslim rulers on either side of the frontier in order to enhance their own authority and enrich themselves. Mir Geribert, one of the most prominent nobles in open rebellion against Count Ramon Berenguer I of Barcelona in the 1050s, was in frequent, independent negotiation with the taifa rulers. In 1058, for example, when messengers from the count came to meet with Mir Geribert, they discovered that he was already engaged in his own talks with the Muslims of Tortosa.43 Such activity frustrated attempts by ambitious dynasts like Ramon Berenguer to dominate contact in the region with the taifa rulers in order to monopolize the flow of tribute. Following this encounter in 1058, this count went so far as to invoke a judicial tribunal to force Mir Geribert to swear an oath that he would not interfere with Ramon Berenguer’s “paria from Spain (Ispania).” Rulers like Ramon Berenguer already faced difficulty protecting their share of Muslim tribute against incursions by other sovereign rulers. This combined internal and external competition for parias constituted a significant threat to the fiscal health and overarching authority of comital governments. Muslim and Christian religious leaders alike held such interfaith collaboration in bitter contempt.44 Popular vernacular works, such as the well-known, eleventh- or early twelfth-century Song of Roland, advertised the dangers of fighting alongside Muslims. Successive popes, together with religious leaders situated outside of Rome, reinforced the messages conveyed by such writings through their firm exhortations to Christian warrior aristocrats to dispense with their rivalries and ally together against the common religious enemy.45 For their part, church leaders in Catalonia sporadically punished what they viewed as nonconstructive behavior by lay magnates whenever it was politically feasible and expedient, such as when they forced Count Ramon V of Pallars Jussà (r. 1047–98) to perform penance for allying with Muslim troops.46\n\nPA R I A S A N D C H U R C H ES A LO N G T H E 1 1 T H - CE N T U R Y F R O N T I E R 23\n\nThe development of theories of holy war by religious elites on either side of the confessional divide appears to have intensified their respective views on the sacrilege committed by coreligionist opportunists who nonchalantly allied with infidels to achieve worldly goals.47 This trend is especially noticeable within the Muslim context. In the mid-eleventh century, for example, the administrator and jurist ibn H·azm lamented the vices that, in his view, had become increasingly rampant among the opportunistic rulers operating the fragmented environment of the taifas. “By God, I swear that if the [taifa] tyrants were to learn that they could attain their ends more easily by adopting the religion of the Cross, they would certainly hasten to profess it!” He claimed to yearn for the days when a more centralized political system had allegedly reined in such abuses.48 Similarly, some years later, the poet al-Sumaysı¯r scathingly denounced these same taifa overlords for the damage their self-centered agendas had inflicted on the shared Islamic cause: “You have handed over Islam into enemy captivity . . . since you have given your support to the Christians . . . so that you have even broken the bonds of the community of the Prophet!”49 Such feelings of betrayal by Islamic religious leaders would only intensify after the fall of Toledo in 1085. High-profile losses to the Christian enemy encouraged a broadening of the critique that often bordered on lament. A poem mourning the loss of Toledo blamed the defeat on the entire Andalusi Muslim community for failing to adhere to the principles of Islam: “Can we be sure that vengeance will not fall upon us, when corruption has combined with license among us?”50 Even though Muslim and Christian religious leaders continued to voice these sorts of denunciations, interfaith collaboration remained common and continued to define the shared sociopolitical environment of the frontier. On the Christian-ruled side, this phenomenon persisted in no small part because parias, and consequently diplomatic relations with the taifa states and their Christian allies and protectors, were so crucial to the economic and political viabilities of the Christian principalities of the northeast. According to now classic work by Pierre Bonnassie, the economic evolution of Catalonia between 980 and 1050 was largely fueled the continual, “massive” influx of Muslim dinars.51\n\nA Double-Edged Sword: The Frontier and Political Crisis in Eleventh-Century Catalonia Although the proximity of Muslim territory did offer Christian principalities economic stimulus that could be vital for regime stability and survival, it simultaneously threatened their political viabilities. This tension between\n\n24 PA RT\n\nI . I N T E R A C T I O N A N D CO N Q U EST\n\nthe positive and negative repercussions of the frontier’s presence heavily weighed upon the political climate of the northeastern Peninsula. Catalonia’s state of affairs following the death of Count Ramon Borrell of Barcelona (r. 992–1017) will serve as a useful case to illustrate these varying pressures. Although significant disagreement remains over the extent of the disruption, scholars now commonly agree that Ramon Borrell’s demise, in 1017, generated a political vacuum that caused the progressive erosion of comital authority over the following several decades.52 The ineffectual reign of Berenguer Ramon I (r. 1017–35) seems to have done little to slow this trend. During the minority of Ramon Berenguer I of Barcelona, which lasted until 1041, comital administrators had little choice but to entrust frontier defense to a number of noble warlords: Guillem de Mediona was active within the county of Osona, Arnau Mir de Tost oversaw the county of Urgell, and Mir Geribert dominated the county of Barcelona. These men appear to have used this period of instability to assert independence from comital authority that they then hoped to maintain once Ramon Berenguer I assumed his majority. Such independence entailed making agreements, transactions, and enfeoffing their holdings to dependents without comital involvement or approval.53 Many counties in the region were affected by these phenomena, including Pallars, Cerdanya, Urgell, and Barcelona. Arnau Mir de Tost, for example, was able to carve out a considerable territory that included some thirty castles along the Muslim boundary zone with Urgell. He then made preparations to pass these territories along to his descendants without comital approval, as if they were his personal property.54 The situation was difficult to manage for the different Catalonian counts because they depended on these men to assist in the defense of their territories as well as to support offensives against the Muslims. For example, Ramon Berenguer I’s reliance on warlords such as Arnau to stage raids into Muslim territory is made clear by an agreement (convenientia) from 1050 in which the count commended him with the castles of Camarasa and Cubells. These fortifications were key staging points for raids against Muslim centers along the Segre River valley above Lleida. Ramon Berenguer also promised Arnau half of the castle and town of Muslim Balaguer on the condition that he support the successful campaign. He not only reserved access these castles and the right (known as potestas) to reclaim them at will but also mandated how much military service Arnau and his men would have to provide. Although he was defensive about reserving his entitlement to these holdings and Arnau’s service as his man, Ramon Berenguer positioned himself carefully so as not to encroach upon the liege status already held by Count Ermengol III of Urgell (r. 1038–66). Arnau\n\nPA R I A S A N D C H U R C H ES A LO N G T H E 1 1 T H - CE N T U R Y F R O N T I E R 25\n\nwould only be required to accompany Ramon Berenguer as his supporter on campaigns from which Ermengol was absent. If the count of Urgell were participating, then Arnau would ride with Ermengol and Arnau’s son would accompany Ramon Berenguer in his place. Arnau would, furthermore, be obliged to solicit counsel from Ramon Berenguer for any independent expeditions he chose to undertake.55 Ermengol of Urgell was sufficiently concerned about this developing relationship between Ramon Berenguer and Arnau Mir de Tost to formulate two convenientiae of his own in 1058. In the first charter, Arnau recognized that he held the castle of Casserras (in the Ribagorza) from the count and promised to use it and his other resources to defend his lord against all enemies and obtain tributaries in return for two-thirds of all parias obtained. For his part, Ermengol would supplement Arnau’s expenses for maintaining the castle from the parias he received from Zaragoza and Lleida and would take over responsibility for the castle guard during set periods in the future. The second agreement, in addition to reiterating Arnau’s duty to support the count of Urgell, directed special attention at hardening the former’s preferential relationship with the latter to the exclusion of Ramon Berenguer. It explicitly barred Arnau from expanding on his relationship with Ramon without Ermengol’s prior consent. He could not, for instance, accept Ramon’s offer to take command of the frontier castle of Estopiñán or agree to a marriage alliance unless Ermengol first approved of it. In addition to emphasizing Arnau’s obligation to aid him, as his liege lord, over the count of Barcelona at all times, the count of Urgell also reserved his right to modify the aforementioned earlier convenientia between Ramon Berenguer and Arnau regarding the castles of Camarasa and Cubells without any input from Arnau.56 Both the origins of and the solution to the crisis of comital authority thus appear to have lain in the opportunities presented by the Islamic frontier. Each of these counts sought, via these sorts of agreements, to direct and delimit the activity of these castral lords so that it would empower rather than undermine the counts’ diplomatic and governmental strategies. Effectively managing conflicts with these men was essential for maintaining not only public order but also profitable relationships with Muslim tributaries. In his confrontation with the insubordinate Mir Geribert, for example, Ramon Berenguer I of Barcelona had to manage a war against his rebellious defenders of the frontier while simultaneously putting on a good face for his Muslim neighbors so as not to raise their suspicion regarding his ability to attack. He continued to launch periodic campaigns and organize profitable truces with these Muslim rulers, all the time struggling to maintain the façade of\n\n26 PA RT\n\nI . I N T E R A C T I O N A N D CO N Q U EST\n\nnormalcy in order to encourage the continued flow of parias. In 1051, when the Muslims could or would not or pay tribute, Ramon Berenguer decided to launch a punitive raid despite the continuing rebellion of Mir Geribert. Fortunately for this count, the expedition was both short and successful, and in 1052 he was able to resume his efforts to subdue this warlord without significant loss of ground.57 Certain Muslim rulers appear to have intervened strategically in these engagements, presumably in hopes of prolonging such conflicts. In the late 1060s, for instance, Count Ramon V of Pallars Jussà lost his domains to his cousin, the aforementioned Arnau Mir de Tost, and sought assistance with this desperate situation from the taifa “king” known as “Alzagib.” Ramon eventually regained his county but later submitted to pressure to perform public penance for this interfaith alliance.58 In the subsequent record of dispute between Ramon and Arnau Mir, the count appears to have reordered and recontextualized events in order to make his alliance seem more palatable. Ramon defended his alliance with the Muslim ruler on the grounds that it was a peace treaty that his cousin had then broken without authorization, thereby causing “great damage” to his interests.59 Just like paria gold, the existence of Muslim potentates willing to commit their troops to conflicts between Christians could be a double-edged sword for Christian political leaders. Accordingly, Christian rulers utilized their power of lordship to monopolize these diplomatic resources and put their delegates in compromised positions. After having relied on Muslim support to regain control of his county, for example, this same Ramon V of Pallars Jussà ordered thirty of his most important supporters to take oaths that they would not make similar alliances.60 Similarly, when Ramon Berenguer I’s men performed homage to him, they were obliged to swear not to enlist Muslim agents against their lord.61 Imposing these sorts of requirements came at a price, however. Ramon Berenguer I lacked the political capital during much of his rule to advance all of his comital interests at the expense of the powerful warlords within his domains. In addition to submitting to pressure to share his paria incomes, this count had to concede to these warlords a certain degree of jurisdictional autonomy.62 The breakdown of comital “public” authority during Ramon’s tenure featured the domination and privatization by these warlords of expanses of formerly free peasant lands.63 Steadily over the course of many years, the peasantry had been migrating southward to settle unclaimed lands in the interstices between Islamic and Christian principalities that did not fall under the jurisdiction of any seigniorial authority. Many scholars continue to believe that this process of unregulated, independent settlement contributed\n\nPA R I A S A N D C H U R C H ES A LO N G T H E 1 1 T H - CE N T U R Y F R O N T I E R 27\n\nnearly as much as conquest to the expansion of Christian-held territory.64 Gradually, however, these allodial settlers lost their freedom, and they were subjugated by lords, integrated into their seigniorial domains, and made to pay to arbitrary levies and submit to restrictions on their mobility.65 In most locales, this “privileged moment,” as Bonnassie termed it, when the peasants had enjoyed their own surpluses and relatively free movement within the agrarian market economy, appears to have been brief.66 Similar conditions would not be witnessed in Catalonia until the capture of new lands from Muslim Tortosa and Lleida in the mid-twelfth century, a period of expansion that would be followed by yet another cycle of declining comital capacity for authority, increasing seigniorial autonomy, and a corresponding deterioration of settler conditions, as we will see.67 According to Freedman, this incorporation of large sectors of sparsely settled land ended up worsening circumstances for most peasants in Old Catalonia. Fearing that their tenants might relocate to more favorable tenures on lands captured from the Muslims, many landlords imposed legal restrictions to curtail peasant mobility.68 Due to this ratcheting back of comital oversight, administrative conditions at the lowest levels of society were therefore growing less regulated. Among the upper echelons, however, we can perceive a contrary trend, as the counts reconstructed their authority using new foundations. As Adam Kosto and others have demonstrated, written agreements redefining mutual obligations between lords and agents were instrumental in reestablishing and strengthening comital supremacy over certain sectors. From the later eleventh century onward, these enactments gradually established a rudimentary hierarchy of fidelity in support of this renewed comital authority.69 Military operations that eroded the fringes of Muslim-held territory mounted pressure on the taifa regimes, inducing more frequent and larger paria payments and increasing the likelihood of successful conquest. In the meantime, as a significant by-product, these territorial gains could assist rulers in Catalonia with their ongoing political challenges by shifting the frontier line and thereby distancing the castral lordships held by rebellious warlords from Muslim territories. As he was still attempting to surmount these challenges to his authority, in 1050, Ramon Berenguer I sought to accomplish these intertwined objectives via an agreement with his brother-in-law Berenguer, viscount of Narbonne. In an effort to prevent Mir Geribert from spreading his rebellious activity beyond the Penedès into the no-man’s-land to the west of Tarragona (now known as the Camp de Tarragona), Ramon isolated Tarragona jurisdictionally, and further broadcast his claim to it, by refashioning its territory as a county. The agreement stipulated that Berenguer would mount the city’s capture, reside there for a minimum of ten years,\n\n28 PA RT\n\nI . I N T E R A C T I O N A N D CO N Q U EST\n\nprovide naval support, manage defense and launch further attacks against the Muslims “in Ispaniam” from its castle, and render all but a portion of any parias he received in the meantime to the count of Barcelona.70 Aside from establishing the tradition of jurisdictional separation that would culminate in the papal enfeoffment of Tarragona as a principality to the Norman Robert Burdet in 1129, this agreement demonstrates how the count of Barcelona sought to form an alliance with new noble agents in opposition to his entrenched and rebellious frontier castellans.71 Although this particular project never developed past the planning stage, it nevertheless continued to cast a shadow over subsequent dealmaking by the count. In 1060, for instance, Ramon Berenguer and Countess Almodis invested Bernat Amat de Claramunt, who had formerly served her as ambassador to Muslim Dénia, with the castles of Tamarit and Ullastrell with the understanding that he would use these positions to occupy and populate Tarragona as titular viscount of the city.72 There are no indications that either of these initiatives ever developed into campaigns targeting Tarragona. Yet, throughout the remainder of his reign, Ramon Berenguer nevertheless continued to strive to maintain a strong claim to the city and its surrounding county, which extended all the way to the Ebro River delta, in part by maintaining tight control over the most important frontier castles along the borders of the counties of Barcelona and Osona. He did not acquire all of these positions by force. In some cases, he had invested political capital or precious monetary resources to gain control, as when he took advantage of Ermengol III of Urgell’s financial need and loaned him one thousand gold mancus in return for control of his castle of Toló, located to the northeast of Balaguer.73 As evidenced by his will from 1076, Ramon Berenguer advanced broad claims to territories and castles across the southern and eastern borderlands toward the limits of Aragon and Urgell. He did this calculatingly, if unrealistically, to maintain a foothold for future territorial expansion and a claim to parias in these areas in the face of competing claims and military activity by other rulers. Ramon Berenguer also claimed all parias from Spain for himself and his sons, rights to Menorca (which he had asserted rights to since his expedition in 1058), the most important castles of Osona, and all of the castles leading up to Monzón.74 Although they did not similarly make such sweeping general claims to Andalusi tribute, Ramon Berenguer II and Berenguer Ramon II did enumerate all of the parias they aspired to collect in an agreement with Ermengol III from the late 1070s. In addition to the tribute their father had habitually obtained from Lleida, Tortosa, and Zaragoza, they listed specific monetary goals for the parias from Murcia, Valencia, Dénia, and Granada.\n\nPA R I A S A N D C H U R C H ES A LO N G T H E 1 1 T H - CE N T U R Y F R O N T I E R 29\n\nThey enlisted the count of Urgell to assist them in establishing or growing these payments, and in particular winning the war against Zaragoza in order to reestablish its tributary status, in return for a hefty one-third share plus an advance payment of 15,000 mancus.75\n\nEconomic Effects of the Frontier Purely through the lens of the political development of the counties of Catalonia in the eleventh century, then, we can recognize the clear importance of the presence of neighboring Islamic states.76 Other types of interaction, including cultural contacts and the transmission of learning and technology, were also of course notable and vital. It is worth considering in greater detail how the economic influences of the frontier on the neighboring Christian-ruled principalities during this period served as conduits or facilitators for these other modes of interchange. The opportunities for land accumulation, parias, and trade could fluctuate dramatically and had the potential to stabilize as well as disrupt. Yet both Christian and Muslim rulers had little choice but to seek to control them to their respective benefits. The economic development of these Christian territories was equally tied to the frontier with Islam, yet in a more sophisticated manner than simply a one-way transmission of tribute.77 During the eleventh and twelfth centuries, much of the gold received by Christian states passed back into al-Andalus as Christian traders used it to buy a range of Andalusi goods.78 Moreover, even before parias became regularized into annual payments, gold and moveable property flowed into Christendom as conquest booty. Tellingly, around 1018, the county of Barcelona became the first principality within all of Europe to issue gold coinage since the Merovingians.79 Landed frontiers with al-Andalus may have been chiefly a local concern, but the trade that penetrated them arguably had far-reaching, extralocal implications. Rulers on either side of the frontier adopted varying policies regulating these sorts of routine, quotidian economic interactions. In 1069, for example, Sancho IV of Pamplona (r. 1054–76) established a treaty with al-Muqtadir of Zaragoza in which the rulers agreed to collaborate to keep the roads between their kingdoms “secure and safe, so that no impediment or harm come to any [of the people] who travel along them.”80 Evidence of tolls collected on overland trade across Muslim-Christian borders, particularly in the western kingdoms, furthermore, suggests that many Christian rulers were aware of this interaction and sought to take advantage of it.81 Arabic terms for weights and measures came into dominant use in the Christian principalities across the Iberian Peninsula, attesting to the great importance of\n\n30 PA RT\n\nI . I N T E R A C T I O N A N D CO N Q U EST\n\nadapting to be compatible with the Muslim trading world.82 Andalusi coins and goods circulated as far as northern Europe, via both land and sea routes. Genoese merchants, in particular, developed a thriving sea trade throughout the Christian and Muslim Mediterranean, including the Iberian Peninsula, and signed numerous treaties ensuring and protecting their involvement in Islamic trade.83 Not only gold and goods, but also slaves, Muslim and Christian, variously passed across the frontier, seized by raiders and conquerors, with notable infiltration throughout European societies.84 In other instances, however, certain rulers outlawed such economic engagement outright. The Usatges de Barcelona, for instance, which developed over the course of many years and were ultimately compiled in the twelfth century, deemed Christian trading with the taifa states to be dangerous and treasonous and prescribed considerable fines for Christians who sold food, weapons, or information to the Muslim states.85\n\nPapal Influence on Frontier Dynamics This strict opposition to Christian–Muslim interaction in the Usatges may have had more to do with the military objectives of the count-prince of Barcelona when the codification was compiled in the mid-twelfth century.86 Nevertheless, the increased intervention of extralocal church leaders into the Iberian political landscape also exerted an influence over policy-making regarding these sorts of interactions between Christian and Muslim principalities. These authorities did their utmost to direct the attention of lay rulers to a series of ecclesiastical objectives, the most important of which was the push to regain control of putative diocesan territory that remained under Muslim control. As a means of pursuing these goals, numerous successive popes worked to develop relationships with various noble, comital, and royal factions within the northeastern Peninsula over the second half of the eleventh century.87 Concurrently, they and their supporters developed papally centered religious justifications of expansion into formerly Christian territories occupied by Muslims.88 Papal correspondence with Aragon from the reign of Sancho Ramírez (r. 1063–94) onward dedicated special attention to territorial conquest and ecclesiastical restoration along and around the central Ebro River valley, to the south of Aragonese territory.89 Various popes hailed the kingdom as the preeminent champion of Christian expansion in eastern Iberia.90 Aragon would continue to enjoy this preferential status as it dominated the race for territorial acquisition in the lower Ebro region until its assumption by the house of Barcelona in 1137. Sancho Ramírez and his successors, Pedro\n\nPA R I A S A N D C H U R C H ES A LO N G T H E 1 1 T H - CE N T U R Y F R O N T I E R 31\n\n(r. 1094–1104) and Alfonso (r. 1104–34), empowered their political aspirations to acquire Muslim territory, and thereby enrich and strengthen their kingdom, by linking them to these ecclesiastical goals. Adherence to the ecclesiastical message would earn them powerful papal advocacy and a strategic moral advantage over their rivals. Such papal influence may have been responsible for the notable shift in official documentation of this period from raw descriptions of raiding and conquering to an image of a Christian struggle to restore the Muslim-dominated Christian ecclesiastical institutions and free the captive and suffering Mozarabs.91 The papacy, in turn, seems to have allowed its influence to be utilized by these rulers in order to increase its authority within the Peninsula. By establishing such rulers as dependents, these popes could more effectively further their reform agenda and shape the course of ecclesiastical restoration throughout Iberia.92 Further strengthening this alliance, Sancho Ramírez forged a new dependent relationship with the papacy as he guided his kingdom into a more expansionist phase.93 In 1068, this king traveled to Rome, where he attended the Holy Week celebrations in the company of Alexander II.94 At the end of his visit, he formally placed himself and his kingdom under God’s protection and into the hands of Saint Peter. With this commitment, he also promised to pay the Apostolic see an annual tribute of five hundred mancus.95 We lack sufficient evidence to reconstruct fully Sancho Ramírez’s motivations for agreeing to establish this papal suzerainty over his kingdom in this way.96 As I. S. Robinson has noted, the relationship between kings like Sancho and Saint Peter may have seemed less overtly threatening because, according to the very words of these transactions, it involved not simply feudal subordination but rather “protection”: patrocinium, protectio, defensio, tuitio, tutela. In this respect, such papal suzerainty was “developed by analogy with the protection which the vicar of St Peter had accorded since the mid-ninth century to religious houses.”97 Although the ceremonies and ritual performed during Sancho’s visit to the papacy established a fitting religious element to the bond, circumstantial evidence suggests that certain recent developments along his kingdom’s boundaries with Muslim territory could have made Sancho feel politically vulnerable and in need of papal support to defend his interests against competitors. In 1064, Count Ermengol III of Urgell had launched a formidable campaign that utilized a contingent of northern knights and succeeded in temporarily capturing Barbastro, a Muslim town that had long sat within Aragon’s sphere of influence.98 The Barbastro campaign has become the subject of considerable controversy. Scholars disagree over the implications of this involvement by northern knights as well as whether the papacy, in\n\n32 PA RT\n\nI . I N T E R A C T I O N A N D CO N Q U EST\n\nfact, promoted the effort, which would have implications for Barbastro’s place in the history of crusading within Iberia.99 Whereas there are clear signs that Norman fighters did indeed support the campaign, there are no indications that Aragonese forces participated.100 The Muslims of Barbastro quickly regrouped and launched a counterattack that cost Ermengol his life and drove the Christian occupiers from the town. In the aftermath, Sancho Ramírez had reason to be concerned about the implications of this failed attempt. Even though Urgell’s victory had been fleeting and Ermengol’s death had subsequently destabilized his county, his victory and heroic martyrdom helped establish Urgell’s independent claims to conquering Barbastro and neighboring targets in the future, especially since Aragon had not involved itself in the campaign. The victory, however momentary, also served to cement the reputation of Ermengol’s dynasty as containing serious contenders for Muslim territory and committed supporters of the church’s cause. Given these developments, by subjugating himself and his kingdom to the papacy in this dramatic, ritualized fashion, Sancho Ramírez implicitly challenged any claim the counts of Urgell or other rivals could make that their expansionism aligned so closely with the goals of the church.101 Throughout the remainder of Sancho’s rule and the reigns of his successors, the kingdom of Aragon maintained this symbolic subordination to papal lordship, receiving apostolic favor and protection in return.102 As scholars widely recognize, the practice of submitting to papal lordship had become well established for ecclesiastical institutions since the early days of Cluny and would continue to be useful for certain religious orders troubled by property ownership.103 It is likely that, for the kings of Aragon, as had been the case for Cluny, the symbolic submission of his lands and titles to a distant papal authority was a price worth paying in return for the acquisition of a potent ally who claimed to exercise eminent domain over the Peninsula’s Muslim-ruled territories. It is clear from royal diplomas issued during this period that Sancho drew his sense of regnal legitimacy from his descent from his grandfather, Sancho III, and from the fact that, modeling himself after his namesake and the Old Testament exemplars of David and Solomon as warrior-kings, he expelled the Muslims from his lands. He underscored this feat as the primary factor in fueling his ascent to the apex of his power.104 Such a conception of his rulership stood to benefit greatly from a papal alliance because his subordination to apostolic authority would reinforce his identity as a Christian warrior. Such submission was not without danger for the Aragonese monarchy, however. Even though Ramírez’s regnal ideology was self-contained in that it was based on his dynastic ancestry, infeudation to the papacy carried with it significant\n\nPA R I A S A N D C H U R C H ES A LO N G T H E 1 1 T H - CE N T U R Y F R O N T I E R 33\n\nreligious and political liabilities. The papacy, much to the annoyance of subsequent monarchs, would increasingly exploit these vulnerabilities over the coming decades. Although Aragon was the first Iberian principality to submit to papal lordship, other rulers in the northeastern Peninsula soon followed its example, thus reducing to some degree the potency of its precocious designation as papal feudatory. According to Paul Kehr, the biggest threat to Aragon’s special status arguably came from Castile, with Catalonia assuming a secondary position.105 In any case, successive popes increasingly viewed papal suzerainty as normative, and under Gregory VII and Urban II, papal pressure on rulers to follow suit mounted to unprecedented levels. As an archdeacon, Hildebrand had been instrumental in shaping the policies of Alexander II and may have helped concoct the very concept of Aragon’s enfeoffment.106 Hildebrand certainly had a hand in implementing major changes concerning the Roman rite in Aragon that took place in 1071, before the commencement of his pontificate.107 After he was elected as Gregory VII (1073–85), his views became increasingly colored by the escalating Investiture Controversy to the north.108 He likely saw the vague arrangement with Aragon, and his success in establishing the Roman rite there, as an opportunity to assert a canonical degree of papal authority over the whole of the Iberian Peninsula, especially given the apparent resistance to the Roman rite in various Castilian and Leonese monasteries and churches during these years.109 While asserting papal administrative authority over ecclesiastical requirements, Gregory VII also worked to craft a firmer canonical foundation upon which he could fashion a more expansive interpretation of papal suzerainty.110 In a letter to the “Christian princes of Spain” in 1073, he referenced the “well-known” fact that all the land and honores of the ancient kingdom of Spain, occupied by the Muslims, pertained to the Apostolic see.111 Since royal authority in Iberia, from Gregory’s perspective, was therefore wholly dependent on papal donation, enfeoffments of Iberian principalities to the papacy rightly reaffirmed the supremacy of papal spiritual and temporal power. Even though their lands contained bishops who were amenable to increased papal involvement, rulers in Catalonia tended to enter into or renew dependent relationships with the papacy with caution and careful calculus. The marginalized counts of Besalú, for instance, submitted to papal suzerainty in 1077 only after they could muster no further delays.112 At that time, Besalú’s more formidable neighbors were threatening its independent status, which it had enjoyed since the late ninth century. Papal suzerainty, however, could not prevent Besalú’s eventually subjugation to the county of Barcelona after Ramon Berenguer III of Barcelona married off his eldest\n\n34 PA RT\n\nI . I N T E R A C T I O N A N D CO N Q U EST\n\ndaughter, in 1107, to Count Bernat III of Besalú, who died just three years later.113 Berenguer Ramon II of Barcelona similarly found himself in a compromised position. He was delegitimized by his alleged murder of his twin brother and coruler, Ramon Berenguer II, and eventually reduced to serving this brother’s heir, the young Ramon Berenguer III.114 As discussed earlier, Rodrigo Díaz had routed and captured Berenguer Ramon II at Tévar and then ransomed him for an enormous sum. This ransom was not the most damaging aspect of this defeat for Barcelona, however. It also cost Berenguer Ramon II the parias of Lleida, Tortosa, and Zaragoza and effectively ended any lingering hopes he may have had of capturing the taifa of Valencia.115 With the restoration of Tarragona not yet approved by the papacy, the risk was now even higher that Alfonso VI of Castile-León might try to assert control over the restoration as well as potentially impose on Ramon Berenguer III during his minority.116 If the challenges facing Berenguer Ramon were not enough to motivate him to emulate these other principalities and submit to the papacy, he may also have reasoned that increasing Urban II’s involvement would accelerate this pope’s approval of Catalonia’s ecclesiastical restoration plan. Indeed, it seems likel"
