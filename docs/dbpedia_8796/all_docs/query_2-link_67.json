        "text": "E-Book Overview\n\n“How could I allow my soldiers to sail on this disloyal and cruel sea?” These words, attributed to the most powerful caliph of medieval Islam, Umar Ibn al-Khattab (634–644), have led to a misunderstanding in the West about the importance of the Mediterranean to early Islam. This body of water, known in Late Antiquity as the Sea of the Romans, was critical to establishing the kingdom of the caliphs and for introducing the new religion to Europe and Africa. Over time, it also became a pathway to commercial and political dominion, indispensable to the prosperity and influence of the Islamic world. Sea of the Caliphs returns Muslim sailors to their place of prominence in the history of the Islamic caliphate.\n\nAs early as the seventh century, Muslim sailors competed with Greek and Latin seamen for control of this far-flung route of passage. Christophe Picard recreates these adventures as they were communicated to admiring Muslims by their rulers. After the Arab conquest of southern Europe and North Africa, Muslims began to speak of the Mediterranean in their strategic visions, business practices, and notions of nature and the state. Jurists and ideologues conceived of the sea as a conduit for jihad, even as Muslims’ maritime trade with Latin, Byzantine, and Berber societies increased.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, Christian powers took over Mediterranean trade routes, but by that time a Muslim identity that operated both within and in opposition to Europe had been shaped by encounters across the sea of the caliphs.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nSEA OF THE CALIPHS\n\nSEA OF THE CALIPHS The Mediterranean in the Medieval Islamic World\n\nCHRISTOPHE PICARD Translated by Nicholas Elliott\n\nas zx\n\nTHE BELKNAP PRESS OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS Cambridge, Mas­sa­chu­setts ​London, ­England 2018\n\nCopyright © 2018 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College All rights reserved Printed in the United States of Amer­i­ca First printing This book was originally published in French as La mer des califes: Une histoire de la Méditerranée musulmane, VIIe–­XIIe siècle, ­copyright © Editions du Seuil, 2015.

Indeed, when Fernand Braudel opened his classic study of the Mediterranean by declaring, “I have loved the Mediterranean with passion,” he was not thinking of a Christian and Muslim sea but rather of that of the Latin merchants responsible for capitalism’s first stirrings.1 Braudel recognized Islam as one of the ­great Mediterranean civilizations but saw it as only a minor player in the maritime and economic development of the M ­ iddle Ages. In his wake, histories of the medieval Mediterranean have pushed Islam’s sailors into the background, generally\n\n2\n\nI ntroduction\n\nrelegating them to the status of pirates. Beginning with the scholarly works of Henri Pirenne, the Arab conquest (634–732) was held responsible for the crisis of the Roman Mare Nostrum triggered by the plague in the m ­ iddle of the sixth c­ entury. According to Pirenne and t­hose who followed, Muslim expansion resulted in a long economic, demographic, and cultural depression in the Mediterranean basin, sustained by the permanent war between Muslims and Christians.2 Only the ­great tenth ­century stood out as the moment when the Muslim world flourished in the Mediterranean: taking advantage of the effects of economic recovery, the two Mediterranean caliphates of the Umayyads (931–1031) and the Fatimids (909–1171) successfully adapted the power, splendor, and glory of the Abbasid caliphate of Baghdad (749–1258) to the Islamic West, in order to compete for control of maritime space with the Macedonian emperors of Byzantium (867–1059). This ushered in the second period of the Mediterranean M ­ iddle Ages, beginning in the eleventh c­ entury, an era built on the foundations of Latin capitalism, which now allowed Italian, Provençal, and l­ater Catalan sailors to take over the maritime routes and markets of Byzantium and Islam. The Muslim period in the Mediterranean appeared to be over, at least ­until the rise of Ottoman power.3 According to this view of history, conquering Islam’s encounter with the maritime space coincides with the period of crisis. As for the Latin period, it is closely tied to the phase of economic expansion. The accepted version of the sea’s medieval history holds that before the tenth c­ entury, Muslim expansion on “the Sea of the Romans” (al-­ bahr al-­Rumi), as it was referred to by the Arabs, was limited to piracy; that only the Fatimids and the caliphs of Córdoba took the initiative of developing economic and military activity on the sea; and that, with the exception of the Almohad caliphs of Marrakech (1147–1269), Muslim authorities then turned away from a sea now dominated by the g­ reat Latin ports.4 This version of history has generally been elaborated from a chronology imposed by the legacy of historical works on the Latin world, whose tools of evaluation w ­ ere ­those of economic mea­sure­ment, based on figures totally deficient before the eleventh c­ entury. Above all ­else, the first medieval period was one that lacked documentary resources and has largely remained so: the economic situation was not\n\nI ntroduction\n\n3\n\nbad, but it was initially impalpable, at least ­until the active, complex, and varied world that existed before the tenth ­century was revealed by archeologists ranging from Peter Brown to Chris Wickham, then historians of the medieval Latin world, and more recently t­ hose of Byzantium and Islam.5 This is how the Muslim pirate came into existence in the annals of Greek and Latin monks, for the victims ­were the only ones to bear witness to his assaults on Christian coasts. He is pres­ent in most histories of the Mediterranean, up to and including t­ hose of the pres­ent day.6 Yet, at the same time, a succession of leading works, starting in the period of the remarkable German school in the late nineteenth ­century and extending to significant texts such as Shlomo Goitein’s A Mediterranean Society (1967), reinforced new convictions that Islam held an undeniable place in the historical construction of a medieval Mediterranean Sea that was shared, multiple, and complex.7 The two half millennia a­ fter the fall of Rome and before the discovery of Amer­i­ca and the ­Battle of Lepanto (1571) cannot be separated, for they ­were both medieval: the rupture that was originally perceived between the High M ­ iddle Ages and the time of Latin expansion has been replaced by an infinitely more complex cycle that dismisses any evaluation opposing the two medieval periods. It is equally impossible to partition the medieval Mediterranean into religions, dynasties, naval powers, and especially socie­ties, as defined by Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, and this despite the po­liti­cal and religious divisions and the effects of a specific environment on the molding of the Mediterranean man dear to Braudel: due to the constant relations between the Byzantine, Latin, and Muslim worlds, the sea remains a central space, both separating and connecting the three imperial areas as of the seventh ­century.8 It is also impossible to interpret the medieval Mediterranean without taking into account three continents and two oceans. The ­Middle Ages saw the opening of the Mediterranean to a larger world—­the Sahara, continental Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the areas of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. Islam contributed significantly to this phenomenon. It was in Baghdad and Iran that the Mediterranean was first described in Arabic, far from the shores of the Sea of Rum, as the Byzantine Mediterranean was known.\n\n4\n\nI ntroduction\n\nThe most difficult challenge for ­t hose interested in the Mediterranean as seen from the Islamic world is in accessing information on the sea from the initial centuries, ranging from the Hegira in 622 to the ­middle of the ninth ­century. Aside from two chronicles by the Andalusian Ibn Habib (d. 854) and the Egyptian Ibn ‘Abd al-­Hakam (d. 871), both of which have l­ ittle to say about maritime activity, the first Muslim and Mediterranean accounts of Islamic maritime pursuits come from the capitals of the Fatimid and Umayyad caliphates. To make m ­ atters more complicated, like the Iraqi men of letters before them, the Mediterranean chroniclers rewrote the history of the Islamic times that preceded their own at the request of the tenth-­century caliphs, specifically concentrating on the areas governed by the two sovereignties, using previous versions that ­were then eliminated.9 The chroniclers of both Mediterranean caliphates w ­ ere very effective in shaping the timing of the Muslim occupation of the Mediterranean for posterity: according to them, the Muslim “pirate,” left to himself, prospered in the ninth ­century and dis­appeared ­under the two caliphates, to be replaced by sailors enlisted on the ships of the Commander of the Faithful. ­After the twelfth ­century, the caliph’s sailor was once again said to dis­appear from the history of the Mediterranean, this time due to the Latins. Venice, Pisa, and Genoa gradually chased the “Moorish and Saracen pirates” out of Mediterranean w ­ aters and imposed their remarkable naval and commercial organ­ization throughout the entire Mediterranean world. Joined by the Catalans, they developed the practice of international trade with the Byzantines and Muslims and by the thirteenth c­ entury had secured a mono­poly on maritime trade, at the expense of Islamic and Greek sailors. At this stage, Muslim and Christian piracy no longer appears in Mediterranean sources, as it ­were, outside of minor pieces of news. A dif­fer­ent history of the Mediterranean is imposed, s­ haped by Latin endeavors and most often relegating Byzantium and Islam’s role on the sea to a passive one or that of a victim, particularly in questions of trade. Since the publication of the works of Braudel and his disciple Maurice Lombard, who returned the Muslim Mediterranean to a central place, the region’s history has enjoyed an intense historiographic decompartmentalization, which has modified approaches to a history of\n\nI ntroduction\n\n5\n\nthe Mediterranean now told in three voices: Latin, Greek, and Arabic. ­Going beyond the monographs on Italian and Catalonian trading cities and the many scholarly works on their commercial networks, studies of the merchants of Muslim countries and Byzantium have allowed history to reveal an economic and, more specifically, commercial world that is far from limited to the major Italian networks.10 Over the last half a ­century, the study of the lands bordering the sea in the first centuries of the ­Middle Ages has opened the door to a far dif­fer­ent approach to the Mediterranean context.11 Archeologists are now finding traces of ­human settlements from e­ very period of the High ­Middle Ages on a significant proportion of the Mediterranean’s shores. There are signs of uninterrupted h ­ uman activity, including during the worst periods of plague and war. At the same time, the diversity of scenarios revealed by excavations invalidates the idea of the development of an economic situation mea­sured on the scale of the Mediterranean, replacing it with regional, urban, and village contexts. In fact, ­there can no longer be any question of a lasting economic crisis said to have affected the entire Mediterranean from the sixth to the ninth centuries.12 While ­there are numerous references to crises and catastrophes, ­these have an uneven impact on cities and rural areas across the region and at dif­f er­ent times. The fragmented periods and spaces of crisis brought to light by numerous archeological digs dismiss the argument carefully elaborated by Pirenne. The focus on social changes connected to a state of lasting conflict or the crisis arising from the breakdown of power, particularly in Italy in the ninth to eleventh centuries, has shown that war was no longer the area’s sole agent of destruction and crisis. The change in the status of populations and the social reor­ga­ni­za­tion driven by the new forces resulting from the collapse of earlier states, adapted to economic conditions and leading to the disappearance of slavery and serfdom in the countryside, are now considered the principal catalysts of a restructuring of rural socie­ties and landscapes, as seen with the incastellamento in Latium. In the tenth c­ entury, a new hierarchization of elites benefited local aristocracies born of the former Carolingian and Lombardian structures. Thus the permanence of the Muslim threat to Christian shores no longer appears as the principal reason for regional developments, outside\n\n6\n\nI ntroduction\n\nof isolated instances.13 In addition, accounts showing that commercial navigation was maintained all along Mediterranean shores throughout the High M ­ iddle Ages, and, particularly, during and ­after the Arab conquest from the seventh to the ninth centuries, suggest that activity on the sea was not limited to the misdeeds of Moorish and Saracen piracy. Yet no serious speculation is pos­si­ble at this stage. At the same time, the foundations for this regionalized history remain fragile insofar as sources are rare and nearly exclusively come from palace circles or the spheres of the military, merchant, judicial, or ecclesiastical aristocracy. Despite the fact that archeologists have allowed us to penetrate deeper and deeper into the private world of e­ very kind of medieval home, Horden and Purcell argue that this narrow perspective deprives us of direct access to the history of the vast majority of Mediterranean socie­ties, which w ­ ere incontestably the prime actors of the Mediterranean’s development, at least before the tenth c­ entury.14 The two En­glish historians, who seek to break down the barriers of Mediterranean history and get outside the restrictive context of leadership circles, are no dif­fer­ent from Braudel in putting aside the part played by the ­people of the Islamic world in building and developing the medieval Mediterranean, despite the commentary provided by two leading sources on Islam, the letters of Jewish merchants discovered in Cairo and the Arabic geography text by al-­Muqaddasi (d. ca. 1000), a native of Jerusalem.15 The collection of thousands of letters written by Jewish merchants discovered in the Geniza—­t he storeroom for writings containing the name of God—in the Ben Ezra Synagogue in Cairo shows that the Muslim world’s written sources do not exclusively come from chancelleries and judicial circles. Nonetheless, Goitein’s remarkable study emphasizes the exceptional nature of ­these documents in the context of the written production of medieval Islamic cultures, despite the fact that other stores of letters by merchants have been found on the shores of the Red Sea.16 Al-­Muqaddasi’s passages devoted to the Beqaa valley in the mountains of Lebanon detail a land admirably put to use by the low mountainous region’s rural communities, though this is not the geographer’s aim, other than to associate the region’s prosperity with good government by the Fatimids. The geographer traveled the world as a\n\nI ntroduction\n\n7\n\npurported Ismailist missionary, but he kept his mind open to any display of Muslim superiority: “The depiction of the world is limited to Islam, even more strictly than with the pre­de­ces­sors.”17 This description fits into the unique framework of the Mamlakat al-­Islam, the Islamic empire. Al-­Muqaddasi described and hierarchized the dif­fer­ent parts of the empire that he visited, particularly ­those east of the Mediterranean; like his fellow geographers, he provides a report on the state of the Muslim world, which includes the Muslim Mediterranean—in this case, that of the Fatimids. Its stated prosperity is the proof of good government, but it does not yield a picture of the agrarian society’s structure or of the connections between communities too conventional to be used by a historian seeking to make an economic and social assessment of the region.18 Before we ask Horden and Purcell’s question, “What is the Mediterranean?” we should perhaps first ask ourselves which Mediterranean and what history of the Mediterranean writers and geographers of the time wanted to leave to posterity, as well as for whom their descriptions of the territories of Islam ­were intended. Regarding Islam, the answer is provided by André Miquel: “Arab geography is the ­daughter of the caliphate of Baghdad,” and it “is primarily interested in the role and place, in the world, of the new man created by Islam,” specifically as it applies to the po­liti­cal and religious context and above all ­else to the demonstration of the legitimacy of the universal caliphate, in this case the Fatimid.19 The Arab scriptural environment had a major impact on the types of documents and content produced by Islam’s men of letters. Our perception of the maritime socie­ties of the Islamic coastline is therefore affected by the knowledge that the fleets presented in Christian sources as belonging to pirates—­a term justified on the part of the victims—­were, in the minds of Muslims, squadrons ­under ­orders from the Muslim sovereign to conquer or weaken Christian infidels. ­These “pirates” lived off privateering, most often ­under the control of the state, but also from trade, which was active along Muslim shores and, more often than has been acknowledged, all the way to Christian coasts, where Muslim merchants w ­ ere heartily welcomed by the Greeks and Latins during periods of truce. Th ­ ese sailors, seen by Muslim authorities as\n\n8\n\nI ntroduction\n\ndefenders and conquerors for Islam and remunerated for their booty, ­were recognized as pious and worthy men for having pillaged infidel monasteries and shores that had to be depopulated to stock the palaces with slaves. In the same spirit, the Mediterranean described by al-­Muqaddasi appears ­either as a Roman sea, and consequently as a space to be conquered, or as an Islamic sea, generous and open. The geographer was himself indebted to the way the caliphal chancelleries had imposed a view of the Mediterranean developed “­under ­orders from the Caliph,” beginning in the earliest times of the Abbasids.20 What­ever scenarios one adheres to regarding the formation and development of a po­liti­cally divided medieval Mediterranean in a permanent state of war, the populations that appear in the documentation left by the three empires are not ones that w ­ ere allegedly ruined by the plague and raids of the High ­Middles Ages ­until the maritime and merchant Latin powers took over the now-­prosperous area. Looked at as a ­whole, t­ hese sources offer another version of the Mediterranean’s development: for all the regions, the men of letters more often describe socie­ ties increasingly well adapted to mutations, beginning with the crisis of the sixth ­century and related to permanent confrontation on the vast land and sea frontier. This socioeconomic context, often idealized by administrators and religious men, does not provide an overview of Christian or Muslim society, let alone a comprehensive picture, but it does occasionally allow one to understand how ­these hardworking populations adapted to constantly changing worlds. The texts written by the first generation of Muslim men of letters ­were the fruit of a civilization that was not seeking to turn the Mediterranean Sea into a new Mare Nostrum but rather intended to cross it to impose Islam on the Eu­ro­pean continent. ­These writings focused on the description of the state supervision of a coastal and maritime space that was constructed for defense but also to develop profitable activities. War is constantly pres­ent but appears as an essential instrument for the organ­ization of border regions, ­under the control of the Latin, Byzantine, and Muslim states, thus underlining the role played by ­t hose in power. As seen in the texts, the sea remained an affair of state throughout the M ­ iddle Ages.21 Perhaps the real medieval rupture, having started with the Italian city-­states in the twelfth ­century, began when the refer-\n\nI ntroduction\n\n9\n\nences to a military and imperial environment ­were replaced by ­those to the bankers and merchants who w ­ ere able to impose their “cap­i­tal­ist” ways on the church.22 While Arabs produced a tremendous quantity of writing, particularly beginning in the tenth ­century, across the entire vast Islamic area, very few of ­t hese texts concern ­actual maritime or trading activity on the Mediterranean. As for the archives assembled by the ­great Italian port cities of Pisa, Genoa, and Venice or kept by the Crown of Aragon, they do not contain the notarized agreements, ­wills, contracts, or other written documents that would allow us to delve into the closed circle of trade networks, notaries’ offices, and dockyards, let alone into the crews—­pirates or sailors of the caliph—on ships’ decks. Nearly all of the Arabic documents resulting from Muslim naval activities on the Mediterranean are by writers in princely entourages, all perfectly familiar with the ins and outs of Muslim palaces, but rarely with maritime techniques, in which they had no interest. In most cases, only the ­legal and fiscal perspective or military framework was of interest. With the exception of Sinbad the Sailor on the Indian Ocean and a few heroes who built their reputations by leading Muslim fleets to victory over Greek or Latin ships, Muslim seamen w ­ ere rarely popu­lar subjects, for the rec­ord of the construction of Mediterranean Islam was devoted to men of the caliph, emir, or sultan or to the circles of jurists and Sufi saints, countless figureheads who fill the many biographical volumes written by scholars. As for the Sea of the Romans, often referred to as such in Arabic sources, it remained a boundary first and foremost and thus a space over which was exercised the sovereignty of the Prophet’s successors. Unlike the lit­er­a­ture of the Indian Ocean, none of the available lit­er­ a­ture on the Mediterranean Sea originates from the world of sailors, with the exception of indirect references via jurists or employees of the sultans’ administrations. Documents on the sea, the navy, and sailors ­were indeed written or drawn by and for seafarers, at least since the tenth ­century on the Mediterranean, but all that survives is the production of Arab geographers and encyclopedists who took this prose and removed technical details considered useless to produce a literary work for a general audience, intended to be read in the lounges of the capital\n\n10\n\nI ntroduction\n\nand leading cities of Islam. The sorting of copied texts led ­these same men of letters to remove from shelves and offices­works considered obsolete or unrelated to the definition of the standards of Islam. Muslims archived documents, but then they threw out parchments or used them to make palimpsests, washing the paper and erasing outdated text to use the paper for new text. More generally, a palace’s archival documents dis­appeared as soon as they ­were no longer useful or when the palace was destroyed or vacated by successors or usurpers who had a new residence built and amassed new archives, which w ­ ere equally perishable if they did not serve to prove or demonstrate the ruler’s legitimacy. Only t­ hose documents containing the name of God, like the letters in the Geniza, had to be preserved. Like all the information that would allow us to piece together the organ­ization of Muslim navies, ­orders regarding dockyards, crews, the requisition of supplies, and the recruiting of oarsmen—discovered “by chance” on Egyptian papyri dating from the beginning of the eighth ­century—­were kept only as long as they ­were useful.23 Does this indicate that Muslim sailors and merchants sailed and traded less than Latin sailors? Not at all. Muslim sailors certainly roamed wider than the Muslim documents suggest. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that Muslim “pirates” are known to have existed merely ­because Christian victims spoke of them, while the Muslim authorities did not deem it useful to rec­ord ­every one of the raids actually carried out by crews ­under ­orders from the caliph or the emir, which left the sailors and their actions to vanish into oblivion. Did the Muslims engage in less sea trade? Anyone who takes the time to read the Arab geographic and ­legal sources ­w ill see this is far from the case, and the discovery of the Geniza letters has shown that the Muslim world’s trade networks could be as structured as ­those of the ­great Latin ports. Most information on the sea is nearly entirely drawn from a chancellery lit­er­a­ture devoted to supporting the sovereigns. Even critical, in­ de­pen­dent minds such as al-­Muqaddasi could not avoid thinking and writing like men trained in the circles of scholars and administrators. However, this Arab geographer’s description of the Mediterranean reveals how well he knew that world and navigation. While most of his\n\nI ntroduction\n\n11\n\ninformation on the sea, fleets, sailors, and commerce was intended to advance the naval and trading policy of what­ever sovereign was in power, it also included references to many aspects of maritime life and revealed the extent of the Muslim occupation and exploitation of the sea and its riches, for sustenance and other uses. It even reveals the sea’s Islamic universality and humanity, as praised by the Almohad caliph ‘Abd al-­Mu’min in a speech to his officers in Marrakech.24 This brings us back to the question raised by Horden and Purcell and many other historians before them: What is the medieval Mediterranean? If we take into account the Arabic rec­ords of the time, it is not the sea of the Muslim pirate but rather the domain of the sailor, w ­ hether military or commercial, in the ser­vice of his own fortune and the caliph. The sailor competed for control of the Mediterranean with the Greek and Latin p ­ eoples and was honored for it, though not on the same level as the other heroes of Islam. We must give credit where credit is due: this period in history belongs first and foremost to the caliphs, buttressed by scholars and particularly jurists. According to the precept that it is the time of writing, rather than the time described in the writing, that marks the first historical time period, we must follow the pace set by the texts written for the caliphs. The first period to yield an Arabic description of the Mediterranean was that of the Abbasid caliphate, beginning in the ­middle of the ninth ­century. Recorded accounts come from oral and written traditions that reached the capitals and other cities of the Dar al-­Islam, or territory of Islam, through a series of transmitters and ­were passed down from the conquerors and t­ hose who succeeded them: nothing is in­ven­ted or supposed, subject to discredit, but the texts are s­ haped by the period during which they ­were rewritten. The use of ­these selected versions orients the narrative according to a logic that most often leads back to the Iraqi caliphs’ Mediterranean strategies. Beginning in the tenth c­ entury, the written production of the Mediterranean caliphal capitals in Córdoba, Kairouan, and Cairo rivaled that of Baghdad, at a time when the caliphs w ­ ere losing both a­ ctual power and prestige. The texts produced by the Andalusian (756–929) and Aghlabid (800–909) emirates ­were ­later ­adopted by writers working\n\n12\n\nI ntroduction\n\nfor caliphs in al-­Andalus and Ifriqiya, for the same reasons that the writings concerning the sovereigns of Iraq w ­ ere ­adopted. This caliphal production suffered the effects of time; only a very limited part of this lit­er­a­ture has reached us. Most of the Mediterranean production on the first centuries of Islam is found in the histories that proliferated in the major capitals from the eleventh ­century onward. We can therefore assert that it was the Eastern men of letters, from Iran to Egypt, who imposed the forms of so-­called classical Arabic lit­ er­a­ture. To a ­great extent, the outlines of the Mediterranean as depicted by Eastern men of letters are found in the geographic and historical descriptions of the scholars of the two Western caliphates in the tenth ­century, as well as in the Arabic descriptions and chronicles of the last centuries of the M ­ iddle Ages. However, both the Fatimids and the Umayyads imposed new outlines of their sea’s history and geography, geared to the new context and the sea’s importance in establishing their own legitimacy. The men of letters in the circles of the Almohad caliphs, the last sovereigns of the ­Middle Ages to conceive of the sea as a full-­ fledged Muslim imperial space, produced an even more voluminous lit­er­a­ture on the sea. At the same time, the features of this caliphal lit­er­a­ture of the Mediterranean had a profound impact on descriptions of the Sea of Rum, particularly in the Maghreb and Cairo, ­until the end of the ­Middle Ages. Though the Ottomans did not deny this past, it fell to them to impose their own view of the sea, as seen from the palace terraces of Istanbul ­after 1453. All the other Islamic powers that shared the shores of the Mediterranean, particularly the sultanates of Egypt, left traces of their own literary commitment. The sea holds a significant place throughout the extant texts and appears in ­every kind of Arabic written expression, as long as it is in the ser­vice of “imperial”—­and consequently restrictive—­promotion.25 It is through this construction of a Muslim and Arab world on the Mediterranean, mobilizing e­ very form of expression of the prolific Arabic lit­er­a­ture, that one can understand a profile of the Sea of the Romans as written by Arab writers, more rarely by Persian writers, beginning in the ninth ­century and continuing throughout the medieval period. The chronological framework we find ­here is primarily the one im-\n\nI ntroduction\n\n13\n\nposed by successive caliphates. Their repre­sen­ta­tions of the Mediterranean must therefore serve as a fundamental basis for the history of the Muslim Mediterranean: The Arab conquest of the sea and its shores from 634 to 749, led with an iron hand by the Rashidun caliphs of Medina (632–661), followed by the Umayyads, is only known to us through the Abbasid versions of the maritime region’s history and subsequent texts. Al-­Tabari’s history, completed around 915, was considered by his peers to be the greatest Arabic chronicle of all time.26 References to the expansion onto the sea and its shores beginning in 750 are limited in the sources produced in Baghdad and Samarra, but they are sufficient to observe the Iraqi caliphs’ constant interest in the Syrian coast and, additionally, in the maritime space of the Mediterranean as a w ­ hole. Rather than focusing on ­actual strategy, most references to the Mediterranean area in caliphal and ­legal lit­er­a­ture deal with the caliphs’ involvement on the Byzantine frontier in Anatolia from 754 to 945, to a lesser extent with military policy along the coasts of the Near East, and especially with the updating of jihad made necessary by the lasting stabilization of the fronts. Beginning in the ninth ­century, several dissident powers in the Muslim West took over from the Abbasids, drawing direct inspiration from the model of the caliphs. The Iraqi sovereigns thus imposed the practices of jihad, which ­were adapted to e­ very Mediterranean frontier ­until the end of the M ­ iddle Ages. The Mediterranean caliphates of the Fatimids and the Umayyads picked up where their pre­de­ces­sors left off. Their scribes took g­ reat care to describe involvement in the war against the Christians, particularly on the sea, in the context of a demonstration of their universal legitimacy on the path to seizing Baghdad. Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406) declared that this period was marked by Islam’s near total domination on the sea. However, the impact of the rivalry between the two Mediterranean caliphates on both caliphates’ maritime strategies extended far beyond the aspiration to conquer Iraq ­until al-­Mu‘izz (953–975) moved his dynasty to Egypt in 971. Once al-­Mu‘izz settled in Cairo, his policy evolved with the establishment of good relations—­primarily commercial—­with the Byzantines, then the Latins. Following the crisis that starved the Nile valley from 1065 to 1072 and during the time sailors from Pisa, Venice, and\n\n14\n\nI ntroduction\n\nGenoa ­were coming to trade in the Egyptian capital and Alexandria, the development of maritime and commercial activities on the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean allowed the Shiite sovereigns to reinforce their control over traffic between t­ hese two maritime regions. Beginning in the eleventh ­century, Latin offensives forced regional powers, and, in par­tic­u ­lar, the Almoravids of Marrakech (1072–1147), then the Almohad caliphate in the West and the Egyptian caliphs (971–1171) in the East (­until the loss of Ashkelon to the Crusaders in 1154) to maintain their military presence on the Mediterranean to deter attacks from the sea. The Berber caliphate was to be the last Muslim maritime power able to compete with the Latins. A ­ fter the defeat at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, the crises faced by the Almohad state beginning in 1215— and the maritime and commercial ventures of Latin ports—turned the Mediterranean into a Latin sea once and for all. In Egypt and Syria, neither the Ayyubids (1171–1250) nor the Mamluks (1250–1517) presented the navy as an emblem of their power, though they ­were able to fit out galleys when they needed to.27 Saladin (1171–1193) acknowledged that only the caliphs of the Maghreb could rival the Latin ­enemy on the w ­ ater.28 The Marinids (1258–1465) in Fez and the Hafsids (1229–1574) in Tunis paid sufficient attention to their fleets to mostly resist Christian pressure and maintain control of the Strait of Gibraltar, at least ­until the ­fourteenth c­ entury. Was this the end of the Muslim Mediterranean? Muslim sailors w ­ ere now only found in a few zones along the African coast and, beginning with the Turkish settlement of Anatolia in the eleventh ­century, the Asian coasts of the Sea of Marmara and soon the Dardanelles. U ­ ntil the sixteenth-­century exploits of Hayreddin Barbarossa (d. 1546), admiral of the Sublime Porte, and especially the Ottoman domination of the Mediterranean, as of the thirteenth ­century neither the caliph’s sailor nor the Moorish or Saracen pirate could claim to compete for the sea with the Latin world’s maritime forces, outside of carry­ing out a few raids that announced the return of the Muslim pirate.\n\nI THE ARAB MEDITERRANEAN BET WEEN R E P R E­S E N­T A­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\n1\n\nT H E A R A B D I SCOV E R Y O F T H E M E D I T E R R A N E A N as zx\n\nThe Mediterranean seems to have a very limited place in the history recorded by Arab men of letters in the first centuries of the Hegira.1 The two Mediterranean authors to have left Arabic chronicles before the tenth c­ entury, the Andalusian Ibn Habib and the Egyptian Ibn ‘Abd al-­Hakam, practically make no reference to the inland sea, other than to mention the crossing of the Strait of Gibraltar by Berber and Arab troops to invade Visigothic Spain.2 Before the prolific geographic production of the tenth c­ entury, the chroniclers and geographers of Baghdad seemed to want to cultivate the Mediterranean’s marginality, treating the sea and its shores in the same manner. From the earliest Abbasid rec­ord of the conquest, a reconstructed text by Sayf b. ‘Umar (d. 796), to the “books of conquest” of the late ninth ­century, ­little information appears regarding the Umayyads’ maritime activity; what traditions t­hese authors did collect are unclear.3 As for firsthand accounts of the Sea of the Romans, they are virtually limited to the Aphrodite papyri in Egypt.4 One has to wait u ­ ntil the end of the tenth ­century for the maritime and mercantile world of Mediterranean Islam to truly become vis­i­ble, thanks to the letters of Jewish merchants discovered in the Geniza of the synagogue in Fustat.5 In the same time period, the advent of the Fatimid and Umayyad caliphates in Kairouan\n\n18\n\nB E T W E E N R E P R E ­S E N ­T A ­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\nand Córdoba apparently broke Western Islam’s silence, with the Muslim Mediterranean becoming one of the most fertile centers of Arabic lit­er­ a­ture. The ­great Muslim capitals of the region now rivaled Baghdad and the large Asian cities of Islam that had previously monopolized the majority of Arabic production. Nonetheless, the texts by Muslim authorities offer the richest resources to understand the relationship of the first generations of believers to the Mediterranean: expeditions, treaties, the organ­ization of governments, and coastal defense are among the favorite subjects of the Arab chroniclers who reported the facts of the conquest. The first generation of Arab chroniclers to whose work we have access drew from the primitive Arab histories (akhbar), prob­ably produced at the time of the Marwanid caliphs (692–749) and themselves indebted to traditions that could date back to the second generation of Muslims.6 This work of collecting and writing texts, updated in accordance with caliphal affairs, came to an initial culmination with the historian al-­Tabari (d. 923).7 Having emerged in the ninth c­ entury from the offices of the Abbasid caliphate’s administration, cartography and descriptions of the world ­were also devoted to demonstrating the legitimacy of the Islamic religion and its guide, the caliph. Naturally, Baghdad was placed at the center of the ecumene. The capital’s prestige proved so durable that this choice would extend to the entire Islamic koine, no m ­ atter the period or place of production. This cartography of Islamic universalism led to an impressive series of maps and accompanying descriptions of the earth.8 Beginning with the first works of geography, the Mediterranean was logically included alongside the Indian Ocean and the Caspian Sea.9 The chronicles and geographic studies complement each other in providing a picture of Islam’s domination of the world, particularly ­under the pen of multifaceted authors such as the geographer and historian al-­Ya‘qubi (d. 897). It is hardly surprising to find that t­ hese documents offer a reconstruction of Arab history and the repre­sen­ta­tion of Islam, produced by men of letters in the ninth and tenth centuries a­ fter the sorting of previous histories geared to the periods of successive caliphates.10 In the Arabic texts describing the beginnings of Islam, the maritime space of the Mediterranean remains in the background, to the point\n\nT he A rab D iscovery of the M editerranean\n\n19\n\nthat one might think the caliphs, established in Iraq, had not had any reason to take a par­tic­u ­lar interest in the distant Sea of the Romans. Having given up on the conquest, the Baghdad caliphate had presumably left the sea to the Christians. In contrast, the Indian Ocean, which was described as a sea of sailors and merchants, would be seen as the Muslim maritime space par excellence, and was all the more familiar given that the Arabs of the Hejaz w ­ ere in the habit of roaming it long before the Hegira.11 As early as the ninth ­century, descriptions of the Indian Ocean could be found in the capital. The beginning of the narrative of Sinbad’s exploits in The Thousand and One Nights seems to confirm the mercantile atmosphere in major ports of Islam on the Arabian-­Persian Gulf such as Basra, at the mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates, in the ninth and tenth centuries: I collected the remains of my estate. I sold all the furnishings I had at auction in the market. I then fell in with some merchants who traded at sea. I consulted t­ hose who seemed able to give me good advice. Fi­nally, I resolved to make the most of the l­ittle money I had left and as soon as I had taken this resolution, I did not take long to execute it. I traveled to Basra, where I embarked with several merchants on a ship, sharing the expenses of fitting it out. We put out to sea and followed the East Indies route through the Persian Gulf.12\n\nDescriptions of the Indian Ocean, which began to appear in Iraq in the m ­ iddle of the ninth c­ entury, provide an idea of the role played by the trade networks that drove long-­distance maritime commerce beginning in the Abbasid period.13 Only the creation in Egypt of a Muslim naval force and a few specific military events such as the expeditions ­toward Cyprus in 645 and the naval victory over the Byzantines at the ­Battle of the Masts in 655 drew the attention of the writers in the caliph’s circle. Information on Muslim activity in the maritime space was exclusively focused on the ­legal conditions of relationships with islanders or, a­ fter negotiations, on their submission. Another area of special interest was the division of booty and its irregularities, which often led to a summons from the leader\n\n20\n\nB E T W E E N R E P R E ­S E N ­T A ­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\nmandated by the caliph. Indeed, the conditions of conquest and the status of conquerors and populations subjected to them ­were of direct interest to the sovereigns, insofar as the foundations of the government of the provinces, particularly in regard to taxation and land statutes, ­were set or justified by t­ hese agreements with the defeated and the conditions for the division of land and booty among the soldiers of the army (jund). The sea was a route for fleets; it was neither a space to be shared nor, strictly speaking, one to be governed. Consequently, the use of the maritime route, for instance to go attack Constantinople or ­enemy islands and shores, could hold the authorities’ attention, but most references to the maritime space concern the defense of the Dar al-­Islam’s coastlines from terra firma. The open sea is most often left aside. The history of the first believers on the sea and on its shores was therefore not distorted but rather exploited to explain and justify the caliphs’ policy, a policy that was legitimate as long as it was in keeping with what the companions of the Prophet, the first conquerors, had accomplished u ­ nder Muhammad’s guidance and then on the authority of the first caliphs, particularly ‘Umar b. al-­K hattab.14 The Abbasid historians’ Mediterranean was not a forgotten or rejected sea, but one that had become a specific space for war. The Mediterranean was also confusing compared to the Arabs’ sea of reference, the familiar Indian Ocean, which had been ­free of imperial enemies since the fall of the Sassanids in 652 and was now left to converted merchants. Curious about this Roman world, Arab geographers and encyclopedists took over the repre­sen­ta­tion of the spaces of the ecumene, naturally ­doing so in the ser­v ice of the caliph, at the very time when the Latins and the Greeks ­were forgetting the sea—­the latter beginning in the eighth c­ entury—­prob­ably to preserve the memory of the Mare Nostrum. The number of Arab descriptions and maps is unrivaled before the thirteenth ­century, particularly among the Christians.15 In the Latin world, travel narratives written by pilgrims abandoned any repre­sen­ta­ tion or description of the sea ­after the period of Orosius and Isidore of Seville and ­until the Crusades. The few accounts of travel to the Holy Land, such as the eighth-­century text by Willibald, remain focused on pilgrimage sites.16 During this period, repre­sen­ta­tions of the world w ­ ere 17 limited to a cartography that “iconizes space.”\n\nT he A rab D iscovery of the M editerranean\n\n21\n\nWithin the ­actual Dar al-­Islam, the appearance as of the tenth ­century of a geography composed by men of letters native to the Mediterranean, in Córdoba, Kairouan, and Cairo, was a turning point in that the sea now held a preeminent place in descriptions: as a favored space for the expansion of the two Western caliphates, both rivals of the Abbasids, it was now represented as the other central maritime realm of Muslim civilization, including trade activities and travel descriptions. The Book of Curiosities, a tenth-­or eleventh-­century cartographic manuscript, particularly its map of the Mediterranean, embody this readjustment of Arab geography’s focus ­toward the Mediterranean world, now on a par with the Indian Ocean, in the Umayyad and Fatimid periods.18 However, the geographers’ attention was primarily drawn to the regions bordering the sea, such as the Maghreb, which was described on behalf of the caliphate by the Andalusian geographer al-­Warraq in the tenth ­century. This description has partially reached us through the revised and updated version by the Andalusian geographer al-­Bakri (d. 1094). During the same period, the production of geography books, including maps and text, constantly enriched the libraries of Islam. New descriptive forms such as chapters and books devoted to “won­ders” (‘aja’ib), derived from narratives of the Sea of the Arabs, began to appear on the shores of the Muslim Mediterranean. At the end of the twelfth c­ entury, personal accounts by traveling men of letters, known as the rihla, supplanted caliphal works of geography as Islam lost all control over the maritime space in the face of the Latins’ unstoppable domination.19 However, during the same period, the commission received by geographer al-­Idrisi (d. ca. 1172) from Roger II of Sicily (1115– 1154) for a world map whose geographic center was not Sicily—­though the island does appear excessively enlarged—­but Baghdad proves the extent to which the Arab model of cartography and astronomic geography, born in Iraq, had become a universal standard.20 The proliferation of t­hese Arab repre­sen­ta­tions and descriptions of the world is not the only reason for an increasingly precise recognition of the Mediterranean space as mea­sured from the Islamic world. Arab encyclopedists and geographers, in both the East and the West, used a descriptive form—­masalik wa l-­mamalik, “roads and kingdoms”—to constantly update the situation of the world; their cartography was first\n\nT he A rab D iscovery of the M editerranean\n\n23\n\nand foremost a hymn inspired by the ancient geography that put Islam at the center of the world and thus above other imperial spaces in the hands of the infidel. By reporting situations witnessed by geographers, who w ­ ere nearly always also travelers, t­ hese accounts reveal constantly updated perceptions of the Mediterranean basin in an Islamic framework that remains connected with infidel spaces.21 Portraits of the earth, w ­ hether in part or in w ­ hole, are not limited to geography or to the Arabic language.22 They make up countless analytic pictures of the situation of the Islamic Mediterranean in the ­Middle Ages. Three of the most well-­k nown Arab men of letters ­will serve as our guides to summarize them. Indeed, the works of al-­Mas‘udi (d. 956), al-­Idrisi, and Ibn Khaldun reveal three Mediterranean seas at dif­fer­ent times, while conserving an identity stemming from the authors’ shared education, which dated back to history’s Iraqi roots.\n\nA GEOGR APHY OF TR AVEL\n\nMaritime experiences made a deep impression on the Eastern polymath al-­Mas‘udi, as he reports in The Meadows of Gold and The Book of Notification and Verification, both written shortly before the ­middle of the tenth ­century. A scholar “concerned, as we imagine him ­today, with completely pure knowledge and truth,” he also wanted to be a “pop­u­ lar­izer, driven his ­whole life by the desire to make his work accessible.”23 This precept is particularly applicable to his descriptions of the seas. More than a ­century ­after the beginning of the Arabic literary ferment born of the Abbasid environment, al-­Mas‘udi’s vision is certainly one of the most accomplished examples of the spirit of the travelers’ geography.\n\nThe world in The Book of Curiosities (Fatimid area, eleventh or twelfth c­ entury) The map is a repre­sen­ta­tion of all inhabited land areas, including the two seas that separated them, the Sea of the Arabs (Indian Ocean) and the Sea of Rum (Mediterranean).

This encyclopedic description of the world is presented as a digest of his lost monumental work, the Akhbar al-­Zaman (The history of time). The two surviving works by this prolific author ­were the last he wrote, and they sold very well from the time they ­were issued, which may explain why they are the only works of his to have survived.24 The method al-­Mas‘udi used to discuss the world and man was one employed since the ninth c­ entury by e­ very Baghdad man of letters steeped in the atmosphere of the adab, a literary current comparable to the spirit of the encyclopedic culture of the honnête homme—­the well-­ educated, nonspecialized man of the French seventeenth ­century. It relied above all ­else on quotations from the ancients.25 The first stage of al-­Mas‘udi’s work as a writer was to consult texts in the libraries of the capitals he visited, initially to gather the ancient wisdom the Arabs had considered worth preserving, in par­tic­u­lar that of the Greeks—­starting with Ptolemy—­who ­were considered the greatest experts on the sciences of the universe and the earth.26 At the same time, it had become indispensable for any geographer embarking on descriptive writing in the tenth ­century to roam the world, which in practice was limited to the Arab world. Al-­Mas‘udi’s two encyclopedias contain 165 discrete references to the sea. The many references taken from ancient works are reminiscent of the education of every­one of the ulema in the law and science of Muslim tradition (Hadith). ­These disciplines, fundamental to the believer, had produced a rigorous pro­cess (isnad) adapted to all fields of knowledge embraced in Baghdad. Citing one’s sources served as proof of the accuracy of one’s argument, ­unless one chose to contradict them by comparing them to information from more recent or reputedly more reliable texts. The rhe­toric of the adab was another methodology to distinguish The Mediterranean in The Book of Curiosities (Fatimid area, eleventh or twelfth ­century) The map shows the Mediterranean, with the islands (captioned circles) in the maritime space, without regard to their position, and the names of the ports around the shores.

The writer made par­tic­u ­lar use of personal interpretation and the controversy born of comparing contradictory opinions to draw out what became the “truth.” The other source of knowledge was the fruit of the writer’s own observations and the accounts he collected during his travels.27 ­These statements ­were considered reliable ­because the ­people the writer questioned ­were experienced sailors. Some are well known, like Leo of Tripoli, whom al-­Mas‘udi could not have met in person but who was famous enough that his opinions ­were passed down and collected by the polymath. Al-­Mas‘udi knew and deeply appreciated this maritime world; he sailed extensively, particularly on the Indian Ocean, but also on the Caspian Sea and the eastern Mediterranean. It is extremely unlikely, however, that his claim of having reached the China Sea is true. Given that a traveler’s direct observation was considered the most reliable source, al-­Mas‘udi did not hesitate to bolster his writing’s recognition by replacing his library research with a prob­ably fictitious journey beyond Sri Lanka.28 For example, he states, “I have sailed on many seas, the China Sea, the Mediterranean, the Caspian, the Red Sea, and the Sea of Yemen, I have run countless risks on them, but I know of none more dangerous than this Sea of Zanzibar of which we have just spoken.”29 The polymath borrowed the method used by his precursors, particularly al-­Ya‘qubi and Ibn al-­Faqih, both of whom died around 900. This was a method essentially characterized as “the very act of seeing.”30 The approach was closely tied to travel, which had become indispensable for the geographer to become personally aware of the realities he discovered on his travels. As an outgrowth of the pilgrimage to Mecca and the ninth-­century narratives of merchants on the Indian Ocean, travel had become a necessity to deliver a truth only accessible through investigation. Wandering was instructive and enabled the gathering of direct evidence, lending the description a hint of real­ity: “[The traveler] no longer proceeds by literary borrowing, but works from memory, based on the observations recorded during the journey.”31 The journey (rihla) was a preliminary stage that was practically indispensable for lending credibility to the opinions expressed. As one of the first representatives of this movement, Ibn al-­Faqih reminded the reader of the educational virtues of travel and its constraints in a chapter called “In Praise of Traveling\n\nT he A rab D iscovery of the M editerranean\n\n27\n\nAway from the Native Land”: “Ask for your daily bread by traveling far abroad, for while you w ­ ill not make much money, you w ­ ill acquire much reason.”32 Al-­Mas‘udi, who was himself a g­ reat traveler, perhaps as an Ismaili missionary and likely as a merchant, made this guideline his own: All the sailors who frequent ­t hese ­waters [take advantage of] winds of which they perfectly know the periods. Among them, this science is the fruit of habit and long experience, and they pass it on to each other through oral [teaching] and practice. They guide themselves based on certain indications and par­tic­ u­lar signs to recognize the period of agitation, the quiet times and ­t hose of excitement. What we say ­here about the Indian Ocean is also [true] of Roman and Muslim sailors who travel the Mediterranean and of the [seafarers] who cross the Caspian Sea [to go] from Khazaria to Gorgan, Tabaristan, and Daylam.33\n\nThe organ­ization of his work borrows that of the Baghdad chroniclers, which had become classic thanks to al-­Tabari’s History (915), and adapts it to the encyclopedic form. Al-­Mas‘udi identifies two major periods of Muslim history: the pre-­Islamic period and the period initiated by the Hegira. The first section includes a general description of the earth, the ecumene, and the seas. Additionally, one finds an explanation of the ebb and flow of the tides and remarkable facts about the maritime spaces. As set forth ­here, the time of Creation precedes the time of the prophecies, up to and including the last prophecy, the prophecy of Muhammad—­essential stages that had to be included in any encyclopedia. This part of the book covers the Greeks’ knowledge of astronomy, which was passed down by Arab translators, and that of the Persians.34 From libraries, Al-­Mas‘udi took the Arabic treatises that contained all the learning translated from ancient works. Similarly, he took an interest in the traditional tales of the earliest Arab era, ­whether moral or secular, and particularly the “won­ders,” without neglecting the knowledge accumulated by scholars. Accounts by renowned seafarers also allowed him to call into question certain assertions of the ancients, to which he preferred the experience\n\n28\n\nB E T W E E N R E P R E ­S E N ­T A ­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\nof Syrian sailors ­under Abbasid command, considering it more valuable than any book knowledge: I have noticed that the seafarers of Siraf and Oman . . . ​provide information about the Indian Ocean that is for the most part dif­fer­ent from what the phi­los­o­phers and other [scholars] say. . . . ​I have made the same observation in the Mediterranean, with sailors and captains of war ships and trading ships, with commanders and officers, and fi­nally with ­those who are appointed to or­ga­nize the military navy in this vicinity, such as Lawun [Leo] who was the governor of Tripoli in Syria, on the coast of Damascus a­ fter the year 912. . . . ​Additionally, the truth of this has been confirmed to me by ‘Abd Allah b. Wazir, governor of the city of Jableh, on the coast of Homs, in Syria; ­today [943] this man is the most knowledgeable on the Mediterranean—as well as the eldest—­and ­there is no captain of a war or trading ship sailing on this sea that does not submit to his advice and pay tribute to his intelligence and his skill, as well as to his devotion and [his ser­vice to] the jihad.35\n\nThe subjects al-­Mas‘udi chooses to discuss in his chapters on the seas in general and the Mediterranean in par­tic­u ­lar also draw from the shared base of the lit­er­a­ture of the adab, which marked his era. In referring to the Mediterranean, which then represented the western march, he made use of the “won­ders” to mark out the bound­aries of the ecumene. Narratives pertaining to Solomon’s cities of copper and to statues located on the shores of the western sea, intended to help seafarers navigate, played a pedagogical role, with a moral slant, by making it pos­si­ble to characterize ­these regions by “particularities” that personified each zone, like the light­house of Alexandria, the symbol of Egyptian antiquity still standing in al-­Mas‘udi’s time. The scholar made his own contribution to the knowledge of the world’s bound­aries by discovering new sources, which sometimes originated in the regions concerned. For example, he informs the reader that the conquest of al-­Andalus gave rise to a series of traditions of which Baghdad had kept a rec­ord in the libraries he visited.36 He writes, “It is to this place [the city of copper]\n\nT he A rab D iscovery of the M editerranean\n\n29\n\nthat Musa ibn Nusayr went in the time of ‘Abd al-­Malik ibn Marwan and h ­ ere he saw all the won­ders of which he gave a description in a book that is passed from hand to hand. O ­ thers say that [this city] was in the deserts bordering al-­Andalus and called the Vast Land.”37 The Okeanos of the Greeks, or the surrounding ocean that encircles the ecumene, was another essential boundary of Islam, particularly along the coasts of Iberia and western Maghreb. To describe it, first of all as a “marvelous” space closed to man, the scholar could draw on traditions from the Iberian Peninsula: “It is quite a common opinion that this sea [the ocean] is the source of all the other seas. Marvelous ­things are said about it, which we have reported in our Akhbar al-­Zaman. . . . ​ Thus, an inhabitant of al-­Andalus named Khashkhash, who was a youth of Córdoba, gathered a group of young ­people of the city and sailed with them on the Ocean on boats which they had fitted out. A ­ fter quite a long absence, he returned loaded with booty. Furthermore, this story is known to all inhabitants of the region.”38 At first glance, al-­Mas‘udi’s view of the Mediterranean does not seem particularly original; the material and method used, like the objectives of his encyclopedia, are derived from the education related to the adab, which André Miquel defines as a “­human geography” established in the tenth ­century, of which the encyclopedist was one of the most notable representatives, along with Ibn Hawqal (d. ca. 988) and al-­Muqaddasi. Innovation was not al-­Mas‘udi’s goal. Like al-­Tabari in the previous generation, he intended first and foremost to report the opinions of the ancients and compare them with his own experience. The polymath’s approach thus appears quite classic, primarily resting on a conception of space that blossomed in Iraq and took advantage of the exceptional collections of the libraries of Baghdad and neighboring cities.39\n\nT WO OBSERVERS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN\n\nAl-­Idrisi and Ibn Khaldun share a geographic background: both came from the western part of the sea. In that sense, they ­were both “true” Mediterraneans. Yet they had very dif­fer­ent, if complementary, ways of observing this maritime space. Al-­Idrisi was prob­ably born in Norman\n\n30\n\nB E T W E E N R E P R E ­S E N ­T A ­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\nSicily to a prestigious ­family related to the Prophet, which entitled him to use the honorific “Sharif.” 40 Working in the ser­vice of King Roger II, he became an eminent representative of Islamic culture in Christian lands. His body of work is entirely within the Arabic tradition and his geography is directly descended from the discipline born in the East. Born in Tunis in the f­ourteenth ­century, Ibn Khaldun also came from a prestigious Arab ­family. His Himyarite ancestors had settled in Seville during the conquest of al-­Andalus. While he never traveled beyond Islam’s borders, he explored the Islamic regions along the Mediterranean, from Granada to Damascus, in the ser­vice of the grandees of his time, even visiting Tamerlane (1336–1405) in the recently conquered Syrian capital. He l­ ater lived and worked in the Maghreb before settling in Egypt, where he served as a qadi (judge) and lived out his days. His remarkable knowledge of the Muslim Mediterranean was an insider’s view, developed by spending time in nearly all of its chancelleries. He lived in a period of crisis, during which the Muslim Mediterranean region suffered the double blow of plague and the threat of Latin imperialism. The conditions of the period had a significant influence on the way ­these two thinkers placed the Mediterranean at the heart of their work.41 Seen by his peers as the greatest geographer, the Sicilian al-­Idrisi was the only scholar to describe all the regions of the Mediterranean, having had access to both the Latin sources and the Arabic and Greek sources in Palermo. He was also set apart from other Arab geographers by his remarkable knowledge of the Latin world beyond the shores of the Mediterranean, reaching all the way to Toulouse and other Frankish cities. He himself visited several regions, notably the Maghreb and al-­Andalus, but also Palestine. The rest of his information was brought to him by researchers who had traveled through other areas thanks to the generosity of Roger II. His treatment of Latin and Slavic countries, which had previously been ignored or hastily depicted by Arab geographers based on the notes written by the traveler Ibrahim b. Ya‘qub, a Jewish merchant from Tortosa, around 965, was unpre­ce­dented. While ­these countries are hardly given equal treatment or as much detail, the Sicilian geographer was nonetheless the first to attempt to provide a complete picture by putting descriptions of Muslim and Christian re-\n\nT he A rab D iscovery of the M editerranean\n\n31\n\ngions in the Mediterranean on an equal footing. The treatment of the Latin part of the Mediterranean makes his Diversion for the Man Longing to Travel to Far-­Off Places, also known as The Book of Roger (Kitab Rujar), the most humanist, comprehensive medieval description of the Mediterranean world. The section devoted to Norman Sicily and Italy is particularly thorough, which proves that his description of the world was in e­ very re­spect descended from the Arab geography of Baghdad. Indeed, it is remarkably well adapted to the Sicilian sovereign’s ambitions in the Mediterranean and further differentiates the Norman kings’ sovereignty from the other Latin dynasties.42 The sea has a prominent place in the Mediterranean part of his description—­one could say it is at its center. The combination of al-­Idrisi’s Sharifian background—he was related to the Quraysh of Mecca—­and his highly classic Arab education in Palermo and through his travels makes him the archetype of the “medieval Mediterranean man,” as Leo Africanus would be, in his own way, at the beginning of the sixteenth ­century. This aspect of his identity largely explains the quality and specificity of his description of the Mediterranean area in his universal geography and the importance the islander gave to maritime space. For instance, his work reveals an intimate knowledge of fishing activities, especially ­those of his homeland.43 He considered the sea to be the heart of a single region divided by his pre­de­ces­sors into the infidel Christian North and the Muslim South. Without denying his Islamic background and beliefs, the geographer describes the remarkable ­human density of its three shores in the ­middle of the twelfth ­century, as well as the vigor and richness of its activities, the epicenter of which was the sea itself, joining the Christian and Muslim worlds into a ­whole that was the fruit of relationships then primarily forged by Latins with Byzantium and the Islamic regions. Al-­Idrisi had a talent for demonstrating Sicily’s centrality based on facts that could at first glance seem insignificant: “To the west [of Palermo] is a very pleasant destination, known by the name of Tribia, where waterways keep many mills turning; t­here is a plain ­there and vast fields. They make a kind of vermicelli t­ here that is exported in large quantities to the rest of the world, to Calabria, the Muslim provinces, and the Christian countries.” 44\n\n32\n\nB E T W E E N R E P R E ­S E N ­T A ­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\nAlong with this picture of the Mediterranean garden, al-­Idrisi’s work also focuses on maritime itineraries, which ­were found in all Arab geographies, and a considerable number of facts about the sea. The geographer also consciously exposes the reader to another side of twelfth-­ century real­ity, that of unpre­ce­dentedly devastating war. He initially touches on the subject when describing activities specific to the frontier, oddly similar on both sides of the border, and focuses on al-­Andalus: “[Trujillo] is a large city that looks like a well-­defended fortified town, surrounded by solid outer walls, endowed with well-­stocked markets. This city’s cavalrymen and foot soldiers constantly launch incursions against Christian localities. Most of the time, they engage in armed robbery and resort to ruses.” 45 Al-­Idrisi describes the ruinous situation of the coast of Ifriqiya, plagued by incursions of Arab tribes, particularly t­hose of the Banu Hilal, who ­were sent by the Fatimids of Cyrenaica to what is now Tunisia to punish the Zirids (973–1148) for declaring in­de­pen­dence. According to al-­Idrisi’s account, the Norman conquests launched by his master beginning in the 1030s had exacerbated the desolation of Ifriqiyan ports and their surroundings. He emphasizes the Mediterranean contradictions of which he was a privileged witness and creates a complex picture in which cultural fault lines did not prevent ties between the two enemies.46 He reveals this other Mediterranean paradox by describing commercial relations between Latins and Muslims. At a time when the clash between Muslims and Christians was at its fiercest, the two sides ­were bound by their desire for shared benefits. As a ­whole, his body of work, dedicated to the Norman king Roger II of Sicily, represented “a vast attempt to construct a new scientific object, the world captured as a ­whole, without exclusion.” 47 Nonetheless, this body of work consisting of two volumes remains the heir to the universal geography born in the Abbasid capital.48 One first notices this through the unan­i­mous recognition of al-­Idrisi’s colleagues, particularly Sa‘id al-­Maghribi (d. 1274) and the Syrian Abu l-­Fida’ (d. 1331), and all the way to Ibn Khaldun, who proudly copied him.49 One of the reasons for their esteem was that al-­Idrisi had respected geographic tradition, which produced an imago mundi based on a division of the seven inhabited regions into seven latitudinal climates, the\n\nT he A rab D iscovery of the M editerranean\n\n33\n\niqlim of Greek geography, and ten longitudinal sections. The seventy maps that formed the basis of his geography more or less respected ­these divisions and, once stuck together, composed one vast world map representing the earth and its seas, waterways, and mountains, with an accuracy revealing the pro­gress that had been made.50 Nevertheless, al-­Idrisi left Baghdad at the center of the ecumene, contradicting his text and the real­ity of his time. Indeed, the richness and profusion of information on the Mediterranean space led the geographer, ­whether consciously or not, to put the East’s place in perspective and to give the Mediterranean increased importance within the Islamic world. This shift appears all the more clearly in his description of the rivers and mountains of the north, particularly of the Alps, and in the number of Latin toponyms used. His descriptions of regions such as southern Italy and Sicily are as detailed as ­those of the Arab countries. Al-­Idrisi shifted fault lines by combining the densely inhabited worlds around the sea, w ­ hether Islamic or Christian, and pushing the bound­aries of the marginal zones farther t­oward the north of Eu­rope than his pre­de­ces­sors had. By ­doing so, he freed himself from the po­l iti­cal and religious borders imposed by the Abbasid geographers and embraced a shared Mediterranean polarity. Consequently, he highlighted the networks of economic relations that connected the two shores and did not hesitate to underline examples of syncretism like shared Christian and Muslim pilgrimage sites such as Cape Saint Vincent, at the very time when both religions’ authorities ­were increasingly rejecting such practices.\n\nIBN KHALDUN’S MEDITERRANEAN: “GEOGR APHY AS THE MEMORY OF HISTORY”\n\nThe sweeping geographic description provided by Ibn Khaldun at the beginning of the introduction to his Book of Lessons (Kitab al-­‘Ibar) was openly inspired by the geography of al-­Idrisi. Ibn Khaldun implicitly admitted that he could not find a better foundation for a subject that was not central to his own book: “All this [description of inhabited zones, seas, and rivers] is indicated in Ptolemy’s book and in The Book of Roger\n\n34\n\nB E T W E E N R E P R E ­S E N ­T A ­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\nby al-­Sharif al-­Idrisi. . . . ​All the mountains, seas, and rivers of the inhabited world are depicted and dealt with exhaustively.”51 While geography allows the historian to verify or invalidate “history in the name of the constancy of the pos­si­ble and the impossible,” he l­ ater goes beyond the traditional context of Arab geography and includes his history of the Mediterranean and the rest of the world in a spatial context that is no longer that of the traditional seventy sections by which the world was or­ga­nized in Arab geodesy, but now that imposed by the history of mankind.52 ­Here, Ibn Khaldun explains the age-­old reasons: the East and West, which had been divided and set against each other from time immemorial and which only the solidarity (‘asabiyya) of the Arabs had succeeded in uniting at the dawn of Islam, ­were once again divided, ­after caliphal unification was lost in the tenth c­ entury.53 Nonetheless, Islam remained the unifying instrument of this space that brought together two extremes and the source of all the forces standing against the infidel. Another constant was the pattern by which arid Bedouin countries gave rise to the impetus that drove hardened tribes to conquer and dominate fertile lands. ­These areas then witnessed the flourishing of the governments of civilizations established throughout the territory controlled by the madina, the capital where wealth converged over the course of three or four generations. The dynasty born of the conquest prospered thanks to revenue from the predominantly rural population, u ­ ntil a new momentum led to the establishment of a power that eliminated the current rulers, now corrupted by the capital’s solicitations.54 According to Ibn Khaldun, ­these patterns ­were also responsible for the changes of the Mediterranean Sea, which is described in the third part, devoted to “universal states, power, caliphate, governmental functions,” and particularly in the chapter on “command of the fleet.” This choice alone is an indication that the sea, constantly fought over by Christians and Muslims, is in the category of sovereign spaces whose history was ­shaped by the changes in the balance of power between Christian and Muslim adversaries. Roman in its essence, but mostly Byzantine if one agrees with Ibn Khaldun, the Mediterranean could be dominated by Islam when regional authorities—in this case, the three Mediterranean caliphates—­made the necessary effort to harness the ex-\n\nT he A rab D iscovery of the M editerranean\n\n35\n\ntraordinary potential of the sailors living on the coasts of Islam, particularly ­those of the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb. Ibn Khaldun continues by disclosing the reasons for Islam’s decline on the Mediterranean, attributing the shift in ­favor of the Latins not to the energy of the Christian powers, which would have implied acknowledging and thus legitimizing a Christian solidarity stronger than that of Islam, but to the Muslim sovereigns’ inability to keep up the necessary commitment to maintain a naval force. Without a proper naval force, they left the entire sea to the Byzantines and Latins.55 This highly original explanation in the context of Arabic lit­er­a­ture could only have taken shape in the mind of someone with intimate knowledge of the crisis of the Muslim Mediterranean unfolding before his eyes.56 Ibn Khaldun based his reasoning on the close connection between the power of the sultans and the domination of the seas, thanks to numerous fleets built in the dockyards of the caliphates’ major ports and commanded by celebrated admirals such as the Banu Maymun, who embodied the skill of the Andalusians, and, ­u nder the Almohads, Ahmad al-­Siqilli, who Ibn Khaldun believed was from Djerba. The weakening of the Muslim presence on the Mediterranean was not due to the quality of the sailors but rather to the shameful shortcomings of ­those in power, who went to pieces ­after a few successions. The example of the Western caliphate is explicit: from 1147 to 1198, the first three caliphs, up to and including Abu Yusuf Ya‘qub al-­Mansur (1184–1198) and his triumphant reign, produced the most formidable fleet of Islam, which dominated both the Mediterranean and Atlantic shores of the Muslim West. ­After the defeat at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212 and Caliph al-­Nasir’s premature death in 1214, the caliphate’s naval power dis­ appeared amid the upheaval of a long dynastic crisis. Maritime domination, which required the constant investment only a stable state could provide, was by nature the work of governments at the height of their power, just like the strongest land armies, which ­were composed of Bedouins drawing their energy from tribal cohesion and their strength from the pressures of life in an arid environment. It is conceivable that ­because Ibn Khaldun had lost his ­family in a shipwreck, he considered the sea an environment as hostile as the desert. Fi­nally, he offers a lesson in sociology—­one forgotten by some con­temporary historians—by\n\n36\n\nB E T W E E N R E P R E ­S E N ­T A ­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\nexplaining how the Arabs of the desert w ­ ere able to build a naval power capable of getting the upper hand over experienced Christians: “Once the Arabs had firmly established their power and demonstrated their might [around the Mediterranean;] . . . ​once ­every experienced man came to offer them his ser­vices in exchange for their protection; once they had employed foreign navigators for the needs of their navy and that, in this manner, they had acquired skill and experience, they had their own experts and aspired to fight on the sea.”57 Only learning and experience are relevant, not geographic origin. The desert ­people attained the ability to teach themselves the art of seafaring through the experience they had acquired from sea p ­ eople. The same ­causes producing the same effects, Muslim power is condemned “due to the weakness of the State and the oblivion into which the customs of the sea had fallen.” By reasoning this way, Ibn Khaldun seeks to indicate that the Mediterranean Sea, tamed and exploited by man, was the a­ ctual space in which the fate of Islam in the West was deci­ded, g­ oing back to the period when “Carthage made war on the master of Rome.” The sea he describes appears as the ultimate site of the secular confrontation between dynasties ancient and medieval, Christian and Muslim. As his entire body of work reveals, the Mediterranean Ibn Khaldun contemplated was a mirror reflecting the trends of his era: it had once again become a zone abandoned by Muslim sovereigns, allowing the Latins to dominate it. His sole reason for focusing on the Mediterranean was to use it to find reasons for Islam’s decline. Once he settled permanently in Cairo, he turned his attention to the East with the new hope of an Islamic f­ uture brought by the Mamluk sultanate and, a l­ ittle ­later, Tamerlane. The works of t­ hese three ­great Arab men of letters do not encompass all the sea-­related subjects in the body of Arabic descriptions, but they do provide an idea of the creative richness of Arab geography, particularly regarding an Islamic maritime space that remains marginalized by con­temporary historians of the Mediterranean and medieval Islam.58\n\n2\n\nA R A B W R I T I N G O N T H E CO N Q U EST OF THE MEDITERRANEAN as zx\n\nIn the Islamic era, the earliest Arabic references to the sea are t­ hose found in the Koran.1 Yet neither the Mediterranean nor any other sea is referred to as such. The first generation of Arabs to describe this maritime space was therefore that of the conquerors. However, accounts of the conquest are only accessible in the versions gathered in the chronicles of the third ­century of the Hegira (816–912), which ­were the first to be preserved, according to a princi­ple described by Ibn Khaldun: “The ­great historians of Islam exhaustively collected the accounts of the glorious days.”2 In ­t hese stories, the Mediterranean appears as the sea of war.\n\nTHE ABBASID CHRONICLES\n\n­ ese stories, which are presented in the form of annals setting forth Th events year by year, ­were established from traditions that could date back to the second generation of believers and w ­ ere preserved and passed down in the same way as the deeds, teachings, and sayings (Hadith) of the Prophet. Most of the historians of the first generations of\n\n38\n\nB E T W E E N R E P R E ­S E N ­T A ­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\nMuslims ­were primarily specialists of the isnad, the chain of authorities attesting to the authenticity of the Prophet’s sayings, and their transmission by ­those who had heard him speak. This implies that the historical facts of the beginnings of Islam, as reported by the Arabs, ­were filtered through several generations of transmitters before being recorded in the form in which they have reached us.3 Thus, the Arabic sources cite more than two hundred titles by about ninety-­nine authors of traditions, produced before the first preserved text was written.4 The list of ­these titles provides an idea of the earliness and strength of the writing movement initiated in Medina. However, the complete disappearance of this body of work continues to raise many questions about the conditions of its production, particularly in the case of the texts relating to the Mediterranean. The first accounts to have survived date from the m ­ iddle of the ninth ­century, at best: the first chronicles available are ­those by the Andalusian Ibn Habib, the Egyptian chronicle by Ibn ‘Abd al-­Hakam, and the Iraqi narratives by Khalifa b. Khayyat (d. 854), al-­Baladhuri (d. 892), al-­ Ya‘qubi, and al-­Tabari. Th ­ ese authors had themselves repeated as their own the narratives of the conquest gathered and recorded by traditionists from written and oral “drafts” dating back to the events described.5 The chroniclers also drew from the annals of Christian authors, primarily the millenarian tales, which had a par­tic­u­lar influence on Ibn Habib and al-­K hwarizmi (d. 847), the author of a lost “History Book.” 6 Wherever their location in the Islamic world, the chroniclers mostly repeated the traditions and certain narratives, which ­were composed in the form used to report the b ­ attles of the Prophet, the sira or maghazi. ­These writings w ­ ere initially collected in Baghdad and the large cities of the Abbasid realm by men of letters in caliphal circles, particularly Sayf b. ‘Umar, al-­Waqidi (d. 823), and his secretary Ibn Sa‘d (d. 845), the authors most frequently cited in the Iraqi chronicles. The period during which ­these works ­were produced corresponds with several phases of turmoil in the history of the caliphate, such as the ousting of the Barmakid viziers by Harun al-­Rashid (786–809) in 803 and the war of succession that brought al-­Rashid’s sons al-­Amin (809–813) and al-­Ma’mun (813–833) into conflict.7 ­These rewritings ­were intended to give the events a specific significance and provide a basis for caliphal legitimacy. This\n\nARAB WRITING ON THE CONQUEST\n\n39\n\nhistoriographic cycle ended with “the chronicle of Abu Ja‘far Muhammad b. Jarir al-­Tabari[, which] shines among all (historical) compositions and is superior to them.” 8 Narratives by regional authors, such as t­ hose of the Egyptian Ibn ‘Abd al-­Hakam, ­were inspired by the same early ninth-­century texts, particularly since al-­Hakam wrote his chronicle in Baghdad. The way in which ­these narratives ­were written implies that the caliphal authorities and their provincial governors had a very significant influence on this production. Indeed, as early as the death of Muhammad and especially beginning with the succession of ‘Umar in 844, the caliphs felt it necessary to strictly control not only the writing of the holy texts of Islam, the Koran and the Sunna, which ­were the foundation for the development of Sunni Islam, but also the history of Islam’s beginnings. The written account of the Community of Believers from its origins was the basis for the caliphs’ legitimacy, to the point that, starting with the reign of ‘Abd al-­Malik (686–705), which began with a civil war, the caliphs insisted on having control over any historical writing on Islam.9 This task was entrusted to scholars, the ulema, who ­were specialists in the transmission of the prophetic Hadith, and, increasingly, authorities on jurisprudence, the fuqaha’.10 Similarly, the emergence of an early scholarly environment in newly conquered provinces with long-­established state traditions, such as Egypt, Ifriqiya, and Iberian Baetica, fostered the appearance of a local historiography to rival that of the caliphal capitals. The same kind of ferment was found in the former eastern provinces of the Sassanid Empire beginning in the late ninth ­century. Provincial governors like ‘Abd al-­‘Aziz b. Marwan (685–705), who was appointed to Egypt by his ­brother the caliph, ­were essential players in encouraging the development of productive, autonomous literary centers, particularly in Fustat and Kairouan. As with the caliphal centers, none of this first generation of writing has survived, but a good deal of it was passed down and can be found in the texts—­histories, biographical works—­w ritten as of the beginning of the ninth ­century and especially ­after the advent of the Mediterranean caliphates in the tenth c­ entury.11 With the exception of Ibn Habib’s chronicle, in the Maghreb (including al-­Andalus), only a few l­ egal rulings made by Sahnun (d. 854), a\n\n40\n\nB E T W E E N R E P R E ­S E N ­T A ­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\nchief qadi of Ifriqiya, and his successors, ­later collected by jurists, have survived the centuries.12 Despite the existence of prolific centers of production, at least in the two capitals, the writings of the generation of the Aghlabid and Umayyad emirates have not survived the passage of time and the radical filtering of the Kairouan and Córdoba caliphates. ­These regions’ ulema circulated the first doctrinal formulations of the law, but they ­were also responsible for other forms of writing that brought about a historiography parallel to that produced in the caliphal palaces. Early on, the ulema of the Mediterranean assembled the lives of the pious and worthy men of ­t hese regions in biographical collections (tabaqat), of which the oldest surviving examples date from the tenth ­century, thus contributing to reinforcing a regional tradition that could sometimes produce a historiography dif­fer­ent from or even contradictory to that left by the men of letters in the sovereign’s circle. For instance, the narratives of the conquest of Egypt include contradictory information about the personality and policy of ‘Amr b. al-­‘As (d. ca. 663), which was circulated very early and, despite strict censorship, was not entirely filtered out by the sovereigns’ circles.13\n\n­U N D E R T H E C O N T R O L O F T H E S U L T A N : THE MEDITERRANEAN AS WRITTEN BY THE CHRONICLERS OF BAGHDAD\n\nThe vari­ous chroniclers of the ninth c­ entury generally approached the history of Islam by using the same themes and often by drawing on the same traditions. They imposed the chronological divisions and subjects found from one chronicle to the next, which continue to be included in most histories about the beginnings of Islam. However, t­here are certain differences in conception and interpretation in the chronicles: though Ibn ‘Abd al-­Hakam and al-­Baladhuri both wrote histories of the conquests (futuh) inspired by the traditions devoted to the Prophet’s ­battles, their respective versions diverge. Al-­Tabari wrote the first universal chronicle to cover a far more extensive period, from the time of the prophets to that of the Abbasids. From the traditions to the chronicles, the accounts of the times of conquest ­were updated for each gen-\n\nARAB WRITING ON THE CONQUEST\n\n41\n\neration of believers, though the events reported are most often derived from the same transmission.14 At the same time, the events of the conquest w ­ ere interpreted differently from one region to another: aside from strong Egyptian regionalism, al-­Dinawari (d. 889), a historian of Iraq and Iran, bears witness to a “localist” spirit that asserted itself with ­those regions’ Islamization.15 As a result, al-­Tabari was, on several occasions, in a position to provide dif­fer­ent versions of the same event, citing the channels through which they had been passed down: “­There is a difference of opinion regarding the date of the conquest of Alexandria. Some say it was conquered in 646, two years a­ fter the beginning of the caliphate of ‘Uthman b. ‘Affan, u ­ nder the command of ‘Amr b. al-­‘As. According to Ibn Humayad, Salama, Ibn Ishaq, al-­Qasim b. Quzman, a native of Egypt, Ziyad b. Jaz’ al-­Zubaydi, who reported that he was one of the soldiers of ‘Amr b. al-­‘As’s army when Misr and Alexandria ­were conquered: ‘We conquered Alexandria during the caliphate of ‘Umar b. al-­K hattab, in 21 / 642 or 22 / 643.’ ”16 The g­ reat historian’s ambition to be historically rigorous highlights the aim in Baghdad literary circles to unify the historiographic versions of Islam’s beginnings in a single, universal current. The Development of Narrative to Promote Abbasid Universalism The loss of the original strata of reported accounts of the ­century of the birth and conquests of Islam complicates the task of studying the first forms of the historical narrative. The biographies of the Prophet and the accounts of his b ­ attles, written in Medina as of the beginning of the eighth ­century, prob­ably made up the first generation of stories whose form would be adapted to the texts accompanying the community’s expansion. The impetus provided by the Marwanid sovereigns coincided with the appearance of chronologies of the sovereigns’ reigns, with varying amounts of commentary, ­under the title “history” (ta’rikh). Shihab al-­Zuhri (d. 742) may have written the first history of the caliphs, commissioned by Caliph al-­Walid I b. Marwan (705–715). It was reportedly presented in the form of a dynastic chronicle ­going back to the earliest period of Islam. Al-­Zuhri is also credited with a history of the Arabs.17 Caliph ‘Abd al-­Malik, ­a fter having lost control of Mecca,\n\n42\n\nB E T W E E N R E P R E ­S E N ­T A ­T I O N A N D A P P R O P R I A T I O N\n\nthen in the hands of the anti-­caliph ‘Abd Allah b. al-­Zubayr (d. 692), is said to have asked al-­Zuhri to collect the traditions that would make it pos­si­ble to pres­ent Jerusalem as another major pilgrimage site, at the time when he was ordering the Dome of the Rock to be built.18 Al-­Zuhri’s knowledge of the Sunna and his background as a jurist— he was appointed a qadi ­under ‘Umar II (717–720)—­made him the best pos­si­ble expert on the history of Islam’s past and the most apt to write historical treatises commissioned by the Umayyad caliphs. His art of transmission provided him with the necessary command of gathering traditions. This close relationship between the development of the two channels of traditions designated the men of letters, well versed in religious ­matters, to take on the role of historians. This explains the absence of history as a specialized field in the first centuries of Islam: even al-­ Tabari was initially recognized as a g­ reat jurist by the Arab scholars of the ­Middle Ages. Al-­Zuhri’s role as a historian of the Marwanids before the generation of traditionists and chroniclers of the Abbasid caliphs was an essential stage in the development of sultanic historiography and would have a power­ful influence on the caliphs’ approach. During the same period, the Arab historiography of the second c­ entury of the Hegira was enriched by the texts left by traditionists of Persian background and ­those Christian traditionists who joined the sovereigns and the authorities in the regional capitals, particularly the men of letters of the monasteries of Upper Mesopotamia in the area of Harran.19 A Historiography of Conquest in the Ser­vice of Abbasid Legitimacy As of the reign of al-­Mansur (754–775), the second Abbasid caliph, the Byzantine frontier became the primary scene of the jihad led by the sovereigns of Baghdad. In the expert hands of the chroniclers, the previous caliphates’ policy of expansion consequently became an essential argument for reforming frontier defenses, particularly as encouraged by Harun al-­Rashid.20 This takeover initially concerned the aristocracies and tribes who guarded the Umayyad front, then the Barmakid viziers in charge of the frontier at the beginning of the ninth ­century. At the same time, the history of the Umayyad conquest in Syria and Anatolia\n\nARAB WRITING ON THE CONQUEST\n\n43\n\nand as far as the Bosporus was presented as the most impor­tant area of the war of the caliphs. The construction of the warrior images of Mu‘awiya (661–680), founder of the Damascus dynasty and universally recognized as a g­ reat strategist both on land and at sea, and Maslama, despite his defeat outside Constantinople in 717–718, was largely due to the necessity of connecting the Abbasid jihad to that of the first conquerors, for as long as the Iraqi caliphs personally led or supervised the campaigns against the Byzantines. Thus, the glorious feats of arms of the caliphs and their representatives could rival the exploits of their pre­ de­ces­sors’ armies.21 The legitimization of jihad had to be based on the government of the previous caliphates, which had led the conquerors all the way to the Atlantic, while the Abbasids had to take responsibility for the effective end of the conquests and find other expressions of the jihad incumbent on the Prophet’s successors. Traditions reporting governmental decisions by the Rashidun and Syrian caliphs w ­ ere judiciously selected with a par­tic­u­lar emphasis on jihad and the government of conquered provinces, all with an eye to reinforcing the legitimacy of the sovereigns of Baghdad. The authority of ‘Umar b. al-­K hattab, who was presented as the greatest of the caliphs, was largely called on for anything relating to military operations and the administration of the conquered provinces, starting with Sassanid Iraq; al-­Tabari provides a detailed account of the episodes leading to the foundation of Kufa, the first Iraqi capital and one of the bases from which the Abbasid conquest was launched.22 The Syrian caliphs’ displays of force ­were also potentially power­f ul reminders that the caliphs’ authority extended to all the conquered regions. Thus, the announcement of the nomination of governors in the provinces, by both the Rashidun caliphs and the Umayyads, had a par­ tic­u­lar resonance at a time when the western territories ­were slipping out of Baghdad’s control in ­favor of dissidents who had left the East to escape repression: regions inaccessible to the caliph’s armies ­were taken over by the Umayyads in al-­Andalus as of 756, the ‘Ibadi Rustamids (777–909) of Tahert in the center of the Maghreb as of 777, and the Idrisids (789–984) farther west as of 789.
