LOPEZ-MORILLAS\n\nP R I N C E T O N U N I V E R S I T Y PRESS PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY\n\n1969\n\nCopyright © 1969 by Princeton University Press ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card Number: 66-10930 The original Spanish edition was published by Editorial Vicens—Vives, Barcelona, Spain, in 1955. World rights for this English language edition from the Spanish third edition, 1964, are vested in Princeton University Press. This book has been composed in Times Roman type. Printed in the United States of America by Vail-Ballou Press, Inc., Binghamton, N. Y. Most of the maps and charts for this English language edition were supplied by the Spanish publisher; hence, geographical terms appear with their Spanish spelling. All captions are in English. NOTE:\n\nTranslator's Note\n\nThe late Jaime Vicens Vives (1910-1960) was Professor of Modern History at the University of Barcelona and Director of the Center for International Historical Studies there. Recognized as one of the most brilliant of recent Spanish historians, he has been responsible for many new interpretations in Spanish history, especially of the fifteenth century. Among his works are Aproximacion a la historia de Espana (Approach to the History of Spain, Barcelona, 1952), Juan II de Aragon; monarquia y revolucion (John II of Aragon: Monarchy and Revolution, Barcelona, 1953), Historia critica de la vida y reinado de Fernando II de Aragon (Critical History of the Life and Reign of Ferdinand II of Aragon, Zaragoza, 1962), and, in the Catalan language, Els Trastamares (Barcelona, 1956) and Noticia de Catalunya (Barcelona, n.d.). He was also general editor of the monumental five-volume Historia economica y social de Espana (Barcelona, 1957-1959). The present volume, which grew out of Professor Vicens Vives' course in Economic History of Spain at the University of Barcelona, first appeared in 1955, and a second edition was issued in 1959. After Vicens Vives' untimely death it was edited for a third time in 1964, revised by Dr. Jorge Nadal Oiler, a former pupil and colleague at the University of Barcelona, who had also collaborated in the first two editions. This English translation has been made from the third edition. The translator wishes to express special gratitude to Professor Robert S. Smith of Duke University, a specialist in Spanish economic history, who patiently edited the manuscript with the eye of a trained economist, and whose labor was an indispensable step in the preparation of this edition. Thanks are also due to Laura H. Mapes for valuable help in repaging the Index, as well as at many other stages in the preparation of the manuscript. F.M. L-M. Providence, Rhode Island 1968\n\nAuthor's Preface to the Second Edition\n\nIn 1955 and 1956, the lectures I had given during those two years from the chair of economic history of Spain in the School of Economic Sciences at the University of Barcelona were collected and published under the title \"Notes for the Course on Economic History of Spain.\" Because of the nature of the subject and the lack of available textbooks, I accepted the idea of immediately supplying the students in the course with a text which would help them in their work. It was an arduous task, and one that did not turn out just as I had hoped. The notes I gave to the printer were too general in scope and needed careful revision. A number of unsupported value judgments and some gross errors slipped into them. That was inevitable. But I took the precaution of stating that these notes should be considered only as a teaching guide and not as a completelyfinishedwork. In spite of these drawbacks, the \"Notes\" in question soon spread outside the strictly academic area and began to circulate among a public increasingly interested in learning more about the subject. This tempted me to prepare a manual of the economic history of Spain which would elucidate the present state of the many problems that cluster about this particular discipline, and which would also serve as a point of departure for new scientific accomplishments in the understanding of our economic past. This task, naturally, would have been an exceedingly lengthy one. But in view of insistent and kindly suggestions from friends and colleagues, and of the needs of students, I have decided to relinquish for the moment a more definitive project, which would have occupied me for many years, and to send to the press a somewhat more detailed and, insofar as possible, more exact revision of my original \"Notes.\" Like any manual for the use of university students, the present volume attempts to gather all the information available within the area treated. This means that it contains the inevitable generalizavii\n\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\n\ntions in those fields in which I have not done direct and personal research. However, with the aid of Dr. Jorge Nadal Oiler, my associate in the chair and a specialist in 16th and 17th-century Spanish economic history, this volume has been able to count on firsthand information from the second half of the 14th century to the end of the 19th. The material which concerns previous periods is based upon both fundamental bibliography and recently published articles. My constant concern has been to trace with accuracy the dynamics of Spanish economic history. To do so has been, perhaps, the most exhausting work of all. I have also been concerned with eliminating nonessentials in order to stress fundamentals. Many of my working notes have not been included in this volume. Some have been omitted in hope that they can be utilized at a better time—that is, in a more detailed work; others in the hope that new monographic material will appear which will place them in a truer perspective. I hope that this always thankless task of selection has not been inadequate, and that I have not chopped down more than the necessary number of trees in the attempt to show the forest more clearly. The original text has been twice revised, first by Dr. Nadal and then by myself. Thus we have succeeded in presenting a really different work, although here and there the umbilical cord connecting it with the \"Notes\" can be detected. Some chapters have been totally recast; others, rewritten. Changes have been made throughout. Among these I wish to point out the new orientation given to monetary subjects which in the original were rather sketchy because of lack of basic information, and the inclusion at the end of the volume of bibliographical resources which will serve to guide and supply points of reference for those wishing to explore in more detail the problems treated in the book. Anyone who has been concerned with studies on the economic history of Spain will realize the difficulty of the task I have undertaken in these pages. Therefore, I shall gratefully accept any indications and suggestions for improvement which may be offered, if in the course of time a further edition appears. J. V. V. Barcelona November, 1958 viii\n\nNote to the Third Edition\n\nWhen the need became clear for a new edition of An Economic History of Spain, and in view of the untimely death of Professor Jaime Vicens Vives, we thought that it would be most appropriate to turn over revision of the text to one of his most highly regarded disciples, Dr. Jorge Nadal Oiler, who had already collaborated in the revision of the original text, and whose brilliant work in the teaching of this material as well as in research make him one of our best specialists in that discipline. Fortunately it has been possible to keep this revision within the bounds established by the two previous editions, for during the four years that have passed since the appearance of the second edition, the structure of our information on Spanish economic history has not substantially altered. In fact, publication of the \"Notes\" was the first step toward an objective which is already being achieved, that of a totally new— and fascinating because hitherto unknown—view of our Spanish economic past. We hope, then, that this Manual will continue to guide coming generations of students, and that it will open before the general reader the new horizons offered by study of the problems of Spain's economic history.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTranslator's Note Author's Preface to the Second Edition Note to the Third Edition\n\nν vii ix\n\n1.

The philosophers of history establish certain periods in human events in order to study them better. However, what societies come to be is not confined to watertight compartments nor closed-off periods. Neither Man nor Humanity can be crammed into periods, not even into the oft-described stages of youth, maturity, and old age. Thus we cannot speak of ages in history; it cannot be said that there were culturally backward Middle Ages, nor a Modern Age with an ultra-advanced civilization. For just as there are young people who seem to have been born old, and old people who always stay young, so there are peoples and societies which continually renew themselves or remain permanently senile. Therefore, to speak in terms of periods is only a pedagogical device and has value only as a point of reference. Historical life is a movement of societies toward spiritual and material perfection. In this process the important factor is the rhythm of the action, the speed with which social structures achieve their full dimensions. Sometimes the rhythm appears to slow down; at other times, conversely, it accelerates noticeably. Each of these phases can be thought of as historical periods, but we must not lose sight of the fact that they make up a coherent and uninterrupted whole. PERIODIZATION IN ECONOMIC HISTORY. AS\n\nApplying this criterion to the economic history of Spain, we can point out several broad phases or chronological periods. But in order to do this we must keep in mind (1) the progress of economic evolution in general, and (2) the evolution of the Hispanic social structure. In fact, when we speak of the economic history of a nation, we must remember that its development cannot be thought of as iso-\n\nPRINCIPAL STAGES IN SPANISH ECONOMIC EVOLUTION.\n\n3\n\nSTAGES IN THE SPANISH ECONOMIC PROCESS\n\nlated, but rather as taking place within the so-called intelligible framework of history, that is, in relation to the cultural structure of which it is a part. In the case of the Iberian Peninsula, it naturally must be located within the orbit of Western society. And since economic life is above all a matter of relationship, Spain undoubtedly exercised a decisive influence on this group of nations at many points in history. And it is likewise obvious that at other times particular nations and even continents, such as America, had a powerful influence on Spanish economic development. As for the use of the social structure as a basis for periodization, we must point out that there is an intimate connection among economic, social, and political structures. And since it is often the case that economic progress is so slow that periodization is difficult to establish (as in the case of the progress of agricultural techniques and their advance or retrogression in relation to factors of climate) and, on the other hand, since social structure reflects more clearly the modifications caused by the cyclical waves of the economy, we can sometimes have recourse to social structural forms in order to achieve a panoramic view of Spain's economic history. The true birth of Hispanic economy took place in antiquity, when the more advanced peoples of the Eastern Mediterranean undertook colonization of the outlying lands of the then known world. In the historical process of control over the metal routes by Eastern peoples, Hesperia or Hispania was the mythical country of riches and the marketplace where the metals of the North Atlantic and the gold and marble of Africa came together. The economic factor was, therefore, the chief incentive for the incorporation of Spain into the Mediterranean world. Thus Hispania came little by little into the system of Mediterranean colonizations. Of these, the most important were the Punic and the Greek. The colonization of trading posts and fortified places predominated, established on islands, coasts, and straits. We find this same system in more modern times in the colonization carried out by European nations. Holland in South Africa and the East Indies, England in Asia and other parts of the world are obvious examples of it during the 16th to 19th centuries. We know how Rome joined the ranks of the colonizing powers in Hispania by defeating her rivals the Carthaginians. The dominion PRIMITIVE COLONIAL ECONOMY.\n\n4\n\nSTAGES IN THE SPANISH ECONOMIC PROCESS\n\nof Rome in the Hispanic Peninsula for more than six centuries was the basis of an economic system founded on exploitation of mines and the olive oil produced by the large landed estates, a system which has lasted to the present day. Roman Hispania therefore gives us an excellent example of a colonial economy based on settlement and primary exploitation, within the larger compass of ancient Mediterranean economy. When the Germanic peoples overran the Roman Empire, Mediterranean economy began a gradual decline which became precipitous around the 9th century. During this period a new economic system, feudalism, was established. In Spain, as in other parts of the Western world, the collapse of mercantile and monetary economy led to the establishment of a family-type economy based on two elements—wheat and sheep. This type predominated from the 8th to the 12th century, especially in the Christian zone, for the economy of Moslem Spain had taken an entirely different turn, and Al-Andalus was one of the few European centers in which a commercial type of economy persisted longest. We must understand the Christian reconquest, especially in the early centuries, in its economic aspect; that is, as an attempt to resolve the people's concrete and direct problems. Very often the expeditions carried out by the Asturian, Castilian, and Leonese kings had a double purpose, economic and political, insofar as they were an attempt to protect pastures and grazing routes, the basis, as we have seen, of the Hispanic economy at that time. Again, the raids of the Christian armies often carried off men and money to the North, where both were badly needed. This much will suffice to make us understand that during the feudal period the Christian kingdoms of the Meseta, or central plateau, were mere satellites of the great Moslem economic center of southern Spain.\n\nFEUDAL AND SEIGNIORIAL ECONOMY.\n\nA profound change took place in the peninsular economic picture during the 12th century with the rise of a new mentality, that of the bourgeois patriciate, which contrasted sharply with the mentality of the preceding centuries. This urban bourgeoisie established new living COMMERCIAL EXPANSION OF THE BOURGEOIS PATRICIATE.\n\n5\n\nSTAGES IN THE SPANISH ECONOMIC PROCESS\n\nstandards and new economic systems. Among the Hispanic regions Catalonia quickly distinguished herself by her economic impetus, stimulated by a flourishing trade in gold, slaves, spices, and the manufacture of cloth. During the 13th, 14th, and part of the 15th centuries, Barcelona was the most important Spanish economic center. Somewhat later than Catalonia, about the beginning of the 14th century, Castile entered the arena of commercial expansion by exploiting the excellent wool from her sheep. Her international outlet was supplied by the Basque and Cantabrian coasts. Castile became the chief export market for wool—a veritable Australia of the Late Middle Ages—and because of her great wealth could aspire to political and economic supremacy in the Peninsula. The mercantilist period comprises the 16th and 17th centuries, beginning with the establishment of the Spanish monarchy under Ferdinand and Isabella, and the discovery of the New World. Two facts essentially define it—survival of the economic mentality of the bourgeois patriciate (though transferred to the State), and the opening of the gigantic American market. It is the period when Mexican and Peruvian silver arrived in Spain, breaking all the old economic molds and quickly leading to capitalism. However, the golden age of Castilian economy under mercantilism did not last long. Castile did not adapt to capitalistic ways and created a fictitious economy in which wealth in precious metals, instead of benefiting her, led her into unfortunate paths. And on the other hand, Spain was forced to maintain a very large military establishment, greater than her resources warranted. The situation deteriorated after the beginning of the 17th century, coming to a climax in the financial collapse of 1680, one of the basic dates in the Spanish economic process. MERCANTILIST PERIOD.\n\nAfter a long hiatus, the early governments of the Bourbon Philip V managed to stabilize the Spanish economy by the second decade of the 18 th century. From then on Spain went through a period abounding in reforming energy and economic activity. Just what happened in the 18 th century? The fact is that Spain fell into line with the rest of Europe. Until then the Spanish economy had followed one path ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION DURING THE 18 TH CENTURY.\n\n6\n\nSTAGES IN THE SPANISH ECONOMIC PROCESS\n\nand European economy another. While in Europe the technological inventions which marked the beginning of the industrial era were appearing, while the concept of large-scale capital was being developed and the idea of commercial enterprise was taking rational shape, the most important part of Spain continued to be bound to the old routine systems of farming and herding. When the two currents met, Spain experienced a rapid rise in her economy, based on the activity of the State, the development of American commerce, and the industriousness of Catalonia and the Basque region. But this very flowering, when it broke up the archaic social structure, brought Spain face to face with the constitutional problem of the 19th century and with it the fact of political and social revolution. The Industrial Revolution, which began in England about the middle of the 18th century, did not become apparent in Spain until early in the 19th, and then not everywhere but only in some marginal, peripheral zones where the Peninsular War—disastrous for the Spanish economy as a whole—had been unable to kill prosperity or the spirit of industrial progress. These regions survived not only the collapse of the war against Napoleon but the loss of the American empire. The result was, however, that loss of the former colonies deprived these regions of an extraordinary chance to compete with the principal economic powers during the 19th century. Impoverished by internal wars, the selfishness of her ruling classes, and the backwardness of her masses, Spain achieved only an underdeveloped stage of capitalism during the 19th century. Although the cotton industry made great progress, metallurgy was obviously retarded and the national economy was dominated by foreign capital. However, some elements in the agricultural and industrial fields made tremendous efforts to achieve positive progress with Spanish resources. The actions of some industrialists and landowners of the last century, in the face of corrupt and deficient administrations and a conformist and stagnant country, are worthy of admiration and respect. IMPACT OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN SPAIN.\n\nThe contemporary phase of Spanish economic history begins in 1917. The First World War not only seriously disturbed the Spanish social system, raising the quesCONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC HISTORY.\n\n7\n\nSTAGES IN THE SPANISH ECONOMIC PROCESS\n\ntion of capitalism versus socialism as acutely as in other countries, but, by mobilizing the country's economy, it emphasized the enormous discrepancy between what had been done and what remained to be done. It became necessary to establish a balance among agriculture, grazing, and industry that would make possible the full development of the industrial and technological revolution. The contemporary period, in spite of its dramatic failures, exhibits the most determined collective effort to discover a viable channel for realizing those aims and for bringing Spain's economy into the general framework of the economy of the West.\n\n2 · Infrastructure of Spanish Economic History\n\nThe basic infrastructure of Spain's economic history is determined by the nature of the land masses which appeared in southwestern Europe as the result of an extremely long tectonic process. What are the chief stages in this geological history, and what have their consequences been for the Spanish economy? In the Paleozoic era a gigantic land mass (Hesperia) appeared which formed the southern boundary of a large continent. This mass took on its definitive shape during the Silurian, Cambrian, and Hercynian periods. It was during this last period that the principal axes of the Meseta's structure were established, in a northwestsoutheast direction, forming high mountain ranges now worn down by erosion. When, as a result of various folding actions, geological upheavals submerged the accumulations of lush vegetation created by the warm climate of the epoch, the foundation was laid for the rich carboniferous deposits of some Spanish coalfields, notably those of Asturias and Puertollano. At the same time, the Hercynian upheavals cracked the initial nucleus, and through these cracks important mineral layers appeared, such as those found throughout the southern Mp of the Meseta, or Sierra Morena (copper in Huelva, lead and silver in Sierra Morena, mercury in Almaden, etc.). The important consequences of this Paleozoic movement, therefore, were (1) estabMshment of the Meseta, the essential nucleus of the Hispanic Peninsula, (2) northwest-southeast direction of the principal topographical aMgnments and of the hydrographic system, (3) relative abundance of soft and hard coal formations, and (4) presence of mineral layers in some mountain sectors. During the Mezozoic era the structural Mnes of Hesperia were maintained, despite the fact that several times during this period the region was flooded by seawater. The result was the deposition of GEOLOGICAL FORMATION OF THE HISPANIC PENINSULA.\n\n9\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOF SPANISH ECONOMIC\n\nHISTORY\n\nlarge quantities of calcareous alluvia around its edges. There was no essential change, except for the rather unfavorable role which these deposits later exercised on Spanish agricultural soil. In the strictly mineralogical sphere, the marshy system which followed the Cretaceous sea resulted in numerous lignite deposits. These, apart from the typical calcareous and marble formations, are the only manifestations of the Mezozoic which have economic importance in Spain. In the Tertiary period the tectonic process was more important. As the continent of Gondwana, or Africa, advanced against the northern continent, in the process destroying the geosyncline which separated them, its deep folds came into violent contact with the edges of the primary Spanish and French land masses. This collision, known as the Alpine, produced a number of tectonic upheavals which have given the Peninsula its shape: in the south, the Baetic system; in the north, the Pyrenees. Simultaneously, it produced the elevation of the old calcareous sediments on the edges of the Meseta, giving rise to the Iberian System and the Cantabrian mountains at the same time that a series of fractures and mountain resurgences brought about the present configuration of the Central System and Sierra Morena. After the Alpine mountains were formed, the Meseta became covered by a series of lakes connected with the shallow seas covering the valleys of the Ebro and Guadalquivir; these slowly became filled in by sediments from the great Tertiary mountain chains. Also, the phenomena of compression and decompression gave rise to numerous mineral deposits (iron in Biscay, lead in Cartagena). At the end of the Tertiary, and after the opening of the Strait of Gibraltar, the Peninsula took on its present outlines. Only the plains of the Levant and the Andalusian and Portuguese coastlines continued to be partly submerged. In the Quaternary era the superficial coverings of alluvia, clay, and sand were laid down. At that time huge glaciers covered the Pyrenean region and the high peaks of the Cantabrian, Iberian, and Baetic systems. The most fertile agricultural lands date from this period. It should be kept in mind that the Tertiary compressions and decompressions took place in a generally northeasterly-southwesterly direction; that is, in a direction diametrically opposed to that of 10\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOF SPANISH ECONOMIC\n\nHISTORY\n\nthe Hercynian period. This fundamental texture is still to be observed in the hydrographic network and natural routes of the Peninsula. sets of facts can be observed from the tectonic process we have just described, one which has to do with the general structure of the Spanish land mass, the other with the quality of its agricultural soil. Geographers point out the presence of four main structural elements in the Peninsula: the Meseta; the mountains which surround it; the depressions adjoining it on the northeast and south; and the outer mountain ranges. The surrounding mountain systems are the Cantabrian to the north, the Iberian to the east, and the Sierra Morena to the south, although the last is less a mountain range than the result of erosion of the Meseta's southern edge, graded down by the fault which opened up early in the Tertiary. The adjoining depressions are the Iberian, or Ebro, valley to the north, and to the south the Baetic or Guadalquivir valley. The exterior mountain ranges are the Pyrenees to the north and the Baetic to the south. This geographical structure determines, at first glance, the specific characteristic of the Hispanic Peninsula: its natural unity, modified by marked regional compartmentation. Modern research has revealed that the soil of the Peninsula can be separated into two great subdivisions which we shall call, following Hernandez Pacheco, \"siliceous Spain\" and \"calcareous Spain.\" This important difference arises as much from the geological nature of the soil as from the climatic and physiographic accidents which have taken place in recent times. In this regard, a work of Lucas Mallada's entitled The Evils of Our Country and the Coming Spanish Revolution (Los males de la patria y la futura revolucion espanola), published in 1890, is still of some interest. He divides the national territory into the following types of soils: bare rock, 10%; low-yield land, 35%; moderately productive, 45%; and highly productive, 10%. These figures substantially alter the eulogy usually made of the fertility of Spanish soil, derived from the Laudes Hispaniae written by St. Isidore in the 6th century and repeated by Alfonso X, \"the Wise.\" In fact, only 55% of Spanish soil is suitable for agriculture, which in comparison with the European average is a disappointing proSPANISH SOIL. TWO\n\n11\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE OF SPANISH ECONOMIC HISTORY\n\nportion. Fernando Martin Sanchez-Julia has recently taken issue with thesefiguresin an article entitled \"Fundamental Truths About Spanish Agrarian Economy\" (Verdades fundamentales sobre la economia agraria espanola), in which he has attempted to dispute the pessimistic theory of Spanish agriculture. But if we examine his figures we see that his conclusions are similar to those of Lucas Mallada, for the truth is that the Hispanic Peninsula cannot be compared with countries like France or Holland, but rather with other Mediterranean countries such as Italy or Greece, whose agricultural shortcomings are well known. MORPHOLOGY OF THE PENINSULA. If\n\nwe are to understand the economic infrastructure of Spain, the study of its relief is essential. It is well known that Spain occupies the second place in Europe, after Switzerland, for the ruggedness of its terrain. But this fact is still more important if we keep in mind the blocked-off and compartment-like arrangement of this relief. To use Salvador de Madariaga's happy phrase, the whole Meseta is like \"the citadel of a Spanish castle,\" indicating that the plateau occupies the position of a castle in relation to a block of territory which separates it, like a bastion, from the European continent. If we examine a hypsometric, or altitude, table of the Hispanic Peninsula, we will observe the following: 15% of the territory has an altitude between 0 and 200 meters; 17%, between 200 and 500; and the rest, 68%, more than 500 meters. And 42% falls between 100 and 500 meters. Such a geographical structure gives rise to unfavorable conditions for agricultural and commercial life, all the more so when the extreme abruptness of the relief is an additional complicating factor. If we leave out the Ebro and Guadalquivir valleys and some few highlands in New Castile, Leon, and Old Castile, the mountain ranges cross the territory of the Peninsula like barriers, and sometimes like actual walls. If the Pyrenees rise like a mountain frontier between Europe and Spain, access to the sea from the Meseta is no less difficult, on the Cantabrian side as well as on the Mediterranean or the Atlantic. To sum up, then, we should keep in mind three chief facts about the tectonics and morphology of the Peninsula: (1) geographic cantonalism; that is, division of the territory into separate compartments not easily accessible among themselves, (2) the unconnected 12\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOF SPANISH ECONOMIC\n\nHISTORY\n\nnature of the hydrographic system, which confers geographic reality on the tectonic division, and (3) the abnormal relief picture. The constant and enormous differences in altitude offer great difficulties to the development of communications. The study of climate is of prime importance in any consideration of economic history. Our point of reference must necessarily be that of the present-day climate. However, when we study the possibilities of the Spanish economy in the past, we must keep in mind that our climate is not necessarily that of former times. There is a dearth of data on this subject, but we do know that ever since Neolithic times, that is, since about 4000 B.C., there has been a prolonged period of desiccation in our peninsula and in general all over the tropical zone. This phenomenon has given rise to the steppe-like character so typical of the country. It is possible that this desiccation became more pronounced at the beginning of the 14th century, as certain changes which took place in the southernmost regions of Spain (in Almeria, for example) seem to indicate. But we cannot trace its development exactly. On the other hand, modern studies indicate that during certain periods in modern times Spain experienced long periods of drought. One of them probably occurred at the beginning and toward the middle of the 16th century. Others took place in the course of the 17th and 18th centuries. The economic history of Spain would make great progress if we could learn the exact nature of these oscillations between humidity and aridity, which constitute the essential problem for proper comprehension of our agricultural past. At the present day, a major part of the Hispanic Peninsula is arid. The French geographer Brunhes divided it into two regions, humid Iberia and dry Iberia. To do so he used the 500 mm. isohyetal line, which runs, approximately, to the north of Barcelona, follows the southern slopes of the Pyrenees, extends almost to the Picos de Europa, surrounds the Cantabrian System and the mountains of Zamora and Leon in a great arc, descends toward the southwest, penetrates deeply into the Meseta by way of the Central System, and then, returning to its northeasterly-southwesterly direction, disappears in the Algarve, in southern Portugal. To the north of this dividing line humid Iberia receives more than 500 mm. of precipitation yearly, and dry Iberia, to the south of it, less than 500 HISPANIC CLIMATE.\n\n13\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nOF SPANISH ECONOMIC HISTORY\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nSiSSSS\n\nS S S S .S*-S χ*S v·S S S \\S S *Sν · !S^ -Sν γSί - . *S· .

This division is rather rough, for what really matters is not the quantity of rain but its distribution over the course of the year and its retention in the soil. Two geographers, Dantin and Revenga, have established a map of the mean annual dryness of the Penin­ sula, which corrects Brunhes's and makes it more accurate. Humid Iberia is composed of three zones: one in the North which includes the Pyrenees, the Cantabrian System, the mountains of Leon and Zamora, Galicia, the Central System, and northern Portugal as far as the Tagus; and two in the South, that of the Sierra de Cazorla (sources of the Guadalquivir and Segura rivers) and that of the Sierra Grazalema in the province of Cadiz. The rest of Spain is in­ cluded in dry Iberia, which has four zones of extreme aridity (Ebro valley, the middle basin of the Duero, the plains of New Castile, and the lower Guadalquivir basin) and one almost desert zone (the southeastern coast from Murcia to Almeria). It is said that humid Iberia comprises less than 32% of the Span­ ish territory, while the dry zone makes up more than 68%. Actu­ ally, the most accurate figures are the following: the arid region contains 314,000 sq. km., of which 66,000 receive from 500 to 600 14\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOF SPANISH ECONOMIC\n\nHISTORY\n\nmm. annual rainfall, 180,000 from 400 to 500 mm., and 68,000, less than 400 mm. If we keep in mind that these last two portions have a total area of 248,000 sq. km., or almost half of the territory, we will realize the extraordinary importance of the problem of aridity in Spain. The causes of this situation are to be found in the excessive evaporation characteristic of regions situated along the 45th parallel latitude north, and also in the lack of moisture resulting from the climatic mechanism. Three climatic centers influence Spain: to the northeast the Siberian low-pressure area, which is cold and dry; to the northwest the Icelandic low, which is damp and temperate; and to the southwest the Azores high, which is hot. The rains produced by these two low-pressure areas, which are responsible for the fertility of Western Europe, rarely reach our latitudes; the Azores highpressure area keeps them away from the Peninsula. Only in very favorable circumstances, especially during equinoctial periods, when the Azores high approaches the equator, do rains from the Atlantic lows reach the Peninsula. The success of a given harvest depends on these rains, and so, consequently, does the prosperity of the country. As a result of this climatic situation, steppes (or rather, those regions which have been rendered barren by man) occupy 7% of the peninsular territory. The Spanish steppes can be classified in the following groups: (1) southeastern, from Cape Gata to Cape Nao, (2) the Baetic steppes, (3) those of New Castile (from Albacete to Madrid, including La Mancha), (4) the region around Valladolid, and (5) the steppes of the Ebro valley. There is no doubt that these steppe-like zones have played a decisive role in the evolution of Spanish economic history. can be deduced from the foregoing, the arrangement of the hydrographic network derives from two factors, (1) the course of the great tectonic lines which form the northwestsoutheast pattern, caused by the movements of the Hercynian period, and the northeast-southwest pattern formed by the Pyrenean movements, and (2) the geographic cantonalism arising from tectonics in general. These two phenomena, together with the factor of humidity, act to determine the three essential characteristics of Spanish hydrograHYDROGRAPHY. AS\n\n15\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOF SPANISH ECONOMIC HISTORY\n\nmaps shows aridity in terms of the thermo-pluviometric index, relating temperature to rainfall; index rises with temperature and with deficient rainfall. Figures MEAN ANNUAL ARIDITY IN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA.—This\n\n2 it is still possible to speak of areas without aridity problems; aridity is slight between 2 and 3 and very noticeable between 3 and 4; between 4 and 5 it is extreme, and above 5 it is desert-like (after DANTIN and REVENGA).\n\nphy. In the first place, rivers have little volume. We need only compare a few statistics of Spanish rivers with other European rivers to realize how little water flows into the former (the largest Spanish river, the Ebro, flows at the rate of 700 cubic meters per second at its mouth, while the rate of the Po is 1,800 and the Rhone, 1,880, not to mention the great rivers such as the Rhine, Danube, Volga, etc.). In the second place, there is variation of flow: because of the unpredictable character of the rainfall, the volume of Spanish rivers is extremely irregular. This variability, ranging from double volume to fifteen times, reaches enormous proportions during high-water periods and leads to catastrophic floods. This is especially true of the rivers and streambeds of the Mediterranean littoral, where water volume can rise from almost nothing to 3,000 and 4,000 cubic meters per second. This fact presupposes great difficulty in the natural exploitation of rivers. Only at the price of enormous 16\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOF SPANISH ECONOMIC\n\nHISTORY\n\neffort has man been able to reduce these wild variations partially and make use of river water for irrigation. The third characteristic is the abruptness of the hydrographic contour. No Spanish river presents a gentle course between its source and its mouth; on the contrary, a number of steep drops occur. The rivers of the Meseta usually have two, one when they emerge from the mountains where they originate and another at the place where they encounter the change of altitude between the Meseta and the Portuguese zone. The Ebro is still more complicated, for it experiences three drops: the first when it reaches the Meseta, the second when flowing out of the Meseta through the Pancorbo passes, and the third when it encounters the gorges of the Catalan shoreline system. With rare exceptions, then, Spanish rivers are not suitable for irrigation because their waters are confined between steep banks. Some have been used along part of their course, and are still being used, for navigation; but this is not common. To utilize them for hydroelectric or agricultural purposes necessitates huge regulatory systems such as reservoirs and dams, and even in these cases there is a problem with the large volume of mud and sediment deposited in them because of their great tendency to flood. Spain's plant cover corresponds in general to that of other Mediterranean steppes. Lack of forests is characteristic, although in this regard we should not base our opinion entirely on present figures, for it is evident that before the 19th century—that is, before large areas of communal and mortmain land were brought under cultivation—there were more forested zones in Spain than there are today. Descriptions which have come down to us from the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries speak, in fact, of large forested zones where today we find only steppes or moorland. Generally speaking, meadow land is found in humid Iberia and steppes and subtropical plants in dry Iberia. Forests of characteristic mountain type exist in the Pyrenees, the Cantabrian System, the mountains of Leon and Zamora, in the Central System, the Sierras of Moncayo, Oca, and Demanda, and in the Montes Universales and similar chains. In this connection the limits of the spruce and beech tree and the esparto plant are important. The southern limit of the European\n\nPLANT COVER.\n\n17\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOF SPANISH ECONOMIC\n\nHISTORY\n\nspruce takes in all of the Pyrenees region and extends toward Catalonia, including the Montseny massif. The southern limit of the beech tree is also significant; it covers almost all of Catalonia, then turns to the north of the Montes Universales, runs along the entire crest of the Central System on its western side and reaches as far as the Sierra de la Estrella in Portugal. The northern limit of esparto grass is typical of a large part of the steppe regions, for it begins near Tarragona, crosses the Ebro region to the north of Saragossa, curves toward the south of the Central System, and takes in a large part of La Mancha and the whole northern portion of the Baetic System. Throughout these zones we can observe a considerable difference between the plant cover of Spain and the rest of Europe. But in addition to this natural plant cover, there exists another which is manmade. We refer here essentially to the vega * and the huerta,** both creations of man in the face of Nature. We shall speak of these later, when we discuss man's reaction to the unfavorable soil of Spain. Even though we admit that Spain's geographical relief has always made collective life difficult, we can easily see that mountain defiles and passes must have had great influence as natural means of communication, for such passes have been used from earliest times for travel and commerce. Our mental picture of the present communications network is a radial one, branching out from Madrid; but in fact the natural routes of communication in the Peninsula run from north to south and divide it into four great zones. The first joins Galicia to Portugal, especially by means of the Atlantic coastal plains; the second joins Asturias to Leon, Extremadura, and western Andalusia, through the pass of Pajares and the valley of the Alagon; the third connects the province of Santander with Old Castile, New Castile, and Andalusia by means of the passes of Reinosa, Guadarrama, and Despenaperros; the fourth, much more limited, connects Catalonia with Valencia and Murcia by means of the passes along the Mediterranean coast. Among these four zones, there are a number of centers of conNATURAL COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n* Intensively cultivated flatland, often a river valley. ** A plot of irrigated land, intensively cultivated. 18\n\nlarge circles stand for the chief centers of communication. The most important mountain passes are shown on the map by two parallel lines.\n\nNATURAL ROUTES IN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA.—The\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE\n\nOF SPANISH ECONOMIC\n\nHISTORY\n\nnection which correspond to the isolated compartments into which the Peninsula is divided. Between the first and the second zones there are few important connections, and this explains up to a point the political division of Spain and Portugal. However, between the second and the third, numerous points of connection exist, especially in the north between Castile and Leon. Aragon occupies a prominent place between the third and fourth zones and serves to connect Castile with Catalonia by means of the JaIOn valley and the passes of Fraga. And finally we must stress the role of general correlation played by the territory to the south of the curve of the Central System, that territory whose capitals have been successively Toledo and Madrid. It is in this region that the routes of communication of all four zones come together. The geophysical position of a country is determined by its location in respect to the great mercantile, trade, or political routes in any particular period. In this regard it must be realized that the Hispanic Peninsula enjoys a wholly favorable geophysical position, for it is at the center of the crossroads formed by the two great lines of communication of Western Europe and the Mediterranean, from France to North Africa on the one hand, and from the Atlantic to the Near East on the other. This axis of communications has meant that the Hispanic Peninsula always exercised a very important role in all periods of history, and that in consequence its situation in regard to large-scale international commerce has been preponderant at times, enabling the Peninsula to benefit from outside stimuli or influencing its economic and financial life. GEOPHYSICAL POSITION OF SPAIN.\n\n20\n\n3 · Man in Spanish Economic Life\n\nHistorical anthropology is a new science which was introduced in Spain by Professors Aranzadi and Bosch Gimpera. They blazed a trail which has later been followed by their pupils and by a number of excellent researchers (Pericot, Caro Baroja, Alcobe, etc.). It is through the work of these men that today we are beginning to glimpse part of the truth. It is to be hoped that in the future this partial knowledge will be sufficiently expanded to cover completely the panorama of Hispanic ethnological history. But for now, any evolutionary sketch such as the one we present here is subject to many corrections. We shall make no mention of Neanderthal man. He left few traces in the Peninsula and disappeared at the end of the Lower Paleolithic period; one branch in the evolution of the hominids disappeared with him. He was probably eliminated from the historical scene by the so-called Cro-Magnon man, who belonged to the modern human species, Homo sapiens. Cro-Magnon man arrived in the Peninsula at the dawn of the Upper Paleolithic period, bringing with him a typical tool culture, the same as has been found in certain deposits at La Gravette in France. Therefore the Cro-Magnons are known as Gravettians. This means that by 50,000 B.C. Spain was inhabited by groups of modern men of a homogeneous race and culture. They were nomadic hunters, the first Hispanic peoples in the strict sense of the word. During the Upper Paleolithic period the Gravettians continued to be the chief basis of population, but then a series of emigrations occurred which lasted many years, sometimes hundreds of years, and which were related to the slow shifting of the hunting grounds. The first and heaviest infiltration was of a race of hunters who had adopted an arrowhead of a special type with which they hunted very successfully. These were the so-called Aurignacians. They were near relatives of the Gravettians. These groups have achieved\n\nFORMATION OF POPULATION IN HISPANIC ANTIQUITY.\n\n21\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\nconsiderable fame, for they created the type of art known as FrancoCantabrian, among whose masterworks are the cave paintings of Altamira. During this same epoch, though at an uncertain date, Spain was invaded by very warlike men, inventors of the bow and consequently of the swift arrow. They are called Solutreans. We know relatively little about this people, for prehistorians are still not sure whether they came from the north of Europe or from North Africa. Originally, by one route or another, they must have come from Asia. As a result of the fusion of these contrasting types, an important culture was formed on the Atlantic side of Europe, the one called Magdalenian. To this culture belong the highest achievements of the cave art of Altamira, of other places in the Cantabrian region, and in southern France. But it does not seem that the Magdalenians were a differentiated people. After the Solutreans, we should make some mention of Capstan man. Some years ago it was believed that the first African tribes emigrated to Spain sometime at the end of the Paleolithic period. This emigration was that of the Capsians (so-called from the site of El Gafsa, in Tunisia). It was thought that they had produced the paintings in the caves of the Levantine and Catalan coasts, with scenes of men dancing, fighting, and hunting, which contrast so strongly with those of Altamira. But today even their existence is somewhat in doubt, and in any case their influence has been moved forward to the beginning of the Neolithic period. After Neolithic man we are on much firmer ground, although there are many problems and questions still unsolved. By that time there was a mass of population in the Peninsula which can be called Mediterranean, and which represented the racial type that came to be dominant in the country. To say \"Mediterranean race\" means a dolichocephalic people of medium height, with more or less curly hair, slender and fairly dark-skinned. This man, the probable successor of the Epigravettians of the Paleolithic period, was faced by a sensational new situation. Several warrior and commercial peoples from the Eastern Mediterranean had become established in the southeastern part of the Peninsula (4,000 B.C.) and had established some fortified castles there, organized a political system and had begun to cultivate the soil. These people soon broke out from the Almeria region where their strongholds were located and advanced toward the west (Andalusia) and north (Valencia and Catalonia), 22\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\nand for more than a thousand years (2,000-500 B.C.) were masters of the country (Bronze Age). This Almerian people, probably of Oriental origin, aided a slow immigration into the Peninsula of North Africans, who were the catalyzing element of the so-called Iberians. In fact, it appears that these latter people were the result of the fusion, in Andalusia and the Levant, of the North Africans with various Neolithic groups (probably the descendants of the Epigravettians), all dominated by an Almerian minority of Oriental origin. At the beginning of the first millennium B.C., this situation changed radically. The Pre-Iberians who had dominated the Peninsula during the Bronze Age were submitted to formidable pressure from a European people. These brachiocephalic people, blond, blueeyed, and tall, were the Celts. The first invasion was that of the people of the so-called \"Rhine urn culture,\" who appeared in Catalonia about the 9th century B.C. But the two great Celtic invasions belong to the period between the 9th and the 6th centuries. The immigrants advanced by stages along both sides of the mountain barriers. Some invaded the northern part of the Catalonian region. But the greatest Celtic infiltration was the one which, breaking through the Fuenterrabia pass, went toward Galicia on the one hand and on the other toward the south of Portugal, and finally, by way of the two Castiles, to Andalusia. The new settlers were different from the Iberians, not only in their physical but also in their mental makeup. Some authorities believe that it was the Celts who gave the peoples of the central mountains of the Peninsula their qualities of command and their sense of political organization. But there is room for much argument about this. Such was the situation encountered by the colonizing peoples, the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, and the Greeks, when they successively arrived in the Peninsula from the 10th to the 5 th centuries B.C. And it is the situation which they have described for us in their works. However, it would be audacious to say that thanks to them Spanish ethnography is perfectly clear today. Speaking in general terms, we can state only that the Iberians were dominant in Andalusia and the Levant, that the Celts predominated—at least as a ruling minority—in the rest of Spain, and that in one place in the Peninsula, namely the Iberian System, there existed a fusion of peoples from which the Celtiberians originated. 23\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\nOne question remains to which we have not alluded before—that raised by the Pyrenean race. Traces of it exist from remotest times in the dolmen culture of the Pyrenees; in modern times we find a proof of its survival in the Basques and in the people of certain Pyrenean valleys extending into Catalonia. What is the origin of this special human type characterized by specific anthropological traits and an archaic language of mysterious ancestry? There are many theories but few proven facts. PEOPLES OF THE HISTORICAL INVASIONS. Spanish\n\nanthropology has changed very little in its basic structure since the end of the 5th century B.C. There have been, however, certain changes in the ruling classes, but they are neither so numerous nor so important as was once believed. Let us take a look at them: The Romans ruled the Peninsula for seven centuries (2nd century B.C. to 5th century A.D.), but their only contribution to the Spanish ethnos was in the form of small groups of retired colonial functionaries, some merchants, military garrisons, and the like. There was no question of Roman infiltration en masse. It was a colonization of an urban type and even so was limited to peripheral regional centers. In the second place, there was the Jewish element. It is well known that there are theories, such as that of the German professor Werner Sombart, which make the history of the capitalist movement revolve around this race. And related to these theories there is a general opinion which holds that the economic prosperity of the country ended at the moment when Ferdinand and Isabella expelled the Jews from Spain. We shall leave until later a scientific assessment of this problem, but it is of interest to make a few observations about the development of the Jewish population in Spain. The Hebrews became established in the Peninsula during the period of Roman domination, as a consequence of the general movement of dispersion known as the Diaspora. After the 2nd century A.D. we find Jewish colonies in Hispanic port cities, especially in those of the South, where commerce was most active. These groups developed considerably and, in spite of the hostility shown them by the Visigoths (who even tried to expel them during the 7th century), survived the Visigothic period and acquired great power during the Moslem period, which was one of great prosperity for them. Indis24\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\npensable in the finances and economic life of the Christian kingdoms, the Jews were the real rulers of the economy during the 12th and 13th centuries. After that time they began to decline, although the conversos (renegade Jews) took over their economic power. The only—but very important—anthropological investigations which have been carried out in medieval Jewish cemeteries in Spain show that there was absolutely no anthropological difference between an \"old Christian\" and a Jew. This is a scientific proof which should be kept in mind. The Spanish Jew of the 13th century was identical to a Spanish Christian of the same time, except in two important things—he had a different religion and a very different economic mentality. This latter quality was the one which the Jews, when Christian pressure was most intense, passed on to the conversos and judaizantes (Jewish-leaning Christians). How many Jews were there in Spain? As a maximum (and we shall study this figure at the appropriate time) there were some 200,000 at the time of their expulsion by Ferdinand and Isabella. They were few in number, but the number is an unimportant factor. What was important was their wealth and their economic capacity; and thus it is possible that the financial and mental drain caused by the loss of the Jews was difficult to recoup within the historical circumstances of their expulsion. The third group which we must include in our ethnographic study is that of the so-called Visigoths. It is a common misconception that during the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries all the inhabitants of Spain were Visigoths. Nothing could be farther from the truth. There never was a Visigothic Spain, but only a Visigothic people who infiltrated the Peninsula during the 5th century A.D. As a demographic element we can estimate their number at some 200,000. The majority of these people settled in the Castilian mountains and in the eastern plateau region of the Duero river. The nobles and the military class carried out some duties at court and in the provinces, where they represented no more than a bureaucratic superstructure. They became in large part absorbed by the Hispanic inhabitants, that is, the ancient population made up of Mediterranean men who had been civilized by Rome. Some survived over the course of the centuries to become an integral element in the great landholding nobility. The fourth group is the Moslems. Anthropologically it is ex25\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC\n\nLIFE\n\ntremely varied. Among its members are Arabs, of pure Semitic stock; Syrians, who were also within the Semitic area; and Berbers, settlers from the other side of the Strait of Gibraltar. This last group not only crossed the Strait with the first Arab armies, but through trade and later invasions had prolonged contact with the peoples of the Peninsula. We should like to know just how large the number of Moslems was. Probably there were also relatively few of them. At that time an invasion such as the Moslem one in Spain could be carried out by armies of 10,000 men. But this does not leave profound traces in the anthropology of a country, and though it is possible that throughout the Emirate and the Caliphate of Cordova there were frequent demographic relationships between the two sides of the Strait, infiltration was probably a purely local phenomenon confined to Andalusia. But this is not quite the end of the story. A fifth racial element began to be introduced into the country starting in the 11th century. It was a slow demographic infiltration, but undoubtedly a more important one than those of the Romans, Visigoths, and Moslems. We refer to the Franks (Languedocians and French). Beginning in the 10th century the greatly overcrowded population of Gaul scattered in all directions, and one of these directions was toward the south. By the 11th century we find the Franks established not only in the cities, such as Pamplona, Jaca, Toledo, and Avila, but great tracts of agrarian repopulation in Castile were the work of Frenchmen as well as Aragonese and Navarrese, or Basques. But if we consider the situation from the 11th century to our day, we will find that a great wave of Frenchmen crossed the Pyrenees starting in the second half of the 15 th century. The intensity of this phenomenon reached its highest point at the end of the 16th century, but continued in succeeding centuries in the form of a slow infiltration of a mercantile and artisan character. A precise study of French immigration into Spain, about which we have relatively little data, would help us to comprehend certain essential phenomena in modern Spanish economic history. The successive racial waves we have been discussing all had to face a single reality—Spanish geography. For man as an economic entity, geography means soil, especially plant-producing soil that must be conCONQUEST OF THE SOIL: AGRICULTURE AND HERDING.\n\n26\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\nquered, for utilization of mineral wealth is a phenomenon which comes after occupation of the territory. And this action can take place only through cultivation of the soil or through grazing. And, as we have already pointed out, there are two clearly differentiated botanical landscapes in Spain as well as two mineral ones (humid Spain and dry Spain; siliceous Spain and calcareous Spain); therefore the types of life are also dual—on the one hand agricultural, and on the other herding. Given the climatic conditions of the Peninsula, the conquest of the soil through agriculture has been slow and difficult work and has taken place, specifically, along the coastlines. The classic phenomenon goes under the name of conquest of the Mediterranean \"hoyas,\" or basins. In the course of this process a perfected agriculture has been developed, based on the utilization of water and of fruit trees. Vineyards and olive groves require less care, but all these types of planting need an uninterrupted tradition, with a tendency toward a stable homelife and individual agrarian enterprise. This was clearly shown in Italy, by a similar process of geographical adaptation, in the special principles of Roman law, which is based on that of individual property. Grazing exists side by side with this type of life. In the Mediterranean countries grazing is divided between steppes and mountains. In the Iberian Peninsula, this involves a relationship between the people of the North (Pyrenees, Cantabrian mountains) and the steppes of the South, especially La Mancha and Extremadura. The typical kind of life is nomadic and is exactly opposite to the life we defined before: in place of stability, nomadism; in place of uninterrupted tradition, chance; instead of the individual principle, collectivism (in regard to livestock as well as to agrarian concepts). If these types of life are indeed true, for so they have been studied by geographers and recognized by historians, it is legitimate for us to ask whether they have created and defined a mental attitude. We consider that this is in fact the case. Every primary human process creates a mental structure in the course of time. In the case of the Mediterranean and Andalusian farmers, such a mental attitude has been developed by successive groundbreakings of this inhospitable shore, infertile in comparison with other agricultural regions of the earth. That is, it has not arisen out of a simple type of agricultural life but by an uninterrupted process of occupation and 27\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\nimprovement of the soil. As I have mentioned in one of my books, Brief Survey of Catalonia (Noticia de Cataluna), the Catalans have colonized and conquered the soil eight times since the 2nd century A.D.; and the same could be said of Valencia, Murcia, and even, perhaps, of Andalusia, although in the last case the cultural and mental succession was interrupted by the Castilian conquest of the 13th century. In regard to the mentality created by a herding type of life, we should accept the opinion of Professor Ramon Carande, who has studied the problem posed by the extension of Castilian nomadic pasturing into Andalusia and America. Carande holds that nomadism in the Meseta has given rise to those great environmental structures, those great desires for space, which obviously go along with this type of life, and at the same time to the spirit of command, of colonization, and of hopeful anticipation which characterize Castilian expansion not only in Spain but everywhere in the world. AU this has worked to the detriment of spiritual application to practical realities, and we will not be surprised to discover, in the course of the present pages, that in many ways Castile has never been able to go beyond the precapitalist stage ih her economic mentality. Let us understand by the concept of wealth the system of mental attitudes regarding material values. The problem raised by this concept is very profound, especially in regard to Spain, for it affects nothing less than the role which she has played in Western civilization. Ever since this role was disputed in the 18 th century by Masson de Morvilliers, in the famous article on Spain in the Encyclopedie Frangaise, the controversy it has aroused has recognized neither limits of prudence nor periods of truce. Leaving this polemic to one side, we shall contribute a series of concrete facts to a future critical study of the Spaniard's behavior in regard to economic life. It is obvious that the differing process of conquest of the soil and the dual type of life which arose in Spain out of the numerous immigrations and the utilization of agricultural land have given birth to a concept of wealth, elementary if you will but dual also. What characterizes the peasant? Traditionalism in his concept of the value of land; limited resources; tireless and individual labor; an economy based on the family; a sense of continuity; thrift. What THE SPANIARD'S CONCEPT OF WEALTH.\n\n28\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\ncharacterizes the nomadic herdsman? Relativity of economic values; tendency toward monopoly; adoption of a more or less wellorganized collectivism; a group economy; discontinuity of effort; and finally, repugnance for rationalized forms of economic life. There is a third concept of wealth, that of the merchant. This is the typically European concept, the one that links the individual to the business enterprise; continuity to ambition; thrift to investment; the ambition for power to the social necessity of that power; the individual to collectivity. This is the concept of wealth which created the modern economy in England, the United States, France, and Germany. However, it has appeared in Spain very infrequently. Even today we resist such a concept, to the point that it can be said in public, \"Spain's genius is anti-economic.\" This is the attitude of a nomadic mentality. Many other signs reveal to us, however, that in opposition to this rather Quixotic attitude there is an everyday reality which tends to overcome it. One of the tasks of Spanish economic history is to capture the development of the normal concept of wealth in Hispanic man. The problem of the concept of wealth is connected with that of the technical sense. It is evident that the Spanish contribution to the general development of technology, so vital to economic coherence, has been minimal. The controversy aroused by this point has come to be linked with Spain's role in the whole order of Western civilization. Some have lamented the fact that her contribution has been so meager; others, giving more value to spiritual than to material factors, have applauded the triumph of Spain's genius over the materialism of technology. AU of this seems mere verbiage to us. Today we are able to see the problem a bit more clearly, since Professor Lopez Ibor has faced it honestly and has presented the question from a scientific point of view. Lopez Ibor follows two essential lines of reasoning, one related to historical time and the other to Spanish psychology. According to him, at the very time when the taste for science, and secondarily for technology, began to develop in Europe, Spain and the Spaniards were in a very difficult situation. In the 17th century the Spaniard was tired; his great world undertaking had been a failure; he lacked spirit, had no energy, and all of this caused a feeling of backwardness which he subsequently found hard to overcome. So much for THE TECHNICAL SENSE.\n\n29\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\nthe chronological position. As for the factor pertaining to the Spanish temperament, a number of points should be noted, he says. (And when we refer to Lopez Ibor and the Spaniard he speaks of, let us remember that he is referring specifically to the Castilian Spaniard, the one he knows best and to whom he alludes most frequently.) What, then, does Professor Lopez Ibor see in the Castilian? First, a total indifference towards Nature, physical nature, that gentle and attractive landscape which man constantly encounters except in a spot so monotonous, though of such lofty spiritual values, as Castile (the Castile of the Duero and La Mancha, be it understood, not the Castile of the mountains). In Catalonia, and in general all along the Mediterranean coast, the situation is quite different; there we find overflowing natural beauty, and everything which turns toward the esthetic and sensuous is lost in a concern with purely technological matters. In the Basque region and the Cantabrian littoral, Nature in general exercises the same balancing role as in the rest of Europe: she predisposes man to admire and study her. Second, the Castilian's temperamental preference for human and personal values, not those which are cosmic and abstract; he cares nothing for the figure and the symbol. The Spaniard wants to encounter the person, to know who he is, to find out who is hidden behind those figures and those symbols. This is why Spain's economy, like her politics, is a purely personal factor. All this undoubtedly represents a fundamental value which Spain has maintained against, or in the face of, or surrounded by, that technological civilization which Europe has created. But in the economic sphere the difficulty of seizing these abstract values has made the task of the Spaniard infinitely more difficult. Third, the bigotry of the concept of the hidalgo (which we consider to be an acquired historical mentality rather than a temperamental factor): the Spaniard's vocation for glory, both in battle and in literature; the sense of what is noble and hidalguesque; contempt for servile occupations and anything representing sustained labor. Fourth, social disinterestedness. Rather than disinterestedness —that is the word used by Lopez Ibor—we would define this con30\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\ncept as an absolute lack of curiosity. It stems from the conviction that either we are the best, and furthermore the cleverest, of men, or that our affairs are going very well and that we need only copy what others do in order to have them go even better. This enormous lack of curiosity, which has characterized Spanish history since the 16th century, is obviously one of the most essential features of Spanish psychology. Professor Lopez Ibor has omitted one point which, in our opinion, is essential and serves to complete his exposition of the problem—that of the Spaniard's repugnance for confronting intellectual problems which touch on orthodox positions. We need not mention the Inquisition, that focal point of the \"Black Legend.\" The Inquisition is only one of a number of myths which have been put forward to explain obscurely what is clearer than daylight. If the Spaniard had felt the necessity of saying something to the world of technology, he would have done so with or without the Inquisition. The fact is that he had little to say. And the cause of this was the loss of cultural contact between the Spanish universities and those of Europe decreed by Philip II, expressing the general feeling of a country which demanded \"waterproofing\" the frontiers in the face of the risk of heresy (1565). And since science is the product of collaboration among minds which are a priori dissident and nonconformist, and technology is the result of this collaboration applied to practical matters, a slow retardation set in regarding the acceptance of new scientific ideas and new systems and methods of work. Therefore, when the more progressive Spaniards came into contact with Europe in the 18 th century, they found that they suffered from a formidable technological deficit. The history of the 19th century in Spain has been studied as a great conflict between rival political factions. This is a purely superficial view of history. In reality, the shape of the 19th century in Spain is the bitter struggle of the few to master technology, that technology which had been forged in Europe and which was continually slipping out of our grasp. THE SENSE OF ORGANIZATION. The modern world has combined wealth and technology into a system of capitalistic organization (and in certain countries a socialistic organization, according to the 31\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\nmode of understanding concepts such as property, distribution of national income, and organization of business). What characterizes the development of capitalism in Europe? Three facts. First, the depersonalization of business. Business becomes something apart from the individual businessman. A man became a capitalist when he was able to separate his capital from his operating fund and to invest it as an abstract sum which would gain or lose money by itself. This depersonalization is essential to the understanding of capitalism. Second, the mystique of business. Capitalism thinks of the prosperity of a business enterprise as a sign of the blessing of Providence. Thus various authors (Troeltsch, Weber, etc.) have been able to write and sustain the proposition that capitalism is linked to the birth of Protestantism, for the latter had changed the character of works of redemption, making it consist not only in spiritual good works but in the favorable progress of business. And the third point is the necessity of business as a mark of social distinction. Beginning in the 17th and 18th centuries, men went into business not only to make money, but also because it conferred solidity, security, and comfort; it came to be felt that a person who possessed neither a factory nor money nor social position was a failure. If we contrast these three principles with those we have previously mentioned as defining the Spaniard's economic psychology, we willfinda diametrical difference. It is very difficult for the Spaniard to depersonalize himself in regard to business. The home, the business, and the owner form an unbreakable circle. The business mystique does not exist. There has always existed, and there exists in Spain today, a mystique of humanity, a mystique of religion, a mystique of lofty spiritual values, but not one of business. Only a handful of Spaniards have ever believed that Paradise could be attained by way of business. And as for the third point, until the 18th century there were laws forbidding any noble, or any hidalgo, to engage in manual labor. Here we have a radical incompatibility between the concept of nobility of blood and that of money. What Spain has had through the centuries, ever since Ferdinand and Isabella came into contact with the New World, has been the bureaucratic concept of business organization. This is a very different thing from the capitalistic concept of organization of the economy. 32\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\nDoes this mean, as has been asserted so many times, that Spain is an Oriental country in her economy? No, although in principle this is not an untenable theory. The fact is, however, that the Spaniard, by virtue of geographic structure, of type of life, of historical mentality, of links with other European countries, is a full member of Western culture. But within that culture, and precisely because of those psychological characteristics, he is someone apart. He is a disturbance, an abnormality; but he is necessary and vital. Spain cannot be condemned for being an abnormality. The world needs to be abnormal in order to progress; that is, it needs contrasts in order to advance along the road to perfection, which is not only material but ethical. But the basic Spanish tendency is toward what is European, and this not because the Europeans are different, but rather because the Spaniard himself is European and therefore cannot escape from that orbit into which he was drawn by Rome and within which, through the ages, he has found himself located, at some times comfortably, at others uncomfortably, but always recognizing it as his true home. SPAIN AND EUROPE: HISPANIC ISOLATIONISM.\n\nHow can we explain this abnormality? Undoubtedly through the factor of Hispanic isolationism. For long periods in her national life Spain has lived isolated and ignored. Her mountain walls, less high than the spiritual ones she has erected, have contributed in some degree to produce this phenomenon. And this has brought on a series of problems which gave rise to economic tensions and eventually to important revolutions once those barriers were broken down. Hispanic isolationism was notorious between the 8th and 10th centuries, although at that time it had little importance. It was overcome in the course of the 11th to 15th centuries when, starting with the French emigrations, Spain was in close contact with the rest of Europe. But ever since the middle of the 16th century and almost to the present day, the process has dragged considerably. There have been cases, of a political and military nature, in which Spain has intervened in Europe and vice versa, but they have relatively little weight. What is important is the attitude of ignorance which has prevailed, despite the development of a spirit of imitation in clothing styles and intellectual thought, in science and economics, and despite the minority groups who, ever since the end of the 17th 33\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\ncentury, have considered it their essential function to put Spain solidly in the European mainstream. CANTONALISM AND REGIONAL NUCLEI OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.\n\nThe geographical compartments into which the Spanish territory is divided have resulted in economic cantonalism. In fact, one can hardly speak of an economic history of Spain up to the end of the 18th century, and even until well into the 19th. Even in the 17th century regional economies still existed which were unmistakable and were in fact differentiated by law and custom: a Castilian economy, a Valencian economy, a Catalan economy, etc. If we go back to earlier periods, this regional economic diversity corresponds to the division of the peninsular territory into independent kingdoms. Hispanic economic cantonalism has been imposed by three conditions. The first of these is geography, the second history, and the third the mentality arising from the social structure. In connection with geography we have already mentioned the existence of regional frameworks which give personality to each one of the zones into which the Peninsula can be thought of as being divided. As for history, economic cantonalism developed as far back as the earliest prehistoric times, persisted during the entire ancient period, and finally acquired consistency during the Middle Ages when the regional economies took on very different rhythms. And as for mentality, since it is the product of both history and geography, it tends to concentrate in what we might call regional nuclei. We believe that four such nuclei can be distinguished: the Castilian, the Catalan, the Northern, and the Andalusian. Everything we have been saying corresponds to the first of these, for general considerations pertaining to the concept of wealth, and to economic organization and the technological capabilities of the Spanish people, have been formulated on the basis of peculiarly Castilian attitudes. As a regional nucleus of Hispanic economic activity, the Catalan contribution is distinguished by a number of typical factors: strong will, aptitude for work, curiosity, a technological turn of mind, and a family type of capitalism. These conditions have not always obtained. For example, the aptitude for work which is so characteristic of the Catalans of today was not in evidence during a large part 34\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\nof the modern age; during the first two centuries of this period all historical evidence combines to deny it. Only after the last years of the 17th century did this aptitude begin to be considered as typical by travelers in the country and by those who studied working life and commerce. Similarly, curiosity seems to have been awakened at the same time as aptitude for work—around 1680. As for the technological spirit, we should point out that the Catalan has real adoration for technology and that he is especially clever at solving mechanical problems. His adoration for the machine is a phenomenon of collective psychology. On the other hand, the Catalan has not entered fully into the ultimate form of capitalistic organization (the large incorporated company), for in Catalonia the mediumsized personal business is typical. But against the opinion of those who have theorized about this (Pi y Sunyer, Tallada, etc.), holding that it is a defect in the individual and collective temperament, we think we have proved that it was an accidental condition which appeared during the course of the 19th century and became fixed by the colonial crisis at the beginning of the 20th. The Northern economy is characterized by vital curiosity, by a spirit of technological progress very much in the European mold, and in particular by capitalism in business. This trait, principally associated with the Basques, possibly derives from their capacity for large general concepts. St. Ignatius of Loyola is an example of the union of the mystic spirit with that of a great undertaking, creating a large militant organization at the service of the Church. In much the same way, the great Basque (and North Castilian and Asturian) businessmen of the 19th and 20th centuries have united the mystique of business with an impressive industrial and financial capability. Andalusian economic psychology requires careful examination, and indeed we do not know whether this has ever been done. The Andalusian mentality apparently results from the submission of the people's economic needs to the interests of the dominant classes; therefore, it has been said, an enormous gulf exists between the ruling minority and the great mass of workers. The subordination of the former class to the exigencies of social tradition, the absence of curiosity, the lack of technological spirit, the scanty development of any sort of business enterprise, all have left a very special mark on the Andalusian mentality. However, in other periods of historical 35\n\nMAN IN SPANISH ECONOMIC LIFE\n\nlife the Andalusian has been in the forefront of peninsular economic activity (in the 10th century, under the Caliphate; in the 16th, immediately after the conquest of America). The true nature of the Andalusian regional nucleus can only be understood after a radical revision of the myths which at present obscure its meaning.\n\n36\n\nI\n\nP R I M I T I V E AND COLONIAL ECONOMY\n\n4 · Economy of Prehistoric Spain\n\nIf we push history back to the appearance of man on the planet and accept the evidence that this appearance dates at least from the Quaternary period, what we might call primeval history begins at the end of the Pliocene (warm climate, luxuriant vegetation, many mammal species), when the temperature begins to fall and the first glaciation is about to take place. However, since this primeval or prehistoric age goes back farther than the Quaternary, we should point out some traits of the natural environment at different periods. Quaternary (from 600,000 or 500,000 to 10,000 B.C.). Its chief characteristic is the alternation of climatic phases (four periods of glaciation, or periods of intense cold, and three interglacial periods), the probable cause of which was variation in the intensity of solar radiation. In those times the Peninsula had a shape similar to that of today, and the Strait of Gibraltar was already open. The effects of glaciation had less influence on the Peninsula than on the rest of Europe, though some did occur: perpetual snows descended to the 1,7001,800 meter level in the Pyrenees, to 1,400 in the Picos de Europa, and to 2,400 in the Sierra Nevada; the climate of the Meseta was similar to that of Poland today, the Cantabrian coast's was like Scotland's, and in Andalusia the climate resembled that of southern France; rivers carried much more water, and volcanic phenomena were very common; the flora and fauna resembled those of the Nordic countries. Transition to the modern geological period (from 10,000 to 5,000 B.C.). This period, about which we know little, was also one of transition in the cultural sphere (Mesolithic or Epipaleolithic). Great geological disturbances occurred which marked the transition from the Pleistocene, or late Quaternary, to the Holocene. Fully modern period (beginning about 5,000 B.C.). The upTHE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.\n\n39\n\nECONOMY OF PREHISTORIC\n\nSPAIN\n\nheavals of the previous period finally produced recession of the ice to its present limits and the definitive configuration of coastal levels. FOOD-GATHERING ECONOMY: NOMADIC HUNTERS OF THE PALEOLITHIC. When he faced the day-to-day problem of living, the most\n\nprimitive man, in the most elementary stages of technology, was limited to the use of the spontaneous elements which Nature had placed within his grasp—the simple gathering of wild products and the hunting of wild animals. It was, therefore, a destructive economy of a negative type: consumption of resources without replacement and, consequently, a forced nomadism. Once the resources of the place where they were staying became exhausted, the Paleolithic tribes found no other solution than to move somewhere else in search of the nourishment they needed. In this type of life hunting played the main role, for it supplied meat in abundance as well as skins for clothing. The preeminence of hunting is undoubtedly related to the first known manifestation of spiritual life in man. In fact, the great cave paintings of animals can be explained by sympathetic magic, a concept found in all early hunting peoples which identifies the desired animal with its pictorial representation. Primitive man used for this early hunting activity the arms or tools provided by chipping waterborne stones; he also made use of wood treated with the aid of fire, already known at the dawn of humanity. Who were these hunting peoples of a nomadic type of fife and a rudimentary tool culture, who occupied the Peninsula for the space of half a million years? Our knowledge of them goes back only as far as the second phase of renewal of cold, within the last glacial period, during which the ancient Neanderthal inhabitants, of whom we know almost nothing, were forced into oblivion by new men whose physical characteristics were not essentially different from those of modern man. This phenomenon took place at the same time as the arrival in Western Europe of new peoples, probably of Asiatic origin, who raised the level of material culture very notably by perfecting the use of flint. There were two groups which came into Spain. One is called the Gravettians, a people of Mediterranean type who spread over almost the entire Peninsula; they are known for their variety of small 40\n\nECONOMY OF PREHISTORIC\n\nSPAIN\n\nstone implements (microliths). They and their successors, the Epigravettians, are our most remote ancestors; it is thought that they entered Spain about 100,000 B.C., at the end of the Lower Paleolithic. Another group, the Aurignacians, became established later in the Basque-Cantabrian zone. These people, more advanced culturally, are known especially for their skill in hunting and their use of bone for tool-making. During the last stages of the Paleolithic, other ethnic groups came to join this first surviving substratum. They were the SoIutreans, armed bands of possible African extraction; they introduced the bow and with it long-range hunting. They circulated among the earlier peoples, sometimes mingling with them, and surviving in certain places until the arrival of the Magdalenians. This people reached Cantabria and the northern part of the Peninsula in pursuit of the reindeer and bison of northern Europe, which had been pushed southward by the last period of intense cold, in the fourth glacial period. The Magdalenians had a well-developed industry of bone implements and spears. AGRICULTURAL AND HERDING ECONOMY IN NEOLITHIC TIMES. A\n\nseries of new discoveries, known as the Neolithic revolution, took place in the region between the Nile and Mesopotamia within a cycle of only 2,000 or 3,000 years, at the beginning of the fully modern geological period. These discoveries changed the whole direction of humanity and marked its entrance into a new civilization. Agriculture was the focal point of this new progress. The discovery of cultivation of the soil is a landmark in human culture second only to the discovery of fire. The introduction of agricultural techniques implies a waiting period between sowing and reaping and therefore implies a sedentary type of life, for it makes possible the renewal of resources without having to move from place to place. At the same time, since living in one place made it impossible to follow large game on its long migrations, it required domestication of the more necessary animals; thus herding came about as an adjunct to agriculture. And then the settling down and living together of a group of persons in the same area made a certain amount of political organization necessary. Finally, let us point out, as a supplement to agriculture, the appearance of other important civilizing elements such as pottery, 41\n\nECONOMY OF PREHISTORIC\n\nSPAIN\n\nthe wheel, weaving, etc. In short, we can see that the introduction of agricultural techniques revolutionized the way of life of prehistoric man, raising him to heights undreamed of during the Paleolithic era and opening the way to subsequent improvements, among them metallurgy. Now that we have described the economy of the Neolithic period, it is only necessary to add some details about its development within the Hispanic setting. In the Peninsula the Neolithic begins about 4,000 B.C. under the influence of outside groups who came from the East, by what route we do not know. Even lacking such data, we do know that this foreign element enriched the extremely low cultural level of the Peninsula at a time immediately preceding the appearance of the Neolithic movement on its soil. As for the rest, the Neolithic agrarian innovations, which arrived in Spain rather belatedly, gave a decided impulse to the incorporation of the country into the cycle of more advanced civilizations. INTRODUCTION OF METALLURGICAL TECHNIQUES: LOS MILLARES.\n\nThe Neolithic period in Spain lasted a relatively short time, and is thought of as the period immediately preceding the age characterized by the discovery of metal and its possibilities as a working tool and a technical instrument. This discovery had been made in the Near East about the year 4000 B.C., but there was considerable delay before it spread to the rest of the inhabited world. The first metals used were those which are found in their native state (gold and copper especially) and which can be worked, to a certain extent, like stones. Copper in particular was the metal par excellence of the early period. It was extracted from pits and mines by the use of fire and stone wedges; next, by the action of heat on the ore, the metal-bearing particles were loosened, then separated by means of washing. Finally, to unite the particles of metal, they were smelted in clay bowls. A later discovery was the alloying of copper with tin, which was known in the form of impurities in the former metal; and this gave rise to the use of bronze, a harder metal and one easier to smelt than copper. The introduction of metallurgy, really the first transformation of matter which man had accomplished, opened the door to the making of tools which were conventional in form yet more resistant and 42\n\nECONOMY OF PREHISTORIC\n\nSPAIN\n\neasier to produce than stone ones. In Spain, which was rich in copper (Andalusia and Asturias) and tin (Galicia), the impact was extraordinary. This took place about 2000 B.C. and marks the incorporation of Spain into the civilizing commercial currents of the Mediterranean. Given the cultural state of Neolithic men in Spain, it seems probable that they learned metallurgical techniques from some Mediterranean people whose identity is unknown to us. This belief is strengthened by the site of Los Millares, a typical Bronze Age settlement near Almeria on the Spanish Levantine coast and a foreign colony in Hispanic territory. We shall omit here the different stages in its development, but Los Millares is essentially a fortified town on a hill, with a well-developed water supply system, an extraordinary variety of tools made of stone, metal, bone, and other materials, and a very complex religious life. A foreign bastion in hostile territory, an advance base of a much richer civilization, a mercantile and cultural crossroads, and the focal point of a very mature spiritual sense—that is Los Millares. With its walls and moats, its utensils and ornaments of Egyptian and Minoan origin, its alabaster vases, bone needles and buttons, its necklace beads of calcite, turquoise, jadeite, and amber (from the Baltic, perhaps?), and its enormous burial chambers each large enough for a hundred graves, there is no possible doubt that it indicates a culture brought from the Near East. REGIONAL ECONOMIC GROUPS IN THE BRONZE AGE: EL ARGAR.\n\nLos Millares is the most representative site of a cultural circle called the Almerian, which comprised the southeastern part of the Peninsula and was settled by a people from the Sahara. This circle, the Mediterranean outlet of prehistoric Hispanic territory, reached its highest point of development later, well within the Bronze Age, when the rise of metallurgy made the expeditions of Eastern merchants in search of Spanish minerals more frequent. The site of El Argar is symbolic of this period. The Almerian culture spread along the shore of the Levant as far as Catalonia. Then it reached into the Ebro valley by way of the Maestrazgo passes and attained the Meseta through the Jalon valley. In Catalonia it coexisted with the Pyrenean culture, which had been developed by a herding people of possible Caucasian origin 43\n\nECONOMY\n\nOF PREHISTORIC\n\nSPAIN\n\nwith characteristics similar to those of the modern Basques. The Pyrenean herdsmen of the Bronze Age lived a poor existence, a mere reflection of the life of more advanced peoples to the north and south of the mountains, and buried their dead in dolmens. They were grouped around two centers—the Catalan and the more isolated Basque—whose point of union was the highlands of Huesca. In the south, the Almerian culture spread very rapidly into the Guadalquivir valley. Andalusia's greater agricultural and mining wealth, and the fact that it was on the Atlantic tin route, gave it a separate personality. This special character of Andalusia was to give rise to the extraordinary fame of one of its economic and cultural elements, the bell beaker, which is recognized today as a product of the fusing of the Hispano-Mauritanian and Almerian cultures. This bell-shaped beaker went beyond regional and peninsular limits and spread all over Europe. The Meseta, shut away in the center of the Peninsula, formed a sort of substratum in which the cultural manifestations of the peripheral zones left their deposits. For the period with which we are dealing, historians usually lump its culture with that of the caves, which is meaningless. In reality, judging by the very small chink opened by a few inadequate archaeological investigations, the only significant development in the center of the Peninsula during the Bronze Age is the extension and perfection of the bell beaker (Ciempozuelos). Although the economic groups we have just mentioned lived in isolation from each other, economic and cultural relations did exist among them. The best proof of these links is the occurrence of the megaliths—great funerary constructions of stone—probably of foreign (Mediterranean) origin, which appear almost throughout the country, and their establishment in such diverse places as among the Basque-Catalan herdsmen and the farmers of the Guadalquivir valley. FIRST COMMERCIAL RELATIONS AMONG THE PENNINSULA, THE NEAR EAST, AND THE ATLANTIC. When we dealt with the introduc-\n\ntion of agriculture, and later metallurgy, into Spain, we spoke of the Eastern origin of these discoveries. This is a fact which has not been proved in any concrete way, but one which has been 44\n\nECONOMY OF PREHISTORIC SPAIN\n\ndeduced—on the positive side because of the existence in Egypt and Syria of very advanced cultures capable of stimulating such phenomena, and negatively because the indigenous Hispanic inhabitants would have found it impossible to reach such high forms of culture from levels of civilization which were considerably lower. Once such relations are admitted, it would be interesting to know the extent of contacts between the two ends of the Mediterranean. Authorities are divided on this point into Orientalists and Occidentalists, according to the greater or lesser weight given to the East in the evolution of the forms of life of peninsular prehistoric peoples. In any case, however, it has been possible to establish a certain parallelism between the Spanish Eneolithic cultural centers and those of the Near East, especially Egypt (ornamental objects and ceramic decorations) and the islands of the Aegean, which leaves little doubt of the influence of these peoples in Spain. It remains to be determined which people it was who established the bridge between the two coasts. Siret's theory, favorable to the Phoenicians, has been abandoned, and today the Cretans are thought to have carried out the role of intermediaries. On the other hand, very late in the second millennium B.C., the old Eneolithic culture reached a high point in Galicia and nearby Portuguese regions. Since this same phenomenon took place simultaneously in Brittany, Cornwall, and Ireland, it is felt that underlying this coincidence there may exist an ethnic or at least a cultural unity. Active navigation even in simple hide boats would result in close links among these countries. The abundance of metal—especially gold and tin—in the countries mentioned explains the prosperity of this Atlantic period. Tin in particular was the object of active commerce with the southern part of the Peninsula, which served as an intermediary with the more advanced countries of the Mediterranean and even with faraway Egypt. The benefits which the North Atlantic countries drew fro"
