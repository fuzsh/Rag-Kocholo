The affirmation on page 2 of this lecture that the bilingual (Latin/Arabic) coins of 98H (fig.) were the first attestable material evidence of the use of Arabic epigraphy on the Iberian Peninsula and also the earliest provable evidence of the use of the Arabic name place “al-Andalus” is no longer tenable in view of the appearance of the term in a series of lead seals that can be dated as prior to 98H. The introduction of “al-Andalus” is now apparently be an innovation introduced in the governorship of ´Abd al-Azziz b. Musa, an adoption which had a possible political intent, while the first evidence of the use of Arabic on some of these same lead seals, it could not be of his father’s Musa b. Nusayr, the 80-year-old conqueror of Hispania, whose Latin only coins had the mint name SPN for Hispania.

What is worrisome is not so much that some collector, institution, or scholar gets taken in (sorry, they should have done their homework) but that these fakes enter, and they have entered, into some “scientific” peer-reviewed articles. The polemical historiography of the period has enough problems without the added distortions of modern fake coins. This article puts special emphasis on the historical dubouos indiction IX date which from being previously unknown in the last two centuries of numismatic literature of the period has suddenly metamorphosed, reproducing gremlin-wise, into many variants and will probably henceforth continue to do so. ( first corrected 17/11/2020)\n\nThis special issue arose out of a conference hosted by the RomanIslam Center for Comparative Empire and Transcultural Studies (Universität Hamburg) in March 2021. The conference, entitled \"The Umayyads from West to East: New Perspectives\" focused on intra-Empire comparison between the Umayyads of the West and the East and on the relevance of various Roman and Late Antique contexts to the conceptualization of Umayyad rule. However, the lens through which most contributors chose to analyze this question, and a recurring topic in the subsequent discussions, was the relevance of transregional Umayyad memory, particularly from the perspective of the Islamic West. The entries in this volume are grouped around this focus, examining different ways in which transregional Umayyad memories influenced, and were influenced by, the culture of the Islamic West. Mnemohistory, or the study of the past as it was remembered, constructed, and recontextualized, has been a thriving area of inquiry in the humanities since the studies of Maurice Halbwachs (1939) on collective memory and those by Aleida and Jan Assmann (1992, 2012) on cultural memory more specifically.1 Its impact on the study of Islamic history has been significant and has led to important advances in the field. Particularly prominent studies include Antoine Borrut's analysis of Umayyad memories in Syria (2011),2 Sarah Savant's book on pre-Islamic memories in Iran (2013), Heather Keaney's work on the remembrance of the rebellion against ʿUthmān, and Tayeb El-Hibri's research on the memories of the Rāshidūn (2010) and the Umayyad rulers (2002). The instrumentalization of the past is also an important topic in the studies of early Islamic historiography by Boaz Shoshan (2016), Fred Donner (1998), and more recently, in Manan Ahmed Asif's study of the Chachnama and its creative context (2016). 1 For a survey of the field, see Erll and Nünning 2008. 2 See also the collected volume edited by Antoine Borrut and Paul Cobb (2010).\n\nThis special issue arose out of a conference hosted by the RomanIslam Center for Comparative Empire and Transcultural Studies (Universität Hamburg) in March 2021.

The entries in this volume are grouped around this focus, examining different ways in which transregional Umayyad memories influenced, and were influenced by, the culture of the Islamic West.\n\nThe seventh century CE in the Near East was an era characterized by major political transition and cultural change, representing a historical epoch that witnessed the decline of the region’s long-standing major political institutions alongside the emergence of a powerful Arab Caliphate that supplanted both the offices of the Byzantine Emperor and the Persian, Sasanid Shah in most or all of the region. This Arab Caliphate, first based out of the Hejaz, then out of Syria-Palestine with the rise of the Umayyads (r. 661-750 CE), the first hereditary dynasty of the Islamic period, embarked on a campaign of Arab and Muslim hegemony across three continents within the course of a century. Some of the Umayyad’s successes in terms of both the acquisition of and projection of power were not only the result of an organized and determined military and a steady stream of income from its territorial acquisitions, but also due to their ability to construct institutions and bureaucratic machinery that allowed them to create and control narratives through the production of inscribed material culture. Through various administrative and institutional mechanisms, the Umayyad caliphs were able to universalize the Arabic language and script and, by extension, promote a doctrinal form of Islam, both of which were accelerated by the development and expansion of their state and which played a critical role in the attempt to validate their political claims. Most importantly, an Umayyad monopoly on the cursive Arabic script, an orthography initially used by Christian missionaries in the Levant and Arabia in the sixth century, led to its appropriation for administrative uses by the Muslims which was then wielded as a source of political capital. The weaponization of the Arabic orthography enabled the Umayyads to decisively institute and enforce a new linguistic, cultural, religious and political order over the Near East in the era of Late Antiquity. The extant inscribed material culture implicates the Umayyads as graphophiles, obsessed with the written word and cognizant of its qualities and abilities in helping them impose their political will on their opponents in a battle for cultural, political and ideological primacy. Thus, this dissertation serves as an archaeolinguistic study of how the Umayyads instrumentalized and exploited the Arabic script on administrative material culture as instruments of authority and as purveyors of a new order in the region."
