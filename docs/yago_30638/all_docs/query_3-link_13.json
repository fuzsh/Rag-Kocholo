        "meta_description": "Meat Me in St. Louis: Directed by Chris Adshead. With Tom Oliver, Alan Fletcher, Jackie Woodburne, Janet Andrewartha. Now Boyd knows how Janae lied, he tells her he'll drop out of uni; she hastily tries to undo her threats to uni-chicks, then tells her startled, skateboarding prince charming it's much better to be spared ten years of study, now he can move in with her; he generously makes up anyway. Janelle insists to celebrate the actual sale of the manuscript at the General Store where Angie works. When Lyn tells Susan how brilliantly Bree improved Janelle's dribble, that explains the recent homework-disasters too. Only an earpiece spoken into by Bree can help Janelle answer the publisher's man Bill Merchant's questions. Lou chews Lyn's head off for 'selling her soul to the devil' Paul by taking the only job offer at Lucinda's; Susan shows single mothers-solidarity, while holding back the legal recourse against Katya's custody-ambitions Karl advises. Steph lets Max go a few days to his daughter Summer who has caught dengue fever, but Karl and Susan insist he should know the baby can cause her dead meanwhile. Kim blurts out Angie once made a pass at him, and barely manages to stop Janelle telling Big Kev, which could kill their already dodgy marriage for good.",
