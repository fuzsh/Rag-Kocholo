        "text": "The 2020 Junos have been cancelled since this article was first published.\n\nAfter the massive success of their independently released 1988 album, The Trinity Session, Cowboy Junkies hesitantly signed to a record label. While the move opened new doors for the band, it also led to industry-driven pressure on singer Margo Timmins.\n\n\"I never did anything that was not me,\" says Timmins, whose bandmates include her two brothers, Michael, on guitar, and Pete, on drums, as well as Alan Anton on bass. \"And that, I think, was irritating to the industry because they felt if I glammed myself up a little more, we could have sold more records. But I would have not liked myself. So yeah, you know, they wanted me to shorten my skirts and change my nose.\"\n\nCowboy Junkies were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in November 2019. Last fall, CBC Music took Margo and Michael to Toronto's Church of the Holy Trinity, where they recorded The Trinity Session, and asked how the band — now independent again — felt about their time working with labels.\n\nThe bittersweet story of Chilliwack's 1982 Juno win\n\nFrom the Archies to Tina Turner to Homer Simpson: the many lives of Andy Kim's 'Sugar Sugar'\n\n\"We went into that relationship with that in mind, knowing that there'll be some battles and we might have to give ground on a few weird things but we'll never give up on the music and it'll work out,\" Michael says.\n\nOne of those battles was the push for Margo to change her image.\n\n\"All that fashion attention was hard because it was really not who I was or am,\" she says. \"Getting my picture taken by all these people was not fun. But to me, it was a part of the job.\"\n\nAt the Hall of Fame induction ceremony in the fall, Margo used her acceptance speech to call out sexism in the music business, asking industry professionals to make it more welcoming and supportive for women.\n\n\"I know that there are many men and women in our industry who struggle every day to create change, and to you, I give you my respect and my support,\" she said. \"But there are also many women and men who think that with time, things will become equal and all will be well eventually. And perhaps they're right. But what I say to that is, if you are thinking in this way, you have to remember, as we wait, the next generation of talented and creative women will be asked or allowed to join our industry by going through the side door — the way that women have entered the world of men for centuries, and it's just wrong.\"\n\nCowboy Junkies' Margo Timmins calls out sexism in the music industry\n\n2020 Canadian Music Hall of Fame inductee Jann Arden releasing new memoir\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies' story will be featured alongside the stories of four more Hall of Fame inductees in the CBC Music special Inducted: The Road to the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. The special will feature extensive interviews with Canadian music legends Jann Arden, Bill Henderson of Chilliwack, Andy Kim and the family of singer Bobby Curtola.\n\nInducted airs on CBC Television at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday, March 15. You can watch it via CBC Gem now.\n\nWith files from Reuben Maan. Video produced by Justin Chandler and Ryan Gassi. Sara Cornthwaite and Merik Williams on camera."
