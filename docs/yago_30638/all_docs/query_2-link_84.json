        "text": "Shawna Holland Chandler, 68, passed away quietly at home surrounded by family, on Saturday, June 8, 2019 after a courageous fight with ALS.\n\nShawna was born June 28, 1950 in Logan, Utah to Ross Wilson Holland and Carol Hughes.\n\nShawna graduated from Davis High School where she was actively involved in many clubs, including the drill team as a Davis D’Ette. She attended Brigham Young University where she was on the drill team as a Cougarette, then transferred to Weber State University, where she completed an associate degree in Nursing. She returned to school later in life, completing a bachelor’s degree in Nursing at Dixie State University at the age of 60.\n\nShawna married Jay Montgomery Benson in 1972. They had 5 children together and later divorced. She married Brent LeGrand Chandler on April 10, 1992 and they were later sealed in the Jordan River Temple on June 18, 1993.\n\nShawna retired in 2015 after about 30 years working as a Registered Nurse, Nurse Case Manager and Nurse Manager. She held various nursing and leadership positions at McKay-Dee Hospital in Ogden, Utah, Primary Children’s Medical Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, Dixie Regional Hospital in St. George, UT, and Cassia Regional Hospital in Burley, Idaho. Shawna was especially proud of her time at the children’s hospital as well as her contributions as a manager at Cassia.\n\nShawna was a faithful member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She served in many positions including Relief Society president, Primary president, and Young Women’s president. Shawna and her husband Brent served as senior missionaries in the Washington Yakima Mission from September 2015 through September 2016.\n\nShawna enjoyed flowers, gardening, cooking, music, calligraphy, traveling, camping, fly fishing, and the outdoors. She had a great sense of style and loved to beautify her home and yard. Her favorite treat was Haagen-Dazs ice cream.\n\nShawna’s greatest joy was her children and family. She raised five children as a single working mother for over five years. She was a devoted friend, forming strong relationships wherever she went. Shawna was an inspiration to many through her strength and perseverance during difficult times. She never lost her sense of humor.\n\nShawna is survived by her children and step children, Mark Benson (Merilee), Melissa Thomson (Derek), Tim Benson (Stacey), Kim Benson, Karianne Timmins (Ben), Shane Chandler (Angela), Brent Chandler Jr. (Sherrie), Stephanie Maynard (Jim), Robin Reynolds and 20 grandchildren. She is also survived by her sisters, Michele Holland and Elena McFarland and her step father, Ford Call. She is preceded in death by her husband Brent, and parents Ross and Carol.\n\nFuneral Services will be held at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday, June 15, 2019 at the Farmington 18th Ward, 1395 South 200 East in Farmington, Utah. Family will meet with friends and relatives on Friday, June 14, 2019 from 6:00-8:00 p.m. at the Russon Mortuary, 1941 North Main Street in Farmington, Utah, and for one hour prior to the funeral service at the Farmington 18th Ward church.
