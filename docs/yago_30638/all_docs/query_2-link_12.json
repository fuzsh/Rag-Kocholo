        "text": "With the city's longest-serving mayor passing away over the weekend, people have been sharing their memories of Victor (Vic) Power.\n\nFlags at City of Timmins facilities and the Timmins Police Service station have been lowered to honour Power's legacy.\n\nLocal politicians and members of the public have also been sharing memories of Power.\n\nTimmins MPP George Pirie released a statement today, extending his condolences to Power's family.\n\n\"Mayor Power treasured the love of his life, Clarice, his lovely family and the citizens of Timmins. He proudly served our community for decades including lengthy terms as councillor and as mayor,\" said Pirie.\n\n\"Mayor Power's dedication and years of service to Timmins is rightly recognized through the Victor M. Power Airport.\n\n\"On behalf of myself and our government, I want to extend our deepest condolences. Thank you Mayor Power for all your efforts to make Timmins a better place to live, work and raise a family. You will be missed.\"\n\nCurrent Mayor Michelle Boileau said Power was a pillar of the community and an inspiration for people who aspire to a public office career.\n\n\"He led with conviction and understood the power of decision and opportunity,\" she said in a news release yesterday.\n\n“His genuine optimism and love for Timmins will continue to inspire. We remain forever in his debt for the contributions he made to the city we call home.”\n\nTimmins-James Bay MP Charlie Angus took to social media with his comments.\n\n\"I am sorry to learn of the passing of Vic Power former mayor of Timmins. I had the honour to know and work with Vic on many projects. He was a class act and he loved the north. Thank you Vic for your service. Go to the angels,\" he wrote.\n\nThroughout the years, Power was known for his ability to remember people's names and his devotion to the city.\n\n\"Mr. Power was an amazing person. He always remembered my husband Ken and that he married me, the Fournier Girl he would say. He was Ken's guidance counsellor in high school. He never forgot who Ken was. He called Ken, when Ken received a safety award from Kidd Creek, personally and congratulated him on this,\" reads an email from Kim and Ken Beamish.\n\n\"Most recently we had lunch with Mr. Power in the St. Mary's Manor, where my own mother lives. He remembered both Ken and I and chatted through lunch with us. Told Ken to say hi to his mother who he said he remembered worked at the Bank of Montreal. Our deepest sympathies, in this great loss, goes to the Power family. Mr. Power was a great human being. A great man. We are happy to have known him.\"\n\nThe Timmins Police Services board also released a statement on Power's legacy today.\n\n\"Former mayor Power played a pivotal role in the growth and development of both the Timmins Police Service and our community. His extensive service on the Timmins Police Services Board witnessed the evolution and expansion of our law enforcement agency,\" it reads."
