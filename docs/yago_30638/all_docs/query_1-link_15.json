        "text": "Janelle Timmins is a great character..for a family of of what were classed as bogans when they came to the street, the Timmins's have really developed into a likeable family.\n\n0\n\nSuch a wrong decision to get rid of them. If any, they should have got rid of maybe Stingray as he's been in it for a while now.\n\nBut I think they should have kept Dylan, Janae (i know she's staying anyway), Bree and definitely Janelle.\n\n0\n\nThe Timmins will be a huge loss when they go, I hope the door is left open for Janelle as I would love her to come back in the future.\n\n0\n\nThe producers at Neighbours are making some dodgy decisions. They get rid of Bree and Janelle who are fab, whereas they keep Zeke and Ned who can't act their way out of an extremely thin paper bag!\n\n0\n\nSo is Janae the only one thats not going?\n\nWith Boyd going aswell, what direction are they going to Janae in?\n\n0"
