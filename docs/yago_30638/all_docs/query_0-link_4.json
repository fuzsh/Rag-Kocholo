        "text": "Soap opera character\n\nJanae Timmins (also Hoyland) is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Eliza Taylor-Cotter. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 4 April 2005. The character was created by executive producer Ric Pellizzeri as part of the new Timmins family, joining the established character Stingray Timmins (Ben Nicholas). Janae is characterised as a feisty character who is unafraid of physical confrontation. She has low self-esteem due to her father Kim Timmins (Brett Swain) being absent during her childhood. Janae is featured in various storylines including having her drink spiked with rohypnol, an HIV scare and the victim of an attempted sexual assault.\n\nJanae has also been the subject of an underage marriage with fellow character Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh). Their marital life is short-lived when Boyd is unfaithful. Marsh bemoaned the development and branded it \"a stupid storyline\". Her failed marriage changed Janae into a man-hater. Producers then paired her with Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor) and formed a new family unit as they cared for his son Mickey Gannon (Fletcher O'Leary). The character's failed marriage continued to shape the character as she kisses Darren Stark (Todd MacDonald). The actress called it an act of self-sabotage to prevent Ned from hurting her as Boyd did. With her relationship with Ned also failed she decides to leave Erinsborough to live with her mother.\n\nIn 2007 Taylor-Cotter's on-screen family were axed, however, Pellizzeri decided to keep Janae in the serial. After three years in the role, Taylor-Cotter decided to leave because the show had changed following the departure of her on-screen family. The actress filmed her final scenes in September 2007. The character made her final appearance in the show on 8 February 2008. Janae has been described as a \"rebel and a troublemaker\" by certain critics and on-screen she has matured from a troubled teenager into a young woman. Taylor-Cotter has also been praised for the role and has been nominated for a number of awards for her portrayal.\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nActress Eliza Morley secured the role of Janae after previously appearing in a guest role in 2003.[1] Taylor-Cotter had originally auditioned for the role of Lana Crawford, however, it was actress Bridget Neval who was eventually cast.[2]\n\nCharacter development\n\n[edit]\n\nCharacterisation\n\n[edit]\n\nCotter described Janae as being \"a very troubled young girl in constant need of attention.\"[3] She has a promiscuous and tough persona. Comparing Janae to her younger sister, she said \"Janae and Bee are very different from one another, and Janae especially has a knack for getting into trouble.\"[3] Shortly after their arrival in Erinsborough, Janae and Bree Timmins (Sianoa Smit-McPhee) shoplift some items from the general store, which Cotter said was an indication of what kind of girls they are. Their brother Stingray Timmins (Ben Nicholas) is annoyed by their actions, but Janae thinks he has gone soft.[3] Cotter added that she enjoyed playing Janae, as she is vastly different from herself.[3]\n\nA writer from Network Ten described Janae as a younger version of her mum Janelle, but noted Janae would hate any comparison being made.[4] They added that she is \"keen not to make the same mistakes\", but she is married at sixteen and history is repeating itself.[4] The character developed a \"complicated attitude\" towards men – \"she knows how to stick up for herself and isn't afraid to get physical if necessary.\"[4] In her early scenes, Janae used sex to get attention and affection from others. But underneath it is her father's disappearance that affected her self-esteem.[4]\n\nHIV scare\n\n[edit]\n\nWriters used Janae to portray the issue lead topic of HIV. The storyline features Janae discovering that her ex-boyfriend Mike Pill (Alexander Cappelli) carries the virus, forcing Janae to be tested.[5] Taylor-Cotter told the BBC that she had heard rumours about the storyline a number of months beforehand. She also had \"mixed feelings\" about the storyline because she worried that Janae might have been written out of the series. Taylor-Cotter found the issue challenging, very emotional and daunting because she had to put herself in Janae's situation. While Taylor-Cotter had previously difficulty crying on cue - she found it \"pretty easy\" because she felt sorry for Janae. Taylor-Cotter was pleased that Neighbours had chosen to portray an issue-led storyline. She stated; \"I don't think there's enough publicity surrounding HIV, it's a very serious disease and there are so many people out there suffering from it. I think there should be a lot more awareness about it.\"[5]\n\nJanae is characterised as not being \"very good at rational thinking\" so she attempts to end her relationship with Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh), in order to protect him. Taylor-Cotter revealed that she was thankful that Boyd \"sees straight through it\" and agrees to support her. Janae also confides in her younger sister Bree but is reluctant to tell anyone else. Janae \"approaches it the best way she knows how and that's by pushing everyone that cares about her away.\"[5] Taylor-Cotter told Inside Soap that Janae cannot tell Janelle about her situation because \"she fears she'll judge her\". The truth is revealed during an argument between the pair.[6] Taylor-Cotter and Feeney got on so well off-screen, that they purposely avoided each other while on set to add to the \"intensity\" of the scenes.[5] Janae is \"so afraid of taking after her mother\" that she blames Janelle for her predicament, telling her that she is at fault if she is HIV positive. Janelle is upset that Janae could not confide in her about an \"important matter\". Taylor-Cotter said that Janae ends up receiving support from her family because \"the Timmins clan always reunite in the end\".[6]\n\nMarriage to Boyd Hoyland\n\n[edit]\n\nProducers created Janae's first romantic partnership alongside Boyd. Their relationship was developed fast and the two characters decide to get married. However their families are not happy with their engagement for various reasons. Writers set up the opposing relatives warring against either side. Boyd's father Max Hoyland (Stephen Lovatt) does not approve because of their young age. Marsh told an Inside Soap reporter that the engagement causes tension between the Timmins and Hoylands because Max thinks Janae is not good enough for his son.[7] Janae's mother Janelle Timmins (Nell Feeney) is undecided and sometimes supports them but sometimes turns against them. With so much opposition the duo fear no one will attend their wedding. Marsh explained that Janae and Boyd do not want to risk any more problems they decide to marry in a small registry office ceremony. Boyd's sister Summer Hoyland (Marissa Siketa) supports her brother but she tells Max and Janelle about the wedding. Their relatives arrive unannounced at the wedding, Marsh described the scenes as \"a lot of trouble\".[7] The actor believed the wedding was very low-key and filming the event felt like a normal day on set. The pair do not wear traditional wedding attire and Marsh did not think it made their marriage look official.[7]\n\nBoyd later has an affair with Glenn Forrest (Cleopatra Coleman) while holidaying in Tasmania. He feels guilty and tells Janae that he kissed Glenn who forgives him. Glenn arrives in Erinsborough to visit her friend Elle Robinson (Pippa Black) and Boyd.[8] Marsh told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that \"Glenn's like a skeleton in Boyd's closet who's coming back to haunt him.\" Her arrival reminds him of the fun they shared. Despite their affair lasting two weeks, Glenn is in love with Boyd and he denies any reciprocation. She visits Boyd and he tells her that he is not interested and wants Janae. This prompts Glenn to reveal the full extent of their affair to Janae.[8] She offers Boyd the opportunity to confess. Marsh assessed that Janae is left \"heartbroken\" by Boyd's betrayal and he is scared of losing her.\n\nElle decides to convince Glenn to remain in Erinsborough to steal Boyd from Janae. Marsh explained that Elle hates Janae and uses Glenn to enact her revenge against the Hoylands. But as the actor noted, Janae is characterised as a fiery female, a trait shared with all her family members. Writers used her \"Timmins spirit\" to spur Janae on into fighting mode to save her marriage. Marsh added, \"Janae's not the kind of girl to take things lying down, so she goes into battle.\"[8] Janae slaps Glenn for sleeping with her husband. But the situation develops into a \"very nasty\" predicament when Glenn is run over and suspicion is cast over Janae believing she caused the accident.[8] Behind the scenes Marsh was furious with Boyd's infidelity and criticised the producers for their \"stupid\" storyline. He told a reporter \"I absolutely hated my character at the end. I couldn't believe what they made me do, I thought it was a stupid storyline and I copped a lot of flack over it. I was really upset.\"[9]\n\nRelationship with Ned Parker\n\n[edit]\n\nProducers later decided to pair Janae with Ned Parker (Daniel O'Connor). Writers were tasked with creating reasons for them to share screen time together. So Janae hires Ned as her personal boxing trainer and he helps her with a fitness regime.[10] Ned soon develops feelings for Janae but she shows no interest in him. Taylor-Cotter described the dynamic between Janae and Ned as a \"love-hate relationship\". There had been tension between the pair ever since he began training her. The actress believed the breakdown Janae and Boyd's marriage caused her character to become \"very anti-men\".[10] When Boyd begins his recovery from a car accident, Janae gives him a friendly hug. Ned witnesses this and presumes they are going to reconcile. Ned forces Janae to undertake more intensive training to prevent her from thinking about Boyd. He takes her to the beach and orders her to run and swim. But his fitness regime causes Janae to become exhausted while in the sea and she nearly drowns. Taylor-Cotter explained it was the first moment Janae views Ned romantically. Concerned Ned wants to rescue her and they share a \"weird moment\" where Ned feels the urge to kiss Janae.[10] Taylor-Cotter explained \"she freaks out, so Ned backs off and pretends that it was nothing. But surprisingly, she feels a little gutted - and starts to realise that she's attracted to Ned.\" But unlike Janae and Boyd's romance, writers decided on a \"slow-burning\" relationship. The actress believed that Janae rushed her into marriage with Boyd and it subsequently failed. So to make Janae and Ned more successful they fall in love over a greater amount of time.[10]\n\nNed's ex-girlfriend, Kirsten Gannon (Nikola Dubois), attempts to steal him away from Janae.[11] Ned and Kirsten travel to Oakey for a reunion and Janae cannot make it. O'Connor said that Janae is \"concerned\" about leaving Ned alone with Kirsten because she believes they have feelings for each other. Ned is constantly reassuring Janae that nothing is going on, but Janae is aware that Kirsten is manipulative while Ned remains \"oblivious\". Janae follows the pair to the reunion and causes an argument. O'Connor said that Janae behaves \"totally over-the-top and embarrasses Ned\". He opined that Ned ultimately views Janae as \"a bit of a loose cannon\".[11]\n\nKirsten takes a break away from Erinsborough but returns to regain custody of her son Mickey Gannon (Fletcher O'Leary). But Janae and Ned had cared for Mickey and created their own family unit.[12] With Kirsten proving that she can be a trusted parent it becomes increasingly difficult for Janae to deal with. Taylor-Cotter told Herbison that \"Janae doesn't trust Kirsten as far as she could throw her.\" Janae found it easier to deal with Kirsten when she was acting a bad mother but now she has \"cleaned up her act\". The actress believed that is made her \"twice as dangerous\" and she poses a risk to Janae's new-found family. Writers played Kirsten as a \"meddling minx\" and her involvement continues to create problems.[12] She is delighted when Janae and Ned argue. He decides to let Kirsten collect Mickey from school and fails to notify Janae. When she witnesses Kirsten taking Mickey she reports her to police for kidnap. The mistake creates more drama for the couple and Taylor-Cotter believed it was exactly what Kirsten wanted to achieve. But it was Mickey who suffered the most being caught up between two sides trying to keep custody of him. She added that the fight for Mickey would turn nasty.[12]\n\nTaylor-Cotter warned that infidelity would cause trouble for her character.[12] Janae was later revealed as the culprit when she kisses Darren Stark (Todd MacDonald). It leads to the breakdown of his relationship with Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine).[13] Dan Bennet from Network Ten announced that the kiss would be exposed and added \"Kirsten saw it all and being the vindictive ex that she is, she'll make Janae's life hell. The relationship between Janae & Ned is very much tested after her kiss.\"[14] The actress has defended her character stating it was a \"spur-of-the-moment thing\" that they both regretted. Their mistake was not being honest after it happened and lying. Kirsten uses the situation to her advantage and blackmails Janae. But she decides to tell Ned the truth. He is understanding and forgives her.[15] Janae then tries to convince Darren to tell Libby but he refuses. She shouts at him which is overheard by her neighbours. The public humiliation plays on Ned's mind and he questions whether he has actually forgiven Janae. The uncertainty of her relationship status is a \"horrible feeling\" for Janae and she decides to move out. Taylor-Cotter believed the storyline came about due to Janae's past with Boyd. She added that her marriage ended because Boyd betrayed her - \"so I think Janae's subconsciously trying her best to ruin things with Ned before he has the chance to break her heart, too.\"[15] Janae is sad to witness the hurt she causes Libby's son Ben Kirk (Blake O'Leary) so decides to leave.\n\nDeparture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007 Nell Feeney and Sianoa Smit-McPhee, who play Janae's mother Janelle and sister Bree Timmins, were axed by executive producer Ric Pellizzeri. He wanted Janae to remain in the show and kept Taylor-Cotter in contract.[16] But that year Taylor-Cotter decided to leave Neighbours to pursue other projects and move her career to America.[17] The Timmins family being written out of the show was a factor in the actress' decision to leave. Their departure made her experience too different. She explained, \"it just didn’t feel like the family that I joined when I started three years ago.\"[18] Taylor-Cotter finished filming her final studio scenes on 28 September 2007 and received a goodbye gathering from cast and crew.[19] On-screen Janae's exit played out following the fall-out from her kiss with Darren. Bennett revealed that writers had planned an emotional exit for Janae and viewers would need tissues as it was likely to upset them.[14]\n\nThe character's exit plays out following a series of arguments between residents. It brings Janae to the realisation people will be better off without her. Mickey and Ben fight over whether it was Janae or Darren to blame for the kiss. She explains that she initiated the kiss and they should blame her. But Ned is angry that Janae has discussed the issue with the children believing they are too young to deal with such an adult issue.[20] Knowing the trouble she has caused for Ned, Libby, Mickey and Ben she arranges to live in Cairns with Janelle. Taylor-Cotter explained that her character needed to sort her life out away from Erinsborough. She believed it was for the greater good and staying would only hurt her loved ones more. On-screen Ned argues her departure will devastate Mickey but Janae believes a quick exit will help him more. At the airport, Ned and Mickey arrive to say their goodbyes. Taylor-Cotter said it provided closure for the Janae and Ned relationship. She was happy with Janae's final scenes and branded them an \"emotional roller-coaster\" and fulfilled her wish for Janae to \"go out with a bang\".[20]\n\nStorylines\n\n[edit]\n\nJanae grew up in Colac, Victoria and is the daughter of Janelle and Kim Timmins (Brett Swain).
