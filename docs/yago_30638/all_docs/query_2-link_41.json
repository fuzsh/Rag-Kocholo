From coast to coast, I've wandered through cities and towns, but my true home is wherever my dog Nova and I find ourselves, reveling in the simple joys of a good hike and a campfire. Life's been a journey of sharing with those who care about community, poverty, justice, love, and of course, a hearty laugh and good food. Over the last 20 years I have been involved in various projects and programs in the non-profit sector, government, social enterprise, local grassroots initiatives and even a brief time as a pastor.\n\nSince 2015, me and some friends host an annual event we call Concert for Socks—a series of concerts across Canada, not just for music but to raise a ruckus (awareness and support) for local homelessness initiatives. I've also tried my hand at writing with a book called \"Friendships Last Longer than Sandwiches.\" It's my way of exploring the enduring magic of real connections and seeing the presence of God in the everyday situations and people of life.\n\nCurrently, I'm the Program Coordinator for the Walking with People in Poverty Program at MCC, blending passion with profession. Faith in God isn't just on Sundays; it fuels my adventures, curiosity, and the desire to serve alongside my neighbors. Every day, wrapped in God's love and grace, is a good day if you ask me. Let's keep the journey rolling, friends!\n\nChristina Edmiston, Refugee Sponsorship Associate\n\nChristina serves as the Refugee Sponsorship Associate with MCC Ontario’s Migration & Resettlement Team, guiding sponsors through the onboarding and sponsorship application process.

Her unwavering passion for thrift's sustainability aspect and being conscientious stewards of resources and the environment drives her commitment to the transformative power of thrift.
