(London Free Press 09 Nov 2006)\n\nNewspaper article on AB Willis home on leave\n\nFrom an interview with Harold Willis for \"The history of Thorndale Ontario\" published in the early 1990s: The first time Harold Willis tried to enlist at London in the Royal Canadian Navy, he was told \"they were full up\". The following day, he received a draft notification at his home in Ridge-town from the army. Willis' six weeks of basic training were conducted in London. He was then drafted to Halifax onto a new River Class frigate, HMCS Cape Breton, assigned to convoy duty out of Londonderry, Ireland. The Cape Breton left Halifax on Feb. 24. They were sent to the Azores 'looking for subs' and then returned to Londonderry. He was then drafted to gunnery school at Halifax, promoted and then drafted to HMCS Hallowell on which he served for the rest of the war. Willis recalls 10 or 11 trips while on convoy duty. Each consisted of 60 to 70 ships and seven escorts, mostly frigates. He only recalled on incident. One stormy night the escorts lost sight of the convoy. The next morning they rounded them up and completed their voyage without losses. Willis never used his guns. Primarily he stood his four hour duty watches in rotation. he most harrowing experience was to exchange positions with the sailor on duty in the crows nest, which only had room for one man. Willis was discharged in Nov. 1945 at HMCS Prevost, London, the same location at which he had enlisted almost three years earlier. Able Seaman Gunner Willis was awarded the 1939-45 Star, the Atlantic Star, the 1939-45 Canadian Voluntary Service Medal with clasp, the War medal, and the Long Service Medal.

Both the fellow who died and your father were on Pom Pom guns. My understanding was the man standing beside your father was shot and your father was hit by a piece of metal that took the top layer of skin off in a small area center chest just below the neck. It left a scar. The fellow who died was well liked. He often entertained below deck by step dancing. He was from some place on the east coast of Canada and it was from him that Ken learned step dancing. There were several shipmates from the east coast and Ken also picked up the vocabulary and accent of those from Newfoundland. The sailor was buried at sea.\n\nWebmaster's note: According to casualty records, HMCS HESPELER had no casualties (deaths) during her service career. Additionally, there is no record of a Bob (or Robert) Enright killed in the RCN during WW2. The only 2 Canadian (or Newfoundland) casualties during WW2 named Enright were both in the Army - one died on 07 Jun 1944 and the other on 31 Jun 1944 ashore in Europe.

He loved to golf, read and was faithful to his morning crossword everyday! Carl and Louise had many friends that they cherished, old and new!

Carl felt abundantly blessed and informed everyone of this almost daily. Carl was truly admired and respected by so many his family is overwhelmed with messages reflecting this. He seemed to have a way of making others comfortable with his sense of humor and down to earth, easy going attitude.

He will be sadly missed by his beautiful wife of 56 years, Yvette (Bisson); daughters, Sandy Denny (Wade), Debbie MacLeod (Mark), Denise Loraas (Michael) and Deanne Meredith (Steve); and grandchildren, Erinn and Elaine Denny, Shelby and Courtney MacLeod, Thomas and Andrianna Loraas, Robyn, Kylie and Jillian Meredith; and sister-in-law, Shirley Cummins. Jake lived a full life, joining the RCAF at 18 years old. He was very proud to have served his country as an Instrumental Electrical Technician (IE Tech) until he retired in 1993 after 36 years of dedicated service. The RCAF allowed Jake the opportunity to visit numerous countries and make friends everywhere he went including postings in Greenwood, Gimli, Man., Comox, B.C. and Shearwater. He thoroughly enjoyed his postings on HMCS Margaree, HMCS Fraser and as Air Chief on HMCS Skeena. During his time in the RCAF he was recognized for his hard work, dedication, attention to detail and his unique ability to boost moral. Jake treated everyone he met with kindness. He was a big man with an even bigger heart. Jake was known for his love of outdoor sports excelling in fastball, being named by Bernie Parent in 1981 to Greenwoods All Time All Stars of baseball players and being a member of the winning team at both the RCAF Provincial and Canadian softball championship in 1965 winning 'The Bat'. He also loved to fish and hunt and upon retirement took up the great game of golf. He loved his hunting buddies Bill, Les, Murray, Walter, Alec, Wade, Miles, Neil, Chad and Glen; and fellow golf enthusiasts Jack, Wayne, George, Ford and Dennis. He also loved his many other friends too numerous to name. A big thank you for the compassion and care Jake received during his time of need, especially from the staff at Dartmouth General Hospital.
