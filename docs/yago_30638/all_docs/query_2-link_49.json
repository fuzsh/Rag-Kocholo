        "text": "Access Better Living Inc. / Vie Independante et Enrichie is a non-profit organization that provides a variety of services, resources, and support systems. We, at ABL, are dedicated to assisting children, seniors, and people with disabilities. We strive to provide excellence in independence by providing support for those who require our services. Our services include supportive housing, attendant care, home support, and respite care services for people and families with disabilities.\n\nAccess Better Living Inc. was formed in 1980 when it was incorporated as a result of a grassroots identification of local housing and support care needs for adults with physical disabilities. Since then, we have grown into an organization that now provides services through seven different programs. A volunteer Board of Directors, made up of a cross-section of the community, governs us to ensure that our mission statement is realized, and you, our clients, achieve excellence in independence.\n\nThank you for stopping by! We are a not-for-profit agency dedicated to the delivery of quality services, which promote independent living for persons with disabilities. This has been our mission since 1980 and it continues to serve as a beacon of light shining into the future.\n\nWe can provide you, our clientele, depending on your requirements, with personal care support services, community involvement, relief in caregiving (respite care), housing, and open communication with the ultimate goal to develop further independence and socialization.\n\nWe are so thrilled to tell you that we are able to provide services for children and adults with special needs, adults with physical disabilities, and seniors who require both personal care and home support.\n\nThis website will explain all of our services and how you might fit into our community of care. I welcome you to review all of the services that are offered here at Access Better Living and apply today if you feel you would benefit from any program, or perhaps you would like to volunteer to assist us to meet our goal of providing quality services and promoting independence for others in your community.\n\nFeel free to follow us on our website as well or visit us on our Facebook page.\n\nThank you again for taking the time to visit Access Better Living online.\n\nWe look forward to meeting you in person soon.\n\nCarol MacKinnon\n\nExecutive Director"
