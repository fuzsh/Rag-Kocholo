For the 1952 film of the same name, please see Neighbours (film)\n\nNeighbours is a long-running Australian television soap opera, running daily episodes of 25 minutes, time excluding commercials. It originally aired on the Seven Network in Australia in 1985 however they cancelled the series later that year. The series was immediately picked-up by rival Network Ten. It began screening on that channel in early 1986 and has remained popular with its core teenage audience ever since. The show was created by Reg Watson and is produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation.\n\nThe series follows the daily lives of several families who live in the fictional Ramsay Street, Erinsborough - although in fact it is restricted to the small cul-de-sac of six houses at the end of the street - and includes the usual soap staples of births, deaths, and marriages. The show features a regular turnover of attractive young actors mixed in with the more stable cast of older people. Though it is not commonly mentioned so as to not alienate viewers in other Australian cities, Erinsborough (an anagram of 'our neighbors') is undoubtedly supposed to be a suburb of Melbourne. The show is filmed in Melbourne, and for street scenes uses Pin Oak Court in Vermont South, a suburb in eastern Melbourne. Erinsborough is often contrasted with the neighbouring, and equally fictitious, suburb of Eden Hills. Other locations often mentioned (and sometimes seen) in the show include West Waratah and Waratah Heights.\n\nMany successful Australian actors and singers had some of their earliest work on Neighbours, including Kylie Minogue, Jesse Spencer, Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe (brief extra appearance), Natalie Imbruglia, Jason Donovan, Holly Valance, Mark Little and Delta Goodrem. Actor Alan Dale who had previously starred in The Young Doctors, played the central character of Jim Robinson for the show's first seven years and is now a recognisable star in US series such as 24 and The O.C.. One of the most enduring characters currently on the show is Harold Bishop, played by actor Ian Smith who has also written many of the scripts for the show.\n\nNeighbours is currently celebrating its 20th Anniversary in 2005.\n\nContents\n\n1 Neighbours internationally\n\n2 Current controversy\n\n3 Storylines\n\n4 Current characters\n\n4.1 Bishop/Mangel family:\n\n4.2 Scully family:\n\n4.3 Timmins/Rebecchi family:\n\n4.4 Hoyland family:\n\n4.5 Kinski family\n\n4.6 Robinson Family\n\n4.7 Parker Family\n\n4.8 Other:\n\n4.9 Pets:\n\n4.10 Recurring/Guest characters:\n\n5 Past characters\n\n6 Around Erinsborough\n\n7 See also\n\n8 External links\n\nNeighbours internationally\n\nThe show is also popular in the United Kingdom where it quickly gained a cult following after it began to be broadcast there in 1986. BBC One began by screening it at lunchtime, but it was soon given an early evening repeat slot by controller Michael Grade on the advice of his daughter. In the late 1980s it regularly had a UK audience in the tens of millions and was sometimes watched by more people than the population of Australia at that time. The episodes in the UK are now generally shown between one and three months after they are seen in Australia, as the BBC often removes the show from its schedule during major sports tournaments such as Wimbledon and bank holidays in order to take into account the fact that the show usually takes a four week break over the Christmas/New Year in Australia for the Southern Hemisphere summer.\n\nThe show has also been sold to networks in many other countries. Episodes from 1999 were aired for a six-week trial basis on the American channel Oxygen in March of 2004. At first, it was shown in the afternoon opposite higher-rated American soaps such as The Young and the Restless and All My Children, which gave the show anemic ratings from the first airing; the people who would be most interested in the show were watching other, more established serials. After a couple of weeks, the show moved to a late-night time slot and eventually left the air entirely. It was the sixth Australian soap opera to be aired in the United States (The Sullivans, Prisoner, Home and Away, Paradise Beach and Pacific Drive are the other five).\n\nCurrent controversy\n\nIn a court case currently being heard, former cast member Shane Connor is filing for wrongful dismissal. Evidence presented in court describes on-set problems such as arguments with cast and crew and lateness and absenteeism, possibly connected to the actor's period of drug usage after the death of his brother. 1\n\nStorylines\n\nMain article: Storylines of Neighbours\n\nIn the beginning, the show mainly focused on two families, the Robinsons and the Ramsays (after whom \"Ramsay Street\" is named) who were as the name of the show suggests, neighbours. The show initially gained notoriety for its depiction of the teenage romance of Scott Robinson and Charlene Ramsay. Their Romeo and Juliet style romance culminated in a wedding was keenly anticipated by viewers and is still fondly regarded today as being one of the high points of the series. Another popular couple in the show's early days was the pairing of Des Clarke and Daphne Lawrence, a couple who also lived on Ramsay Street alongside the Ramsays and the Robinsons. Daphne's death in 1988 is still considered as one of the most emotional moments on the show.\n\nBoth the Ramsays and the Robinsons have been written out of the series with the sole exception of the Bishop family who are related to the Ramsays through the marriage of Harold Bishop to the late Madge Ramsay. Also, one of the original characters, Paul Robinson, made a return to the show in the final episode of 2004 and became a regular character in early 2005. Today the show revolves around the Scully, Hoyland, Bishop and Timmins families, along with several other residents who live in Ramsay Street.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Neighbours gained the reputation as being a somewhat conservative soap with topics such as sex generally not being included in the storylines due to its early evening timeslot in Australia and the United Kingdom (Earlier storylines involving controversial topics such as incest and teenage sex were often censored by the BBC in the UK, which may account for the reluctance on the part of producers to depict controversial issues). In the past two years this has started to change, with the show now regularly featuring its teenage characters discussing issues such as sex and contraception in a manner which has not been seen on the show since the mid 1990s. Recently, the show has depicted a lesbian storyline involving Sky Mangel and Lana Crawford. There was also not one but two incest storylines; the first involving Serena Bishop and Luka Dokic, who embarked on an intimate relationship, blissfully ignorant of the fact theat they were half-siblings, sharing a mother, Liljana Bishop. The second storyline to touch on this taboo subject was the plotline in which Harold Bishop became obsessed with a younger woman who bore an uncanny resemblance to his deceased daughter, Kerry (in fact, the character was played by Linda Hartley-Clark, who did indeed play Kerry Bishop years earlier.) The pair went as far as sharing a kiss, which ultimately made Harold 'snap out' of his obsession. The character of Sindi Watts has also been involved in storylines involving stripping and more recently prostitution.\n\nThe break up of long time married couple Karl and Susan Kennedy and soon after Joe and Lyn Scully has also been a great source of interest to viewers, especially since it has led to a long running storyline in which Izzy Hoyland duped Karl into believing that he was the father of her unborn child continuing the charade long after she tragically miscarried in November 2004. After over a year of manipulation, Izzy's lies came to light in a spectacular fashion, and despite a last ditch attempt by Izzy to gain Karl's sympathy by falsely claiming that she was raped, Karl finally dumped Izzy for good.\n\nSpoiler warning for British viewers: The following paragraph reveals a major plot development that has yet to be broadcast in the UK.\n\nLate in the 2005 season came a highly dramatic storyline where a large contingency of Ramsey Street regulars went on a joyflight on a Douglas DC-3 aircraft over Bass Strait. A time bomb had also been planted in the plane's undercarriage. During the flight Izzy discovered a note to her saying 'To my one and only... think about your life and everything you've done.'\n\nThe bomb soon went off, sending the plane crashing into the ocean below. At least David, Liljana and Serena were killed. Susan was missing for a few days but eventually rescued. Dylan and Connor, who believe Dylan is wanted for armed robbery, survived washed up on a desolate beach and have decided to fake their own deaths by assuming new identities.\n\nThe identity of the bomber has yet to be uncovered. [[1]]\n\nCurrent characters\n\nSpoiler warning: This list is based on the Australian cast, and will sometimes reflect arrivals and departures which have not been broadcast in the UK.\n\nThese are the current main characters, who each appear in two or three episodes every week, apart from fairly rare breaks for the actors' other real life commitments. (The actors all get a month off at the same time for their main holidays). Most main characters feature for at least two years, but only a fairly small minority last for more than five years.\n\nThe list on the right shows the current (Australian) cast in order of seniority by first appearance. The characters marked with asterisks have had more than one spell on the show, with gaps of several years between them. The table is based on their first ever appearances, the episode number of which is shown in brackets.\n\nBishop/Mangel family:\n\nHarold Bishop (Ian Smith) (1987-1991, 1996, 1997 onwards) - former coffee-shop owner (before it burned down), General Store co-owner, devout Christian, Salvation Army member, tuba player, slightly naÃ¯ve, often comic relief, widower of the late Madge Bishop, father of David and Kerry Bishop, grandfather of Sky Mangel and Serena Bishop. Harold was given up for dead in 1991, when it was thought he had been washed out to sea. Five years later, however, in one of the show's more unlikely storylines, Harold reappeared in Erinsborough as a Salvation Army worker named Ted. He recently suffered a stroke, but has since recovered. However, the stroke brought out some elements of his personality which had been previously hidden from his loved ones and the audience. During the crash of the joy-flight plane in 2005, Harold lost his son David, David's wife Liljana, and grand-daughter Serena.\n\nSky Mangel (Miranda Fryer) (Stephanie McIntosh) (1988-1991, 2003 onwards) - Harold's teenage granddaughter, daughter of Joe Mangel and Kerry Bishop (deceased), ex-girlfriend of Boyd Hoyland, to whom she lost her virginity, currently dating Dylan Timmins.

Kim turned his family down, and as a result of this, Janelle left him, blaming him for turning down the one opportunity they had to start a \"real family\".

Mike pressured her into having unprotected sex with him, and she dumped him shortly afterwards. Is now trying to crack onto Boyd. She has counselling sessions with Karl, in which she eventually developed a dependance on Karl, which led to Janelle thinking that Karl was taking advantage of Janae, almost destroying Karl's career.\n\nBreeana \"Bree\" Timmins (Sianoa Smit-McPhee) (2005 onwards) - The youngest of the Timmins children, friend of Summer Hoyland, Rachel Kinski and Zeke Kinski, who she has a romantic interest in.
