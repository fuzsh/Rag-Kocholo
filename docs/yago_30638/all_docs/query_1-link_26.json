        "text": "Eliza Jane Morley (née Taylor-Cotter; born 24 October 1989), known professionally as Eliza Taylor, is an Australian actress. She is best known for her roles as Janae Timmins on the Australian soap opera drama Neighbours (2005–2008), as Clarke Griffin on the dystopian science fiction series The 100 (2014–2020), and as Hannah Carson in the NBC science fiction series Quantum Leap (2022–2024).\n\nEarly life\n\nTaylor was born in Melbourne and has three siblings: two sisters and one brother. Her mother is an author and a graphic designer, and her stepfather was a stand-up comedian, while her biological father used to own cafés around Melbourne. She wanted to be a marine biologist growing up.\n\nCareer\n\n2003–2013: Career beginnings and Neighbours\n\nAfter a lead role in Pirate Islands, Taylor starred as Rosie Cartwright in The Sleepover Club in 2003. She transitioned to mature audience programs with a guest role on Blue Heelers in 2003.\n\nTaylor got her big breakthrough in the Australian soap opera Neighbours in 2005. She secured the role of Janae Timmins after previously appearing in a guest role in 2003. Taylor had originally auditioned for the role of Lana Crawford, however, actress Bridget Neval was eventually cast. In 2007, Nell Feeney and Sianoa Smit-McPhee, who play Taylor's on-screen mother Janelle Timmins and sister Bree Timmins, were written out by executive producer Ric Pellizzeri, but it was confirmed that they wanted Taylor to remain in the serial as Janae. Later that year, Taylor decided to quit the serial to pursue other projects such as pantomime and a further career in the US. One of her reasons was that all of her on-screen family had been written out and new cast members gave the serial the feel of a different place, adding: \"It just didn't feel like the family that I joined when I started three years ago\". Taylor finished filming her final studio scenes in 2007 and her final episode was screened on 8 February 2008. In 2007, she was nominated for Best Female at the Inside Soap Awards.\n\nTaylor travelled to the UK in late November 2007, and on 1 December 2007 she turned on the Weymouth Christmas lights.

In 2009, she was in an episode of All Saints and filmed a short drama-comedy movie called The Laundromat. Taylor also filmed a role in the horror movie 6 Plots. She later filmed the pilot of Winners & Losers.\n\n2014–2020: The 100\n\nOn 1 March 2013, it was announced that Taylor had been cast as lead character Clarke Griffin in the new post-apocalyptic science fiction drama series The 100 on The CW.\n\nIn 2014, Taylor starred as Sarah in the thriller film The November Man.\n\nFor her role in The 100, Taylor was nominated for Choice TV Actress: Sci-Fi/Fantasy at the Teen Choice Awards from 2015 to 2018.\n\nIn 2017, Taylor starred as Kat Carter in a thriller-drama film Thumper. The same year, she starred as Ellen Langford in the Netflix Christmas romantic comedy-drama film Christmas Inheritance.\n\n2021–present: Recent work\n\nIn 2021, Taylor directed two music videos: \"Vices\" by Sarah and the Sundays, in which she also had an acting role, and \"Bad Posture\" by Abby Anderson.\n\nIn 2022, Taylor appeared in the guest role of Doctor Villka in The Orville episode \"From Unknown Graves\".\n\nIn 2023, Taylor and Morley star together as Julie and Marcus in the sci-fi thriller I'll Be Watching. She is also an executive producer. The film was released on digital platforms. The same year, Taylor is an executive producer and stars as Ruby Allen in the independent romantic comedy It Only Takes a Night. The film was also released on digital platforms.\n\nIn October same year, Taylor is playing the role of Hannah Carson in Quantum Leap as a new series regular in season 2.\n\nPersonal life\n\nOn 7 June 2019, Taylor announced on Twitter that she had married Bob Morley, her co-star on The 100. Taylor and Morley were originally set to direct episodes for the seventh and final season of The 100. However, Taylor was unable to direct her episode due to suffering from a miscarriage. On 20 March 2022, they announced the birth of their first child, a son.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2012 6 Plots Amy Challis 2013 Patrick Nurse Panicale 2014 The November Man Sarah 2017 Thumper Kat Carter/Meredith Christmas Inheritance Ellen Langford 2023 I'll Be Watching Julie Executive producer It Only Takes a Night Ruby Allen Executive producer\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2003 Pirate Islands Sarah Redding Main role Neighbours Jacinta Martin 2 episodes The Sleepover Club Rosie Cartwright Main role (series 1) 2004 Blue Heelers Tatum O'Hara Episode: \"Cast the First Stone\" 2005–2008 Neighbours Janae Timmins Main role 2006 Blue Water High Heidi Lee Episode #35; uncredited 2008 Rush Madison Episode: \"Get Lucky\" 2009 Packed to the Rafters Kerry Episode: \"Losing the Touch\" All Saints Carly Spalding Episode: \"The Two of Us\" 2010 City Homicide Melissa Standish Episode: \"Last Seen\" Winners & Losers Bridget Gross Episode: Pilot 2012 Howzat!
