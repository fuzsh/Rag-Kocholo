        "text": "The fascinating life and work of photographer and film maker, Kim Ondaatje.\n\nThis book is a biography of artist, film maker, and photographer, Kim Ondaatje, n√©e Betty Jane Kimbark. Born into a wealthy family, Kim's story is a reverse of the rags to riches narrative. She married two highly successful writers, Douglas Jones and Michael Ondaatje, had six children, and managed to carve a career as a respected artist whose works are in all major galleries/museums in Canada. Kim Ondaatje's life is fascinating on many fronts. She is undoubtedly talented, and has contributed significantly to the Canadian art scene. One of her paintings from the Factory series hangs in the newly opened Canadian gallery at the Art Gallery of Ontario. She continues to be creative as she approaches her nineties.\n\nLiterary Nonfiction. Women's Studies. Art."
