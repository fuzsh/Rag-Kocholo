        "text": "New life for AFI awards\n\nThe Australian Film Institute hopes to rebuild the status of its annual film and television awards by again engaging a commercial free-to-air broadcaster. The awards, to be held in Melbourne in late November, were last televised live by the ABC in 2003 after low-rating outings on the Seven and Ten networks. Last year the ABC screened highlights as part of At the Movies. The AFI awards have recently lost standing in the industry to the popularly voted ifawards, televised on SBS. An announcement on the AFIs is expected soon.\n\nAll roads to Ramsay Street\n\nAs Marcello Russo moves out of Ramsay Street - her family departing in a blaze of tragedy befitting Australia's long-running soap - Russo's real-life partner, actor Brett Swain, moves in. Swain has started work at Neighbours' Nunawading studios playing Kim Timmins, father of the unruly tribe of Timmins teens. Proving just how small the Australian film and TV world is, Kim Timmins' wife, Janelle, is played by Nell Feeney, who also played Swain's wife in the film Mallboy, and one of his sons, Dylan Timmins, is played by Damien Bodie, who worked with Swain in the children's series Fergus McPhail. Fergus McPhail also starred Megan Harrington, the elder daughter of Kevin Harrington, who plays Russo's on-screen husband David Bishop and who co-starred with Swain in SeaChange. Phew! And if that isn't enough, Swain's first role on Neighbours was as the duckshooter who shot and killed David Bishop's sister, Kerry, in the early 1990s. His new episodes appear late next month.\n\nCarlton Neighbours\n\nTheir Neighbours roles might be over, but Marcello Russo and Kevin Harrington are continuing to work together - co-starring in a Neil Cole play, The Trial of Adolph Eichmann. Donny Bridges, Jim Daley and Neighbours acting coach Mike Bishop also appear, and Alice Bishop is directing. It opens at the Carlton Courthouse on October 19.\n\nUK alliance\n\nCable channel UKTV launches its first local production on October 10, a six-part Australia-British comedy filmed in central Australia. Supernova was written by Harry Cripps and co-stars Rob Brydon and Kris McQuade. You won't see his face, but keep an ear out for actor Morgan O'Neill in a brief but entertaining role as the jealous astronaut boyfriend of one of the cast. O'Neill is better known as Project Greenlight's winning director. His efforts shooting his first feature film, Solo, can be seen on Foxtel's Movie Extra."
