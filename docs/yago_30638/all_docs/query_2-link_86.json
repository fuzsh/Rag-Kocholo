        "text": "LAPORTE, Darcy G.\n\nJuly 1965 - 2023\n\nDarcy's Necrology and Invite to a Celebration of Life\n\nThe Laporte family announces with great sadness the passing of our dear Darcy at the age of 57 on May 1, 2023.\n\nDear departed husband of Julie Laporte (Grainger) father of Travis (London, Ontario) and Tyler Laporte (Toronto, Ontario) stepfather to Ashley Hilchey and husband A. J. Hilchey (of Lexington, North Carolina). Beloved son of the late Darcy Laporte and Bérénice (Lapointe) Laporte-Nissen (married 1981) and stepson of Aage Nissen. Darcy is also survived by his Laporte siblings: Rachelle (Michael Murphy) of Toronto, Louise of Harlingen, Texas, and Claire (Michael Robinson) of Toronto and of his younger brother Michel/Mitch (Sarah) of Uxbridge. Dear uncle of 5 nieces and nephews (Daniel, Quinn, Ellen, Darcy and George) as well as one granddaughter (Taylor) and 3 grandnephews (Carter, Lincoln and Brooks). Dear nephew and cousin of all the Lapointe Laporte-Nissen family. He also leaves behind Kim Laitila (mother of Travis and Tyler) of London, Ontario.\n\nDarcy was fun loving, loyal, and had a great, subtle sense of humour. His commitment to siblings was evident during his heroic effort to preserve the family heritance by purchasing back the family home and the cottage on Gibson Lake, from Aage Nissen. Darcy was courageous and advocated for all us siblings at the time.\n\nDarcy's career at Northern Allied started while in high school and evolved with the support of George Scott and the NASCO family, eventually leading to a full-time career as a gas fitter and heavy equipment operator.\n\nConfident and self-taught, Darcy was eager to try new career paths such as restoring his most beloved speed/ski boat - sewing all the upholstery himself to a newly founded husband and wife dog/animal grooming shop in Sudbury. Clearly in the years spanning 1990 - late 1999, he felt he could do it all, exploring many fronts - seeking the best fits.\n\nDarcy married Kim Laitila in those years, and had two sons settling in Copper Cliff Sudbury, moving to Timmins, and for a short time Toronto, divorcing in late 1999.\n\nIn 2001, Darcy married Julie Ann Grainger from N.C., USA. Julie and Darcy had the best of both countries, living at times in Timmins/Sudbury early on and again later. In the latter times, Darcy was the lead contractor spring 2012- December 2015 at Lake Wahnapitae-the Laporte/Murphy cottage while employed at PSL in Sudbury as a gasfitter, then returning in 2016, to their recently built home in Lexington, N.C.\n\nDarcy was loved deeply and will be dearly missed.\n\nYou are now invited to attend A Celebration of Darcy's life, on Saturday, June 10, 2023, 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. at the Old Mill, Balmoral Room, 21 Old Mill Road, Toronto Ontario Canada M8X 1G5.\n\nIf you are planning to attend and for donations, please contact Rachelle at 647-406-4209."
