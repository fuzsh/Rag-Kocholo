        "text": "Your doctor’s participation in an ACO enhances your benefits at no extra charge to you. However, you are still responsible for any regular co-insurance costs not covered by Medicare. Below is a list of some of the benefits you will find as a member of our ACO.\n\nRead your beneficiary letter here.\n\nHelps your doctors know your health history and talk to one another about your care and coordinate your health care needs.\n\nMay save you time and money by avoiding repeated tests and unneeded appointments.\n\nMay make it easier to spot potential problems before they become more serious—like drug interactions that can happen if one doctor isn’t aware of what another has prescribed.\n\nAccess to expanded benefits at no extra cost. Ask your health care provider if you qualify.\n\nHome Health Homebound Waiver for patients with two or more chronic conditions.\n\nVirtual Care Expansion Waiver\n\nThree Day Skilled Nursing Facility Waiver\n\nNurse Practitioner/Physician Assistant Services Waiver\n\nConcurrent Care for patients that elect Medicare Hospice\n\nAllows patients with a known cancer or end stage renal disease (ESRD) diagnosis or patient entering a skilled nursing facility to enroll in hospice care while still allowing them to benefit from symptom management such as pain control, oncology treatments or dialysis.\n\nChronic Disease Management Reward\n\nAllows aligned patients to receive a nominal gift card for participating in their care.\n\nCost-Sharing for Medicare Part B Services\n\nAllows aligned patients to achieve a higher quality of life by reducing financial barriers to advance one or more of the following clinical goals: 1) Adherence to a treatment regimen 2) Adherence to a drug regiment 3) Adherence to a follow up care plan and management of a chronic disease or condition 4) Better manage of patients high cost and chronic conditions.\n\nImportant! An ACO won’t limit your choice of health care providers. It isn’t a Medicare Advantage Plan. If your doctor is part of an ACO, you still have the right to visit any doctor, hospital, or other provider that accepts Medicare at any time.\n\nOne of the most important benefits of an ACO is that your doctors and other providers can communicate and coordinate your care. To help with that, Medicare gives certain information about your care to your health care providers’ ACO. Sharing your data in this way helps make sure all the people involved in your care have access to your health information when and where they need it, to work together to get you the care you need. If you don’t want Medicare to share your health care information this way, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) and tell that to the representative. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048. If you decide you don’t want Medicare to give your health care information to your doctors, Medicare will continue to use your information for some purposes, like evaluating financial performance and quality of care.\n\nTo learn more about ACO's, visit https://www.medicare.gov/ or call 1-800-MEDICARE. TTY users can call 1-877-486-2048.\n\nACOs are under an agreement with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to participate in the Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health (ACO REACH) Model.\n\nMedical records are located on a separate secured network. Access to the secure network is granted only to appropriate staff and physicians, who have received extensive training on the system. Doctors, hospitals and other health care providers working together in the ACO will access your medical records only when necessary, to help improve your care. Sharing medical information with providers with-in the ACO allows us to identify your specific care needs. The privacy and security of your medical information is protected by federal law.\n\nMedical records are located on a separate secured network.
