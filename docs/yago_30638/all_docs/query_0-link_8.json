        "text": "Ramsay Street will be infested by even more Timmins as 2006 comes to a close. With the Timmins grandma about to make herself known on the Street for a extended guest spot, there's new news about even more family members joining the cast.\n\nTessa James will be first see as 'Ann' (the Timmins long lost daughter) on Aussie screens at the start of September.\n\nDwayne and Brandon Timmins will also be joining, but not together. Dwayne is going to cause some trouble in the street, and an insider explains 'He's one bad guy that won't be reformed like most of the Ramsay Street villian's.\n\nHe'll be followed by Brandon, who's possibily the nicest Timmins of them all, although not the cleverest of people. Expect a hillarious combination when Brandon and Pepper get it together - They are apparently \"made for each other\" - think a Hugo and Alice from the Vicar of Dibley type pairing with these two.\n\nAnd there are rumours that Brett Swain is being invited back to rejoin the cast for another temporary stint, early next year. Brett has, however claimed to have said that the producers will need to work around his schedule.\n\nPlus, there's a baby Timmins on the way too. But who are the parents? (Possibily Sky and Stingray's child, but this is quite obvious).\n\nI believe these to be true, but again - new source. Although lots of the one's that were dismissed on here by the writers have turned out to be completely true! Like Sky's baby, and Lolly returning, and Izzy getting involved in Susan and Karl's relationship again!\n\nOoo, finally... because once I pop, I just can't stop - A runner told my source that we'd be seeing \"the ultimate soap opera slap\" and a \"major intense fight scene between two brothers\" (no points for guessing who that'll be) coming up on Oz screens within the next couple of months - it's one that will sting for a while. These explosive scenes will be two of those moments like Susan's breakdown in the Street over Izzy's baby, and Karl's attack on Izzy outside the Scarlet bar, and Flick and Steph's street confrontaton - You won't forget them for a while apparently, and the cast working on set that day were \"stunned\"\n\nIm sorry that i can't give you more spoilers!\n\nforgive me!\n\nNeighboursfans.com\n\n0"
