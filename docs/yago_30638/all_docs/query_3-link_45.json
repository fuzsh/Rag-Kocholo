When an amazing opportunity outside of Microsoft presented itself, they were my biggest cheerleaders. Thank you to my amazing Microsoft CE&S network (there are too many of you to name here) and our Delivery Partners for your partnership and trust - and lots of laughs along the way - as we worked to drive value within the business and improve our customers' support experiences. My time at Microsoft, and the opportunity to work with each of you, has been one of the greatest privileges of my career. This is not goodbye, but see you later.... #thankyou #grateful #grateful #microsoft"
