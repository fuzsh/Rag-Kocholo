        "text": "Article content\n\nA former elementary school teacher who committed an “abhorrent” breach of trust through her sexual conduct with four students has been sentenced to seven months in jail.\n\nIn addition to jail, Kim Gervais, 37, received two years of probation after pleading guilty in Timmins Superior Court of Justice on Wednesday to three counts of sexual interference and one count of inviting for a sexual purpose.\n\nThe students involved were boys, ages 12 to 13 at the time of the offenses.\n\nGervais was their teacher at École catholique Anicet-Morin.\n\nThe offenses involving sexual contact were committed at her residence.\n\nThe earliest offense occurred in September 2007 when she gave one boy an open-mouthed French kiss.\n\nFollowing that, there was an incident in which Gervais texted a boy and offered to perform oral sex on him if he came to her house. The boy didn’t take her up on that offer.\n\nThe most recent offenses occurred in December 2011 when Gervais allowed two boys whom had she invited to her house to kiss her breasts. Leading up to that encounter, there had been some sexually charged texts exchanged between the teacher and the students.\n\nAssistant Crown Attorney Wayne O’Hanley said the offenses came to light only after the one of the victims’ moms “sensed there was something wrong” and reviewed her son’s text messages. She confronted her son about the texts and subsequently contacted the police.\n\nFollowing her arrest in January 2012, Gervais was suspended without pay by the local French Catholic school board which employed her.\n\nIn anticipation of the consequences of being convicted of the charges against her, Gervais submitted her resignation more than a week ago.\n\nHer lawyer, Sylvano Carlesso, told the court, “Her career is over, her education is meaningless now.”\n\nGiven the opportunity to address the court before sentencing, Gervais said, “I’ve endured the most embarrassing day that I will ever experience. However, I recognize the embarrassment that I feel ... is because of my conduct which I have no one to blame but myself.\n\n“I have lived a life of hell from the day I was arrested.”\n\nThe married mother of three expressed regret over the shame she has brought to her husband, her children and her family.\n\n“I want to completely express my sincere apology not only to the four boys” but to their parents, Gervais said.\n\nJudge Louise Gauthier told the court Gervais betrayed a “breach of trust” in a “particularly abhorrent way.”\n\nGervais’ conduct displayed “not only a lack of personal control and a lack of professionalism” but one that was “predatory in nature,” the judge said.\n\nCarlesso told the court, in light of Gervais’ conduct, “there’s obviously an issue of a psychological nature that requires ... some treatment.”\n\nCarlesso said Gervais requested that she serve her time in the Algoma Treatment Centre where she can receive appropriate counselling.\n\nThe sentence of seven months in jail was presented as a joint recommendation of both the prosecution and the defence attorneys.\n\nO’Hanley said the “guilty plea is significant” in that it spared the boys from having to testify and face the “ordeal of cross examination” over these events.\n\nThe judge agreed to the sentencing recommendation taking into account the public notoriety and embarrassment from these offenses as well as Gervais’ loss of employment and the end of her career as a teacher.\n\nThe two-year probationary order includes conditions that Gervais have no contact with the victims, that she be amenable to any treatment suggested to her by her probation officer, and that she not be alone with any boy under the age of 14.\n\nFor a period of 10 years, she will be required to register with the local police and notify them of any change of address."
