Alan Fletcher is also married his wife was in the audience when he did that soap star superstar.\n\n0\n\ncorrie_girl wrote:\n\nNo thats denied. Even Rupert Hill's (Jamie) ex-girlfriend has said that is definitely not true. Although they did split up with their partners around the same time.\n\nWell, the night before the story featured in the NOTW, my partner and I saw them huddled together in a dark corner of our local pub (The Wells, in Hampstead). They looked fairly 'friendly' at the time....\n\n0\n\nmandsboileeds wrote:\n\nben & Izzy in Hollyoaks\n\nLisa in Hollyoaks & Danny in Emmerdale\n\nI don't think Ben ever went out with Izzy in real life - he did date Mandy from Hollyoaks for a few years though until they split up a year or so ago.\n\nLisa and Danny split ages ago - she was dating some footballer but it was in the papers today they have now split up.\n\n0\n\ngrant.mitchell wrote:\n\nLiliana Bishop (neighbours) is married in real life to Kim Timmins (neighbours)\n\nAlan Fletcher (karl kennedy from neighbours, who I will be meeting on saturday, yay!) fathered a baby by his onscreen daughter Libby (Kym Valentine), and they are still very much together I think.\n\nAlan fletcher is married to an oz news women since 1990 they have two kids\n\nkym is also married to Fabian Tolli with only one child born\n\n2003\n\n0"
