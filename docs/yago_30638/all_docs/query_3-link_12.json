        "text": "𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗠𝘆𝘁𝗵𝘀 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗛𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 We define a myth as something that is commonly believed to be true but has no basis in fact. It is common for human beings to harbour self-limiting myths about ourselves, and that prevents us from achieving our full potential. Just because we believe something to be true doesn’t make it so. In his book The Happiness Trap Dr Russ Harris sites four common myths about happiness: 𝟭. 𝗛𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗯𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 – Tell that to someone who is lonely or has low self-esteem, to someone who is being bullied or a victim of prejudice. That can lead to a belief that everybody is happy except me. 𝟮. 𝗜𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝘆, 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 – We all feel anxious and stressed sometimes, we wouldn’t be normal if we didn’t. In order to live a full life, we have to experience the full gamut of emotions. 𝟯. 𝗧𝗼 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗮 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲, 𝘄𝗲 𝗺𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗿𝗶𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝗻𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀 – The reality is, the things we value most in life give rise to a whole range of feelings – pleasant and unpleasant. It is part of the duality of life – pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, fun and sadness. 𝟰. 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗯𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗹 – This is true for the most part, but we know that random thoughts can pop into our heads at any time and it’s not uncommon for us to feel out of sorts at times. Once you become aware of an unwanted thought you can choose to entertain it or let it go. As for feeling out of sorts there could be a myriad of reasons for that, the good news is it’s usually a passing condition. I like Viktor Frankl’s take on happiness – “It’s the very pursuit of happiness that thwarts happiness. Happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. One must have a reason to be happy”. #happiness #myths #stress #wellbeing\n\n𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 – 𝗔 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗿 For the past two years my colleagues and I have been hearing comments to the effect that people wished that Covid would disappear so they could get on with their lives. Understandable, but not practical. Our lives go on irrespective, be it for better or for worse. Martin Luther-King Jnr said, “Our ultimate test is not where we stand in moments of comfort and convenience, but where we stand at times of challenge and controversy”. Adversity is an inevitable part of life. That being the case, what do people who are able to rise to meet the challenges and buffeting of everyday life do that separates them from those who don’t? There are probably as many answers to that question as there are people, so to give simple answers to what are complex behavioural problems would be folly. There are however three things that people who learn from and grow through adversity do: 1. They understand and accept that adversity is part of human existence. That prevents them from feeling discriminated against by not asking the unanswerable question, “why me”? A more realistic question to ask would be, “why not me”? That stops them from becoming the victim and immersing themselves in the destructive state of self-pity. 2. They focus on what they can change or influence and are able to accept the things they can’t. That process doesn’t usually happen instantaneously, it may take some time to come to terms with. It is helpful to remind ourselves of the phrase, ‘Grant me the SERENITY to accept the things I cannot change, the COURAGE to change the things I can and the WISDOM to know the difference. 3. Ask the question, “is this (thought, attitude or behaviour) helping me or hindering me”? The key to that question is self-awareness. When you catch yourself not thinking or behaving in your best interests or self-sabotaging, that simple question acts as an effective ‘circuit breaker’. You are then in a position to stop that thought and replace it with a more helpful one. Like it or not, experiencing adversity is part of being a human being. Nobody invites it into their lives, but if you can accept it and learn from it, it becomes one of the primary engines of human development, even if it doesn’t feel like it at the time. #people #development #adversity #change\n\nHospitality is at the heart of what we do and our Lion initiative, Cheers To Your Local, gives our customers and the wider hospitality industry support after what’s been an incredibly tough time for our cafes, bars and restaurants. Featuring a range of well-known Kiwis and hospitality legends, including my mate Leigh Hart, Cheers to Your Local gives hospitality venues a platform to share their stories and calls on Kiwis to show their support by inviting friends and family to join them at their local. While the campaign has been created by Lion it’s not just for our venues or customers - the entire industry has been invited and encouraged to use the platform and get involved. Leigh and I are actually competitors, he has some “Quite Nice Beer” Wakachangi - brewed by Uncle Kenny, and I sell some really nice beer from the Lion portfolio – but this is not about Leigh or I, this is about getting hospitality up and running again. So get out there, make a date, take a mate and say “cheers!” to your local. @cheerstoyourlocalnz #cheerstoyourlocalnz"
