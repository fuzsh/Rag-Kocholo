Passed away peacefully at the Timmins and District Hospital with his daughter Kim by his side, on Tuesday December 22, 2020. Predeceased by his wife Yvette (Renaud), his parents Stanley and Gwen (Skewes), his sisters Norma (Roy), Jean (Ross), Gloria (Smith) and Patricia (Kidd), three infant siblings and his grandson James Clifford (JC). He is survived by his children, Cliff (Carrie), Lynn Clouatre (Mike), Susan Loregio (Tom), Brenda (Val), Kim Hodgins (Garry), Ken (Cathy) and Gary, his grandchildren, Sean, Carly, Amanda, Natasha, Andrew, Karissa, Kyle, Stephanie, Darrel, Ashley, Christian, Daryk and Juliana, nine great-grandchildren, several nieces and nephews, and his brother-in-law, Alex Smith.

Dad was born and raised in Timmins. He married the love of his life, Yvette, on March 4, 1954 and together they raised 7 children. They were married for 36 years before her passing in 1990. He was a jack-of-all-trades and worked in various fields prior to finding his true calling as a sheet metal worker. He worked at John's Neon Signs for many years before becoming co-owner of Norad Services. He constructed and installed signs for many businesses in Timmins and throughout Northern Ontario. Dad was a kind soul with a big heart and would go out of his way to help anyone in need. He was a walking book of knowledge, with a witty sense of humour and always ready with a joke to encourage a laugh or a smile from anyone who would listen. He was loved by many.

The family would like to extend a special thank you to Dr. Camille Boulay, Dr. Nancy Woods and the nurses on second floor medical at the Timmins and District Hospital.

Cremation has taken place. A memorial service will be held at a later date. Remembrance donations to the Timmins and District Hospital Foundation would be greatly appreciated. Online condolences and donations can be made at
