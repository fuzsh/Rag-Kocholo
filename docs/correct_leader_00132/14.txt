Fiji Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry highlighted the strength and resilience displayed by the late Dr Tupeni Baba when taken hostage during two coups in 1987 and 2000.

On May 14, 1987, he was taken captive by then Lt Col Sitiveni Rabuka and kept under house arrest for 6 days along with Dr Bavadra and other members of his Cabinet.

And in the 2000 coup, he was kept hostage at gunpoint for 56 days along with then Prime Minister Mr Chaudhry and other ministers and members.

“In both the coups, Dr Baba showed exemplary courage and fortitude refusing to give in to intimidation by gun-toting soldiers,” Mr Chaudhry said in a tribute to the late former politician and academic.

“In the 2000 hostage crisis, even though we were separated along racial lines and kept in separate locations, Dr Baba managed to keep in touch with me on developments.

“He was a constant source of strength and comfort to his colleagues. As my Deputy PM, he managed to keep in touch with me through notes, providing his own opinion and advice on critical issues.

“He had an affable, pleasant personality and was a strong advocate of social justice. He did not contest the 1992 and 1994 general elections under the racist 1990 constitution.

“Dr Baba had contributed significantly to Labour’s formative years and will be remembered for the legacy he left behind.”

Dr Baba was a founding member of the Fiji Labour Party and served as its Deputy PM and Minister for Foreign Affairs in Mr Chaudhry’s Labour-led government.

He was also Labour’s Minister for Education, Youth and Sports in the Bavadra Government of 1987 which was removed after just a month in office in Fiji’s first coup détat staged by Mr Rabuka.

Dr Baba broke away from the Fiji Labour Party and formed the New United Labour Party to contest the 2001 general election.
