Fiji's Labour leader and former prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, has been found guilty of defrauding the country's reserve bank.

High Court Justice Paul Madigan concurred with a panel of assessors, who earlier on Friday found Mr Chaudhry guilty of crimes under the Exchange Control Act.

The offence's relate to his failure to surrender around $AUD1.5 million and dealing in the currency without the permission of the governor of the Reserve Bank.

Mr Chaudhry will be sentenced next month, and faces up to two years imprisonment.

If he is sentenced to more than six months jail, Mr Chaudhry will not be allowed to stand in Fiji's upcoming elections.

Mr Chaudhry was Fiji's first and only Indo-Fijian prime minister. He was removed from office in a military coup in 2000 after being held captive in Parliament House for nearly 60 days.
