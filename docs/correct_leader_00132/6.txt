Chaudhry demands reinstatement: AFP

Fiji's deposed prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry today demanded reinstatement of his government, thrown out of office by a rebel nationalist coup.

Chaudhry, released on Thursday after being held hostage at gunpoint by the rebels for 56 days, said to do otherwise would be "to condone anarchy".

"Any principled leader would not give in," he told reporters in Suva.

"At all costs we must uphold constitutional democracy. A vocal and violent minority is holding this nation to ransom."

The international community has warned of sanctions, slashed aid and international isolation for Fiji after allies of coup leader George Speight took power yesterday.

On Thursday Speight released the last of 18 hostages, including Chaudhry, the country's first ethnic Indian leader, whom he seized in parliament in the capital Suva on May 19.

The next day the rebel nationalists made a bold attempt to show the world a peaceful face by handing in their weapons, most of them stolen from Fiji's military forces.

But the unrest and race hate against ethnic Indians, who constitute more than 40 per cent of the population and who are widely resented by the indigenous community for their business success, is continuing.

Speight supporters continued to man roadblocks around the country and Fiji's only hydropower station, also in the hands of coup sympathisers, was still closed.

Fiji's new President Ratu Josefa Iloilo Iloilo will name his 24-month interim government tomorrow.
