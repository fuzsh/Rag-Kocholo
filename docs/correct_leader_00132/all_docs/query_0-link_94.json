        "text": "FIJI'S former prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry, who was overthrown in a coup, demonstrated his refusal to accept his fate yesterday when he arrived in Australia to seek international support for the reinstatement of his government.\n\nMr Chaudhry will meet John Howard, the Australian Prime Minister, today and is expected to ask for continued sanctions and increased pressure on Fiji to return his elected multiracial administration to power. After arriving at Sydney airport, Mr Chaudhry said he had also been advised to have full medical checks, as he was weak and underweight after being held at gunpoint for eight weeks inside Suva's parliament complex.\n\nHe tentatively ruled out forming a government in exile, an option he and his deposed colleagues had been considering. Australia, New Zealand, Britain and America have already imposed sanctions, but it is as yet unclear how the world will react to the unelected nationalist government that has been appointed to steer Fiji towards fresh elections in three years.\n\nIts agenda largely encapsulates the key aim of the imprisoned coup leader, George Speight, and his gang - political and social supremacy for indigenous Fijians, and the consequent marginalisation of the nation's ethnic Indians, who make up 44 per cent of the population and dominate trade and commerce.\n\nWhile no direct supporters of Speight are included in the line-up, the new government is almost entirely composed of indigenous Fijians and features a number of hardline nationalists known to have been eager to have Mr Chaudhry's regime deposed.\n\nMr Howard welcomed the opportunity to meet Mr Chaudhry and to convey Australia's \"concern and distress\" over the events of the past 10 weeks. He said: \"The Australian government encourages the people of Fiji and those in authority in Fiji to bring about the restoration of full parliamentary democracy and to turn away from a suggestion of a new constitution which discriminates against Fijian people of Indian heritage.\""
