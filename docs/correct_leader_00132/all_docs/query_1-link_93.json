        "text": "Speight's supporter is new Fiji President\n\nDeposed Fiji prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry and 17 other political hostages were freed today after 55 days in captivity and a supporter of coup leader George Speight was appointed as the new president of the island nation.\n\nThe hostages, captured on May 19 when coup leader George Speight raided Parliament, left the parliamentary complex in Red Cross trucks.\n\nThey were taken to the organisation's headquarters in central Suva to be examined by doctors before being allowed to go home.\n\nSoon after their release, Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs appointed Ratu Josefa Iloila, a supporter of Speight, as the island nation's new president.\n\nThe chiefs earlier warned Speight they would delay naming a President if deposed prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry and 17 other political captives were not freed.\n\nIloilo announced he will later this week name a government. Speight has said he would be \"honoured\" to hold prime minister's office.\n\nFormer president Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, 80, stepped down and fled to the remote Lau Islands on May 29 when the Fijian military imposed martial law.\n\nChaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian premier, emerged from his ordeal battered but unbowed, insisting his priority was to get the country back on its feet.\n\nTalking to reporters outside his Suva Point home, Chaudhry confirmed he had been beaten up in the first week of his captivity. But said he had not been badly hurt, as had been widely feared.\n\n\"I am a tough guy. I can take it,\" he said with a smile.\n\nChaudhry, sporting a grey beard and looking considerably older and thinner, said he bore no animosity towards Speight, a failed businessman.\n\n\"I have no ill feelings towards anybody, I am a very forgiving person,\" he said. He had spent two hours talking to Speight just before his release, he said.\n\nThe political crisis sparked off by the coup has left Fiji facing economic ruin and international isolation, with many members of its minority Indian population contemplating emigration.\n\nBut as relatives and friends gathered around Chaudhry carrying placards reading: \"Welcome home Mr Prime Minister. You are our PM,\" he made it clear he had no intention of quitting his homelamd.\n\n\"I need a bit of a rest now...I'm an optimist. I think Fiji is a great country,\" he said.\n\n\"My priority is that the nation must get back on his feet. There are a lot of people suffering. They are our priority.\"\n\nAsked if he still considered himself prime minister, he replied: \"I don't know. It's up to what the people think.\"\n\nThe deal made to secure the release of the hostages includes fulfilling a number of demands made by Speight's rebels, including a new government and a new Constitution curtailing the political rights of ethnic Indians.\n\nMartial law spokesman Colonel Filipo Tarakinikini said: \"Once executive authority is handed over to the new President the military will revert to its normal role.\"\n\nBut he added that the army would help police in \"mopping up\" operations.\n\nAt Parliament around 200 Speight supporters sang and cheered after the release of the hostages, apparently celebrating what they saw as a victory.\n\nFull details of the final deal for the freedom of the hostages were not immediately available, but it was apparent that the coup plotters had not given up their arms -- one of the demands made by the military.\n\nThe military declared martial law on May 29.\n\nThe release of the hostages came even as indigenous people seized a top tourist resort, Fiji Forbes on Laucala Island.\n\nMartial law spokesman Major Howard Politini confirmed that people claiming to be landowners had seized Laucala, but said no other details were available.\n\nLaucala is owned by American Steven Forbes whose father, publishing millionaire Malcolm Forbes, bought it in 1972.\n\nThe island could not be contacted from Suva.\n\nEarly this week people seized the exclusive Turtle Island Resort, holding 45 guests for 24 hours before releasing them unharmed after claiming indigenous rights to the land.\n\nAFP\n\nEARLIER REPORT\n\nAll hostages released in Fiji"
