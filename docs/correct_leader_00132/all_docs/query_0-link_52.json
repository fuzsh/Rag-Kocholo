        "text": "EIGHT weeks after being kidnapped by armed rebels, Fiji's deposed prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, emerged yesterday with a message of forgiveness for his captors and a defiant pledge to restore stability to the South Pacific nation.\n\nGaunt, unshaven, but clearly relieved, Mr Chaudhry said he bore no animosity towards the coup plotters, despite being stripped of power and suffering a severe beating at their hands. But he refused to accept the overthrow of his democratically elected government, proudly declaring his political status a \"matter for the people\". He said he envisaged playing a pivotal role in the future of Fiji.\n\nHe said: \"It is a time for deep reflection and reconciliation, and reconstruction of the country. My priority is that the nation must get back on its feet. There are a lot of people out there who are suffering as a result of what has gone on. I think I have a vision for Fiji. Unfortunately we were not allowed to fulfil that - we were deposed after 12 months. But I will continue to work for the people.\"\n\nMr Chaudhry and 17 members of his toppled government were released after an extraordinary reconciliation ritual with the rebel group who stormed parliament on May 19 and claimed power in the name of indigenous Fijians.\n\nHostages and gunmen shared a bowl of kava, a traditional narcotic drink. Mr Chaudhry and the coup leader, George Speight, then shook hands and embraced. The 18 politicians, many in tears, were then allowed to leave the parliament complex in Suva which was their prison for 56 days.\n\nMr Chaudhry said there had been some \"anxious moments\" for himself and his son Rajendra. He admitted he had once been beaten. Asked his feelings towards Mr Speight, he said: \"I have no animosity towards him. I have no ill feeling towards anybody. I think I am a very forgiving person.\"\n\nWhile the hostage crisis is over, it is widely considered that Fiji's political woes are just beginning. The economy and tourist industry have been shattered, and many international governments are considering sanctions if democracy is not restored.\n\nMr Speight and his gang have secured major concessions. The new president, Ratu Joesefa Iloilo, is a supporter of their demands. It seems certain that the ethnic Indians, who make up 44 per cent of the population, will be denied political power under a new constitution enshrining supremacy for indigenous Fijians.\n\nMeanwhile, four tourist resorts - Buca Bay, Rukuruku, and Laucala and Turtle islands - have been seized by Fijians with land rights grievances, apparently exploiting the uncertain political climate."
