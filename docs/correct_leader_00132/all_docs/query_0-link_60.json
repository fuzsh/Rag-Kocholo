        "text": "A court has dismissed the opposition Fiji Labour Party leader's appeal against a fraud sentence and conviction, making him ineligible to contest next month's election.\n\nIn April Mahendra Chaudhry was found guilty of currency offences and breaching the Exchange Control Act.\n\nA High Court judge sentenced Chaudhry to pay a fine of $FJD2 million (nearly $AUD1.2 million), or spend 15 months in prison, with a 12-month parole period.\n\nFiji's Court of Appeal on Thursday dismissed Chaudhry's appeal against the conviction and sentence.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe court found that the original fine of $2 million was excessive, and reduced it to $1 million.\n\nChaudhry's lawyer, Anand Singh, says the ruling means the former Fijian prime minister will not be able to contest the general election in September.\n\n\"The Constitution says that if there's a conviction which carries more than a year sentence, the person is disqualified to contest the election,\" Mr Singh told Pacific Beat.\n\nMr Singh says they will appeal to the Supreme court, but the result won't be handed down by August 18 when the nominations of candidates close.\n\n\"[The appeal] is only of academic value so far as the chances of contesting the election is concerned,\" he said.\n\n\"Mr Chaudhry is a fighter, he took this on his chin. I think at this stage he is contemplating the various options open to him.\n\n\"He is unhappy with the judgement, but that's the way if goes I suppose.\"\n\nChaudhry was Fiji's first and only Indo-Fijian prime minister. He was removed from office in a military coup in 2000 after being held captive in Parliament House for nearly 60 days."
