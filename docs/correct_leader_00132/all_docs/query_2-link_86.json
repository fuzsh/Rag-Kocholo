        "text": "The Fiji Labour Party is today mourning the loss of Professor Tupeni Baba.\n\nProfessor Baba served as the founding member of the Fiji Labour Party and its Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Labour-led government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\nChaudhry says Professor Baba was taken hostage in both the coups of 1987 and 2000, on 14 May 1987, he was taken captive by Lt. Col Rabuka and kept under house arrest for 6 days along with Dr Bavadra and other members of his Cabinet.\n\nProfessor Baba in the 2000 coup, was kept hostage at gunpoint for 56 days along with the former Prime Minister Chaudhry and other ministers and members.\n\nChaudhry says Professor Baba in both coups, showed exemplary courage and fortitude refusing to give in to intimidation by armed soldiers.\n\nChaudhry says in the 2000 hostage crisis, even though they were separated along racial lines and kept in separate locations, Professor Baba managed to stay in touch with him on developments.\n\nChaudhry says as his Deputy PM, Professor Baba managed to keep in touch with him through notes, providing his own opinion and advice on critical issues.\n\nHe says Professor Baba had contributed significantly to Labour’s formative years and will be remembered for the legacy he left behind.\n\nProfessor Baba broke away from the Fiji Labour Party and formed the New United Labour Party to contest the 2001 general election.\n\nChaudhry also extends his heartfelt condolences to the late Professor Baba’s wife, Doctor Unaisi Nabobo-Baba and other grieving families."
