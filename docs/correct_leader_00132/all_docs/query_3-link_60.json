        "text": "WEEKEND READING. Allen Lockington’s column, Michael Field on easing sanctions, Bainimarama on losing opportunity.\n\n“PROUD FIJIAN” has just left this comment on the post about the the $½million theft. “Just saw a picture of the $20 note with the serial number starting with EB. The note was apparently presented by an Australian tourist who had received the note from Currency Exchange in Sydney.” If the serial number is between 450,000 and 500,000, that’s one of them. Only another 25,999 to go.\n\nWORKERS WAGES TO BE CUT BY 15%? The Fiji Trade Union Congress is calling on the Fiji Sugar Corporation to enter into negotiations over a proposed pay cut for workers in the industry. The Corporation has announced a 15% pay cut across the board but the TUC says no discussions have taken place despite existing agreements with unions to enter into talks prior to any salary reduction.General Secretary Felix Anthony says the Corporation’s plans are unfair as employees should not be held responsible for its cashflow problems brought on by recent mill upgrades. He has requested an urgent meeting with the FSC.\n\nOpinion by Croz Walsh\n\nMahendra Chaudhry’s place in Fiji history is assured by the many roles he has played but how he is remembered will depend on which side you are on. It’s hard to remain neutral about Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\nTrade Union leader working on behalf of sugarcane farmers, leader of the Fiji Labour Party, Prime Minister of Fiji, brave hostage of George Speight, the real leader of the parliamentary opposition, short-term Minister of Finance in Bainimarama Governnment, protector of the poor, defender of his undisclosed Australian bank account, prominent Bainimarama opponent (phew!) … the “Man” has now upped the ante by his almost daily anti-government releases on the FLP website and in the mainstream media. So much so that other media outlets have questioned whether Sharon Smith John’s Information (and censorship) office is doing its job. One wonders why the cunning old fox has chosen now to intensify the attack. No one should ever under-estimate Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\nHe has been a constant critic of Government’s efforts to de-politicise and improve the long-suffering sugar industry, although he’s understandably shy about his own role in politicising the industry and contributing to its decline. In a Fiji Times article published yesterday he blames sugar’s problems on the “ineptitude and inefficiency of the Fiji Sugar Corporation management … We lost $100million last year because of the FSC’s incompetence and this year we will most probably see the worst-ever result in the history of the sugar industry in the country.” Here are extracts from the statement he made to the Fiji Times. Hear him out …\n\n“Farmers in the sugar industry are incurring unnecessary expenditure and losses because of the continued incompetence of the FSC management.\n\n“While farmers are going through unprecedented difficult times and hardships, the FSC and the Government have resorted to having a series of meetings. Meetings will not resolve issues facing the industry. Close to 200,000 people’s livelihoods depend on the sugar industry and something concrete needs to be done because the sugar industry is going down the tube.”\n\nI cannot speak on the inefficiency or otherwise of the FSC management, and there’s no doubt there are major problems in the sugar industry, but it didn’t require much thought to work out how Mahendra’s criticism would be received. The anti-government blog Fiji Today was quick off the mark with the headline “Mahendra Chaudhry Continues the Fight in the Fiji Times” — and they were not limiting his “fight” to the sugar industry.\n\nIf Mahendra is as concerned about the sugar industry as his own political future, Fijians would like to hear more concrete statements from him than “something concrete needs to be done.” They’d want to hear what, and how he’s going to help — other than calling meetings and talking to the press. Some 200,000 people’s livelihoods could also depend on his answer.\n\nThe sad thing for Fiji is that too many of its more able people, people like Mahendra possessed of intelligence, ability, experience and support from large sections of the public, for reasons of principle, self-interest or a mix of both, continue to oppose Government in ways that cause it not to re-open the dialogue that is needed to implement the reforms political needed for a fair Fiji.\n\nSuch opposition plays into the hands of those in the Military Council who may not be as enthusiastic as the PM to return Fiji to parliamentary rule in 2014. And with every lurch to totalitarianism, Government’s internal Opposition takes fresh heart, and the international community, that Fiji so desperately needs to help its economic recovery, trusts Government’s stated intentions even less.\n\nIf Mahendra and others like him want to help Fiji’s recovery, they need to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. It will take a while to restore trust between the Mahendra’s and the PM (and, indeed, it may never happen) but positive, less accusatory, criticism would help, and require a measured response. He still has a choice to spin, or to break, the existing vicious circle of mistrust. How he chooses could define his ultimate place in history.\n\nMOI CLARIFIES CHAUDHRY SITUATION. In reply to media enquiries as to whether the Fiji Labour Party’s (FL) website, which has been issuing daily press releases, will be subjected to censorship, Permanent Secretary for Information, Sharon Smith Johns said: “All media outlets must comply with the provisions of the Media Industry Decree 2010 as well as the Public Emergency Regulation (PER) provisions relating to the media as captured under Section of 16.” Ms Smith-Johns added that Government has been working on forging a better partnership with media organizations to move the country forward and has been able to achieve considerable success in this regard. She said, “Most media organizations have responded favorably to the call for responsible and accurate reporting as they acknowledge that the media can play a constructive role in nation building.”– Based on 2010 No:1416/MOI. See the MOI letter sent to the FLP. Click to enlarge.\n\nMORE DETAIL FROM MOI. This from the Permanent Secretary of Information: “Currently we are still under the PER (see section 16) below.\n\nSection 16 -(1) – Where the Permanent Secretary for Information has reason to believe that any broadcast or publication may give rise to disorder and may thereby cause undue demands to be made upon the police or the Armed Forces, or may result in a breach of the peace, or promote disaffection or public alarm, or undermine the Government and the State of Fiji, he or she, by order, prohibit such broadcast or publication.\n\n(2) In order to give effect to subsection (1) above any broadcaster or publisher upon direction by the Permanent Secretary for Information must submit to him or her all material for broadcast or publication material before broadcast or publication.\n\nThe Media Decree is also in force which explains to publishers or broadcasters the requirements needed. For instance Part 4 –Content Regulation of the Media Decree states\n\n23. The content of any print media which is in excess of 50 words must include a byline and wherever practical the content of any other media service must include a byline.\n\nThe Ministry of Information is working with publishers and broadcasters in assisting them meet the requirement in this transitional period, it is better to advise and work with the media at a time like this, which is what has been done with the FLP web site. The Ministry met with the FLP today and came to an amicable agreement with regards to the content on the web site.”"
