National development plans must ensure that the interests of the masses become paramount. If our ordinary people lose faith through unfair and inequitable policies, then the future is fraught with uncertainties. We must restore the faith of our people in democracy, in the government of the day, and above all in Fiji.",

        "text": "A Brief History\n\nThe Fiji Labour Party was formed to defend the rights of workers, farmers and the poor. It was formally inaugurated on 6 July 1985 in Suva with the Fiji Trades Union Congress as the main inspiration and driving force behind its formation.\n\nIt was the unions’ response to a series of anti-worker policies of the post 1982 Alliance Government culminating in the unilateral imposition of a wage freeze effective January 1985 without consultation with the Tripartite Forum.\n\nThe new Party received enthusiastic support at the grassroots level and successfully contested the 1987 general elections in a coalition with the National Federation Party.\n\nIt formed a government with Labour leader Dr Timoci Bavadra as Prime Minister but this was short-lived as Dr Bavadra’s government was deposed in a racist coup led by Sitiveni Rabuka, third ranking colonel in the Fiji Military Forces a month after taking office.\n\nLabour was returned to government in the 1999 general elections held under the new Constitution. It formed a multi-party government in coalition with the Fijian Association Party, the Party of National Unity (PANU) and the Christian Democratic Party with Labour’s Mahendra Chaudhry as Prime Minister.\n\nThe Labour-led government was popular as it initiated a number of socio-economic reforms to bring down the cost of living and alleviate poverty. But once again, exactly one year into office, 19 May 2000 the government was removed in a coup backed by the army and led by a civilian George Speight."
