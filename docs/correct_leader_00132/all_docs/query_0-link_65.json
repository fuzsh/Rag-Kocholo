        "text": "SUVA, Fiji -- Fiji's former deputy prime minister Tupeni Baba is expected to announce the formation soon of a breakaway New Labour Party, signalling a split with his leader Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\nThe move will make it harder for Chaudhry's Fiji Labour Party to win office in elections to be held on August 27.\n\nChaudhry, an Indo-Fijian, was deposed as prime minister after an attempted coup on May 19 last year led to the military assuming power on May 27.\n\nChaudhry and most members of his cabinet were held hostage by rebel leader George Speight for 56 days.\n\nThe military, which negotiated Chaudhry's release, installed an interim civilian government led by Laisenia Qarase in July.\n\nQarase heads caretaker administration\n\nAlthough that government was ruled illegal by Fiji's Court of Appeal in March, Qarase was reappointed as head of a caretaker government to take the troubled South Pacific nation to the polls.\n\nBaba has been unhappy with Chaudhry's leadership of the Fiji Labour Party for some time. He quit the party last week and said he would form a new multiracial party.\n\nBaba is likely to join forces with other political identities such as Adi Kuini Speed, former prime minister (and leader of two coups in 1987) Sitiveni Rabuka and union leader Mick Beddoes.\n\nFiji's economy is in deep trouble, with a shocking 12.5 percent contraction last year and little growth expected this year.\n\nRebel leader George Speight, who is in jail awaiting trial on treason charges, attempted to use envy against Fiji's Indo-Fijian minority to justify his attempted coup.\n\nHis aim was to enshrine the political supremacy of indigenous Fijians over Indo-Fijians, who make up 44 percent of Fiji's population of 830,000 people\n\nRELATED SITES:\n\nFiji Live\n\nFiji Village\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive."
