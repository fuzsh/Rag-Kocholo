        "text": "The president of Fiji says he has dismissed the country's democratically elected government.\n\nShortly after President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara made the announcement, George Speight, leader of an 10-day coup attempt some have called a hostage taking, declared himself leader.\n\nIt's not known whether some 30 hostages, including Fiji's now former prime minister have been released.\n\nNews of the dismissial came after a tense day Friday. Gunmen behind the coup had a run-in with government soldiers near the parliament buildings.\n\nCoup leader George Speight and 20 armed men walked away from the parliament complex to shake hands with soldiers and supporters at the main driveway. The meetings had become routine.\n\nBut on Friday, Speight knocked down a military barricade to allow more supporters onto the grounds of parliament. Then one of his gunmen got into a fight with a soldier.\n\nThe gunman, masked by a balaclava, pointed his semi-automatic rifle at the soldier's chest and yelled in Fijian.\n\nSome soldiers were crouched ready to fire, but a lieutenant ordered them to stand down. No shots were fired and the coup rebels returned to the building.\n\nPolitical crisis into tenth day\n\nSpeight and his men stormed parliament and seized power Friday May 19. Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian leader, and President Mara's daughter were among those held since the coup.\n\nARCHIVE: Rebels hold gun to Fiji's prime minister\n\n<>>\n\nFiji's influential council of traditional chiefs tried to end the crisis. The chiefs were among those pressuring the president to remove Chaudhry as prime minister and to pardon the coup rebels.\n\nNeighbouring Australia condemned that proposal and was preparing to suspend its non-humanitarian aid to Fiji and seek its suspension from the Commonwealth when the change of government was announced."
