        "text": "Fiji Labour Party (FLP) is hoping to make a comeback in this year’s General Election with 44 candidates.This was after they did not meet the threshold in the past two general elections.\n\nFLP leader Mahendra Chaudhry submitted 44 candidate nominations at the Fijian Elections Office yesterday.\n\n“The campaign from here on will be very active. We have four weeks ahead of us and our team is working throughout the country so we remain hopeful,” Mr Chaudhry said.\n\n“We have 44 candidates nominated today. We are not particularly keen on having the 55 and we are comfortable with the 44 at the moment.\n\n“Our 44 provisional candidates are a good mix both with experience and from different segments of the society and I have confidence in them.”\n\nMr Chaudhry highlighted that the party will launch its manifesto and Labour government budget next Thursday.\n\n“We have a good manifesto which addresses the problems of the country, especially the economy, rural sector, welfare, education and medical. It is a comprehensive manifesto,” he said.\n\n“I like to urge all the voters to please cast their votes. It is important that they all vote.\n\n“Personally, I think the change is overdue and I think the nation needs change, the change of direction.\n\n“We want to get democracy back to Fiji and that is very important.”"
