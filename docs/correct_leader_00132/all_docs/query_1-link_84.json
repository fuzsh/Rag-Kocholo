        "text": "SUVA, Fiji (Reuters) -- Fiji remained in political limbo Tuesday as talks between military leaders and nationalist rebels stalled over the make-up of a new administration.\n\nRebel leader George Speight said he is growing increasingly frustrated by the apparent refusal of the military and caretaker Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase to accept his candidates for a new government to lead Fiji for the next two years.\n\nSpeight, a former insurance salesman, hinted more civil unrest was likely in the racially split South Pacific nation if he did not get his way.\n\n\"The ball game is not over yet, it is just starting,\" Speight told Reuters.\n\n\"Don't underestimate the needs and the power of the people.\"\n\nCNN SPECIAL\n\nRESOURCES\n\nMESSAGE BOARD\n\nCoup in Fiji\n\nSpeight plunged Fiji into a political crisis when he stormed parliament with armed rebels on May 19 in the name of indigenous Fijian rights. The group held Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, and most of his multi-racial cabinet hostage for 56 days before releasing them on July 13.\n\nThe hostage drama at Fiji's parliament complex sparked waves of support among Fijian nationalists for Speight, who wants to limit the political and economic power of Fiji's ethnic Indians.\n\nIndians comprise 44 percent of Fiji's approximately 800,000 population and dominate the key tourism and sugar industries, which have been battered by the political crisis.\n\nSpeight said he had held informal discussions with ailing new President Ratu Josefa Iloilo on Tuesday to press his demand that clan leader Adi Samanunu Cakobau be appointed prime minister.\n\nThose talks were inconclusive and a wider meeting involving Speight's group, military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama and representatives of the military-backed Qarase was postponed.\n\nFormal discussions between the three sides in the dispute would now be held on Wednesday, although a time and venue had not been agreed on, military sources in Suva said.\n\nThe military sources said Wednesday's meeting would be mediated by Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, a representative of Fiji's influential Great Council of Chiefs and high chief of the Naitasiri clan on the main island of Viti Levu.\n\nSources from Iloilo's office said a delegation from the president would meet Qarase at the Reserve Bank of Fiji in central Suva later on Tuesday to discuss developments.\n\nSpeight's group won many of their demands for indigenous Fijian political domination, including the scrapping of the 1997 multi-racial constitution, before freeing their hostages.\n\nA new indigenous government under Qarase was named but Speight has rejected it because it includes none of his supporters in key cabinet positions.\n\nHe now wants Cakobau, a diplomat from a clan regarded in Fiji as close to royalty, to replace Qarase and has threatened renewed unrest of he does not get his way.\n\nAustralia, which along with New Zealand, Britain and the United States has already imposed aid, diplomatic and sporting sanctions, on Sunday threatened new sanctions if Speight or his group won places in the new government.\n\nIndependent Web site www.fijilive.com said on Tuesday that the road leading to the main hydro-electric plant at Monasavu in central Viti Levu had been blocked by rebel supporters. The plant has been held by landowners sympathetic to Speight for two weeks.\n\nCopyright 2000 Reuters. All rights reserved.
