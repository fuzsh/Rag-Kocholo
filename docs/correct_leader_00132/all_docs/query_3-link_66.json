        "text": "Fiji's elections office is checking the eligibility of potential candidates wanting to stand in next month's election, the country's first since the 2006 coup.\n\nNominations have closed for Fiji's elections on September 17, and the elections office is now working on determining who is or is not qualified to stand.\n\nIndependent candidate Roshika Deo was the first person to be officially confirmed as a candidate.\n\n\"We were not aware that we were going to be the first official confirmed candidates,\" she said.\n\n\"We worked the hardest for the requirements, we obtained everything and went and did the submission and were confirmed on the same day.\"\n\n\"It feels like all our hard work has paid off, and there has been a team...which has been working really hard to make this possible.\"\n\nSupervisor of Elections Mohammed Saneem has told Pacific Beat there are several electoral or constitutional requirements which can keep a candidate off the ballot.\n\n\"If a person is bankrupt, or if a person is disqualified by the court, or if a person is not a resident of Fiji - does not have Fijian citizenship,\" he said.\n\n\"We are going to verify the nominations to seek compliance with the electoral decree and the constitution, following which we will convey to the parties the candidates which have been successful and also the candidates which have not been successful.\n\n\"It's a candidate nomination - not a party nomination - so if a candidate in a party is not successful, other candidates may still go through.\"\n\nOne of those who expects to be rejected is Fiji's opposition Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry, who is ineligible to stand because of a recent conviction.\n\nHe says he's appealing that conviction, even though it won't be heard until after the poll, and could also launch a constitutional challenge.\n\n\"I need to file my nomination and it needs to be rejected, because if I don't do that the court might tell me that 'I didn't file and nothing was rejected, so you can't come to us',\" he said.\n\n\"I intend to pursue this particular matter right to the end.\"\n\nBallot paper confusion\n\nUnder the new constitution, all of Fiji is treated as one electorate, meaning all the candidates for the 50 seats in parliament appear on the one paper.\n\nThe ballot paper consists of 280 squares representing the candidates with three-digit numbers - to be randomly drawn in a nationally televised ceremony.\n\nEach voter will have to locate the candidate they want and circle, tick or cross, and they are not allowed to bring papers in to the polling booth.\n\nMohammed Saneem says the names, numbers and photos of candidates will be available inside the polling station for those who forget the number of their candidate.\n\n\"We find that parties have been more confused by what parties are telling them than they are after they actually see the paper and the processes that have been put in place,\" he said.\n\n\"From the response we've receive so far, a lot of people understand properly how they have to do it.\n\n\"That is something that we are still working on, and we've got 29 more days to do more work on awareness, and we are heavily invested in this.\"\n\nMs Deo says in her talks with the community, concerns over the ballot papers are consistently raised as an issue.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of confusion...we've heard that there's been some mock-voting in some places, and there's been a high number of invalid votes, even among some of the literate.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of people asking for help, so a lot of the elections officials will [need] to assist each person that comes to vote.\"\n\n\"So I don't know how they're going to manage that situation...and the time that it will take them...given that we have one day.\"\n\nMr Chaudry says he's also concerned about the one-day polling, given Fiji has more than 100 inhabited islands and is spread across an area of 194,000 square kilometres.\n\n\"We just don't have the capacity for it as yet,\" he said.\n\n\"It is quite likely that there will be a large number of voters who will not be able to vote during this one day period.\"\n\nMohammed Saneem says thanks to the help of international donors, he believes Fiji will be ready come voting day.\n\n\"Australia is much bigger, and it can do it in one day,\" he said.\n\n\"Indonesia has 18,000 islands and they do it in a day - I think Fiji can manage.\n\n\"We anticipate that we have the resources to pull it off.\""
