Back in October last year after he had an informal meeting with some sugar cane farmers at Vunikavikaloa. Chaudhry was charged under the Public Emergency Regulations (PER) with having breached the law by holding an unauthorised public meeting. Yes, folks, it was always a rather juvenile exercise by the regime, and now the charges have been dropped by the DPP for lack of evidence. Not surprisingly, the FLP website was quick to trumpet Chaudhry’s victory.\n\nFijivillage 2 February 2011: Charges withdrawn against Chaudhry\n\nFiji Labour Party website 2 February: DPP withdraws unlawful assembly charge"
