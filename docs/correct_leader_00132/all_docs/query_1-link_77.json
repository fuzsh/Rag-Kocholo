        "text": "It is true that he enjoys a strong following, mainly among poorer Fijians in and around the capital Suva, who feel excluded from the prosperity which has come from tourism and Fiji's natural resources.\n\nMr Speight is a skilful speaker, who has exploited his notoriety very effectively to rally support behind his campaign for a racially-separated political system.\n\nAt gunpoint\n\nBut if he were as popular as he claims, why not simply contest an election, rather than take over the parliament at gunpoint?\n\nIn any case, he is disliked by the ethnic Indians, who make up around 45% of the population and who dominate the economy.\n\nHe is also opposed by many indigenous people, especially in the west, where the tourist industry has been badly hit by the crisis.\n\nSo why has he been so successful?\n\nHe has been helped by the ambivalent response of Fiji's traditional elite.\n\nInitially there was strong condemnation from the veteran President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, one of modern Fiji's founding fathers.\n\nThe Indian community was also outraged by the incarceration of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry - the country's first ethnic Indian premier - and the overthrow of his government.\n\nMartial law\n\nBut both the traditional chiefs, who still wield a lot of influence over political life, and the armed forces, which have declared martial law, have tried to meet Mr Speight's political demands - even though this means throwing out the constitution and leaving Fiji without a workable political system.\n\nThe army in particular could have isolated the rebels in the first days of the crisis and been much tougher in its negotiations.\n\nInstead, it allowed George Speight's followers and the media to join him in the parliament, turning his coup into something resembling a popular uprising.\n\nAs a result, the country now faces a severely damaged economy and international isolation.\n\nIt seems a heavy price to pay, even taking into account the fact that Mr Speight is holding most of the government hostage.\n\nUndoubtedly, the military has been keen to avoid bloodshed.\n\n\"Rather talk\"\n\nFijians say armed confrontation is simply not their custom - they would rather talk it through, however long it takes.\n\nGeorge Speight's protest message also strikes a chord with the rank and file of the security forces, who are 99% indigenous Fijians.\n\nThat would make it difficult for their commanders to order an attack on the rebels.\n\nThis is a very close-knit society, and some of the rebels are related to the troops facing them.\n\nSome members of the armed forces have joined George Speight.\n\nShallow roots\n\nJust as important is the fact that democracy has shallow roots in Fiji.\n\nSince independence in 1970 the constitution has been changed twice.\n\nThe last constitution, introduced in 1997, allowed open competition for seats for the first time - previously there were separate indigenous and Indian seats.\n\nIt was widely assumed that an ethnic Fijian would become prime minister after last year's election.\n\nBut skilful exploitation of the divisions in the indigenous parties allowed Mahendra Chaudhry's Labour Party to form the winning coalition.\n\nIt was a result many Fijians found hard to accept.\n\nFijian democracy is also blended with tribal customs, giving the traditional chiefs a powerful voice in the appointment of the president and senate.\n\nMany Fijians expected the Great Council of Chiefs to sort out the crisis for them - they have been disappointed.\n\nTwo communities\n\nThe chiefs are divided by a host of personal and regional rivalries, and they are unused to making the tough choices presented to them by the coup.\n\nAt the very heart of the matter is the problem of designing a constitution which addresses the very different demands of the two communities.\n\nIndians want to compete freely for political power, using their organisational strength within the trade union movement and business networks.\n\nIndigenous Fijians feel that as the original inhabitants of the islands they have a special relationship with the land which could be endangered by an Indian-dominated government.\n\nMany are critical of the violent tactics used by George Speight, but they like what he is fighting for - a Fiji in which only indigenous people can control political power.\n\nThey say the old constitution was unsuitable.\n\nThe challenge now facing the military is to form an interim government strong enough to design a new constitution and organise new elections."
