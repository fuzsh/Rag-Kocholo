        "text": "Fiji Labour Party Leader and former Prime Minister, Mahendra Chaudhry is questioning why the Chair of the Electoral Commission, Barbara Malimali is asking the Prime Minister and the Chair of the Constitutional Offices Commission, Sitiveni Rabuka to remove Acting Supervisor of Elections, Ana Mataiciwa.\n\nChaudhry says they believe from what has transpired that there are elements within government seeking to remove Mataiciwa.\n\nHe questions if it is because Mataiciwa has referred complaints lodged against some senior Cabinet Ministers to FICAC.\n\nChaudhry says if so, this is outright interference with the due process particularly as the appointment had already been made according to the Prime Minister who is the Chair of the Constitutional Offices Commission.\n\nChaudhry says the Fiji Labour Party has received communication that moves are afoot to replace Ana Mataiciwa as Supervisor of Elections.\n\nHe says this information was also circulated to Prime Minister Rabuka and other senior members of the government, including the media.\n\nfijivillage news has received confirmation that a letter from the chair of the Electoral Commission Barbara Malimali was hand delivered to the Constitutional Offices Commission last Tuesday requesting that Mataiciwa be replaced by a former Chair of the Electoral Commission as the substantive Supervisor of Elections.\n\nChaudhry says this is despite a media statement from Prime Minister Rabuka on 27th January this year that the Constitutional Offices Commission had already decided on the substantive appointee and he could not see why the announcement was being delayed.\n\nHe says in response to the Prime Ministerâ€™s concern, the Attorney General had then explained that they were in the process of working out the terms and conditions of the post before making a formal announcement.\n\nMataiciwa is still awaiting that letter of confirmation some two months later.\n\nChaudhry confirms that he has written to the Chair of the Electoral Commission seeking confirmation whether or not a letter had been sent to the Constitutional Offices Commission secretariat seeking to remove Mataiciwa.\n\nHe also says at the quarterly meeting with the Acting Supervisor of Elections last week, all opposition political parties present had expressed confidence in Mataiciwa and had requested confirmation of her appointment without any further delay.\n\nChaudhry says they believe the Constitutional Offices Commission had decided to appoint Mataiciwa who has been acting in that position since January 2023.\n\nWe have sought comments from Rabuka on when the Constitutional Offices Commission will address the matter.\n\nfijivillage News has also sought comments from Malimali and Mataiciwa."
