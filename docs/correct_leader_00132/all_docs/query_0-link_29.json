        "text": "By CNN's Grant Holloway\n\nSUVA, Fiji (CNN) -- Jailed coup leader George Speight and ousted prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry have both won seats in Fiji's parliament as latest poll results confirm the Pacific nation's voters have split sharply along ethnic lines.\n\nSpeight won the Fijian communal seat of Tailevu North, polling 51.38 percent of the votes cast, despite his incarceration and trial on charges of treason.\n\nStanding for the Matanitu Vanua/Conservative Alliance Party using the native name Ilikini Naitini, Speight may be forced to give up the seat if he cannot physically attend parliament or if he is found guilty of treason -- a crime which can carry the death penalty in Fiji.\n\nThe make-up of the next Fijian government meanwhile may not be determined until Friday as recounts get underway in many of the seats.\n\nSo far 43 of the 71 seats have been counted with the Fiji Labour Party, led by deposed prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry, holding 22 of those.\n\nThe Soqosoqo Duavata Ni Lewenivanua (SDL) party, led by caretaker Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, has won 14 seats, the Conservative Alliance 6, and others 3.\n\nThe early lead for Labour is deceptive however.\n\nSo far the voting is splitting sharply down ethnic lines with Fiji's Indian population supporting Chaudhry and indigenous Fijians backing Qarese or the Conservative Alliance.\n\nFiji's electoral system is complex, with some seats reserved only for Indian Fijians others only for indigenous Fijians.\n\nStill other seats are open to all-comers.\n\nOf Fiji's population of 830,000, about 44 percent are of Indian ethnic origin.\n\nMany of the Indian-based seats have been decided but many other seats, particularly in and around the capital of Suva, have yet to be determined and could go either way or to moderate parties.\n\nDr Jonathan Fraenkel, economic history lecturer at Fiji's University of South Pacific, said a quite a few of the most confusing seats would go to a number of recounts and a final result may not be known until late Thursday or Friday.\n\nCoalition government possible\n\nAsked to predict a likely outcome, Dr Fraenkel suggested interim Prime Minister Qarese may well lead a coalition government.\n\nHe said the key outcome of the poll so far was the election of two strong, ethnically polarized blocks and the poor performance of moderate candidates.\n\n\"The moderates have been completely wiped out so far,\" he said.\n\nAnother feature was the extremely high level of invalid votes -- running at up to 12 percent of the total vote -- which was caused by Fiji's complex voting system, he said.\n\nPreliminary inquiry\n\nMeanwhile, Speight and nine others facing treason charges related to the attempted coup were brought from their island prison to the capital Wednesday for another court appearance.\n\nThey were remanded for a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the charges they face should also go to the High Court.\n\nSpeight and the others took ethnic Indian Chaudhry and his government hostage for 56 days.\n\nThe military later imposed martial law and put Qarase in office.\n\nLast week's elections were called to return the country to democracy."
