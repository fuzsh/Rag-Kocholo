        "text": "Fijian soldiers patrolling the capital, Suva, were today ordered to shoot to kill after the army imposed a 48-hour curfew on the city.\n\nThe army's action came after supporters of the coup leader, George Speight, shot dead a policeman and destroyed a television station. The prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, and more than 30 members of his government have been held hostage by masked gunmen in the parliamentary compound since May 19.\n\nThe 48-hour curfew began at 6pm local time (0600 GMT). Suva's streets were quiet after police advised people to stay at home and recommended schools close. The army supports the elected government and has ordered all its reservists to report for duty.\n\nMr Speight and his gunmen tried to distance themselves from the killing of the policeman yesterday but is threatening to kill the daughter of the president, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. The president has little power, but took over the government after the coup and declared a state of emergency.\n\nFor days, the mood of the coup supporters inside the compound had been celebratory but that changed yesterday when an armed mob went on the rampage in Suva.\n\nMr Speight, a member of the indigenous Fijian majority, wants ethnic Indian Mr Chaudhry removed from power and Indians barred from leading the country again. The former insurance salesman was fired by the prime minister last year as the chairman of two local companies involved in managing Fiji's lucrative timber trade. He had been appointed to both posts by the previous government, in which his father was a senior member.\n\nThe coup leader told a Sydney radio station today that he had discovered papers in Mr Chaudhry's office that outlined a plot to enhance ethnic Indian influence in the country.\n\n\"They had a project - a very comprehensive social, political plan - aimed at all levels of society, but specifically undermining Fijian political and traditional structures with a view to entrenching Indian influence in Fiji,\" he said.\n\nMr Speight yesterday rejected an offer from Fiji's tribal leaders for a peaceful solution to the crisis, saying he would not drop his demand that the constitution be rewritten to keep Indians out of power and that the president should be removed.\n\nFijians of Indian ancestry make up 44% of the population of 813,000 but control much of the nation's commerce, while indigenous Fijians account for 51%. The country had two bloodless coups in 1987 and elected Mr Chaudry as prime minister last year. He is Fiji's first leader of Indian desecent.\n\nThe United Nations, Australia, New Zealand and the United States have criticised the Fijian army for failing to crack down on Mr Speight and his allies.\n\n\"We strongly condemn the repugnant, criminal actions of George Speight and his band of gunmen who continue to hold hostages in Fiji's parliamentary complex,\" the US embassy in Suva said in a statement. \"We reiterate our call ... that the hostages be released immediately and unconditionally.\"\n\nOlympic authorities in Sydney have announced that the torch relay, which had been due to go through Fiji on June 3 on its way to the Sydney games in September, would bypass the country."
