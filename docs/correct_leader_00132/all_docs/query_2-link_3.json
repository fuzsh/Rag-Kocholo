        "text": "Seven masked gunmen were early this morning holding the prime minister of Fiji , Mahendra Chaudhry, and up to 50 cabinet ministers and MPs hostage in parliament, after staging a coup the aggressors said was conducted on behalf of indigenous Fijians. To the delight of mobs who looted and burned Indian-owned shops in the capital, Suva, ethnic Fijian nationalist George Speight yesterday declared himself interim president, suspending the constitution and appointing an opposition MP and political novice, Ratu Timoci Silatolu, as interim prime minister.\n\nThis morning Mr Speight announced that he had sacked the president and would swear in a new government. In a radio interview he said his 'legal administration' would be in place by the end of the day and that the president Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara was no longer relevant.\n\nThe coup leader has been negotiating with the military through the 1987 coup leader and former prime minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, and said the police and army were remaining neutral while the civil administration was in limbo.\n\nThe markets and shops of Suva would be closed today as the country remains in a state of emergency.\n\nMr Speight was described yesterday as a computer salesman with a taste for the flamboyant gestures but with hitherto little public support.\n\nHowever, it was unclear whether the ethnic Fijian-dominated armed forces would back Mr Speight. Both the coup leader and the president claimed yesterday that they had the loyalty of the military.\n\nMr Speight said:'I am asserting control, I am asserting executive power over Fiji as I speak. All executive power currently resides in my hands.'\n\nHe also claimed that the armed forces were at his 'beck and call'. Sir Kamisese, whose daughter, Adi Koila Mara, was among the ministers being held hostage, declared a state of emergency yesterday. He gave himself the power to command the military, and appealed to the hostage-takers to release the MPs. He also urged the army and police to restore the rule of law.\n\n'I regret to say what is happening today is not in accordance with the constitution and is therefore unlawful,' Sir Kamisese said.\n\nThe bloodless coup was instantly condemned by Commonwealth leaders, who warned that the south Pacific nation could face suspension.\n\nThe Commonwealth's secretary general, Don McKinnon, said he was 'sad and angry' over the attack on Fiji 's elected government. 'I have been in touch with the president of Fiji to offer my full support for his efforts to restore constitutional rule,' he said.\n\nAustralia's prime minister, John Howard said: 'I'm horrified that such an act should be carried out against a democratically elected leader.'\n\nThe storming of parliament came as about 5,000 people demonstrated against Mr Chaudhry on the anniversary of his election. Police imposed a curfew as a pall of smoke hung over Suva's many burnt stores and 300 troops fanned out across the city. Two military battalions were also deployed around the country to help police curb the violence.\n\nBut there was no indication that soldiers were intervening to end the hostage drama.\n\nMr Chaudhry, Fiji 's first ethnic Indian prime minister, angered the Pacific island state by packing his administration with Indo-Fijians.\n\nLast night there were reports that Fiji 's Indian community, who make up 44% of the 800,000 population of the islands, were already trying to flee overseas as thousands had done after two coups in 1987 reinforced Fijian control of parliament.\n\nThe arrival of seven masked armed men in parliament ends weeks of speculation that Mr Chaudhry, whose rainbow coalition won power in a landslide exactly a year ago, would be deposed. A joint statement of Fijian political parties issued just before the coup said that civil unrest would continue until the government, and the 1997 multi racial constitution under which it had been elected, were removed."
