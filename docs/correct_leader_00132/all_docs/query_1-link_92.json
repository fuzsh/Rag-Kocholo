        "text": "What has happened in Fiji?\n\nDoes Mr Bainimarama intend to stay in power?\n\nHe said he would surrender presidential powers next week, and would ask the country's great council of chiefs to restore them to the former president, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, who he expects to then appoint a full interim government.\n\nWhat lies behind the coup?\n\nThe latest military uprising - the fourth coup in less than 20 years - is the culmination of a long standoff between Fiji's civilian and military leaders. The coup has been brewing for weeks if not months. The feud between the two men has its origins in Mr Qarase's attempt to introduce legislation that would have offered a pardon to people involved in the 2000 coup and allocate the ownership of coastal land to ethnic Fijians. Mr Bainimarama helped end the 2000 uprising and came close to getting killed himself.\n\nWhat has been the leadup to the coup?\n\nAs far back as July last year, Mr Bainimarama warned that he would topple the government if the legislation was passed. Mr Qarase won re-election in May. Perhaps emboldened by his victory, the prime minister decided to exert civilian authority once and for all. Last month, while Mr Banimarama was visiting Fijian peacekeepers in the Middle East, Mr Qarase ordered the dismissal of the military chief.\n\nDid Mr Bainimarama step down?\n\nAbsolutely not. Mr Bainimarama, with the backing of the military, refused point blank, and threatened, yet again, to oust the prime minister once he returned to Fiji. Mr Qarase's failed attempt to sack his military commander was a pivotal moment in a slow-burning crisis. Civilian authority was fatally undermined while Mr Bainimarama now had the upper hand.\n\nWere there attempts to solve the crisis?\n\nThere were talks between the two camps following Mr Bainimarama's return to try to find a way out of the impasse. A coup seemed only a matter of time and so it proved with today's events. In a televised speech, Mr Bainimarama accused Mr Qarase of failing to address the military's concerns in \"true spirit\" and said the prime minister had created tension in the army by trying to have him removed.\n\nWhat is the past history between the two men?\n\nIronically, it was Mr Bainimarama who helped to bring Mr Qarase to power after the 2000 coup. In that uprising, the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, and other colleagues were taken hostage for two months by a group led by the indigenous Fijian nationalist and failed businessman, George Speight.\n\nHow did that crisis end?\n\nMr Bainimarama and his fellow soldiers took power and brokered a settlement that saw the resignation of Mr Chaudhry. They eventually arrested Mr Speight when he violated the terms of the settlement. Mr Qarase, with Mr Bainimarama's backing, subsequently was named head of the interim civilian government and confirmed as prime minister in a later election. Mr Bainimarama says he now regrets \"appointing\" Mr Qarase as interim prime minister. In recent months, the commander has accused the government of continuing to adopt racist policies and programmes to appeal to indigenous Fijians, even though Mr Bainimarama is one himself.\n\nWhy so many coups?\n\nFiji has been plagued by coups since 1987, when the military first intervened in the island's political life. Past coups had much to do with the fear among indigenous Fijians of losing political control to Indo-Fijians, who dominate the economy. What is unusual about this current crisis is that the two protagonists are both high-profile indigenous Fijians.\n\nHow divided is the country?\n\nThere is a faultline between the country's two main communities - indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians. This legacy of Fiji's colonial past has dogged the country since independence in 1970. The Indo-Fijians are descendants of Indians brought to the island as indentured labour by Britain, the former colonial power, to develop a plantation economy. Indo-Fijians came to dominate the economy, arousing resentment from indigenous Fijians."
