        "text": "Fiji has one of the most developed economies in the Pacific, relying heavily on its tourism and sugar industries.\n\nSince independence from Britain in 1970, rivalry between the indigenous Fijian and the ethnic Indian communities has been at the root of much of the political upheaval in the country.\n\nThe archipelago consists of more than 330 islands and 540 islets scattered over about 3,000,000 sq km (about 1.1 million sq miles). Of the islands, about 100 are inhabited.\n\nJioji Konousi Konrote was elected as president in October 2015. He is the first non-indigenous president and the first to be elected by parliament. Previous presidents were selected by the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC).\n\nHe has had a long career in the military, government and diplomatic service.\n\nPrime Minister: Sitiveni Rabuka\n\nSitiveni became prime minister in December 2022 following general elections in which opposition parties reached a deal to form a new coalition government, ending Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama's nearly 16-year rule.\n\nFiji's coalition government has broader regional significance. Both parties have signalled a desire to cool relations with China, which has been steadily increasing its financial and diplomatic interests in the Pacific.\n\nMr Bainimarama came to power in a 2006 coup, one of a series of political upheavals since Fiji gained independence from the UK in 1970. The rivalry between the indigenous Fijian and the ethnic Indian communities has been at the root of much of the tensions.\n\nIn 2013 the constitution was changed to remove a race-based electoral system that favoured indigenous Fijians over the country's large Indian population.\n\nMr Rabuka is a former international rugby player who was the leader of Fiji's first coup in 1987, which came after tensions between indigenous Fijians and ethnic Indians. He served as prime minister in 1992-99."
