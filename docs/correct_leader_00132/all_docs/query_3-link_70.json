        "text": "Written By : MAIKA BOLATIKI.\n\nThe resignation of Fiji Labour Party leader and interim Minister for Finance Mahendra Chaudhry and colleagues interim Minister for Local Government Lekh Ram Vayeshnoi and interim Minister for Tourism Tom Rickets is surely a blow to the military backed interim government.\n\nIt is a blow because they have abandoned the interim Prime Minister Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama-captained ship that is still struggling to come out of the troubled waters it is sailing in.\n\nIs this the right time to resign?\n\nSurely Mr Chaudhry and his FLP colleagues in the interim Cabinet should have stayed and continued to help the nation.\n\nThe excuse that the FLP executive council had given the directive for them to resign and prepare for the next election is not good enough.\n\nSurely this is a sign of defeat on their part.\n\nWell for them, political life must go on.\n\nAccording to Mr Chaudhry the party has done the work that was required of it by the interim government.\n\nMr Chaudhry’s resignation or exit from the PM Bainimarama-led government was expected and has met with different reactions.\n\nOusted Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase said Mr Chaudhry’s decision to leave the interim government was a sign of failure.\n\n“Mr Chaudhry, as we all know, is a cunning politician and this move by him indicates that he is running away from the mess he had created,” said Mr Qarase.\n\n“The economy is still in a mess and he has failed drastically.”\n\nMr Qarase said it was too late for the FLP to step away from the military regime as it was very much involved from the beginning\n\n“They have been part of the many transgressions against our people, which resulted in two murders, wide nepotism and violations of basic human rights.”\n\nSDL national director Peceli Kinivuwai said Mr Chaudhry’s resignation was no surprise.\n\nMr Kinivuwai said it was now obvious that Mr Chaudhry was ordered to resign because of his non performance.\n\n“He did this as a cover-up,” he said.\n\nHe was very unpopular with some major business people because of tough economic policies he had put in place.\n\nAfter promising to revive Fiji’s economy, 20 months later and despite all the policies he had put in place, Fiji’s economy remains weak.\n\nWhy resign when his job is unfinished?\n\nWell the excuse is that the party executive council wants him to resign to prepare the party for the next election.\n\nThe party’s preparation will begin with the consultation with party members on the draft People’s Charter.\n\nAfter this consultation, the party will then put out an official statement on whether it supports it or not.\n\nAt a meeting in Ba in July the FLP finally acknowledged its support for the interim government’s proposed People’s Charter for Change and Progress.\n\nA statement issued by Mr Chaudhry in his capacity as party general secretary said one of the six resolutions made by the party at its party delegates’ conference was to support the work of the interim government.\n\nThe party also welcomed electoral reforms proposed by the regime.\n\n“Noting the FLP had twice been a victim of rigged elections, in 2001 and 2006,” he said, “FLP delegates want reforms to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent the electoral machinery being manipulated to the unfair advantage of any one political party.”\n\nIn their resolution to support the charter the party said, a level playing field for all and freedom from discrimination of any kind would ensure peace, political stability and socio-economic prosperity in the country.\n\nMr Chaudhry said while the party supported the return to democratic rule as soon as possible it was important the election take place under an amended electoral system.\n\nNow at its council meeting that gave the directive for Mr Chaudhry and his two colleagues in Cabinet, Vayeshnoi and Rickets to resign it seemed the party had taken a new stand.\n\nParty president Jokapeci Koroi who is also a member of the National Council for Building a Better Fiji, (NCBBF) said the party was still consulting its electorate on the draft People’s Charter and had yet to decide whether it would endorse the document.\n\nShe said much of what was proposed in the draft People’s Charter would need constitutional and legislative amendments.\n\nMs Koroi told the media at a press conference after the national council meeting on Saturday that while the proposed charter had constructive suggestions, there were also grounds of contention with respect to electoral reform, a common name as well as the issue of land.\n\nTo address such stated contentions the FLP would have to be objective in its approach to the charter and be guided by its representatives and electoral constituents.\n\n“To this end the FLP will begin its charter consultation process immediately,” she said.\n\n“A timetable has been set which will see the FLP leadership as well as its senor party officials, in the coming weeks, traverse the nation, and engage in active consultation with the people.\n\n“A concerted media campaign will also be conducted in tandem with the interactive consultation process to enhance public awareness and education.”\n\nShe said the FLP national council strongly believed that the party’s evaluation and consultation exercise with respect to charter would need to be conducted objectively and without any perception or apprehension of bias.\n\nMs Koroi said the process through which the charter was endorsed by the people of Fiji needed to be credible and legitimate, if it was to be acceptable to the local and international community.\n\nThe FLP council was of the view that the recommendations of the draft People’s Charter needed to be carefully evaluated and considered by the party.\n\nIn this process, FLP would need to consult widely with its rank and file members before making a final decision on the charter.\n\nThere is a change of heart in the FLP’s position on the charter.\n\nThe very reason why a directive was given was to give freedom to the party to criticise the charter.\n\nWhile it had endorsed the charter, two weeks later it has said it would consult its electorate for the final decision.\n\nWhy consult now when it was supposed to be done before the draft charter was prepared?\n\nThe council was worried about the proposals in the draft People’s Charter as they would need constitutional and legislative amendments.\n\nAs a member of the NCBBF why didn’t Ms Koroi raise this in one of its meetings?\n\nOr even Mr Chaudhry being a chairperson of one of the committees?\n\nNow that Mr Chaudhry and the two Cabinet members have jumped ship, was their support for the charter just a matter of convenience?\n\nThe FLP interim ministers’ exit is not a loss to the party because it had what it wanted in the draft charter.\n\nIn fact, according to Mr Chaudhry the FLP made strong submissions to the NCBBF to bring in electoral reforms which will be less racially divisive and to consider legislation that will make the media accountable and responsible.\n\nThe party had also fought for a vote of equal value and the reduction of the voting age to 18.\n\nThrough its influence Cabinet has deferred the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC) elections which were due in April this year to April 2010, to take place after the general elections.\n\nThe charter proposal to establish a “Land Use Advisory Board”, “Native Land Register” and a “Land Use Development Plan” are all old FLP favourites.\n\nAccording to ousted Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase this is just another ploy to hide the real motive behind this proposal.\n\nThe real motive is to establish a “Land Use Commission” (LUC) which has been mooted for sometime now by Mahendra Chaudhry and the Fiji Labour Party (FLP). A LUC will further weaken the NLTB by taking away more of its powers and functions.\n\nThe three abandoned ship because they know what they wanted is now in the proposed draft charter and they had to convince their supporters to support this document.\n\nThe only realistic way out for the government of the day is for it to demonstrate that it has marked out a clear path to restoring a democratic government in a credible timeframe. And it must win the international community’s confidence.\n\nWith the confirmation from PM Commodore Bainimarama that there was communication from him about the FLP leader’s resignation a story comes to mind.\n\nAfter AD Patel’s death SM Koya replaced him as National Federation Party leader.\n\nIn one of the meetings leading up to Fiji’s independence, Mr Koya referred to the troubles in Mauritius during the pre-independence elections and said it would greatly help in a peaceful transition to independence if there was no election at that time.\n\nHe proposed that Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara be the Prime Minister of Fiji and said “better to deal with the devil we know.”\n\nSurely the commander and the military council should have known better before approaching the FLP leader to join the interim administration."
