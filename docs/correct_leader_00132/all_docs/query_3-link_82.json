        "text": "In a functioning democracy the role and responsibility of a citizen doesn't stop on the day you cast you vote, infact, it starts from that very day. From that day we need to ensure that we safeguard, strengthen and participate in our democratic proccess and hold our government accountable. We vote for a party to form a government based on the change they promise and hopes that they give to people. It's our right to demand that change. When we elect a government we do not give them a blank check for next four years. We cannot afford to get frustrated and wait for four years to bring about change. We need to ensure our government governs justly, effectively and in the best interst of all its citizens. And elected officials and those appointed to boards and statutory bodies are public servants and answerable to the citizens of the country. When they get elected or appointed they subject themselves to public scrunity and criticism. I may be nobody or a Johny come lately but I am a citizen of this country and I will always exercise my right to safeguard my freedom of speech and expression. Whether one is an affluent member of the society or a poor resident of an informal settlement, our stake in the country, our freedom and rights are of equal strength. It doesn't take Einstein to have a sense of the direction our country is heading because you see a pattern of governance that hasn't changed for more than a year and is deterimental to our country. You also realise that pattern of governance will be consistent for the term of the government. I am not an expert on every issue I raise but I do air my opinions based on the general feeling of the people on the ground. Just imagine if everyone of us go silent and become part of the culture of silence we have in the country. I don't claim to be right all the time but I do respect people's right to differ with me and express alternative opinion freely on my writings. I respect people's right to disagree with me as long as your response is in acceptable and decent language. Even the prime minister of this country has sent me a personal note asking me to keep up the good fight. He is doing political postering and maneuvering to ensure his coalition government survives but when that postering and maneuvering affects the interest and viability of our country then you have to make a stand. I will continue to write because that's what thousands of my followers want. I accept some may agree and some may not and that is fine with me and they are free to disagree with me. The right to privacy and critcism of public officials, elected or appointed, must be weighed against public interest. We must get rid of the culture of silence and speak up on issues of national importance. Vinaka!"
