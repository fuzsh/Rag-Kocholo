        "text": "19 February 2014\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop’s confidence is totally misplaced, if\n\nshe believes that one-day elections in Fiji in September is achievable,\n\nsays Labour Leader Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\n“One day polling requires massive organizational capacity and resources which\n\nthe Elections Office will be unable to build in the short time before the polls.\n\n“We are now effectively less than six months from the promised elections. It\n\nshould be noted that the Elections Office was moth-balled for eight years. It will\n\nhave to start from scratch to have all preparations in place for the one-day polls\n\nin September,” he said.\n\nIt is still in the process of recruiting key staff to assist in the planning,\n\norganisation and management of the elections. After recruitment, they will\n\nhave to undergo intensive and specialized training.\n\nWe don’t have a Supervisor of Elections as yet who should take responsibility\n\nfor the oversight of the elections and the Elections Office.\n\nThere is still no Electoral legislation setting out the rules and guidelines for the\n\nelections. Political parties and the rest of the nation remain in the dark about\n\nhow the polls will be conducted and the requirements governing it.\n\nPolling stations have not been finalized as yet and they are still juggling around\n\nwith the number that will be needed for the one-day polls. The initial number of\n\n3000 announced by the Attorney General has now been reduced to 2000.\n\nThese are serious challenges confronting the conduct of free, fair and credible\n\nelections. They cannot be brushed aside by people who do not have inside\n\nknowledge of the decrepit state of our electoral machinery.\n\nThousands off voters will be unable to get to the polling stations to vote if one-day polling is\n\nforced on the people. This in itself will render the elections a nullity.\n\nMahendra Chaudhry\n\nLeader\n\nRate this:\n\nRelated"
