        "text": "Deposed Fijian prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry has described the situation in the country as alarming with many people suffering.\n\nMr Chaudhry, who was speaking shortly after being released from the parliament building in the capital Suva along with 17 colleagues, said if Fiji was to have a future, everyone had to work together to get the country back on its feet.\n\nBut he said he bore no animosity to those who held him captive for 56 days.\n\nThe hostage takers, led by the businessmen George Speight, were demanding more power for indigenous Fijians at the expense of ethnic Indians.\n\nThere were some anxious moments ... it was not easy for me or my son\n\nMahendra Chaudhry\n\nAfter undergoing health checks, Mr Chaudhry, who is an ethnic Indian, said he expected to continue having a leadership role but it would be up to the people to decide in what capacity.\n\nIn recent days, civil unrest has gripped the country, which has seen landowners take over several tourist resorts and the crippling of Fiji's tourism and sugar-based economy.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the hostages were driven away from the parliamentary compound, in a low-key end to what had been tense stand-off between the army and the rebels.\n\nCaptors tearfully hugged captives and, in a traditional ceremony seeking forgiveness, the rebels offered a bowl of kava, a mildly narcotic drink, to the 18 legislators they had held.\n\nForgiveness\n\nLooking thin and describing himself as feeling a little tired, the 58-year-old returned home to cheering supporters bearing placards reading \"We love you\" and \"Welcome\".\n\nAsked by a reporter how Mr Chaudhry, who defied Fiji's ethnic divide to become the country's first ethnic-Indian prime minister, felt about being deposed, the crowd chanted: \"He is prime minister.\"\n\nAsked whether he still considered himself prime minister, Mr Chaudhry said: \"That's for the people to decide. I've been in politics a long time.\"\n\n'Anxious moments'\n\n\"I think I have a vision for Fiji,\" the former prime minister said. \"Unfortunately, we were unable to fulfil that, we were deposed after 12 months, but I'll continue to work for Fiji.\"\n\nMr Chaudhry said he and his fellow hostages, which included his son, experienced some anxious moments during their captivity in the sprawling parliamentary complex.\n\n\"We used to play, we used to read and we used to take one day at a time,\" he said.\n\n\"There were some anxious moments. I don't think I will elaborate on that now, maybe later on. It was not easy for me or my son.\""
