        "text": "Author: Sudha Ramachandran\n\nPublication: Deccan Herald\n\nDate: March 8, 2001\n\nIntroduction: The Court of Appeal has declared the interim administration illegal. But will Mahendra Chaudhry return as prime minister?\n\nFiji's deposed prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, must have felt vindicated, even victorious, following the Court of Appeal's ruling last week. The verdict was clearly in favour of his ousted government. Yet, barely a week after that historic ruling, Mr Chaudhry himself, just might have little to celebrate.\n\nAlthough the Court ruling has paved the way for the return to democracy in Fiji, there is a strong possibility that it might not be restored. Besides, a serious challenge to Mr Chaudhry's leadership from within his own party indicates that even if democracy is restored in Fiji, he might not return as the country's prime minister.\n\nA five-judge Court of Appeal declared last Thursday that the interim administration under Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase was illegal. It called on acting president Ratu Josefa Iloilo to recall the parliament that was toppled in the May 2000 coup and it held that the 1997 constitution, which gave ethnic Indians and indigenous Fijians equal political rights, had not been abrogated but remained the supreme law of the land.\n\nIt was in elections held under the 1997 constitution that the multi-racial People's Coalition came to power. A year later, following a coup, the government was ousted. The military then stepped in and set up an interim administration. A case filed in the High Court by an ethnic Indian farmer, Chandrika Prasad, resulted in the Court ruling that the 1997 constitution remained valid. The Court of Appeal upheld that ruling last Thursday.\n\nWhile both, acting president Iloilo and interim prime minister Qarase have made public pledges to work towards the return to constitutional rule, there is a lot of uncertainty about the next steps they will take. For one, neither seems to be in any hurry to see that democracy and the deposed government are restored immediately Ratu Iloilo has said that he will decide on his next steps following the decision that the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) makes at its meeting later this week.\n\nIt has emerged, meanwhile, that under the 1997 constitution, the Power to reconvene the parliament is vested with the Speaker of the House. The Court of Appeal, which had revalidated this constitution in its verdict, had called on the acting president to recall the deposed parliament. This confusion can be expected to complicate the political situation in Fiji further.\n\nThe death of former Speaker, Apenisa Kurasiqila means that the power to reconvene parliament is now in the hands of his deputy, Gyannendra Prasad. Mr Prasad is a member of the Fiji Labour Party (FLP), a main constituent of the ousted government. It remains to be seen whether Mr Prasad will go ahead and reconvene the parliament as per the Court's directions, or act, as President Iloilo said he would, in accordance with the decision of the GCC.\n\nThe GCC, which wields considerable political power and influence in Fiji, is not known to make quick decisions. It is a deeply divided house and it is doubtful whether it will reach a clear decision by the weekend. Informed observers say that sections within the GCC resent the Court of Appeals infringement of its (the GCC's) role in Fiji's politics. As a custodian of Fijian interests, it might therefore decide against supporting the ruling. At the same time it is unlikely to completely discard the ruling and could be expected to express qualified support.\n\nThe immediate response of various sections to the Court of Appeal's ruling indicates that little has really changed in Fiji since the coup last year. Although the average Fijian is now weary of the political and economic turmoil, resistance to political power in the hands of an ethnic Indian persists. Sections that were against an ethnic Indian holding the prime minister's post - the Fijian ultranationalists - have come out against the Court ruling. Indian businessmen too who were opposed to the Chaudhry government have not welcomed the ruling and are against the return of the deposed government.\n\nRejecting the Court of Appeal's ruling, the Fiji Forum, a grouping of hard-line nationalist parties, stated that it would not accept the reinstatement of the deposed government. Its chairman, Esira Rabuno, said that indigenous Fijians would not accept a ruling that threatened their rights in the country they \"owned\". The Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT), one of the constituents of the Fiji Forum has said that it continues to support the Qarase administration. Trounced in the 1999 election, the SVT is believed to have been involved in events that culminated in the coup of May 2000 as well as in the November mutiny.\n\nSitiveni Rabuka, the 1987 coup leader and founder leader of the SVT heads the GCC. According to reports, he may be ousted from his position in the GCC during the upcoming meeting.\n\nIf he is removed he could still create trouble from outside the GCC. The SVT and other components of the Fiji Forum have the capacity to arouse nationalist sentiments and to get the indigenous Fijians out into the streets. They will not hesitate to orchestrate violence as they have done in the past. Besides, Mr Rabuka wields influence over key sections in the armed forces.\n\nEven as Fiji awaits the outcome of the crucial GCC meeting, political parties are planning their next steps. The successor to the Qarase administration will have to be acceptable to the indigenous Fijians. It is with this in mind that constituents of the deposed government are charting out their strategy. Moves are afoot to make the coalition more acceptable to the Fijian people. To this end sections of the coalition are seeking to oust Mr Chaudhry from the leadership of the Coalition.\n\nAlthough a meeting of the FLP caucus on Monday initially announced unanimous support for Chaudhry, it was reported later that a motion was tabled calling for his removal from the post of the party's leader. There has been opposition for some time now to Mr Chaudhry's \"abrasive and arrogant style of functioning\".\n\nBesides, many members of the FLP and other constituents of the People's Coalition believe that with Mr Chaudhry, an ethnic Indian, at the helm, the acceptability of the Coalition is much reduced.\n\nThey feel that the only way the Coalition can regain power, whether through the formation of a government of national unity or in a future election, is by replacing him with an indigenous Fijian. Tupeni Baba, deputy prime minister in the deposed government, who is a native Fijian, is expected to emerge as the Coalition's leader.\n\nThe People's Coalition appears to be gearing itself up for a government of national unity. Such a government is expected to include members of the Qarase administration as well. But the Fiji Forum is not in favour of the formation of a government of national unity"
