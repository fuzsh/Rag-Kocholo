        "text": "Ni Sa Bula,\n\nI spent a good part of yesterday reading Dr. Bril Lal's piece that has Mahendra Chaudry, amongst others, up in arms. It made me think of a lot of things, and is the genesis for today's post.\n\nI oppose the coup.\n\nWhy do I oppose the coup?\n\nLooking back at the previous coups, the first 2 in 1987 occured when I was too young to understand the real implications of such a course. Also the fact that it was a new occurance in Fiji meant that most of the Taukei community then did not really understand the repercursions of this course of action. The fact that they supported the actions en-masse is a truthful, yet sad depiction of this.\n\nThe 2000 crisis occured when I had developed an appreciation for democracy and the rule of law, and had formed my individual opinions as to what I believed to be the best for Fiji. Looking back at that dark period in our history, I think I started to realise that coups were never the anser and should never be considered as a solution of any sort to the problems faced in one's country.\n\nThis belief really came to fruition last year. I believe that a coup is wrong. You can never justify it. In our 3 odd decades of existance as an independant nation, we have had too many disruptions to our progress. How can we afford this? How much have we lost, how much have we sacrificed, how much have we given up in this unfulfilling pursuit of power? We have had coups in the name of racial supremacy, coups that are said to be for economical power, coups that are rumoured to be for personal protection....yet none of these things do the country any good. What has any of the previous coups brought us collectively as a nation?\n\nSo why do you oppose the coup?\n\nIs it because you are an SDL supporter?\n\nIs it because you are a Nationalist?\n\nIs it because you lost your job?\n\nIs it because you have had a decrease in your income?\n\nIs it because you hate the FLP?\n\nIs it because you hate the Military?\n\nIs it because you have lost loved ones?\n\nIs it because you have had loved ones injured?\n\nWhile all these, and many other reasons that have been omitted, are very valid reasons for opposing the coup, this coup, and any coup for that matter, should be opposed for the simple reason that it is morally, ethically, legally, socially, economically and politically wrong.\n\nIT IS WRONG!!!\n\nA coup is never the answer. It will alway produce an aggrieved party, it will never heal wounds and it will always perpetuate itself. It never produces what it promises, it never brings progress, it never solves problems, it can only supress, transfer and delay the issues that should be faced. It is like a thorn that is not removed fromt he foot, but covered over and left to fester another day. As such it must be resisted, it should never be condoned and if it takes place, it should never be supported. It reminds me of the old Chinese saying that says \"When riding a tiger, it is difficult to get off\". It is simply not worth the effort.\n\nMost you you would now be wondering...\"What difference does this make? Why is FijianBlack going on about this?\"\n\nThe motive behind your reason is very important. If you oppose this coup because you are an SDL supporter, you will support any coup that favours the SDL. (Note : This could apply to any political party, I'm only using the SDL as an example) If you oppose this coup out of nationalistic sentiments, you will support coups that are nationalistic in nature, as the 1987 coup was, and to a lesser extent the 200 crisis. If you oppose the coup because you lost your job, then you would support a coup if it brought you better job security.\n\nAll these reasons, will make the person who believes in them, akin to a leaf, blown and tossed by the wind. Numerous examples of this sort of behaviour abound in our nation. We can all easily name 10 people whom we know to have been coup supporters/opposers at one time and have now changed their stance. Instead of right and wrong being defined in our hearts, it is then defined by what is happening around us. It then becomes a subjective measure, instead of the objective standard that right and wrong should be, a plumbline that everything must be measured against.\n\nIf you oppose the coups because they are wrong, then you will never sing a different song. You will always call it wrong, you will always say it is wrong, and you will always oppose it.\n\nA coup demonstrates a lack of civility, a disregard for the governing laws of our nation, for the will of the people, it displays an unwillingness to accept that maybe, just maybe your point of view is not the commonly accepted one. It is no more that a bully that tries to force his views on others, and will not accept the fact that everyone is entitled to their own personal views and that these views, while possibly different from ours, must be respected, even if we disagree with them.\n\nA coup is never right.\n\nWhy do you oppose this coup? If you oppose this coup for the only reason that is right, then there is hope for this nation. If you oppose this coup for any other reason, then we are doomed to repeat this mistake again.\n\nGod Bless Fiji,\n\nFijianBlack AKA Mawdsomething\n\nNi Sa Bula,\n\nToday, I have chosen to repost a letter found in today's Fiji Times. It's a reply by Dr. Brij. Lal, who condemns the 2006 coup, and is now, ironically, accused by Mahendra Chaudry and others as being anti-Indian. Actually, to correct that perception, he is anti-coup, the same as yours truly.\n\nA coup is the worst thing that can happen to a nation. It reminds me of the proverb saying \" Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give.\" (Proverbs 25:14). That is exactly what a coup is...it promises much and delivers absolutly nothing. And for that reason, it must be resisted to the utmost, because it is, in reality, the political version of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow at a national scale.\n\nAnyway, this is what the learned Doctor had to say.\n\n**************************************************************************************\n\nI REFER to letters by Mahendra Chaudhry and Mosmi Bhim (FT 24/10).\n\nIt appears that these two respondents are reacting to an item in this paper referring to an article by me on the immediate aftermath of the Fiji coup which was published in the journal Fijian Studies.\n\nI would urge both these correspondents to read that 12,000 word article in its entirety and not judge me on the basis of a brief newspaper report, which I did not authorise and have not actually seen.\n\nThey will then see how completely they have misread my piece and attributed to me views I do not share, did not express.\n\nThere can be no excuse for their ignorance in this instance, especially when they are casting aspersions on the motives and integrity of another person.\n\nI wish to reassure Ms Bhim that I do not seek nor need publicity. I have no political or any other ambition. Nor do I need a lecture from a novice on my understanding of, and sensitivity to, the feelings and aspirations of the Indo-Fijian community.\n\nMy published record speaks for itself.\n\nI am called many things these days but being accused of aiding and abetting the victimisation of my own people is new, and, well, actually laughable.\n\nComing from an aspiring scholar of sorts, this kind of knee-jerk, sophomoric response is regrettable, but in the broader context of things, not altogether surprising.\n\nMr Chaudhry is, of course, entitled to his views, however self-serving and indignantly self-righteous they might be, but my full article cannot by any stretch of the imagination be construed to be a personal attack on him or on anyone else.\n\nIndeed, only one section of the article is devoted to the appointment of the interim administration.\n\nI said that Mr Chaudhry was the dominant Indo-Fijian leader in Fiji, and easily the most experienced politician in the interim administration.\n\nHis presence there, as then head of four ministries (Finance, Sugar, National Planning and Public Enterprises), led many nationalist Fijians to see the interim administration as his handmaiden.\n\nThat is all.\n\nI have never said that the December 2006 coup was an \"Indian coup\".\n\nOn the contrary, in an article published in this paper several months ago, \"Whose coup was it anyway\", I argued to the contrary. These two responses demonstrate the tenor of political discourse in today's Fiji.\n\nJust because Mr Chaudhry and Ms Bhim do not approve of something I have said, I have all of a sudden become \"anti-Indian\", full of malice and blind prejudice, vindictive, a mouthpiece of the Qarase regime, downright dishonest, an academic of impaired credibility.\n\nThe list of pejorative epithets is impressive.\n\nThey have set themselves as the guardians of Indian interest and anyone who dares to disagree with them must, by definition, be all these nasty things.\n\nOh well. In 1987 and again in 2000, I was viciously attacked for being anti-Fijian because of my staunch opposition to those two coups.\n\nNow, I am being called anti-Indian for criticising the latest coup.\n\nOne can never win.\n\nI began my coup paper by quoting the words of Mahatma Gandhi, and I stand by them: \"However much I may sympathise with and admire worthy motives, I am an uncompromising opponent of violent methods even to serve the noblest of causes\".\n\nBrij v. Lal\n\nCanberra\n\nNi Sa Bula,\n\nThe issue of Racism has reared it's ugly head. Well, this is one arguement that is being used against the SDL by Bainimarama and his followers...the accusation that the policies that were being put forward by the SDL were racist. Namely the Qoliqoli Bill and the Affirmative Action are the two \"victims\" in the sights of the FMF, a place they have lived ever since they were mooted.\n\nNow let's look at what racism is. Racism is defined as \" The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a particular race is superior to others..\" The claim put forward is that the Bill and the Affirmative Action program were racist. Now how is that? The area in question was given by individual landowners 125 years ago to the Crown, and when the Crown returned it at Independence, it was returned to the State, which was not the original owner of the area in question. As such shouldn't the landowners be entitled to receive what they had given? If the claim for land by indigineous owners is racist, then the Aborigines in Australia, the Maori in New Zealand, the Native Americans in North America, in fact every indigineous race is racist to claim land that belonds to them, and was taken by means that are often illegal, immoral and just plain wrong. As the State returned Native Land to the Native Land owners, why was there a distinction made to the Qoliqoli areas?\n\nThis claim is often made that Fijians are racist when they stand up for what is rightfully theirs. This quote from Wikipedia by an Ashneel Singh states\" We believe that God has given three things for free: the land the wind and the sea. I don't think Qarase should have taken the land and just given it to the Fijians. What would be left for the Indian community?\" If that was true (and it is patently not, as I will now prove) it would be against the beliefs of the Indian Community to own land. The question asked here is important, because it brings to the fore, the core issue that is why we have this problem in our country - the issue of land ownership.\n\nLand ownership is at the root of one's security. When leases expire, there is a lot of problems because the tenants often feel attachments that often go beyond what the contracts they signed. This, however is the way leases go....you sign a contract and when it's term ends, the decision to extend is solely the owners. Whether the lease is for land, accomodation, cars or any other thing, by signing on the dotted line, both parties agree to be bound by the agreement, which also implies that there is an end date.\n\nWe can all agree that there are disparities between Fijians and Indians, with Indians in general, being better off. I say in general, because there are cases of Indians being in even poorer conditions than Fijians. While I am not an SDL apologist, I think this is why the Affirmative Action program was put into place. Having said that, I believe that that is not the answer. A handout is not what Fijians need......Fijians need to adopt the work ethics of our Indian brothers if they are to succeed in this new Fiji. As the Bible says \" Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will serve before kings; he will not serve before obscure men.\"\n\nHowever, there is one point that needs to be driven home.\n\nTHERE IS NO ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE FOR A COUP.!!!!!!!\n\nThe IG are using this as one of the excuses they carried out the coup...corruption being the other. None of these are valid reasons for taking out any Government, that has won elections fair and square. There has been no evidence of corruption on the previous Government's part. Sure there are rumours and slander floating about, but no hard evidence apart from information obtained.\n\nThis coup is surely about other issues. Using racism is just a red herring thrown at us to divert us from the real issues. If we swallow the bait, this problem will not dissappear from our nation...and that wil be a real tragedy.\n\nGod Bless Fiji\n\nFijianBlack aka Mawdsomething\n\nNi Sa Bula,\n\nAs the title of this post probably aluded to, today's focus is on the promises that this regime has made, and the lies that have been told.\n\nIn Tonga, Bainimarama made committments to take us to elections by March 2009, and actually signed agreements that this would be done under the current 1997 Constitution. The day after, though, we have this man stating that he would be making changes to the Constitution, and he would be doing so before the elections.\n\nNow why doesn't that surprise me?\n\nThis regime has made it a norm to renege on their promises. It has promised so many things that it has not delivered on. It said that there was corruption rampant in the previous governments. It stated that it would deliver the evidence, yet the lack of evidence, is deafening in it's unavailability.\n\nWHERE IS THE EVIDENCE?\n\nNow surely that is one tamani big lasu this regime has told the people of Fiji.\n\nAnother is the often hyped \"Moving Forward\" claim. Sometimes, you wonder, how the idiots who call themselves the Government can see the world around them. The evidence of the deteorating state of our economy is all around, yet this regime, and it's frantic supporters still claim wildly that things are going to be better. Sorry....things were better. I could criticise Qarase. I could say my piece without fear of retribution, or retaliation. Fear was a small child then, now it's a big hulking brute that bestrides this island paradise and holds many in its grip, riddling them with the inability to speak out. How can that be moving forward?\n\nWe have another lie, the one Mahendra told the farmers, that the EU money was forthcoming. Not according to this. Guess now the farmers that have formed the middleground of the FLP must feel kinda bad, considering that their \"champion\" has now morphed into something they just can't understand.....you really have to feel for them.\n\nThen there was the promise, the no member of this regime would benefit from the coup. Guess that one is so far gone now, that to resurrect the lie in the minds of the people of Fiji would be akin to Jesus calling Lazarus forth from the tomb. Countless numbers of supporters of this regime have benefitted immensly from the coup, of which Teleni, Leweni, Aiyaz, Shaista, the Bainimarama clan and the Chaudry horde are the principle receipients.\n\nNo matter where you look, the coup has changed the political, economical and socialogical face of our nation.\n\nNever has it seemed so dark.\n\nNever has it seemed so hopeless.\n\nNever has it seemed useless.\n\nBut it isn't.....not if you refuse to accept it. If you believe that we can overcome this, that we are better than this, that we can, and will rise above this, you will hope. Hope that Fiji will restored to her place, that her sons and daughters will again live in peace, that our children will not bear the burdens that we bear.\n\nSo let us pray for our nation. Let us speak for her. Let us tell all who watch us that we, the people of Fiji, have had enough of this crap, that we want, we deserve a better leader, a better government that what has been visited upon us. We need to stand together, united and sepak in one voice....and the good times will come. That, my brothers and sisters, is a promise that is no lie.\n\nGod Bless Fiji,\n\nFijianBlack aka Mawdsomething\n\nNi Sa Bula,\n\nToday, I want to debunk a few myths and lies that the spin doctors working for this regime have spawned, in their efforts to divert attention of the international community from the real and pressing issues that now confront us as a nation.\n\nPrinciple amongst these is the claim of \"moving Fiji forward.\" By all measures, Fiji was moving forward before this coup, in fact before all other coups. Each coup has set Fiji backwards, and this one is no different. Every time we have a coup, our standing, our reputation with the international community heads south. Deep south. The idea therefore of using a coup to move the country forward via a coup is absurd, to say the least. How can a course of action that leads to economic, financial, social and political hardship be moving us forward? How can killing innocent civilians be justified with this? How can toppling a democratically elected government move us forward?\n\nAll these coups have achieved is they have stunted our growth as a nation. It's a testiment to our resilience as a country that we still grew in this period - no thanks to the coup executers. Imagine where we would be now if there had never been coups? I'm sure those of you who are economically and statistically inclined can easily prove this from the GDP growth figures and the like that our Bureau of Stats produces faithfully each year.\n\nNow Bainimarama claimed that \"our doors are open and we have nothing to hide\". Really?????? How about the murderers who are still at large and hiding as soldiers? How about the tax evaders masquerading as ministers in your Government? How about the rampant Human Rights violations condoned and carried out against those who speak out in opposition against this coup? A little bird told me that the FMF still search for me....and that the search for the \"bloggers\" has not died down at all. How about the fact that our taxes are now being used to fund trips overseas for unelected regime members, for rental cars used by this regime? How about the fact that there has not been a shred of evidence produced by this regime to justify it's actions? oh I forgot, they didn't hide that..BECAUSE HIDING IT WOULD IMPLY THAT THEY HAVE THE EVIDENCE WHICH THEY DON'T!!!!!!\n\nAnother claim Bainimarama made is that \"we are on our way to improving governance and creating a more progressive nation\". I thought the fact that the 2006 elections produced the first truly multiparty cabinet was a sign of a country making progress. I thought the fact that the number of seats awarded in said parliment reflected the wishes of the people was testimony to the progress we were making as a nation. Improving Governance???? How???? By appointing idiots like Teleni, Leweni, Aiyaz and Shaista to positions they have no experience, intelligence or plain old common sense for? By running the nation as an extension of a petty group of soldiers whose knowledge base doesn't go far beyond marching, watching and guarding? By listening to people like Raturala for advise on the media, Kurusiga for advise on the GCC, Aiyaz for advise on legal issues, Shaista for advise on human rights issues, Nailatikau for Foreign affiars????? How good is the country going to be, surely if you use these mentally challenged people to decide the fates of our people? What have they done to merit ( THE WORD IS MERIT!!!) their positions? What have you done Bainimarama, to prove that you have the nous, the capability to lead this nation? Your leadership is bringing us progress...in the wrong direction.\n\nNow Japan has joined a lot of other nations in condemning this regime. USA, Australia, New Zealand, the EU, and Canada have all condemned this regime. The G8 have said \" Bainimarama, your regime sucks...\" and this is coming from people who know the real deal, and it is surely not this \"Government\".\n\nWe are not moving forward. Moving forward does not mean pay cuts, job losses, death, injury, aid suspension, assistance withdrawl. It means better living conditions for us, for all. Now investers who had their eye on Fiji are now spending their money elsewhere, and we are losing out to our neighbours, as they international community see us as a volatile nation, one in which it is not safe to invest. Moving forward means elections, an inclusive government, where the policies and legislations implemented are reflective of the will of the people, and not as we have now, where the will of the people is being subjugated to the will of the idiots... I mean the few.\n\nSeriously, why can't we have elections? Why? No Money? I'm sure the international community will fall over themselves to donate expertise, money and resources to fund any election. No candidates? Possibly..with this regime threatening previous candidates who would like to stand in any upcoming elections if there are any. Any why shouldn't they? Isn't the decision as to who forms the next Government ours? Who gave this regime the right to decide that? The guns? How pathetic!!! What kind of moving forward is that?\n\nTo move forward, this is what we need to do.\n\nHave elections.\n\nGet a Democratically elected government in place\n\nDismantle the Army. It's an institute that got FJ$80 million in last year's budget (given by the SDL no less!!) and they brought all this crap down upon us. To really get rid of the coup culture, get rid of it's incubator in Delainabua.\n\nProsecute all coup executers, and put them away for a long, long time. Why should George Speight be the only one to pay his dues to society? Rabuka and Bainimarama should also join him. Or are there a different set of rules for soldiers who break the law?\n\nTo the liars in the FMF Media Cell, please stop peddling all this rubbish. It's makes you look really stupid. The people of Fiji are far more intelligent than you give them credit for,\n\nGod Bless Fiji,\n\nFijianBlack aka Mawdsomething.\n\nNi Sa Bula,\n\nThe events unfolding over the last few days have been very interesting.\n\nFirstly, we have the rejection of the visa application made by one Voreqe Bainimarama to enter Italy. Now I wasn't sure whether this meant that ole Frankie is now in the outhouse as far as the Europeans are concerned....then came the news last night that the Sugar subsidies that Chaudry and Co were promising to the cane belt people in the West and the North would not be given until next year, and even that conditional to evidence that real and measurable progress had been made towards returning Fiji to democracy. For good measure, they have also made the prevention of any intimidating utterances by the security forces another condition. See...even the international community see the crap this junta has been spewing. Mahendra, being as idiotic as only he can be, came on the 6pm news to say that now that the PER has been lifted, the money should be coming through soon. Yeah right!!!! and pigs fly!!! How moronic is that??? and this is the type of person who now controls the Government coffers!!! The only consolation I have is that he is not there by the will of the people. How do you like them apples????\n\nNow our neighbours Australia, have, revised their security assessment of our country, and have warned it's citizens intent on visiting our shores of the possibility of \"sporadic outbreaks of violence\" in and around Suva. The Military, taking their cue from Mr (No) Money Man Mahen, are now clamouring (led by a certain Officer whose shoe size can be seen by the width and depth of his mouth) that the Australian reaction is due to their defeat in the RWC 2007 quater finals. What a bunch of idiots!!!! It's not due to that...it's due to the fact that they perceive Fiji to be unstable and are warning their citizens accordingly!!! That is the duty of any responsible government....oh my mistake...you are neither responsible or a government!!!\n\nThen we have this gem from the newly (sic) appointed Commissioner of Police who in a fit of lunacy, wrote to the Attorney General demanding the removal of Justice Winters and Jitoko from the trial of one Francis Kean....for those of you who haven't been following the plot, this Francis Kean is the brother-in-law of the gentleman whose Italian Visa Application was rejected. His excuse? The fact that the two gentlemen, as non-supporters of the coup, would be biased against Kean. How absurd is that? These are judges with years of experience, professionals who do their job well, and know that whatever decisions they make must stand up to the scrutiny they will inevitably invite. The punch line in all this is that the legal counsel for the accused, presented said letter to the court ....wait for it.....AS EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THEIR SUBMISSION THAT THE JUDGES REMOVE THEMSELVES!!!! ha ha ha ha ha\n\nAs if that wasn't enough....Mr. Chaudry again appears on the news telling all and sundry that there will be a tax amnesty for all defaulting taxpayers for a month. Surely, you're not thinking of taking advantage of that month now are you, Mahen?\n\nlet me gather my thoughts.....\n\nSo we have a \"government\" whose leader is persona non grata in quite a few countries (Italy, USA, New Zealand, Australia immediately spring to mind), a Money Man who has no money, a Commissioner of Police who is trying to pervert justice, an Army ,who, instead of defending the country is attacking it...sounds like a very bad joke doesn't it?\n\nThe sad thing is it's not. It's happening...and it's happening right here in Fiji!!! Here in the island paradise we call home, in the country we all live in and love and hope will again one day be the sort of place we would be proud to bequeath upon our children. We cannot continue like this, we need to stand up and do something.\n\nWill you do something about it?\n\nGod Bless Fiji,\n\nFijianBlack AKA Mawdsomething\n\nNi Sa Bula,\n\nThe events unfolding over the last few days are another confirmation of the inescapible fact of life - THE TRUTH CAN NEVER BE HIDDEN.\n\nOur boys played out of their skins over the weekend, and together with the Pumas of Argentina, are the big movers in the hierachy of rugby. Their performance brought home a truth that was long buried under layers of doubt, and lack of self belief, the fact that if we put our mind to it, we can be world beaters at this game. Now with the belief within the team and the country, no wonder the 1/4s this weekend is surely one of the most anticipated games Fiji has to play in for a long time.\n\nOn the flip side of things, the rejection of Bainimarama's visa by the Italian Govenment surely underlines the fact that he is considered an \"undesirable\" by that country. As a key member of the EU, and also a party to the Schengen Agreement, this means that other signatories to this agreement would also stop Frankie at their borders. Guess that means watching the World Cup live is a non-option as well, since France is a founding signatory to this.\n\nAnother truth that was being buried was the fact that the Constitition of this \"little pile of mud\" was still in force. That said, it made the coup, the removal of Qarase's government, any changes made by decree to the laws of our nation effectively illegal.....all together now \"I TOLD YOU SO!!!\" This has come out in the Qarase lawsuit and will be a test case to the legal integrity of this regime. Kinda reduces the junta to the level of petty criminals and thieves. Guess the \"great legal minds\" in their fold must be practically frothing at the mouth over this development....put a report out on that one Shaista!!!!\n\nYet another truth that has yet to see the light of day are the identities of the murderers of Verebasaga and Rabaka. While we may never know, there is One who knows, One who sees, One who judges and in the end it will all be revealed.\n\nNow the thing about the truth is that you cannot stop it. You cannot hide it. You cannot defeat it. As Winston Churchill once said “The truth is incontrovertible, malice may attack it, ignorance may deride it, but in the end; there it is.”\n\nRest assured in the truth that God does not pay at the end of every day.......\n\nBUT IN THE END, HE PAYS!!!!\n\nGod Bless Fiji\n\nMawdsomething AKA Fijianblack"
