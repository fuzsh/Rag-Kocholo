What does Chaudhry want to achieve by trifling again with Fijian land? Somehow he just can't help himself. He of all people in Fiji should know of the sensitivity Fijians attach to their land, yet he persists in seeking to meddle in it. Fijians are truly sick and tired of it and will vehemently resist any attempt to make changes to it, let alone by a military\n\nbacked and illegal regime. He would do well to desist forthwith and seek a quick return to democratic rule to test his mandate with the people of Fiji. He alone remains the most hated individual by Fijians for his ongoing attempt, now aided by an illegal regime, to meddle in Fijian matters.\n\nLandowners should be co-investors\n\n19 FEB 2008 - www.fijilive.com\n\nA University of the South Pacific academic says he would rather see a partnership arrangement where landowners themselves directly and actively participate in the commercial farming process with tenants as co-investors.\n\nDr Steven Ratuva says he would prefer this than having an ethnically divisive division of labour as suggested in the (controversial M Krishnamurthi) report.\n\nBeing co-investors would ensure that landowners learn the farming skills which they have been deprived of, says Dr Ratuva, the head of the Division of Sociology and Social Work, School of Social Science, Faculty of Arts and Law.\n\nThe Krishnamurthi report suggests the de-reserving of all native lands; that instead of 4 hectare farms which are uneconomical, lots of 40 to 400 hectares be created and leased to one individual or company without affecting land ownership; that the ownership will continue to be vested in the title holder, and that all investments will be by the lessee and that the lease period to be a minimum of 75 years or more.\n\nIt further recommended that the profits may be shared in a format acceptable to the landowner and cultivator, that is, the lessee may pay rentals, the landowner may undertake share farming, (the lessee will create infrastructure and cultivate cane); the owners will be employed by the lessee on fortnightly basis; and that the proceeds will be shared 30 : 60 after costs – 30 per cent to the owner.\n\nBut Dr Ratuva believes the landowners and tenants can become shareholders within a corporate type structure and the company needs to run professionally.\n\nHe suggested that the ethanol plants which are expected to be built also need to be run along the same corporate partnership between landowners, tenants, government and other investors.\n\nIn this way, the benefits of the sugar industry are shared equitably and also it could help create good ethnic relations, he pointed out.\n\nOn the proposal to de-reserve all native land which in the past few days has caused much alarm amongst landowners, Dr Ratuva pointed out that in the given political climate, just the mere mention of the term \"de-reservation\" of native land is not a politically tactical thing to do.\n\n“It was bound to provoke reaction.”\n\nHe says there is enough native land available to be leased now without really touching the reserved land.\n\nThe suggestions for lease arrangements are not new at all in the sense that they merely reinforce the existing arrangements, he pointed out.\n\n“For instance, Fijians provide the land and the tenants provide the capital and expertise.\n\n“This is the same old colonial arrangement which has done very little to enhance Fijian commercial progress and improve ethnic relations,” he added.\n\nDon't touch our land: villagers -

15 Feb 2008\n\nWhose authority?\n\nWHO gave Doctor M Krishnamurthi the authority to come and consult and make recommendations about the use of native land?\n\nDoes he have land of his own that is used in the manner he is recommending?\n\nSince it seems his report was commissioned by Mahendra Chaudhry, we wish to remind Voreqe Bainimarama to keep a close watch on members of the interim regime.\n\nHe promised to clean out corruption but he's lost the plot be bringing in people such as Chaudhry to run our affairs.\n\nLeave the issues about land and get on with the business of getting us to the polls.\n\nAt the same time, show us evidence of corruption you vehemently profess to have and stop wasting taxpayers' money on overseas trips.\n\nVani Veikoso\n\nTurkey\n\nNaomi Roberts\n\nAustralia\n\nInterim govt questioned on native land\n\nwww.fijivillage.com - 15/02/2008\n\nOusted Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase has today questioned why the interim government is trying to get more native land when there is already sufficient land available for cane farming.\n\nQarase said Interim Finance Minister, Mahendra Chaudhry should clear the air why they are even considering the proposal from the Indian consultant, Doctor M Krishnamurti to de-reserve all native land.\n\nHe said the proposal if endorsed will lock down even more native land for cane farms.\n\nQarase said the real issue is productivity in the sugar industry, not insufficient native land.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Village News yesterday, Chaudhry said he will not politicize the issue as the landowners will be the ones who will decide on the future arrangements for native land.\n\nAlthough NLTB is considering the proposal, Chaudhry said there are real benefits for the indigenous Fijian landowners.\n\nChaudhry also said critics should stop saying that he is behind the proposal to de-reserve the native land.\n\nThe report by the consultant from India, Doctor M Krishnamurti to the Sugar Ministry, has recommended all native land be de-reserved. The native reserve is the land set aside for each mataqali for its planting and to support the landowning unit's needs.\n\nThe reserved land is not to be leased out as it is arable land for the mataqali's needs.\n\nDoctor Krishnamurti's report has recommended that the 4 hectare lots for cane farming are uneconomical and 40 to 400 hectare farms are more viable. He also recommends that all investments on the proposed farms be carried out by the lessee and the lease terms be a minimum of 75 years.\n\nSikivou: I was only doing my job\n\nFriday, February 15, 2008 - www.fijitimes.com\n\nTHE permanent secretary for Finance, Peni Sikivou, says he was only doing his job when he was given the project proposal on the de-reservation of native land from his minister last month.\n\n\"I was given the proposal and a note by Mr Chaudhry to send it to the Native Land Trust Board for further action,\" said Mr Sikivou.\n\n\"That is why my name was in the letter attached to the project proposal by Krishnamurthi, the Indian consultant.\"\n\nMr Sikivou said he was concerned about some recommendations in the proposal especially the de- reservation of native reserves.\n\n\"I am concerned that this proposal aims to de- reserve native land,\" he said.\n\nHe said the interim minister was the best person to answer to the project proposal by the consultant from India.\n\nMeanwhile, interim Finance Minister Mahendra Chaudhry said he would not politicise the issue because the landowners were the ones who would decide the future arrangements for native land, according to a local radio report yesterday.\n\nNLTB spokesman Ro Alipate Mataitini said the NLTB would see that if certain development proposals on native land were detrimental to the interest of the landowners, then the board would not agree to them.\n\n\"But if the proposal benefits the landowners, then we will approve the development,\" Ro Alipate said\n\nMixed reaction to land issue\n\nUNAISI RATUBALAVU\n\nFriday, February 15, 2008\n\nTHERE were mixed reactions yesterday from provinces at the interim Government's move to de-reserve native land.\n\nLast month, the Finance Ministry wrote to the Native Land Trust Board to consider a proposal to de-reserve land by a consultant from India.\n\nMost provincial councils The Fiji Times spoke to felt it was not a good idea to touch reserve land.\n\nRewa provincial council chairman Pita Tagicakiverata said Rewa had only one per cent of the total land mass in Fiji.\n\n\"Rewa has only 272 square kilometres and if we give our reserve land, we would end up with no land. I'm totally against the proposal.\" Bua provincial council chairman Ratu Filimoni Ralogaivau said even though the proposal had not been approved, it would be hard for Fijians to give their native reserves.\n\n\"That land is where they have their plantations and burial sites, so it will be hard for them to give it up.\n\n\"There are only 38 percent of reserve land left for Fijians,\" Ratu Filimoni said. Kadavu Provincial Council chairman Ratu Josateki Nawalowalo said land leased outside native reserves has not been utilised to its full potential for economic returns.\n\n\"Why touch native reserves? If we can't use land outside the reserves, it does not make sense,\" Ratu Jo said.\n\nTui Macuata Ratu Aisea Katonivere said he had faith in the NLTB to protect native land and interests of landowners as bestowed to it by law.\n\n\"I know the NLTB will make the best decisions for the betterment of all landowners,\" Ratu Aisea said.\n\nLomaiviti provincial council chairman Ratu Jolame Lewanavanua said his province would not be affected by the proposal.\n\n\"The proposal will only affect provinces where they have sugarcane like in the West and North,\" Ratu Jolame said.\n\nAssistant Roko Naitasiri Ratu Josefa Navakaroko said he had not seen anything in black and white.\n\n\"This is news to me. I will comment when I see it on paper.\"\n\nHANDS OFF\n\n14-Feb-2008 -www.fijidailypost.com\n\nIndigenous body rebukes idea of de-reserving native land\n\nA PLAN to de-reserve native land has been viewed by an indigenous rights group as something akin to sacrilege.\n\nThe Fiji Indigenous Ownership and Rights Association (FIORA) has rebuked any suggestions of de-reserving native land.\n\n“The landowning units (mataqali) should be properly informed and consulted, as in accordance with the law, before their land under reserve are touched,” said FIORA spokesman Francis Waqa Sokonibogi.\n\n“The first thing to be done in this case is to get the consent of more than 50 percent of the landowning unit before there are moves to carry this out.”\n\nHe added that it seems that interim Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama, and ‘his mouthpiece’ interim Sugar Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, are doing what any typical ‘landless’ person will do and meddle with land.\n\nHe made these comments after following revelations that a report prepared by an Indian consultancy agency suggests that native land be de-reserved to assist in the recovery of the ailing sugar industry.\n\nSokonibogi said native land was never meant to be used for national interest.\n\nHe added that even if there were plans to de-reserve native land then protocol dictates it should not be made public.\n\n“Once it is de-reserved this opens the land up for commercial use and members of the mataqali and their families may be left with nothing,” said Sokonibogi.\n\n“They have spat on the Fijian people’s protocol. They should let Fijians do things their own way.”\n\nBut Native Land Trust Board maintains that native land is safe and protected under the law.\n\nNLTB acting general manager Meli Benuci said that the law is quite clear on control and protection of all native land.\n\n“Under Section 4(1) of the Native Lands Trust Act NLTA, the control of all native land shall be vested in the board and all such land shall be administered by the board for the benefit of the Fijian owners, he said.\n\nHe added that under Section 15(1) of the NLTA, it is lawful for the board to set aside any portion of native land as a native reserve.\n\nBut he stressed that no matter what, the nod will have to come solely from the landowners.\n\n“In other words, de-reservation of native land cannot be done without the express approval of a majority of landowners concerned.\n\n“This guideline is enshrined in the Native Lands Trust Act itself, and therefore if the Interim Government is now wishing to de-reserve all native land we would need the express approval of a majority of all native landowners in question,” said Benuci.\n\n“Notwithstanding the above, such an exercise is not one which the NLTB should even consider given our fiduciary duty to landowners to ensure that they always have sufficient land for their maintenance, subsistence and survival.\n\n“Any action to de-reserve all native land is in itself contrary to this duty, as landowners will no longer have any native reserve to use as they please.”\n\nBenuci added that it was more than mere economics, as land represents life and sustenance, identity and culture.\n\n“Mindful of its role in providing maximum benefits for the landowner, the NLTB also has other important roles to play in providing for lands for national development and giving access to land for others.\n\n“The system is provided for flexibility in that it can de-reserve customary lands for the need of others.\n\n“This however, must recognise the special connection the Fijian has to the land.\n\nIt is the one tangible asset possessed by Fijians in an insecure, changing world in which material progress seemed to pass them by,” he concluded.\n\nDeregister plan\n\nUNAISI RATUBALAVU\n\nThursday, February 14, 2008\n\nThere are moves by the interim Government to de-reserve native reserve land.\n\nThis follows instructions from Finance Ministry permanent secretary for Sugar Peni Sikivou to the Native Land Trust Board last month to consider a proposal to de-reserve land by a consultant from India.\n\nThe cover letter of the report states the NLTB needed to consider a proposal by sugar expert Dr Krishnamurthi on the rehabilitation of the sugar industry and to have a reply by January 18.\n\nThe paper provides recommendations to use de-reserved land for lots of 40 to 400 hectares to be created and leased to individuals or companies that undertake commercial farming.\n\nThe report was compiled in November last year and submitted to interim Finance Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\nMr Sikivou refused to comment on the report, saying he was busy in a meeting yesterday.\n\nMr Chaudhry was unavailable for comment.\n\nDr Krishnamurthi said in the report it was well known that Fijians did not have enough incentives for farming.\n\n\"They had their own serious social problems that were ignored and that the laws governing their inheritance was of sharing and not lineage inheritance,\" he said.\n\nDr Krishnamurthi said the share of the proceeds from Fijian land was negligible and of no value.\n\nHe said Fijians had a lack of security and could not finance their land.\n\n\"In effect, neither the successive governments nor the NLTB or chiefs ever contributed to the welfare of the indigenous Fijians, leaving the landowners poor in standards of living,\" he said.\n\n\"The Fijianisation program did not yield the desired results because of the lack of leadership.\"\n\nBut these statements have angered chiefs who will not allow an outsider to suggest the de-reservation of their land.\n\nTui Tavua Ratu Ovini Bokini said the interim administration needed to consult landowners honestly about its intentions.\n\nHe said there was no way he was willing to deregister land for sugar cane as the returns were low.\n\nNative reserve land is established under the Native Lands Trust Act.\n\nThis land is set aside in certain areas for the use of landowners known as ikovukovu.\n\nIt is to ensure there is always sufficient land for the landowners to use.\n\nBurebasaga confederacy paramount chief Ro Teimumu Kepa said the regime had no right to make a unilateral decision on land that was collectively owned by Fijian landowning units.\n\n\"The regime cannot bulldoze their agenda on the people. The landowners must be consulted as the asset belongs to them,\" she said.\n\nKomai Nausori Ratu Meli Balenaivalu said he would not give any land for such purposes because it was owned by the past, present and future generations.\n\n\"I am shocked to hear the regime is pursuing to de-register land without consulting landowners when native land is a sensitive issue Fijians value close to their hearts,\" he said.\n\nBau chief Adi Samanunu Cakobau said she was concerned about the move in her capacity as a Fijian chief.\n\n\"This is news to me and as a chief I am concerned,\" she said.\n\nSERAFINA QALO\n\nwww.fijitimes.com - Thursday, February 14, 2008\n\nTHE province of Cakaudrove has warned interim Finance Minister Mahendra Chaudhry to back off and not touch land issues.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Tui Cakau Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu and the people of Cakaudrove, Epeli Matata yesterday said Mr Chaudhry and the interim regime had better not dereserve the land Fijian forefathers left behind for their generation. The warning comes after the Ministry of Finance, National Planning and Sugar Industry asked the Native Lands Trust Board to dereserve reserved land and utilise it for sugarcane farming and leasing.\n\n\"We are warning him now not to touch the land and he had better abide by it because we will not sit and watch our reserve land taken from us.\n\n\"Although Mr Chaudhry is talking about the reserve land in cane belt areas, it will automatically count in the other reserve land around the country as they would want to use the land for economic purposes,\" Mr Matata said. No comment could be obtained from Mr Chaudhry when contacted.\n\nThe Bua Landowners Association said it could not understand why Mr Chaudhry, since becoming the first Indian prime minister, always wanted to touch Fijian land.\n\n\"It's a sensitive issue and it seems Mr Chaudhry is the only one who wants to touch land of the indigenous community when there are other bodies such as the European Union that has greatly helped the sugar industry,\" said Tevita Raiova, the association's spokesman.\n\n\"Even companies that plant mahogany and pine on our land have not dared ask us to dereserve our reserved land because they know how much it means to us so we hope this government will respect landowners' wishes and that is to leave our land alone,\" Mr Raiova said.\n\nAnother major landowning unit in Naweni Village, Mataqali Valelevu has called on Mr Chaudhry to concentrate on reviving the economy.\n\nChief warns of catastrophe for Fiji\n\nwww.fijilive.com - 14 FEB 2008\n\nA high chief has warned that the latest development by Fiji's interim regime to de-reserve native land will be a ‘catastrophic mistake’\n\nThe proposed de-reservation of native land, which comprises almost 90 per cent of the Fiji land mass, is one of the major recommendations in the report by a India-based consultant to the Sugar Minister Mahendra Chaudhry last November.\n\nThe interim Government is considering the proposal in order to revamp the ailing sugar industry.\n\nNadroga chief Na Ka Levu, Ratu Sakiusa Makutu said Fiji has found itself thrust in the middle of a very traumatic period that is not only bringing the country to its knees, but tearing it apart.\n\n“Among the long list of interim blunders, this development regarding de-reservation of native land will be a catastrophic mistake.\n\n“I would suggest a great degree of caution,” he told Fijilive.\n\nHe said when the GCC was dismissed, most of the chiefs chose to remain silent and this should be an indicator of the sensitivity of this issue and the strength of their resolve.\n\nRatu Sakiusa cited a quote from the book ‘20th Century Fiji’ where Stewart Firth wrote, “Men Charles Salvage, David Whippy and Charles Pickering had no desire to convert Fijian, or to change them, or to take charge. They wish to live here, and this meant that they must fit in with the way Fijians did things, speaking the language, obeying Fijian chiefs and accepting the political dominance of the people whose country it is”.\n\nHe added that like those early Europeans we ask the same of everyone now, “that they adapt to Fiji rather than asking that Fiji adapt to them”.\n\nSDL warns interim regime over land\n\n14 FEB 2008\n\nFiji’s former ruling party the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua is warning Finance Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and the interim regime to stay away from land issues.\n\nHis warning comes in light of a report submitted by an India-based consultant to Chaudhry, recommending that all native land be de-reserved.\n\nSDL national director Peceli Kinivuwai told Fijilive land is close to the hearts of indigenous Fijians and must not be touched.\n\n“We will not sit back and see people tamper with our hearts.\n\n“The land is very sacred to us,” he said.\n\n“We don’t care if it brings returns or whatever, we are just telling him to stay away from our land,” he added.\n\nSugar Industry No Longer Backbone of Fiji-Nadroga Chief\n\nwww.fijivillage.com - Publish date/time: 14/02/2008\n\nNadroga high chief, the Ka Levu, Ratu Sakiusa Makutu has today stressed that the sugar industry is no longer the backbone of Fiji's economy.\n\nRatu Sakiusa Makutu has raised concern after revelations that the interim government is considering the proposal from an Indian consultant to de-reserve all the native land to revive the sugar industry.\n\nRatu Sakiusa is questioning Chaudhry which land the interim government is looking for to plant sugar because majority of farmers in the western division do not want to continue with cane farming any more.\n\nThe Ka Levu said Chaudhry should look at the land bought by the Colonial Sugar Refinery to plant sugar from Lautoka to Nadroga which has now been sold to business people. He believes that the industry is failing and they have sold the land for housing purposes and other businesses.\n\nThe Nadroga high chief has reminded Chaudhry about the words of the late politician, SM Koya that Indians will live peacefully in Fiji if they do not touch any issues of land and political leadership.\n\nLaw 'protects' native land\n\nThursday, February 14, 2008\n\nNLTB acting general manager, Meli Benuci+ Enlarge this image\n\nNLTB acting general manager, Meli Benuci\n\nTHE Native Land Trust Board said they would have to get the consent of the majority of landowners before it could de-reserve all native land reserves as proposed by the interim Government.\n\nActing general manager Meli Benuci said the law was quite clear in the control and protection of native land.\n\nMr Benuci said under Section 15(1) of the Native Land Trust Act NLTA, it is lawful for the Board to set aside any portion of native land as a native reserve.\n\n\"In other words, de-reservation of native land cannot be done without the express approval of a majority of landowners concerned,\" he said.\n\nMr Benuci said if 51 per cent of landowners have agreed to the idea, then it will be approved by NLTB.\n\nHe added the NLTB will meet at the end of this month to decide the issue.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has written a letter last month to NLTB proposing the de-reservation of native reserve land for the rehabilitation of sugar cane farming in Fiji. Mr Benuci said they had not responded to the letter and would just await the board's decision at the end of the month.\n\nMeanwhile, Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua Party national director, Peceli Kinivuwai said if the interim regime went ahead with this proposal, then it would spell disaster for the country.\n\n\"If the interim administration is going to go ahead with this de- reserving of native land, then they are looking for trouble,\" Mr Kinivuwai said.\n\n\"The prerogative of any native land belongs to the native landowners once they are consulted by the NLTB.\n\n\"You can't have a third party when it comes to native land,\" he added.\n\nMr Kinivuwai said the interim Finance and Sugar minister is looking for problems like he did in 2000 when he tried to set up the Native Land Use Commission.\n\n\"Now, at the back of a gun, he wants to touch the native land again\n\nFijian Admin team member says they are in the dark\n\nwww.fijivillage.com - 14/02/2008\n\nOne of the members of the Fijian Administration review team led by Colonel Apakuki Kurusiga said they are in the dark over the proposal from a consultant from India, that all native land reserve should be de-reserved.\n\nKalaveti Batibasaga said the interim government should analyze the proposals submitted in the Colonel Kurusiga report on the current Fijian administration system as de-reserving native land for the sugar industry will not fix any problems.\n\nBatibasaga also said the proposal should not even be considered by the interim government.\n\nThe Native Land Trust Board stressed to Village News yesterday that no native land reserves can be de-reserved without the approval of the mataqali.\n\nThis follows revelations that the report by a consultant from India, Doctor M Krishnamurti to the Sugar Ministry, has recommended all native land be de-reserved.

The native reserve is the land set aside for each mataqali for its planting and to support the landowning unit's needs.\n\nThe reserved land is not to be leased out as it is arable land for the mataqali's needs.\n\nDoctor Krishnamurti's report has recommended that the 4 hectare lots for cane farming are uneconomical and 40 to 400 hectare farms are more viable. He also recommends that all investments on the proposed farms be carried out by the lessee and the lease terms be a minimum of 75 years.\n\nNLTB spokesperson, Ro Alipate Mataitini said while the report is just a proposal which will be discussed by the newly formed Committee for Better Utilisation of Land, the NLTB makes it very clear that no native land can be de-reserved without the consent of majority of the landowners.\n\nActing Interim Prime Minister, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau said the issue will be discussed in the next cabinet meeting\n\nChiefs urged to ponder economic survival\n\n14 FEB 2008\n\nFiji’s chiefs and landowners have been urged to consider the future survival of towns in the Western Division if the sugar industry collapsed.\n\nThe Citizens’ Constitutional Forum (CCF) says it is concerned that the report on the Rehabilitation of the Sugar industry is being manipulated again into a racial issue, which are once again over-shadowing serious issues that the report seeks to highlight.\n\n“The report is revealing the reality that the sugar industry, on which about 200,000 people in Fiji depend, is doomed to collapse unless mechanised and large-scale farming is introduced,” CCF chief executive officer, Rev Akuila Yabaki said.\n\nIt was revealed this week that the interim government had earlier asked the Native Land Trust Board to consider a proposal to de-reserve native land by a consultant from India. The proposal is that the de-reserved land be leased to individuals or companies that undertake commercial farming.\n\nThe report was compiled in November last year and submitted to interim Finance Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.\n\nHowever, chiefs and landowners have rejected the proposal saying they will not allow an outsider to suggest the de-reservation of native land.\n\nFor his part, Rev Yabaki says the chiefs and landowners now need to think about what will happen if the sugar industry collapses.\n\n“Will the towns in the West survive? Nadi will survive because it is a tourist town. However, the real danger of a collapse of the sugar industry is that the towns of Lautoka (known as the sugar city), Ba and Rakiraki may collapse.\n\n“We have been seeing the slow decline of the Labasa economy after the closure of many sugar cane farms due to eviction of tenant farmers there.\n\n“Labasa was referred to as a ghost town by many commentators. Tavua town was also badly affected when the Vatukoula gold mine shut down for a few months,” Rev Yabaki said.\n\n“Landowners and chiefs now need to become responsible and make the decision about what they will do if the sugar industry collapses.\n\n“Do they have any alternative crops in mind? If yes, who will farm these crops? What other incentives do they have to encourage people to come and develop their land so that the economy of these towns remain healthy and productive?” Rev Yabaki asked.\n\nHe says the recent census has revealed that Fijians have been leaving the rural areas and settling more in urban centres.\n\nIf the sugar towns in the West collapse, Fijians will face an even bigger problem due to a higher possibility of rural-urban migration, because of a lack of development in their provinces,” Rev Yabaki said."
