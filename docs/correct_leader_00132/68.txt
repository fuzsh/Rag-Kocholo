After a high court ruling said the interim Fijian government is illegal, deposed prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry says he still has the support of the people.

Chaudhry said on Thursday he was confident he could win an election, and that the supporters of a coup that threw him out of office earlier this year are a minority.

The country's high court ruled that Chaudhry and members of his parliament still hold office, but the military-backed interim government says it is still the legitimate government.

It says it will appeal the ruling.

Chaudhry was thrown out of office after rebel leader George Speight led a band of gunmen in a siege of parliament on May 19.

The rebels, backed by a special unit of the army, held Chaudhry and other members of parliament hostage for 56 days.

Speight, a failed businessman, led the revolt to assert the rights of indigenous Fijians over ethnic Indians. Chaudhry is the first ethnic Indian elected prime minister.

Indians make up 44 per cent of the country's 800,000 citizens, and dominate the economy.

Speight is in jail awaiting trial on charges of treason.

Fiji's unions have said they support the court's ruling and welcome the return to a democratically elected government.
