With a large capacity intake of 140 persons for a dinner dance or disco event, this hall is highly suited to social occasions.

Patrons are reminded that there is an additional license fee if alcohol is brought onto the premises.\n\nThere is also a committee room in the Centre that makes an ideal meeting place for local groups or small gatherings. This room can seat up to 10 persons.\n\nKitchen facilities in Westfield Community Centre are of catering standard. This makes this centre an ideal place for inviting external caterers or for simply indulging guests with a hot buffet for your occasion. There is also a fridge available if required.\n\nTransport\n\nWestfield Community Centre is accessible by public transport and a bus stop can be found approximately 30 yards from the centre.
