        "text": "The twenty-first century poses many challenges for the historic house museum in Ontario, big or small, run by a local council or non-profit. These museums are increasingly facing tighter budgets, declining volunteer numbers and higher operating costs. However the twenty-first century is not all bleak for historic house museums, as there are some opportunities for the sector as well. These mainly take the form of filling the increasing tourism demand for the province and a call for greater co-operation between house museums. Inspired by the National Trust of the United Kingdom, this study seeks to analyse and evaluate the management of the historic house museum in Ontario. Additionally, this study will also suggest a National Trust framework adapted to a provincial scale that would better facilitate the growing tourism demand and offer a network of historic house museums. In order to achieve this, new research into the historic house museum and the needs of the museum community was undertaken. This took the form of collecting data on the 110 properties considered in this study and distributing a survey to seventy house museums in the province. The collated results will inform how a National Trust model could be created. By examining four other National Trusts, those of Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Ireland, some of the challenges that confront such and organisation will become evident. It is likely that an Ontario model would similarly face such problems, and so by exploring how these Trusts have addressed these issues will also be beneficial. By working together, the house museums of Ontario should be better equipped to cope with the challenges of the future."
