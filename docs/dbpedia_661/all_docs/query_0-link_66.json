        "text": "January 31 – March 21\n\nThings Made Here: The Glen Faulman Collection\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett, Curator of Contemporary Art at the AGH and Tara Bursey, Independent Curator\n\nGlen Faulman (AKA The Hamilton Kid) is a 10th generation Hamiltonian and a 3rd generation steelworker. He is also part owner of This Ain’t Hollywood on James Street North—needless to say he has great pride in this city, and in particular, the things made here. Glen’s goal is to collect “an artifact from every manufacturing plant that ever operated in Hamilton,” which would be a number approaching a thousand.\n\nOn view at the AGH Design Annex are selections from his extensive collection of objects made in Hamilton. From a late 19th century sewing machine produced at a factory formerly located at James Street North and Vine Street, to a stunning Hamilton cash register made on James Street North at Colbourne, to nail samples and graphic ads for soda pop and beer, these everyday artifacts will be familiar to long-time Hamiltonians. They are a stunning introduction for those less familiar. Three types of objects are on display: graphic designs used commercially, the things themselves that were produced, and the things to make things with, such as nails and other components.\n\nFebruary 28 – May 24\n\nRobert Burley: The Disappearance of Darkness\n\nCurated Dr. Gaëlle Morel, Exhibitions Curator, Ryerson Image Centre\n\nSince 2005, Canadian photographer Robert Burley has documented the demise of film-manufacturing facilities and industrial darkrooms around the world. This exhibition and accompanying publication speak to a historical moment of no return, or what the artist calls “the dizzying moment in photography’s history in which technological changes redefined the medium forever.”\n\nRobert Burley: The Disappearance of Darkness addresses the abrupt breakdown of a century-old industry, which embodies the medium’s material culture. Burley’s large-format colour prints visually record the major economic impact caused by the shift from analogue photography to digital technology. His investigation began when he was granted access to the Kodak Canada plant in Toronto. Following 18 months photographing the desertion, decommissioning and demolition of the facility, he turned to document the international disappearance of manufacturers Agfa-Gevaert, Ilford and Polaroid.\n\nBurley’s project presents the industrial architecture of these facilities with an emphasis on the unique character of the buildings, specifically designed to fabricate products in darkness. As an artist working in photography for the past 30 years, Burley has been both an observer and a participant in this radical transition. As such, his work strikes a subtle balance between the commemoration of the demise of now obsolete materials – film-based photography – and the celebration of cutting-edge visual technology.\n\nFebruary 21 – May 24\n\nOne-Eyed-Rabbit: Jonathan Plante\n\nYoung Gallery\n\nOrganized by VOX, centre de l’image contemporaine\n\nOne-Eyed-Rabbit is different. He has only one eye and would like to jump into his rabbit hole without chipping his teeth… He meets a worm that has no eyes but can navigate through holes in the ground! Together they will discover the power of imagination and the inner workings of sight: a little with the eyes, a lot with the brain, always with the heart.\n\nIn a playful atmosphere and through the story of a friendly rabbit, Montreal artist Jonathan Plante invites young people ages 4 to 10 (and kids of all ages!) to (re)discover the mysteries of visual perception in a variety of ways. The exhibition includes an animated video, original paintings, a giant didactic book, and mirror anamorphoses that will stimulate the imagination of little ones and grownups alike. These unexpected and interactive aesthetic experiences notably address abstraction, art history and optical illusions. Through the various works, viewers are invited to discover the mechanisms of vision and the role it plays in the arts, while developing the imagination.\n\nOne-Eyed-Rabbit is designed and produced by VOX, centre de l’image contemporaine. Jonathan Plante (b. 1976) lives and works in Montreal.\n\nFebruary 28 – May 31\n\nIlluminations: Italian Baroque Masterworks in Canadian Collections\n\nCo-curated by Dr. Benedict Leca, former Director, Curatorial Affairs, Art Gallery of Hamilton and Dr. Devin Therien, AGH Guest Curator\n\nItalian Baroque Art is most often associated with dynamic movement, overwhelmingly-rich colors and compositions, and the creation of new pictorial subjects. The style known as Baroque (c. 1590-1715) was centered in Rome, Naples, and Bologna and subsequently spread to other international cities, including Madrid, Paris, London, and Amsterdam.\n\nIlluminations is the first comprehensive exhibition examining the breadth of Italian Baroque painting in Canadian public collections. Building on the Tanenbaum gift of European art to the Art Gallery of Hamilton, the exhibition explores how light and shadow were central to the creation of dynamic and theatrical pictures. The selected paintings are examined by investigating the artists’ chiaroscuro – the pictorial effects created by light and shade. In contrasting Mattia Preti’s and Jusepe Ribera’s deeply shaded pictures with Luca Giordano’s and Nicolas Poussin’s luminous works, the exhibition reveals how light was strategically used to signify demeanour, emotion or religious symbolism.\n\nThrough a comparison of religious, mythological, and popular imagery, Illuminations simultaneously explores how Baroque audiences were confronted with paintings that broke with tradition by manipulating the conventional use of light. In addition to painting monumental religious imagery, artists also depicted large and theatrically-lit gambling scenes and street concerts. Such paintings emphasize the conflicting aspects of seventeenth-century life, including those between the secular and religious, public and private, and decorous and profane.\n\nFeaturing many of Canada’s foremost Baroque pictures, the exhibition examines a culture – similar to our own – that was captivated by theatrical display.\n\nMay 8 – August 29\n\nThe Painted Page: Book Illustrations by Jacqui Oakley\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett, Curator of Contemporary Art at the AGH\n\nHamilton-based Jacqui Oakley’s painted images have been circulating the globe in such widely recognized publications as The New York Times, Rolling Stone, Penguin Books, National Geographic, Amazon, and most recently as illustrations in re-releases of the complete novels of Jane Austen, Sherlock Holmes and the works of L.M. Montgomery, including Anne of Green Gables.\n\nFeatured at the AGH Design Annex will be selections of Oakley’s original paintings, never-before shown to the public, exhibited alongside the books themselves. Highlighting their contemporary yet nostalgic style, and Oakley’s adept use of mixed media techniques, the exhibition allows us a behind the scenes view into the graphic design process through the presentation of Oakley’s source paintings, works of art in their own right.\n\nJune 26 – January 3 2016\n\nare you experienced?\n\nNadia Belerique, Jessica Eaton, Olafur Eliasson, Dorian FitzGerald, Hadley+Maxwell, Do Ho Suh\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nThe AGH strikes out into our next century with a massive contemporary art exhibition. Bringing together artists from across the globe, the show offers works that appeal to the senses, making a point that an engagement with art can sometimes occur more readily if one does not have preconceived notions of what it should be. In this exhibition, experience creates meaning.\n\nare you experienced? is made up of spectacular installations by six internationally renowned artists: Nadia Belerique, Jessica Eaton, Olafur Eliasson, Dorian FitzGerald, Hadley+Maxwell and Do Ho Suh. Works have been commissioned, made site-specific, and fill large rooms floor-to-ceiling in this sprawling display. The work of Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson is pioneering, driven by his interests in perception, movement, embodied experience, and feelings of self; his work has been exhibited at the Tate Modern and the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Venice Biennale, among many others. Eliasson and the other exhibition artists strive to make the concerns of art relevant to society at large.\n\nThrough immersive and interactive installations, photography, video, painting, sculpture and sound art, the artists engage viewers and invite participation. Familiar objects and images are presented in new contexts, suggesting alternative modes of understanding. The artworks appeal to the viewer’s psychological and intuitive senses, or memory, with the goal of promoting visual and aural awareness and engagement.\n\nThis exhibition is made possible through the international loan of artworks, and never-before-seen works in private collections. It is curated by Melissa Bennett, AGH Curator of Contemporary Art. A fully illustrated 192-page catalogue accompanies the exhibition, with essays by AGH Curator of Contemporary Art Melissa Bennett and invited scholars: Jennifer Fisher and Jim Drobnick, Sally McKay, Gabrielle Moser, Alana Traficante, as well as artist interviews. Published by Black Dog Publishing, London UK.\n\nSeptember 11 – November 21\n\nJaime Angelopoulos: The Incandescence\n\nCurated by the Supercrawl Curatorial Committee\n\nCo-presented by Supercrawl and the Art Gallery of Hamilton\n\nJaime Angelopoulos is a featured Supercrawl artist. Her large abstract and colourful sculptures will be situated on James Street North, commissioned for the festival. The AGH Design Annex will showcase a closer look at her studio practice, including eleven of her mixed media drawings made along the same themes as her sculptural work. Using elementary materials such as oil pastel and conte, the forms she expresses are playful, while full of human gestural characteristics. They seem to emanate an electric charge in their neon brightness, like the definition of Incandescence, one of her works for which the exhibition is titled. Angelopoulos is a Toronto-based artist working in sculpture and drawing. She is represented by Parisian Laundry, Montreal.\n\nJanuary 24 – April 26\n\nThe JUNO Tour of Canadian Art\n\nThe AGH is proud to host the fifth JUNO Tour of Canadian Art exhibition. This year’s exhibition invites JUNO Award nominees and winners to select a work of art on view in Art for a Century: 100 for the 100th that resonates with them personally or artistically. Visit the exhibition and see a video of their response to their favourite artwork.\n\nParticipating artists: Tim Hicks, High Valley, Ian Thornley (Big Wreck), The Tea Party, Tom Wilson and Stephen Fearing of Blackie and the Rodeo Kings and Jill Barber.\n\nJTOCA was previously hosted at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the National Gallery of Canada, the MacKenzie Art Gallery, and the Winnipeg Art Gallery.\n\nThe JUNO Awards wish to thank La Piazza Allegra for their support of this project.\n\nMay 23 – June 21\n\nSAGE: Follow Your Art IX\n\nScholastics, Art, Global Education Program at Strathcona School\n\nJanuary 24 – April 19\n\nJUNO Photography Exhibition\n\nA stunning retrospective photography exhibition showcasing the past 40+ years of Canadian music and the JUNO Awards. More than 50 photos from the JUNO Awards’ 40th Anniversary book, Music from Far and Wide, as well as “never before seen” photos taken by Canada’s foremost rock and roll photographers including Barry Roden, Bruce Cole, Grant Martin, Tom Sandler and photographers from iPhoto Inc.\n\nSeptember 19 – November 29\n\nWomen’s Art Association of Hamilton 119th Annual Juried Exhibition\n\nThe Art Gallery of Hamilton is proud to celebrate the achievements of the Women’s Art Association of Hamilton by presenting their annual juried exhibition. As one of Hamilton’s oldest and most important art associations, WAAH shares longstanding ties with the AGH, going back to the founding of the Gallery more than 100 years ago. The strong relationship between WAAH and the AGH continues through the annual hosting of an exhibition of work by WAAH Members, carefully selected by a jury.\n\nMarch 4 – May 14, 2016\n\nP. Mansaram: 1980s Xerox and Mail Art\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett and Alana Traficante in partnership with Hamilton Artists Inc.\n\nMansaram, also known as Panchal Mansaram, is a Burlington-based artist who was born in Mount Abu, India, in 1934. He immigrated to Canada in 1966, and quickly became friends with Marshall McLuhan, who helped him become oriented in the Toronto and North American cultural scene. Having studied art in India in high school, and then on a fellowship at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam, he brought an eastern style and perspective on the visual arts to his work in Canada. Known for his diverse accomplishments in many styles and media, he has worked in painting, drawing, collage, mixed media and in the changing technologies of the 20th century. His video, film, photography and lasergraphic practice forms a context for his experimentations with Xerography, and mail art.\n\nXerography emerged as a visual arts form in the late 1970s. Like video art, it signalled artists’ desires for diplomatic and accessible new media. Building on his compositional mixed media collage works, Mansaram would spend time photocopying these, often in series, to create new and experimental images. Zooming in and out, adjusting the contrast and other effects, adding cut-outs of type-written lyrical texts, the photocopied images became a visual and poetic exploration for him. He sometimes assembled them as book works, spiral bound or accordion-style, and other times the individual images stood alone. Mansaram was an active participant in the international mail art scene around the same time, which was an association of artists (with headquarters in the U.S.), who had a mailing list set up and would send copies of their artworks to everyone on the list, whether postcards, collages, or Xerox pieces, etc.\n\nOn view at the AGH Design Annex are examples of Mansaram’s Xerography works from the 1980s, along with a display of original Xerography book works, and souvenirs from his mail art practice, including publications that featured his mail art. For the current exhibition he revisited two book works and enlarged the pages anew, presenting them in a serial way. Viewers can engage with the fantastical collage that is the first page and origin work for the series Take a leap into the space, c. 1986; as well as A Maze of Life, c.1986. To create both works, Mansaram used window screening as an essential visual element, as a symbol of the ways in which a view through a window, or any screen such as a TV or computer, may be creatively manipulated. Adding meditative poetic texts throughout, the works indeed remind viewers of McLuhan’s writings on the medium as the message.\n\nThe Art Gallery of Hamilton and Hamilton Artists’ Inc. are proud to present the work of Mansaram, in this exhibition that happens to begin on the day of his 82nd birthday. Mansaram is a long-standing and committed member of the Hamilton and Burlington art scenes, a celebrated former high school art teacher in Burlington, and an astute alumnus of the International Society of Copier Artists, a revolutionary group who advocated for a new type of image-making directly tied to the rapidly changing technologies of the late 20th century.\n\nMelissa Bennett, AGH Curator of Contemporary Art\n\nAlana Traficante, Independent Curator and Administrative Director, Hamilton Artists Inc.\n\nArt Gallery of Hamilton in partnership with Hamilton Artists Inc.\n\nFebruary 1 – March 22\n\nMeryl McMaster: In-Between Worlds\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett and Tara Bursey\n\nIn-Between Worlds explores bi-cultural identities through photographs of a lone figure in the landscape. Identity and myth are intertwined here, in dialogue with the codes of photographic representation. As self-portraits, these images expose the vulnerable subject, inviting viewers to consider themselves as characters in this theatrical yet open-ended narrative. McMaster’s Aboriginal and Euro-Canadian identities have informed this work, wherein she incorporates ideas of liminality. For McMaster, “In-Between Worlds is a sequence of moments that appear out of the ordinary and can be interpreted as being in a state of suspended belief.”\n\nThis exhibition is presented in association with Winterlore, a Hamilton Winterfest exhibition that runs as part of the Winterfest Kick Off event on Saturday February 1st, 3-10 pm at Pier 8. Curated by Tara Bursey, Winterlore features dynamic art installations by ten artists. The works draw on winter folklore, stories and symbols from around the world, in celebration of the diverse cultures of Hamilton.\n\nFebruary 8 – May 4\n\nKim Adams: One for the Road\n\nOrganized and circulated by Museum London\n\nThis exhibition surveys Adams’ 30-year career as an inventor of strange new worlds. An enthusiastic assembler of sculptures made from model parts, bikes, trucks, old appliances and equipment, Adams has exhibited throughout Canada and around the world. He has produced drawings and prints, small models, and huge sculptures that re-envision ideas of home, vehicles, and other machines gone humorously awry.\n\nSome of Adams’ works are eccentric and inviting, while others are almost apocalyptic in vision. They describe possible worlds, alternate aesthetics and potential freedoms. Beyond his unique use of materials, his creations explore what art can be through their presentation. Certain sculptures are intended for public display outside the gallery context, becoming a travelling, interactive spectacle in the city streets. The content and context of his works thus challenge conventional ways of thinking about our values, lifestyles, and sense of community.\n\nAdams won the 2012 Gershon Iskowitz Prize, in recognition of the national and international significance of his body of work. One for the Road includes numerous works from across the breadth of his practice. The exhibition is accompanied by a comprehensive publication on Adams’ work.\n\nFebruary 1 – May 25\n\nTerrors of the Breakfast Table\n\na video installation by Tyler Tekatch\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett, Curator of Contemporary Art\n\nTerrors of the Breakfast Table is an experimental video that invites participation. The story follows a boy on a contemplative journey about life and death. Heavily symbolic, it unfolds in an impressionistic way, with interludes of brilliant cinematography and atmospheric sound. The story is also a dreamscape, as the boy weaves in and out of consciousness, visualizing memories, familiar landscapes, and symbolic environments. The piece ruminates on the elusiveness of the mind and body, and the functions of the body—such as breathing—that seem to be invisible.\n\nIn a confounding exploration of these ideas, Tekatch designed the video installation so that the visitor’s breath causes changes to the visuals and sound. On the table in the gallery space, subtle technologies sense a viewer’s breath, triggering thought-provoking interactive elements. These include a dream montage, the pace of a scene, the ambient sound, and the brightness of the visuals.\n\nTerrors of the Breakfast Table is Tekatch’s first major art installation. An emerging Hamilton-based artist and filmmaker, Tekatch’s work is positioned within global experimental film practices. Using non-linear narrative and a collaged aesthetic approach, his moving image works are visceral and evocative.\n\nThis piece was commissioned within the Interactive Digital Media Incubator program at the Art Gallery of Hamilton, which was made possible with the generous support of the Government of Ontario through the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport and the Museums and Technology Fund.\n\n‘The Making of Terrors of the Breakfast Table’ video shows the behind the scenes details of how Tyler Tekatch and his team created the interactive video installation.\n\nMay 31 – August 30\n\nBrandon Vickerd: Faltering Monuments\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett and Alana Traficante\n\nBrandon Vickerd’s artistic practice includes a range of forms, from sculpture to performance to site-specific interventions, and he frequently explores the myth of progress ingrained in Western world views. With Faltering Monuments, Vickerd subverts a traditional form of commemoration through a contemporary sculptural intervention. He models this series of statues after historically powerful, masculine political figures such Napoleon and Columbus, and then alters the busts by carving out grotesque anatomical elements. In representing figures of modernity, Vickerd highlights nostalgia for the past—a time of rigorous political and scientific pursuit that held great promise for the future. The works disrupt the viewer’s expectations of the monument and invite a dialogue on horror, while exposing the human side of these notable yet fallible characters. Vickerd is a Hamilton-based artist with an extensive exhibition history in North America. He is currently an Associate Professor in the department of Visual Art and Art History at York University.\n\nMay 24 – October 5\n\nInto The Light: The Paintings of William Blair Bruce (1859-1906)\n\nCurated by Tobi Bruce, Senior Curator, Canadian Historical Art\n\nOn Sunday June 28, 1914, the Art Gallery of Hamilton opened its doors for the very first time to great fanfare and expectation: the featured artist was William Blair Bruce. Born and raised in Hamilton, Bruce had died prematurely in 1906, in Stockholm, at the age of 47. His widow, the Swedish artist Caroline Benedicks, his father, William Bruce Senior and his sister Bell Bruce together offered the City of Hamilton a collection of significant paintings by Bruce with the proviso that an art gallery be established. And so was born the AGH. On the occasion of our centennial, we pay tribute to this founding donation, and this significant Canadian painter through the mounting of a major exhibition of his work.\n\nThe exhibition follows the painter from his early days in Hamilton, to Paris, to the French artists’ colonies of Barbizon, Grez-sur-Loing and Giverny, and finally to Sweden where together with Caroline he settled on the island of Gotland in the middle of the Baltic sea, building a magnificent home and studio called Brucebo, which today houses the largest collection of works by both artists.\n\nNumbering 100 works, the Bruce exhibition is the largest ever mounted and includes paintings never before exhibited publically, and related archival material, including photographs and letters, with a view to presenting as full a picture as possible of the artist and his life. A significant publication, with seven independently authored chapters, accompanies the exhibition. Major lenders include the National Gallery of Canada, the National museum (Stockholm), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), and the Terra Foundation for American Art (Chicago). Significantly, we’re pleased to announce that we will be bringing over twenty paintings from Sweden for inclusion in the exhibition, many of which have never-before travelled to Canada.\n\nOne hundred years later, we welcome William Blair Bruce back to Hamilton.\n\nJune 7 – October 5\n\nPainting the Landscape in Nineteenth-Century Europe\n\nCurated by Benedict Leca, Director of Curatorial Affairs\n\nLandscape painting in Europe was reinvented during the course of the nineteenth-century, altered according to shifting definitions of nature in the context of broad social and industrial changes. Modernity brought the advent of the railroads and of tourism into the countryside, of photography, and of such things as the portable colour tube, changing the relation of the artist to nature, and in turn the meaning and value attached to landscape painting.\n\nIf the story is largely centred on French painting, it is one of enduring tropes governing the apprehension of the natural landscape, as well as of received techniques in the painting of it. With the rise of plein air (outdoor painting), objective depiction and the truthfulness to one’s physical response to nature pressured the Academy’s prescribed recipes of spatial arrangement, colour application, or the need for any figurative or narrative element to insert in the landscape. Accordingly, landscapists of all stripes over the course of the century navigated between naturalism and the artifices of painting, closely observing natural phenomena, or else falling back on established tricks of their craft—sometimes in the same work.\n\nThe paintings presented here trace a chronological and stylistic overview of nineteenth-century European landscape painting, illustrating the different modes through which landscape was depicted. From Dutch-infused watery landscapes, to seascapes, to romanticized depictions of specific locales, the arrangement culminates in the light-filled essays and complex colour application of the Impressionists and post-Impressionists.\n\nJune 28 – January 4, 2015\n\nJenn E. Norton: Dredging a Wake\n\nan interactive digital media installation\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett, Curator of Contemporary Art\n\nDredging a Wake activates video art, projections and sculptures in magically interactive ways. Norton’s immersive installation works challenge visual perception, asking viewers to suspend their disbelief via illusionary images that move and reflect in enigmatic ways.\n\nPrecipice is a round room that visitors can enter to find a virtual office space, a projection of swirling water and swimmer circling the perimeter. The swimmer displaces the virtual objects in the room, sweeping them up in the flow of the water, inciting disorientation and synesthesia in the viewer. Doline is an arrangement of mechanical sculptures made from severed office fixtures that turn slowly in a darkened room, to the soundtrack of stories about dreams and the sensation of falling. Doldrums uses mirrors and a projector to experiment with 3D stereoscopic views and an infinite reflection of the viewer.\n\nJenn E. Norton is an early career artist based in Guelph. This is her first major exhibition in a public gallery. She has been described as “a wizard of simple but magical video compositing, creating brilliant collage spaces,” by award-winning filmmaker, curator and critic, Chris Gehman. Her video work has been described as “kinetic, totally charming, magical, [and] emo-conceptual” by Border Crossings art critic Lee Henderson. Her recent works have decidedly delved into the intuitive, imaginative and emotive process of image making.\n\nThis piece was commissioned within the Interactive Digital Media Incubator program at the Art Gallery of Hamilton, which was made possible with the generous support of the Government of Ontario through the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport and the Museums and Technology Fund.\n\nSeptember 12 – November 22\n\nNatalie Hunter: ReVisions\n\nCurated by the Supecrawl Curatorial Committee\n\nCo-presented by Supercrawl\n\nReVisions is a site-specific collage of photographs that explores images, personal memory and storytelling. The camera, which is normally used to capture images of the outside world, is used as an apparatus for reflection on fragmented memories of people, places, and materials. Personal childhood narratives from growing up on the outskirts Hamilton are investigated through the ephemeral nature of motion and light.\n\nNatalie Hunter is a Hamilton-born multidisciplinary artist who works with photography, installation, digital media and sculpture. In 2013 she graduated with an MFA from the University of Waterloo.\n\nNovember 1 – February 8, 2015\n\nThe World is An Apple: The Still Lifes of Paul Cézanne\n\nCurated by Dr. Benedict Leca, Director of Curatorial Affairs\n\nOrganized by Dr. Benedict Leca, the Art Gallery of Hamilton’s Director of Curatorial Affairs, this international loan exhibition opens at the AGH on November 1st 2014 after premiering at the Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia, in June (2014). Comprised of nearly twenty Cézanne masterpieces, in addition to a clutch of works by related artists, The World is An Apple: The Still Lifes of Paul Cézanne charts a thematic and chronological sweep of Cézanne’s still life painting, showing how the ‘Master of Aix’ recast the genre and set it on a new course. Traversing the breadth of his still life production—from early paintings engaging with past masters to very late works unique to him, and treating the range of themes, including apples, flowers and skulls—this select gathering of paintings offers viewers a brief reappraisal of Cézanne’s monumental achievement in this genre.\n\nNovember 1 – February 8, 2015\n\nPainting Hamilton\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett, Curator of Contemporary Art\n\nHamilton has a very rich artists’ scene, and a great number of brilliant painters. On the occasion of the AGH centennial, this exhibition features ten artists from the Greater Hamilton area, many of whom are not well-known, showcasing the diverse subject matter, techniques and materials that are of the moment in contemporary painting practices. Direct from the artist’s studios and local private collections, the exhibition includes over thirty works in landscape, portraiture and abstraction. From lush oil paintings to a sculptural installation, the range of media, form and scale is intriguing. However the psychological weight of the subject matter prevails, as it is activated by the materials. Whether an intimate portrayal of a model, or an intuitive and gestural expression of the environment, the pieces are captivating, powerful, and impressive for their ability to engage the viewer on a subconscious level. Featured artists are Jennifer Carvalho, Catherine Gibbon, David Hucal, Daniel Hutchinson, Charles Meanwell, Matthew Schofield, Christina Sealey, Beth Stuart, Lorne Toews and Manny Trinh.\n\nMarch 1 – February 22, 2015\n\nArt for a Century: 100 for the 100th\n\nCurated by Dr. Benedict Leca, Tobi Bruce and Melissa Bennett\n\nWhile the AGH Centennial celebrates the people, spaces and activities that have made the Gallery one of the most dynamic independent art museums in Canada, we should never lose sight of its prized permanent collection, which we hold in trust for the people of Hamilton. As the foundational treasure that propels our enterprise as a museum, the collection ranks among the finest in Canada.\n\nWhat began 100 years ago with the donation of 29 paintings in memory of Hamilton-born artist, William Blair Bruce, now numbers 10,000 works. While other ‘encyclopedic’ museums present a broader range of objects, the specificity and depth of the AGH collection in three core areas—Canadian historical, Canadian and global contemporary, and European art—are its strength.\n\nArt for a Century: 100 for the 100th, which gathers selected masterpieces from the permanent collection chosen by Dr. Benedict Leca, Director, Curatorial Affairs, Tobi Bruce, Senior Curator of Canadian Historical Art and Melissa Bennett, Curator of Contemporary Art, exemplifies the sustained level of quality of the three collections. From late 19th-century landscapes to masterworks from the Group of Seven, from Baroque masterpieces of Dutch and Italian art to important French 19th-century academic painting, from a full offering of contemporary art of the last decades to a rich selection of African material, the AGH collection covers these significant domains with distinction.\n\nThe works presented in this exhibition are arranged to suggest occasional formal or thematic resonances. The display occupying the entire second floor is an invitation to our Members and visitors to wander, discover, and contemplate anew the treasures that will continue to enlighten for the next 100 years and beyond.\n\nMay 3 – June 22\n\nSAGE: Follow Your Art VIII\n\nArtwork created by students from senior kindergarten through grade five from the SAGE (scholastic, art, global education program) at Strathcona School will be presented in this exhibition, which is a culmination of a series of visits during the school year. Each student has selected one work from their portfolio that they consider their best.\n\nMarch 8 – April 27\n\nWomen’s Art Association of Hamilton 118th Annual Juried Exhibition\n\nIt is entirely fitting that on the occasion of the Art Gallery of Hamilton’s centennial we should celebrate the achievements of the Women’s Art Association of Hamilton through their annual juried exhibition. As one of Hamilton’s oldest and most important art associations, the WAAH shares longstanding ties with the AGH and indeed played an important role in the founding of our institution one hundred years ago. The strong relationship between WAAH and the AGH continues through the annual hosting of an exhibition of work by WAAH Members, carefully selected by a jury. This popular exhibition is an important means through which the AGH celebrates its longstanding relationship with the WAAH, and we are very pleased to present the 118th annual exhibition in this, our centennial year.\n\nJanuary 28 – April 29\n\nWilliam Kurelek | The Messenger\n\nThe exhibition, a partnership between the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria, Art Gallery of Hamilton and the Winnipeg Art Gallery, is curated by Mary Jo Hughes, Tobi Bruce, and Andrew Kear.\n\nThroughout a career that spanned from mid-1950s until his death, William Kurelek (1927-1977) and his art have meant many different things to many people. The Alberta-born, Manitoba-raised artist was a painter of innocence and fun, his scenes reminiscences of a simpler and timeless past. He was also a chronicler of the experiences of various cultural groups in Canada, devoting entire series to Ukrainian, Jewish, Polish, Irish, French Canadian, and Inuit peoples. Then there is Kurelek the anguished prophet of a modern apocalypse, his art an indictment of the secular age and a testament to unwavering faith.\n\nAn important and unique aspect of this exhibition for Canadian audiences will be the inclusion of several works from Kurelek’s highly formative period in England from 1952 to 1959. During this time the young artist underwent psychiatric treatment and converted to Roman Catholicism, which profoundly altered his subsequent approach to life and art making. It is in consideration of these early works that the exhibition reveals Kurelek’s complex psyche and the central role it played in everything he produced.\n\nAs the first large-scale survey of William Kurelek in thirty years, The Messenger seeks to bring together the most important and engaging works executed by the artist during his career. The exhibition opens at the Winnipeg Art Gallery in September 2011 and will travel to Hamilton early next year before its final showing in Victoria during the summer of 2012. This exhibition includes over 80 paintings that encompass the artist’s entire practice. The works are drawn from major private, corporate, and public collections in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. A major publication will be available in September 2011.\n\nVisit www.kurelek.ca for more information. This project is generously funded by the Canadian Government through the Department of Canadian Heritage Museums Assistance Program.\n\nJanuary 14 – May 21\n\nKristin Bjornerud: Safe Harbour\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nKristin Bjornerud’s lyrical watercolours convey myths and legends, dreams and superstitions. This exhibition features recent works including several made during a residency on the island of Gotland, Sweden in 2010 as winner of the Brucebo Fine Art Foundation scholarship, which is juried in part by the Art Gallery of Hamilton. The Foundation was established by William Blair Bruce, a celebrated Hamilton painter of the turn of the 20th century, and his Swedish-born wife, artist Caroline Benedicks Bruce to support young, emerging artists.\n\nDuring her summer residency, Bjornerud’s immersion in Gotland’s fabled history and mythological atmosphere had great influence on her works, and she incorporated her usual set of female characters drawn from life experiences. The paintings show scenes of women in tableaux, often in a mode of creation or peculiar activity–whether in Making the Land which shows a woman knitting a large textile piece that flows out like a landscape from her lap; or in A Long View, where a woman gazes out at sea, and her view is captured in a surrealistic manner. Bjornerud’s scenes are playful, laden with references to women as producers, and to fables intertwined with historic events.\n\nThe artist wishes to acknowledge the generous support of the Canada Council for the Arts and the Ontario Arts Council.\n\nJanuary 14 – May 21\n\nMark Lewis: Rush Hour, Morning and Evening, Cheapside\n\nOrganized and circulated by the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, as part of the MOMENTUM series\n\nRush Hour, Morning and Evening, Cheapside (2005), a film work from the Collection of the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, captures the moving shadows of pedestrians in the slanting light of morning and end of day when the sun, low in the sky, stretches silhouettes magnificently along the ground. By simply inverting the image, Mark Lewis composes a never-ending rush hour, with early morning perambulations sweeping past in continuous movement, right to the “golden hour” that precedes sunset.\n\nThe MOMENTUM series touring project has been made possible with the support of the Department of Canadian Heritage through its Museums Assistance Program.\n\nJanuary 14 – May 21\n\nMark Lewis: Forte!\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nForte! (2010) was filmed as the artist flew over the Italian Alps and a Napoleonic fort. This film will be shown in the Kate and Robert Steiner gallery, complementing Mark Lewis’s film on view in the Southam gallery.\n\nBorn in Hamilton, Ontario, Mark Lewis is now based in London, England. His work has been shown widely around the world to enthusiastic notices, particularly for his contribution to the 2009 Venice Biennale of Visual Art where he represented Canada. In 2007 he was the winner of the inaugural Gershon Iskowitz Prize.\n\nMay 19 – September 9\n\nBy Popular Demand\n\nCurated by Tobi Bruce\n\nAs a lead-in to the installation of Alex Colville’s Horse and Train (by far the most requested work in the AGH collection), By Popular Demand presents not only paintings and sculpture that have become known and favored over time, but also artists whose names have captured a singular and recognizable place in mainstream popular culture.\n\nMasterwork, icon, and treasure are all words repeatedly used to define the singular and the memorable in art. But what is it about certain works that enables them to break away from the crowd? How does an artist’s name move into the mainstream? Is it a question of perceived quality? Timing? Style? Impact? Familiarity? While works are created in the private realm of the studio, their subsequent public lives—in essence their legacies—are subject to circumstances and factors that define them in a both expected and unexpected ways. The exhibition will include works by Lawren Harris, Tom Thomson, Cornelius Krieghoff, Auguste Rodin, Joe Fafard, and Emily Carr, among many others.\n\nCorporate Members: Fengate Capital Management, Pioneer Energy.\n\nMay 19 – September 9\n\nAnselm Kiefer\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nIn 2012, the AGH is presenting solo exhibitions of acclaimed artists whose works represent a singular recognizable vision. On view are three of Anselm Kiefer’s large mixed media paintings, which are unparalleled in their powerful content, negotiating the cultural residue of WWII. Kiefer has become well-known internationally for his highly textured paintings such as those on view here. Symbolic meaning is embedded throughout these pieces in his use of natural materials, numbers and text. Des Herbstes Runengespinst / The Web of Autumn Runes (2003) depicts a desolate landscape that may be interpreted as a charred battlefield, conceivably a site to be memorialized. Himmel Auf Erden / Heaven on Earth (1998) suggests a complex relationship between land, memory and spirituality. Karfunkelfee (2007) refers to a mythical fairy character while it incorporates ambiguous spiritual and geological symbols.\n\nBorn in 1945 in Germany, Kiefer studied art informally under Joseph Beuys at the Düsseldorf Academy in the early 1970s. His work has been exhibited in and is collected by major international museums. He lives and works in France.\n\nThe Art Gallery of Hamilton would like to thank Dr. Stephen Seltzer and Dr. Stuart Seltzer, as well as a private collector whose generous loans have made this exhibition possible, and Galerie Samuel Lallouz.\n\nJune 7 – September 23\n\nValérie Blass\n\nOrganized by the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal\n\nCurated by Lesley Johnstone, MACM Curator\n\nEmploying virtually every sculptural technique—from moulding, casting, carving and modelling to assemblage and bricolage—Valérie Blass explores the territories between animal, human and inanimate forms, creating strange, hybrid objects. The impact of Blass’s work resides in the anachronistic way she navigates between two sculptural traditions. She makes free-standing, vertical, handmade, human-scale autonomous pieces that locate her squarely within the classical tradition of figurative sculpture. But the diversity of her materials and the plethora of mass-produced, bought and found objects she uses, stemming from an enthusiastic engagement with the material culture of the twenty-first century, anchor her art in assemblage and bricolage. A major publication accompanies the exhibition.\n\nBorn in 1967, Valérie Blass lives in Montréal. She holds a Master’s degree in Visual and Media arts from the Université du Québec à Montréal. In addition to participating in the first Québec Triennial mounted by the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal, she has had solo exhibitions at Parisian Laundry and the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art. She has taken part in group exhibitions organized by the National Gallery of Canada, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec and the Power Plant. She is currently participating in the exhibition Oh, Canada at MASS MoCA. Valérie Blass is represented by Parisian Laundry.\n\nMay 12 – October 28\n\nNature and Spirit: Emily Carr’s Coastal Landscapes\n\nOrganized and circulated by the Vancouver Art Gallery\n\nCurated by Ian Thom, Senior Curator, Historical, Vancouver Art Gallery\n\nBefore her death in 1945, Emily Carr’s sizeable reputation as an artist, writer and creative innovator was nationally recognized with solo exhibitions, award winning publications and the admiration of her peers. In recent years Carr has gained international renown for her paintings and has been increasingly celebrated as a singular figure in Canadian culture.\n\nA significant touring exhibition of works by Emily Carr, Nature and Spirit traces her evolution as an artist and includes many of the painter’s recognized masterpieces. The works span Carr’s early experiments with European modernism, to her powerful first encounters with Canadian First Nations art and culture, through her mature landscapes, to a final series of works from the period 1940-1942 when she returned to First Nations subjects.\n\nHighlights of the exhibition can be seen in Carr’s early translations of European ideas to a Canadian context in a superb series of paintings made in 1912, including Totem Poles, Kitseukla. The major works of her maturity such as Zunoqua of the Cat Village, Big Raven, and The Little Pine form the central section of the exhibition and are complemented by a series of oil on paper works from the 1930s. These remarkably free studies of the landscape were painted directly from life and illustrate a more expressive and fluid style than in her works on canvas.\n\nFinally, the exhibition presents a series of paintings from 1940-1942 when the artist returned to First Nations subjects with a new confidence and strength. Carr’s paintings from this period celebrate nature and landscape as living entities and convey her profound identification with the land of her birth.\n\nJune 30 – January 27, 2013\n\nFresh Meet\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett and Tobi Bruce\n\nThe AGH is the fortunate recipient of many gifts of art. Special donations and grants also allow us to make important purchases. This exhibition highlights our recent acquisitions of historical and contemporary art, revealing the collecting mandate of the gallery, as well as the tastes of our local, regional and national donors. Collecting decisions are governed by the AGH Acquisitions Committee as well as curatorial staff, and together we are pleased to offer the public a first viewing of some of our most exciting and engaging new works.\n\nWorks by local, national and international artists, including Fiona Kinsella, David Milne, Joseph Hartman, John Hartman, Katherine MacDonald, Eldon Garnet, Anne Savage, Frederick Verner, Leon Kroll, Claude Tousignant, David Merritt, and Louis de Niverville make for a fascinating and varied presentation of art past and present, and serve to give an essence of how the permanent collection has been enriched in recent years.\n\nNovember 18 – April 21, 2013\n\nJean-Antoine Houdon: Flayed Man\n\nThe “living cadaver” might at first glance seem horrifically bizarre. In fact, it continues the tradition of anatomical study that became a cornerstone of artistic training during the Renaissance. The exceptional accuracy of the figure prompted art academies around the world to order plaster casts of it from the artist, bringing the work into the ranks of the revered antique statues, casts of which formed the basis of artistic training.\n\nThe oldest sculpture in the Tanenbaum Collection, this Écorché or Flayed Man was an early work by Houdon, France’s greatest Neoclassical sculptor. Houdon created it while he was a Prix de Rome student at the French Academy in Rome during the 1760s, and later used the same skill at precise observation in bust-length portraits—such as that of Napoleon at the entrance to the main galleries—that would make him famous.\n\nOctober 13 – April 28, 2013\n\nZidane, A 21st-Century Portrait, Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno\n\nOrganized by the National Gallery of Canada\n\nZinédine Zidane was a member of the French national soccer team that won both the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the Euro 2000 Championship. In Zidane, A 21st Century Portrait, internationally renowned artists Douglas Gordon (b. Glasgow, Scotland, 1966) and Philippe Parreno (b. Oran, Algeria, 1964) have deployed contemporary conventions of mass media both to “paint” a portrait of the soccer star, and to portray our cultural creation of, and fascination with, heroes and icons.\n\nThis contemporary portrait of Zinédine Zidane was filmed during a championship match between Real Madrid and Villarreal on 23 April 2005. The artists positioned seventeen cameras throughout Madrid’s Santiago Bernabéu stadium and directed a team of camera operators to remain fixed on the French soccer star throughout the entire match. This installation juxtaposes a film composed of footage from all seventeen cameras with the raw footage from camera number one. Zidane’s image is projected larger than life so that his every gesture and expression are emphasized. The soundtrack shuttles the viewer between the sounds of the game and an ethereal, introspective space, creating a radically different experience of both soccer and portraiture. Zidane is highly experimental as a portrait, as cinema and as soccer, fusing familiar mediums and genres to produce a radically different experience of spectatorship.\n\nNovember 10 – May 5, 2013\n\nThe Eye of Napoléon\n\nOrganized by Exhibits Development Group, USA, in cooperation with the Chalençon Collection, Paris, France.\n\nFor all of his military exploits as the great conqueror of modern times, Napoléon was equally astute as a cultural imperialist, bringing French art and industry to a new flowering that aimed to surpass the achievements of antiquity while serving to cement his power and advance his geopolitical ambitions. Drawn from the Chalençon Collection (Paris, France), perhaps the world’s foremost private collection of Napoléonic material, The Eye of Napoléon presents some 200 rare objects that together provide insight into Napoléon’s aesthetic interests, private life, and the remarkable achievement of French painters, draftsmen, and decorative artists working in the Empire Style.\n\nThe exhibition’s exceptional quality and range of materials and techniques demonstrates how Napoléon nurtured and harnessed the glories of French art and craftsmanship, always with a special understanding of how things would be interpreted out in the world. From the period’s most renowned artists—painters such as Antoine-Jean Gros and Jean-Baptiste Regnault, and sculptors Jean-Antoine Houdon and Antonio Canova—Napoléon commissioned signal works that imaged the pomp of his reign and diffused his likeness, while gesturing to the cultural authority of the antique. Recalling from his readings in history that every great ruler pervaded an era, Napoléon likewise sought to impress his mark on every domain of the decorative arts, exemplified in the exhibition through magnificent examples of Sèvres porcelain, jewellery and elaborate personal effects.\n\nAlso featuring personal items, including Napoléon’s hat, snuffbox and collapsible campaign bed, the exhibition affords us a glimpse of Napoléon the man and functions as an object lesson on how the things with which we surround ourselves define our public identity.\n\nAugust 25 – June 30, 2013\n\nRhonda Weppler and Trevor Mahovsky: The Searchers\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nThe Searchers is a startling new installation in the David Braley and Nancy Gordon Sculpture Atrium. Perched upon a high ledge, these five contemporary sculptures modeled after everyday youths look down upon visitors, activating the relationship between object and viewer. Referencing street culture, film, architecture and the occupation of public space, the figures have an enigmatic presence. The works take their title from John Ford’s classic western film wherein male figures are often juxtaposed against an expansive sky. In contrast, these sculptures are seated, decidedly loitering and assessing the scene at once.\n\nRhonda Weppler (born in Winnipeg) and Trevor Mahovsky (born in Calgary) are collaborative artists based in San Francisco and Vancouver. Their work is featured in two Toronto venues this fall: a solo exhibition at Pari Nadimi Gallery, and an installation at Scotiabank Nuit Blanche on September 29, 2012.\n\nFebruary 4 – May 13\n\nWomen’s Art Association of Hamilton 116th Annual Juried Exhibition\n\nFounded in 1894, the Women’s Art Association is one of Hamilton’s oldest and most important art associations. Ties between the WAAH and the Art Gallery of Hamilton are formative and longstanding, stemming back to the formation of the AGH in 1914, in part through the tireless efforts of early WAAH members. The strong relationship between our organizations continues through the Gallery’s presentation of the WAAH’s annual juried exhibition. A favourite with the public, the selection of works by jury is always a great mix of works by seasoned exhibitors and newcomers alike. 2012 will mark the WAAH’s 116th annual exhibition; an extraordinary record by any measure.\n\nMay 18 – June 17\n\nSAGE: Follow Your Art VI\n\nCelebrating an on-going partnership between the SAGE program at Strathcona School and the Art Gallery of Hamilton, this exhibition of student work is the result of an intensive program of tours and hands-on studio activities that took place at the Gallery in through the school year of 2011-12. Over the course of 5 visits for students from senior kindergarten to grade 5, our young artists explored the beauty of quilts and photographs, the narrative message of William Kurelek and the wonder of Emily Carr’s landscape paintings. In this exhibition we see the results of the year’s journey. From the exuberance of the kindergarten and grade one classes that embrace every activity with joy and fun to the creative and imaginative vision of the two’s and three’s though to the growing talents of the four’s and five’s, the SAGE program has once again offered a fantastic exhibition for us to enjoy.\n\nJune 23 – July 22\n\nCelebrating the Artist: Earl Kitchener\n\nIn a new partnership, the AGH was thrilled to welcome eight classes from Earl Kitchener into the intensive school program. Each student visited the Gallery on five different occasions throughout the school year, spending time with individual exhibitions and artworks to discover the stories hidden in the works, and the special techniques that each of the artists used to achieve their individual masterpieces. In the studio, students took inspiration from the art that they saw in the gallery and used it to create masterpieces of their own. This exhibition offers us the best of each young artist. All of the works on display were created at the AGH, and reveal the talents and passions the students.\n\nJuly 28 – October 14\n\nOctober 20 – February 10, 2013\n\nHamilton Port Authority: A Century in Pictures\n\nThe Hamilton Port Authority (HPA) is celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2012, marking a century of maritime commerce in the city. The HPA holds an extensive archive of photographs, collected since its early days. This anniversary milestone is an ideal opportunity to share the images and connect with the public’s experience of the harbour and port, which are so vital to Hamilton. Leading up to the exhibition, members of the public are invited to submit their own photographs taken around the harbour, to be included in the display. This exhibition of archival photographs will engage visitors in the many wondrous facets of port life as it has changed over the past century. Visit www.hamiltonport.ca.\n\nApril 28 – September 3\n\nPlaces We Call Home: Mohawk College Student Renderings of Ontario Buildings\n\nOrganized by Shannon Kyles\n\nWhile studying the History of Architecture, the students of Mohawk College’s Architectural Technician, Technology and Building Renovation programs went across Ontario to draw homes, churches, civic and commercial buildings that illustrate the diversity of architectural styles. Instructor Shannon Kyles asked her students to submit their drawings to a competition judged by local architecture and art experts Anthony Butler, Graham Crawford, Robert Hamilton, Craig Simms, and Drew Skuce. The winning drawings, produced in traditional and electronic methods, will be displayed.\n\nSimon Frank View (from the escarpment)\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nSimon Frank’s site-specific installation in the AGH foyer is a large monochromatic abstraction created by the physical destruction of the museum wall. By hammering into the drywall with a traditional log-marking tool, he symbolically investigates the history of industries such as logging, exploring their cultural and environmental impacts. Frank often incorporates the landscape in his works, frequently as the result of performative actions. In this way, he highlights the relationship between people, their labour and nature.\n\nJanuary 15 – May 8\n\nGreat Masters Series: Matisse – The Colour of JAZZ\n\nGreat Masters Series: Miserere – Rouault’s Rhapsody to Suffering\n\nCurated by Dr. Patrick Shaw Cable\n\nUshering in the Gallery’s 2011 French Connection year are adjacent exhibitions of central print series from the careers of two of France’s great twentieth-century modernists. Published respectively in 1947 and 1948, Jazz by Henri Matisse (1869–1954) and Miserere by Georges Rouault (1871–1958) complement one another through their fundamental contrasts of sentiment and style. Next to the black-and-white expressionism and sombre mood of Rouault stand out the brilliant colour forms and joie de vivre of Matisse.\n\nBoth artists appeared on the Parisian scene through their association in 1905 with Fauvism, the first avant-garde movement of the twentieth century. Yet each man possessed and developed his singular vision — Rouault with an uncommon devotion to religious themes in a secular age — Matisse with a colour sensibility that would make him the greatest French painter of the twentieth century.\n\nRouault’s Miserere (Latin for “Have mercy”) represents his most sustained meditation on death; he executed the plates for his epic series during and after World War I, using a rich variety of print techniques to arrive at heavy images of Christ and ordinary sufferers. Matisse’s Jazz was composed of crystallized memories of circus, tales, and travels; this seminal creation was the artist’s first major project using the painted paper cut-out, which became his dominant mode of expression in the last decade of his life.\n\nThese mutually enriching exhibitions provide a rare opportunity to view Rouault’s and Matisse’s prints, which usually remain in storage due to their special conservation needs. While Rouault’s work was gifted to the Gallery in 1985 by the important Canadian arts benefactor Walter A. Carsen, Matisse’s Jazz comes to us on generous temporary loan from Hamilton’s McMaster Museum of Art.\n\nJanuary 22 – May 8\n\nEugène Carrière: Shadow and Substance\n\nOrganized and circulated by Landau Traveling Exhibitions, Los Angeles, California\n\nEugène Carrière (1849–1906), whose painting was described by a contemporary as reality having the magic of dreams, was an important French exponent of the late-nineteenth-century visionary Symbolist movement. He possessed close ties to other French artists associated with Symbolism, such as Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and the sculptor Auguste Rodin, with whom he helped to found the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1890.\n\nWhile the world’s largest public collection of work by Carrière is to be found in Paris’s prestigious Musée d’Orsay, the most comprehensive private collection is the one assembled by Dr. Nick Vlachos in Bloomington, Illinois. The current exhibition features the most important works from this outstanding personal collection, ranging from portraits and images of mothers and children to figure studies and landscapes.\n\nShadow and Substance foregrounds the technical and thematic originality of Carrière’s brand of Symbolism. The painter focused on family members and intimates as a microcosm of the larger brotherhood of mankind, portraying them as universal figures against formless environments. Similarly, he developed a unique style characterized by a monochromatic brown palette, extremely soft-focus contours, and atmospheric effects, which grew from his interest in building up his paintings with subtle light effects and from his spiritualist belief in creation as an ongoing process emanating from fundamental forces.\n\nComplementing the Vlachos collection will be the handful of Carrière paintings the AGH holds in its Tanenbaum Collection, including the masterful allegory of the art of painting — La Peinture (c. 1899) — which the Gallery loaned in 2006 to Tokyo and Paris for a major exhibition devoted to the crossovers between Carrière and his friend the sculptor Rodin.\n\nFebruary 5 – May 22\n\nVidéoStudio: New Work from France\n\nCurated by Thomas J. Lax and organized by The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York\n\nVidéoStudio: New Work from France is a video exhibition organized by The Studio Museum in Harlem, and curated by Thomas J. Lax. It presents the work of three North African artists — Yto Barrada, Bouchra Khalili and Djamel Kokene — who were born or currently live in France. While these artists emerge from a specifically Afro-European context, the exhibition brings together work that considers “France” — and the very idea of the nation — as a concept rather than a stable category. Each artist reinterprets techniques drawn from artistic genres including guerilla theater, documentary film and narrative storytelling. Together these works encourage viewers to consider the relationship between individuals and the state; culture and the law; and identity and modes of representation.\n\nVidéoStudio: New Work from France rassemble l’œuvre de trois artistes — Yto Barrada, Bouchra Khalili et Djamel Kokene — qui tous trois sont engagés dans une réflexion sur une esthétique de l’errance. Si chacun de ces artistes a travaillé à la fois en France et au Maghreb, dans leurs travaux, la géographie représente une ressource conceptuelle, qui prend pour point de départ les limites de l’appartenance nationale. La «France» décrite ici, est cet espace entre deux, délimitant une définition de l’art dans le contexte de l’identité nationale, tout en mettant en crise cette approche. Plutôt que d’être le simple point commun de leur travail, l’exil définit ici une esthétique en mouvement, qui investit un interstice aux limites de la loi.\n\nVidéoStudio: New Work from France is organized by The Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; studiomuseum.org.\n\nFebruary 5 – May 22\n\nDiane Landry: The Defibrillators\n\nCurated by Eve-Lyne Beaudry and produced by the Musée d’art de Joliette\n\nThe Defibrillators is a travelling retrospective exhibition of works created over the last ten years by Diane Landry, a leading figure in Québec contemporary art. This exhibition reveals her innovative approach to art-making. Landry takes her inspiration from the world around her to create playful environments that plunge the visitor into an experience of sights, sounds and emotions. She recycles, transforms, manipulates and falsifies everyday objects, wrenching them from their original function to imbue them with a new kind of poetry. Incorporating into her works the time-based element of performance and the spatial dimension of installation and kinetic art, this multi-disciplinary artist seeks to destabilize viewers, stimulating in them a new perception of familiar objects.\n\nBorn in Cap-de-la-Madeleine, Diane Landry lives and works in Québec City. In addition to the many awards she has won throughout her career, she recently became the first recipient of the Giverny Capital Prize, granted for excellence in present-day art in Québec.\n\nDiane Landry: The Defibrillators is curated by Eve-Lyne Beaudry, and is produced by the Musée d’art de Joliette. An exhibition catalogue is co-published by the MAJ and the Robert McLaughlin Gallery.\n\nLes défibrillateurs est une exposition rétrospective itinérante regroupant des oeuvres de Diane Landry créées au cours des dix dernières années. Premier regard rétrospectif sur la production de cette figure majeure de l’art contemporain au Québec, cette exposition met de l’avant toute la pertinence de son travail et de sa démarche artistique.\n\nDiane Landry s’inspire de tout ce qui l’entoure pour créer des environnements ludiques, plongeant le spectateur au coeur d’une expérience à la fois visuelle, sonore et émotionnelle. À travers ses oeuvres, elle recycle, manipule et transforme les objets de notre quotidien, les détournant de leur fonction première pour leur insuffler une poésie nouvelle. Intégrant à ses oeuvres l’aspect temporel de la performance et l’aspect spatial de l’installation, cette artiste multidisciplinaire cherche à déstabiliser le spectateur et à provoquer chez lui une perception différente de ce qui lui est familier.\n\nNative du Cap-de-la-Madeleine, Diane Landry vit et travaille à Québec. En plus des nombreux prix qu’elle a reçus tout au long de sa carrière, elle est récemment devenue la première lauréate du prix Giverny Capital, prix qui souligne l’excellence dans l’art actuel au Québec.\n\nEve-Lyne Beaudry, conservatrice adjointe au Musée d’art de Joliette, assure le commissariat de l’exposition Les défibrillateurs, produite et mise en circulation par le Musée d’art de Joliette. Un catalogue monographique a été réalisé par le MAJ et la Robert McLaughlin Gallery d’Oshawa.\n\nApril 30 – August 14\n\nBrendan Fernandes: New Video Acquisitions\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nFollowing Brendan Fernandes’ AGH exhibition until we fearless last year, the Gallery acquired two of his video works, Foe (2008) and Performing Foe (2009). This purchase was made possible with the generous support of Pierre Karch and Mariel O’Neill-Karch, with matching funds from the Canada Council for the Arts Acquisition Assistance for Art Museums and Public Galleries program.\n\nIn his works, Fernandes often explores the topics of post-colonialism and identity in globalized cultures. In Foe and Performing Foe, the artist examines the ways in which one learns to speak in a culturally specific way. In Foe, we hear an off-screen acting coach teach Fernandes how to enunciate in the “accents” of his cultural backgrounds, and we see him struggle to imitate these nuanced words. The script is taken from the book “Foe” which is a sequel to “Robinson Crusoe.” Fernandes reads the section wherein Friday (the savage) has been mutilated; his tongue has been removed and he cannot speak. Fernandes then takes on the role of teacher to a group of students in Performing Foe, leading them in the same lessons of pronunciation. These pieces play on the notion of pedagogy through mimicry and disguise; Fernandes’ interests are not in the authenticity of these accents but in the idea of being taught to speak in these voices. He asks the viewer to consider the ways in which language and culture are acquired and communicated.\n\nMay 21 – September 5\n\nThe French Connection\n\nCurated by Dr. Patrick Shaw Cable and Tobi Bruce\n\nFor Canadian artists working in the last quarter of the 19th century, the lure of Paris was irresistible. With its teaching and exhibition opportunities, international artists flocked to the City of Lights in search of education and artistic validation. Indeed, during this period, an extended stay in Paris became an artistic rite of passage, with increasing numbers of Canadians boarding steamships to make their way across the Atlantic to pit their talents against the very best. In Paris, both emerging and mature artists found themselves in a vibrant and experimental artistic culture, unparalleled in the Western world.\n\nThis exhibition explores the essence of the French experience for Canadian artists and how it manifested itself in their work and thinking, alongside work by their French masters such as Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904) and Jean-Paul Laurens (1838–1921). A central theme of the exhibition is a consideration of the annual Paris Salons, acceptance to which was considered the very apogee of one’s training in Paris. As such, The French Connection brings together works exhibited by Canadian artists at these pivotal exhibitions by such artists as Paul Peel (1860– 1892), Maurice Cullen (1866 – 1934), William Blair Bruce (1859–1906), George Reid (1860–1947), Laura Muntz (1860 – 1930) and Sophie Pemberton (1869–1959), among others.\n\nThis exhibition is funded in part by the Canadian Government through the Department of Canadian Heritage Museums Assistance Program.\n\nMay 21 – September 5\n\nElegant Verve: Modern French Graphics from the Collection\n\nCurated by Tara Ng, Curatorial Intern, with Dr. Patrick Shaw Cable\n\nComprising a selection of prints, drawings, and sketches, Elegant Verve: Modern French Graphics from the Collection captures the vibrant spirit of graphic art by the French avant-garde in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The latter half of the nineteenth century marked the beginning of an unprecedented degree of exploration in graphic media, giving rise to the rich diversity and originality that has distinguished French prints of the past two centuries.\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, realism was championed by such artists as Honoré Daumier and Édouard Manet. Daumier’s satirical depictions of bourgeois society in his lithographs for the Parisian newspaper Le Charivari reveal not only his delightful wit but also his uncompromising honesty. While lithography thrived in commercial applications, etching experienced a revival among realist painters. Etching became an important medium for Manet, and it served as the means through which he explored a wide spectrum of styles, ranging from the naïve to the naturalistic.\n\nFrom a slightly later period, brisk contour lines capture the graceful movement of the human form in the etchings of the Impressionist artist Renoir. As exemplified in The Three Bathers (1894), the Nabi artist Vallotton took advantage of the woodcut to produce broad sections of boldly defined forms. Other featured artists from this period include Tissot, Seurat, Vuillard, and Bonnard.\n\nOwing to masters such as Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Léger, Arp, and Bourgeois, graphic media continued to demonstrate great vitality in the modern art movements of the twentieth century, from Cubism to Surrealism and beyond. Picasso’s simplified organic contours, Chagall’s thick expressive lines, and Bourgeois’s rhythmically undulating forms attest to the enduring freedom of expression in the graphic arts of France.\n\nJune 9 – September 25\n\nPeter Karuna: All in Good Time\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nPeter Karuna is a Hamilton-based visual artist working with photography, video, sculpture and installation art. This exhibition of photographs shows the range of his practice over the last forty-five years, since he began working as a press photographer in London, England, at the age of sixteen. Many of his images are candid—they arrest rare moments when things ironic or beautiful align. Pictured here are scenes in London, England, Marseille, France, and Hamilton and surrounding areas. Karuna’s longstanding commitment to ecological and social issues is evident. Time itself is a reigning theme in Karuna’s works—the mechanics of the medium of photography, and the poetics of time’s passage. As broad as his subject matter is, time’s fleeting character is a shared principle. Mostly black and white images, with a few in colour, the photographs were captured on film and digitally and are carefully printed by the artist.\n\nKaruna has been teaching at the Dundas Valley School of Art for more than twenty years. He has a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Art and Sociology from the University of Guelph, and a teaching degree from Brock University. He has participated in numerous group and solo exhibitions, screenings and festivals across Canada, as well as in Cuba, Scotland, the USA and Hungary. He has been a resident artist at educational institutions and galleries in Ontario and California. He is the recipient of numerous production grants from the Canada Council for the Arts and the Ontario Arts Council. Karuna’s work is in private collections as well as the collections of the National Gallery of Canada, the Organization of Saskatchewan Art Councils, the Alberta College of Art, Queens University, the Mendel Gallery, and Trinity Square Video, Toronto.\n\nJune 9 – September 25\n\nOut of Place / Non lieu: Lise Beaudry, Isabelle Hayeur, Marie-Josée Laframboise\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nWorking with ideas of place and the imaginary, Lise Beaudry, Isabelle Hayeur and Marie-Josée Laframboise are Canadian francophone artists whose works portray ephemeral sites or places that don’t exist in reality. The AGH is the first Ontario venue for Hayeur’s new body of work Dé-peindre Québec ou l’envers du décor, which addresses gentrification and the preservation of historic sites in old Quebec City. These large scale photographs are digitally altered to include elements that are both factual and fictional, presenting the viewer with seamless views of places that don’t actually exist.\n\nFocusing on the temporal character of a site, Beaudry photographs the snowy surfaces of frozen lakes in a highly minimalist manner. The images are mostly white with little detail. This body of work stems from a past project wherein she documented “la peche blanche,” or ice fishing, in the francophone ice fishing communities of northern Ontario near her hometown, as a study of an important aspect of this area’s culture. She then began turning her camera downward to photograph the ice beneath her in contemplation of the experience of standing on a frozen lake. In aiming her lens downward instead of out to create these “landscapes,” she leverages a new conceptual approach in her work, involving non-representational photography. An accompanying video, Underscape, is shot beneath a lake’s icy surface. In the Gallery, it is projected at a large scale, engrossing the viewer in an experience of an ambiguous liquid environment.\n\nAn installation piece by Laframboise makes use of ambiguity as well, in an imaginary landscape made of undulating bright green net, suspended within and stretched across a room. Its surface is transparent, but the forms read as solid. The piece is created in a performative and intuitive manner, as the artist culls her memory for impressions of places she’s been. The viewer’s experience with the piece is subjective—it inspires multiple perspectives on this idea of a place.\n\nAs Hayeur has mused, “we continually remake the world in our own minds… In all places the real and the imaginary come together.”1 The works in this exhibition are conceived out of the idea of place, but all the places represented here are “non lieu.” In other words, they are no place at all.\n\n1 This text is taken from an interview between Isabelle Hayeur, Hugues Charbonneau and Patrice Loubier, which is available on the Hayeur’s website, www.isabelle-hayeur.com, and in this exhibition catalogue: Hayeur, Isabelle, Hughes Charbonneau, and Patrice Loubier.

From explorations of the pastoral views that have in part shaped our perception of France as an idyllic and evocative locale to depictions of Paris as a vibrant metropolitan center, the images presented provide artistic glimpses into the particular charm that has long characterized the country. In Mise-en-scène several generations of European, Canadian and American artists — including James W. Morrice, Christiane Pflug, Albert Marquet, Stephen Shore and Peter Sramek — depict the places that inspired them, in turn transporting us there.\n\nOctober 19 – November 3\n\nRBC Canadian Painting Competition\n\nEstablished in 1999, the RBC Canadian Painting Competition is a tribute to Canada’s artistic talent. The goal of the competition is to support and nurture Canadian visual artists early in their career by providing them with a forum to display their artistic talent to the country and hopefully open doors to future opportunity.\n\nAdjudicated by the Canadian Art Foundation, a jury consisting of distinguished members of the arts community selected five paintings from their regions as follows: Eastern (Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, PEI, Newfoundland and Labrador), Central (Ontario), Western Canada (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut). The combined jury then selected one national winner and two honourable mentions from the fifteen semi-finalists.\n\nRBC, with the support of the Canadian Art Foundation, has named Vancouver artist Rebecca Brewer the national winner of the 13th annual RBC Canadian Painting Competition. Rebecca was awarded a $25,000 purchase prize for her original work, entitled Beuys painting. Two honourable mentions were given to Beth Stuart of Toronto for her work entitled 02, from the Doppelbanger series and Deirdre McAdams of Vancouver for her work entitled Blotto. Beth and Deirdre were each awarded $15,000 for their work.\n\nWorks by each of the fifteen semi-finalists will be on display in this exhibition. For more information, please visit www.rbc.com/paintingcompetition.\n\nApril 3 – December 4\n\npasse-partout A Century of Canadians in France\n\nCurated by Tobi Bruce\n\nArtists have long journeyed across the Atlantic to Paris in search of training, inspiration and immersion in a culture that — in the decades surrounding the turn of the twentieth century — was at the center of the Western art world. Canadians were no exception. The soaring wall represents three generations of Canadian artists in France over the course of a century.\n\nAt ground level are paintings by the first generation of artists to board steamships bound for the continent, each of whom spent protracted periods studying, living and painting in Paris and its various and picturesque countrysides. These artists were exposed to a range of aesthetic approaches, including Academic art and Impressionism, elements of which they adapted to their own practices. Those who returned to Canada, such as Maurice Cullen and William Brymner, brought with them ideas and techniques learned abroad, thereby expanding art practice — and opening wide the eyes of the public — back home.\n\nCullen’s stepson Robert Pilot, together with many artists of his generation, followed in their predecessors’ footsteps. And while some of this generation also trained abroad, given the increased and more progressive teaching opportunities becoming available in Canada (in part due to the earlier generation), their experiences tended more toward informal training in the form of exploratory travel and the extensive viewing of art work.\n\nAnd then there was Jean-Paul Riopelle who, at the tender age of twenty-two and working as a ship’s hand, made his first journey to Paris in 1946, settling there in December 1948 and marking his first solo show there the following year. Like those artists of the first generation in the late nineteenth century, Riopelle found himself in a progressive and exciting artistic milieu that was at the vanguard of art production. Ensuing years overseas brought him both increased success and immersion in the Parisian cultural scene.\n\nThe French experience defined, to varying degrees, the practice of these artists. Their ability to passe partout, to move freely and explore, to invest in the rich cultural and artistic environment in which they found themselves, expanded their individual visions and, correspondingly, their painting practices.\n\nOctober 8 – December 31\n\nAttila Richard Lukacs from the Collection of Salah J. Bachir\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nSalah J. Bachir’s collection of Attila Richard Lukacs’ work is unparalleled in its scope, representing the various series for which Lukacs has become well-known.\n\nMore than thirty works are on display, including grand portraits of decadent male nudes, poetic and mythological scenes, works from the artist’s military series, Polaroid photographs used as studies for paintings, as well as a new abstract painting that has drawn a lot of attention for its departure from the figurative. Consistent throughout the works is a highly engaging, mystical, allegorical component — images of fabled lovers and animalistic characters.\n\nOver the years, Bachir’s astute selections have come to form a comprehensive collection of works by one of Canada’s greatest contemporary painters.\n\nSeptember 24 – January 15, 2012\n\nMasters of French Realism\n\nCurated by Dr. Patrick Shaw Cable\n\nThe Art Gallery of Hamilton is fortunate to own a large body of works by various French painters associated with the central nineteenth-century artistic movement Realism, which achieved its most coherent expression in French painting. So, what better time than the year of The French Connection to celebrate these masters of French Realism, and explore the relationships and distinctions between them?\n\nAt the centre of French Realism was Gustave Courbet (1819–1877), represented in the exhibition by two landscape paintings. After the rejection of three of his fourteen submissions to the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris, Courbet made the daring move to hold his own private exhibition opposite the official exposition grounds, calling his space the Pavillon du Réalisme. While Courbet’s Realist representations of peasants and labourers were motivated by strong political views and he always enjoyed thumbing his nose in the face of accepted taste and rules, other French Realists found both popular and critical success with their naturalistically painted humble subjects.\n\nA case in point is Philippe Rousseau (1816–1887), whose specialty in still-lifes steeped in the tradition of seventeenth-century French master Chardin made him a favourite of Princess Mathilde and other Second Empire notables. Another type of Realism is represented in the work of James Tissot (1836–1902), whose Croquet has long been one of the favourite European paintings in the collection and is a quintessential expression of Tissot’s interest in portraying contemporary fashionable ladies. Several other artists in the exhibition infused their Realism with an eye to past traditions, for example Théodule Ribot, who was inspired by the Dutch master Rembrandt and the Spanish master Ribera.\n\nThe Gallery owns more than twenty works by Ribot, who is the single best represented artist in the AGH Joey and Toby Tanenbaum Collection. More generally, most of the other works on display — by associated artists such as François Bonvin and Antoine Vollon — form part of the Tanenbaum Collection; together they reveal Realism to be a primary strength of this collection.\n\nOctober 1 – January 15, 2012\n\nBecoming: Photographs from the Collection of John and Ginny Soule\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nThe photographs in the collection of John and Ginny Soule span the late 19th century to the present day, illustrating the hallmark styles of photography as it progressed through the 20th century. In its beginnings, photography was not considered a fine art form, but was in the process of becoming. Likewise, the Soule’s collection is evolving, growing along with their passion for photography. The images themselves are striking, haunting and beautiful; in their own right, they are becoming pictures.\n\nJohn Soule has fond memories of how his passion for photography began. He remembers, “at some point in the mid- to late 1960s Life Magazine did a spread of photographs by Jerry Uelsmann who produced images from multiple negatives which were, in my mind, bizarre and thought-provoking. I removed the various images from the magazine, crudely framed them with cardboard backing, and hung them in my bedroom. It was cheap and amateurish, but I enjoyed observing the images, and that became my first small step to the collection we have today.”\n\nWith great pleasure, John and Ginny went on to collect veritable photographs by Jerry Uelsmann (American, b. 1934), which are on display in this exhibition amongst other striking works by Edward Steichen (American, 1879-1973), Édouard Boubat (French, 1923-1999), André Kertész (Hungarian-American, 1894-1985), Heinrich Kühn (German-Austrian, 1866-1944), Frank Sutcliffe (British, 1853-1941), Horst P. Horst (German-American, 1906-1999), and contemporary Canadian pieces by Barbara Astman and Jesse Boles.\n\nOctober 1 – January 15, 2012\n\nQuilts! A Gift from Carole and Howard Tanenbaum to the Textile Museum of Canada\n\nOrganized and circulated by the Textile Museum of Canada\n\nQuilts! celebrates the donation of Carole and Howard Tanenbaum’s impressive collection of quilts to the Textile Museum of Canada in 2011. As serious collectors of material ranging from photography to paintings and sculpture, their quilt collection began when they happened upon one in a Stratford antique store and decided they had to have it. The collection grew from there. As longstanding collectors, the Tanenbaums have developed a keen and sensitive eye, and while the quilts originally served a functional purpose, it is evident that they entered the collection on artistic and aesthetic merits alone.\n\nDating primarily to the latter part of the nineteenth century, these quilts were made in the United States, Canada and England. Originally used as bedding, furnishings, as well as markers of family and community celebration, most of the quilts’ makers are unknown and their ancestry obscure. While their meaning and social messages have evolved, they continue to offer exquisite articulations of history, tradition and craftsmanship.\n\nNovember 12 – June 17, 2012\n\nSize Matters\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett and Tobi Bruce\n\nScale—both physical and perceived—plays an important part in how we experience an artwork. Whether we look at an ambitious twelve-foot canvas or a miniature artwork the size of a locket, the dimensions of any given object can both define and condition how we perceive and engage with it. Large paintings can be appreciated either by stepping back to make sense of the whole, or by moving closer to explore the details of the brushstrokes. Conversely, the delicate and diminutive scale of smaller works might offer an intimacy that feels conspiratorial, as we lean in, getting to know our subject.\n\nThis exhibition explores the AGH collection from this perspective, as we ask ourselves how scale defines an artwork and, in turn, how size shapes our interaction with objects. Size Matters is largely an exploration, posing questions about what the scale of an object can communicate.\n\nMarch 5 – August 19, 2012\n\nFrom Rude to Rodin\n\nCurated by Dr. Patrick Shaw Cable\n\nThe largest and most important segment of the Art Gallery of Hamilton’s European sculpture collection is its rich selection of works by French artists of the nineteenth century, which we celebrate here within the context of our 2011 French Connection theme.\n\nOn view for most of the year in the AGH David Braley and Nancy Gordon Sculpture Atrium will be bronzes, terra cottas, and plasters by the masters of nineteenth-century French sculpting, such as François Rude and Antoine-Louis Barye; the mid-century giants Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse; and the later modernist pioneers Aristide Maillol and Auguste Rodin. Along the way visitors will discover the work of sculptors who are less well known today but achieved acclaim at the Paris Salons, including Henri Chapu, Paul Dubois, and Rodin’s contemporary Jules Dalou. In artworks whose subjects range from mythology to everyday life, viewers can appreciate the technical brilliance and dramatic panache of nineteenth-century French sculpture from Romanticism to modernism.\n\nFebruary 26 – May 15\n\nWomen’s Art Association of Hamilton 115th Annual Juried Exhibition\n\nA longstanding and vibrant institution within the cultural life of the City, the Women’s Art Association of Hamilton was founded in 1894; twenty years later its members helped support the establishment of the Art Gallery of Hamilton, another historic and vital Hamilton arts institution. An illustration of the ongoing ties between these two organizations is the regular hosting at the Gallery of the WAAH’s annual juried exhibition of works by members, which in 2011 marks its 115th year. Viewers can appreciate the richness of techniques, styles, and themes that characterize works chosen by jury for this special exhibition. We would also like to take this opportunity to thank the WAAH for its commitment to the Gallery and its programs, which in addition to sustained financial support has included the donation of important artworks over the years, for instance, paintings by Arthur Lismer, Hortense Gordon, and most recently the local contemporary artist Bruno Capolongo (Contemporary with Urn, Quince and Pence, Contemporary Still-Life #31 / 2005 / encaustic on panel / donated 2009).\n\nMay 19 – June 19\n\nFollow Your Art VI: SAGE Student Exhibition\n\nThis year’s SAGE (Scholastics Arts Global Education) student exhibition from Strathcona School features an exciting array of works from students from Senior Kindergarten through Grade 5. In the sixth year of the AGH / SAGE partnership, artworks inspired by AGH exhibitions and students’ own interest examine the theme of awareness – individual awareness represented by personal possessions, cultural awareness inspired by the African works in the Tanenbaum African Collection, and environmental awareness inspired by Diane Landry’s integration of everyday, recyclable objects in her artwork. SAGE students visited the AGH five times throughout the school year, studying select exhibitions in depth and creating work based on their experiences. This exhibition is the culmination of a year’s work for 91 talented students.\n\nAugust 27 – November 13\n\nRuby B. McQuesten: The Jewel of Whitehern\n\nPresented by the City of Hamilton, Whitehern Historic House and Garden\n\nArtist and devoted letter writer, Ruby Baker McQuesten (1879-1911) of Whitehern Museum passed away from tuberculosis at the young age of thirty-one. The pairings of paintings, drawings and letters featured in Ruby B. McQuesten: The Jewel of Whitehern demonstrate that despite its brevity, her life was resplendent with love for her family, humour, dynamism, and an appreciation of art. From her education at the Hamilton Art School beginning in 1894, through her career as a teacher in Ottawa, to her untimely death in 1911, Ruby Baker McQuesten produced more than sixty-five paintings, drawings, and pyrography objects. Comprising studies of the surrounding landscape, floral arrangements and still-lifes, these paintings and drawings document a life inspired by the simplicity and beauty of the natural world. Accompanied by original letters sent home to Whitehern, this exhibition presents a unique cache of fine art native to Hamilton. The Hamilton Historical Board has declared 2011 to be the “Year of the McQuestens.”\n\nJanuary 23 – May 8\n\nNothing Is So Important That It Needs To Be Made In Six Foot Neon\n\nThis piece complements the Gallery level two exhibition Conversations.\n\nKelly Mark (Canadian, b. 1967)\n\nNothing Is So Important That It Needs To Be Made In Six Foot Neon 2009\n\nNeon and transformers\n\nNeon sign construction by: Orest Tataryn\n\nMay 14 – September 11\n\nRick Pottruff: Search Engine City\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nRick Pottruff’s large-scale, intricate and gestural drawings of cities, bridges, cars, ships, planets and technological devices provide ample opportunity for viewers to be psychologically transported into the worlds he creates. His hybrid style combines the devices of illustration, fine art, and film. This summer, Pottruff undertook a new large drawing that will expand over the AGH foyer wall. Incorporating images of industry, traffic and more, he portrays an explosive dystopian scene that catapults the viewer’s eye across its many detailed sections.\n\nPottruff has been teaching art at the postsecondary level for over thirty years, and has taught at York University, the University of Guelph, the University of Waterloo, the University of Regina, Sheridan College, and currently teaches at Seneca College. He has had over thirty-five solo exhibitions in Canada, including at the AGH, and also in the USA and England. His work is in the collections of the AGH, McMaster Museum, the Canada Council Art Bank, the Art Gallery of Brant, the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery, Gallery Stratford, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, and the Mackenzie Art Gallery. Pottruff was born in Hamilton and lives in Brantford, Ontario.\n\nJanuary 16 – May 9\n\nPosing Beauty in African American Culture\n\nCurated by Deborah Willis and organized by Curatorial Assistance, Pasadena, California\n\nUshering in the AGH’s Vital Africa theme, Posing Beauty explores the contested ways in which African American beauty has been represented in the media in both historical and contemporary contexts. Throughout the Western history of art and image-making, beauty has been idealized and challenged, and the relationship between beauty and art has become increasingly complex within contemporary art and popular culture. This exhibition of photography challenges the relationship between beauty and art by examining the representation of beauty as a racialized act fraught with meanings and attitudes about class, gender, and aesthetics.\n\nPosing Beauty examines contemporary understandings of beauty by framing the notion of aesthetics, race, class and gender within art, popular culture, and political contexts. This exhibition features works drawn from public and private collections and will be accompanied by a book published by W.W. Norton. Artists in the exhibition include Carrie Mae Weems, Hank Willis Thomas, Bruce Davidson, Lee Friedlander, Garry Winogrand, Eve Arnold and Edward Curtis.\n\nDr. Deborah Willis is a Professor and Chair of the Photography and Imaging Department at New York University. She was named among the 100 Most Important People in Photography by American Photography Magazine.\n\nAfter closing at the AGH on May 9, 2010, Posing Beauty in African American Culture will travel to Williams College Museum of Art in Williamstown, Mass., the Newark Museum in New Jersey and USC Fisher Museum of Art in Los Angeles. The Art Gallery of Hamilton is currently the only Canadian venue.\n\nExhibition Partner: TD\n\nMedia Sponsor: The Globe and Mail\n\nJanuary 16 – May 9\n\nRitual Evidence: Tim Whiten\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nTim Whiten’s artistic practice, developed over the past forty years, has consistently probed transcendental themes related to rituals and relics. Using authentic human skulls, his sculptural pieces cause an arresting encounter. Featured works from the AGH collection are Ram, Canticle for Adrienne, and Siege Perilous. Upon first encounter, the works may appear unsettling in their gravity, but in fact they invite the viewer to engage in personal reflection on one’s place in the physical world. To experience the essence of Whiten’s practice, the viewer can interact with Ram. To understand the work, the viewer must kneel at the height of a human skull perched on a cedar log. This act of kneeling is akin to the act of supplication. Peering through an aperture placed in the skull, one can see his or her own reflection in addition to a close-up view of the skull. This combined imagery suggests that above one’s self, there is a superior being. Canticle for Adrienne was made when Whiten’s daughter Adrienne was a child playing in his studio. The form of this work reflects the shape of her crib, and also plays on the idea that one must always work from what has been historically pre-determined. Siege Perilous is a wooden chair with skulls mounted on its arm rests. This work generally represents a seat of power and betrayal, and specifically references the person who betrayed Christ and the thirteenth seat at the Last Supper. This exhibition of Whiten’s work is commanding – both spiritually and visually.\n\nWhiten is a highly prolific senior-career Canadian artist who has influenced generations of artists through his position as Professor of Fine Art at York University since 1968. His works have appeared in solo and group exhibitions both nationally and internationally. He is represented by Olga Korper Gallery in Toronto.\n\nJanuary 16 – May 9\n\nArctic Passion: The Inuit Art Collection of Christopher Bredt and Jamie Cameron\n\nCurated by Dr. Patrick Shaw Cable\n\nThis segment of the ongoing AGH Collectors Exhibitions Series features selected works from one of the best private collections of Inuit art that exists today in Canada — the collection of Christopher Bredt and Jamie Cameron in nearby Toronto. Assembled over many years, this notable collection includes comprehensive holdings from different areas like Baffin Island and Baker Lake, revealing a side to Inuit art that many of us do not usually recognize: the rich variety of Inuit visual expression — extending to materials and subjects, as well as intentions, meanings and moods. Bredt and Cameron, respectively a hardworking practitioner and professor of law, possess an intimate relationship with these objects they have collected together and live with daily — the couple’s collection expresses both their passionate appreciation of the forms of Inuit art, and their uncommon understanding of Inuit art’s development and cultural context. The AGH is proud to usher in 2010 with this public presentation of choice Inuit sculptures and prints, which comes on the heels of the 50th anniversary of the first appearance of catalogued Inuit prints in 1959 — at Cape Dorset, one of the major locales to be represented with singular breadth in the Bredt and Cameron collection.\n\nJanuary 30 – May 24\n\nEnd of the American Road: Terence Byrnes\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nPremiering in Canada, Terence Byrnes’ photographic series Springfield, Ohio: The End of the American Road yields surprising views of small town America. Byrnes has been photographing the people and places of Springfield for over forty years. On his annual visits, he looks for things that might often be overlooked, and many of his images show people living in poverty. Byrnes has formed enduring friendships with the many locals who are unlikely to escape Springfield’s tight orbits of class and race.\n\nOften compared to the work of Walker Evans, Byrnes’ images are moving in their depiction of the lives of the citizens of Springfield. The images are at times flecked with humour, or tenderness, or plain, if shocking, realities of American life. On display are black and white and colour photographs taken from 1966 up to the present, showing the evolution of people and place while Byrnes’ unassuming presence remains a constant. Byrnes is a Montreal-based artist and author. His photographs have been exhibited in Canada and the USA.\n\nJanuary 30 – May 24\n\ndavid merritt: sham\n\nCurated by Melissa Bennett\n\nDavid Merritt’s works are playful, serious, humorous and conceptually weighted all at once. He examines the relationship between the way words are used, and the way they appear when written. Taking the words of popular songs, he charts them in intricately drawn diagrams, making connections between the many songs that use the same phrases, such as “last train”. Interwoven lines, supplemented by many erasures, place an authoritative yet absurd order on the content of pop songs. Merritt’s signature sculptural works are also on display: delicate forms are made from unraveled lengths of sisal rope. Battling the tensions between heavy and light, some of the sisal sculptures also incorporate language, working with the themes of music, and the connections between words, meanings, and their visual presence in popular culture.\n\nMerritt’s work has been exhibited in Canada and internationally, including at the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Textile Museum of Canada and TENT CBK, Rotterdam. He is based in London, Ontario and is represented by Jessica Bradley Art + Projects, Toronto. The exhibition will be accompanied by a publication co-published with Museum London, the Art Gallery of Windsor, and the MacLaren Art Centre.\n\nApril 24 – August 15\n\nRobert Mason\n\nGuest Curated by Shirley Madill\n\nRobert Mason was a Hamilton-based artist who influenced a generation of artists in this community. This large-scale exhibition brings together over forty works from public and private collections including the last suite of works he produced prior to his death in 2005. Expressed through painting, installation, photography and sculpture, Mason’s interests can be contextualized within larger artistic movements in North America such as land art and painterly abstraction. Recurring motifs and themes in Mason’s paintings include the landscape, trees, the night sky and migration. His large outdoor installation pieces, including the placement of caribou sculptures in the water at Hamilton’s Cootes Paradise, evoked his sensitivity and concern for the natural environment in the face of increased industrialization. Known for his dedication to arts and education in Hamilton, Mason is remembered and honoured through this exhibition that uncovers significant stages in his career.\n\nApril 10 – August 15\n\nShaped by Light\n\nCurated by Tobi Bruce\n\nShaped by Light brings together the work of four historical Canadian artists who journeyed to Africa during the first decades of th"
