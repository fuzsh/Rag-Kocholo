Read on to discover some of the best things to do in Hamilton year-round. After the last year and a half stuck inside, many of us are ready to get out and find new adventures. With vaccines rolling out and businesses opening back up, we’re all finding new things to love about the places we live. And if you’re in the Hamilton, Ontario, area, you may be looking for some exciting new things to try this summer and fall.\n\nNo matter what time of year it is, Hamilton, Ontario has some fantastic attractions to offer. Read on to discover some of the best things to do in Hamilton year-round.\n\nWinters in Canada are harsh, and it can seem like there may not be much to do during this time. However, there is a lot to do in Hamilton during the colder months! Read on to discover just a couple of the amazing opportunities for fun in the winter.\n\nCheck Out the Waterfalls\n\nOne of the most amazing features of Hamilton, Ontario is its waterfalls. The city is home to more than 100 waterfalls thanks to its location along the Niagara Escarpment. And you might be surprised to learn that one of the best times to visit these waterfalls is during the winter.\n\nTew Falls and Felker’s Falls are two of Hamilton’s most beautiful waterfalls, with Felker’s Falls freezing over in the winter. If you have training in ice climbing, you can also elect to climb Tiffany Falls when they’re frozen during the colder months. Little Davis Falls and Albion Falls are also popular in the wintertime.\n\nGo for a Walk\n\nWinter might not seem like the best time to go for a walk, but getting out of the house can help to reduce some of the effects of seasonal affective disorder. There are also some beautiful sights to see around Hamilton, especially in the evenings. With the sun setting so much earlier, you can catch some beautiful sunsets while you’re out on your walk.\n\nTake a walk through Waterdown Memorial Park, enjoying some of the many paths the park has to offer. You can also go snowshoeing at Dundas Valley Conservation Area, which has a number of trails for you to choose from. Or take in some lake views along the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail, which overlooks Lake Ontario.\n\nOnce the weather thaws out a little, you may be eager to get out of the house. Hamilton offers some incredible attractions during the springtime too!\n\nVisit the Botanical Gardens\n\nThe Royal Botanical Gardens are one of the most amazing springtime things to do in Hamilton. The gardens span more than 2,400 acres and are home to more than 1,000 different species of plants. Most of the plants in the gardens are native, so you’ll have amazing opportunities to see some gorgeous local flora.\n\nThere are a few different areas to visit in the Royal Botanical Gardens, beginning with Hendrie Park, the largest cultivated garden in the gardens. Hendrie Park includes some amazing rose gardens, as well as the Morrison Woodland Garden. Keep an eye out for the rare bashful bulrush, endangered red mulberry tree, and trilliums, the official flower of Ontario.\n\nWhen summer vacation rolls around, you may want to take the family on some new adventures! Hamilton has some amazing summer attractions to keep the whole family entertained.\n\nExplore a Castle\n\nHow would you like to spend a summer afternoon exploring a real castle? Dundurn Castle was built in 1835 and has more than 1,700 square meters of living space spread across 40 rooms. It was built by Sir Allan MacNab, who became prime minister of Canada nine years after its completion. The entrance features four huge pillars that are a hallmark of the home’s stunning Neoclassical style.\n\nThe city of Hamilton purchased Dundurn Castle around 1900 and restored it to look just as it did in its prime. If you visit today, you can see all of the original furnishings and décor, as well as stunningly maintained grounds. The castle features a two-acre kitchen garden, an old coach house, and costumed tour guides who can share stories from the castle’s nearly two-century history.\n\nEnjoy an Art Gallery\n\nIf you’re looking for more things to do in Hamilton indoors, why not check out Hamilton’s Art Gallery? The Art Gallery of Hamilton was established more than a century ago, but it moved to its current location on King Street West in the late 1970s. The museum has more than 7,000 square meters of gallery space, so you’ll have plenty to explore.\n\nThe Art Gallery has a vast permanent collection, featuring more than 10,000 pieces that are on rotation at the museum. They also bring in different exhibits to give guests a chance to experience the best of Canadian art. General admission is free, and the gallery features a gift shop, a café, and guided tours.\n\nWhen the fall rolls around, many of us are dying to get outdoors and enjoy the last beautiful weather before winter sets in. There are plenty of fun things to do in Hamilton to make your fall as memorable as possible.\n\nVisit a Heritage Village\n\nAs temperatures drop and that crisp fall air sets in, there’s no place better to be than the Westfield Heritage Village. This community is less than half an hour from Hamilton and consists of thirty-five historic buildings spread out on an 840-acre site. This town has been lovingly reconstructed to appear just as it did in the 19th century.\n\nWestfield Heritage Village provides a look into the lives of Canadians living in the 1800s and early 1900s. You can purchase a traditional candle at the general store, visit a maple syrup shack, or check out some of the regular skill demonstrations. You can also explore the meadows and woods of the surrounding areas to hear that tantalizing crunch of leaves under your feet."
