        "text": "Of all the harbingers of spring in central Canada, my favourite has to be the start of maple syrup season. Maple syrup is, of course, symbolic of Canada and trips to the sugar bush are a spring-time tradition for many families. I have many fond memories of both childhood trips to the sugar bush and of visits to maple syrup festivals in the GTA with my own kids.\n\nCanada produces approximately 78% of the world’s supply of maple syrup (17.41 million gallons in 2022). The vast majority of that is produced in Québec, but it is also produced in lesser quantities in parts of Ontario and Atlantic Canada.\n\nIt is primarily Sugar Maples that are tapped as the sweetness of the sap from this species of tree produces the tasty maple syrup that everyone loves. The sap generally starts running around the beginning of March when cold overnight temperatures give rise to warm, sunny days and above-freezing temperatures and continues until the trees are in bud and spring well underway.\n\nOrganized Maple Syrup Festivals are a popular way for Canadians to celebrate the onset of the sugaring season and can be found across the Greater Toronto Area. These are 10 of the best maple syrup festivals and experiences in the GTA.\n\nYou Might Also Enjoy: 11 of Canada’s Best Winter Festivals to Celebrate the Season\n\n1.
