It boasts a stunning collection of over 35 historical buildings that have been restored to capture the true charm and spirit of early Canadian culture. The buildings are nestled against the backdrop of 204 hectares of conservation land that features woodlands, meadows and nearly 8 kilometres of walking trails. Westfield offers various events and education programs throughout the year, and is the ideal setting for weddings."
