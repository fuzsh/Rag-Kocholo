        "text": "​\n\nI am a Métis installation artist and a citizen of the Métis Nation of Ontario. My family is from several traditional Métis communities . I am from both the Vasseur-Longlade and Cadieux-Evans families.\n\nI am traveling Canada creating site specific art installations at residential school historical sites, cultural centres, museums, art galleries and other public spaces.\n\n​The goal of these works is to broach the subject of decolonization with viewers and staff. The installations are created with large premade crochet, and knit pieces made with red yarn. These are created both inside and outside and weather the elements quite successfully. The installations can be in place for as long as the venue would like. Once dismantled the work itself will be returned to me and it will be reworked and repurposed at another site somewhere in the country.\n\nMany (but not all) of these public spaces serve to present a colonial viewpoint and primarily speak about the settlers who arrived and lived here but not the Indigenous people that were displaced along the way. The decolonization of such places is a ponderous task and must be shouldered collectively. The discussion of reconciliation and decolonization is hard to start and harder still to maintain. Therefore, I am hoping to use my work to help bridge the gap between settlers and Indigenous, the First Nations, Métis, and Inuit of Canada by creating art that is approachable and non-confrontational so we can start. As I am part Métis and European I am conscious of the privilege my 'whiteness' affords me and bridging this gap is in fact a form of self education and self healing.
