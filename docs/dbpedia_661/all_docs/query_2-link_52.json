        "text": "Westfield Heritage Village first opened to the public in 1964. Westfield is a collection of over 30 historical buildings that have been relocated to Westfield from throughout southern Ontario. Two teachers from Brantford, Glenn Kilmer and Goldie MacDonell, had a vision to recreate a Village setting that included a number of shops, homes and businesses bringing to life the historical past.\n\nThe backdrop to this Village includes over 204 hectares (503 acres) of land that features natural woodlands, plantation forests and provincially significant wetlands. Hidden in among the trees are two ruin sites of the old farms that once were in operation more than 100 years ago.\n\nWestfield is a community project with over 250 active volunteers and numerous community groups helping to provide tours, events and educational programs. Volunteers are involved in every aspect of running the site including costumed interpreters, gardeners, maintenance workers, collection assistants, and costume committee members."
