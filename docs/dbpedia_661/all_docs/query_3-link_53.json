A young John Muir, who would later become known as the Father of National Parks, was greatly influenced by this land and tried to purchase it several times throughout his life to preserve it. Visitors may explore the 125 acre park by hiking the trail that circles 30 acre Ennis Lake and passes through 7 different habitats. You can find the wonderful wilderness that he came to love by sauntering the public lands and trails of his boyhood home.
