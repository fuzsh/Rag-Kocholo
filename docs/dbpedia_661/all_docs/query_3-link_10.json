        "text": "Join us in celebrating Westfield’s 60th Anniversary on Saturday, June 15, and Sunday, June 16, from 12 PM to 4 PM each day. The village will be bustling with activity to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee anniversary of Westfield’s opening.\n\nA new interactive garden, created to celebrate the occasion, will be open, along with an art installation by Tracey-Mae Chambers. Tracey-Mae is a Metis installation artist and a member of the Metis Nation of Ontario. Her works aim to broach decolonization with viewers and staff, and she hopes to use her work to bridge the gap between settlers and Indigenous, the First Nations, Metis, and Inuit of Canada.\n\nMany historical buildings will be open with costumed interpreters and demonstrations, and visitors can enjoy the all-day musical entertainment. Hop on a steam traction engine wagon ride, or go on one of our hourly nature tours through the conservation area. The General Store and Gift Shop will also be open for sodas, candies, souvenirs, gifts, and more!\n\nRegular admission fees apply, and a reservation is not required.\n\nThe History of Westfield\n\nThe land on which Westfield sits was purchased in 1960, and the village opened to the public on June 15, 1964. The Hamilton Conservation Authority (HCA) began managing Westfield in 1987. In 2015, HCA began acquiring additional lands at Westfield, totalling 58 hectares (144 acres). This included City of Hamilton and private lands; the final purchase was completed in 2016. The area was then officially renamed Westfield Heritage Village Conservation Area and is now approximately 204 hectares (503 acres) in size and features natural woodlands, plantation forests, provincially significant wetlands, meadow areas, and cultural heritage features.\n\nNew Logo!\n\nA new Westfield Heritage Village Conservation Area logo has been created to celebrate this momentous occasion and aims to reflect Westfield as a whole. The new logo highlights the two key elements that make up Westfield; the trail and trees symbolize the conservation area, while the stylized Bamberger House represents the heritage village. The logo’s colours are taken from the HCA logo and branding and reflect its place and importance at HCA."
