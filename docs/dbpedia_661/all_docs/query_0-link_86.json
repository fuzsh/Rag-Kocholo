        "text": "A good Thursday to all…..8:30 am and already 82° here this morning. High today to hit 99° with a Heat Index of 111°…………..thank gawd for AC! Not doing a thing outside today …… nothing! Have already set the mister on the AC compressor outside and taken out the garbage…..my list is cleared.\n\nDisappointed that the lads didn’t prevail yesterday over Croatia, but such is a game. Someone wins…..someone loses. It is just a game. Someone mentioned cricket…..my cats play with crickets, they like to play soccer with crickets…….maybe I have English cats.\n\nNo big plans today….feeling 100% more my normal, but know that with this heat wave, pushing anything would knock me down very quickly. Will hibernate in the studio today….still working on my bananas and got some info on my grandmother’s father from an English genealogy webiste that I need to follow up on. His name was Edward Bowan Berwick, born in Middlesex in 1841. Have been trying to trace my grandmother’s lineage back to England, but kept hitting walls. The oral tradition is that he was from a family of means and during the Civil War, on a business trip to buy cotton from the South for the family business, he never returned to England. One version is that his uncle was Lord Berwick and that he left a wife and child to stay in the States…..another is that his family disowned him. None of which, has ever been confirmed with any official verification. He just is….and I would like to find out what the real story is. Hopefully, this lead will actually lead to something.\n\nTime to get moving…..burning daylight. Breakfast first. BBL\n\nBe good, do good……..stay cool folks, stay hydrated.\n\nSteve.\n\nPain and heartaches aren't options in life........misery is a choice.\n\nWe’ve been watching “Anne with an E,” on Netflix. It’s an Anne of Green Gables series, and we love it.\n\nLynn, is Westfield Heritage Village in Hamilton the village you work in? Parts of the series are filmed there.\n\nSteve, glad you”re feeling better. Maybe the news has a negative physical effect on you.\n\nGeoff has helped me with my ancestry too. He should probably go into business. He’s that good.\n\nFor anyone interested, I have been following a ketogenic diet for about six weeks, with the exception of wine, and it has helped reduce inflammation and pain considerably. Also, losing unwanted fat.\n\nBill\n\nBe kinder than necessary\n\nYes, Bill, thats the one! Although its hard to recognize it most of the time. Sometimes our volunteers are extras. And it is quite far north west of Hamilton, but comes under the Hamilton Conservation Authority, unusual for a museum. Glad you are enjoying the series!\n\nYou can spend hours in that research, Steve, its a lot of fun! Geoff is very knowledgeable. Ive hit a similar wall back in the early 1800s, looking for my GGgrandfathers origins. He seems ro have materialized in Norfolk with the christening of his son, but I guess he was around long before that! And we know he was in the Navy, but not who his parents were, or where he was born. I guess im lucky to have his naval record, but they are very short on personal details there. Good luck with your searches.\n\nHow lovely to have a swim, Char! :envy: Any chance you are coming down this way?:)\n\nCheers, Lynn\n\nwww.fineartamerica.com/profiles/lynn-macintyre\n\n\"Ring the bells that still can ring, Forget your perfect offering, There is a crack in everything, That's how the light gets in\" Leonard Cohen\n\nGood afternoon! I finally got to the grocery store, and the cupboard is no longer bare.\n\nPartly cloudy, but only a slight chance of rain. I will have to turn the sprinklers back on before Friday. We are up to 99 degrees again with high humidity.\n\nEach day, we wake up to a new, strange world making our heads spin.\n\nSteve, I have been able to trace my father’s family back to Poland in 1763. That relative’s chunk of DNA is still being passed on down through the family taking up half of the chromosome. It has some strong staying power to go through 7 generations. It is a fun endeavor to find that 255 years ago, our family was living in Poland and moved to the US in the late 1890s. The only reason I have these records is they lived in Western Poland through the Catholic Church near Poznan. It was occupied by the Germans in WWII. My mother’s family came from Russian occupied Poland near Warsaw. There are no records to find! I live in hope that one day the church records will be updated. The biggest surprise is that my maternal line is Irish/Scottish. Tradesmen settled in Poland, and one of their daughters married a native in the early 1800s. The Poles were irate that those foreigners were taking over their jobs. The English Version of Ancestry is far better than the one we have to use. Geoff is an expert!\n\nHave a wonderful evening. I bought deli roast beef that I will serve with gravy and mashed potatoes tonight. We will have enough for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow.\n\nMY FACEBOOK PAGE\n\n\"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\"- Einstein\n\nWell…Our afternoon thunder storms have rolled in….not a whole lot of rain, but enough to cool it down a little and thankfully the cloud cover is hanging around…no turkish steam bath today.\n\nMat studio chair gave up the ghost late this morning….something popped and it has a very uncomfortable permanent lean to it now. Checked it out and the metal plate underneath has cracked……it has been a good and faithful chair for the last 6 years, I shall give it a proper adieu ceremonial sendoff to the dump. Picked up a task chair with mesh back at Office Depot on sale that I think will work out fine……good thing I got it before Trump’s tariffs kicked in….it’s manufactured in China. Has great lumbar support….way better than the old one.\n\nGeoff….I appreciate the offer for help. I’ll let you know what if anything of this lead actually has any substance to it and then I may pick your knowledge in which direction to go from there. I’ve pretty much populated our family tree with information going back to my 5G grandfather (Tetrick) who was a Prussian mercenary in Gen. Washington’s army in the Revolutionary War and stayed here after the war. It is quite a large tree, if I print it out, by about the 3rd generation I’m to 3 pages and in total it is about 8′ in length. By my father’s generation (6th) it goes to 4 pages wide…….I very rarely print it out as it is an all day task. Much easier to just print out the data on 81/2 x11.\n\nTime to get dinner started………..\n\nSteve\n\nPain and heartaches aren't options in life........misery is a choice."
