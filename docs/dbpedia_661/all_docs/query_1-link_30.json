Canada’s war heroes, Aboriginal warriors, inventors and founding families aren’t just remembered in Hamilton Halton Brant, they’re celebrated in creative ways that ensure the spirits of the people who shaped our country live on. Interactive programming, creatively curated collections of artifacts and one-of-a-kind events and festivals transform history into engaging moments that shift perspectives and remind us how special it is to call this country home."
