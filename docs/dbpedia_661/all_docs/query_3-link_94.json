The station experience gives visitors a glimpse into life on an outback station – from the times of Captain Starlight in the 1800s to the modern day! The tour departs from Longreach and the Outback Pioneers' Nogo Station Experience brings outback history and a contemporary working station together to tell an important part of Australia’s story. As you make your journey to the station, you will begin to learn the history of the region and the property, including its ties to infamous cattle thief, Harry Redford (aka Captain Starlight). You will be shown the ruins of the stockyards, which are said to have been purpose-built by Captain Starlight to hold his mob of stolen cattle while he rebranded them before droving them to South Australia to sell. Wander around the house and view some of the rooms as they may have looked back in the day, with each room telling a story on what country life was and, in many ways, still is today.\n\nFor something a bit different, why not take in a cemetery tour? Cemeteries hold amazing stories of our past and what better way to find out how those dear departed helped shape the town's history.\n\nThe tour is a 75 minute historical tour where you will hear the stories of the town’s former residents - you'll be told about their hopes, dreams and their ideals, whilst also learning about the mysteries that surround the town.\n\nThe Australian Stockman’s Hall of Fame and Outback Heritage Centre is Australia’s premier outback heritage institution.

This includes: 1948 era classroom, the remains of the Longreach School of Arts Museum (1930-1970), a replica Airport Control Centre and a collection of commercial office equipment, circa 1908 – 1950 from local business house!\n\nCobb & Co were the pioneers of stagecoach travel and mail services throughout Australia.

Pounding hooves of the horses, the rattle and creak of the coach. Hold on to your hat for the only stagecoach gallop in Australia! This experience is the closest you can get to feeling what it would have been like in the pioneer past.\n\nCue “All the Rivers Run” theme. Take to the water and cruise on the only paddle wheeler in the area or on the Thomson Princess Riverboat. Enjoy an adventure to the heart of Outback tradition and legend - cruise down the river, taking in all the flora and fauna has to offer. You will head to shore for a traditional stockman’s camp-fire dinner, followed by bush poetry with a local outback storyteller.
