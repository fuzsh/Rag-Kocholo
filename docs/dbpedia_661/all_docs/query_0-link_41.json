During the War of 1812, the family retreated to their cellar as the Battle of Stoney Creek raged outside. The 100-foot-high Battlefield Monument stands as a symbol of peace and commemorates those soldiers who died on June 6, 1813. Nestled under the scenic Niagara Escarpment, this historic site encompasses 32 acres of parkland divided by Battlefield Creek.\n\nWhile at Battlefield Park, be sure to visit their new public art project, The Eagles Among Us by David M. General. The work is a series of four large granite figures that address the theme of healing and reconciliation using interpretations of the cultural traditions of the Haudenosaunee and Anishinabek communities.\n\nVisit this early 19th century homestead once home to the Gage family.
