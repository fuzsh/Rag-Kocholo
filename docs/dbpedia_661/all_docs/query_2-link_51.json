        "text": "The proposed new center, a first in Upstate in New York, will be located at the corner of Niagara and Hudson Streets on Buffalo's west side, which will be Green Energy Efficient with energy efficient amenities, will encompass approximately 38,000 square feet on three floors. The primary architectural design objective is to create a friendly, modern, and sustainable facility with as Hispanic / Latino elegance. The conceptual exterior images depict a variety of natural materials such as stone and wood, accented with bold colors- reminiscent of the Caribbean. The facades also incorporate expansive sections of glass to deliver abundant natural light and encourage visual connections to the internal activities, promoting inclusivity for a diverse user group.\n\nInterior spaces include a museum, art gallery, café, gift shop, performing arts theater, activities space, broadcast media center, learning labs and administrative spaces- spread over the first two floors. The third floor has been allocated for tenant leased space as means of generating revenue, to support economic sustainability. The entire facility is conceived to be inherently flexible, with multi-functional spaces, and the ability to adapt to future space needs and desired programming.\n\nIn accordance with the Unified Development Ordinance for the City of Buffalo (commonly referred to as the \"Green Code\") a civic building should be designed to stand apart from its surroundings due to the special nature of its use as a public facility. A civic building is often among the most prominently sited and architecturally significant in a neighborhood.\n\n*Hispanic Heritage Council of WNY Inc. is not responsible for any of the facts or opinions contained on any linked sites.*\n\nNon Discrimination Policy:\n\n*The provision of all services, benefits, and programs of the Hispanic Heritage Council of WNY, Inc. shall be made without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, age, religion, gender, disability, marital status, partnership status, sexual orientation, alienage, or citizenship status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.*\n\nIn case of questions concerning this policy, or another question for or related to HHC?
