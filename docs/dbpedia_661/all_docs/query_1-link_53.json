Nature lovers will enjoy spending time exploring the Niagara Escarpment and hiking along the Bruce Trail or strolling through the Royal Botanical Gardens.\n\nThe rich military history of Hamilton is on display with the HMCS Haida residing on Lake Ontario. This former naval warship is now a floating museum. Be sure to visit southern Hamilton and the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum for a bigger glimpse into Hamilton’s role in the success of the Canadian military.
