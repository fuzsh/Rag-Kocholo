Exhibits throughout the Village honor Mother Ann, the Shaker Sisters who lived at Hancock, and the many women who have brought the Shaker story to life since Hancock’s inception as a museum in 1961.\n\nHistorical narratives are presented through images, writings, recordings, drawings, samplers, correspondences, music, and objects used and made in the Shakers’ day-to-day lives. Contemporary reflections on the contributions of the Shaker Sisters are featured in the work of women artists who are influenced and inspired by the Shaker aesthetic."
