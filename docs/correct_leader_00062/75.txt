1875 ca , Paris , FRANCE : The french historian and politician ADOLPHE THIERS ( 1797 - 1877 ) . Photo by Pirou , Paris . Thiers was a prime minister under King Louis-Philippe of France. Following the overthrow of the Second Empire he again came to prominence as the French leader who suppressed the revolutionary Paris Commune of 1871. From 1871 to 1873 he served initially as Head of State (effectively a provisional President of France), then provisional President. When, following a vote of no confidence in the National Assembly, his offer of resignation was accepted (he had expected a rejection) he was forced to vacate the office. He was replaced as Provisional President by Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta, who became full President of the Republic, a post Thiers had coveted, in 1875 when a series of constitutional laws officially creating the Third Republic were enacted. - POLITICO - POLITICA - POLITIC - FRANCIA - FRANCE - BATTAGLIA DI MAGENTA - RISORGIMENTO - foto storiche - foto storica - HISTORY - portrait - ritratto - occhiali da vista - glasses - --- Archivio GBB
