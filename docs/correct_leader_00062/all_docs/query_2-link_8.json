        "text": "Just around the turn of the century, the desire on the part of wealthy American and European collectors for Italian art was exorbitant. Operating out of Florence, the dealer Stefano Bardini (1836-1922) succeeded in matching that demand by stocking collections with ample quantities of high quality supply. Moreover, Bardini deftly cultivated a taste for certain kinds of objects which have since moved into public view in museums around the world. However, as far as the Americans were concerned, Italian art of the Trecento was not especially the objects of desire. On the basis of much newly discovered archival material concerning transactions of art from ca 1870-1900 it can be demonstrated that the transatlantic market was ripe for specifically art of the late fifteenth century, that is, for objects which evoked of the age of Lorenzo the Magnificent. This paper examines this phenomenon, the possible reasons behind it, and how Bardini effectively exploited these conditions. In addition, using a case study which involves Bardini, Wilhelm Bode (1845-1929) and the Bostonian Quincy Adams Shaw (1825-1908) it can be demonstrated that this was the generation that refined the relationships among the collector, the dealer and the academic expert/connoisseur. The result was the birth of the business model upon which the younger Bernard Berenson (1865-1959) would build his career. Moreover, as a complex transatlantic synergy, it ultimately provided the very impetus required for Italian trecento art to enter mainstream American collecting and academic discourse in the early twentieth century.\n\nThe topic of the essay is that of the political use of relics belonged to patriots, heroes and martyres of the Italian Risorgimento, in a national perspective from the first half of 19th century to the first period of 20th century. The aim regards the building of a historical picture within which I would examine a diversified and broad-spectrum range of objects, belonged to patriots, politicians, military (both individuals and groups); which objects were recovered, stored, collected by relatives, friends, associations, sometimes during the unification achievment still ongoing, and then moved from a private framework into a wide spread exhibition and public sharing of the composite and also conflicting memory of the Risorgimento. In different periods and contexts, and according to several purposes, these relics-objects were alternately mediators of political languages, symbols of collective identities, pedagogical tools and, as documents-monuments, parts of a cultural, memorial and scientific heritage. Within the historical context signed by seeking political support, building a national identity, using the memory of the Risorgimento – on which recent historiography has dwelt – the principal aim is to investigate the nature, texture, origins, destinations of particular sets of objects which, starting from the last two decades of the 19th century, would crowd the first museums of national history in Italy. The essay wants to provide a systematic mapping and a typological division of the relics-objects; to linger on the actors and main characters (relatives - especially women -, comrades in arms, exiled; the galaxy of war veterans’ associations; and then politicians, mayors, administrators, cultural organizers) involved in the first attempts of production, assembly, custody and exhibition of such materials. The focus will then move to the first places of memorial construction, during the pre-unitarian period and then during the years of the Right governements (amphibians places such private collections, boardrooms, council chambers, barracks and membership sites; mortuaries; palaces and churches; exhibitions sites); and it will study in deep the subsequent transfers of many of these items in the first major exhibitions and the first museums of the Italian Risorgimento, following institutional rather than hidden ways.\n\nThis article investigates the complex layering of historical and memorial references at the Musée Nissim de Camondo in Paris as it has evolved from private residence to an increasingly open public museum. Built between 1911 and 1914 for an important collection of eighteenth-century furnishings and decorative arts, the house took on a commemorative function following the death of the founder’s son, Nissim, for whom the museum was named. Over the last century, through the vicissitudes of history, revised narrative priorities and changing approaches to museum presentation, this house-turned-museum has become a site of historical representation focused as much on the twentieth century and the Camondo family as on the period of its original inspiration. This article explores that transition, attending to the museum’s founding memorial goal in the wake of World War II, the tragic demise of the Camondo family, and shifting perspectives on French history.\n\nThis master thesis consists in analyzing artefacts of Magdalenian portable art and their respective replicas. The research had two main goals: to establish a profile for the approached collection and to comprehend the scientific value of portable art replicas. They were both carried out through examination of extrinsic and intrinsic aspects of the artifacts and, later, by comparing a sample of replicas to their matched authentic objects. Upon examination of these latter, it becomes clear that replicas that fail in maintaining those natural features depend on a good documentation of the original artefact in order to be reliably studied. On the other hand, decorative aspects have responded well to the study on copies. By demonstrating that the replicas can be successfully used in scientific analysis, this paper raises insights for the study of the collections and the healthy conciliation between research and conservation of portable art objects\n\nThe historian Simona Cerutti has recently made a claim for the necessity of writing “history from below.” Such an approach means at least two separate yet connected things: first, it encourages the study of people who engaged in more modest activities, such as, in our case, painting restorers, as opposed to more frequently studied protagonists such as painters working in royal institutions. Second, it proposes the use of more basic, technical, or even administrative archival sources such as inventaires après décès, technical treaties, restoration bills, etc. From this perspective, “below” is both a method and a place from which to observe and reconsider our objects of study. Taking such a scholarly approach to investigate a building like the Louvre has enabled a repopulation of this unique Parisian quartier, while also revealing the circulation of those people and their goods throughout the neighborhood. In doing so, the palace appears not as an impermeable fortress in the middle of the city, but as a place of circulation, transition, and interaction. Finally, as the example of Marie-Jacob Godefroid shows, discovering how people interacted in workspaces brings to light those frequently invisible actors, such as women and children, laboring in the shadows of the archive’s more dominant figures. Writing art history from below thus becomes a productive way of repopulating the eighteenth-century “art world,” as Howard Becker conceptualizes it, to encounter the myriad people interacting with art in the early modern city."
