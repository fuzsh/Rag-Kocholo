The Directory, as grossly abused as ever, struck the greatest terror into the foreign powers. Half Europe, wrote Mallet Dupan,{1} is at the knees of this divan, vying for the honour of becoming its tributary. These fifteen months’ firm and brilliant reign had consolidated the power of the five directors, but had .also developed their passions and their characters. Men cannot live long together without soon taking a liking or a dislike to one another, and without grouping themselves into parties according to their inclinations. Carnot, Barras, Rewbel, Larévellière-Lepeaux, Letourneur, already formed different groups. Carnot was systematic, obstinate, and proud. He was totally destitute of that quality which imparts enlarged views and precision to the mind and suppleness to the character. He was shrewd, and could readily fathom any subject which he was examining; but, when once involved in an error, he could never extricate himself from it. He was upright,{2} persevering, very attentive to business, but never forgave either a wrong or an affront offered to his self-love; he was witty and original, which is frequently the case with men who are wrapped up in themselves. He had formerly quarrelled with the members of the committee of public welfare, for it was impossible that his pride should sympathise with that of Robespierre and St. Just, and that his great courage should flinch before their despotism. Now, he could not fail to be in the same predicament in regard to the Directory. Besides the occasions which he had to jostle against his colleagues while engaged with them in a task so difficult as that of government, and which so naturally provokes a diversity of opinions, he cherished old resentments, particularly against Barras. All his dispositions, as a strict, upright, laborious man, kept him aloof from this prodigal, debauched, and indolent colleague; but he especially detested in him the chief of those. Thermidorians, friends and avengers of Danton, and persecutors of the old Mountain. Carnot, who was one of the principal authors of Danton’s death, and who had well-nigh fallen a victim to the persecutions directed against the Mountain, could not forgive the Thermidorians: he therefore entertained a profound hatred against Barras.\n\nBarras had formerly served in India, and had there displayed the courage of a soldier. He was a fit man to mount his horse on occasion of disturbances; and it was in this manner, as we have seen, that he had earned his place in the Directory. Hence, on all difficult occasions, he would still talk of mounting his horse and putting to the sword the enemies of the republic. In person he was tall and handsome; but in his countenance there was something dark and sinister, that harmonised little with his disposition, which was rather passionate than wicked. Though he belonged by birth to the higher ranks, his manners indicated no superiority of breeding. They were blunt, bold, and vulgar. He was endowed with a soundness and a penetration of mind, which, with study and application, might have become highly distinguished faculties; but, indolent and ignorant, he knew at most only what is learned in a stormy life; and, in those matters upon which he was daily called to give his opinion, he manifested good sense enough to induce regret that he should not have had a more careful education. In other respects, dissolute and rough, violent and false, like the Southerns, who are apt to conceal duplicity under the guise of bluntness, republican by sentiment and by position, but a man without faith, admitting to his house the most violent revolutionists of the faubourgs and all the emigrants who had returned to France, pleasing the one by his trivial vehemence, and the other by his spirit of intrigue, he was in reality a warm patriot, and in secret he held out hopes to all parties. In himself alone he was the entire Danton party, excepting the genius of its chief, which had not devolved on his successors.{3}\n\nRewbel, formerly an advocate at Colmar, had acquired at the bar and in our different assemblies, great experience in the management of affairs. With the most extraordinary penetration and discernment he combined extensive information, a prodigious memory, and persevering application to business. These qualities made him a most useful man at the head of the state. He discussed matters ably, though somewhat disposed to cavil, owing to a relic of the habits of the bar. To a handsome person he joined the manners of good society; but he was rough and affronting by the warmth and keenness of his language. Notwithstanding the calumnies of counter-revolutionists and rogues, he was a man of strict integrity. Unluckily, he was not wholly free from avarice. He was fond of employing his private fortune in a profitable manner, which caused him to have intercourse with men of business, and this furnished calumny with plausible pretexts. He paid particular attention to the department of foreign affairs, and so strong was his attachment to the interests of France, that he would not have cared to be unjust towards foreign nations. A warm, sincere, and staunch republican, he belonged originally to the moderate part of the Convention, and equally disliked Carnot and Barras, the one as a Mountaineer, the other as a Dantonist. Thus Carnot, Barras, and Rewbel, all three sprung from adverse parties, all three hated one another; thus these animosities, kindled during a long and terrible struggle, were not extinguished under the constitutional system; thus hearts had mingled, like rivers which unite without blending their waters. These three men, however, though detesting one another, curbed their resentments and laboured together at the general work.\n\nThere remained Larévellière-Lepeaux and Letourneur, who hated nobody. Letourneur, a good-natured man, having vanity, but an easy and not importunate vanity, who was satisfied with the domestic marks of power and the homage of sentinels, felt a respectful submission for Carnot. He was prompt in giving his opinion, but equally prompt in retracting it as soon as any one proved to him that he was wrong, or as soon as Carnot had spoken. He voted on all occasions with Carnot.\n\nLarévellière, the most honest and the best of men, united with a great variety of knowledge a just and observant mind. He possessed application; he was capable of giving sound advice on all subjects, and he did give it on important occasions. But he was frequently led away by illusions, or stopped by the scruples of an upright mind. He would sometimes fain have willed what was impossible, and he dared not will what was necessary; for it requires a great mind to calculate how much is due to circumstances without detriment to principles. Speaking well, and possessing extraordinary firmness, he was of great service when support was needed for good opinions, and he was very useful to the Directory from his personal consideration.\n\nThe part which he acted among colleagues who detested each other was extremely useful. Among the four directors, he entertained a decided preference in favour of the most honest and the most capable, namely Rewbel. Yet, from independence and prudence, he had avoided any close connection, which he would have preferred, but which would have estranged him from his other colleagues. He was not without a leaning towards Barras, and would have cultivated his acquaintance, if he had found him more sincere and less depraved. He acquired a certain ascendancy over his colleague, from his high character, his penetration, and his firmness. The dissolute take pleasure in scoffing at virtue, but they dread it when, with the penetration which fathoms them, it combines the courage that is above being afraid of them. Larévellière used his influence over Rewbel and Barras to keep them in harmony with one another and with Carnot. Owing to this mediator, and owing also to their zeal for the interests of the republic, these directors lived on tolerable terms together, and prosecuted their task, divided with respect to the questions which they had to decide much more by their real opinions than by their animosities.\n\nWith the exception of Barras, the directors resided with their families, each occupying apartments in the Luxembourg. They did not live in an expensive style. Larévellière, indeed, who was fond of company, and of the arts and sciences, and who deemed it his duty to spend his salary in a manner useful to the state, admitted to his house scientific and literary men, but he treated them with simplicity and cordiality. He had unfortunately exposed himself to some ridicule, but without having in any way contributed to it. He adhered in every respect to the philosophy of the eighteenth century, as expressed in the profession of faith of the Savoyard vicar. He wished for the fall of the Catholic religion, and he flattered himself that a speedy end would be put to it, if governments had the prudence to employ against it no other weapons than indifference and disregard. He wished for no superstitious ceremonies, no material images of the Deity; but he conceived that public meetings were requisite for men, at which they might edify themselves with discourses on moral subjects and on the wonders of the creation. These subjects, in fact, ought to be discussed in assemblies, because men there are more easily wrought upon, and more accessible to elevated and generous sentiments. These ideas he had developed in a publication, and he had said that it would be well some day to supersede the ceremonies of the Catholic worship by meetings like those of the Protestants, but more simple and more free from formality. This idea, caught up by some benevolent minds, was immediately carried into execution.\n\nA brother of Haüy, the celebrated geologist, formed a society which he called the Society of the Theophilanthropists, whose meetings embraced moral exhortations, philosophical lectures, and pious hymns. More than one society of this kind was formed. They assembled in halls hired at their own expense, and under the superintendence of the police. Though Larévellière approved of this institution, and deemed it capable of drawing from the Catholic churches many of those tender consciences which feel a need of pouring forth their religious sentiments in common, he took care that neither himself nor his family should ever appear there, lest he should acquire the character of the leader of a sect, and provoke a comparison with the pontificate of Robespierre. In spite of Larévellière’s reserve, malignity seized this pretext to throw some ridicule on a magistrate universally honoured, and who afforded no handle for calumny. For the rest, if Theophilanthropism was the subject of some poor jokes in Barras’s parties, or in the royalist journals, it attracted at the time but little notice, and did not in the least diminish the respect which Larévellière-Lepeaux enjoyed.{4}\n\nIf any one of the directors really detracted from the consideration of the government, it was Barras. He did not live in the same simple and modest manner as his colleagues. He displayed a luxury and a prodigality for which his participation in the profits of men of business could alone account. The finances were directed with strict probity by the directorial majority and by the excellent minister Ramel; but they could not prevent Barras from receiving from the contractors, or the bankers whom he supported with his influence, a very considerable share of their profits. He had a thousand other ways of supplying his extravagance. France had become the arbitress of so many states, great and small, that many princes were glad to seek her favour, and to pay large sums for the promise of a voice in the Directory. We shall see by and by what was attempted in this way. The display which Barras made might not in itself have been useless, for the chiefs of a state ought to associate much with men, in order to study them, to learn their characters, and to make a proper choice of them; but he surrounded himself not only with men of business, but with intriguers of all sorts, dissolute women, and rogues. A scandalous grossness prevailed in his saloons. Those clandestine connections, over which, in well-regulated society, people strive to throw a veil, were publicly avowed. His visitors went to Gros-Bois to indulge in orgies, which furnished the enemies of the republic with powerful arguments against the government. Barras himself was not anxious to conceal any part of his conduct, and, according to the custom of debauchees, he was fond of proclaiming his excesses. He would himself relate before his colleagues his exploits at Gros-Bois and the Luxembourg, for which they sometimes severely reproached him. He would tell them how he had forced a celebrated contractor of that day to take a mistress of whom he began to be tired, and whose extravagance he could no longer supply; how he had revenged himself upon the Abbé Poincelin, a newspaper writer, for some personal invectives against him; and how, after enticing him to the Luxembourg, he had made his servants give him a flogging. This conduct, such as one would expect from an ill-bred prince, was in a republic extremely prejudicial to the Directory, and would have deprived it of all respect, had not the high reputation and the virtues of Carnot and Larévellière counterbalanced the ill effect of the excesses of Barras.\n\nThe Directory, instituted the day after the 13th of Vendémiaire, formed in hatred of counter-revolution, composed of regicides, and furiously attacked by the royalists, could not but be warmly republican. But each of its members participated more or less in the opinions that divided France. Larévellière and Rewbel possessed that moderate but rigid republicanism, which was as adverse to the violent proceedings of 1793 as to the royalist excesses of 1795. To gain them over to the counter-revolution was impossible. The unerring instinct of the parties taught them that from such men nothing was to be obtained either by seductions or by newspaper flatteries. Accordingly, they had nothing but the severest censure to bestow on those two directors. As for Barras and Carnot, they were in a different predicament. Barras, though he met every body, was in reality an ardent revolutionist. The faubourgs held him in high esteem, and had not forgotten that he had been the general of Vendémiaire. The conspirators of the camp of Grenelle had reckoned upon him. Accordingly, the patriots loaded him with praise; and the royalists, for the same reason overwhelmed him with invectives. Some secret agents of royalism, brought in contact with him by a common spirit of intrigue, might indeed, calculating upon his depravity, conceive some hopes; but this was an opinion which they kept to themselves. The mass of the party abhorred and attacked him with fury.\n\nCarnot, ex-Mountaineer, formerly member of the committee of public welfare, and who after the 9th of Thermidor had well-nigh fallen a victim to the royalist reaction, ought certainly to be a decided republican, and he really was so. At the first moment of his entrance into the Directory, he had strongly supported the appointment of all persons selected from among the Mountaineer party; but, by degrees, in proportion as the terrors of Vendémiaire subsided, his dispositions had changed. Carnot, even in the committee of public welfare, had never liked the herd of the turbulent revolutionists, and had powerfully contributed to destroy the Hébertists. On seeing Barras, who was anxious to continue king of the canaille, surround himself with the relics of the Jacobin party, he had become hostile to that party; he had displayed great energy in the affair of the camp of Grenelle, and so much the more as Barras was compromised in that rash attempt. Nor was this all. Carnot was annoyed by recollections. The charge preferred against him of having signed the most sanguinary acts of the committee of public welfare tormented him. In his estimation, the very natural explanations which he had given were not sufficient; he would have wished to prove by all means that he was not a monster; and he was capable of many sacrifices to prove this. Parties know everything, guess everything; they are not difficult in regard to persons, unless when they are victorious; but, when they are vanquished, they recruit themselves in all possible ways and are particularly careful to flatter the chiefs of armies. The royalists were soon aware of Carnot’s dispositions in regard to Barras and the patriot party. They had discovered his anxiety to reinstate himself in the good opinion of the public; they were aware of his military importance, and they took care to treat him differently from his colleagues, and to speak of him in the manner which they knew to be most likely to touch him. Hence, while the herd of their journals had nothing but gross abuse for Barras, Larévellière, and Rewbel, they had nothing but praise for the ex-Mountaineer and regicide, Carnot. In gaining Carnot, they would have Letourneur, and thus they should make sure of two voices by a vulgar artifice, but a potent one, like all those which address themselves to self-love. Carnot had the weakness to yield to this kind of seduction; and, without ceasing to follow his internal convictions, he formed with his friend Letourneur a kind of opposition in the Directory, somewhat like that which the new third formed in the two Councils. On all questions, in fact, on which the Directory had to deliberate, he pronounced in favour of the opinion adopted by the opposition. Thus, on all questions relative to peace and war, he voted for peace, after the example of the opposition, which affected continually to demand it. He had strongly recommended that the greatest sacrifices should be made to the Emperor, and that peace should be signed with Naples and Rome, without insisting on too rigorous conditions.\n\nNo sooner have such discordances broken out than they make rapid progress. The party desirous of profiting by them bestows the most extravagant praise on those whom it wishes to gain, and pours a torrent of censure on the others. These tactics had been attended with their usual success. Barras and Rewbel, already enemies to Carnot, hated him still more for the praise which was lavished upon him, and imputed to him the severity with which they were themselves attacked. Larévellière strove in vain to appease these animosities; but discord nevertheless made baneful progress. The public, apprised of what was passing, divided the Directory into majority and minority, classing Larévellière, Rewbel, and Barras, in the former, and Carnot and Letourneur in the latter.\n\nThe ministers also were classed. As people made a point of finding fault with the direction of the finances, they fell foul of Ramel, the minister, an excellent public functionary, who was obliged by the distressed state of the exchequer to resort to expedients censurable at any other time, but inevitable under the existing circumstances. The taxes came in but slowly, owing to the terrible irregularities in the collection. It had been found necessary to reduce the land-tax, and the indirect contributions yielded much less than had been expected. There were frequently no funds whatever in the Exchequer: and, in these emergencies, the funds of the ordinary expenses, were taken to defray those which were extraordinary, or the government anticipated the receipts, and made all the absurd and onerous bargains to which situations of this kind give rise. An outcry against abuses and peculations was then raised, whereas, on the contrary, it was the government that needed assistance. Ramel, who performed the duties of his office with equal integrity and intelligence, was the butt of every attack, and was treated as an enemy by all the newspapers. It was the same with Truguet, the minister of the marine, well-known as a frank republican, as a friend of Hoche’s, as a supporter of all the patriot officers; the same with Delacroix, the minister for foreign affairs, capable of forming a good administrator, but a bad diplomatist, too pedantic, and too rude in his intercourse with the ministers of foreign powers; the same with Merlin, who, in his administration of justice, displayed all the fervour of a Mountaineer republican. As for Benezech, Pétiet, and Cochon, the ministers of the interior, of war, and of the police, they were classed entirely by themselves. Benezech had sustained so many attacks from the Jacobins for having proposed to restore a free trade in articles of consumption, and to cease to supply Paris with provisions, that he had become agreeable on account of them to the counter-revolutionary party. An able public functionary, but trained under the old system, the overthrow of which he regretted, he partly deserved the favour of those who praised him. Pétiet, minister at war, acquitted himself ably of his functions; but being a creature of Carnot’s, he shared precisely the same fate as the latter with the contending parties. As for Cochon, he was also recommended by his connection with Carnot, and since the discovery which he had made of the plots of the Jacobins, and the zeal which he had shown in prosecuting them, he had won the favour of the opposite party, which praised him with affectation.\n\nNotwithstanding these disagreements, the government was still sufficiently united to rule with vigour, and to prosecute with glory its operations against the powers of Europe. The opposition was still repressed by the conventional majority remaining in the legislative body. The elections, however, were approaching, and the moment was at hand when a new third, chosen under the influence of the moment, would succeed another conventional third. The opposition flattered itself that it would then acquire the majority, and emerge from the state of submission in which it had lived. Accordingly, its language in the two councils became more lofty, and it betrayed its hopes. The members composing this minority met at Tivoli, to discuss their plans, and to concert their measures. This meeting of deputies had become a most violent club, known by the name of the club of Clichy. The journals participated in this movement. A great number of young men, who, under the old system would have composed scraps of poetry, declaimed, through fifty or sixty leaves, against the excesses of the Revolution, and against the Convention to which they imputed those excesses. They were, not finding fault, they said, with the republic, but with those who had imbrued its cradle in blood. The assemblies of electors were forming beforehand, and such were the means employed to influence their choice. In everything the language, the spirit, and the passions of Vendémiaire were manifested: the same sincerity and the same credulity in the mass, the same ambition in certain individuals, the same perfidy in certain conspirators labouring clandestinely in favour of royalty.\n\nThis royalist faction, always beaten, but always credulous and intriguing, was incessantly raising its head again. Wherever there is a pretension backed by some succour in money, there will be found intriguers ready to serve it by miserable projects. Though Lemaître had been condemned to death, La Vendée quelled, Pichegru deprived of the command of the army of the Rhine, the intrigues of the counter-revolution had not ceased: they were prosecuted on the contrary with extreme activity. The situations of all the royalist party were singularly changed. The Pretender, called by turns Count de Lille and Louis XVIII., had left Venice, as we have seen, to proceed to the army of the Rhine. He had stopped for a moment in the camp of the Prince of Condé, where an accident placed his life in jeopardy. Standing at a window, he was fired at and slightly grazed by the ball. This attempt, the author of which remained unknown, could not fail to be attributed to the Directory, which was not silly enough to pay for a crime that would have been profitable to the Count d’Artois alone. The Pretender did not stay long with the Prince of Condé. His presence in the Austrian army was disapproved of by the cabinet of Vienna, which had refused to recognise him, and was aware that his presence would only serve to aggravate the quarrel with France—a quarrel already too sanguinary and too expensive. An intimation was given him to depart, and on his refusal, a detachment was sent to enforce his compliance. He then retired to Blankenburg, where he continued to be the centre of all the correspondence. The Count d’Artois, after his vain schemes respecting La Vendée, had retired to Scotland, whence he still corresponded with some intriguers, going to and fro between La Vendée and England.\n\nLemaître being dead, his associates had taken his place, and succeeded him in the confidence of the Pretender. These were, as we have already seen, the Abbé Brottier, once a schoolmaster, Laville-Heurnois, formerly a master of requests, a Chevalier Despomelles, and a naval officer named Duverne de Presle.{5} The old system of these agents, stationed in Paris, was to do everything by the intrigues of the capital, while the Vendéans pretended to accomplish everything by armed insurrection, and the Prince of Condé by means of Pichegru. La Vendée being subdued, Pichegru doomed to retirement, and a threatening reaction breaking out against the Revolution, the Paris agents were the more fully persuaded that they ought to expect everything from a spontaneous movement of the interior. To control the elections, then by the elections to control the councils, by the councils the Directory and the high offices, seemed to them a sure way to re-establish royalty with the very means furnished them by the republic. For this purpose, however, it was necessary to put an end to that divergence of ideas which had always been seen in the plans of counter-revolution. Puisaye, who remained secretly in Bretagne, was dreaming there, as formerly, of an insurrection in that province. In Normandy M. de Frotté was striving to excite a rising similar to that which had taken place in La Vendée, but neither of them would have anything to do with the Paris agents. The Prince of Condé, duped in his intrigue with Pichegru upon the Rhine, wished still to carry it on by himself, without suffering the Austrians or the Pretender to have any hand in it, and he was sorry that he had let them into the secret. To give some unity to these incoherent projects, and more especially to obtain money, the Paris agents sent one of their number into the western provinces, England, Scotland, Germany and Switzerland. Duverne de Presle was the person selected for this mission. Being unable to deprive Puisaye of his command, they strove, by the influence of the Count d’Artois, to force him to join the system of the Paris agents, and to come to an arrangement with them. They obtained from the English the most important thing, some assistance in money. They procured powers from the Pretender, which placed all the intrigues under the direction of the Paris agency. Their messenger saw the Prince of Condé, who was not to be rendered either intelligent or manageable. He saw M. de Précy, who was still the secret promoter of the disturbances at Lyons and in the South. At last a general plan was concerted, which had no harmony or unity but upon paper, and which did not prevent everyone from acting in his own way, and agreeably to his personal interests and pretensions.\n\nIt was agreed that all France should be divided into two agencies, one comprising the East and the South, the other the North and the West. M. de Précy was to be at the head of the former, the Paris agents were to direct the latter. These two agencies were to arrange together all their operations, and to correspond directly with the Pretender, who was to give them his orders. Secret associations were planned on the model of those formed by Babœuf. They were to have no connection with one another, and to be kept ignorant of the names of the chiefs, that, if one of the parties were apprehended, this circumstance might not lead to the seizure of all the conspirators. These associations were to be adapted to the state of France. As it had been observed that the greater part of the population, without desiring the return of the Bourbons, wished for order and quiet, and imputed to the Directory the continuance of the revolutionary system, a sort of masonic society was formed, called the Philanthropists, who engaged to use their electoral rights, and to exercise them in favour of men opposed to the Directory. The Philanthropists were unacquainted with the secret aim of these proceedings, and nothing was to be avowed to them but the mere intention of strengthening the opposition. Another association, more secret, more concentrated, less numerous, and entitled the Faithful, was to be composed of those more resolute and devoted men, to whom the secret of the faction might be divulged. The Faithful were to be secretly armed and ready-for any coup-de-main. They were to enrol themselves in the national guard, which was not yet organised, and under cover of that uniform, to execute the more securely the orders that should be given them. It was to be their bounden duty, independently of every plan of insurrection, to watch the elections, and if the parties should come to blows, as had been the case in Vendémiaire, to fly to the assistance of the opposition party. The Faithful were to aid moreover in concealing emigrants and priests, in forging passports, in persecuting the revolutionists and the purchasers of the national domains. These associations were to be under the direction of military chiefs, who were to correspond with the two principal agencies and to receive orders from them. Such was the new plan of the faction, a chimerical plan, which history would disdain to record, did it not make us acquainted with the dreams with which parties feast themselves in their defeats. Notwithstanding this pretended unity, the association of the South did nothing more than produce some anonymous companies, acting without direction and without aim, and following only the inspiration of revenge and plunder. Puisaye, Frotté, and Rochecot in Bretagne and Normandy, laboured apart to make a new rising like that of Vendée, and disavowed the mixed counter-revolution of the Paris agents. Puisaye even published a manifesto, declaring that Bretagne would never second any plans which did not tend to restore by open force absolute and entire royalty to the family of Bourbon.\n\nThe Prince of Condé continued on his part to correspond directly with Pichegru, whose singular and absurd conduct nothing but the embarrassment of his situation can account for. This general, the only commander recorded in history to have voluntarily suffered himself to be beaten,{6} had himself demanded his dismissal. This conduct must appear surprising, for it was depriving himself of all means of influence, and consequently rendering it impossible for him to accomplish his pretended designs. We shall, nevertheless, have no difficulty to comprehend it, if we examine Pichegru’s position. He could not continue general, without at length putting in execution the plans which he had engaged to accomplish, and for which he had received considerable sums. Pichegru had before his eyes three examples, each very different from the others, that of Bouillé, that of La Payette, and that of Dumouriez, which proved to him that it was impossible to seduce a whole army. He wished, therefore, to put it out of his power to attempt anything; and this accounts for the offer of his resignation, which the Directory did not accept at first without regret, being wholly ignorant of his treason. The Prince of Condé and his agents were extremely surprised at the conduct of Pichegru, and conceived that he had swindled them out of their money, and that in reality he had never intended to serve them. But no sooner had he relinquished the command than he returned to the banks of the Rhine, upon pretext of selling his carriages, and then proceeded into the Jura, which was his native country. Thence he continued to correspond with the agents of the prince, to whom he represented his resignation as a profound combination. He should be considered, he said, as a victim of the Directory; he was going to connect himself with all the royalists of the interior, and to form an immense party; his army, in the command of which he was to be succeeded by Moreau, would deeply regret him, and, on the first reverse that it should sustain, it would not fail to call for its old general, and to revolt in order to obtain his reinstatement. He should take advantage of this moment to throw off the mask, hasten to his army, assume the dictatorship, and proclaim royalty. This ridiculous plan, had it been sincere, would have been thwarted by the success of Moreau, who, even during his famous retreat, had never ceased to be victorious. The Prince of Condé, the Austrian generals, to whom he had been obliged to communicate the secret, and Wickham, the English minister in Switzerland, began to believe that Pichegru had cheated them. They would have dropped the correspondence; but, at the earnest desire of the intermediate agents, who never like to have made a vain attempt, the correspondence was continued, to see whether any profit was to be derived from it. It was carried on through Strasbourg, by means of some spies, who crossed the Rhine, and proceeded to the Austrian general Klinglin; and through Basle with Wickham, the English minister. Pichegru stayed in the Jura without refusing or accepting the embassy to Sweden, which had been offered him, but striving to get himself elected deputy, paying the agents of the prince with the most wretched promises, and continually receiving considerable sums. He held out hopes of the most important results from his nomination to the Five Hundred; he boasted of an influence which he did not possess; he pretended to be giving the Directory perfidious advice and inducing it to adopt dangerous determinations; he attributed to himself the long resistance of Kehl, which, he said, he had recommended for the purpose of compromising the army. Very little faith was placed in these pretended services. The Count de Bellegarde wrote, We are in the situation of the gambler, who wishes to regain his money, and who goes on risking more to recover what he has lost. The Austrian generals continued, nevertheless, to correspond, because, if great designs were out of the question, they at least obtained valuable particulars concerning the state and the movements of the French army. The infamous agents of this correspondence sent to General Klinglin such statements and plans as they could procure. During the siege of Kehl they had been continually indicating the points upon which the enemy’s fire might be directed with the greatest effect.\n\nSuch was then the miserable part performed by Pichegru. With an understanding not above mediocrity, he was cunning and wary, and had sufficient tact and experience to believe any plan of counter-revolution impracticable at the moment. His everlasting delays, and his fables to amuse the credulity of the prince’s agents, prove his conviction on this point; and his conduct in important circumstances will prove it still more clearly. He received, nevertheless, the price of the plans which he would not execute, and had the art to cause it to be offered to him without his asking for it.\n\nSuch, it is true, was the conduct of all the agents of royalism. They lied most impudently, boasted of an influence which they had not, and pretended to sway the most important persons, to whom frequently they had never spoken in their lives. Brottier, Duverne de Presle, and Laville-Heurnois, boasted that they had at their disposal a great number of the deputies in the two Councils, and gave assurances that they should have many more after the new elections. Such was not the fact. They had no communication except with Lemerer, the deputy, and one Mersan, who had been excluded from the legislative body by virtue of the law of the 3rd of Brumaire against the relatives of emigrants. By means of Lemerer they pretended to influence all the deputies belonging to the club of Clichy. They judged from the speeches and the votes of those deputies that they would probably applaud the restoration of the monarchy, and hence they deemed themselves authorized to assure the King of Blankenburg of their attachment and even of their repentance. These wretches imposed on this king, and calumniated the members of the club of Clichy. There were among them ambitious men, who were enemies of the Conventionalists, because the Conventionalists had the entire government in their hands, men exasperated against the Revolution, dupes who suffered themselves to be led, but very few men bold enough to think of royalty, and of sufficient capacity to labour usefully for its re-establishment. Yet it was upon such foundations that the agents of royalism built their projects and their promises!\n\nIt was England that furnished all the funds for the presumed counter-revolution. She sent from London to Bretagne the succour demanded by Puisaye. Wickham, the English minister in Switzerland, was directed to supply the two agencies of Lyons and Paris with money, and to send some direct to Pichegru, who, to use the language of the correspondence, was stowed away for great occasions.\n\nThe agents of the counter-revolution had the impudence to take the money of England and to laugh at her. They had agreed with the Pretender to receive her funds, without ever following any of her views, and without ever complying with any of her suggestions, which, they alleged, it was right to distrust. England was not their dupe, and felt for them all the contempt that they deserved. Wickham, Pitt, and all the English ministers, did not place the least reliance on the operations of these gentry, and had no hope whatever of a counter-revolution by their means. They needed restless spirits, who should disturb France, who should excite uneasiness by their projects, and who, without putting the government in real peril, should fill it with exaggerated apprehensions. To this object they cheerfully devoted a million or two per year. Thus the agents of the counter-revolution deceived themselves in supposing that they were deceiving the English. With all their determination to commit a swindling trick, they were unsuccessful. England never reckoned upon greater results than those which they were capable of producing.\n\nSuch were then the projects and the means of the royalist faction. Cochon, minister of the police, was acquainted with part of them: he knew that there were in Paris correspondents of the court of Blankenburg; for, in our long revolution, during which plots were incessantly succeeding one another, there is no instance of a conspiracy having remained unknown. He attentively watched their proceedings, surrounded them with spies, and waited for some decisive attempt on their part, that he might seize them with advantage. They soon furnished him with occasion for doing so. Agreeably to their notable plan of gaining over the authorities, they first thought of securing the military authorities of Paris. The principal forces of the capital consisted of the grenadiers of the legislative body, and those in the camp of Sablons. The grenadiers of the legislative body were a picked corps of twelve hundred men, whom the constitution had placed about the two Councils as a guard of safety and honour. Their commandant, Adjutant-general Ramel, was known for his moderate sentiments, and in the estimation of the silly agents of Louis XVIII. this was a sufficient reason to set .him down for a royalist. The armed force assembled at Sablons amounted to nearly twelve thousand men. The commander of this armed force was General Hatry, a brave man, whom they had no hope of gaining over. They turned their eyes to the colonel of the 21st dragoons, named Malo, who had so briskly charged the Jacobins at the time of their ridiculous attempt on the camp of Sablons. They argued respecting him as they did about Ramel, and because he had repulsed the Jacobins it was concluded that he would welcome the royalists. Brottier, Laville-Heurnois, and Duverne de Presle, sounded both of them, and made proposals, which were listened to and immediately denounced to the minister of the police. The latter enjoined Ramel and Malo to continue to lend an ear to the conspirators, in order to get at their whole scheme. Accordingly, they were encouraged to enter into a long development of their plans, their means, and their hopes, and another interview was appointed, at which they were to exhibit the powers that they had received from Louis XVIII. Advantage was to be taken of this opportunity for securing them. The interviews took place in the apartments occupied by Malo in the Military School. Gendarmes and witnesses were concealed in such a manner as to hear everything, and to be able to show themselves at a given signal. Accordingly, on the 11th of Pluviose, these wretched dupes attended, bringing with them the powers of Louis XVIII., and again detailed their plans. The interview over, they were just departing, when they were seized by the agents employed for the purpose and taken before the minister of the police. Messengers were immediately sent to their residences, and all their papers were secured in their presence. Among them were found letters which furnished sufficient proofs of the conspiracy, and in part revealed the details. It was seen, for example, that those gentry composed an entire government at their pleasure. They meant, for the moment, and till the return of the king from Blankenburg, to suffer part of the existing authorities to remain. Among others, they proposed to retain Benezech in the department of the interior and Cochon in that of the police: and, if the royalists should feel shy of the latter as a regicide, they designed to put M. Siméon or M. Portalis in his place. They meant, moreover, to give the superintendence of the finances to M. Barbé-Marbois, who, they said, possesses talents and information, and is reputed an honest man. They had, to be sure, not consulted Messrs. Portalis, Siméon, Benezech, Barbé-Marbois, and Cochon, to whom they were totally unknown; but they had disposed of them, as they were accustomed to do, without their knowledge, and on their presumed opinions.\n\nThe discovery of this plot produced a strong sensation, and proved that it behoved the republic to be continually upon its guard against its old enemies. It excited a positive astonishment in the whole of the opposition, which tended to royalism without being aware of it, and which was not at all in the secret. This astonishment proved how those wretches boasted when they sent assurances to Blankenburg that they had at their disposal a great number of the members of both Councils. The Directory proposed to give them up immediately to a military commission. They denied its competence, asserting that they had not been taken in arms or making any attempt by main force. Several deputies, united in sentiment to their cause, supported them in the Councils; the Directory, nevertheless, persisted in sending them to a military commission for trial, because they had attempted to seduce military officers.\n\nTheir system of defence was plausible enough. They avowed their quality of agents of Louis XVIII., but declared that they had no other commission than to prepare the public opinion, and to expect from that alone, and not from force, a return to monarchical ideas. They were condemned to death, but their punishment was commuted to that of imprisonment, in consequence of the revelations of Duverne de Presle. The latter made a long confession to the Directory, which was inserted in the secret register, and in which he disclosed all the intrigues of the royalists. The Directory abstained from publishing these details, lest it should apprise the conspirators that it was acquainted with their whole plan. Duverne de Presle gave no information concerning Pichegru, whose intrigues, being carried on directly with the Prince of Condé, were unknown to the Paris agents; but he declared vaguely from hearsay that attempts had been made to gain partisans in one of the principal armies.\n\nThis apprehension of their chief agents might have thwarted the intrigues of the royalists, if they had had a well-combined plan; but, as each of them proceeded in his own way, the arrest of Brottier, Laville-Heurnois, and Duverne de Presle, did not prevent M. de Puisaye and M. de Frotté from intriguing in Normandy and in Bretagne, M. de Précy at Lyons, and the Prince of Condé in the army of the Rhine.\n\nAbout the same time, Babœuf and his accomplices were brought to trial: they were all acquitted, excepting Babœuf and Darthé, who underwent the punishment of death.{7}\n\nThe most important affair was that of the elections. Out of opposition to the Directory, or from royalism, a great number of persons were taking pains to influence them. In the Jura, great efforts were made to secure the return of Pichegru; at Lyons, that of M. Imbert-Colomés, one of the agents of Louis XVIII. in the South; and at Versailles, that of M. de Vauvilliers, who was seriously compromised .in the recently-discovered plot. Everywhere, in short, exertions were making in behalf of persons hostile to the Directory. In Paris, the electors of the Seine had met to concert their nominations. They proposed to ask the candidates the following questions: Hast thou purchased national domains? Art thou a newspaper writer? Hast thou written, acted, or done anything during the Revolution? All who should answer these questions in the affirmative were to be considered as ineligible. Such preparations showed how violent was the reaction against all those who had taken part in the Revolution. A hundred journals declaimed with vehemence, and actually stunned the public mind. The Directory had no means of repressing them but the law which awarded the punishment of death to writers advocating the return to royalty. No judges would ever have consented to the enforcement of so cruel a law. It applied for the third time to the two Councils for new legislative enactments, which were again refused. It proposed also to make the electors take an oath of hatred to royalty. A warm discussion took place concerning the efficacy of the oath, and the proposal was modified by changing the oath into a mere declaration. Every elector was to declare that he was an enemy to anarchy as well as to royalty. The Directory, without descending to any of the disgraceful means so frequently employed by representative governments for influencing elections, contented itself with choosing as commissioners to the assemblies men known for their republican sentiments, and setting Cochon, the minister, to write circulars, in which he recommended to the electors the candidates of its choice. A great outcry was raised against these circulars, which were only an insignificant exhortation, and by no means an injunction; for the number and independence of the electors, especially in a government in which almost all places were elective, placed them above the reach of the influence of the Directory.\n\n\"While preparations were thus making for the elections, the choice of a new director also excited great discussion. The question was, which of the five should be designated by lot to quit the Directory; whether it should be Barras, Rewbel, or Larévellière-Lepeaux, the opposition made sure, with the assistance of the new third, of carrying the nomination of a director of its choice. It hoped that it should then have a majority in the government; on which point it flattered itself egregiously, for its follies would not have failed very soon to make Carnot and Letourneur its enemies.\n\nThe club of Clichy turbulently discussed the choice of the new director. Cochon and Barthélemy were there of proposed. Cochon had lost somewhat in the opinion of the counter-revolutionists since the apprehension of Brottier and his accomplices, and especially since his circulars to the electors. They preferred Barthélemy, our ambassador in Sweden, whom they believed to be secretly connected with the emigrants and the Prince of Condé.\n\nAmidst this agitation, the most absurd reports were propagated. It was said that the Directory intended to apprehend the deputies just elected, and to prevent their assembling; it was even asserted that it meant to put them to death. Its friends, on their part, declared that an act of accusation was preparing against it at Clichy, and that the framers were only waiting for the new third in order to submit it to the Five Hundred.\n\nSTATE OF EUROPE IN 1797 (YEAR V.)—MARCH OF BONAPARTE AGAINST THE ROMAN STATES; PEACE OF TOLENTINO WITH THE POPE—NEW CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE AUSTRIANS—PASSAGE OF THE TAGLIAMENTO; BATTLE OF TARVIS; PASSAGE OF THE JULIAN ALPS; MARCH UPON VIENNA—PASSAGE OF THE RHINE AT NEUWIED AND AT DIRSHEIM—PRELIMINARIES OF PEACE SIGNED AT LEOBEN—PERFIDY OF THE VENETIANS; MASSACRE OF VERONA; DOWNFALL OF THE REPUBLIC OF VENICE.\n\nWHILE the contending parties were bestirring themselves in expectation of an event which was to alter the majorities, and to change the direction of the government of the republic, a new campaign was preparing, and everything indicated that it would be the last. The powers were divided nearly in the same manner as in the preceding year. France, united with Spain and Holland, had to struggle against England and Austria. The sentiments of the court of Spain were not, and could not be, favourable to the French republicans; but its policy, directed by the Prince of the Peace, was entirely favourable to them. She considered their alliance as the surest means of being protected against their principles, and justly flattered herself that they would not desire to revolutionise her, so long as they should find in her a powerful naval auxiliary. Besides, she bore an old grudge against Austria, and hoped that the union of all the navies of the continent would furnish her with the means of avenging her injuries. The Prince of the Peace, seeing that his existence depended on this policy, and aware that he must perish along with it, employed all his influence with the queen to secure it the ascendancy over the sentiments of the royal family, and his efforts were completely successful. The consequence of these dispositions was that the French were individually ill-treated in Spain, while the government, on the contrary, obtained the utmost deference to its wishes. Unfortunately, the French legation there did not behave with the respect due to a friendly power, or with the firmness requisite for protecting French subjects. Spain, by allying herself with France, had lost the important colony of Trinidad. She flattered herself that, if France should this year get rid of Austria, and turn all her forces against England, all the advantages gained by the latter might be wrested from her. The queen, in particular, flattered herself with an aggrandisement in Italy for her son-in-law, the Duke of Parma. There was an idea also of an enterprise against Portugal, and, amidst that vast convulsion of states, the court of Madrid was not without some hope of uniting the whole of the Peninsula under one sceptre.\n\nAs for Holland, her situation was very deplorable. She was torn by all the passions that a change of constitution excites. The rational persons who wished for a government in which the old federative system should be combined with the unity necessary for giving strength to the Batavian republic, had to combat three equally dangerous parties: in the first place, the Orangists, comprising all the creatures of the stadtholder, the placemen, and the populace; secondly, the federalists, including all the wealthy and powerful families, who were desirous of maintaining the former state of things, with the exception of the stadtholdership, which wounded their pride; lastly, the decided democrats, a turbulent, daring, and implacable party, composed of hot-headed persons and adventurers.
