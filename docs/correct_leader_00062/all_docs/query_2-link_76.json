        "text": "In the history of the fine arts in Tunisia, the opening exhibition of the Galerie de l’art nouveau in 1936 marks an important date.2 For the first time, artists showed their work in a space that they themselves managed. Located at No. 5 Rue St-Charles,3 right in the heart of the modern city, their gallery occupied premises that a few years earlier had housed La Boutique d’art, a gallery set up by the art dealer Charles Boccara. In this initiative that brought together two artists that had already acquired some financial security and capital of recognition, Moses Levy (1885-1961) and Pierre Boucherle (1894-1988), and two promising young artists, Jules Lellouche (1903-1963) and Antonio Corpora (1909-2004), each showing four paintings, La Dépêche tunisienne, the main local daily newspaper, saw a “timely replica of the studio exhibition spaces in which the Parisian critics and the capital’s eclectic and enlightened art lovers [took] pride”4 (fig. 1). For the journalist, in the field of painting, as for all of the arts, the real point of reference is Paris, in spite of the proximity of Italy.5\n\nOn the occasion of this first exhibition, the four artists drew up a manifesto, explicitly based on those of the European avant-gardes.6 It begins: “We are opening the doors of this Gallery to avantgarde Tunisian and foreign artists.”7 Here, the only reference to nationality concerns the country in which these artists live and work—Tunisia—with membership of the avant-garde movement transcending national borders. There is no mention of France, nor of Italy. Indeed, this exhibition is generally regarded as being the starting point of what fifteen years later would be called the École de Tunis, a term coined with reference to the École de Paris,8 and about which Pierre Boucherle, who presented himself as its founder, stated in 1964 that it “never had the pretension, nor even the intention, to place itself as a school of art on the same level as, for example, the schools of French, Spanish, Italian or Flemish painting. Its aim was to bring together some of the best painters in Tunis, without distinction of movement, race or religion.”9 However, the narrative of the journalist from the La Dépêche tunisienne who reports on the 1936 exhibition is diﬀerent. He refers to the nationalities of the exhibitors, and for three of them, finds in the national origins a key to understanding their works. Moses Levy, who was presented as the eldest of them who was already famous but constantly experimenting, escaped this categorisation, no doubt because his status of having the protection of the British government while being culturally Italian and French made him diﬃcult to categorise. But Boucherle’s art is described in terms of its character that is “French, and more specifically Latin, [which] feels the need for logical construction. He seeks to organise his sensations into a rigorous architectonic simplicity.” Corpora “is Italian, and his painting aspires to order and Mediterranean clarity. His logicality, his need for the deflnite are in conflict with his southern nature, and out of this contrast between order and instinct is born his pictorial drama.” Lellouche, who was Tunisian, is for his part associated with Africa: “He is perhaps the only painter who expresses himself as an authentic African. His art is fed by sensations rather than visions. Sensuality sometimes prevails over sensibility, instinct over creative logic, and it is then that his painting appears rather impressionist to us.” This discrepancy between the aﬃrmation by the artists of an avant-garde both rooted in Tunisia and open to the world that was free of national categorisation and a national reading of the works by the press invites us to think about the diﬀerent uses of national references in the artistic production and the narratives that accompanied it in Tunisia over the course of the century preceding the aﬃrmation, at the start of the 1950s, of an “École de Tunis” expected to develop an aesthetic repertoire capable of expressing the elements constituting “Tunisianness” (Nakhli 178).\n\nFigure 1\n\nTo do this, we will go back to the first indications of a taste for cadres,10 those paintings that decorated the Bey and his ministers’ palaces from the 1840s onwards, before the Regency was occupied by the French army in 1881. We will then assess the actions in the field of art of those promoting a francisation of the country, based on the Algerian model, and their limits, symbolised by the failure of a plan to set up a French museum. Lastly, we will discuss the aﬃrmation of a shared Latin identity linking France and Italy, before and after the First World War, that took on a wider dimension under the aegis of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe spread of the fashion for paintings from Europe without a specific national flavour\n\nPaintings constituted a new element of interior decoration that became more widespread in the palaces of Tunis from the 1840s onwards. While the artists producing them were in most cases from France or Italy, nothing indicates that a specific national identity was clearly associated with them. The diplomatic adviser of Bey Ahmad I, Giuseppe Raﬀo, who was Italian, doubtless contributed to the development of this new taste in Tunisia’s Regency. He went regularly to Europe, to Turin, Milan, Florence, Paris and London, visiting the public collections there.11 In the drawing rooms of his palace in Tunis, in Rue Zarkoun, near to the fonduk of the French on the edge of the medina, could be found full-length portraits that he had had painted in Paris—including his own portrait by Charles Gleyre, now held in the collections of the Tunisian Government, probably painted in early 184312 (fig. 2)—and “Raphael’s madonnas that he liked most” that he had “had copied at the Uﬃzi”13 (Winckler 162).\n\nSome fifteen years later, the inscription added around 1859 at the bottom of a portrait of Bey Muhammad al-Sâdiq, “Simil. Calligaris. et compagnie,” attests to this fluidity. We can see in it the indication that the work, started in Tunis by a French painter from Nîmes, Louis Simil (1822-April 1896?),14 was completed by the Piedmontese Luigi Calligaris (1808-1870), the director of the Regency’s new military school, with help from pupils at the institution.15 Having spent his early life in Piedmont, which had been annexed by the French Empire, and travelled to Istanbul to work in the service of the Ottoman sultan, Luigi Calligaris was called to Tunis as early as 1833, with the task of instructing the beylical troops, in the context of the tanzimât reforms. He had helped to introduce to Tunis the practice of technical drawing, which was useful for military architecture, but also documentary and artistic drawing.16\n\nWhile we find in the sources at that time the epithets “French” or “Italian” to describe works, it is with reference to decorative techniques or the choice of subject, rather than a clearly defined national identity. The largest room in the Bardo Palace was known in 1857 as the “salon français” on account of the “many paintings depicting the major battles of the Empire”, which, according to the consul Léon Roches, decorated it.17 A few years later, the journalist Léon Michel stated that the ceilings of the Khéreddine Palace in La Manouba were, as in other palaces built at that time, “decorated with paintings à l’italienne” (214). In these recent buildings, “the old style of arabesques” had been abandoned in favour of “flat paintings produced by Italian artists”. They reminded Léon Michel, “in their style and their bright colours of the kind that was favoured in France at the beginning of the nineteenth century” (218).\n\nAmong the artists the court commissioned paintings from, the majority of them were probably French. After the portrait of Bey Ahmad produced in 1846 by Charles Larivière during the sovereign’s stay in Paris, a portrait whose replica, given by King Louis-Philippe to its model in Tunis, was on display at the Bardo Palace, it was from Auguste Moynier (1813-1865) that Bey Muhammad al-Sâdiq commissioned his portrait. Born in Genoa, with links to the military, Moynier had some characteristics in common with Calligaris. The diﬀerence was that he had trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris: a copy that he did of the portrait of Napoleon III by Winterhalter, sent to Tunis in 1856, no doubt convinced the Bey of his talent. If a certain kind of painting practised in Paris, of which the commission given by the beylical house in late 1866 to the young Alfred Couverchel, a pupil of Horace Vernet, was an example, seems to have been particularly appreciated in Tunis, we are tempted to say that this style had an international rather than national dimension, and responded to a taste that transcended European borders. The Italian painters probably remained the most numerous to be active in the Regency:18 it is generally considered that Ahmad ‘Usmân (1848-1920), who is regarded as the first “Tunisian painter”, owed his training to them.19\n\nThe continuation of the close ties between Tunis’s Ottoman elites and the empire’s capital after the establishment of the French protectorate (Tunger-Zanetti) invites us to put forward the hypothesis that, until 1914, the practices in use in Istanbul continued to serve as a model in the Regency of Tunis. The fact that in Istanbul, as in Tunis, there were many Italian and French painters (Orhun Gültekin) might support this. On the one hand, it was the court painter Fausto Zonaro that Sultan Abdülhamîd II called on in 1907 to make a copy of the famous portrait in oil of Sultan Mehmed II, painted in 1480 by the Venetian Gentile Bellini.20 But on the other hand, the prestige of Paris as a place to train in the fine arts was high in the empire’s capital: following Osman Hamdi bey (Eldem), it was to Paris, in the studios of Jean-Paul Laurens and probably Georges Rochegrosse,21 that Muhammad al-Hâdî (1872-1922) went to train. Al-Hâdî was one of the sons of the former minister of Bey Khayr ad-dîn bâchâ (the latter, having been removed from power in Tunis in 1877, had settled with his family in Istanbul, where he held the post of grand vizir between December 1878 and July 1879). Muhammad al-Hâdî found himself forced to leave Istanbul after the coup d’état by the Committee of Union and Progress in January 1913, and settled in the outskirts of Tunis, in Sidi Bou Said, where he died in 1922 (Zmerli).\n\nFigure 2\n\nBringing works by French artists to Tunis to set up a museum (1892-93)\n\nHowever, the situation began to change following the occupation of Tunisia by the French army and the establishment of a protectorate. France’s taking control of the country was accompanied by a movement calling for its colonisation and francisation, along the lines of Algeria, and the new authorities saw the promotion of French art in Tunisia as a means to achieve this goal. It was against this backdrop that in 1886 the plan emerged to set up a French museum in Tunis (“Un musée impossible”?). The man behind the project was a “progressive republican”,22 Georges de Dramard (1838-1900), a well-known figure in Paris, who, since 1868, had regularly shown his paintings at the Salon.23 In 1885, he founded a Société française des amis des arts, which was close to the administration in charge of the fine arts. The project, which was never completed, resulted in around thirty artists who regularly took part in the exhibition of the Société des artistes français, which in 1881 succeeded the Salon parisien, giving one of their works to the French government, in order to build up the museum’s collections, with a view to eventually securing private or public commissions in Tunis.24 But were the thirty or so works sent in 1892-93 the expression of a specifically French art?25 In large part, yes. With one exception, all of the artists that sent one of their works were French.26 In most cases, the works’ titles make reference to France, whether geographically, historically or in literary terms (this is the case for twenty-one out of the thirty-five), never to another country, except for a view of Venice. This is true for the landscapes, which make up almost half of the works sent and which for the most part are precisely located: in Brittany (two), in Normandy (two), on the Atlantic coast (two), on the Mediterranean coast (one), in central France (three), the area surrounding Paris (three) or Paris itself (one). But it is also true for the genre scenes, whether they refer to a literary work (Donkey Skin, one of the stories by Charles Perrault), the French Revolution (Mass for the dead in the Morbihan in 1793), the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 (Refugees. Episode from the siege of Paris; Fighting in a street in Champigny), or the present day (Evening of 14 July; The Deck of the liner La Touraine). Finally, it is true for the only portrait sent, that of Cardinal Lavigerie, a copy based on an engraving of the portrait made in 1888 by Léon Bonnat. Thus, these works dispatched to Tunis were intended to promote “French” artists and art, although this French character did not correspond to a clearly defined aesthetic, as with the works exhibited at the Salon des artistes français. Did this initiative embarked on by a Frenchman in a colonial perspective, albeit cut short, have a degree of eﬀectiveness in promoting a specifically French art and the development of a taste for it? Were the works seen and did they capture people’s imaginations? It is diﬃcult to ascertain. We know that some of them, as they could not be shown to the public within the framework of a museum, were exhibited at the first Salon tunisien, in 1894.27 Others were displayed more permanently in places frequented by a particular section of the public: it was to the archbishop’s palace that the residence-general sent the Mass for the dead in the Morbihan in 1793 (Vendémiaire Year II) by Charles Coëssin de la Fosse (1829-1910).28\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 4\n\nAnd it was the oﬃcers of the military circles in Tunis and Sfax who were assigned the denuded female figures of Sleep by Pierre Franc-Lamy (1855-1919)29 and Donkey Skin slipping her ring into the cake by Albert Maignan (1845-1908)(fig. 4),30 as well as a patriotic scene (The Refugees. Episode from the siege of Paris, by Alfred de Richemont (1857-1911)31 and a landscape (The Town of Argenton [sur Creuse] by Mario Carl-Rosa (1853-1913). The pupils of the boys’ school in Tunis could contemplate the Regiment passing by Jean Jacques Baptiste Brunet (1849-1917), those at the girls’ school Girl among flowers by Louis-Maurice Pierrey (1854-1912).32 But we have no record of how these paintings were perceived. It is not certain that all of the members of a diverse French community, with families that had entered into the service of the Ottoman Regency, without the colonial perspective that asserted itself subsequently (Planel), identified with them; and it is possible that they may have oﬀended certain sensibilities among the population of the Regency. We may consider that The Republic standing by Philippe Félix Dupuis (1824-1888) had the widest audience, as the painting was dispatched to decorate the brand-new post and telegraphs oﬃce. But we have no elements that allow us to assess this.\n\nThrough the Salon and the Centre d’art: promoting an art open “to all periods, all schools and all countries”\n\nAfter 1894, while there was still talk of setting up a museum of fine arts in Tunis, it was no longer in the form of a “French museum”, but a museum “at once of fine arts, industrial arts and products of the Regency” (“Deuxième exposition artistique à Tunis” 291), i.e., a Tunisian museum. Similarly, it was under the name of “Salon tunisien” that in 1894 the art section of the Institut de Carthage established an annual fine arts exhibition, which took place on a regular basis from 1907 onwards. This annual exhibition was designed to show all of the Regency’s artistic output, without restriction (“The Annual Art Salons”; “Salons et expositions d'art industriel à Tunis (1896 et 1898)”; “Un Salon pour Tunis”). The rules for the 1894 exhibition were taken from those for the Salon des artistes français, stating in Article 3 that works would be seen there “relating to all periods, all schools and all countries” (“Chronique de l’Institut de Carthage” 308). Thus, Italian artists could be found there, albeit in small numbers.33 In its edition of 2 April 1897, for example, La Dépêche tunisienne welcomed the presence of the painter Gaetano Musso, from Palermo, hoping that “many Italian artists [would] now follow his example”.34 In the speech that he gave at the opening of the 1901 Salon tunisien, Eusèbe Vassel described Tunisia as a “hospitable land”, with the Salon making it possible to bring together the diﬀerent communities living there: the French, characterised by their taste for the ideal, “the generous combat for the exaltation and expansion of the Good, the Beautiful, the True […]; Italians […] who remember the Renaissance, when their forefathers heralded the greatest flourishing of Letters and the Arts; Tunisians too, eager to show that their countrymen are not more resistant to moral improvement than to material progress” (“Institut de Carthage.\n\nOuverture du 6e Salon tunisien” 368).35 This inclusive dimension was confirmed in 1913, when the organisation of the Salon was taken over by an activist from the French Section of the Workers’ International (Section française de l'Internationale ouvrière – SFIO), Alexandre Fichet (1881-1967), a teacher of drawing at the Collège Alaoui, a middle school attended by Muslim pupils, and at the teacher training college.36 Alexandre Fichet, who after the First World War was part of the editorial team of the newspaper Tunis socialiste, founded in 1921 by his brother-in-law André Duran-Angliviel, remained the organiser of the Salon tunisien between the wars, and then, on his return from being deported, from 1944 onwards. Thanks to his openness and the friendships that he built up with members of the Destourian Party (Abéasis), he contributed to the continuation of the annual exhibition through the upheavals of decolonisation by remaining its organiser until 1966.\n\nIn 1914, Fichet, who perhaps took as his model Paul Signac, the President of the Salon des indépendants since 1909, only referred to French artists when he said that he is convinced that they should present both the “output of experimenters, independents and ‘fauves’” alongside those “who uphold the wholesome traditions of the masters”, the role of reformers being to “safeguard the true tradition, protecting it from the very people who claim to perpetuate it” (“XVIe Salon tunisien” 283). Between the wars, it was Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres who was, together with Nicolas Poussin, one of the main figures of reference for the champions of a “French art” that was deemed to be threatened by cosmopolitanism and expressionism (Jarrassé 135), as well as Eugène Carrière, Claude Monet and Toulouse-Lautrec, for whom Fichet expressed admiration. But in 1923, he stated that he wished to “persuade our cosmopolitan population, divided by their origins, their tastes, their customs and their occupations, that Art is a welcoming homeland. The diﬀerences in race, emotion and expression constitute new sources of richness for this homeland and contribute to bringing it closer to universal and human truth, which is the only harmonious one”37 (“Le Salon tunisien. Discours de M. Fichet” 97). In a post-war climate of a return to order and national aﬃrmation, Fichet stated that the Salon tunisien was a melting pot devoid of national exclusiveness. By choosing the term “homeland” (patrie in French) traditionally used by the republican left, he was diﬀerentiating himself from the diﬀerent forms of nationalism, and perhaps already from the promoters of a competing salon, organised from the autumn of 1922, which in 1924 took the name of Salon des artistes tunisiens. An amateur artist, Alfred Combarel, and a former magistrate from Constantine, André Delacroix (1878-1934), a member of the Société coloniale des artistes français, were opposed to Fichet’s eclecticism and were soon joined, in 1930, by a former fellow student and friend of Fichet,38 Gaston-Louis Le Monnier (1880-1947), who railed against “the decadent European movement”.39 But their salon did not survive the death of André Delacroix. And the Exposition artistique de l’Afrique française, held annually from 1928 with the aim of asserting imperial unity across the north of the continent—Tunis was the first city to host it (it did so again in 1932, 1936 and 1941)—did not set diﬀerent selection criteria from those of the Salon tunisien. It fulfilled the same function in showing a varied range of works to the public,40 while Alexandre Fichet continued to attempt to make known the recent trends in painting in Paris, including works by foreign artists working there.41 The break between the two former students of the École Bernard Palissy was confirmed during the Second World War. While Fichet was deported to Sachsenhausen by the German authorities in 1942 (under house arrest in the Gers after a period of forced labour, he only returned to Tunis in the autumn of 1944), Gaston-Louis Le Monnier set up a trade union of professional artists (painters, sculptors and set designers) in Tunisia and organised two exhibitions in the spring and autumn of 1944. His memoirs suggest that he hardened in his conception of the French tradition in a way reminiscent of the evolution of the critic Camille Mauclair, who became a nationalist and anti-Semite having been close to the symbolists and anarchism and a Dreyfusard in his youth (Vaisse):\n\nCities like Tunis are somewhat contaminated by that decadent art that is rife in Paris, that international art of naturalised foreigners that has swamped all of the French traditions of painting, and which from time to time hangs from the end of a pole the eﬃgy of an innovator, like a paper lantern (Le Monnier 171).\n\nThe other important institution with respect to the fine arts in Tunis, the Centre d’art, was founded in 1922-23 (Lasram). Previously, only the drawing classes in primary and secondary schools and a few private workshops provided artistic training in the Regency. The Centre d’art therefore took over from the workshops of a pupil of Gérôme, Émile Pinchart (1842-1921), active between 1902 and 1913, Georges Le Mare (1866-1942), who went to be trained at the Académie Julian between 1900 and 1905, active between 1912 and 1916, and Joseph Buﬀard (1871-1937?), a former student at the École des Beaux-Arts in Lyon, where he had studied flower painting to cater to the needs of the silk industry (the decorative art class that he introduced in 1912 probably continued until the early 1920s). The Centre d’art, which only took the name of École des Beaux-Arts in 1930, likewise did not seek to impose a rigidly defined “French art” (“La fabrique des artistes ‘tunisiens’” 157-180). The entrance competition was open to all young people between the ages of sixteen and thirty, with no restrictions in terms of gender or nationality. The teaching programme followed the model of the Paris École des Beaux-Arts, where its director, Armand Vergeaud (1876-1949), had been a student.42 Vergeaud also regularly showed his work at the Salon tunisien, as many of the École’s students would soon go on to do. He shared with Fichet the idea that the diﬀerent types of artistic experimentation being conducted in France could be of interest in a country in which he considered there was no established tradition in the field of the fine arts. Among its students, the largest number were French, but there were also Tunisians and Italians, including Jules Lellouche, Antonio Corpora and Maurizio Valensi.43 The Parisian heritage and open-mindedness common to Vergeaud and Fichet meant that they helped to bring to Tunis an open conception of the world of art, without aesthetic or national exclusivism. In this respect, we may consider that they made possible the aﬃrmation of a group of artists that would soon be known by the name of the École de Tunis, as a local variant of an École de Paris open to contributions from foreign artists.\n\nInclusive references: from a Latin to a Mediterranean identity\n\nHowever, the situation of Tunis was very particular, due to the competition between France and Italy.44 From 1911, a view was expressed that called for a Latin Renaissance in the field of the fine arts. It was put forward by Henri Leca-Beuque (1884-1948), a teacher of literature at the École normale de Tunis (where he also taught Alexandre Fichet) who was from Philippeville in Algeria.45 It echoed that held by the man of letters Louis Bertrand (1866-1941), who was one of the originators of the Algerianist movement, with a somewhat diﬀerent tone.46 Indeed, Leca-Beuque diﬀerentiated himself from those who believed bitterly “that the disenchanted West [was] being choked to death by the all-powerful foreigners and Phoenicians”. He saw in the Latin Renaissance that he was calling for the fruit of Tunisia’s openness to foreign contributions, which would benefit Tunisia just as the Italian artists had benefited France in the sixteenth century. However, Leca-Beuque associated the development of “good taste” with French art. In his view, the preferences of “popular taste”, if they “did not go towards manifestations of French genius, would all too easily be inclined to favour foreign trends” (Leca-Beuque 15), although we do not know exactly what he was referring to here—perhaps standardised works such as the chromolithographs produced in Germany, Italy and the Middle East that could be found on sale at that time in Tunis.47\n\nThe promotion of a “Latin” art in Tunisia took on a new form between the wars, when relations between France and fascist Italy oscillated between mistrust and rapprochement. The Franco-Italian alliance, symbolised by the signature of the Rome Accords in January 1935, was cut short by Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia in October of that year and the victory of the Front populaire in France in the spring of 1936: in the autumn of that year the government led by Léon Blum recalled its ambassador from Rome.48 But a narrative emphasising a common Latin identity transcending national borders persisted. As we have seen, Pierre Boucherle, who had taken part in the exhibition of colonial art in Rome in 1932, and whose exhibition in Algiers in the spring of 1934 had been admired by the young Albert Camus,49 was characterised in 1936 by his Latin genius, while Corpora was associated with the Mediterranean.50 This definition of Latin identity was doubtless less exclusive than that of Alberto Savinio, for whom Roman culture had died out following the infiltration of Arab-Gothic influences.51 It opened up the idea of a common Mediterranean culture rather than being in opposition to it. The need for a broad inclusive category explains the success in Tunis of this concept which made it possible to encompass works associated with the Arab, Jewish and Berber worlds (Ruel 7-14; Fréris 43-51). The publication between 1927 and 1933 of a Revue méditerranéenne des lettres, des arts, des sciences under the editorship of Albert Canal indicates that it was in early use there.52\n\nThere was no compartmentalisation of the art world into a French one and an Italian one in interwar Tunisia. Pierre Boucherle and Henri Leca-Beuque were among the many French artists who exhibited at the Società Dante Alighieri, in the premises of the imposing building constructed in 1926 in Rue Thiers.53 The Italian cultural association was very active in these years in the area of art, oﬀering a class in drawing applied to arts and crafts and a rich programme of exhibitions that remained free of any indoctrination until 1938, even though, in May 1933, it was recommended that exhibitions should be collective ones and should exalt Italian identity54 (Finzi and Gallico 237-242). In May 1932, an exhibition of twelve “modern painters” attested to this freedom: there were only four Italians among them, Antonio Corpora, Frida Uzan (1906-?), Maurizio Valensi (1909-2009) and Aldo Ronco. The former three had been taught by Vergeaud at the Tunis École des Beaux-Arts, and the latter three had opposed the fascist regime, by way of involvement in the Communist Party in the case of Aldo Ronco and soon Maurizio Valensi,55 or a Livorno Jewish family tradition favourable to the Carbonari and Freemasonry in the case of Frida Uzan.56 Among the five French exhibitors were Alexandre Fichet and Pierre Boucherle. Jules Lellouche also took part in the exhibition, which included a Swiss painter living in Tunis, Wilhelm Lebherz Louis (1907?-1950) and a Dutchman, Gerardus Hendricus Huysser (1892-?).57"
