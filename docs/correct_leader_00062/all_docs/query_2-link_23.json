        "text": "ON PROPERTY.\n\nBOOK I.\n\nON THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY.\n\n[1]\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nORIGIN OF THE PRESENT CONTROVERSY.â©\n\nShowing how it has come to pass that property is called in question in our times.\n\nWHAT can have happened, that property, the natural instinct of man, child, and animal, the sole end and indispensable reward of labour, should be called in question ? What can have led to this aberration, unprecedented in any time ar country, not even at Rome, where the contests of the Agrarian Law concerned only the allotment of the lands conquered from the enemy ? What can have done it, we shall see in a few lines.\n\nTowards the close of the last rÃ©gime, the men who combatted the government of 1830 were divided into several classes. Some, unwilling to destroy, but on the contrary desirous to save, did not place the question in the form of that government, but in its course of proceeding. They demanded real liberty, a liberty guaranteeing the affairs of the commonwealth from the twofold influence of the court and of the streets, a wise [2] financial administration, a powerful organization of the public strength, a prudent but national policy. Others, either from conviction or from zeal, or delighting to distinguish themselves from those against whom they were contending, disliked the very form of the government ; and desired a republic, without daring to give utterance to their wishes. Of the latter, the most sincere consented to wait until the trial of the constitutional monarchy was complete, and they waited with the most perfect good faith. The most ardent, endeavouring to gain distinction even among the republicans, looked forward to a republic with greater impatience ; and, to frame a language for themselves, spoke continually of the interests of the people, interests forgotten, overlooked, and sacrificed. Others, seeking notoriety by still more striking signs, affected to despise all political discussions, called for a social revolution, and, even among the last, there were some who, having a more distant aim, desired a complete and absolute social revolution.\n\nThe quarrel became more envenomed as it was protracted ; and at length, when royalty, forewarned too late, would have been willing to transfer the power from one party to the other, in the midst of the general trouble it let the sceptre fall from its hands. It has been taken up. Those who are now its possessors, enlightened by the commencements of experience, are not eager to keep the imprudent engagements which many of them, however, never made. But those who have not the power, and whom no experience has enlightened, persist in demanding a social revolution. A social revolution ! To accomplish this, is it sufficient to will it ? If we had the strength, which may be sometimes acquired by agitating a suffering people, we must find the materials : we must have a society to reform. But if it has been reformed long since, what is to be done ? You emulate the glory of accomplishing a social [3] revolution ; be it so, but you are born sixty years too late ; you should have entered on your career in 1789. Without deceiving, without perverting the people, you would then have had the means of arousing their enthusiasm, and, after arousing, of sustaining it. In those times, every one did not pay taxes. The nobility contributed only a part, the clergy none at all, except when it pleased them to accord voluntary gifts. Every one did not suffer the same penalties for crime : there was the gibbet for some; for others there were a thousand ways of avoiding infamy or death, however richly deserved. All could not, whatever might be their talents, occupy public offices, being prevented some by birth, some by religion. There existed, under the name of feudal rights, a mass of dependences not having their origin in a contract freely entered into, but in a usurpation of the strong over the weak. The peasants were bound to bake their bread at their landlord's oven, grind their corn at his mill, buy exclusively in his markets, suffer the penalties inflicted in his (the manorial) court, and permit their harvests to be devoured by his game. The various trades could not be exercised but by admission into certain companies, and according to the rules laid down by them. Each province had its customs-frontier, with intolerable formalities, for levying the dues. The amount of these was overwhelming. Independently of the enormous estates devolved upon the clergy, an held by mortmain, the cultivators of the soil had pay, under the denomination of tithes, the greater portion of their produce. This concerned the rural population, and for the body of the nation there were censors for those who were tempted to write; the Bastille for the unmanageable ; parliaments for such as Labarre and Galas; [1] and intervals of centuries between the meetings of the StatesGeneral, which might have reformed so many abuses.\n\n[4]\n\nAccordingly, in the immortal night of the 4th of August, 1789, all classes in the nation, nobly represented in the Constituent Assembly, had the power of offering something in sacrifice on the altar of their country. [2] They all had in fact their gift to lay on it : the privileged classes their exemption from taxation, the clergy their wealth, the nobility their feudal rights and their titles, the provinces their separate constitutions. In a word, all classes had a sacrifice to offer, and they did so amidst a joy without example. This joy was, not the joy of a few, but the joy of all, —the joy of a people emancipated from vexations of every kind, —the joy of the third estate upraised from, its humiliation, —the joy even of the nobility, at that time keenly alive to the pleasure of doing good. It was an intoxication without bounds, —a kind of frenzy of humanity, inducing us to embrace the whole world in our ardent patriotism.\n\nFor some time past numerous attempts have been made to agitate the popular masses as much as possible. Has the outburst of 1789 been reproduced? Certainly not; and why? Because what has been done, can be done but once ; because in a second 4th of August we should not know what to sacrifice. Does there remain in any quarter a manorial oven or mill to be suppressed? Is there any game which you may not kill, when it comes on your grounds ? Are there any censors, other than an irritated multitude, or the dictatorship which is its representative? Are there any Bastilles ? Are there any disqualifications on account of religious creed or birth ? Is there any elevated post to which you may not aspire ? Is there any inequality beyond that of mind, which is not imputable to the law, or of fortune, which depends on the right of property ? Attempt, if you can, another 4th of August ; erect an altar to your country, and tell us what you will place on it. —Abuses ! [5] Certainly, there is no lack of abuses, and never will be. But a few abuses, on an altar raised to your country, under the open vault of heaven, it is too little ! You must bear other offerings. Seek, then, seek in that society broken up and reconstructed so frequently since '89, and I defy you to discover aught else to sacrifice but property. Accordingly this has not been overlooked, and it is the deplorable origin of the actual controversies on this subject.\n\nAll the partisans of a social revolution do not desire, it is true, to sacrifice property to the same degree. Some would abolish it entirely, others in part ; these would be content to remunerate labour in some other way, those would proceed by taxation. But all alike attack property to keep the kind of half-promise they have made to accomplish a social revolution. We must therefore combat all these odious, puerile, ridiculous, but disastrous systems ; sprung, like a swarm of insects, from the decomposition of all governments, and filling the atmosphere in which we live. Such is the origin of this state of things, which will entail upon us, even should society be saved, either the contempt or the compassion of the succeeding generation. God grant that there may be room left for a little esteem in favour of those who may have resisted these errors, the eternal disgrace of the human mind !\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nOF THE METHOD TO BE FOLLOWED.â©\n\nShowing that the observation of human nature is the true method to be followed in demonstrating the rights of man in society.\n\nBEFORE proceeding to demonstrate that property is a right, a right sacred as the liberty of coming and going, of thinking and writing, it is important to fix on the method of demonstration to be pursued in this matter. When it is said, man has the right of moving, labouring, thinking, and expressing his thoughts freely, what is the foundation for this language ? Whence has the proof of all these rights been derived ? In the wants of man, reply certain philosophers ; his wants constitute his rights. He needs to move freely, to labour in order to live, to think ; when he has thought, to speak in accordance with his thoughts ; therefore he has the right to do these things. Those who reason thus have approached the truth, but not reached it ; from their manner of reasoning it would result —that every want is a right, a true want like a false want, a natural and simple want like one proceeding from perverse habits. If these are true wants, there are also false ones, originating in false habits. Man, by indulging his passions, creates exaggerated and condemnable wants ; such as those of wine, women, expense, dress, idleness, sleep, ill-regulated activity, revolutions, combats, wars. As a man of pleasure, his mistress must be \"the cynosure of neighbouring eyes ; \" a coarse wine-bibber, he must have hogsheads of drink which will brutalize him ; a, conqueror, he must have the whole world to ravage. [7] If wants were the source of rights, CÃ¦sar at Rome, would have had the right to take the women, the liberty, the wealth, the glory of the Romans, and in that case, vice would have given the right.\n\nI know that the philosophers who have reasoned thus, have distinguished and said, \" True wants make rights.\" It then remains to inquire what are true wants, to distinguish the true from the false, at which end we arrive, how ? by observation of human nature.\n\nThe exact observation of human nature is, therefore, the method to be followed in order to discover and demonstrate the rights of man.\n\nMontesquieu has said : \" Laws are the relations of things.\" With due deference to this great genius, he would have spoken with more exactness had he said : \" Laws are the permanence of things.\" Newton observed heavy bodies : he saw an apple fall from a tree (to use popular and familiar language). Comparing this fact with another, with that of the moon attracted towards the earth, of the earth attracted towards tha sun, he perceived in a particular and insignificant fact a general and permanent one, and said : \" Heavy bodies are attracted to one another, in proportion to their mass,\" and called this phenomenon the law of gravitation.\n\nI observe a man ; I compare him with an animal ; I see that, far from obeying vulgar instincts, such as eating, drinking, sleeping, waking, and then repeating the same round, he oversteps these narrow limits, and that to all these natural habitudes he adds others far more elevated, far more complicated. He has a penetrating mind ; with this mind he contrives the means of satisfying his wants ; he makes a selection of these means, not limiting himself to seizing his prey on the wing, like the eagle, or by lying in wait for it, like the tiger; he cultivates the earth, weaves clothing [8] exchanges his own produce with that of another man, traffics, defends or attacks, makes war or peace, rises to the government of states ; then, mounting higher still, attains to a knowledge of God. In proportion to his advance in this various knowledge, he is governed less by brute force and more by reason ; he is worthier of participating in the government of the society of which he is a member ; and all that considered, after having recognised in him the sublime intelligence which is developed by exercise, after having seen that by preventing its exercise I cause him to lose it altogether, making him wretched and almost deserving his wretchedness as a slave, —I express my astonishment and say : \" Man has the right to be free, because his noble nature, accurately observed, reveals to me the law, that a thinking being ought to be free ; as the fall of an apple revealed to Newton, that heavy bodies tend towards each other.\"\n\nI defy then, any one to find any other way of establishing rights than a straight-forward and profound observation of beings. When their constant manner of proceeding has been observed, we infer the law that governs them, and from the law infer the right. Yet I must add one remark to obviate contradiction. \" From the law which inclines heavy bodies towards each other,\" it maybe asked, \" do you infer the right ? Will you say : The earth has the right to gravitate towards the sun ? \" \" No,\" I reply with Pascal : \" Earth, thou knowest not what thou doest. If thou crushest me, thou knowest it not, but I know it. I am then thy superior ! \"\n\nNo, right is the privilege of moral, of thinking beings. I should almost be tempted to say, but I dare not, that the dog which follows you, and loves you, has the right to be well treated, because that affectionate and attached animal falls down at your feet and licks them tenderly. And yet, were I to express myself [9] thus, I should be wanting in strict accuracy of language. If you owe anything to that faithful creature, it is because you comprehend his wants. As for the dog himself, he has a right to nothing, because he desires without knowledge. This word right has regard solely to themutual relations of thinking beings. All beings, moral as well as physical, have laws in this universe ; but as regards the former, laws constitute rights. After having observed a man, I see that he thinks, that he wants to think, to exercise this faculty ; that by exercise it is developed and enlarged ; and I say that he has the right to think and speak, for thinking and speaking are one. I owe it to him, if I am the government, not as to the dog mentioned above, but as to a being who has the feeling of his right, who is my equal, to whom I give what I know to be his due, and who receives proudly what he knows belongs to him. In a word, it is always the same method, that is to say, the observation of nature. I see that man has such and such a faculty, such and such a want to exercise it. I say that the means must be given him ; and as human language reveals in its infinite shades the infinite shades of things, I say, when speaking of a heavy body, that it tends to gravitate because it is forced thereto. I say of the dog, do not ill-treat him, for he feels your bad treatment, and his amiable nature has not deserved it. Arrived at man, my equal before God, I say, he has the RIGHT. His law, his peculiar law, assumes this sublime word.\n\n[10]\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nON THE UNIVERSALITY OF PROPERTY.â©\n\nShowing that property is a permanent fact, universal in all times and in all countries.\n\nTHE method of observation being recognised as the only good one for the moral as well as for the physical sciences, I examine, firstly, human nature in every country, in every age, in all states of civilization, and everywhere I find property as a general, universal fact, without any exception.\n\nThe publicists of the last century, desirous of making a distinction between the natural and the civil state, imagined an epoch when \"wild in woods the naked savage ran,\" obeying no fixed law, and another epoch in which he had assembled with his fellows and submitted to the restraint of contracts entitled laws. The supposed conditions of the first state were termed natural right; the real and known conditions of the second were styled civil right. This is a mere hypothesis, for man has nowhere and at no time been found isolated, not even among the untutored savages of America or of the islands of the Pacific. As among animals there 'are some which, guided by instinct, live in bodies, (such as herbivorous animals, which graze in company, while carnivorous animals live isolated that they may chase without a rival,) so man has always been observed to live in society. Instinct, that first and oldest of laws, draws him towards his fellows, and constitutes him a social animal. Were it otherwise, what would he do with that intelligent look with which he questions and replies before he can speak ? What would [11] he do with that mind which conceives, generalizes, qualifies things ; with that voice which points them out by sounds ; with that speech, the instrument of thought, the very bond and chain of society ? A being so nobly organized, feeling the want and having the means of communicating with his like, could not be made for isolation. Those wretched inhabitants of Oceania, more nearly resembling the monkey tribe than any others to be met with, occupied with fishing, the least instructive of every kind of existence, have been found drawn near each other, living together, and communicating with one another by harsh and savage sounds.\n\nNay, more : man has been always found to possess his own dwelling, and in that dwelling his wife and children, forming the first agglomerations, called families ; these being placed in juxta-position to one another form tribes, which by a natural instinct defend one another in common, as they live in common. Observe the stag, the deer, the chamois, grazing quietly in the beautiful glades of our European forests, or on the grassy slopes of the Alps or Pyrenees : if a breath of air carries to their acute senses a sound forewarning them of danger, they give, with voice or foot, a sign of emotion, which is instantly communicated to the whole herd, and they flee in common, for their defence is in the marvellous agility of their legs. Man, born to create and to brave the cannon's mouth, instead of flying, seizes his weapons, be they more or less perfect, takes up a pole, to the end of which he fixes a sharp stone, and armed with this rude lance, unites with his neighbour, opposes the enemy, resists or yields in turn, according to the orders he receives from the most skilful or the most daring member of the tribe.\n\nAll these acts are accomplished by instinct, before anything has been written either on laws or acts, before any contract has been thought of. The instinctive rules of this primitive state, —rules the most [12] rudimentary, general, and necessary of all, may well be called natural right. Now property exists from this moment ; for it has never been seen that, in this state, man had not his hut or his tent, his wife, his children, with a few accumulations of the produce of his fishing or hunting, or of his flocks, in the shape of provisions for his family. And if a neighbour, having a precocious instinct of iniquity, should seek to wrest from him some of the simple goods constituting his possessions, he applies to that chief at whose side he has been accustomed to stand during the fight, calls upon him for redress and protection, and the latter decides according to the notions of justice developed among the tribe.\n\nAmong every people, then, how rude soever they may be, we find property, at first as a fact and then as an idea, —an idea more or less clear according to the degree of civilization they have attained, but always invariably settled. Thus the savage hunter has at least the property of his bow, his arrows, and of the game he has killed. The nomad, who is a shepherd, has at least the property of his tents, and of his flocks and herds. He has not as yet admitted that of the soil, because as yet he has not thought fit to exert his faculties upon it. But the Arab who has raised numerous herds clearly understands that he is the proprietor of them, and exchanges his produce for the corn which another Arab, already fixed to the soil, has grown elsewhere. He measures with accuracy the value of the object he gives against the value of that which is offered him : he clearly understands that he is the owner (proprietor) of the one before the bargain is struck, and of the other after. To him as yet immovable property has no existence. At times, however, he may be seen, during two or three months of the year, fixing on land which belongs to nobody, tilling it rudely, casting in the seed, gathering it when [13] ripe, and then removing to some other place. But during the time that he is employed in tilling and sowing this land and in harvesting the crop, the nomad feels that he is the owner of it, and would rush to arms against any who should dispute its fruits. His property endures in proportion to his labour. By degrees, however, the wanderer of the desert settles and becomes a husbandman ; for it is in the heart of man to have his home, as a bird has his nest, and the rabbit his burrow. He ends by selecting a territory, by dividing it into patrimonies, where each family settles, labours, cultivates for itself and for its descendants. Just as a man cannot let his affections wander over all the members of his tribe, and that he needs a wife and children of his own, whom he may love, tend, and protect ; in whom are concentrated his fears, his hopes, his life indeed ; he needs a field to himself, which he may cultivate, plant, enclose, or embellish according to his taste, and which he hopes to deliver to his descendants covered with trees that have grown up, not for himself, but for them. Then to the movable property of the nomad succeeds the immovable property of an agricultural people ; the second property arises, and with it complicated laws, indeed, but still such as time renders more just, more foreseeing, but without changing the principle, which is applied by judges and by the public force. Property resulting from a first effect of instinct becomes a social contract, for I protect your property in order that you may protect mine ; I protect it either by my person as a soldier, or by my money, by devoting a part of my revenue to the support of a public force.\n\nThus man, careless at first, little attached to the soil which affords him wild fruits or numerous animals to devour, without any great trouble to himself, takes his place at nature's table laden with spontaneous viands, and where there is room for all without jealousy or [14] dispute, by turns sitting down, leaving it, and returning to it, as to a banquet always spread by a liberal master, —a master who is none other than God himself. But by degree he acquires a taste for viands more refined ; he must produce them ; he begins to grow attached to them, because they are worth more, because he has had to labour hard to produce them. He thus portions out the earth, becomes strongly attached to his own share, and if nations in a body dispute his right to it, he contends also in nations; if within the city where he dwells, his neighbour disputes his little spot of earth, he pleads before a judge. But his tent and his herds first, his allotment and his farm afterwards, successively attract his affections, and constitute the different modes of his property.\n\nThus, in proportion as man expands, he becomes more and more attached to what he possesses, or in other words, more proprietary. He is scarcely so at all in a barbarous state ; in the civilized state he is eminently so. It has been said that the idea of property was growing weaker in the world. This is a mistake. Far from being weakened, it is regulated, determined, and strengthened. It ceases, for instance, to be applied to what is not capable of being a possession, that is, to man ; and from that moment slavery ceases. It is a progress in the ideas of justice, not a weakness in the idea of property. For example ; the landlords, the seigneurs, alone had the privilege during the middle ages of killing the game bred on the land belonging to all. Whoever, now-a-days, falls in with a hare on his own grounds may kill it, for it has been bred there. Among the ancients, the land was the property of the republic; in Asia, it belongs to the despot; in the middle ages, it was the property of a few lords. With the progress of the ideas of liberty, by arriving at the enfranchisement of man, his possessions, his goods, were enfranchised also; he was declared proprietor, [15] owner of his land, independently of the republic, the despot, or the lord. From that moment confiscation was abolished. The day that restored to him the use of his faculties, individualized his property still more ; it became still more attached to the individual himself, still more property than it had been.\n\nLet us take another example. In the middle ages, or in despotic states, the surface of the earth was conceded, but not what lay beneath. The right of excavating mines was a royalty, leased out for money and for a season to certain workers of the metals. With the progress of time it was understood, that as the interior of the earth might become the scene of a new kind of labour, it ought to become the scene of a new property, and the property of mines was constituted ; so that now there are two properties connected with the soil, that of the husbandman above, of the miner below.\n\nProperty is therefore a general and universal fact, \\ increasing and not decreasing. When naturalists obJ serve an animal which, like the bee or the beaver, constructs a habitation, they declare unhesitatingly that the bee and the beaver are constructive animals. On I similar grounds, cannot philosophers, who are the naturalists of the human race, say, and say truly, that property is a law of man, that he is made for property, and that it is a law of his kind ? And it is not enough f to assert that it is a law of his kind, jt is a law of all living things. Has not the rabbit his burrow, the bird his nest, the beaver his hut, and the bee his hive ? Has not the swallow that joy of our climate in the young spring-time her nest, to which she returns, and which she will not yield without a struggle ; and if she had the gift of thought, would she not be disgusted by the theories of our sophists ? Grazing animals live peacefully in a body, like the wanderers of the desert, in certain pastures, from which they never remove, for [16] in them property is manifested by habit. Carnivorous animals, as the lion, like the savage hunter, cannot live in herds ; they would incommode one another ; each has around him a circle of destruction, in which he dwells alone, and from which he expels all of like habits who might wish to share his spoil. He also, if he could think, would declare himself a proprietor. And now, returning to human beings, observe that child, governed by instinct no less than the lion. Notice with what simplicity the inclination for property is revealed in him. I sometimes observe a little boy, sole heir to a considerable fortune, already understanding that he will not have to share with brothers that mansion to which his mother conducts him every summer, —knowing that he is the sole proprietor of that fine park in which his childhood is spent, —he has no sooner arrived, than in these extensive gardens he desires to have his own garden, where he may cultivate fruits which he will not eat, and flowers which he will not gather, but where he will be master —master of a little parcel of the estate until he becomes master of the whole.\n\nAfter having seen that in all times and in all countries man appropriates all that he touches, first his bow and his arrows, then his land, his house, his palace, —invariably establishes property as the necessary reward of labour, —if we reasoned concerning him, as Pliny and Buffon have reasoned on animals, we should not hesitate to declare, after having observed so general a manner of being, that property is a necessary law of his kind. But this animal is not an ordinary animal ; he is a king, —king of the creation (as would have been said formerly), and yet his titles are contested. This is reasonable ; we must examine them more closely. Fact, it is said, does not constitute right : tyranny also is a fact, a very general fact. We must therefore prove that the fact of property is a right, and deserves the title. We have, however, done something [17] by showing that this fact is increasing instead of diminishing, for tyranny decays and disappears instead of extending. Let us proceed, however, and you will see that this fact is the most deserving of respect, the most fertile of all, the most worthy of being called a right ; for by its means God has civilized the world, and led men from woods and wilds into cities, from cruelty to gentleness, from ignorance to wisdom, from barbarism to civilization.\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nON THE FACULTIES OF MAN.â©\n\nShowing that man possesses in his personal facilities a primary incontestible property, the origin of all others.\n\nPROPERTY, I have said, is a universal fact : let us sub4 mit this fact to the unbiassed judgment of the human, conscience, and examine whether this tendency in man to appropriate either the fish he has caught, the bird he has snared, the fruit he has grown, or the field that he has watered with his sweat, is on his part an act of usurpation, a theft, committed to the injury of the human race.\n\nTo leave nothing unexplored, let us begin at home. Let us first consider our own persons, and go as closely as we can. My clothing is very nigh me ; I can, if I have woven or paid him who has woven it, maintain that it is mine ; for to all appearances these garments, which protect me from the wet or the cold, are not such an excess of enjoyment as to be considered prejudicial to the rest of the human race. But I desire to [18] commence still nearer the examination of what does or does not belong to me, and I stay to consider my body, and in my body the living principle by which it is animated.\n\nI feel, I think, I will ; these sensations, these thoughts, this will, I refer to myself. I feel that they are taking place within me, and I regard myself as a being separated from all that surrounds me, distinct from that vast universe which by turns attracts or repels me, charms or amazes me. I feel that I am placed in it, but I distinguish myself clearly from, it, and I confound my person neither with the soil on which I tread, nor with the beings more or less like me who come near me, and with whom I might sometimes be tempted to confound myself, so dear they are to me, —such as my wife and children. I distinguish myself, therefore, from all the rest of the creation, and I feel that I belong to myself.\n\nLet the philosophers who endeavour to search into the reality of our knowledge inquire whether all this spectacle of the universe be true or not, —whether or not the Almighty is making sport of my credulity by placing around me spectres, mere shadows of things, which deceive me, and which have no reality; what has that to do with the subject of which I am treating ? That mass of rock against which my bark founders, —that fiery steed rushing on me to trample me beneath his hoofs, are neither rock nor horse, are a mere image! That rock which threatens my frail boat, that horse which threatens my person ; are sufficient objects of my belief to turn me aside from them : the sensation is sufficient to determine me. From that moment, viewing the spectacle of the world seriously, and leaving to metaphysicians the discussion of its reality, I place myself in that reality, and first appropriate my person, the sensations it experiences, the judgments it forms, the will it conceives ; and I think [19] I may say, without being either tyrant or usurper: the first of my possessions, my properties, is myself.\n\nThis recognition once effected, I pass a little from this interior, this centre of my being, —I go forth, and without proceeding far, observe my feet, my hands, my arms. There assuredly I am at the extreme limit of my existence, and I say : These feet, these arms, these hands, incontestibly belong to me. Men may dispute the horses that lend me their active limbs to carry me rapidly over the earth. Perhaps, in the name of the plundered human race, they may be taken from me, and I may be told they do not belong to me, but to all. Well, be it so. But my feet, my hands —no one has yet imagined that they belong to the whole human race. They may tell me so, but I shall not believe it. If any one touched them, or insolently trod upon my feet, I should grow angry, and if strong enough, fall upon the offender to avenge the insult.\n\nThese feet, these hands, these varied organs, which put me in communication with the universe, are therefore mine, that is, I make use of them unceasingly, without scruple, without remorse at having the goods of another ; which I never dream of surrendering to any one, unless I desire to aid one that I love, and who is deprived of the use of his limbs. Still, I never confound them with those of another.\n\nNow these feet and hands, which serve me to carry or to seize the objects I want ; these eyes which help me to see ; that mind which helps me to discern all things, and to use them with profit to myself, —these feet, hands, eyes, mind, which are mine and not another's, are they equal to my neighbour's ? Certainly not. I remark in my own faculties and in those of my neighbour very notable differences ; I observe that some, by reason of these differences, are in misery or abundance, unable to defend themselves, or in a position to domineer over others.\n\n[20]\n\nIs it really true that one man has great physical strength, another very little? that one is strong but awkward, another weak but clever ? that one will do but little work, another much ? Is it true that, setting aside the traditional inequalities of birth and fortune, taking two workmen in any manufactory, one will exhibit extreme skill, indefatigable diligence, earn three or four times more than the other, accumulate Ms first gains, and form a capital with which in turn he will speculate and become immensely rich ? These happy faculties, moral or physical, are certainly his own. \"This will,, not be denied; and with no misapplication of language, it may be said they are his property. But this property is unequal; for with certain faculties this man remains poor all his life, with certain others that man becomes rich and powerful. They are the essential cause that one has much, the other little.\n\nHere, then, is a primary kind of property, which will not be taxed with usurpation : firstly myself, then my faculties, whether physical or intellectual, my feet, hands, eyes, brain, —in a word, my soul and my body.\n\nThis is a primary, incontestable, indivisible property, to which no one has yet thought of applying an agrarian law ; of which no one has ever thought of complaining neither to me, nor to society, nor to its laws ; for which I may be envied or hated, but of which none will ever think of taking away a portion to give it to others, and for which they can complain of God alone, by calling Him unjust, wicked, or powerless, —reproaches, from which I hope to justify Him before the close of this book.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nON THE EMPLOYMENT OF MAN'S FACULTIES, OR LABOUR.â©\n\nShowing, —That by the exercise of man's faculties there is produced a second property, which has labour for its origin, and which society protects for the benefit of all.\n\nA MAN has, therefore, very unequal faculties, relatively to certain members of his race, but which are indisputably his own. Now what shall he do with them ? Has God given them to him, like song to the bird, that he may sing uselessly in the woods, occupy his idleness, or excite the reveries of the solitary wanderer ? One day, perhaps, his voice may be that of a Homer or Tasso, a Demosthenes or Bossuet ; but, meanwhile, God has imposed on him other cares than those of describing nature, or deploring the fall of empires. He has destined him to labour, to labour severely, from sun-rise to 6un-set, to water the earth with the sweat of his brow.\n\nNudus in nudÃ¢ humo, —such is the state in which man was placed on the earth, says Pliny the Elder. By dint of labour man provides for his necessities. He must clothe himself, by tearing from the lion or the tiger the skin which covers them, to hide his own nakedness ; then, as arts are developed, he must spin the fleeces of his sheep, and, weaving the yarn together, form a continuous web to serve him as a garment. This is not sufficient : he must shelter himself from the changes of weather ; construct a dwelling in which he may counteract the irregularities of the seasons, ward [22] off the torrents of rain, the heat of the sun, and the sharp frosts of winter. After having attended to these cares, he must eat, eat every day, several times a-day ; and, while the animal, deprived of reason, but covered with feathers or fur as a protection, finds, if it is a bird, ripe fruit hanging on the trees, if it is a beast of prey, his food prepared in the animals of the pasture, —man is obliged to procure provisions by making them spring out of the ground, or by disputing their possession with animals stronger and fleeter than himself. He must take a branch from the tree, bend it into a bow, discharge from it the winged arrow, which brings down the animal he destines for his meal ; then it must be exposed to the fire, be cooked, —for his stomach is averse to the sight of the blood and the palpitating limbs. Here are bitter fruits, but at their side grow others that are sweeter : he must make a selection from them, that, by cultivation, he may render them still sweeter and more savoury. Of the grains, some are empty or light ; but among the number some are more nourishing than others : some of these he must select, sowing them in a rich soil that will make them more nutritious, and, by cultivation, changing them into wheat. By dint of these cares, man ends by existing, existing tolerably well ; and, with God's help, many revolutions taking place on the earth, empires crumbling one' after the other, generation succeeding generation, mingling with another from the north and the south, the east and the west, exchanging ideas, communicating inventions, daring navigators passing from cape to cape, from the Mediterranean to the ocean, from the ocean to the Indian seas, from Europe to America, collecting, together the productions of the whole world, —the human race attains that point where its misery is changed into wealth, where, instead of the skins of wild beasts, man wears garments of silk and purple, lives on food the most succulent and varied, often the [23] produce of lands situated half the world from the place where they are consumed; and his dwelling, at first little better than the hut of a beaver, assumes the proportions of the Parthenon, the Vatican, or the Tuileries.\n\nThat destitute creature, who had nothing . is now in the midst of abundance. By what means ? By labour, indefatigable and intelligent labour.\n\nWhen he first appears on the earth, he is naked and destitute of all ; but he has faculties, faculties unequally distributed among the beings of his kind ; he employs them, and, by that employment, succeeds in possessing what was deficient, —he becomes the master of the elements, and almost of nature. Man has therefore his faculties to use, not to sport with, as the bird plays with his wings, his beak, or his voice. A time of leisure will some clay arrive ; with that voice he will become a melodious singer ; those feet and hands will be the feet and hands of a skilful dancer ; but he must labour hard and long before he attains this leisure. To this point we are guided by observation of his being, as the observation of the beaver, the sheep, or the lion, leads us to say that the first is a constructive animal, the second a graminivorous, and the third a carnivorous animal.\n\nLet us advance still further. Man must labour. He must, without alternative, that his natural wretchedness may be succeeded by the comforts and enjoyments of civilization. But for whom will you have him labour, for himself or for others ?\n\nMy birth-place is an island in the Indian sea. My food is fish. I perceive that at certain hours of the day the fish frequent certain waters. With the twisted fibres of a plant I form a net, which I throw into the water, and draw out filled with fish. Or else my birthplace may be in Asia Minor, near that spot where the ark of Noah rested, and where the grain called wheat was first noticed by man. I am given to agriculture. [24] I force an iron instrument into the earth ; the earth thus disturbed I expose to the fertilizing air ; I scatter the seed over its bosom, and watch while it is growing ; I gather it when ripe, grind it, expose it to the fire, and make bread.\n\nThe fish that I have caught with so much patience, the bread that I have made with such exertions, —to whom do they belong ? To me, who have taken such pains, or to the idler who slept while I was toiling at the net or the spade ? The whole human race will reply that they belong to me, for I must live, and on whose labour should I live, if not on my own ? If, just as I was raising to my mouth the bread I had made, some idler should rush upon me and take it away, what should I have to do, but rush in turn on some other, and serving him as I had been served ? He would do the same to a third, and the world, instead of being a theatre of labour, would become a theatre of pillage. And further, as pillage is a sudden and easy act, when we are strong, while production is a slow and difficult act, requiring the employment of a life, plunder would be preferred to fishing, the chase, or cultivation. Man would remain a lion or a tiger, instead of becoming a citizen of Athens, Florence, Paris, or London.\n\nThese examples have all been taken from the primitive state of society. But as human nature does not change as it expands, a man may clothe himself in richer apparel, dwell in more sumptuous mansions, live on daintier food, bedeck himself with purple and gold, live in palaces constructed by a Bramante, dine off the most exquisite viands, and uplift his soul to Plato, —his heart has still the same miseries, and requires the same stimulants to rise above them. If he halted a moment in his struggle against nature, she would again become savage. For a brief space, and through a criminal jealousy between two nations, the marvellous road [25] across the Simplon had been neglected, and nature, continually rolling down blocks of ice, showers of snow, and even mere threads, as it were, of water, upon this mountain route, had soon rendered it impassable. If man were to suspend his exertions for a moment, he would be vanquished by nature ; and if, for a single day, he should cease to be urged on by the charms of possession, his arms would fall listlessly down, and he would slumber beside the instruments of his abandoned labour.\n\nAll travellers have been struck by the state of languor, misery, and devouring usury of those countries in which property is not sufficiently guaranteed. Travel into the East/,where the despot claims to be the sole proprietor ; or, what comes to the same thing, go back to the middle ages, and you will discern the same features everywhere : the soil neglected because it is the prey most exposed to the greed of tyranny, and reserved for the hands of slaves, who have not the choice of occupation ; commerce preferred, as escaping more easily from exactions ; in commerce, gold, silver, and jewels sought as the property most easily concealed ; all capital ready to be converted into this particular property, and when lent, it is at a most exorbitant rate ; concentrated in the hands of a proscribed class, who, making a public show of their wretchedness, living in houses ruinous without, but sumptuous within, —opposing an invincible obstinacy to the barbarous master that would extort the secret of their treasures —find a recompense in making him pay more for his money, thus avenging tyranny by usury. .\n\nWhen, on the contrary, either through the course of tune or the wisdom of the ruler, property is respected, at that moment confidence revives, capital resumes its relative importance, the earth again becomes fertile; gold and silver, once so sought for, are now an inconvenient property, and lose their value; their owners [26] have recovered their dignity with security; they no longer conceal their wealth, but show it with confidence, and lend it at a moderate rate of interest. Activity, universal and continuous, prevails ; a general ease follows ; and society, opening like a flower to the dew and the sun, unfolds itself in every direction to the charmed eyes of the beholders. And should there be some who would ascribe this prosperous state of civilized societies to liberty, whose beneficial virtues God forbid that I should dispute, I would reply, that to the respect accorded to property these great results are owing ; for Venice was not free, but as her tyrants respected labour, she became the richest slave on earth.\n\nTo resume, then, I say : Man has a primary property in his person and in his faculties ; he has a second, less proximate to his nature, but not less sacred, in the produce of his faculties, which embraces all that is called the goods of this world, and which society is most deeply interested to guarantee ; for without that guarantee there will be no labour ; without labour no civilization, not even the necessaries of life, but wretchedness, robbery, and barbarism.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nON INEQUALITY OF GOODS.â©\n\nShowing, that the meguality of man's faculties necessarily leads to an inequality of goods.\n\nIT results from the exercise of the human faculties, that, as these faculties are unequal, one man will produce much, another little ; one will be rich, another poor ; in a word, equality will cease to exist in the [27] world. It should be clearly understood that I speak not of that equality which consists in living under the same laws, in obeying the same authorities, incurring the same penalties, obtaining the same rewards, undergoing (in fine) the same social conditions, and which is called equality in the eyes of the law ; but of that equality which would consist in possessing the same amount of property, whether a man be skilful or unskilful, industrious or idle, fortunate or unfortunate in his labour. The former is necessary, indisputable, and, where it is wanting, society is a mere tyranny. Let us see what we should think of the latter.\n\nBut first let us return to the fact from which we originally started. These unequal faculties, consisting in greater muscular strength or in greater intellectual energy, in certain aptitudes of body or mind, and sometimes of both, —as in the skilful mechanic, who with his hands adjusts the various parts of a machine, —as in the sculptor, who carves in the marble the idea existing in his mind, —as in the general, whose prompt and sure eye is united with great courage and rude health, —all these faculties, at once physical and moral, belong to the man to whom God gave them. He holds them of God, —of that God whom I will call by what name soever you please, be it god, fatality, chance, —the author, in fact, of all things, either doing them himself or allowing them to be done, either willing or permitting them. You will acknowledge that he is the chief criminal, the main cause of the evil, if evil there be, in the inequalities of which you would be inclined to complain. Even before the time when long accumulated labour, and transmission from generation to generation, has added to the first inequalities, you will acknowledge that even in the savage state the highly gifted man possesses great advantages. In the chase, if he be more skilful, he has twice as much food as his neighbour. In self-defence, if he be stronger, [28] he has twice the means of resistance. Inequality appears, therefore, at the very commencement of the social existence ; it is manifested on the first day. and the ulterior inequalities of the richest society are but the lengthened shadow of a body already highly elevated.\n\nIn a question of right, little or much makes no appreciable difference. Equality of goods is or is not the right of the human race : if it is a right, it was as much violated in the younger days of these societies, when the most skilful or most intelligent savage was richest in the productions of the chase, better provided with the means of defence or of subjugating others, as when, in later days, this savage, now a member of a civilized society, is a man of countless wealth, beside a poor man wanting the necessaries of life.\n\nBut having recourse to visible facts in order to elicit the will of God, that is, the laws of creation, I affirm that since men are unequally endowed, God has no doubt intended that they should have different enjoyments ; and that when he gave to one a keen sense of hearing, smell, or sight, and to another senses the most obtuse ; to this man the means of producing and eating much, and to that man weak arms and a delicate stomach; when he made one the brilliant Alcibiades, possessing every faculty in perfection, and the other the idiot CrÃ©tin, of the valley of Aosta, —he did this that there should be differences in the mode of being in these men, so differently gifted. When, extending my views still farther, I pass from man to the horse or the dog, from the horse or the dog to the mole, the polype, or the plant, —when in the same forest I see the lowly fern beside the lofty oak, and even among these oaks, some more luxuriant than others, which the soil, the sun, the shower have favoured, which have soared proudly above all around, —and then, one more fortunate still, that has escaped the woodman's axe or the lightning's [29] stroke, I say to myself: These inequalities were probably the condition of that sublime plan which a great genius has denned as unity in diversity, and diversity in unity.\n\nBut I may be told that this picturesqueness of nature which seduces me may be an injustice, for CÃ¦sar, in the moral order, may be a very interesting object of observation, but he is none the less a tyrant —a seductive tyrant, full of genius, —but still a tyrant.\n\nI understand the objection.\n\nAlthough we have certainly good grounds for referring to creation itself the principle of all human inequality, yet it is true that God delivers up his own work, charging us to modify or regulate it, as a master delivers to his apprentice a task that he is to finish. Thus, he permitted the existence of a CÃ¦sar, that is, of one man stronger than another, able to oppress the rest ; but he has charged us to restrain this being, to keep him in check by laws.. Well ; but let us see if this tendency to labour much, and consequently to possess much, is one of these despotic tendencies necessary to be kept in check. That is the pith of the matter.\n\nDoes that man injure any one who labours energetically and accumulates what he earns ? He toils earnestly, continuously, by the side of another who barely scratches the earth. He possesses well-stored garners by the side of his neighbour whose barns are empty or but half filled. Has he done any harm to this neighbour ? Has he deprived him of his stores ? In that case there would be robbery, violence, evil done to his neighbour. But he has laboured —laboured more or better than another. He has not, therefore, injured him, like a usurper or an oppressor. He has a few more grains on the earth —a little more wealth in society ; and that is all. What harm has he done around him bv enriching himself ? None.\n\n[30]\n\nWhat interest could society have in preventing him ? None. This prevention, too, would be sheer madness ; for without any corresponding profit, it would have diminished the mass of things necessary or useful to man.\n\nThere is, therefore, no harm done either to you or to me, or to society ; and this man should be permitted to exercise his faculties as he pleases.\n\nIt is true, nevertheless, that this wealth is a cause of evil to you —the evil of comparison. It galls you, and excites your envy. I agree that this is certainly an evil, a grievous evil, but it is not without compensation ; and all things being soberly examined, society declares the compensation so great that in every time and country it has thought fit to let envy suffer, and the prosperity of individuals increase, in proportion to their skill, and on their application ; —and this is the compensation.\n\nIt is by means of exchange that men procure most of the things they require. Accordingly they do not make everything. They make certain things, to which they devote themselves exclusively, and thus succeed in making them better than others. They then give a portion of what they have produced to procure that which the labour of others has produced, and the result is this : when there is more corn or more cloth, both are cheaper. There is more of each for everybody. Whosoever then, by yielding to his taste or his skill in labour, is liable, when he grows rich, to excite your envy, has contributed to the common prosperity, and particularly to yours. If, in consequence of his exertions, there is more corn, or iron, or cloth, or money, there is more of each for all. The abundance which he has helped to create is advantageous to all ; and society permits him to add to his stores, although the result may be an inequality as regards those who labour less strenuously : it is permitted, because the [31] general prosperity increases with his private prosperity. It would check the individual that would oppress his fellows ; but him who employs his faculties to multiply on the soil the objects useful to man, such as food, clothing, or habitations —who renders these objects more plentiful, wholesome, and better, even should he (for himself or his children) convert his aliments into savoury and exquisite viands, his garments into purple and fine linen, his house into a palace —him, I repeat, society encourages and supports, without troubling itself with the contrast ; without compassionating the feelings of the envious ; for even the envious man procures his food, his clothes, his lodging at a cheaper rate, and if he should desire to produce in his turn, he will procure money at a lower interest ; labour will be an easier task to him.\n\nThe principle of equality, properly understood, in no respect weakens the principle of property, however unequal that may become by the superiority of one man's labour over another's ; and so far, at least, the chain of our reasoning has been carried on without being weakened.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nON THE TRANSMISSION OF PROPERTY.â©\n\nShowing that property is not property unless it be transmissible by gift or by inheritance.\n\nNOTHING is more legitimate, say the writers I am arguing against, than that man should enjoy the produce of his labour —that he should eat the fruit gathered from the trees he has planted. They thus grant a [32] personal property to him who has created it by Ms labour. In truth, nature, stronger than they, confounds them ; compels them to be silent in the presence of that fact, so simple, so manifestly irreproachable, of a man eating the fruit that he has caused to grow. They go still further in their concessions ; they admit that a man shall possess more or less, according as he has been during life more or less skilful, more or less industrious, —that one shall have much, another little ; and they grant, consequently, that primary inequality of goods which results from the natural inequality of man's faculties. But here their concessions stop. Nothing is more just, they exclaim, than that a man should enjoy the fruits of his labour ; but that these fruits should be transmitted to another, that this other should enjoy them in idleness, and in the vices that idleness engenders, —this is repugnant to the simplest equity ; this runs counter to the result society had in view by consecrating property, namely, that of exciting labour; this adds to the natural inequalities God has established among men by endowing them unequally, —those artificial inequalities which are the cause that an idle and worthless child, because he is the heir of an industrious and worthy father, lives in the midst of every enjoyment, while at his side another individual, deprived of the same advantages, lives in the greatest misery. Property extended so as to become hereditary thus arrives at consequences which are in contradiction to its principle, and which cannot be admitted.\n\nThis is really the point, not a difficult but a complicated one, of the subject under review ; for, like a river, which winds the more the farther it flows from its source, so this question extends, is expanded and mixed up with a multitude of other questions. And yet, what the adversaries of property deny, I affirm ; what they dispute, I maintain to be indispensable ; and these are my assertions as opposed to theirs : —\n\n[33]\n\nProperty either is or is not ;\n\nIf it is, it carries with it the right of gift ;\n\nIf it carries with it the right of gift, it must include the children as well as indifferent persons ;\n\nIt is in force during the life of the parent, as well as at his death ;\n\nFar from favouring idleness by this extension, it becomes, on the contrary, a powerful and unlimited excitement to labour, on condition of the privilege of transmitting it from the sire to the son ;\n\nLastly, the new and the greatest inequalities which follow are absolutely necessary, and compose one of the most beautiful and productive harmonies of human society.\n\nIn a word, property produces its best and most productive effects only on condition of being complete, of becoming personal and hereditary.\n\nSuch are the propositions which, in the following chapters, I shall endeavour to render so clear as to cut off (I would hope) all opposition.\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nON GIFT.â©\n\nShowing that gift is one of the necessary manners of using property.\n\nYou grant that I can enjoy what I have produced, that I can apply to my wants or my pleasures the fruits of my personal labour. But would it be a robbery, and dangerous to society, if I gave them to another ?\n\nFirst, suppose that I have produced more than I can consume, which happens to every skilful and industrious [34] man, what will you have me do with the surplus ? My granaries are full of corn, my stores of fruit, and my cellars of wine ; the wool of my flocks has furnished me more garments than I can wear, and all because I have cultivated my fields with more intelligence and activity than another ; what would you have me do with this abundance ? That I should eat and drink more than my hunger and my thirst require, or that I should throw the excess into a lay-stall, appointed for the purpose ; or else that I should not create them at all, which is the simplest course ? If you will not permit me to use the surplus of my labour as I please, I shall be reduced to one of three alternatives : either I must consume more than I want, or destroy the surplus, or not create it at all. But here is a way of employing the superfluity of my goods, which I submit to your judgment.\n\nI observe at the border of my field a poor wretch expiring of hunger and fatigue. I run up to him, and pour into his mouth a little of my surplus wine ; I give him one of those fruits I did not know what to do with ; I throw over his tattered clothes one of those many garments I had produced, and I behold his senses returning, the smile of gratitude imprinted on his features, and in my heart I experience a more lively pleasure than that which I had felt in my mouth when tasting the fruits of my field. Do you mean to restrict to this point the employment of my possessions, so that I cannot use them in the manner that is most pleasing to me ? After having conceded to me the merely physical enjoyment of my property, would you deny me the moral enjoyment, the noblest, the sweetest, the most useful of all ? Odious legislator, you would permit me to eat, to destroy, my possessions, and not allow me to give them away ! Self, self alone, is the paltry aim you would assign to the painful exertions of a life ! you would thus degrade, disenchant, check [35] my labour! But, however, judge of the fact by its consequences. I have said above, that if a man were to fall upon his neighbour, and take away from him the food destined for his support, and he in turn were to do the same to another, society would ere long be a mere scene of plunder, instead of a field of labour. Suppose, on the contrary, that each man who has too much should give to him who has not enough, the world would become a theatre of beneficence. Do not fear, however, that man can ever go too far in this course, and make his neighbour idle by undertaking to labour for him. All the charity that exists in the heart of man is barely on a level with human misery, and the utmost has been done when the continued appeals of morality and religion succeed in making the remedy equal to the disease, the balm sufficient for the wound.\n\nGift, then, is the noblest way of employing property. It is, I repeat, a moral enjoyment added to a physical enjoyment. \" Enough, enough ! \" my opponents will say ; \" you are demonstrating what needs no demonstration.\" Agreed : but let us pursue the matter, and they will perhaps be obliged to say as much of all the rest.\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nON INHERITANCE.â©\n\nShowing that from gift the parent derives the right of endowing his children during his life or at his death.\n\nIT has been conceded, that gift is one of the necessary and indispensable ways of employing property. Now let us go a step farther. What ! I may give to persons who are nothing to me, but whose sufferings have touched me, and I cannot give to my wife or children ; [36] to my wife, who shared all the toils of my life ; to my children, my offspring, who are dearer to me than my own person ! When they are hungry or cold, if I am not utterly depraved, I feel hunger and cold more for them than for myself. Their wants are mine, and stimulate me more than my own. Will you not then permit me to make a choice among my wants, to satisfy first those which I feel the most acutely, and to appease a hunger more painful for me to endure than that which I feel in my own stomach ? You will permit me, then, to feed my children before I feed myself. That is not all, however. For a part of their life, some one must support these children, for during onefourth of their existence they are too weak to provide for themselves. In the savage state, for instance, trees must be climbed to gather fruit ; in a civilized state, bread can only be procured after it is earned. But if any one should support them, who will undertake that care, unless it be myself, their father, the author of their days ? The birds of the air set me an example, which, apparently, you will allow me to follow ! \" Enough, enough ! \" my opponents will say again ; \" you are proving what requires no proof ! \" Where then must I go in this road to find what needs a demonstration ?\n\nProperty is not property, if I cannot give it away as well as consume it : this point is conceded. If I can give it to strangers, a fortiori I can give it to my children, who imperatively require it during part of their life : this is also conceded. I can therefore give it to another, and in another I can, I ought to prefer my children. Where then does the difficulty begin ? At the moment of my decease ; that is, I can give it at all periods of my life, except at the point of death. And is that the only difference between the right I claim and that which is disputed ! But this difference would be either null, or barbarous, or impossible.\n\n[37]\n\nTell me how you will prevent a parent from giving to Ms son what he desires to bequeath to him at the moment of his death ? If you permit a father to give away during his life-time and not at his death, he will take care to disseise himself during that life-time. A day, an hour before his decease, he will give from hand to hand the moveable (i. e. personal) property, easily transmissible on the death-bed, such as money, jewels, or papers having a marketable value. Immovable (or real) property, which is more difficult of transmission, such as land, houses, &c., he will give away one, two, or ten years before his decease, or else he will sell them, and depreciate their value in order to convert them into objects transmissible at pleasure. In a word, he will have evaded your law, by stripping himself during his life. But from the necessity you have imposed upon him of giving away his property during life, two consequences will arise. The good father will be punished for his goodness, the bad father recompensed for his selfishness. The good father, parting with his property before death, may perhaps meet with an ungrateful son, and will be unable to plant a tree, or turn a furrow in that field which he has given his son, and will live a stranger in the midst of the wealth he created, and of which he will be deprived before his time, for fear that his son should not reap the benefit of it. The bad father, on the contrary, who may be unwilling to part with his property, or the cowardly one, who may be fearful to entertain the idea of death, to secure the future of his children, will enjoy his possessions undisputed until his decease. Thus the good father 'will have robbed himself, the bad father will have held his property until his last hour.\n\nAt these odious results, will you not again stop me, and cry out : \" Enough, enough ! \" —Yes, here we must stop, for it is evident that nature, having placed in the heart of man, especially of the good man, an [38] irresistible longing to transmit his possessions to his son, the father will give to his children, however we may endeavour to prevent him, the greater portion of his goods from hand to hand, will convert them into others more capable of being given away directly ; or, if he cannot do that, he will strip himself before his death, to be more assured of making a use of it in conformity with his affections. From that time, the lawgiver, certain of producing absurdities if he obstinately perseveres in opposing nature, and moreover, of being disobeyed while attempting this opposition, will absolve the parent from these hateful precautions, and will grant that at his death his goods shall pass in full right to his children ; in a word, he will grant inheritance of property.\n\nAnd just consider how absurd would be the consequences of an opposite prescription ! The parent, I have said, would be unable to give houses or land, or tangible property, but he would give away, in spite of you, his movable, intangible property, such as is easily passed from hand to hand, an hour before his death. Transmission from sire to son would exist for some things, and not for others. But there are more precious things, which all the laws in the world would not prevent him from transmitting. One man is a clever mechanic, and possesses a secret for tempering metals ; another is a , skilful physician, and has the secret of some valuable remedy : can you prevent either of them, at the hour of death, from whispering into the ears of their children, and securing them a future fortune by a single word ? A third was a great statesman, whose success lay in his prudence; a fourth was a great general, whose wealth was his renown ; can you prevent the one from transmitting his prudence to his son by the lessons of a life ; or the other from bequeathing his glory, merely by bequeathing his name? Another, mixed up in all the affairs of his country, entertains [39] certain religious and political sentiments ; you will not prevent him from inculcating them in his children. And when moral possessions, which ought to be the most precious of all in your eyes, if you are not a legislator devoted solely to the worship of material things, are inevitably transmitted, material things, simply because they are material, are not transmissible ! Money, perhaps, and jewels, as the most transmissible after these moral things, might pass from one generation to another; land, alone, when the parent had not taken the precaution of robbing himself, would be stopped in its passage ! Have you reflected seriously upon these absurdities? Bold sophist, are you not confounded ?\n\nI hold, then, the following propositions as having been most amply demonstrated :\n\nI. Gift, being recognised as one of the necessary methods of using property, is unavoidable, especially to the advantage of the children.\n\nII. It is unavoidable at every period of the father's -existence ; and by according the full right of transmitting his wealth to his children at the hour of death, we must obviate his disposing of it during his life.\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nON THE INFLUENCE OF INHERITANCE ON LABOUR.â©\n\nShowing that the facility of transmitting property from parent to child adds zeal to labour, and completes the system of property.\n\nTHERE are always two lights under which we must alternately view the subject of which I am treating, and which, owing to the admirable combinations of [40] nature, are always found in perfect harmony, they are equity and social utility. Equity, is the question considered with regard to the individual ; social utility, is the question considered with regard to society itself. Equity declares that a man who has laboured ought to possess in peace the fruits of his labour ; and that we should not require him to dispose of them before his death in order to secure their transmission to his children. Social utility imperatively requires that a man should be sure of preserving the fruits of his labour, in order that he may labour ; for without the constant and unwearied exertions of all its members, society would continue miserable. This same social utility requires, as imperatively also, that he have the right of transmitting it to his children, otherwise he would lose half his energy for labour. In a word, property does not exercise all its useful effects unless it be complete, that is, unless it be both personal and hereditary.\n\nTo establish this point, I shall not require more investigation than I did to establish those which have preceded.\n\nIt is desirable that man should labour, and in order that he should labour, the possession of what he produces is secured to him. This first security, personal and restricted as it is, is not enough. It may be enough to make him labour for a part of his life, but not for the whole, not enough to secure to him the greatest of all the delights of labour, that of transmitting his wealth to his children.\n\nMan has vices of every kind ; he occasionally shows the most atrocious with respect to his fellows ; but he rarely displays any towards his children. And the reason is, that far-sighted nature, wishing to secure the continuation of the human race, has deeply implanted paternal love in his heart, and has made this sentiment, not a virtue, but an irresistible instinct. The father [41] who robs and who murders, often gives to his offspring the goods he has stolen, and exerts for their protection the ferocity he has shown towards his neighbour. Observe now the majority of parents who have attained a certain age : for whom do they still labour, —for whom do they toil unceasingly, even when their strength begins to fail ? They labour for their children, and amid their toils they are cheered by the thought that their offspring will reap the fruit.\n\nLook at those skilful traders, who have enriched society by their ingenious discoveries, or by their bold commercial expeditions, to which we are indebted for the cheap rate at which we procure our cotton, our flax, our wool, our sugar ; —observe their tastes, the nature of their pleasures, and you will soon discover their spring of action. Most of their time, these plain men of simple tastes, to whom nature has given genius, but whom society has neglected to educate, and who, after amassing a great fortune, after having procured for their children mansions, costly furniture, masterpieces of art, tables sumptuously spread, horses fleet as Arab coursers, parks stored with game, —smile at the delight their children take in these objects, in their enjoyment find their own, —and then they proceed to enjoy themselves in their own fashion, invariably the same, by returning to their manufactures, their warehouses, their shops, —happy in the idea that all the wealth in which they take so little pleasure, will increase still more for the benefit of their children, in whose persons they become sensible to all those delicacies which they cannot appreciate, and which they have never known. Suppose them deprived of the right of transmitting to their descendants all they have amassed, they would be checked in the midst of their career, at the very moment when their faculties were most active. The more able and skilful they were, the sooner would they be checked, for they would [42] sooner have obtained all their simple tastes required, and for fear that they should have idle children, you would have commenced by ensuring the idleness of the parents,\n\nIt would be a lamentable way of preventing idlers in the world, to deprive the parents of the principal reason which excites them to labour. No doubt I shall be told that the industrious men of whom I have spoken, having devoted their lives to toil, would have continued toiling on, even though they had no children, simply from habit or competition. This might be the case with some, who become the rich uncles of the novel or the comedy. But whence did they derive the habit of that earnest labour ? In a society where property has excited the ardour of the whole body, and as a horse in a team gallops with the rest, so they run because all the world is running at their side. They would not have contracted this taste, or felt this rivalry of labour, in a society tamed down and chilled by the barbarous refusal of the right to bequeath their property to their descendants. They would have done like the fiery courser, who moves along slowly because his team-fellows do the same. But, finally, suppose that some, urged by the necessity of occupation, laboured solely for labour's sake, the barbarous, cold-blooded, unfeeling legislator, trifling with their sensibility, would have robbed them of one of the greatest sweets of labour. Look at that rich and childless man, whom nature has deprived of this deep satisfaction, sometimes so painful because it is so deep, —observe his loneliness, his disenchantment, his disgust, in proportion as he advances in life. At night, when he has counted his treasures, closed his coffers, he knows not what to do ; and if a moment is left for reflection, it is to inquire how he shall employ the wealth he has amassed. But he is fatigued with his day's toil, he falls asleep, and awakes in the morning to recommence his labours, and [43] again at night to feel the same loneliness, the same aching void as before. Then he applies to his brother or his sister, prays for one of their children, whom he adopts, endeavours to love, and to fancy that it is his own flesh and blood. Or else, if he have no nephews or nieces, he borrows of some poor woman an object of love, that may serve as the aim of all the exertions of his life.\n\nMust this void, then, in the childless man, be the fate of all those who, through habit or the necessity of constant occupation, watered the earth with their sweat, and laboured to enrich society ? It is a vain illusion. In your frozen society all ardour would be extinct, all rivalry limited ; you would have none of that ambition which kindles at the flame around them. Man, whose only object was self, would stop in the midst of his career as soon as he had acquired a provision for old age; and, as before observed, for fear of producing idleness in the son, you would have begun by enforcing idleness in the father !\n\nBut is it true, that by permitting the hereditary transmission of wealth, the son would necessarily be idle, consuming in sloth and debauchery the fortune bequeathed to him by his father ? In the first place, what after all does that wealth represent on which the supposed idleness of the son would be supported ? A prior labour, —that of the parent ; and by preventing the father from labouring that you may compel the son to labour in his own person, all that you will gain is this, —the son will have to do what the father has not done. There will not be an additional amount of labour. In the system of inheritances, on the contrary, to the unlimited labour of the father will be added the unlimited labour of the son ; for it is not true that the son will cease from toiling because his father has bequeathed him a greater or less amount of wealth. It is rare that the parent leaves to the child the means of [44] living without occupation. It is only in cases of extreme wealth that this happens, —as will be noticed presently. But ordinarily, in most professions, it is only a more advanced step in the road that a father procures for his son, by bequeathing to him his inheritance. He has set him farther on, has given him the means of labouring with greater resources, of being a farmer when he himself was a hired servant, of fitting out ten ships when he himself could only fit out one ; or else of changing his career, of rising from one to another, of becoming an attorney, physician, or barrister, —of being a Cicero or a Pitt, when he himself was a plain country squire like Cicero's father, or a cornet of dragoons, as was the father of William Pitt. In a word, he has led his son to a more advanced point in the great arena, gives his blessing as he sees him set out, and dies happy at witnessing his offspring moving onwards with a swifter pace. But the motive which has urged him to advance as far as possible, impels the son to do the same. As he thought of his children, and with this idea became indefatigable, the son thinks of his children also, and in his turn becomes unwearied too. Under a system which forbade all inheritance, the father would have stopped short, and so would the son : each generation, limited in its fertility, like a river whose waters are retained by a dike, would have given a part only of what it had in itself, and would have stopped short at the quarter or the half of what it was capable. On the contrary, under a system where property is hereditary, the parent labours as much as he can until the last day of his life ; the son, for whom he laboured thus, does the same for his children ; ceases not any more than his father did before him ; both looking forward to the future, toiling unceasingly for the benefit of their little ones, and not only for their benefit, but for that of the whole human race.\n\nIn conclusion, by the institution of personal [45] property, society gave man the only stimulus that could urge him to labour. One thing remained to be done, to render this stimulus unceasing. This society did, by the institution of hereditary property.\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nON THE RICH MAN.â©\n\nShowing that the accumulations resulting from property both personal and hereditary, compose what are called riches, which discharge many indispensable functions in society.\n\nFROM the guarantee of property to an individual and his children there will result accumulations of riches, more or less rapid, for the formation of which one generation sometimes suffices in the case of a man of great natural endowments, but which ordinarily require several generations ; and hence arise great fortunes, which attract the attention, like those enormous corn-stacks placed by the road-side on the borders of a fruitful farm. This sight, I am aware, offends the eyes of some, but what can be done ?\n\nI shall here repeat what I have already said with regard to the primary inequality of wealth originating, at the very outset of society, in the natural inequality of the human faculties, —that we must put up with them, because these greater shares of the general wealth have been taken from no one ; because to prevent them we must have checked mankind and said to them : Do not toil so much ; and finally, because each man profits by them, even the envious man, for if there [46] is more food, clothing, &c., these objects, so necessary to life, are cheaper to every body.\n\nIt is therefore a powerful consideration to leave these indefatigable labourers to themselves, as they take nothing from any one, and give something to all. But the offence to the eyes ? If this wealth offends some, it stimulates others, encourages, supports, and animates them, and in this encouragement society finds so many advantages for the whole body, that it may well pass by the envy excited in some of its members. But are these the only reasons, good as they appear to me, for permitting these accumulations ? are there no others ? We may easily decide for ourselves.\n\nUndoubtedly society does not desire that there should be only a single kind of labour, —manual labour. It desires also that there should be men who can put the compass to paper, measure the course of the stars, and teach the sailor how to navigate the trackless ocean ; that there should be others who can spend part of the day over the annals of nations to discover the cause of the prosperity or fall of empires, and teach men how to govern them. It is not the man who from morn to night remains bent over the soil or over a machine, who can find leisure for these pursuits. Sometimes, in truth, a peasant may become a Sforza [3], a compositor may be a Franklin, but these exceptions are rare. It is the sons of men devoted to manual labour who, being raised above their condition by an industrious father, will climb the steps of the social scale, and attain to these sublime labours of the understanding.\n\nThe sire was a peasant, a cotton-spinner, or a sailor before the mast. The son, if the father has been industrious, will become a farmer, a manufacturer, or the master of a ship. The grandson will become a banker, a lawyer, physician, barrister, or perhaps the ruler of a state. In this manner generations rise one above another, vegetate, as it were, like a tree, which at each [47] returning spring puts forth new shoots, which, fresh, tender, and green as the young grass, acquires in autumn the colour and consistency of wood, then having become small branches in the succeeding year, send forth in their turn other shoots,' and in time become stout limbs, until they overshadow the surrounding soil with their dense foliage.\n\nThus human vegetation goes on, and by degrees those rich classes of society are formed that are called idle, but which are not so, for the labour of mind is at least on a level with that of the hands, and must follow after it, if society have no wish to remain in a state of barbarism. I acknowledge that among these rich men there are some, unworthy descendants of prudent parents, who pass their time in riotous living, quaffing liquors that intoxicate the brain, and waste away in idleness and debauchery their youth, their fortune, and their health. Unhappily, this is too true ; but they will soon be punished. Their youth blighted before its time, their fortune spent before the close of their career, they will depart, sorrowful, poor, and disgraced, from those mansions which their parents had bequeathed them, which their insensate prodigality has transferred to the hands of rich men more prudent than themselves, and in one generation, we see labour rewarded in the father, idleness punished in the son. Envy, implacable envy, now art thou not comforted ?\n\nBut again, are the children of the wealthy always idle, debauched, and spendthrifts ? True, they do not labour like him who tills the ground or wields the hammer of the smith. And is there no other labour than that of the hands ? Must there not be men devoted to the study of nature, to the discovery of her laws, that they may be applied to the advantage of the human race, —men who may learn how to employ water, fire, and the elements, —who may learn to constitute and govern societies ? True, it is not always [48] the rich man that makes these sublime discoveries, although he does so occasionally; but it is he who encourages them, and helps to form that instructed public, for which the poor and modest scholar toils, —it is he who possesses extensive libraries, —it is he who reads Homer, Virgil, Dante, Newton, Descartes, Milton, Shakspeare, Bossuet, Moliere, Racine, and Montesquieu. If not himself, it is in his library, in his drawing-room, that they are read and appreciated, and where that enlightened society is collected together, —that society so polished, with tastes so practised and refined, —for which genius writes, sings, and covers the canvas with its magic colours. Sometimes the rich man himself is a good judge, sometimes also he is one of those eminent men who do not confine themselves to the mere enjoyment of the master-pieces of genius, but produce others of equal brilliancy. Sallust, Seneca, Montaigne, Buffon, Lavoisier, were all wealthy men. He is also the eminent statesman who presides over the destinies of his country.\n\nA plain English cotton-spinner, whose name is Peel, accumulates immense riches. Devoting his life to his manufactories, he has little knowledge of public affairs ; but he lavishes on his son every kind of learning, and the son rising above his father, combining the most extensive information with the influence of fortune, becomes one of the first statesmen of England ; and setting himself between the old and the new race, governs his country with a happy admixture of the old and the new spirit. Is it then a hateful sight, that a parent, after employing his faculties in a lucrative manner, should furnish his son with the means of employing them in a manner not less lucrative, but more noble and elevated ? Is it not right, is it not necessary, that one of these employments should come after the other ? Permit me to quote other examples which, in their time, provoked many an envious man.\n\n[49]\n\nIn that republic, the most fertile in riches and masterpieces of art, for it gave to the world Dante, Petrach, Boccacio, Machiavelli, Galileo, Ghiberti, Brunelleschi, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michael Angelo, —in that republic, which circulated through Europe cloth, silk, velvet, jewellery, and credit, there was a family of illustrious merchants, who have bequeathed their name to one o the three great ages of humanity —the Medici ! Do you think they have set a very bad example to the world ?\n\nJohn de Medici, in 1400, laid the foundations of the fortune of his race. Mild, prudent, and industrious, possessing in the highest degree the talent for commercial pursuits, he amassed great wealth, and shrinking, like a wise man, from public affairs, advised his children never to meddle with politics. \" Remember,\" said he, on his death-bed, \" that I never went to the old palace (the seat of government) until I was summoned (che chiamato).\"\n\nFortunately his advice was not followed. His son, Cosmo, surrounded by the most able masters, learned in the sciences, arts, and policy, possessing a bold genius, mingled, notwithstanding his father's counsel, in public affairs ; was proscribed ; re-called with enthusiasm ; did not govern, but influenced the Florentine republic during thirty years ; built the beautiful family palace of the Ricardi; lived familiarly with Masaccio, Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Poggio ; founded Greek schools at Florence ; still further added to the wealth of his family, and all the while, though politic and learned, remained a merchant. This merchant, however, quitted his country-house at certain festivals for the charming retirement of Cafiagiolo, and there read guess what he read ! the dialogues of Plato, which Poggio had translated for him, and for which he payed a heavy sum in gold. [50] His son, Peter, survived him not long, and the glory of the house descended to his grandson —to him whom posterity has never ceased to love and admire, under the name of Lorenzo the Magnificent. He, still more disobedient to the counsel of his ancestor, entirely neglected commerce, and was only the scholar and politician. Educated with Politian and Pico de la Mirandola, a poet and cavalier, excelling in all bodily exercises, ugly as Socrates, winning as Alcibiades, not less wise as a statesman than irresistible as a negociator, he saved his country when threatened by a general coalition ; conciliated by the mildness of his administration all the courts of Italy, and procured for them a solid peace of fifteen years' duration, which Italian historians have called the \" golden age\" of their country ; wrote exquisite verses ; sought throughout Europe for the most valuable Greek and Latin manuscripts, the finest statues of antiquity, and gave Michael Angelo to the world ; charmed and dazzled by his magnificence the Italian princes whom he had attracted to Florence with a view to the general concord ; thought of everything except his own fortune, which he lavished and compromised, but so notoriously to the public interest, that grateful Florence declared the treasures of the Medici and of the state to be but one, and dying, carried with him the happiness of his country to his tomb ; for the prudence which had rendered her so happy expiring with him, the French and Germans fell upon Italy, ravaged her fair soil for half a century, and made her what she still is —a slave !\n\nWould it have been better if this striking phenomenon of hereditary transmission had never existed ? That the fortune of the Medici ceasing with John, Cosmo had been obliged to spend his life in re-commencing it ; that ceasing again with Cosmo, Lorenzo [51] should have been forced to begin again ; and that neither of them had found time to cultivate the art?, literature, and the science of government ?\n\nThese agglomerations of fortune, the necessary consequences of labour excited without limit, procure, therefore, the leisure necessary for the cultivation of the higher sciences. They form that social region where genius does not always have its birth, but where sometimes it comes into being ; and where it needs to dwell that it may be appreciated, excited, and encouraged. Thus, in her profound meditations, nature, left to herself, makes one relation of things correspond to a thousand others. The man who labours must have the means of becoming rich, that he may have an object for his exertions ; and at the same time, in becoming rich, he creates for his children this leisure of mind. Thus, in the universe, all is connected ; all is mutually balanced and supported ; all is contrasted, though without opposition, and forms a thousand harmonious tints, like a picture by the hand of a skilful and gifted artist.\n\nIs this the rich man's only part on the stage of the world ? The son, enriched by the labours of the father, possesses not only his well-stored library and his costly paintings, but a mansion filled with sumptuous furniture, tables groaning beneath the load of dishes, fleet-footed steeds, and elegant chariots. Tell me, ye philosophers of envy, must we have all these things in society ? Are you quakers, hating all glitter, loving only black and white, or perhaps grey as the only permitted variety ; or will you admit that in the productions of all society, we must have diversity in abundance, delicacy, elegance —in a word, beauty ?\n\nWhatever may be your personal tastes, which I suspect are not those of quakers, permit me to teach you the law of all production. When men do not produce much, they produce badly and dearly ; and if [52] they produce much, they produce more or less well, in consequence of the inequality of the human faculties, —a cause always in action. Generally they begin by producing badly, then tolerably, and end by producing well, very well, and then to perfection ; and while they advance in this manner, they always keep that inevitable distance from the lower to the middling production, and from the middling to the superior. Either there is no progress at all, or we have these three terms. Either we shall have the vale of Tempe, inhabited by shepherds, eating the flesh of their flocks, and wearing their wool, —shepherds whom the poets describe as innocent, but whom I affirm to be rude and brutal, often indulging in ignoble vices, having their Cains if they have their Abels ; and their poor also, a hundred times more hideous than those of London or Paris, for they are the Cretins, bearing on their necks the marks of physical misery, and on their idiot features the marks of moral misery ; or we shall have that Tale of Tempe, a society in continual movement, and in which are found those inevitable terms, the inferior, the middling, and the superior production. If society desires to progress, it must of necessity proceed from one to the other of these terms. Does it desire to have things cheap ? It is still indispensable that these three terms should be combined, as cheapness results from the reversion of the expenses of the first on the second, of the second on the third. Let us see how this applies to agricultural produce. Wheat, rye, and potatoes, following one another in the soil so as to leave no part unproductive, mutually support each other. The high price of wheat permits the farmer to sell his rye at a lower rate ; the moderate price of rye permits him to sell his potatoes at a rate still lower. In manufacturing produce, there is the same reciprocity of support. Fifty years ago, when cotton-spinning was first introduced into France, the [53] manufacturers began by producing badly and dearly, then less badly and less dearly, and at last well and cheaply. They continue spinning more finely the fine, the middling, and the coarse, and producing cheaper every day, owing to the reversion of the expenses from one to the other. The same phenomenon occurs in the case of those elegant tissues of wool, that once were sought in the valleys of Thibet, and which, half a century back, were seen only on the graceful shoulders of the wealthy lady, but which now adorn those of women in easy circumstances, and have permitted the modest wives of the labouring classes to wear the produce of the merino sheep. If the fine tissue of cashmere were not produced, it would be impossible to produce at a low rate the merino shawl. The handsome thoroughbred horses on which the dissipated son of the rich man gallops through his park, compensate the trainer for raising the less comely beasts which mount our cavalry, or the stout horse which drags the plough. But who will pay for these choicer, finer, rarer productions, if there are no accumulations of fortune in the hands of a lucky few, whom past or present labour has enriched ? Thus riches, mediocrity, and poverty aid each other, and pay less dearly, because they pay together, the different states of human industry.\n\nNo doubt it would be better were there wheaten bread for every mouth ; cashmere shawls for every woman ; Arab coursers for every horseman. Alas ! why does it not depend upon us to feed with the most nutritious aliments ; to clothe with the choicest produce of the loom ; to lodge in the healthiest dwellings, that people whom we love much more than they who flatter them, whose plain common sense we appreciate when it has not been corrupted ? But is that in the power of science, either ancient or modern ?\n\nGod has willed that man should begin on this earth with the acorn, that he may end, in consequence of his [54] labour, with wheaten bread ; and it seems to me that, since he has desired to make happiness the reward of labour, and life a scene of trial, we ought to bow down humbly before such a plan.\n\nThese choice aliments, those beautiful and healthy garments which you envy in the rich, the poor will have some day! yes, they will have them, provided society continues to labour some time longer. An idle v promise, say you. Not so idle, if we judge by the past. Three or four centuries ago, kings in their palaces trod on floors strewn with fresh gathered leaves or straw ; now, the humble tradesman walks on carpets gay as the flowery fields in spring. To attain this result, society has laboured for ages. Let it still toil on, and what now is the privilege of the rich man only, will be the possession of the poor. But when society has reached this point, the fine-spun web will be finer still, and there always will be required wealth, competence, and mediocrity (it will no longer be poverty, I hope), to correspond with the three states of all human industry, to pay for the superior, middling, and inferior produce ; for industry in progress is like a marble column, with its capital, its shaft, and its base.\n\nSee what takes place in all political and social disturbances. More alarming to the rich than to the poor, they terrify the former, make him averse to all the enjoyments of luxury, and from that moment all prosperity is checked. Men cry out against the rich, oppress them with taxes, attack the high functionaries of state and reduce their salaries, and then the general distress increases in proportion as the consumption of the objects of luxury is the more completely interrupted. Then there is another cry: Industry must be supported ; the means of doing so are sought, and in the support given to this or that manufacture, in premiums on exportation, by which the foreigner alone profits, more is expended than has been gained [55] by taxes badly assessed, or by reductions ill understood. We are then obliged to reconstruct, badly and incompletely, what it would have been sufficient to have left alone, and we resemble those children who, carried away by their instinct for destruction, desire to replant the flowers they have uprooted, or recall to life the harmless animal they have killed.\n\nI have not yet described all the functions of riches in society. It has another part to play, besides that of purchasing those refined objects whose production and consumption are indispensable ; wealth alone can furnish capital to inventive genius —to daring, rash genius, often liable to be deceived, and to ruin those who provide the funds. Here, for instance, is an invention which will change the face of the world ; the inventor extols it and represents it to be, what it really is, a miracle. But others have said the same of the most ridiculous inventions. A trial must be made, large sums must be risked, and he who risks must be able to lose. Can the poor man, the man of a simple competency, do this? The hope of gain sometimes lures them on, and by this temerity they lose in an hour the modest fruits of their economy. Far from stimulating them, they ought, on the contrary, to be discouraged. But the rich man, who has more than he needs for his living, can afford to lose, and therefore can risk ; and while he indulges in the dissipations of elegant society, or in the tumult of politics, or the pleasures of foreign travel, leaving his accumulated capital at his banker's, he confides to him his superfluities, which serve as an encouragement to fresh enterprises. He is little to be pitied if he loses. He becomes all the richer if he gains, and may encourage some genius bolder still.\n\nThus the inequality of riches, which already corresponds to the wants of human industry, always unequal in its productions, alone also has the means of being [56] daring as genius. The last part still remains to be played, which completes the character of wealth in this world, and this time gnawing envy will not love it the more, but will at least be condemned to silence. It may be charitable. No doubt the ric"
