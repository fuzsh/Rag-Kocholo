        "text": "T.7 Five Articles on \"The Canal beside the Adour\" (18 June 1837, La Chalosse )↩\n\nSource\n\nT.7 (1837.06.18) \"The Canal beside the Adour\" (Canal latéral à l'Adour), 5 articles, 18 June 1837 - 20 Aug. 1837, La Chalosse , nos. 28-37. [JCPD]\n\nEditor's Introduction\n\n[Map of Les Landes]\n\nLa Chalosse is a wine-growing region in the Département of Les Landes which has Dax as its major town. It lies in the foothills of the Pyrénées to the south of the Adour river. Bastiat's home town of Mugron is located there.\n\nLa Chalosse was a local weekly newspaper published in the town of Saint-Sever. It appeared between December 1836 and March 1876. Bastiat's first published piece in the journal was this series on \"The Canal beside the Adour\" (18 June-20 Aug. 1837). He then published two more in 1838 on \"Reflections on the Question of Dueling\" (Feb. 1838) and \"On the Basque Language\" (April, 1838). Bastiat went to a school in Saint-Sever for a year in 1813 and stood unsuccessfully for election to the local council in 1832 and 1842.\n\nWhen Bastiat wrote these articles in June 1837 he was a relatively young man of 36 years and had described himself a couple of years earlier as \"un simple agriculteur\" (a simple farmer). This was not entirely true as he had inherited land from his grandfather in 1825 in the wine growing region of La Chalosse and had acquired more property by means of a dowry when he married in 1831. His total estate of about 250 hectares (617 acres) was used for wine growing on the south side (left bank) of the Adour river, some general farming, and sharecropping by 150 farmers. The income he received from this pushed him into the top 5% of income earners, thus giving him the right to both vote and to stand for election under the very restricted franchise which existed during the July Monarchy.\n\nDuring his late 20s he had been involved in liberal politics in the last years of the Restoration which reached a high point with his late-night assistance on August 5, 1830 in persuading the officers of the Bayonne garrison to side with the new King Louis Philippe (from the junior Orléanist branch of the family) and not with the overthrown Bourbon King Charles X, thus making it impossible for the overthrown King's Bourbon relative King Ferdinand VII of Spain to come to his military rescue via the south of France. Following the installation of the new monarchy which had some liberal inclinations, Bastiat had hoped to get some position in the new regime, either as an elected representative for the arrondissement of Dax (failed 6 July 1831) or St. Sever (failed 11 July 1832, and again 9 July 1842), or as a local magistrate (Justice of the Peace) in the canton of Mugron (successful 28 May 1832), and finally election to the General Council of Les Landes (successful 17 November 1833; reelected 1839).\n\nIt was as a General Councillor that Bastiat had the opportunity and the means to begin commenting in detail on economic matters which came before the Council. He had easy access to government reports and economic data, an audience of 27 other Councillors, and a brief to discuss local economic matters such as local roads, railways, canals, and other public works; the regulation of local fairs and markets; the administration of departmental property; and the collection of direct taxes such as the land tax. He did this with both formal memoranda he wrote and presented to the General Council as well as articles he published in the local press in which he spoke as a respected Council member to various local interest groups. Before he made his breakthrough into the world of the Parisian political economists with his article on \"French and English Tariffs\" in October 1844 he wrote half a dozen other works on specific economic topics which show his gradual development as an economic analyst, especially his skill at handling economic data. These essays were on tariff reform, the building of public works such as the Adour canal, the taxation of wine, the reform of the Post Office, and the direct tax on land:\n\n\"Reflections on the Petitions from Bordeaux, Le Havre, and Lyons Relating to the Customs Service\" (April 1834) (in CW2, pp. 1-9.)\n\n\"The Canal beside the Adour\" (June 1837) (CW4, below pp. 000)\n\n\"The Tax Authorities and Wine\" (Jan. 1841) (CW2, pp. 10-23.)\n\n\"Memoir Presented to the Société d'agriculture on \"The Wine-Growing Question\" (Jan 1843) (CW2, pp.25-42.)\n\n\"Postal Reform\" (Aug. 1844) (CW4, below pp. 000)\n\n\"On the Division of the Land Tax in the Department of Les Landes\" (c. 1844) (CW4, below pp. 000)\n\nAs a group, the essays show a growing ability over a period of 10 years to use and analyse economic data which Bastiat gets from government reports and other official publications. He seems to have been an advocate of free trade right from the beginning as his 1834 analysis of the inconsistencies of the petitioners from Bordeaux, Le Havre, and Lyons demonstrate. Bastiat argues that if free trade in agriculture is good for consumers (and the nation), then free trade in manufacturing will also be good for exactly the same reasons of lower costs, greater efficiencies, and the expansion of trade in general. In \"The Tax Authorities and Wine\", the \"Memoir Presented to the Société d'agriculture on Wine-Growing,\" and \"On the Division of the Land Tax\" he argues that existing government policies on tariffs on wine, other indirect taxes, city tolls (octroi), and the tax on land seriously hamper economic development in Les Landes and impact ordinary working people the most. In \"Postal Reform\" we see him beginning to argue that the radical reforms introduced in England can and should also be applied in France and he uses very detailed French economic data on the costs of letter delivery to make the case.\n\nAlthough Bastiat is becoming a skilled analyst of economic data during this period he is still not yet the master of economic theory he was to become later and we only see brief glimpses here of some of the original insights that he was to develop between 1847 and 1850 when he was working on his treatise, Economic Harmonies . These are indicated in the footnotes when they appear. We do see however, some of his earliest uses of French literature to make his economic points which was to become so much a part of his work in the Economic Sophisms which were written between 1845 and the end of 1847. See for example, \"The Tax Authorities and Wine\" (Jan. 1841) in which he cites La Fontaine and Molière, and \"Memoir Presented to the Société d'agriculture on Wine-Growing\" (Jan 1843) in which he cites his favourite radical poet Béranger twice. This would become what I have called his distinctive \"Rhetoric of Liberty.\"\n\nSome of the economic ideas expressed here in \"the early Bastiat\" are quite conventional and only hint at the original and very interesting ideas he would develop in his later works. For example:\n\nhe still talks a great deal about the interests of \"the nation\"; he was to downplay this later in order to focus more on the interests of individual consumers\n\nin his discussion of the Adour canal there is an attempt to provide a cost benefit analysis of government expenditure but no sense of the \"opportunity cost\" of this kind of government activity. The idea that the money spent by government funded public works projects (\"the seen\") is money that is taken from and thus not spent by consumers (\"the unseen\") would become central to his chapter 5 on \"Public Works\" in What is Seen and What is Not Seen (July 1850).\n\nalso in this essay is an older and more limited understanding of what constitutes productive labour (or what he would later call \"effort\"). Here he limits \"productive labour\" to agriculture, manufacturing, and trade, and makes no mention of other activities which create \"non-material\" goods or services which are also of value to consumers. He was to greatly expand this idea of \"services\" in Economic Harmonies . He also dismisses as \"unproductive\" the living off rents from land. When he later came to argue with Proudhon over this matter at the end of 1849, he was to completely reverse his position.\n\nrelated to this, is his use of the term \"la classe\" (class), especially in the phrases \"la classe laborieuse\" (the working or labouring class) and \"la classe oisive\" (the idle class). This notion of class is one increasingly used by socialists throughout this period and which would reach a climax in the 1848 Revolution when steps were taken to limit the power or even outlaw by legislation those who lived from \"unproductive\" or \"exploitative\" activities such as rent on land, interest on capital, and profits from employing wage labour. There was another theory of class which was also current at the time Bastiat wrote this essay, namely the \"industrialist theory\" of class developed by classical liberals whom Bastiat had read, such as Charles Comte, Charles Dunoyer, and Augustin Thierry. Bastiat would take this up in earnest in his later writings about \"plunder\", but here for some reason he ignores this tradition and uses the more common, socialist version.\n\nIt is interesting to speculate when Bastiat changed his mind about the nature of productive work (and the part played by services) and adopted the \"industrialist\" theory of exploitation and class which plays such an important part in his later work. I believe that there are hints of this new way of thinking towards the end of his long introduction to his book on Cobden and the League (1845) which suggests that his research on Cobden and the Anti-Corn Law League which he had undertaken in 1843-44 made him view classical economic theory in a new light. Cobden very much viewed the ruling and agricultural elites which benefited from the protectionist corn laws as an \"oligarchy\" which plundered ordinary English workers and consumers. Bastiat soon came to view the French political system in a very similar light.\n\nBastiat mentioned canals and canal building in several of his works. This is not surprising as the building of transport infrastructure, whether roads, canals, or railroads, was a crucial aspect of the industrial revolution. The question was not whether or not this infrastructure building was needed or not, but how it should be owned, financed, and run. The three main options were fully privately owned, funded, and operated roads, canals, and railways (which were more common in England); government owned, financed, and run operations (the eventual European model); or government licensed, private monopolies which were privately run but ultimately backed by government loans or bail-outs in case of failure (or a mixture of the last two). The latter was commonly used in France and the United States. As we can see from Bastiat's essay here, the building and financing of canals was a major concern of regional governments like Les Landes during the 1820s and 1830s. In the late 1830s and 1840s attention shifted to the building and financing of railways, and the decision to plan and build the 6 major lines (and their corresponding stations) which radiated out from Paris into the provinces, became a major topic of debate (as well as financial scandal at times).\n\nSome examples of his references to canals include:\n\nThere is an amusing fragment which was probably written at the same time as his articles on the Adour canal in which he wryly comments on the mania for speculation in shares in canal building companies which was sweeping France.\n\nin a letter to the editors of Le National (Nov. 1846) he states that an example of a \"good tax\" is one that taxes 1 franc from each citizen to fund the building of a canal which reduces transport costs by 5 or 6 millions francs for the entire nation\n\nthere are references to canals in several economic sophisms: ES1 9 \"An Immense Discovery\" (Oct. 1845); ES1 10 \"Reciprocity\" (Oct. 1845); ES1 16 \"Blocked Rivers pleading in favor of the Prohibitionists\" (late 1845); and ES2 7 \"A Chinese Tale\" (late 1847). The latter in particular, is a lengthy and amusing story about a Chinese Emperor who decides to increase \"employment\" for his people by ordering that a fully functioning canal be filled in with large boulders in order to stimulate economic activity in building a new road alongside the canal. Bastiat would later apply this same witty reasoning to railways in \"A Negative Railway.\"\n\nFirst Article\n\nI am proposing to submit to readers of La Chalosse a few thoughts on the proposed canal which would run parallel to the Adour, concerning which the government has just ordered some surveys. It seemed to me useful to devote this first article to an account of the facts which led to this decision.\n\nA few years back the Engineers of the Departement of the Landes produced a plan with respect to navigation on the Adour.\n\nThis plan consisted in improving or strengthening with a network of supporting stakes:\n\n1. The bed of the Lower Adour as far as the mouth of the Midouze:\n\n2. That of the Midouze as far Mont-de-Marsan;\n\n3. That of the High Adour as far as Mugron and eventually on to St. Sever.\n\nWith regard to this third and last part of the project, however, the engineers drew attention to some serious difficulties and could not proclaim the benefits involved as anything more than uncertain.\n\nIt was no doubt in view of this consideration, that the government and the Chambers decided to deal only with the Lower Adour and the Midouze, to whose improvement a sum of 900,000 francs was allocated.\n\nThis decision brought protests from those who dwelt beside the High Adour. They recalled that in former times the navigability of the river had made their ancestors prosperous and they could not without distress see it about to be abandoned.\n\nIn fact, however, M. Durrieu, the spokesman for their grievances, managed to get their voices heard. The government granted 60,000 francs, but only for the improvement of the worst stretches of the Higher Adour between Hourquet and Mugron, with the further reservation that 10,000 francs be employed in advance for preliminary investigations. At the same time it instructed M. de Baudre, Divisional Inspector of the Royal Corps of Bridges and Roads, to visit the places in question and make an official report on the controversy between engineers and local complainants.\n\nUnfortunately, the reports of M. de Baudre coincided overwhelmingly with those of the Engineers. They were even more unfavorable to us, for, having seen the rapid descent of the river, the enormous beds of gravel that it sweeps along, its sides devoid of all embankments to which the various works could be secured, he declared himself not only against the improvements envisaged, but even against the investigations which were then being carried out.\n\nWas it really necessary, however, to abandon for good the High Adour Basin, a region enriched by navigation which in times past had reached as far up as Aire, and later on to Grenade and recently to St. Sever? Would there no longer be the hope of keeping it going even to Mugron? Surely M. de Baudre and M. de Silguy could not be thinking on any such lines.\n\nIndeed it would have been less distressing for the High Adour Basin never to have enjoyed navigable access than to see that access gradually cut off across the centuries until in our time it was blocked entirely.\n\nThere is one misfortune for people worse than lacking markets for their trade, namely losing ones which they have enjoyed since time immemorial. In the first case a population will adjust. It will produce little but seek to provide for all its needs. When, however, access to trade has led it to expand indefinitely on a very restricted range of production, it is easy to see that should its markets happen to vanish, it will suffer terribly, deprived as it is of goods on which it depends, whilst its own production is of no use either for local consumption or trade.\n\nThis is exactly the situation of the Chalosse, which for this reason, and for others outside the scope of this article, endures all the pains of a decline rendered all the more frightful in that there appears no hope of an end to it.\n\nNaturally another thought presents itself: if the bed of the High Adour could not be improved, at least its waters could be used by a parallel canal.\n\nThis thought had sprung in the first instance from the patriotic mind of the famous General Lamarque, who had developed it in a report in which it was hard to know whether most to admire the opinions of the expert administrator, the foresight of the great officer, or the talents of the brilliant writer.\n\nSoon the thought had taken on in M. Galabert's projects those colossal dimensions which aroused so much hope and gained so little support.\n\nThe famous engineer Brisson reduced the idea to a less monumental scale, but one still huge enough to seem to be dealing with proposals rather than realities.\n\nFinally, M. Silguy, Chief Engineer of the Departement of the Landes, has transformed it into a plan which has the merit of being easily and immediately put into operation, without excluding future amendments conceived on a much larger scale, this plan being at once complete in itself but also the basis for the realization of the much grander schemes of its predecessors.\n\nThis plan consists in opening a shipping and irrigation canal parallel to the river Adour, from the point where the river Arros flows into it, as far as the point where its utility for shipping is assured by the allocation of the 900,000 francs already spoken of in our text.\n\nIt is research into the feasibility of this project, one favorably received by the General Council of Les Landes, which has just been commissioned.\n\nSecond Article\n\nAny productive enterprise is to be evaluated by the comparison of the expense it incurs with the benefits which it produces. We may think it useful, before trying to establish the benefits the people may expect from the Canal parallel to the Adour, to call the reader's attention to the probable costs of this operation.\n\nIt is true that it is impossible at this time to set an overall figure. This is an unknown, the determining of which is reserved for the preliminary studies which the government has ordered only very recently.\n\nIf we do touch on this question, however, it is because it subsumes another of extreme importance, one which is particularly vital to the Chalosse and the answer to which, it seems to us, ought to serve as the rule, even in the studies which are at present underway.\n\nWe said in the previous article that the question at issue was a canal both for navigation and irrigation. Certainly irrigation is in our view an essential condition of the project, since it is what makes its carrying out possible by assuring entrepreneurs an income. Indeed the next thing we will attempt to prove is that it will bring about a complete revolution in our agricultural system.\n\nThe more evident the benefits of irrigation, however, the more it is to be feared that the Corps of Engineers for Roads and Bridges will let itself be drawn into wishing to spread them too widely.\n\nIs the projected canal to be far away from the Adour? This is a very serious question which it behooves public opinion to bring to a head.\n\nIf it is distant, this will permit a much vaster extent of land to be irrigated, but it will also increase costs by some indefinite amount, because to carry a larger volume of water, the canal will have to be built with much larger dimensions.\n\nTo build it closer to the river will restrict the benefits but also contain the costs.\n\nWithout hesitation we plump for the latter plan, because we are quite convinced that any project requiring very sizeable capital would be destined to be buried in the government files.\n\nLocating the Canal far from the Adour would also involve the immense inconvenience of disrupting all the customary activity and of violently uprooting, if I may dare to speak thus, the entire flow of economic activity which takes place there at present.\n\nWe should not lose sight of the aim of the Canal, which is to offer an alternative to the shipping on the Adour, which has provided an occupation for riverside populations from time immemorial. It is the impossibility of improving the bed of the river that has led to the idea of opening up a parallel water-way. To take away this shipping from the natural entrepots of the Chalosse — Aire, Grenade, St. Sever, Mugron — would be to wander away entirely from the purpose in hand.\n\nWe will return later to this subject; but we have had to make haste to note these reflections here, because we have been given reason to fear that the formerly extremely modest ideas of the engineer who has been charged with the management of these studies, may have taken off in a new direction, since the government has given signs of an interest in this enterprise.\n\nIn the past the talk was of a canal with rather small traffic. Its dimensions had to be very modest. It had to supply irrigation to a small stretch of land only, which entailed its being close to the Adour. We think we even know the evaluation put on the costs of the project: some three million .\n\nWe are engaging M. de Silguy to continue with this project, and to resist that desire which all distinguished men have, to attach their names to some monumental achievement. We repeat that a canal too far from the Adour would do much good only after it had done much that was bad, and, which settles the matter, would be unfeasible.\n\nAs for the figure of three million which we spoke of above, we are aware that in the absence of prior investigations, it can be only an approximation, at least if one holds to the idea of not letting oneself be dragged into vast schemes.\n\nIf one cannot determine yet, however, the precise amount of the expenses, one can at least have some notion as to whether it will exceed the average of what canals with modest shipping have cost in France, or stay below that figure. All one needs for that is to work out whether the territory to be crossed must be ranked with those which present the most difficulty or those which present the least.\n\nWell, between Plaisance and Le Hourquet, no serious obstacle presents itself. No water needs to be searched for a long way off; no reservoir has to be built; no mountains needs to be penetrated, no troughs need filling in, no rivers to be bridged, no roads to be crossed.\n\nMaterials are there in abundance the whole way.\n\nThe land involved, the manpower, and the means of transport can be obtained at the most modest of prices.\n\nFinally, the soil is of the kind most favorable to the conservation of the water.\n\nM. de Brisson has shown that canals with limited shipping have cost, on average , 57,000 francs per kilometer and 15,000 francs per metre of gradient.\n\nUsing these guides, the cost of the Canal alongside the Adour would amount to,\n\n72 kilometres at 57,000 francs per km 4,104,000 Fr 7 metres of gradient at 15,000 fr per metre 105,000 Fr. Total 4,209,000 Fr.\n\nGiven what we have said about the absence of difficulties along the whole route, we are justified in hoping that the figure of three million is very close to the mark.\n\nThird Article\n\nThere are only three direct sources of wealth: agriculture, manufacturing, and trade. To create primary materials, to make changes in their shape and location: such is more or less the whole circle of productive activity.\n\nAnother aspect of the matter is that no agent can exert a more favorable influence on each one of these three elements of national prosperity than water does.\n\nNo modification of agriculture could be more lasting than irrigation, no motors could improve factories more than waterpower does, and no means of transport could be more powerful for commerce than navigable waterways.\n\nProduction is not the sole function of society; society also has both an interest and a duty to conserve and defend that production.\n\nWe could thus think about the canal alongside the Adour from the agricultural, manufacturing, or military point of view.\n\nMost of these questions have been dealt with by General Lamarque, so superbly, indeed, as to impose a rule of silence on his successors. So I will not deal with them.\n\nI ask only that I be permitted to draw the attention of the readers of La Chalosse to the question of irrigation. This is where, as I see it, M. de Silguy's ideas are exceptional . This subject, moreover, will give me the chance to point out a few ideas, not entirely new, but rather commonly scorned or neglected.\n\nTo get an idea of the importance of water to agriculture, all you need is to compare the value and productivity of two different hectares of land, located moreover in the same circumstances, save that only one of them has been irrigated . It is well known in all countries that the result is a doubling of output.\n\nOne would be making a great mistake, however, if one were to judge on the basis of irrigation defined in this way, what it might be when carried out on a grand scale and supplied to a whole country.\n\nIn the first case one can evaluate only the direct influence of the water; in the second, in addition to this immediate result, there develops a whole series of mutually generated effects, some of which are perhaps more important than the one which gave birth to them. Let us be the judges.\n\nA country which is not watered, above all if it is exposed to the influence of burning heat, always possesses little grassland, and is consequently short of fodder, while livestock and consequently fertilizer are scarce. In consequence, in order to put livestock to pasture and obtain fodder, it must keep a lot of land vacant and resort to leaving land fallow. This already represents an immense loss in the value of the land. Necessarily there is added to this a no less considerable loss of labor-power, in the care of flocks and herds, the upkeep of fencing, the transport of enormous masses of fodder, endless weeding, etc, a condition which remains until the country has access to irrigation.\n\nThen the pastures multiply, and with them the livestock and the manure. The good land improves and the unused land is cleared under the triple influence of water, fertilizer, and crop rotation. The costs of cultivation fall relative to the value of the products. The soil grows in value and fertility. The population increases in number and well-being.\n\nSuch are the general effects of irrigation. There are others which make themselves felt most markedly on the farms on the banks of the Adour, because of their exceptional situation – which is something I must explain. The right bank of the Adour presents initially a strip of good soil produced by the alluvium of the river. Behind this good soil vast heaths or moors stretch away. For the most part these two types of terrain are separated by marshland, formed by rainwater, which, falling on the moors, is prevented by the alluvial strip from draining into the river.\n\nMost of the farms are composed of these three types of land in varying proportions.\n\nThis mix of different kinds of land, along with the hot climate and the sandy nature of the soil, makes it clear to the inhabitants what kind of agriculture is required.\n\nOn good land people produce as much cereal as possible. On this kind of terrain the fields would soon be exhausted and invaded by weeds . But the first difficulty could be circumvented by bringing in enormous masses of compost from the surface layer of the moorlands and the second by weeding and fallow farming. An agriculture so simple and based exclusively on manual labor could be, and in fact was, abandoned to share-cropping.\n\nTo describe here all the fatal consequences of share-cropping would be to pile article onto article. I will limit myself to indicating them in a very general way, leaving the reader to apply them at will.\n\nGood agriculture like good anything else, requires the combination of three things: will, knowledge, and power .\n\nWill is bound to be sluggish in the case of share-croppers, since all expenditure of effort over and above what is absolutely indispensable, is an undertaking in which all the costs fall on them and half the profit goes to someone else.\n\nAs for scientific knowledge , it would be absurd to look for it in a class of men lacking in everything, even will.\n\nSharecropping is equally deficient in power . Only the master could devote some capital to the land; but he reasons in respect of such expenditure in the same way as the share-cropper does in respect of labor, and he knows that he will get back only half of the profit from investments he would have to finance entirely on his own.\n\nThus all agriculture under share-cropping is apathetic, humdrum, and poor.\n\nIf we switch our attention from the work to the worker, we will be struck by a no less deplorable spectacle.\n\nA uniform agriculture produces a uniform diet: bread and water and some salted meat, such is the food regime of the Landais peasant.\n\nClothing is not comfortable either in a country which lacks the raw materials and the means of making them .\n\nIt suffices, if one wants to get an idea of the dwellings, to remember that they are in the exclusive charge of the proprietor, who does not use them.\n\nFinally, this badly nourished, badly clothed, and badly housed population, is further decimated by the endemic fever which the marshland produces and spreads to the countryside.\n\nI could round off this sad account if I added to it a sketch of the intellectual and moral state of this unfortunate class, but this would take me too far from my subject.\n\nI will summarize therefore, in order of their causation, the obstacles which, on the right bank of the Adour, stand in the way of agricultural progress and the well-being of the inhabitants:\n\nBurning sun, arid soil.\n\nInevitable lack of pasture, livestock, and fertilizer.\n\nAn immense proportion of uncultivated land.\n\nAn agriculture which drains and wastes alluvial soils.\n\nShare-cropping; lack of energy, knowledge, and capital.\n\nA population badly fed, badly clothed, badly housed, and ravaged by periodic illness.\n\nFourth Article\n\nThus far I have considered the Canal by the Adour only in its connections with the right bank of this river.\n\nIn trying to establish that it was conducive alike to manufacturing by way of waterpower, to commerce by facilitating shipping, and to agriculture by means of irrigation, I wanted to show it, if I may put it thus, as an immense and versatile motor, at work across the whole length of our region, bringing a powerful forward momentum to all the activity which takes place there.\n\nIt remains for me to consider its effects on the left bank of the Adour or on the Chalosse. My initial thought is that it would be hard to understand how all types of production could be undergoing a sizeable development all around us, without our taking some share in that growth in well-being and prosperity.\n\nSome worthy souls, however, without exactly denying the general benefits of the Canal, have expressed the fear that it might be more hurtful than helpful to the particular interests of the Chalosse. \"To create a means of communication,\" they have said, \"which puts our vineyards up against the Madiran, is to subject them to ruinous competition\".\n\nFear of competition is the eternal stumbling block of all economic progress. If this were the prevailing question with regard to the shipping on the Adour, I have to ask, where ought it to start? Grenade could establish that competition from Aire is to be feared and that the navigability of the river will be a scourge if the boats just sail past their storehouse doors. St. Sever could say the same about Grenade; Mugron could about St. Sever; Laurede about Mugron; and if such an argument is absurd on a district to district basis, I cannot work out why it should become decisive from province to province.\n\nWhat a strange contradiction! We want roads and we do not want canals, which are only much improved roads. The ability to engage in economic tran sactions, however, is either useful or disastrous. If the former we must welcome the canals; in the latter case we must reject the roads. If competition is in itself a bad thing, the isolation of empires, provinces, and districts must be the aim and outcome of all civilization.\n\nMoreover, one should not be surprised at the fears, even the exaggerated ones, of the Chalosse. The process of decay which is dragging the place down is so rapid that we must take seriously even its fears, which resemble those of an ill person whom real dangers make scared of imaginary ones.\n\nTwo interests, so it seems to me, must be the concern of the Chalosse: to win new markets for its wines; and to improve all its other sources of income.\n\nTo know whether the Canal will help or hinder the distribution of its wines, we have to look into the causes which have brought their distribution to a halt, and when we undertake this examination, we will find all these factors operating in a region where the canal would have no impact on them. It is not by perfecting our means of transport that we succeed in modifying the system of the prohibition of trade, the thousand shackles created by indirect taxation, the thousand barriers caused by municipal taxes on merchandise (the octroi), or the apparently fixed preference consumers have for red wine.\n\nAmong the causes of our distress, however, there is one which will inevitably be affected by the Canal beside the Adour, namely, competition. It is important therefore to see what brought about this competition, what kind of future it is preparing for us, and how it can be modified by the Canal which is our present concern.\n\nTwo principal issues seem to me to make competition frightening with regard to the present and above all for the future of my native region. The first is the question of ease of communication and the second concerns the raising of beef cattle.\n\nThose to whom I address my remarks are well aware that we encounter in places such as Dax and Bayonne a great deal of rival production other than that from the Madiran. Bordelais, Saintonge, Languedoc, the province of Salies, and even the Ile de Ré have recently driven out our products. How do wines from so far off come to invade our habitual trading centres ? It is because we live in an era when transport is cheap and our agriculture is based on crude manual labor and is very costly.\n\nIf this is the case, are our problems approaching their end? Far from it. On all sides there are being prepared means of transport vastly more powerful than those which these fearsome rivals of ours have introduced. The time is coming when distances are going to disappear, when one will be able to count the advantages of proximity for nothing, when canals and railroads will be able to shift the heaviest of loads from the North to the South, and from the South to the North, from the centre to the periphery and from the periphery to the centre, with prodigious economy. Whether this is a blessing or a curse matters little. The world marches on and our complaints will not stop it. What are we going to do, however, in the face of this fearsome competition, we who are already complaining that it is killing us? How will we defend ourselves, in our isolation and with our miserable farming practices ? This is what, it seems to me, should be the focus of serious thinking, rather than the obsessively minute calculation of the harm which competition from the Madiran can do us.\n\nNow that I have shown the owners of the vineyards the future that awaits them, I must show them how that future can be changed by the Adour Canal.\n\nThe thing which caused and as it were set in stone the manual labor-based agriculture of the Chalosse, was the high cost of raising cattle, a cost which reflects the barren character of the resources available in our area for education and the raising of live-stock. It would mean giving up for all time the idea of competing with our rivals on an equal basis, if, blindly sticking to the status quo , we were to repudiate the innovations which would put within our reach that economic agriculture which they have generally adopted. Now what is more likely to favor this revolution, one that is moreover imminent, than an irrigation Canal, a canal which will turn over fifteen thousand hectares of land, in the centre of the Département, almost exclusively to the production of fodder?\n\nI am well aware, of course, that a revolution in the growing of vines is fraught with difficulties; that a whole region cannot easily change all its habits, and that our forecasts in this respect look utopian in the extreme. One cannot deny, however, that we are being drawn towards this revolution by irresistible forces, forces which it does not fall within our powers to control. We must prepare for these circumstances or be crushed by them. We must produce under the same conditions as the others or succumb under the weight of the competition. If we must of necessity move from one regime or perish, is it not wise to give a very favorable welcome to the project by which the transition will be facilitated?\n\nIt is not enough for us to produce at the same prices as our rivals; we also need the same means of having our products arrive at the centers of consumption. Doubtless these routes, these canals which are the means for the export for our wines are also a means of entry for wines from outside. To reject them for this reason would be a puerile act, comparable to that of the would-be country gentleman who keeps his house boarded up for fear that thieves might get in.\n\nThey say that the wine of Madiran will come to the Chalosse. So why should not the wine of the Chalosse go to Madiron? Madiran's wines do not all make their way down to our departement. The great majority are spread out across the Bearn, the Bigorre and the plain of Tarbes. We know that these wines are blended, something which our own are eminently capable of as well. It may well be therefore that the Canal would open up this new possibility for our vineyards.\n\nWhatever is the case, it is certain that the latter can only gain from easy access for our trade with Dax and Bayonne, from the growth in population and wealth which the canal is bound to lead to across our entire navigable area, and that, accordingly, even when the case is discussed from the narrowest point of view, it is far from justifying the fears the project has inspired. I began by saying that the Chalosse had a double interest, first in having markets for all its wines, and secondly, in the improvement in all its other areas of economic activity. Although the question of wines is the only one I have touched on, I have no space to give an account of the likely effects of the Canal on all our other productive undertakings and interests. Perhaps that will be the subject of a fifth article.\n\nFifth Article\n\nTo finish what I had to say about the Canal beside the Adour, after having explored its influence on the wine industry, I still have to consider it in terms of its connections with other industries. Such a subject, if I dealt with the details, would yield me nothing more than a series of commonplaces. Perhaps I may be permitted to cast an eye more generally, on the probable future of the Chalosse. The results will speak for themselves to the reader.\n\nThe population of the Chalosse can be divided into two classes:\n\n1.Those who live from rents;\n\n2. Those who live by working.\n\nThe first has enjoyed until the present time virtually exclusive importance. It is clear, however, that this preponderance will soon begin to wane. A constant process is reducing the size of the great landed fortunes and forcing the small proprietors down into the ranks of the working class. This is incontestable, and in witness of it, our countryside is dotted with ruined and deserted houses, attesting to the disappearance of as many once comfortable families.\n\nThe working class, by contrast, have virtually taken over our region. Already we can see this class growing everywhere. I am not very old, yet I have seen a lot of shops invade a lot of living-rooms. I have seen the increase in the numbers of lawyers, doctors, solicitors and notaries. I have witnessed the springing up of numberless artisans.\n\nThere are clearly laws in operation which reduce continuously the numbers of the idle class, and increasing those of the working class, laws which tend to modify profoundly the face of our cities.\n\nThese laws are not hard to uncover. I will cite two of the principal ones: the growth of luxury and the fragmentation of inherited wealth .\n\nThe idle class has a thousand ways to ruin itself; it has only one of enriching itself, which is by saving. The landed fortunes which spread prodigality, carelessness, and misfortune are bound to be more numerous than those which engender good order and economy.\n\nThe division of inherited wealth works even more actively in the destruction of landed riches. One holding, no matter how extensive it may be, which goes on dividing and sub-dividing from generation to generation, dissolves eventually into a multitude of fragments, quite incapable of maintaining as many families in luxury.\n\nIf these are the causes which entail the decline of the idle classes, it is clear that the decline will stop only when the causes cease to exert their influence. It is most unlikely, however, that this will happen. Far from diminishing in their force, these causes seem to draw new vigor from their own effects, such that it is correct to say that the decline of the idle classes is subject to the same accelerating force as the fall of physical bodies.\n\nIn fact, civilization, travel, and frequent communications between men, awaken in us new needs, new desires, new temptations, new habits, and new pleasures.\n\nIf our fathers had a thousand ways of ruining themselves, we have ten thousand, and our descendants will have a hundred thousand. What was a unnecessary a hundred years ago, is today a necessity and the luxuries of our time will be indispensable a hundred years from now. Perhaps it is only the privately owned (and worked) part of a limited area which will prove to be a constant; from which one has to conclude that the idle bourgeoisie is destined to vanish.\n\nBesides all this, the division of inherited wealth is far from having run its course. On the contrary it has been given a new impetus by the recent changes which have affected our laws and way of life. One knows that there is the equal division of inherited property a force which in very few generations would prevail against the strongest of aristocracies. So how long can it be thought that our small bourgeoisie could resist it?\n\nWe are thus drawn irresistibly towards work. Work is the law of mankind. It is the only refuge open to the inhabitants of the Chalosse, and we can readily see that they all have some feeling of embarrassment towards it, since they all aspire to leave to their sons a profession, instead of an inheritance of land rents.\n\nThese are, doubtless, incontestable truths. If this is so, however, by what strange reversal of ideas do we accept with such indifference and often with such disfavor these great improvements which are sure to open up an immense prospect of work for the generation to follow? What do we really want for this next generation, then? That it should be reduced to the alternative of looking for work far from the land which witnessed its birth or leading in its own country a life of idleness, and lacking in dignity? It is incontestable that the Canal beside the Adour offers powerful inducements to all forms of work. It will open to the enthusiasm of the young of today a multitude of careers in farming, manufacture, and commerce. A more lively system of production, and economic transactions multiplied many times over, can not fail to magnify the business opportunities of lawyers, solicitors, and notaries, indeed of all the professions, to increase the size of our markets, and to give much encouragement to the work of our artisans. The prosperity of each class reacts on all the others, and that is how general prosperity is fostered.\n\nEndnotes\n\nCW1, pp. 309-12.\n\nCW1, pp. 305-8.\n\nLa Chalosse: Journal de l'arrondissement de Saint-Sever (11 Dec. 1836-26 March 1876).\n\n\"Reflections on the Petitions\" (April 1834), CW2, p. 1.\n\nT.19 [1844.10.15] \"On the Influence of French and English Tariffs on the Future of the Two People\" (De l'influence des tarifs français et anglais sur l'avenir des deux peuples), JDE , T.

He began as the personal assistant to Saint-Simon (1814-1817) before joining Charles Comte and Charles Dunoyer on their journal Le Censeur européen . It was here that he learned to analyze history using the social and economic theories developed by Comte and Dunoyer via the work of Jean-Baptiste Say. Thierry became interested in the ruling elites which governed nations, how they came to power (often through conquest as the Normans did of Saxon England), and the gradual emergence of free institutions such as the medieval communes and the Third Estate.

He was the chief engineer working on the Garonne lateral canal after 1828.\n\nCount Jean Marie François Xavier de Silguy (1784-1864) was an engineer who worked for the Department of Bridges and Roads in Finistère (1810-1827), la Loire-Inférieure (1821-1830), les Landes and la Gironde (1830-1842), before becoming chief inspector (1842-1850). He worked on building canals and later on the reforestation of Les Landes.\n\nJean Maximilien Lamarque, Souvenirs, mémoires et lettres du général Maximien Lamarque, publiés par sa famille (Paris: H. Fournier jeune, 1835), vol. 2, p. 149, 180 where he talks about the military benefits of such a canal.\n\nLouis Galabert (1773-1841) was a colonel in the Army and then a Deputy who represented the Département of Gers between 1831-34 (Gers adjoined Les Landes). From the mid-1820s onwards he was best known for his advocacy of the \"Pyrénées canal\" which would connect Toulouse with the Atlantic coast via the Adour river. See, Louis Galabert, Canal des Pyrénées, joignant l'Océan à la Méditerranée, ou continuation du Canal du Midi depuis Toulouse jusqu'à Bayonne (Paris: Félix Locquin, 1831).\n\nBarnabé Brisson (1777-1828) was an engineer and the Chief Inspector of the Department of Bridges and Roads. He discussed the plans for the Bordeaux-Bayonne-Marseille canals in his book Essai sur le système général de navigation intérieure de la France (1829). See, p. 26 for a discussion of \"IXe Ligne, de Bordeaux et de Bayonne à Marseille\" and p. 126 for his estimation of the costs.\n\nBarnabé Brisson, Essai sur le système général de navigation intérieure de la France (Paris: Carilian, 1829), pp. 121-27.\n\nBastiat would substantially change his view on this topic later as he became more sceptical of the benefits of government regulation of or participation in the economy after he came across the writings of Richard Cobden and the Anti-Corn Law League in 1844.\n\nHere Bastiat is giving the reader a premonition of his future thinking on two topics which were to become his hallmark in the late 1840s, namely the idea of \"the seen\" and \"the unseen\" which he developed in the story of \"The Broken Window\" in What is Seen and What is not Seen (1850) (in CW3, pp. 405-7) and the \"ricochet effect.\" See \"The Sophism Bastiat never wrote: The Sophism of the Ricochet Effect,\" in CW3, pp. 457-61.\n\nBastiat had a considerable interest in share-cropping as he had inherited from his grandfather a large number of share-croppers with his farm in Mugron. He attempted unsuccessfully to improve their economic efficiency and output by setting up a school for their sons to train them in modern agricultural techniques (which he described in \"Proposal for the Creation of a School for Sons of Sharecroppers\" (1844) in CW1, pp. 334-40, an article \"Thoughts on Share Cropping\" in JDE (February, 1846) (in this volume below, pp. 000), and several comments in \"On the Bordeaux to Bayonne Railway Line\" (May 1846) in CW1, pp. 312-16.\n\nBastiat would reverse his opinion later in \"Thoughts on Share Cropping\" (JDE, Feb. 1846) when he came to believe that sharecropping was to be preferred over agricultural wage labour because it was a more cooperative economic endeavour, a voluntary association between \"capital\" (the private landowner) and \"labour\" (the sharecropping farmer and his family) which produced a \"fairer\" distribution of output, even though it might be less than that of the tenant farmers. See below, pp. 000.\n\nBastiat uses the phrase \"un mot eur immense et multiple\" to describe the power of the Adour river to drive the region's economic development. Bastiat returned to this metaphor of \"le moteur social\" (the social engine, or driving force) in his treatise Economic Harmonies in Chapter 22 \"The Social Motor\". Here, the driving force of economics has been internalised. It is no longer a source of physical power such as a river or a steam engine, but the mind and will of individual human beings who pursue their self-interest by avoiding pain and seeking well-being.\n\nSince Bastiat's land holdings were on this side of the river what follows is partly autobiographical.\n\nBastiat wrote an amusing economic sophism called \"The Fear of a Word\" ( LE , 20 June 1847) (ES313, CW3, pp. 318-27)) in which an economist explains to an artisan that what was holding France back was an irrational fear of the word \"free trade\" as well as the competition with England and other nations which this would produce.\n\nThe \"octroi\" or the tax on goods brought into a town or city was imposed on consumer goods such as wine, beer, food (except for flour, fruit, milk), firewood, animal fodder, and construction materials. All of these products had to pass through tollgates which had been built on the outskirts of the town or city where they could be inspected and taxed. For example, King Louis XVI had 57 \"barrières d'octroi\" (tollgates) built around the outskirts of the city of Paris for this purpose. In 1841 it was estimated that 1,420 communes throughout France imposed the octroi tax upon entry into their cities and towns, raising some fr. 75 million in revenue. The money was used to pay for the maintenance of roads, drains, lighting, and other public infrastructure..\n\nSix years later Bastiat presented a more detailed proposal to local winegrowers, \"Memoir Presented to the Société d'agriculture, commerce, arts, et sciences du département des Landes on the Wine-Growing Question), 22 January 1843, in CW2, pp. 25-42.\n\nThis distinction between living off rent from land and \"travail\" (working, or laboring on the land) is another topic on which Bastiat would later change his mind. In his long debate with Proudhon on the legitimacy of charging interest on loans and rent from land Bastiat argued that the charging of interest and rent were \"services\" which were voluntarily undertaken and productive for both parties to the exchange. See, Free Credit. A Discussion between M. Fr. Bastiat and M. Proudhon (1850) below, pp. 000.\n\nBastiat uses the phrase \"la classe laborieuse\" (the working or labouring class).\n\nIn 1837 when this was written he was 36.\n\nThis sentence suggests that Bastiat regards the services provided by \"lawyers, doctors, solicitors and notaries\" as productive activities of a \"working class\" but he does not state this definitively as he would do later.\n\nBastiat uses the phrase \"la classe oisive\" (the idle class). He used this expression on two other occasions in his work. In his \"Introduction\" to his book on Cobden and the League (1845) he refers to the \"enserfment\" of the working class by the English ruling elite, \"la class oisive\", which had its origin in the Norman Conquest and not in the spread of the free market; and in an short article \"Anglomania and Anglophobia\" (1847) (in CW1, pp. 320-34) he praises the French Revolution for having destroyed so much aristocratic landownership on the night of 4th August 1789, thus breaking the back of the French \"classe oisive.\"\n\nThe French term for this was \"morcellement\". The economists were divided over the pros and cons of large-scale versus small-scale farming. The Physiocrats and Adam Smith believed that small-scale farming was more profitable because the farmer had a very direct and close personal interest in making it so. In the 19th century Sismondi shared this view based upon his study of the Italian peasantry. On the other hand the English traveller Arthur Young thought that the poverty in rural France on the eve of the French Revolution was due to the excessive subdivision of farms which made them unprofitable to run. This view was also shared by Thomas Malthus. McCulloch believed that the greater productivity of British agriculture could be explained by its inheritance laws which encouraged the preservation of larger estates. See A. Legoyt, \"Morcellement,\" DEP, vol. 2, pp. 242-50, and E. de Parieu, \"Succession,\" DEP, vol. 2, pp. 670-78. See also Molinari's discussion of this in \"The Fourth Evening\" in Les Soirées (1849). His solution was to turn the family farm into a business run by an entrepreneur and to expand the size of farms to lower costs.\n\nFind good quote in this from EH 1/2/3 below\n\nUnder the Old Regime there existed the law of entail (\"substitution\") which was designed to preserve aristocratic land holdings by preventing them from being sold or divided. During the Revolution the Law of 1791 required the equal division of property among the children.\n\nT.286 \"Proposals for an Association of Wine Producers\" (15 Jan. 1841)↩\n\nSource\n\nT.286 (1841.01.15) \"Proposals for an Association of Wine Producers.\" Documents relating to an Association for the Defence of Wine Producers planned by Bastiat.

In Ronce, Appendix III, pp. 287-95.\n\nEditor's Introduction\n\nThis piece is interesting because of the light it shines on an early plan Bastiat drew up to organise an anti-tax, free trade movement in France some five years before he helped found the Free Trade Association in February 1846, first in Bordeaux and then a national body a few months later in Paris.\n\nBastiat first wrote on free trade in April 1834 in \"Reflections on the Petitions from Bordeaux, Le Havre, and Lyons Relating to the Customs Service\" in which he called himself \"a simple farmer\" which belied his already deep reading in economic literature and his growing interest in the economic affairs of his Département of Les Landes. The new July Monarchy (which came to power in August 1830) launched an initiative to review French tariff and tax policies after the increases enacted in the 1820s during the Bourbon Restoration. Given the unpopularity of the taxes on alcohol these were reduced somewhat but there was less success with tariff policy.\n\nIn France at this time there were a bewildering array of restrictions on goods allowed into the country. Some were prohibited outright, many raw materials were lightly taxed, while other finished goods had very high tariffs imposed upon them. In 1836 the average tariff rate imposed by the French government was about 12%. In Britain at this time it was about 15%; in the U.S. it was about 33%. To police this complex system a veritable \"army\" of public servants worked for the Customs Service. According to the Budget Papers of 1848 the French state raised fr. 202.1 million from tariffs and import duties out of total receipts of fr. 1,371 million, or 14.7%.\n\nVery few individuals or groups called for free trade across the board, but various groups, like the merchants in the port cities of Bordeaux and Le Havre and the important regional city of Lyon, called for free trade for some sectors of the French economy but not for their particular industries. Bastiat condemned them for their intellectual inconsistency and argued that:\n\nI have come not to defend the protection that they are attacking but to attack the protection that they are defending. Privilege is being claimed for a few; I come to claim freedom for all.\n\nAlthough he pointed out their errors in some detail and showed how French agriculture would benefit from a policy of free trade, he seemed to realise that his proposals were premature, since he opened the essay with the statement that \"Free trade will probably suffer the fate of all freedoms; it will be introduced into our legislation only after it has taken hold of our minds.\" And France, Bastiat understood very well, had not yet reached that stage.\n\nHis next significant essay on economic matters came three years later with an essay \"The Canal beside the Adour\" (June 1837) in which he discussed the financing of public works in his Département. However, his next foray into free trade did not occur for another two and a half years after that with a pair of articles which he wrote at the end of 1840 or in early January 1841 on \"The Tax Authorities and Wine\" and the essay republished here, \"Proposals for an Association of Wine Producers.\" These essays began a period of growing interest in tax and tariff reform in Les Landes and its impact on both French agriculture and foreign trade, especially with the Netherlands and England. Between these two essays and his breakthrough essay on \"On the Influence of French and English Tariffs on the Future of the Two People\" (written in June or July 1844 and published in the JDE in October) which brought him to the attention of the economists and free traders in Paris, Bastiat wrote the following pieces on the wine industry, taxes, and free trade:\n\n\"Memoir Presented to the Société d'agriculture, commerce, arts, et sciences du département des Landes on the Wine-Growing Question\" (Jan. 1843)\n\nthree 3 essays on \"Free Trade. State of the Question in England,\" published in the Bayonne Sentinelle des Pyrénées , May-June 1843 in which he describes the activities of the Anti-Corn Law League for the first time and wonders why the French press continues to ignore it.\n\nand 2 undated pieces from 1844 on \"Freedom of Trade\" published in an unnamed newspaper in the south of France, and\n\nanother Report \"On the Allocation of the Land Tax in the Department of Les Landes\" possibly written for the General Council of Les Landes, of which he was a member.\n\nReturning to the \"Proposals\", Ronce tells us that they were written in late 1840 after Bastiat returned from a business trip to Spain and Portugal to set up an insurance company which never eventuated. He was on his way to England (perhaps to meet Cobden and other members of the Anti-Corn Law League which had began its free trade agitation in 1838) when he was taken ill and returned to Le Havre and then to Paris. He arrived in the middle of a debate which had spring up about the Minister of Finance Georges Humann's efforts to reform the taxation system in order to meet a looming budget deficit.\n\nThis was caused by Adolphe Thiers' plans for a massive public works program to erect the so-called \"fortifications of Paris,\" or what would later be known as \"Thiers' wall or enclosure\" (l'enceinte de Thiers). The international crisis which arose in 1840 over France's support for the Pascha of Egypt and opposition by Britain, Austria, Prussia, and Russia led to growing fears in France, led by Thiers, that Britain might one day plan a new invasion and occupation of the capital as the victorious powers had done in 1815. Thiers therefore planned to build a military wall which would surround and supposedly protect Paris, along with a series of 16 massive star-shaped forts laid out in an outer perimeter beyond the wall. Thiers' critics, such as the astronomer and mathematician François Arago and the economist Michel Chevalier, objected to its construction because it was so expensive, that military technology would soon make it obsolete, and that the wall would one day be used to \"imprison\" the citizens of Paris if they ever rose up in rebellion to demand much needed political and economic reforms (which they did of course in February 1848, and were duly down by troops stationed in the forts around Paris). In other words, the wall would result in the \"embastillisation\" of Paris (the Bastillisation of Paris). To pay for the wall, budgeted at Fr. 150 million, Humann had to \"rationalise\" (i.e. increase) tax collection, which he did by undertaking a new survey of land and business ownership and more vigorously collecting the direct taxes which were levied upon them, as well as increasing indirect taxes on such things as wine and alcohol. As we know from a letter to Felix Coudroy Bastiat opposed the building of the Thiers' wall as well as the consequent new taxes Humann imposed on the wine industry which had a significant impact on Bastiat's home region which depended heavily on wine production. These measures were the immediate cause for Bastiat writing his paper on \"The Tax Authorities and Wine\" and his ambitious \"Proposals for an Association\" to organise the wine producers of his region to oppose these tax increases.\n\nBastiat was so moved to oppose these mesures that he wrote the pamphlet, drew up the statutes for a broadly based anti-tax organisation, and a prospectus for its journal to be called Le Midi (\"The South\"), and took them personally to a print shop to be printed and distributed. This would not be the last time Bastiat would do something like this. He would do the same thing three times again, once in November 1846 when he became the editor of the magazine of the French Free Trade Association, Le Libre-Échange , and twice more during the 1848 Revolution with two small publications which he and some close friends handed out on the streets of Paris, La République française (February-March, 1848) and Jacques Bonhomme (June-July, 1848). If nothing else, Bastiat was an inveterate founder of small magazines to support a cause he passionately believed in.\n\nThese plans to build a large, organised anti-tax movement in the major wine growing areas of the south (around the regional cities of Orléans, Angoulême, and Bordeaux) came to nothing since he was met with indifference by most of the landowners and wine merchants he approached. In a letter to Felix Coudroy dated 11 January, 1841 Bastiat complains that the southern Deputies he spoke to had \"interests to protect\" or were \"seeking government positions\" and did not wish to jeopardise their chances of success. Thus the detailed plans he drew up concerning the structure and operation of the Association were largely wishful thinking on his part at this stage. Bastiat would have more success in creating a free trade association with a second attempt in early 1846 after he had made contact with the political economists in Paris who were part of the Guillaumin network. The first branch of the Free Trade Association was started in Bordeaux in February 1846 and a national organisation was created in Paris in July 1846. Bastiat would lead the Free Trade Association until ill health forced him to resign in February 1848. The Association would be closed down soon after the February Revolution so the economists could focus on the more pressing problem of the rise of socialism in the new Second Republic. But here, in January 1841 we see Bastiat in the full flush of enthusiasm for the cause of free trade.\n\nIt is interesting to compare this Proposal with a very similar one he drew up in February 1846, a \"Plan for an Anti-Protectionist League,\" when the first Free Trade Association was being launched in Bordeaux. He still asserts the importance of forming committees in every town, the need to take a principled stand in favour of complete and not partial free trade, and to avoid unnecessary political partisanship in order to appeal to the widest possible audience. This \"Proposal\" and his remarks about the activities of the English Anti-Corn Law League in the introduction to his book on Cobden and the League (July 1845) reveal the strategy for radical economic and social change he was developing at this time and which he would attempt to put into practice in 1846.\n\nAlso of note is his use of sarcasm and expressions of anger in the face of these new taxes and regulations, which prefigures what was to become his hallmark \"rhetoric of liberty\" with its use of \"harsh language\" and wicked humour in the Economic Sophisms which he wrote in 1845–47 at the height of the campaign against protectionism.\n\nText 1. An Association.\n\nThere are in France 2 million hectares of land planted with vines.\n\nEach hectare produces on average 50 hectolitres of wine.\n\nTotal production is 100 million hectolitres.\n\nGranting that a reform, even a partial one, of the laws which govern the collection of indirect taxes, the system of octroi taxes (city taxes) and that of customs duties, would have the effect of increasing the value of each hectolitre by 2 francs, resulting in a increase of 200 million francs in income for the producers, which represents, at an interest rate of 4%, a capital value of 5 billion francs .\n\nIt is estimated that this reform would produce at least a similar amount in additional profits for the traders, merchants, bar owners, and consumers.\n\nThus it is thus a matter of TEN BILLION FRANCS which can be won by introducing freedom of industry and the equalisation of tax rates.\n\nThere is only one means to achieve this: ORGANIZATION.\n\nIt is necessary that all those interests march to the beat of the same drum in order to reach the same goal, and they will be able to do this only when they are organised .\n\nEvery industry provides examples of this.\n\nProducers of sugar, manufacturers of cloth, the maritime and colonial interests all have representatives .\n\nWe alone are always defeated because we do not know how to defend ourselves.\n\nIf the truth be told, it is difficult for millions of citizens who are spread across a vast territory, to organise themselves.\n\nBut nothing is impossible for an Association united in a public campaign.\n\nThis is what has lead us to found at the same time an Association for the Defence of Wine PRODUCERS and a Journal of the Association .\n\nBoth institutions are only in an imperfect embryonic form, but with time and the good will of our fellow citizens they can be developed further.\n\n2. Statutes of the Association.\n\nArticle 1. A Society has been formed, with the government's authorisation, comprising owners of vineyards, wine traders, merchants, and bar owners engaged in the wholesale or retail sale of alcoholic beverages, and all other persons who agree with these statutes.\n\nIs is not necessary for this support to be explicit; it comes from the mere fact of having paid the subscription which will be discussed below.\n\nArticle 2. The aim of the Association is to seek, by constitutional means, the progressive reform of the legislation governing indirect taxation, the system of octroi (city tolls), and customs duties, where it causes harm to the production, distribution, sale, and consumption of wine and spiritous liquor.\n\nThe Association is formally to refrain from engaging in all other activities. especially any intervention in political matters.\n\nArt. 3 To be a member of the Association one has to agree to an annual payment of 2 francs.\n\nArt. 4. The wine growing land of France is divided into 5 districts, each of which will have one representative, namely:\n\nWestern District Administrative Centre: Nantes Charente 110,000 Lower Charente 100,000 Vendée 17,000 Deux Sèvres 20,000 Lower Loire 30,000 Maine-et-Loire 38,000 Vienne 28,000 Upper Vienne 4,000 Indre 18,000 Indre-et-Loire 35,000 Cher 12,000 Loire-et-Cher 26,000 Loiret 38,000 Hectares of vines 476,000\n\nSouthwestern District Administrative Centre: Bordeaux Gironde 138,000 Dordogne 90,000 Lot-et-Garonne 70,000 Lot 58,000 Tarn-et-Garonne 36,000 Gers 88,000 Landes 20,000 Upper Pyrénées 15,000 Lower Pyrénées 24,000 Hectares of vines 539,000\n\nSoutheastern District Administrative Centre: Marseilles Bouches-du-Rhône 40,000 Var 68,000 Vaucluse 28,000 Drôme 24,000 Isère 27,000 Ardèchre 26,000 Lozère 26,000 Rhône 30,000 Loire 14,000 Upper Loire 6,000 Upper Alps 14,000 Lower Alps 6,000 Puy-de-Dôme 30,000 Hectares of vines 339,000\n\nSouthern District Administrative Centre; Montpellier Upper Garonne 48,000 Eastern Pyrénées 45,000 Ariège 12,000 Aude 51,000 Tarn 31,000 Hérault 103,000 Aveyron 34,000 Gard 71,000 Hectares of vines 395,000\n\nCentral District Administrative Centre: Dijon Côte-d'Or 26,000 Saône-et-Loire 37,000 Nièvre 9,000 Yonce 37,000 Aube 22,000 Marne 18,000 Upper Marne 13,000 Upper Saône 11,000 Doubs 8,000 Jura 21,000 Allier 17,000 Ain 17,000 Seine-et-Oise 16,000 Hectares of vines 252,000\n\nThe number of districts, and consequently the number of representatives, can be increased if the interests of the Association require it.\n\nArt. 5. There will be created:\n\nOne Committee per Department,\n\nOne Committee per district,\n\nOne Central Committee,\n\nOne General Administrative body.\n\nArt. 6. The members of the Association from the same Commune will choose from among themselves a Financial Officer.\n\nThe Assembly of Financial Officers from the Communes will meet in the main town of the Department and elect one of their members to the Subscription Committee.\n\nThis Committee will elect the representative of the Wine Growing Industry , or the member of the Central Committee.\n\nAll elections will be conducted using a plurality of votes, whatever may be the number of voters, according to the customary practices and at times announced in the Journal of the Association .\n\nIn the case where an election is not held the representative chosen at the preceding election will continue to carry out his duties.\n\nArt. 7. The function of the Representatives of the Wine Producing Industry will be to make themselves available in Paris during the sessions of the Chambers in order to support the petitions and demands of their constituents.\n\nTo seek the progressive reform of the laws which regulate the distribution and the market for wine.\n\nTo judge the order in which each reform ought to be proposed, in order to bring about the common goal determined by the entire Association.\n\nTo determine and to develop the means of levying the tax in a way which is compatible with the liberty of industry and the principle of the equality of the tax burden.\n\nArt. 8. The general Administrator is in charge of everything concerning financial accountability and publicity.\n\nArt. 9. The Representatives of the Wine producing Industry will receive a monthly payment which will be set at a later date, either by the Subscription Committees or by the Central Committee itself.\n\nThis Central Committee will also set the salary of the General Administrator.\n\nArt. 10. The Agent General will submit the financial accounts to the assembly of representatives and these accounts will be published in full in the Journal of the Association .\n\nArt. 11 ( for the time being ). For the year 1841, it being expected that it will be practically impossible to organise a delegation by the methods stipulated above, we call upon the Committees which already exist in Bordeaux, Nantes, Dijon, Montpellier, and Marseilles, so that they can immediately nominate a Representative of their District.\n\nIn those towns where no Committee exists at the moment, wine producers, traders, and other interested parties ought to get together and proceed to elect a Representative without delay. This election is quite urgent and will be confirmed at a later date by the Subscription Committee.\n\nParis, 15 January 1841.\n\nThe Provisional Administrator of the Association\n\nFrédéric Bastiat\n\nMember of the General Council of the Department of Les Landes.\n\n3. Prospectus for the Journal of the Association, Le Midi (The South),\n\nJournal of the Association for the Defence of Wine Producers.\n\nWithout doubt, one of the most valuable sources of wealth which France possesses is the cultivation of vines.\n\nThis plant extends over 50 Départements, it covers 2 million hectares of land, and employs several million people.\n\nIt is not only the people who live in the countryside who are interested in the prosperity of the wine industry, since who could say to what level of development it might take our foreign trade and our merchant marine, if there were a more normal state of trading relations with foreign countries?\n\nUnfortunately, the geniuses in the Ministry of Finance seem to have undertaken the task of snuffing out this branch of industry by restricting the market for wine, outside France with the regime of trade prohibition, and inside the country by the increase in the octroi (city tolls) and the legislation concerning indirect taxes.\n\nOne might have thought that, having reached its limits, the suffering endured by our port cities and our countryside would no longer be contested, and that the government, even if it backed away from introducing any reforms in the face of these difficulties, at least would recognise the justice of them.\n\nBut here we have it preparing for us a series of new taxes and new economic shackles.\n\nAnd according to the customary tradition in these matters, the Fisc (Fiscal authorities) throws sarcasm in our faces as it oppresses us.\n\nAs proof, isn't it a cruel irony that the Minister of Finance (Humann), after having proposed, among other measures, to treat the vineyard owner under the same law which taxes and regulates a cabaret owner, when he writes \"thus we will see disappear a privilege which nothing can justify and which violates the principle of the equality of tax burdens\"?\n\nMy goodness! Just because the law places an exceptional and onerous burden upon cabaret owners, does this exception become the rule, does a common right become then a privilege ? And to impose this exceptional burden on millions of citizens, does this make the principle of equality reign across the country?\n\nAnd this is not all. The Minister has let it be known that he will not wait long before increasing the tax on alcohol to the levels of 1829.\n\nSo then, what will ten years of struggle and complaints have produced? The re-establishment of all our old tax burdens, with new taxes piled upon old, and new shackles imposed.\n\nThis only goes to show that, for whatever reason, the government is either deaf to our complaints or scorns them.\n\nSo, what is this reason?\n\nIn our opinion, it is not necessary to look any further than the lack of continuity, cooperation, and unity in the lobbying efforts of the owners of vineyards.\n\nWhat is missing from their cause is not justice, not strength, but that which puts strength into the hands of justice, namely organisation .\n\nLacking organisation, we go from exaggerating things to being indifferent. Yesterday, we wanted to reform everything; today we abandon all hope of reform; we have instincts rather than willpower; we are not a single body, but a crowd.\n\nThis is not the path which the owners of the iron forges, those who raise cattle, or the sugar producers teach us to follow. They are not very numerous, but we are countless; their interests are hard to see compared to ours; they demand privileges while we demand a common right. However, in spite of our superiority in numbers, our interests, and justice, we fail while they triumph. Where does this difference come from? It is that they are organised and we are not.\n\nThese thoughts have made us dream of creating a huge Association for the defence of Wine Producers .\n\nBut, with that thought in mind, we thought it was necessary to prepare the way for this association with the creation of a Journal.\n\nIt is easy for a few manufacturers to get organised, but how, without having access to a means of communication, can we organise simultaneous mass protests in thousands of Communes across the country, all carried out in the same spirit and aiming at the same end? How do we create a shared vision and common method of action among all these individuals, Communes, and Départements?\n\nThus, a Journal is required in order to bring this Association about.\n\nA Journal will be just as necessary once the Association has been formed.\n\nToday it has to have an engine to drive it forward; tomorrow it will require a voice .\n\nThis then is the double task which we have imposed on ourselves:\n\nFirstly, to bring such an Association into being, and by proposing its by-laws, to inspire us with its principles in order to help it spread;\n\nThen, to serve as a way to connect the members of the Association with each other, to gather their opinions, to bring important facts and documents to their attention;\n\nAnd finally, to bring all their activities together into a unified movement .\n\nBut, and we are the first to admit it, we will fail in our efforts if we are not supported by our fellow citizens.\n\nAnd why not say it? Our task demands a moral force and even material resources which we would only be able to find in the encouragement and support of all men who have the prosperity of the south of France in their hearts.\n\nPlease allow me a final thought.\n\nThe path which we have traced out presents two pitfalls: partiality and exaggeration. It is difficult to be an impartial judge in a cause for which one is an advocate. It is no less difficult to be fair in expressing one's complaints which have often been provoked by the disdain and sarcasm of one's opponents.\n\nBut we believe we have the strength to resist this double temptation because we have always thought that prejudice and violence hinder the triumph of a cause just as much as they harm the honour of its defenders.\n\nFrédéric Bastiat.\n\nMember of the General Council of the Département of Les Landes\n\nThe price of subscribing to the Journal is fr. 6 per annum in Paris and fr. 7.50 in the Départements.\n\nThe temporary office (of the Association) is located at the printers Guiraudet et Jouaust , rue Saint-Honoré, 315.\n\nEndnotes\n\nT.5 (1834.04) \"Reflections on the Petitions from Bordeaux, Le Havre, and Lyons Relating to the Customs Service\" (Réflexions sur les pétitions de Bordeaux, Le Havre et Lyon, concernant les Douanes).

He opposed the increase in expenditure caused by Thiers' public works program to build a military wall around Paris beginning in 1841, and in order to balance the budget he attempted to impose new taxes on wine and alcohol which affected the wine growing region where Bastiat lived. These measures resulted in a number of popular revolts over the summer of 1841 in places like Toulouse and Bordeaux.\n\nAdolphe Thiers (1797-1877) was a conservative liberal lawyer, historian, politician, and journalist. During the July Monarchy he was briefly Minister for Public Works (1832-34), Minister of the Interior (1832, 1834-36), and Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs (1840). In 1840 he was instrumental in planning the construction of \"Thiers' Wall\" around Paris between 1841-44.\n\nThe walls and forts were built between 1841-44 at a cost of fr. 150 million. They were completed the year before Bastiat arrived in Paris to attend the welcome dinner organised for him by Guillaumin and the Political Economy Society. See the glossary entry on \"The Fortifications of Paris.\"\n\nFrançois Arago, Sur les Fortifications de Paris (Paris: Bachelier, 1841) and Études sur les fortifications de Paris, considérées politiquement et militairement (Paris: Pagnerre, 1845).\n\nMichel Chevalier (1806-87) was a liberal economist and alumnus of the École polytechnique and a Minister under Napoleon III. Initially a Saint-Simonian, he was appointed to the chair of political economy at the Collège de France in 1840 and became a senator in 1860. He was an admirer of Bastiat and Cobden and played a decisive role in the free trade treaty signed between France and England in 1860 (Chevalier was the signatory for France, while Cobden was the signatory for England).

Paris, 11 Jan. 1841. To Félix Coudroy\", in CW1, p. 45.\n\nLe Libre-échange (Free Trade) was the weekly journal of the Association pour la liberté des échanges (French Free rade Association). It began on 29 November 1846 and lasted until 16 April 1848, when it was closed down as a result of the February Revolution. The first sixty-four issues were edited by Bastiat, who resigned in 13 February 1848 because of his failing health, and the last eight issues were edited by Charles Coquelin.\n\nBastiat was involved in two short-lived revolutionary magazines in 1848. The first appeared two days after the revolution broke out in February and was called La République française. It appeared daily and was edited by Frédéric Bastiat, Hippolyte Castille, and Gustave de Molinari. It lasted for 30 issues between 26 February and 28 March. The second, Jacques Bonhomme , was edited by Bastiat, Molinari, Charles Coquelin, Alcide Fonteyraud, and Joseph Garnier. The journal appeared biweekly and was handed out on the streets of Paris but only lasted for four issues between 11 June and 13 July.\n\nLetter 28. Paris, 11 Jan. 1841. To Félix Coudroy, CW1, p. 44.\n\nGilbert-Urbain Guillaumin (1810-1864) was a mid-19th century French classical liberal publisher who founded a publishing dynasty which lasted from 1835 to around 1910 and became the focal point for the classical liberal movement in France. His firm became the major publishing house for liberal ideas in the mid nineteenth century. Guillaumin helped found the JDE in 1841 with Horace Say (Jean-Baptiste's son) and Joseph Garnier. The following year he helped found the PES which became the main organization which brought like-minded classical liberals together for discussion and debate.\n\nThe French Free Trade Association was modeled on the English Anti-Corn Law League which was founded in 1838 in Manchester and which was successful in having the Corn Laws repealed in January 1846. A group of French free traders founded a Free Trade Association in the port city of Bordeaux in February 1846 and then a national association in Paris in July 1846 of which Bastiat was the secretary of the Board and the editor of its weekly journal Le Libre-échange (29 November 1846 to 16 April 1848).\n\nSee T.44-46 \"Plan for an Anti-Protectionist League\" (in 3 parts), Mémorial bordelais , 8, 9, 10 February, 1846, in CW6 (forthcoming). And then the final announcement on the eve of the Association's launch on 23 February, T.48 \"The Free Trade Association in Bordeaux\", Mémorial bordelais , 18 Feb. 1846, in CW6 (forthcoming).\n\nSee the glossary on \"The Anti-Corn Law League.\"\n\nApproximately 4.9 million acres.\n\nApproximately 2,641 US gallons.\n\nIndirect taxes were levied on drink, salt, sugar, tobacco, gun powder, and other goods. According to the budget for 1848 (for which we have the most detailed figures) the government raised fr. 307.9 million in indirect taxes which represented 22.4% of its total revenue of fr. 1.37 billion. See the glossary entry on \"Indirect Taxes.\"\n\nSee the glossary entry on \"Octroi.\"\n\nBastiat would return to this problem in much more detail in a Report he gave to the General Council of Les Landes \"On the Allocation of the Land Tax in the Department of Les Landes\" (July 1844). See below, pp. 000.\n\nThis is a sly reference by Bastiat to one of the key slogans of the socialist movement which was developing in France during the 1840s. By also using the word Bastiat is showing that there is another, non-socialist, liberal meaning of the word. See the Introduction to T. 23 \"Letter to Lamartine\" below, pp. 000; and the glossary entry \"Association and Organisation.\"\n\nThe July Monarchy (1830-48) had very strict rules which limited freedom of association and speech. All public organisations and magazines had to be approved by the government, and in the case of magazines, \"caution money\" (a deposit) had to be paid as security for any possible future violation of the censorship laws.\n\nSome of the totals in the original tables are incorrect. We have corrected them.\n\nThere was very onerous legislation which regulated every aspect of the operation of Cabarets, such as rules governing regular inspections, hours of opening and closing, inspections of the quality of the drinks served, and acceptable behaviour in a public space. That wine growers would be subject to the same regulations was an affront to their dignity as Bastiat makes clear. See on the laws governing Cabarets in Formulaire municipal , Volume 2, \"Cabarets\", pp. 289-304.\n\nOne of the first acts of the new July Monarchy in August 1830 was to launch an inquiry into the alcohol tax. See, Procès-verbal des séances de la Commission instituée pour examiner les impôts sur les boissons (1830). It recommended reductions which the regime later came to regret as the budget deficit increased, hence Humann's desire to see the regime revert to the higher rates which prevailed before 1830.\n\nT.17 \"On the Allocation of the Land Tax in the Department of Les Landes\" (July 1844)↩\n\nSource\n\nT.17 (1844.07) \"On the Allocation of the Land Tax in the Department of Les Landes\" (De la répartition de la contribution foncière dans le Département des Landes). [OC1, pp. 283-333.]. Bastiat mentions this report in a letter to Félix Coudroy where he says he has not quite finished writing it. Eaux-Bonnes, 26 July 1844. To Félix Coudroy (OC1, pp. 46-49)\n\nEditor's Introduction\n\nThis detailed article is the sixth and last essay Bastiat wrote on a very specific economic topic before he made his breakthrough into the world of the Parisian political economists with his article on \"French and English Tariffs\" in October 1844. It contains the most economic data of any of the previous essays and in places is quite heavy going for the reader, but it clearly shows his gradual development as an economic analyst who was becoming increasingly at ease with figures. It also provides Bastiat with an opportunity to show off the depth of his reading in the theory of political economy, in addition to his grasp of economic data. He mentions by name a fairly formidable collection of 14 theoretical works in the final section on Malthusian population theory.\n\nBastiat draws upon a number of sources for his economic data, not all of which is available to us today, such as:\n\nNational government data, such as a 1836 report by the Director of Direct Taxation (not available to us); official publications containing statistical information, such as the Statistique de la France (1841), and national census data\n\nlocal data, such as the records held at the local Land Registry Office (Cadastre), and as a member of the General Council of Les Landes he was able to ask local mayors to provide him with the specific information he needed\n\nhis own personal experience over a period of 20 years as a landowner, farmer, wine producer, and manager of sharecroppers on his estate (from 1825 when he inherited his grandfather's estate to the time this essay was written possibly in early 1844). This is particularly useful when it comes to knowledge of the local prices of agricultural products and the changing economic conditions of ordinary farmers and workers.\n\nThe issue he takes up here is the land tax, which was the most important of the direct taxes used by the French government to raise revenue. According to Budget data from 1848-49 the government had revenue of about 1.4 billion francs, the main sources of which were (in order of importance):\n\n421 million francs from direct taxes such as the land tax, personal and property taxes, the door and window tax, and trading licences\n\n307 million francs from indirect taxes on alcohol, salt, sugar, tobacco, and gunpowder\n\n263 million francs from registrations, fees, stamp duty, etc.\n\n202 million francs from tariffs and import duties\n\nThe biggest single sources of revenue for the state were the land tax (279 million francs), registrations, fees and levies (216 million francs), the tax on tobacco (120 million francs), import duties (106 million francs), and the tax on alcohol (104 million francs).\n\nThus the issue of the land taxes was doubly important to Bastiat: it was the biggest component of the single biggest source of revenue to the state; and he himself was a land tax payer. In fact, he paid sufficient direct taxes (like the land tax) to place him the top 5% of income earners in France, thus making him a member of \"la classe électorale\" (the electoral or voting class) who where eligible to vote and stand for elections until the Revolution of February 1848 introduced the Second Republic and universal manhood suffrage.\n\nUnlike the other items subject to a direct tax, like doors and windows, and trading licenses, the land tax was not a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of a value. It was based upon the presumed income which a property owner received from the use of his property. During the first French Revolution, the law of 23 November 1790 created a tax on property which replaced several previous taxes. It was based upon the anticipated future revenue which a piece of land or a building would generate for the owner. To determine what this amount would be required a meticulously maintained registry of land (the Cadastre or Land Registry Office) and building titles in which an army of bureaucrats would register the sale of land and buildings, keep a record of the prices the land and buildings sold for, what crops or other items were grown, produced, and sold, and the income those buildings and land had generated on average over the years. Each year the central government would pass a budget which specified that a certain amount of revenue had to be collected. This amount was divided or \"apportioned\" among the various regions and Départements across France, the amounts being based upon that region's or Département's capacity to pay, which was based upon what that region or Département had been able to pay in the past. The share of revenue which had to be collected was passed down the hierarchy of the French administration from regions, départements, arrondissements (districts\"), cantons (\"municipalities\" or \"counties\"), communes (\"villages\" or \"towns\"), and then finally to individual property owners such as farmers and shopkeepers.\n\nEach arrondissement, like Bastiat's in Dax, used a complex formula or \"matrix\" to determine each district's share of the revenue which had to be collected, based upon such factors as the type of crops a particular canton grew, the average price those crops sold for over a previous period of time, the number of households or businesses which were engaged in economic activity, and so on. Because the tax assessment was not based on actual income earned it became the local bureaucrat's \"best guess\" of what a particular land or business owner might earn in his given location, based upon the kinds of crops grown in that area over the previous, say 15 years. Naturally, economic and political conditions had changed considerably in France since 1790, so the government passed a law on 31 July 1821 which created a committee in each Département whose job it would be draw up a new formula or \"matrix\" to determine what tax property owners should pay in the future. The Département in Dax passed onto the General Council of Les Landes the task of periodically advising them on how to change this formula for assessing tax, which is why Bastiat became involved as a member of that Council.\n\nBy 1844 when Bastiat wrote this essay, conditions had changed radically again and Bastiat skillfully uses the economic data he has gathered to show exactly how the land tax regime had got out of kilter with actual economic reality. He shows that the mix of economic activities in his Département had been changing and was even accelerating in the 1840s. Wine growing on the southern hills and slopes was declining, becoming less profitable, and employing fewer people; the growth of pine forests (producing wood and pine resin products) to the north was expanding, becoming more profitable, and employing more people; general farming on the alluvial soil beside the rivers (crops like wheat, rye, millet; meat from cattle, sheep, and pigs) remained stagnant; and sheep farming on the northern heathland was declining as more heath was converted to pine forests. The larger cities were growing as people left the land in order to work in commerce or light industry. Population levels in the countryside were changing as some economic regions declined economically, and so did their populations, and vice-versa. Also, the kind of labour undertaken in the countryside was changing away from sharecropping (which Bastiat favoured for a number of reasons) as it was becoming less profitable and towards more small privately owned or rented farms, which had their own problems caused by high debt levels and the decreasing size of farms caused by the inflexible inheritance laws which required an equal division of the property among the heirs. Bastiat documents these changes carefully and in great detail in over a dozen large tables of data and many more smaller ones.\n\nHis overall conclusion is that the current formula the bureaucrats used for determining the land tax was seriously out of date, inflexible and incapable of rapidly changing to new circumstances, placed too heavy a tax burden on economically declining areas like his home town of Mugron which produced wine, and under-taxed areas which were becoming more prosperous such as the pine forest industries further to the north. Bastiat not only showed up the nonsense of a bureaucratically determined assessment of a land owner's probable income but he also inserted into the essay a number of interesting insights which he would develop later in his career.\n\nMost notably, he went beyond the brief set down by the Département and the General Council to e"
