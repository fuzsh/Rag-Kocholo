        "text": "No 9 Colette lived until her death and was often seen being carried down to the Grand Vefour for dinner.\n\nNo 15 Jean Cocteau lived and was often seen in the garden with Edith.\n\nFor Napoleon fans check out the official Napoleon store at number 10\n\nRight on Rue Vivienne and a short quick left onto rue des Petits Champs is Willi’s Wine Bar, a favorite restaurant that is always fantastic and check out their large collection of posters created each year. The first-of-its-kind wine bar that served food opened in 1980 and still going strong.\n\nThe rue Vivien was named for Louis Vivien mayor of Paris in 1599 and the family that owned the portion of land to the east of the Bibliotheque Nationale. Rue Viviene was the first roman road that went through Paris to Saint-Denis and would have seen the king venturing past from the Palais du Louvre.\n\nTo the left on Rue Viviene was the home of Cardinal Mazarin and just a bit farther Jean-Baptiste Colbert also lived. The original Palais Royal was built by Cardinal Richelieu so the entire area was filled with powerful men steps away from Louis XIII and XIV in the Louvre. Mazarin built the large palace in 1635 to hold his art and books that went to Louis XIV after his death. His book collection is just over the Seine in the Institut de France. In 1721 the building was turned into the national collection of books and other treasures in the French state. The museum just reopened this last fall after more than 7 years and is fantastic to see.\n\nAt the end of the BNF building is a plaque for Edouard-Léon Scott de Martinville who died April 26, 1879 and invented the typographer and invented the first machine that could record sound 17 years before Edison. His bookshop and home were once on this corner.\n\nAt no 17 Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville was the founder of New Orleans Louisianna and died here on March 7, 1767,\n\nAt the intersection of Vivien and Rue de Quatre-Septembre is the former stock exchange, the Borse which was built in 1808 under Napoleon by Alexandre-Theodore Brongniart. Prior to this, the stock exchange moved around to multiple locations including 7 months from May 10 to December 13, 1795, in the Palais du Louvre. The stock exchange lasted from November 6, 1826, to November 6 1998, before it moved to just one European location in Belgium. Now it is a rental event space for tradeshows and weddings.\n\nJust off the side street is a rare example of Revolutionary construction. The Rue des Colonnes was built in 1792 on what was a private road. The 36 doric columns were inspired by the temple of Poseidonia in Greece. In 1826 the Rue de la Bourse cut through and one of the buildings was rebuilt in 1996 but the columns were saved.\n\nAfter the Rue de Quatre-Septembre named after the start of the third republic on September 4, 1870, take a left on the Rue de Gramont.\n\nIn 1779 Marin Kreenfelt de Storcks was working on the Almanac of Paris and was frustrated that he couldn’t give a more pinpointed idea of location. At first, he counted street lamps to note an address. When that didn’t work under the dark of night he went out and painted numbers on doors. On Rue de Gramont in the 2e he started on the left side, 1, 2, etc, and then came back around so the 1 was straight across from the last number on the street\n\nGramont changes into Rue Sainte Anne named not for the Sainte and mother of the Virgin Mary but for Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV. The best Asian restaurants in Paris are found on this street and where I stayed on my first trip in 2016.\n\nLeft on Rue de Louvois was named for Francois Michel de Tellier de Louvois minister under Louis XIV who opposed Colbert on many things including how the Affair of the Poisons was handled.\n\nOne of the loveliest small museums in Paris is the Musée de Montmartre on the Rue Cortot. The 16th-century buildings are a few of the oldest on the hill of Montmartre and were once the homes of a few of the greatest French artists. The Hotel Demarne was once the home of Claude de la Rose, a great actor in the time of Moliere. Pere Tanguy, the wonderful and kind pa\n\nint crusher lived here for a short time and supplied all the artists with their precious pigments.\n\nThe museum was inaugurated in 1960. In 2012 the Jardin Renoir was redone and inspired by the paintings he created here. La Balançoire and the Jardin de la Rue Cortot. He also painted Bal du Moulin de la Galette here\n\nThe museum is made up of a few separate buildings, In the Hotel Bel Air, holds even more fantastic French history. And sits down the hill just a bit, It was here that Renoir set up his studio. In the lovely Jardin Renoir, you will find a few recognizable views including the tree swing that he painted in 1876. Jeanne Samary, his frequent model, stands on the swing that is still in the same spot today and is marked with a plaque.\n\nIn 1932, Pinot Noir vines from Thomery, in the Seine-et-Marne were planted. In 1933 the Clos-Montmartre was created. Their office is just over the hill on Rue Lepic in the octagon-shaped building across from the Folie Sandrin\n\nLa Commanderie du Clos Montmartre was a former water tower and reservoir built in 1835 to replace a hunting lodge of Catherine de Medici. The Neoclassical structure was designed by Titeux de Frosny and once pumped up water from the Seine in Saint Ouen to serve the area. The water pump was decommissioned in 1927 and the octagonal-shaped building later became the office of the Commanderie du Clos Montmartre\n\nThe first harvest was in 1934 as well as the first celebration that is still done each year is in October. The wine is horrible\n\nRue Cortot, was named after the French Neo-Classical artist Jean-Pierre Cortot. Many of his sculptures can be found in the Musée du Louvre and the Louis XIII statue in the center of Place des Vosges as well as the Statues of Rouen and Brest in the Place de la Concorde. Vivant Denon commissioned Cortot to create a monumental statue of Napoleon for the top of the Arc de Triomphe de Carousel, Napoleon squashed the idea.\n\nJust outside the door at no 6 lived Erik Satie. The composer who wrote one of the most beautiful pieces in the world Gymnopédie no 1. Satie and Valdon were lovers from 1890 to 1898 and you can say he was obsessed with her. She decided to move on to one of his close friends Paul Mousis who she married but later left for her son's best friend. Quite the small circle there Suzanne.\n\nAt the top of the street, the Chateau d’Eau Montmartre crowns the back side of the hill inside the Square Claude Charpentier. Architect Charpentier was born in 1909 and dedicated his time to restoring and protecting historic structures in the Marais, Montmartre, and around the Sorbonne.\n\nRue des Saules, named for the fact it was once lined with willow trees.\n\nMaison Rose was once owned by Germaine Pichot and her husband Ramon. The one-time dancer was the love interest of Carlos Casagemas, a close friend of Picasso. Carlos fell in love with her but the feeling wasn’t mutual. On February 17, 1901, Carlos walked into the Hippodrome Cafe in Pigalle where he was holding a dinner party and attempted to shoot Germaine before he turned the gun on himself. This tragic event sparked Picasso’s prolific blue period where Carlos was the subject of many of the pieces.\n\nThe square was created in 1935 and renamed on February 2, 2012\n\nAt the entrance from the stairs is a monument to Théophile Steinlen. A Swiss artist born November 20, 1859. In 1881 Steinlen and his wife Emilie moved to Paris and in 1883 to Montmartre where they remained for the rest of their life. Steinlen knew Toulouse-Lautrec and hung out at Le Chat Noir and created the now very famous image used on everything from towels to magnets.\n\nPaul Vannier created the monument in 1935. The stone statue is of Théophile and Emilie and was placed here as they often sat here every evening. The bronze bas relief plates were melted down by the Vichy government in 1942 and later replaced in 1962.\n\nJust past the Square Joel le Tac is the Place Claude-Nougaro named on the 15th anniversary of his death on November 28, 2019. Born in 1929 in Toulouse to an Opera singer father and a piano teacher mother. He first appeared on the stage of the Lapin Agile in 1954 and went on to become a beloved French singer.\n\nTowards the end is a statue of artist Eugène Carrière who lived from 1849-1906. Friends with Rodin he started the Carrière Academie on the Rue de Rennes and counted Matisse as a student. The statue was created in 1932 by Henri Sauvage. The bas-relief plates represent the works of Carrière as well as a poem on the origins of emotions.\n\nThe plates were also melted down in 1942 and replaced in 1949 by Jean René.\n\nAhead on the corner of Rue Caulaincourt and Avenue Junot is an Histoire de Paris sign marking Le Maquis. Until the end of the 19th century, this area was known as Le Maquis and covered in small alleys, houses, and gardens. The artists loved the area and many including van Gogh, Modigliani, and Steinlen lived in the neighborhood. Much of it disappeared gradually at the beginning of the 20th century as Avenue Junot was enlarged.\n\nAt Number 73 Renoir lived from 1902-1903, Theophile Steinlen also lived here until his death. Steinlen also lived at number 58 before moving to 73.\n\nA trip to Paris can be expensive but once you arrive there are a few little tricks and ways you can save a few euros.\n\nThere are countless FREE things that you can do in Paris, especially for art lovers. One of my favorites finds down many of the cobblestone-lined streets are the many churches that are filled with some of the biggest names in French art history.\n\nEglise Saint Sulpice is an easy choice as it also holds three of the masterpieces of Eugene Delacroix. Delacroix believed that to be remembered long after an artist had passed they should be hanging in public buildings and churches. Saint Sulpice was one of his last commissions but not the first found in a church.\n\nEglise Saint Sulpice, 2 rue Palatine 6e open 8 am - 8 pm\n\nEglise Saint Denys du Saint Sacrement is the first chuch that displayed a Delacroix. The Piata in the first chapel on the right is not the normal version of a Piata displayed in most churches.\n\nEglise Saint Denys du Saint Sacrement, 68 ter rue de Turenne 3e 7:30 am - 7:30 pm\n\nThe facade of the Eglise Saint Paul Saint Louis is a work of art on its own. The beautifu red door shines against the tall Baroque church that crowns the Rue Saint Antoine. Inside the side chapels are lit with gorgeous chandeliers and large vases of fresh flowers always sit on the altar. As you enter head to the left side of the church and at the transept look up to see Delacroix’s Christ in the Garden of Olives.\n\nEglise Saint Paul Saint Louis 99 rue Antoine 3e 8 am - 8 pm\n\nOther churches not to miss are the Eglise Saint Nicolas de Chardonnet is the final resting place of the artist to the king, Charles Le Brun is laid to rest but also where one of his fantastic paintings is just inside the door. The Martyrdom of Saint John the Evangelist at the Latin Gate as well as a painting by Jean Baptiste Corot. Louis XIV trusted Le Brun to decorate Versailles, the Palais du Louvre, and countless palaces across France.\n\nEglise Saint Nicolas de Chardonnet 23 Rue des Bernardins 5e 7 am - 8 pm\n\nNot far from the Musée du Louvre and the golden monument to Jeanne d’Arc is the Eglise Saint Roch. Sitting on the Rue Saint Honoré and where a church dedicated to the patron saint of pastries, Saint Honoré once stood. The facade has a reminder of the young Napoleon that tried to stop the insurrection and fired on the church. There are still reminders on the left side of the facade.\n\nInside the church where the other designer of the king, André Le Notre who designed the gardens of Versailles and the Tuileries is buried here and the funeral for Yves Saint Laurent was here. Inside the Baptismal chapel is a painting by Delacroix devotee Theodore Chassériau Saint Philip baptizing the eunuch of the Queen of Ethiopia.\n\nEglise Saint Roch 296 Rue Saint Honoré 1e 8:30 am - 7 pm\n\nParis is a city of museums and there are well over 175 museums dedicated to just about anything you would want to see. On the first Sunday of each month, many of the museums are free. It is a great option if you are in Paris but for a few, you may need to plan ahead. The Musée d’Orsay recently announced that you must have a free timed ticket for the day to help avoid the crush of people that have been attending. The Louvre does not take part and eventually will return to its free Saturday evenings at some point down the road.\n\nIf you are a museum-goer like myself that loves to look at and read everything this may not be the day for you as the museums are normally very busy and it’s hard to really get close to many of the paintings.\n\nHowever, there are ten museums belonging to the city of Paris that are free every day. Under the umbrella of the Paris Musées is the lovely Petit Palais which holds the art owned by the city of Paris and covers every scope of time. The history of Paris in the Carnavalet should always be on the top of your list to see.\n\nAuthors and artists include Victor Hugo, Balzac, Zadkine, and Bourdelle. The collections of the Cognac-Jay and Cernuschi and the Musée d’Art Moderne all fall under their umbrella.\n\nOf the twelve museums in the city, two have a fee. The Catacombs and the Crypte under Notre Dame need a ticket and the Palais Galliera which is the fashion museum of Paris is only open for special exhibits so in a bit of a bait and switch you must pay to enter, but highly worth it.\n\nOnce you have your tickets for museums a trick I love to use is to screenshot them on my phone and create a folder in my photos so that I don’t need to scroll through thousands of pictures to find them while standing in line.\n\nNow with all the money that you saved let’s head to lunch where you can enjoy some of the best restaurants in Paris with a little less sticker shock than dinner. Many restaurants offer a prix fixe 2 or 3-course lunch Monday to Friday and that can be under 35€ and a great value.\n\nA few favorites are Le Fumoir next to the Eglise Saint Germain l’Auxerrois and Willi’s Wine Bar above Palais Royal. Check out more of my favorite restaurants here,\n\nAt the start of September 1913, Princess Sophie of Saxe-Weimar paid a visit to Paris with her mother to see Bleichroder. On September 13 on a drive through Fontainebleau, their car hit a child and injured them. The princess and her mother fled back to Warsaw and as the heat increased Bleichroder said the young princess had been driving the car. Distraught at the attention on September 17, 1913, back in her bedroom of the palace in Warsaw she shot herself and died.\n\nThe next-door neighbor at number 13, was once the home of Martine Marie Pol de Béhagne, countess of Bérn. Martine was the daughter of Octave de Béhague who was a very wealthy art collector. In 1890 she married Rene Marie Hector de Béarn and by 1920 the two ended in a divorce. After her parents died she used her vast inheritance to purchase this home as well as renovate her parents' palace on rue Saint Dominique in 1888.\n\nJust at the corner and what is now connected to no 11 & 13 is the Dior flagship store at 30 avenue Montaigne. As soon as Christian Dior saw the building he knew it had to be his. On December 16, 1946, his dream came true. The building has another interesting history and a tie to Napoleon. In 1865 Alexandre Walewski, the first child and illegitimate son of Napoleon Bonaparte had it built but died before it was finished. His wife moved until it was sold and became known as the Hotel de Millon d’Aily de Verneuil.\n\nFurther down the street at no 24, Alfred and Lucie Dreyfus lived just after they were married on April 18, 1890. However, most of the street was dominated by the wealthy bankers of the 19th century that led way to the tv and radio offices and then haute couture houses.\n\nNo 44 was also built by Walewski and where they lived before the Dior building was finished. Today it has been the office for Balmain since 1952.\n\nTaking a left onto the rue Pierre Charron and then to Avenue George V. Of course the name of the street makes you think of the Four Seasons George V with its amazing flower displays by Jeff Leatham.\n\nGeorge V is somewhat new to the landscape in Paris, but then again anything that is mid-19th century to me is new in the grand scheme of Parisian history. In 1928 André Terrail of La Tour d’Argent and Georges Wybo took on the design of a new luxurious hotel funded by American Joel Hillman. On October 24, 1929, Black Thursday, when he lost all his money he was forced to sell his hotel. Francois Dupré was next up as owner in 1931 and added on an additional wing that was used as apartments with a one-year lease with all the luxury of a hotel. A few other owners passed through until 1997 when the current owner took the reigns. Prince Alwaleed of Saudi Arabia managed on his own until he asked the Four Seasons to step in and take over. Today the 244 hotel rooms start at 1900€ a night.\n\nThe avenue gets its name from the English king, George V who ruled from 1865-1936. Just down the way at no 23 is the Amerian Episcopal church, Holy Trinity. The Greek Revival eglise was designed by British architect George Edmund Street and constructed in 1881. The spire was added on in 1904 and designed by the original architect’s son, Arthur Edmond Street. One of my favorite depictions of the church is the painting by Jean Béraud in the Musée d’Orsay, of all the fancy people leaving the church after a Sunday service.\n\nAt number 15, the Hotel Wagram was built in 1869 and was once home to Berthe de Rothschild after her marriage to Alexandre Berthier the 3rd prince of Wagram. Her son amassed an amazing collection of art including Monet, Renoir, and van Gogh before it would become the Spanish Embassy in 1920.\n\nFor those of you wanting a late night out in Paris on the sexier side add the Crazy Horse to your itinerary. Opened May 19, 1951, the mix of an American striptease club and exotic dance came along long after the Moulin Rouge and the other pioneers shocked Paris. In 1954 Miss Candida started her popular routine of taking a bath on stage which she would do more than 500 times. Dita von Teese and even Pamela Anderson have also graced the stage amid the all-nude review.\n\nAt the end of the street, we find the busy intersection of Alma-Monceau. The Eiffel Tower is in sight and the flame of the Statue of Liberty is just below.\n\nNear the start of Avenue Monceau is the Musée Yves Saint Laurent, a small museum you don’t want to miss. Yves Saint Laurent worked at Dior from 1955 and took over as a designer after the death of Christian Dior in 1957. Leaving the house he started his own and exhibited his first collection on January 29, 1962. The 60th anniversary has been marked with small exhibits in six of the museums of Paris including the Louvre which is still on display until September.\n\nIn 1974, YSL moved his office to this location and worked here until he announced his retirement on January 7, 2002. The same year YSL and his partner created the Pierre Bergé and Yves Saint Laurent Foundation. On June 1, 2008, Yves Saint Laurent took his last breath losing his battle with brain cancer. Pierre died nine years later on September 8, 2017. The museum was opened and inaugurated the same month. Inside it is rather small but with two very well done special exhibits a year as well as a glimpse inside the former office of the fashion genius just as he left it.\n\nOpen Tuesday - Sunday 11 am - 6 pm and until 9 pm on Thursdays.\n\nLeft on rue Léonce Reynard to Rue de Galliera and the Palais Galliera. Marie Brignole Sale de Ferrari de Galliera was born in Italy in 1811, Her father fell in love with Paris and served as an ambassador and also a minister of state under Napoleon. Marie was married off to Raffaele de Ferrari in 1828 but her affection for Paris couldn’t keep her in Italy long. She left her husband behind and headed back to Paris. In 1878 Marie offered the city of Paris a plot of land and an offer to build a palace to hold her art collection. Deals were signed and architect Léon Ginain designed a small palace but things turned sideways when Clemenceau backed a new law targeting immigrant descendants that stayed in France. She tried to pull out of the deal but it was too late. She returned to Genoa with her art collection that was no longer intended as a gift to France. In 1888 she died, never to see her finished palace.\n\nIn 1895 it opened as a temporary exhibit space and in 1902 a contemporary industrial art museum. In 1920 it opened as the first fashion museum in Paris and the current incarnation opened in 1977. The inner frame structure was designed by the Eiffel Tower company and today you can look up and admire it as you stroll the special exhibits.\n\nOpen Tuesday to Sunday 10 am to 6 pm, Thursday until 9 pm.\n\nIn 2010 the most notable event struck the museum in the dark of night between May 19 & 20. For weeks the alarms were damaged and awaiting repair in parts of the museum and Vjeran Tomic working on behalf of art dealer Jean-Michel Corvey found out. In the middle of the night Spider-Man as Tomic was known, crawled through the window and stole five paintings. All but one were in the same room and chosen just because he liked them.\n\nPicasso’s Dove with Green Peas was painted in 1912, Henri Matisse’s Pastoral in 1905, George Braque’s Olive Tree near Estaque in 1906, and Léger’s 1922 Still Life with Candlesticks. Modigliani's 1919 Woman with a Fan was in the next room. Guards were on duty but Tomic was able to get in and out pretty quickly and it wasn’t until the next morning that the paintings were discovered missing. Valued at over 1 million euros they were taken to copiest Yonathan Birn. When he heard the news of the arrest of his accomplices he tossed the five paintings in the trash. To this day they have never been recovered.\n\nThe museum is free except for special exhibits and is open Tuesday to Sunday from 10 am to 6 pm and until 9:30 pm on Thursday.\n\nOutside along Avenue President Wilson, you can find one of the best outdoor markets in Paris on Wednesday and Saturday opening at 7 am and running until 1 pm on Wednesday and 3 pm Saturday.\n\nA few steps away on the Avenue d'Lena at number 11 was the home of Charles Ephrussi. Ephrussi was born in Odessa in 1849 and came from a very wealthy banking family. Charles was an art historian and critic and owned the Gazette des Beaux-Arts.\n\nCharles was the uncle of Irene Cahen, wife of Moise de Camondo. It was a rocky marriage and she left him for another man after they had two children, Nissim and Béatrice. As a child, Irene was painted by Renoir and the painting was given to her daughter Béatrice. During both world wars, the Camando family was struck with one tragedy after another. At the end of the war, Béatrice and her family were killed by the Nazi and the painting fell into their hands.\n\nOne day Irene came across it in a museum and did all she could to get the painting back even saying it was the only reminder she had of her beloved daughter. Irene was a horrible mother and woman and after years in court, ownership of the painting was returned to her. She quickly turned around and sold it to controversial art collector Emil Buhrle. To know more about this story read the amazing book The House of Fragile Things by James McAuley.\n\nWe end this week's walk at the Square of Thomas Jefferson where we are greeted by the monument to the American Volunteers by Jean Boucher in 1923. At the far end, you will also find the bronze monument to George Washington and Lafayette by Auguste Bartholdi in 1895. In the center is a bust of Horace Wells the American who invented Nitrous Oxide and also Myron T Herrick who was the US Ambassador from 1912-1914.\n\nThe benches and street lamps were once a part of Battery Park in NY and trees from Ellis Island. If you need a little visit to America just visit the square of Thomas Jefferson.\n\nToday we take you to a few of the streets that are just off the Parc Monceau. I first discovered the Rue Fortuny five years ago just by chance. I love to just wander down streets taking time to see what I can find and this street had me saying “oh my” over and over again. f\n\nThe streets of Paris are covered with plaques and other little markers that give you a hint to its past and just enough of a clue to send me down a rabbit hole of discovery. The Rue Fortuny is just such a street. Let’s take a little walk.\n\nNamed after Mariano Fortuny i Marsal who was a Spanish painter and lived near here for two years in 1868. The area surrounding the lovely Parc Monceau began to be laid out in 1848 and became a popular place with the elite looking to build new homes. The streets we walk on today were once the property of artist Louis Godefroy Jadin who once lived here and painted many of the walls and ceilings of the Palais des Tuileries. In 1861 the Pereire brothers then owned the land and started to build grand mansions for everyone from the Rothschilds to the Camados.\n\nRue Fortuny\n\nNo 2 was once the home of Edmond Rostand who wrote Cyrano de Bergerac and lived here from 1891 - 1897. He died in 1918 of the Spanish Flu but his works live on and are adapted every year. Composer and organist August Chapuis who counted the Eglise Notre Dame des Champs and Saint Roch as his ateliers lived and died here on December 6, 1933.\n\nNo 8 built in 1882 by architect Alfred Boland in Troubadour - Gothic style for Emilie Streich. Notice the amazing sculptures in the niches of the facade.\n\nNo 15, another by Fouquiau who is well known for his brick facade buildings, In the Belleville neighborhood you can find countless identical houses he designed.\n\nNo 17, architect Charles-Edouard Weyland designed this home for Louis Herbette who served as the Prefect of the Loire-Atlantique from 1879-1882. The Renaissance- Louis XV-style building was also the location where the Black September group bombed the Jewish Agency that was located here on January 9, 1973, in protest of Golda Meir in Paris.\n\nNo 19 Jean Brisson designed the building and brothers Joseph and Jules Chéret created the amazing carvings and ironwork. French politician Arsène Picard served in Parliament for just one year.\n\nNo 27 with its defining stripe facade was built in 1878. The Hotel Englebert by Adolphe Viel was built for Spanish actress and courtesan Carolina “La Belle” Otero. Otero arrived in Paris in 1889 during the Universal Exhibition and quickly met Joseph Olier, owner of the Moulin Rouge, and began to perform on stage. Her performances took her to the Folies Bergère and onto the US, Russia, and Europe. With the stage often comes the life of a courtesan and she was one of the most popular of the Belle Epoque. As the biggest rival of Liane de Pougy (listen to the story of her life in the podcast episode we did last year). Known as the Sirène de suicide since many men killed themselves or died in duels because they couldn’t be with her.\n\nNext door at no 29 was also built by Adolphe Viel for Genevieve Lantelme who was also an actress and courtesan. At 14 years old her mother sent her off to work at a brothel in Paris where she met important men like Henry Poidatz who owned Le Matin. Poidatz introduced her to Alphonse Franck who owned the Theatre du Gymnase and gave her the introduction to the stage. At the Paris Conservatory, she studied acting which gave her more opportunities in Paris. Her unique style captured the attention of everyone and her image graced the covers of the papers and magazines of the time, especially in her large hats.\n\nAcross the street at no 42, Alfred Boland built for glassmaker Joseph-Albert Ponsin who also designed the glass ceiling for Sarah Bernhardt. Notice the lovely caryatids up above.\n\nAround the corner on the Avenue de Villiers is a lovely little museum. The Musée Jean-Jaques Henner is housed in the former home and studio of artist Guillaume Dubufe. In 1921 the niece of Henner purchased the home with the intent of making it a museum, sixteen years after his death. Henner is known for his paintings of women with red hair with an ethereal look to them. It is rarely busy and you can explore one floor after another in the world of Henner. Open Wednesday - Monday 11 am - 6 pm, 6€\n\nAt no 42-44 is a set of buildings that will surely catch your eye. Built-in 1800 by Lucien Magne who had once studied under Viollet le Duc, The Gothic Revival structures are joined with an arched portico. Behind the arch and the buildings is the start of a building site that has become quite the lightning rod for the area.\n\nJust a few steps away is the green space of the Place du Général Catroux with a few statues you may not want to miss including the Dumas family.\n\nAlexandre Dumas by Gustave Doré inaugurated November 4, 1883. His most famous character, D’Artagnan sits on the rear of the base, and in the front three ladies read one of his well-known pieces.\n\nPaul Bigot used a combination of Internationalism and Art Deco style in concrete and red brick from Vitry-sur-Seine. Look closely at the frieze that runs around the building, The terracotta designs include some of the famous pieces that are studied there. The gargoyles of Metapontum, Ludovisi’s throne and Cantoria of Luca della Robbia. They were created by the famous house of Sèvres. The doors incorporate Roman lattice and medieval quatrefoil.\n\nRue Michelet, named for historian Jules Michelet.\n\nNo 4 Genevieve de Gaulle-Anthonioz lived. She was the niece of Charles de Gaulle and a resistance fighter and leader. Arrested on the Rue Bonaparte in 1943 she was deported to Ravensbrucj on February 3, 1944. Because of her uncle she was used as a bargaining chip and was somewhat protected. She survived and was liberated on April 25, 1945.\n\nMarried Bernard Anthonioz who was working for the newly formed Ministry of Culture but still worked tirelessly for the survivors and those that parished under the Nazi’s and later those that suffured through poverty. On February 15, 2002 she died here in her apartment and on February 21, 2015 Francois Hollande announced they were moving her remains to the Pantheon. Her family refused to allow her body be moved from it’s grave in the Bossey cemetery and on May 27, 2015 dirt from her grave was symbolically interred in the Pantheon.\n\nRue d’Assas named for the Captain under Louis XV, Louis d’Assas\n\nNo 100 the Musée Zadkine created in the former home and atelier of Russian artist Ossip Zadkine. Arriving in Paris in 1910 he and his wife moved to this location in 1928. The first cubist sculpturist served in the Foreign Legion during WWI but was later dismissed when he was charged with using potatoes as projectiles when intended for food. After his death in 1967 the home was given to the city of Paris by his wife in 1978 and opened in 1982. His pieces can be found around Paris in the Jardin du Luxembourg and Place Saint Germain des Prés.\n\nRue Guynemer runs along the western edge of the park and is a mix of 19th century and more contemporary buildings but at the start of the street have two you want to take a look at. At no 2 the 1914 building designed by Louis Périn is gorgeous even if the Germans took over many of the apartments during the Occupation.\n\nAt no 4 next to it was built in 1893 by Germain Cahn-Bousson and is now owned by the Vatican and Francois Mitterand once lived there.\n\nHowever it is the one on the opposite corner at no 58 Rue de Vaugirard that I love. The door is a stunner and above it has a balcony with a statue of zeus that at times moves from one corner to the other, F. Scott & Zelda Fitzgerald once lived here and just a few blocks from Hemingway where he gave strict orders not to tell anyone where he lived. Hem and Zelda had a strong dislike for each other and he thought they were drunk too much.\n\nThank you all for tuning in to chat about some of the best tips and tricks on getting to Paris and what to do in the City of Light.\n\nThe first step is getting there and my favorite way to search for flights is Skyscanner. They have an app or a website and you can select and watch flights and they will send updates when the prices go up or even better down. When it comes to purchasing the flight it’s best to stay with the major airlines and not buy the flights through the 3rd party clearing houses. If something happens and you need to cancel, you are less protected by those sites that buy in bulk from the major carriers.\n\nWhere to sit in the plane is always a personal choice. Are you an aisle or a window? Are you back in economy because you can care less how you get there or is it first class or nothing. Today prices are extremely high. The carriers are trying to recoup those losses and you pay the price unfortunately. Some chose their flights based on fares and others stick with a certain carrier. The section you choose is another personal choice.\n\nHave you taken a walk around the Place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement? Well let me take you on a little walk to show you exactly why you should spend a bit more time there.\n\nLet’s start just behind the entrance to the Catacombs at the Square de l’Abbe-Migne. Created in 1880 it sits on the former Barrier d’Enfer, the Hell Gate of the Farmers general wall built in 1787. The square is named for Jacques-Paul Migne who was a Catholic priest and journalist who also published Catholic writings. Inside the square is a monument dedicated to Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet who was a 19th century artist and engraver who studied under Antoine-Jean Gros and was close friends with Théodore Géricault. The two traveled to England when the Raft of the Medusa was put on display after the Salon of Paris. You can find his painting of Napoleon at Waterloo in the Musée des Arts Decoratifs and The Conventional Merlin de Thionville in the Sully wing room 950 of the Musée du Louvre. The brass medallion on the monument was created by Charpentier in 1896.\n\nThe Berrier d’Enfer of the 1787 wall was used to collect taxes as goods came into Paris. It got its name from the former Boulevard d’Enfer which was part of what is the Boulevard Raspail today. Enfer or hell may come from the fact that it was once a site of debauchery. On either side of the Avenue du Général Leclerc Neo-Classical buildings by Claude-Nicolas Ledoux were built in 1787. Jean-Guillaume Moitte created the bas-reliefs on the facade. He had studied under Pigalle and also created sculptures for the Cour Carrée of the Louvre. Carnavalet, Pantheon, Fontainebleau and Versailles.\n\nThe buildings now hold two of the museums of the City of Paris. The Catacombs and the Musée de la Liberation.\n\nThe Catacombs, the final resting place of millions of former Parisians are one of the most popular stops on the list of many tourists. The Saint Innocents cemetery on the right bank dates back to the 6th century and in the 11th the Église Sainte Opportune was built on the same spot. All of the local parishes of Paris used the cemetery and became even more popular when the nearby Les Halles was installed. Much of it was used as a mass grave and as the 100,000 bodies arrived and decomposed it seeped into the water and ground causing caves to collapse and the residents in the area to get very sick.\n\nIn 1780 it was so bad that the wall of a home caved in and bodies rolled into the basement. The cemetery was closed and on November 9, 1785 the Conseil d’Etat voted to have it emptied. Where to put the 2 million permanent residents? The former quarries used to build Paris were used in the Montsouris area that we are at today. The same year they began the work of removing the skeletons, cleaning and then transporting them in a funeral cortege and then dumped into a hole where men waited to stack them.\n\nOther cemeteries followed, seventeen in total, 145 monasteries, convents and 166 churches and chapels. Under Houssmann in the mid 19th century more bones were discovered and added. In total today there are more than 6 million people stacked up down there. It was never meant to serve as a tourist attraction, and is pretty morbid to even think about. In 1810 it was open to the public only a few days a year. Today it is a daily sold out excursion. The last bodies were added in 1933 to the 2 kilometer in length underground tunnel. Open Tuesday - Sunday 10am to 5pm and advance tickets are highly recommended.\n\nAcross the street is the wonderfully done Musée de la Liberation de Paris, Musée du Général Leclerc, Musée Jean-Moulin. It was opened on the 75th anniversary of the Liberation of Paris on August 25, 2019. The museum itself is much older and was once located near the Gare Montparnasse where it was mostly hidden and void of many visitors. The location also served as the headquarters of Colonel Rol-Tangy where orders during the Liberation were given and where his wife Cécile also assisted. She was an amazing woman and one of the ladies we covered in a pass Paris History Avec a Hemingway episode of the Women of the Resistance. Give it a listen here. The museum is open Tuesday - Sunday 10am-6pm and is free.\n\nThe Place Denfert-Rochereau is named for Aristide Denfert-Rochereau who lived from 1823-1878. He was an engineer that went on the be a colonel and also politician. In October of 1870 he was named the Lieutenant-Colonel where he fought to defend the city of Belfort against the Prussians. In the city of Belfort today there is a large carved lion that pays tribute to him and the many that fought to defend the city.\n\nThe Boulevard Arago is just one of the eight streets that feeds into the place. It is named after François Arago who was born on February 26, 1786 in Roussillon. In 1805 he joined the Paris Observatory and at just 23 he was elected into the Academy of Science and became a professor. He would also become the Minister of War and the Head of State, or the Prime Minister as it is known today. However his name may sound more familiar from the brass markers that run through the city or the Da Vinci Code. More on that in a minute.\n\nIn 1634 Cardinal Richeleieu and Louis XIII ordered the main meridian through Europe created to be used for maps. Under Arago in the early 19th century he recalculated the location running from the Shetland islands to the Balearic islands. In 1884 the United States spearheaded adopting the current Greenwich Meridian which is 17 degrees from the original Ferro meridian adjusted by Arago. The Ferro once ran through Paris and is still marked today, but the Greenwich runs farther out, crossing through Le Havre and Bordeaux.\n\nIN 1994, Dutch artist Jan Dibbets decided there needed to be a memorial dedicated to Arago and with the Arago society a monument that would run almost 6 miles was created. The 135 brass medallions inscribed with Arago and a N and S for Nord et Sud, North and South were added to the streets, gardens and inside my favorite building in Paris. They start at the Cité Universite in the 14th, not far from here and run through the city to the avenue de la Porte de Montmartre in the 18th. Today there are around 121 left as some have been removed or stolen but always fun to find.\n\nFollow each and every one of the medallions from this great website.\n\nYou can find five of them in the small Place de l’ile de Sein where there is also a pedestal that once held a bronze statue of Arago himself. Alexandre Oliva created the statue in 1893 but it was melted down by the Germans in WWII. The place is dedicated to every one of the 133 men that lived on the small Brittany island that stood up with Charles de Gaulle to fight for France.\n\nThe street that runs next to it, the small Allee Nina Simone was dedicated in 2013 to the American singer that made France her home and where she died in 2003.\n\nJust a block away is the Santé prison that was built in 1861 on the ground that was once the Sainte Anne Hospital built by Anne d’Autriche in 1651. The 1,000 cell prison is used as a transfer location and has housed everyone from Guillaume Apollinare to Manuel Noriega.\n\nThe one thing that towers over the area is the Paris Observatory that dates back to 1667. The year before Louis XIV and Colbert created the Academy of Science. Claude Perrault was tapped to create a building that would be built on the meridian line. Perrault is also known for the lovely Perrault Colonnade of the Palais du Louvre and his brother Charles wrote Cinderella. Pretty cool family.\n\nThe Cassini family, starting with Giovanni Domenico Cassini, served as the directors of the Observatory for 125 years. The family also lived here all the way down to his great grandson Jean Dominique Cassini. Inside you can still follow the meridian line as well as find the dome and telescope dedicated to Arago. In the small Jardin de l’Observatoire we can find a statue of Arago that was added in 2017 and created by Wilm Delroye.\n\nOn the Rue Cassini, clearly named for the family that runs on the front northern side of the Observatory you can find a few stunning examples of later French architecture. On the corner of Rue de Faubourg Saint Jacques and Rue Cassini is the Hotel de Massa that once stood on the Champs Elysees. In 1927, Theophile Bader, president of the Galerie Lafayette wanted to purchase a property to build a store on the famed avenue. He didn’t want the building that was there and offered it back to the French State who sold it to the Société des Gens de Lettres for 1 franc and gave them a spot of land in the 14th. In 1929, it was taken apart, stone by stone and board by board and moved to this spot. As for the Galerie Lafayette, it finally opened on the Champs Elysees in 2019. 90 years later.\n\nGuy de la Brosse compiled thousands of plants for the garden from around the world. Like Napoleon would later do for Josephine’s Malmaison, Louis XIII had his officers gather specimens wherever they went. After the death of Louis XIII the garden was ignored for a time especially as Louis XIV left Paris for Versailles. Jean-Baptiste Colbert and added the garden under his umbrella of royal buildings and injected a bit of love into the struggling landscape.\n\nThe nephew of Brosse was sent to the south of France and the Alps to retrieve new samples to replace the many that had withered away. Georges-Louis Leclerc, count of Cuffon was placed in charge and enlarged the gardens to what we see today. A statue of Buffon created by Jean Carfus in 1909 can be seen close to the beautiful museum as you walk in.\n\nJust to the left of the main entrance is the monument to Emmanuel Frémiet by Henri-Leon Gréber. Frémiet, a lover of animals and master of many fantastic statues including the equestrian Jeanne d’Arc in Paris is seen here working on his Denicheur d’Oursons, the Bear Hunter. At the base you see the lovely Jeanne d’Arc. Frémiet was also the professor of animal drawings at the Natural History Museum. Just behind Frémiet is the Galerie de Paléontologie et d’Anatomie Comparée which was once a carriage company. Inside are some stunning and massive skeletons of whales and dinosaurs. The view from above looking down at the skeletons is worth the price of admission.\n\nThe gorgeous building at the end of the center garden is the Grande Galerie de l’Evolution designed by Jules André in 1877 and completed in 1889. The medallions on the facade are the former directors of those that helped establish the gardens and museums. A great museum for families, all of them found in the garden are but this is also one to see for us big kids as well. The lower level is like walking through a safari with giraffes, elephants and tigers and all the sounds, it’s so fun to walk through.\n\nThe inside of this museum is also amazing and a somewhat hidden staircase is worth a peek if you can find it. In the northwest corner behind the large whale is a door, rather a nondescript door, push it and go inside. You will be the only one inside. Follow up the stairs taking your time to check out the statues, busts and lovely ironwork to the top. Once there you will get a wonderful view of the garden, but this isn’t the best part yet. Walk up to the right a little farther and you will see a Harry Potter-like double staircase. At the top peer into what was once the king's personal cabinet of amazing gems and natural treasures.\n\nThe upper levels of the museum have endless cabinets of butterflies and insects and a fantastic view of the architecture of the structure itself and the animals below. I love this museum and it's one of those that few tourists visit. There is also a museum dedicated to gems as well that is worth a visit.\n\nBack out in the garden are two pavilions. On the left is the Serre de Nouvelle-Calédonie, built in 1836 and holds the history of plants. On the right the Grandes Serres that was built at the same time holds tropical foliage and pretty spendy to visit.\n\nInside the garden at the highest point is the oldest iron structure in the world. The Buffon Gloriettes sits at the peak of a labyrinth that was once a medieval dump covered and home to a windmill in the 16th century. Named after the father of the garden it was built after his death and designed by locksmith Edme Verniquet in 1763. It’s made of iron, gold, lead, bronze and copper which is a perfect nod to the history of metal in the midst of the history of plants. It is 103 years younger than the most famous iron structure, the Eiffel Tower.\n\nOriginally it was topped with a sphere that would show the movements of the sun and a meridian marker that would mark high noon each day. Inside a small magnifying glass was a horse hair and each day as the sun hit it the hair would burn and then trigger a drum to strike. The sphere is still there but none of the cool inside works. On the cornice it is inscribed with “I only count the happy hours”.\n\nIn the 18th century it drew people at all hours to come see. From lovers sneaking away to children waiting for the drum to strike.\n\nThe garden is also filled with roses, over 1000 orchids, a huge peony garden, alpine, botanical and écological garden. Also the oldest zoo in the world can be found that dates to 1793 and was created for the royal menagerie of Versailles. Delacroix, Barye and Frémiet spend endless hours here sketching the animals for their paintings and sculptures.\n\nThe tympan over the door by Paul Balzc in 1870 is amazing and very different from most churches. The stained glass inside was created over time by Ernest Lami de Nozan and also Pierre Gaudin, son of Jean Gaudin whose stained glass designs can be found around France.\n\nIn 1768, Jean Bécu married Guillaume du Barry so she could be accepted into the court of Louis XV and his official mistress. Madame du Barry became the chief rival of Marie Antoinette and ended her life kicking and screaming to the guillotine.\n\nIt was also the former burial site of the family Sanson. The family business of the Sanson’s including Charles-Henri was that of executioners. Charles-Henri dropped the blade on over 2,500 hundred people including Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Her last words, “Excusez-moi monsieur, je ne voulais pas” were spoken to the Charles Henri Sanson. The family was later moved to Montparnasse cemetery.\n\nBetween the church and the Jardin Villemin was the convent of the Récollets. Made up of the 15th century Franciscian order. A monastery was first here in January of 1604 and enlarged by Marie de Medici in August 1614. It survived until just before the Revolution in 1790 and in 1802 became the Hospice of the Incurables-Hommes and eventually the St Martin military hospital and serviced many of the victims of the Prussian war and WWI. During WWI Big Bertha dropped a shell here and struck the church.\n\nHeading out onto the lower Canal Saint Martin to the Quai de Valmy that was once named the Quai Louis XVIII who died during the time the canal was constructed. The canal is made up of 9 locks and their foot and traffic bridges that cross them. Just outside of the garden is the Passerelle Bichat that is also made of cast iron.\n\nCrossing the Bichat on the Quai de Jémmapes that follows the canal is where you will find the Hotel du Nord. Built in 1912, it was purchased by Emile and Louise Dabit in 1923. Their son Eugene lived and worked there each night and took notes.\n\nEugene Dabit was an accomplished painter before he started to write and even displayed his art at the Salon des Independents in 1927 and 1928. In 1929 he wrote Hotel du Nord, the story centered around a young couple that came to stay at the hotel with a double sucide pact in mind. Things go awry and a prostitute and pimp are also involved. In 1938 it was made into a movie by Marcel Carmé.\n\nThe book was very popular and won the Populist Prize and of course became a well received and still beloved movie but it is actually the creation of the movie that makes the hotel itself so popular. When Carmé made it they decided not to film a single shot here on the canal but actually recreated an entire lifesize version of this area of the canal including the buildings and even digging a exact size trench to fill with water and also the cast iron bridge. The building was 7 feet deep and sadly nothing remains but because of this novelty at the time it drew people to the canal to see the real deal.\n\nThe Canal St Martin was first created under Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 and finished in 1825. It was needed to bring more water into the city to help ward off disease and also for boats to bring important things like wine and cheese to the big city. It was after all paid for by a tax placed on wine. The area was lined with industrial warehouses and not as many residences. In 1860 part of it was covered and also transformed under Haussmann. The canal ends at the Arsenal and eventually into the Seine and can be traveled on daily tourist boats.\n\nIn 2016 a long four month project of cleaning the canal was undertaken including draining all the water. The amount of bikes, wine bottles, chairs and tables were found is staggering and really disturbing as well.\n\nA walk along the canal on a warm spring or summer day will unfold with lots of people lining the canal laughing and drinking wine, and hopefully not tossing those bottles in the canal anymore. There are a few green spaces like the Square Frederick Lemaitre who was a French actor popular on the Avenue de Crime.\n\nAcross the Avenue du Faubourg de Temple is a marker dedicated to the victims of the horrible November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks that took place in the area.\n\nMusée de la Chasse et de la Nature, a hidden gem in a city with a museum for everything. It was created from the collection of François and Jacqueline Sommer who had a love for animals and nature. Originally based in the Ardennes, minister of culture under de Gaulle, André Malraux in 1964 found a new home for it in the Marais. The Hôtel de Guénégaud was built in 1652 by François Mansart and it is the only structure that remains in the city untouched from his original design.\n\nMalraux took on a huge initiative to rehabilitate the historic structures of the Marais and he set his sights on the Hôtel de Guénégaud. The Guénégaud passed through many hands and generations before it was given to the city and opened in 1967. In 40 years it was growing out of its pace and the Hôtel de Mongelas next store was acquired in 2002 and in 2007 the new larger space opened to the public and allowed a space for special exhibits.\n\nThe first curator Georges de Lastic was the brains behind the operation and created the amazing layout of the museum that feels more like a regal home. The walls are covered with art dedicated to animals and nature and don’t miss the small room of the gun collection of the kings. Even if it’s not your thing they really are works of art.\n\nLocated at 62 rue des Archives in the 3rd\n\nOpen Tuesday-Sunday 11am-6pm Wednesdays until 9:30pm (except July & August)\n\n10€ or 12€ if there is also a special exhibition\n\nNo 72 rue des Archives. Hôtel Villeflix and also no 70 were built on the property once owned by Marguerite Simm, wife of François de Montescot who was close with Louis XIV and had the extra large home torn down to build two large homes instead. In 1656 Louis de Bailleul, president of the Parliament of Paris moved in and then Louis François Vireau de Villeflix, master of the king's coffers, added a bit more decor as well as the allegories over the door.\n\nNo 76 rue des Archives is the Hôtel Le Peletier de Souzy. Above the door is a relief of attributes of a warrior as well as the initials ove the door of the former owners. OLB for Octavien Le Bys and MDA for his wife Marie d’Aluymare. From the street while the two doors are different the inner courtyard is split by a thin wall. Antoine Landry designed both 74 and 76 and were built at the same time in the mid 17th century.\n\nNo 78 a lovely wood door and cherubs at the top of the Hotel de Tallard. Built in 1702 by Pierre Buillet who also designed the Port Saint Martin. Denis Aelot de Chaillon first lived here until 1722 when the Duc de Tallard, Camille d’Houston moved in.\n\nThe stretch of rue des Archives from the museum until number 78 were built between 1650 and early 1700’s. Of the 10 originals 8 still remain.\n\nAt no 67 what is today a post office was once the site of the Hôtel Fabry and built in the 1600’s. It was torn down in 1949 but the painted beams and ceilings were saved and are now in the Hôtel de Sully another great place to visit just down the street and rarely visited by tourists.\n\nIf you are a fan of the classic black and white photography of Paris of the past, add the Fondation Henri Cartier Bresson to your list of places you must see. Originally opened in Montparnasse in 2003 and moved to this location in 2013. Henri was born August 22, 1908 in Chanteloup-en-Brie and started out as a painter and hung out with the Surrealists. While serving in the military and station in the Cote d'Ivoire he picked up a camera for the first time. His gorgeous photos of Paris are some of the most iconic images of the city ever seen.\n\n79 rue des Archives\n\nOpen Tuesday-Sunday 11am-7pm 9 €\n\nThe nearby Marché des Enfants Rouge was named for the Hopital des Enfants Rouge that once stretched across the street and where the Archives ended. The sister of François I, Marguerite de Navarre asked for money and help for the children that were dying in the hospital. It was crowded that children could not be cared for and most died before ever being taken care of.\n\nOf course he agreed and the sick children were able to get help and survive. They were all dressed in red which is where the name comes from that is now shared with the nearby market as well. The hospital thrived for almost 300 years until Louis XV no longer wanted to fund it. There had been many more facilities added between François and Louis XV.\n\nThe building was split up into five separate lots and in 1796 three were completely destroyed when rue des Archives was cut through. In the entry and courtyard of no 90 on the east side of the street you can see a bit of what is left and also across the street on the north and west side, a few of those walls were once a part of the hospital that saved the children.\n\nRue des Archives ends in front of the spot that was once the Tour de Temple. Built in 1240 for the Templars it was once outside the edge of Paris. The four tall turrets, two large and two small were turned into a prison for some very special guests on August 13, 1792. The family of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI. At first they were all together in a few rooms of the smaller tour, including the former office of the librarian that was filled with books.\n\nOn September 29, Louis XVI was removed from the smaller tour and separated from his family. The windows were covered with blinds so he couldn’t communicate with anyone. Louis XVI spent all his time reading and said that he finished over 250 books from August 1792 until his death. On December 11, 1792, 361 people voted for his execution, against 360 who voted for it. On January 21, 1793 he was killed by guillotine.\n\nBack at the tower his family found out from the screaming crowds below their windows. Marie, her sister in law Elisabeth along with her daughter Marie-Therese and son Louis- Charles, now Louis XVII remained together until July 3, 1793 when he was taken from them. The royalty was out and the eight year old Louis-Charles was not going to be king but they wanted to be sure that if that was to happen that they would brainwash him and change everything he had learned from his parents.\n\nOn August 2, 1793 it was Marie Antoinette’s turn. Ripped from her family and taken to the Conceregie on the Ile de la Cité where she would later learn at her trial what terrible things they had forced her son to believe. On October 14 her trial began. One of the charges implicated that she had sexually abused her son and that he confessed to it. She was heartbroken and begged the women of the courtroom to believe her. Her fate was sealed long before the trial.\n\nAt 4:30am on October 14, 1793 she was convicted and sentenced to death that would come just five and a half hours later in the same spot her husband was killed. At the tour her son would never learn the fate of his mother. For two more years he was treated terribly without any hygiene, little food, constantly giving him wine and liquor instead of water and in a small dark room. On June 8 1795 after six horrible months he died at just ten years old, spending three of them here.\n\nThere was one survivor, Marie-Therese or Madame Royale. The only member of the family to survive was finally released on December 19, 1795 in a trade with Austria for French prisoners. It wouldn’t be until then that she learned of her mothers death, over two years later. We did a four part podcast episode of the life of Marie Antoinette and episode four is about Madame Royale and what she became after those difficult years. Listen to it here.\n\nIn 1808 Napoleon had it torn down when his opponents were using it as a symbol to the former Bourbon dynasty. Today in it’s place to the east is the mayor's office of the Paris Centre which on July 11, 2020 combined the mayors of the 1st through 4th arrondissements. This former office of the 3rd arrondissement now is the seat, (all though the other 3 still remain, France…)\n\nOpposite is the lovely English style Square du Temple- Elie Wiesel that was created in 1857 under Haussmann and Napoleon III. The rocks in the water feature come from Fontainebleau and the lovely iron musician kiosk dates back to 1900.\n\nIn 2016 the mayor of the 3rd wanted to change its name to the Square Elie Wiesel but people were rather attached to the Square du Temple so it was agreed that the name would be lengthened. Elie Wiesel was born in Romania and at 15 he and his entire family were sent to Auschwitz. His mother and youngest sister were killed upon arrival and his father shortly followed. In April 1945 he and his two surviving sisters were released when the ally troops arrived and he eventually made his way to Paris where he attended the Sorbonne.\n\nThrough the rest of his life he wrote about his time at the concentration camps and what he saw. He help opened centers and museums dedicated to the Holocaust and those that were lost and also lived through it. In 1963 he became an American citizen and in 1986 won the Nobel Peace Prize. When Klaus Barbie went on trial for the horrible acts he was involved in, Weisel was there as a witness. He died on July 2, 2016 but his fight and memory still goes on.\n\nJust across from the mayor’s office is the Carreau du Temple. A stunning cast iron and glass building that covers the block. A market stood in this area since the Middle Ages. Over time goldsmiths, linen and fur merchants were all set up here. Eventually a large stone rotunda was built to house them but as the city expanded so did the markets and this one was taken over by scammers and thieves. In 1863 the stone building was demolished and Ernest Legrand and Jules de Mérindal designed this lovely cast iron pavilion. There were once 6 of these that covered the area, now all that remains are these two. In 1976 the old mayor across the street wanted to destroy these and put up a parking lot but was met with a lot of oppositions and the people won. Restored from 2007 to 2012 it was opened to the public in 2013. It now holds special events including the fashion show today, March 6, 2022 from the house of Valentino.\n\nJust down the street at the corner of rue Dupetit-Thouars and rue Gabriel Vicaire is an old plaque showing the map of the area and where the tower prison once stood. Don’t miss this when you visit.\n\nAt the end of the street is the lovely Église Sainte Elisabeth de Hongrié. First built under Marie de Medici who laid the first stone on May 14, 1643 which was also the 33rd anniversary of her husband, Henri IV death. Construction was halted along the way and finally finished under Anne of Austria, wife of Louis XIII. Sainte Elisabeth of Hungary was the daughter of King Andree II of Hungary. She was betrothed at 4 years old to Louis IV of Thuringia in 1221. Six years later he would die and she hung up her crown and devoted herself to the church.\n\nElisabeth died at just 24 years old after devoting her life to the poor and starving people of the town. Named a saint after her death, her miracle attributed to her was of a lovely bunch of roses. Always giving to others she would sneak out loaves of bread under her cloak to take to the hungry. One day her husband stopped her and asked what she had under her cloak and instead of bread she said roses. As he opened her cloak all he found was stems and stems of roses.\n\nWe end the walk today at the Place de la Republique where Marianne stands proudly over the city. The intersection of the 3rd, 10th and 11th arrondissements was once just a small park named the Place du Chateau d’Eau for the fountain that served the area water. Under Haussmann It was turned into a larger area with a roundabout with bronze lions around a larger fountain by Gabriel Davioud. In 1879 the city decided it needed a new monument dedicated to the 90th anniversary of the Revolution.\n\nWe start the walk under the mural by CK Combo of TinTIn and Captain Haddock kissing at the crossroads of Rue d’Aboukir and Rue des Petits Carreaux.\n\nJust to the right is the living wall at No 83, the Oasis of Aboukir by Patrick Blanc created in 2013.\n\nThis area and street was once just outside the wall of Charles V that was built in 1356. The Rue d’Aboukir itself was just outside the ditch which ran on the south side of the street. It was demolished in 1634.\n\nNo 82 to 86 on the south side are the oldest and date back to 1640-1650. The street is named for the battle of Aboukir fought on July 25, 1799 between the French led by Napoleon and the Ottoman Turks in Egypt. Many of the streets in the surrounding area are named for events and locations in Egypt.\n\nRight on Rue de Damiette, also named after a battle in Egypt, the battle of Damiette on November 1, 1799. This area was known for its Courtyard of Miracles back in the 16th century. Beggars, thieves and prostitutes set up here and enticed others to come showing that if they were sick or suffering they could be healed. There was a king and a full court that flourished under for over 200 years. Many would arrive and be miraculously cured overnight, when in fact many weren’t sick at all and the ruse was all to rob people looking for help. These courtyards were located around the city but this was the largest and was finally disbanded on August 21, 1784.\n\nRue du Nil, named for the Nile, the longest river in Africa, is a short street that is filled with everything you need. If it’s not on this street, you don’t need it. Not that long ago it was vacant and run down stores and then in 2009 Grégory Marchand arrived and opened Frenchie. Grégory got the nickname “Frenchie” from Jamie Oliver when he worked at his restaurant Fifteen in London and after working in London and New York he came back to Paris and opened the small 26 seat restaurant here on Rue du Nil.\n\nReservations for Frenchie open 3 weeks out and go quick. Open Monday to Friday for lunch and dinner, grab a reservation when you can.\n\nIn 2011 he opened Frenchie Bar à Vin and in 2018 Frenchie To Go. With the success of each of these restaurants the rest of the street began to fill with the purveyors that provided his fantastic products. A produce market, fromagerie, bucherie, boulangerie that smells amazing as well as coffee, ice cream and the Frenchie Caviste.\n\nThere is even a Frenchie Pigalle and he has also worked on many of the Experimental cocktail bars on their menu. Marchand is also incredibly humble and one of the nicest chefs (after my Comptoir family ) in Paris.\n\nWhat many think of as Rue Montogeuil is technically Rue des Petits-Carreaux. On the left at No 10 is a ceramic panel that was added in 1890 for the store once here that sold coffee and spices from exotic locations. The plaque shows a slave serving a colonial white man. Named a historic monument in 1984 it is not without its controversy and a victim of vandalism.\n\nA few doors down at No 6 is a former charcuterie that was created in the late 19th century and classified as a historical monument for its facade and interior.\n\nWhere Cafe Compas is now, from no 64 - 74 was the location of the Compas d’Or. A large stagecoach station and inn that was also the site of a lot of crime in the 19th and 20th century.\n\nAt No 67 down in the sidewalk is a plaque that reminds everyone of a horrible act that took place in 1750. On January 4, 1750 Jean Diot and Bruno Lenior were arrested after being spotted in an “indecent position” at 11am. They were arrested and put on trial and sentenced to death. Jean was 40 and worked at a nearby charcuterie and Bruno was 21 and a shoemaker. On July 6,, 1750 at 5pm the two were strangled and burned to death for their homesexuality. A plaque was added in 2014 and has been vandalized many times.\n\nNo 59 was once the location of Au Rocher de Cancale, opened in 1804 by Alexis Balaine who was an oyster seller at Les Halles. In 1815 it was sold to Jean Pierre de Montalivet who elevated the restaurant to fine dining to compete with the excess and money that was spreading through Paris under Louis-Philippe. In 1846 after losing all his money he closed the location and reopened on Rue de Richelieu.\n\nAcross the street at No 78 M. Pécune opened a restaurant and after 1846 renamed it Au Rocher de Cancale. Balzac used the restaurant many times in his grand work, La Comedie Humaine as well as frequenting the location. Alexander Dumas and Théophile Gautier and many of the authors gathered here.\n\nEscargot Montorgueil was opened in 1832 or 1836 and was once on the old road and Poissonniere gate. In 1900 Theodore Lécomte took over and turned it into an upscale restaurant. André Terrail who also owned La Tour d’Argent in 1914 bought Escargot in 1919 and with the former chef to the king of Europe Francois Lespina redid the menu once again. In 1923 at a Druout auction, Terrail bought the ceiling designed by Georges Jules Victor Clarin for the apartment of Sarah Bernhadt and added it to the restaurant. During this period it was a hot spot in Paris but when Les Halles slowly disappeared so did the customers.\n\nSince 2010 it has been owned by Emma Laporte and has been restoring it to its former glory.\n\nAbove the door at number 17 is a plain sign that says Passage de la Reine de Hongrie. Did the Queen of Hungary once live here? Well sort of. Julie Bécheur, the “Rose de Mai” lived here in 1789 and had a striking resemblance to the archduchess MarieTherese of Austria and queen of Hungary, better known as the mother of Marie Antoinette.\n\nOnce at Versailles the young queen saw Julie and was shocked to see how much she looked like her mother. The passage was named for Julie who was well known and loved in the area. She would sadly lose her head during the Revolution, maybe looking like the mother of the most hated woman in Paris wasn’t such a good thing.\n\nQuai aux Fleurs, originally the Quai Napoléon and renamed for the flower market at the end of the quai\n\nNo 9 & 11 is where the former home of Canon Fulbert lived with his niece Heloise.\n\nUncle Fulbert served as a canon at the Hotel Dieu de Paris on the Ile de la Cité where he also lived. His house on the Quai aux Fleurs looking at ile Saint Louis was large and had room for a few renters so he offered a room to Abelard. Abelard was a schoolmaster for the Cloister Catholic School and was known all over Paris for his handsome looks and charismatic personality.\n\nAbelard and Heloise were taken with each other immediately and to spend more time together he took her on as his personal student. The two began a very hot and steamy affair that they kept from Fulbert. That is until she became pregnant. Abelard took her to Brittany to stay with his sister Dionysis. In the fall of 1116 Astrolab was born.\n\nReturning to Paris, Heloise and Abelard tried to smooth things over with Fulbert. Abelard proposed they get married, complete against the wishes of Heloise who thought marriage was a form of prostitution and would also hurt his career.\n\nThey wed early in the morning at the Chapel of Saint Christophe which once stood on the parve of Notre Dame. Fulbert was briefly happy with the arraignment, until he decided he wasn’t. In the dark of night he sent a few goons to the house of Abelard and the men castrated him.\n\nHeloise left Paris for the convent of Saint Marie d’Argenteuil where she would become a nun. Even that couldn’t keep the lovers apart and he would climb a wall for some sexy meetings. Abelard would eventually leave Paris to set up his own convent and chapel and the two would keep in touch through their letters.\n\nListen to the story of their entire life in this episode of Paris History Avec a Hemingway on La Vie Creative Podcast.\n\nNo 19 former Saint-Aignan chapel built in 1116. Heloise attended the church as well as a visit from Saint Bernard. It served as a chapel until 1791 and was one of the 23 chapels that filled the end of the island.\n\nInside the building now parts of the old chapel are still found. Eight columns dating back to the 12th century remain as well as a small statue. The brick building with the ND tiles is part of Notre Dame and the Catholic Seminary. This is also where the beloved Virgin and Child statue that stood to the right of the altar was found. A smaller copy is up on the facade. Sadly we can’t get in to see the chapel.\n\nRue de la Colombe\n\nThe original building at number 4 was built in 1228, at the same time as Notre Dame and was the home of one of the builders. One day the house collapsed and two doves were trapped inside. The male dove was able to get out and everyday he would bring back food and water for the lady dove still trapped inside. Neighbors noticed this and help dig the sweet little dove out and free them both. The two are still immortalized on the facade of the building as well as the name of the street, Colombe means Dove. So sweet.\n\nNo 24, Au Vieux Paris d’Arcole. Built in 1512 and once the home of the canons of the church. In the spring it is one of the prettiest spots in Paris as the entire facade is dripping with wisteria.\n\nNo 22/24 was the home of a grim tale. There once stood a building that had a barber shop and a bakery. The barber had daily visits from the students of the Cloister of Notre Dame but every once in a while, one never made it out. A trap door below would send the freshly coiffed victim to his death where he was chopped up and then the baker made pate, beef pies and sausage. They were a hit with everyone including the king.\n\nOne day a German student named Alaric went to get his haircut and brought his beloved dog. The dog sat outside for two days waiting for his master and began barking alert neighbors and Alaric’s friends. The police arrived and after searching the building found out exactly what had been going on. The two were later held in metal cages and burned alive on the Place de Greve. Today it is the police garage for the motorcycles and the stone where they cut them up is said to still be there.\n\nNo 17 Former home of Archbishop of Paris Cardinal de Retz from 1654-1662 who arrived in Paris with Catherine de Medicis. Once he took up sides against Cardinal Mazarin he was ousted from Paris.\n\nNo 12 Hotel du Grand Chantre built in the 17th century, the facade remains while they had redone the interior\n\nNo 8 The red brick facade dates back to 1853 but with medieval details and was a fire station until 1868 and now the school of the Magistrate.\n\nThis entire area was once covered with the cloister of Notre Dame that once was gated off and the women were not allowed to enter.\n\nComing up on the north side of Notre Dame that is now walled off and covered with scaffolding. All three of the rose windows survived and the north and south are now covered and protected and with very little damage thanks to the decades of dust protecting them from the lead dust.\n\nOn the right coming to the front of the church is the Hotel Dieu, the oldest hospital in Europe and originally built in 651 by the Bishop of Paris Saint Landry. In 1165 Bishop Maurice de Sully used much of his own money to build Notre Dame and decided to rebuild the hospital at the same time. Patients slept 3 to a bed and everyone that came was treated. The current hospital was built in 1866 but the interior was updated in the 1950’s. It is due to go through another large renovation soon.\n\nThe parvais of Notre Dame stretching out from in front of the church was once covered with chapels and homes. It was all removed over time and under Haussmann and in 1965 they were going to build a car park beneath it. Instead they discovered the Gallo-Roman remains and the foundations of the former chapels. It is now the Archeological Crypt and can be visited once again. It is very interesting and worth a visit.\n\nSquare René Viviani and oldest living tree in Paris.\n\nNamed for French lawyer and politician René Viviani who served on the French council and minister of justice that passed a law allowing women to become lawyers in 1900. In the center is a sculpture by Georges Jeanclos that tells the story of Saint Julien added in 1995.\n\nThe park also holds former pieces from Notre Dame de Paris removed under Viollet-le-Duc in the 19th century.\n\nThe oldest living thing in Paris is also found her but we all took a collective gasp when we saw it. Hopefully it is just pruned back a bit for the winter. It dates back to 1601 and was added by Jean Robin who was the gardener to Henri IV and director of the Jardin des Plantes. It survived WWI when a shell hit it and destroyed two branches. Two concrete braces have been added to hold it up and we will be checking in on it again soon to be sure it is still doing ok.\n\nEglise Saint Julien le Pauvre is located on the route of the Saint Jacques de Compostela and at the intersection of two Roman roads. In the courtyard of rh church to the left of the cage is a piece of the old Roman road, making it one of the oldest things in Paris. The church itself dated back to the 6th century and was destroyed by the vikings in 886. Rebuilt in 1125 it was the school of the students of the Hotel Dieu and Sorbonne\n\nThe legend of Saint Julien as written by Gustave Flaubert dates from the Middle Ages when one day hunting in the woods, a deer he had in his sights turned to him and told him that he may want to kill him now, but next he will kill his parents next. Years later after he has married he went out hunting again, but is still haunted by the reminder of what the deer told him. While he was gone his parents came to visit.\n\nTired from their trip, they slept in his bed. Julien returned home thinking it was his wife with another man in their bed and he killed them. The curse of the deer had come true. Horrified, he fled the house and spent time alone until he came across a river. Giving himself up to a life of service he began running a boat from shore to shore. One day a leper arrived, asking for clothes and a place to sleep. Julien gave him the clothes off his back and his bed. The leper revealed himself that he was in fact Jesus, and absolved him of his sins.\n\nJust down the street a bit is the oldest street sign in Paris.\n\nDating back to the 14th century, maybe even longer. First mentioned in 1380 the sign at 42 rue Galande depicts a scene from the story of Saint Julien l’Hospitalier. Rue Galande itself dates back to 1200 and was once the Gallo-Roman road connecting Lutecia to Fontainebleau. Named after Ettienne de Garlande who served as the archdeacon of the nearby Notre-Dame in 1105 and a close confidant of king Louis VI. Within the wall of Philippe Auguste Garlande owned a large piece of land, the Clos de Garlande with a vineyard, orchard and large home. Today all that remains is the street named after it, and without the R.\n\nThe bas-relief on rue Galande, depicts that moment. The relief you see is a copy, the original is safely away in the Louvre. We are also just steps away from the Eglise Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre where you will also find the last remaining stone of the Gallo-Roman road.\n\nQuai d’Anjou\n\nNo 1 by Louis Le Vau and was built for Jean-Baptiste Lambert de Thodigny in 1640. He tapped some of the best artists of the time to create the decor and ceilings including Charle Le Brun, Eustache Le Seur and François Perrier. The small Cabinet de l’Amour was an alcove with a canopy bed that the lady of the house would welcome her visitors. The walls and ceilings were decorated with the panels by Le Seur dedicated to the story of L’Amour, Cupid. Today the sketches and a few of the originals are in the Louvre, on the 2nd floor of the Sully wing. Le Sueur also did the Cabinet of Muse’s that had you guessed it, paintings of the muses and are also in the same room of the Louvre.\n\nVoltaire and the Marquis du Chateelet, his lover, used it from time to time and held a popular salon. From 1732 to 1739 Claude and Louise-Marie Dupin, great grandparents of George Sand purchased and lived here. One of its highest points was in 1843 when Prince Adam Jerry Czartoryski, a Polish prince bought the large property that saw many of the Romantic artists and writers including Delacroix. Balzac, George Sand and Chopin. Oriental and Polish themed balls were held and Chopin even wrote a few of his most popular pieces for the events.\n\nGuy and Marie-Helene de Rothschild owned it from 1975 to 2007 at his death when it was sold to the current owner, the brother of the Emir de Qatar. At $111 million it was one of the most expensive at the time. The Emir wanted to do a massive renovation that would destroy much of the original interior and the city was up in arms. The city put a stop to it and the Ministry of Culture sued the owner to stop them. After three years a deal was reached that required an official from the city be involved every step of the way, In 2013 while under construction a fire broke out on the roof and damaged or destroyed much of the Le Seuer and Le Brun paintings.\n\nNo 3 Hotel Le Vau built by architect Louis Le Vau for his own residence.\n\nNo 5 Hotel de Marigny, built in 1640 and home to the inventor of the Marly machine that brought water to the fountains of Versailles.\n\nNo 7 The Hotel Lambert once stretched all the way to number 7. It now holds the Bakery Guild of Paris.\n\nNo 9. In the 19th century Lithographer and painter Honoré Daumier lived here. From 1846-1863 he also did political cartoons and sculpteurs.\n\nNo 11 The man that we can thank for much of the beauty of Notre Dame and Sainte Chapelle lived here. Adolph Geoffrey-Dechaume worked with Viollet Le Duc on both churches and designed the 16 statues that once lined the roof and the rooster at the top of the spire. All the statues escaped a dismal fate when they just happen to be removed 4 days prior to the fire. Today you can see all 16 beauties in Paris up close at the Cite de l'Architecture. Listen to the story of each of them in the past episode of Paris History Avec A Hemingway\n\nNo 13, once a part of its neighbor at number 11 it was separated and physicist Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceaus lived here.\n\nNo 15 The ivy on framing the windows are wonderful. Louis Le Vau also built this one in 1645 that was part of the Hotel Lambert. Paul Cézanne lived here and for a few short months in 1843 Charles Beaudelaire did until he moved one door down.\n\nNo 17, the Hotel Lauzun, one of the addresses I desperately want to see inside of. It was built in 1657 by Charles Chamois for Charles Gruyn, a wealthy French banker. In 1682 it was purchased by its namesake the Duc de Lauzun and three years later the niece of Cardinal Mazarin, Hortense Mazarin and her husband the nephew of Cardinal RIchelieu, Charles de la Porte. Hortense was fourteen years younger then Charles and he had a mean, jealous streak and was very controlling. The home was filled with the statues that once belonged to Cardinal Richelieu. One night when she was out he went into a rage and started to attack the marble statues, knocking off the naughty bits of male statues. Luckily they were later repaired and now are in the Musée du Louvre.\n\nBaudelaire moved in from next door in 1843 and lived there for two years. Paranoid and on drugs much of the time he covered the windows with paper so he was always in the dark.\n\nThe inside interior has amazing carved woodwork and decorations by Charles Le Brun and Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer. Don’t miss the dolphin drain spout on the facade as well.\n\nNo 19 built in 1642 is now a kindergarten\n\nNo 23 & 25 Once was much larger and divided into four separate residences. The field marshal of Louis XIV once lived here.\n\nNo 29 William Bird’s Three Mountain Press was opened in 1922 and in 1924 a young Hemingway had his first In Our Time published. Just 170 copies\n\nNo 33 Au Rendezvous de Mariniers where Picasso, Hemingway and John dos Passo would hang out\n\nNo 37 Hemingway’s friend John Dos Passo moved in here in 1921\n\nNo 39 the Theatre Ile Saint Louis, which we happily saw today is open and doing shows and concerts.\n\nWe cross over to the Quai de Bourbon and past the Rue des Deux-Ponts named for the two bridges it leads to, the Pont de la Tournelle and Pont Marie.\n\nQuai Bourbon\n\nNo 11 the former home of painter Philippe de Champaigne in 1643. The official painter to Richelieu was born in Belgium and stopped in Paris on his way to Rome. Marie de Medicis asked him to paint a few frescos in the Palais du Luxembourg when he would also meet Richelieu. His stunning painting of Richelieu in full Cardinal dress is in the Louvre.\n\nNo 17 & 19 Hotel de Jaussaud. Built in 1642 for Nicolas de Jassaud, advisor to Louis XIII and it stayed with his heirs until 1768. Artist Francois Mouchet lived here while he was storming the Tuileries on June 20, 1792 that quickly marked the end of Louis XVI.\n\nThe most famous resident at no 19 was the wonderful Camille Claudel who moved here in 1899 the same year she ended her relationship with Rodin. In a ground floor apartment and studio she hid herself away, rarely leaving. Commissions for private pieces kept her going but eventually her mental health started to crumble.

On March 7, 1913 she was diagnosed with dementia, malnutrition, alcoholism and paranoia. Placed in the Ville Evrard asylum in Seine St Denis, Paul told the doctors that no one was allowed to visit and letters were never to be given to her. Back at her studio on Ile Saint Louis, her family destroyed what was left of it. Nothing was spared.\n\nFor thirty years Camille was locked up and alone and at two in the morning on October 19, 1943 she died alone of a stroke brought on by malnutrition at the age of 78. For thirty years she rarely had a visitor including her family. When she died, Paul declined to pay for a tomb or marker and the beautiful artist was buried in the cemetery at the asylum with only a few staff in attendance.\n\nListen to her entire heartbreaking story about the woman that left us beautiful and emotional art we can love for generations.\n\nSide street Rue le Regrattier has a fun little treat up above on the corner.

Few kings lived here but a few died. Louis XII died here on January 1, 1515 and his son in-law Francois I took the throne. It was his son Henri II that also died here and saw the end of the Hotel.\n\nOn June 29, 1559 a grand celebration was held of the joint marriage of his daughter Elisabeth de France to Philip II of Spain and the king’s sister Marguerite de France to the duc de Savoie. Henri II, being the macho guy that he was and showing off for his longtime mistress Diane de Poitiers, decided to have one more jousting match.\n\nGabriel de Montgomery was his opponent and as he charged towards the king his horse reared up and the joust broke. As he lunged towards the king whose visor was up the lance struck his eye. The king stumbled away from his horse to the Hotel des Tournelles where he suffered in pain for 12 days before dying on July 10, 1559. On his deathbed he forgave Gabriel but his widow Catherine de Medici did not.\n\nListen to the podcast episode we did all about Catherine\n\nGabriel served as the lieutenant general for the army of Jeanne d'Albret, queen of Navare and mother of Henri III (future king Henri IV). He was on the side of the Protestants during Catherine’s Saint Bartholomew day massacre and escaped with his life but she would finally get her revenge. Once Gabriel had taken slides with the illegitimate brother of king Charles IX he was public enemy number one.\n\nIn 1574 at Domfront where his army was overtaken, Gabriel was captured and returned to Paris. At the Conciergerie he was charged with lèse-majesté, an attack on the sovereign and on June 26, 1574 he was tortured and beheded at the Place de Greve as Catherine watched.\n\nAfter Henri’s death Catherine wanted nothing to do with the Tournelles and had the Palais des Tuileries built near the Palais du Louvre. The Tournelles served as a horse market for a period until 1603 when Henri IV decided he wanted a silk market created to rival Lyon and Milan. The former Tournelles that was now destroyed would become the factory to the north and housing to the south. Strict building codes were put into place and many couldn’t afford to match them. Much of the property fell to the elite and members of the king's inner circle which we will discover as we stroll around.\n\nThe center of Place des Vosges is marked with the Square Louis XIII that harkens back to the inauguration of the Place Royale as it was originally called. The first royal square in Paris was inaugurated in April 1612 at the announcement of the engagement of Louis XIII and Anne d’Autriche. In the center is a slightly unusual monument of Louis XIII. It replaces the original by Jean Pierre Cortot who also created the four fountains. Much of the square was destroyed during the Revolution and the original bronze statue was melted down. On November 4, 1829 the current statue was inaugurated and created by Charles Dupaty after the original design of Cortot. What is odd about this monument is the funny little tree stump under the horse's belly. As his belly began to collapse a “crutch” was added, holding it up and designed to look like a tree stump.\n\nThe Place des Vosges has gone through many name changes, starting with Place Royale. During the Revolution it was changed to Place des Fédérés. In 1800 Lucien Bonapartre, minister of the interior under his brother Napoleon, suggested it be changed to Place des Vosges.Vosges was the first department to pay taxes to the new French Republic and that deserved something special apparently. It went back and forth from Royale in 1814, Vosges in 1830, Republic in 1848, back to Royale in 1852 and finally to the Place des Vosges in 1871 until today.\n\nFrom the outset they look to be a collection of 36 identical pavillons with two exceptions. The south side was built first and in the center it is, of course the Pavillon de Roi and is higher than any of the other roof lines, bien sûr. Construction began in 1605 with master mason Jonas Robelin and carpenter Gilles Le Redde adding the extra elements to the facade and decor but the king would never stay there. It wasn’t completed until 1612 and Henri IV died in 1610. In fact not a single royal lived in this royal square.\n\nThe buildings are laid out with odd numbers to the west and even to the east starting at the Pavillon de Roi and ending at the Pavillon de Reine which also towers over the other building on the opposite side, but not quite as tall as the kings.\n\nNo 11, has one of my very fast secret little finds.\n\nThe pavilion itself was at one time the home of Maria de Lorme, the courtesan that inspired a Victor Hugo play. But it's on the outer pilar that you can find something very special. Half way down you see the etching of 1764 Nicolas. It is the oldest known graffiti in Paris and has been there for 258 years. Nicola Restif de La Bretonne was a printmaker and at night he would roam the streets leaving his mark everywhere he went. Nicknamed Le Griffon, the scribbler, he came long before JR or Banksy and still tells the tale.\n\nNo 13 Grand Hotel de Rohan\n\nArchitect Louis Le Vau redid the interior for Antoine d’Aurnot.\n\nNo 15\n\nPainter Auguste Laurent Boulard lived her in the 18th century and in 1875 it became the Center for Decorative Arts.\n\nNo 17 Hotel Chabannes\n\nBishop of Meaux Jacques-Beigne Bossuet lived here and is the only pavilion to still have all of its original beams and interior decor.\n\nNo 19 Hotel Montbrun\n\nOnce called the Maison du Grand Henri and had a bust of the king but wouldn’t survive the Revolution. The cafe Ma Bourgogne is below and a restaurant has been in this location since 1827. It is quite good and a perfect place to sit on a sunny afternoon\n\nNo 21 Hotel Cardinal Richelieu\n\nAlthough the illustrious cardinal never lived here. His great-grand nephew did and also bought the neighborgin pavilion that was owned by the Prince de Guise who would be his future father in-law.\n\nNo 23 Hotel Bassompierre\n\nMarie Touchet, mistress to Charles X and before that Marie Charlotte, mistress to Marshal Francois de Bassompierre.\n\nNo 25 the Hotel de Gobelin du Quesnoy\n\nPierre Gobelin du Quesnoy and his two sons lived here during the 17th century. His son Thomas had a little thing for the future Madame de Montespan and on March 4, 1680 he sent the pavillon a blaze to prove his love for her. It also partially destroyed his neighbors which is the Pavillon de Reine.\n\nMadame de Montespan would go on to become one of Louis XIV’s favorite mistresses and mother of a few children, However, when her role in the Affair of the Poisons was uncovered she was swiftly moved out of Versailles. Listen to her entire story in this episode of Paris History Avec A Hemingway.\n\nNo 28, the Pavillon de Reine\n\nTaller than the neighbors but not as tall as the king, it is topped with a few Fleur de Lys, marking its lovely distinction. Nicolas Jeannin de Castille, a treasurer under Nicolas Fouquet lived here until he was caught up in Louis XIV’s vendetta against Fouquet and was also stripped of his home and sent to prison.\n\nNo 26 Hotel Tresmes\n\nCharles de Vaolis lived here from 1611 to be close to his mother at no. 23\n\nNo 24 Hotel Vitry\n\nClaude Nicolas Ledoux designed a stunning staircase here that has since been destroyed.

The bedroom ceiling held the history of Psyché who is the subject of the newest episode of Paris History Avec a Hemingway. Much of the decor was saved and is now in the Musée Carnavalet.\n\nNo 12 Hotel de Castille\n\nPierre de Castille, comptroller de France In 1634 Jérôme de Nouveau superintendant of the post has Eustache Le Sueur and Charles Le Brun paint the ceilings and salons of the home. Weekly salons were held and the Paris elite jostled for a spot each Friday night. The city of Paris took over the building in 1852 and destroyed the interior, putting a girls school in its place.\n\nNo 10 Hotel de Chastillon\n\nClaude Chastillon in 1605 was the engineer and geographer for Henri IV. Louis XIII would often visit to see his mechanical creations that fascinated him.\n\nNo 8 Hotel de Fourcy\n\nSuperintendent of the kings buildings under Henri IV Jean de Fourcy had it built in 1605 then gave it to Antoine Le Redde, master carpenter.\n\nPoet, author and art critic Theophile Gautier was born here and then moved back from 1828"
