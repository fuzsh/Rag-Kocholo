        "text": "Political career.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nHistory Buff Quiz\n\nUnder the Orleanist monarchy, Thiers was undersecretary of state for the treasury (1830), minister of the interior (1832 and 1834–36), and minister of trade and public works (1833–34). During those years, he was the most notable representative of the Party of Resistance (conservative moderates). He mercilessly crushed all insurrections, in particular those of the legitimists under the Duchesse de Berry in 1832 and of the Republicans in 1834. Premier and minister of foreign affairs (1836 and 1840), in his second term of office his support of the Egyptian pasha Muḥammad ʿAlī almost led to war with England because of a conflicting Middle Eastern policy. Forced to resign by King Louis-Philippe’s determination to avert war, Thiers nevertheless remained a leader of the resistance party.\n\nAfter the Revolution of February 1848, Thiers returned to the Assembly as a representative for Seine Inferieure. Though he helped elect Prince Louis-Napoleon to the presidency of the Second Republic (1849), the two later became estranged. Exiled from 1851 to 1853, Thiers again became a deputy under the Second Empire and was originally one of those who favoured war with Prussia in 1870. During the war crisis, however, Thiers changed his views and became an opponent of the aggressive policy that he had previously advocated. This swing stood him in good stead after the French defeat in September 1870; he thus became the wise man who had foreseen the folly of pursuing such a policy without adequate military power. He was clever enough to remain out of the national defense government set up after the fall of the Empire (September) and thus had no responsibility for the final French surrender in January 1871. In February he was elected simultaneously for 26 départements and on February 17 became “chief of the executive power of the French Republic.” In August 1871 he became president of the republic. Thiers believed that France could be united under a conservative republic and tried to win the monarchist opposition over to this view. His first major task was to restore political order. In concert with the Germans, he ruthlessly used troops to defeat the Paris insurrection known as the Commune (March–May 1871), thus destroying for many years the strength of French Socialists and workers’ movements. But even this did not win him the support of the monarchists, and in 1873 he resigned. Meanwhile, his financial skill had enabled France to pay off ahead of time the indemnity due the Germans. But his military law of 1872 failed to establish an adequate professional army and the five years’ conscription period he introduced seriously depleted the labour force."
