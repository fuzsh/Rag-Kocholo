Architectural historian Marci Clark will draw on details of her recent dissertation on the collaboration of architect I.M. Pei and developer William Zeckendorf, Sr. and discuss their twelve-year partnership on two projects that began as Title 1 slum clearance sites, Kips Bay Towers and NYU’s University Village and Silver Towers. The high quality of design and execution of these publicly-assisted, middle-income housing complexes complicate the standard narrative of humdrum urban renewal in postwar New York. Columbia Professor Emerita of Real Estate Lynne Sagalyn will comment and moderate the Q & A.
