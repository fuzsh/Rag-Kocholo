        "text": "Summary of I. M. Pei\n\nThe Chinese-American I. M. Pei, is one of this century's most venerated architects. In a career spanning six decades, he became universally admired for his skill in designing striking modern buildings and complexes that retained a keen sense of regional individuality. He is responsible for the creation of some of the world's most iconic structures - not least the Louvre Pyramid in Paris, the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, and the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha - but his portfolio is vast, covering arts facilities, university buildings, civic centers, libraries, and hotels. The recipient of numerous international prizes and awards, the jury citation for perhaps the most prestigious of all, the Pritzker Prize (in 1983), summed up Pei's architecture as being \"characterized by its faith in modernism [and] humanized by its subtlety, lyricism, and beauty\".\n\nAccomplishments\n\nPerhaps Pei's most iconic structure remains his glass and steel Louvre Pyramid which, in the late 20th century, simultaneously revitalized Paris's Louvre Palace, and confirmed the French capital's reputation for innovation in modern architecture. Pei's entrance hub to the world's most visited art museum, which sees visitors travel through the Pyramid doors, down into an underground intersection of galleries that connects to the museum's main buildings, has become Pei's \"statement\" design.\n\nPei was greatly inspired by Cubism and took inspiration from the works of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Juan Gris. His skillful cuboid designs, most pronounced in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (Colorado), the Everson Museum (Syracuse), and the National Gallery's East Building (Washington DC), explored how exterior and interior spaces are brought to life by the balance of solids and voids, and the how the effects of natural light, accentuate these dynamics.\n\nPei's East Wing of the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC is considered a masterpiece of geometric precision. Conceived of as two triangles, it includes the key elements of Pei's design - the harmonizing of mass, volume, light, and materials. The East Wing's exterior harmonizes beautifully with the original gallery building (opened 37 years earlier) with marble sourced from the same Texas quarry. At the time of its completion, Pei cited the East Wing as his most accomplished work.\n\nPei is associated with the streamlined beauty of the International Style, so called because its spacious interiors, simple lines, and strict geometric forms, breached national, cultural (and political) borders. Yet Pei strongly advocated for contextual and regional variations to influence this High Modernist style. On a trip to his homeland in China in 1974, for instance, he appealed to architectural students to individualize their designs by embracing Chinese heritage rather than adhere slavishly to a style that, in 20th century China, was largely based on modernist Soviet designs.\n\nThe Life of I. M. Pei\n\nImportant Art by I. M. Pei\n\nBiography of I. M. Pei\n\nChildhood\n\nI. M. Pei was born Ieoh Ming Pei, in Canton (now Guangzhou), China. He was one of five children born into a family descended from the scholar-gentry class that dated back to the Ming dynasty. He was raised between Hong Kong and Suzhou, a city lying just to the west of Shanghai. His father, Tsuyee, was a banker and, for a time, Governor of the Central Bank of China; his mother, Lien Kwun, was an artist and an accomplished flautist. Ieoh Ming's name translates roughly as \"to make an indelible mark\" (a somewhat prophetic designation). As a child, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout Buddhist, and she often invited him (to the exclusion of his siblings) to accompany her on meditation retreats.\n\nYoung Pei took inspiration from his mother's interest in the arts (a passion not shared by his father), the lush gardens in and around their home in Suzhou, and from the diverse architecture found in and around nearby Shanghai (\"the Paris of the East\" as it was known). He was fascinated by the construction site of a twenty-five-story hotel, and said later, \"That's when I knew I wanted to build\". He attended St. Paul's College in Hong Kong, and St John's Middle School in Shanghai. At the latter, the study program, run by Anglican missionaries was severe, with only one half-day each month allowed for leisure pursuits. Pei used the time to play billiards, read the Bible and Charles Dickens novels (which helped him to gain a basic grasp of English), and watch Hollywood movies starring Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.\n\nSoon after Pei turned ten, his mother was diagnosed with cancer. He later recalled preparing the opium pipe that she had been prescribed to relieve her pain. She passed away just after his thirteenth birthday, and the loss affected him profoundly. With Pei's emotionally-distant father all consumed by his work, the five siblings were sent to live with extended family. (Pei's father later remarried and moved to New York, where he and his adult son would eventually reconnect.)\n\nEducation and Early Training\n\nIn 1935, Pei moved to the United States (traveling first by boat to San Francisco, and then by train to Philadelphia) to attend architecture school at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). Pei's decision to attend university in the U.S. was influenced by what he had seen in Hollywood films. He once said: \"college life in the U.S. seemed to me to be mostly fun and games. Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it. [Bing] Crosby's films in particular had a tremendous influence on my choosing the United States instead of England to pursue my education\".\n\nAt UPenn, Pei soon became dissatisfied with the program's heavy emphasis on the ornamental Beaux-Arts style. He duly transferred to the architectural engineering program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Although he found the curriculum just as old-fashioned, a professor, who recognized Pei's latent talents, persuaded him to persevere with his studies. He later stated \"I certainly don't regret the time at MIT. There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture [as the style]\". He spent much of his downtime in the school's library, reading about modern architects, like Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright. In fact Le Corbusier visited MIT in 1935, and Pei had the good fortune to spend two study days with him, later calling them \"the most important days in [my] architectural education\".\n\nPei graduated in 1939, with his thesis titled \"Standardized Propaganda Units for War Time and Peace Time China\". His graduation coincided with the outbreak of WWII, and the second Sino-Japanese War (1937-45), and his father advised him against returning home. During the war, Pie became attached to a unit at the National Defense Research Committee that specialized in fusing bombs. As he explained, \"They figured if you knew how to build buildings, you knew how to destroy them\". During this period, Pei met Eileen Loo, also from a prominent Chinese family, and an art major at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. They married shortly after her graduation in 1942.\n\nBetween 1945 to 1948 Pei worked as an assistant professor at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard. He was also enrolled on Harvard's Graduate School of Design (GSD), where he studied under the German Modernist architect, and founder of the world-famous Bauhaus School, Walter Gropius. He noted with surprise that the student cohort was not particularly diverse, commenting, \"It was me, a Chinese national, and the ladies\". One of Pei's design projects was for an art museum in Shanghai, for which he aimed to blend Chinese aesthetics with non-traditional materials or styles. Gropius called it \"the best thing done in [my] master class\". Pei earned his MArch (advanced architecture degree) in 1946.\n\nIn 1948, Pei was recruited by real estate developer William Zeckendorf as director of the architectural division of his New York firm, Webb & Knapp. Projects Pei was involved in included the Mile High Center (1955) in Denver, the Hyde Park Redevelopment (1959) in Chicago, and the Place Ville-Marie (1965) in Montreal. The architectural critic, Paul Goldberger, writes, \"Mr. Pei, refined and genteel, could not have been more different on the surface from the brash Zeckendorf. But the men shared a bold ambition, a love of French wine and a belief that architecture could improve cities\". Pei later commented that while working on these urban projects, \"I learned the process of development, and about the city as a living organism\".\n\nIn New York, Pei, his wife, and their two young sons, moved into an apartment on Beekman Place in Manhattan. His first design to come to full fruition was for a two-story corporate building for Gulf Oil in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1949. Though it was demolished in February 2013 (save for the facade, incorporated into the apartment complex later built at the site), his design was well-received on its construction, with Architectural Forum praising Pei's use of marble for the exterior curtain wall. Says Goldberger, \"the Zeckendorf years were a heady beginning for Mr. Pei's career\" and he soon brought his former student, Henry Cobb, onto his team, as well as the young Ulrich Franzen.\n\nIn 1954, Pei became a U.S. citizen. He started his own division, I. M. Pei & Associates, through which he began receiving commissions, such as the Luce Memorial Chapel in Taiwan, the Green Earth Sciences building at M.I.T., and a type of pentagonal control tower design for the Federal Aviation Agency (a design that was adopted by many other American airports). In 1960, Zeckendorf's firm began to have serious financial troubles. Pei opted to finally sever ties with the Zeckendorf practice altogether, launching his own firm, I. M. Pei & Partners, in 1966.\n\nMature Period\n\nIn the late 1960s, Pei was approached to lead a number of ambitious urban redevelopment projects. One of these, known as the Pei Plan, was for downtown Oklahoma City. Architectural critic Mark Byrnes writes, \"Pei gave the Urban Action Foundation - a group of Oklahoma City power brokers - the city of tomorrow that they wanted. Gone would be the blighted older buildings and their modest, even unsavory, tenants. In their place would be soaring modern skyscrapers, a massive new convention center, and postcard-worthy public spaces, all filled up with productive, affluent locals and tourists\". The city approved the Pei Plan in 1965, and set about demolishing 40 percent of the existing downtown (a total of 530 buildings including the historic Criterion Theater, the Mercantile and Pioneer buildings, and the limestone-and-marble Hales Building). Byrnes writes, \"Even buildings not targeted under the Pei Plan were demolished, including the Lee-Huckins and the Biltmore hotels. But as the region sprawled [...] the retail and residential dreams from the Pei Plan never came to be\".\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s, Providence, Rhode Island, commissioned Pei to redesign Cathedral Square, and his new plaza opened there in 1972. However, a lack of city funds, as well as problems caused by rival building developments in the surrounding area, led to the plaza being labelled a \"conspicuous failure\" by the local media. However, a similar project led by Pei to revitalize downtown Augusta, Georgia, in the mid-1970s proved more successful.\n\nPei was experiencing mixed fortunes at this stage in his career. The John Hancock Tower, at Copley Square in Boston was, when opened in 1976, the tallest building in New England. However, even during construction serious problems presented themselves. The building's facade was covered entirely in large reflective glass panels. But many of these fractured and crashed to the ground during a 1973 windstorm. Pei's team switched to smaller panels in order to correct the problem. This change incurred significant additional costs and led to conflicts between Hancock, I. M. Pei & Partners, and the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, with several lawsuits and counter lawsuits issued by the warring parties. Following the Hancock Tower debacle (which pained Pei so greatly he refused to comment on it for several years), I. M. Pei & Partners saw a sharp dip in new commissions. Pei feared for a time that the practice may even have to close. But, as he later explained, \"going through this trial toughened us. It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other\".\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Pei returned to China for the first time since 1935. He undertook some design commissions, and presented a series of lectures in which he called upon Chinese architects to look to their country's tradition for inspiration rather than simply emulate international trends. Goldberger explains that in China, Pei \"did not hesitate to criticize the banal, Soviet-influenced architecture that he saw, and he gave a talk in which he urged the Chinese to look back at their own traditions rather than 'slavishly following Eastern European patterns'\".\n\n1978 saw the doors open to the National Gallery East Building in Washington DC. A new home for the museums expanding collection of modern and contemporary art, Pei's design (chosen from 150 blueprints and models) harmonized with John Russell Pope's classicized West Building, (completed in 1941). It was a \"return to form\" for Pei, with the American architect Allan Greenberg, having been vocal in his criticism of early designs, declaring: \"I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece\". He followed in 1979 with another masterpiece, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, at Columbia Point Peninsula, overlooking the entrance to Boston Harbor. Standing as a tribute to the memory of the assassinated president, the library consists of a nine-story concrete tower which is adjoined to a glass-and-steel pavilion. Speaking of the pavilion, Pei said, \"Its openness is the essence [...] in the reflective mood that the architecture seeks to engender [visitors] may find themselves thinking of John F. Kennedy in a different way. In the skyline of his city, in the distant horizons toward which he led us, in the canopy of space into which he launched us, visitors may experience revived hope and promise for the future\".\n\nPei was awarded the Gold Medal from the American Institute of Architects (AIA), also in 1979, and confirmation of his rising star followed in 1983 when receiving the Pritzker Prize (known within the industry as the \"Nobel Prize of architecture\"). The jury citation for the Pritzker read: \"Pei has given this century some of its most beautiful interior spaces and exterior forms [...] His versatility and skill in the use of materials approach the level of poetry\". Pei used the prize money to establish a scholarship fund for Chinese students to study architecture in the United States with the stipulation they return to China to work.\n\nPei's reputation was briefly dented with the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City (1986) which was plagued by spiraling budget costs, administrative red tape, and construction problems. He and his team soldiered on, however, and soon found success in other projects. The most notable of these was the Louvre Pyramid (1989), a strikingly modern glass-and-metal structure situated in the main courtyard of the Louvre Palace in Paris. The main entrance to the world's most visited art museum, the Pyramid has since become a Parisian landmark. Also in 1989, Pei was the inaugural recipient of the Praemium Imperiale for Architecture, awarded by the Japan Art Association. Other successful commissions from this period included the Meyerson Symphony Center (1989), a facility in downtown Dallas, Texas, for cultural activities and events, and the home of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, and The Gateway (1990), a soaring crystalline twin tower office complex that graces the Singapore skyline.\n\nLabelling 1989 \"the year of Pei\", Goldberger notes that \"As his firm grew in size and prestige - it would eventually employ 300 people - Mr. Pei seemed to become the quintessential New Yorker. He and his wife and family, which grew to include three sons and a daughter, moved to a townhouse on Sutton Place, facing the East River, where he remained for the rest of his life. He became an avid collector of postwar American art, and his townhouse contained works by Morris Louis, Jean Dubuffet, and Willem de Kooning; he also designed a weekend house for his family in Katonah, N.Y., in Westchester County, where he installed a 16-foot-high sculpture by [English abstract sculptor] Anthony Caro\".\n\nLate Period and Death\n\nIn 1990, Pei retired from full-time practice at his firm (renamed, Pei Cobb Freed & Partners) but remained involved in several prestige projects. He also continued to consult for the firm established by his sons, Li Chung and Chien Chung, Pei Partnership Architects.\n\nPei undertook a number of important projects following his semi-retirement, many of them museums. In 1997, for example, he was approached by Japanese textile heiress Mihoko Koyama, and founder of the religious organization, Shinji Shumeikai, to design the Miho Museum in the city of KÅka (on the outskirts of Kyoto). The museum was to house hundreds of Asian and Western antiques, many of which relate to the history of the Silk Road (the name given to an expansive trade network connecting Eurasia and North Africa, via land and sea, lasting from around 114 BCE to 1450s CE, and which took its name from Chinese silk, a highly valued luxury commodity), as well as the Shinji Shumeikai headquarters. Pei's design included a suspension bridge leading to a circular entrance cut into the side of the mountain. Once inside the museum, visitors find themselves in a space illuminated by natural light via a glass roof, offset with a calming beige limestone wall. Pei's other late projects included an extension to the Deutsches Historisches Museum in Berlin (2003), the MusÃ©e d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean in Luxembourg (2006), the Suzhou Museum in China (2006), the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar (2008), and the Macao Science Center in China (2009).\n\nIn 2003, Pei accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, but any happiness he would have felt at this latest distinction was dampened with the news that his eldest son, T'ing Chung, died after a prolonged illness. In 2010 his achievements were recognized again when he was honored with the Royal Institute of British Architects' Gold Medal. Pei's wife, Eileen, passed away in 2014, and the following year, a physical altercation with a home health aide led to Pei being briefly hospitalized (and a legal action to which the aide pleaded guilty).\n\nOn April 26, 2017, Pei celebrated his 100th birthday, at the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller Center, in the company of several of the world's leading architects. The birthday cake was designed in the shape of one of his final projects, the Museum of Islamic Art. Pei passed away in his Manhattan apartment on May 16, 2019. He was survived by three adult children, seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.\n\nThe Legacy of I. M. Pei\n\nReferred to by the architectural writer Christopher Turner as \"the last surviving modernist\", Pei's buildings, from the Mesa Laboratory in Colorado; to the Louvre Pyramid in Paris; to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, have enriched the faÃ§ade of many cities around the globe. A modernist he may have been, but Pei never lost sight of the need to respect local cultures and traditions. As architectural critic Paul Goldberger writes, \"all of his work - from his commercial skyscrapers to his art museums - represented a careful balance of the cutting edge and the conservative. Mr. Pei remained a committed modernist, and while none of his buildings could ever be called old-fashioned or traditional, his particular brand of modernism - clean, reserved, sharp-edged and unapologetic in its use of simple geometries and its aspirations to monumentality - sometimes seemed to be a throwback, at least when compared with the latest architectural trends\".\n\nAnother of the so-called \"starchitects\", the Spaniard Santiago Calatrava, said of his contemporary, \"I saw him as an architect who carried the baton of modern architecture from one generation to the next, and the message he carried was heard all over the world. His architecture confronted the modern with the classic in an iconic fashion, and through these gestures he elevated a generation of architectural accomplishment to rival that of past masters in a way that many of his contemporaries could not\". Indeed, his vision has been passed on to emerging architects, such as his compatriot Li Xioadong, who viewed Pei as \"a true master of accommodating a complicated program with simple and clear form\". The eminent British architect, Lord Norman Foster, said on his friend's passing, \"[he] shaped contemporary practice in a major way [leaving] behind a formidable legacy that will continue to influence architects and designers for decades to come\".\n\nInfluences and Connections\n\nUseful Resources on I.
