M. Pei and William Zeckendorf and their twelve-year partnership in urban renewal. William Zeckendorf (1905-1976) was the most ambitious real estate developer in the United States in the 1950s, with an outsize personality and larger-than-life plans. Unlike most developers of the era, Zeckendorf believed that quality design and visionary planning were critical to remaking city cores through urban renewal. To accomplish this, he hired I. M. Pei (b. 1917), a talented, young designer out of Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, creating a scenario that fundamentally changed the traditional working relationship between developer and architect. In 1948, Pei joined Zeckendorf as the in-house architect of Webb & Knapp, and together, they became the most active urban renewal developer and architect in the country. Webb & Knapp’s urban empire stretched coast to coast, remaking huge swaths of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Washington, DC, through federally funded urban renewal. It also developed privately funded urban renewal schemes in Denver, Los Angeles, and Montreal. Yet despite this tremendous volume of influential executed works in urban planning and design, this untold history has fallen prey to sweeping, simplistic condemnations of urban renewal as a “failed policy.” Zeckendorf and Pei provided an alternative and effective model for real estate development and design practice within the context of the most aggressive city-rebuilding programs in the history of the United States. This study raises serious questions about practice and the history of urban architecture and modernism, which all too often privileges information about “architect-creators” to the exclusion of such important other actors as real estate developers. The pathbreaking and successful collaboration between this visionary developer and a talented, young architect offers a more nuanced—and more accurate—evaluation of urban redevelopment strategies in the United States than previous critiques.

The nature of the Zeckendorf-Pei collaboration was unprecedented, but the results were not without controversy. Pei and Zeckendorf’s unique twelve-year partnership and their urban renewal work broke design and planning barriers. Together, developer and architect skillfully played their parts in a powerful public-private collaboration that altered the American city and redefined how Americans thought about urbanism."
