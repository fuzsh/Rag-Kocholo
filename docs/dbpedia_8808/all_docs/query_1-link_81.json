        "text": "‘TO BE ignorant of what occurred before you were born is to remain always a child,” said Cicero.\n\nOnce upon a time, a man named William Zeckendorf was a king in New York. (We’re not talking his grandsons, William, Lee and Arthur. Today, they own the incredible 15 Central Park West.) We’re talking their grandfather. Among other things, he owned the entire block at 383/385 Madison Ave. (Mr. Zeckendorf “discovered” the famed architect I.M. Pei at a very young age, and Pei, now 91, designed the Zeckendorf round penthouse that sat atop the 383 building.)\n\nZeckendorf was a man with true vision. He developed Lincoln Center in NYC, Century City in LA and changed the face of Montreal. One of his greatest accomplishments was selling the land where the UN now stands to the Rockefellers who gave it to the world. (It had been New York’s former meatpacking district – as hard as that is to imagine.) But 383 was his special baby. Incredibly, he did go bust in 1968, so that 383 Madison stood empty until Bear Stearns bought it, tore it down and built a spectacular skyscraper at that address.\n\nNow Bear Stearns has gone bust. A lot of New Yorkers speculate that 383 is a jinxed block, but JPMorgan Chase will soon move there, coming up from Wall Street. And history moves on.\n\nFLASH! from Hollywood. (Well, at least it’s a little light-bulb pop.) That hot couple – football’s Tom Brady and model Gisele Bundchen. Are they formally and actually engaged? Gisele stopped into LA’s Billion Dollar Brows salon for some grooming. (Never underestimate the power of the dynamic brow.)\n\nOne of the attendants noticed a really big diamond on her left hand. “Tom bought it for me at Tiffany’s!” Gisele announced when complimented on its dazzling size. “But I can’t wear it much around here. They are always at you.” She meant the pack rats of the paparazzi.\n\nIs this couple about to be wed? Sometimes a ring is just a ring, but meantime, Gisele is very well blinged.\n\nSUMMER 2008 will see two highly an ticipated stadium tours – the relent less Madonna and the rather reclusive George Michael, who has had his knocks but keeps on keeping on. George performed 80 shows in Europe last year. He wasn’t sure he wanted to do America, but the success of “25Live” concerts made up his mind. This will be the singer’s first US tour in 17 years. Of course, there’s a new two-disc CD and a DVD of 40 videos to promote. The 20-city tour kicks off in June in San Diego. He’ll play Madison Square Garden in July.\n\nTOMORROW night, the Film Society of Lincoln Center will be paying tribute to one of the finest acting stars of our modern movie age. (This one isn’t half-dead and too creaky to get on stage either!)\n\nMeryl Streep will be saluted by many people who are almost as famous as she is, and I can hardly wait to see the rundown of her famed movie roles, including my all-time favorite, “The Devil Wears Prada.”\n\nOnce again, I will hope to see Meryl admonishing Anne Hathaway by saying, “Don’t be ridiculous, everybody wants to be us!”\n\nThis is a fabulous truth-saying moment in modern film – Anne downgrades her glamorous life, goes back to her irritating selfish beau and envious friends and gives up things like going to Paris, wearing clothes from the collections and absorbing power in a job at the top.\n\nIt’s a great life lesson in a movie. So brava to Meryl, who makes every single thing she does seem oh-so-real!\n\nTHE INSIDE story of the flacks of “Young Frankenstein” is that they are fighting back against those who say this Mel Brooks project has been a “disappointment.” Here’s their take. “The musical at the Hilton Theatre grossed an astounding $1.5 million recently. Exit polls of audiences,” say the mavens of the two producers, Bob Sillerman and Brooks, “have shown the highest level of satisfaction of any show surveyed – an amazing 90 percent.”\n\nHmmm, that’s even higher than the 88 percent who simply adored the Brooks classic, “The Producers,” at the height of its amazing popularity.\n\nSo why don’t the “Young Frankenstein” backers take out some big ads, saying all this? They’re shy, those guys, I guess. Their reps say they don’t want to brag.\n\nTHERE HAVE been some interesting villains in the James Bond movies through the years – Christopher Walken, Jonathan Pryce, Max von Sydow, Telly Savalas, Louis Jordan, Lotte Lenya. But the next big bad guy to confront Daniel Craig‘s 007 will be an actor who remained motionless in his last acclaimed movie.\n\nHe is Mathieu Amalric, who starred in “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.” There seems to be an intellectual approach to this next Bond film. Says Matheiu: ” ‘Casino Royale’ tried to speak about the world we are in and also a broken heart, and I think the new film is also looking for a realistic approach, as well as the myth and the fantasy.”\n\nOh, forget all that. Bring back the dry martinis, the exploding cars, the flights through the air and the slam-dunk explosions. Let Amalric come to a brutal, satisfying end just like all the others who dared confront our hero."
