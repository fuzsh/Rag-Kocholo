        "text": "Although she did not come out and say it, some 35 years after she began writing the first draft of The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961), Jane Jacobs alluded to the particular influence of the British Townscape movement on her canonical and subversive book, and on the broader direction of US city planning and design theory. Reflecting on her book’s impact on students of architecture and city planning in the foreword to the 1993 Modern Library edition of Death and Life, Jacobs wrote that “their subversion was by no means all my doing. Other authors and researchers - notably William H. Whyte - were also exposing the unworkability and joylessness of anti-city visions. In London, editors and writers of The Architectural Review were already up to the same thing in the mid-1950s”. As observed in the following pages, Jacobs’s two modest lines were the briefest summary of a history of ambitions, influences, and collaborations between British and American architectural critics that unfolded in the 1950s, reshaping American architectural criticism, helping to define the new field of urban design, and motivating Jacobs’s own influential work. This article is a short, edited excerpt from my 2009 doctoral dissertation.\n\nHélène Jannière (Université Rennes 2) and Paolo Scrivano (Politecnico di Milano), scientific coordinators of the Mapping Architectural Criticism network, are guest editing the next issue of HPA – Histories of Postwar Architecture. A call for papers has been launched on the topic Committed, Politicized, or Operative: Figures of Engagement in Criticism from 1945 to Today. Deadline for paper submission: July 31, 2020 Please find more information below Hélène Jannière (Université Rennes 2) et Paolo Scrivano (Politecnico di Milano), coordinateurs scientifiques du réseau Mapping Architectural Criticism, sont les rédacteurs invités du prochain numéro de HPA – Histories of Postwar Architecture. Un appel à contribution a été lancé sur le sujet Committed, Politicized, or Operative: Figures of Engagement in Criticism from 1945 to Today. Date limite pour l'envoi des propositions: 31 juillet, 2020 Veuillez trouver plus d'informations ci-dessous ---- Presentation In a 1995 article on the renewal of architectural criticism, French architect and critic Bernard Huet referred to Charles Baudelaire to define art criticism as necessarily – in the poet’s words – “partial, impassionate, political”. During the 1990s, perhaps as a reaction to the 1980s, when in many specialized publications architectural criticism was identified as “communication” or even as promotion of architects and architectures, it emerged an extensive nostalgia for a notion of criticism associated to the historical avant-gardes. In this “committed” criticism or in the “politicized” one it was possible to emphasize the critic’s influential and active role in discovering, promoting, and intellectually supporting groups of artists or architects. The idea of a “golden age” of criticism has thus spread, being from time to time related to the end of the 19th century, to the 1920s, and to the 1960s and 1970s. This issue of HPA intends to collect studies devoted to historical examples of “committed” and “politicized” criticism, reflecting on the real meanings of these concepts and on the themes and subjects to which they are tied. On the one hand, the figure of “committed” critic might be linked to the art and architecture avant-gardes from the end of the 19th century onward, hence defining a privileged relationship between critic and artist/architect; on the other, “politicized” criticism can be characterized as the understanding in political terms of architectural and city phenomena. Among the questions the issue wants to address are: in which way do these definitions of “committed” and “politicized” criticism come close to or differ from the definition of “operative” criticism, in the various meanings that have been attributed to it since Manfredo Tafuri? What are the theoretical tools, the rhetorical constructions, and the intellectual and political references of “committed” and “politicized” criticism? Should the latter be necessarily bound to the author’s belonging to a party or political group? What are their principal ways of circulation (specialized periodicals, journals, targeted actions)? In which measure did “politicized” criticism influence architecture’s historical narrative? And finally, what are the interlacements and the convergences between criticism’s intellectual and artistic engagement and the political commitment? The issue of HPA intends to include contributions dealing with specific case studies or themes, with a periodization that spans from the end of the Second World War to the present date. Guidelines and deadlines Please find the complete guidelines and deadlines for the submission in the pdf attached. About HPA HPA – Histories of Postwar Architecture is a biannual open-access peer-reviewed Journal that aims to publish innovative and original papers on post-war architecture, with no geographical, methodological, historiographical or disciplinary restrictions.

No author makes Chicago the absolute starting point for modernity in general. Either the rupture is placed earlier; or Chicago's architecture crystallizes trends that appeared earlier; or it is only one phenomenon among others of the emergence of modern architecture. From this point of view, the idea that Chicago would be the place par excellence where modern architecture appeared, the idea that the invention of a radically new architectural structure would be seen there by its effects, this idea is part of the myth constructed a posteriori. In spite of the lack of theoretical consensus, the above-mentioned historians agree that something important happened in Chicago at the end of the 19th century. This is no longer a general historical break, but rather a set of significant breaks within a broader evolution: 1st Economic break, first of all, on which Giedion and Francastel agree. 2nd Technical break: emergence of the great metropolis and its urban problems. 4th Rupture of typology: the skyscraper and vertical architecture. 5th Doctrinal rupture: the bias of structural clarity. 6th Cultural rupture: the anthropomorphic character of Sullivan's architecture. So there are several levels of rupture that converge to make Chicago at this time a typical place of modernity. Chicago the load-bearing steel framework. 3rd Rupture of scale: is, in all probability, one of the origins of American Modernity, insofar as economic, ideological, social and constructive problems characteristic of contemporary America were posed with acuity and largely temporarily resolved. These solutions to the problems essentially concern the invention of an unprecedented typology, namely the tertiary work building and the way in which its relationship with a rapidly expanding city was thought out. The skyscraper as an unprecedented architectural structure inscribes Chicago in the problematic of modernity, whatever the content given to this word.\n\nThe fields of professional architecture and mass-market homebuilding have stood in opposition to one another since the nineteenth century in the United States. Boundaries between the two, however, were always permeable. This article explores an overlooked chapter in this dialogue: three architects who worked, in part, as developers of multifamily housing in the fifteen years after World War II, Vernon DeMars in the San Francisco Bay Area, Brown & Guenther in New York City, and Erwin Gerber in suburban New Jersey. Each followed a distinct path to design-develop and was motivated by a different set of concerns, from financial profit to the desire to advance professional values like high-quality design. All were enabled by the postwar welfare state that while encouraging homogeneity through the large-scale production of generic houses also empowered small-scale actors, including architects, to build alternatives. In employing policy toward this end, designers-as-developers generated opportunities to move beyond the incremental give-and-take of patron and client to better control production, injecting creativity, variety, and innovation into American housing. Their example highlights the complexity of midcentury housing policy and real-estate practice and reveals new ways in which these forces helped determine the shape of the U.S. built environment."
