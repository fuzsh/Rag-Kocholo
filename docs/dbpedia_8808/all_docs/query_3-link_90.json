        "text": "In 2012, the writers and curators Sam Lubell and Greg Goldin were shown a few models of buildings that were never built. While unremarkable in themselves, the models, sitting in a warehouse on the outskirts of Los Angeles, “gave us the kernel of an idea to look at unbuilt architecture,” Goldin says.\n\nSoon after, Lubell and Goldin curated Never Built Los Angeles, a show at LA’s A+D Museum. They followed a few years later with a show at New York’s Queens Museum, Never Built New York. In each instance, the duo used buildings that were never realized to help explain why our architecture looks and functions as it does today."
