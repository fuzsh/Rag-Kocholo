        "text": "1. M. Pei is pacing his living room floor, and he talking about the state of architecture. “It is Louis Kahn whom I admire most,” he is saying. “He will stand the test of time — there is a spirit, a sense being in a very special place in his buildings. From him I learned that it is not just a concept, but the way that concept is executed that is important. His is the architecture of ideas, and I worry that ideas and professional practice do not intersect enough.” He pauses, then adds: “Maybe my early training set me back. Maybe it made me too much of a pragmatist.”\n\nThat is an unexpected comment from a man like Pei, who runs an architectural office that employs 160 people and numbers among its clients major corporations, real‐estate developers and cultural institutions around the world. I. M. Pei questioning the value of pragmatism might seem like Morgan Guaranty Trust Company doubting fiscal conservatism. Yet I. M. Pei & Partners is more than a commercial architectural firm. Its work has always tried merge serious esthetic ideas with a certain professional business sense, and today it is probably the leader among the few architectural practices in the United States that manage to make a mark both esthetically and commercially. It is hard enough in the competitive world of architectural practice to create a sharp public image in either the category of art or the category of business; to do so in both is remarkable.\n\nAt the moment, I. M. Pei's star clear in the firmament for a good two decades by now — is rising higher than ever. He has just been named architect of the New York Convention and Exhibition Center, the $375‐million project in midtown Manhattan that was the most sought‐after architectural commission New York has handed out in years. His drawing boards are full of work from Singapore to Park Avenue, and this fall he will see the John F. Kennedy Library in Dorchester, Mass., a project that has eluded completion for 15 frustrating years, open its doors at last. He is doing a hotel outside Peking, his first building in his native China and the first building by any American architect to get under way there since relations were normalized between Washington and Peking. And next month Pei will receive the gold medal of the American Institute of Architects — the highest award the professional society gives to any architect in the world.\n\nIt is a long way to have come since the early 1970's, when I. M. Pei & Partners meant only one thing in the public's mind: the John Hancock Tower, the 60‐story skyscraper in Boston whose double‐paned glass windows mysteriously fell out. Pei's reputation was as shattered as the building, and clients stayed away in such numbers that the firm, which by then was already established in the front rank of American architectural practices. began to fear for its very survival. The glass problem was solved by the replacement of double‐layered glass with single‐layered, but litigation to assess blame and damages — in what is generally considered to be the most complex architectural liability case in history—is still proceeding. Pei is certain that the fault lies with the glass company, which he has sued, and apparently clients believe he is correct. For now he is as busy as ever; indeed, he is doing a skyscraper even bigger than Hancock for a developer who had insisted, during the glass troubles, that nothing could ever make him hire I. M. Pei. and thoughtful of all of American architecture's elder statesmen today. If he lacks Philip Johnson's verbal and architectural flamboyance, or Kevin Roche's painstaking inventiveness, he has a sense of quiet dedication to certain architectural constants which the other two lack. His work is conservative in the highest sense: he believes in refining and evolving, not in newness for its own sake, and yet he is far too committed to the world of ideas ever to be called reactionary.\n\nPei's approach has won him few friends in academic architectural circles. It is not Pei whose work gets debated in the cloistered atmosphere of the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in New York or the Architectural Association in London, for example. But with the Hancock stigma gone, corporate clients flock to Pei. They feel he can deliver a building that will impress but not shock their visitors, employees and customers. Pei would never produce something as startling as Philip Johnson and John Burgee's American Telephone and Telegraph Company headquarters, the granite skyscraper with classical details and a pedimented top about to rise on Madison Avenue; but he would never produce anything as conventional as the I rest of Madison Avenue, either. Similarly, institutional clients such as art museums look to the Pei firm for a kind of strong, yet discreet, modern design; something that will make a statement of quality in\n\nSeveral Pei museums have received significant public acclaim, from the Everson in ‘ Syracuse of MS to the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. This marble palace opened last year to such fanfare that it can surely be said to have played a major role in and of itself in the recent surge of interest in 1. M. Pei.\n\nBy now, I. M. Pei & Partners is in a position in this country not unlike that of McKim, Mead & White at the beginning of this century. The firm of Charles F. McKim, William Mead and Stanford White\n\nproduced classically inspired buildings of remarkably high\n\nquality for corporations and\n\ninstitutions, and while they were not at the cutting edge of\n\nthe avant‐garde, that hardly\n\nmattered. Their work was so much better than that of most\n\nof their competitors that they were able to bring quality architecture to a far broader public than ever saw the designs of those architects more concerned with pure innovation.\n\nSo it is with I. M. Pei. Today, the abstract, geometric forms of Pei's modernism are the conservative style, not unlike the neo‐Renaissance buildings favored by the McKim firm in its time. And as McKim, Mead & White played a large role in popularizing the classical revival of their era, so Pei has been a leader and not just a follower. His own variations on modernist themes in buildings such as Hancock, the National Gallery, Kips Bay Plaza housing in New York and Society Hill in Philadelphia are among the most studied and discussed buildings of the last 20 years.\n\nPei has generally ignored the current trend toward eclectic architecture, toward a return to ornament and historical style that motivated a design such as A.T.&T. He is too diplomatic to say anything critical of his friend Philip Johnson, who won the gold medal last year, but it is clear that the A.T.& T. building's heavy borrowings of classical detail and odd scale disturb his sense of purity. Pei never took the orthodox modernist view that a building was nothing but a pure, abstract object as complete gospel, as Johnson once did, and thus he has never felt the need to rebel against it with such vehemence.\n\nBut the currents of the late 1970's are reaching I. M. Pei nonetheless, and in no job more than his hotel for Peking. It is a very special assignment for Pei. He was born in China in 1917, the son of a prominent banking family, and while he now calls himself “an American architect — absolutely,” his emotional ties to China run deep. He had not been in China between 1935 and 1974, when he returned to lead a delegation of visiting American architects — although he had gone as far as Taiwan to design a rather expressionistic, swooping chapel for the Henry R. Luce Foundation in 1963. He returned to the mainland in 1979 at the request of hotel builders intent on accommodating China's expected tourist boom.\n\nPei, whose reputation has\n\nbeen founded in large part on the building of skyscrapers,\n\nfound himself less than en-\n\ntranced with the idea of erecting large‐scale buildings in\n\nhistoric Peking. “I raised the\n\nquestion of what all of this would do to Peking, which is\n\nessentially a one‐story city,” he said not long ago in New York. “To build 20- or 30‐story buildings would destroy the city. I heard that there was talk of demolishing part of Pe king to make way for new construction, and I expressed my horror. I told them that Peking was an artifact, and that you could not destroy a part without destroying the whole.”\n\nThe suggestions of distinguished visitors to Peking may not be followed, but they do not go unheard, and last Christmas Pei found himself invited back with his entire family to advise the Chinese on planning policy. He repeated his concerns, and was asked if he himself would consider taking on design work in China. He offered to try his hand at one project — something small with which he might feel his way — and was soon asked to design a 300‐room hotel in a resort area 25 miles from the center of Peking.\n\nIt is a project so small that all of its rooms together would barely fill a fraction of the space of the planned New York Convention Center, but it has virtually obsessed Pei all this spring. He sees it as a test both of the Chinese Government's willingness to do modest and practical projects that are appropriate to China's role as a still‐developing country, and of his own ability to evolve an architectural solution that will be sympathetic with China's traditions.\n\nFor the first time, Pei is not turning to the modernist vocabulary of concrete or steel and gloss as a starting point. The hotel will be of brick and white‐painted stucco, with tile used as well. As designed, it neither resembles traditional Chinese architecture nor modern Western architecture, but attempts to evolve “a bridge, a new vocabulary that will be something between the Chinese culture and the West,” Pei says. “Now, there seem to be two approaches — either to use imitative old‐style architecture with red columns and golden roofs, as they have done in Taiwan, or to take over the West, to build modern Western buildings on the assumption that hotels are for foreigners and that's what they are used to. I think neither of these is right. There has to be a third way.”’\n\nPei's “third way” will make one dramatic break with traditional Chinese architecture: it will have a flat roof rather than a roof upturned at the edges, which Pei considers “difficult, costly, and the first thing to collapse in an earthquake.” But the rest of the design relates strongly to the traditional Chinese design vernacular. The materials are conventional ones, not alien to the older Chinese architectural styles. The building is a series of low wings arranged\n\naround a set of courtyards. It will have Chinese gardens, and the windows will be very much in the Chinese tradition of acting as a picture frame.\n\nWindows in crucial parts of the building, such as the ends of corridors, are placed not only so as to let in light, but also to frame and define carefully composed views.\n\n“I have never done anything like this before,” said Pei last month, just before he left New York to present the project to the Chinese. “They will build it right from a model, and they say they will do it in less than a year.”\n\nThe model was barely finished when Pei took off for Peking in mid‐April. It had to follow him a few days later, because a few details were still not complete. But the presentation was a success: the Peking municipal authorities, who oversee the resort area, known as “Fragrant Hill,” where the hotel is to be placed, accepted the project and set a groundbreaking date for this September. It is one of the few Chinese hotel projects which involves a Western firm now considered certain to go ahead. Many of the more elaborate ones have been postponed for of\n\nWill Pei's design approach make sense? “I think so,” said James I. Freed, one of Pei's associate partners. “1 saw the disaster that unbridled, Western‐style development created in Teheran, and what I. M. is trying to do is advise the Chinese that they have to do it some other way.” He conceded that the hotel marked a departure from the firm's usual “ reduct ion ist “ work.\n\n“I think it's good; an important departure for this office,” said a young staff architect, who asked to remain anonymous. “But I do sometimes wonder if it is what a developing country wants. It may be that they are asking for roast beef and we are giving them chop suet'.”\n\nIn some ways Pei faces similar problems on the convent ion center for New York City. There is no technological backwardness this time, and 12th Avenue and 34th Street could not be more different from a rolling hill outside Peking. But once again, cost restraints are crucial. Indeed, cost limitations in New York may be even tighter than those imposed by the Chinese Government. The convention center is budgeted at $203 million (cost of land acquisition, demolition, financing and architects’ fees bring this to a total of $375 million) and, for political reasons, it is not likely that there will be any mom to stretch this figure at\n\nMoreover, the program of the convention center calls for 1.8 million square feet, an amount of space so vast it is equal to that in a 50‐story building, yet it will have to be all spread out. The kind of shape this logically yields is a huge box — and the challenge facing Pei and James Freed, who will oversee the convention‐center job on a day-to-day basis, is to find a way to make that box visually lively and attractive, and to break down its scale so that it does not appear to be a huge, oppressive mass.\n\nPei and Freed plan to do this by creating a set of public spaces that will remain active between conventions, so that the center becomes a tourist attraction all year round, “and not just a grim and forbidding box, the way every other convention center in the country is,” in Freed's words. So far there is no actual design. The architects only received the commission in April, beating out such competition as Johnson/ Burgee Architects and a team of the well‐known New York firms of Gruzen & Partners and Davis, Brody & Associates. Design work is just now beginning; there will be a tentative basic scheme by the end of the summer, and the building is due to be finished in\n\n1.M. Pei is said to have been so eager to do the convention center that — even before the commission was final or the enabling legislation for the project had been passed — he turned down an earlier offer to do the headquarters of the American Stock Exchange, like the convention center a project of the New York State Urban Development Corporation. He would not have been permitted to undertake both U.D.C. projects at the same time, and he preferred to gamble on the likelihood that the larger one would ahead.\n\nHe wanted to do so, but not because there would be more money involved in the larger project. He says he doubts very much that there will be any profit at all in the $6 million fee he must use to pay engineers, assorted consultants, and the 25 architects he will employ on the project at the peak of activity. Pei saw the convention center as a chance to make a major civic contribution to New York, a city in which he has lived and practiced since 1948, but in which he has built only a handful of\n\nTeoh Ming Pei came to the United States in 1935, intending to study architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and then return to China to practice there. He did neither. Worried that he could not draw well enough to succeed at Penn's heavily Beaux‐Arts oriented curriculum, he ended up studying architectural engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology instead. Then the outbreak of World War II, followed by the revolution in China, kept him in the United States. By the late 194(1's he had decided to seek American citizenship and remain here permanently.\n\nHe spent the war years in Princeton working for the National Defense Research Committee, and in 1942 married Eileen Loo, a Chinese student who was graduated that year from Wellesley College. They bad been seeing each other since her arrival in the United States as a freshman in 1938 when, at the urging of a mutual friend, Pei met heti rain at Grand Central Terminal. He offered to drive her to Boston hut, concerned about the propriety of taking a trip with a man she barely knew,\n\nThe Pets returned to Boston after the war, when Pei — having trouble finding employ. ment as an architect — accepted a position teaching at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard. There he joined a zealous, vibrant community of architects centered around Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, refugees from the Bauhaus, whose modernist thinking set Pei's basic design directions.\n\nPei's work caught the eye of the visionary real‐estate developer William Zeckendorf, who — in a gesture almost without precedent in American architecture launched him in practice as the staff architect of his firm, Webb & Knapp. Zeckendorf brought the Peis to New York in 1948, set Pei up in his Madison Avenue office and gave his family an apartment in Zeckendorf's own apartment house at 30 Beekman Place. He came to take up so much of his young designer's time “that we would even get last‐minute summonses to his place for breakfast,” Eileen\n\nPei's first job was the creation of a round penthouse as\n\nZeckendorf's private office atop Webb & Knapp's midtown headquarters. From there he went on to do the Mile High Center in Denver, a project strongly influenced by the glass-and-steel style of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Place Ville Marie in Montreal, and the concrete grid facade of Kips Bay Plaza apartment slabs in New York. None of these are among his very best works, but they all show a disciplined intelligence struggling, and succeeding, at the task of forcing design quality into the economic straitjacket of speculative real‐estate development. As real‐estate projects, all three of these remain head and shoulders above their contemporaries.\n\nBy 1955, Pei had begun to take on design projects on his own, outside Zeckendorf's purview. His first, a concrete tower for the earth‐science center at M.I.T., turned out to be ill‐fated: a serious error in the design of an open ground floor turned the base of the building into a wind tunnel. But the serious functional problems did not deter other clients from coming Pei's way, and by 1960 he left Zeckendorf entirely to set up his\n\nAt that point he had already formed the nucleus of the office that remains with him to this day — partners Henry N. Cobb and Eason Leonard, and associate partners James I. Freed, Leonard Jacobson and Werner Wandelmaier. The continuity of the Pei staff is especially unusual in the volatile world of architectural practice. The leadership of the Pei office has been there for two decades. They are architects who have learned how bring out the best of each other, as people do in a successful marriage. One architect, who has competed with Pei for many jobs, credits Pei's willingness to share responsibility as the main reason for the office's stability: “Pei really let 88 Pine Street [a lower Manhattan skyscraper] be Jim Freed's building, or Hancock be Harry Cobb's,” the architect said. “That is how you keep good people: by giving them a share of the work and not denying them a share of\n\nWhen 88 Pine Street won the prestigious R. S. Reynolds Award, for example, it was Freed, not Pei, who received it. On the other hand, Pei did not hide behind Cobb when Hancock began to cause problems. He recognized that it was his name on the blueprints, even if the design was largely Cobb's, and he did not flinch from the slings and arrows that came the firm's way during the long period of anguish surrounding the tower's tumbling windows.\n\nPei himself is involved in determining the basic concept for virtually all of the firm's designs, with the exception of certain minor projects or projects which are largely Cobb's, such as the firm's new (and surprisingly classicizing) art museum for Portland, Me., a headquarters for Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, N.J., and a complex of skyscrapers in Dallas. Pei follows some of them through to completion, but he now devotes a great deal of his time to traveling and seeking clients for future work, a habit he got into when the Hancock problems forced him to spend as much time doing public relations as designing. It was international work that kept the firm in business during those difficult years; and while Pei now says that he would prefer to be doing more smaller‐scale work closer to home, so as to allow him to become more personally active in design, enough overseas work remains for him to keep jetting quite often to Singapore, Hong\n\nI. M. Pei & Partners is housed on two floors of a Madison Avenue office building, a tower with the sort of crude glass curtain wall and Miami Beach lobby so distant from the cool refinement of Pei's own work that one wonders how the architect makes it through the lobby each morning. Once off the elevator on the ninth floor, though, one is in a world of Pei's own - white walls, a dark industrial carpet, Mies chairs. It might almost be an elegant law office, but for the names of the partners in discreet white lettering on the white walls, and the sense that the design is just a bit too austere for most lawyers’ tastes. But there is no hard sell of the firm's architectural product. The only buildings visible are a row of color transparencies mounted on a wall down the hall from the reception\n\nPei - whom associates and friends call 1. M. - is a short, trim man who dresses in conservative, tailored suits; only the round glasses, which Le Corbusier made de rigueur for architects, make it clear that he is not a banker. His speech is precise, with a hint of an accent (but less than he thinks he has), and there is always enthusiasm in his voice.\n\nHe works in a corner office that expresses both his love of the modernist vocabulary and his personal, and highly cultivated, way of dealing with it. Pei sits not at a desk but at a square Parson's table with four Mies chairs, and the table is piled high with reports. magazines, newspaper clippings and correspondence. An immense Al Held drawing fills one wall, and on the countertops there are mockups of sculpture by Picasso and Calder. It is not a large room, but it is the sort of office that exudes confidence. It suggests that its occupant wanted an office that would be at once workplace and showplace.\n\nThe esthetic of the office is carried through to the Peis’ residence, a townhouse on Sutton Place which I. M. and Eileen Pei bought five years ago when they decided at long last to make a switch from Beekman Place. Pei rebuilt the house entirely, adding a glass wall looking out to the East River. Like both of the Peis themselves, the house is elegant, quiet and refined. It is simple, but in a way that makes clear that its owners were not restricted from indulging their tastes for fine objects. There is a sumptuous Morris Louis painting at the head of the stairs to the main living floor, with a pair of Dubuffet sculptures on the floor before it and works by Franz Kline,\n\nIso.lon‐% John Ilancock loner. a., it looked in the earls 70%. hen man) nindons ony.te Is fell Jacques Lipchitz nearby.

They also have ttweegrown sons, two of whom — Chien Cluing, known as Didi, and I.i Chung, known as Sandy — are architects on their (miler's staff. A third son, Ting Chung, works with a French real-estate development firm based in New York.\n\nThe Peis also have a country house of glass and wood in Katonah, N.Y., which Pei himself designed in 1(152. While he loves to be there 10 garden “lie can put ter all day, picking weeds and planting flowers,” says Sandy Pei — the couple have been spending more and more time 111 the city since they moved to Sutton Place. Pei is now so busy that he goes to his office Saturdays when he is not away on business, and the Peis’ traditional gallerygoing weekends together have been all but abandoned.\n\n“I do it on my own now,” said Eileen Pei, “and I tell I.

The Way Mies van der I the bonned is\n\n“I think that my schooling with Webb & Knapp may have set me back philosophically. It others will have simple cut‐out windows. The eccentric shape and odd window patterns are in part an attempt to defer to the tower's major neighbors, Pennzoil Place by Johnson/ Burgee and 1 Shell Plaza by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. But they also represent an attempt by Pei to explore alternatives to the glass box.\n\nNot that the firm has done ordinary glass boxes for some time. Eighty‐eight Pine Street is a light, well‐detailed tower that almost appears to float when viewed beside its mediocre neighbors. There should be a similar air of light-\n\nness to the reflective glass tower now going up for developer George Klein at 499 Park Avenue at 59th Street, Pei's first midtown Manhattan skyscraper. The 24‐story 499 Park Avenue will be fairly discreet, although its reflective glass may not be the most compatible material for this masonry district. Altogether different is the stunning and deeply powerful Oversea‐Chinese Banking Centre in Singapore, an immense tower of light, sandy‐colored granite with rounded ends and windows set into a solid mass in great 13‐story chunks. It is a building that is at once structurally expressive and symbolically valid both as a statement of banking functions and as a majestic tower for the cot ire city.\n\nThe Singapore building, which about to receive several Pei‐designed neighbors as a larger complex nearby gets the go‐ahead, probably vies with the Hancock tower for the position of the Pei firm's finest and most original skyscraper. Hancock is not as somber or as sumptuous as the Singapore building — its facade is of light blue glass and not beige masonry— but it is an eccentric and unusually graceful rhomboid shape.\n\nThe subtlety of the Hancock's design was overlooked in all of the talk surrounding the glass debacle, but now that things are calmer it is no surprise that the building has become quite respected, even beloved, by Bostonians. It makes a serious attempt to relate to complex site containing, among other things, two of the 19th‐century's greatest American buildings: Henry Hobson Richardson's Trinity Church and McKim, Mead & White's Boston Public Library. The glass was considered a way of lightening the building so as to make it less intrusive. It does not entirely succeed, for the dramatic difference between the glass and the older buildings is so startling as to offset the object ive of a calm joining.\n\nBut the intent of relating to context is still there, as in much of Pei's work. Occasionally, as in the rather overbearing new Dallas City Hall, there is a sense of trying too hard, a sense of just ton much architecture for the job at hand. But Pei's works rarely begin with a formal precept, with a form created for its own sake and imposed on an urban context without regard for the limitations of that context. His buildings — the Chinese hotel excepted — do tend to lean toward abstraction, toward the manipulation of geometric masses and volumes, but the manipulation is almost always done in the service of his building's context. At the National Gallery East Building, for example, Pei evolved a design based on a floor plan of two triangles, a scheme derived from the complicated layout of the site between Mall. He may well have been rejecting the newly fashionable route of adding to John Russell Pope's original and highly classicizing National Gallery in a similar classical style, but he was also rejecting the conventional modernist approach of ignoring the context and creating an abstract form responsible only to itself. Pei's National Gallery's form relates strongly to what is around it.\n\nThere is a somewhat more conventional kind of modernist monumentality in Pei's Kennedy Library. The library is a sad story: It was originally to he a pyramid of glass near Harvard Square, but local opposition to the influx of tourists expected led to a decade's delay, and finally to the redesigning of the building as a simple, understated masonry structure— a building that related so much to its context that it hardly did anything else. That did not manage to go into construction either, and finally the project was relocated to the campus of the University of Massachusetts at Columbia Point, in Dorchester, at the edge of Boston.\n\nThat is the building that will open soon, and it is a throwback, in part, I() Poi's earlier work. The library is it jx)werful set of geometric forms, a strong masonry box, sliced at the diagonal by a square box of glass supported by a space‐frame metal truss. The glass box contains an immense, open space within; it will be a room of considerable drama. It is too soon to make a judgment as to its success, but if it works it will he because of poi's ability to marry great space to bold geometric form.\n\nThere are no direct cultural references in the Kennedy Library, no attempt to relate to Kennedy's life, or to the Massachusetts surroundings, by making use of elements out of Massachusetts architectural traditions as Pei did with Chinese traditions in the Peking hotel. At Dorchester, the meaning will come from abstract forms, as it did at the National Gallery, at the Everson Museum, in the Luce Chapel.\n\nIt is conceivable that Pei, at this point, could move in either of two directions — toward the cultural references of his Peking hotel, or toward the abstraction of the Kennedy Library. To do the first would be to bring himself more in line with current American architectural fashion; to do the second would be to dig his heels in even more deeply into the modernist tradition in which his career has been built. What seems more likely, however, is that Pei will not move sharply in either direction. He justifies the stylistic departure of the Chinese hotel on the grounds of practicality, and he tries to explain his more modernist work on similar grounds. It is what clients want, it is what the materials and the technology available suggest, he believes. In the final analysis, what Pei builds is what he feels is appropriate for the job at hand.\n\nIt is not a way of making architecture that comes out of dogma, or out of rigid theory. For all of Pei's lingering respect for modernist theory, he clearly breaks rank with it as much as he follows it. His respect for, and contintterl use of, the modernist vernacular comes out of a belief that it can yield handsome forms, enabling spaces, buildings symbolic of the uses to which they are put. Pei's concerns, in the end, are classic ones. ■"
