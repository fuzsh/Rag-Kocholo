        "text": "The earliest names in Century Cityâs history that pop up happen to be silent film star Tom Mix, one of the greatest cowboy stars of his time, and his producer, William Fox, owner of The Fox Studio Corporation. Both men were vital players in the acquisition of the area known as Century City.\n\nIn 1925, Mix sold his private ranch to William Fox, who dreamed of expanding his studio from its cramped quarters in both Hollywood and Glendale to the undeveloped Western part of Los Angeles. In exchange for his personal ranch, Mix was given considerable acreage in Arizona as part of the deal. However, neither William Fox nor Tom Mix would live to see the creation of Century City.\n\nThe introduction of television to the consumer market in 1948 dealt a slow, painful blow to all the major studios. By 1950, studios had already lost a sizable share of its audience to the new home entertainment medium.\n\nOver the past 50 years, Century City has transformed into a vibrant city with culture, shopping, and businesses making it a destination stop within Los Angeles. More recently, CNN Money ranked 90067 as the 7th richest zip code in the country. Century City remains a link to the movie industry and old Hollywood. Famous films such as Die Hard and Planet of the Apes have used this city as their backdrop, and with Twentieth Century Foxâs studios headquartered here, and other production companies, movies and television programs continue to be made in this dynamic community."
