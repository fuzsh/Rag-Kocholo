        "meta_description": "Founded in 1912, The University of Hong Kong is the leading and oldest tertiary institute in Hong Kong. In the early years, the University was host to four Faculties: Arts, Engineering, Medicine and Science. The late 1940’s and the 1950’s were characterized by the city’s dramatic expansion due to emigration from China and the needs of the industry. The Department of Architecture was first introduced into the University in 1950, under the Deanship of Professor R. Gordon Brown. The first five-year Degree of Bachelor of Architecture was awarded in 1955. In 1958, Professor W. G. Gregory was appointed Dean until the School was amalgamated into the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture in the same year. Professional recognition of the degree was granted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1961 and joint visitations ran parallel with the Commonwealth Architects Association (CAA), the Architect’s Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK) and the Hong Kong Institute of Architects (HKIA). CAA recognition was received in 1968. Graduate studies in architecture resulted in the first PhD and MPhil degrees being awarded in 1969 and 1970 respectively.",

Pei, Walter Gropius, and TAC’s Huatung/Tunghai University.”\n\nChinese-born and American-trained I. M. Pei is regarded as perhaps the last master of high modernist architecture and remains renowned for his capacity to skillfully integrate modern principles with elements of vernacular building and traditional garden. Pei was trained at MIT and Harvard University during the 1930s-40s, and this research proposes an empirical study of his Bauhaus-inspired approach under the tutelage of his GSD mentor Walter Gropius at Harvard and The Architects Collaborative (TAC).\n\nJohn Harkness, the last living co-founder of TAC, has argued that Gropius did not hone his protégés’ talent via the International Style in the United States, but rather encouraged them to pursue solutions that grew out of the culture in which they were located. This syncretic agenda echoes in TAC’s campus design for Huatung University, an American missionary project commissioned for construction in Shanghai in 1948, for which Pei served as associate architect to Gropius.\n\nDue to turbulent war affairs, the project was cancelled, and it was not until the 1960s that the United Board for Christian Colleges ultimately realised the plan for a campus in China—Tunghai University, built in Taichung, Taiwan, and led by Pei and his GSD peer Chang Chaokang. Based largely on Taiwanese archival dossiers that have largely escaped today’s scholarly attention, my paper scrutinizes how Pei and Gropius encapsulated their GSD/TAC-era vision of modernism in a place where modernity was in flux, and through a project composed of one idea, two sites, and three architects.\n\nWU Kwang-Tyng Professor, Department of Architecture, National Cheng Kung University\n\n“Behind Pei’s Geometric Form and Space – A Case Study of the Osaka Expo Chinese Pavilion, 1970.”\n\nIn 1968, the well-known Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei was commissioned by the Government of the Republic of China in Taiwan as the main reviewer for the 1970 Osaka Expo Chinese Pavilion architecture design competition. Pei ultimately selected the work of Atelier Cambridge, a group of seven Taiwanese students who had studied overseas and worked in Boston. Pei convinced the government to invite Atelier Cambridge to join the special task force team for 1970 Osaka EXPO Chinese Pavilion design, and they collaborated on the design and construction of a pavilion.\n\nTwo years later, in 1972, the Republic of China was expelled from the United Nations, making the pavilion an artifact of the Republic of China’s final opportunity to participate in an international exposition as an official nation. The exposition also marked I.M Pei’s final professional engagement with the Chinese government of Taiwan.\n\nThe completion of this work as a “national symbol” inspired Taiwan at a time in which the island was contending with mainland China politically and, by extension, architecturally. As this paper argues, Pei and his design team’s work can be considered as an unusually inclusive cultural gesture for a government historically inclined toward conservativism. The project also offers an interpretation of China’s humanist architectural tradition that can be compared with several of Pei’s other important transitional works such as the Everson Museum (1968) and the National Gallery of Art’s East Building (1978).\n\nJuan DU Associate Professor, Department of Architecture, The University of Hong Kong\n\n“A Tower for ‘Modern China’.”\n\nA 1989 essay in the New York Times titled “China Won’t Ever Be the Same” expressed anger and disenchantment over the shocking events at Tiananmen Square on June 4th. The by-line of the author was simply “I.M. Pei is an architect”. The by-line’s modesty hinted at a man known for his diplomacy and inclination to avoid political controversy. Yet the essay spoke out again the Chinese communist government, which also happened to be Pei’s client at the time.\n\nIn June 1989 Pei was six months from finishing the Bank of China tower in Hong Kong, commissioned and owned by the Chinese state from Beijing, and representing the tallest building outside New York and Chicago. In the days following June 4th, the construction crew at the Hong Kong tower hung a giant banner from the top floor of the building that called for revenge and democracy. Hong Kong residents lined up to withdraw their money from BOC in protest. Pei also protested with his essay, knowing it may further jeopardize the project, which already had had to overcome a constrained site, small budget, extreme wind and earthquake load, a hostile local press, and high expectations of the tower to rival the neighbouring “colonial” HSBC building.\n\nThe tower’s final design revealed Pei’s effort to contribute to China’s “opening up and reforms” through his profession as an architect. The planning, design, and construction of the Bank of China tower reflected the greater cultural, economic, and political tensions between China, Hong Kong, and the United States during the initial decade of China’s opening up, the particularly tumultuous year of 1989, and the imminent handover of 1997.\n\nLIU Linfan PhD Candidate, School of Architecture, University of Pennsylvania\n\n“Rethinking I. M. Pei, A Pictorial Vision of Space.”\n\nThis paper examines the connection between imperial-era Chinese gardens and I. M. Pei’s architectural practice through the idea of a shared “pictorial vision.” Previous analysis of Pei’s work has not been able to ignore this relationship, though these discussions often offer a variety of distinctive emphases, from the specific material applications at work to the conceptual synthesis between classic Chinese gardens and Pei’s architectural ideals. Nevertheless, an underlying theme tends to anchor these accounts, namely, cultural representation and the issue of continuity of tradition in modern practice. While acknowledging these threads of thinking, my approach focuses on the intermediate medium of painting to illuminate the connection between the Chinese garden and Pei’s work.\n\nBy examining Pei’s design solutions, particularly in his built projects in China, I claim that the architect has long sought a dialogue between these two arts of different historical and cultural backgrounds—painting and architecture—through a latent pictorial accordance concretized through construction details and conceptualized as an exploration in spatiality.\n\nThe analysis will begin with Pei’s imitation of Mi Youren’s Cloudy Mountains (1130) in the design and construction of the rockery landscape at the Suzhou Museum (2002 – 06). Using this case study and related precedents, I aim to argue that, beyond its formal analogy, the creation of this “pictorial” landscape embodies Pei’s modern interpretation of the aesthetic and ontological implications shared among traditional Chinese arts (painting, rock appreciation, and gardens), and extending through contemporary design.\n\nPanel 2: Spatial and Formal Practices II\n\nModerator: Shirley Surya, Associate Curator, Design and Architecture, M+\n\nSpeakers\n\nBarry BERGDOLL Meyer Schapiro Professor of Art History and Archaeology, Department of Art History, Columbia University and Museum of Modern Art, New York\n\n“I.M. Pei’s ‘Museum of Chinese Art, Shanghai’ (1946): Modernism between East and West.”\n\nIt is tempting to dwell on the fact that exactly sixty years lie between I.M. Pei’s remarkable 1946 GSD master’s thesis A Museum of Chinese Art for Shanghai and the opening in 2006 of the Suzhou Museum for Chinese Art. But it is as interesting to reflect on the thesis project by an American-trained Chinese architect still in his own personal transition between the China of his childhood and teenage years and the emerging realization that he might never in fact return to China, which had been in a state of warfare essentially since his departure to study architecture on the east coast of the United States.\n\nDesignated as a project for Shanghai, where Pei had spent his teenage years, it offered a remarkable integration of a tradition of Chinese gardening – his new wife Eileen Loo had studied landscape architecture at the GSD – with a critical essay in the form of modernist museum space from Le Corbusier, who Pei admired enormously, and Mies van der Rohe. Indeed, the project offered a formal critique of the untapped possibilities of section in the Corbusian Domino form with a conversation with the latest work of Mies van der Rohe, whose collage for a Museum for a Small City of three years earlier is blatantly evoked in this radical reworking. Pei was positioning himself for a place in the postwar expansion of interwar modernism. If Pei’s museum project was premonitory, it was not so much as a specific prototype for museum design as it was for an ambition to create architecture in a post-war cultural debate, and not simply in its everyday commercial practice.\n\nEric MUMFORD Rebecca and John Voyles Professor of Architecture, Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts, Washington University\n\n“I.M. Pei and Urban Design, 1948-60.”\n\nArchitect Ieoh Ming Pei began working for the New York developer William Zeckendorf in 1948, and went on to design a series of major urban projects for him in North American cities until founding his own firm in 1960. While these projects themselves—which include two in downtown Denver, the Place Ville-Marie in Montreal, and urban renewal housing in Washington, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis—were widely publicized at the time and are relatively well-known, the intellectual context that informed them and their importance to the history of urbanism are not as clearly understood. In this paper I argue that Pei’s urban design work for Zeckendorf was closely related to the modernist approach to urban design that began to be advocated in the early 1950s by Philadelphia city planner Edmund N. Bacon, and Josep Lluis Sert, Dean at the Harvard Graduate School of Design from 1953-69.\n\nSeveral of Pei’s projects for Zeckendorf became well-known within the discourse on urban design emerging in the United States at the time, including his unbuilt proposal for townhouses in the Mill Creek Valley of St. Louis and Pei’s Society Hill towers and townhouses in a historic part of Philadelphia. This paper examines Pei’s work within the context of these debates and the disciplinary shifts ushered in by Jane Jacobs’s The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961), which would soon become part of the postmodernist critique of modernism, obscuring the historical importance of this transitional era in modern urbanism.\n\nSeng KUAN Lecturer, Harvard University Graduate School of Design\n\n“Sculpture as Architecture and Architecture as Sculpture.”\n\nFirst trained at MIT and worked as an engineer before enrolling in the architecture program at Harvard, I. M. Pei adhered to ideals of geometric clarity and structural rationality throughout his long career as an architect, which reached an eloquent apotheosis in the Bank of China Building. The proposed paper on the sculptural aspects of Pei’s architecture is to unpack a comment made by Pei that four sculptors he collaborated with—Picasso, Moore, Dubuffet, and Miró—successfully created abstract forms that were robust enough to scale up, commensurable with the urban monuments he was designing. Pei was evidently influenced by Sigfried Giedion and others who called for a more synthetic relationship between art and architecture in the early postwar period, especially in the urban and civic realm. Pei maintained deep friendships with the likes of Moore, Noguchi, and Zao Wou-ki, but he had a more practical, immediate scheme to harness the form-making and space-making potential in sculptures to inform his architecture.\n\nThe paper will examine four collaborative efforts between Pei and various sculptors: University Plaza at NYU (1967, Sylvette by Picasso/Carl Nesjar), Cleo Rogers Memorial Library in Columbus, Indiana (1971, Henry Moore’s Large Arch), an unrealized commission to Jean Dubuffet for the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art, and the Texas Commerce Tower in Houston (1982, Joan Miró’s Personage with Birds). Pei saw specific resonance between works of Dubuffet and rock ensembles in Suzhou’s Lion Grove, a classical garden that belonged to the Pei family during his youth. Further expanding from these case studies that define more narrowly Pei’s ideas of scalability and abstraction will be architectural works that clearly exhibit abstract sculptural qualities, such as the National Atmospheric Research Center in Boulder, Everson Art Museum in Syracuse, and the bell tower at the Miho Art Museum.\n\nRoundtable\n\nModerator:\n\nAric CHEN, Lead Curator, Design and Architecture,\n\nYung Ho CHANG Founder, Principal Architect, FCJZ\n\nNelson CHEN Director, School of Architecture, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Principal Architect, Nelson Chen Architects Ltd.\n\nHUANG Ming-Wei Founder, Studiobase Architects\n\nLIU Thai Ker Director, Morrow Architects & Planners Pte Ltd.\n\nMarjorie YANG Chairman, Esquel Group\n\nFriday, December 15\n\nPanel 3: Global Flow of Capital and Ideas\n\nModerator:\n\nEunice Seng, Associate Professor, Department of Architecture, The University of Hong Kong\n\nSara STEVENS Assistant Professor, School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, University of British Columbia\n\n“Designing Development: The Architectural Division of Webb & Knapp.”\n\nReal estate developer William Zeckendorf hired I.M. Pei to found and lead the architectural division of his company, Webb & Knapp, in 1948. Leaving his teaching position at Harvard’s GSD to take the new post, Pei began working inside the development company before he had a license and grew the division to sixty people before splitting off to form I.M. Pei and Associates in 1960. Zeckendorf had visions of remaking American cities through large-scale redevelopment projects that would bring exciting programs, from floating nightclubs to opera houses to automated parking garages, into downtowns to save them from the decay and disinvestment he believed threatened them. He had commissioned projects from Wallace Harrison and William Lescaze, and discussed the work with Le Corbusier.\n\nZeckendorf’s brash and swashbuckling style represented a stark change from Pei’s then projected path into academia, but it also presented a great opportunity to design and build big projects while his career was just starting. Zeckendorf’s Webb & Knapp was an incubator for Pei’s practice, and it undoubtedly shaped his career. This paper will study Pei’s architectural practice from within the confines of a real estate development company to interrogate how the process of development and financing influenced the design work of architects.\n\nKamran Afshar NADERI Architect and Professor, Tehran\n\n“Pei’s planning for changing the downtown of Tehran.”\n\nTehran, with its 850-km2 area and almost 12 million inhabitants, is one of the biggest and the most dynamic cities of the Middle East. During the late 1970s, I.M. Pei & Partners designed a large multi-use complex for the city’s core. The contract negotiations and design work lasted around two years, from 1976 to 1978, but due to the Islamic Revolution of 1978, the construction work never begun. Kapsad, a Turkish-Seychelles company, was the patron of the project and Sazeh consultant engineering was involved as the local partner.\n\nThe project, located on a 36-acre plot, was conceived in two phases. The plot is located in a strategic district. It is close to two main theaters, universities, Daneshjoo Park, and the Vatican, Italian, Russian and French embassies. There, Pei designed a complex including an office tower, a large shopping center, two 135 m high residential towers, a 400-room hotel and several other programs. The bibliographic material about the project is very rare, but recently discovered and and partly unpublished material sheds new light on the project. This material includes written and visual documentation from Pei’s local partner, an interview with one of the engineers involved in the project, an exclusive interview with Pei published in an Iranian journal from June 1976, and aerial photography of Tehran from the time of the original project proposal.\n\nJiat-Hwee CHANG Assistant Professor, Department of Architecture, National University of Singapore\n\n“Prefiguring the Architecture of Asian Global Capitalism: OCBC Centre and Post-colonial Globalization.”\n\nThe OCBC Centre, completed in November 1976 and designed by I.M. Pei and Partners, is regarded as a significant landmark in Singapore. Built as the headquarters of Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation, the largest bank in Singapore and one of the largest in Southeast Asia in the mid-1970s, the OCBC Centre was seen by one commentator to have “set the benchmark for future corporate architecture and acted as an emblem of local capital with a global vision” in the region.\n\nUpon its completion, the OCBC Centre was the tallest building in Asia outside Japan, with Southeast Asia’s largest banking hall. It was also the first major building in post-independent Singapore to be designed by an internationally renowned overseas architect. Prior to the OCBC Centre, major buildings in post-independent Singapore were designed by local architects as a part of the post-colonial nation-building efforts. After the OCBC Centre, the floodgates opened and most major commission were awarded to internationally renowned overseas architects, such as Kenzo Tange, John Portman, Paul Rudolph, and Moshe Safdie. The OCBC Center can thus be seen as a turning point in the architectural and socio-economic history of Singapore and perhaps the region.\n\nThis paper examines the architectural and urban histories of OCBC Centre and the bank headquarters preceding it, in particular, the China Building (completed in 1932 and demolished in 1972), in relation to the history of OCBC and its place in Singapore’s economic development as the city transformed from a colonial port-city to a post-colonial global city between the 1930s and 1970s. This paper posits that the design of OCBC Centre—an extraordinarily clear “architectural one-liner” and successful symbol of OCBC’s position as the leading bank and business group in the region—makes it a precursor to Singapore’s iconic architecture from the 1990s.\n\nThomas DANIELL Associate Professor, Head of the Department of Architecture, University of Saint Joseph\n\n“Divine Light.”\n\nOne of I. M. Pei’s first undertakings after his 1990 “retirement” was a bell tower for the Japanese quasi-religious organization Shumei, a tiny commission that allowed him to indulge his long-held ambition to be a sculptor as well as an architect. Shumei was founded in 1970 as an offshoot of the Church of World Messianity, a new Japanese religion supported upon three pillars: jōrei (spiritual purification though channeling divine light), shizen nōhō (physical purification through farming without fertilizer or pesticides), and geijutsu katsudo (mental purification through art appreciation). Though not overtly religious, Shumei likewise places great emphasis on respect for nature and the healing power of art. Following the successful realization of the bell tower, Shumei’s founder—Mihoko Koyama, at that time one of the richest women in Japan—invited Pei to create a museum to hold her collection of tea ceremony utensils.\n\nEmbedded in the mountains about 120km east of the ancient Japanese capital Kyoto, the Miho Museum (1997) is a sublime marriage of Shumei’s tenets regarding art and the environment with Pei’s characteristically sensitive integration of pristine architectural geometry and natural topography. The approach route itself comprises a series of extraordinary contrasts: a 120-meter-long bridge/tunnel extends from the reception pavilion, piercing a hill and spanning a valley to arrive at the entrance hall, which has an enormous glazed roof that simultaneously recalls “profane” vernacular dwellings and floods the interior with “divine” light. This paper will examine the synergistic or contradictory relationships of Pei’s architecture with client, site, program, and ideology.\n\nConcluding Session\n\nLIN Bing Partner, OLI Architecture PLLC\n\nLI Chung (Sandi) PEI Principal, Pei Partnership Architects\n\nCalvin TSAO Principal, Tsao & McKown"
