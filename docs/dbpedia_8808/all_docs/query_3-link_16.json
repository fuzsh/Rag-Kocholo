        "text": "Groundbreaking Ceremony (03:52)\n\nFREE PREVIEW\n\nIn 1986 finance teams, developers, and architects attend the groundbreaking ceremony to build the Worldwide Plaza, one of New York's finest skyscrapers, over the old Madison Square Garden.\n\nSkyscraper Design (03:24)\n\nThe site could become a magnet for companies looking for space. Architect David Childs creates a design reflecting some of the earlier decorative buildings of New York.\n\nDeveloper's Concept (03:09)\n\nDeveloper William Zeckendorf believes he has a responsibility to leave the city better off with the Worldwide Plaza. He has a talent for raising money. The building site is located in Manhattan.\n\nLocal Neighborhood Politics (05:42)\n\nThe racially diverse community of Clinton voices strong objections to economic changes in their community. With some political concessions, the Board of Estimates approves the project.\n\nChange is Inevitable (02:51)\n\nSome workers also share their concerns about how the reality of economics dictates change in a community. Businesses like the Ogilvy Group will relocate only if the local area is also desirable.\n\nRole of Construction Company (03:30)\n\nHRH Construction Company ensures the structure is built on time and is within budget. Permits are obtained to dig up old pipes and cable. Locals reminisce about the old Madison Square Garden.\n\nExcavation Process (05:24)\n\nAfter the rubble is hauled away, the blasting team from Delmar Excavation Company prepares the area for the new Worldwide Plaza with dynamite which is strictly controlled by law.\n\nCommunications and Negotiations (05:00)\n\nBuilding a skyscraper is a serious of simultaneous operations, and communication is the biggest problem. The owner's representative negotiates with the architects and construction company.\n\nFast Track Method (05:07)\n\nIn a city as expensive as New York, construction starts before the architect has finished the plans. Architects never stop designing, and late changes are expected, but not without consequences.\n\nSteel Fabrication (04:43)\n\nThe combination of the Fast Track Method and the changes in the arcade design puts a lot of pressure on Mosher Steel Company. Steel tree columns are a major part of the structure.\n\nConcrete Footings and Quality Control (03:29)\n\nConcrete footings are poured and monitored by quality control. The construction manager battles with the city to secure access to the site.\n\nInstalling the First Steel Column (04:40)\n\nThe first steel plate arrives for the first steel column. Every step of the way is marked in the blueprint. The first column weighs 20 tons and must share the weight of the entire building."
