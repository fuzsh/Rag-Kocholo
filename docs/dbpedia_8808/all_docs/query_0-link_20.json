        "text": "The implementation of Modern Movement town planning is still regarded as both rapid and relatively unproblematic in the aftermath of World War II. A more complex narrative emerges from an examination of the urban redevelopment policy and practice at Vancouver, British Columbia, during the immediate World War II decades. The analysis focuses on the civic and professional discourse of redevelopment. It illuminates the diverse interests and processes by which Modernist planning theory and practice were introduced, modified and resisted. New concepts and values are shown to have been subject to internal no less than external forces of revision.\n\n1 The social and architectural history is examined by Liscombe, R. Windsor, The New Spirit: Modern Architecture in Vancouver, 1938–1963 (Montreal, 1997)Google Scholar, bringing out Giedion's, Sigfried assertion that ‘Architects today are perfectly aware that the future of architecture is inseparably bound up with town planning’ in his seminal book, Space, Time and Architecture, 3rd enlarged edn (Cambridge, MA, 1954), 23Google Scholar. The history of town planning in Vancouver is outlined in the ‘Guide to the Planning Department’, the City of Vancouver City Archives (hereafter CVA); and related in Oberlander, J., ‘History of planning in Greater Vancouver’, in Davis, C. (ed.), The Greater Vancouver Book: An Urban Encyclopedia (Vancouver, 2003)Google Scholar; see also Morley, A., From Milltown to Metropolis (Vancouver, 1961)Google Scholar; Barman, J., The West Beyond the West (Toronto, 1996)Google Scholar. The author is most grateful to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council for Canada for funding this research and to the editor and anonymous readers for their contribution to the refinement of both argument and text.\n\n2 The communicative, if not precisely linguistic, aspect of architecture was articulated by the most internationally renowned Canadian architect of the era, Arthur Erickson – Vancouver-born and based – in his article, ‘The weight of heaven’, writing, ‘The architect infuses meaning into forms which then become symbols, like words, units of meaning which, put together, make sense out of previous confusion’, Canadian Architect, 9 (Mar. 1964), 48, article 48–63. The relation between Modernist architectural discourse and media, especially journalistic and during the interview years, is examined by Colomina, B., Privacy and Publicity. Modern Architecture and Mass Media (Cambridge, MA, 1994Google Scholar).\n\n4 The scope for the Modern Movement, including internal contestation as by Team Ten, is summarized in Frampton, K., Modern Architecture: A Critical History, 4th edn (London, 2007)Google Scholar; Colquhoun, A., Modern Architecture (Oxford, 2002)Google Scholar; and with particular respect to internal division, Mumford, E., The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928–1960 (Cambridge, MA, 2000)Google Scholar; its discursive aspects are defined by Goldhagen, S.W., ‘Something to talk about; Modernism, discourse, style’, Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, 64 (Jun. 2005), 144–67CrossRefGoogle Scholar, and in Vidler, A., Histories of the Immediate Present. Inventing Architectural Modernism (Cambridge, MA, 2008)CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n5 In order of citation, these representative writings are: Habermas, J., trans. Tsoskouunglou, H., ‘Modern and postmodern architecture’, 9H, 4 (1982), 227–35Google Scholar; Heynen, H., Architecture and Modernity: A Critique (Cambridge, MA, 1999)Google Scholar; Watkin, D., Morality and Architecture Revisited (Chicago, 2001)Google Scholar; Scott, J.C., Seeing Like a State (New Haven, 1998)Google Scholar; Jacobs, J., Death and Life of Great American Cities (New York, 1961)Google Scholar; Jencks, C., Language of Post-modern Architecture, 6th edn (London, 1991)Google Scholar; Venturi, R., Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture (New York, 1966)Google Scholar; Wilson, C.

The full range of literature is further indicated by such more theoretical studies as Lefebvre, H., Droit a la Ville (Paris, 1968)Google Scholar, as against situated analyses exemplified by Soja, E., Postmetropolis; Critical Studies of Cities and Regions (Maldon, MA, 2000)Google Scholar.\n\n32 Liscombe, New Spirit, 173–5, for the BC Electric Building. The chief architect of CMHC, Ian MacLennan, also criticized the complacency of architects and planners in a speech reprinted in the Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, 3 (May 1961), 66–7.\n\n45 The public debates are summarized by MacKenzie, K., Freeway Planning and Protests in Vancouver, 1954–1972 (Burnaby, 1985)Google Scholar. Among other local proposals was ‘The Vancouver Board of Trade Brief on Freeways’, published in September 1960. The local debate is recounted in Pendakur, Setty V., Cities, Citizens and Freeways (Vancouver, 1978)Google Scholar; for the North American context, Lewis, T., Divided Highways: Building the Interstate Highways, Transforming American Life (New York, 1997)Google Scholar, and Clair, D.J. St, The Motorization of American Cities (New York, 1986)Google Scholar. Interestingly, the British architect Maxwell Fry had included a photograph of a freeway east of the Los Angeles civic centre in Art in the Machine Age (London, 1960), illus. 22 opposite 91, with the caption, ‘The freeways are magnificently free where all else is confined’."
