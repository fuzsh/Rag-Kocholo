        "text": "Punjab Ekta Party announces its first overseas NRI structure of England\n\nLos Angeles, March. 28, 2019\n\nNRIpress.club/Ramesh/ A.Gary Singh Grewal\n\nIn a press release issued here, Punjab Ekta Party President Sukhpal Singh Khaira released the first list of overseas NRI structure of UK. As per the structure the UK team will have an 11 member Executive committee and similar committees for five important cities/towns of England dominated by the Punjabi community. Khaira said it is a matter of pride for his party that a vast majority of Punjabi NRI’s have decided to support his party, which they perceive as the upcoming political alternative to the corrupt traditional parties of Akali Dal and Congress in Punjab.\n\nKhaira said that the entire Punjabi NRI community has totally rejected the double standards and the opportunistic politics being pursued by Arvind Kejriwal and the Aam Aadmi Party. Khaira said that NRI’s have been badly betrayed by Arvind Kejriwal who collected huge sums of money in the name of bringing a revolution in the Indian politics but is now begging the Congress for an alliance with his party, besides tendering cowardly apology to the drug tainted Ex Minister Bikram Majithia.\n\nKhaira said that the Punjabi NRI’s are playing a vital role in the development of Punjab by investing money to improve schools, hospitals, gurudwaras, promoting sports and also undertaking sewerage projects etc. in the countryside. Khaira said he is sure that if the NRI’s are made partners in the inclusive development and growth of Punjab, they can substantially improve the plight of our state and the living standard of the people. Khaira said till now all the traditional parties including AAP have only been using NRI’s to raise funds and have never bothered to watch their interests, their properties, agricultural lands etc. back home in Punjab.\n\nThese parties have often slapped false cases against NRI’s to usurp their properties and their lands.\n\nKhaira assured the NRI’s that he would give them direct representation in the ensuing 2022 assembly elections in Punjab by offering NRI’s 3-5 assembly seats in the state. He also said that an NRI would head the NRI affairs department of Punjab as a Minister in case his party forms the government, as he would best understand the pain, agony and the issues of our NRI’s living abroad. Khaira said his party would release more countrywise NRI chapters in the days to come.\n\nPunjab Ekta Party UK Team\n\nPresident – Lakhwinder Singh Durha\n\nVice President – Jagjit Singh Dhillon\n\nPresident Women wing – Harjinder Kaur Grewal\n\nPresident Fundraising – Gurcharan Singh Sujapuria\n\nPresident Outreach – Ranvir Singh rai\n\nPresident Social Media – Jaspal Singh Thind\n\nAdvisory Coordinator – Rajwant Singh Kang\n\nPresident Media – Kewal Singh\n\nYouth President – Sukhjivan Singh Malhi\n\nNational Spokesperson – Tejpal Singh Dulay\n\nPresident Events – Bhupinder Singh Dhaliwal\n\n13 Executive Member Committee of PEP Leicester\n\nPresident – Dr. Sujjan Singh\n\nGeneral Secretary – Jagtar Singh\n\nSpokesperson – Surinderpal Singh\n\nTreasurer – Nirmal Singh Saini\n\nPresident Fundraising – Kamal Ghattoraya\n\nSecretary – Shamsher Singh\n\nAdvisor – Kashmir Singh Khalsa\n\nMedia Advisor – Jagtar Singh Kang\n\nMandeep Singh\n\nYouth – Nishan Singh\n\nMember – Jarnail Singh Rana\n\nMember – Lachman Dass\n\nMember – Avtar Singh\n\nPEP Bradford team\n\nPresident – Harbhajan Singh Dhesi\n\nVice President – Nirmal Singh\n\nGeneral Secretary – Harcharan Singh Bains\n\nAssistant General Secretary – Mandip Singh\n\nTreasurer – Harpal Singh Khabra\n\nMember Secretary – Harwinder Singh Gill\n\nEvent Organiser – Rashpal Singh\n\nMedia Organiser – Tarnjit Singh Dhaliwal\n\nPEP Sunderland team\n\nPresident – Jarnail Singh Bhandal\n\nVice President – Harvinder Singh Sahota\n\nSecretary – Mohinder Singh Atkar\n\nTreasurer – Dalbir Singh Gill\n\nKuldip Singh Dhesi\n\nSantokh Singh Samra\n\nAvtar Singh Kang\n\nAvtar Singh Badwal\n\nChain Singh Gill\n\nBalihar Singh Dulay\n\nSukhveer Singh Sahota\n\nEast London Team\n\nPresident – Makhan Singh Sodhi\n\nPresident Fundraising – Baljinder Singh\n\nJoint Secretary – Balwinder Singh\n\nMentor – Amrik Singh Dhillon\n\nSukhvir Singh Thind\n\nHarjinder Singh\n\nKulwant Singh\n\nSukhwinder Singh\n\nKuldeep Singh\n\nManjinder Singh Gill\n\nChamkor Singh\n\nDavinder Singh\n\nOnkar Singh\n\nRanjit Singh\n\nDaljit Singh\n\nMalkit Singh\n\nJagdip Singh\n\nJagjit Singh Mand\n\nAmandeep Singh\n\nAmarjit Singh\n\nVarinder Singh\n\nLovepreet Singh\n\nHarwinder Singh\n\nGurinder Singh\n\nGurpreet Singh\n\nPEP Birmingham\n\nPresident – Keepa Bhandal\n\nVice President – Nikka Nagra\n\nGeneral Secretary – Davinder Singh Tut\n\nSpokesperson – Kulwinder Singh Dhanoa\n\nEvents Organiser – Lakhwinder Singh\n\nBinder Sidhu\n\nBittu Brar\n\nJaguar Singh Sidhu\n\nMani Sherpuria\n\nChamkour Singh\n\nJatinderpal\n\nSarbjit Singh\n\nBhagwant Singh\n\nJAggi Gill\n\nJoga Makhu\n\nJoga Malhi\n\nLadi Baserpuria\n\nM.S.Bhullar\n\nManveer Singh\n\nKuldip Singh"
