Kaushal had earned the ire of Amarinder, who had even written against him to the Election Commission during the just-concluded elections and demanded that he be replaced.\n\nAlso read | Assembly elections: Why was Punjab immune to the Modi ‘magic’?\n\nKBS Sidhu was among the first officers to reach Amarinder’s Chandigarh residence after the Congress was heading towards a majority in the assembly on March 11. But the CM-designate has opted for Karan Avtar as he can have a longer stint as chief secretary. NS Kang, who is currently on central deputation, is due to retire in April next year while Karan Avtar’s retirement is due in 2020."
