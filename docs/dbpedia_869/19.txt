James Bolestridge, domestic servant, and Ann Hickling, the daughter of William Hickling a confectioner, married on Oct 5th 1841 at Sneinton, (Snenton), on the outskirts of Nottingham England. Ann appears to already have a son, Edwin B Hickling registered in the June quarter of 1841 who may well be James' son. Another son, James John, was born on 18th September 1844 his father stated to be a victualler of Saint Mary's Gate Nottingham. On November 21st 1844 there was a terrible train crash on the Nottinghamto Beeston line in which James Bolestridge was fatally injured. At that time he was said to be the Landlord of the "Three Horse Shoes Derby Road". 1

Ann re-married the following March to widower William Smith, a hosier and the family emigrated to America in 1847. They have yet to be found in the 1850 census but the 1860 census lists them all with the surname Smith at Philadelphia.Ann can be found in the 1880 census listed as Ann Bolestridge with her son Edwin H. Now once more a widow she appears to have reverted to her previous married name of Bolestridge. By the British 1881 census she was back in England, visiting her brother on the outskirts of Nottingham, still listed as Bolestridge. 1 1

James J Bolstridge, Stationer of Philadelphia. 1

The United States 1900 Census lists a James Bolestridge and his wife Charlotte at 1409 North Second Street Philadelphia. James, a stationer, is said to have been born in England in September 1844 to English parents., his wife in May 1845 in Pennsylvania to German Parents. James had been in the States since 1847, married in 1868, and he and Charlotte had two children only one surviving. As the surviving child was a daughter this line terminated when James died sometime after 1920. James served in the civilwar as a corporal and was seriously injured twice.

The earliest Bolstridge yet found in Nottinghamshire was one James Bolstridge who married Ann Hickling in Sneinton in October 1841. Ann, the daughter of a confectioner trading at St Mary's Gate, already had 5 month old son Edwin who could be James' child.James died as a result of injuries he received in the Nottingham Train Crash on 21 Nov 1844 and Ann remarried. Shortly before he died Ann gave birth to a son James John Bolestridge and at that time James was described as, James Bolestridge Victualler ofSt Mary's Gate. Ann along with her new husband, William Smith, emigrated to America in 1847. 1

In the 1840's the ribbon trade of Bedworth was in serious decline by 1846 we have the first Bolstridge recorded as a coal miner. The mines at Bedworth were now providing alternative work and in successive decades we find more Bolstridges employed as colliers. About 1862 William Bolstridge, a collier from Bedworth, and his wife Sarah Pickard, moved Basford near Nottingham to work in the fast expanding Nottingham coalfield. His descendants,( he had seventeen children by two wives), still live in the Nottingham area to this day. 1

James Bolestridge born c 1815 appears out of nowhere in 1840 at Sneinton Nottingham. At his marriage he quotes his father as James (Deceased) a Farmer. James Jnr appears to be both literate and intelligent having a sucessful business. There is a will in existance following his death in 1844 but it has not been examined at present.

THE SPECTATOR, 30 NOVEMBER 1844, Page 12. 1

The fifth and most disastrous accident also occurred on the Midland Counties Railway, near Nottingham. The victims were utterly passive and unconscious, and the accident is imputable solely to the grossest negligence and rashness in some quarter. The reader should understand that the railroad runs through Derby to Nottingham, and that the station nearest to Nottingham is the Beeston station, the distance from Beeston to Nottingham being three miles. Through an accident which probably could not have been prevented, the up line from Nottingham was obstructed, near that town, by a tender that got off the rails and damaged them. This was about two o'clock. A train was to start from Nottingham at ten minutes to three o'clock, and it was resolved not to preventit, but to despatch it by the down line, used for trains going to Nottingham. A train was expected from Derby, and it actually arrived at the Beeston station at three o'clock. HOWITT, a railway. policeman, was sent by KEARSLEY, an engineer, on foot to Bees- ton, to stop any train coming downwards, that is by the down line to Nottingham, until two trains from Nottingham should have passed : he reached the station, but gave his message vaguely. Before him had arrived Mr. LIGHTFOOT, the Nottingham station- master, who came from Nottingham to the Beeston station on the engine of one of the two trains whose path HOWITT was to clear ; travelling on the down line, the one appropriated to trains travelling in the opposite direction. Be it remembered that all this time there was an exceedingly thick fog. Now begins the most unac- countable blundering. Mr. Ltarrrroor, saying that the obstruc- tion would have been cleared by this time, and that the Notting- ham train would travel upon the up-line, the proper line, took charge of the Derby train, and went forward towards Nottingham. The policeman HOWITT says that he exhorted Mr. LIGHTFOOT not to do so ; and he asserts that he tried, unsuccessfully, to procure the intervention of the Beeston station-master and of theguard of the Derby train ; though this interference is denied. Mr. LIGHTFOOT avers that he was not aware of the intention to start any second train on the wrong line : he had scarcely left the station before his train clashed with the Nottingham train, coming upon the down line. Who actually sent it, whether KEARSLEY or some other person, does not distinctly appear. The Nottingham train was smashed to pieces; two people were killed ; one was so much hurt that he has undergone a dangerous amputation of the whole leg, the final result of which has yet to be learned ; and nineteen other persons were more or less hurt : in five minutes after Mr. LIGHTFOOT'S presumption of safety, his train had converted the peaceful railway into a scene like a field of battle, resounding with the cries and groans of the dying and wounded. Observe, one line of rails is blocked up : it is resolved, very hazardously, as it appears to us, to use the wrong line of rails, and a messenger is sent to the next station to establish that understanding : another person undoes the arrangement, and presumes that the right line will be used : the wrong line is used ; death and mutilation ensuing. 1 solution of this fatal enigma we leave to time; but some things are apparent on the face of the case. On no account ought the wrong line to be used, until sufficient time has elapsed to alter the whole series of departures and arrivals on the railroador a certain portion of it, so that while only one pair of rails is in use, it shall be used within certain defined hours solely as a down line, and in other defined periods solely as an up line; leaving sufficient interval without any use of it all, to allow for variations of time, and to prevent the casual collision of trains. Until that understanding be known, by written message and written answer, to be established throughout the part of the railroad where it becomes needful, that part ought only to be used for its right and generally accepted purpose, trains going only one way. Punctuality of departure and arrival should be strictly enforced. We know well of other lines on which delay of ten or fifteen minutes, or even more, has made passengers not unreasonably appre- hensive of some sudden collision from behind. If a train cannot de- part at its proper time, it should not be sent at all, but missedâ€” regarded as a train lost ; the passengers or goods being sent by the next opportunity. The public would scarcely grumble, on know- ing that their own safety was the object : the trilling loss of money, if any, is not worth consideration in such a matter. 1

In the present case we find all sorts of people giving orders, and no one obeying to any effectual purpose : all do not even seem to know who is or is not superior to them ; but all evince large notions of their own discretion, sometimes commendably, sometimes cul- pably. HOWITT, the policeman, does not regard KEARSLEY, the engineer, as " exactly " his superior ; LIGHTFOOT, the manager of the Nottingham station, claims How= as " his servant "; yet LIGHTFOOT acknowledges in KEARSLEY an authority superior to his own! Such a defective subordination and discipline cannot but provoke confusion, and be seriously hazardous where powerful and dangerous engines are at work. That source of danger might easily be prevented. The whole body of servants belonging to each railway ought to be organized in one regiment, to use a military but appropriate term : the subjection of certain classes to other classes would readily and obviously be made intelligible, as police- men to clerks : and where equality of class prevented such obvious subordination, the effect might be produced by numbering the whole set of men in each class : Policeman 101 would have sueh authority over Policeman 102 as a corporal in the Army has over a private, 101 yielding again to 100: and this gradation of numbers might be made subservient to a useful species of promotion for good behaviour, especially with a slightly corresponding gradation of salaries. But the chief advantages of a strict subordination would be, that there would be no clashing of orders, a readily ascertainable responsibility on each occasion, and a better intelli- gence of every man's duty. Some one person ought to have been responsible, and known to be so, for the hazardous manoeuvre of the 21st instant ; instead of engineers, policemen, and clerks run- ning about marring each other's authority, and rendering the safety of a great railway what is proverbially " nobody's business.". 1

The question remains as to the final enforcement of respon- sibility: and here the law needs evident and instant revision. We must remember that we have to deal with corporate bodies, who have proverbially " no heart," and whose soul of life and ex- istence is profit. No correctional check, therefore, seems so fitting as pecuniary fine, teaching that too reckless a grasp at profit may entail lossâ€”restoring the money-balance to the side of prudence and security. It has also further recommendations. It is often opportune, as where the person maimed is deprived of the means of labour and subsistence, or where the person killed was the sup- port or aid of surviving relatives. Also, it has the favourable and spontaneous opinion of the real " public " in its favour ; evinced in the large but not disproportionate " deodands " imposed by juries. Such imposition, it appears, does not accord with the theory of that anomalous and absurd fine the deodand ; which should at once be abolished, and damages by civil action, under a facile pro- cess, should be substituted. That is the check to which every consideration pointsâ€”the public instinct, the theory of corporate sensitiveness, and the spirit of just reparation. 1

Nola bens: it strikes us that, until some peremptory system shalt be adopted, Queen VICTORIA ought never to travel by special train, without another pilot special train sent before her, to be destroyed instead, in case of any misunderstanding among the clerks and policemen on the road. 1 1
