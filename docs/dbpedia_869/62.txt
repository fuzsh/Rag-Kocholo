We have received from a correspondent the following additional particulars of the accident which occurred at Princeton yesterday, an account of which will be found on the second page of the TIMES: --

None of the passengers on the New-York train were hurt. Most of the passengers on the Philadelphia train were in the front cars, which had got off the track just in time. Seventeen of them, however, were more or less injured -- most of them but slightly. Ten of them came on to New-York, and some of them were taken to the Railroad Hotel, and kindly cared for. Several of the physicians of the place, and others, rendered efficient service, and the unfortunate persons were soon made as comfortable as possible.

The following are the names of those who remain at Princeton:

Patrick Riley, soldier of Fourteenth Regiment, New-York -- slightly bruised.

Mrs. Rusquin, No. 330 Garden-street, Philadelphia -- very slightly hurt.

Seth Bryan -- slight wound of the scalp.

Mrs. Emily Loff and son, Middle Haddam, Conn. -- slightly injured.
