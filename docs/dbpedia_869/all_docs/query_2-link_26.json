        "text": "David Alff’s new book, The Northeast Corridor, is a history of America’s most important railroad, and the region it has defined for almost 200 years. The book explores through words, photographs, blueprints, and diagrams how trains transformed an arch of Atlantic shoreline into a world political capital and global financial hub, and home to over fifty million people. This presentation focuses on the corridor’s impact on New Jersey, from John Stevens’s receipt of the nation’s first rail charter in 1815 to the rise of the Camden & Amboy and New Jersey Railroads to the Pennsylvania Railroad’s construction of the electrified right of way that commuters ride over today. As Amtrak launches massive infrastructural projects to replace the Portal Bridge and North River Tunnels, Alff's talk looks back at the long history that brought us to the present, and what it means for the Garden State’s transit future.\n\n27 years ago, Pete Putman and his son Ross set off to explore the remnants of the New York Ontario & Western Railway. Starting in Cornwall, New York, they traveled westward as far as Cadosia and made a separate side trip from Summitville to Kingston, photographing the old right of way, bridges, tunnels, and station sites. This presentation shows what they found, 40 years after the O&W shut down in 1957. Topographic maps from the 1940s will illustrate where the tracks used to go. These trips formed the basis for the O&W Railway Historical Society's \"Virtual Bus Tours.\" Not surprisingly, many of the O&W remnants they found are no longer there 64 years on and are only preserved as images as more and more of the road fades into the mists of time. Still, these explorations turned out to be wonderful father-and-son bonding trips that still bring back great memories, over a quarter-century later.\n\nApril 2024:\n\nJust a Short Line: Stories & Anecdotes\n\nThe Rahway Valley Railroad was a colorful short line that operated in northern New Jersey for much of the last century. For the past several years, author and historian (and Tri-State President) Richie King has been researching and collecting everything he can about this little railroad. In an effort to share what has been found, Tri-State is hosting occasional programs on the Rahway Valley Railroad as part of the Just a Short Line series. In this program, King shares the more amusing side of the Rahway Valley through the laughable anecdotes, harrowing tales, and sardonic letters he has collected. You’ll learn about the lazy conductor, the kids of the railroad, the tale of the engineer’s ill-fated pie, the firebug, calamities with cars, and much more. You’ll be sure to let out a laugh, or two.\n\nFebruary 2024:\n\nDown the Line with Dr. Lenny: NJ's Transformational Years\n\nDr. Leonard Kaplonski was born in Newark, New Jersey in 1948. Growing up near the PRR Main Line, he developed a lifelong interest in trains, and particularly in photographing what was around him. After leaving New Jersey to pursue a medical degree, he arrived back on the scene in 1976 to capture one of the most significant changes in the railroad industry to date - the creation of Conrail. Between the formation of Amtrak and the creation of Conrail, the rails of the entire northeastern United States would be forever altered - a process of mergers, rationalizations, and reductions that continues through the present day was set in motion. The once incredibly colorful diversity of New Jersey's keystones, statues, and diamonds gave way to blue, and then a mix of platinum mist, black, white, blue and gold. With so many notable milestones having occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, this presentation is a fun look back at the infancy of today's railroad scene.\n\nJoin us as we take a walk down the line with Dr. Lenny and revisit many familiar locations, seeing what was, and what was about to disappear - all with the benefit of now having seen what was to become.\n\nJanuary 2024:\n\nNew Jersey’s Up-and-Coming Rail Photographers\n\nThe November meeting featured a presentation by Warwick, NY native and current Trainmaster, Alan Held, on the long and storied history of the L&HR. Mr. Held discussed the early history, operations, and motive power, as well as current operations on the former bridge line. Located in picturesque Warren, Sussex, and Orange Counties, the Lehigh & Hudson River was a Class I carrier with major haulage, yet the feel of a home-town railroad. This presentation features rare images from the L&HR archives as well as never before seen maps. Whether you are new to the L&HR or you have some familiarity, there is something for everyone in this in-depth look at a lesser-known fallen flag.\n\nOCTOBER 2023:\n\nTHE KID FROM FREEVILLE\n\nDanny Armitage grew up in Freeville, NY where two branches of the Lehigh Valley Railroad crossed. From the age of 5 he hung out at the freight station behind his house getting to know all of the trainmen. This led to an unusual childhood of literally growing up on the railroad. From 1963 until the mid-1980s he rode the locomotives and cabooses over 400 times and was accepted by the crews as one of their own. For 26 years, Dan resided in the Ovid area and worked for 30 years at the Willard Psychiatric Center and Willard Drug Treatment Center. This afforded him time to study both the Willard Asylum and US Army Depot railroads. Dan now resides in Marathon, NY, with his wife Joan Portzline. His program of lecture and slides is titled: The Kid from Freeville: Growing up on the Railroad and has been presented all over central NY, covering the people and operations of the Lehigh Valley Railroad from a very unique perspective.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2023:\n\nCNJ Night at Tri-State\n\nFor the September meeting, we were joined by long-time a long-time Tri-Stater, Frank Reilly. He worked for the Central Railroad of New Jersey, and will took us on a tour from the Jersey City roundhouse to the coal mines of Pennsylvania, and everything in-between.\n\nFrank started working for the CNJ in early 1966 and as a railfan he always had his camera with him. He even convinced management to let him create a Know Your CNJ slide show in 1969 to familiarize new managers coming over from the B&O. He got two weeks to produce this show as well as unlimited slide film and support from officials throughout the CNJ. Frank also had his pass embossed with the words, “Good on any train or engine” and he made good use of it, which included being in a train wreck!\n\nJUNE 2023:\n\nGREY, MAROON & YELLOW\n\nThe June meeting featured a presentation by past president Mike Del Vecchio. He chose a couple of repaints and restorations near and dear to the club. First is NS 1700, repainted in its original as-delivered livery as part of Norfolk Southern's 30th Anniversary festivities. The 1700 would appear daily at Bayway where Del Vecchio could take many pictures of it. Next is a presentation about Tri-State's F3 in Scranton, \"Lackawanna 663.\" It arrived in Scranton in 2009 looking like the scrap yard was next, but a team of more than 50 Tri-Staters and hundreds of financial contributors restored it to where today it is a national treasure and part of the oldest, unaltered and operating set of F-units in the world. Join us to see this world-class effort that created what TRAINS Magazine's readers in 2013 voted as \"Must See Diesels.\"\n\nMAY 2023:\n\nL&HR and SUSIE-Q\n\nFor our May 2023 meeting, we were joined by prolific photographer and Railpace editor Tom Nemeth. He will gave us an interesting look at the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad and Lehigh & Hudson River Railway in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe NYS&W was a struggling New Jersey railroad that had retreated to Butler, NJ in 1971 and declared bankruptcy in 1976. We take a look at Susie-Q’s operations with a fleet of aging Alcos and its yellow-jacket EMD GP-18s.\n\nThe L&HR was a bridge route operating between Allentown, PA and Maybrook, NJ, operated with a fleet of Alco C420s.\n\nAPRIL 2023:\n\nRAILROADS OF LAKE HOPATCONG\n\nIn an age before jets, air conditioning and super highways, Lake Hopatcong was a major northeast resort. Within easy reach of large cities to the east, the lake’s size and setting at over 900 feet above sea level made it a perfect summer destination. Boasting over 40 hotels, two amusement parks, and all types of entertainment, Lake Hopatcong welcomed thousands each year, including leaders in government, industry and entertainment. Lake Hopatcong’s rise as a resort was the result of two major railroads serving and promoting the lake. This program looks at the Central Railroad of New Jersey’s opening of rail service to the Nolan’s Point section of Lake Hopatcong in 1882 and the Lackawanna Railroad efforts to compete by having their trains connect to waiting steamboats which took passengers directly to their Lake Hopatcong destination through the Morris Canal. It also looks at how rail service played a major role in the ice, iron, and explosives industries at the lake.\n\nMARCH 2023:\n\nSTEVE BARRY’S FAVORITE PHOTOS OF 2022\n\nThe US Army's Picatinny Arsenal is located in the Highlands of northwestern Morris County. Picatinny is situated on approximately 5,853 acres and stretches northwards from Route 15 towards Green Pond. The Arsenal specializes in the research, development, acquisition and lifecycle of advanced conventional weapon systems and ammunition. The Cultural Resources Program (CRP) located in the Environmental Affairs Division of the Directorate of Public Works manages the historic structures, buildings, districts, and archaeological sites located across the Arsenal.\n\nWe were joined by Jason Huggan and Jeff Ranu. Their presentation demonstrates a historical background of Picatinny Arsenal’s Railroads that were used to transport ammunition, equipment, and personnel across the installation, along with the Wharton & Northern Railroad, which was installed starting in 1887 with a 99-year lease. At one time, Picatinny had over 42 miles of railroads across the installation.\n\nDECEMBER 2022:\n\nTRI-STATE’S FIRST PRESIDENT\n\nOur December meeting featured a digital visit from Tri-State first president, Mike Wikman. Now aged 88, he had hired out on the Lackawanna in 1955 as a towerman and soon landed in engine service. From there, his railroad career went to the EL, CNJ, Amtrak and a host of shortlines as either a manager or consultant. In 1979 he was the engineer on the Amtrak train that traversed the Cut-off from Port Morris to Scranton. He, Ray Storey and Tom Taber the elder helped form Tri-State in 1964. Mike has been everywhere and has a vivid memory, and he carried a camera. Today he lives in San Antonio.\n\nNOVEMBER 2022:\n\nRise & Fall of the Raritan River - Part II\n\nAt its peak, the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad described itself as “mile for mile, the most highly developed in the world.” The Lackawanna had entered the 20th century with the goal of becoming a super railroad, giving its president, William H. Truesdale, a mandate to make it so. The crowning achievement of this period of incredible period of capital improvement was the Lackawanna Cutoff, a 28-mile section of 70 MPH railroad of monumental viaducts, cuts, and fills. For the October meeting, we were joined by Chuck Walsh and Keith Smollin who gave an overview of the Cutoff’s history, including its construction between 1908 and 1911. They also discussed the current efforts and developments in reactivating the Cutoff for commuter service.\n\nChuck Walsh first became fascinated with the Lackawanna as a kid growing up next to the Morris & Essex in South Orange, NJ, being able to watch trains like the Phoebe Snow.. Chuck joined the North Jersey Rail Commuter Association in 1985, a group which helped spearhead the effort for the State of New Jersey to acquire the Cutoff in 2001. Chuck was a founding member of the Penn-Jersey Rail Coalition and, later, the Lackawanna Cutoff Historical Committee. Chuck and his daughter, Larissa, who is a videographer (who has made a couple of very brief cameo appearances), started the Lackawanna Cutoff channel on YouTube in 2016 and have thus far produced over 50 videos related to the Cutoff.\n\nKeith Smollin has been a lifelong railfan and has been associated with the Maywood Station Museum along the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad since its inception in 2001. Keith holds a BA in History from William Paterson University and teaches History and English in Union City, NJ. Keith is a founding member of the Lackawanna Cutoff Historical Committee, founded in 2013 to preserve the Greendell station.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2022:\n\nTHE LEHIGH VALLEY ACROSS NEW JERSEY\n\nFrom its earliest origins as the New Jersey Midland Railway in the 1870s, the New York, Susquehanna & Western has been an integral piece of the northern New Jersey rail network. Stretching from the Hudson River in Jersey City and Edgewater westward to Stroudsburg, PA and beyond via its subsidiary, the Wilkes-Barre & Eastern, the NYS&W formed a vital east-west link across the state. Despite cutting its west end back to Hainesburg, NJ in 1941, the railroad continued to flourish during World War II. Using funds from the influx of wartime traffic, NYS&W became the first Class I railroad in the U.S. to fully dieselize (accomplished in June of 1945). Following the recession of 1957 and the abandonment of the connecting Lehigh & New England in 1961, the NYS&W abandoned its line west of the Lehigh & Hudson River connection in Sparta, NJ. Commuter service ended entirely in 1966, and the railroad’s limited freight operations were cut back in 1968 from Sparta to Oak Ridge and again in 1971 from Oak Ridge to Butler. The NYS&W operated as a down-on-its-luck shortline into the 1980s, when it was famously revived by Walter Rich and the Delaware Otsego Corporation as a powerful Class II regional carrier. This presentation, covering the railroad from east to west, showcases never-before-seen images from the NYS&W’s earliest diesels in the 1940s through the railroad’s first decade under Delaware Otsego ownership. Carolyn Hoffman and Jon Berkemeyer, authors of a forthcoming book series on the NYS&W, provide a thorough look at the railroad’s locations and motive power during these tumultuous decades. They are joined by Rudy Garbely, who will help to present locations and photos from future books in this series covering the western portions of the “Susie-Q”.\n\nJUNE 2022:\n\nJUST A SHORT-LINE MAN: THE STORY OF GEORGE A. CLARK\n\nFor the June 2022 meeting, we were joined by author, historian, and Tri-State President Richie King. King has spent years researching the Rahway Valley Railroad, a small neighborhood short-line that operated in Union County, New Jersey during the last century. The railroad enjoyed a long and colorful history of hauling freight to the numerous consignees along its 11.8-mile route. However, perhaps the most interesting part of the railroad’s story is that of its long-time President & General Manager: George A. Clark.\n\nKing presents an in-depth look at George A. Clark, a complicated man known for his unique brand of opinion, profanity, and sarcasm - as well as his generosity, work ethic, and level of attention to just about everyone and everything. The presentation follows Clark’s life from his birth in Rochester, NY, through his formative years in Oregon, to his nearly fifty year career with the Rahway Valley. We also see some of Clark’s most pungent literary creations, his famous calendars, and some of the many letters he received from railfans. King also touches upon the lives of Clark’s father and son, who also served as President and General Manager of the railroad in their own day. The show was certainly a crowd pleaser, eliciting a laugh or two, and demonstrates just what it took to run a one-horse railroad.\n\nMay 2022:\n\nSTEAM TRAINS OF YESTERYEAR: THE MONADNOCK, STEAMTOWN & NORTHERN STORY\n\nAmongst the many chapters of American railroad preservation during the whirlwind 1960s comes the wild story of a plucky operation and the legacies it created. It's the story of a man: F. Nelson Blount, whose wild dreams inspired and bewildered. It's a story of characters: railroad men, photographers, preachers, politicians, and enthusiasts. It's the story of places: small rural villages, tranquil lakes, and rugged mountains. It's a story of twists, dreams, tragedy, disappointment, and success. And it's a story of machines: the steam trains of yesteryear, a dying breed brought back to life. From the author of Steam Trains of Yesteryear: The Monadnock, Steamtown & Northern Story comes a multimedia presentation bringing this amazing tale to life. This presentation will navigate F. Nelson Blount's exploits from 1960 to 1967, namely his Monadnock, Steamtown & Northern Railroad, and its early operations on the Claremont & Concord Railway, the Boston & Maine Railroad’s Cheshire Branch, and the former Rutland Railroad in Vermont. Also to be discussed are the subsequent political negotiations involving the search for a permanent home for Blount’s planned museum, “Steamtown USA”, and the start of his freight-hauling shortline, the Green Mountain Railroad. Tying it all together are the first steps down a long road leading to today's Steamtown National Historic Site. Illustrating the story will be rare photographs, 8mm film, primary documents, and testimony from those who made history.\n\nAPRIL 2022:\n\nTHE PEOPLE BEHIND THE TRAINS\n\nHow do you make stories of rail history and preservation approachable to a general audience? Nick Ozorak is a lifelong railfan who grew up in northwestern Pennsylvania with a strong interest in sharing his passion with others. He created his first online video series \"At The Railyard\" at the age of 17, designed to review train simulator products while exploring the prototype railroads they represented. In 2015, he began hosting \"The Roundhouse\" podcast, covering many topics in railroad history and preservation. Guests on his show have ranged from railroad presidents like Norfolk Southern's Wick Moorman and Strasburg Railroad's Linn Moedinger to model railroad industry experts like Jason Shron of Rapido Trains and Stacey Walthers Naffah of Walthers Trains. Nick discusses some of the guests he's had on the show, how he plans his interviews, and why sharing our stories matters.\n\nMARCH 2022:\n\nHANFORD MILLS MUSEUM\n\nRailroads are well known for the prosperity they brought to many towns across the United States. Sometimes, just the expectation of a new line is enough to spark economic development. For our March 2022 meeting, we were joined by Luke Murphy of the Hanford Mills Museum who presented the history of Hanford Mills, the hamlet of East Meredith, NY, and how both the mill and surrounding area anticipated the arrival of the Ulster & Delaware Railroad. The presentation also featured the museum's current operation as a historic water-and-steam powered saw mill.\n\nFEBRUARY 2022:\n\nSTEAM IN THE 2020S\n\nThe January 2022 meeting featured a presentation by Pierre Lacombe, retired geologist, who has investigated the stone sleepers of the Camden & Amboy Rail Road and about twenty other early-1830s railroads. Construction of New Jersey's pioneer railroad, the Camden & Amboy, began in late-1830 and service began in Fall 1831. The railroad opened between the Delaware River and Raritan Bay in Fall 1832. About 100,000 stone sleepers were used in its construction. Lacombe mapped the location, rock types, and constructions of more than 2,000 sleepers. The stones came from more than ten quarries in the Delaware and Hudson valleys. Various styles of roadbed used stone, wood and strap iron rail, stone and strap iron rail, and most importantly stone and rolled t-rail designed by Robert Stevens. The presentation includes information on original stone bridge abutments, stone culverts, and ballast.\n\nDECEMBER 2021:\n\nQUIET MONSTERS COMING TO LIFE\n\nWe were treated to a very special presentation about legendary photographer Donald W. Furler by his son Alan. Don's photography of the steam era featured perfect compositions on large format film, and during the steam era his work was among the best. His son Alan grew up in Glen Rock along the Erie Mainline and now lives in Cape May. He spent much of his youth trackside with his dad from near the end of the regular steam era and continuing with many later steam excursions. He developed his own love of trains, especially steam. His career in biomedical engineering focused on medical device R&D, and he retired in 2011 as a V.P. with a GE Medical business. In recent years he has focused on preserving his dad's collection. His presentation highlighted steam in the Tri-State area from the 1930s through the mid-50s. Alan donated his father's extensive work to the Center for Railroad Photography & Art, and he presented this show at CRPA's Annual Conference in 2018.\n\nNOVEMBER 2021:\n\nThe ROute of the Phoebe Snow with David Monte Verde\n\nThe November 11th meeting honored the 72nd anniversary of the inaugural of the famous Phoebe Snow passenger train with a presentation by Genesee Valley Transportation president David Monte Verde. A native of Dansville, NY., along the Route of Phoebe Show, Monte Verde has many memories of meeting the Lackawanna trains at the station while growing up. He looks at the history of the Phoebe Snow character and the route over which it traveled, from the Hoboken water front through the many scenic wonders such as the Delaware Water Gap and the Poconos. Included are some views of the detours in the wake of Hurricane Diane in 1955. With more than 200 images, this was not a show to miss.\n\nOCTOBER 2021:\n\nCONRAIL BUSINESS & RESEARCH TRAINS\n\nWITH WES REMINDER & BROCK KERCHNER\n\nFor our October 2021 meeting, we were joined by Wes Reminder and Brock Kerchner - the foremost authority on Conrail Business & Research Trains. For all 23 years of Conrail's tenure (1976-1999), the railroad maintained a fleet of specialized railcars and locomotives equipped to \"test the condition of [its] track, allow Conrail’s management to inspect the right of way and facilities at the ground level, and show customers and potential customers exactly how their freight [would] move.” The specialized railcars in this fleet were split between Conrail's business train (often called the Office Car Special, or OCS) and the railroad’s research and track department.\n\nResearchers Brock Kerchner and Wes Reminder teamed up to virtually present \"Conrail Business & Research Trains\" for the Tri-State Railway Historical Society. This presentation was based on their comprehensive and definitive book of the same name, slated for release by The Garbely Publishing Company. The presentation and the forthcoming hardcover book, anticipated to reach 400 pages, will include the authors’ three decades of combined research.\n\nEach railcar and locomotive in Conrail's special equipment fleet is covered, with original diagrams and drawings as well as photographs depicting the interiors and exteriors of the railroad's opulent business cars and its specialized research equipment. With every specialized operation came specialized employees, and Conrail's business and research trains were no exceptions. From the mechanical staff that rebuilt and maintained the cars to the on-board management that ensured their smooth operation, this presentation will feature information and stories gleaned from interviews with the major players in Conrail's special equipment staff. These accounts are accompanied by rare photographs showing these unique and memorable trains under construction, in operation, and even in a foreign country! The presentation will also cover the Conrail Technical Services Laboratory and the special railcars equipped for the Conrail Police Department.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2021:\n\nWHAT’S THE REST OF THE STORY? WITH TOM NANOS\n\nFor September, we were joined by accomplished photographer Tom Nanos whose show asks the question, “What’s the rest of the story?” Photos themselves typically tell a story visually, but a lot of them also have a series of events or circumstances that lead up to the moment the shutter is tripped and some continue on after the photo is committed to the camera.\n\nTom selected a number of photos from his two decades of railroad photography around the Southern New England region that have interesting stories around them. Some humorous, some a little embarrassing and a couple that involve personal injury. One example is the show’s promotional photo of a Massachusetts Bay Railroad Enthusiasts charter on the Providence & Worcester which resulted in a visit to the emergency room… but not until after he got the shot. You'll have to watch the show to get the rest of THAT story.\n\nSince 2001, Tom has combined his passion for photography with his childhood love of railroads to become an accomplished rail photographer. His work has been featured in numerous publications and he is a member of The Center of Railroad Photography & Art.\n\nAUGUST 2021:\n\nWRECK OF THE BROKER WITH GORDON BOND\n\nOn the drizzly evening of February 6, 1951, the Pennsylvania Railroad commuter train known as \"The Broker\" derailed in Woodbridge, New Jersey, killing 85 and injuring hundreds in what remains the deadliest railroad accident in the state's history. Communities all along the Jersey Shore were shaken by the sudden and violent loss of family and friends. What happened was self-evident from the mangled railcars and bodies. Why was another matter and would lead investigators to delve deep into the inner workings of the self-proclaimed \"Standard Railroad of the World.\"\n\nHistorian and author Gordon Bond joined us to give a presentation about this tragedy drawn from his book, \"MAN FAILURE: The Story of New Jersey's Deadliest Train Wreck.\" He has recently published a second edition of the book that includes an appendix of new material people provided after it the first edition published, including some never-before-published photos! His book can be purchased here.\n\nJULY 2021:\n\nNORTHEAST CORRIDOR WITH TODD DEFEO\n\nJuly 2021 included an extra, second presentation on the Northeast Corridor with author Todd DeFeo.\n\nThe Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington is perhaps the single most significant stretch of railroad in the country, connecting dozens of cities like Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. The line carries thousands of passengers daily on a mix of long-distance, regional, and commuter trains. Before it emerged as a vital stretch of railway, some of the earliest railroads in America created a foundation for the future corridor. They constructed a patchwork of lines that laid the groundwork for the Northeast Corridor of today, which later formed integral portions of the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad. The impact of this line is still felt in the many communities that developed along the tracks. While the Northeast Corridor continues to evolve, it remains as relevant as it was when the original developers conceived the rail link nearly two centuries ago.\n\nTodd DeFeo has studied railroads since growing up alongside the Northeast Corridor in New Jersey. He is editor of Railfanning.org and founder of The DeFeo Groupe. The images that help make up the visual history in this book come from some of the many libraries, museums, and organizations dedicated to preserving railroad history, the archives of Railfanning.org, and the author’s collection.\n\nJULY 2021:\n\nNORTHEAST CORRIDOR WITH ADAM REICH\n\nEntertainment for the April 2021 meeting came from a fellow NRHS constituent, the Raritan River Chapter. Tom Reynolds is President of the chapter and discusses the history of the Raritan River Rail Road from its inception and building in the late-1880s through its assimilation into Conrail in 1980. His presentation covers various points in this short-line railroad’s history, including competition for passenger traffic in the 1890s, growth and expansion of freight tonnages, both booms and busts, and the final takeover by Conrail. He also includes some history of the railroad’s role in silent movies, including showing of a silent film from 1910 recently restored in Amsterdam as well as a recently discovered clip of a train crashing into a car at Parlin about 1913.\n\nMARCH 2021:\n\nLIFE & WORK OF O. WINSTON LINK with LYNSEY ALLIE\n\nFor the March 11th meeting, we were joined by Lynsey Allie of the O. Winston Link Museum in Roanoke, VA. O. Winston Link is known worldwide for his unique style of photography that captured the final days of steam power on the Norfolk & Western; he also lived a most interesting life. Link’s career spanned several decades and still influences and inspires photographers more than sixty years later. The presentation begins with Link’s first job at a drugstore, developing film, to his inclusion in Vanity Fair’s Top 80 most-influential photographers in 2000. This presentation will take a closer look at Link’s life and work as well as the founding of his namesake museum.\n\nFebruary 2021:\n\nSteam, Steam, Steam! with Dennis A. Livesey\n\nIn this presentation spanning a 45-year timeline, Dennis A. Livesey explores just what fire, water, and steel is all about. Fascinated by the steam locomotive from the age of five, he has repeatedly sought it out, trying his utmost to unearth what attracts him to this; man’s first machine that tells you at every turn it is alive.\n\nLong ago, Dennis Livesey saw the light. He is not sure if it was a New Haven Railroad headlight or his father’s slide projector but in either event, he was bitten both by railroads and photography. A graduate of NYU Film School, he had a 34-year career as a camera technician in the movies. Along the way, he convinced an incredible lady named Mel to marry him and raise two outstanding children. Now a camera specialist for a large camera retailer and a volunteer conductor at Steamtown, he photographs trains whenever the light is right.\n\nJanuary 2021:\n\nBridge Line to New England & Canada with Rudy Garbely\n\nThe January 14th meeting featured a presentation by publisher and author Rudy Garbely on the Delaware & Hudson Railway.\n\nGarbely is currently working on a book covering the D&H from 1968 to 1991 based primarily on employee interviews, stories, and recollections. The regional railroad was large enough to be a major player in Northeastern railroading (especially after Conrail was formed in 1976), but small enough to retain the friendly “family” atmosphere of local short lines. Garbely has collected the oral histories of past D&H brakemen all the way up to presidents and everyone in between, and has amassed a fantastic collection of photos in the process that he will share in this presentation.\n\nGarbely is the owner and President of GPCo. He has authored seven GPCo books on railroad history and is currently working on this D&H book along with other additional projects.\n\nDecember 2020:\n\nFreight OpS on the Rahway Valley RR with richie king\n\nThe December 2020 meeting features a deep dive into freight operations on the Rahway Valley Railroad. Tri-State owns the two Rahway Valley 70-tonners and this presentation takes a look at this quirky short-line's daily freight operations. Customers the railroad served are also featured, as well as an abundance of humorous anecdotes.\n\nMost, if not all, the information is from extensive interviews Richie King conducted with Walt Switz, who started his railroad career on the Rahway Valley in 1966. A number of Switz's own photographs are also featured... as well as a surprise appearance at the end. Richie has authored two books on the railroad and is working on a third on facilities, industries, and operations, he also serves as Tri-State's Treasurer."
