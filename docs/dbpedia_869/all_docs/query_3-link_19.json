Auranie (Albany) sailed down the Delaware River.\n\n1633: Devries reports traveling up the unnamed (Rancocas) creek in this year.\n\n1634: Captain Young reports traveling up the unnamed (Rancocas) creek in this year.\n\n1655: The Swedes name the creek, Rancoqueskill in this year.\n\n1677: Richard Fenimore arrived from England aboard the Kent and established a farm in the Beverly-Delanco area below the original Jacob Perkins farm. This acreage would later become a major portion of modern Delanco Township.\n\n1681: The survey done in this year was the first to mention the Ancocas-Rancocas Creek by name. The English tried to change the name to Northampton River, but the Indian name for the waterway (originally Ancocas) was preferred.\n\n1681: Court was established in West Jersey.\n\nNovember 6, 1688: Burlington County, one of the four counties in West Jersey, was organized into nine townships, one of which was Wellingborrow (also spelled Wellingborough and later, Willingboro). It was established on the north shore of the Rancocas River to the Delaware River by a group of English Quakers. The Township included all settlements south of Burlington, including the present day towns of Willingboro and the riverfront communities of Edgewater Park, Beverly, and Delanco. Wellingborough was named for the town, which the Quaker congregants left in England.\n\n1694: Burlington County was formed of the union of the first and second Tenths. It consisted of Burlington, Chester, Chesterfield, Evesham, Mansfield, Northampton, Nottingham, Springfield, and Willingboro townships.\n\n1702: Ferry Service on the Rancocas Creek at Bridgeboro. The minutes of Province of NJ mentions the ferry service.\n\n1747: Ferry service was established across the Rancocas Creek at Bridgeboro. The service operated until the first pier bridge was built at that location in 1873.\n\n1748: The Colonial Assembly authorized the laying out of a Great Road from Burlington to Cooper’s Ferries. Bridges were a rarity, and in the 1750s travelers on this route encountered four ferries between Burlington and Philadelphia: on the Rancocas River, Pennsauken Creek, Cooper River, and Delaware River. A century later the route was improved and designated as a toll road. The highway was later designated NJ Route 2, then NJ 25, then US Highway 130.\n\n1748: John Buzby established a ferry on the Great Road over the Rancocas River. It was supported by tolls and operated by the Buzby family until 1793 when the first bridge across the Rancocas opened at the same location. It was regarded as the Lower Ferry to distinguish it from the Adam's Wharf Ferry farther upstream.\n\n1756: 350 acres of Richard Fenimore’s farm were devised by will to his descendant, Joseph Fenimore. The Fenimore farm would later become a major portion of modern Delanco Township.\n\n1767: Samuel and Mary Folwel Newton acquired 430 acres of farmland along the north bank of the Rancocas Creek. It included much of what would later become Delanco Township.\n\n1787: Connecticut-born inventor, John Fitch created a practical steam-powered paddleboat. After several modifications, Fitch established regular packet boat service in 1787 between Philadelphia and Trenton. Fitch’s service lasted only a single season and did not recoup enough revenue to be considered profitable, but it was a clear precursor of an age of steam that would reign for the next century on the Delaware River. It attracted the interest of Benjamin Franklin who served as President of the American Steamboat Company in 1789. By comparison, Robert Fulton did not establish service on the Hudson River until 1807; however Fulton’s service between New York City and Albany began turning a profit from the outset.\n\n1793: The first bridge was built on the Great Road over the Rancocas River, replacing Buzby’s ferry, which had been in operation since 1748. It was a timber span with covered sections built on each end and an open span in the center. It was built by Burlington County government and maintained by tolls. The community that was first established at Buzby’s ferry came to be known as Bridgeboro, in Chester Township, now known as Delran Township. The bridge remained in operation until 1838 when it was replaced by an open bridge structure.\n\n1795-1801: William Cooper, the husband of Elizabeth Fenimore and father of John Fenimore Cooper, is elected to the Fourth and Sixth US Congress representing Otsego County in upstate New York. Congress, at that time, was seated in Philadelphia. In 1795 William Cooper returned to Burlington County and built a grand riverbank home as befitting a congressman. During the home’s construction the family likely rented a home in Burlington City. William commuted to Philadelphia by boat in fair weather. He served two terms of office separated by one term out of office. His son, future author James Fenimore Cooper, spent much of his young life from age 6 to age12 living here. Tradition places the Cooper estate on the Delaware riverbank in what is now Delanco, just west of present day Union Avenue. The estate was sold about 1801 and the family returned to Cooperstown, New York. Elizabeth Cooper continued to spend winters in a rented property in Burlington City.\n\nFeb 21, 1798: Wellingborough incorporated as Willingborough Township.\n\n1812: Colonel John Stevens urges construction of a New York City – Philadelphia railroad.\n\n1812: During the War of 1812, Philadelphia industrialist Stephen Girard repositioned many of his vessels from Philadelphia to more secure anchorage on the Rancocas Creek, just above where the railroad bridge is today. The ships managed to avoid detection by British naval forces.\n\n1815: Colonel Stevens obtains a charter to connect New York City and Philadelphia.\n\n1817: Colonel Stevens obtains a charter to connect the Raritan and Delaware Rivers via canal.\n\n1823: The Philadelphia, Rancocas & Mt. Holly Steamboat Company was formed and began regular service on the Rancocas Creek. The Norristownwas reported to be the first steamboat to provide service.\n\n1825: The steamboat Lafayette began service for the Philadelphia, Rancocas & Mt. Holly Steamboat Company on the Rancocas Creek.\n\n1828: The Heaton family purchased farmland on the Delaware River south of Beverly from the Fenimores.\n\n1828: A new toll drawbridge is built to carry the Great Road over the Rancocas Creek. It replaces the 1793 toll bridge.\n\n1830: Colonel Stevens Obtains a Charter from the New Jersey Legislature to construct the Camden & Amboy Railroad. The same day he obtained a charter to construct the Delaware & Raritan Canal.\n\nFebruary 1831: Right of way for the newly chartered Camden & Amboy Railroad is surveyed. The northern section follows the route of the Bordentown-Amboy Turnpike (now US Hwy 130).\n\nJune 1831: The locomotive John Bull arrives in America. It was constructed in England, then disassembled and shipped to Stevens shop in Bordentown in pieces. Stevens Chief Mechanic, Isaac Dripps assembles the locomotive in 11 days without benefit of instructions, and without having ever seen a steam locomotive, however Dripps had previous experience with steam engines in steamboat applications.\n\nAugust 1831: The northern section of the Camden and Amboy Railroad, the first line to be laid in the State of New Jersey, was begun between Bordentown and South Amboy. It was later extended from Bordentown to Camden, through the farmland that was to become modern Delanco, a total distance of sixty-two miles. All records of early railroad construction agree that this ancient stretch of track was the first in New Jersey, and one of the first to be laid anywhere in the United States.\n\n1831: The Camden & Amboy Railway changed the design of its coaches to 4-wheel bogeys. The earlier “European design” was found to be ill-suited for the wilder American terrain.\n\n1832: John Stevens and the Camden-Amboy Railroad completed a wooden trestle and iron railroad bridge over the Rancocas River between Delanco and Riverside. The center span was built as a lift section to permit steamboats and sailing vessels to travel up the Rancocas River. This completed its route from Bordentown to Camden, connecting the Delaware River towns with Camden and ferry service to Philadelphia in the south to Bordentown, and eventually, Perth Amboy and ferry service to New York City in the north. Stevens had to import the iron rails from England. He designed the classic inverted “T” design during his crossing to England. He returned to Bordentown with the necessary rails loaded aboard 23 sailing ships.\n\nNovember 28, 1832: The first Camden-Amboy Railway train made its first trip through the area from Bordentown to Camden. John Stevens purchased a wood-burning steam locomotive from George & Robert Stephenson Co. in Newcastle-on-Tyne by in England. It was disassembled and shipped to Bordentown aboard a sailing ship, then reassembled by Stevens’ young mechanic, Isaac Dripps in a matter of days, without benefit of plans. The locomotive was designated No.1 and named Stevens, but gained the nickname “John Bull” for its years of reliable service. It remained in regular operation until 1864. Availability of comfortable and reliable passenger service signaled the beginning of a 20-year period of growth and development of river towns Florence, Delanco, Riverside, Riverton, and Palmyra. In all but the coldest weather, passengers traveling south departed the train at Burlington and transferred to steamboat for the remainder of the journey. When the Delaware froze, passengers ran through to Camden where they completed the journey to Philadelphia by ferryboat. Year-round service began in the 1840s\n\nJanuary 1834: The Camden & Amboy Railway completes trackage from South Amboy to Camden, a distance of 61 miles. The fare is $3.00 via steam-drawn coach. Passenger service from Camden to South Amboy begins.\n\n1834: The first delivery of US Mail was carried by train from Philadelphia to New York City.\n\n1834: The Camden & Amboy Railway completes its expansion route from the Y at Bordentown to Trenton.\n\n1836: The Camden & Amboy Railway changed the design of its passenger coaches from the initial triple “stagecoach” design to the more familiar long coaches with bench seating.\n\n1838: A new pier bridge was built across the Rancocas at Bridgeboro on the route of the Great Road, replacing the 1793 covered bridge. The 1838 bridge served for almost fifty years, and was replaced by a concrete and steel drawbridge in 1927.\n\n1843: A US Coastal Survey identifies the area of the Delaware River off of the Hawk Island Cut as White Sheet Bay.\n\n1845: Richard F. Wilmerton obtained a charter for a village to be called Delaranco, which he planned to develop on his farmland. He created this name from an abridgement of Delaware River and Rancocas Creek. At that time, there were but a few scattered farmhouses and fishing shanties in the area. The new railway probably only stopped to take on water and wood and the occasional passenger. The Union Avenue wharf was yet to be built. It is unclear when the Poplar Avenue wharf on the Rancocas went into service.\n\nMarch 9, 1848: The Delanco Land Company officially incorporated for the purpose of developing residential housing on the riverfront of the village. There is still question as to where the name originated. Possibly it was a deliberate marketing creation by the corporation as a logical (and catchy) name for their new development. By 1857 the name was apparently applied to the entire village, replacing other suggested names (such as Delaranco and Del-Ranco).\n\nDecember 18, 1848: Abraham Perkins of Beverly deeded the Heaton Farm tract on the western tip of Willingboro Township to the Delanco Land Company. The tract was located on the Delaware River north of present day Burlington Avenue. The tract was laid out for residential housing. Members of the Land Company included several men from Philadelphia and the brothers Caleb and James Clothier whose large homes were built on Delaware Avenue just east and west of Walnut Street. Up to this time, the area was considered part of the town of Beverly. Streets and building lots were laid out, but little progress was made until 1852.\n\n1848: According to Barbara Frank Page, this is the date when Thomas Fletcher purchased 30 acres from Richard Wilmerton to establish a vineyard and winery.\n\n1849: The first Camden-Amboy railway station in the area was constructed on the bank of the Rancocas Creek at the head of Union Avenue. It consisted of a platform extending out onto the trestle, passenger and freight terminals, a watering tank, and coaling station. A bridgetender’s house was located just south of the station. The station was designated Rancocas Crossing or Rancocas Bridge until 1859 when the name was changed to Delanco.\n\n1849: Richard F. Wilmerton’s new residential development of Delaranco was first recognized as a town, developing north from the Rancocas Creek. The town’s other major developer was the Delanco Land Company which was attempting to develop south from the Delaware River. This latter development did not really gain ground until about 1852. The town was later unified under the name Delanco.\n\nMarch 5, 1850: Beverly Borough formed within Willingboro Township.\n\n1850: A wharf was constructed at the foot of Union Avenue in Delanco to serve as a landing for steam-powered packet ships. It could handle both passengers and cargo. During this era, Union Avenue served as the main street in Delanco because it ran from the steamboat wharf on the Delaware River south to the train depot near the Rancocas Creek. The wharf was built by Jacob Kreiner & Sons of Delanco. It served the community until about 1950 and was demolished in 1969.\n\n1851: Just across the Rancocas Creek the village of Goattown in Chester Township changed its name to Progress. It later changed its name to Riverside.\n\n1852: Richard F. Wilmerton, who secured a charter for his proposed town if Delaranco in 1849, published a map of Delaranco Lots in 1852. These lands were bounded roughly by the Rancocas Creek, Burlington Avenue, and Walnut Alley. A large portion of Wilmerton’s property west of Burlington Avenue to the “cut”, and south of Vine Street had been sold to Thomas Fletcher in 1848 for a vineyard and winery. That conveyance was considered the first done by deed in the State of New Jersey.\n\n1852: Richard F. Wilmerton established a steam-powered sawmill and lumber yard on the Rancocas riverbank at the foot of Poplar Street. The business passed out of service by 1883.\n\n1852: Henry Kreiner constructed a hotel and tavern on Rancocas Avenue, just across Railroad Avenue from the Camden & Amboy Railroad Station.The hotel and tavern operated for more than 65 years, ceasing operation in 1917, when the local option law went into effect and Delanco no longer allowed bars or any “thirst quenching” stations. The building was demolished in 1937.\n\nApril 1853: The bridge tender at the Rancocas Creek opened the swing span bridge for an approaching Philadelphia-bound steamboat, forgetting about the scheduled uptrain from Camden. The result of this error was the locomotive (of the Monster design) and two or three baggage cars in the bottom of the creek. No passengers sustained injuries or even got wet. It was a harrowing event, never-the-less.\n\n1853: Father John Neumann is reported to have traveled up the Rancocas Creek by boat, landed on the farm later owned by George Russ, and ridden through Delanco on his way to a meeting establishing St. Peter’s Parish in Riverside. Father John Neumann was beatified in 1963 and canonized by the Catholic Church as St. John Neumann in 1977. Later, George Russ constructed a family chapel near his farmhouse on the bank of the Rancocas commemorating the life of St. John Neumann.\n\n1853: Idea for a Delanco-Riverside bridge was first proposed by local farmers to help them get their produce to market more efficiently.\n\n1854: Nathan S. Crane established a shipyard along the Rancocas near the foot of Buttonwood Street.\n\nFebruary 1855: The remaining assets of the Delanco Land Company were sold at Sheriff’s Sale.\n\n1856: A one-room schoolhouse measuring 24 feet x 24 feet was built on Buttonwood Street in Delanco. It was the first school to open in Delanco. It was expanded to two classrooms in 1862.\n\n1856: Farnum School was established on Warren Street in Beverly by Paul Farnum, Esq. with an endowment of $70,000. Many children of Delanco attended Farnum School over the years.\n\nMarch 1, 1857: Beverly Borough was officially incorporated as a city within Wellingborough Township.\n\nApril 13, 1857: Beverly Borough became Beverly City by referendum.\n\nOctober 5, 1857: A United States Post Office was established in Delanco, Willingboro Township. Micajah Dobbins was named the first postmaster and the post office operated out of his general store at 400 Poplar Street, at the corner of Franklin. He served until 1860. This event served as the first official recognition of the name Delanco for the town.\n\nFebruary 25, 1858: The Delanco Methodist Society came together as the Methodist Episcopal Church of Delanco. The society had its roots in the Cooper Town Meeting House in Willingboro. In the early 1900s, the church adopted the name Dobbins Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church to honor Micajah Dobbins, an early parishioner.\n\nMarch 1, 1859: Beverly Township officially separated from Wellingborough Township using the Great Road as a boundary. Beverly City was included within Beverly Township. Beverly City did not separate from Beverly Township until 1877. Delanco was still regarded as a village, a rail and steamboat stop, and a post office within Beverly Township until this time.\n\n1859: R.K. Kuhn & J.D. Janney published their New Map of Burlington County. It included an inset for the village of Delanco. It also listed three Delanco merchants with the directory of Willingborough (sic) businesses: R.F. Wilmerton, Coal and Lumber; Micajah Dobbins, Dry Goods and Groceries; and Henry Kreiner, Pile Driver.\n\n1859: The Camden-Amboy Railroad was acquired by the United New Jersey Railroad & Canal Company. This company also operated the Delaware & Raritan Canal which ran between the Delaware River at Bordentown and the Raritan River in New Brunswick.\n\n1859: The original railroad station, known as Rancocas Bridge or Rancocas Crossing, was replaced with a new structure built on Railroad (Pennsylvania) Avenue near the foot of Walnut Street. The new station was named Delanco Station.\n\nAugust 29, 1860: Postal service was suspended in Delanco with the resignation of Isaac Buck as postmaster. It did not resume until December 14, 1860 when Samuel C. Deacon was appointed postmaster.\n\nSpring-Summer 1861: French inventor Brutus de Villeroi tested the 33-foot prototype of the submarine Alligator on the Rancocas Creek for three months. The vessel was equipped with a divers’ chamber to deploy and recover hard-hat divers while submerged. De Villeroi claimed the submarine was primarily built for undersea salvage operations and not for military purposes.\n\nMay 3, 1861: Commander Henry K. Hoff, USN was ordered to observe the trials of the Alligator prototype on the Rancocas Creek. Commander Hoff filed a formal report on his observations of the tests run on the prototype, reporting that “the services of the engineer would be very valuable to the Government, and the possession of his invention would be an acquisition of the greatest importance.” He suggested that having such a device would prove an excellent deterrent to a foreign nation.\n\nMay 16, 1861: The prototype Alligator submarine boat and two members of its crew were captured by Philadelphia port authorities while it was lying at anchor in the Delaware River. The interior of the vessel was inspected by a reporter from the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nJuly 1861: Three naval officers, Henry K. Hoff, Charles Steadman, and Robert Danby met in Delanco with French inventor Brutus DeVilleroi to examine Alligator, the prototype diving machine of his invention. The group recommended its acquisition by the US Navy as a counter measure against the expected deployment of Confederate ironclads.\n\n1861: The United New Jersey Railroad & Canal Company was acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad who took over the operation of railroad service in Delanco.\n\n1861: Railroad Avenue in Delanco was renamed Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nNovember 1861: Inventor Brutus de Villeroi was issued a US Naval contract to build a full-scale submersible warship based on the Alligatordesign tested in the Rancocas Creek earlier in the year.\n\nMay 1, 1862: The USS Alligator, the US Navy’s first submersible warship was launched at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.\n\n1862: The Delanco schoolhouse added a second classroom measuring 24 feet x 24 feet.\n\nApril 1863: The USS Alligator, the US Navy’s first submersible warship, was lost off Cape Hatteras during a fierce storm at sea. It was in the process of being towed to Charleston to be put into action against the Confederates.\n\n1864: Camden-Amboy Railway locomotive No.1, known as the “John Bull” was taken out of regular service after 32 years. It went into stationary operation for a time powering a sawmill, then was transferred to the Smithsonian Institute, but its work was not finished. It was taken from the museum several times and put back into limited service as a working exhibition. First at the American Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876, then at the World Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893. It was last taken out of the Smithsonian in 1981 and fired up, celebrating its remarkable 150-year history as a working steam locomotive.\n\n1865: The first public library was built.\n\n1866: Delanco was designated a Road District by the State Legislature. As such, it was empowered to elect a board of three commissioners and allocated funds to maintain roads, streets and other improvements.\n\n1867: The village of Progress changed its name to Riverside.\n\n1867: The United New Jersey Railroad & Canal Company was formed.\n\n1870: At the urging of local farmers led by Abraham Perkins, plans and funding for a Delanco-Riverside bridge were approved by County government. The result was the first wagon and passenger bridge constructed across the Rancocas River, connecting Pavilion Avenue in Riverside and Burlington Avenue in Delanco. It was 400 feet long with bowed truss spans set on masonry piers in the river. It used a 120-ft. cantilever draw to open for marine traffic. It was built by Moseley Bridge & Roof Co. at a cost of $50,000. It saved local farmers and businessmen doing business in Riverside a five mile trip upriver to cross at Bridgeboro. The route would later become part of Burlington County Route 543.\n\n1871: The Pennsylvania Railroad was formed and took over the assets of the Camden & Amboy Railroad. All records of early railroad construction agree that this ancient stretch of track was one of the first to be laid anywhere in the United States. In Delanco, Railroad Avenue was renamed Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nJuly 5, 1872: The steamboat Edwin Forest began service on the upper Delaware River with stops in Delanco.\n\n1873: The first pier bridge was constructed across the Rancocas Creek at Bridgeboro. It replaced ferry service that was discontinued after 126 years.\n\nMarch 1, 1874: The first church service was held in the new First Presbyterian Church, led by Rev. Martin Luther Hofford. The church was built on Union Avenue at the intersection of Franklin and Poplar across from the town square. It remains at location and has been remodeled and expanded several times.\n\nMay 19, 1876: The steamboat Nelly White came to the Delaware River from New York. It established a regular excursion route between Philadelphia and Bordentown with seven stops. It provided a convenient way for people to come to the Centennial in Philadelphia. Daniel S. Mershon was the first commander.\n\n1876: The Methodist Episcopal Church on Union Avenue in Delanco dedicated a new bell tower and steeple as an addition to its original building. The new church bell at the Methodist Episcopal Church was rung for the first time on New Year’s Eve.\n\n1877: Swiss-born industrialist Theophilus Zurbrugg arrived in Mount Holly in this year. He moved on to Philadelphia in 1880 to establish the Keystone Watch Case Company. He returned to Riverside in 1892 to build the Keystone Watch Case factory adjacent to the Pavilion Hotel on Pavilion Avenue.\n\n1877?: Beverly City separated from Beverly Township.\n\n1878: A human skeleton of a native-American was excavated from a farmer’s field and was kept on display in one of the local hotels until at least 1883.\n\n1880: The 1880 census disclosed that there were about 150 homes in Delanco, and a population of about 450.\n\n1881: The Methodist Episcopal Church was engaged in a battle with the town over liquor traffic. The temperance movement won, but the church lost membership.\n\n1881: Andress Ridgway began manufacturing children’s shoes in the garage of his home on Ash Street at the corner of Rancocas Avenue. He began with three employees.\n\n1883: Delanco Township erected a town hall on Town Square on Union Avenue between Chestnut and Hickory streets. This was the first of three town halls that have been built and used in Delanco to date. The building was demolished in 1952.\n\n1883: The sawmill on Poplar Street was no longer operating. It was later converted into a pickle factory and eventually burned down.\n\n1885: Andress Ridgway constructed a frame shoe factory at the foot of Ash Street. Ridgway built a second, brick structure in 1912. The frame structure was destroyed by fire in 1922.\n\nApril 19, 1890: Delanco Savings and Loan was established in town. Its first location was in the home of William Stickel on Burlington Avenue at Vine Street. It remained at that location until at least 1929, and later moved to 615 Burlington Avenue at the corner of Union Avenue.\n\n1890s: Electric lights and telephone service came to Burlington County.\n\n1890: A third classroom was added to the original schoolhouse.\n\n1892: Industrialist Theophilus Zurbrugg moved the headquarters and production facility for his Keystone Watch Case Company from Philadelphia to a new location adjacent to the Pavilion Avenue Hotel in Riverside. The company was a major employer in the area for many years. Many of his workers lived in Delanco and walked over the bridge to work.\n\n1893: The venerable “John Bull” steam-powered locomotive that had opened the Camden–Amboy railway service through Delanco in 1832 and retired in 1864, was once again taken from display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington to be put into limited service. It was run by railunder its own power to the World Columbian Exhibition in Chicago, where it was put on working display. Many dignitaries took the opportunity to ride this historic train. The locomotive was last taken out of the Smithsonian in 1981 and fired up, celebrating its remarkable 150-year history as a working steam engine.\n\nSummer 1897: Men of the Delanco Methodist Church held a summer camp meeting in a wooded lot at the corner of Burlington Avenue and Cooper Street known as Fletcher’s Grove. Attendees enjoyed the experience so much they solicited the church to make it an annual event.\n\nFebruary 22, 1898: Delanco’s first fire brigade was formed on Washington’s birthday. Founding members selected the name Washington Fire Co. The brigade was not incorporated until 1900.\n\nApril 1898: Rev. George Ridout and the men of Delanco Methodist Church convinced Charles E. Fletcher to sell Fletcher’s Grove, a 20-acre wooded parcel on Burlington Avenue for $4,000. The Fletchers Grove Camp Meeting Society incorporated to operate the camp. Participants initially stayed in tents and took their meals in a large dining tent.\n\nJune 24, 1898: The first camp meeting operated by the new Fletcher’s Grove Camp Meeting Association was held.
