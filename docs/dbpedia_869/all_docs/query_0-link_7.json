        "text": "1.1 The territory\n\nOn 03 February 2019, Canadian Pacific Railway Company (Canadian Pacific or CP) freight train 301-349 was travelling westward on the Laggan Subdivision, which runs from Calgary, Alberta (Mile 0.0) to Field, British Columbia (BC) (Mile 136.6).\n\nThe Laggan Subdivision is part of CP's main corridor to the west coast. It is one of several subdivisions through the Rocky and Cascade mountains characterized by steep grades and sharp curves. This route traverses some of the most challenging railway operating terrain in North America and is subject to environmental conditions that include extreme heat and cold, avalanches, rock slides, and slope destabilizations during spring runoff.\n\nThe route from Calgary to Stephen, BC (Mile 123.1), consists of a long gradual climb, followed by a steep descent at Field Hill.\n\nThe section of the Laggan Subdivision known as Field Hill runs 13.5 miles from Stephen to Field. It is designated as mountain gradeFootnote 7 and drops from an elevation of 5290 feet at Stephen to 4045 feet at Field. The descending grade varies between 1.7% and 2.2%.\n\nThe track through Field Hill goes through several tunnels and crosses the Kicking Horse River at Mile 130.6 between 2 spiral tunnels. The Upper Spiral Tunnel is 3255 feet long and extends from Mile 128.8 to Mile 129.5. The Lower Spiral Tunnel is 2922 feet long and extends from Mile 131.0 to Mile 131.5.\n\nThere are several sharp curves ranging from 8° to 10°, including back-to-back reverse curves. At Mile 130.2, the track has an 8.4° left-hand curve followed by a 7.9° right-hand curve; then, approaching the Kicking Horse River bridge, the curvature changes to a 9.8° left-hand curve.\n\nIn this occurrence, the train stopped in emergency at Partridge, BC (Mile 127.46). A few hours later, it started to roll on its own, uncontrolled. The head-end portion of the train derailed at Mile 130.6 (figures 1 and 2).\n\n1.2 The accident\n\nA summary of relevant events for this occurrence is provided in Table 1. A detailed timeline of the events that took place from the time the train stopped in emergency until it began to roll uncontrolled can be found in Table 2. Both of these tables are in section 1.2.4.\n\nA description of locomotive and freight car brakes is provided in Appendix A. Information on inspection and testing of air brake systems is provided in Appendix B.\n\n1.2.1 Before the emergency stop\n\nOn the morning before the occurrence, a CP train crew (the inbound crew)Footnote 8 was called at 1030Footnote 9 to report at Alyth Yard in Calgary for 1230. The crew was scheduled to operate freight train 301-349 westward on the Laggan Subdivision.\n\nThe train was a unit trainFootnote 10 hauling 112 loaded grain hopper cars. It weighed 15 042 tons and was 6676 feet long. It was powered by 3 distributed power (DP) locomotives—1 positioned at the head end, 1 in a mid-train position, and 1 on the tail end. The mid-train and tail-end locomotives were remote-controlled.Footnote 11\n\nEarlier in the day at around 1210, the train had arrived at Alyth Yard with 1 car cut out (line 101, CP 603181).Footnote 12 Prior to departure from Alyth Yard, the train underwent a No. 1 brake test.Footnote 13 The test identified defective brakes on 1 more car (line 27, CP 607409), which was also cut out. With the 2 cars cut out, the train was cleared to leave, about 60 minutes later than expected. With the brake systems on 2 of the 112 cars cut out, the train had 98% of its car brakes operative with a weight of 131.1 tons per operative brake.\n\nThe train departed Alyth Yard at approximately 1430. It was operating in extreme cold temperature; when it passed Mile 65.6, a wayside hot box detectorFootnote 14 alerted the crew that the ambient temperature was −27 °C.\n\nEn route, the crew members experienced several delays in their progress westward with reduced speed due to low ambient temperatures, switch malfunctions, and train meets that added to their trip time. The locomotive engineer (LE) noticed increases in air flow whenever he applied the air brakes along the route,Footnote 15 but the air brake system performed as expected.\n\nAt approximately 2136, the train began proceeding down the steep grade that starts at Mile 125.6. The train could not maintain a speed below the maximum allowable limit of 15 mph; as the speed reached 21 mph, the crew applied the brakes in emergency and the train came to a stop at Partridge at around 2149. From the train’s stop location, about 9 miles of descending 2.2% grade still remained ahead of the train before the grade would decrease to between 0.5% and 0.4% for about 9000 feet starting at Field.\n\n1.2.2 While stopped in emergency\n\nAt 2215, about 25 minutes after the train was stopped with an emergency brake application, the inbound crew and the trainmaster performed the required job briefing to assess the situation and determine the best course of action for recoveringFootnote 16 the emergency brake application. It was decided that the conductor would set the retaining valves (retainers)Footnote 17 to the high pressure (HP) position on 75% of the cars (84 cars), as required in the Field Hill operating procedures (FHOP), to facilitate a release and catch operation.Footnote 18 Because the inbound crew were close to the 10-hour limit of service in their collective agreement, the rail traffic control (RTC) director ordered a relief crew, who would take over control of the train and complete the trip to Field.\n\nThe members of the relief crew—an LE, a conductor, and a conductor trainee—were not immediately available; they were scheduled to come on duty at 2230. They had originally been ordered at Field to relieve another train and, at that time, the relief LE had opted to take a 2-hour advance callFootnote 19 (in accordance with his collective agreement) before coming on duty. Once en route, they travelled to Yoho by road vehicle, then were required to make the remainder of the trip to Partridge in a snow removal track unit.\n\nAt Yoho, the relief LE had a face-to-face job briefing with the trainmaster, who informed him of the decision to apply retainers on 84 of the train’s cars to assist in the safe recovery from the emergency brake application. Departing Yoho, the relief crew was further delayed as it was necessary to clear snow from a switch that led onto the main track.\n\nWhile waiting for the relief crew to arrive, the inbound conductor set the required retainers on 84 (75%) of the cars, as decided. The task, which was made more difficult by the mountainous terrain, the extreme cold, and the darkness, took approximately 1 hour. The conductor returned to the locomotive at approximately 2330.\n\nThe relief crew arrived at Partridge at 0005 on 04 February 2019, and reached the train at 0020, approximately 2.5 hours after it had stopped in emergency.\n\n1.2.3 The uncontrolled movement\n\nUpon taking control of the train, the members of the relief crew had a job briefing with the inbound crew in the lead locomotive, and no concerns were raised. The relief crew then waited, as the train could not proceed down the hill until a track occupancy permit was cancelled,Footnote 20 which required the snow removal track unit transporting the inbound crew to be clear of the Yoho east switch. The LE stated in conversation with the RTC that he would not recover the emergency brake application until it had been confirmed to him that the track ahead was not occupied.\n\nAt 0042, while the relief crew was still waiting, the train started to roll on its own and the LE made an emergency radio broadcast. The engineering personnel on the main track overheard the transmissions and responded that they would indicate when they were in the clear at Yoho. The RTC repeated the emergency call a number of times to warn the engineering personnel on the main track to get clear of the track as soon as possible. The LE also asked the RTC to clear trains from the main track at Field, which was done, and to evacuate the Field bunkhouse.\n\nWhen the train began its uncontrolled movement, the conductor and the conductor trainee left the locomotive cab with the intent to apply hand brakes to stop or slow the train; however, the train continued to accelerate and the LE told both crew members to return to the locomotive cab for their safety. They did not have an opportunity to apply any hand brakes. After the train was in motion, it accelerated rapidly and so it was not feasible to recover the emergency brake application.Footnote 21\n\nOnce the train entered the sharp curves on the descent, the LE broadcast that he expected the curve resistance to slow the acceleration of the uncontrolled movement and the train to “stall out” in the tunnel. The train was able to proceed over back-to-back reverse curves as its speed gradually accelerated to about 53 mph, well in excess of the maximum authorized speed; however, it was not able to negotiate the sharp 9.8° curve immediately before the Kicking Horse River bridge. The head end of the train derailed at Mile 130.6, at 0051. The 3 crew members were fatally injured.\n\n1.2.4 Sequence of events\n\nThe sequence of events was established from a review of available information, including radio communication records, data from the locomotive event recorders (LERs), and interviews (Table 1).\n\nTable 1. Sequence of events in the occurrence\n\nNote: Times where seconds are expressed as 00 are approximate; other times are exact, unless otherwise specified.

The RTC relieves the crew of inspecting duties for their train at the end of their tour of duty at Field. 2019-02-03 2125:00 The LE starts to advance the throttle from notch 1 to the notch 2-3 position at a speed of 2 mph to keep the train moving on the approach to Stephen. 2019-02-03 2128:13 The LE makes an initial air brake application at Mile 123.12 while starting down the grade at Stephen. 2019-02-03 2128:37 The LE observes an applied air flow event. 2019-02-03 2136:45 While descending Field Hill, the LE makes the first of several incremental brake pipe pressure reductions as the train speed continues to increase. 2019-02-03 2137:15 The LE observes an applied air flow event after he makes the first incremental brake pipe pressure reduction. 2019-02-03 2148:08 The LE and the conductor apply the train brakes in emergency as the speed reaches 21 mph. 2019-02-03 21:48:25 The LE makes an emergency broadcast on the radio. 2019-02-03 2149:33 The train comes to a stop with the head end located at Mile 127.46. 2019-02-03 2153:00 The RTC asks the crew if the air is coming back, after the brakes were applied in emergency. The crew responds that they need to hold a job briefing with the trainmaster to determine what to do next. 2019-02-03 2215:00 The trainmaster and the crew conduct a job briefing over the radio. During the discussion, the LE mentions the applied air flow events that he observed along the way. A decision is made to set retainers on 75% of the cars (84 cars) per the Field Hill operating procedures. 2019-02-03 2230:00 The trainmaster arrives at Yoho by road vehicle. The RTC director informs the trainmaster that the relief crew will be on their way to Yoho shortly by road vehicle. The track foreman starts preparing a snow removal track unit to transport the relief crew by rail from Yoho to the train. The conductor exits the cab of the locomotive and begins setting the retainers. 2019-02-03 2245:00* The relief crew arrives at Yoho by road vehicle. 2019-02-03 2315:00 The track foreman, to prepare the way for the snow removal track unit, attempts to line the switch from the storage track onto the main track, but the switch is fouled with frozen snow. 2019-02-03 2330:00 The conductor returns to the locomotive cab after setting 84 retainers. 2019-02-03 2335:00 While waiting in Yoho, the relief LE holds an in-person briefing with the trainmaster. The decision to use retainers on 75% of the cars is discussed, and the relief LE does not object. While the relief LE is with the trainmaster, they also have a briefing via radio with the inbound LE. 2019-02-04 0015:00 The snow removal track unit departs Yoho and travels on the main track to transport the relief crew to the train. 2019-02-04 0031:00 The relief crew reports to the RTC that they are now on board the train. 2019-02-04 0042:02 The train starts to roll on its own with the emergency brake application still engaged. 2019-02-04 0042:36 The conductor and the conductor trainee get off the train to apply hand brakes. 2019-02-04 0042:38* The LE broadcasts over the radio that the train is in emergency and travelling at 1 mph. 2019-02-04 0042:40* The LE tells the conductor and the conductor trainee to return to the cab. 2019-02-04 0048:30 The train, now travelling at 22 mph, passes the Partridge west signal, which is displaying a stop indication protecting the block ahead with a track occupancy permit still in effect between Partridge and Yoho. 2019-02-04 0048:30 The inbound crew aboard the snow removal track unit moves clear of the Yoho east switch. 2019-02-04 0048:32 The Yoho east switch is manually lined in the normal position, and the track foreman reports this to the RTC. 2019-02-04 0049:00 The train passes the Yoho east switch. 2019-02-04 0049:10 The LE broadcasts that the train is entering Upper Spiral Tunnel and that its speed is 40 mph. 2019-02-04 0050:05 The LE broadcasts that the speed of the train is 48 mph. 2019-02-04 0050:20 The LE broadcasts that the speed of the train is 51 mph. 2019-02-04 0050:27 The tail end portion of the train separates between positions 85 and 86. 2019-02-04 0050:31 The midsection of the train separates between positions 36 and 37. 2019-02-04 0050:34 The tail-end remote locomotive comes to a stop just inside the west portal of the Upper Spiral Tunnel. 2019-02-04 0050:54* The head end of the train derails in the Kicking Horse River. 2019-02-04 0051:20 The wayside detector broadcasts an alert after the train passes Mile 130.2 that the power is off and not working, and also provides a car count with fewer cars than are actually on the train.\n\n* Estimated time based on the surviving LER data obtained from the DP mid-train and rear locomotives.\n\nAfter the train had stopped in emergency on the mountain grade at Mile 127.46, approximately 2.5 hours elapsed before the relief crew was on board and preparing to recover the emergency brake application. Table 2 describes the activities that took place and the delays incurred during the 3 hours that the train remained stationary on Field Hill.\n\nTable 2. Timeline of the events and delays while the train was stationary on Field Hill Date Time Elapsed time Events 2019-02-03 2150 00:00:00\n\nThe inbound crew applies the train brakes in emergency at Mile 126.98.\n\nThe train stops at Mile 127.46.\n\nThe inbound crew makes an emergency broadcast on the standby channel and contacts the RTC.\n\nThe trainmaster hears the emergency broadcast while in his vehicle at Field.\n\n2019-02-03 2153 00:03:00\n\nThe RTC contacts the inbound crew and requests an update.\n\nThe LE indicates that he needs to talk to the trainmaster to have a job briefing before doing anything.\n\nThe trainmaster is unable to contact the inbound crew from Field.\n\nThe RTC director recognizes the implications related to the time required to apply retainers, recover the emergency brake application, and get the train down to Field.\n\nThe train crew originally planned to relieve train 101 is reassigned by the director to relieve train 301 instead.\n\n2019-02-03 2215 00:25:00\n\nThe trainmaster, en route to Yoho, contacts the inbound crew for a job briefing.\n\nThe job briefing takes place, during which a decision is made to apply retainers on 75% of the cars (84 cars), as per policy.\n\nThe trainmaster assesses that the inbound crew can recover the emergency brake application and bring the train to Field.\n\nThe trainmaster tells the crew that he will drive to Yoho to be on hand to assist if necessary.\n\n2019-02-03 2230 00:40:00\n\nThe trainmaster arrives at Yoho by road vehicle.\n\nThe track foreman starts preparing a snow removal track unit to transport the relief crew by rail from Yoho to the train.\n\nThe RTC director informs the trainmaster that the relief crew will be on their way to Yoho shortly by road vehicle.\n\nThe conductor exits the cab of the locomotive and begins setting the retainers.\n\n2019-02-03 2245 00:55:00\n\nThe relief crew arrives at Yoho by road vehicle.\n\n2019-02-03 2253 01:03:00\n\nThe RTC contacts the inbound crew for an update.\n\nThe LE indicates that the conductor still has 60 retainers to set.\n\n2019-02-03 2315 01:15:00\n\nThe relief crew is delayed at Yoho while the snow removal track unit is readied and frozen snow is cleaned out of a track switch.\n\n2019-02-03 2327 01:37:00\n\nThe RTC contacts the inbound crew for an update.\n\nThe LE indicates that the conductor still has 5 retainers to set.\n\nThe LE informs the RTC that the relief crew has not yet arrived at the train.\n\n2019-02-04 0015 02:25:00\n\nThe snow removal track unit departs Yoho and travels by rail to transport the relief crew to the train.\n\n2019-02-04 0020 02:30:00\n\nThe relief crew arrives at the train and conducts a job briefing with the inbound crew.\n\n2019-02-04 0031 02:41:00\n\nThe relief LE contacts the RTC to inform him that they are on board the train.\n\nThe relief LE indicates to the RTC that the train is waiting to be contacted by the track foreman for confirmation that the snow removal track unit and all on-board personnel are clear of the main track.\n\nThe LE mentions that, after the track foreman provides the “all-clear” confirmation, the emergency brake application will need to be recovered before the train can proceed to Field.\n\n2019-02-04 0042 02:52:00\n\nThe train starts to roll on its own.\n\nThe relief crew makes an emergency broadcast on the standby channel.\n\nThe RTC contacts the relief crew in response to emergency broadcast.\n\nThe relief LE informs the RTC that the train has started to roll on its own even though the emergency brake application has not been recovered.\n\n1.3 Site examination\n\nThe derailment site spanned 1.2 miles, from Mile 129.4 to Mile 130.6. It was located about 6.8 track miles northeast of the town of Field.\n\nThe train had separated into 3 sections during the derailment (Figure 3).\n\nThe front portion of the train, including the lead locomotive (CP 9538) and the first 35 cars, had derailed on the curve immediately before the Kicking Horse River bridge at Mile 130.6 (Figure 4).\n\nThe head-end locomotive, CP 9538, was lying on its left side in the riverbed, some 35 feet below the track level. The river was quite shallow, and the surface was frozen and covered with snow. A patch of open water about 20 feet in diameter was visible underneath and adjacent to the locomotive, where the ice had broken when the locomotive fell onto the riverbed. An inspection of the underside of the locomotive showed little indication of ground contact, but the rest of the locomotive had sustained extensive damage.\n\nSeveral derailed cars were lying on the river embankment, and the remaining cars in this section of the occurrence site had derailed along the right-of-way. The head-end cars had been scattered on the embankment or had come to rest in the treed area some distance away from the track.\n\nFurther back in the train, at around Mile 130.2, 40 cars from the middle portion of the train had derailed on their side and in a pile-up. Several of these cars were underneath a multi-lane overpass structure where Highway 1 passes above the track. Some cars were leaning against the bridge piers, which sustained superficial damage (Figure 5).\n\nThe mid-train remote locomotive, UP 5359, had derailed but stood upright among other cars stacked in a side-by-side pile-up (Figure 6).\n\nEight cars on the trailing end of the middle portion did not derail and were not damaged.\n\nIn the rear portion, rolling stock was located both inside and outside the Upper Spiral Tunnel. Outside the tunnel, 7 cars were derailed on their side and 15 cars were derailed in a pile-up on the mountainside. Inside the tunnel, 4 cars had stayed on the rails, 1 car had the rear truck derailed, and 2 cars were upright with all trucks derailed. The tail-end remote locomotive, CEFX 1040, remained on the track some 475 feet inside the tunnel (Figure 7).\n\nThe track examination did not show any breaks or gaps in the rail, or any indication of lateral shift. The rail was still solidly anchored to the hardwood crossties. The track structure was solidly frozen in the ground. There was no indication that the high rail (outer side of the curve) had canted outward or rolled over.\n\n1.3.1 Inspection of rolling stock\n\nAccess to the rolling stock was limited in many areas due to the wreckage, spilled car contents, and confined workspace. In many cases, key components of interest were damaged beyond the point at which meaningful information could be obtained. The inspection focused on the visible portions of the rolling stock, in particular the brake system, the wheelsets, and the position of the various valve handles on the cars. All of these could provide insight into the operation of the train at the time of the occurrence.\n\nThe car air brake system appeared to be properly set up. The retainer handles that were visible appeared to be in the HP position. The examination of the hand brakes did not provide any indication that they had been applied. The brake rigging and wheel tread surfaces were all relatively clean and with no evidence of snow or ice buildup.\n\nThe head-end locomotive was extensively damaged; a section of the control stand with various control levers was removed for visual inspection off site. This inspection indicated that the controls were operational and had not malfunctioned in any way before the locomotive derailed. The electrical wiring was intact, as were the controller mechanical linkages.\n\nThe following components were set aside for further examination and testing:\n\nthe 12 grain cars that had not derailed, plus the grain car that remained upright with 1 truck derailed;\n\nthe tail-end locomotive;\n\nthe brake shoes on all 3 locomotives (Figure 8); and\n\nthe car wheelsets that could be recovered, about 78% of the total wheels (Figure 9).\n\n1.4 Weather\n\nAt the time of the occurrence, the sky was clear with light gusting winds. Although it had recently snowed in the area, the snow was not covering the top of the rail head. The ambient temperature was determined to be about −25 °C when the train stopped in emergency. By the time the train started to roll on its own around 0042, the temperature had decreased to −28 °C.\n\n1.5 Subdivision information\n\nThe Laggan Subdivision is part of CP's main corridor to the west coast. The subdivision extends from Calgary (Mile 0.0) to Field (Mile 136.6), and consists primarily of a single main track, with a double-track portion located between Lake Louise, Alberta (Mile 116.2), and Stephen (Mile 123.1). At Field, the track connects with Mile 0.0 of the Mountain Subdivision.\n\nTrain movements are governed by the centralized traffic control (CTC) system, as authorized by the Canadian Rail Operating Rules (CROR), and dispatched by an RTC located in Calgary. Calgary is also the home terminal for train crews, trainmasters and road foremen operating on the Laggan Subdivision.\n\nLaggan Subdivision freight traffic volumes for 2015–2019 are shown in Table 3.\n\nTable 3. Freight traffic volumes on the Laggan Subdivision from 2015 to 2019 (Source: Canadian Pacific) Year Volume\n\n(million gross ton-miles per mile) 2015 62.8 2016 65.3 2017 65.9 2018 70.6 2019 70.1\n\n1.6 Track information\n\nIn the vicinity of the derailment, the main track consisted of 136-pound continuous welded rail manufactured in 2000. On the open track, the rail was laid on 14-inch double-shouldered tie plates and was fastened to hardwood ties with 3 spikes per tie plate. Inside the spiral tunnels, the rail was secured to steel ties using spring clips. The ballast was clean crushed rock. The shoulders were about 12 inches wide, the cribs were full, and the drainage was good.\n\nThe track is normally inspected a minimum of twice per week as required by CP’s Red Book of Track & Structures Requirements. The last regulatory track inspection, conducted as required by the Transport Canada (TC)–approved Rules Respecting Track Safety, was conducted on 31 January 2019. There were no deficiencies noted during the inspection near the derailment location.\n\nFrom Mile 122.9 to Mile 136.6, the maximum authorized speed on this track is 20 mph. Freight trains having a weight per operative brake of 100 tons or more are restricted to a maximum authorized speed of 15 mph.\n\n1.7 Personnel information\n\n1.7.1 Inbound crew\n\nThe inbound crew was composed of an LE and a conductor. Both crew members met established rest and fitness requirements and were qualified for their respective positions.\n\nThe LE was hired as a conductor trainee in November 2005. He qualified as a conductor in May 2006. He spent 5 years on yard assignments and then moved to road service. He entered the LE training program in January 2012 and qualified in August 2012. After qualification, he returned to his previous position as a conductor and worked as a relieving LE on various subdivisions when an assignment was available. In 2018, he moved permanently to the LE spare board for the Laggan Subdivision. He had followed the program specifically designed for Field Hill operations and was Field Hill–certified.Footnote 22\n\nThe conductor started training as a conductor in April 2018 and qualified at the end of August 2018. After qualifying, she worked on yard assignments in Alyth Yard and in the Carseland Cargill facility and on road switching assignments. The occurrence trip was her 4th trip working as a conductor on the Laggan Subdivision.\n\n1.7.2 Relief crew\n\nThe relief crew consisted of an LE, a conductor, and a conductor in training (the conductor trainee). The relief LE qualified in 1996, resigned in 2002, and was rehired as a conductor/LE in 2003. This was his 1268th trip on the Laggan Subdivision. The relief conductor qualified in 2007 and was on his 171st trip on the Laggan Subdivision. The conductor trainee was hired in 2018 and was taking his 13th training trip on the Laggan Subdivision.\n\nThe relief crew members had arrived at Field in a westbound train on the morning of 03 February 2019. They went off duty at 1120 and had more than 8 continuous hours off-duty time, in accordance with established rest and fitness requirements. However, from the early morning hours of 03 February 2019 until 2200, a power outage affected heating and electrical power at the CP’s bunkhouse in Field, where the relief crew was resting. The power outage also resulted in a loss of communications, meaning that crews had to be notified by supervisors, in person, when called to duty. In addition, the generator in Field ran out of fuel, and the occupants of the bunkhouse resorted to using the propane-fuelled cooking stove as a heat source. The temperature inside the bunkhouse facility had reportedly dropped to as low as 8 °C before power was restored.\n\n1.7.3 Trainmaster\n\nThe trainmaster joined CP in 2008 as an RTC where he gained preliminary experience dispatching the Laggan Subdivision during his first year of service. He qualified as a conductor in 2013 and as an LE in 2015 under management training programs,Footnote 23 and became a trainmaster in January 2016. At the time of the occurrence, he had taken over 100 trips as an LE, most of them on mountainous territory on the Cranbrook and Windermere subdivisions, and had worked on the Laggan Subdivision as a conductor. The trainmaster was not a Field Hill–certified LE, nor was it a CP requirement for supervisors on that territory.\n\n1.8 Canadian Pacific’s grain car fleet\n\nThe 112 grain cars on the train were assembled from 3 separate fleets of hopper cars: a fleet owned by the Government of Canada, CP’s own fleet, and a fleet of leased cars.\n\n1.8.1 Government of Canada fleet\n\nFrom 1972 to 1994, the Government of Canada purchased some 13 500 covered hopper cars to carry Western Canadian grain for export (Figure 10). Many of these cars have been removed from service by attrition, but, at the time of the occurrence, more than half of them were still in service and represented approximately one third of the cars in active grain service in Canada. At the end of December 2018, the Government of Canada’s grain hopper car fleet consisted of 7749 cars, almost evenly distributed between CP and Canadian National Railway Company (CN). In 2007, the Government of Canada signed an agreement with CN and CP for the operation, maintenance, and refurbishment of the federal fleet of hopper cars.Footnote 24\n\nCP is required by agreement to maintain capacity for the transportation of grain by refurbishing the Government of Canada fleet of hopper cars, upgrading cars to carry higher loads, and replacing some of the retired cars with new higher-capacity hopper cars. Like any other commodity freight car, the grain hopper cars require repairs. TC monitors the number of bad-order cars to ensure that efficient and timely maintenance is done, consistent with the Association of American Railroads (AAR) Field Manual of the AAR Interchange Rules.\n\nThe cars in CP’s fleet that are owned by the Government of Canada are designated as CP 600000–608591 series. They were mainly built between 1972 and 1985, and are equipped with Wabcopac or Nycopac truck-mounted brakes; they are not equipped with slack adjustersFootnote 25 to compensate for wheel and brake shoe wear and to maintain uniform piston travel.\n\n1.8.2 Canadian Pacific hopper cars\n\nSome of the hopper cars on the train were from CP’s own fleet: CP 384000 series cars and SOO series cars. The CP 384000 series cars were built in 1981 and were equipped with Wabcopac truck-mounted brakes, but were not equipped with slack adjusters. The SOO series cars were built between 1994 and 2006 and were equipped with newer technology, namely truck-mounted or body-mounted brakes that have automatic slack adjusters.\n\n1.8.3 Leased cars\n\nThe leased cars in CP’s grain fleet came from various car owners in the United States and were mainly equipped with body-mounted brake rigging systems with automatic slack adjusters.\n\n1.8.4 Fleet composition of the occurrence train\n\nThe fleet composition of the occurrence train was as follows:\n\n40 cars: 2 cars in the CP 384000-384999 series and 38 Government of Canada cars in the CP 600000–608591 series;\n\n51 cars designated as SOO series, from CP’s own fleet; and\n\n21 cars from the fleet of leased cars.\n\nThe air brake configuration for the cars on the train is provided in Appendix C, with the replacement history of the brake components. The maintenance history indicated that the cars on the occurrence train were maintained according to regulatory standards.\n\n1.8.5 Renewal of Canadian Pacific’s grain car fleet\n\nChanges to the Canada Transportation Act in May 2018 allowed adjustments to reflect the costs incurred by railway companies to obtain and maintain hopper cars for the movement of grain. In response, CP initiated a review of its existing grain fleet and developed a multi-year plan to replace part of the fleet with new and higher capacity cars. CP started taking delivery of the new grain cars in September 2018. Since then, CP has been receiving new grain cars monthly. The program is expected to be complete by December 2022. As of October 2021, CP has brought into service a total of 5355 new grain cars (4500 purchased and 855 leased).\n\n1.9 Railway operations in winter\n\nWinter conditions in northern climates, such as cold temperatures, ice and snow, present specific challenges for railway operations.\n\nIn recognition of these seasonal challenges, most railways operating in the northern United States and Canada establish an annual winter operating plan that presents strategies to remain operationally viable and safe during the winter months. Typical winter operating plans may include proactive actions, for example:\n\npre-seasonal servicing of switch heaters and snow fighting equipment,\n\nservicing of locomotive cooling systems and locomotive “hot start” systems,\n\nensuring a supply of suitable replacement rail in anticipation of cold-related rail breaks,\n\nlimiting train length to combat difficulties associated with train air supply on long trains,\n\nrenewing all end-of-car hose gaskets on intermodal and grain cars,\n\nqualifying trains’ air brake systems to half of the allowable regulatory leakage rates,\n\nspeed reductions,\n\n30-minute standing air brake leakage test,\n\nrestricting loaded unit train operation during the night when extreme temperatures are forecasted, and\n\nreinforcing the importance of appropriate clothing and personal protective equipment for employees working outdoors.\n\n1.9.1 Additional challenges in extreme cold temperatures\n\nBeyond the usual challenges faced in winter, extreme cold temperatures (about −25 °C)Footnote 26 add another level of complexity to railway operations. For example, rails can become brittle and snap under load, and pull-aparts can occur when the rail anchors cannot overcome the intense compressive forces created when cold rail contracts.\n\nIt is well known in the North American railway industry that cold temperatures can result in air leakage from freight car air brake systems. Footnote 27 Rubber seals and gaskets become stiff and metal contracts, resulting in leakage of compressed air. In extreme cold temperatures, the effectiveness of air brake systems can further decline. Equally of concern is that symptoms associated with degraded braking efficiency on a train may not be obvious or straightforward for an LE to properly diagnose.\n\nTo compensate for air leakage, air brake systems provide brake pipe pressure maintainingFootnote 28 to replenish the lost compressed air. However, brake cylinders are only pressure maintained to approximately 8 to 12 psi, regardless of the air brake application in effect.\n\nBrake system leakage in extreme cold temperatures can be particularly problematic in mountain grade territories, where safe train speed control on long descending grades requires higher levels of brake cylinder pressure (BCP) for an extended length of time.\n\n1.9.2 Previous winter restrictions for westbound trains operating on Field Hill\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, CP implemented a number of procedural modifications to mitigate some of the challenges of operating trains on Field Hill in extreme cold temperatures.\n\nIn 2014, and after an extended period of extreme cold temperatures, CP decided to temporarily limit the speed of grain trains to 10 mph when the temperature reached −20 °C, and to stage grain trains (hold them in a queue) during the night when the temperature dropped below −25 °C. Staging the trains allowed them to descend Field Hill in the warmer daylight hours, which assisted in better braking.\n\nThis decision came after several grain trains had difficulties controlling their speed on Field Hill during extreme cold temperatures. Subsequent inspections of 2 of these trains (made up of CP 600000–608591 series cars) in Golden, BC, and in Eldon, Alberta, revealed leaking brake cylinders. Railway certified car inspectors noted that, in Golden, the brake cylinders had leaked off on a number of cars within 15 minutes and that, in Eldon, brake cylinders had leaked off within 20 minutes. These same trains did not have abnormally high leakage when they received their pre-departure inspections and No. 1 brake tests at Alyth Yard. However, leakage intensified with the colder temperatures encountered in the mountains.Footnote 29\n\nOn 12 November 2015, ahead of the winter season, CP issued General Bulletin Order (GBO) M599 for westbound trains on the Laggan Subdivision. The bulletin restricted train speed to a maximum of 10 mph from east siding switch at Partridge to Field when the temperature reading at Mile 111.0 dropped below −25 °C, until braking was seen to be sufficient. The GBO was cancelled on 14 March 2016 concurrent with the end of the winter operating season.\n\nAt the time of the occurrence, CP had a system-wide winter contingency plan, however, this plan provided no additional seasonal restrictions specific to mountain grade train operations.\n\n1.10 Field Hill operating procedures\n\nOperating instructions can be found in CP time tables, General Operating Instructions (GOIs), GBOs, Special Instructions (SIs), operating bulletins, and train handling procedures. In this investigation report, the instructions applicable to Field Hill are called the Field Hill operating procedures (FHOP).\n\nThe investigation reviewed several years of FHOP dating back to 1985.\n\nIn 1990, the time table for the Laggan Subdivision contained SIs for trains left standing on grades:\n\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\n(HEAVY HAUL SYSTEMS)\n\n1. TRAINS LEFT STANDING ON GRADE\n\nWhen the unit controlling a train is equipped with pressure maintaining, the train brakes may be left applied to hold the train when standing on a grade until ready to proceed, provided the train is not left unattended. If stop exceeds two hours and it is considered necessary to recharge the brake system before proceeding, sufficient hand brakes must be set to hold the train while recharging. Hand brakes must be set on rear of the train when on an ascending grade and on head end of the train when on a descending grade. Before releasing hand brakes, a sufficient brake pipe reduction must be made to hold the train while hand brakes are being released.Footnote 30\n\nAccording to these instructions, if a heavy train was stopped on Field Hill in excess of 2 hours and it was considered necessary to recharge the brake system, a sufficient number of hand brakes were to be applied to hold the train stationary while recharging.\n\nThe SIs were migrated from the Laggan Subdivision time table into the operating bulletins issued in conjunction with the time table. The first operating bulletin that contained the SIs was Heavy Haul – Canada Operating Bulletin No 93-A issued on 18 April 1993. The SI last appeared in Operating Bulletin No 93-C issued on 01 November 1993.\n\nIn 1997, after an accident on Field Hill that resulted in the derailment of 66 cars during an uncontrolled high-speed descent,Footnote 31 CP dedicated operating officers to accompany crews on every train operating westward on Field Hill for a period of 11 days to monitor operating practices and compliance with operating instructions. CP also issued Operating Bulletin 188 on 05 December 1997, which addressed emergency brake recovery procedures on Field Hill.\n\nAfter an incident on 02 January 1998, in which a freight train handling 112 cars ran uncontrolled between the Upper Spiral Tunnel and Field,Footnote 32 CP assigned 7 operating officers and 8 experienced LEs to ride all trains for a 3-month period between Lake Louise and Field. They were tasked with monitoring train crew performance, revising speed restrictions on Field Hill, and devising the proper method of using the train braking systems on the steep grade. CP then issued 2 bulletins: one that addressed train operations in severe weather conditions and snow accumulation above the top of the rail, and another that mandated an emergency brake application if train speed reached 24 mph when descending Field Hill. The bulletins were included in the time table footnotes for the Laggan Subdivision, effective 26 June 1998.Footnote 33\n\nIn 1998, after TC issued a notice and order requiring that maps be placed in time tables for subdivisions with grades greater than 1.5% and to provide train crews with train handling guidelines, CP developed new train handling procedures for Field Hill operations. The new guidelines were included in the time table footnotes for the Laggan Subdivision, effective 01 July 1998. They mandated a substantial speed reduction, a fully charged train brake system when descending Field Hill, and the use of retainers and/or hand brakes after an emergency brake application; they also provided specific instructions for when “release and catch” was required on the descent.\n\nSince then, the FHOP have changed several times. Table 4 highlights key changes from 1998 to 2019, with a focus on changes to the instructions related to the number of retainers/hand brakes to apply, and instructions on train speed after the lead locomotive passes the east siding switch at Partridge.\n\nAt the time of the occurrence, the 2015 instructions were in effect.\n\nTable 4.

In this mode, train handling commands used on the lead locomotives are transmitted via a DP radio to each of the remote locomotives. The remote locomotives, upon receipt of the radio message, respond by executing the train handling commands they receive. The signals sent by the lead locomotive ensure synchronous operation between all the remote locomotives distributed throughout the train.\n\nLER data obtained from a train’s lead controlling locomotive is normally the primary source of information used for analyzing train handling events; however, data from other locomotives operating in synchronous mode on the same train can similarly be used to support data analysis.\n\nThe LER installed on lead locomotive CP 9538 was extensively damaged during the derailment, and the stored data were lost. However, LER data were successfully extracted from the 2 remote locomotives. The review of the LER data did not reveal any issues with the DP radio communications and both LERs showed identical train handling events, confirming that the data are consistent and provide an accurate account of the train events.\n\nA list of train handling events based on the LER data is provided in Appendix D (including DB information).\n\n1.11.2 Applied air flow events\n\nAfter departing Alyth Yard, the LE observed applied air flow events on several occasions. The first observation occurred about 30 minutes after the train had departed Alyth Yard while the train was being brought to a stop at Keith at 1506 to allow other trains to clear through the area. During this time, the LE noticed an increase in brake pipe air flow immediately after having made an initial brake application.\n\nAt later times, other applied air flow events were observed by the LE while bringing the train to a stop for train meets, one at Banff around 1805 and another at Eldon around 1910.\n\nThe LE was not concerned with the applied air flow events. The train was otherwise handling as expected and no anomalies were noted, including both times the train was stopped at Eldon. The LE did not report the applied air flow events to the RTC at the time as there was no requirement to do so.\n\n1.11.3 Running brake test\n\nA running brake test involves an application of the automatic brake while the train is proceeding, to verify that the brakes are able to slow the movement.\n\nRailway operating instructions require LEs to perform periodic running brake tests during weather conditions that may cause snow or ice buildup between brake shoes and wheels. In addition, the FHOP require that westbound trains make a running brake test prior to Mile 113.0, to condition the brakesFootnote 34 and to verify their operability before reaching the steep descending grade of Field Hill. This requirement ensures that the test is conducted while the train is still traversing various ascending grades with a moderate change in elevation.\n\nCP’s GOIs in effect at the time of the occurrenceFootnote 35 provide additional information on when and how the running brake test is to be performed:\n\n12.0 Running Brake Test\n\n12.1 In the event of a complete Dynamic Brake failure enroute or when adverse weather conditions require the conditioning of the brakes, a running brake test must be performed on all trains prior to descending grades 2% or greater and at locations specified in special instructions.\n\nExamples of adverse weather conditions include but are not limited to the following:\n\n- Snow accumulations above the top of the rail\n\n- Outside ambient temperature is −15° Celsius or colder\n\n- Freezing rain conditions\n\nA running brake test of passenger train brakes must be made after leaving any location where any standing train air brake test was made.\n\n12.2 Running Brake Test Procedure Step Description 1 When the speed of the train permits, apply the train brakes with sufficient force to verify the brakes are operating properly. 2 The locomotive brakes should not be allowed to apply at this time. 3 If the brakes do not operate properly, immediately stop the train, determine the correct cause of failure, then repeat the running brake test.\n\nAccording to the LER data, the automatic air brake had been applied on 2 separate occasions prior to Mile 113.0:\n\nAt about 1902, the train entered the Eldon Siding at Mile 105.7. After progressively reducing the throttle, an initial 7 psi brake pipe reduction was made at around 1907, followed by a further 3 psi brake pipe reduction to 10 psi to stop the train at the west end of the siding at about 1909. The train remained stationary for about 28 minutes, proceeded westward for 84 feet, and then stopped again at 1943. The train then remained stationary on the 0.55% ascending grade for about 35 minutes with an 11 psi automatic brake application in combination with fully applied (i.e., 72 psi of BCP) locomotive independent brakes.\n\nAt around 2019, a reverse movement was made in the eastward direction to back the train out of the siding at Eldon. When the train speed reached 21 mph, the DB was applied,Footnote 36 followed by an initial 9 psi brake pipe reduction. When the train was about to clear the Eldon east switch, and with the DB having remained applied, the automatic brakes were fully applied (i.e., 26 psi brake pipe pressure reduction) from a speed of 14 mph. In the next 21 seconds, the brake pipe pressure was reduced from 79 psi to 62 psi and the train came to a stop a few seconds later.\n\nThe LER data indicate that, during the train stops described above, the air brakes responded adequately and did not show any performance issues. Although it had recently snowed in the area, there was no snow accumulation above the top of the rail nor blowing snow during the brake applications that were made to stop the train at Eldon.\n\nThe LE felt that the brake applications at Eldon were sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the FHOP and section 3, item 12.0 of the GOI.\n\nFrom the time the train departed the Eldon siding until it arrived at Stephen over 1 hour later, the automatic air brakes had been released and recharging.\n\n1.11.4 Train handling on Field Hill before the emergency brake application\n\nThe braking performance of the train had been satisfactory up to Stephen. It was only after the entire train was on the descending grade that the LE noted that the train was not braking as expected.\n\nBased on LER data, the LE made 5 separate service brake pipe reductions during the descent, yet the train continued to gain speed. Table 5 lists the brake pipe reductions in psi, the resultant brake pipe pressure (BPP) in psi and the corresponding air flow readings in cubic feet per minute (CFM).\n\nTable 5. Sequence of brake pipe reductions and air flow values* on the Field Hill descent Time Head end mileage Speed (mph) Train handling events 2128:13 123.12 8 Initiation of a 7 psi brake pipe reduction (starting BPP = 88 psi) 2128:27 123.15 9 Reduction of BPP to 81 psi 2128:37 to 2136:45 123.18 to 124.72 9 to 19 Fluctuation of air flow between 21 and 35 CFM 2137:01 124.80 19 Additional 3 psi brake pipe reduction (resultant BPP = 78 psi); air flow stops 2137:15 to 2145:46 124.88 to 126.41 19 to 12 Fluctuation of air flow between 20 and 31 CFM, until the next brake pipe reduction 2146:01 126.46 14 Additional 2 psi brake pipe reduction (resultant BPP = 76 psi) 2146:29 to 2146:33 126.58 to 126.60 15 to 16 Fluctuation of air flow between 20 and 24 CFM 2146:46 126.66 16 Additional 2 psi brake pipe reduction (resultant BPP = 74 psi); air flow less than 20 CFM 2147:19 126.82 19 Additional 2 psi brake pipe reduction (resultant BPP = 72 psi); air flow less than 20 CFM 2147:53 127.01 21 Reduction of BPP by 3 psi (resultant BPP = 69 psi) 2148:08 127.12 21 Application of the train brakes in emergency 2148:10 127.12 23 Beginning of BPP reduction from 69 to 0 psi\n\n* Air flow values shown in the table do not represent total brake pipe flow; they represent only the flow from the air brake system on the mid-train remote locomotive (UP 5359), which was 1 of the 3 operative sources of compressed air on the train. Additional air flow readings from the lead locomotive were not available due to the loss of the LER data. The LER on the tail-end remote locomotive was a legacy device that did not record air flow information.\n\n1.11.5 Emergency stop\n\nIn spite of the incremental brake pipe pressure reductions, the train continued to accelerate down Field Hill.\n\nAt 2147, and as the head end of the train approached Mile 127, the speed of the train reached 20 mph (5 mph above the maximum authorized speed). In the next minute, the LE, and separately the conductor, simultaneously applied the train brakes in emergency, which brought the train to a full stop at Mile 127.46, some 1 minute 25 seconds later at 2149:33. The conductor had opened the emergency brake valve located at the conductor’s work station as a back-up measure in response to the LE’s actions to bring the train to an emergency stop.\n\nIn this situation, because of the train’s speed, the brakes were applied in emergency before the automatic brake application reached full service, i.e., about a 26 psi brake pipe reduction. The automatic brake application had reached a 19 psi brake pipe reduction when the brakes were applied in emergency.\n\nThe train came to a stop with its tail end blocking the east siding switch at Partridge, preventing rail traffic in either direction through this location. As a result, 4 trains had to be stopped or held on the Mountain Subdivision and 7 trains stopped or held on the Laggan Subdivision.\n\n1.12 Recovering from an emergency brake application on Field Hill\n\n1.12.1 Emergency brake recovery procedure\n\nAfter the emergency stop on Field Hill, operating instructions and procedures required that the crew hold a job briefing with the trainmaster to determine the best course of action, and whether to recover the emergency brake application.\n\nThe GOI in effect at the time of the occurrence stated, in part:\n\n32.9 Uncontrolled Movements – Stop Required:\n\nAny movement descending a Heavy or Mountain grade that attains a speed 5 MPH above permissible speed is considered an uncontrolled movement and must be stopped immediately by whatever means is available, including (if necessary) using an EMERGENCY brake application.\n\nThe movement must not proceed until it has been determined that sufficient braking is available to control the movement. This may require securing the train to recharge the brake system and/or the use of retainers.Footnote 37\n\nThe train handling procedures in effect at the time for the Laggan Subdivision made a distinction between the actions to be taken for a first emergency stop and a second emergency stop, stating in part,\n\n1.0 Train handling procedure\n\nThe train handling procedure on page 4, and the following instructions in paragraphs A, B, C and D apply to westward freight trains in which the weight per operative brake is 100 tons or greater.\n\nNote: All westward trains experiencing an emergency brake application beyond mile 123.5 must communicate with the on duty trainmaster via the RTC and be governed by their instructions.\n\nA. Emergency brake recovery procedure – […] Trains which are stopped between mile 125.7 and Signal 1363 Field with the train air brakes in emergency, must be governed as follows:\n\nFirst Emergency Brake Application:\n\nBefore the emergency PCS [pneumatic control switch] is recovered, all crew members (ie: locomotive engineer and conductor and trainmaster) must perform a job briefing to discuss with each other the use of retainer valves. In the application GOI section 1, item 14.2 and 40.3, set retaining valves to the HP (high pressure) position on at least 75 percent of the loaded cars. When discussing the use of retainers and/or hand brakes, consider train location, amount of train on the mountain grade weather and rail conditions and any other conditions present that may affect the braking of the train. If abnormal conditions such as weather or poor braking train dictate that the application of hand brakes is necessary to secure the train while recharging, then apply a hand brake on at least 75 percent of the cars and set retaining valves to the HP position on at least 75 percent of the loaded cars.\n\nSecond Emergency Brake Application:\n\nApply retainers on 100% of the loaded cars and 40 handbrakes on the head end of the train.Footnote 38\n\n1.12.2 Methods for recovering from an emergency brake application\n\nTo recover from an emergency brake application, retainers, hand brakes, or a combination of both can be used. Retainers and hand brakes serve different purposes. Once the decision is made to apply retainers or set hand brakes, the task is performed by the conductor.\n\n1.12.2.1 Setting retainers\n\nFreight rail cars are equipped with a retainer, which is a pressure retaining valve connected to the brake cylinder exhaust port (figures 11 and 12).\n\nThe purpose of retainers is to retain air pressureFootnote 39 in the car brake cylinders, when required, after the train brakes are released and while the air storage reservoirs are being recharged on the cars.\n\nSetting a retainer on a car is a straightforward process that requires the 3-position retainer handle to be manually moved to the HP position. Setting retainers on an entire train is relatively manageable by a lone conductor, because they are visible and accessible from the ground, and the conductor does not need to board each car.\n\nSetting retainers on a stationary train does not provide additional brake retarding force while the train brakes remain applied. Rather, retainers are intended to provide a residual amount of braking force after the train brakes are released. This may help hold the train in a stationary position or control the speed while the air brake system is being recharged.Footnote 40\n\n1.12.2.2 Applying hand brakes\n\nAll railway rolling stock is equipped with a hand brake, a mechanical brake device that will secure the car independently of the air brake system. Hand brakes are manually applied (and tightened) by turning the hand brake wheel (Figure 13). This causes the brake shoes to be pressed against the wheel tread surface to prevent the wheels from moving or to retard their motion. The effectiveness of a hand brake is directly proportional to the amount of force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely from one person to another.\n\nApplying hand brakes requires care in safely negotiating the right-of-way, boarding the car by means of the ladder and grab irons and positioning at the hand brake. Conductors are required to establish a three-point stance before cranking the hand brake wheel clockwise to take up chain slack before applying maximum force on the crank. Variations in car design (i.e., access ladders, grab irons and platforms) require adaptations in the approach to accessing each hand brake crank and dismounting the car.Footnote 41 Overall, applying effective brake force to the car is subject to the operator’s fitness, physical size and individual technique.\n\nIn contrast to setting retainers, applying hand brakes requires significantly more time and energy to accomplish correctly. Setting hand brakes on 75% of the cars of a typical loaded grain train is a demanding task for a lone conductor, the success of which is dependent on multiple factors such as experience, physical strength, endurance and technique. In winter conditions on mountain grade, the task is made more difficult by bulky winter clothing and personal protective equipment, coupled with potentially deep snow along the right-of-way; it requires a sustained effort over several hours.\n\nSetting hand brakes on trains situated on main tracks can interrupt rail traffic, with corresponding repercussions on operations across the network. Unlike retainers, however, hand brakes do not rely on the train’s residual BCP for effectiveness.\n\nAlthough hand brakes were not applied on the occurrence train, in support of this investigation, the TSB conducted mechanical testing and human factors assessment of issues related to hand brake securement of freight trains on mountain grades. Appendix E provides a summary of the results from this study.\n\n1.12.3 Job briefing after the emergency stop\n\nA job briefing between the inbound crew and the trainmaster was held after the emergency stop, as required by the FHOP. The focus was on the shared interpretation of the instructions, which describe actions and considerations required after the emergency stop.\n\nGiven the conductor’s relative inexperience, the job briefing took the form of a conversation between the trainmaster and the LE. The trainmaster had dealt with emergency stops in mountain grade a dozen times as a supervisor and once as a conductor. His understanding was that the routine procedure had always been to use only retainers after a first emergency, and to include hand brakes after a second emergency, should one subsequently occur. Hand brakes would also be required to secure trains with mechanical problems that required repairs before resuming their descent.\n\nThe LE, in his previous experience as a conductor, had once dealt with an emergency stop on Field Hill. On that occasion, he first applied retainers, but the train speed could not subsequently be controlled and the train had to be put into emergency a second time, at which point hand brakes were applied to secure the train before recovering from the emergency brake application.\n\nDuring the discussion, the LE mentioned the applied air flow events that he had observed along the way; however, the trainmaster did not perceive this information to be related to the difficulty controlling the train and indicated that he would look into it at a later date during a follow-up review of the LER download.\n\nThe trainmaster assessed that the inbound crew could recover the emergency brake application and bring the train to Field. There was no mention of how much time was left on the inbound crew’s work clock. The trainmaster opted for the use of the retainers, set on the HP position, on 75% of the cars (84 cars). Factors such as the rail surface conditions, the extreme cold temperature, and the length of time that the train might remain stationary were not discussed.\n\nThe trainmaster’s decision to apply only retainers was not questioned. The job briefing was centred on the use of the FHOP to guide development of a plan to bring the train safely down Field Hill. As such, guidance on retainer use contained in the FHOP was chosen over the use of hand brakes as the intent was to perform a “release and catch” and get underway. The decision to use retainers while recovering the emergency brake application was communicated to the RTC director.\n\nAfter the job briefing, at about 2230, the conductor began to set the retainers on 84 (75%) of the cars, as decided by the trainmaster and per the FHOP. The task, which was made more difficult by the mountainous terrain, the extreme cold, and the darkness, took about 1 hour. The conductor returned to the locomotive at approximately 2330.\n\n1.13 Crew-to-crew transfer and delays\n\nWhen the train was stopped in emergency at 2150, the inbound crew was in its last hour of a 10-hour shift, which was scheduled to end at 2230.\n\nThe RTC director, on hearing of the situation, recognized that setting retainers and recovering the emergency brake application would take the inbound crew past the end of their shift. As a result, he made the decision to call in a relief crew.\n\nThere was already a crew in Field. The members of this crew—an LE, a conductor, and a conductor trainee—were due to come on duty at 2230 to relieve a different train. The director had them reassigned to the occurrence train. The relief crew left Field at the beginning of their shift as scheduled, at 2230, and made their way to Yoho by road vehicle, which took approximately 15 minutes.\n\nA series of circumstances contributed to delaying the relief crew. Because of the train’s location, the relief crew had to travel about 2 miles by rail in a snow removal track unit from Yoho to get to the lead locomotive. Doing pre-checks and readying the snow removal track unit took time, and the delays were compounded when a switch fouled with frozen snow had to be cleaned before the snow removal track unit could get under way. In total, the relief crew was delayed in Yoho for approximately 1.5 hours.\n\nThe relief crew arrived at the train at around 0020 and held a job briefing with the inbound crew. The members of the inbound crew then boarded the snow removal track unit to travel to Yoho.\n\nAt 0031, in preparation for resuming the trip, the relief LE told the RTC that he was waiting to ensure that the snow removal track unit and all personnel were clear of the main track before cancelling his joint authority with the track foreman; he indicated that, after receiving the “all-clear” confirmation, he would recover the emergency brake application, charge the brake system, and then proceed down to Field. At that point, the train had been stationary on the mountain grade in extreme cold temperatures, ranging from −25 °C to −28 °C, for almost 3 hours.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, at 0042, shortly before the snow removal track unit and all on-board personnel were clear of the main track, the train began to roll uncontrolled.\n\n1.14 Train dynamics simulation\n\nThe TSB laboratory completed a series of train dynamics simulations using the Train Energy and Dynamics Simulator (TEDS) software program. The simulations examined factors such as speed, acceleration, in-train forces, braking efficiency, and stop distance. It showed the following:\n\nThe average efficiency of the air brake system on the occurrence train was about 60% to 62% of nominal expected values.\n\nThe train derailed mainly due to the high-speed centrifugal forces combined with the lateral force that was generated by moderate in-train buff forces.\n\n1.15 Brake retarding force calculations\n\nBrake retarding force calculations were made to find out how much BCP would have been required to safely descend the average 2.2% Field Hill grade, stop the train with an emergency brake application, and hold the train stationary on the hill.\n\nThe train departed Alyth Yard with the brakes cut out on 2 of the 112 cars because the brakes were defective. All calculations regarding braking forces took this into account and were based on 110 cars having operative brakes. The calculated brake retarding force values were numerically rounded to the nearest whole number for simplicity of presentation. For more information on the calculations used to obtain these values, see TSB laboratory report LP014/2022.\n\nThe TEDS train dynamics simulation analysis results for braking efficiency and stopping distance verify and support the accuracy of the calculated values.\n\n1.15.1 Brake retarding force required to maintain a constant speed\n\nGiven the total tonnage of the occurrence train (approximately 15 000 tons) and the average 2.2% grade, a total retarding force of 630 050 pounds would have been needed to maintain a train speed of 15 mph while descending Field Hill. With the locomotives’ DB set at mid- to high-range (75% of maximum), they would have been providing 220 500 pounds. The remainder of the brake retarding force needed, 409 550 pounds, would have had to be generated by the 110 of the 112 grain cars to maintain a constant speed. Each car would have been required to provide a net retarding force of about 3720 pounds corresponding to a brake shoe force of 12 400 pounds.Footnote 42\n\nThe brake effort calculations show that the 112-car loaded unit grain train with 110 cars with operational air brakes would have needed 25 psi average BCP on each operative car to maintain the train speed at 15 mph on the 2.2% descending grade. Theoretically, in the absence of leakage, a BCP of this magnitude can be obtained with a 10 psi brake pipe reduction.\n\nAccording to the LER data, the brake pipe pressure had been reduced by 19 psi during the descent, prior to the emergency brake application that brought the train to a stop. For a 19 psi reduction, the corresponding theoretical BCP should amount to 40 psi.\n\n1.15.2 Brake retarding force generated by the emergency brake application\n\nAt 2148:08, the train brakes were applied in emergency while the train speed was approaching 21 mph on the 2.2% descending grade. The train speed reduced during the next 85 seconds and the head end came to a stop on the main track around Mile 127.46, about midway between the Partridge siding switches. The train stopped after covering a distance of 1815 feet with the train brakes applied in emergency and with a full application of the DBs on the lead locomotive.\n\nBased on a stopping distance of 1815 feet, a retarding force of roughly 923 520 pounds would be required to bring the train to a stop on the 2.2% average descending grade. The 3 locomotives would deliver about 145 850 pounds of retardation due to the application of the independent brakes on the remote locomotives and the retention of full DBs on the lead locomotive.Footnote 43 The remaining 777 670 pounds would have to be provided by the 110 cars with operative brakes.\n\nDuring the emergency brake application, the retarding force of each car would be roughly 7070 pounds on the wheels or a corresponding brake shoe force of 22 090 pounds. To generate this force, the required average pressure in the brake cylinder on each car would have to be 47 psi.\n\nWith the train’s brake pipe and combined reservoir fully charged, an emergency brake application would have theoretically produced an average of 77 psi BCP in emergency.\n\n1.15.3 Brake retarding force required to hold the train stationary after the emergency stop\n\nWhile the train was stopped with the brakes applied in emergency at Partridge, the total brake retarding force required to hold the train on the 2.2% grade was estimated to be about 593 360 pounds. This force needed to be provided by the 3 locomotives and the 110 cars with operative brakes. All 3 locomotives had full independent brakes applied (72 psi on DP lead, 45 psi on DP remotes), providing a retarding force of roughly 85 060 pounds. The remainder of the retarding force needed (508 300 pounds) had to be provided by the cars (4620 pounds per car).\n\nIn order to deliver the required net retarding force of 4620 pounds, the corresponding brake shoe force would have to amount to 14 440 pounds. To generate such a force, the average pressure in the brake cylinder on each car would have to be at least 31 psi, representing an average brake retarding force per car of 40% of the theoretical maximum. If the BCP were to drop below this average, the train would not remain stationary, but would start to roll and accelerate down the grade.\n\n1.16 Air brake system leakage\n\nTrain air brake systems must be sufficiently charged with compressed air to operate as designed and to provide the expected amount of brake retarding force when required.\n\nThe air brake system on a rail car comprises many components (brake pipe, control valve, auxiliary/emergency reservoir, brake cylinder), each containing many couplings, seals, and gaskets that are prone to air leaks.\n\nAir brake leakage is the leakage that exists in any part of the car air brake equipment from the air hose coupling gasket on one end of the car to the air hose coupling gasket on the other end of the car. It is commonly categorized as brake system leakage and brake pipe leakage. Brake system leakage refers to leakage in the car control valve (CCVs) and the air storage reservoirs; it includes brake pipe leakage. Brake pipe leakage includes leakage in the brake pipe, hose assembly, angle cock, combined cut-out cock and dirt collector, couplings, branch pipe, tee, and flange fittings. Aside from system leakage, additional leakage can result from loss of air from the brake cylinders when the air brakes are applied.\n\nThe leakage of compressed air from air brake components is a fundamental problem in cold ambient temperatures. Air brake leakage typically increases with decreasing temperature, and can become quite pronounced in extreme cold ambient temperatures. Many of the seals and gaskets in the air brake system are made of rubber or a composite material. The effects of cold temperatures on rubber can vary, depending on its composition, age, and wear.Footnote 44 Also, cold temperatures are generally known to decrease rebound resilience, making the rubber stiffer and less effective at preventing leakage. This is particularly the case for air brake components with extended time in service, such as CCV gaskets, brake cylinder packing cup gaskets, and old brake pipe flange gaskets.\n\nIf the leakage of compressed air becomes excessive, or interferes with the normal operation of the air brake equipment, the brakes may not apply at all, produce less than the expected amount of retarding force, or unintentionally release after a period of time. A car that does not provide the expected amount of braking force does not fully contribute to the retarding force on a train.\n\n1.16.1 Detection of air leaks during brake tests\n\nThe leakage of compressed air, and the effects of air leakage, can be detected when freight cars and locomotives undergo various tests and inspections, such as the No. 1 brake test, the single car test (SCT), and the brake cylinder leakage test (which is only performed as part of the SCT).\n\nBrake inspection and various test procedures are covered in the industry-approved AAR Standard S-486,Footnote 45 in TC-approved Railway Freight and Passenger Train Brake Inspection and Safety Rules,Footnote 46 and in CP’s GOIs. These procedures evaluate the functional response of the CCVs for service and emergency brake application commands, as well as the proper release of the brakes.\n\nFor more information, see Appendix B – Inspection and testing of air brake systems.\n\n1.16.2 Compensating for air brake system leakage\n\nThe air brake system has 2 important features that are designed to compensate for air leakage:\n\nQuick service limiting valve (QSLV) BCP maintaining: during service brake applications, CCVs maintain the BCP to approximately 8 to 12 psi, regardless of the air brake application in effect. The QSLV functionality is inoperative during an emergency brake application because the brake pipe pressure is reduced to 0 psi.\n\nBrake pipe pressure maintaining: locomotive automatic air brake valves provide brake pipe pressure maintaining to replenish the loss of compressed air due to leakage effects.\n\n1.16.2.1 Quick service limiting valve brake cylinder pressure maintaining\n\nCCVs incorporate a QSLV, which regulates the BCP between 8 psi and 12 psi in response to a minimum reduction brake application (7 psi reduction in the brake pipe pressure).\n\nThe QSLV also has a pressure maintaining feature, which helps ensure that the BCP does not drop below 10 psi during subsequent brake pipe reductions when there is leakage in the brake cylinder, provided the leakage is not excessive. Figure 14 illustrates how this feature works.\n\nIn response to a brake application amounting to a 15 psi brake pipe reduction, the BCP will increase rapidly from 0 psi to about 37.5 psi. In the absence of leakage, the BCP will remain at that level and will not trigger the operation of the QSLV.\n\nWhen there is brake cylinder leakage, however, the BCP will start declining progressively over time in proportion to the leakage rate. In the example shown in Figure 14, for an initial leakage rate of 1 psi per minute, the pressure reaches 35 psi and then drops down to 10 psi in about 20 minutes. When the BCP drops below 10 psi, the operation of the QSLV is triggered. At this point, the BCP is maintained at about 8 to 12 psi, roughly the equivalent of a minimum brake application, thus preventing the car brakes from becoming completely ineffective.\n\nSince 2014, new generation CCVs can also include a brake cylinder maintaining (BCM) feature in addition to the QSLV pressure maintaining feature. BCM is available not only for minimum brake applications, but also up to a full-service brake application. More information on this feature is provided in section 1.23.2.\n\n1.16.2.2 Brake pipe pressure maintaining\n\nWhen there is leakage in the air brake system, whether from the cars’ air brake components or the car-to-car end hose coupling, the air needed to replenish the leaked air comes from the brake pipe. To compensate for the loss of air in the brake pipe, locomotive automatic brake valves have a brake pipe pressure maintaining feature that allows compressed air from the locomotive air brake system to flow into the brake pipe in direct proportion to brake pipe leakage. The air is supplied at a controlled rate to avoid causing an unintended release of the train brakes.\n\nDuring service brake applications, brake pipe pressure maintaining allows the selected brake pipe pressure reduction to be maintained for long periods of time. This feature allows a train to descend a long mountain grade with the brakes remaining continuously applied as needed. Otherwise, controlling train speed on long descending grades would be difficult.\n\nWithout brake pipe pressure maintaining, leakage will cause the brake pipe pressure to continually decrease after the brakes have been applied. This can cause an undesired reduction in brake pipe pressure resulting in an increase in braking effort on the cars, leading to a potential stall condition of the train on the descending grade. Eventually, the brake pipe pressure will drop to 0 psi.\n\n1.16.3 Effects of air leakage on brake application propagation\n\n1.16.3.1 Leakage from the car control valves\n\nWhen a reduction in brake pipe pressure is made from a locomotive to apply the brakes on a train, the pressure reduction at the locomotive will propagate outward as a pressure wave along the brake pipe. At the same time, the function of the locomotive automatic brake valve will change from pressure-maintaining mode (supplying air into the brake pipe) to pressure-reduction mode (brake pipe reduction).\n\nOnce the pressure reduction wave reaches each individual car, the pressure differential between the brake pipe and the auxiliary reservoir will normally cause the CCV balancing valve to allow compressed air to move from the auxiliary reservoir into the brake cylinder to apply the car brakes. However, the presence of excessive air leakage through the CCV service portion can create a localized reduction in brake pipe pressure and interfere with how the CCV responds. Consequently, a small brake pipe pressure reduction, such as 1 to 2 psi, can become diminished and attenuated to a point where it is insufficient to further reduce the pressure drop induced by the leakage. If this happens, the CCV may not respond to the brake pipe pressure reduction and fail to make the desired brake application.\n\n1.16.3.2 Leakage from the auxiliary reservoir\n\nThe leakage of compressed air from a car’s auxiliary reservoir is another factor that can negatively impact the total amount of brake retarding force on a train.\n\nThe auxiliary reservoir is connected to the brake pipe through the CCV. If leakage from the auxiliary reservoir becomes excessive, to a point where the reservoir pressure drops 1.5 to 2.0 psi below the brake pipe pressure, the CCV will initiate a localized, undesired release of a car’s service brake application.\n\nAuxiliary reservoir leakage is difficult to detect. Since the leakage is typically not audible, it can be easily missed during walking, drive-by, or pull-by inspections, such as the ones performed as part of the No. 1 brake test. Also, under the inspection conditions of the No. 1 brake test, the leakage seldom results in a brake release. For these reasons, a test for auxiliary reservoir leakage is required when performing an automated single car test (ASCT).Footnote 47\n\nSCTs, however, are performed infrequently. In addition, unless the car is equipped with a 4-port adapter connection that allows the SCT apparatus to be connected directly to various parts of the air brake system, there is no quantitative way to directly check for auxiliary reservoir leakage during an SCT.Footnote 48 On cars where the SCT apparatus must be connected to the end-of-car air hose, auxiliary reservoir leakage can only be indirectly assessed through 2 different tests: the multi-step system leakage test and the brake cylinder leakage test.\n\nThe multi-step system leakage test (described in AAR Specification S-486, Section 3.5) is used to detect system leakage in general, not auxiliary reservoir leakage in particular. The test measures the overall leakage of compressed air from the car’s brake pipe, auxiliary and emergency reservoirs, combined dirt collector and cut-out cock, and all brake pipe couplings. When leakage is detected, the source could be any of these components. The maximum allowable system leakage rate during this test is 225 cubic inches per minute.\n\nAs its name indicates, the brake cylinder leakage test (described in AAR Specification S-486, Section 3.14) is designed to check for brake cylinder leakage and measure the leakage rate. For this test, the brakes must remain applied on the car for 4 minutes and the measured change in BCP due to leakage must be less than 1 psi during the last minute, i.e., 1 psi/minute. If the brakes release during this test, it can provide an indication that the auxiliary reservoir is leaking and that the leakage rate is greater than 145 cubic inches per minute.\n\nFigure 15 shows the effect of auxiliary reservoir leakage on a brake application. In this example, air leakage of 145 cubic inches per minute (the maximum allowable leakage rate from the auxiliary reservoir) was induced in the auxiliary reservoir, a 10 psi brake pipe reduction was made, and the brakes were held for 5 minutes, which was 1 minute longer than the time stipulated in the S-486 brake cylinder leakage test. At the end of this extended-duration test, an undesired brake release occurred.\n\nThe occurrence train comprised a mixture of cars, some equipped with a 4-port adapter and some without. It is possible that some of the cars had developed auxiliary reservoir leakage in excess of 145 cubic inches per minute since their last SCT, which went undetected during various field brake tests, leading to an undesired release of the brakes during a service brake application on these cars.\n\n1.16.3.3 Leakage from the brake cylinder\n\nThe leakage of compressed air is expected to occur from a rail car, particularly during the colder winter operating season. The leakage rate can vary considerably from car to car depending on several factors. Most of the leakage that may occur will not interfere with the proper operation of the car’s air brake system, nor is it detrimental to the car’s brake effectiveness. The brake cylinder, however, is one air brake component that can be critically affected by leakage. The effectiveness of the air brakes on a car is dependent on the amount of initial pressure that builds up in the brake cylinder in direct response to a brake application command from the controlling locomotive and how long the pressure is retained. The loss of BCP on a car due to leakage will reduce the brake force provided by the car. A brake cylinder that has a significant amount of leakage may completely bleed off in emergency to the point where the brake shoes no longer contact the wheel tread surface, rendering the brakes completely ineffective. A car that does not provide the expected amount of braking force does not fully contribute to the retarding force on a train.\n\nTo compensate for leakage, the locomotive automatic air brake system will provide brake pipe pressure maintaining to replenish the loss of compressed air due to the combined leakage that occurs throughout the train. While this is highly beneficial, the brake cylinders on a car are only pressure maintained to a maximum of approximately 8 to 12 psi, regardless of the air brake application in effect. For the vast majority of train operating scenarios (that involve operating trains on grades of less than 1% and other locations where brake applications are only required for a few minutes), this amount of BCP is more than adequate to safely control train speed and stop the train whenever required. However, brake cylinder leakage can be particularly problematic for a heavy-weight train descending a long grade where the air brakes will remain applied for a longer duration. For example, descending the 13.5-mile Field Hill grade at 15 mph requires air brakes to remain engaged and provide a constant amount of brake retarding force for over 52 minutes.\n\nThe maximum allowable brake cylinder leakage is 1 psi per minute during a 1-minute test interval, per AAR Standard S-486, Code of Air Brake System Tests for Freight Equipment - Single Car Test. With leakage of air from the brake cylinder, even within acceptable limits, the force exerted by the piston is reduced, resulting in less effective braking on that car.\n\nAs an example, at an average leakage rate of 1 psi per minute on each car, the occurrence train would have lost 52 psi of BCP on the descent of Field Hill, which represents an 81.3% loss in braking capacity. Nearing the bottom of the descent, the remaining BCP on the train would have been the equivalent of a minimum reduction brake application (7 psi), which would have been insufficient for the train to maintain the maximum allowable speed of 15 mph.\n\nBrake cylinder leaks are worsened by the deterioration of packing cup gaskets due to aging and wear, as well as by the degradation of the grease lubricating the packing cup system. These leaks are accentuated in cold temperatures, when rubber packing cups, gaskets, and grease harden and contract. At the time of the occurrence, there was no requirement to perform periodic maintenance on rail car brake cylinders. Therefore, brake cylinders could remain in service for long periods of time.\n\nBrake cylinder leakage remains the second highest cause of failure during the single car test, after CCV failures (Figure 16).\n\n1.16.3.3.1 Brake cylinder leakage after an emergency brake application\n\nWabtec Corporation (Wabtec) performed tests on its 150-car AAR-approved test rack to measure the change in BCP following an emergency brake application with various induced leakage rates.Footnote 49 The brake equipment in the test rack apparatus emulates braking systems on 50-foot cars. Figure 17, derived from these tests, represents BCP degradation for various leakage rates. It describes the evolution of BCP after an emergency application, as all pressures start at around 77 psi at time zero for a fully charged air brake system. The graph shows that, for an initial leakage rate of 0.5 psi per minute, the drop from 47 psi BCP down to 31 psi (the pressure at which the brake force becomes insufficient to hold the occurrence train stationary on the hill) will take about 6600 seconds (1 hour and 50 minutes).\n\n1.16.3.4 Other factors affecting the propagation of air brake applications\n\nExcessive brake pipe leakage can also result in degraded performance of braking effort after a split reductionFootnote 50 when there are extended time intervals between the successive brake pipe reductions. When the pressure maintaining function is active, the air flow into the brake pipe clashes with the brake pipe exhaust, rendering it insufficient for some CCVs to properly sense and respond to any subsequent brake pipe pressure reduction that may follow the initial minimum brake application.\n\n1.17 Monitoring the brake pipe air flow\n\nThere are various types of air flows associated with the operation of the air brake system, such as charging flow, release flow, and applied flow. A flow indicator in the locomotive cab provides useful information about these different flow conditions, whether changing or steady-state.\n\n“Charging flow” refers to the flow that occurs while the brake pipe and the air storage reservoirs on the cars are being filled with compressed air. The maximum flow occurs immediately after the LE releases the train air brakes. The flow will gradually reduce and eventually level off to a steady-state value once the brake pipe and car air storage reservoirs are fully charged.\n\nAfter the brake system is fully charged, any “steady-state flow” that exists indicates the brake pipe is being pressure maintained to compensate for leakage from the air brake system. The amount of flow is proportional to the leakage, and there may be no evident flow if minimal leakage exists.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, when brake pipe pressure is reduced to apply the brakes on a train, the air flow value decreases and stabilizes again to a steady-state value.\n\nA rise in air flow when the air brakes are applied is referred to as “application flow” or “applied air flow” and is indicative that one of the following undesired events could be occurring:\n\nthe brakes on the train are releasing (unintentionally); or\n\nthere are other sources of air leakage, notably leakage through the bottom cover exhaust port of the New York Air Brake (NYAB) DB-10 service portion of the CCV and/or leakage through the brake cylinder packing cup gasket.\n\nIn the presence of leakage from CCV service portions or brake cylinders, the air flow in the brake pipe will increase rather than decrease when a brake application is made. This will result in the additional flow of compressed air from the brake pipe through these sources of leakage. This will, in turn, trigger the locomotive brake pipe pressure maintaining feature to re-engage to:\n\nreplenish the air that is being leaked through these air brake components; and\n\nmaintain the air pressure in the brake pipe.\n\nFigure 18 shows the 3 different flow conditions associated with the operation of the air brakes.\n\nOn a DP train, air flows not only from the lead controlling locomotive, but also from operative remote locomotives, which serve as additional air brake pressure control points and provide supplemental sources of compressed air for brake pipe charging and pressure maintaining. The air flow contribution for each of the linked DP locomotives is individually displayed on the DP operations screen that is monitored by the LE. The total air flow being supplied to the train’s air brake system is the combined total coming from all DP locomotive air sources.\n\n1.17.1 Air flow measurements and brake system leakage\n\nWabtec investigated changes in brake pipe air flow associated with degraded brake system performance.Footnote 51 The investigation involved analyzing selected LER data files, as well as conducting a series of laboratory tests on a 150-car test rack, to examine the response of the air brake system to various leakage conditions. Some of these tests were designed to re-create additional leakage effects that are known to occur on brake equipment that has outlived its effective service life, particularly when operating in cold-temperature environments. This research and analysis effort, based on leakage and air flow assessments, yielded new insight that can be used by industry, and particularly LEs, to better assess leading indicators of and diagnose degraded braking efficiency.\n\nThe rack test data confirmed that, for a constant leakage rate, brake pipe air flow decreases when brake pipe pressure is reduced to apply the brakes on a train. The data also confirmed that larger brake pipe pressure reductions will result in a proportionately larger decrease in air flow. As the Wabtec test report states, in part,\n\nThe corresponding brake system analogy is that the air flow with the brakes applied – ‘applied flow’ - will be less than the flow with the brakes released – ‘release flow’ for any given condition.Footnote 52\n\nAdditional rack tests were conducted to measure the impact on air flow when the leakage rate was increased, to re-create the effect of additional sources of leakage on some of the cars when the air brakes are applied. For the tests, various levels of brake cylinder leakage were induced on 75 of the 150 cars in the test rack. Table 6 shows the change in applied flow associated with various levels of brake cylinder leakage when the 90 psi brake pipe pressure was reduced by 10 psi. These tests were focused on the brake cylinder leakage, and therefore CCVs were not included as a source of leakage, although defective CCVs can also have gaskets that leak and this can vent pressure from the brake pipe, reservoir, and/or brake cylinder.\n\nTable 6. Applied air flow vs leakage on 75 cars with a 10 psi brake pipe reduction (Source: TSB, based on E. W. Gaughan, “Applied Flow Diagnostics - Hidden in Plain Sight”, submitted for the Air Brake Association conference, Minneapolis, Minnesota [September 2019]) Brake cylinder leakage rate (psi/min) Brake pipe air flow with 10 psi brake application\n\n(CFM) Total change in brake pipe air flow compared to no leakage\n\n(CFM) 0* 8.6** n/a 1 10.7 2.1 2 12.2 3.6 5 16.1 7.5\n\n* no brake cylinder leakage\n\n** flow decreased by 1.4 CFM compared to 10 CFM flow with the brakes released and with no leakage\n\nA brake cylinder leakage of 1 psi/minute (the AAR S-486 maximum acceptable limit during an SCT) on 75 of the 150 cars will result in an increase of about 2.1 CFM in applied air flow after a 10 psi brake pipe reduction. Double-digit increases in applied air flow when brakes are applied would indicate excessive brake cylinder leakage, as well as leakage at CCV gaskets.\n\nFigure 19 shows how the demand on brake pipe flow increases to compensate for various rates of brake cylinder leakage. The graph presents results of tests performed on the Wabtec 150-car test rack using a minimum brake pipe pressure reduction (7 psi). If all 150 cars on the rack had leaking brake cylinders at a rate of 3 psi/minute, the total increase in applied air flow would only be about 10 CFM. An air flow increase of this magnitude would be noticeable only when there was already air flow of 20 CFM or greater circulating in the brake pipe (flow below 20 CFM is shown as 0 on the locomotive air flow meter).\n\n1.17.1.1 Applied air flow readings before the emergency stop\n\nShortly after departing Alyth Yard, the inbound LE noticed an increase in brake pipe air flow whenever the air brakes were applied (see section 1.17.2 for details). These applied air flow events occurred while bringing the train to a stop for train meets at Keith, Banff, and Eldon. In addition, a sudden and unexpected increase in air flow appeared shortly after making a 7 psi minimum brake pipe pressure reduction as the head-end of the train was starting to descend Field Hill. About 8 minutes later, when the brake pipe pressure was further reduced by 3 psi, another applied flow was observed.\n\nData from the event recorder on the UP 5359 mid-train remote locomotive show a sudden and unexpected increase in air flow of up to 35 CFM a few seconds after a brake pipe reduction during the initial descent into Partridge. This is illustrated in Figure 20.\n\nJust prior to the emergency application, 3 incremental brake pipe pressure reductions of 2 psi each were made. However, there was no air flow reading following these reductions because the brake pipe leakage was diminished, due to the following reasons: the brake pipe pressure was reduced; there was not enough time to lapFootnote 53 the brake pipe reduction and activate the pressure maintaining feature to generate increased air flow; and the total flow was less than 20 CFM.\n\nSources of increased air flow may be due to air brake system leaks, where\n\n[…] brake equipment that has outlived its effective service life may result in generating leakage only when the brake is applied. Defective control valves may vent brake pipe, reservoir or cylinder pressure when applied. Leakage out of brake cylinders will result in a decrease in pressure to the threshold of the quick service limiting valve or the brake cylinder maintaining feature resulting in an increase"
