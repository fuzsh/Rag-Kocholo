        "text": "PREFACE\n\nEditor's Note: This text comprises the preface to the first printed edition (1987) of the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History and as such its history of the city ends in 1987. It was written by several historians who had extensive expertise in the city's history for different time periods. Robert Wheeler of Cleveland State University (1796 to 1860 section); Robert Weiner of Cuyahoga Community College (1861-1929 section); and Carol Poh (Miller) (1931 to 1980s section).\n\nCleveland is a city of paradoxes. It is a sprawling metropolis and a small town. It is a city that pioneered in social reforms of all kinds, and yet it is a bastion of conservatism. Founded and developed by a small group of Protestants from the New England and Middle Atlantic states, it is peopled by members of over 50 ethnic groups representing every part of the world and many of the world's religions. It is a blue-collar city that supports a unique cultural complex—University Circle—composed of nationally acclaimed institutions, and a park system—the \"Emerald Necklace\"—surpassed by none. A \"city of cooperation,\" it became famous for confrontation politics. Cleveland's past is filled with soaring achievements, such as the building of the iron, steel, and oil industries, and a great transportation network of railroads and waterways. Its past is filled, too, with missed opportunities and reverses, such as the failure to become the center of the electrical, automotive, and aviation industries despite the prominence of these enterprises within the city during the early 1900s. Recently the decline and decay of heavy industry that has plagued the cities of the Northeast has made some of these missed opportunities doubly regretted as the traditional economic backbone of the city has disappeared. Nevertheless, and perhaps because of these paradoxes and changes, Cleveland's story is exciting and vibrant. It is filled with personalities who have made contributions as spectacular as electric street lighting, and as small as the modern golf ball. One writer rightly called Cleveland and its history \"the best kept secret,\" but it deserves to be known, and that is the goal of the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History.\n\nThis work is the first history in encyclopedic format of a modern American city. It is, we hope, an up-to-date, accurate, and comprehensive account of every important aspect of the city's past. A number of histories have been written about Cleveland. One of the essays herein, \"Histories of Cleveland,\" demonstrates the evolution and breadth of historical inquiry into the city's past. However, the last comprehensive history was written over 4 decades ago. In the intervening years, not only has the city greatly changed, but, more important, historians have broadened their definition of urban history to include much more than the great men or events in a city's past. Given this chronological gap and new areas of intellectual inquiry, it seemed appropriate that Cleveland's history be updated in an encyclopedic format where a multitude of professional views could be brought forth on all aspects of local development. Fortunately, rich new resources were available to support such inquiry, as the article \"Libraries and Historical Societies\" attests.\n\nThe task of fully exploring Cleveland's history has been enormous. It has taken nearly 6 years to plan and arrange for the writing of this volume. It contains over 2,500 articles, of which more than 2,300 are shorter factual accounts of individuals, events, and institutions that will serve as a ready reference source for facts relating to nearly every aspect of the city's past. We have included the good and the bad, so while one can find a sketch of Cleveland's notable Progressive mayor Tom L. Johnson, he can also find an entry relating to the city's fiscal default in 1978. Similarly, the many articles relating to businesses and industries not only detail their rise but in many cases also trace their decline in the post-World War II period. Taken as a whole, the business and industry entries provide a stunning exploration of the effect of 'internationalization on a local economy. Nearly 170 of the articles are longer reflective and interpretive examinations of major topics in local history prepared by local and national specialists.\n\nHAMLET IS FOUNDED: 1796-1824\n\nCleveland was founded at the intersection of the CUYAHOGA RIVER and Lake Erie, primarily because it was thought to be an ideal location for an agricultural center. The site was part of the WESTERN RESERVE, a portion of land extending from the Pennsylvania border 120 miles westward and 80 miles southward, comprising 2.5 million acres, which was sold to the CONNECTICUT LAND CO. by the state of Connecticut. While the land company and MOSES CLEAVELAND made a correct assessment of the location, they failed to realize that commercial development was a long way off. In the interim, many came to the site seeking a good place to live, raise their families, and harvest bountiful crops—they were often disappointed. Throughout the first 30 years, there was no harbor at Cleaveland (this spelling was gradually replaced—the modern spelling will be used hereafter), because the entrance to the river was blocked by sandbars that forced goods and passengers to be off-loaded onto smaller vessels in order to land. Moreover, the miasmic floodplain with its numerous swamps produced an environment filled with disease, which claimed the lives of many early settlers and convinced numerous others to move elsewhere. It was these elements, the commercial potential and the sickly atmosphere of the location, that determined much of the early history of the hamlet and the township that surrounded it.\n\nFormation: 1796-1800.\n\nThrough a series of protracted negotiations, the state of Connecticut had retained rights to western lands granted to it by a 17th-century charter. In order to settle this claim, the state was granted the \"Western Reserve\" tract in the Northwest Territory. Connecticut decided not to administer the land itself and sold it to a hastily gathered group of investors called the Connecticut Land Co. in Sept. 1795. The company wasted no time making arrangements to send a surveying party. One of its first jobs was to select the site for a capital of the Reserve. First, however, the Indians in the area had to agree that the land was owned by the company, because the grant from the U.S. did not remove Indian claims. Fortunately for the company, these claims were weakened by a series of battles that took place in western Ohio and ended in the defeat of the Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in the fall of 1794. The treaty that followed reserved for Indian use a rectangular tract beginning with the western bank of the Cuyahoga River and proceeding westward for about 60 miles and south for about 40 miles. The area east and south was open to white settlement. Finally, with only 60% of the Reserve available for survey, the Connecticut Land Co. sent its surveyors in the spring of 1796.\n\nMoses Cleaveland and the 40-odd members of the party confirmed the company's title to the land in a meeting with the Indians near Buffalo and proceeded to the Reserve, arriving on 4 July. As the constitution of the company had directed, the principal town was laid out as quickly as possible. Cleaveland landed at the future site on 22 July but did not finally select it because he needed to get \"more information of the extent of the ceded land and the traverses of the Lakes and Rivers.\" He did indicate his assessment: \"I believe, as now informed, the Cuyahoga will be the place. It must command the greatest communication either by land or Water of any River on the purchase or in any ceded lands from the head of the Mohawk to the western extent or I am no prophet.\" Two weeks later, his investigation was complete; he was at the mouth of the river \"to lay out [the] capital town,\" he told Zethan Butterfield on 20 Aug. When Cleaveland specified communication as the chief reason for his decision, he used the word in several ways. His immediate goal was to use the river to transport men, food, and the awkward instruments quickly to the interior in order to survey it. Fortunately, it was possible to go up the river 25 miles in a small boat. Had that been his only purpose, he could have established a temporary camp at the mouth, but he laid out the capital because he saw the commercial prospects of the river, which was navigable for lake sloops for 5 miles and for smaller vessels to the portage if the river was cleared of debris. That was a large \"if,\" because little support for improvements to the river and harbor was forthcoming until the 1820s.\n\nThe town was planned to conform to New England and New York models of agricultural villages, because that was the heritage of the surveyors. While the surveyors did their best given their knowledge, other plans that would have incorporated the commercial potential of the area would have been preferable. In any case, the central feature of the plan was a 10-acre PUBLIC SQUARE, which was placed on the plateau near the ridge overlooking the riverbed. The square was divided by Ontario St., which ran north and south and was 90 feet wide. The east-west street, Superior, was 40 feet wider than Ontario because it led to the river bank, where most of the river and lake traffic was expected to come into the town. Lots were laid out in an orderly fashion and made ready for sale by 1797, but virtually all of the \"capital\" was uninhabited for several years, and only gradually were the plots mapped by SETH PEASE and AMOS SPAFFORD cleared and settled. Consistently throughout the first decade, the company demonstrated that its primary goal was not settlement but quick sale for profit. Little encouragement was given, and no improvements were granted by the company to the capital site. In fact, other than a crude road cut through the woods from the Pennsylvania border to Cleveland, the company was interested only in land distribution. To that end, as soon as the final surveys were completed, tracts were chosen by lottery in Jan. 1798. At the same time, the company gave lots in Cleveland to several early residents because their presence encouraged other paying settlers. The lottery system itself made settlement haphazard, since investors picked land of varying qualities from separate boxes, which prevented them from owning contiguous tracts. Therefore, settlement of the entire Reserve was not orderly, and Cleveland, on the western edge of open land, was even more isolated. Some adventurous settlers did come to the area before 1800. They were more rugged frontier types interested in trade with Indians and supplying newcomers than they were farmers. The typical inhabitants during these first years did not stay long near the river: they either left the area altogether or moved to nearby townships away from the sickness that had begun to affect those who stayed near the village site. Undoubtedly, the most notable resident of these early years was LORENZO CARTER, who built a large log cabin where others could lodge and who quickly controlled most of the Indian trade. Others, such as JAMES KINGSBURY, NATHANIEL DOAN, and Ezekiel Hawley, came and liked the general area but moved out of the immediate Cleveland area. In Apr. 1800, Lorenzo Carter was the only resident of Cleveland.\n\nSurvival Assured: 1800-1811.\n\nWhile the number of immigrants to the Reserve did not meet the expectations of the Connecticut Land Co., towns such as Warren had begun to grow significantly. In all of the Reserve, according to the federal census of 1800, there were 1,500 people. Ten years later, the number had grown to 17,000 in the Reserve, but to only 10 families in Cleveland. The reasons for this discrepancy are found in the pattern of migration from the East and in the problems with the site. Land in the Western Reserve was owned by residents of Connecticut, but most of them were content to remain landholders rather than become colonists in the new territory. Therefore, northeastern Ohio was not settled wholly by or even by a majority of settlers from Connecticut. Many residents were from other New England states, and 20% were from New York. Apparently, those in upper New England (Vermont and New Hampshire) as well as those from western Massachusetts were more likely to move in the early years of the century. These areas had been opened for settlement after the Revolutionary War, and many who went there did not find the prosperity they had hoped to achieve. Therefore, they were willing to move. Sometimes they moved to New York State first, and then on to the Reserve.\n\nFortunately, there were positive signs that Cleveland would be a political center, which helped bolster long-term prospects. First, the entire Western Reserve was declared part of the U.S. in 1800, which opened the way for formal political organization. The same year, Trumbull County was created to encompass the Reserve, with Warren as its county seat. Significantly, Cleveland was made one of the 8 townships in the county. Of course, it would have been proper to name Cleveland the county seat, but because there was little population at the site, there was little need for a county seat in the area. It was also likely that new counties would be created quickly. Just 5 years later, Geauga County was formed from a portion of Trumbull, which included Cleveland. In 1807, the state legislature created Cuyahoga County, and after some debate, Cleveland was named the county seat in 1809 over the objections of its more populous neighbor, NEWBURGH. One additional form of recognition came when the federal government made Cleveland a port of entry in 1805 and appointed a collector to monitor trade from Canada as well as lake and river traffic. Each of these political changes added formal government responsibilities and officers to implement them. Throughout this early period, the primary political divisions were the township and county: no formal offices were created for the hamlet itself. The earliest positions insured that local elections were properly run and that the basic rules of government were observed. Because there were relatively few adult males in the entire township, many of them served in several offices simultaneously.\n\nSeveral factors combined to inhibit long-term settlement in Cleveland. Early on, a conflict emerged between the rough group of settlers who lived \"under the hill\" near the river and those who thought the group was detrimental to the development of Cleveland. SAMUEL HUNTINGTON wrote to Moses Cleaveland on 10 Feb. 1802 that it was difficult to convince prospective settlers to stay, because Lorenzo Carter was \"gather[ing] about him all the itinerant Vagabonds that he meets with out whom he gets all his labour done for their board and Wiskey: over whom he has an absolute control—organizing a phalanx of Desperadoes and setting all laws at defiance.\" Gideon Granger included these fears in a letter he wrote on 20 Oct. 1804 declaring his intention to settle in the Reserve. He said, \"Cleveland has a Thousand Charms but I am detered from pitching on that place by the Sickness, the poorness of the Soil and the Inhabitants under the hill.\" Granger correctly identified the most important factor limiting the size of the hamlet—sickness. The most prevalent disease, described by contemporaries as fever and ague, was malaria, which affects its victims over a long period of time and debilitates them so they are more susceptible to other diseases. The Cuyahoga had changed its course to a new channel before the beginning of white settlement, and the abandoned channel had formed an extensive pool of stagnant water, which bred the mosquitos that carried the disease. Some residents observed that dry seasons reduced the problem, but none knew the cause or the cure.\n\nIn the wake of these realities, the population of the area grew slowly, which retarded institutional development and stunted economic progress. From 1802 to 1810, the entire township grew from 76 adult males (or about 200 people) to 300 people, and the hamlet itself managed only 57 residents by 1810. Political institutions were established quickly, but social and economic structures lagged behind. There were some cultural stirrings when a local lending library was formed in 1811 by 16 of the 18 families in Cleveland, and the Freemasons established a group, but formal schools would not appear until later, and no churches were organized, so the settlers relied on the occasional visits of missionary clergy such as JOSEPH BADGER. Residents were hampered in their attempts to prosper economically, because most were still in debt for their land and had not recovered from the expense involved in moving. In addition, they were forced to pay exorbitant prices for what they needed without having any way to earn money. The company turned a deaf ear to requests such as the one made by Huntington on 15 Nov. 1801 for funds to improve the harbor so that \"our Salt, Iron, Potash, and Sugar Kettles and such Bulky articles\" would cost less to buy and so that \"we might supply the Ohio Country, if we had a harbour for Vessels, cheaper than they can be supplied from Pitt.\" Without this help, most residents planted crops in the marginal soil and bartered locally, for there was little hard money on the Reserve. They were aided by several local mills that ground flour and produced rough boards. Apart from these mills, the first signs of commercial life were the establishment of a merchant store in 1808 and the building of several lake vessels. One other positive sign was the opening of several communication links with other areas. In 1806, the company funded a road that connected Buffalo with the eastern boundary of its lands, where it joined the road to Cleveland. Impetus was provided for other roads when the western portion of the Reserve, which remained in Indian hands, opened for settlement as the result of a treaty in 1805. A road through this section from Cleveland to the Huron River opened 4 years later. In addition, Elijah Gun operated a ferry across the Cuyahoga to aid travelers and settlers. For all these reasons, the potential of the capital had grown, for it was now in the center of the Western Reserve.\n\nHamlet as Village: 1812-1824.\n\nDuring the 12 years that ended in 1824, Cleveland became a community with an adequate social and institutional base, a supportive political structure, and an economy poised to expand rapidly. Jessie Harris wrote home to Vermont in 1824 that Cleveland was a thriving town with 9 stores and 3 taverns. He added that there were 6 vessels owned in Cleveland constantly sailing the lakes and that all kinds of merchandise could be bought. He concluded that a canal from the Ohio River was scheduled to enter Lake Erie at the village site. Increased lake traffic and the likelihood of a canal terminus meant a total of 500 residents by 1825.\n\nThe population of all of Cleveland Twp. was only 605 in 1820, but even though it was not the most populous township in Cuyahoga County or the Reserve, it was the most significant commercial and manufacturing force in the area. A series of social and cultural institutions were founded in the years after the close of the WAR OF 1812, and political recognition of the hamlet as a village was successfully promoted in 1815. After years of accusations of irreligion, 4 churches were founded between 1815 and 1820. That same year, a Sunday school opened to keep idle boys off streets on the Sabbath, and within its first 3 months, 30 \"scholars\" attended weekly classes in reading, appearance, and behavior. Traditional schools were also founded during this time but were funded privately, since taxpayers were unwilling to take on the additional financial burden. A more socially motivated school designed for adults promised dancing lessons to students in 1820. Other cultural opportunities ranged from traveling exhibitions to a series of lectures on topics of the day. Displays of wax figures and a demonstration of gas were licensed by the village in the 1820s. Even before this time, several plays were performed, including weekly performances by a group called the Wags of Cleveland at the Shakespeare Gallery. By far the most impressive secular cultural institution was the Cleveland Forum, which held weekly meetings during the winter. Subjects for 1823 included \"Is Love a Stronger Passion than Hatred?\" \"Are Agricultural Societies Beneficial?\" \"Ought the United States to Tax Unmarried Men over Thirty?\" and \"Is Slander Cause of More Mischief than Flattery?\" One of the topics clearly met with approval, since in May 1823, the first meeting of the agricultural society was called. It was timed to coincide with the court of common pleas session in Cleveland, which would bring a large number of people to the village. Many informal social contacts were made at these sessions, where much business of all kinds took place. In sum, by 1824 these activities reflected a significant change from the frontier survival period. Furthermore, Cleveland had a newspaper beginning in 1818, which informed the growing local community and acted as an advocate of its growing importance.\n\nAs cultural activities increased, the social structure of the area became more differentiated. One observer noted that most Clevelanders did not dress fashionably. He found the typical dress of Cleveland women rather plain, and that men generally dressed in homespun cloth except on special days. However, some men and women did dress with good taste, many of whom were political and commercial leaders of the town. At the other end of the social spectrum, which admittedly was not as broad as that in eastern society, a number of poor appeared. The township warned several families to leave its jurisdiction to prevent their becoming dependent on the village and later paid for the removal of one family and for the funeral of another person. Other than court days, the 4th of July brought many members of the fledgling community together, perhaps because it celebrated both the founding of the nation and the date when Moses Cleaveland and his party entered the Reserve in 1796. In any case, there were elaborate celebrations for the time. Village leaders met to plan a celebration in 1819. All residents were invited to join the procession from Merwin's Hotel to the courthouse to hear the Declaration of Independence by REUBEN WOOD, Esq., and then to enjoy dinner at the Commercial Coffee House. Two years later, a list of celebrations in the Herald included 3 separate events for the area. Clearly, these events differed in tone from the early social problems between those under the hill and other residents.\n\nCultural opportunities and social differentiation complemented political changes, which gave the hamlet a measure of autonomy when it became a village in 1815. This new status required a village administrative structure, including a president, 3 trustees, a recorder, a treasurer, and a marshal. While the title of village was new, prominent political officeholders already knew who would be appropriate, and consequently the offices went to a small number of people. With the exception of the first year, there was only one treasurer before 1825, ASHBEL WALWORTH. Two men, DANIEL KELLEY and LEONARD CASE, served all but 2 of the 10 years as president of the village; Horace Perry was recorder for the 1810s, and Eleazar Waterman from 1821 to 1825. Horace Perry was recorder from 1815 to 1819, president in 1820, and a trustee from 1821 to 1825. During these same years, he also served the township as treasurer for 3 years, as justice of the peace for 7 years, as clerk for 3 years, and finally as trustee for 2 years. Clearly, Perry was one of the most important decision makers in Cleveland before 1825. Taken as a group, village officeholders were important economic leaders in both commerce and manufacturing.\n\nPerry and his peers passed a series of rules governing the hamlet, which guaranteed a more orderly society and signaled the gradual end of the frontier period. In the first years, residents recorded earmarks that identified their animals, but by 1820 animals were a nuisance in the hamlet, and a set of ordinances regulated them. For instance, swine and cattle could not run in the streets, stray geese could be killed, and horse races were banned. Social controls prohibited discharging firearms or obstructing village officers. Economic regulations required all weights and measures to be sealed by the village inspector and all residents to use the village hay scales also run by the village inspector. The village fathers ruled that parents were liable for offenses their children committed. While these measures did not insure a peaceful, obedient society, they did suggest that most villagers preferred order to the disorder of the early years.\n\nVillage politics during this period were service-oriented, with few real rivalries. The most active races and the most significant political activity occurred on county, state, and national levels. Cleveland was the site of many political meetings to form slates of candidates for upcoming elections. Each township in the county sent 2 delegates to a county convention in 1818 to select a slate of candidates, for instance. Later the group published their preferred list in the Cleveland paper. On the national level, John Sloane ran against Peter Hitchcock for Congress from the area, but Sloane received few votes in the area because the people were not convinced by his recruiting sergeants. In spite of this lack of local support, Sloane won the election. On the state level, residents began to request aid through their representatives for harbor improvements and for communications with the south as early as the beginning of the 19th century. Proposals for funds to open a road to the south and to build a canal over the portage between the Tuscarawas and the Cuyahoga were presented, as were various plans to open the harbor. Generally, these requests failed. However, the most economically important one, the location of the canal terminus, succeeded after years of impatience. The idea was an old one, but the state legislature first seriously considered a canal proposal in 1817, the same year the Erie Canal in New York began construction. Two years later, legislation to incorporate a company to build a canal between Lake Erie and the Ohio River was before the state senate. After weeks of speculation on the great benefits this canal would bring to Cleveland, the Herald reported in Feb. 1819 that the bill was lost because the legislature had appointed several engineers to identify all practical routes. Fortunately for the Cleveland area, ALFRED KELLEY, a state legislator from Cleveland, served on the new commission. Over the next several years, each potential route from the lake to the river was surveyed. The politics were so intense that Kelley asked the Herald in 1822 not to publish news on the canal commission because it created regional jealousies, and he assured the public that no decision had been made. It would not be until Feb. 1825 that the final decision to locate the northern terminus where the Cuyahoga empties into Lake Erie was announced. While lake traffic would have continued to come to Cleveland, the location of the northern gateway in Cleveland was crucial to the quick rise in its fortunes. The positive impact that discussion of the canal had on the hamlet and its economic prospects was enormous and was undoubtedly the product as much of political influence as of sound engineering judgment.\n\nPolitical help from the national level came slowly. As early as 1818, the hamlet petitioned Congress for funds to improve the harbor but failed. Consequently, all passengers and goods were landed on the shore in light boats. Six years later, Congress did allocate money for a lighthouse on Lake Erie, but at Grand River, not at Cleveland. Efforts to obtain funds to remove the sandbars and to build a public pier would wait until after 1824. Despite these setbacks, the economic history of Cleveland from 1812 to 1824 improved significantly after a shaky start. The War of 1812 helped Cleveland become a trade center, since supplies were stored in the hamlet and soldiers camped near the town, but the Panic of 1818 hurt economic opportunity, because it made barter pervasive and credit difficult to obtain. Finally, in the 1820s, lake traffic increased and the canal discussion intensified. Evidence of prosperity was nearly everywhere by the mid-1820s. The port of Cleveland was thriving by 1824, when exports exceeded $38,000 and imports $196,000, compared with 1809, when total exports were only $50.\n\nCleveland became the commercial center of Cuyahoga County during these years. The expansion took 2 paths: wholesale and retail trade and lake traffic. Trading posts were replaced by stores in growing numbers after the War of 1812, and merchants erected warehouses as early as 1815. The next year the COMMERCIAL BANK OF LAKE ERIE opened, partially to finance business and commercial operations. While no specific proof is available, there is little doubt that this bank gave the hamlet an advantage over its rivals, since it became the focal point of important economic decisions. Predictably, it failed in the aftermath of the national Panic of 1818. The shortage of hard currency was acute in the late 1810s, and the village issued corporation shinplasters or script to help residents pay taxes. Twenty businessmen, a considerable number given the small size of the hamlet, signed a notice informing the public that they would not accept the script. Retail outlets expanded during the early 1820s as furniture, books, shoes, and general merchandise of all sorts sold in the village. No doubt sales increased, because the first bridge linking the east and west banks of the Cuyahoga opened in 1822. By 1824 there were many local merchants selling eastern goods to local residents.\n\nSignificantly, the lake trade was also increasing in the late 1810s. At the peak of the shipping season in mid-July 1818, 21 boats entered or cleared the port for Buffalo and Detroit. Indicative of the lack of significant exports, they transported household goods, stoneware, dry goods, whiskey, livestock, pork, flour, butter, grindstones, and tallow. A ropewalk opened in the hamlet to supply rigging and other necessities to expanding shipping and boatbuilding enterprises. A new era in water travel arrived in Cleveland in 1818 as the first steamboat, WALK-IN-THE-WATER, arrived and was visited by a number of gentlemen and ladies from the village. The village entered the steamboat era with the launching of the 250-ton Enterprise in 1824. By the end of this initial stage of development, Cleveland was economically tied more to the lake than to the river, since most of its gross imports and exports came from the lake. Fortunately, it had all the necessary mercantile and financial institutions in place ready to meet any increased demand.\n\nCOMMERCIAL VILLAGE TO COMMERCIAL CITY:1825-1860\n\nFrom 1825 to 1860, Cleveland, like other towns in the West, was swept through a series of changes at speeds far exceeding those experienced in the East as it quickly joined the nation in economic, cultural, social, and political terms. Cities such as Cleveland were better able to adapt to new ideas, because there was little to stand in the way—so much was to be lost by being left behind. Therefore, throughout the period, a nervous tension promoted change, while at the same time warning of the dramatic consequences of failure. Fortunately, Cleveland made few mistakes, partially because of its location and because it had sufficient reserves to make quick adjustments when needed. During the process, it quickly shed its frontier trappings to become the 19th-largest city in the U.S. by 1860. Also during the process, Cleveland participated in the passions of the antebellum era as a testing ground of what conservative easterners would become when transplanted to the Midwest. Just a few of the changes can be quickly listed to demonstrate their pace and significance: in 1825, \"the West\" was very close to Cleveland; in 1860, it was far away both physically and culturally. In 1825, canal TECHNOLOGY was supreme; in 1860, canals were virtually unused. In 1825, Cleveland was an 8-month city that stopped functioning economically when the lake and canal were frozen; in 1860, the RAILROADS kept it open year-round. In 1825, Cleveland had a predominantly native population; in 1860, only a minority were born in the U.S. In 1825, some social distinctions were just beginning to appear; in 1860, social classes existed, there was some friction between them, and there were attempts to control less-desirable elements. In 1825, political officeholders served out of self-perceived duty; in 1860, party POLITICS controlled many elections, and local residents were caught up in a plethora of national issues. In 1825, most of those in the village knew each other; in 1860, anonymity had replaced familiarity as institutions replaced personal ties. In 1825, the city had yet to expand beyond the original bounds set by the 1796 survey; in 1860, it included both sides of the river and several annexed areas.\n\nSome things did not change. Commerce continued to dominate the ECONOMY of the city. In addition, the geography of the riverbed and the high ground overlooking it on either side kept the commercial warehouses and transient housing \"under the hill.\" Fortunately, this cloistering meant that the STREETS above were healthier and free of the intrusions that plagued most cities of the era. It is no happenstance that Cleveland's tree-lined avenues and increasingly elegant residences overlooked rather than emerged from the river banks. The physical well-being of the residents did improve significantly in the optimistic times of the late twenties and early thirties. Twenty years later, descriptions of the city heralded its location and spaciousness, and local HOTELS were filled not only with businessmen but also with those who were \"summering\" in Cleveland. Visitors judged the city as one of the most beautiful in the country.\n\nCanal Village to Provincial Center: 1825-1845.\n\nThe first 20 years of Cleveland's emergence began with the construction of the canal and ended with the return of good times after a protracted depression, which began in 1837. In the process, a town developed that controlled its hinterland economically and was the focal point for culture and politics in northeastern Ohio. By far the most important single factor in the era was the transformation of the economy, for it drove all the other changes. Four events in 1825 determined the economic future of the village. First, in large part through the efforts of ALFRED KELLEY, the state of Ohio agreed to locate the northern terminus of the OHIO & ERIE CANAL at the mouth of the CUYAHOGA RIVER. Almost immediately, eastern funds began pouring into the village to take advantage of the predicted boom. Second, Clevelanders watched the progress of the Erie Canal closely and celebrated its completion in October with a dinner. More important, the Herald reported on 25 Nov. that a \"procession of about 20 carts laden with the produce of the western country, brought from Lake Erie through the canal passed through several streets of New York city ... carrying appropriate flags and banners. The produce was from Detroit, from Sandusky, from Cleveland, from Buffalo. ...\" For the near future, Cleveland did not need the Ohio Canal, because the village served as a gathering place where local farmers sent their produce destined for Buffalo, and ultimately for New York City. Moreover, the completion of the Erie Canal freed contractors and workers experienced in canal construction to come to Cleveland and begin work.\n\nA third event that contributed to Cleveland's economic future was its selection as the site of the northern terminus of the canal. Engineers determined late in 1825 that a west side route would be less expensive if a wooden aqueduct was built to take the canal across the river 4 miles south of Cleveland. Public opinion, stated the Herald on 19 Nov., \"cannot be mistaken, it is decidedly and unquestionably in favor of the eastern route.\" The final decision in favor of the east bank was made by the end of the year and sealed the relationship between the two sides of the river: retarding west side development and insuring the supremacy of the village of Cleveland. Fourth, efforts to obtain money from the federal GOVERNMENT for harbor improvements finally succeeded when $5,000 was appropriated, undoubtedly to accommodate the increased shipping requirements of the canal. With another, larger grant 2 years later, engineers successfully opened a new straight channel to the lake. The swift-flowing river eliminated the sandbars that had blocked the harbor from lakegoing vessels and removed the miasmic swamps from the mouth, which eliminated the pervasive sickness in the village.\n\nThe prosperity canal promoters had hoped for was confirmed by developments over the next 20 years. With improved TRANSPORTATION and reduced freight rates, demand for agricultural products increased along with farm productivity and prices, which, in turn, enticed more people to move to the hinterland and gave areas close to the canal a marked advantage over their rivals. In the process, the canal replaced the river route to New Orleans as a major conduit for goods headed to the East Coast from the Old Northwest Territory. Cleveland benefited particularly because it was the terminal point and a growing lake port. Consequently, it collected produce as it came north and sent manufactured goods south. Often overlooked is that Cleveland's hinterland did not include much of the WESTERN RESERVE, because it followed the canal route south to Akron, Columbus, and the Ohio River and passed through only 2 Reserve counties, Cuyahoga and Summit. The Cleveland-Akron portion of the canal was the first scheduled for completion, and construction contracts were issued quickly. As workers poured in, the cash they received for wages replaced the local barter economy and increased the number of bank notes in circulation, thereby facilitating the economic transactions. Within the year, hogs driven to Cleveland were slaughtered and sent east, and the latest goods from New York appeared in local stores. Cleveland had become \"a mart of business for this section of the country,\" according to the charter of Western Reserve College in 1826, as forwarding and commission agents appeared to send property anywhere, sell it in any market, and advance funds for property deposited with them. Less than 2 years after construction had begun on 4 July 1827, the first canal boat arrived in Cleveland from Akron with the governor and other distinguished citizens on board and was greeted by a large number of spectators who lined the hills and banks. Five years later the canal was finally completed; however, Cleveland traded with the region from Columbus north, whereas goods south of the capital went to the Ohio River.\n\nFrom 1827 to 1840, the Ohio Canal was the exclusive avenue to the lake and eastern connections by canal. The first year, flour, ashes, and butter and cheese came north, while salt, lumber, and over .5 million lbs. of merchandise went south from the village. As the canal pushed inland, the amount of merchandise grew to over 3 million lbs. in 1830, to 10 million in 1834, and to a high of 19 million by 1838. As wheat prices jumped from approximately $.30 per bushel before the canal to over $.60 in 1833, the amount of flour and wheat transshipped at Cleveland jumped 8 times by 1840, when over 2 million bushels of wheat and .5 million barrels of flour arrived via the canal. Significantly, the town's grain trade was almost totally dependent on this traffic, since, for example, in 1841, of the 461,000 barrels of flour shipped from Cleveland, 441,000 arrived by canal. By 1840, 44% of Ohio's wheat and flour came from the \"wheat belt,\" a group of counties north and east of Columbus, making it the focus of the principal grain market of the Great Lakes. The other major agricultural products, corn and pork, rose at slightly less impressive levels.\n\nNewspapers followed the rapid rise in local fortunes. The Herald commented in May 1830 that the amount of goods received by canal had already surpassed that of 1829 because of the abundant harvest and confidence in the canal. Seven years later, the CLEVELAND HERALD & GAZETTE observed that in 1832, much of the local economy had been limited to barter, and few farm products were exported, whereas now \"the rich products of the interior [are] floating along\" the docks. Enticed by canal products and aided by harbor improvements, more and more lake vessels arrived and cleared. From a beginning of 350 arrivals and departures in 1831, the annual number rose to 1,000 by the late 1830s, and nearly 1,600 by 1844 exclusive of steamboats. Vessels increased in both number and size throughout the period. Nearly 50 of them made regular stops at Cleveland with passengers and some freights. It was not unusual for a visitor by the late 1830s to see the lake and harbor filled with sail and steamboats waiting for their turn at the docks and regularly emptying large numbers of immigrants into the town. Without doubt, by the mid-1840s, Cleveland joined Detroit and Buffalo as the 3 dominant Great Lakes ports.\n\nThe dramatic increase in trade brought with it good news for the entire village and led to a period of speculative excitement. By 1830, Cleveland had 138 dwellings, 13 stores, and 15 warehouses as the banks along the river became the wholesale district. To complement the progress along the river, retail stores located along Superior indicated the beginnings of a central BUSINESS district. A residential neighborhood also emerged between Superior and the lake and Ontario and the river. Here early schools and the first church building, Trinity Church, were built. Architecturally, the village was a mix of log cabins, small frame houses, and several more contemporary buildings, with few traces of its primitive frontier beginnings. During the early 1830s, a series of real-estate schemes developed to exploit interest in tracts on both sides of the river. The floodplain on the west side was poorly drained land that had not been farmed. It was purchased by a group of Buffalo investors hoping northern Ohio would expand as Buffalo had done because of the Erie Canal. The marshlands were drained, and an elaborate hotel was built on the newly surveyed lands. Another scheme involved the development of the oxbow area of the river, which was named WILLEYVILLE and laid out in a pattern of radiating streets off a central circle. A bridge built by the investors connected it to the west side. In addition, a planned residential neighborhood, Clinton Square, located just beyond the city limits near the shore, had a central square and a goal of preserving the privacy of residents. All of these ventures temporarily raised land costs in the area, and a number of local investors did benefit. For instance, in Mar. 1835, a tavern located on the west bank changed hands at a profit of $3,000 in 1 day. Few investors received similar windfalls, however, since these ventures failed because of national economic developments. The real impact of these speculations was to raise land prices higher than they would be for 30 years.\n\nWhile some did make money, it was only temporary in most cases, for surprisingly, not all the economic news during the thirties was positive. The Panic of 1837 and the depression that followed stopped much development in the village and stifled economic advance for 6 or 7 years. Previous cyclical economic downturns had had little impact before the canal brought national markets and national problems to northern Ohio. This time the impact was widespread. Banks failed, forcing local stores to produce their own currency called \"shinplasters,\" which were not redeemable universally. These and other economic reversals doomed the dreams of many railroad companies that had been chartered by the state before 1836. Had it not been for the panic, railroad development would have been much quicker, and the era of the canal proportionately shorter. The hard times forced many new residents to leave town searching for work and housing. Also, many cultural institutions formed in the early 1830s disbanded, unable to collect dues from their membership. Only gradually did the country and Cleveland emerge from the depression by 1845.\n\nUnderstandably, the panic not only ruined speculation, it also arrested a population spurt that had begun with canal construction in 1826. The village grew from 500 to over 5,000 in the 12 years after 1825, and the west bank of the river added another 1,000 persons. The greatest jump happened between 1833 and 1835, when more than 50% of the total arrived. Through 1836, immigrants poured into the village, and Cleveland and its smaller cross-river rival, OHIO CITY, were named cities in 1836 (even though by modern standards Cleveland was more accurately a town and Ohio City a village). The panic began to limit growth almost immediately. By 1840, 7,500 people lived at the mouth of the Cuyahoga, an increase of only 1,500 in 3 years—half that of the previous 3 years. Nevertheless, Cleveland's annual growth made it the fastest-growing city above 1,000 in the state. It was able to continue to grow gradually until in 1845, 12,000 lived on both banks. Cuyahoga, led by the growing towns, became the most populous county in the Reserve by 1840.\n\nMany migrants settled in the area because of the opportunities offered by local commercial and manufacturing concerns, just as migrants had done before the canal era. The proportion of those involved in commerce grew so that in 1840, over 70% of them lived along the river at the lake. More and more workers were involved in small manufacturing establishments, which dotted the two towns. A relatively large number, over 100, worked on the west side at the CUYAHOGA STEAM FURNACE CO., the first and, for many years, the only heavy industry of importance in the Cuyahoga Valley. The firm, located on the west side partially because the east bank was crowded with warehouses, became the first of a majority of manufacturing companies established on the west side. Many workers employed by the Steam Furnace Co. arrived in the mid-thirties. Some were immigrants from Europe, but most were natives; foreign IMMIGRATION had just begun. The trend established in the late precanal period continued after 1825 as more and more settlers came from New York State, and relatively fewer from Connecticut and the rest of New England. The natives included more members from the middle and upper class who came with funds to invest in the future prosperity of Cleveland, much as the land speculators did. In 1830, the village was still overwhelmingly (96%) native. Apparently, the canal workers, who included a considerable number of IRISH, did not settle in Cleveland. European immigrants did come to the area in the 1830s. Newspapers record several self-help organizations serving Irish, GERMANS, and Scots during the decade. By 1840, it is likely that well over 25% of Cleveland household heads were foreign-born.\n\nThroughout the 2 decades after 1825, BLACKS lived and worked in the village. Their numbers were never very large, and they were not isolated residentially. Cleveland newspapers frequently reported activities of local blacks and on occasion lauded their efforts. The community formed a church in 1830 and a school in 1832. In response to the formation of a young men's union in 1839, the Herald commented on 29 Mar., \"The colored people of this city are not numerous, but of the better class of free blacks. They are industrious, peaceable, intelligent, and ambitious of improvement. A school is supported by them,\" as well as a lecture series and a library. An equally revealing statement was made by a black responding to a racist letter in the 5 Nov. 1845 Herald. He stated that there were 56 blacks from 20 families who had accumulated property of $55,000 since 1833 and were employed as canal boat owners and as stewards on boats. Without doubt, racism existed in Cleveland, but the city was a reasonably liberal environment for the times, and some blacks prospered here.\n\nThe growing population continued to become more and more differentiated as class and neighborhood distinctions grew and old conventions were outmoded. An upper social group existed in Cleveland during this time, and it was virtually all native. Several dress dances or cotillions occurred before 1845 and were attended by the town elite. Major celebrations, especially on Independence Day, were accompanied by speeches and a dinner where local leaders spoke. Signs of opulence appeared in some homes. In the 1830s, architectural design replaced the vernacular forms used previously. A Georgian-style home, the Crittenden house, built by a leading merchant, was completed in 1832 on PUBLIC SQUARE. Four years later, a more contemporary style, Greek Revival, began to take hold, and by the end of the thirties it had replaced Georgian. These new homes were brick and stone rather than wood and were much more imposing than earlier residences. While these are some indications of an elite in Cleveland, after 1845 a more conscious upper class emerged as members formed organizations to promote the city and their own particular view of its needs.\n\nIn contrast, the poor were increasingly apparent after the opening of the canal. WILLIAM CASE, a leading figure in the village, believed that by 1828, canal construction had \"brought a great many irregular—drinking and rowdy persons\" to the city and county. Six years later, in the aftermath of a Cholera Epidemic that attacked the town, the Whig on 9 Sept. 1834 said, \"The class of persons among which the disease principally raged\" was indicated by the fact that \"of about one hundred victims .... fifty-five were buried at the expense of the town.\" Many of the poor lived in the FLATS on either side of the river \"under-the-hill.\" Here the thriving economy spawned numerous \"groceries,\" which appeared on every wharf to dispense alcohol. A racecourse established in 1835 encouraged \"a flood of imported depravity, strengthened by all the canaille that could be mustered from groceries and other dens of pollution,\" asserted the Whig of 14 Oct. 1835. Although he probably overstated the situation, Case said the city council had no power to force \"suspicious persons\" looking for public support to leave the city, so that at the beginning of the panic, \"letters had been written to Ireland, England, Germany, that Cleveland took all the poor that came. In the spring of 1838, the poor came in swarms.\" Of course, many poor in Cleveland were not \"black legs\" or \"out-laws,\" especially as the depression deepened. So obvious was the need that by the end of 1837, and for several years, a group of ladies coordinated efforts to feed and clothe the poor.\n\nIn between these two extremes were the working people of the town. Most laborers had problems of their own, which included the scarcity of housing even to rent and exploitation by employers. As the population increased and canal connections brought eastern ideas and people to Cleveland, workers joined their counterparts and formed local unions. As early as 1834, journeymen printers united, and 2 years later a meeting of carpenters and joiners of both Cleveland and Ohio City demanded a 10-hour working day. The depression affected workers, and many left the town. Those who stayed probably had difficulty finding work. Just as the financial problems lifted in 1843, mechanics and laborers of both cities protested the return to barter and asserted that they would accept only cash for their services. Moreover, they promised to form a mechanics' and workingmen's society, and as one of their first acts, they held a parade where 350 workers protested their financial problems. Activity was not limited to these issues. In the early 1840s, a Mechanics' Lyceum formed, which promoted lectures on topics of interest to workingmen. All of these gatherings demonstrate an awareness among some workers that they had common interests that could best be served by united action.\n\nVirtually all sectors of Cleveland society united in one form or another during the canal era. As population increased, ethnic and racial distinctions appeared, and social differentiation took place, residents were forced to establish institutions in order to express themselves in a city that lacked the homogeneity and harmony of traditional rural society. Moreover, Cleveland became a regional center during this period by forming branches of eastern institutions. In a sense, the canal brought both commodities and ideas. The first secular organizations were imported from the East just as canal construction began. Many had a distinctly religious cast and reflected the conservative New England background of their members. A branch of the American Colonization Society, a group devoted to sending blacks to Africa, was formed in 1826. It marked the first appearance of New England conservatism, which limited local response regarding slavery to the antislavery position rather than to more radical abolitionist views. Subsequently, in 1833, an antislavery society appeared to promote these views. Another popular movement, TEMPERANCE, reached Cleveland in 1830 and continued for many years. As with most voluntary organizations, members tended to be upper-class, and the targets of their attentions tended to be lower-class. A series of groups were formed that were able to turn 4th of July celebrations in the thirties into celebrations of temperance. In 1834, for instance, children assembled from various Sunday schools, marched, and were treated to cakes, crackers, and cold water in an effort to rid the holiday of \"rum and gunpowder.\" Throughout the period, hotels and steamboats converted to temperance principles. By 1843, Clevelanders joined a national movement to restrict the sale of liquor by the drink or to individuals who were drunk, but had little success.\n\nNational movements devoted to stimulating intellectual activity also prospered in Cleveland in the 1830s. Numerous public debates took place, especially in the winter months under the auspices of local branches of the lyceum movement, which continued a local tradition founded in the pre-canal era. As we have seen, mechanics and blacks founded their own versions of this popular format before 1840. Similar groups such as the Library Association, the Polemic Association, the Cleveland Reading Room, and various young men's unions provided refuge from the growing anonymity. They were supplemented by musical organizations such as the CLEVELAND MENDELSSOHN and MOZART societies. Service groups added to the institutional maze. The MASONS continued to be active despite an anti-Masonic movement that forced them out of sight during the late 1820s and much of the 1830s. Other groups, including the International Order of Odd Fellows, began to hold meetings as early as 1841. Another segment of the community formed private military units such as the CLEVELAND GRAYS and the Cleveland Guards. Composed of native-born, they served social and ceremonial functions in addition to their role in any military actions. Just at the end of the period, in 1843, local women who had been active in poor relief through their churches formed the MARTHA WASHINGTON & DORCAS SOCIETY to administer to all poor in Cleveland. They were attempting to supplement earlier mutual-aid groups formed to preserve ethnic, racial, religious, or fraternal bonds by Germans, Irish, Manx, blacks, firefighters, and BAPTISTS. These groups supported the temporary poor through a solitary gift to help them weather a difficult time. They made up the bulk of benevolence in the pre-1845 era, and while they continued after that time, other, more far-reaching relief was necessary.\n\nReligious organizations formed quickly as population increased, and tended to be ethnically exclusive. From a beginning of 3 churches in 1830, the number rose to 12 Protestant congregations by 1845. The most prominent of these was the FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, known as Old Stone Church, built in 1834 on Public Square. These congregations formed a series of social groups within their organizations, such as Sabbath schools, Bible classes, and female benevolent societies. Two Protestant churches were exclusively German and had about 600 communicants by 1845. By far the most significant change was the formation of the first Roman Catholic parish in 1835, which built ST. MARY'S ON THE FLATS in the oxbow area 3 years later. By 1845, there were also 2 Jewish congregations. In all, the directory estimated that there were over 8,000 members of religious organizations, many of whom made the church the center of their social activity.\n\nWhile local children attended Sunday schools, Cleveland only gradually provided public EDUCATION for its citizens. Despite the rapid increase in population and in cultural and religious concerns, JOHN WILLEY, first mayor of Cleveland, told the city council in 1836: \"Our character, our manners, our habits, and our means require an entire change, the introduction of a liberal and well adjusted system of education in our city\" to replace private academies. The next year, a public school system began with a board of managers. After a shaky beginning, the system built 3 schoolhouses and was firmly established by 1845. HIGHER EDUCATION began near the end of the period, when the Cleveland Medical College opened in 1843. It immediately became successful and was viewed as one of the chief assets of the city. Other, similar institutions came only after 1845, when population and educational trends warranted expansion. Just as the school system evolved over the 2 decades, politics and city government changed dramatically. Clevelanders not only joined national movements such as temperance and antislavery, they also participated in national politics. The stylistic change to mass appeal and party politics, which had not existed in earlier years, was exemplified by a convention of 15,000 WESTERN RESERVE and northern Ohio Whigs who met in Cleveland in Oct. 1844 to ratify Clay's presidential nomination. The evolution that led to this system began as early as 1827, when the first convention was held to determine local candidates. The political preferences of residents betrayed their New England heritage, since by and large they were for Clay and the American System of internal improvements beginning in the early twenties, and they consistently opposed Andrew Jackson to the point that no Jacksonian newspaper could survive in the city. In the mid-1830s they remained WHIG, and they supported Harrison's campaign in 1840 with great enthusiasm, as they did Clay's in 1844. Newspapers became more and more partisan during the era, and much of their news emphasized political issues. There were also significant changes in local political activity, where \"caucuses\" that nominated approved candidates were necessary \"for the common good,\" according to the Herald on 9 Sept. 1835. Local party representatives established vigilance committees to police voting at each polling place and \"to use all honorable means to secure the election of the candidates nominated.\" Not all means were honorable, however, as in 1843, 3 persons convicted of voting more than once at the spring election were each sentenced to 1 year in the penitentiary.\n\nAll this conscious political activity changed the nature of officeholding gradually during the canal era. It did not, however, change the ethnicity of officers, who remained native despite rising numbers of Germans and Irish in the community. Prior to 1836, village officers seemed to continue the tradition of public service by serving several years: JOHN W. ALLEN served 4 consecutive years as mayor; T. P. May was a trustee for 5; and David Worley served 5 years as treasurer. After Cleveland became a city, the mayor and city council, consisting of a president, 3 aldermen, and 3 councilmen from each of the 3 wards, formed the government. Over the next 9 years, there was no consistent pattern of officeholding. No officer served as mayor, alderman, or councilman more than 2 years, for instance. Perhaps a writer to the Herald on 25 Aug. 1837 correctly observed that Cleveland had \"a central aristocracy composed of capitalists, [paper mill owners], and speculators\" that shared offices among its members. A brief analysis of these men shows that virtually all were wealthy businessmen, and many were deeply involved in the land speculations of the mid-1830s. It is possible that they did not need to have long-term officers, since the increasing population brought many qualified men to the city. In any case, local leaders did begin to affiliate with political parties, according to Cleveland newspapers. In 1844, the Herald suggested that since local Democrats and Whigs had each nominated a candidate for mayor, and since both were old residents, well-qualified, and popular, the election of either would be good for the city. Later the same year, the newspaper put the local election into perspective when it stated that the Democrats had won the mayoralty by 32 out of 1,100 votes cast, but the spoils belonged to the Whigs, who held 9 of the 12 council seats. The paper continued that over the last 4 years, these mayoral elections had been so close that the Whigs had won by only 14 in 1841, and then the Democrats won by margins of 12, 45, and 32. Politics in the city were partisan, it seems, but the rival factions were drawn from the same ruling group before 1845.\n\nThese city leaders had a difficult task managing the transition from village to town over the 2 decades. From a village of few regulations and few responsibilities that relied on private institutions to provide needed services, Cleveland was forced to regulate more generally and to control more city services itself. Beginning in 1829, fire protection began when the village bought a fire engine and volunteers formed a fire department. By 1836, there were 4 firehouses manned by volunteers, and a fire warden examined houses to enforce ordinances designed to prevent fires. As crime increased, the village appointed a marshal in 1832 and 4 years later formed a city watch, including 8 companies of men. Also during this time, the city regulated MARKETS and attempted to centralize them. The condition of city streets was a continuing problem. Attempts to repair the dirt roads served little purpose, since they improved mobility but were not a permanent solution. All of these areas would force more permanent solutions on the city in the years after 1845, but before then only a piecemeal approach was used.\n\nJust as efforts to provide city services did not keep pace with growing demands during the canal era, efforts to create a unified city on both sides of the river were stymied, as well. That part of BROOKLYN Twp. directly across the river grew quickly after 1830, and in the winter of 1835, a letter to the Whig stated: \"I cannot see any good and sufficient reasons why Brooklyn should not be included in the proposed corporation [of Cleveland]. The interests of one place are closely connected and allied with the interests of the other.\" On 30 Dec., a Cleveland meeting rejected including the west side, because Clevelanders did not want the opposite bank to benefit from the larger population and tax base of the east side, and because residents feared the influence it would give Brooklyn, Buffalo, and New York speculators. The rejection erupted into a year-long confrontation rooted in the view that each city was fighting for the same business. The immediate issue was the repair or replacement of a floating bridge, but by June 1836, Cleveland removed the bridge because it obstructed navigation. A replacement, the COLUMBUS ST. BRIDGE, was built on the southern edge of Ohio City, diverting traffic to Cleveland rather than letting it pass through Ohio City's business district. After several incidents of vandalism to the new bridge, attributed to unhappy Ohio City residents, a skirmish took place on 31 Oct. 1836 when an attempt was made to saw through its timbers. The bridge's destruction was prevented by Cleveland citizens reinforced by the county sheriff, but according to an Ohio City paper describing the event, the mob began to destroy the structure only after they were fired upon. Subsequently, each village established a watch to protect BRIDGES and buildings. The controversy receded after a year but left scars so deep that any discussion of unification ceased for more than a decade.\n\nThese unsettled problems did not obscure Cleveland's progress from 1825 to 1845. A newspaper commented: \"But a few short years have passed since our thriving town, (then a rude hamlet) stood upon the farther confines of the rising west.... Ours is no longer a western settlement, our children are surrounded by the comforts, the blessings, and the elegance of life.\" Within these 2 decades, a hamlet had become a commercial town justifying the foresight of its founders. It had become the capital of the Reserve. The town had expanded to over 12,000 people and was on the verge of becoming a legitimate city. It was also on the verge of several major changes that would make canals obsolete and would require more creative solutions to urban problems. During the next 15 years, ethnic consciousness increased, and the celebration of Yankee heritage grew markedly as Clevelanders coped with the final phase of the antebellum period.\n\nA National Urban Center Emerges: 1845-1860.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1860, Cleveland became a city. Economically, railroads revolutionized transportation, laying the groundwork for the transition from commerce to manufacturing. Moreover, the city joined other Great Lakes ports in promoting regional economic development. Culturally, Cleveland shed its provincial perspective to become an integral if somewhat conservative part of national trends. Local politics, too, became embroiled in national issues. Significantly, Ohio City and Cleveland united following the trend of urban annexation. Finally, on the eve of the CIVIL WAR, some Clevelanders began to record the proud history of their progress. The economy continued to be the driving force of change during these years, as canal expansion and railroad construction led all other developments. After 1840, feeder lines connecting the canal with Erie, Pa., the Mahoning Valley, Pittsburgh, and Marietta on the Ohio River ended the monopoly of the Ohio Canal's north-south trunk line as they provided alternate routes and commercial centers. These canals affected Cleveland in much the same way railroads would in the 1850s, for they strengthened its hold on certain commodities, such as grain, while they reduced traffic in other goods, such as foodstuffs. The Mahoning Canal was particularly important for Cleveland, since it opened a direct route to the interior of the Western Reserve and to the Mahoning Valley that funneled dairy products, wool, and coal to the city.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1852, canals recovered from several poor years in the mid-1840s and reached their highest levels, at the same time that railroads finally attracted enough funds to begin construction. In 1851, the canal brought 2.5 million bushels of wheat, nearly 1 million bushels of corn, .66 million barrels of flour, and 3 million bushels of coal to Cleveland, breaking records for each commodity. The Herald of 20 Feb. 1849 praised the long-term impact of the canal, saying that it had \"made Cleveland,\" because while it had cost $5 million to build, it had paid back 20 times that much. Also, without the canal, the paper estimated that the village population would have been 3,000 rather than 21,000, and its property worth only $3 million rather than $10 million. Few doubted the evaluation, and few predicted the reversal that followed. In the 9 years 185160, flour volume fell by 1/3, wheat by well over 1/2, and corn by 3/4: the canal era had virtually ended.\n\nWhile the end came quickly, prosperity in the 1840s masked the urgent need for railroad financing and meant that Cleveland was nearly left out of this next transportation revolution. Fortunately, such was not the case, for as the canal traffic reached its peak, the first rail connection was completed. Railroad promotion began in the 1830s and was revitalized in the mid-1840s. An editorial in late 1845 advocated support for a proposal to have the city of Cleveland purchase $2 million in stock of the Cleveland, Columbus & Cincinnati Railroad and added, \"It has become a matter of surprise to our neighbors that Cleveland has been so stupid upon the project of this and other railroads.\" A letter to the editor of the Herald on 14 July 1846 argued that many businessmen and active young men left the city each year to settle in younger cities and towns along the lakes, such as Sandusky presumably, which had built several railroads because it had no canal connections to the interior. Advocates of trains constantly pointed out that Clevelanders were active only two-thirds of the year; for the other 4 months, \"they burrow like animals.\" The iron horse, they argued, would initiate a year-round city. Finally, after several ill-organized attempts, the most promising line, the Cleveland, Columbus & Cincinnati (CC&C), was funded. Construction proceeded quickly, and by early 1851, plans for a celebration marking the arrival of the first train were quickly completed. By year's end, Cleveland was also connected with Painesville and Pittsburgh, and by 1853, with New York City, Chicago, and St. Louis. On the eve of the Civil War, it had become one of the major rail centers in the country.\n\nThe railroads revived commerce in Cleveland, which enhanced prosperity, but some observers saw problems unless the city's economic base broadened. Cleveland was a good place to live, said the Leader, 15 Mar. 1856, but there was \"no living spirit of enterprise.... No thinking man with capital will stop in the city when we have only our commerce to sustain us. A manufacturing town gives a man of means full scope to his ambition ... commerce alone cannot save Cleveland, as but few are benefited by it directly. Manufacturing creates a demand for merchandise, mechanical labor, all the necessaries of life, and gives tone to all legitimate business in and around it.\" Moreover, the city had all the right resources—mechanics, raw materials, places to erect factories, and cheap food prices compared to older towns. Despite these advantages, the paper continued, real-estate prices had declined for over 2 years, and some quick improvement was needed. Other arguments emphasized the ability to weather economic crises by diversifying and the benefit of wresting retail markets in the hinterland away from eastern manufacturers. Of course, manufacturing did exist in the area, and had ever since the founding of the Cuyahoga Steam Furnace Co. in the early 1830s. But as the 1853 city directory observed, investment in industry for a city of 33,000 people was much too small given \"the capabilities of this location for sustaining manufactures.\" Most of the 150 establishments added between 1850 and 1860 were small and not related to the nascent iron and oil industries. Instead, they grew because the expanding population needed agricultural implements, woodenware, furniture, clothing, and sewing machines. While the number of inhabitants who worked in these factories continued to grow, they made up only 9% of the workforce on the eve of the Civil War. Iron manufacturing was still in its infancy as the first rolling mills began to produce in the 1850s, and therefore, the opening of the mineral resources of Lake Superior had only just begun to have an impact on the FOREST CITY by 1860.\n\nBoth commerce and manufacturing attracted people to the Cleveland area from 1845 to 1860. Fueled by canal expansion, the city's population jumped by 11,000, practically doubling in the first 5 years, and tripling the 7,000 residents of 1840. The excitement generated by the completion of the CC&C railroad generated another burst, which added 8,000 between 1850 and 1853. In all, the population increased by 30,000 to nearly 44,000 at the end of the 15 years, to lead all cities in the country of comparable size with a 10% annual growth rate. Other cities in northeast Ohio grew slowly from 1850 to 1860 in comparison; these increases, while not equivalent to that in Cleveland, were the beginning of a significant rural-urban movement as the proportion of urban residents in the Western Reserve rose. Clearly these changes suggest the continuing trend toward greater population concentrations. Another continuing trend was the rising proportion of foreign-born emigrating to Cleveland. At mid-century, the native-born made up only V3 of household heads in Cleveland, and only 2/5 of those in Ohio City. A decade later, both sides of the river were under 30% native, compared with 33% for German-born and 22% for the Irish-born residents. This native minority benefited from the influx of Europeans, who held occupations at the lower end of the economic ladder. Natives filled virtually all skilled positions, such as machinists and shipwrights, as well as more white-collar occupations, including merchants, physicians, and boatbuilders. Irish residents were at the bottom of the ladder. Half, who had no steady employment, were listed as day laborers, and the remainder had semiskilled jobs, such as shoemakers and sailors. Virtually no Irishmen held white-collar jobs. In contrast, 25% of the Germans were skilled craftsmen, and many semiskilled Germans worked in the more dependable building trades rather in the seasonal work along the wharves, as did the Irish.\n\nEconomic differences and preference concentrated the various ethnic divisions more and more in their own areas of the city. On the west side, for instance, the Irish began to dominate the lowlands near the river and the hillside leading onto the heights, where many natives lived in the fashionable FRANKLIN CIRCLE area. Germans made up less than Vs of the west side, except in a new residential area away from the lake south of Bridge St., where they constituted 7/3 of the households in 1860. These concentrations had their east side equivalents but should not be viewed as ghettos, since many residents were not forced into them by discrimination but chose to live close to countrymen. However, the increased presence of foreign-born undoubtedly raised ethnic consciousness in the city. A newspaper editorial on 18 Feb. 1851 offered a formula of assimilation that few followed when it advised foreigners to immediately become \"Americanized\" by \"casting off\" their European skins and encouraged natives to welcome them as brothers. Throughout the period, ethnic groups, especially Germans, created numerous organizations to preserve their languages and cultures in addition to the self-help groups formed in the 1830s. Germans added a German-language newspaper in 1846, a military group, the German Guards, in 1847, and a music society in 1848. In the 1850s, many Saengerbunden, German singing societies, were formed, and in 1859 the city hosted a North American SAENGERFEST, which included a group of 400 singers from Cleveland representing 24 separate local societies. Local churches expanded, as well, and by 1860, there were 6 German congregations. Some attempts to preserve culture were not successful, especially when they seemed to oppose AMERICANIZATION. The Ohio City Council denied a request to form a separate German school in 1853, for instance, but it did agree to print a city ordinance regulating dogs in both English and German.\n\nOther ethnic groups did not form as many private organizations. Irish residents relied on churches and schools for their cultural activities, even though there were some organizations such as the HIBERNIAN GUARDS and the Irish Naturalization Society of Cleveland. By 1860, there were 4 churches and 7 parochial schools in the city. Throughout the period, there was little mention of the Irish in the newspapers. A great deal is made of the formation of the FATHER MATHEW TOTAL ABSTINENCE SOCIETY in 1851, which brought many Catholics into an essentially Protestant movement and promised an end to the heavy-drinking Irish stereotype that pervaded Cleveland newspapers. Immigrants from Scotland and the Isle of Man, who did not receive such negative characterizations, formed self-help organizations and were able to report in 1856 that only 1 countryman from each group had ever received city aid.\n\nBlacks, too, increased in numbers and continued to associate in organizations for their social and economic improvement. They never made up more than 2% of the population, and they were not isolated residentially. Blacks worked at many levels of the occupational scale: 1/3 were unskilled; 45% were skilled; and 20% were semiskilled. Of course, serious questions of racism concerned all blacks. Three meetings held in Cleveland in 1847 considered a petition to Congress asking for enough land in a western area for blacks to form their own government and send representatives to Congress, but rejected it because slave-holders controlled the legislature. Several churches created new opportunities for religious and social activities, as did the Colored Young Men's Union Society, a debating club, and the Colored Association of Cleveland. The plight of blacks was explicitly highlighted by a newspaper, the ALIENED AMERICAN, published in 1853. The court system seemed to treat blacks with some fairness; a white in 1849 was found guilty of killing a black and was sentenced for the crime, while in 1854 a black man charged with raping a white girl was freed after it was learned she \"did not sustain a good character.\"\n\nThe local upper class had formed a tight-knit society that entertained itself and attempted to control the destiny of the city. After 1845, when Cleveland became a boom town, one could have measured the social and cultural evolution of the upper class, because they began to copy eastern styles as quickly as they appeared in the East. By the late 1840s, Gothic houses had begun to replace earlier Greek Revival styles, and architectural provincialism had all but disappeared as eastern architects brought the latest fashion to Cleveland. A decade later, Italian villa designs such as the one built by AMASA STONE appeared along the posh section of EUCLID AVE. Stone's home featured rosewood and mahogany highlights and a heating system with a fireproof furnace that sent heated water to nearly every room. The house was the finest in the city.\n\nThe Protestant upper class did become more physically separated from the growing congestion of the central city, but at the same time it became more concerned with benevolence. What had been the purview of a few devoted wealthy women and ethnic self-help groups became an effort of prominent male leaders to instill the values of their heritage, especially self-discipline and Protestant morality, into the poor. Moreover, these leaders turned the attention of private and public organizations more toward the idle and begging class than to newly arrived immigrants or the ill. In so doing, they forged a movement that wished not only to help but also to control, as much out of fear as out of concern, and as further evidence of a growing class consciousness. There was legitimate reason for concern. The number of poor increased as the city population increased and as the cyclical downturns in the economy forced more newcomers out of work. Poor relief was a real problem, and when unemployment increased in 1856, the city provided outdoor relief. A survey of the beneficiaries concluded that 47% were Irish, 22% German, and only 12.5% \"Americans.\" Throughout the 1850s, while the local economy weathered the panics reasonably well, each downturn reduced the number of workers dramatically, thereby increasing the number of needy.\n\nThe bulk of city residents fell between these two extremes. The working population continued to form groups to protect its interests during the late 1840s and 1850s. Cleveland's GARMENT INDUSTRY employed mostly women, and they protested wages and treatment in 1848 and formed a sewing society 20 years later. For a short time they ran their own shop. Throughout the 1850s, economic problems increased union activity. Most workingmen settled in areas where they could afford housing. On the west side, housing costs dropped after the speculative boom of the thirties, and prices stayed low so that in contrast to Cleveland, separate houses were available to most people, and \"nearly all had breathing room.\" Further opportunities meant that a large number of \"men of small means\" could buy lots on the west side, build houses there, and be nearer to work than those who had to live farther away from their work to afford housing costs on the east side. Less-affluent laborers and workers clustered around Lorain and south and west of Pearl. Consequently, financial considerations, along with ethnic loyalties and xenophobia, created residential segregation by the end of the antebellum period.\n\nA great variety of private and public institutions were founded between 1845 and 1860 to accommodate the growing complexities of city life within a national cultural context. Some organizations, such as antislavery or temperance, expanded their activities and involved more than residents. In Cleveland, church leaders from congregational and Presbyterian churches dominated the abolition affiliates. While Cleveland was not a hotbed of ABOLITIONISM even in the 1850s, it was a stop for a few prominent abolitionist lecturers, including Frederick Douglass and Cassius Clay. One shortcoming of the city that kept it from more radical ideas and, in part, reflected its general propensities was the absence of an abolitionist press and the conservative editorial policies of the city's daily newspapers. More in keeping with its conservative New England heritage was local support for antislavery. Throughout the 1850s, some runaway slaves were helped, mostly through the efforts of local blacks, and occasionally by whites. Such actions were illegal, according to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, but many Clevelanders were proud of their defiance. The most dramatic indication of local sentiments was the excitement generated by the OBERLIN-WELLINGTON RESCUE and fugitive slave trial, when 37 rescuers were jailed. Throughout the proceedings, which took place in Cleveland, crowds gathered, and at one rally 10,000 attended. At the same time, soon-to-be-martyred John Brown, then a fugitive because of his actions in Kansas, stayed in the city. When he was hanged for his role at Harpers Ferry, flags flew at half-mast and bells tolled in Cleveland, partially because he represented courage and freedom in spite of his unacceptable methods.\n\nIn politics, local business leaders tried to replace Representative Joshua R. Giddings with a candidate of more moderate views on slavery but failed and were forced to rely on him. Throughout the 1840s, Clevelanders supported antislavery Whigs, but in the 1850s they joined the movement led by Giddings and others through the successive stages of antislavery parties from FREE-SOIL to the Whig-Free-Soil-Independent Democratic party known as the Republicans. So while local leaders and voters were reluctant followers of this limited national shift, they joined the organizations and were committed by the eve of the war. The temperance movement in Cleveland followed a similar path, as it too became involved in politics. The Washingtonians, a group prominent in the 1840s, expanded the temperance cause and paved the way for the SONS OF TEMPERANCE and the Independent Order of Good Templars. Both of these fraternal organizations offered fellowship and social events but were primarily devoted to protecting their numbers from drink and elevating their politics. Gradually in the 1850s, they became more active in politics. In 1853, they could not obtain a temperance position from either major gubernatorial candidate, so the Cleveland Temperance Alliance supported a Free Soil-Democrat. As we have seen, there were also Catholic temperance groups formed after the 1851 visit of Father Mathew, a protemperance priest. The numerous groups often participated in 4th of July parades to counteract the portrayal of intemperance among immigrants and offered direct aid to countrymen.\n\nPrivate relief groups also sought to aid the poor in more systematic ways. The SOCIETY FOR THE RELIEF OF THE POOR, formed in 1850, and its successor the Relief Association, as well as the Sons of Malta, were upper-class, male-dominated groups that gave aid to those poor who were deserving because of their moral character and potential for improvement. Typical of the terms of relief were the stipulations of the City Mission of the Euclid St. Presbyterian Church, which stated that \"no continued or permanent relief [would] be granted any family ... not ... connected with some Protestant [congregation]\" and that they would be subject to periodic visitations to determine whether they were worthy of help. By the mid-1850s, leaders of these groups realized that they did not have the resources to deal with the problem and consequently began a campaign to have the government assume more responsibility. Uncared-for children created another problem, which church groups helped solve with the formation of the Protestant Orphan Asylum and similar Catholic institutions in the early 1850s. In addition, the Ragged School was founded to attract children too poor to attend public schools. Some of these institutions, especially the Ragged School, were partially or totally funded by the city after private efforts proved insufficient.\n\nNot all voluntary groups sought to solve urban problems; some sought to improve the social and intellectual environment of their members. German MUSIC groups proliferated in the period, and in 1854 the Cleveland Academy of Music opened. From the foundation laid in the 1830s and partially destroyed by the depression of the 1840s, the CLEVELAND LIBRARY ASSOCIATION revived and by mid-century had a collection of more than 2,000 volumes. Moreover, business leaders who were involved in church groups and other benevolent societies also formed a Board of Trade here where they could discuss economic issues and meet peers. Fraternal associations such as the Masons and Odd Fellows met throughout the period. Social and athletic clubs such as the Ivanhoe Boat Club, the Cleveland Cricket Club, the Cleveland Chess Club, and local gymnasium groups all prospered during the period. In fact, SPORTS activities and public celebrations increased markedly in the 1850s. Horseracing revived and became an annual event, drawing as many as 3,000 people. Foot races and baseball also took place. By far the most popular celebration occurred annually on the 4th of July; it attracted 40,000 people in 1858. Residents also had opportunities to attend countless musical concerts and plays. In 1853, a theatrical rendition of Uncle Tom's Cabin played to 12,000 people in 15 performances.\n\nChurches grew rapidly as they attracted new communicants. The number of Protestant congregations nearly tripled over the course of the 15 years, to 34, and they supported 38 Sunday schools. Just as the social order became more differentiated, so too did local churches. As we have seen, some church leaders were members of the local upper class who built new church buildings reflecting their own stature, and others took an active role in the political issues that permeated all levels of society. Churches after 1845 followed Gothic and Romanesque designs imported directly from the East. Political and moral beliefs were enmeshed in the antebellum period inevitably, and some local congregations felt the effects. In Mar. 1850, PRESBYTERIANS who favored abolition formed their own church. Catholic churches continued to expand, as well, so that in 1860 there were 4 separate churches. These congregations supported several orphan asylums and 4 parochial schools, including a seminary.\n\nThe realization that private institutions could no longer handle many urban social problems caused city government to take over some institutions founded by voluntary associations and to create others. The city poorhouse had served few poor in the late 1830s and 1840s, since private groups provided considerable aid, but as the problem increased, a Poorhouse & Hospital was built to house the sick, insane, and indigent and aged poor. The City Infirmary could minister only to meritorious cases who had been residents for at least 1 year. In 1857, the Ragged School, which had been founded by private groups, was taken over by the city. Its goal was to change \"scholars from dangerous to industrious citizens.\" The city also saw the need for expanded educational opportunities for all residents. From 1846 to 1860, the number of school buildings rose from 13 to 17, and the number of students from 1,500 to 6,000. A Board of Education, formed in 1853, directed the system. In addition to the Ragged School, renamed the Industrial School in 1857, which trained poor youth, a high school opened in 1846 that trained those who wanted to learn the higher branches of education; and a night school opened in 1850 to aid those who needed to work but wished to learn, as well. In all, public education had virtually replaced private education on the eve of the Civil War, since only 3 secular schools remained in Cleveland in 1860, whereas a quarter-century before, nearly all pupils had attended private academies.\n\nOther city services increased to meet the demands of the growing population. One obvious sign of the number of newcomers was an 1848 city ordinance placing street signs at various corners. Public utilities were also in demand. Water from wells supplied homes, but the business district needed a larger amount, which was provided when a large holding tank was constructed in 1849. It proved insufficient, so by 1856 a system was built that pumped lake water to the KENTUCKY ST. RESERVOIR on the west side and then distributed it. Gas lighting was introduced to downtown streets and buildings in 1850 and gradually spread south and east from Public Square, along the main streets going east and to the west side. Street surfaces continued to be a problem throughout the period, as surfaces constantly needed repair and as a primitive sewage system designed to drain main streets proved inadequate. Partially because of this problem as well as crowded housing, the city appointed a public health officer in 1856 and formed a board of health as a permanent structure, which replaced earlier boards created to deal with specific emergencies. Fire and police protection kept pace with other changes. Cleveland had 10 fire engines and a volunteer group of 500 firemen to cope with the growing number of fires. Police protection expanded as the small watch forces of the 1830s were replaced by a formal police department that employed 40 patrolmen by 1860. More local station houses appeared in immigrant communities and other areas where crime was more prevalent. The justice system also expanded to meet new demands, as a police court was formed in 1853. In addition, a federal district court was established in the city in 1855 as a result of the increasing financial position of the city.\n\nAll of these new services sought to make living and working better in a new city. The long, difficult period of contention between Cleveland and Ohio City ended when they united in 1854. The two had cooperated on bridge and harbor projects in the 1840s, which initiated attempts to unite them in the early 1850s. The reasons were obvious: the river would be under one authority; the harbor would receive federal money more easily; property values, especially of Ohio City lots close to the Flats, would increase; and administration would be streamlined. Nevertheless, while 88% of Ohio City voters wanted union, Clevelanders rallied behind an antiunion assault and rejected the proposal in 1851. Three years later, the issue returned with new benefits. New taxes, increased real-estate values for the east side business district, access to \"fresh, pure water\" from the west side's system, and the addition of the industrial capacity of \"manufactories, iron works, machine shops, and warehouses\" apparently convinced Clevelanders, who voted 4 to 1 in favor of union. Ohio City voters also approved annexation. The terms of the merger created 4 west side wards and guaranteed that a bridge joining the two banks would be built within 2 years, but also insured west side dependence by reserving revenues and assets of each before the union to that side exclusively. Cleveland benefited immediately because Ohio City brought a commitment to manufacturing and helped turn it away from commerce.\n\nLocal politics became more complex after the union, since more local offices were available as the number of wards reached 11 and the office of alderman was abolished. Just as religious and secular organizations became involved in national politics, so too did local elections. In the canal era, there was a constant turnover of officeholders as the pool of available men grew, but after 1848, officers often served more than 2 years, probably because of the rising effectiveness of local parties. Their new tactics included efforts to muster German and Irish voters, beginning in 1852. Three years later, the DAILY TRUE DEMOCRAT reported on 15 May a rather strong reversal of this approach, and one that was in concert with a national native American political movement, the Know-Nothing party. The paper reported that a crowd of \"jackasses and hyenas and bawdy house bullies\" had taken over the polls in the 1st and 2d wards, refusing to allow any anti-Know-Nothing foreigner to approach. All Germans were kept from voting and were beaten if they attempted to come too near. Whether these tactics continued is not known, but the Democratic party won virtually all the municipal offices in 1856. Clearly, local politics had become more organized and effective in the prewar years. Local connections to national parties were important as the rather conservative political views of many residents gradually joined the national trend to the left. Through the 1850s, Clevelanders supported Franklin Pierce over Winfield Scott in 1852, Fremont over Buchanan in 1856, and finally Lincoln in 1860. This shift toward the Republican coalition placed the area in the mainstream of American politics, just as it had gradually joined the economic and cultural mainstreams by the close of the antebellum period.\n\nBy 1860, Cleveland was one of the most beautiful cities in the country, with all the prospects associated with urban centers. It had matured quickly even by 19th-century standards. When the Herald compared the first city directory, published in 1837, to the one 20 years later, it saw major changes. Travel to Cincinnati had taken 80 hours by canal in 1837 but took only 10 in 1857. The number of names in the directory had increased from 1,300 to 11,000, while the number of factory workers had grown from 200 to 3,000. Other, more subtle differences included the rising separation of the city into a wholesale and commercial zone, a central business district, and numerous residential neighborhoods distinguished from one another by the quality of the houses and the spacing between them. This differentiation was not only economic but also social and cultural, as various institutions with more and more distinctly ethnic identities replaced the informal relationships of the pre-canal era. In effect, the social spectrum had widened, and organizations reflected this broadening. Cultural efforts to preserve traditional values by cultural associations became increasingly popular as many groups, especially natives, felt threatened by the majority foreign-born population. Conservative easterners had found ways to preserve their values by cultural associations and by joining national movements with a conservative bent. They also were able to form a ruling group that controlled the local economy and local politics. Urban problems and governmental solutions signaled the end to the era of voluntary associations providing most of the social services to the community. In the final analysis, in spite of all its problems, Cleveland in 1860 was a fully developed city with a brilliant economic future and a population capable of meeting the challenges it would present.\n\nRobert Wheeler, Cleveland State University\n\nTHE NEW INDUSTRIAL METROPOLIS: 1860-1929\n\nIntroduction. The 7 decades from 1860 through 1929 were the most exciting, eventful, and complex in Cleveland's history. From the beginning of the CIVIL WAR to the onset of the Great Depression, Cleveland rose from a small commercial city of 43,000 people to an industrial metropolis with a population nearing 1 million. During such a period of growth, the events, the people, and institutions loom bigger than life and were essential to the city's growth. The Civil War was a traumatic event for many Clevelanders who saw their sons and husbands and brothers off to fight for the Union cause, some never to come back. The whole city and surrounding population mourned the death of Abraham Lincoln, and everyone (an estimated 90,000 people) walked past the slain president's body, mounted on a catafalque in PUBLIC SQUARE. But the wartime boom had thrust the little commercial center on the road toward 60 years of industrial growth. Young JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER and Maurice B. Clark took the profits from government contracts to their produce-wholesaling business and invested in the new petroleum refining industry. SAMUEL MATHER, along with Otis & Co., went from iron-ore mining and smelting to the production of steel. In 1870 Messrs. Sherwin and Williams launched the paint-and-varnish industry in the city. Increasing numbers of immigrant groups, attracted by new jobs, families, and friends, populated Cleveland neighborhoods. Urban cultural institutions, such as the colleges and universities, the CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART, the WESTERN RESERVE HISTORICAL SOCIETY, and the CLEVELAND ORCHESTRA, were founded. Civic leaders such as TOM L. JOHNSON and NEWTON D. BAKER made the industrial metropolis a model for the 20th century city. WORLD WAR I, at the other end of the time period, further accelerated Cleveland's growth, attracting an internal migration adding to the already large foreign population and pushing the city into a period of suburban growth symbolized by the VAN SWERINGEN brothers' dual development of the suburb of SHAKER HEIGHTS and the downtown Terminal Tower complex.\n\nThese events and many more are important, and their story is fully told in other parts of this volume. But, in order to find meaning and to make sense of the bewildering array of particular achievements occurring during this 70-year period, one must step back and view it as a whole. In doing so, one begins to see the overarching continuities and the interrelations in trends. This section, therefore, will examine the growth of the city topically, over the whole period, treating the ECONOMY, demographic growth and change, geogr"
