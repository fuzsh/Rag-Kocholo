        "text": "Sanah Ahsan’s I cannot be good until you say it is as masterful as it is moving, and as inspiring as it is an exercise in reflective thinking. Presented in four parts, the collection is expertly curated. rich in emotion, and ripe of liberation that expands and extends far beyond the collection’s opening and closing pages.\n\nThe collection’s fifty poems (and LISTENING ROOM) are heartfelt and full of love– love for self, for community, and for possibility. The pieces weave tenderness and musicality with a tone as warm and as penetrating as echoes of the lives of which the poems speak. The Outspoken Performance Poetry Prize winner is gorgeous in ways that escape simple description and inspire deep admiration. The collection, and its takes on queerness, Islam, Quranic verse, family, nourishment, and more, offers lessons on how to live, question, and write with intention. Whether in community with strangers or at a table with familial and/or familiar faces, the poems breathe, in part, generational traditions, harms, and healing. The result– a buffet replete with “Ancestral recipes” in their many forms, queries of family, and questions as worthy of extended reflection as answers.\n\nThe debut collection embodies love, prayer, and spirituality through exquisite use of language and intentional use of space. The pieces are complex and layered in ways that mirror the human condition, the human body, and the politics of life and suffering. The collection takes on, in part, the body’s complexity with words that of piercing precision that also soothe like chamomile alongside wounded wombs and complex cycles of love, life, and (mis)understanding.\n\nWith an epigraph– “for the Divine in you”, the collection exists at the intersection of poetry and prayer and invokes and invites continued contemplation. The collection is a beginning rather than an end. The individual poems stand stronger together, with each simultaneously a breath of blessing and prayer, rumination and education, celebration and caution, grief and joy. Together, I cannot be good until you say it, is a gift of a gorgeous and sublime tapestry of questions fueled by curiosity and questions grounded in rich, descriptive detail.\n\nFor example, PASSPORT opens with –\n\n“Veiled by tablecloth, my girlfriend swats\n\nmy hand, a fly on her knee. The teaspoons\n\nare touching in public. Her grandmother\n\noffers me a salami stick to start. Sorry I\n\ndon’t eat pork….”\n\nand closes –\n\n“...I reach for relief in the rainbow when her\n\ngrandmother asks do you have a British\n\npassport? The burgundy-red stamped with\n\na golden crest moves more than my limp\n\ntongue. I muster up the lion’s courage to ask\n\nare we going somewhere?”\n\nReading the collection is a journey– one where time stands still, while always going somewhere, and the water, depth unknown, is welcoming and deeply moving, while also surprising. Beyond expert craft, the collection is much a story of kin, becoming, and conflict as a spiritual guide and reckoning. With themes of god and “good” revealing and repeating throughout the collection, Ahsan writes fearlessly and with a piercing insight that compels as it conspires to create both heightened awareness and a deeper understanding of what it means to love and be loved, to be liberated and to liberate, and to revel in the joy, music, and sadness of the written and spoken word and its many graces as well as offenses.\n\nStitched of love and yearning, the work is an exquisite and tender example of how poetry can be prayer and prayer can be blessing. The experience of reading this work is spiritual and spirited. Beyond its emotional qualities the work instructs in elements of craft and form. The collection is as varied as it is remarkable.\n\nFrom powerful erasure —\n\nSee\n\nto inventive lists and couplets (see, for example, FUGITIVE ARRANGEMENTS and PINK MURMURATIONS),\n\nto inventive use of space (see, for example, IN THE MAN OF MIND and GREY IS PROPHETIC COMPLICATION),\n\nand poignant photographs (see, for example, pages 11, 51, and 72), the work is a tapestry as much as a reflection of life and its complexity. The work is also a master class on how and where devotion meets daring inquiry with a result that grips as it reminds one of the extraordinary power of poetic inquiry to transform and to touch in ways simultaneously new and reminiscent of past and ongoing harms.\n\nA delicate waltz, an electric tango, a surprising twist of hip hop – if a collection of poems could dance one’s way into the heart and soul of eternity, this work would. I end the work where I began– eager to read more and to continue to learn. Much like the cycles of ancestors and conflict that have come before, the work itself balances retrospection with introspection. I won’t forget this work, and I hope, dear reader, you enjoy the collection as much as I have.\n\nHow did you come to poetry? What role does it play in your life?\n\nI became interested in poetry through the “folk rock” music of the 1960s, especially the poetic lyrics of songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Buffy Sainte Marie, and Joni Mitchell. However, Leonard Cohen was the first lyricist whose published literary poetry (as well as the extraordinary postmodernist novel Beautiful Losers) I went out and bought. After reading, nay, experiencing his first few volumes of poetry I knew I had to try my hand at it as well. Once I was seduced by the power of the written word, writing became an extension of myself like breathing, eating, talking, walking, sleeping, dreaming…\n\nYour poems are often very located. How does place influence your writing?\n\nEven early on I was attracted to “place” in the work of poets I admired. I traveled to Montreal just to walk down St. Catherine Street because Cohen referred to it so much in Let Us Compare Mythologies, his debut collection. I later became obsessed with James Dickey and Richard Hugo; both of whom utilized “place” as an integral part of their poems. Think of the former’s “Hunting Civil War Relics at Nimblewill Creek,” and “Cherrylog Road, or the latter’s “West Marginal Way” and “\"Degrees of Gray in Philipsburgh\". Likewise, I found the work of Lisel Mueller strewn with place names that lent an authenticity that would not be available to the poems otherwise. I’m still obsessed with naming places in my past in order to memorialize those moments when I inhabited those places in real time.\n\nYou are the Director of the Stratford Public Library. Have you always known you wanted to be a librarian? In what ways has being a librarian influenced your writing or shaped the way you view the arts?\n\nI never had any intention of becoming a librarian until I read a biography of Philip Larken, the poet librarian of Hull University’s Brynmor Jones Library. Suddenly a light came on: I always delighted in browsing through stacks upon stacks of books in the literature departments of public and academic libraries in Philadelphia where I lived at the time, but I never thought about a career in librarianship until the Larkin bio. I had finished up graduate school and most of my classmates were going on to their doctorate studies in the English Department at Temple or other universities. I had taught at Temple as an adjunct instructor, but I was more interested in writing as a vocation than teaching as a career. Instead of pursuing a Ph.D, I decided on a MLS and applied to Clarion University’s Library Science Department.\n\nBefore being appointed to a director’s position, I also worked both as a reference librarian as well as a children’s librarian. But most of my time was spent as a cataloger, which is becoming something of a lost art. Still, the seven years I spent assigning locations to new material and deleting weeded material sharpened my eye for clarity and consistency, and my cataloging skills I believe carry over to my poetry: I never attempted “a systematic derangement of the senses” as described by Rambaud (a dysfunctional childhood was derangement enough for me); instead; I pursued a consistent clarity in the anecdotal narratives that are at the heart of my poems. There’s such a strong narrative impulse in my work I sometimes think of myself as a recovering novelist (ha, ha).\n\nI think libraries and poetry get shortchanged in their conceptualization (by larger society) as exclusively quiet, reserved, and introspective spaces. In your chapbook, Library Suite, you describe libraries as energetic and interactive places steeped in connection. How did this chapbook come together? What do you think the future looks like for libraries?\n\nI’ve always believed that libraries were more than mere depositories for books, and I’ve labored to make Stratford Public Library—as is the case with most other 21st century libraries—an active resource of the community. This strategy allows for a diversity of programming: we offer culinary workshops, literary readings, classes in embroidery, presentations from representatives of State agencies, as well as ongoing programs such as Story Time and Lego for our younger patrons and Book Club, Book Café, and Crafter’s Corner for our adult patrons. We also make it a point to reach out to our senior patron population, often an underserved community, by offering senior-friendly high teas and chair-yoga sessions.\n\nMy chapbook is an attempt to document some of my experiences (some factual, some imagined, some a hybrid of the two) in Library Land these last couple of decades. Some poets don’t care to write about their professions, but I’ve always been drawn to writing about the various hats I’ve worn as waiter, teacher, librarian—once I even sold lightbulbs as a telephonic vendor! I’ve been often able to utilize my diverse working background in my career as a librarian.\n\nSome predicted the end of libraries with the advent of the digital world: why go to a library when all the texts and information you desire is as close as your computer’s keyboard? We can all appreciate the instantaneous gratification that comes from access to the Internet: Ah, you found that new book by your favorite author and you can download it right there in your living room at 3am without having to wait until morning when the bookstores or libraries open. Who can resist such expediency? Still, there are those who prefer browsing the stacks at Barnes & Noble and/or their own local libraries for the undeniable tactile pleasure of holding the physical properties—weight, texture, smell—of a book in one’s own hand. We’ve already moved into a hybrid age for libraries where eBooks can be downloaded from their virtual website but hardcopies of books are still housed in physical buildings for patrons who prefer to choose their reading material by hand rather than keyboard. Rather than offering only bibliographical service, library staffs will also serve as informational brokers for patrons in need of guidance.\n\nIn your recently released collected poems, Precincts of the Passion-Dragon, many of the poems celebrate and illuminate the struggles of working class and immigrant families. How does your upbringing influence your poetic perspective?\n\n|My childhood has everything to do with my “poetic perspective,” as you call it. I grew up in a predominately working class Polish and Irish community in the Port Richmond neighborhood of Philadelphia, where there were few Asian or immigrant families to speak of in the mid-1950s. I became painfully aware at an early age that I was not welcome there as a mestizo child (half Filipino, half White) with such a strange surname and such odd looks. I grew up feeling both ugly and alien and apart from the people around me. Many of my poems begin in a place of shame and move to a place of redemption or at least a place where toxic shame isn’t paralyzing the narrator. My mission in poetry has always been to find a strategy by which all that is toxic in memory can be revisited and transformed via art into something positive, maybe even something of service to others.\n\nWhere can readers keep up with your writing? Buy your books?\n\nYou will encounter my work in literary journals, such as the Paterson Review or Chautauqua Review, or in the Moonstone Art anthologies, or at readings in Philly or local Jersey readings like the one I’ll be doing in September at the Whitman Stafford House in Laurel Springs (date & time TBA). I’ll also be reading at the Poetry Center in Paterson, NJ on April 5, 2025 as one of the finalists for the Paterson Poetry Prize for Precincts of the Passion-Dragon: Poems 2000-2020. Much more information about my activities can be found on the Stratford Public Library’s website: https:www.stratfordlibrarynj.org\n\nMy books can be found/ordered in local bookshops such as Barnes & Noble, on Amazon.com or kelsaybooks.com. But, remember that for those readers with limited resources, you may read all the poetry, fiction, and nonfiction for free by visiting your neighborhood library and checking out books or requesting interlibrary loans. All you need is a library card and the dazzling Kingdom of Literature is yours!\n\nNothing to give you\n\nthat you would want.\n\nNothing big enough\n\nbut freedom.\n\n-- “Tiny Journalist Blues” by Naomi Shihab Nye\n\nWhen I think of the month of July, I think of summer memories in Northeast Philly: BBQs, badminton, and block parties; vacation reading club at Bushrod library; tennis at Tarken playground, swimming at Max Myers; penny candy at Woolworths; weekends at my uncle’s bungalow near Tullytown; the annual shore trip to Rosalinda’s in North Wildwood.\n\nThe 4th of July was always about family and neighbors coming together and celebrating our country’s ideals, our hopes to be better, do better. The day culminated in fireworks where we watched them at the elementary school where you could see them over the treetops by the Jewish Cemetery.\n\nThese were yearly adventures and daily freedoms we innocent children could count on and often took for granted. As adults, in today’s world, we can no longer rest comfortably in our nostalgia, waxing romantic about the good old days.\n\nThis month, I am posting my print and poem “Refugees.” It’s a cento form in which lines are borrowed from other poems to construct something new. These lines were collected from “The Tiny Journalist” (2019) by Naomi Shihab Nye whose poems draw on her experiences as a Palestinian-American living in the Middle East, her father, and from the Facebook postings of teenager Janna Jihad Ayyad who shared her personal journey of living under conflict.\n\nShihab Nye is my favorite poet and I was so moved by this collection of truth telling. While I often flinched, these poems also softened my heart and helped me choose and arrange words that told the story of the impact on refugees; that created something from this witnessing -- a sense of urgency and expression for those whose voices are silenced or made to feel invisible. I chose lines with questions so that the reader might ponder their own lives in contrast with so many people who are still living in poverty and war, struggling to survive, let alone build childhood memories.\n\nWith the 250th anniversary of 1776 just two years away, I (like so many others) find myself worried and anxious about our freedom: who fought for it, for what reasons, who has it, who doesn’t. Last month, my poem “Coming to America” highlighted my own family immigration story and the challenges of leaving one’s country to find a better life. America represented freedom and opportunity for many immigrants and refugees.\n\nHow many personal and collective sacrifices were made over the years, and what must happen to ensure the preservation of our rights, over and over again? This poem seeks to highlight the crisis of individuals, families, nations still fighting for their freedoms, still looking for a free and safe haven.\n\nI can’t help but ask the same of us this July. Is America still that place?\n\nIt’s rare to find a work that inspires not only how to live (and write) more courageously, but also how to write (and live) more fully. It’s just as rare to stumble across a work that provokes spontaneous laughter in addition to serious and lengthy reflection. How to Do the Greased Wombat Slide is such a work. It accomplishes all of the above, as it inspires, intrigues, and delights.\n\nThe collection is a treasure chest of how-tos and answers to questions readers likely never knew they had. The work celebrates the wisdom often revealed through unexpected wordplay and the perennial power of penned imagination. It invites readers to engage with a collection of curious topics while inspiring engagement beyond the collection’s contents. Even clip art takes on several pages of creative forms.\n\nThe work’s language, vivid imagery, and revealed imagination are simultaneously unexpected and endearing. A how-to that extends and expands far beyond any single topic of instruction, the work’s three sections, How to Dance, How to Love, and How to Endure, include lessons on living and reminders of the fragility of life.\n\nThe work plucks inspiration from the mundane.\n\nExamples include:\n\nI was bored with my click-clack factory job\n\nstamping sunbursts on the heads of pins (“Ruthanne Replants Herself”)\n\nA bird in the hand is worth a can of spray-on pants (from “Words to the Unwise “)\n\nHow to tie a tie\n\nHow to make it in America\n\nHow to get a girl to like you (from “How to Waste Time Looking Things Up on the Internet”)\n\nIn its travels through common occupations and ways to occupy time, the collection makes magic through strands of whimsy and wonderment woven out of ordinary terminology.\n\nConsider, for example, The Spaghetti Squash Comes to Visit --\n\nWe hadn’t had time to study up on spaghetti squash behavior.\n\nWe assumed a vegetable visitor would be fairly sedimentary, but it\n\nkept hopping around like an electric flea.\n\nThe collection is equal parts surprising and contemplative, full of plays on words that leave readers to admire the eccentricity of the pen and embrace firm reminders of mortality.\n\nExamples include –\n\nWhen I die, I’ll carve Remember Me\n\non a tombstone made of vanishing breath. (from Autobiography Written in Disappearing Ink”)\n\nDon’t you trust me?\n\nWell, it’s no use. I don’t have to make bargains with you. (from “Love Letter to My Favorite Ghost”)\n\nMy grandfather’s ghost mows the lawn in tan pants.\n\nA corpse reads the classified ads (from “Snapshots from My Nightmares”)\n\nAs Miller plays with phrases and pairs strangers on suddenly synchronous stages, Miller not only dazzles with the unexpected, she encourages readers to reimagine. The work is as much a source of humor as it is a solid contemplation on mortality, morality, and the many ways of making meaning in a world that often defies sensemaking.\n\nThe work is also a celebration of poetry, with pieces like What Poetry Is, What I Mean When I Talk About Poetry, and How Love Poems Get Written , and a reminder that, eventually (perhaps ultimately), poetry and mortality intersect :\n\nOnce upon a time, you consumed this book;\n\noblivion spat it back out. When you died,\n\nsomeone rummaged through your ashes\n\nand found a piece of me, sparking like an ember (from On Learning That One of My Books Was Found Among a Dead Poet’s Possessions)\n\nWith themes that span the spectrum of life and loss, the collection conspires as it inspires, and ultimately unites. The work straddles serious topics with playful perusal. It’s as celebratory as it is cerebral. It creates and curates a carnival-like atmosphere of wordplay amidst the seriousness of thought and topic.\n\nNo matter one’s mood, the work will surely meet if not exceed expectations. Whether consumed in isolation, sequence, or a series of random formations, as a collection, the pieces provoke reflection as much as they inspire delight in the ordinary. Enjoy!\n\nWhat draws you to poetry? What are your poetic muses?\n\nPoetry, for me, is a natural extension of my love for music. During my teenage years, I found myself drawn to writing lyrics, although singing wasn't my forte. Nevertheless, I was captivated by the power of words and their ability to touch people’s lives. This fascination eventually led me to explore poetry. It's a quiet passion, yet it has the remarkable ability to speak volumes. Life often presents challenges that can tear us apart, but I believe that poetry possesses the unique ability to put people back together.\n\nMany of your poems include working class or counterculture type characters. What draws you to this archetype?\n\nThe inclusion of working-class or counterculture characters in many of my poems stems from my own upbringing and life experiences. My childhood was marked by adversity, with both of my parents facing challenges related to disability, addiction, and mental illness. Growing up in such an environment, I realized early on that my experiences were radically different from those of many others. Despite the hardships we faced, I found our life to be intriguing and rich with lessons.\n\nThrough my poetry, I aim to shed light on the resilience and complexity of individuals who often go unnoticed or are marginalized by society. I believe that everyone, regardless of their circumstances, possesses inherent worth and is capable of both good and bad. My poems serve as a reminder that a person's socioeconomic status or life struggles do not define their character or diminish their capacity for kindness.\n\nAdditionally, I utilize these characters and their narratives as cautionary tales, offering insights into the consequences of certain choices and behaviors. By sharing these perspectives, I hope to provide guidance and inspire reflection on the paths one chooses in life, ultimately striving to encourage others to pursue happiness and fulfillment through positive means.\n\nYou mentioned at a recent reading that Bruce Springsteen is one of your influences. Can you tell us a little bit more about how The Boss inspires you?\n\nBruce Springsteen's influence on my work stems from the raw, unfiltered honesty present in his lyrics. Much like Springsteen, I adopt a \"No BS\" approach to my poetry, believing that genuine connections can only be forged through authenticity and truthfulness. His ability to capture the essence of everyday struggles and triumphs resonates deeply with me, and I aspire to infuse my own writing with a similar sense of realism and sincerity.\n\nAs a fellow Catholic-raised Jersey boy, I feel a strong sense of kinship with The Boss. His portrayal of working-class life and the human experience strikes a chord with me, reflecting aspects of my own background and upbringing. Springsteen's music serves as a source of inspiration and validation, reminding me of the power of storytelling and the importance of staying true to one's roots.\n\nDo you have any particular writing habits? What moves you from all-possible blank page to finished piece?\n\nConsistency is key to my writing process, as I endeavor to write every day, even if it's just a few lines scribbled in a journal. I find that keeping a journal close at hand ensures that I'm ready to capture fleeting moments of inspiration whenever they arise. Additionally, the notes app on my phone serves as a convenient tool for jotting down ideas on the go.\n\nWhen I encounter writer's block or feel stuck in the creative process, I often seek solace in nature. As Emily Dickinson eloquently put it, \"Nature is what we know – yet have not the art to say.\" Nature has a way of inspiring reflection and introspection, providing the perfect backdrop for observation and contemplation. Whether it's the serene beauty of a forest or the rhythmic crashing of waves by the sea, immersing myself in nature allows me to reconnect with my innermost thoughts and find clarity in my writing. As a poet, I consider myself a professional observer, and nature offers me the tranquil space to observe both the world around me and the depths of my own soul.\n\nTell us a little bit about your current project!\n\nAs an MA in Writing student at Rowan, we must produce a book-length project by the time that we graduate. My project is a poetry collection titled Edge of the Ave, a gritty, lyrical poetic explosion about trying to achieve freedom within the heteronormative, white-picket confines of lower-middle-class small-town suburbia. This collection follows the life and death of the poetic persona Jawn Van Jacobs, an outlaw on the outskirts of suburbia who lives by the mantra of James Dean: live fast, die young, leave a good-looking corpse. Jawn, more assertive than his creator, says what others are afraid to say about the hard truths of growing up as a boy who likes other boys. While not for the faint of heart, this collection not only celebrates youthful and queer rebellion but also depicts the consequences of when it goes too far, thrusting readers unapologetically into the dark street corners of the Edge of the Ave.\n\nWhere can readers find more of your work? Keep up with your writing?\n\nReaders can discover more of my work on my Instagram page, where I share my poetry under the handle @jawnvanjacobs. Additionally, one of my poems titled \"the remembering tree\" was recently published in Issue 3 of Cool Beans Lit. Keep an eye on my Instagram for updates and new releases!\n\nAnyone who has seen local legend, Joe Roarty, perform at Fergie’s Pub or other venues around Philadelphia knows to expect poetry that is original, explosive, humorous, and, literally, percussive. For the uninitiated, Roarty performs his poems accompanied by a hand drum, which accentuates the incantatory, effect of his at turns celebratory, satiric, lyric, and rant-fueled poems. Roarty is like no other poet on the local scene, and I, for one, was excited to dive into his latest collection, Showtunes.\n\nOne poem that stood out to me is titled “aftr my father dies i go 2 applebees.” It may because, personal disclosure, I hate Applebees and have a negative dining experience of eating there after my grandmother’s funeral. Back to this funny and heartbreaking poem. He sums up the tastes of his deceased father with the propulsive lines:\n\napplebees is n th suburbs\n\n& my fathr was a man of th suburbs\n\nmainly\n\nhe liked 2 drink thr\n\nhe liked wine\n\n& he wasn’t particular\n\nso applebees was perfct\n\nEven while writing this suburban ode to his father, Roarty introduces (in true bohemian deadpan style) a sociopolitical comment: “i red where applebees treats thr mployees badly/so its not a place I normally go 2.” As he mourns his father, he comes to the realization that Applebees are around\n\nwhere nothing has 2 add up\n\n& u can sit n a booth\n\n& drink & cry if u want 2\n\nnobody minds if you pay yr bill\n\ntip th waitress\n\n& only hav a short drive home\n\nThe political resurfaces throughout Roarty’s work, and it does so poignantly in “america u drive a hard bargn.” He begins this assessment of modern America life with the breathlessly perfect lines:\n\namerica u drive a hard bargn\n\nu drive a fast car\n\neveryone pays 2 b who they r\n\n2 gt wher they want 2 go\n\nth only law is don’t go slow\n\nThis poem continues to discuss capitalism: “america u drive a hard bargn/th sales pitch/the bait & switch.” It even echoes Thelma and Louise, or at least to this cineaste’s mind, “i was driving a fast car but i wasn’t getting anywhere…i was yelling nto th grand canyon/my voice came bak like i was trying 2 sell myself something.” He ends this travelogue diatribe aptly comparing america (lowercase deliberate) to a “usd car lot.” Now, imagine this poem with percussion!\n\nOne of the poems in which I believe Roarty’s rhythmic and sonic effects mirror the intensity of his live performances most clearly is “watt yr gtting nto.”\n\nhit by a wave\n\ndrivn down\n\nsand rasping\n\nsalt stinging\n\nears crashing\n\nth tip\n\nof an uncontrollabl force\n\ncarelessly nokking u down\n\nIn the end the poem is about love and loss with the aching force of the stanza:\n\nu don’t wanna\n\nnd up\n\nlft on th shore\n\nwatching yr lovr sail away\n\nWe learn how Roarty first learned to love the drum that features so singularly during his readings in the poem, “wagon train:”\n\nsometimes i wd go ovr 2 ricky’s hous\n\nwe wd go down 2 th basement\n\nthat’s where his fathr’s drum kit was\n\n& if u touchd it it let out\n\nthis sound\n\nlike a pistl shot or a door cracking opn\n\nUnfortunately for Roarty’s childhood friend, Ricky, drum practice conflicted with the airing of Wagon Train. Ricky’s father was a drummer before he became a salesman, and there is the intimation Ricky may face the same fate when he grows up. As the adventures of Wagon Train fade in Ricky’s earnest attempts to become a drummer, he, like a fairy tale dragon or baddie in a Western, hoards the musical magic for himself:\n\nhe wanted 2 play th drums\n\nbut he cd only touch\n\nthose gleaming drums…\n\nso wn i\n\nntranced by thr harsh geometry\n\ntouched th snare\n\n& its acidic xplosiv tone\n\na pistl shot\n\nfilld th basement\n\nricky told me\n\nno\n\nAnd thus, an iconoclast was born!\n\nShowtunes is a marvelous collection encasing Roarty’s unique style. He channels the Beats without parodying them. When I read or hear his work, I am transported to the fifties/sixties as well as today. He is humorous, sly, political. He muses on the difficult, the strange, the overlooked. He brings to mind the Beat poets or the poète Maudite like Rimbaud or Villon. Buy Showtunes and surrender to its percussive insight and beauty!\n\nEnoch the Poet (James Church) is a talented poet, publisher, and trauma-informed educator whose approach to using visual art and poetry is only one of his many accomplishments. Speaking with him has expanded my understanding of what ekphrasis can accomplish. Not only does Enoch use multiple art forms himself, he collaborates with other creatives. Perhaps most significantly, he is providing a platform to inspire and share the work of other poets, artists and musicians.\n\nAs Founder and Executive Director of Black Mind Publishing, Enoch is a force for social change, giving “visibility to raw artistic works, both literary and visual, that center on the healing process of the Black mind, body and spirit.” (https://www.blackmindspublishing.com/) Several of their publications incorporate images and text through mangas, including Enoch’s own manga series, Immortal Dark. He has also authored two collections of poems, The Guide to Drowning (2017) and Burned At the Roots (2020).\n\nEnoch’s early focus was not poetry, but animation. As a young student he was a “comic book lover and nerd”, a visual artist who considered digital arts college. His middle school in Wilmington was violent, where students experienced much bullying and fighting. But Enoch’s poetry chapbook project in 8th grade honors English class provided a way for other students to open up to him. He shifted his trajectory into poetry, rapping and music, since these provided connectivity and community. After much experience performing spoken word, Enoch won the title of Philadelphia Fuze Grand Slam Champion in 2017 and he placed well in the Individual World Poetry Slam in Spokane, Washington.\n\nA Seizure Is What Happens When God Enters A Human Body\n\nby Enoch the Poet\n\nafter Osimiri Sprowal\n\nMy mother catches the spirit for\n\nthe second time this week. The first\n\ntime was in the upstairs hallway. This\n\ntime, God finds her in the bathroom,\n\nstretched out on a crucifix of pearl\n\nlinoleum, hands and feet shaking to\n\ntear herself away from the cross.\n\nGrandma used to say God spoke\n\nthrough thunder and I think I can\n\nhear him in the clapping of momma\n\nskull against the bathroom tile and oh\n\nhow God-like that is, to speak to my family\n\nin a language we can never understand\n\nbut always feel the pain of. Possession is\n\nnot only a demonic practice ‘cuz God has\n\nmade a new home in my momma. She\n\ncatches the spirit for the third time this week, this time, God finds her on the living room floor stretched out on a carpet the color of his sons blood, a red sea, hands and feet shaking to wade through the waters, to stroke herself to freedom. Grandma used to say God exist outside of space and time and I think he been tryna’ take my momma there. They say Jesus rose on the third day and I think on this third day of seizures I can see his resurrection in the space between momma bouncing limbs and the ground. Her mouth opens and angel wings burst from her throat. We anchor her body down and they fly away with her voice. On this third day, my mother rose with only part of herself. She goes to speak and vacancy spills over her lips. God plays abusive father in my household, bringer of blessings who is still able to shake the voice out of my momma at will and everyone around me will tell me\n\nnot to curse him because he means\n\nwell and everyone around me will\n\ntell me this is her doing and everyone\n\naround me will tell me to thank him\n\nthat she’s still alive when he brought\n\nthis sacred illness to her in the first\n\nplace. Grandma say you got to learn\n\nto see the blessings in everything. My\n\nmother regained consciousness without\n\na voice and I spent the next 2 hours of\n\nthe night teaching her how to speak again.\n\nWhen I think back on this night I picture my\n\nmother flying full speed after her angels.\n\nI imagine them playful and her desperate.\n\nI imagine a dogfight of spirits where my\n\nmomma pries the rest of herself out\n\nof their grip and reclaims herself and\n\nshe returns to herself and when I point\n\nto me and sound emerges from her mouth\n\nI imagine she created her own blessing.\n\nI imagine she is God now.\n\nhttps://www.rigorous-mag.com/v3i1/enoch-the-poet.html\n\nCurrently, Enoch devotes much time to creative projects that support social growth and change. I have seen him thrive as a teaching artist who advanced into the role of Program Director at Philadelphia’s Artwell, which supports youth and their communities through creative expression, poetry and other art forms (https://www.theartwell.org/). His experience and innovations bring much to our community.\n\nI use the word “palimpsest” figuratively. Its dictionary definition is: “A surface in which later writing has been superimposed on effaced earlier writing.” What I see are examples of writings that had influenced John Steinbeck; and what authors Steinbeck, in turn, has influenced. The novel Cannery Row (1945) offers many different genres, which makes this work very rich in literary possibilities.\n\nBEFORE STEINBECK\n\nLet us make up a little story which is typical in ancient Chinese literature: In Ninth Century China lived a poet Wang Chi. His poems were known throughout China, but he was difficult to locate. Between the limestone islets in the Li River of the south and the Great Wall of Beijing in the north he journeyed on his own time in any season. Thus, the people considered him a semi-mystical prophet and healer in addition to a writer of exquisite verse.\n\nBeing a broad reader, Steinbeck employs that motif: “The old man stopped and turned. Andy stopped. The deep-brown eyes looked at Andy and the thin corded lips moved. What happened then Andy was never able either to explain or to forget. For the eyes spread out until there was no Chinaman. And then it was one eye—one huge brown eye as big as a church door. Andy looked through the shiny transparent brown door and through it he saw a lonely countryside.” (23)\n\nBeing raised in the West, Steinbeck must have been influenced by Western authors. Josh Billings was not as famous as Mark Twain but an entire chapter was given to him: “More recently in Carmel there have been a great number of literary men about, but there is not the old flavor, the old dignity of the true belles-lettres. Once the town was greatly outraged over what the citizens considered a slight to an author. It had to do with the death of Josh Billings, the great humorist.” (71)\n\nWe cannot overlook the atmosphere of Twain’s famous “Jumping Frog of Calaveras County” when Steinbeck describes frog-hunting: “Every frog leaped, plopped into the pool, and swam frantically to the bottom. Then into the pool plunged the line of men, stamping, churning, moving in a crazy line up the pool, flinging their feet about. Hysterically the frogs displaced from their placid spots swam ahead of the crazy thrashing feet and the feet came on.” (93)\n\nIn addition, Steinbeck must have been influenced by the radio shows of the 1920s and 1930s, especially soap operas like ”Our Gal Sunday” or “Stella Dallas.” In Chapter 8 the Malloys are living in stressed circumstances:\n\n“Mrs. Malloy cried and cried and Sam held her in his arms and comforted her.\n\n‘Men just don’t understand how a woman feels,’ she sobbed. ’Men just never try to put themselves in a woman’s place.’\n\n“ And Sam lay beside her and rubbed her back for a long time before she went to sleep.” (49)\n\nThe Talbots (Chapter 24) were also in difficult straits, but the wife Mary has a very different attitude from Mrs. Malloy: “It was a kind of play she enjoyed very much—a kind of satiric game and it covered and concealed from Mary the fact that she didn’t have very nice clothes and the Talbots didn’t have any money. They were pretty near absolute bottom most of the time, and when they really scraped, Mary managed to give some kind of a party.” (152)\n\nAn element of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett also haunts some of Steinbeck’s writing. In the 1920’s detectives were on the move tracing evidence and picking up clues: “ Doc didn’t stop in Salinas for a hamburger. But he stopped in Gonzales, in King City and in Paso Robles. He had a hamburger and beer at Santa Maria—two in Santa Maria because it was a long pull from there to Santa Barbara.” (104)\n\nEd Ricketts (1897-1948) was a marine biologist whom Steinbeck met in 1931. The author admired Ed very much for his scientific knowledge as well as his fascinating personality and dedicated Cannery Row to him: “For Ed Ricketts, who knows why or should.” The two collaborated on a book, The Sea of Cortez, in 1941. Steinbeck patterned Doc, the major character of Cannery Row, after Ed. His lab had all sorts of sea creatures:\n\n“The lovely animals of the sea, the sponges, tunicates, anemones, the stars and buttle-stars, and sun stars, the bivalves, barnacles, the worms and shells, the fabulous and multiform little brothers, the loving moving flowers of the sea, nudi-branchs and tectibranchs, the spiked and nobbed and needly urchins, the crabs and demi-crabs, the little dragons, the snapping shrimps.” (25)\n\nJohn and Ed shared the love of these many living things. When Ed died prematurely in a car accident, Steinbeck was devastated.\n\nAFTER STEINBECK\n\nRay Bradbury (1920-2012) admired Steinbeck from afar, stating the older man’s influence on the younger’s fantasy writing. Among the loosely joined chapters, Steinbeck used many different genres; here is an example of the dark influence on Bradbury:\n\n“From his upper left vest pocket he took an old-fashioned straight-edged razor. He opened it and indicated the child with a gesture of his head. He put a hand among the curls and the baby laughed gleefully and then the man tilted the chin and cut the baby’s throat and the baby went right on laughing.” (137)\n\nAnother surreal scene is when Doc finds something while climbing over rocks along the shore:\n\n”A girl’s face looked up at him, a pretty, pale girl with dark hair. Her eyes were open and clear and the face was firm and the hair washed gently about her head. The body was out of sight, caught in the crevice. The lips were slightly parted and the teeth showed and on the face was only comfort and rest.” (109)\n\nJohn Steinbeck prefigured the Beat poets of the 1950’s too, although he never published a poetry collection. Here from the Introduction is a free verse description of Cannery Row in Monterey in California (I take the liberty of putting this sequence in poetic scansion):\n\nA poem\n\nstink\n\na grating sound\n\na quality of light\n\na tone\n\na habit\n\na nostalgia\n\na dream.\n\nSteinbeck was often self-referential. In Steinbeck’s later novel East of Eden (1952) the wayward mother becomes a prostitute. A major character in Cannery Row is also a prostitute but a very different type:\n\n“Dora who, madam and girl for fifty years, has through the exercise of special gifts of tact and honesty, charity and a certain realism, made herself respected by the intelligent, the learned, and the kind. And by the same token she is hated by the twisted and lascivious sisterhood of married spinsters whose husbands respect the home but don’t like it very much.” (16)\n\nThe author wrote a sequel to Cannery Row titled Sweet Thursday (1954), which featured many of the same characters. If that were not enough, he worked with Rodgers and Hammerstein on a musical comedy based on the latter book called Pipe Dreams (1955). This scene could easily be the backdrop for that stage play:\n\n“Early morning is a time of magic in Cannery Row. In the gray time after the light has come and before the sun has risen, the Row seems to hang suspended out of time in a silvery light. The street lights go out, and the weeds are a brilliant green. The corrugated iron of the canneries glows with the pearly lucence of platinum or old pewter.” (85)\n\nJohn Steinbeck’s final novel was The Winter of Our Discontent (1961) in which the major character runs a hardware store. It seems fitting to conclude this article with a Chinese reference since we began with one. Whereas the shopkeeper just mentioned is a Yankee in Boston, in Cannery Row Lee Chong is in sharp contrast:\n\n“It was small and crowded but within its single room a man could find everything he needed or wanted to live and to be happy—clothes, food, both fresh and canned, liquor, tobacco, fishing equipment, machinery, boats, cordage, caps, pork chops. You could buy at Lee Chong’s a pair of slippers, a silk kimono, a quarter pint of whiskey and a cigar. You could work out combinations to fit almost any mood.” (5)\n\nThe dice are loaded before I even finish reading this book. I like it; any negatives are so minor that I do not mention them. My special interest is in style. I am a poet; I am looking for poetic passages in the prose. It is a relative rarity that prose authors can carry it off without resorting to “purple prose.” That is why I praise in print the ones who can and do.\n\nIn West: A Translation, Paisley Rekdal shares an unforgettable collection of work, in poetic, visual, and essay forms. The hybrid text is the culmination of a project that first began in 2018 when Rekdal was commissioned to author a poem to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Transcontinental Railroad and one that will serve as a powerful teacher, and anchor of truth and history, long into the future.\n\nWest: A Translation revisits and reveals historical realities through personal stories, visual illustrations, photographs, and collections of documents that weave together, in complex and layered ways, the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad, the political and cultural realities of the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882 - 1943), and the harshness of American history. Pieces spotlight the voices, lived experiences, and violations of transcontinental railroad workers, Chinese immigrants, detainees, and other impacted parties in ways that reveal, perhaps as no other work has before, the tensions, hidden truths, and challenges that time can never heal and that are deeply embedded in the realities of a collective past.\n\nThe work translates, via a single Chinese character at a time, “Notes Toward an Untranslated Country”, an anonymous Chinese poem that had been carved into a wall of the Angel Island Immigration Station. The station served as the California detention center for Chinese immigrants to the United States. It was a site of deep heartbreak and harm, including extended detentions as well as suicides. For each character of the poem, Rekdal’s translation opens windows, accessible in ways never before, to a range of emotions, complex and layered, and experiences that extend far beyond any one voice or reality. The pieces humanize experiences in ways only poetry can and simultaneously span and expand upon a spectrum of human suffering as captured, conveyed, and retold throughout the collection.\n\nThe pieces are as detailed and expertly researched as they are sweeping commentaries that lift curtains, heavy in weight and time waiting, on long-concealed truths. Each poem works in, and of, multiple layers to spotlight, raise awareness, and crystallize collective experiences and loss as the voices featured in individual pieces travel alongside the railroad’s history. Individual poems, which vary in form and style, are accompanied by poignant and powerful images and detailed explanatory notes that inform and inspire, while also serving simultaneously as a critical reminder of, and educational tool for, histories that are often underexplored.\n\n噩耗 Sorrowful News\n\nSorrowful news sings the telegram\n\nand Lincoln’s body slides from DC\n\nto Springfield, his third son, Willie,\n\nboxed beside him….\n\n裹 Wrap\n\nDear Margaret: It is called Scarletteena the disorder\n\nis all in the throat.

I told him.\n\nI’m hoping to miss it entirely.\n\nThe work’s epigraph – “It is impossible to grieve in the first-person singular” (Cristina Rivera Garza) orients and situates the work as a testament to the human spirit and the collective nature of loss, labor, struggle, and suffering. Essays and extended notes detail the often hidden and haunting history and development of the railroad. Violations are described throughout, in connection with both translation (see, for example, p. 125) and humanity (see all), as well as the work itself (125).\n\nIn spaces where oppression meets resistance, suffering meets innate curiosity, and humanity confronts the harsh realities of history, West: A Translation transports as it informs and creates a visceral experience alongside an exquisitely painted landscape of poetic prowess. Sorrow is exquisitely captured in sweeping brush strokes that pair varied voices, blend literary styles, languages, and documents, and paint a masterpiece in hybrid form. The expertly researched and documented poems and essays are paired with an associated website where video poems extend the experience in immersive and multi-sensory ways. See: https://westtrain.org/\n\nThe collection highlights the extraordinary power of poetry to not only promote more intentional grounding in the present but also as a powerful teacher of the past. West: A Translation elevates and expands the hybrid form and takes readers on a journey across time and physical space, while also creating an anchor to which readers can regularly return for extended learning. Future readers, enjoy the journey that is West: A Translation and this remarkable collection of history.\n\nJonathan Koven’s Mystic Orchards is dreamy bildungsroman overflowing with luscious language celebrating family, memory, and love. This work is divided into five sections: 1. Spirit of Growth, 2. A Dark Horizon, 3. Sylvan Memory, 4. Deepest Blue, and 5. Awoken in a Field of Light. Through this review, I will explore a poem from each section, which is a challenge of sorts since all the poems in this collection are so gorgeously and meaningfully interwoven, it is hard to pick apart its illuminating, gossamer strands. But, dear reader, I will try.\n\nKoven’s adept use of language is evident from the first titled poem, “Stilled Wings,” in Spirit of Growth. It brings to mind a child’s first brush with disappointment, even morality with the evocative lines: “Past the farthest knoll I drag/ sacks of dead fireflies/ No longer do their strobes glow.” His language is so visceral, so visual that the reader can imaginatively walk the scenescape. After tossing the dead fireflies into a wishing well, he ends the poem with the haunting stanza: “In the cold black water/ moonlight envisions gardens/ their stilled wings will soar.”\n\n“Oftentimes the Still Sad Music” is my favorite poem from the A Dark Horizon section. In this poem there is faint, yet palpable, backdrop of political unease:\n\nThe bell tolls. Mad clown’s diatribe warps high\n\nover the trackless nation, across the soot\n\nsully, through gunpowder plume, home;\n\nwrapped in a hideous blanket of ineloquence.\n\nWhat intrigues me here is the sonic energy carried in this stanza: the plosive “p”s mixing with the sibilant “s” and the overall consonance throughout. This stanza is alive and creates an uneasy and powerful effect. The political context and intriguing soundscape continue in the following stanza:\n\nDefer to the turnstile regarding ennui\n\nto sadness more sublime; candles for teeth,\n\nsuburban cinemas over indigenous graves,\n\nlovers’ hands and not antennae mad for power,\n\nthieving tomorrows, one after the next.\n\nSylvan Memory contains the surreal, sexy poem “I Read a Name in the Sun.” The aforementioned soundscape mixes with some deliciously idiosyncratic images from Koven:\n\nthrough timeless gullies\n\nthose august glints ever dashing\n\nhigh with gnats loud on peaches\n\nsexing under crackling suppressed sky\n\nrelapses to summer psychedelia\n\nto spite the very choice\n\nin daily resurrection\n\nThis poem blurs by like a quick yet endless summer afternoon. When I read this poem, I imagine myself under dappling leaves dreaming about then eventually discovering love. Koven’s Edenic garden brings all sort of fond memories to mind. This section spoke to me the most—a tour de force.\n\nFull disclosure: I am a sucker for prose poems, so for the Deepest Blue section I would like to spotlight “Writing on the Wall.” This poem uses the paragraph to maintain its impressive momentum with lines such as “You believed, heaven is a fast/ car flooded in music, an exposed spine, dry heaving, a goodbye/ said tomorrow afternoon,” or “Love slipped over suburbia—arguments/ of bored siblings, first wanderlust, pale rooves juggling stars, bulbs/ chirring like rain,” and last example (it’s hard to pick only three) “Gazed at the ceiling washing ashore your canvas, listening/ carefully to tremors in arrested white, a heart’s thrum became/ voice’s muted falsetto.” This prose poem contains an epic writ on the speaker’s childhood bedroom wall—great stuff that formed this formidable poet.\n\nAnother full disclosure: I am a sucker for film, Hollywood, all that jazz. In “Man Is the Intelligence of His Soil” in the final Awoken in a Field of Light section, Koven makes a wry reference to it:\n\nEye threads coiling,\n\nloosened yarn balls,\n\nfiredrake fingers, breathing\n\nsweetness, laughing at dirt,\n\nmy slow tongue circles, to dowse\n\nin summer wash.\n\nCinematic.\n\nHollywood’s gray, after all.\n\nFor the Wallace Stevens fans among you, Koven acknowledges that this poem is titled after his poem “The Comedian as the Letter C.”\n\nSometimes, reviews just write themselves, and that certainly was the case with this review. I just took a backseat to Koven’s supple writing and enjoyed letting him drive me to his Mystic Orchards. This is the most cohesive and lush collection of poetry I have read in a long time. I would happily climb the tallest tree and proclaim to the world: “Get a copy of Mystic Orchards!” Have I sold you yet? I’ll answer my own question: Happy Reading!\n\nWhat draws you to poetry as an artistic medium over other art forms?\n\nI first became serious about writing poems when I worked long, unpredictable hours as a full-time physician. The writing was a way of processing complicated emotions. I didn’t copy William Carlos Williams’ capturing thoughts on a prescription pad, but I appreciated the short form of poetry because of time constraints. As I improved my craft through workshops and classes, I continued writing. Poems work the way my brain works, through compression of language and associative leaps that trust the reader to follow.\n\nYour debut chapbook, Rope Made of Bandages, entered the world last year through Finishing Line Press. Tell us about it!\n\nThis book includes poems that I wrote over ten years. The collection braids the themes of being a physician, being a patient, and bringing myself to retire from seeing patients, many of whom I had known for over twenty years. I wouldn’t have been able to get this book into the world without the help of my poetry critique group, the Leap Street poets, and the book is dedicated to them. They will be joining me in a reading to celebrate the one-year anniversary of my chapbook on March 27, 2024. https://noyesmuseum.org/all-noyes-events/2021/9/15/world-above-poetry-open-mic-9fmpd-39hcw-hle5n-wmfjk-kymsp-46n7c-wszl9-29k2y-5n8sc-nmykn-8p7e3-3cr7g-xtwe6-gdzdp-exwtm-835ml-ec7yw-wap5n-et44f-2lkt3-4r2c5-hc8np-9lchx\n\nHow do you get from an all-possible blank page to a near finished work? How would you describe your process?\n\nWhen I have unlimited time, my poems often begin as prose freewrites that I shape into poems. When I’m under time pressure to compose a poem, I prefer writing in poetic forms. I like having a container for the poem. And the form distracts my thinking brain. If there’s any genius in any of my poems, I attribute it all to my unconscious mind. I once wrote a sonnet about the rigors of being a physician that collided with a memory of a childhood ballet class.\n\nYou retired from the practice of Infectious Disease and Palliative Care. Do you find there are crossovers between the practice of medicine and the practice of poetry?\n\nYes, the crossovers between medicine and poetry are many. They both hinge on communication and relationships. I’m most struck by these crossovers when I’m at a poetry reading. There is a kind of open receptivity needed to listen to poems, just as there is a need to be receptive when listening to a patient. And when I’m reading, I am open to how listeners respond. Poetry and medicine are both two-way communications: doctor-patient and writer-reader/listener. I witnessed the crossover most sharply when I ran hospice weekly meetings. I began each meeting by reading a poem, a way of showing that our work there was not merely clinical.\n\nYou facilitate writing groups via Zoom utilizing the Amherst Writers & Artists (AWA) methodology and the Narrative Medicine workshop format. Can you tell us a little bit about these methodologies and formats as well as the writing groups themselves?\n\nI draw on my experiences as both a writer and physician when I facilitate writing groups. The AWA method is designed to create a safe and supportive environment. Participants generate writing to a prompt and then read it aloud to the group. The two methods dovetail nicely. Narrative Medicine puts more emphasis on group discussion of a piece of art before a short write, while the AWA method puts more emphasis on the writing. I find that combining the methods helps writers surprise themselves when they put words down on a page. Because the meetings are held on Zoom, writers from across the country and overseas meet in the same virtual room.\n\nWhere can readers read more of your work/buy your book?\n\nI post weekly on my Substack, Healers Write, Writers Heal: https://deborahbayer.substack.com\n\nRope Made of Bandages is available on the publisher’s website: https://www.finishinglinepress.com/product/rope-made-of-bandages-by-deborah-bayer/\n\nOr, signed copies are available on my website: https://www.harmonycommllc.com/shop/\n\nDear Readers,\n\nFor those of you who decide to spend time with Jessica Cuello’s Yours, Creature, you will not be disappointed. The collection is a remarkable demonstration of the power of the epistolary form as well as an equally remarkable tribute to the life and work of Mary Shelley.\n\nThe collection’s 97 pages present 48 poems in six sections, each in letter form, and span a lifetime. While many pieces share salutations (“Dear Mother” and “Dear Creature” regular openings), each poem is utterly unique and uniquely Cuello.\n\nThe collection masterfully demonstrates the timeless poetic power of letter writing as both a tool for documentation and for a deeper understanding of the complex and layered worlds in which the letter writer experienced life.\n\nYours, Creature – It’s surprising. It’s educational. It’s haunting.\n\nTogether, the pieces present Mary Shelley’s deeply layered complexity.\n\nFrom “Dear Mother, [I wanted to crawl]”:\n\nA line from the red radius of your womb\n\nwent dark. That night the whole of London\n\nraised its eyes to watch the comet pass –\n\nexcept for us.’\n\n(a letter from Mary Shelley speaking to the night of her birth)\n\nto “Dear Mother, [You wrote that]”\n\nA person has a right to tell\n\nAnd I could tell a tale by bight.\n\nI wrote beside the tossed grey water\n\nand where the dark red rags were soaked\n\nI told by yeast and flour,\n\nmade a man, made a monster,\n\nput it on the Chamonix\n\nThe work not only describes a life, it pulses with life.\n\nIt’s poignant. It’s impassioned. It’s charged.\n\nIt also charges readers to desire more - more storytelling, more poetry, and more expertly researched history.\n\nCuello’s attention to detail is unmatched. Relying on primary historical sources (including Charlotte Gordon’s dual biography, Romantic Outlaws, and letters written by Mary Shelley, as detailed in the collection’s Notes), the poems paint a life as complex as Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein. Tonally, the work is as haunting as it is educational. With each reading comes a deeper appreciation for Cuello’s exquisite writing and a deeper understanding of a life full of hardship, heartbreak, and horror. Mary Shelley would, undoubtedly, approve.\n\nNot only is the work tonally reminiscent of Shelley’s Frankenstein, it also fully embraces the gothic genre in poetic form, with villains and heroines, darkness and death, horror and harrowing losses. Written in the voice and persona of Mary Shelley, the work speaks to the mother Shelley lost ten days after childbirth (due to an infection that developed during Shelley’s birth).\n\nFrom birth – In “Dear Mother, [Father noted each event]”:\n\nYour afterbirth would not come out\n\nthe doctor pulled it away in pieces –\n\n,,,\n\nand to expel the placenta\n\npuppies suckled the milk\n\nyour body meant for me —\n\nTo girlhood – In “Dear Scottish time”:\n\nFather sent me away – or was it stepmother/?\n\nTo be sent is different from being left.\n\nTo be left is to remain in the walls\n\nthat repel you. Memory rooms\n\nhave no equilibrium. They never match\n\nand Mine so full of him. His turn, his back.\n\nTo love affairs – “Dear Mother, [I did not write]”:\n\nThe backward-looking need no enemies\n\nand every world is provincial once you’re in it.\n\nYour pregnant daughter,\n\nMary Shelley\n\nTo births – In “Dear Rejection 1815”:\n\nIn threes they came: the mother, the father,\n\nthe holy lover. One by one they cut me loose:\n\nthe first went underground without me.\n\namidst cycles of life, the work explores ongoing loss all while Shelley’s work on Frankenstein was born. For example, in ‘Dear Mother, [His wife was Harriet]’:\n\nThere is nothing in my arms\n\nanother nothing\n\nadded to the nothing first\n\nthe nothing second\n\nHow do you think of punishment?\n\nGirls make their own\n\nDid you guess your name\n\nwould get me love\n\nand blame?\n\nThemes revolve around love, loss, pregnancy, childbirth, and again, loss. It’s a harrowing collection that is as gripping as it is educational and as moving as it is memorable. The collection masterfully blends history and gorgeous text in a way that is both accessible and memorable. Its fabulous in ways that extend far beyond form, genre, and any single poem.\n\nThrough its haunting exploration of desire, loss, exile, and rejection, and the monstrous creations that can follow, the work simultaneously celebrates the marvelous power of the desire to create and the creative process.\n\nDear Readers, I hope you enjoy the collection as much as I did.\n\nYours in poetry, a Fan and Reader (of both Mary Shelley and Jessica Cuello)\n\nSince the 1960s (thank you Wikipedia), the phrase “the personal is political” has been oft-quoted in national discourse. Poets have certainly, and before the 1960s, incorporated that ethos into their work. Few poets today intertwine the two as economically, skillfully, and powerfully as Norm Mattox in his debut full-length collection, Four Crescents, from Collapse Press. Collapse Press, according to their website, “is a small literary publisher specializing in poetry and prose…whose work addresses the current social atmosphere of a society in turmoil and on the verge of transformation.”\n\nIt can be argued that the dawning of the current era, admittedly from an American perspective, began with 9/11. In Mattox’s taut poem “A Personal Dilemma,” he writes of a sadly all-too-common experience of being “one of most/‘randomly selected’ passengers/in the whole airport” for extra screening since according to a “sista from another mista” he “looked like an angry Black man/of dubious cultural background.” He tries desperately to comply with the new security state expectations:\n\ni made a conscious effort\n\nto avoid provocative\n\ncultural artifacts,\n\nlike necklaces, pendants\n\nhanging earrings,\n\nkufi hats, no berets.\n\nIn this listing of effectively banned accessories, Mattox employs metonymy to a staggering and heartbreaking effect.\n\nThe poem continues exploring how extra airport security is just a continuation of racism in American society:\n\nxenophobia continues to be\n\na tightly wound pitch\n\nthat americans\n\nfear any nonwhite member\n\nof the community\n\nnot being ‘true’ American\n\ndetermined by some\n\ndouble blind,\n\ndouble biased,\n\ndouble standard\n\nsurvey.\n\nThe short lines in this poem help to convey the anger and the tension of continuously being a suspect while going about your daily life. They exemplify the struggle to\n\nResist\n\nburning a bridge\n\nat both ends\n\nwhile the bridge\n\nis my back.\n\nMattox shows his strength as a poet and human being for suggesting ways of combatting the pernicious evil of racism in “A War on Racism”. In this poem, he deploys a provocative series of questions that sound as a clarion call:\n\nwould a leader dare\n\nto declare a war on racism?\n\nwhere are the volunteers?|\n\nwill there need to be a draft?\n\nHe enlists the Constitution into his argument as well.\n\nwho will be the patriots\n\nin the war against racism?\n\nare we the ones\n\nthey’ve been hoarding\n\ntheir ‘right to bear’ arms for?\n\nContinuing the journey into the post-911 landscape, he utilizes politically charged words including “insurgents,” “refugees,” “rebels,” and “terrorists.” He concludes not with a question, but rather an elegant statement:\n\nit will come down\n\nto a war on racism\n\nnot between,|\n\nBlack or white,\n\nbut between\n\nthe human race and\n\nan inhuman race.\n\nAs a gay writer, I know how easy it is to point out the cruelties and the injustices of America and modern life. It is more difficult to suggest a way to resist or exist in such a time and place. Fortunately for the reader, Maddox also comes up with answers to probing questions in “Ancestral Diatribe.” He acknowledges\n\nno one said it was simple\n\nto put your hand on the doorknob\n\nscroll through the masks you wear\n\nso you can return home alive\n\nHis astute observation continues in what is my favorite stanza of the collection:\n\nrevolution is not a spin through\n\nyour life cycle a stationary bike\n\ngoing the speed of breathing\n\nlast breaths\n\nThe answer to surviving, resisting, building a true and permanent revolution is, perhaps simple, but nevertheless true and the only answer, love.\n\nlove is a journey we take to find\n\nour authentic selves\n\na reflection an echo\n\nof a love that resounds\n\nat humanity’s core\n\nAs I write this review on Martin Luther King Day, Norm Mattox’s Four Crescents has done for me what all great art does—causes me to reflect, to transform in some way. Love to others, kindness to others, standing up to those in power who seek to destroy are ways we can build a better America. This book will break your heart, but then repair it. Mattox’s words and wisdom are a must to keep on your bookshelves. In other words, I won’t be loaning this book out, so please get your own copy. Supporting poets is a worthwhile act, and in 2024, it is more important than ever to support words that are honest and profound. I can think of no better poetry collection to purchase this year than Four Crescents.\n\nTell us a little about your writing process. How do you get from all possible blank page to finished work?\n\nOften the poem lives inside of me for a while before it lands on the page. Sometimes, if I have the seed of the poem but it feels too nebulous, I'll turn to poetic form as a method of containment. In my chapbook, for example, I have a blank verse sonnet about a particularly weighty topic. I have a range of interactions with my initial drafts--sometimes a poem feels mostly done right away, and I'll do some minor tinkering over time. Some drafts are awful but worth saving, and those I'll rework quite a bit. It helps to have feedback from a workshop or trusted advisor, of course.\n\nYour work dives into themes of motherhood, grief, and family history just to name a few. What draws your to certain subject matter? What are your muses?\n\nI was extremely close to my mother, so losing her at age 23 was a transformative experience for me. In the decade after her death, arranging the emotional chaos of loss into lines and stanzas was cathartic and also a way of remembering her, telling our story. I also write about my Jewish ancestry and my grandparents' escape from Warsaw to Shanghai during WWII. I am drawn to the past because of how it shows up in the present.\n\nWhy is poetry (or in general writing) the artistic medium for you?\n\nI have tried my hand at other things--I loved the stage for years, for example. But poetry has been a constant in my life. W.S. Merwin once said: “Poetry addresses individuals in their most intimate, private, frightened and elated moments … because it comes closer than any other art form to addressing what cannot be said.” Poetry, through sound, through image, has a unique magic. It gives shape to the disorder of human experience.\n\nIn addition to being a poet, you are a middle-school teacher. Does your work with students influence or find its way into your work?\n\nI occasionally write about the classroom! For example, in this poem about a 9th grade classroom in April. As an English teacher, I am in the business of words. Watching students interact with new texts or tap out the lines of iambic pentameter on their desks is a great joy. Since I teach middle school, I am also faced with students who are figuring out how to be people. Sometimes my experience as a poet is more helpful with that struggle than any other training I've received.\n\nTell us a little bit about your forthcoming collection Aiti from Finishing Line Press.\n\nÄiti is a chapbook about motherhood, childhood, loss, and renewal. I wrote these poems in the decade or so after losing my mother, and they take place in the present, in memory, and in the imagined past, in both Finland and Pennsylvania.\n\nWhere can we read more of your work, buy your book?\n\nÄiti is available in January 2024, and can be purchased through Finishing Line Press, as well as Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and other booksellers.
