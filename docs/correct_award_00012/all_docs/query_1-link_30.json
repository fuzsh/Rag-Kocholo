S Jonas Ferdinand Gabriel Lippmann (August 16, 1845- July 13, 1921) Most of these pictures, taken while traveling, were developed on the mantel piece of a hotel room, which proves that the method is easy enough to carry out. - Lippman\n\n2. Ethnic Background and History S Born to French parents in Hollerich, Luxembourg S His father was also a Physicist S Lived in Paris, France S He married a woman named Cherbuliez in 1888. S Author of two books, Cours de thermodynamique in 1886 and Cours d'acoustique et d'optique in 1888\n\n3. Education S 1873, he went on a scientific mission to Heidelberg, Germany S Received his doctorate in philisophy S 1875, he then went to the University of Paris S 1883, he became a professor of mathematical physics at Paris's Faculty of Sciences laboratory.\n\n4.
