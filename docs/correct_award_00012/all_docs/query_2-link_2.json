        "text": "Gabriel Lippmann (born Aug. 16, 1845, Hollerich, Luxembourg—died July 13, 1921, at sea, en route from Canada to France) was a French physicist who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1908 for producing the first colour photographic plate. He was known for the innovations that resulted from his search for a direct colour-sensitive medium in photography.\n\nThough born of French parents in Luxembourg, Lippmann grew up in Paris and was a bright but unruly student. Despite the fact that he never received his teacher’s certificate, he was appointed professor of mathematical physics at the Sorbonne in 1883. He later was appointed head of the Sorbonne’s Laboratories of Physical Research (1886).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhysics and Natural Law\n\nLippmann’s scientific talents were varied, but he was best known for his contributions in the fields of optics and electricity. He did early, important studies of piezoelectricity (precursors of Pierre Curie’s work) and of induction in resistanceless, or superconductive, circuits (precursors of Heike Kammerlingh-Onnes’ validations). He also invented the coleostat, an instrument that allowed for long-exposure photographs of the sky by compensating for the Earth’s motion during the exposure."
