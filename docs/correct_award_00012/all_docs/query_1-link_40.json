He is demonstrating that sound can be carried along a metal bar, using a violin to amplify the vibrations. Gabriel Lippman was a French classical physicist who gained fame for his work in optics and electricity. In 1908 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for producing the first colour photograph. The technique used was too complicated though to succeed commercially.

In this historical illustration, we witness Lippmann delivering an engaging lecture on sound propagation in solid bodies at the prestigious Sorbonne University. With his expertise in physics and dedication to teaching, he demonstrates how sound can be carried along a metal bar by utilizing a violin to amplify vibrations. Gabriel Lippmann's contributions to science were not limited to acoustics alone. His groundbreaking work in optics and electricity earned him great acclaim throughout his career. In fact, it was his pioneering efforts that led him to receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908 for producing the world's first color photograph. Although this technique proved too complex for commercial success at that time, its significance cannot be understated. As we delve into this mesmerizing artwork from Physique Populaire dating back to 1891, we are transported back in time to witness Lippmann's brilliance firsthand. The blackboard behind him serves as a canvas for his teachings while he captivates students with his profound knowledge and passion for scientific exploration. Gabriel Lippmann remains an icon within the scientific community even today. This image is a testament not only to his remarkable achievements but also to the enduring impact of dedicated scientists who strive tirelessly to push boundaries and expand our understanding of the physical world around us.\n\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
