Its inventor Gabriel Lippmann (1845-1921), a physicist and mathematician from Luxemburg and professor at the Sorbonne in Paris, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908 for his innovative heliochromatic process based on interference, which he first presented at the Acad√©mie des Sciences in Paris in 1891.\nShortly after its announcement, Lippmann‚Äôs invention spread beyond the country‚Äôs borders. Other photographers also experimented with his unpatented process. Between 1894 and 1900, competitions were organized by the ‚ÄòSoci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie‚Äô to ‚Äúpromote the dissemination of Lippmann‚Äôs method‚Äù alongside other methods. \n\nLot 501\nDr. Richard Neuhauss\nSelf portrait\n1901\nInterferential photograph (Lippmann process). 6.9 x 4.7 cm (8.5 x 6.3 x 1.9 cm)..
