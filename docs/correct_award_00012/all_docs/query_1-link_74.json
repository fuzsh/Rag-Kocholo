        "text": "Summery\n\nMarie Curie was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in France. The first female professor at the Sorbonne. The first woman to win the Nobel Prize. The first person to win more than one Nobel Prize (and to this day, the only woman to win more than once). And the first person to win a Nobel in more than one scientific field.\n\nAnd apart from that she and her husband ,two daughters and son in laws as a family, holds more Nobel Prizes than any other .\n\n1903 - Marie Curie shared her first Nobel with Pierre Curie.\n\n1911 - Marie then won an individual Nobel.\n\n1935 - Irene Shared her Nobel with her husband.\n\n1965 - Eve’s husband then received a Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of UNICEF.\n\nMarie Curie and Pierre Curie\n\nMaria Salomea Skłodowska later known as Marie Skłodowska Curie (7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934), was born in Warsaw, in Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work on physics and chemistry .\n\nMarie begun her scientific career in Paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various steels . At that time Pierre Curie entered her life.\n\nPierre Curie was an instructor at The City of Paris Industrial Physics and Chemistry Higher Educational Institution. They were introduced by the Polish physicist, Professor Józef Wierusz-Kowalski, while Marie was looking for a larger laboratory space for her experiments. Though Curie did not have a large laboratory, he was able to find some space for Marie where she was able to begin work.\n\nTheir mutual passion for science brought them increasingly closer. Eventually Pierre Curie proposed marriage, but at first Marie did not accept as she was still planning to go back to her native country.\n\nIn 1894, Marie returned to Warsaw, where she visited her family. She thought that she would be able to work in her chosen field in Poland, but she was denied by Kraków University because she was a woman.\n\nA letter from Pierre Curie convinced her to return to Paris to pursue a Ph.D. Pierre Curie had written up his research on magnetism and received his own doctorate in March 1895; he was also promoted to professor at the School.\n\nIn Pierre, Marie had found a new love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator on whom she could depend and on 26 July 1895 they got married.\n\nIn 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen discovered the existence of X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.\n\nThe Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed. The shed, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof but they were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances.\n\nIn 1897, her daughter Irène was born and to support her family, Curie began teaching .\n\nIn July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element they named \"polonium\", in honour of her native Poland.\n\nOn 26 December 1898, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named \"radium\", from the Latin word for \"ray\". In the course of their research, they also coined the word \"radioactivity\".\n\nTo prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form. Radium chloride was separated in 1902. She never succeeded in isolating polonium.\n\nBetween 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumor-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells. In June 1903, supervised by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris\n\nFirst Nobel Prize\n\nIn December 1903, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel the Nobel Prize in Physics, \"in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel.\"\n\nThe award money allowed the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant. Following the award of the Nobel Prize, University of Geneva, offered Pierre Curie a position, the University of Paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, anyway the Curies still did not have a proper laboratory.\n\nIn December 1904, Curie gave birth to their second daughter, Ève.\n\nOn 19 April 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident. Walking across the Rue Dauphine in heavy rain, he was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, causing his skull to fracture. Curie was devastated by her husband's death.\n\nOn 13 May 1906 the physics department of the University of Paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and offer it to Marie. She accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband Pierre. She was the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.\n\nIn 1910 Curie succeeded in isolating radium; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and Pierre: the curie.\n\nIn 1911, it was revealed that Curie was involved in an affair with physicist Paul Langevin, a former student of Pierre Curie's. This resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. Curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than Langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign Jewish home-wrecker.\n\n1911 Nobel Prize\n\nInternational recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, honoured her a second time, with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. This award was \"in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element.\"\n\nShe was the first person to win or share two Nobel Prizes, and remains alone with Linus Pauling as Nobel laureates in two fields each.\n\nA delegation of celebrated Polish men of learning, headed by novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz, encouraged her to return to Poland and continue her research in her native country.\n\nIn 1912, the Warsaw Scientific Society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute to be completed in August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie. She was appointed Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.\n\nCurie in a mobile X-ray vehicle 1915\n\nDuring World War I, Curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible. She saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons. After a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured X-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as petites Curies (\"Little Curies\"). She became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914. Assisted at first by a military doctor and her 17-year-old daughter Irène, Curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war. It is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units.Busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period.\n\nIn 1923 she wrote a biography of her late husband, titled Pierre Curie. In 1930 she was elected to the International Atomic Weights Committee, on which she served until her death\n\nDeath\n\nCurie visited Poland for the last time in early 1934. A few months later, on 4 July 1934, she died at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anaemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation.\n\nThe damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.\n\nBecause of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle. Even her cookbook is highly radioactive. Her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing.[\n\nHonors, tributes\n\n· Poland and France declared 2011 the Year of Marie Curie\n\n· The United Nations declared that this would be the International Year of Chemistry.\n\n· Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.\n\n· The first person to win two Nobel Prizes.\n\n· The only woman to win in two fields, and the only person to win in multiple sciences.\n\nAwards that she received include:\n\nNobel Prize in Physics (1903, with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel)\n\nDavy Medal (1903, with Pierre)\n\nMatteucci Medal (1904, with Pierre)\n\nActonian Prize (1907)\n\nElliott Cresson Medal (1909)\n\nNobel Prize in Chemistry (1911)\n\nFranklin Medal of the American Philosophical Society (1921)\n\nIn 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the Panthéon, Paris.\n\nThe curie (symbol Ci), a unit of radioactivity, is named in honour of her and Pierre Curie (although the commission which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the standard was named after Pierre, Marie or both of them).\n\nThe element with atomic number 96 was named curium.\n\nThree radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies: curite, sklodowskite, and cuprosklodowskite.\n\nNumerous locations around the world are named after her.\n\nIn 2007, a metro station in Paris was renamed to honour both of the Curies.\n\nPolish nuclear research reactor Maria is named after her.\n\nThe 7000 Curie asteroid is also named after her.\n\nSeveral institutions bear her name\n\nThe Maria Skłodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology, in Warsaw\n\nThe Institut Curie in Paris. She is the patron of Maria Curie-Skłodowska University, in Lublin, founded in 1944\n\nPierre and Marie Curie University (Paris VI), France's pre-eminent science university.\n\nIn Britain, Marie Curie Cancer Care was organized in 1948 to care for the terminally ill.\n\nElder daughter of Marie and pierre Curie , Irène Joliot-Curie\n\nIrène Joliot-Curie (12 September 1897 – 17 March 1956) was a French chemist, physicist, and a politician of Polish ancestry, the daughter of Marie Curie and Pierre Curie, and the wife of Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Jointly with her husband, Joliot-Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for their discovery of artificial radioactivity.\n\nThis made the Curies the family with the most Nobel laureates to date. She was also one of the first three women to be a member of a French government, becoming undersecretary for Scientific Research, under the Popular Front in 1936. Both children of the Joliot-Curies, Hélène and Pierre, are also esteemed scientists.\n\nShe died in Paris on 17 March 1956 from an acute leukemia linked to her exposure to polonium and X-rays, the same disease that had killed her mother.\n\nYounger daughter of Marie and pierre Curie , Ève Curie\n\nEducation B.A. in Science\n\nB.A. in Philosophy\n\nÈve Denise Curie Labouisse ( December 6, 1904 – October 22, 2007) was a French and American writer, journalist and pianist. Ève Curie was the younger daughter of Marie Curie and Pierre Curie. Her sister was Irène Joliot-Curie and her brother-in-law Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Ève was the only member of her family who did not choose a career as a scientist and did not win a Nobel Prize, although her husband, Henry Richardson Labouisse, Jr., did collect the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 on behalf of UNICEF.\n\nShe worked as a journalist and authored her mother's biography Madame Curie and a book of war reportage, Journey Among Warriors. From the 1960s she committed herself to work for UNICEF, providing help to children and mothers in developing countries.\n\nWork for UNICEF\n\nIn 1965, Ève's husband gave up his job in the U.S. government when the Secretary General of the United Nations U Thant offered him the position of the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF. Labouisse held this office until 1979, actively supported by his wife, who also worked for the organization and was often called \"the First Lady of UNICEF\". Together, they visited more than 100 countries, mostly in the Third World, which were beneficiaries of UNICEF's help. In 1965, Labouisse, accompanied by his wife, accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to his organization.\n\nShe sometimes joked that she brought shame on her family. \"There were five Nobel Prizes in my family,\" she joked, \"two for my mother, one for my father, one for [my] sister and brother-in-law and one for my husband. Only I was not successful ...\"."
