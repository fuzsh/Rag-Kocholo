The family moved to Paris and in 1858 he entered the Lycée Napoleon and ten years later École Normale. Lippmann studied also in Germany, with Helmholtz in Berlin and with Kirchoff in Heidelberg where he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1873. In Heidelberg he studied the relationship between electricity and capillary phenomena which led to the development of his capillary electrometer. In 1875 he moved to Paris and later became a professor of Mathematical Physics at the Sorbonne in 1883 and member of the Institute in 1886. At the Sorbonne he was teaching acoustics and optics. There he invented color photography and developed it during ten years. Lippmann became a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1883 and its president in 1912. He was a member of the Bureau des Longitudes and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in London. In 1908 Lippmann was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his color photography technique. Lippmann died at sea on July 13, 1921, on his return from a trip to North America.\n\n[Contributed by Prof. Hans Bjelkhagen]\n\nPreparing biographies\n\nFurther research\n\nPremium content for those who want to understand photography\n\nReferences are available for subscribers.There is so much more to explore when you subscribe.\n\nSubscriptions\n\nGabriel LippmannAutoportrait\n\nn.d.\n\nFamily history\n\nIf you are related to this photographer and interested in tracking down your extended family we can place a note here for you to help.
