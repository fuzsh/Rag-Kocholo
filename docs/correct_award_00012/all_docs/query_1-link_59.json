        "text": "Marie Curie - nee Sklodowska 1867 - 1934 - Famous Scientist\n\nPortrait of Marie Curie (1934).\n\nSource: Smithsonian Institution Archives\n\nPhotographer unknown\n\nNo known copyright restrictions\n\n(Source: Nuclear Museum)\n\nIntroduction\n\nMarie Curie nee Marya Salomee Sklodowska (pronounced: (sklaw DAWF skah) was born on November 7, 1867 in Warsaw, part of the Russian Empire (now Poland). She was the daughter of school teachers and dedicated to learning. Marya was the youngest of five children: Zofia (born 1862), JÃ³zef (1863), BronisÅawa (1865), Helena (1866).\n\nThe five Sklodowski children.\n\nFrom left to right: Zofia died of typhus;\n\nHelena became an educator;\n\nMarie, twice a Nobel laureate;\n\nand JÃ³zef and Bronya, physicians.\n\nâWe all had much facility for intellectual work,â said Marie.\n\n(photo ACJC)\n\nPoland was an occupied and divided country throughout much of Marie Curieâs life. (See the map... the orange part is part of Poland)\n\nWhen she was four years old one of her older sisters taught her the alphabet, and Marya learned how to read. In fact, she could read better than Bronislawa who had taught her.(Source: Marie Curie)\n\nMarya experienced many tragedies in her life including the death of her eldest sister, Zofia (who died of typhus at 14) and the death of\n\nher mother when she was only 11.\n\nWhen she graduated from high school she won a gold medal because she had been such a good student. Her father knew she had worked very hard, and as a reward, she was permitted to spend a whole year in the country with relatives. She enjoyed a marvelous year with her cousins.\n\nShe wanted to study when she returned to Warsaw, but there was no money to send her away to University. She and her sister did private tutoring to earn money. Marya told her sister she would work to send her to school, then when Bronislawa became a doctor, she could return the favour. That's what they did.\n\nMarie became a governess to a family in the country and also had an opportunity to teach several peasant children to read and write.\n\nHer sister invited her to come to Paris to live and begin her studies. Marya changed her name to a French name, Marie. (Source: Marie Curie)\n\nHer family were progressive and committed to the education of women - something that was rare in those times.\n\nEducation\n\n\"She received a general education in local schools and some scientific training from her father. She became involved in a students' revolutionary organization and found it prudent to leave Warsaw, then in the part of Poland dominated by Russia, for Cracow, which at that time was under Austrian rule. [Her cousin headed a school in Warsaw in which Marya had her first experience of a laboratory. She knew then what she wanted to study, physics and chemistry.]\n\nIn 1891, she went to Paris to continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she obtained Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences. [Marie Curie was the first woman to graduate with a degree in Physics at the Sorbonne (a famous French university) in 1893, and received a second degree from the Sorbonne in 1894 in Mathematics. She was the first woman in France to earn a Doctoral Degree.] She met Pierre Curie, Professor in the School of Physics in 1894 and in the following year they were married.\n\nShe succeeded her husband as Head of the Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne, gained her Doctor of Science degree in 1903, and following the tragic death of Pierre Curie in 1906, she took his place as Professor of General Physics in the Faculty of Sciences, the first time a woman had held this position. She was also appointed Director of the Curie Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, founded in 1914.\" (Source: Nobel Prize in Physics 1903)\n\nAlthough born in Poland, after coming to France to study Marie was also considered to be a French woman. She studied physics and discovered radioactivity and worked to expand our knowledge of radioactive materials. Her work resulted in the invention of the X-ray machine. She was the first person to ever win two Nobel prizes.\n\nOpportunities & Experiences\n\nWhen her mother died, her father thought that Marya should have a change of schools and this meant having good physics and Russian literature teachers. She then attended the \"floating\" university for young Polish women.\n\nWhen Marie went to Paris, she had the good fortune to study under Gabriel Lippmann, who would win the Nobel Prize for physics in 1908. Another professor, Henri Poincare, was widely known as the greatest mathematician of his time and Marie studied under him.\n\nMeeting Pierre Curie, another physicist who shared her vision. He became her husband and co-worker.\n\nMarie Sklodowska Curie and her husband Pierre Curie experimented together and discovered two radioactive elements, polonium and radium. The discovery of these elements laid the foundation for future discoveries in nuclear physics and chemistry. Marie and Pierre worked four years to acquire a very small quantity of radium in order to prove there really was such an element. In 1903, Pierre and Marie along with Henri Becquerel received the Nobel Prize in physics for their work and their discovery of radioactivity. In 1911 she received a second Nobel Prize, this time in chemistry, for her work in radioactivity. She was the first person ever to win two Nobel Prizes and the only person ever to win Prizes in two sciences.\n\nWorld War I - Service\n\nâI am resolved to put all my strength at the service of my adopted country, since I cannot do anything for my unfortunate native country just now...â--letter from Marie Curie to Paul Langevin, January 1, 1915\n\nWhen World War 1 broke out, she felt that X-rays would help locate shrapnel and bullets and facilitate surgery. As she thought that it was important not to move patients, she created X-ray vans!\n\nMarie devised advanced courses on radiology and taught doctors new techniques.\n\nThe heavy casualties suffered by the French in World War I prompted Marie to participate in the war effort by making public pleas for funds to equip ambulances with radiology equipment. The funding effort was successful, and Marie was elected by the Red Cross to be the official head of its Radiological Service.\n\nWith her daughter Irene, Marie devised advanced radiology courses and taught doctors & 150 nurses new techniques for locating foreign objects in the human body.\n\nThis âpetite Curie,â which brought X-rays to the Front in World War I, was displayed in Paris in 1998 during the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the discovery of radium\n\n.\n\nMarie Curie in her chemistry laboratory at the Radium Institute in France, April 1921.\n\nSource: Nationaal Archief of the Netherlands\n\nPhotographer unknown\n\nNo known copyright restrictions\n\nMarie and daughter IrÃ¨ne with X-ray equipment at a military hospital. After training IrÃ¨ne as a radiologist for a year, Curie deemed her daughter capable of directing a battle-front radiological installation on her own.\n\nAt the Radium Institute, Curie trained about 150 women in X-ray technology, including these radiology assistants with her near the front lines.\n\n(Source: Marie Curie & the Science of Radioactivity)\n\n2011\n\nMarie Curie - The year 2011 was declared the Year of Marie Curie by France and Poland.\n\nLinks\n\nMarie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity (detailed)\n\nor her story in brief (with interactive images)\n\nAmerican Institute of Physics\n\nNobel Prize: Marie Curie Biography\n\nNobel Prize: Marie Curie\n\nMarie Curie - Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1911\n\nMarie Curie\n\nMarie & Pierre Curie and the Discovery of Polonium and Radium\n\nNuclear Museum (PDF)\n\nMarie Curie - Wikipedia\n\nMarie Curie\n\nMaria Curie - Biography\n\nMarie Curie for Kids\n\nScience Kids - Marie Curie\n\nThe genius of Marie Curie - Shoshini Ghose.

Madame Curie died of leukemia (aplastic pernicious anemia), thought to have been brought on by exposure to the high levels of radiation involved in her research.
