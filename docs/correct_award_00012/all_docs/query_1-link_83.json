Photographic Dialogues between Past, Present and Future, the Musée de l’Elysée encourages contemporary artists to take a close look at photography as a medium, innovates as it reveals a 3D digitization technology developed by a spin-off from Lausanne’s Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), and displays its unique visual heritage.\n\nThe Memory of the Future. Photographic Dialogues between Past, Present and Future is the first exhibition that Director Tatyana Franck has curated at the Musée de l’Elysée. It opens up a dialogue between the work of the pioneers of photographic techniques (the past), those of contemporary artists that breathe new life into these skills (the present), and avant-garde technologies that update these early processes (the future). Works from the museum’s collections, contemporary artists and new technologies come face to face and join forces to give a brand new vision of the history of photography. The Memory of the Future aims to configure the present by reconfiguring the past in order to prefigure the future.\n\nTechniques over time\n\nFirst of all, early photographic processes such as ambrotypes, daguerreotypes, ferrotypes, cyanotypes, etc. are displayed next to works by contemporary artists who breathe life into them. The technical innovations of the past are fertile ground for contemporary art and design. The exhibition includes a waxed paper negative by Gustave Le Gray in dialogue with those by Martin Becka, while cyanotypes by Anna Atkins and Paul Vionnet converse with those by Christian Marclay, Nancy Wilson-Pajic and John Dugdale. Jean-Gabriel Eynard’s daguerreotypes from the museum’s collections are exhibited next to portraits by Takashi Arai and Patrick Bailly-Maître-Grand and landscapes by Binh Danh and Jerry Spagnoli. And as for contemporary ferrotypes, The Memory of the Future shows the work of Joni Sternbach and Jayne Hinds Bidaut as well as portraits taken by Victoria Will at the Sundance Independent Film Festival in 2014.\n\nWorks of two scientists who won a Nobel Prize and invented a photographic technique also have pride of place – a self portrait by Gabriel Lippmann (Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908) who invented color photography using the interferential method and a portrait of Dennis Gabor (Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971), the inventor of the holographic process, a photographic technique in relief – echoing a holographic picture by James Turrell, a contemporary artist primarily concerned with light. Lastly, and as a point of convergence for all these photographic processes to fix an image on to a support, the camera obscura is presented through the works of Florio Puenter, Dino Simonett and Vera Lutter. Loris Gréaud – an artist invited to present an original installation capturing the spirit of the Musée de l’Elysée by recording its shadows and light – also explores this technique.\n\nHomage and metamorphosis\n\nThe exhibition also presents the “mise en abyme” of iconic pictures from the history of photography reinterpreted by contemporary artists whose works examine the very notion of time or memory.\n\nThe earliest photograph in history – by Nicéphore Niépce and dating back to 1826 – is thus transformed by Joan Fontcuberta (Googlegramme Niépce, 2005) using PhotoMosaïque freeware connected online to the Google search engine, and by Andreas Müller-Pohle (Digital Scores VI). The first photographic self portrait in history – by Robert Cornelius in 1839 – is reproduced on a series of mirrors by Oscar Muñoz in 2009 to examine the paradox of the aging of the photographic support, which is, however, supposed to record an image for eternity. While Pierre Cordier pays homage to Eadweard Muybridge’s photographic breaking down of movement, Idris Khan (who took part in the reGeneration exhibition in 2005) pays homage to the iconic photographs of Bernd and Hilla Becher.\n\nInnovating to preserve and showcase\n\nHaving launched a campaign in 2014 to digitise its photography books – 1500 books have been scanned so far – the Musée de l’Elysée is continuing to explore techniques to dematerialise its visual heritage for conservation and promotion purposes. Launched in 2015 thanks to the Engagement Migros development fund, an ambitious three dimensional digitisation project puts the Musée de l’Elysée at the forefront of museum innovation.\n\nA venue for exhibitions, conservation and now an experimentation, as part of the exhibition La Mémoire du futur the Musée de l’Elysée is proposing for the first time a space dedicated to the presentation of digitised virtual objects from its collections. This innovative project aims to introduce new collaborative and interactive experiences using the Museum’s collections to a wide range of audiences – whether they be photography enthusiasts, curators or researchers.\n\nThanks to the Engagement Migros development fund, Innovation partner of the Musée de l’Elysée, the public is invited to experimentally test the first 3D digitisations carried out in partnership with the start-up Artmyn, created at EPFL’s Audiovisual Communications Laboratory (LCAV) led by Martin Vetterli. It will thus be possible to look at the works in 3D with unprecedented precision, but above all, to make the different textures of which they are composed appear on screen by lighting up the digital replicas from any angle.\n\nThis new technology comes in the form of a scanner made up of a dome on which are fixed several small lamps of precisely-adjusted intensity that switch on and off in turn depending on each picture scanned. “We are returning to an ancient theory of vision that imagined the eye’s projection towards the world, allowing the spectator once again to become an actor in the photographic experience,” explains Martin Vetterli in the exhibition catalogue.\n\nPreliminary work was carried out with the Collections Department to select the processes that would most benefit from this scanning technology – heliogravure, ambrotype, ferrotype, collage and carbon printing. The first results will be presented in the exhibition. A tactile device supplemented by a video tour of the work presents a collage by René Burri from the René Burri Foundation housed at the Musée de l’Elysée. Rendered in real time and very high resolution, the images that have been cut out and superimposed by the artist can be freely explored so that the visitor can appreciate the visual richness of the work. Visitor experience appraisal is an integral part of the project to optimise presentation techniques and create a digital experimentation area in the museum.\n\nThe active participation of visitors to the Museum is an essential step for this first test phase: the interactions and different perceptions of the benefits of the prototype presented will be taken into account for the purpose of developing teaching and learning tools that will subsequently be used to refine and expand the user’s experience and to develop a digital, educational discovery space within the exhibition areas.\n\nPress release from the Musée de l’Elysée\n\nPaul Vionnet (Swiss, 1830-1914)\n\nLausanne, le pont Chauderon en construction\n\n1904\n\nTirage au gélatino-bromure d’argent\n\n39.5 × 23.0cm\n\nCollection iconographique vaudoise\n\n© Musée de l’Elysée, Lausanne\n\nAnna Atkins (English, 1799-1871)\n\nAdiantum tenerum (Jamaica)\n\nc. 1852\n\n© Wilson Centre for Photography\n\nAnonymous\n\nPortrait of a young girl\n\n1860-1870\n\n© Musée de l’Elysée, Lausanne\n\nJohn Dugdale (American, b. 1960)\n\nThe Clandestine Mind\n\n1999\n\n© The John Dugdale Studio\n\nJohn Dugdale (American, b. 1960)\n\nMourning Tulips\n\n1999\n\n© The John Dugdale Studio\n\nJerry Spagnoli (American, b. 1956)\n\nGlass 10/9/12\n\n2012\n\n© Jerry Spagnoli\n\nVik Muniz (Brazilian, b. 1961)\n\nThe Steerage (After Alfred Stieglitz)\n\n2000\n\nfrom the Pictures of Chocolate series\n\nPierre Cordier (Belgian, b. 1933)\n\nPhoto-Chimigramme 17/6/76 I “Hommage à Muybridge 1972”\n\n1976\n\n© Pierre Cordier\n\nAndreas Muller-Pohle (German, b. 1951)\n\nDigital scores V (after Nicephore Niepce)\n\n2001\n\nInkjet print\n\n10 7/8 in x 11 in; mat: 16 1/8 in x 20 1/8 in; paper: 12 1/8 in x 12 1/8 in\n\nMartin Becka (Czech, b. 1956)\n\nLe Parc\n\n2002\n\n© Martin Becka\n\nBernd and Hilla Becher\n\nGas Tank: Essen-Karnap D\n\n1973\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nBernd And Hilla Becher\n\nGasbehälter bei Wuppertal (Gas tank near Wuppertal)\n\n1966\n\nGelatin silver print\n\nIdris Khan (British, b. 1978)\n\nEvery … Bernd and Hilla Becher Spherical Type Gasholder\n\nOne panel triptych, 2003\n\nLambda Digital C print mounted on aluminium\n\n20 1/2 x 26 1/2 inches\n\nIdris Khan (British, b. 1978)\n\nEvery … Bernd and Hilla Becher Prison Type Gasholder\n\n2004\n\nLambda Digital C print mounted on aluminium\n\n80 × 65 inches\n\nVictoria Will (American, b. 1980)\n\nKristen Stewart\n\n2014\n\n© Victoria Will\n\nKristen Stewart poses for a tintype (wet collodion) portrait at The Collective and Gibson Lounge, during the 2014 Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.
