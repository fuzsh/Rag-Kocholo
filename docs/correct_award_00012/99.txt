About 175th Birthday of Gabriel Lippmann

Jonas Ferdinand Gabriel Lippmann, born in Luxembourg on 16 August 1845 to French parents, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908 for the Lippmann process of colour photography Lippmann worked for 12 years developing his technique. After its presentation in Paris, however, it took another 17 years before he received the Nobel Prize for this unique work. Although the Lippmann method did not prevail, Gabriel Lippmann was undisputedly one of the most important physicists in his time.
