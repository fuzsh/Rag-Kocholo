Princess Maria Francesca of Savoy | Royal Italy| Prince Louis of Bourbon-Parma Wedding

Maria Francesca, principessa di Savoia, was born in Rome as the fifth and youngest child of the king and queen of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III and Elena of Montenegro.

She had three elder sisters, Yolanda Countess Calvi de Bergolo, Giovanna Tsaritsa of Bulgarian, Mafalda Princess of Hesse, and a brother, Umberto.

Princess Maria Francesca married Prince Luigi of Bourbon-Parma (5 December 1899 - 4 December 1967), a younger son of Robert I, Duke of Parma, and Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal.

Her husband was a brother of Zita, Empress of Austria, among many others.

Marie-Françoise's marriage marked the reconciliation between the former reigning family of Parma and the House of Savoy which had annexed the Duchy of Parma in 1859-1860 when the Kingdom of Italy was constituted in Savoy’s favour.

Mandelieu-la-Napoule is part of the district of Grasse and therefore does not belong to the former county of Nice over which the House of Savoy reigned until 1860.

Her children are:
