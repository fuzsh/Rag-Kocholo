        "text": "Marie Origin and Meaning\n\nThe name Marie is a girl's name of Hebrew, French origin meaning \"drop of the sea, bitter, or beloved\".\n\nThe ubiquitous French version of Mary came into the English-speaking world in the nineteenth century. In the United States, Marie was a huge hit at the turn of the last century and for the ensuing fifty years, becoming the seventh most popular name in the country for three years, from 1901 to 1904.\n\nNow, though, Marie sounds more dated than either Mary or Maria, though it once rivaled both. Even its days as a widely-used middle name have passed. The freshest way to use Marie today may be as the first part of a traditional French double name: Marie-Christine, Marie-Claude, and so on, or the French diminutive Manon.\n\nThere have been countless notable Maries over the years, from French Queen Marie Antoinette to physicist Marie Curie to singer Marie Osmond (born Olive Marie).\n\nMarie is the French form of Maria, which ultimately was derived from the Hebrew name Maryam/Mariam. The original meaning of Maryam is uncertain, but theories include \"drop of the sea\" (from Hebrew roots mar \"drop\" and yam \"sea\"); \"bitter\" (from Hebrew marah \"bitterness\"); and \"beloved\" (from the Egyptian root mr)."
