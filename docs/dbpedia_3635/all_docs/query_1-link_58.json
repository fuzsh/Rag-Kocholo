She was the daughter of Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen and Princess Isabella of Croÿ. The couple had nine children:\n\nPrincess Maria Elisabetta (1904) – unmarried\n\nPrince Carlo Luigi (1905) – died in childhood\n\nPrincess Maria Francesca (1906) – unmarried\n\nPrince Roberto Hugo, Duke of Parma (1909) – unmarried\n\nPrincess Maria Antonia (1911) – married Prince Gottffried of Thurn und Taxis, had issue\n\nPrince Francesco Alfonso (1913) – unmarried\n\nPrincess Giovanna Isabella (1916) – unmarried\n\nPrincess Alicia Maria (1917) – married Infante Alfonso of Spain, Duke of Calabria, had issue\n\nPrincess Maria Cristina (1925) – unmarried\n\nWhen Elia’s father Roberto I died in 1907, the headship of the family passed to Elia’s eldest living brother, Enrico. However, Enrico, and several of his siblings, were mentally disabled. Within just a few months, the Austrian court declared that Enrico and several of his siblings were legally incompetent. Elia served as regent for two of his elder brothers – Elia and Giuseppe, before legitimately becoming head of the house in 1950.\n\nA dispute emerged between Elia and his younger half-brothers over their father’s estate. An agreement was reached in 1910, in which Elia received half of the estate while the rest would be divided among the others. Elia’s half included the famed Château de Chambord in France, later confiscated during World War I as enemy property. Several years later, Elia’s half-brothers sued him to gain a larger share of their father’s estate, claiming their 1910 agreement violated French law. The French court initially ruled in their favor, but it was overturned in 1928. Four years later, the appeal was upheld because the brothers entered into a valid agreement willingly in 1910, thus superseding the French law of equal division. This decision also recognized Elia’s claim to Chambord. While the chateau was not returned to him, he was compensated with a payment of 11 million francs.\n\nPrince Elia died on June 27, 1959 in Friedberg, Austria, and is buried nearby in Mönichkirchen. He was succeeded by his second son, Robert Hugo.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nDuchy of Parma Resources at Unofficial Royalty\n\nDuchy of Parma Index\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
