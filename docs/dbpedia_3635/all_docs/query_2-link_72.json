        "text": "Her title in the UK wouldn't change, she'd still be HRH The Princess x. For example, Princess Anne was Her Royal Highness The Princess Anne, Mrs Mark Phillips while she was married to him so our imaginary princess would be HRH The Princess Julie, Mrs Joe Biden. If she's the oldest daughter of the Monarch she is entitled to be called the Princess Royal so she may be HRH The Princess Julie, The Princess Royal, Mrs Joe Biden.\n\nIn America she'd no doubt just be called whatever they officially call the First Lady for her official duties and the news networks and public can obviously call her whatever they want so they may choose to call her Princess Julie rather than Mrs Biden but I assume the US has no official protocol of their own for Royal names given they don't have Royals.\n\nTheir children would be entitled to titles (although Princess Anne specifically asked that her children didn't get them) - so the children would be HRH Prince or Princess whatever. They may be entitled to be Prince(ss) x of y with y being related to their mother's territorial titles (for example, Prince William is Duke of Cambridge so his son George is HRH Prince George of Cambridge).\n\nThe issues about marrying Catholics were removed in the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 (although anyone who has ever been Catholic is still barred from being Monarch) so that wouldn't be an issue. The first six people on the line of succession need the Monarch's permission to marry so that may be a problem but unless you're the Heir Apparent or the spare it's probably not as much of an issue as it once was (since there's not much chance of both the heir and the spare dying now like there once was in ye olde days).\n\nBy the time anyone's old enough to be running for President the Princess is probably going to be at least into their forties or fifties (although the Presidents seem to be getting older so she could well be in her sixties or even seventies unless you have another Melania situation) meaning the children would probably be adult by the time the hypothetical husband actually got into the White House.\n\nSo far as I'm aware there's no reason for the Princess or her children to lose their titles because of marriage to a foreigner, so long as the marriage doesn't go against the Monarch's wishes,\n\n(Obviously, this is all from the UK Royal Family, the Swedes, Dutch, Spanish etc will all have their own rules for marriage and succession).\n\nThere was talk about Diana and JFK Jr.\n\nDiana wasn't a Royal Princess, she was a Princess by title as wife of the Prince of Wales, not a Princess by rank as Princess Anne/Eugenie/Charlotte etc are\n\nTheir children would be entitled to titles (although Princess Anne specifically asked that her children didn't get them) - so the children would be HRH Prince or Princess whatever. They may be entitled to be Prince(ss) x of y with y being related to their mother's territorial titles (for example, Prince William is Duke of Cambridge so his son George is HRH Prince George of Cambridge).\n\nAgain, not strictly to. Zara and Peter were not entitled to the styling of Prince and Princess as their descent is via a female line. The Queen offered to create their father as an Earl (much like the Earl of Snowdon) in order that the children would have had a place in the peerage, but Anne and Group Captain Phillips rejected the offer.\n\nGeorge VI specifically had to issue letters patent to grant Charles and Anne the style of Prince and Princess, as they were grandchildren of the monarch through a female line, otherwise until their mother became Queen, they would have been styled as the Earl of Merioneth and Lady Anne Mountbqtten.\n\nThought this would be a fun crazy hypothetical lol\n\nwhat would happen to their kids (would they get a title?) and what would her title be? how would the world react?\n\nI suppose by Royal princess you mean a princess in her own right like Princess Anne or Princess Beatrice as opposed to the ex-wife of a prince, like Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nIf we use Britain as an example, it would likely make no difference unless the Princess in question requested her title be removed - there is the case of Patricia of Connaught where she was \"permitted by Royal Warrant to relinquish the style of Royal Highness and the title of Princess of Great Britain and Ireland[1] She was granted by Royal Warrant of 25 February 1919 the style of Lady Victoria Patricia Helena Elizabeth Ramsay, with special precedence immediately before the Marchionesses of England.[1] Since the Royal Warrant stated that her change in style took effect only upon the solemnization of her marriage, she entered the church as a Princess and Royal Highness and left as a Lady, a daughter of a royal duke.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Patricia_of_Connaught).\n\nBritish Princesses cannot pass on titles to their children. Even Princess Elizabeth, the current Queen Elizabeth II was unable to do so and when she was expecting Prince Charles a Letters Patent was needed to ensure that her future son would be born with a royal title, as opposed to just Earl of Merioneth, the title he was entitled to as son of the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nThe case of an ex-spouse like Diana, Princess of Wales is entirely different. Had she remarried she would have reverted back to her own title Lady Diana X (whatever her husband's name was). She had no entitlement to the title of Princess and she carried it as courtesy only.\n\nI anticipate from an American perspective however the situation would be more complicated. I am no expert but I anticipate any Presidential candidate whose wife is not an American citizen would get absolutely railed for being un-patriotic. As part of the citizen process, my understanding is that foreign honours and titles have to be given up. I don't know how common this is in practice but I imagine it would be a weak spot for any Presidential candidate if his wife was holding onto something something foreign and what would be portayed by his opponents as \"anti-American\".\n\nClosest i can think is Princess Margaret who had some sort of relationship with John Turner, who went on to become Prime Minister of Canada\n\nOn May 19, 1959, at a party hosted by his stepfather, as Lieutenant Governor, to celebrate the opening of the new British Columbia Government House, Turner danced with Princess Margaret, one year his junior. This was the first time that Turner received significant press attention in Canada; there was considerable speculation about whether the two would become a serious couple. According to letters by Margaret obtained by the Daily Mail, the relationship was more serious than previously thought with the princess writing in one letter, seven years later, that she \"nearly married him\". According to contemporary press reports, the relationship caused serious consternation at Buckingham Palace as Turner was a Roman Catholic, and Margaret would have had to forfeit her place in the line of succession to the British throne to marry him.\n\nBrenda confirmed a \"very definite attraction\" between her brother and the princess, but said that Turner was uninterested in royalty and would not have given up Catholicism. After meeting Margaret again during her Canadian tour, Turner attended her party at Balmoral Castle in August 1959 where his roommate was Margaret's future husband Antony Armstrong-Jones, and was the only Canadian unofficial guest at their wedding in May 1960. Turner remained friends with Margaret, he and his wife often meeting the princess in Britain or during official visits to Canada. They attended Margaret's 2002 private funeral and were Canada's official representatives at the memorial service.\n\nI suppose by Royal princess you mean a princess in her own right like Princess Anne or Princess Beatrice as opposed to the ex-wife of a prince, like Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nIf we use Britain as an example, it would likely make no difference unless the Princess in question requested her title be removed - there is the case of Patricia of Connaught where she was \"permitted by Royal Warrant to relinquish the style of Royal Highness and the title of Princess of Great Britain and Ireland[1] She was granted by Royal Warrant of 25 February 1919 the style of Lady Victoria Patricia Helena Elizabeth Ramsay, with special precedence immediately before the Marchionesses of England.[1] Since the Royal Warrant stated that her change in style took effect only upon the solemnization of her marriage, she entered the church as a Princess and Royal Highness and left as a Lady, a daughter of a royal duke.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Patricia_of_Connaught).\n\nBritish Princesses cannot pass on titles to their children.

I don't know how common this is in practice but I imagine it would be a weak spot for any Presidential candidate if his wife was holding onto something something foreign and what would be portayed by his opponents as \"anti-American\".\n\nBut if the wife was Diana...\n\nAt the risk of going into Chat territory, what if the genders where reversed (a Prince, and the Prince's American wife becomes POTUS)?\n\nIn pretty much every European scenario I can think of a woman who marries a prince of a reigning dynasty automatically obtains a royal title by virtue of that marriage. This isn't the case in any European monarchy when the situation goes the other way, where the husbands of princesses tend to be made princes only when their wives are heir apparent/presumptive.\n\nThe issue therefore is not the spouse but the female President herself having a foreign royal title.\n\nYour scenario therefore is a woman with a foreign royal title being elected President of United States. While it is likely to attract some interest in the tabloids, I think it seems that would be the antithesis of the republican foundations of the United States and is likely to be the cause of considerable criticism by her opponents.\n\nWhat if she was already a citizen and has the title?.\n\nThe short answer is yes. The Constitutional prohibition in Article I Section 9 Eighth Clause provides \"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\" So a private citizen who does not hold any government office can hold a noble title. In 1810 Congress submitted to the states a Constitutional Amendment \" If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive or retain, any title of nobility or honour, or shall, without the consent of Congress, accept and retain any present, pension, office or emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king, prince or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United States, and shall be incapable of holding any office of trust or profit under them, or either of them.\" Twelve states approved the amendment and four rejected it; so it was one vote short of ratification. The Congressional submission did not limit the time for ratification so it is theoretically possible it could still be approved but I don't see 26 states passing it."
