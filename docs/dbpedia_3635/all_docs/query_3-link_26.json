The eldest child of King Umberto II of Italy and Princess Marie Jose of Belgium, she grew up in Italy until the fall of the Monarchy in 1946, following which she joined her mother and siblings in Switzerland while the King went to Portugal. In 1955, Princess Maria Pia married Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia, the son of Prince Paul of Yugoslavia and Princess Olga of Greece. The couple had four children, two sets of twins, before their divorce in 1967. In 2003, Princess Maria Pia married Prince Michel of Bourbon-Parma, son of Prince René of Bourbon-Parma and Princess Margaret of Denmark, who is the biological father of her two younger children, remaining married until his death last year. Princess Maria Pia resides in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris, and in Palm Beach, Florida.
