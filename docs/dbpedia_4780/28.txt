Singer Duffy revealed in a poignant Instagram post the reason for her singing hiatus: She was “rapped, drugged and held captive.”

In the post, Duffy said she revealed her story to a journalist over the summer and plans to speak more candidly about her experience in a spoken interview set to be released soon.

“The recovery took time,” Duffy said in the post. “There’s no light way to say it. But I can tell you in the last decade, the thousands and thousands of days I committed to wanting to feel the sunshine in my heart again, the sun does now shine.”
