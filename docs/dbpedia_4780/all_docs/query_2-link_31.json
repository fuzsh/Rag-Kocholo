        "text": "With this poem I probably can’t do it justice here, as it is such a popular poem and has been written about a lot already and I’m sure that it is an exceptionally well known poem that I’m sure almost every English teacher has taught at some point. I’ve taught this one many, many times myself and every time I find something new or interesting to say about it and I love the realism in it. Duffy doesn’t beat around the bush with romantic notions of Valentines; instead she is harsh, brutal and realistic with her depiction of love.\n\nHow do I approach this?\n\nI’ve taught this poem in a variety of ways through the years, but at the moment this is how I’m approaching this one. First, I display a rose and an onion on a slide and ask the class to compare the pictures and explain what each suggests or implies. Then, I will get the class to feedback.\n\nNext, I’ll introduce the idea of ‘Valentine’ and get students to mind map the connotations of this, while I circulate and have a look at the responses. Rather than getting feedback I will call out a couple of good interpretations and ask students to predict what the poem will be about.\n\nThen, we’ll read the poem as a class and discuss whether the poem meets our expectations or whether it gives us a different idea or image from the original idea.\n\nNext, I’ll introduce the idea that the poem is using the onion as an extended metaphor and get students to think about what this means or why she does this. Students will be able to discuss this in pairs and make a note in their books and annotate the form into their anthologies, so that when they come back to the poem they have written that the whole poem is an extended metaphor. Once again I’ll take feedback on this prompt and then ask students to support their answers with quotes. I will use questioning to tease out and develop students understanding of how the poem is an extended metaphor and what this might signify.\n\nNext, in pairs I will ask students to annotate using the prompt questions that follow:\n\nWhat is the poem about?\n\nHow is the presentation of love explored?\n\nWhat is Duffy saying and why?\n\nIdentify and explain the metaphors used in the poem.\n\nHow does the language chosen by the poet reflect the message of the poem?\n\nSelect 5 words to explore closely (connotations & word class analysis)\n\nLook closely at the structure – what does the fragmentation suggest about love and the journey love takes?\n\nWhat does the tone of the poem reveal about the poet’s attitude?\n\nAs they are doing this I will circulate and help students and ensure that they are making annotations in their anthology relating to the questions and that they are on the right tracks with their analysis. Sometimes, I will stop the class and clarify a point or explain something if there appears to be a common misconception. Once the students have finished answering the questions and are happy that they have annotated their poems in detail I will take feedback as a class, so that all can start to add to their own thoughts in more detail. Also, I will ask students to write down any more thoughts or questions they have relating to the poem on a post it note, so that I can reflect on these and respond.\n\nThe Context\n\nDuffy was poet laureate\n\nShe is a professor at Manchester Met University\n\nShe has one child\n\nDuffy is bisexual and had a long relationship with Jackie Kay (another poet)\n\nDuffy is an outspoken feminist believing in equality\n\nHer poems give a voice to ordinary figures – although this is at times controversial\n\nDuffy is from Glasgow but moved to Stafford as a child\n\nOften the characters in her poems are troubled\n\nI will ask the students to make a note of the context and then ask them to apply this to the poem. As I recognise that this is difficult I will show the example below on the board to try to model how to embed the context linked to an example. Again, with Duffy she is incredibly interesting, but I find it hard to filter what is the most important context to teach for this poem, so any advice would be received with gratitude.\n\nApply this context to the poem: Example here\n\nE.g. The persona in Valentine appears troubled by traditional depictions of love “Not a red rose…” this may reflect Duffy’s ability to create complex characters in her poems and give voice to ordinary people. Traditional depictions of ‘Valentines’ suggest that flowers and chocolates should be forthcoming on the 14th February each year, however Duffy rejects this stereotypical notion and instead recognises the complexity of love. Perhaps, she recognises that this type of is not realistic and real people have issues and emotions that go beneath the surface of just giving and receiving flowers.\n\nHere is a link to the PowerPoint it this is of use: Valentine\n\nThe Essay: (here is a link to this if useful – OTT Essay on Valentine\n\nThis is an example essay which goes over Valentine in an over the top way, but which may be useful for future reference. Also, I’m not claiming to have got it all right, just that some of this may be useful.\n\nThe title Valentine indicates a poem about love and relationships; however the cosy depiction of love being about hearts, flowers and roses is immediately rejected by Duffy. “Not a red rose or a satin heart.” Is the first line of the poem with the stereotypical gifts immediately standing out as being worthless and an untruthful reflection of love. The single line stanza reinforces the feeling that this isn’t what love is about or what love should be about. Duffy is implying love is more complex than some cheap gifts.\n\nThe extended metaphor for love starts in the second stanza with “I give you an onion.” which interestingly is a useful present, one with a multitude of layers and which is much more practical and useful than a rose or a heart. It is very matter of fact and stated in the first person, as if there is no question that an onion is an appropriate gift. The persona continues to metaphorically describe the onion as a “moon wrapped in brown paper” which depicts the skin covering the onion, but creates a sense of romance with the idea of the moon looking down and keeping you safe. Duffy continues to show that this gift has layers in the same way that love does “promises light like the careful undressing of love.” suggesting that as each layer of the onion is peeled back, love grows and deepens and takes on a life of its own. The simile also has a playful quality as if the undressing is also a physical undressing too.\n\nThe third stanza starts bluntly “Here.” creates a feeling of the onion being thrust at the persona’s lover, as if in recognition of pain that love can cause, as well as the pleasure. This idea is reinforced with the simile “blind you with tears like a lover.” Implying it will make you physically cry as a result of something that has upset you. Tears that “blind you” are strong and show that power that the person you love can have over you in the same way that the strength of fumes from an onion can cause your eyes to water excessively. Another metaphor is used “reflection a wobbling photo of grief.” Inferring that the tears will cause you to look at the person you love but be unable to see them properly or for them to be able to see you. Or, perhaps it reflects the way that a face will crumple when it is over emotional and becomes difficult to look at. This depiction indicates that love isn’t all fun and playfulness, it is raw and emotional. Duffy may have written this poem in a realistic way as she knows what it is like to have a relationship that is full of emotion. She was living with Jackie Kay when she had her only daughter Ella and this must have been a difficult situation for her, Jackie and Peter Benson; the father of her child.\n\nHowever, the next two stanzas, both of which are one lines each, shows a realism “I am trying to be truthful.” Indicating that these emotions are honest, unlike the earlier stereotypical “red rose” here the integrity of the persona and the strength of emotion comes through. Again, realism is reflected in the rejection of stereotypical valentine related items “Not a cute card or a kissogram.”. The sixth stanza uses repetition of “I give you an onion.” Perhaps to reinforce the reality of the gift and to show that this is not a jovial present, but a well thought out extended metaphor for the trials and tribulations of love as shown throughout the poem. The oxymoron of “fierce kiss” could be a double meaning for the scent of the onion clinging to the lips as you eat it or the strength of a kiss that has been given to the persona by their lover. Again Duffy contrasts emotions “possessive and faithful” to show that love has many facets and isn’t one thing or another. “Possessive” has negative connotations linking to someone being clingy and not allowing the other to be their own person, whereas “faithful” creates positive imagery implying that there is trust within the relationship. However, putting these together creates a strange push and pull feel within the relationship, as if the positive and negative elements are fighting for dominance.\n\nIn the final stanza the idea of possessiveness and belonging is reinforced with the imperative “Take it.” which is both commanding and demanding. Then, the metaphor of “platinum loops will shrink to a wedding ring.” Suggests that the persona may be accepting that marriage and relationships are about compromise and that the bad and the good will inevitably run alongside each other. The image of the loop of the onion being like a wedding ring is interesting as it suggests that relationships take work and being married isn’t the end of the work. An almost violent climax to the poem is created with the repetition of “cling” which again is possessive and reinforces the idea that relationships are not a stereotype and that they are hard work. The scent of the onion will “cling to your fingers and cling to your knife.” the end-stopping reinforcing the ending of the poem and the fact that the onion, now sliced has continued throughout the poem to be an extended metaphor linked to the harsh reality of love. Duffy doesn’t imply that with love is a wholly positive experience in the poem. She reflects on love as difficult, changeable, worthwhile, but ultimately a difficult experience that takes work from more than one person in a relationship. Her own experiences in relationships may have meant that making Valentine a stereotypical presentation of love would have been difficult. Her own experience in a relationship with a woman, at a time when this wasn’t wholly accepted may have influenced this realistic approach to love and relationships.\n\nAs always, if there is anything that you notice which is wrong or needs adapting do let me know. There are as always other interpretations and ideas that could be covered for this poem, but hopefully this is useful. I am always open to feedback."
