        "text": "Duffy is lovely\n\nobviously you cant really say that about Amy\n\nvoice wise i still would go with Duffy although both have a few so-so songs but some quality ones\n\nDuffy has a 2 fellas i heard. 1 in america and 1 in the uk. dirty mynx lol\n\n0\n\nDuffy all the way\n\nI never liked Amy and her songs were all a bit bleh (apart from Back to Black - that song was pretty good). I always felt she was overpraised for an album which realistically was nothing special and only contained a couple of decent tracks. Plus she's gone and pissed all over her success like the ungrateful bitch she is.\n\nDuffy on the other hand has a completely different personality and is much more likeable. Rockferry is a really good album and contains one of my favourite tracks of 2008 - Distant Dreamer, I love it.\n\n0\n\nI agree with the above post, dislike Duffy, she looks shifty to me and I dislike her songs except for Warwick Avenue.\n\nWith Winehouse we KNOW she is shifty and she has nothing left to hide. Her songs are vastly superior as is her voice.\n\nWinehouse all the way for me.\n\n0\n\nI agree with the above post, dislike Duffy, she looks shifty to me and I dislike her songs except for Warwick Avenue.\n\nWith Winehouse we KNOW she is shifty and she has nothing left to hide. Her songs are vastly superior as is her voice.\n\nWinehouse all the way for me.\n\nlol now that you say it there is something strange about duffy. perhaps it's the fact she looks twice her age.\n\nwino's back to black is one of the best albums ever created - a true masterpiece!\n\n0\n\nI have both albums, both albums are excellent and completely different and so are the artists. But as human beings go and based on personality, charisma, live performance and looks, I prefer Duffy 100%.\n\n0\n\nI think they both have talent.\n\nAmy W has better and more interesting vocals (on a good day) , but Duffy is no slouch in that department either,and she , unlike Amy, is consistently good.\n\nI think they are different but overall equally good.\n\n0\n\nI use a simple test for these kind of situation: if both are inactive for a year who's music will I still remember?\n\nI think Amy wins with her unique style and I feel Duffy gained her popularity only because she came out when Amy was out the music scene for some time.\n\n0\n\nAmy Winehouse when at her absolute best.\n\nDuffy has done a couple of very good pop songs and is a very good singer, but when Amy is at her best she's in another league.\n\nProblem is that right now Amy seems to be getting by by just living off notoriety.\n\nIf you think about it she hasn't really released anything new for nearly two years now.\n\nShe's just ever presently there, but not for her music.\n\n0\n\nI definately prefer Amy's music - and vocals when she's on form. What annoys me is that she may never use her talent to make another album the way she is going:mad: It's wasted on her:(\n\ni find Duffy a bit twee, although Mercy is a catchy song and Warwick Avenue very pleasant listening. She's been way overplayed on radio now though - time she took a break:)\n\n0"
