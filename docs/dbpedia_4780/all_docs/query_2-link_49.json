        "text": "The genre of dramatic monologue has afforded poets the ability not only to create personas separate from their own identity but to form characters that recast history. There are a plethora of stories, myths, and tales of men who have accomplished great and foolish things, but perhaps none as notorious as Odysseus. Infamous, the legend of a man who battled mythical monsters, journeyed to the Underworld, and enjoyed the company of goddesses, but what about the women in his life, the ones who suffered because of his wiles?\n\nThat is what Carol Ann Duffy, feminist poet, is trying to accomplish in “Circe” which appears in her collection of dramatic monologues entitled The World’s Wife. Duffy recreates these world renowned tales and twists them to offer a woman’s standpoint, almost to the point of parodying feminist ideologies. In reference to The World’s Wife from A History of the Twentieth-Century British Women’s Poetry, “Duffy’s sisterly intervention enables a variety of female personae to cast doubt on the stories which mythologize and potentially ‘immobilise’ them” (235). With works like “Circe,” Duffy’s feminist perspective gives a voice to the women who have otherwise gone unheard or are fictionalized representations of those same stories but from a female point of view. “Circe” is one of several of Duffy’s mythology-based monologues, and the purpose is to construct a reconsidered idea of literary figures. Contemporary revisionist dramatic monologues, like those Duffy constructs, capitalizes on the borrowing of characters from history, literature, and/or mythology to challenge traditional and cultural morals and mores. Revisionary monologues, according to Glennis Byron, are used most frequently by women; Byron claims, “Since the late 1970s, many woman have exploited the form of the monologue to give voices to those who were silenced or to subvert patriarchal representations of women” (Dramatic Monologue 135).\n\nDuffy, known for her ability to feminize characteristically male-centered, well-known tales, uses mythology to give her monologues and readers a fresh perspective from a previously unheard point of view, a woman’s. However, in contrast to the critically feminist reputation of her monologues, Duffy’s use of mythology, meant to refocus well-known tales from centering on men to emphasizing women, but “Circe” does not subvert patriarchy but rather reinforces the ideals that have plagued women since the original conception of the myth.\n\nThe epic surrounding Odysseus’s decade-long journey includes his love affair with Circe, the witch-goddess who turns men into swine. In the original context, Circe is depicted as a strong, cunning character, so for Duffy to reinterpret Circe from a modern, feminist point of view is interesting and a choice that seems to be unnecessary considering Circe is a passionate, malicious figure. Unlike some of Duffy’s other works in The World’s Wife, the “Circe” dramatic monologue is entitled after her own name rather than the identity of the men in her life because she is alone. In this monologue, however, there is a forced sense of independence, an overcompensation of sensuality, and exaggerated sexuality that becomes a pathetic attempt to prove a woman can be sexual like a man. Authors Jane Dowson and Alice Entwistle, in describing feminist intervention of mythology, claim, “These characters [Circe] offer Duffy the chance to reiterate the dangerous nature of female desire, challenging a literary history which, if it concedes the existence of such a force, pays it no attention” (236). From the beginning of the monologue there is a distinct and ominous tone that prefaces the sensuality throughout the work, so Circe’s desire becomes a perilous, literal hunger.\n\nCirce, the cunning witch-goddess, of Homer’s Odyssey does not have a steady male in her life to be attributed with any other than her own name, not to mention she’s a woman of divinity, immortal. As a literary convention, Circe lives up to her role as the dangerous woman, a strong female who sings and lures men into her world of magic and mayhem; why is it, then, that Duffy decides to pull Circe from her mythological tale and attempt to showcase Circe’s ability to live without Odysseus or any man at all? Circe’s very role in the Odyssey is a soap-box for feminism; she ensnares men and toys with their humanity. Circe literally turns men into swine, pigs, hogs — a literary representation of which men are often associated. However, Duffy’s representation of Circe destroys her original strength as a single, content woman who destroys men’s lives simply because she has the power to do so. Duffy’s version of the Circe character portrays a bitter, seemingly hag-like woman who has clearly been heartbroken (by a man). Losing some of her strength from the original epic, Circe has become the stereotypical, male representation of an aging, lonely woman who has grown bitter with age and lack of male company. The power of Duffy’s imagery and sharp articulation of verbs expresses something angry, vengeful in her monologue. Obviously, Circe has reason to be upset with Odysseus; however, from a feminist perspective, why should a woman allow a man to dictate her feelings? From the beginning of the monologue, Circe is speaking to mythical creatures, nymphs and nereids (specifically water nymphs), and from mythology, these female creatures arouse passion in men but are incapable of feeling it themselves. These deities, in essence, represent the original “tease.” This idea seems to contradict Duffy’s purposes of overcoming masculine-appointed stereotypes by playing into the very idea of them. Circe, a woman notorious for attracting men to their hoggish demise, is confiding in creatures that embody the female’s role in the disillusionment that women’s bodies are for male enjoyment only, thus holding the nymphs accountable for perpetuating the sexual mindset that women are for men, sex is for men, and swine is all that is left for Circe.\n\nDuffy’s mastery of enjambment and internal rhyme creates a stark contrast between the sensual tone and Circe’s dark, ominous meaning. From a historical reference, readers are most likely aware that Circe, referring to the swine:\n\n“Of the tusker, the snout, the boar and the swine. / One way or another, all pigs have been mine” (2-3) are actually men; a point that is further developed when Circe explains, “… and how each pig’s face / was uniquely itself.” (16-7)\n\nwhich, horrifically, allows the reader to understand that these are individual people. The disturbing imagery of Circe preparing to cook the pigs (men) highlights the sense that there might be a bitter undertone to Circe’s words and actions. Is she preparing to cook cheeks and tongues because she is a strong woman asserting her dominance over men or because she is vengeful, angry at an entire gender? Seemingly, the latter is true because she is already in control of the destinies of these men; they are animals, turned into pigs by her doing, and if she so desired, she could return them to their normal human selves, but she chooses not to free them but rather eat them. It seems to become clearer that Circe is acting out as a woman betrayed by a lover, a man no better than a pig than subverting gender roles. Duffy creates a two-faced character by allowing Circe’s words to have a possible double meaning. For example, Circe says to the nymphs, “But I want to begin with a recipe from abroad. / which uses the cheek — and the tongue in cheek / at that” (10-2). The colloquial phrase “tongue- in-cheek” is most often used to indicate that what one is saying should not be taken seriously or is being used ironically; however, a less modern description is to indicate contempt. Either way, contempt or irony, Circe’s words are being used to mask deeper, more painful issues.\n\nCirce was Odyssey’s lover before he abandoned her to return to his wife, and the remnants of sexuality are sizzling within the monologue. From the very beginning, there is a distinctly sensory-driven atmosphere, and it is almost as if the reader could actually smell, taste, feel all the descriptions being utilized; it becomes an intimate bridge that is almost uncomfortable. Circe begins with saying, “Under my thumb … / In my nostrils … their yobby, porky colognes” (4-5). A femininity of Circe’s descriptions are combative with the cannibalistic subject-matter. Circe continues employing the use of sensations when she says:\n\nI’m familiar with hogs and runts, their percussion of oinks\n\nAt dusk, at the creaky gate of the sty,\n\nTasting the sweaty, spicy air, the moon\n\nLike a lemon popped in the mouth of the sky. (6-9)\n\nThis sensual-based language prefaces the continuation of sensualities which transform into sexualities and become more and more violent. The witch-goddess begins her recantation of body parts with the tongue, and as Dowson and Entwistle argue, “‘Circe’ (‘which uses the cheek — and the tongue in cheek / at that’) … takes gluttonous interest in the connection between sexual climax and death” (236). There is something unnerving about Circe’s hunger for the pigs because of the underlying sexual language and tension; however, it is as though Duffy creates this uncomfortable imagery to discourage an acceptance of Circe’s explicit desires and actions. By combining a sexual hunger with her literal desire to cook these pigs, Duffy creates an overcompensated sexuality which, for feminist intentions, works against itself by seeming intended simply to shock and awe, not to serve a higher purpose. Next, Circe says to the nymphs, “Remember the skills of the tongue / to lick, to lap, to loosen, lubricate, to lie” (14-5). Though she is referring to the pigs’ tongues, the inventory of alliterative verbs are highly sexual, and the last one listed, “to lie,” hints at a resentment hanging in Circe’s memory, something she has yet to accept and overcome. In effect, Circe is allowing a man, whether specifically Odysseus or not, to hold control over her. The sexual overtones and emotional undertones create an unstable female character, a stereotype that woman have often been pigeonholed within literature and mythology. Based on male representations, women are prone to jealousy and erratic behavior, but Carol Ann Duffy, a woman, feminist, lesbian, and the author of this dramatic monologue, portrays Circe similarly to that of what a male writer might; Duffy’s “Circe” does more harm to feminism than any male author ever could write, and even if this work is a parody of “self-congratulatory essentialism” (278), as Vicki Bertram claims in her essay, “Postfeminist Poetry?”, patriarchal ideas are further perpetuated rather than subverted. By sexualizing Circe’s language and including cannibalistic subject-matter, Duffy has weakened a female character that was originally portrayed as a strong, independent woman.\n\nDuffy’s representation of Circe is not only damaging Circe’s reputation as a man-eater, she is destroying any semblance of feminism Circe maintained. Carol Ann Duffy further articulates Circe’s angry bitterness when she says, “but all of them / nymphs, with those piggy eyes. Season with mace” (19-20). Violent imagery, yet again, seems to confirm a betrayed sense of feeling. Mace, though an ingredient that is similar to nutmeg, has another, more negative connotation — a modern brand of tear gas typically used by women to delay pursuers. Duffy is infamous for using anachronisms in her works to modernize her monologues, especially in works where it will be overtly conspicuous. By giving Circe a new voice separate from the confines of the Odyssey, Duffy is revising traditional representations of the witch-goddess, so supplying Circe with a weapon of mace would modernize the work to the point of challenging Circe’s original position; however, Circe was originally depicted as a powerful woman capable of protecting herself whether through magic or manipulation. Giving Circe mace is to weaken her position, to lower her to the standard of an ordinary woman. As someone dependant on poison, Circe becomes another stereotypical affirmation of female weakness and male dominance.\n\nMythology’s presence in “Circe” does not subvert patriarchal ideals, but instead continues to highlight the typical irrational behavior often attributed with women. Throughout the monologue, Circe refers to body parts of the pigs as if she is listing them in order to devour each one singularly and resolutely. Beginning with the tongue and the cheek, Circe moves on to another sensory oriented body part, “those piggy eyes” (20), then she begins describing the way in which the ears should be prepared, “Well-cleaned … blanched, singed, tossed / in a pot, boiled kept hot, scraped, served, garnished / with thyme” (21-22). Another violent cataloging of preparation begins to desensitize the reader to the witch-goddess’s anger, but it does not diminish the comparison of pig traits to masculine tendencies. For example, Circe continues on about the ears saying, “Look at that simmering lug, at that ear, did it listen, ever, to you, to your prayers and rhymes, / to the chimes of your voices, singing and clear?” (23-5). Speaking to the deities, Circe questions the motives of the “simmering lug” asking whether it had ever listened to the creatures. Because the nymphs were created to stir passions within men without reciprocation, the mythical creatures will never be admired for anything other than their natural born gifts, so Circe becomes no longer content to vent her feelings but is sinking to the level of men by not waiting for a response to her question from the nymphs; Circe is satisfied to rhetorically complain to the other women, fellow immortal beings, in her presence without actually caring herself about their “prayers and rhymes / to the chimes of … voices, singing and clear” (24-5). She moves on without delay, demands the nymphs to “open the beer” (26), and continues to catalogue body parts, “Now to the brains, / to the trotters, shoulders, chops, to the sweetmeats slipped / from the slit, bulging, vulnerable bag of the balls” (27-9). Taking time to separate “brains” and “vulnerable bag of the balls” from the list of “the trotters, shoulders, chops,” Circe highlights the distance and disparity between the “brains” and “balls”, with the former being something that is often used sparingly and the latter not used sparingly enough. Appropriate, the adjectives “bulging” and “vulnerable” indicate an overwhelming weakness of these pigs’ genitals; however, Circe indicating her awareness of the fragility of the “bag of the balls” does not undermine or emasculate the men/pigs but showcases her feminine vindictiveness. Circe, the witch-goddess, is steadily becoming less goddess-like, another patriarchal idea that represents the fall of woman and the perpetuation of the ideal that women are either godly (sexual, deceitful depictions of the Eve character) or Godly (a representation of the Madonna figure). Circe ends her rant with an internal organ, the heart, and she says to her nymphs, “When the heart of a pig has hardened, / dice it small. / Dice it small” (29-30). The repetition of “dice it small” is an intense image. Circe gives the sense that she is getting angrier when reminiscing about the hardened hearts of the men who have come in and out of her life. The second time she says the phrase, “Dice it small,” a harsher pronunciation of each word is automatic, as if to enflame the hatred Circe is feeling; it seems as though this dicing of the hearts is Circe’s retribution to those that have broken her heart. She is not simply a woman, she is a divine creature, but she has become the petty stereotype of the man-less woman, a bitter Dickensian Miss Havisham.\n\n“Circe” changes paces quickly and mid-line; transforming from the cannibalistic, vengeful treatise in the beginning of the monologue to a scene of quiet nostalgia. Circe’s musings are piteous when she recounts:\n\n“I, too, once knelt on this shining shore\n\nwatching the tall ships sail from the burning sun\n\nlike myths; slipped off my dress to wade,\n\nbreast-deep, in the sea, waving and calling;\n\nas three black ships sighed in the shallow waves.\n\nOf course, I was younger then. And hoping for men.” (30-5)\n\nWhen Circe says, “I, too, once knelt on this shining shore” (30), “too” indicates that the nymphs are or have been luring men from the ships, so it becomes clear that Circe is relishing in her past glories. As a woman who used to “wade breast-deep” (33) into the ocean and attract (at least) three ships to their demise, Circe has apparently lost her touch. Her words have a similar tone of men who have outlasted their youth and yearn to relive those triumphs, so it is appropriate that this section of the monologue is written in past tense which is different from the previous 29 lines. It is as though the witch-goddess is withering, as though Duffy’s monologue has actually emasculated Circe. Duffy has stripped Circe of the strength that Homer afforded her in his epic, the Odyssey; therefore, in an attempt to empower Circe, Duffy has betrayed this female character and not only fails at affirming a feminist tone but magnifies patriarchal ideologies. The last two lines of the monologue are opposing ideas, or so it seems at first glance. Circe tells her nymphs, “Of course, I was younger then. And hoping for men. Now, / let us baste that sizzling pig on the spit once again” (35-6). The first of these two lines continues with the nostalgic tone that Circe evokes in the previous five lines. Because Circe is a witch and a goddess, it seems strange for Circe to claim she “was younger then.” Of course, gods and goddesses do not age, but Circe would have passed time without growing older, so the “younger then” phrase most likely references a sense of gained experience and maturity; however, this line ends in with one word, “Now” (35). If Circe is no longer waiting for men to arrive on her island, then why say, “Of course, I was younger then. And waiting for men. Now”? The use of that last word indicates that Circe is still waiting for men despite what she is trying to tell herself. Because the last line, “Let us baste that sizzling pig on the spit once again,” (36) ends with “again” which rhymes with “men,” the second-to-last word from the previous line, exaggerates the point that Circe is still waiting for men. Circe, done with reminiscing, demands the nymphs, “To baste that sizzling pig on the spit” (36). Despite the severity of the final line, Circe is unable to overcome her emotions; in fact, she has been a whirlwind of moods throughout the entire monologue. Carol Ann Duffy’s “Circe” depicts a strong woman’s descent into the crazed debauchery of a woman scorned and abandoned. Moreover, this version of Circe seems more like Odysseus’s egoistical imaginings than a feminist attempt to empower a marginalized voice.\n\nCarol Ann Duffy’s “Circe” is a sexualized, violent representation of the original witch-goddess from Homer’s Odyssey. Through her use of contemporary revisionist dramatic monologues, Duffy borrows marginalized characters from literature and, in this case, mythology. However, instead of subverting those ideals that minimize female characters, Duffy has reaffirmed patriarchy through her modern intervention. Circe is portrayed as a desperate, lonely woman, grown old with experience and no longer desired unlike her companions, the nymphs and nereids. Though Carol Ann Duffy is a modern, feminist poet, she has created a pitiful version of Circe that befits a male representation of women, so instead of borrowing Circe and magnifying her power and benevolence as a magical, immortal goddess and thereby subverting the oppression of sexism produced so often by male authors, Duffy perpetuated those same negative connotations — dangerous woman, temptress, old maid — and reaffirmed patriarchy."
