        "text": "As a full time musician who performs up to 300 dates per year, I was obviously distressed when I discovered I had a vocal polyp. Dr Gupta came highly recommended to me so I drove from Las Vegas to Beverly Hills. I appreciated our conversation during the initial consultation, as she was the only surgeon who truly educated me on how dire my situation was as far as my singing career was concerned.\n\nOne of her former patients was kind enough to chat with me on her experience with Dr Gupta.\n\nThe one statement that stuck with me was “Your going to love your new voice! You’ll think you’re 18 again when you sing.”\n\nI am happy to say this is exactly my experience. I had to keep my mouth shut for 2 weeks post surgery (my wife loved this part) and very importantly, I followed all of her post-op instructions.\n\nI also worked diligently on my rehab after the 2 week vocal rest. I went back to singing after 5 weeks and am completely recovered after 10 weeks. Dr. Gupta and her skills saved my singing career."
