        "text": "Little Red-Cap\n\nAt childhood’s end, the houses petered out\n\ninto playing fields, the factory, allotments\n\nkept, like mistresses, by kneeling married men,\n\nthe silent railway line, the hermit’s caravan,\n\ntill you came at last to the edge of the woods.\n\nIt was there that I first clapped eyes on the\n\nwolf.\n\nHe stood in a clearing, reading his verse out\n\nloud\n\nin his wolfy drawl, a paperback in his hairy\n\npaw,\n\nred wine staining his bearded jaw. What big\n\nears\n\nhe had! What big eyes he had! What teeth!\n\nIn the interval, I made quite sure he spotted\n\nme,\n\nsweet sixteen, never been, babe, waif, and\n\nbought me a drink,\n\nmy first. You might ask why. Here’s why. Poetry.\n\nThe wolf, I knew, would lead me deep into the\n\nwoods,\n\naway from home, to a dark tangled thorny\n\nplace\n\nlit by the eyes of owls. I crawled in his wake,\n\nmy stockings ripped to shreds, scraps of red\n\nfrom my blazer\n\nsnagged on twig and branch, murder clues.\n\nI lost both shoes\n\nbut got there, wolf’s lair, better beware.\n\nLesson one that night,\n\nbreath of the wolf in my ear, was the love\n\npoem.\n\nI clung till dawn to his thrashing fur, for\n\nwhat little girl doesn’t dearly love a wolf?\n\nThen I slid from between his heavy matted\n\npaws\n\nand went in search of a living bird – white\n\ndove –\n\nwhich flew, straight, from my hands to his\n\nopen mouth.\n\nOne bite, dead. How nice, breakfast in bed,\n\nhe said,\n\nlicking his chops. As soon as he slept, I crept to\n\nthe back\n\nof the lair, where a whole wall was crimson,\n\ngold, aglow with books.\n\nWords, words were truly alive on the tongue,\n\nin the head,\n\nwarm, beating, frantic, winged; music and\n\nblood.\n\nBut then I was young – and it took ten years\n\nin the woods to tell that a mushroom\n\nstoppers the mouth of a buried corpse, that\n\nbirds\n\nare the uttered thought of trees, that a\n\ngreying wolf\n\nhowls the same old song at the moon, year in,\n\nyear out,\n\nseason after season, same rhyme, same\n\nreason. I took an axe\n\nto a willow to see how it wept. I took an axe to\n\na salmon\n\nto see how it leapt. I took an axe to the wolf\n\nas he slept, one chop, scrotum to throat, and\n\nsaw\n\nthe glistening, virgin white of my\n\ngrandmother’s bones.\n\nI filled his old belly with stones. I stitched\n\nhim up.\n\nOut of the forest I come with my flowers,\n\nsinging, all alone.\n\nPilate’s Wife\n\nFirstly, his hands — a woman’s. Softer than\n\nmine,\n\nwith pearly nails, like shells from Galilee.\n\nIndolent hands. Camp hands that clapped for\n\ngrapes.\n\nTheir pale, mothy touch made me flinch.\n\nPontius.\n\nI longed for Rome, home, someone else.\n\nWhen the Nazarene\n\nentered Jerusalem, my maid and I crept out,\n\nbored stiff, disguised, and joined the frenzied\n\ncrowd.\n\nI tripped, clutched the bridle of an ass, looked\n\nup\n\nand there he was. His face? Ugly. Talented.\n\nHe looked at me. I mean he looked at me. My\n\nGod.\n\nHis eyes were eyes to die for. Then he was\n\ngone,\n\nhis rough men shouldering a pathway to the\n\ngates.\n\nThe night before his trial, I dreamt of him.\n\nHis brown hands touched me. Then it hurt.\n\nThen blood. I saw that each tough palm was\n\nskewered\n\nby a nail. I woke up, sweating, sexual,\n\nterrified.\n\nLeave him alone. I sent a warning note, then\n\nquickly dressed.\n\nWhen I arrived, the Nazarene was crowned\n\nwith thorns.\n\nThe crowd was baying for Barabbas. Pilate\n\nsaw me,\n\nlooked away, then carefully turned up his\n\nsleeves\n\nand slowly washed his useless, perfumed\n\nhands.\n\nThey seized the prophet then and dragged\n\nhim out,\n\nup to the Place of Skulls. My maid knows all\n\nthe rest.\n\nWas he God? Of course not. Pilate believed\n\nhe was.\n\nMrs Aesop\n\nBy Christ, he could bore for Purgatory. He was\n\nsmall\n\ndidn’t prepossess. So he tried to impress.\n\nDead men,\n\nMrs Aesop, he’d say, tell no tales. Well, let me\n\ntell you now\n\nthat the bird in his hand shat on his sleeve,\n\nnever mind the two worth less in the bush.\n\nTedious.\n\nGoing out was worst. He’d stand at our gate,\n\nlook, then leap;\n\nscour the hedgerows for a shy mouse, the\n\nfields\n\nfor a sly fox, the sky for one particular\n\nswallow\n\nthat couldn’t make a summer. The jackdaw,\n\naccording to him,\n\nenvied the eagle. Donkeys, would, on the\n\nwhole, prefer to be lions.\n\nOn one appalling evening stroll, we passed\n\nan old hare\n\nsnoozing in a ditch – he stopped and made a\n\nnote – and then,\n\nabout a mile further on, a tortoise,\n\nsomebody’s pet,\n\ncreeping, slow as marriage, up the road. Slow but certain, Mrs Aesop, wins the race.\n\nAsshole.\n\nWhat race? What sour grapes? What silk\n\npurse,\n\nsow’s ear, dog in a manger, what big fish?\n\nSome days\n\nI could barely keep awake as the story\n\ndroned on\n\ntowards the moral of itself. Action, Mrs A,\n\nspeaks louder\n\nthan words. And that’s another thing, the sex\n\nwas diabolical. I gave him a fable one night\n\nabout a little cock that wouldn’t crow, a razor-\n\nsharp axe\n\nwith a heart blacker than the pot that called\n\nthe kettle.\n\nI’ll cut off your tail, all right, I said, to save my\n\nface.\n\nThat shut him up. I laughed last, longest.\n\nQueen Herod\n\nIce in the trees.\n\nThree Queens at the Palace gates,\n\ndressed in furs, accented;\n\ntheir several sweating, panting beasts\n\nladen for a long hard trek,\n\nfollowing the guide and boy to the stables;\n\ncourteous, confident; oh, and with gifts\n\nfor the King and Queen of here – Herod, me –\n\nin exchange for sunken baths, curtained beds,\n\nfruit, the best of meat and wine,\n\ndancers, music, talk –\n\nas it turned out to be,\n\nwith everyone fast asleep, save me,\n\nthose vivid three –\n\ntill bitter dawn.\n\nThey were wise. Older than I.\n\nThey knew what they knew.\n\nOnce drunken Herod’s head went back,\n\nthey asked to see her,\n\nfast asleep in her crib,\n\nmy little child.\n\nSilver and gold,\n\nthe loose change of herself,\n\nglowed in the soft bowl of her face.\n\nGrace, said the tallest Queen.\n\nStrength, said the Queen with the hennaed\n\nhands.\n\nThe black Queen\n\nmade a tiny starfish of my daughter’s fist,\n\nsaid Happiness; then stared at me,\n\nQueen to Queen, with insolent lust.\n\nWatch, they said, for a star in the east –\n\na new star\n\npierced through the night like a nail.\n\nIt means he’s here, alive, newborn.\n\nWho? Him. The Husband. Hero. Hunk.\n\nThe Boy Next Door. The Paramour. The\n\nJe t’adore.\n\nThe Marrying Kind. Adulterer. Bigamist.\n\nThe Wolf. The Rip. The Rake. The Rat.\n\nThe Heartbreaker. The Ladykiller. Mr Right.\n\nMy baby stirred,\n\nsuckled the empty air for milk,\n\ntill I knelt\n\nand the black Queen scooped out my breast,\n\nthe left, guiding it down\n\nto the infant’s mouth.\n\nNo man, I swore,\n\nwill make her shed one tear.\n\nA peacock screamed outside.\n\nAfterwards, it seemed like a dream.\n\nI saw the fierce eyes of the black Queen\n\nflash again, felt her urgent warnings scald\n\nmy ear. Watch for a star, a star.\n\nIt means he’s here …\n\nSome swaggering lad to break her heart,\n\nsome wincing Prince to take her name away\n\nand give a ring, a nothing, a nought in gold.\n\nI sent for the Chief of Staff,\n\na mountain man\n\nwith a red scar, like a tick\n\nto the mean stare of his eye.\n\nTake men and horses,\n\nknives, swords, cutlasses.\n\nRide East from here\n\nand kill each mother’s son.\n\nDo it. Spare not one.\n\nThe midnight hour. The chattering stars\n\nshivered in a nervous sky.\n\nOrion to the South\n\nwho knew the score, who’d seen,\n\nnot seen, then seen it all before;\n\nthe yapping Dog Star at his heels.\n\nHigh up in the West\n\na studded, diamond W.\n\nAnd then, as prophesied,\n\nblatant, brazen, buoyant in the East –\n\nand blue –\n\nThe Boyfriend’s Star.\n\nWe do our best,\n\nwe Queens, we mothers,\n\nmothers of Queens.\n\nWe wade through blood\n\nfor our sleeping girls.\n\nWe have daggers for eyes.\n\nBehind our lullabies,\n\nthe hooves of terrible horses\n\nthunder and drum.\n\n4.75\n\nLadies, Ladies, Ladies\n\nSalome\n\nI’d done it before (and doubtless I’ll do it\n\nagain, sooner or later)\n\nwoke up with a head on the pillow beside me – whose? –\n\nwhat did it matter?\n\nGood-looking, of course, dark hair, rather\n\nmatted;\n\nthe reddish beard several shades lighter;\n\nwith very deep lines around the eyes,\n\nfrom pain, I’d guess, maybe laughter;\n\nand a beautiful crimson mouth that obviously\n\nknew\n\nhow to flatter …\n\nwhich I kissed …\n\nColder than pewter.\n\nStrange. What was his name? Peter?\n\nSimon? Andrew? John? I knew I’d feel better\n\nfor tea, dry toast, no butter,\n\nso rang for the maid.\n\nAnd, indeed, her innocent clatter\n\nof cups and plates,\n\nher clearing of clutter,\n\nher regional patter,\n\nwere just what I needed –\n\nhungover and wrecked as I was from a night\n\non the batter.\n\nNever again!\n\nI needed to clean up my act,\n\nget fitter,\n\ncut out the booze and the fags and the sex.\n\nYes. And as for the latter,\n\nit was time to turf out the blighter,\n\nthe beater or biter,\n\nwho’d come like a lamb to the slaughter\n\nto Salome’s bed.\n\nIn the mirror, I saw my eyes glitter.\n\nI flung back the sticky red sheets,\n\nand there, like I said – and ain’t life a bitch –\n\nwas his head on a platter.\n\nMrs Icarus\n\nI’m not the first or the last\n\nTo stand on a hillock,\n\nWatching the man she married\n\nProve to the world\n\nHe’s a total, utter, absolute, Grade A pillock.\n\nMedusa\n\nA suspicion, a doubt, a jealousy\n\ngrew in my mind,\n\nwhich turned the hairs on my head to filthy\n\nsnakes,\n\nas though my thoughts\n\nhissed and spat on my scalp.\n\nMy bride’s breath soured, stank\n\nin the grey bags of my lungs.\n\nI’m foul mouthed now, foul tongued,\n\nyellow fanged.\n\nThere are bullet tears in my eyes.\n\nAre you terrified?\n\nBe terrified.\n\nIt’s you I love,\n\nperfect man, Greek God, my own;\n\nbut I know you’ll go, betray me, stray\n\nfrom home.\n\nSo better by far for me if you were stone.\n\nI glanced at a buzzing bee,\n\na dull grey pebble fell\n\nto the ground.\n\nI glanced at a singing bird,\n\na handful of dusty gravel\n\nspattered down.\n\nI looked at a ginger cat,\n\na housebrick\n\nshattered a bowl of milk.\n\nI looked at a snuffling pig,\n\na boulder rolled\n\nin a heap of shit.\n\nI stared in the mirror.\n\nLove gone bad\n\nshowed me a Gorgon.\n\nI stared at a dragon.\n\nFire spewed\n\nfrom the mouth of a mountain.\n\nAnd here you come\n\nwith a shield for a heart\n\nand a sword for a tongue\n\nand your girls, your girls.\n\nWasn’t I beautiful?\n\nWasn’t I fragrant and young?\n\nLook at me now.\n\nLook at me now.\n\nLook\n\nAnne Hathaway\n\n‘Item I gyve unto my wife my second best\n\nbed ...’\n\n(from Shakespeare’s will)\n\nThe bed we loved in was a spinning world\n\nof forests, castles, torchlight, clifftops, seas\n\nwhere we would dive for pearls. My lover’s\n\nwords\n\nwere shooting stars which fell to earth as\n\nkisses\n\non these lips; my body now a softer rhyme\n\nto his, now echo, assonance; his touch\n\na verb dancing in the centre of a noun.\n\nSome nights, I dreamed he’d written me, the\n\nbed\n\na page beneath his writer’s hands. Romance\n\nand drama played by touch, by scent, by\n\ntaste.\n\nIn the other bed, the best, our guests dozed on,\n\ndribbling their prose. My living laughing\n\nlove –\n\nI hold him in the casket of my widow’s head\n\nas he held me upon that next best bed.\n\nMrs Beast\n\nThese myths going round, these legends,\n\nfairytales,\n\nI’ll put them straight; so when you stare\n\nInto my face – Helen’s face, Cleopatra’s,\n\nQueen of Sheba’s, Juliet’s – then, deeper,\n\nGaze into my eyes – Nefertiti’s, Mona Lisa’s,\n\nGarbo’s eyes - think again. The Little Mermaid\n\nslit\n\nHer shining, silver tail in two, rubbed salt\n\nInto that stinking wound, got up and walked,\n\nIn agony, in fishnet tights, stood up and\n\nsmiled, waltzed,\n\nAll for a Prince, a pretty boy, a charming one\n\nWho’d dump her in the end, chuck her, throw\n\nher overboard.\n\nI could have told her – look, love, I should\n\nknow,\n\nThey’re bastards when they’re Princes.\n\nWhat you want to do is find yourself a beast.\n\nThe sex\n\nIs better.\n\nOn my poker nights, the Beast\n\nKept out of sight. We were a hard school,\n\ntough as fuck,\n\nAll of us beautiful and rich – the Woman\n\nWho Married a Minotaur, Goldilocks, the Bride\n\nOf the Bearded Lesbian, Frau Yellow Dwarf,\n\net Moi.\n\nI watched those wonderful women shuffle and\n\ndeal –\n\nFive and Seven Card Stud, Sidewinder, Hold\n\n‘Em, Draw –\n\nI watched them bet and raise and call.\n\nBut behind each player stood a line of ghosts\n\nUnable to win. Eve, Ashputtel. Marilyn\n\nMonroe.\n\nRapunzel slashing wildly at her hair.\n\nBessie Smith unloved and down and out.\n\nBluebeard’s wives, Henry VIII’s, Snow White\n\nCursing the day she left the seven dwarfs,\n\nDiana,\n\nPrincess of Wales. The sheepish Beast came in\n\nWith a tray of schnapps at the end of the\n\ngame\n\nAnd we stood for the toast – Fay Wray –\n\nThen tossed our fiery drinks to the back of our\n\ncrimson throats.\n\nBad girls. Serious ladies. Mourning our dead.\n\nSo I was hard on the Beast, win or lose,\n\nWhen I got upstairs, those tragic girls in my\n\nhead,\n\nTurfing him out of bed; standing alone\n\nOn the balcony, the night so cold I could taste the stars\n\nOn the tip of my tongue. And I made a\n\nprayer –\n\nThumbing my pearls, the tears of Mary, one\n\nby one,\n\nLike a rosary – words for the lost, the captive\n\nbeautiful,\n\nThe wives, those less fortunate than we.\n\nWives Choir texts\n\n– Look at me now\n\n– We do our best, we Queens, we mothers,\n\nmothers of Queens\n\n– I’m not the first or the last\n\n– Ladies, Ladies, Ladies\n\n– Be terrified, it’s you I love\n\nThe moon was a hand-mirror breathed on by\n\na Queen.\n\nMy breath was a chiffon scarf for an elegant\n\nghost.\n\nI turned to go back inside. Bring me the Beast\n\nfor the night.\n\nBring me the wine-cellar key. Let the less-\n\nloving one be me.\n\nDemeter\n\nWhere I lived – winter and hard earth.\n\nI sat in my cold stone room\n\nchoosing tough words, granite, flint,\n\nto break the ice. My broken heart –\n\nI tried that, but it skimmed,\n\nflat, over the frozen lake.\n\nShe came from a long, long way,\n\nbut I saw her at last, walking,\n\nmy daughter, my girl, across the fields,\n\nin bare feet, bringing all spring’s flowers\n\nto her mother’s house. I swear\n\nthe air softened and warmed as she moved,\n\nthe blue sky smiling, none too soon,\n\nwith the small shy mouth of a new moon.\n\nCarol Ann Duffy (born 1955)"
