        "text": "You talk about Dusty Springfield, Duffy has been compared to her, did you enjoy working on her debut album and did you anticipate the success that Duffy would have with Rockferry?\n\nBernard Butler: I didn’t see that coming. I did all of the stuff with her, we did it in my bedroom and we did it all there and we were working on and off for three years. Rockferry was the very first song we wrote and we wrote it within an hour of our first day. For the next three years we did work endlessly and we did 6 or 7 songs for the album and she was also working with other people. At the end we pulled it together at the end with a compilations of the best songs. We had no idea what was going to happen. She was a real fizzbomb and a effervescent person and got quite happy and I got the feeling that behind the smile, there was quite a nervy and a lot of nervous energy. I always liked her and it was a crazy time. We didn’t expect it to escalate the way it did.\n\nWere you disappointed not to be involved with the second record?\n\nBernard Butler: No, because I chose not to be. She was doing it in a different way. We did a few things around the time she was going to start to record the second album and I just said you’re writing about being famous here and when we met we was writing about Rockferry, this tiny place that she related to but went onto become an 8 million selling record. I had a feeling that it just wasn’t right and I just let it go. She did the second record her own way and she sort of live by the sword, die by the sword in a way for that album. It was a hard time for her and there was no way of following that album up and it was incredibly hard. I always wanted to get out when I felt that the record wasn’t going to be as good. This was the same with Suede. I really like her and I’m protective of her and people are to quick to knock her down after her second record.\n\nYou can only imagine the amount of times I thought about writing this. The way I would write it, how I would feel thereafter. Well, not entirely sure why now is the right time, and what it is that feels exciting and liberating for me to talk. I cannot explain it. Many of you wonder what happened to me, where did I disappear to and why. A journalist contacted me, he found a way to reach me and I told him everything this past summer. He was kind and it felt so amazing to finally speak. The truth is, and please trust me I am ok and safe now, I was raped and drugged and held captive over some days. Of course I survived. The recovery took time. There’s no light way to say it. But I can tell you in the last decade, the thousands and thousands of days I committed to wanting to feel the sunshine in my heart again, the sun does now shine. You wonder why I did not choose to use my voice to express my pain? I did not want to show the world the sadness in my eyes. I asked myself, how can I sing from the heart if it is broken? And slowly it unbroke. In the following weeks I will be posting a spoken interview. If you have any questions I would like to answer them, in the spoken interview, if I can. I have a sacred love and sincere appreciation for your kindness over the years. You have been friends. I want to thank you for that x\n\nDuffy\n\nPlease respect this is a gentle move for me to make, for myself, and I do not want any intrusion to my family. Please support me to make this a positive experience."
