I haven't heard any of her music but I will take your word for it.\n\nPost by oscillations. on\n\nThey are planning a massive stateside push for this in the spring.\n\nPost by CammyCan on\n\nWarwick Avenue is the next single in the UK. Love the song, but I hope Delayed Devotion gets a single release sooner or later.\n\nPost by vinyl on\n\nWarwick Avenue is the next single in the UK. Love the song, but I hope Delayed Devotion gets a single release sooner or later.\n\nOoh I'm glad Warwick Avenue is the single.\n\nAnd yeah, Delayed Devotion is definitely a, or the, stand out for me right now.\n\nI'm only disappointed there is nothing that is as \"funky\" as Mercy on the album - otherwise, it's pretty great.\n\nPost by No Passengers On Her Plane! on\n\n\"Delayed Devotion\" & \"Scared\" should be released..somewhere down the line\n\nPost by areyoureadytojump on\n\nThis the official Duffy thread.\n\nPost by nadioz on\n\ni'm going to her Paris concert but haven't heard the album yet, just \"mercy\" great song !!\n\nPost by K. on\n\nThis album puts Amy's to shame, IMO.\n\nIf you want to stream it, see if this link works: www.imeem.com/dialogs/standaloneplaylist/?p=nq2hTobO I'm not sure if you have to be a member or not to get full clips.\n\nPost by Linnethia Monique on\n\nI don't like the American version of the Mercy video.\n\nPost by Coin-Operated [Boy] on\n\nI'm really glad Warwick Avenue is the next single. This album is phenomenal, hopefully the US push is really massive.\n\nPost by RAFA on\n\n^ It's her last name - Aimee Duffy, but she dropped the Aimee a few years ago.\n\nThis album is one of my faves this year; i had it on repeat constantly a month or two ago.\n\nI love Mercy, Rockferry, Delayed Devotion, Distant Dreamer, Hanging On Too Long & Stepping Stone.\n\nPost by vinyl on\n\nThis album puts Amy's to shame, IMO.\n\nI strongly disagree but it is a very very good album. :)\n\nPost by CammyCan on\n\nI don't think it puts Amy's to shame (seeing as they're two really different styles, its hard to compare), but I do prefer Rockferry to BTB. But BTB is still pretty amazing\n\nPost by ~ M-Dolla ¤ on\n\nLOVE Mercy!!\n\nGirl has an AMAZING live voice! Very impressed! I will be buying her album!\n\nAs for Back To Black and Rockferry, I prefer the BTB but R is a good album too!\n\nPost by OH SNAP! on\n\nIs there anywhere I can download a VBR version of the album since it's not available here for a while? Thanks anyone!\n\nPost by Coin-Operated [Boy] on\n\nThe single is already on #67! Physical release isnt until late May!"
