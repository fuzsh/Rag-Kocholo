        "text": "Poem: Never Go Back\n\nThe meaning of the poem:\n\nNever go back appears to be a poem telling a story of a persona who has returned to their hometown in order to clear up a house that they once lived in. The house appears to be metaphorical for the destruction and decay of a once happy marriage. Unhappiness is an endemic feeling throughout the poem and the reality is that the person leaves the town and seems to be relieved that it is over and that they are able to return to their new life and leave behind the unhappiness and the misery that they once felt.\n\nQuote 1:\n\n“living dead drink all day” uses plosive sounds to reinforce the futility of the pursuit of happiness at the bottom of a glass of alcohol. This opening line uses a metaphor to compare the people in the pub to zombbified creatures who have little to no purpose in their lives, eliciting sympathy for them, in a pitying way. However, the juxtaposing imagery of “living dead” shows that they do actually have a life and perhaps this is their choice and they are satisfied with this half-life standing in a pub drinking. There is a real sense of judgement from the persona for the choices that these nameless people have made in their lives, although they are nameless and faceless and could be reflective of any bar in any town, where people who have little emotional comfort in their lives take refuge, or where alcoholics go to get a fix. It is a thoroughly depressing opening line, which supports the depressing tone of the rest of the poem.\n\nQuote 2:\n\n“Outside, the streets tear litter in their thin hands,” personifies the streets in a way that makes them seem like they are wringing their hands in despair. This imagery gives the impression of a dirty, downtrodden and hopeless sort of area, which again could be anywhere and implies that the people of the town have given up caring for the environment that they live in. Again, the negativity if rife in the stanza and this first line creates a sense of despair and helplessness, which radiates through the people and the town. Once more, the persona is commenting on how terrible everything appears here.\n\nQuote 3:\n\n“The house where you were one of the brides has cancer.” Uses enjambment to reinforce the negativity in the disease that is metaphorically personifying the house into a someone. It could be an indication of the marriage itself as the word “bride” connotes youth and hopefulness, but this juxtaposes the actual reality of the cancerous growth that the house is presented with. It suggests that this was a past tense occurrence and that it happened previously. It is indicative that the persona is reflecting on a time before, where they were unhappy, when love perhaps had soured and created a misery in their soul.\n\nQuote 4:\n\n“A taxi implying a hearse” shows that metaphorically leaving the town and the house and the relationship is like a death in itself. The ‘implying’ is tentative and shows that this is not a real death, maybe more of an ending or closure from the past. Although the imagery is very negative here, there is a sense that leaving is the right thing to do and it gives a sense of release for the persona.\n\nQuote 5:\n\nForget. Already the fires and lights come on wherever you live” In the final metaphor here we are treated to a sense of finality and relief and forgetting of the past, as if by leaving the town the persona is able to breathe and be themselves again. Although there is a real sense of sadness, this fades quickly when the persona is removed from the physical reminders of a previous bad time. Duffy reinforces many of the stereotypes of relationships gone wrong and beautifully and skilfully encapsulates the range of emotions that the persona would feel when the end has happened and moving on in life has to happen.\n\nStructure of the poem:\n\nDuffy uses a lot of enjambment throughout with short sentences, which creates a stilted experience when reading the poem and perhaps this is a purposeful structural device to show the ebb and flow of memory. Sometimes, the memories are sharp, quick and painful reinforced in the short sentences and sometimes they need time to be aired in the longer more complex sentences and the use of enjambment. Furthermore, the poem has 6 long stanzas which imply that time to process the complexity of the issues and thoughts and feelings of the persona are needed.\n\nDuffy’s Intentions:\n\nShe seems to be exploring the break of a relationship and processing the feelings that this creates, in a realistic but raw way. Perhaps, she intended to reinforce how difficult it is to break up, but that life does move on and these feelings can be transient, but felt deeply at the time.\n\nContext/Critics:\n\nDuffy has experienced a break up of a relationship after a long time, so perhaps this is reflecting on that experience or her understanding as a women of the feelings and loss that occurs when breaking up with a partner. One critic has suggested that “Duffy uses everyday language to bring difficult issues to the forefront” and this is certainly true of Never Go Back, with even the name suggesting that the poem will hold painful emotions and a sense of regret at returning and reflecting on the past."
