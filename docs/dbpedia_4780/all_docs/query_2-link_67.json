        "text": "Text World Theory in “Mrs Midas”\n\nYasemin Çelebi, 20 December 2014\n\nCarol Ann Duffy’s poem “Mrs Midas” is a part of a series of poems in the book The World’s Wife that tell mythological or historical stories through the viewpoint of fictitious or real female figures. “Mrs Midas” is a poem that addresses the myth of Dionysus granting King Midas his wish of Gold-touch – However, instead of a third person narrator as is traditional in myth, it is told in first person by the poetic persona of Mrs Midas. Carol Ann Duffy likely employs this persona to bring the reader’s attention to the original myth’s lack of female depiction and voice. Through stylistic analysis we can observe how Duffy has constructed the poem’s text-world in a way that will induce a schema refreshment of the myth in the reader (Jeffries and McIntyre 132).\n\nThe text-world of “Mrs Midas” is, despite incorporating the fantasy element of Midas’ touch, identical to the current Western world. In the first stanza of the poem, our introduction to the Text world, we are only given world-building elements (Gavins 256) that are familiar to the average Western reader. We see that there are distinct characters, “he” and “I”, which from the title can be inferred to be Mr and Mrs Midas; a distinct location of the Midas’ house and garden; a rather indistinct time of “late September”, yet we can infer that it is close to current Actual World time due to objects such as “Caravan”, “Fast-food” and “Light bulb” that appear later on in the poem, and that show the poem is set in the modern era; and many numerous objects. The function-advancing propositions (Gavins 256) too are clear and incorporate typical actions of the modern day, such as having wine to “unwind” while cooking. While at first this information may seem trivial to the reader of the poem, the amount of world-building information given really cements the poem in the normal every day; thus making the text-world much more relatable to the reader than the one of the original myth. By deciding to situate the text world in the modern day, instead of an Ancient Greek mythological landscape as was the original, the reader can more easily situate themselves in the text. According to Schema Theory, upon reading a text we bring along with us our prior knowledge and experiences (Stockwell 77). This allows, when two people are in discourse, for them to introduce larger concepts without having to explain every detail (Stockwell 76). Thus by using a familiar schema of modern daily life, we can fill in the blanks of the narrative easier, and construct a more complete text-world. This allows us to also visualise the text-world much better, but perhaps more importantly, the familiar schema makes the Text-world more relatable to the reader.\n\nAlso another detail that potentially strengthens the reader’s connection to the text-world is that the Origo of the text is on Mrs Midas – not the character going through the curse, but the one impacted by it. It is hard for someone to imagine themselves being a man who can turn things into gold, but much easier to imagine themselves as an observer to the fantastical situation. Also as the observation is given in the Dramatic Monologue technique – which means the poem’s persona addresses another person, who is silent and frequently will not even be clearly defined. What this technique does to the text is that it potentially gives a place for the reader situate themselves in the text-world. The reader upon reading can take the place as the silent Listener figure, getting the impression that they are in direct conversation with Mrs Midas (Deryn Rees-Jones 19).\n\nThe use of schemata foregrounds Mrs Midas while pushing Midas to the background. At the first stanza of the poem, Duffy invokes the script of a well-to-do middle-class couple in the British countryside. She does this not by explicitly stating the class of these characters, but letting us infer it from these world-building elements and function-advancing propositions in the first stanza of the text. Some readers will know that the concept of having a glass of wine while cooking dinner, as one is looking at a garden one has themselves cultivated with care, is a very British middle-class concept. Of course as scripts change according to person, this may be different for another reader, but there is no way to invoke the exact same schema in every reader, as everyone has different histories of experiences (Stockwell 77-78). When we focus on solely Mrs Midas, we see that despite this use of typical middle-class script, Mrs Midas is made into a distinctly three dimensional character. Throughout the poem there is a lot of implicit characterization of her, giving us an impression of the schema of a middle class housewife trying to be highbrow through the objects she owns – On line 10, not calling it a pear tree, but very specifically a “Fondante d’Automne” pear tree; on line 23, not wine but “bone-dry white from Italy”. However, according to Culpeper’s model of character analysis, concepts that are schema-based are forgettable. As Duffy, through the inversion of a classic myth, most likely wishes to break down our existing schema of it and give the reader a new schema (Jeffries and McIntyre 132). This is called “Schema Refreshment”. As leaving the characters as solely schemata would not give the impact needed to impart an new idea or perspective on them, Duffy raises the reader through a slow dramatic recategorization of Mrs Midas (Culpeper 96-99). Thus the previous impression of her as an archetype of typical English upper middle-class housewife is changed into someone who could be a real person. The character goes through the trials of being in an extremely fantastical and usual situation that culminates in the slow death of her husband, and through this trial she goes through a realisation that, deep down, she values love and care more than material goods. This is of course not explicitly stated, but inferred in between the biased story-telling technique and clues dropped from the poet – On line 61, the word “now” in “What gets me now is not the idiocy or greed …” is telling that this is a rejudgement, and that her opinion “now” is different to the one she had before. In contrast Midas is made to be as one-dimensional as possible. The information given on the other main character is mostly explicit characterization and only given through the subjective viewpoint of Mrs Midas – that he sits with a “wild” and “vain” expression on his face (Line 17), that he is “greedy” (Line 61) and “selfish” (Line 62). Also he undergoes no recategorization, from the moment of his entrance into the house (Stanza 3) he is represented as vain, and as the situation escalates Mrs Midas’ representation of him does not change. He becomes the archetype of Greed rather than a human being. Thus Duffy, by making Mrs Midas central to the text, guides us to thinking more about her and subtly pushes the reader away from trying to deeply understand Midas.\n\nIn second stanza of the text, a fantasy element has been added with Midas’ gold-touch. We assume that the text will continue with our script of fantasy fiction, but instead Mrs Midas continues to act in our script of what a “normal” every day person would act. This clashes with our fantasy schema and by turning our schema upside down humour is added (Short 230-231). This can have many possible effects – creating laughter is a common rhetorical device, which will make a listener more easier to convince to an argument. Also, making Mrs Midas funny creates a likeable character we are willing to relate to. Furthermore one could argue that not continuing with the fantasy schema reinforces how this ordinary this character is meant to be. The normality of the function-advancing propositions correlates more with the discourse world, making her the most relatable character in the text.\n\nBeyond the schemas used to create familiar context, second is the use of Deictic expressions, which is numerous in the text. This is used when the speaker is assumes the listener knows what they are talking about, that they have shared knowledge of the situation. This is another quality that alienates Midas from the reader and instead forefronts Mrs Midas. Mrs Midas’ use of deictic expressions make it clear that the reader is the “in-crowd”, that they are someone that knows Mrs Midas already and has shared information with them beforehand. Deictic expressions of Space such as the locative adverb in lines 62-63, “I sold / the contents of the house and came down here”, is where the speaker Mrs Midas assumes we know where she is situated right now. Frequent use of the definite article is also employed – “the kitchen” (Line 2) and “the spare room”(Line 43), showing that these are known quantities. However, deictic phrases distance us from Midas. He is never stated with name, instead only named by pronoun “he”, while Mrs Midas is always “I”. This makes him an “other” figure, while Mrs Midas is a part of the in-group.\n\nThe language and meter of the poem also shows that the writer has constructed the text world in a way that is meant to reel the listener into it. The sentences are constructed in casual speech, written in six lined free-verse stanzas, with no particular rhythm to them. The sentences frequently continue from one line to the other, called Enjambment or Run-on in literary terms. This, could be argued, makes upon reading sound less like a lined poem, but instead more like natural speech. Language Schemata is a distinct field of schemata that describes what linguistic style we expect a subject to appear (Gregoriou 88). Keeping this in mind, when we observe the poem is written in the manner of everyday speech, we can conclude that the language used in the text-world correlates with the reader’s language schemata.\n\nThe Discourse world, consisting of Carol Ann Duffy and the reader, is the poet attempting to refresh the schema of the myth of King Midas. By inserting a female figure when there previously was none, Duffy foregrounds the lack of female voice in the original myth. She draws the reader’s attention to this difference by using subtle techniques to make the female figure more relatable: Making the Origo of the text Mrs Midas, and primarily characterizing her instead of Midas, making Mrs Midas defy our expected schema to create humour and depth. Using deictic phrases to let the reader infer that the listener and the persona are close, and in the same in-group. Making the Text-world close to the Discourse world, instead to a Ancient Greek mythological landscape, lets the reader immerse themselves in the poem easily. Through stylistic analysis we can more easily see the methods employed by Carol Ann Duffy to influence the reader into become more sympathetic to her viewpoint of the myth and eventually go through schema refreshment.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nShort, Mick.
