        "text": "Bio:\n\nBorn and raised in Albany, New York, Annabelle Duffy fell in love with drama watching Turner Classic Movies, where she learned very early on that it is the most glamorous and outrageous of women who hold all the cards. She took these lessons and poured herself into dramatic retellings of her favorite children’s books for her family until finally she landed her first public performance at age 8 as Lullaby Munchkin #2 in The Wizard of Oz at the community theatre down the street. She never looked back.\n\nAnnabelle went on to develop a deep love of all things musical theatre, and dove head first into the magical world of community theatre, where she was able to find herself through playing unapologetic, spunky characters like Katherine in Newsies and Charity in Sweet Charity. She feels incredibly lucky for the training she received in CMU’s drama program, where she has been able to explore her identity as an actor through roles like Ophelia in Hamlet and Jessica in This is Our Youth.\n\nAside from performing, Annabelle enjoys listening to jazz music, painting (badly), and riding her bike. She is also a jazz vocalist, and in her senior year at CMU organized a jazz concert as a part of the School of Drama’s Playground Festival, turning the lobby of the drama building into a jazz club with a full band, lineup of singers, and dance floor. Her favorite artistic influences include funny, fabulous women such as Natasha Lyonne, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, and Liza Minnelli."
