        "text": "Summary of ‘Mean Time’ by Carol Ann Duffy\n\nContext of ‘Mean Time’ by Carol Ann Duffy\n\nWe will discuss the context of the poem as well as the anthology that it's a part of.\n\nBiographical context\n\nCarol Ann Duffy is a Scottish poet who has spent the majority of her adult life writing. Her first job after graduating was writing for television shows. Between 1982 and1984 Duffy worked as a writer-in-residence in East End schools of London after receiving a C. Day Lewis Fellowship.\n\nIn 1983 Duffy won the National Poetry Competition and in 2009 she was appointed Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, becoming the first woman to receive the position since its creation in 1616.\n\nMean Time anthology\n\nThe poem 'Mean Time' is part of the collection of the same name. The collection was published in 1993 and received the Whitbread Poetry and Forward Prizes.\n\nMean Time is Carol Ann Duffy’s fourth poetry collection, consisting of 39 poems. The dominant theme in the collection is relationships. This theme is explored in both positive and negative lights, often in a reflective style as the narrator looks back at past events.\n\nDo you think your reading of 'Mean Time' would change if you read it as part of the collection as a whole rather than as an individual poem?\n\nAnalysis of ‘Mean Time’ by Carol Ann Duffy\n\nThe clocks slid back an hour\n\nand stole light from my life\n\nas I walked through the wrong part of town,\n\nmourning our love.\n\nAnd, of course, unmendable rain\n\nfell to the bleak streets\n\nwhere I felt my heart gnaw\n\nat all our mistakes.\n\nIf the darkening sky could lift\n\nmore than one hour from this day\n\nthere are words I would never have said\n\nnor have heard you say.\n\nBut we will be dead, as we know,\n\nbeyond all light.\n\nThese are the shortened days\n\nand the endless nights.\n\nTitle\n\nThe title of the poem is polysemic and its meaning is ambiguous. The title could refer to the phrase ‘in the meantime’, the period of time when one is waiting for something to happen. It could also refer to Greenwich Mean Time, the measurement of time in London. Or, if you want to be more literal in how you interpret the title, it may be a personification of time itself, giving the abstract noun the attribute of being ‘mean’.\n\nPolysemy: a word with multiple different meanings.\n\nWhat do you think the effect of this ambiguity is? Do you think Carol Ann Duffy wanted the title to be ambiguous?\n\nForm\n\nThe poem is written in free-verse contrasting with its regular stanzaic structure made up of four quatrains. The use of free-verse creates a rhythm which flows naturally, as though the narrator is processing and expressing their emotions in the moment.\n\nQuatrain: a stanza made up of four lines.\n\nStructure\n\n‘Mean Time’ consists of four stanzas each made up of four lines, also known as a quatrain. While the stanzaic structure of the poem is regular, the poem as a whole is written in free-verse with an irregular rhyme scheme.\n\nA number of meters are used in the poem, creating a sense of detachment, as if the narrator is lost and trying to find their place. Anapaestic meter mixed with iambic meter dominates the poem, and occasionally the lines begin with a trochaic meter or falling rhythm.\n\nAnapaestic meter: two unstressed syllables followed by a stressed syllable.\n\nIambic meter: a line made up of iambs. An iamb consists of two syllables, one unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable.\n\nTrochaic meter: a line made up of trochees. A trochee consists of two syllables, the first one is a stressed syllable and the second one is unstressed.\n\nThe use of consonant and assonant rhymes throughout the poem creates a sense of cohesion amongst the varied line length, varied meters, and enjambment. The variety in the poem's structure underpins the state of emotional uncertainty and rawness the narrator finds themself in.\n\nConsonant rhyme: words which contain the same consonant (non-vowel) sounds.\n\nAssonant rhyme: words which contain the same vowel (a, e, i, o, u) sounds.\n\nStanza one\n\nThe opening stanza provides some clarity to the poem's ambiguous title, with a reference to the end of Daylight Savings. The narrator proceeds to compare the ending of a relationship, and the sense of loss they feel, to there being less light in the evening. This comparison indicates that the loss of the relationship has caused disruption and wrongness in the narrator's life, leaving them walking through the wrong part of town, mourning love.\n\nStanza two\n\nThe second stanza has the same sense of loss and despair present in the first. Pathetic fallacy is utilized to emphasize the pessimistic mood and tone of the poem:\n\nAnd, of course, unmendable rain fell to the bleak streets\n\nThe image of the narrator walking in the rain while contemplating their heartbreak parallels cliché images of lost love used in romantic movies. The bleak setting underpins the poet’s feelings of hopelessness.\n\nPathetic fallacy: the use of weather or the natural world to convey human emotion.\n\nAlongside this, there is a consonant rhyme between the second and final lines of the stanza with ‘streets’ and ‘mistakes’. The consonant rhyme of ‘s’ creates a sense of displacement and emptiness. We expect the rhyme to be full, yet it is incomplete, underpinning the narrator’s own feelings of loneliness.\n\nStanza three\n\nIn this stanza, there is a shift in the narrative. Rather than resenting their current circumstances, the narrator considers a different future:\n\nIf the darkening sky could lift\n\nmore than one hour from this day\n\nThe conjunction 'if' combined with the modal verb 'could' creates a sense of wonder, a ‘what if’. The narrator ponders whether things could have been different in the relationship if they didn’t say or do certain things. This adds an element of regret to the poem’s pessimistic tone.\n\nStanza four\n\nThe fourth and final stanza of the poem progresses from a tone of regret to one of resignation. The narrator accepts the 'shortened days' and 'endless nights', acknowledging that they can't change how things are. The monosyllabic language used throughout the poem supplements this tone of resignation: the narrator’s stance is clear and resolved. This is emphasised by the half rhyme of ‘light’ and ‘nights’ in the second and final line of the stanza. There is a sense of finality to the poem as the narrator continues to walk into the ‘night’ knowing that they can't return to the ‘light’ of their relationship.\n\nPoetic devices\n\nLet's study the poetic devices in the poem.\n\nEnjambment\n\nDuffy’s use of enjambment fragments the poem. The narrator’s thoughts are considered, but not entirely fluid. This lack of fluidity, combined with the use of a free-verse form, highlights how the narrator is struggling to process their feelings and hurt.\n\nFor instance, in the third stanza enjambment is used throughout:\n\nIf the darkening sky could liftmore than one hour from this daythere are words I would never have saidnor have heard you say.\n\nHere, the use of enjambment creates pauses between each line, suggesting that the narrator is hesitant to consider how things could have been. These pauses produce a regretful tone as the narrator reflects on their actions.\n\nEnd-stopped lines\n\nEach stanza of ‘Mean Time’ ends with an end-stopped line. The end-stopped lines create pauses between each stanza, enhancing the slight shifts in the narrative across the different stanzas.\n\nFor instance, while the second stanza focuses on the narrator's action of walking through ‘the bleak streets’ in ‘unmendable rain’, the third stanza centres on the narrator wondering if things could have been different if they never ‘said’ or ‘heard’ their partner say certain words.\n\nThrough creating pauses in the poem’s rhythm at structurally obvious points (the end of the stanza) a considered element is added to the poem’s pessimistic tone. The narrator may be going through the motions of their breakup, but they’re also pondering how to express those feelings.\n\nAssonance\n\nAssonance is used throughout the poem to create partial rhymes between words. For instance, in the second stanza, the line\n\nfell to the bleak streets\n\ncontains the repetition of the 'e' sound; 'fell', 'bleak', 'streets'. This assonance contributes to the poem's rhythm, allowing it to flow, as though the narrator is going through the motions of their day and the grief they are experiencing.\n\nLanguage devices\n\nThe language devices of the poem include:\n\nMonosyllabic language\n\nThe poem uses simplistic language to create a blunt and direct tone, underpinning the grief one may feel upon the ending of a relationship. For instance, in the third stanza, Duffy writes:\n\nmore than one hour from this day\n\nthere are words I would never have said\n\nnor have heard you say.\n\nIn the final three lines of this stanza, there is one word with more than one syllable, 'never'. The use of monosyllabic, simplistic language provides a sense of clarity to the narrative poem. The language used, and the connotations it holds, are clear.\n\nMoreover, these short simplistic words add to the poem's blunt tone by creating a steady, almost monotone rhythm. The bluntness, and apparent lack of emotion, in place of wobbling grief or lengthy complex sentences, could suggest that the narrator is struggling to get their words out, or is trying to not reveal how hurt they really are.\n\nWhy do you think Duffy uses simplistic, monosyllabic language in 'Mean Time'? What emotion and tone do you think it creates?\n\nPersonification\n\nThe personification of time is a key device in the poem. By bringing the abstract noun of time to life, the narrator makes it the antagonist of their love story, the source of their troubles. In the first stanza, the narrator says:\n\nThe clocks slid back an hour and stole light from my life\n\nIt is likely that they are referring to the clocks going back in the United Kingdom each October, causing the daylight hours to end earlier. However, by personifying 'the clocks', the narrator places the blame for this change on time itself. It is the clocks who have 'slid back an hour' and they who have 'stole light' from their life. The verb 'stole' frames time as a criminal who has selfishly taken something from the narrator.\n\nThe imagery and tone of ‘Mean Time’ by Carol Ann Duffy\n\nLet's explore the use of imagery and tone in the poem.\n\nImagery\n\nThe imagery focuses on darkness and endings.\n\nDarkness\n\nA semantic field of darkness is evident in the poem; 'bleak', 'gnaw', 'dead', 'beyond all light', 'mourning', 'nights' and 'darkening'. This semantic field contributes to the poem's melancholic mood, creating a sense of hopelessness, as though the narrator can not bear to see the positive things in life anymore.\n\nThe bleak imagery underpins the grief and despair the author feels regarding the failure of the relationship.\n\nSemantic field: a collection of words with similar meanings or connotations.\n\nEndings\n\nThe poem’s narrative has a strong sense of finality to it, underpinned by Duffy’s use of regular stanzas and end-stopped lines, preventing the poem from flowing in a completely natural manner. The imagery associated with endings (‘unmendable rain’, ‘we will be dead’, ‘endless nights’) contributes to it.\n\nThe line ‘unmendable rain’ is particularly effective at expressing this sense of finality. The rain is not something that we usually try to fix yet, to the narrator, everything feels so wrong after the ending of their relationship that even the rain itself appears to be a problem they can't solve. The negative connotations of rain emphasise this, although the narrator may want to escape or mend the wet weather, they are unable to, paralleling how they may feel about being unable to mend their relationship.\n\nTone\n\nThere is an overarching pessimistic tone in the poem with elements of regret and resignation. The pessimistic tone of the poem is produced through Duffy’s use of blunt, monosyllabic language. The dominance of monosyllabic words creates an almost empty rhythm, as though the narrator can not bring themselves to express their feelings to a great extent.\n\nThe pessimistic tone can be divided into two parts: at first, the narrator is regretful, wondering what might have been. However, by the poem's close, the narrator is resigned to ‘the shortened days’ and ‘the endless nights’, accepting the end of their relationship.\n\nThemes in ‘Mean Time’ by Carol Ann Duffy\n\nThe two main themes in the poem are time and loss of love.\n\nTime\n\nTime is the dominant theme in the poem, as highlighted by the title ‘Mean Time’ which most likely relates to Greenwich Mean Time and Daylight Savings.\n\nWhy do you think Duffy introduces time as a theme in the poem's title? Do you think this influences how we read the rest of the poem?\n\nThere is a sense that time is love's enemy, as highlighted by the personification of time in the first stanza:\n\nThe clocks slid back an hour\n\nand stole the light from my life.\n\nHowever, by the poem's close, the narrator is resigned to time’s defeat of love:\n\nBut we will be dead, as we know,\n\nbeyond all light\n\nThe repetition of light at the poem's opening and close, in relation to the theme of time, underpins the poem’s arch from regret to resignation. Time may have stolen the lights from the narrator's life, but they now accept this.\n\nHow else is time presented in the poem? Is time just the enemy of love or could it represent something else?\n\nLoss of love\n\nRomantic love, as with many of Duffy’s poems, is prevalent in ‘Mean Time’. However, the dominant theme is the loss of this romantic love. A sense of loss emerges in the first stanza through the use of the verb 'mourning'. The association of 'mourning' with death and the loss of a person highlights the narrator's feeling that they no longer have the love of another and must now take the time to mourn its loss.\n\nThe emptiness of losing love is further emphasised by Duffy’s use of personification in the poem's second stanza:\n\nWhere I felt my heart gnaw\n\nHere the verb 'gnaw' evokes imagery associated with hunger and desperation, as though the heart is chewing on the final few scraps of the couple's mistakes, trying to work out what went wrong.\n\nThis theme of a loss of love contributes to the poem’s pessimistic tone. The narrator doesn't ponder on happy memories. Instead, they are overwhelmed by the regret and realisation that their relationship has come to an end.\n\nMean Time - Key takeaways\n\n'Mean Time' is a poem written by Carol Ann Duffy which is part of her 1993 poetry anthology of the same name.\n\nThe poem is written in free-verse and is made up of four quatrains.\n\nThe poem explores the lasting impact of lost love and contains a pessimistic tone as the narrator deals with the ending of their relationship.\n\nThe key themes of the poem are time and loss of love.\n\nDarkness and endings are both used as imagery in the poem."
