        "text": "Context of the poem + Duffy’s intentions\n\nSecond last poem of anthology ⇒ little red grown up, with her own money.\n\nBased off beauty and the beast, a well-known, traditional fairytale – value inward characteristics such as kindness over outward appearances\n\nSubverts the story of Beauty and the Beast to suggest that Belle was as objectifying as any other princes ⇒ a sarcastic, satirical, gruesome and different tone to Belle\n\nThe poem has a colloquial tone, voice is assertive, dominant\n\nSpicy points\n\nFind a man that loves you more than you love him or prioritize yourself over any man, confidence will get you what you need\n\nPoint Explanation Historical oppression of women Semantic field of famous women\n\nExtremely beautiful “Helen, Cleopatra, Juliet’s” “Mona Lisa’s” ⇒ list of women that Duffy hasn’t been able to deal with\n\nThey are beautiful = intertextual reference to these legends/myths and Belle’s story as the “beauty”\n\nBuilds up a sense of familiarity in the reader\n\nBuilds confidence in the women, they believe they are beautiful\n\nCrescendo, build up to add dramatic effect\n\nAll these females are subject to the judgements of society ⇒ DON’T follow their footsteps\n\nGraphic imagery\n\nLittle mermaid\n\nSibilance “slit, silver, stinking, salt” ⇒ sinister, painful nature, suffering for a man\n\nContrast with “smiled, waltzed” ⇒ positive, elegant imagery\n\nPoor treatment from men “chuck, throw her” ⇒ like a dead body or animal, betrayal, harsh “Ch” “Thh” sounds\n\nSubverts the story of the Little Mermaid in a few lines, she’s sacrificed her life for a husband only to be dumped\n\nA nice way to end the book\n\nAll these “legends, fairytales” ⇒ culmination of everything in Anthology, self-referential\n\nBelle’s way of empowerment (+ subversion of the real story) References to sex\n\nEnjambment from 1st to 2nd stanza\n\n“The sex / Is better” = taking control of her sexuality in an aggressive manner, also being superficial + hypocritical (a bit like LRC, Salome – using men as a means, not an end) ⇒ using men to satiate herself\n\nVisual pause after the “sex” to create emphasis, but the run-on line emphasizes “better” ⇒ reinforcing the idea that there is a criteria that she judges men on\n\nIntertextual reference “I came to the House of the Beast” unlike LRC, where the wolf draws her into the woods\n\nShe seeks the male, she is the initiator/makes the first move ⇒ knows exactly what she wants\n\nFurther emphasized by the contrast of “no longer a girl” and LRC’s childlike naivety\n\nIndependence from males\n\n“I’ll put them straight” → take matters into my own hands, position of authority. Prominent use of personal pronouns “I” and “My”\n\n“My own gold” ⇒ another reference to LRC, where Gold = books in the Wolf’s lair\n\nFinancial independence, what happens in modern-day society, feminist movement advocates for this\n\nGold ⇒ rich, fairytale connotations\n\n“My own black horse” ⇒ parallelism of “my own” shows her autonomy, freedom, liberty to go wherever she likes. Unlike Pygmalion’s Bride ⇒ trapped\n\nOne wrong word ⇒ could carry her off, STARK contrast with the sexual, physical and verbal abuse that the Bride feels\n\nConfidence\n\n“One false move, one dirty look.” ⇒ cautious, relentless, unforgiving, cut and dry. Control of her own destiny\n\n“The year of my birth” ⇒ she does not care what society thinks about her age, free/liberated from societal forces and expectations\n\nRich and powerful symbol by naming the wine\n\nShows what women had to endure Characterisation of Beast and their relationship Her superficiality and obsession with Beast’s sexual\n\n“Good” “Better” “Best” interjections with parenthesis ⇒ natural, honest, down-to-earth train of thought\n\nConstant assessment of him\n\nHere Duffy makes a point about how women are always being judged and assessed, for their looks, intelligence, motherhood\n\nIt is more important that he has a large sexual organ than his personality and relationship with her\n\nPut a man in the shoes of a woman ⇒ is this a world that Duffy would like to see?\n\n1. Shows how men are superficial\n\n2. Idealizes a matriarchal society\n\nBeast’s subservience\n\n“Stripped of his shirt” ⇒ forcibly, active verb, out of control, aggressive and non-consensual nature\n\nMuslin – innocent, light, soft clothing which is paradoxical to the harsh “Strip” action\n\n“Do this. Harder. Do that. Faster” ⇒ imperatives, choppy, short syntax through caesura, shows her dominance, assertiveness, confidence, instructiveness, all for herself, her own pleasure, irregardless of how Beast feels\n\nCompletely lost his dignity when he uses “tongue to scour” her toes = servant\n\nMASOCHISTIC nature of Belle “scratch back till it bled” ⇒ she’s not feminine at all, not over sensitive or fragile, she’s exactly like a man\n\nAnimalistic presentation of the Beast\n\n“Breath of a goat”\n\n“Snout and trotters”\n\nUnimportant, objectified, piece of meat to be enjoyed, captive animal (a pet!)\n\n“Dog, donkey, dragon” ⇒ alliteration of d, clumsy, unrefined sounds, untamed\n\nTriplet to reiterate how he is incomprehensible, unintelligent, of low status\n\nDogs are domestic, obedient, submissive\n\nPrimitive"
