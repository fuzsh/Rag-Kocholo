        "text": "Poem: Never Go Back\n\nThe meaning of the poem:\n\nNever go back appears to be a poem telling a story of a persona who has returned to their hometown in order to clear up a house that they once lived in. The house appears to be metaphorical for the destruction and decay of a once happy marriage. Unhappiness is an endemic feeling throughout the poem and the reality is that the person leaves the town and seems to be relieved that it is over and that they are able to return to their new life and leave behind the unhappiness and the misery that they once felt.\n\nQuote 1:\n\n“living dead drink all day” uses plosive sounds to reinforce the futility of the pursuit of happiness at the bottom of a glass of alcohol. This opening line uses a metaphor to compare the people in the pub to zombbified creatures who have little to no purpose in their lives, eliciting sympathy for them, in a pitying way. However, the juxtaposing imagery of “living dead” shows that they do actually have a life and perhaps this is their choice and they are satisfied with this half-life standing in a pub drinking. There is a real sense of judgement from the persona for the choices that these nameless people have made in their lives, although they are nameless and faceless and could be reflective of any bar in any town, where people who have little emotional comfort in their lives take refuge, or where alcoholics go to get a fix. It is a thoroughly depressing opening line, which supports the depressing tone of the rest of the poem.\n\nQuote 2:\n\n“Outside, the streets tear litter in their thin hands,” personifies the streets in a way that makes them seem like they are wringing their hands in despair. This imagery gives the impression of a dirty, downtrodden and hopeless sort of area, which again could be anywhere and implies that the people of the town have given up caring for the environment that they live in. Again, the negativity if rife in the stanza and this first line creates a sense of despair and helplessness, which radiates through the people and the town. Once more, the persona is commenting on how terrible everything appears here.\n\nQuote 3:\n\n“The house where you were one of the brides has cancer.” Uses enjambment to reinforce the negativity in the disease that is metaphorically personifying the house into a someone. It could be an indication of the marriage itself as the word “bride” connotes youth and hopefulness, but this juxtaposes the actual reality of the cancerous growth that the house is presented with. It suggests that this was a past tense occurrence and that it happened previously. It is indicative that the persona is reflecting on a time before, where they were unhappy, when love perhaps had soured and created a misery in their soul.\n\nQuote 4:\n\n“A taxi implying a hearse” shows that metaphorically leaving the town and the house and the relationship is like a death in itself. The ‘implying’ is tentative and shows that this is not a real death, maybe more of an ending or closure from the past. Although the imagery is very negative here, there is a sense that leaving is the right thing to do and it gives a sense of release for the persona.\n\nQuote 5:\n\nForget. Already the fires and lights come on wherever you live” In the final metaphor here we are treated to a sense of finality and relief and forgetting of the past, as if by leaving the town the persona is able to breathe and be themselves again. Although there is a real sense of sadness, this fades quickly when the persona is removed from the physical reminders of a previous bad time. Duffy reinforces many of the stereotypes of relationships gone wrong and beautifully and skilfully encapsulates the range of emotions that the persona would feel when the end has happened and moving on in life has to happen.\n\nStructure of the poem:\n\nDuffy uses a lot of enjambment throughout with short sentences, which creates a stilted experience when reading the poem and perhaps this is a purposeful structural device to show the ebb and flow of memory. Sometimes, the memories are sharp, quick and painful reinforced in the short sentences and sometimes they need time to be aired in the longer more complex sentences and the use of enjambment. Furthermore, the poem has 6 long stanzas which imply that time to process the complexity of the issues and thoughts and feelings of the persona are needed.\n\nDuffy’s Intentions:\n\nShe seems to be exploring the break of a relationship and processing the feelings that this creates, in a realistic but raw way. Perhaps, she intended to reinforce how difficult it is to break up, but that life does move on and these feelings can be transient, but felt deeply at the time.\n\nContext/Critics:\n\nDuffy has experienced a break up of a relationship after a long time, so perhaps this is reflecting on that experience or her understanding as a women of the feelings and loss that occurs when breaking up with a partner. One critic has suggested that “Duffy uses everyday language to bring difficult issues to the forefront” and this is certainly true of Never Go Back, with even the name suggesting that the poem will hold painful emotions and a sense of regret at returning and reflecting on the past.\n\nPoem Name: Stuffed by Duffy\n\nOverview: This poem is a dramatic monologue written in the voice of a taxidermist, the poem starts with the persona talking about animals in an overly controlling manner and slowly builds up to show the personas disturbing view of male domination on woman, the taxidermist talks about non-living animals, who are moulded and shaped to the taxidermists liking, comparing this to humans, and how the same concept can be applied to them. The taxidermist spends his life stuffing dead animals and likes his partners to be as passive as the animals being stuffed.\n\nQuote 1: All references to the man are framed in terms of the self-obsessed “I” of the persona, which has been repeated eleven times within this poem, the repetition of the word “I” suggests a possessive and controlling behaviour, implying that the persona associates himself with power, and enjoys being in control.\n\nQuote 2: “I fix the grin” from stanza one. The term “I” is used again here, suggesting the power that the taxidermist has over the animals, and how he considers himself. “fix” is suggesting the persona enjoys having power over the animals and liking the control that he gets from this. However, it could also be suggesting possessive behaviour, and how the taxidermist reflects this onto woman.\n\nQuote 3: From stanza two, “red rag to a bull”. A red rag can be used make a bull angry and violent, suggesting that by giving a bull a “red rag’’ the taxidermist is taunting the bull, making it angry, even when the bull is unresponsive, and not alive. This quote can also imply that the taxidermist enjoys manipulating the bull, wanting to have full control.\n\nQuote 4: “I like her”, in the last stanza, where the persona starts to talk about woman in the same way as he does with animals, using a sinister and impersonal tone. “I” is again very possessive, suggesting that he feels as if he owns what he’s referring to. “her” is implying that the taxidermist sees this as very impersonal, in a disturbing and overly sexual tone.\n\nQuote 5: In the last stanza, “motionless” is suggesting sexual control and domination over woman, as the persona has when he’s stuffing animals. It however can also suggest possession over an object, as the persona seems to see woman and dead animals as similar objects, being impersonal to them, and controlling.\n\nStructure of the poem: The structure is slightly formal, reflecting the control that taxidermist likes to have. The poem has four stanzas, structured in the same way. The stanzas each have three lines, which is very controlled and structure, similarly to the way that he has control on the animals. The stanzas are kept very limited as if to not give too much away, with a repetitive structure.\n\nWriters’ Intentions: Duffy may have intended to highlight domestic abuse and domination, as well as the objectification and sexualisation of a woman in a broken society. She may have intended to bring focus onto this, exploring it with different ideas, looking at how a person’s real intentions can be hidden.\n\nPoem Name: Disgrace by Duffy\n\nOverview of the Meaning: A poem which deals with the death of a relationship. The decaying relationship is personified through the state of the house, which reflects the nature of their relationship through images of detrition and death. Furthermore, it shows a representation of things left incomplete and abandoned which portrays a lack of connection, as well as a sense of longing for what the relationship once was. The poem overall captures a routine between a husband and wife that is spiralling towards nothingness.\n\nQuote 1: Duffy describes the “coldness of the rooms” to metaphorically suggest that there is no love or warmth in this relationship anymore with both of their hearts having hardened towards one another. Furthermore, Duffy using the house to reflect the loveless attitudes in the relationship strongly highlights how dysfunctional it is. The very reason of having a house is for shelter and warmth, with both the house and the relationship failing to serve their purposes portraying them as meaningless.\n\nQuote 2: The short, abrupt sentence in the fourth stanza, “Woke” sharply contrasts the slow moving pace of the poem and could show the speakers sudden realisation of the deterioration of their relationship. An alternate view could suggest that the sharpness of the verb could reflect the pain the persona feels of having to face the reality of her life as she awakens.\n\nQuote 3: “rotten to the core” metaphorically talking about the relationship being past the point of saving as it is completing destroyed. Just like apples were once a form of life growing, the relationship was once something beautiful which has now been destroyed. Furthermore, the uselessness of the apples now they are “rotten” could reflect Duffys views on how a loveless relationship is not worth having, just as a rotten apple is not worth eating.\n\nQuote 4: “Dead flies in a web” captures the true petrification of their relationship. With Duffys use of the noun “dead” continuing the hopeless feeling as the imagery does not portray the persona as fighting to free herself from the web of her relationship, but as already lost.\n\nQuote 5: “stiffened and blackened” This quote shows the impurity and contamination of the relationship, hinting at the unfaithfulness and deceit hidden between them. This quote further implies how the decay of their relationship was a gradual process, slowly happening over time as the couple aged, with Duffys use of the noun “stiffened” reflecting the signs of getting older on their joints. Overall capturing the process of years of lies building up and turning the relationship sour and bleak.\n\nExplain the structure of the poem:\n\nThere are 8 quatrains in the poem which create a very firm and clear repetitive pattern, reflecting the fact that there is no change or improvement in the personas relationship which is very routine based. The relationship is no longer built on love but is still functioning through years of repeated actions in an endless loveless cycle.\n\nFurthermore, there is enjambment placed throughout the poem creating a slower reading pace, which could show the lack of excitement in the relationship, perhaps the daily routines seems to get harder and harder to maintain each day and yet the persona has no will to end the cycle or break free of the relationship.\n\nWriters’ Intentions:\n\nDuffy may have written this poem to highlight the view that a couple must have a strong foundation to maintain a relationship and perhaps as a warning that within a relationship, actions have consequences. With every deceit and lie you further yourself from the person you love, and so she may have wanted people not to take their relationships for granted.\n\nPoem name:\n\nThe Windows\n\nOverview of the meaning:\n\nThe poem is about a persona who seems to feel lonely and isolated looking in on a life that is seemingly perfect and out of reach for them. ‘The Windows’ are symbolic of the emotional isolation they are experiencing because they are physically separating them from happiness.\n\nQuote 1:\n\n“How do you earn a life going on behind yellow windows…?” The rhetorical question in the first stanza immediately sets the persona up as feeling insecure and somewhat unsatisfied in their life as there is a tone of jealousy in this line. The word “earn” is particularly effective because it suggests the persona doesn’t feel as if they deserve that kind of life yet. The connotations of “yellow windows” are also important because “yellow” suggests a positive image being created whereas “windows” suggests a slightly voyeuristic view of the persona looking in. Alternatively, it could be Duffy suggesting that when looking in on someone else’s life you are only seeing part of the picture.\n\nQuote 2:\n\n“Those who love you forgive you, clearly” The tone of jealousy continues in this line as the persona seems envious of the closeness that the couple/family through the windows share. The earlier suggestion that the persona may only be seeing part of the picture is reinforced here with “clearly” as they start to presume that they know all about the family’s life from the small amount that they can see.\n\nQuote 3:\n\n“What you see what you smell what you taste…stranger passing your gate” Synaesthesia is used here to create a sense of the persona’s confusion which is reinforced by the use of listing. The use of the pronoun “you” is also effective as it makes it seem as if the persona is imagining what it would be like to be on the other side of the windows. The last line “stranger passing your gate” seems to be from an outside perspective and evokes empathy from the reader that the stranger is still an outsider.\n\nQuote 4:\n\n“Right words wait in the dictionaries…tip of your tongue you touch in a kiss” The first part of this quote suggests that this family are intellectual which may be a further source of jealousy for the persona. Alternatively, it could feed into a personal insecurity about saying the wrong thing so the persona feels that these people must have the “right words” because they appear to have it all together. The poem becomes slightly more voyeuristic as the persona watches as the couples “tongue(S) you touch in a kiss” and it becomes slightly uncomfortable as a reader to know that they are being watched. The use of “again” throughout the poem also suggests they do this often or for long periods of time which makes the persona seem obsessive or even creepy at this point.\n\nQuote 5:\n\n“Against dark hours…such vivid flowers.” The first line is slightly foreboding and continues the idea that the persona is becoming obsessive towards this family. Alternatively, it also suggests the time/ how long they’ve been there which could link to their obsessive nature. The last line “Such vivid flowers.” Seems to be the persona savouring the memory of the house and what they can remember after they have left the windows – because the flowers were “vivid” they have stuck out to the persona which could be comparable to the memory of the family. The flowers could serve as a metaphor for the family.\n\nExplain the structure of the poem:\n\nThe poem is made up of 5 stanzas and each are 4 lines each. The regular structure is fairly ordinary and nondescript which may resemble the persona’s state of mind.\n\nWriter’s intentions:\n\nDuffy may have intended to portray the insecurity that society as a whole is taught to disguise. The persona is somewhat hidden and voyeuristic which furthers this message that we hide our insecurities. By writing this poem Duffy is contradicting the social expectations and unwritten rules.\n\nPoem Name: Valentine by Duffy\n\nMeaning: Valentine is a realistic interpretation of love and the journey taken throughout a relationship. Duffy tries to challenge the traditional ideas and commercialisation of love whilst following a non-linear structure to try and highlight how everyone’s experience with love and relationships is different.\n\nQuote 1: “it is a moon”\n\nThe quote is celestial imagery, the moon is inconstant and doesn’t provide its own light due to its reliance on the sun. Therefore is only temporary and could portray an idea that the love presented in Valentine is also inconsistent.\n\nQuote 2: “I give you an onion”\n\nThis is repeated twice. The use of an onion as a valentine gift could be to highlight realism and that relationships involve deeper levels or layers like onions have.\n\nContext: Duffy is a lesbian and the first open LGBT poet Laureate, she isn’t following the same path and being realistic about love and the gift of an onion\n\nQuote 3: “it will make your reflection a wobbling photo of grief”\n\nImplies crying due to the relationship. Onions, when being chopped normally make you cry which could link to grief. “Wobbling” distorted view of life and could also imply that love is unclear and confusing. Structurally, this stanza is more about pain and emotion rather than the calm and careful theme of the previous stanza.\n\nContext: Duffy was a very private person. The personal sense of this quote is a deeper insight into the poet. Alternatively the quote could be a result of the crying reflect from chopping onions.\n\nCritic: “she has the ability to express powerful emotions in detached ‘everyday’ language” Simon Brittan. Duffy is articulating the common feelings associated with love and relationships in a realistic, yet powerful way.\n\nQuote 4: “its fierce kiss will stay on your lips, possessive and faithful”\n\nHighlights how a lover can stay with you or their memory will always be with you. The juxtaposition of “possessive and faithful” could imply that relationships bring out the best and the worse in you. The angry tone makes the poem realistic as it is addressing how it is normal for relationships not to be perfect.\n\nContext: Duffy is a strong feminist. Looking at equality and realism within the poem Valentine.\n\nCritic: “powerful modern voice” Jeanette Winterson, highlights the influence Duffys poetry will have. Links to the adjective “fierce” as it shows the poets “power” through her language.\n\nQuote 5: “Lethal” “cling to your knife”\n\nA single, short sentence. Could represent danger and power which opposes the calm and caring nature of the persona in the first stanza. This illustrates the progression of a relationship. Also the “knife” could refer to the innocence of slicing onions or alternatively suggesting danger with a tone of violence\n\nContext: The violence in the poem Valentine could have been influenced by the racist backlash and violence in the 1980s due to the arrival of a large immigrant population arriving. Duffy would have seen here that conflict is common and is even present in relationships.\n\nStructure: The stanzas in the poem present a journey of emotions about love from calm and careful to pain, to anger then finally to violence. The single line quotes could represent the reflection of the relationship, rather than the poem being one single steam on consciousness, therefore supporting how Duffy is keen on being realistic about love and relationships. As well as this, the non-linear structure might be emphasising how love and experiences with love is different for everyone.\n\nWriter’s intentions: To be realistic about love and relationships. Highlights the idea that nothing will ever be perfect but, it will do.\n\nPoem name: Room\n\nOverview of meaning: Duffy uses imagery to create this bleak nature in the poem. The title demonstrates a feeling of confinement, however could illustrate the mental space of the persona.\n\nQuote 1: ‘One chair to sit in’ – portrays dissatisfaction. The persona feels lonely and isolated as if they are the social outcast. By registering that there is only ‘one chair’ in the room perhaps metaphorically insinuates there has been a loss of a relationship and the persona has been forced to live elsewhere. This is reinforced as only singular objects are mentioned in the room. This also highlights the alienation and solitude that the persona is experiencing from being alone.\n\nQuote 2: ‘a cool light bulb waiting for a moth’ – emphasises the emptiness and coldness of the room, that it has been uninhabited for a while. Could be seen as oxymoronic as lightbulbs typically give off heat. However, it could be indicated as a metaphor for the effect the light is diffusing. By describing the light as ‘cool’, Duffy advocates it gives off a harsh straining light, instead of a soothing and warm one. The lightbulb is personified to be ‘waiting for a moth’ which amplifies the negativity of waiting for something bad to happen. By using the tone ‘waiting’ for the death of the moth, Duffy perhaps puts forward an understanding that the persona knows that danger is ahead and that something negative is going to happen shortly. Regardless, an idea could also be put forward that the persona is waiting for the attention of another being –just like the empty bulb is waiting for a moth- as they are so lonely and trying to lose the feeling of loss. It perhaps highlights the passing of time for the persona, they are waiting for something else to happen in their life.\n\nQuote 3: ‘Room.’ – repeated several times as a single sentence. This contrasts with the long sentence in the previous line of the last stanza. The single word sentence could demonstrate the persona jumping back into reality. In the previous stanza, there are personified details about the terrace houses stretching out, metaphorically described months passing by. This could indicate that the persona is losing track of time, anyhow on the next line they snap back to reality by readjusting to their surroundings and the situation they are in by stating the noun ‘room’. This reflects the hostility of the place they are in, it also gives the reader an understanding of the emptiness and hollowness of the place as it is not given a personal name which the persona may feel a connection to. Regardless, it reflects an impersonal and unrecognisable space where the persona feels disconnected from.\n\nQuote 4: ‘a face takes off its glasses and stares out again’ – this evidently proposes that the persona can barely recognise themselves in their reflection. As the persona is merely portrayed as ‘a face’, the lack of personal pronouns indicates that the persona has forgotten who they are, which signifies a sense of loss as if they have failed to do something in their past or regretted an action. The point of no recognition is further exhibited when the persona is described as ‘its’, this gives connotations of objectification as the persona is described as a non-living object. This gives the reader a feeling of pity towards the persona as it is understood how alienated and sorrowful they feel. The impersonal pronouns could perhaps highlight the feeling of self-loathing the persona has for themselves as they regret the past events that occurred.\n\nQuote 5: ‘the giftless moon’ – metaphorically conveys that the moon has nothing to give, that there is no hope. The moon is often used as a symbol as hope, so stating that the moon is ‘giftless’ proposes that there is no hopefulness to be given, perhaps the persona committed something serious and does not deserve hope. The persona could be looking out for the moon in hope to be forgiven for their actions. The ‘moon’ could have connotations of another day passing, indicating that fate has no remorse towards the persona. It also advocates how quickly time is slipping away, that perhaps the persona is losing time.\n\nStructure of poem:\n\nThe poem has a total of four stanzas, each with three lines. The lines increase in length as the stanza progresses, which could perhaps reveal the increase of desperation of the persona as they become more and more secluded and left with their own thoughts.\n\nWriters intentions:\n\nDuffy may be trying to show in this poem that these events could happen to anyone, it is not shown in the poem if the persona is male or female which could reiterate that the persona represents anyone who has gone through a difficult past. Duffy is trying to portray that anyone can feel isolated and lonely at times.\n\nThe Biographer Poem Overview\n\nSummary of poem: The Biographer is narrated in the first person by a fan of Charles Dickens, who is commissioned to write a biography of the author. They display an arguably unhealthy obsession for him and tries to get as close to him as they can despite it harming and changing their life.\n\nQuote 1: “Because you are dead…caressing” As the opening line of the poem, this is very effective because it is very forward about the death of a figure the persona admires. There is also a slightly twisted vibe to it which is emphasised by the word “caressing”, almost as though they are taking advantage of his death in a somewhat indecent way due to the erotic connotations of “caressing”. This is further heightened by the fact the persona is addressing Dickens. There is almost a sense of power play, as though the narrator would have had less interaction with Dickens had he been alive.\n\nQuote 2: “I’m a passionate man with a big advance” This makes it sound as though the narrator is pitching them self to Dickens, one could interpret irony because of how he refers to himself as a “passionate man” but fails to recognise how extreme his passion is. The “big advance” hints how later in the poem the narrator sort of sells them self to Dickens and becomes desperate.\n\nQuote 3: “I felt your dislike chilling the air” This pathetic fallacy implies they have had a realisation and have woken up to a self-disgust after sleeping in Dicken’s bed. The cold increases the drama of this realisation and also makes it almost self-indulgent as they continue to push feelings onto a dead person. This addressing of Dickens could also portray a mental instability or a lack of grip on reality; the persona frequently reflects on Dicken’s reactions to their actions as though they are trying to live up to him and win his respect.\n\nQuote 4: “How close can I get to the sound of your voice” This has double meaning; the persona could be mimicking him or trying to listen to accounts of his voice. This could create a sense of sadness as well as a sickening feeling towards the persona depending on how it is interpreted.\n\nQuote 5: “Dustjacket smile” This is near the end of the poem, which creates a sense of dissatisfaction after the journey the persona has gone through. After hunting for the essence of Dickens, even down to having an affair like him, the persona does not feel proud of the biography he has now published. The “dustjacket” creates a sense of age, emphasising the persona’s feelings of insignificance as though they have lost themselves along the way. This makes the smile seem generic or fake and makes the biography seem unsuccessful, as though Dicken’s work is outdated and the person is the only one who still appreciates it. There is also a sense that the process of making the book has exorcised the narrator’s passion, creating a rather blue tone.\n\nContext: This poem could be seen as Duffy paying homage to Dickens and displaying respect for his work. It could also be interpreted as a message about fame; Duffy values privacy and perhaps is trying to say that while Dicken’s writing was good, his lifestyle may not be something to respect as she displayed blind faith in this role model as destructive.\n\nCritics: “There is a persistent sense that love involves as much suffering as it does joy”- Preston\n\n“Examines love in many forms”- Adam O’ Riordan\n\n“The ability to express powerful emotions in detached everyday language” – Brittan\n\nPoem name: Fraud\n\nOverview: The poem is about a man, previously called Jon Ludwick Hock, who lost his family to the Nazi holocaust and moved to the UK after serving in the Army, changing his name to Robert Maxwell. He became an MP and steadily built a media empire through buying big businesses. After leading a luxurious but controversial life, he was found drowned after falling from his yacht. Mystery surrounds his death and, afterwards, it was discovered than he had stolen hundreds of millions of pounds from his company’s pension funds. The poem explores crime, class and how such a life should be remembered.\n\nQuote 1: ‘politicians in-and-out of their pram’ the use of plosives here creates a fast pace, perhaps inferring that the persona views politics and power as a game because of the controversial topics being discussed in child-like rhyme. The ‘pram’ image suggests a kind of arrogance or disillusion as the persona can see how politicians fluctuate between innocence and guilt, a ‘pram’ is something used by children which suggests that Maxwell feels superior to them. Effect- adds to the rhythm of the poem and highlights the manipulative nature of the persona.\n\nQuote 2: ‘Him – for whom I paid for a butch and femme’ uses the capital as a collective pronoun for anyone who can be bought and paid in order to gain power. This sinisterly objective language is furthered with ‘butch and femme’ as they are terms used in gay subculture to ascribe different traits to lesbians. Effect- the underhand behaviour is shown to be offhand and creates an uneasily crude tone.\n\nQuote 3: ‘turning their wide blind eyes to crime’ has an interesting word order as ‘wide’ connotes shock or innocence while ‘blind’ could mean that the people are either ignoring crime or do not see it in the same way as Maxwell. This could link to his background as he has become disillusioned and bitter, perhaps. Effect- it could be that Maxwell feels a sense of superiority because he exploits and uses crime for his own means while others ignore it until it benefits them. The adjectives add to the sense of corruption and questioning of innocence.\n\nQuote 4: ‘polaroids of a Night of Shame. . .Boy’ the reference to blackmail or the culture within tabloids links to homosexual prostitution with the capitals in ‘Night of Shame’ could show the importance of the event for Maxwell to get what he wants. To add to the corruption, ‘boy’ is suggestive of paedophilia. Effect- The people benefitting from his crimes are no better than him, the crimes in the poem grow in severity as the poem goes on as well as the rhyme which could highlight the spiral of crime that grows in momentum and the sacrifice that comes with power or wealth.\n\nQuote 5: ‘I could have replied with a dream’ highlights Maxwells’ past while suggesting conflict as a ‘dream’ connotes a sense of peacefulness but the reply is referring to his drowning. Furthermore, the caesura used creates a pause in the rhyme and separation. Effect- the poem could be highlighting a moral as Maxwells’ building crimes end in his death. The pause could mean that the last section of the stanza is where the most truth is, highlighted in ‘I gargled my name’ as it is like a confession that questions character.\n\nStructure: the poem becomes more rhythmic throughout which creates a fast pace, reflecting the spiral of crime and the building of power. Some may suggest that the structure of the stanzas are reminiscent of the sea which foreshadows the personas’ drowning.\n\nWriters’ intentions: Duffy could be using Maxwell as a persona to show how crime becomes a spiral and starts with smaller crimes. The rhyming and moral element of the poem also reflect how by committing such unethical acts, one can lose themselves in the pursuit of power and wealth.\n\nPoem: The Suicide\n\nOverview of the meaning: This poem is about the contemplation and idolisation of suicide, hinting that this is not a genuine suicide attempt, but more a cry for help/attention.\n\nQuote 1: “bitter moon buffed by the smudgy clouds”- This stream of thought demonstrates the personas inability to stop their mind from entering a darker place, with the idea of the “moon” being a powerful force in which they aspire to reach. This control and power can be achieved by suicide, being used as a wider metaphor to show the length in which they will go. The use of enjambment of the line emphasises this continuous consciousness, resembling the journey in which the persona is embarking, to find self-fulfilment. By describing the moon as bitter, it could show a darker side to the light, and how things are not always as good as they first appear, linking to the suicidal ideals.\n\nQuote 2: “My body is a blank page I will write on”- This metaphor could be a reference to self-harm; being unsatisfied with their plain appearance and craving something more substantial. Some readers may argue that they are making their thoughts visible for everyone to see, indicating that the act could be for attention, leaving the reader questioning what it is that the persona will write on their body. It also links back to the idea of self-control, with the verb “will” showing their determination to keep to their word. Duffy could have used this sombre line to be interpreted in a number of ways, yet ultimately still linking back to the theme of suicide.\n\nQuote 3: “Despair laced with a little glee”- The persona is facing up to the feelings of others, highlighting the “despair” which will be felt by such a tragic act, yet still contradicts this with their own feelings, identifying the “glee” that will be felt, which is often achieved my another’s misfortune, such as the personas family members. This also identifies some hope in the act, by developing an emotion that is not shown throughout the rest of the poem.\n\nQuote 4: “Utterly selfless”- This contradicts society’s view of suicide, which identifies the sense of separation that the persona has from those around them, which could be an explanation for the dark thoughts they are experiencing. By describing suicide as “selfless”, the persona is clearly naïve to the devastation that suicide has, with the line being separated with no punctuation in order to allow a more personal interpretation of the quote.\n\nQuote 5: “This will kill my folks”- This line is located at the end of the poem, separated as its own stanza, highlighting the poignant meaning of these final words, acting as the last thought that they had. This juxtaposes the previous idea of suicide being “utterly selfless” as the persona is finally contemplating the effect it will have on their parents. However, their sureness in the pain that their family will feel appears to be exaggerated in such a way that is uncommon for those thinking about suicide, as often they believe committing suicide will be better for everyone, linking back to the idea of this being a cry for help rather than a genuine attempt to kill themselves.\n\nExplain the structure of the poem: The irregular structure uses a range of small stanzas and short sentences consisting of a few words in order to resemble the almost sporadic mind of the persona, in the sense that their contradictive confusion is shown by the structure. The lack of caesura shows their stream of thought, with juxtaposition being used in order to support this.\n\nWriters’ Intentions: Duffy uses this poem to portray the other side of suicide, using a persona who feels a sense of self-pride in the consideration of committing such an act that could be detrimental to the health of those around them. By contradicting society’s expectations, Duffy is able to educate her readers that not all suicide calls are genuine, yet it is almost impossible for people to see these differences unless they are in the personas mind."
