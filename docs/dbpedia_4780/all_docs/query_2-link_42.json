        "text": "Explain the way in which Duffy presents the strengths and limitations of language in two poems.\n\nWhen drawing from both 'Warming Her Pearls' and 'Selling Manhattan' , it is evident that Carol Anne Duffy maintains a certain avant-garde approach to the vast array of possibilities that language presents.\n\nShe acutely exposes the ambiguity that language holds in its meanings, presenting the reader with endless connotations to consider. Duffy also draws attention to its inability to fully express the extent of human emotions.\n\nBoth of the above stated poems focus on societal and cultural stratification, with Duffy's use of language carefully designed to emphasise the distance between different social groups. 'Selling\n\nManhattan' …show more content…\n\nWhile Duffy again has used the word 'I', the context of the language in which it is employed consequently generates a distance from Minuit. While the colonist clearly does not care to consider the feelings of any being other than himself, the very first line of the\n\nIndian embodies the exact opposite. Not only is the Indian seen to\n\n'wonder' about the thoughts of others, more specifically, he is even contemplating how the 'ground' is feeling. This again creates a lucid contrast to the capitalist views of the settler, emphasising the\n\nIndian's value in the natural earth around. The personification that\n\nDuffy has shaped through language for the 'ground' adds human qualities, suggesting that all surroundings are as important as the self, even the ground that we walk upon. The Indian's esteem in valuing, and his general respect for the natural surroundings is echoed again in the first line of his next stanza. Here he wonders about the water's 'spirit'. No language is evident in Peter Minuit's stanza that would suggest a genuine concern for the spirit. Minuit does nevertheless state, 'Praise the Lord', which would at first glance suggest the possession of similar principles and beliefs to the\n\nIndian's interest in the 'spirit'. Minuit's referral to God is however extremely cruel and entirely ironic, with him almost joking about powers beyond his own greedy hands. It is evident that if he did in fact with honesty 'Praise the Lord' that he would not"
