        "text": "This paper intends to examine the use by Carol Ann DufJY (b. 19 55) of the dramatic monologue in order to dramatize the anxieties of foreigners, immigrants, and social misfits in contemporary British society. The paper advances from the premise that DufJY is part of a new &quot;democratic voice, &quot; a term used by some critics to describe the ethnically diverse, contemporary British poets. It contends that, just as she is part of this &quot;democratic voice&quot; (Scottish, female, poet from outside the establishment,) her poetry showcases that &quot;democratic voice,&quot; not only in the &quot;accessibility&quot; of its language but also in the plurality of its speakers who would not have a chance to voice their anxieties except on a democratic platform. Just as she, as a poet, has succeeded to conquer the center-the first woman ever to become Britain&#39;s Poet Laureate in 2009-her marginalized speakers are brought to the center of attention, surprisingly, in the dramatic mono...\n\nSubtlety is the only way wherein feminine rebellion can flourish and succeed in a male dominant society. This paper attempts to show that collaborative feminine effort leads to collective liberty and that Duffy (2002) pays homage to the feminist waves, especially the radical phase. The poet uses laughter as a metaphor to represent the feminist waves that were initially perceived as a joke but culminated in a force that ensured the emancipation of women. Although women's desires are often repressed by the patriarchal machinery that seeks to oppress them, united action leads to liberation. Critics of Duffy have focused on her radical feminist and revisionist themes but this paper will also read the Laughter of Stafford Girls High (2002) as a homage to the various feminist waves that have contributed to women's emancipation discourses globally. The paper draws from Wollstonecraft (1792) whose treatise A Vindication of the Rights of Woman exposed the triviality of women's education and advocated for equality in learning. Although contemporary society enjoys parity in learning, several feminist critics like Howe (1977) and Hooks (1994) insist that there are still hidden messages within curriculums that tactfully ensure the marginal role of women. The absence of women in the canons gives the pervasive feeling that women have contributed nothing to human progress. The paper, therefore, aligns with the idea of feminine writing posited by Cixous (1976) as the only way through which women can write their unique history. From a reading of Duffy (2002) with the aforementioned theoretical leanings, it was realized that spaces of patriarchal brainwashing still abound despite the perceived progressive worldview. Equally, united action is important for the restitution of the rights of all women globally.\n\nIn the twentieth century, traditional stabilities of society, religion and culture seemed to have weakened. While modernity challenged conventional ways of human experience, a change of pace had been accelerating in many aspects of the world. The two world wars, collapses of empires and economic depression caused mass dislocation of populations. Because of the mixing in cultures and classes in rapidly expanding cities, the new era disrupted the old order. People started to question everyday life with the help of technological developments; so with this new awareness, people looked deeply into true nature of things. With this century, the position of women in societies began to change, they were admitted to universities and they acquired to own their properties and to vote. The reflection of these developments is clearly but slowly witnessed in literature. The first part of the century is heavily dominated by male writers and poets; as the period progresses there emerges division between masculine and feminine lines of poetry. Through at the end of the century, finally women’s participation on poetic world is highly recognizable. This period welcomes Carol Ann Duffy who is a member of a multi-cultural society: Irish, Scottish, and Catholic. Her dramatic and feminist monologues bring a breath of fresh air in English language and poetry. For instance, in her poem Medusa, she describes a woman who is in pain and full of jealousy. With the help of creating the speaker in a parodic way of the myth, she still threatens her lover. In her poem Valentine, Duffy shocks her readers with ‘the onion’ as a gift for her beloved. Actually, this unusual object is used as a metaphor for love, which includes her passion, her strong feelings, her pain that eventually she will come up against. Throughout the twentieth century, women have written and published many poems, and they are influenced by various movements and changes, which have a great influence upon modern poetry. This paper aims to give brief information about women poetry in the twentieth century, and to discuss the meaning and significance of Carol Ann Duffy’s work by studying her poems ‘Medusa’ and ‘Valentine’ in terms of the major trends in contemporary British poetry.\n\nThis thesis seeks to argue for the problematising role of tradition and generational influence in the work of three Northern Irish poets publishing since the late 1990s. The subjects, Colette Bryce (b. 1970), Leontia Flynn (b. 1974) and Sinead Morrissey (b. 1972), emerged coterminously, each publishing with major UK publishers. Together they represent a generation of assured female poetic voices. This study presents one of the first critical considerations of the work of these poets, and it remains conscious of the dominance of conceptions of tradition and lineage which are notable in poetry from Northern Ireland from the twentieth-century onwards. In suggesting that this tradition is problematised for emerging women poets by precursor-peer dominance and the primacy of male perspectives in the tradition, this thesis combines a study of poetics, themes relating to gender, detachment and paratexts. From consideration of these elements, it proposes that contemporary poets are not neces..."
