        "text": "Click Log In in the upper right corner of the LALAL.AI site page. After that, you will see a pop-up window where you can register or log in to an existing account via email, Google, or Facebook.\n\nWhen you sign up or sign in via email, you receive a letter from LALAL.AI containing a one-time verification code and a temporary authorization link. Enter the code on the website to access your LALAL.AI account.\n\nNote that the code expires 10 minutes after it is sent by email. If you haven't managed to use the code in that time, you can request a new code or simply click the authorization link in the email. The link will be valid for 24 hours. If you have not used the link within this period, you will need to re-enter your email address on the LALAL.AI website.\n\nAfter you uploaded a file and received stem previews, as a new user you need to sign up to split the entire file and download full stems. Below the stem previews, select one of the options: Starter, Lite or Plus. Then click the Process the Entire File button below the option.\n\nIf you selected the Starter package, you will see the sign-up section. Enter your email or sign up with Google, Apple Id or Facebook.\n\nNote that with the Starter pack you can split up to 10 minutes worth of audio/video and listen to the results, but won’t be able to download them. Get one of the paid packages to unlock the download feature.\n\nIf you selected the Lite or Plus package, you will see the payment methods. Select one of the options and you will be taken to the checkout page.\n\nLALAL.AI packages do not have an expiration date per se. Once you’ve acquired a package, it’s always there until you’ve used all minutes available for splitting.\n\nSay, you’ve bought the 90-minute Lite package and processed 90 minutes worth of audio/video through the service, then you will have to get a new package to split more files. If you’ve bought it and haven’t been using it for several weeks or even months, the package with all its minutes is still available like you’ve purchased it today.\n\nEach LALAL.AI package comes with a limit on how many minutes worth of audio/video are available for splitting. The length of every fully split file is deducted from the package minute limit. You can split as many files as you want as long as their total length doesn’t exceed the minute limit of your package.\n\nFor example, when you get the Starter pack that comes with a 10-minute limit, you can split 10 minutes worth of audio or video in total. So, with this limit, you can split one 10-minute track, two 5-minute tracks, or about three 3-minute tracks.\n\nThere are several stem separation types you can choose from. One separation type is applied at a time, giving you two stems per file. Depending on the selected type, you receive a pair of vocal and instrumental stems, isolated drums + drumless stem, isolated bass + bassless stem, etc.\n\nMinutes are deducted from the account by the following formula:\n\nTotal file length x stem separation type(s) number\n\nExample:\n\nFile length: 5 minutes\n\nSelected separation types: Drums, Piano and Vocal/Instrumental.\n\nTotal number of deducted minutes: 5 minutes x 3 stem separation types = 15 minutes\n\nThe total number of minutes you can spend on splitting stems is displayed at the top right corner of the LALAL.AI main page. Make sure you are logged in to your LALAL.AI account, otherwise you won’t see the minute count.\n\nYou can also see how many available minutes you’ve got left on the previews page. After the file upload, the service gives you the stem previews. Right below the previews you can see how many minutes and seconds the full file separation requires and how many you have at the moment.\n\nHover the cursor over the minute display at the top right corner of the LALAL.AI site, then click Upgrade in the appeared window. Secondly, you can scroll the site page to the pricing section and click on one of the paid options. Thirdly, purchase options are available on the stem previews page you see after your file was uploaded and processed. You can also get minutes for free by becoming our referral partner – join the referral program and receive extra minutes for every invited user.\n\nActivation key is a unique code assigned to each premium user. With its help, you can activate your package on multiple devices/browsers, in the LALAL.AI desktop app, and use our API.\n\nThe key can be found in the profile on the LALAL.AI site (you have to be logged in to get it). It’s also available in your purchase email.\n\nOnce you’ve spent all minute credits of your pack, you need to purchase another pack to continue using premium features.\n\nLALAL.AI’s de-echo feature uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to process audio signals, effectively eliminating echo and reverberation from songs, voice recordings, and vocal tracks.\n\nTo remove echo and reverb from your audio, open the LALAL.AI site. Within the upload section, click the settings icon and enable the De-echo vocals/voice feature in the drop-down menu.\n\nSelect either Vocal and Instrumental or Voice and Noise stem. Then upload your audio or video file in MP3, OGG, WAV, FLAC, AVI, MP4, MKV, AIFF, or AAC formats.\n\nThis feature works in conjunction with LALAL.AI's main stem separation networks (Orion and Phoenix), helping them more precisely identify all the sounds of the stem you selected for separation. Enhanced Processing is designed to reduce cross-stem leakage and improve stem quality.\n\nThe feature is set to 'on' by default but can be toggled off if necessary. If you want to make sure it’s enabled or want to disable it, follow these simple steps:\n\nOpen the main LALAL.AI site page.\n\nWithin the upload section, click the settings icon at the top right corner.\n\nIn the drop-down menu, find the Enhanced Processing option. Toggle it on or off, depending on your goal.\n\nNote that Enhanced Processing can only be applied to the Vocal and Instrumental, Drums, Piano, Acoustic Guitar and Electric Guitar stems.\n\nIn rare cases, Enhanced Processing may lead to overly aggressive compression of the main stem and its leakage into the auxiliary stem. Learn more about the feature here.\n\nBy default, the resulting files are provided in the same format as the original files that were uploaded. For instance, if you upload a file in FLAC format, the output will also be in FLAC format.\n\nPremium users also have the option to choose the output format. Here's how it works:\n\nUpload a file to LALAL.AI.\n\nWait for the file to be processed and the preview to appear.\n\nClick the arrow on the Split in Full button to open the format selection menu.\n\nChoose the desired output format from the drop-down list.\n\nClick the Split in Full button to start processing the entire audio file.\n\nOnce the processing is complete, you will be able to download the resulting file in the selected format. If you don't select a format in the preview step, the results will be in the same format as the uploaded file.\n\nNote: In addition to audio, LALAL.AI supports video file input in MP4, MKV, and AVI formats. When you upload a video file, you have two options:\n\nSkip the output format selection. In this case, the results will be in the original video format.\n\nSelect an audio format. You can choose from MP3, OGG, AAC, AIFF, WAV, and FLAC. The results will be in the selected audio format.\n\nClick Log In in the upper right corner of the LALAL.AI site page. After that, you will see a pop-up window where you can register or log in to an existing account via email, Google, or Facebook.\n\nWhen you sign up or sign in via email, you receive a letter from LALAL.AI containing a one-time verification code and a temporary authorization link. Enter the code on the website to access your LALAL.AI account.\n\nNote that the code expires 10 minutes after it is sent by email. If you haven't managed to use the code in that time, you can request a new code or simply click the authorization link in the email. The link will be valid for 24 hours. If you have not used the link within this period, you will need to re-enter your email address on the LALAL.AI website.\n\nYes, this is a recurring payment. You'll be billed on a regular basis on the same day you make the initial payment. If you purchased a monthly plan on May 12, your next payment would be on June 12. If you purchased an annual plan, you would be billed on the same day each year.\n\nAs a subscriber, you can split files in two modes – Relaxed and Fast. In Relaxed mode, tracks are placed in a queue to be processed as server time becomes available; the wait time in Relaxed mode depends on server load.\n\nFast mode gives you instant access to the server, so your tracks start splitting immediately. In short, Fast mode allows you to process files quicker than Relaxed mode. The results of splitting are the same quality-wise, regardless of the mode.\n\nThere is a limited amount of minutes you can process in Fast mode, whereas in Relaxed mode, you can split as many minutes as you want without limits. Note that you can’t switch between the modes. At the beginning of each month, all tracks are processed in Fast mode until the minute limit is reached. After that, tracks automatically start to be split in Relaxed mode.\n\nThis feature works in conjunction with LALAL.AI's main stem separation networks (Orion and Phoenix), helping them more precisely identify all the sounds of the stem you selected for separation.
