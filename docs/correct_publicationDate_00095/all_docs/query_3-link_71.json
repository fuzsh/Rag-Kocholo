        "text": "Early on in Olaf Stapledon’s strange and influential science-fiction novel Starmaker, the narrator heads off into the cosmos in a disembodied state. Eventually he arrives at an “Other Earth” where he encounters “a race that was essentially human, though, so to speak, human in a different key from the terrestrial.” Stapledon’s insistence on the humanity of what we would normally term “alien” — so long as they have attained a certain level of development and rationality — is a refreshing quality of his work, and one that I hope to explore the implications of elsewhere.\n\nHere I want to focus on a theme that highlights much more strongly Stapledon’s capacities of imagination and description. It all centers on the sense and the properties of taste. About these “Other Men” or different human beings, he tells us: “In sensory equipment they were not unlike ourselves, save that in vision they were less sensitive to color and more to form than is common with us….” They also don’t hear as well as we do. “Though their auditory organs were as sensitive as ours to faint sounds, they were poor discriminators.”\n\nThese two senses — seeing and hearing — have been incredibly important for us…"
