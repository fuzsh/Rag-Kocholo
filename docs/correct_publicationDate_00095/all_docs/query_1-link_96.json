        "meta_description": "Duncan Lawie has returned with a review of Star Maker, a science fiction novel written by Olaf Stapledon.  Part science fiction, part philosphical text, it's worth checking out.  Originally published in 1968, it was re-printed last summer, making it available again for the first time in a long time....",

        "text": "Olaf Stapledon was a British writer and philosopher whose first science fiction was published in 1930. Much of his writing concerns the concept of \"true community\" and his belief that humanity, as it currently exists, has no real capacity for a genuine understanding of truth. This places him far outside of the pulp mainstream of science fiction in his period. His emphasis on social comment rather than action and his use of science fictional processes to advance philosophical discourse instead continues the strand of \"scientific romance\" by then established in the British literary tradition.\n\nStar Maker, first published in 1937, is generally considered Stapledon's best work. From the first the book displays its lyricism despite the mundane early subject of the suburbs after sunset. In these quiet homes, the possible existence of a genuine relationship between two people is explored in a first attempt to illuminate the concept of true community. Placed in conflict with such an ideal is the immensity of the world and the apparent impossibility of any human having a true relationship with all people. From these eminently recognizable circumstances the narrator quickly extends his viewpoint to consider the world and its multitudes before coming to the suggestion that all this is insignificant in the face of the universe.\n\nHaving touched upon his main themes, Stapledon expands his focus. The next section is a clearly written account of an alien race with which the narrator comes into contact. The successes and failures of that alien society become an implicit counterpoint to human experience, though the narrator cannot help rounding this out with a number of more explicit comparisons before moving on to describe countless further societies. These descriptive passages are powerful examples of the richness of Stapledon's imagination. Many of the ideas summed up in a few brief pages could have been developed into full chapters or novels of their own. In fact, the narrator repeatedly states that he \"has not space to describe\" details of many of the events he witnesses. The text also contains repeated comments on how little the narrator has retained of the events and situations experienced. Whilst this is at times frustrating, it is clear that Stapledon has greater things in mind than simple description of the fantastic diversity of the universe.\n\nAs each level of his story becomes clear, the themes of community, hope and futility are played out in a grand spiral of ever escalating scales of action. After several iterations, the process seems clear and the book looks likely to become tedious. Instead the very rate of magnification is itself transformed to a whole new scale. As the book reaches universal immensity, early heights become trivialities against the ineffable activities of increasingly sane, immortal beings, though hope and failure are still a vital impetus. The end point of intelligent life is approached and revelation - of sorts - is achieved in a final ecstasy.\n\nThe resultant novel is rather dry, infinitely high minded and focused on a philosophy which requires the best from each of us without necessarily offering any reward. However, the ideas are endlessly fascinating and many of the passages are profoundly satisfying reading. The book's use of repetition in theme and punctuated revelation allow complex ideas to be absorbed without conscious effort. Star Maker is a novel which deserves savouring and rewards careful reading."
