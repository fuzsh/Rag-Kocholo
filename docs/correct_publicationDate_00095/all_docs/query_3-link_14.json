        "text": "Chapter I: Balkan Europe\n\nCompounded pride and ignorance, ever the silent pusher in human affairs, claim the lives of many in the Anglo-French War. Thereafter, nationalism is seen as a swarthy agent of a nation’s demise, yet, when fingers are pointed they point both ways. With global interests of economy, America plays a tepid role in affairs, unacting themselves yet always nosy in the mind’s eye of the population; thus, the poisoning of the Russo-German war.\n\n“Like most wars, the Angelo-French War had increased the desire for peace, yet made peace less secure” (18).\n\nChapter II: Europe’s Downfall\n\nAfter Europe’s bickering divided the continent, America fills the vacuum of power. Globalizing the world with American products, America is “respected for their enterprise” yet “universally feared and envied” (21). Suspicious of competition and resistance, America makes its military pressure known with airbases and flyovers, one of which happens at the wrong time at the wrong place; thus, leading to a European megadeath and global fear of simply criticizing the powerful nation.\n\n“For in a declining civilization it is often the old who see furthest and see with the youngest eyes” (28).\n\nChapter III: America and China\n\nThough as Americanized as the rest of the world in regards to media, language, and habit, China arises to become America’s chief global counterbalance of influence. Cultural differences divide the populous nations of China and India, yet America allies itself with Russian mysticism and China allies itself with the rigorous Germans. With the globe divided by the influence of the two nations, conflict can be sparked form noble beginnings and be fueled by patriotism.\n\n“America was balanced between the will merely to effect an economy and political unification or the world, and a fanatical craving to impose American culture on the East” (45).\n\nChapter IV: An Americanized Planet\n\nNearly four hundred years after the European War (Chapter I), a World State and its President of the World are established. Science, empirical thought held in such high regard it borders on mysticism, impregnates the daily life of each citizen who all revere the mysterious greatness of the ancient Chinese scientist Gordelpus, the Prime Mover. However, having expended Earth’s sources of oil, they are left to rely on Antarctica’s veins of coal.\n\n“[T]his age, for more than the notorious ‘nineteenth century’, was the great age of barren complacency” (61).\n\nChapter V: The Fall of the First Men\n\nWith the utter eclipse of the World State and, with it, the knowledge and pride, so too befalls the glory of Man in progress. The Dark Ages settle in for many millennia yet geological processes continue unabated, without care for Man or his progress. From the fragments of Man rise a fledging civilization in the landmass of the once South Atlantic who rediscover their ancestor’s greatness and, with it, its power for destruction and cruelty.\n\n“Deprived of power, machinery, and chemical fertilizer, these bumpkins were hard put to keep themselves alive” (78).\n\nChapter VI: Transition\n\nOnly twenty-eight hearty, intelligent souls survived the megadeath of the epic subterranean blast and found purchase on an inhabitable tract of land in northern Siberia. A schism physically divides the settlement—one half of the survivors staying on the coats and the other half crossing the seas… only to slowing devolve to barbarianism. Even the cultured and learned settlement found itself helpless to their natural state of inbred infertility and inflexibility.\n\n“[T]hey had no longer the capacity to profit much from the new clemency of nature … Little by little this scanty human race degenerated into a mere remnant of Arctic savages” (107).\n\nChapter VII: The Rise of the Second men\n\nFrom the dregs of the First man’s ultimate Dark Age arose a passive species of its very descent. Meanwhile, across the great continental divide of mountains, a lesser form of man had devolved among simians which developed superior intellectual capacity; yet, these capacities were limited when compared to the great Siberian intellect. Jealousy leaves a rift and the demise of both races, regardless of a zenith for sexual revival, soon approached.\n\n“So much, in the fullness of time, could be achieved, even without mechanical power, by a species gifted with high intelligence and immune from anti-social self-regard” (121).\n\nChapter VIII: The Martians\n\nNear a village in the Alpine peaks, a green cloud-cum-jelly descended from the sky to temporarily terrorize the curious and unfortunate. The cloud, actually a supermind of ultra-microscopic Martian entities, soon depart for unknown reasons, but the alien mind of the Martian individual and group psyche are as irrational as the minds of men. While advanced and industrious, the Martians are also flawed by a type of monomania.\n\n“The Martians were in many ways extremely well equipped for mental progress and for true spiritual adventure, but … they were driven to thwart their own struggling spirits at every turn” (142).\n\nChapter IX: Earth and Mars\n\nMillennia pass as recurrent intrusions by the Martians, each time being defeated by the crafty Second Men, but each time diminishing Man’s will to fight. Eventually, complete colonization of the Earth is accomplished by the Martians and further study of the humans reveals their intellectual capacity. Self-confidence is found in Man who then defeat the Martians, but not before lassitude, lingering Martian saboteurs, and starvation change Man’s nature.\n\n“[T]hey had determined to see their own racial tragedy as a thing of beauty, and they had failed” (155).\n\nChapter X: The Third Men in the Wilderness\n\nFreed from the yolk of Martian overrule and ushered into diversity from a glacial period, the Third Men evolved to become of special aural talent. Keen hunters yet also keen manipulators, the Third Men found a particular pleasure in the godliness of pain and considered its affliction upon lesser beings high excellent as it brought about “vivid psychic reality” (166). Fond of music, objective versus subjective harmony resulted in a chasm of displeasure.\n\n“[T]hough sometimes capable of a penetrating mystical intuition, they never seriously disciplined themselves under philosophy, nor tried to relate their mystical intuitions with the rest of their experience” (165).\n\nChapter XI: Man Remakes Himself\n\nSavvy of manipulating germ cells and with a maniacal drive to create the most supreme mind, the Third Men are able to create a superior mind with a vestigial body then, simply, a massive mind capable to incredible intellectual feats… and only that. The Great Minds then produces further Great Minds, thus producing the Fourth Men. Exterminating the pests and peasants of the Third Men, the Great Minds create their own version of human perfection, mobile yet brilliant—the artificial Fifth Men.\n\n“[I]n both science and art man kept recurring again and again to the ancient themes, to work over them once more in meticulous detail and strike from them new truth and new beauty” (204).\n\nChapter XII: The Last Terrestrials\n\nTelapathically linked as a whole, death much distressed the Fifth Men, whose lifespans reached upwards of 50,000 years. they yearned for the truth of an afterlife and found that the past was still tangible, thus began their obsession with remotely viewing the past. Never deceived, the Fifth Men also had to look forward to the terraforming of Venus because Earth’s destiny was to be sealed by its fateful dance with its orbiting moon.\n\n“[Q]uite early in their career they discovered an unexpected beauty in the very fact that the individual must die … immortality, they held, would lead to spiritual disaster” (206).\n\nChapter XIII: Humanity on Venus\n\nWith the native Venerians destroyed, the Fifth Men were slowly able to evolve, with much hardship, into the Sixth Men, a species which highly valued the beauty of flight. Their unremarkable, depressing existence gave way to the most splendid , rapturous species of Flying Men—the Seventh Men. Through gaiety and bliss, their short lives focused little on the sciences, so they bore the Eighth men—sturdy, intelligent, diligent, and unexpectedly unprepared to settle the planet Neptune.\n\n“It was inevitable that flight should obsess man on Venus … the riotous efflorescence of avian species shamed man’s pedestrian habits” (230).\n\nChapter XIV: Neptune\n\nIll-equipped for the barren wastelands of northern Neptune, the Ninth Men quickly suffered and devolved for millions of years, only occasionally arising to a brief flicker of intelligence. So went the proceeding Men, failures of their own success, until the Fifteenth Men, who “set themselves to abolish five great evils, namely, diseases, suffocating toil, senility, misunderstanding, ill-will” (251). Aware of their flaws, they created the Sixteenth Men, who devised the Seventeenth Men…\n\nChapter XV: The Last Men\n\nThe Eighteenth Men are the best adapted, longest living, and most conscious of the past, present, and future, yet they also know that they are to be the Last Men. They have lived the reality of a billion years of trial and error toward “harmonious complexity of form” and “the awakening of the spirit into unity, knowledge, delight and self-expression” (275). Life their evolution, the cosmos is very beautiful yet also very terrible and tragic.\n\nChapter XVI: The Last of Man\n\nInevitable cosmic disaster bestows the Eighteenth Men with a great task: continue the two billion-year music of Man’s evolution or return the entire effort to stellar dust. Though slipping into anarchy and tribalism, the Men strive to produce intergalactic spore of Man which may seed a planet and continue mankind’s tragic history, though the possibly remains remote. The certain blaze of oncoming death, however, spurs a final brotherly effort to reconcile."
