        "text": "Stapledon Olaf\n\nLondon: Secker & Warburg, 1944.\n\nFirst Edition. Hardcover (Original Cloth). Very Good Condition / Very Good. Item #041589\n\nLight shelfwear, chipping to jacket edges with slight loss and one very small tear. Still a very attractive example. A bit of discoloration to edges of brown cloth. Stapledon remains a singular figure in early science-fiction, taking on sprawling, nebulous issues with deftness and unending creativity. Sirius is told from the perspective of an enhanced dog raised as a family member by a psychologist.\n\nProvenance: Donald A. Wollheim's stamp on front endpaper. Wollheim was a towering figure in mid-late 20th century science fiction. He started as a writer and published regularly (Guillermo del Toro's Mimic is based on one of his stories) but was most influential as an editor and publisher, first at Avon, then Ace where he started their sci-fi publishing and finally at his own imprint DAW after Ace was sold. A terrific association. Size: Octavo (8vo). Quantity Available: 1. Shipped Weight: Under 1 kilo. Category: Science & Technology; Inventory No: 041589."
