        "text": "Stapledon was usually known as Olaf, to distinguish himself from his father William. his parents had been reading Carlyle’s The Early Kings of Norway (1975) when he was born, which accounts for his name. He was born on the Wirral peninsula, across the Mersey from Liverpool, and there spent most of his life. His father worked in the shipping industry, which meant that he never needed to look for employment.\n\nStapledon spent the first five years of his life in Port Said, where his father was working in the Suez Canal. In 1891 his mother brought Olaf back to England. He was educated in Liverpool and in the progressive Abbotsholme School in Derbyshire and went up to read History at Oxford, in Balliol College, in 1905. He taught for a year at Manchester Grammar School, and then went to work for his father. In 1912 he took up social work, and a year later left shipping for good. He became a tutor for the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA); teaching philosophy, history, and poetry. He met his future wife in 1913; she returned to Australia in 1914, but they kept a daily correspondence, and married in 1919.\n\nAfter his war experiences, Stapledon studied for a PhD in philosophy at Liverpool University, and wrote some essays on philosophy, although he never gained a full-time academic position. He came to public notice not through his philosophy, but through his science fiction. After the publication of Last and First Men in 1930 he became the friend and correspondent of several people to be found on this website, including Naomi Mitchison, J.B. Priestley and H.G. Wells. He wrote more fiction in the 1930s and early 1940s, and also wrote books such as Saints and Revolutionaries (1939), Philosophy and Living (1939) (which was published in the prestigious Pelican imprint, like Last and First Men), and Beyond the ‘Isms (1942).\n\nIn the 1930s he was active in pacifist campaigns, but he modified his position after the Second World War began. He spent some of the war years lecturing to men in the armed forces, under the auspices of the War Office. After the war, most of his fiction was out of print, but science fiction enthusiasts had not forgotten him: in 1948 he was invited by Arthur C. Clarke to talk at the British Interplanetary Society. In his last years he campaigned for world peace, and against South African apartheid. He was the only European delegate granted a visa to attend a world peace congress in New York in 1949; it was widely viewed as a communist propaganda exercise, and the FBI kept him under observation throughout his time in the the USA.\n\nHe died suddenly of a heart attack in 1950: he had just published his last novel A Man Divided. His unfinished autobiographical work The Opening of the Eyes was published in 1954.\n\nThe above information comes from Robert Crossley’s entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and from his biography, Olaf Stapledon: Speaking for the Future (Syracuse NY: Syracuse University Press, 1994)."
