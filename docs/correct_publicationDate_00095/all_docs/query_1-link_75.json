        "text": "William Olaf Stapledon (1886-1950) is one of the great figures in the history of British science fiction. A lecturer for the Workers’ Educational Association and the University of Liverpool, the philosophical depth and imaginative breadth of his novels signified an important stage in the development of the genre. Stapledon’s most famous works are Last and First Men (1930), Odd John (1935), Star Maker (1937) and Sirius (1944).\n\nThe Olaf Stapledon Archive was deposited with the University of Liverpool in 1983. It includes corrected holograph manuscripts or typescripts and publishers’ proofs of Stapledon’s published works, as well as unpublished work and notes for his teaching courses.\n\nThe Digital Heritage Lab presents Stapledon’s previously unpublished lecture notes, dustjackets of his novels, and some of his famous ‘time charts’ created to accompany his work."
