        "text": "Post with 4 notes\n\nBertrand Russell and Olaf Stapledon\n\nJust a few days ago I was a little surprised to discover that Bertrand Russell had several times referred to the writings of science fiction author Olaf Stapledon, going so far as to refer to Stapledon’s Last and First Men as, “quite good – I mean an important book, worth writing.” (This comes from an interview with Alan Melville in 1956, in Collected Papers, Détente Or Destruction, 1955-57, p. 401)\n\nThe reason I was surprised by this because of Russell’s well known opposition to the Cold War Space Race. There is a good article on this by Chad Trainer that I had cited previously, Earth to Russell, in which Trainer details Russell’s opposition to the Space Race. I had taken this attitude of Russell and carelessly extrapolated it to a general indifference to the long term human future, but now I see I was mistaken in doing so. On this point I completely misunderstood Russell. Russell’s praise of Stapledon provides a window onto Russell’s own conception of humanity in the far future.\n\nRussell wrote a review of Last and First Men available in The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell Volume 21 - How to Keep the Peace: The Pacifist Dilemma, 1935–38, in which Russell said that Stapledon was:\n\n“…a writer with a very remarkable cosmological imagination, who has taken seriously the prophecies of astronomers as to the immense future ages during which the human race may be expected to continue. To most of us, when, if ever, we try to picture the distant future, it appears as leading up to some sort of Utopia and then growing uninteresting. The thought of (say) a hundred million years of orderly government, virtuous living, and steady scientific progress somehow fails to be inspiring. Mr. Stapledon does not have this common imaginative defect.”\n\nRussell even cited Stapledon in a work of philosophical logic, An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth, in the chapter on the law of the excluded middle – tertium non datur – in developing the idea of the possibility of universes that exist but which have no spatio-temporal relationship to our own – a suitably “big picture” question that can be addressed by philosophical logic, but which one is more likely to find treated in science fiction.\n\nWe get more of an understanding of Russell’s assessment of Stapledon in Russell’s short essay, “Taking Long Views,” in which Russell again praises Stapledon’s longue durée futurism, noting that many, like Russell himself, who are pessimistic in the short term, are nevertheless optimistic in the long term, and that works like those of Stapledon inspire real encouragement by their “vast vistas.”\n\nThe human, all-too-human elements of the Space Race – competition, nationalism, the drive to succeed at any cost, the struggle for recognition – which so effortlessly engaged the public interest, left Russell cold. It wasn’t the first time. I have quoted Russell’s response to the outbreak of the First World War, when Russell was entirely immune to the “August Madness” that greeted the outbreak of the war, in my post The August Madness.\n\nRussell’s puzzled response to the rejoicing of the public upon the declaration of war in 1914 is a textbook case – something we would see repeatedly in subsequent history – of a very intelligent individual who nevertheless completely misjudged the public response to a major event and so completely misunderstood the nature of the history that he and his fellow human beings at the time were making.\n\nRussell’s writings from the period are poignant (which is why I quoted them at length in The August Madness), and his behavior was something akin to heroic (seen from the perspective of his own principles), but he did not learn the basic lesson of historiography that he he should have drawn from the experience. I have discussed the famous quote that history is philosophy teaching by example, but Russell the philosopher failed to learn the lesson that history tried to teach him.\n\nRussell’s failure to connect the excitement with the Space Race to the longue durée futurism of Stapledon is essentially a failure to connect short term futures with long term futures. To make this explicit, what I am suggesting is that there is a connection between Russell’s failure to understand the public reception of the First World War and his failure to connect the human immediacy of short term futures with the more intellectual and aesthetically appealing vision of longue durée futurism. This is of particular interest to me at present because I am working on this question in my podcast series The Cosmic Archipelago (cf. Part I, Part II, and Part III)."
