        "text": "Advanced canine intelligence\n\nOlaf Stapeldon’s Sirius is a mid-20th century sci-fi with a theme that in the late 20th century would be referred to as ‘uplift.’ A scientist experiments with increasing the intelligence of dogs with the hope of breeding super sheep herders. One particular dog exceeds expectations and achieves near human intelligence, although speech is difficult and the lack of ‘hands’ is a serious impediment. The tale relates Sirius’ adventures and his unique involvement with a woman that he was raised with.\n\nStapeldon displays a keen assessment of the physical limitations that would accompany a human equivalent intelligence among canines, particularly focusing on communications as well as limited dexterity due to lack of ‘hands’ or more precisely, fingers for manipulation. While there are scientific interests and a sheepherder would appreciates the expanded capabilities, there is much societal and religious objections that must be endured.\n\nThe narration is quite good with decent character distinction. Pacing is brisk.\n\nFor animal lovers, seekers, and psychologists\n\nThis book is going to stick with me for a while. I literally just finished it about 30 seconds ago and I don't think I'm ready to talk about it intelligently, but here are some bullet points to flesh out later. Maybe I'll just leave them here as reader questions for others. My gut reaction says that this is a damn, fine book and I would recommend it to anyone.\n\n• It makes obvious references to Adam and his Creator in the same way Frankenstein does, which invites the comparison. How are the two books alike/different?\n\n• Sirius talks a lot about the Spirit and search both scientific and mystical sources for truth. Eventually he forms some kind of in-between truth (much like he is an in-between creature) of the Spirit. What did I make of that as a reader? How does it relate to wordless song/singing, as featured in key moments of the story?\n\n• This book wasn't always gripping as a story. It never felt unfocused, to me, but the style of it seemed less concerned with events and more concerned with a kind of seeking for truth. Will I agree with this assessment later? Does this focus/structure somehow make it harder to read?\n\n• War looms over this tale. It seems crucial to me in some way, but I can't quite put a finger on it other than to say that it forces the characters to separate at times. But how does war affect the story's themes? What other big abstracts come into play (e.g. Religion, Love, the Wild) as forces that drive us?\n\n• There is both sadness and strangeness in this story. Where and how did it break my heart? Where and how did it make me feel uncomfortable?\n\nUnusual, yet compelling.\n\nIntriguing story about a scientific and experimental dog which was bred to have extreme human-like thinking capabilities. The experiment exceeds expectations and the dog, named Sirius, has also achieved human personality traits. One might say, in fact, he is a missing link between dog and human, while he is still in dog form. The narrator did a fine job, and brought much of his gift to the story. I found myself liking Sirius, and he became my friend much as he was to some of the other characters in this book."
