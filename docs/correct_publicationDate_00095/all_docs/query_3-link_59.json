His debut novel, ‘Last and First Men’, covers a history of 18 successive species of humanity, while his magnum opus ‘Star Maker’ provides an outline history of the Universe over two billion years. His works are highly acclaimed by figures as diverse as Brian Aldiss, Jorge Luis Borges, J. B. Priestley, Bertrand Russell, Algernon Blackwood, Arnold Bennett, Virginia Woolf, C. S.
