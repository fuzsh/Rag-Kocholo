        "text": "(1886–1950). English author Olaf Stapledon wrote works of both philosophy and science fiction throughout his career. He is remembered primarily for his “histories of the future,” which proved highly influential in the development of science fiction.\n\nWilliam Olaf Stapledon was born near Liverpool, England, on May 10, 1886. A pacifist, he served with a Friends’ ambulance unit in World War I and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. He received a doctorate in philosophy and psychology from the University of Liverpool. In 1929 he published A Modern Theory of Ethics and seemed destined for an academic career, but after the success of his novel Last and First Men (1930), he began to write fiction.\n\nLast and First Men traces the history of humanity from the First Men (present-day) to the Eighteenth Men, one of whom serves as narrator. The tale illustrates Stapledon’s belief that to emphasize either the physical—represented by the flying Seventh Men of Venus—or the mental—represented by the giant-brained Fourth Men—to the exclusion of the other spells certain disaster. Stapledon emphasized the ideals of community, necessary for individual fulfillment and embodied by the Eighteenth Men, and of spirit, which gives purpose to human existence. He used themes of antiquity and myths of the past to create a myth of the future.\n\nStapledon’s nonfiction works include Philosophy and Living (1938) and Beyond the “Isms” (1942). He also wrote for technical and scholarly reviews on ethics and philosophy. His other works of fiction include The Last Men in London (1932), Odd John (1935), Star Maker (1937), and Sirius (1944). He died on Sept. 6, 1950, in Cheshire, England."
