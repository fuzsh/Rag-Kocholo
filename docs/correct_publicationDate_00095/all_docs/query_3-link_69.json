        "text": "William Olaf Stapledon (10 May 1886 – 6 September 1950) was an English science fiction writer. He is best known for his novels Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future (1930) and Star Maker. Stapledon's work often tends to a grand impersonal view of the universe and unlike Clive Staples Lewis doesn't really feature individual characters to any great degree.\n\nInfluence on the Space Trilogy[]\n\nLewis said that his Space Trilogy was written in response to the dehumanising currents of modern science fiction. Lewis stated in a letter to Roger Lancelyn Green:[1]\n\n\"What immediately spurred me to write was Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men … and an essay in J.B.S. Haldane's Possible Worlds both of wh[ich] seemed to take the idea of such [space] travel seriously and to have the desperately immoral outlook wh[ich] I try to pillory in Weston. I like the whole interplanetary ideas as a mythology and simply wished to conquer for my own (Christian) p[oin]t of view what has always hitherto been used by the opposite side. I think H. G. Wells' First Men in the Moon the best of the sort I have read …\"\n\nStapledon is supposed to have written Starmaker in response. While Starmaker does feature something like a Supreme Being, it is a cold indifferent deist figure, or almost a type of demiurge, not the loving God featured in the Space Trilogy.\n\nEdward Rolles Weston's plan in Out of the Silent Planet is to open a new age of space colonization to ensure the eternal survival of the human race, an idea borrowed from Stapledon's Last and First Men. The seeming humanitarianism of Weston's scheme is corrupted by his contemptuous and colonialist attitude towards all other forms of life, including the humane and intelligent Malacandrians.\n\nHowever, Lewis' attitude to Stapledon was not one-sided - in the preface to That Hideous Strength Lewis acknowledges a debt to him: \"Mr. Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can well afford to lend, and I admire his invention (though not his philosophy) so much that I should feel no shame to borrow.\"\n\nReferences[]\n\nSee also[]"
