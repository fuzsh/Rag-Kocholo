        "text": "Olaf Stapledon (born May 10, 1886, Wirral Peninsula, near Liverpool, Merseyside, Eng.—died Sept. 6, 1950, Cheshire) was an English novelist and philosopher whose “histories of the future” are a major influence on contemporary science fiction.\n\nA pacifist, Stapledon served with a Friends’ ambulance unit in World War I and was awarded the Croix de Guerre. He received a Ph.D. in philosophy and psychology from the University of Liverpool. In 1929 he published A Modern Theory of Ethics and seemed destined for an academic career, but after the success of his novel Last and First Men (1930), he turned to fiction.\n\nLast and First Men traces the history of humanity from the First Men (present-day) to the Eighteenth Men, one of whom serves as narrator. The tale illustrates Stapledon’s belief that to emphasize either the physical (the flying Seventh Men of Venus) or the mental (the giant-brained Fourth Men) to the exclusion of the other spells certain disaster. He emphasized the ideals of community, necessary for individual fulfillment and embodied by the Eighteenth Men, and of spirit, which gives purpose to human existence. He used themes of antiquity and myths of the past to create a myth of the future."
