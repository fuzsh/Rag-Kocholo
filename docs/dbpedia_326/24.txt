Superior Custom Electronics

The world of electronics has changed significantly since Techtron Systems opened its doors in 1971. Things are moving faster, the world has become smaller, and technology has become more and more advanced. At every step, Techtron Systems has remained steadfast in its commitment to producing cutting-edge products at competitive prices and in its dedication to the highest levels of quality and customer service. This means that we:

Optimize the use of advanced manufacturing methods and technologies

Continually improve the effectiveness of our management system

Provide a safe and environmentally responsible workplace

Customer focused. Quality driven. That’s the Techtron Systems advantage.

A History of Excellence

When our founder, Paul Teel Sr., established Techtron, we were a small company in a basement. We have now grown to occupy a 70,000 sq. ft., state-of-the-art manufacturing facility that maintains the highest standards in the testing, manufacturing, and assembly process. Since those days in the basement, we’ve always made sure that our components are tested, proven, and produced efficiently and effectively. Throughout our history, that has been our staple.

Today, Techtron is led by our president, Paul Teel Jr., and the mission is still the same: To provide the highest quality of products for our clients while pushing the envelope of innovation.
