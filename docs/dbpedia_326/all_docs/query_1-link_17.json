        "text": "Size and Availability:\n\nSheet / Slab stock\n\n- Thickness: 1/4”thk to 2”thk\n\n- Sheet sizes: 24”x 48” standard\n\nRod / Round stock\n\n- Diameters: 3/8”dia to 3”dia\n\n- Rod length: 8 foot long\n\nTechtron® PPS (polyphenylene sulfide) products offer the broadest resistance to chemicals of any advanced engineering plastic. They have no known solvents below 392° F (200°C) and offer inertness to steam, strong bases, fuels and acids. Minimal moisture absorption and a very low coefficient of linear thermal expansion, combined with Quadrant EPP's proprietary stress relieving process, make these PPS products exhibit excellent electrical characteristics and are inherently flame retardant. Unlike filled PPS products, Techtron PPS is easily machined to close tolerances. It is ideal for structural applications in corrosive environments or as a PEEK replacement at lower temperatures.\n\nTechtron 1000 PPS (extruded) is more of a beige color only, it is not offered in black.\n\nTechtron PPS compression molded filled grades PSGF (glass filled) and PSBG (bearing grade) are both very dark brown to black in color. These materials are not offered in a virgin \"unfilled\" Techtron PPS compression molded material.\n\nTechron HPV (High Pressure Velocity) is a reinforced, internally lubricated semicrystalline bearing grade polymer developed to close the gap both in performance and price between the standard thermoplastic materials and the high end advanced engineering plastic products. Techtron HPV is blue in color.\n\nFeatures:\n\nExcels in corrosive environments to 425°F (220°C)\n\nExcellent chemical resistance\n\nEssentially zero moisture absorption\n\nMachines to tight tolerances, dimensionally stable\n\nExcellent alternative to PEEK at lower temperatures\n\nApplications:\n\nPump & valve components\n\n\"Down-hole\" applications\n\nHVAC equipment\n\nLantern rings\n\nChip nests\n\nRetainer rings"
