        "text": "DSR 100 Series: Automotive Conducted Immunity Test System\n\nOur DSR 100 drop-out, surge, ripple simulator and AC/DC voltage source provides a complete, single-box solution for automotive immunity testing. This includes a simple-to-use, yet powerful standards waveform generator matched with an industry leading power supply technology. It features an extensive 3,000+ library of tests for many automotive and industry standards.\n\nSystem Features:\n\nIncludes library of 3000+ pre-enterd Automotive and Industry Standards' test routines.\n\nOperate as a free-standing system using the included monitor, keyboard and mouse, or control via LAN.\n\nVery easy to modify existing tests or build new test sequences.\n\nCan function as a controller or node in a larger test system via built-in LAN and GPIO controls.\n\nModels from 25A to 200A continuous output current.\n\nLearn More\n\nCIS-25 Test Kit: Conducted/Induced Susceptibility Testing\n\nAE Techron's CIS-25 Test Kit combines into a single, complete package the items needed to accurately test to important Aviation standards like DO-160 Sections 16, 18, & 19, Boeing, Airbus, and MIL STD 461. Included with the kit are three coupling transformers (T1000, T2000, and T3700), the CR600 Chattering Relay accessory, and a secure storage cabinet to keep the equipment safe.\n\nSystem Features:\n\nIncludes two hours of expert consulting provided by EMC Specialist Patrick G. Andre, who will answer questions regarding set-up or testing.\n\nIncludes the DSR 100-25 test system, providing continuous DC power as rated, and is able to provide 4X rated power for in-rush testing up to 200 ms (such as is required in DO 160 Section 16).\n\nIncludes the complete 3110A Standard's Library, so the CIS-25 Test Kit can be used for many other tests.\n\nEasy to set up and use; all elements in the kit are robust and will provide you with many years of trouble-free service.\n\nLearn More\n\n3110A Standards Waveform Generator\n\nThe 3110A is a simple-to-use yet powerful standards waveform generator. It can be combined with other AE Techron products to quickly create a wide range of powerful and intelligent EMC test solutions. The 3110A outputs a standard analog signal that can work with any AE Techron amplifier or other LF amplifiers that you already have. When coupled with the AE Techron model 7234 amplifier, the 3110A can create virtually all waveforms, DC offsets, dropouts and surges needed for EMC test with rise/fall times of 2µs or greater and frequencies from DC to 1 MHz.\n\nSystem Features:\n\nIncludes library of 3000+ pre-entered Automotive, Aviation, and Industry Standards' test routines.\n\nUp to 1 MHz EMC Testing.\n\nDramatically reduces test time for repetitive test sequences.\n\nSemi-automatic calibration routine significantly reduces labor-intensive tasks (like CS101).\n\nVery easy to modify included waveform sequences or create new ones.\n\nLearn More\n\nLinear and Switch-Mode Amplifiers for a Variety of EMC Testing\n\nAE Techron is a world leader in the design and manufacture of DC to 1MHz industrial power amplifiers and test systems. We produce high-reliability, wide-bandwidth, low-noise linear and switch-mode amplifiers while surrounding our products with great technical support, creating an unmatched value for our customers.\n\n7224/7234: Industrial Amplifiers / Battery Simulators\n\nAutomotive up to 30A dC / 250 kHz AC\n\nAviation DO 160 Section 18 and 19\n\n8504: Wide-bandwidth, High-Power Switch-Mode Amplifier\n\nDO-160 Section 16 AC/DC\n\nMIL Standard 704 AC/DC\n\n7794: Four-Quadrant, DC-enabled Linear Power Amplifier\n\nAutomotive up to 200A DC / 250 kHz\n\n4301 Series: Complete Solution for DC Voltage Variations and Telecom Transients Testing\n\nThe 4301 Series has been specially designed for EMC testing of network telecommunications equipment and is the best system available for producing the waveforms required for transient voltage measurements as described in GR-1089 Section 10 and ATIS-0600315.2007. The 4301 includes a SDG2042X Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator, which comes pre-programmed and integrated into the 4301 system. Together, the 4301 with Siglent AWG provides a complete solution for GR-1089 Section 10/ATIS-0600315.2007 testing.\n\nSystem Features:\n\nSlew rates up to 60 V/µsec.\n\nUp to 240A DC at +50V DC or –50V DC (4301-240 configuration).\n\nCan provide pulses of up to 800 amps at voltages of up to ±100V (4301-240 configuration).\n\nAdjustable compensation allows the system to maintain a 50V/2 µsec rise-time over a wide range of current outputs.\n\nLearn More"
