        "text": "It is easy to earn points in the CTR program by doing the following:\n\n• Fuel Earn Offer (5 points per gallon): Earn 5 points for each gallon of Chevron and Texaco branded fuel you purchase at participating branded stations in that region with your User Account.\n\nYou can use your User Account by entering your CTR phone number at the pump or in-store at the register, or by making the fuel purchase through your User Account on the App.\n\n• In-Store Earn Offers: Earn points for specific in-store purchases as may be marketed in the App and website.\n\nYou can use your User Account by entering your CTR phone number in-store at the register, or by using the Pay Inside feature on the App (at participating pilot stations only).\n\n• Achievement Earn Offers: Earn points in that region for reaching qualifying achievements as may be marketed in the App.\n\nBe sure to enable push notifications and text messages to learn about these and other introductory and promotional offers. Data rates may apply. Returns will not qualify for Earn Offers. Earn Offers are not transferable and may not be combined with other offers, sales, or promotions. Allow up to 72 hours for points in that region to appear in your User Account after earning.\n\nThe CTR program is separated into two regions in select areas—the West and the East. The West covers the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and parts of Texas (defined as the counties of Bastrop, Culberson, Ector, El Paso, Haskell, Howard, Hudspeth, Midland, Taylor, Ward, and Winkler). The East covers the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and the other parts of Texas. The CTR program in the West is managed by Drop Tank, LLC. Each region operates separately with points and rewards earned in each respective region available only in that region. Points earned in one region cannot be redeemed for rewards in the other region, combined with points earned in that other region, or transferred to the other region. Not all states have Chevron and Texaco stations that are participating in the CTR program.\n\nYou can create a User Account on the App and/or website. You will need to provide both the phone number for your mobile device and valid email address and verify your account by entering a One-Time Password (OTP) code that will be sent to your mobile phone number. You must provide Chevron consent to send you autodialed text messages to authenticate your phone number. You will also have the option to receive other text messages. You will need to create a 4-digit PIN to authorize payments for security purposes. You may be required to create a User\n\nAccount in the App since your wireless carrier may not be supported to create a User Account in the Website.\n\nYes. You will need to create a User Account if you would like to use the App or website to join the Chevron Texaco Rewards program, use the App to make purchases, and access transaction history. If you do not create a User Account, you may still use the App or website to locate stations, provide feedback, and learn more about the Chevron or Texaco brands. You may be required to create a User Account in the App since your wireless carrier may not be supported to create a User Account in the Website.\n\nYou may opt out of receiving these messages at any time by doing one of the following:\n\n(i) changing your account settings via the App or website, or\n\n(ii) following the opt-out mechanisms in messages you receive; or\n\n(iii) calling 855-285-9595 and requesting to be removed from our text-message or email marketing distribution list.\n\nIf you opt out, Chevron or its third-party contractors may send you one last text message or email confirming that you opted out. You may still receive autodialed text messages to authenticate your phone number as part of using the App. You will still receive transactional email messages for your User Account.\n\nYou can either delete your User Account from the App or the CTR website. From the App, go to “My Profile” on the App, select “Settings,” and select “Delete account” from the bottom of the page. There is a prompt that confirms whether you want to continue deleting your account or to cancel. To continue deleting your account, select “Delete account.\" Your User Account will be deleted from both the App and website. This will include any payment methods, all transaction receipts, and any earned points and rewards. Once you delete your User Account, you will no longer be able to access this information. We reserve the right to maintain information for eligibility purposes and to the extent permitted by applicable law.\n\nYou can either delete your User Account from the App or the CTR website.

If you have not yet joined the CTR program, you may create a new User Account with the same phone number after you have deleted a previous User Account. If you have any issues or have joined the CTR program, call the Consumer Connection Center at 1-855-285-9595 or submit a case directly from the “Contact us” page in the App to create a new User Account with the same phone number. Any introductory offers in the CTR program are only eligible for new User Account holders who have not previously created a User Account. We reserve the right to limit or reject the use of the CTR program or any Earn Offers, introductory offers, or any redemption of points and suspend or terminate any related User Account upon the belief that any use of the CTR program or transaction is unlawful, unauthorized, or fraudulent in nature.\n\nFor an Apple Watch, make sure to download the App to your mobile device and then download the App to your Apple Watch from the Apple Watch app on your mobile device. For a Wear OS device, download the App directly from the Google Play store on your Wear OS device. Your preferences and payment methods that are currently linked in your User Account will already be set up in your Apple Watch or Wear OS device app. Before using the app on your Apple Watch or Wear OS, please ensure that you are logged into the App on your mobile device, the App is open on your mobile device, and your Apple Watch or Wear OS is connected to your mobile device.\n\nApple CarPlay or Android Auto allows you to find a station, select your payment, car wash, pump, and fuel up without interacting with the phone. First, connect your phone to any compatible Apple CarPlay or Android Auto car then open the Chevron or Texaco app. Then ensure you are logged into your User Account on your mobile device and have payment methods added to your User Account. All of your payment methods will be available for selection except Apple Pay. For more information and steps, visit our Car Apps page.

However, you can link the cards as payment methods directly in your User Account.\n\n• Make sure that you are on the latest version of the App.\n\n• Make sure to enter the correct information when linking the card or any payment method.\n\n• Link your credit/debit card to just one User Account on just one mobile device.\n\n• If you have authorized users on a credit/debit card, advise them to link their own card to their User Account on their own mobile device.\n\n• If you received and activated a replacement card, remove the old card before linking the replacement card as a payment method.\n\n• If you are still unable to link your card, please call your financial institution.\n\nCurrently you can pay at the pump with the App using:\n\n(i) a registered PayPal or Venmo account,\n\n(ii) a Techron Advantage Credit Card or Techron Advantage Visa® Card,\n\n(iii) a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover card,\n\n(iv) Chevron and Texaco physical gift and promotional cards with PINs,\n\n(v) Chevron and Texaco eGift and ePromo Cards,\n\n(vi) Chevron and Texaco electronic promotional cards (ePromo Cards),\n\n(vii) Apple Pay\n\n(viii) Google Pay, and\n\n(ix) Checking PayTM (available in certain areas), and\n\n(x) Pay Inside (will be available at CTR-participating stations). See FAQs on how to set up Apple Pay, Google Pay or Checking Pay.\n\nSee FAQs on how to set up Apple Pay, Google Pay or Checking Pay. At this time, Techron Advantage Credit Card and Techron Advantage Visa® Card cannot be used as payment methods through Apple Pay or Google Pay, however you can link the cards as a payment method directly in the App.\n\nSee the FAQ on how to link a payment method to your User Account on the App. At this time, Apple Pay cannot be used via Apple CarPlay or Android Auto.\n\nChevron is piloting the Pay Inside feature on the App at several CTR-participating stations. Upon checking out at the register, open the App and do the following:\n\n• Click on the Pay Inside button on the home screen;\n\n• Choose your payment method and input your Chevron Rewards phone number on the PIN pad; and\n\n• Click “Show QR Code” and present it to the cashier to process payment.\n\n• Ask the cashier to scan the QR code on your phone to process payment.\n\nFor stations that participate in the grocery Gas Rewards program, you have the option to link your grocery Gas Rewards mobile number.\n\n• Note: The Pay Inside feature does not support Apple Pay at this time.\n\nAfter you have downloaded the App, created a User Account, and linked a payment method, log into the App and confirm the nearest station to you or select a new one. Navigate to the station, and when you are at the station, select “Fuel up.” Use the selector to choose which pump you would like to use to purchase fuel. After selecting the pump, confirm your payment method and whether you would like to add a car wash, if available, and/or redeem any available rewards. Once your payment method is authorized, the pump will be reserved for you, and you will see the “begin fueling” prompt on the App screen. Then, you can pick up the nozzle, choose the grade and start fueling.\n\nApple Watch, Wear OS, CarPlay and Android Auto may also be used after installing the App. For instructions on how to use CarPlay and Android Auto to fuel up, you can visit our Car Apps page.\n\nIf you are purchasing fuel from an attendant, advise the gas station attendant which fuel grade to pump and the dollar amount once you see the “Begin Fueling” prompt on the App screen. The attendant will then pump your desired fuel.\n\nIf this is your first time linking a debit/credit card into the App, it is best to contact your financial institution so they can allow you to link your account into the App on their system. If you received a new card and have not activated it yet, please call your financial institution to activate the card. We also suggest linking the card within the vicinity of your billing zip code. If you are traveling outside of your billing zip code or have changed your address, please advise or update your records with your financial institution. If you think your card has been compromised, contact your financial institution immediately.\n\nChevron is piloting the Pay Inside feature on the App at a few stations participating in the Chevron Texaco Rewards program. When the feature is enabled, electronic gift and promotional cards could be used for in-store purchases. If your station is not part of the pilot, the App can only be used for fuel and car wash purchases at the pump and not within the store. You can still use any physical gift or promotional card that has been linked as a payment method in the App in the convenience store if there is an available balance. Electronic gift and promotional cards cannot be used for in-store purchases.\n\nBefore your Techron Advantage card can be added to the App as a payment method, the card must be activated. Click on “Wallet” at the bottom of the App home screen, select “Payment methods” and “+” to link a payment method. Choose “Techron Advantage Card.” Enter your card number, expiration date, security code (CVV) and zip code and hit “Submit.” You can then select how to receive a one-time security code from Synchrony, the card issuer, by either phone call or text to the phone number registered with the card.\n\nIf you have trouble receiving the security code, contact Synchrony by tapping on the message prompt or call the customer service number located on the back of your Techron Advantage Card. You may have a different phone number registered with Synchrony Financial, issuer of the Chevron Techron Advantage Card, than your User Account phone number."
