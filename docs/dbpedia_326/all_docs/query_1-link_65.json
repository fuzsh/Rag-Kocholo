        "text": "Request a Quote\n\nAlt\n\nRyton® / Techtron® / PPS (Polyphenylene Sulfide)\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nRyton® / Techtron® / PPS (polyphenylene sulfide) products offer the broadest resistance to chemicals of any high performance plastic. They have no known solvents below 392°F and are inert to steam, strong bases, fuels and acids. Minimal moisture absorption and a very low coefficient of linear thermal expansion along with stress-relieving processes make these PPS products ideally suited for precise-tolerance machined components. In addition, PPS products exhibit excellent electrical characteristics and are inherently flame retardant. PPS is ideally suited for plastic components in automotive, electrical, appliance and industrial applications.\n\nGrades and Colors\n\nRyton® CM (Compression Molded) PPS\n\nRyton® CM PPS is compression molded. Color is black.\n\nRyton® PPS BG (Bearing Grade)\n\nRyton® PPS BG (Bearing Grade) is an internally lubricated, carbon-fiber reinforced, compression-molded PPS that offers a low coefficient of thermal expansion and uncompromised chemical resistance. It is well suited for thrust or wear applications or when an electrically conductive material is required.\n\nRyton® PPS 40% GF (Glass Fiber)\n\nRyton® PPS GF (Glass Fiber) is PPS reinforced with 40% glass fiber and compression molded. It offers excellent dimensional stability and an exceptional degree of thermal stability, maintaining its strength above 425° F. With its superior chemical and flame resistance and excellent mechanical and electrical properties, Ryton® PPS 40% GF provides superior performance over a wide range of critical design requirements. Exceptional processing characteristics enable Ryton® PPS 40% GF to meet the needs of demanding, high-precision applications.\n\nTechtron® PPS\n\nTechtron® PPS is an unfilled and extruded grade of PPS. Unlike reinforced PPS products, Techtron® PPS is easily machined to close tolerances. It is the material of choice for structural applications in corrosive environments or as an alternative to PEEK at lower temperatures. Color is off-white.\n\nTechtron® HPV PPS\n\nTechtron® HPV PPS is an extruded grade of PPS. It offers exceptional wear resistance, load-bearing capabilities and dimensional stability when exposed to chemicals or when used in high-temperature environments. Techtron® HPV PPS also has a low coefficient of friction, which allows the product to overcome the disadvantages of virgin PPS caused by a high coefficient of friction and the disadvantages of glass-fiber reinforced PPS. Both can cause premature wear of the counterface in moving-part applications.\n\nKey Properties:\n\nExcellent chemical resistance\n\nAlmost no moisture absorption\n\nMachines to tight tolerances\n\nInert to steam, strong bases, fuels and acids\n\nStandard Shapes and Forms:\n\nThe range of sizes and shapes are grade specific, please contact us for more information.\n\nDownload Technical Specifications (PDF)"
