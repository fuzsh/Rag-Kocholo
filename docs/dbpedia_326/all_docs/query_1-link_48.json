The WM website doesn't list a price. At sale prices (e.g. $7.99) for the 20 oz size, $0.40/oz appears to be a reasonable price, so $4.00 would be a fair price for the 10 oz size.\n\nOriginally Posted By: Obos\n\nThese different sizes and concentrations have been around for a while\n\nIn fact, Walmart actually ask all suppliers for concentrated versions in order to reduce supply chain costs\n\nThis, while an interesting notion, is not proof that the Walmart version is more concentrated. Chevrons site does not split their products up by destination, nor does it offer multiple MSDS/PDS information.\n\nI'm suspect that it's any different than the volumes found at other stores.\n\nOriginally Posted By: Vikas\n\nAnybody wants to send a bottle to Blackstone for analysis?\n\nThere should be an account where members can donate whatever money they have to have to purchase a lab sample. There will be a poll or thread of the week for a particular product to be tested. Then each members throws in a quarter or whatever and a sample is done and posted. Blackstone can even host this.\n\nOriginally Posted By: cchase\n\nOriginally Posted By: Obos\n\nThese different sizes and concentrations have been around for a while\n\nIn fact, Walmart actually ask all suppliers for concentrated versions in order to reduce supply chain costs\n\nThis, while an interesting notion, is not proof that the Walmart version is more concentrated.

Companies like to make specific versions of products to make price comparison harder and they like to make money but they aren't pathological liars to the extent that they would mislead on the treat rate of a product they invented. They need it to work for their reputation as well"
