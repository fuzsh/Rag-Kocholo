It is designed to be used as a battery substitute for transient immunity testing requiring a battery and can produce up to 60A continuous at 13.8 VDC. The AE Techron 7794 offers a 200A in-rush current capability and, when combined in multiples, can provide an in-rush current of up to 800A.\n\nThe 7794 is capable of producing the 80V surges required for DO160G Section 16.6.2.4 abnormal surge testing. It is also well suited for ISO 7637 pulse 2b and 4 (voltage variations) testing.\n\nFeatures of the AE Techron 7794 include:\n\nStable when driving highly capacitive loads\n\n60A continuous at 13.8 VDC\n\n200A in-rush current capability\n\n150 kHz small signal bandwidth\n\n±80 VDC capable\n\n41 V/µS slew rate\n\nFour-quadrant operation (source and sink)\n\n3 mOhm output impedance\n\nThe 7794 is useful for complying with a long list of test standards, including:"
