It'll substantially enhance our research and development capabilities. It's a TOB-BTS-5V6A analyzer and is now fully operational in the company's Solaize laboratory. This advanced equipment will enable us to comprehensively analyze various Lithium battery formats, from button to the larger 21700 cylindrical batteries. One key advantage of this acquisition is the increased self-sufficiency it provides. By reducing our dependency on external laboratories, we can accelerate our testing processes and obtain critical data much faster and more efficiently. This speeds up our development cycles and significantly cuts costs associated with external validation, reassuring our commitment to cost-effectiveness. Investing in high-precision testing equipment is crucial for advancing the development of future generations of silicon-based materials. We are thrilled about the potential of this new capacity and are confident that it will drive innovation and excellence at HPQ Silicon Inc. further solidifying our position in the market.
