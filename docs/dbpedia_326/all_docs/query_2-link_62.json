        "text": "Patented fuel additive developed by the Chevron Corporation\n\nTechronProduct typeFuel additivesOwnerChevron CorporationProduced byChevron CorporationCountryU.S.Introduced1981; 43 years ago ( )MarketsMotor serviceWebsitetechron.com\n\nTechron is a patented fuel additive developed by Chevron Corporation and sold in its fuel operations (including Texaco and Caltex). It contains a polyether amine-based detergent, which is purported to dissolve deposits in automotive engines and prevent them from building up. Chevron released Techron as an additive in 1981, and began including it in all of their gasoline products in 1995. It is still available as a concentrate today.[1][2]\n\nThe Chevron Cars debuted in 1995 and were used to advertise the additive.\n\nComponents\n\n[edit]\n\nTechron consists of five components:[3][failed verification]\n\nDistillates, hydrotreated light at 40-70% weight\n\nStoddard solvent at 15-40% weight\n\nSolvent naphtha (petroleum), light aromatic at 5-10% weight\n\n1,2,4-trimethylbenzene at 1-5% weight\n\nPolyetheramine (PEA) (detergent), polyether amines at 20-49% weight\n\nPredecessor\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Techroline\" was the predecessor to Techron. The company claimed it could control combustion-chamber deposits in cars,[4] as well as keep their fuel-intake systems clean.[5]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of automotive fuel brands\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
