        "text": "AE Techron’s 9100 Series amplifiers are 200Vp, DC-to-250 kHz capable amplifiers that offer a unique combination of switch-mode efficiency and linear-amplifier-like fidelity in a single, compact package. They are able to drive virtually any type of load without a reduction in rated power, with low distortion and low DC drift. They are also fast enough to meet 5µs surge and dropout requirements.\n\nThe 9100 series is a powerful and flexible partner when the environment is difficult or existing AC Mains options are limited. It is able to be powered from any normal single-phase AC mains voltage (100VAC — 250VAC). It is power-efficient, producing up to 2,000 watts output from a 20A, 120V AC mains supply, and up to 5 kW from 230V or 240V sources.\n\nThis combination of features makes the 9100 series an ideal solution for a wide range of High-Current, Low-Voltage applications that require both DC power and quick surges or drop-outs, like those found in conducted immunity testing of DC-powered systems in the automotive and aviation markets.\n\nFeatures:\n\nBandwidth: DC to 250 kHz\n\nMinimum Drop/Rise Time: 5µs\n\nSlew Rate: Up to 300 V/µs\n\nMax Voltage: 0 to 200 Vp\n\nMax Current: Up to 50 to 150 Ap\n\nDistortion: <0.8%\n\nMax Long-Term Power: 5 kW to 30 kW (up to 60kVA)\n\nStable when driving highly capacitive loads.\n\nFour-quadrant operation\n\nAE Techron’s 7224 Power Amplifiers are configurable and flexible making it the choice of many research and university labs. It can be field-configured to run well into loads from 100 ohms to as low as 0.5 ohms.

The 8700 series provides a unique combination of the advantages of switch-mode and linear amplifiers. Unlike traditional switch-mode amplifiers which have a ripple frequency between 80 kHz and 100 kHz, the 8700 series has an effective switch frequency of 1 MHz. This ultra-high-frequency switching gives the 8700 amplifier many benefits over both linear (dissipative) amplifiers and traditional switch-mode amplifiers. Switch-mode efficiency is combined with a Low Noise Floor and THD, while also benefiting from High Slew Rates and Wide Bandwidth. The 8700 series is also able to safely drive both reactive and resistive loads of varying impedances with no loss in rated output power.\n\nFeatures:\n\nBandwidth: DC to 250KHz\n\nVoltage Output: 0 to 250 VRMS; 0 to 350 VDC\n\nCurrent Output: Up to 60 to 360 ARMS\n\nPower: 4 kW to 24 kW (up to 120kVA)\n\nSlew rate: Up to 300 V/µs\n\nDistortion: <0.8%\n\nPower levels up to 5X rated power when driving Reactive Loads\n\nAE Techron’s 8500 Series Amplifiers are 400Vp, Low-Noise, DC-to-50 kHz Switch-Mode Amplifiers. Unlike traditional switch-mode amplifiers which has a ripple frequency between 80 kHz and 100 kHz, the 8500 series has an effective switch frequency of 1 MHz. This ultra-high-frequency switching gives the 8500 amplifier many benefits over both linear (dissipative) amplifiers and traditional switch-mode amplifiers. Switch-mode efficiency is combined with a Low Noise floor and THD, while also benefitting from High Slew Rates and Wide Bandwidth. The 8500 series is also able to safely drive both reactive and resistive loads of varying impedances with no loss in rated output power.\n\nFeatures:\n\nBandwidth: DC to 50KHz\n\nVoltage Output: 0 to 250 VRMS; 0 to 350 VDC\n\nCurrent Output: Up to 80 to 480 ARMS\n\nPower: 4 kW to 24 kW (up to 120kVA)\n\nSlew rate: Up to 80 V/µs\n\nDistortion: <0.2%\n\nPower levels up to 5X rated power when driving Reactive Loads\n\nAE Techron’s 8300 Series Amplifiers are 200Vp, Low-Noise, DC to 50 kHz Switch-Mode Amplifiers.

The 7800 Series Amplifiers are a great solution if bandwidth and/or system noise is a problem. They are able to drive low-impedance loads at frequencies of up to 60kHz. Because they utilise a linear circuit topology, the AE Techron 7800 series amplifiers have no switching noise in their output and very low radiated EMI. This results in THD and noise floors that are much lower than what is possible with traditional switch mode amplifiers, making them ideal for applications that require either high precision or, because of sensitive measurements, cannot tolerate the radiated noise associated with switch mode amplifiers.\n\nThe 7800 series amplifiers are tough, both physically and electrically. The 7800 series models have been used for conducting experiments on a Navy warship, controlling a magnetic field in a fusion experiment, and driving DUTs while absorbing back EMF when there is a failure.\n\nBandwidth: DC to 60KHz\n\nVoltage Output: 500Vp\n\nCurrent Output: 400Ap (800Ap Short Period)\n\nPower: 10kVA, 15kVA or 20kVA\n\nAE Techron’s 7700-Series amplifiers offer great power and flexibility. The series consists of three models; each model can be used as a free-standing gain block or combined in multiples to achieve high voltage (300 V RMS at 50 A RMS) or high current (up to 340A at 13.5 VDC continuously).\n\nThe 7794 was designed with a very low output impedance and is able to produce up to 60A continuous at 13.8 VDC, making it an excellent battery substitute for transient immunity testing. It is also capable of producing the 80V surges required for DO-160G section 16.6.2.4 abnormal surge testing and is well suited for ISO 7637 pulse 2b and 4 testing.\n\nThe 7796, when run in controlled-current mode, is a perfect choice to drive medium to large diameter Helmholtz coils and radiatiors like those specified in Ford FMC1278 (RI140, RI150).\n\nThe 7796HC can be used to simulate ripple noise, drop outs, surges and ground shift noise as required by a variety of standards for DC powered electronics in the aviation and automotive industries. With configurations capable of up to 600A, a DC-150 kHz bandwidth, and the ability to both source and sink, the 7796HC is your best solution for high-current DC Conducted Immunity testing.\n\nUp to 5000 watts RMS power output\n\nSmall signal response up to 250KHz\n\nUp to 85A at 13.5 VDC\n\nSeries or Parallel system capability\n\nOutput voltages up to ±180 Vp\n\nAE Techron’s DSR 100 Series systems provide complete, single-box solutions for immunity testing. They include a simple-to-use yet powerful standards waveform generator matched with an industry leading power supply technology and come with an extensive library of tests for many automotive and industry standards.\n\nAll models of the DSR 100 Series are 4-quadrant, allowing them to source and sink current. The DSR Series has power in reserve; each model provides continuous DC power as rated, and is able to provide 4X rated power for in-rush testing up to 200 mS, as is required in DO 160 Section 16.\n\nCurrent Ranges: 0-200A\n\nPeak Current to 800A\n\nSignal Range: DC – 300KHz\n\nThe 3110 is a simple-to-use yet powerful standards waveform generator. It can be combined with other AE Techron products to quickly create a wide range of powerful and intelligent EMC test solutions.\n\nThe 3110 comes with an extensive library of tests for many automotive and industry Standards. Tests can be modified and saved for future use in the 3110’s library, which has the space to store more than 300,000 tests total.\n\nThe 3110 produces standard signals and waveforms with or without a DC offset. Frequency, amplitude and DC offset can be fixed or swept, and sweeps can be linear, logarithmic or exponential.* It can create dropouts and surges with rise and fall times under 1 µs. Individual signal duration can be as short as 50 µs or as long as 49 days. It can also produce ripple waveforms of up to 300 kHz.\n\nThe 3110 offers unique and powerful controls that make it easy to build complex tests containing repeating waveforms with up to four variables concurrently changing. Tests with non-linear or equation-driven frequency/ voltage/duration increments also can be created automatically using the csv import function. In addition, tests can be imported from the 3110 library and linked to form multi-test programs that can also be set to repeat, loop or wait for a trigger.\n\nCurrent Ranges: 0-200A\n\nPeak Current to 800A\n\nSignal Range: DC – 300KHz\n\nThe T1000 Magnetic-Field Susceptibility Transformer was designed to exceed the AF Magnetic Field susceptibility test requirements of DO 160 Section 19 and Boeing D6-16050 Section 7.2.
