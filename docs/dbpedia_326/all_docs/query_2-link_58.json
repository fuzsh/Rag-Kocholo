        "text": "When the BMW system cleaner was introduced at a dealer meeting, the claims were.\n\nCleans injectors and carbs.\n\nAnti-oxidant for car and motorcycle fuel strip life.\n\nFuel preservative\n\nOctane booster.\n\nHis stuff has been magical in both carb and FI use.\n\nBoth at the dealership I worked at and in my own garage.\n\nI use it to this day.\n\nThe Naptha in the cleaner would probably be the reason the octane got boosted.\n\nI found my file of the MSDS (SDS) sheet from BMW.\n\nIf anyone wants it, I'll email it to you.\n\nWill Tectron repair any damage caused by PO's use of ethanol-laced gas? Although it is more expensive to use 100% gas, I am now using it in both my Beemers. I've run some Seafoam in a couple times.\n\nMorning Roger\n\nDepends on: what damage was done using ethanol-laced gas. 10% ethanol gasoline shouldn't have damaged anything unless the bike sat in storage for a long time with sour ethanol gasoline in it.\n\nI don't know anything of the riding habits of the first 2 owners, other than the bike was obviously not well-maintained by the first owner, as evidenced by the numerous items changed at the 48K maintenance--leaking gas tank, leaking oil window, no fluid in the rear shock, etc. 2nd owner paid almost $1900 for that maintenance but mostly let the cycle sit for the year he owned it but says he kept the new battery on a trickle charger. (The \"new\" battery would not charge past 12.6V when I first bought it, so a new MotoBatt went in.) When my friend Michael did a once over, he found the starter to be dragging, throttle bodies way out of balance, clutch linkage too tight and a couple other items which a prudent owner (or BMW mechanic) would have maintained or known about. So, a valve adjustment, TB sync, fluid in the shock, new brake linings, new starter and I have myself a fine running R1100RT. I know about the inherent failure of Hall Sensor wiring and am keeping my fingers crossed I can get another 20K miles or so before having to tear into that project. I bought the bike to ride, not work on. Also, another friend's final drive bearing failed on his trip back from Key West (to NC) and left him stranded but close enough to Daytona to be towed to a BMW shop for bearing replacement."
