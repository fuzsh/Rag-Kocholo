They are fast enough for DC automotive dropout testing and capable of AC voltages required for ISO 61000 and Aviation testing. Plus, they have low enough noise and distortion specifications to be the reference power source in power quality measurements. When driving reactive loads, the AE Techron 8508 is capable of receiving, reprocessing and returning to the load up to 5X its rated power. The result is a bench top system capable of 20 kVA+ output while drawing less than 4 kW of AC mains power!\n\nThe AE Techron 8508 amplifiers are capable of reproducing AC, DC and AC+DC waveforms into loads from a dead short to high impedance. They can be used to simulate a battery at 13.5 VDC or be an AC source with a L-N potential of up to 250 VAC. Rated current, for a given voltage, is available for all waveform types (AC, DC or AC+DC) at frequencies from DC to 50 kHz. Voltages from 0 to 250 VRMS are available with no changes in configuration.\n\nSpecifications for the AE TECHRON 8508 High-Power Digital Amplifier Include:\n\nBandwidth DC to 50 kHz Voltage 0 to 250 Vrms; 0 to 350 VDC Current 200A Power 8 kVA\n\nSee Datasheet for full specifications"
