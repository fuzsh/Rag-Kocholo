        "text": "For more than 30 years, Amplifier Research has been building a reputation for quality, consistency, and dependability. AR has become the number one EMC test equipment provider by thoroughly understanding their customer's needs and responding with innovative solutions that make test procedures easier, more efficient and more reliable.\n\nAR manufactures broadband high-power amplifiers from dc to 40GHz (from 1 to 50,000 watts). These amplifiers are primarily used for radiated and conducted susceptibility testing but are equally suitable for general laboratory use (component testing, plasma studies, mass spectroscopy and heating). Available test accessories include antennas, directional couplers, field monitoring equipment, power meters and precompliance EMC systems. A line of transient generators for IEC, automotive, telecom, medical and component testing is also available. These transient generators offer the capability to meet test routines to spec, modify existing spec-based routines (already programmed in) or design your own.\n\nAnritsu is the industry standard for RF and Microwave Test and Measurement equipment for both field and lab environments, with instruments operating at all frequencies up to 110 GHz and beyond. Our handheld Site Master Cable and Antenna Analyzer, for example, enables field technicians to troubleshoot microwave cables and communication systems and detect problems before they become costly, time-consuming system failures. Other products are suitable for R&D and manufacturing applications, providing extremely accurate measurements of power, network analysis, signal analysis and frequency.\n\nAnritsu offers a complete range of test and measurement equipment for the optical communications industry including R&D, production, installation, monitoring, and manufacturing. Anritsu is a recognized leader in high-speed optical technology offerings and field test solutions including evaluating a wide range of optical devices and fiber systems like DWDM. Critical measurements such as OTDR, Chromatic Dispersion, Polarization Mode Dispersion, Loss Test Set, and Optical Return Loss can be made quickly and accurately to maximize network performance and accelerate the deployment of new services.\n\nBoonton Electronics Corporation is a manufacturer of test equipment dedicated to measuring the power of RF and microwave systems used in both military and commercial sectors. The company also manufactures impedance measuring instruments, RF voltmeters and audio analyzers.\n\nThe company's products are used to test terrestrial and satellite communications, radar telemetry, electronic warfare (EW), electronic countermeasures (ECM), and an expanding number of wireless communications products.\n\nSignal Microwave is a manufacturing and consulting company located in Chandler, Arizona. The company was founded by Engineers with decades of experience and a proven track record of designing and building RF/microwave connectors and test boards. Our primary mission is creating solutions for the Signal Integrity/High Speed Digital market. The company is moving beyond the technology developed by traditional microwave connector manufacturers to create innovative new connector and PC board products. All products are fabricated and assembled in the USA and France using military grade materials and processes."
