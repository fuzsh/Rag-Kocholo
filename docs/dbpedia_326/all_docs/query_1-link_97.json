        "text": "The AE Techron’s 3110 is a simpleto-use yet powerful standards waveform generator. It can be combined with other AE Techron products to quickly create a wide range of powerful and intelligent EMC test solutions.\n\nIncludes a large library of Automotive and Industry Standards' test routines\n\nIntuitive drag and drop interface makes it easy to update existing standards or create tests for new standards\n\nEasy import from csv file; automatically create tests with non-linear or equation-driven frequency/voltage/duration increments\n\nFast, per-step calibration\n\nCan be used as a free-standing test system or connected to an Ethernet network and controlled remotely\n\nAE Techron 3110 Key System Features\n\nThe AE Techron 3110 monitors AE Techron 7220- and 7700-series amplifier status and will automatically abort a test if a fault condition occurs.\n\nOutput voltages are entered into the AE Techron 3110 which automatically scales its output to achieve the requested voltage at the output of the amplifier.\n\nThe AE Techron 3110 has provisions for system (3110 + amplifier) DC offset and gain correction.\n\nModular construction allows you to create a system with the voltage and current needed. If, at some point in the future, test requirements change, you are able to add to or change the system as needed.\n\nDC System Example\n\n3110 + 7224\n\nDC System Example\n\n3110 + 2 x 7796\n\nAC System Example\n\n3110 + 3 x 7548\n\n13.5 / 14 / 18 VDC\n\n15A continuous\n\n30A surge\n\n±80 VDC voltage potential\n\n13.5 / 14 / 18 VDC\n\n120A continuous\n\n400A surge\n\n±100 VDC voltage potential\n\n115 / 230 VRMS\n\n16A continuous (at 115V or above)\n\n50 ARMS surge\n\n0 - 380 VRMS voltage potential\n\nAE Techron 3110 Standards Library\n\nThe AE Techron 3110 comes with an extensive library of tests for many automotive and industry Standards. Tests can be modified and saved for future use in the AE Techron 3110’s library, which has the space to store more than 300,000 tests total.\n\nAE Techron 3110 BUILD A TEST\n\nTests are created by combining Wave segments and/or Control segments together. An individual segment within a test, can be as short as 50 µS or as long as 49 days.\n\nWAVE CONTROLS like Fixed Loop, Variable Loop,and Trigger make the AE Techron 3110 able to reproduce the most complex standards. The test shown above highlights several key abilities made possible by these wave controls. A multi-step waveform can start at one level/ condition, then be repeated, with up to 4 variables changing. Single or multi-step waveforms can be made to repeat (or loop) and these repeating (looping) waveforms can be nested within a larger simple or repeating waveform. At any point during a simple or repeating wave form, it is possible to cause the program to stop (either holding the previous condition or muting) and wait for an external trigger.\n\nAE Techron 3110 Performance\n\nThe AE Techron 3110 produces standard signals and waveforms with or without a DC offset. Frequency, amplitude and DC offset can be fixed or swept, and sweeps can be linear, logarithmic or exponential.* It can create dropouts and surges with rise and fall times under 1 µs. Individual signal duration can be as short as 50 µs or as long as 49 days. It can also produce ripple waveforms of up to 300 kHz.\n\n*Logarithmic sweeps available for Sine, Ripple and DC waveforms ionly.\n\nAE Techron 3110 BUILD A SYSTEM\n\nTogether, the AE Techron 3110 and 7000-series amplifiers create a powerful, modular test system. When used for automotive testing, test system capabilities include 13.5 VDC with a surge potential of up to 100V, or continuous power ratings from 15A to 240A DC. For aviation testing, system capabilities include 14 VDC/28 VDC or 115 VAC/230 VAC with surge voltages up to 360 VAC.\n\nAE Techron 3110 Signal Control\n\nThe AE Techron 3110 offers unique and powerful controls that make it easy to build complex tests containing repeating waveforms with up to four variables concurrently changing. Tests with non-linear or equation-driven frequency/ voltage/duration increments also can be created automatically using the csv import function.\n\nIn addition, tests can be imported from the AE Techron 3110 library and linked to form multi-test programs that can also be set to repeat, loop or wait for a trigger.\n\nAE Techron 3110 Multi-amp Systems\n\nThe 3110 and AE Techron amplifiers can be used together to create powerful test systems. All AE Techron 7000-series amplifiers can be easily configured into series or parallel systems for a wide range of voltage and current capabilities.\n\nSeries system capabilities include surges up to 360 VAC, and parallel systems can be capable of up to 240A DC.\n\nTechnical Details - Hardware Output channels 1 Output Voltage 10 Vpk Signal Generation\n\nDAC:\n\n18 bit\n\nDC – 20 kHz (any wave form)\n\n1 µs rise time\n\nSine: 14 bit\n\nDC – 300 kHz\n\n400 Msps\n\n0.01 Hz frequency resolution or better\n\n0.002° phase granularity Amplitude 76 µV resolution Frequency Stability: ±50 ppm\n\nAccuracy: ±0.1% Control, Status, I/O Front Panel On/Off/Breaker Signal Output BNC (analog - 10Vp) LED Displays Power, System Fault, Signal-In Enabled Back Panel Power Connection 120VAC: IEC cable with NEMA 5-15\n\n230VAC: IEC cable with CEE 7/7 Fuse 2A, 250V slow blow (5 mm) Physical Characteristics Chassis The AE Techron 3110 is designed for table-top or rack-mounted operation.
