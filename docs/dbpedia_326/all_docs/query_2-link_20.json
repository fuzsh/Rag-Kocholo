How that help us or if it does at all is anyone's guess.\n\nIt doesn't help in this instance, and it shows that an SDS is produced for a very different reason. The proprietary ingredient isn't likely relevant for that purpose.\n\nBeyond that, no manufacturer ever reveals trade secrets in a PDS.\n\nIt doesn't help in this instance, and it shows that an SDS is produced for a very different reason.

Wouldn't they do the same thing? Since the injectors are part of the fuel system, wouldn't the fuel system cleaner clean them as well as other parts of the system?\n\nWhat are you running for gasoline? You don't want it or need it. It may loose the hounds of ^$#!\n\nOk, I guess what I'm saying is it is relevant that the ingredient is on one SDS but not the other.\n\nI'm not really sure what you're point is otherwise?\n\nMy point is that an SDS is for firefighters, shippers and first-responders to assess safety hazards with a product. Manufacturers are allowed to hide trade secrets on an SDS if it isn't relevant to the safety of the product. If it is on one but not the other, then it really comes down to who wrote the sheet. Back in another life I used to write them for a company, and if I was directed to not disclose some compound that didn't affect firefighters or medical personnel then that's what I would do. SDS do not have to disclose everything in the product.\n\nMy point is that an SDS is for firefighters, shippers and first-responders to assess safety hazards with a product.

Back in another life I used to write them for a company, and if I was directed to not disclose some compound that didn't affect firefighters or medical personnel then that's what I would do.\n\nI feel we've had the same discussion/disagreement on other posts. For reference I have written them as well, fairly recently.\n\nYou can use 'trade secret' and 'proprietary' on anything you don't want to disclose yes. And in general, yes, an SDS is not the ideal place to get composition information.\n\nBut in this instance if one product has 'trade secret' listed and the other does not...the same manufacturer...Can we not make some kind of conclusion?\n\nEspecially when we have some general knowledge of what a fuel system cleaner is vs. fuel injector cleaner?\n\nAnd an amine (PEA) is a bit different in chemical composition and safety consideration from petroleum/naptha (and related compounds).\n\nSo, that's why we see it generally included.\n\nSo, if the requirements for fuel injectors are different from those required in the rest of the fuel system, might the Complete Fuel System Cleaner have a detrimental effect on the injectors? Or would the injector cleaner have little or no effect on the rest of the fuel system?\n\nThe fuel system cleaner will take care of the injectors as well. The fuel injector cleaner will have no effect on the rest of the fuel system.\n\nSo, if the requirements for fuel injectors are different from those required in the rest of the fuel system, might the Complete Fuel System Cleaner have a detrimental effect on the injectors? Or would the injector cleaner have little or no effect on the rest of the fuel system?\n\nJust some sage advice. Don't put Techron in you old Camry. I had problems with many vehicles using this stuff. If you are using top tier fuel, this is completely unnecessary."
