        "text": "The main difference is additive concentration and rate of deposit clean up. Over multiple fill-ups, Chevron fuels with Techron® will help clean deposits on intake valves and minimize harmful combustion chamber deposits. When added to a full tank of gasoline, a bottle of Techron® results in an additive concentration up to 10 times stronger than Chevron fuels with Techron®, which provides a much quicker clean-up of intake valve deposits left by lower quality gasolines. The high concentration of Techron® also reduces combustion chamber deposits, which can help eliminate deposit-related engine knock or power loss.\n\nPlease follow the bottle’s instruction guide. For best practice, pour the recommended treat of Techron® into a nearly empty tank, then top off the tank with quality fuel. This helps to facilitate mixing and maximize effectiveness. If your tank is half or all the way full, it is best to wait until your next fill-up. Detailed instructions are also available on our YouTube video.\n\nNo, using a high quality, premium fuel additive like Techron® will generally not void your car’s warranty. Enacted by the federal government, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is intended to protect consumers’ rights, including, among other things, the right to use aftermarket fuel treatments. In fact, using Techron® in a new vehicle is a good preventative measure to keep that new fuel system clean and deposit-free. It also helps to maintain the gas mileage that your new vehicle is designed to deliver.\n\nThere is no harm in using Techron® Complete Fuel System Cleaner in high mileage vehicles, however we recommend using Techron® High Mileage Fuel System Cleaner for vehicles with over 75,000 miles. That’s because Techron® High Mileage Fuel System Cleaner is formulated differently with the addition of corrosion inhibitors to protect fuel system components from corrosion, which is more common in engines with higher mileage. Techron® High Mileage Fuel System Cleaner can also be used in vehicles with less than 75,000 miles and will provide the same performance benefits as Techron® Complete Fuel System Cleaner.\n\nIf you regularly use a high-quality gasoline such as Chevron, Texaco or Caltex gasolines with Techron, using a bottle of Techron® Complete Fuel System Cleaner every season will achieve the best possible results. It’s similar to getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist a few times a year, it gives you that deep clean that regular brushing can’t achieve.\n\nIf you occasionally fill up with lower quality gasoline, you should use Techron® to help clean up deposits that can build up over time and negatively impact the performance of your vehicle. If you have a sensitive vehicle or you use it regularly under severe conditions, you may also benefit from using Techron®. Additionally, if you are buying a used vehicle and you're not sure of its history, Techron will help clean up harmful deposits in the engine and fuel system.\n\nTechron® is proven effective in a wide range of field tests against the competition. At Chevron, we routinely look at competitors' products on the shelf and compare them against the performance of Techron®. Some competitor products either completely lack or have very little of the key detergents found in Techron®. And unlike some competitors, Chevron has test results to back up every performance claim. That explains why engine manufacturers and professional mechanics worldwide use Techron to solve deposit-related problems."
