        "text": "As I have posted in other threads, I have had hard starting problems with my car for sometime. When cold and when sitting for short periods after running, my engine cranks many times before actually starting, usually as long as 5 seconds. During this time and especially when warm, there is a slight smell of fuel in the air. There is also black smoke present in the exhaust during and immediately after a hot start. Because of this, and because there are no other symptoms, I am thus concluding that one or more of my injectors could be leaking fuel after shutdown.\n\nIt seems that if the injector malfunction is being caused by dissolvable deposits, a cleaner could restore proper operation. After much reading at bobistheoilguy.com, it seems like my best option could be the gasoline additive fuel system cleaner Chevron Techron concentrate. Many have reported this product to have good injector and even CC cleaning properties while being safe to nylon, plastic, rubber, and other fuel system components. I have also been informed that Chevron Techron will not foul the spark plugs as some cleaners could which as you know is important due to how hard the plugs are to change in this vehicle.\n\nI would therefore like to ask if anyone has any significant evidence or reasons against or for the use of this product before I make my final decision. For example, our gas tanks are made out of a special polysilk substrate that could spontaniously combust in the presence of techron mixed with gasoline?\n\nThanks for any info you can provide!\n\nvancouverBC, considered electrical but the symptoms don't seem to add up. It cranks with less time when warm, and runs a little rich starting warm.\n\nThe battery is a new Interstate 1000 CC. Definately ok. Charge is ok also.. alternator is ok.\n\nI really think its a bleedoff problem, just trying to isolate it. So far the parts in the fuel system that I am aware of which could cause this problem are FPR, injectors, clogged fuel filter (lean), slow fuel pump (lean), and if we have one a bad check valve.\n\nFuel in the gas indicates it can only be something which is leaking fuel into the combustion chamber after shutdown.\n\nNAPA has a better fuel injection cleaner made by Echlin, i belive it is part number 2-18480 but i could be wrong on that. but it's the one that come in a 2 bottle package. The techron is good also, But the thing about ANY of the Fuel injection cleaners that you pour into the tank, is that they are primarily for PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE, not designed to cure a problem at already exists. The reason for this is that any chemicals strong enough to actually clean out a clogged injector are too harsh for the in tank fuel pump and could damage it. You have 2 options in this case..... have your injectors cleaned professionally in the car..... they disable your fuel pump and attatch a fitting directly to the schrader valve on your fuel rail, and run the car on a very high strength injector cleaner..... OR there may be a shop in your area that has an \"ultrasonic\" fuel injector cleaner. You have to remove the injectors, but the flow rate and spray pattern can be observed after cleaning so you KNOW they are working properly. I had this done on a firebird i had with the 5.7 TPI engine.... i think it cost about $125 for all 8 injectors but that's a fraction of the cost of replacing them.\n\nI just finished a tankful of a second bottle of Techron. The only pattern I am finding to this is that my crank time has increased[i/] after adding each of the two bottles.\n\nMy car is now taking longer to crank after the second bottle than it was after the first, which was longer than before I used any.\n\nDoes this provide any clues? Could it be unrelated to the injector cleaner?\n\nAlthough I wasn't anticipating anything specific, these results from the Techron were certainly unanticipated.. lol.\n\nThanks for your help so far.."
