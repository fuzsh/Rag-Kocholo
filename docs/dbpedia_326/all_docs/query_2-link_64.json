        "text": "AE TECHRON products on www.4test.no\n\nAE TECHRON Amplifier Selector Page\n\nBeginnings\n\nAE Techron, was founded as Audio Electronics Inc., in August of 1992, by former employees of the Techron division of Crown.\n\nIts purpose has been to create high-quality, durable electronic products for research, the military and industry—including EMC testing, MRI/NMR and the power relay test industries.\n\nOut of this work has come lines of reliable power amplifiers, test systems and test and measurement products, and an inventory of electronic building blocks that helps us to provide quick-to-market custom electronic solutions for our customers. This is indicated by the figure shown below.\n\nFocus - More Than Just an EMC Manufacturer\n\nAE Techron (AET) is recognized as a company providing leading edge EMC solution. However, their products serves a much larger marked.\n\nTo see where AET fits in the bigger picture, it is important to understand their core capabilities.\n\nYears ago, Crown Amplifiers reigned supreme for their high fidelity and durability. Their Techron division earned a reputation for powering GE MRI machines with unparalleled accuracy and reliability.\n\nToday, AET have carved out a niche in the “Mid-Frequency” space, renowned for their low noise, robust construction, cost-effectiveness, and exceptional technical support. However, their industry standing extends far beyond just EMC.\n\nAET operates in a unique space where solutions between DC and 1 MHz are often required and sometimes customized. These solutions necessitate clean power with the industry’s best low-noise floor, leading to many applications beyond EMC. Here are just a few examples:\n\nResearch projects typically at university physics and electrical engineering departments.\n\nMilitary applications such as sonar and warship communications\n\nImaging applications like NMR, MRI, MPI; in research and manufacturing\n\nMagnetic applications such as subsurface geological surveys, underground pipeline inspection, and even nuclear fusion (think plasma containment)\n\nIndustrial power for shaker manufacturers (many need our power solutions)\n\nThe common need for all these opportunities is:\n\nOperating between DC and 1 MHz\n\nDriving low impedance\n\nTechnical guidance and innovative solutions\n\nLow noise\n\nSteady Growth\n\nAE Techron has grown steadily since its beginnings and now consists of four separate product and service areas:\n\nAE Techron standard power supplies, power amplifiers, and test systems.\n\nAE Techron custom design and manufacturing services.\n\nRepair of Techron and AE Techron products.\n\nRepair of Crown legacy audio products."
