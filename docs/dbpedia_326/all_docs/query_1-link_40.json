I bought only this gas for the entire 17 years of my ownership (since new) of my old 2001 330Ci.

But fuel trims were still up around 10% at idle. After a few hours driving with the Techron, they are down to 2-3%. And, as I said, idle is smoother.\n\nRegards,\n\nRay L.\n\n0 Reply\n\n2627 posts ·\n\n#6 ·\n\nTop Tier Gasoline was started in 2004.\n\nTOP TIER™ is recommended by the following:\n\nAudi\n\nBMW\n\nGM\n\nFCA\n\nFord\n\nHonda\n\nToyota\n\nMercedes-Benz\n\nNavistar\n\nVW\n\nDetroit Diesel\n\nTop Tier gas will keep your intake valves, combustion chamber and piston tops cleaner.\n\nMany Brands are now Top Tier.\n\nhttps://www.toptiergas.com/licensed-brands/\n\nAAA did a good test of Top Tier and non Top Tier gasoline\n\nhttp://www.aaa.com/AAA/common/AAR/files/Fuel-Quality-Full-Report.pdf\n\n19911 posts ·\n\n#8 ·\n\ni just skimmed the article , did they say the brands for all 6 tested?\n\nShow more replies\n\n0 Reply\n\n29010 posts ·\n\n#9 ·\n\nOP, I've been running Techron a few times a years for the last 23 years of my 3-series ownership.

Works exceedingly well before a fill up , then a long highway blast for hours. BG's version is quite good, but really is dealt more through dealers and shops. Unfortunately, in the PNW, the quality of the petrol is terrible(Ethanol is terrible). Techron really helps to keep the car in check.\n\nregards\n\n28806 posts ·\n\n#16 ·\n\nI, too, do my best to avoid \"snake oils,\" but people try too hard and overreach when they go TECHRON/SEAFOAM GIMMICK. Don't pay attention to the brand name or the bottle or the colors (jerseys) but the active ingredients. All these products are more or less solvents (cleaners)\n\nSo think of washing your very dirty hands with water and a tiny bit of soap. Hands still dirty? You add more soap and then your hands are magically clean. No surprises, right?\n\nNow the trick is to wash your hands often with warm water and a little bit of soap so they don't have a chance to get so dirty so you won't need to use a sh!t ton of soap.\n\nThe analogy to this is drive your cars hard and often, use top tier gas, and change the oil and filter often and you should be fine.\n\nBad practices and habits will eventually lead to you needing additional products to keep you clean.\n\nIn theory you should never need any of those cleaner products if you just are really anal about *everything* but should you need them, they are fine and *can* help.\n\n464 posts ·\n\n#17 ·\n\nTechron has been an accepted engine cleaner for BMW engines for the 27 years or so that I've owned BMWs. As far back as my e28 ('88 535is) I can remember dealer and independent techs recommending Techron every couple of fillups, just to counteract any bad batches of gas, even from top tier suppliers.\n\n19911 posts ·\n\n#19 ·\n\nthat could amount to two bottles a week, crazy overkill\n\n0 Reply\n\n28806 posts ·\n\n#18 ·\n\nApparently Hyundai also sells their fuel cleaner as rebranded Techron. I guess a lot of brands do this.\n\n29010 posts ·\n\n#20 ·\n\nMango, you should try two tanks of Techron back-to-back. I think that you, of all people, will notice a slightly cleaner, brighter note coming from 'things' that are slightly cleaner. Without that little bit of extra cleaning your injectors might well accumulate little micro deposits. I know your holes wouldn't ever plug, but I think you'll notice a difference as fluid flows freely without microscopic interference of its flow. Cleaner is almost always better...unless you're then slathering something like gummi pflege over it. (I'll buy you a beer someday if you don't think you can hear it 'singing' a slightly happier note. )\n\n28806 posts ·\n\n#21 ·\n\nThe tank in my car is 11.9 gallons.

Vertical video is satan spawn\n\n12956 posts ·\n\n#31 ·\n\nOne thing we need to realize is the Techron doesn’t burn as well as gas. Why?? It’s a cleaner and not a fuel. What happens is unburned Techron gets passed the piston rings and contaminates the oil. So, fill the car up with top tier gas and a bottle of Techron to clean things up but change the oil and filter after you’ve burned most of the fuel+Techron.\n\n29010 posts ·\n\n#32 ·\n\nI'll have to read the bottle more carefully next time, but I don't recall reading about changing the oil and don't think I ever have.\n\n0 Reply\n\n345 posts ·\n\n#33 ·\n\nNo such warnings\n\nI don't think there is such a warning.\n\nPerhaps, it's something he read and researched from elsewhere.\n\nAttachments\n\n167.4 KB Views: 230\n\n7 posts ·\n\n#34 ·\n\nTechron makes 2 products: Fuel Injector Cleaner and Total Fuel System Clean.
