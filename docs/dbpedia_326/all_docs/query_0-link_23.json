        "text": "PPS plastic exhibits high thermal stability, allowing the material to maintain many of its other desirable performance qualities over a broad temperature range.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following technical specifications are based on tests performed on Techtron® 1000 PPS, a standard, unfilled grade of polyphenylene sulfide shapes from Mitsubishi Chemical Group.\n\nPPS heat deflection temperature\n\nThe heat deflection temperature (HDT) is the temperature at which a plastic sample deforms under load. With a load of 1.8 MPa (264 PSI), polyphenylene sulfide does not deform until 115°C according to ISO 75-1/2 or 250°F according to ASTM D648.\n\nMaximum allowable service temperature for PPS\n\nPolyphenylene sulfide parts can withstand a continuous service temperature of 220°C or 425°F (20,000 hours in air).\n\nPPS melting point\n\nPPS has a melting temperature of 280°C according to ISO 11357-1/-3 testing, or 540°F according to ASTM D3418 testing.\n\nPPS thermal conductivity\n\nThermal conductivity is a measure of a plastic's capacity to transfer heat via conduction. PPS plastics exhibit higher thermal conductivity than PEEK materials, but lower thermal conductivity than PE and PTFE materials.\n\nAt 23°C / 73°F, PPS displays the following thermal conductivity values:\n\nISO - 0.3 W/(K.m)\n\nASTM - 2 BTU in./(hr.ft².°F)\n\nPPS flammability and fire resistance properties\n\nPolyphenylene sulfide is an inherently flame-resistant material that can achieve UL 94 V-0 flammability ratings without any additional fillers or additives. According to ISO 4589-1/2, unfilled PPS has an oxygen index of 44%.\n\nPPS coefficient of linear thermal expansion\n\nThe coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE) is used to determine the rate at which a material expands as a function of temperature.\n\nGenerally speaking, PPS displays a lower CLTE than other engineering plastics in a similar price range, such as PET and POM. This characteristic makes PPS an excellent lower-cost alternative to pricier materials like PEEK and PAI in applications requiring great dimensional stability at moderate-to-high temperatures.\n\nA highly dimensionally stable plastic with great mechanical strength, polyphenylene exhibits ideal mechanical properties for load bearing applications and complex parts requiring heavy machining.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following technical specifications are based on tests performed on Techtron® 1000 PPS, a standard, unfilled grade of polyphenylene sulfide shapes from Mitsubishi Chemical Group.\n\nPPS density\n\nUnfilled PPS has a density around 1.35 g/cm³. Reinforced PPS grades typically have a higher density, reaching 1.66 g/cm³ in the case of PPS that is 40% glass-fiber reinforced.\n\nPPS tensile strength\n\nCompared to other engineering plastics in the same price category, PPS plastics exhibit high tensile strength. This means the material can withstand high levels of stress before breaking. Techtron® 1000 PPS has the following values for tensile strength, strain, and elasticity according to ISO 527-1/-2 and ASTM D638:\n\nTensile Strength Testing PPS\n\nISO 427-1/-2 ASTM D638 Tensile strength 102 MPa 13,500 PSI Tensile strain at yield 12% 3.6% Tensile strain at break 12% 20% Tensile modulus of elasticity 4,000 MPa 500 KSI\n\nPPS compressive strength\n\nPolyphenylene sulfide shapes exhibit a compressive strength of approximately 21,500 PSI according to ASTM D695.\n\nHardness and impact strength of PPS\n\nPPS plastic exhibits good hardness and resilience against impact.\n\nRockwell M hardness (ISO 2039-2): 100\n\nRockwell M hardness (ASTM D785): 95\n\nRockwell R hardness (ASTM 2240): 125\n\nCharpy impact strength (unnotched, ISO 179-1/1eU) - no break\n\nCharpy impact strength (notched, ISO 179-1/1eA) - 2.0 kJ/m²\n\nIzod impact (notched, ASTM D256) - 0.60 ft.lb./in\n\nPPS flexural modulus and strength\n\nWith a high flexural modulus and high flexural strength, PPS plastics are good candidates for structural applications where both stiffness and load-bearing capabilities are essential.\n\nFlexural Testing PPS\n\nISO 178 ASTM D790 Flexural strength 155 MPa 21,000 PSI Flexural modulus of elasticity - 575 KSI\n\nPolyphenylene sulfide is an excellent material for applications requiring electrical insulation properties. PPS has a non-polar and semi-crystalline molecular structure which inhibits the movement of electrons. This leads PPS plastic to exhibit high electrical resistance, making it a poor conductor of electricity.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, the following electrical properties of PPS are based on tests performed on Techtron® 1000 PPS, a standard, unfilled grade of polyphenylene sulfide shapes from Mitsubishi Chemical Group.\n\nPPS electric/dielectric strength\n\nElectric strength, also known as dielectric strength, is a measure of a material's ability to withstand electric stress without succumbing to electrical breakdown. This property is a key factor in determining the level of electrical insulation exhibited by a material.\n\nUnfilled PPS has an electric strength around 18 KV/mm according to IEC 60243-1 or 540 Volts/mil according to ASTM D149.\n\nPPS electrical resistivity\n\nResistivity describes the ability of a material to resist the flow of electrical currents across its surface and volume. Polyphenylene sulfide exhibits high resistivity relative to other common engineering plastics, making it a great material for applications requiring reliable insulation.\n\nUnfilled PPS exhibits a surface resistivity of 10E12 Ohm/sq. according to ANSI/ESD STM 11.11 and a volume resistivity of 10E13 Ohm/cm according to IEC 62631-2-1."
