        "text": "I used to use Redline SI-1 which has a similar chemical to that found in Techron. That chemical is (PEA) polyether amines.\n\nIt acts as a surfactant instead of a solvent making it safe for all components in the fuel system. It attacks carbon and deposits like no other, and even survives the combustion process so it can clean O2 sensors, catalytic converters and EGR valves. If you are going to use anything, those that contain PEA are the best.\n\nRedline SI-1\n\nTechron\n\nGumout w/Regane\n\njust to name a few of the big ones. I'm sure there are more.\n\nNow Shell advertises a new nitrogen enriched formula, they are referring to the nitrogen atoms that make up amines.\n\nI will continue to use these products as it has proven itself to be the best of the best. I've brought back a lawnmower, a snowblower, and some guys car from up the street with this stuff. Go ahead and use with confidence.\n\nI used to use an independent Honda shop for my CRX and the service manager said that while they did not believe in the \"mechanic-in-a-can\" idea, they found the Techroline product to be helpful in keeping the components it targets clean. They told me this when I had them clean the throttle body after the idle became rough. I've been using one bottle each time I get the oil changed and never had the throttle body cleaned after that. No, this is not scientific proof that it works. I have several bottles left in the garage and haven't decided if I will use it proactively in my Prius.\n\nOn a related note, I did call the Chevron technical hotline with a related question and the gentleman told me that Techron Concentrate Plus is a better product than Pro Gard.\n\nYMMV\n\nThanks for this. It's like vitamins for your body, my doctor always says you are wasting your money on them but my pharmacist tells me doctors always buy vitamins and CoQ10 from him for their own use. Some dealers and service techs will tell you additives are a waste of money.\n\n@Genoz World--My mechanic friend used to say that Techron was one additive that you wanted to be careful with when it comes to the recommended amount/bottle size per gallons of fuel. I thought he was crazy and put a full bottle in a half tank of fuel on my old S-10 Blazer. The Blazer ran fine for a while and then started to stutter a bit, so I think he was right.\n\nI brought back a friend's car using the old BG (is that right?) additives that you can only buy from a mechanic or full service station. They are great additives.\n\nI also have a friend who had a fuel injection failure on a new Ford Taurus and when the mechanic got done charging him $2,000 for the work he told him that Techron could have helped keep his injectors from getting plugged. My friend uses it religiously. You have to watch it because there is a Chevron additive that looks like Techron, but it isn't. Walmart used to carry the real thing, so be careful.\n\nWhy fuel additives? Oil compaines spend billions of dollars refining their products so they will be the best there is.\n\nI remember when I was a kid back in the 60's there was all types and sizes of snake oil products availaible.\n\nPersonally, I do not use any of them and I have been driving since\n\n1966, and never seen a need for them.\n\nIf there was a clear and concise scientific study I would take a peek at it, but I know of no scientific research where snake oil products do all they claim to do.\n\nal"
