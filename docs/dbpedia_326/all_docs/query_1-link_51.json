Use a graduated cylinder and don't get fooled by the miniscus...maybe use an eye dropper.

Why?? It’s a cleaner and not a fuel. What happens is unburned Techron gets passed the piston rings and contaminates the oil. So, fill the car up with top tier gas and a bottle of Techron to clean things up but change the oil and filter after you’ve burned most of the fuel+Techron.\n\ndmax\n\n· Registered\n\n2016 M235i 6MT\n\nJoined Aug 29, 2006\n\n·\n\n29,010 Posts\n\nOne thing we need to realize is the Techron doesn’t burn as well as gas.

Being a vert, car gets driven around 5 - 7.5K miles / year; a steady 200 mi / week for 3 seasons and then garaged for the winter. (Run a battery tender and I do take the car out once every month or so for 30 minutes to circulate the fluids, etc/\n\nRun Mobil 1 (yeah, I know, lost it's LL-01 certification but I don't care, LOL) and change the oil and filter once a year. Change the airbox filter yearly as well.\n\nRun top-tier mid-grade gas (Sinclair out by me here in UT) and try to run it down to fairly empty at least once every few tankfuls to minimize build-up in the tank.\n\nOnce a year, run the tank down and then a bottle of Techron and 1/2 tank of premium. Run that 1/2 tank out being sure to drive a bit more 'aggressively' (higher revs, heavy on the go pedal, some highway time up around 100 mph steady out in the west desert).\n\nChange the coolant once every 3 years. Plugs / fuel filter every 5 years. Fuel pump was done @ 100K by BMWk\n\nSo far (knock wood) zero problems related to fuel system. Idles like a purring kitten, acceleration is crisp and linear. Never stalled out or gotten stuck.\n\nCan't scientifically prove that the Techron helps; but, heck, its $5 a bottle and easy to find (even WalMart carries it)."
