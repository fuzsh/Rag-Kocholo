Product Overview

Techtron® PPS products offer the broadest resistance to chemicals of any advanced engineering plastic. They have no known solvents below 200 °C (392 °F) and offer inertness to steam, strong bases, fuels and acids. Minimal moisture absorption and a very low coefficient of linear thermal expansion, combined with Mitsubishi Chemical Advanced Materials' proprietary stress relieving processes, make these PPS products ideally suited for precise tolerance machined components. In addition, PPS products exhibit excellent electrical characteristics and are inherently flame retardant.

Technical Details & Test Data

Note

Thermal Properties - The figures given for these properties are for the most part derived from raw material supplier data and other publications.

(2) Values for this property are only given here for amorphous materials and for materials that do not show a melting temperature (PBI, PAI & PI). DMA settings, oscillation

the amplitude of 0.20 mm; a frequency of 1 Hz; heating rate of 2°C/min

(3) Temperature resistance over a period of min. 20,000 hours. After this period of time, there is a decrease in tensile strength – measured at 23 °C – of about 50 % as compared with the original value. The temperature value given here is thus based on the thermal-oxidative degradation which takes place and causes a reduction in properties. Note, however, that the maximum allowable service temperature depends in many cases essentially on the duration and the magnitude of the mechanical stresses to which the material is subjected.

(4) Impact strength decreasing with decreasing temperature, the minimum allowable service temperature is practically mainly determined by the extent to which the material is subjected to impact. The value given here is based on unfavorable impact conditions and may consequently not be considered as being the absolute practical limit.

(5) These estimated ratings, derived from raw material supplier data and other publications, are not intended to reflect hazards presented by the material under actual fire conditions. There is no ‘UL File Number’ available for these stock shapes.

Mechanical Properties - Most of the figures given for the mechanical properties are average values of tests run on dry test specimens machined out of rods 40-60 mm when available, else out of plate 10-20mm. All tests are done at room temperature (23° / 73°F)
