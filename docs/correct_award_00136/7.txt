The original medals for the Nobel Prize awarded to Gerhart Hauptmann are on display in the museum commemorating his memory on Hiddensee. (The award consists of two medals). On the front of the larger one is an engraved portrait of Alfred Nobel, his name and dates of his life. The full name of the winner is shown on the reverse. The prize was awarded to Gerhart Hauptmann on 10 December 1912 primarily in recognition of his fruitful, varied and outstanding production in the realm of dramatic art. The honour bestowed on Gerhart Hauptmann in the Nobel Prize for Literature pays testimony to a writer whose early works Before Sunrise(1889) and The Weavers (1892) instantaneously established German drama on the forefront of European modernism.
