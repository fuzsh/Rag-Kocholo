        "text": "Layout 2\n\nBerlin, Nov. 12\n\nA Stockholm message announces that Herr Thomas Mann has been awarded this year's Nobel Prize for Literature. he is the fifth German to received the Prize, the others being:—Theodor Mommsen (1902), Rudolf Eucken (1908), Karl Heyse (1910), and Gerhart Hauptmann (1912). Two other writers were believed to be among the most likely candidates this year—Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Arno Holz, both of whom have recently died.\n\nHerr Thomas Mann, who is himself a Lübecker, possibly best known through the \"Buddenbrooks,\" a story of the rise and fall of a Hanseatic trading dynasty. At the time when he wrote \"Buddenbrooks\" he was much under the influence of the Scandinavian novelists, living as he did in a German Free City which has the closest associations with Scandinavia, and this has given him a particular pleasure in the award of the Prize. Other well-known novels of is are \"Der kleine Herr Friedemann\" and \"Tristan.\" He is at present engaged on a two-volume novel, \"Joseph and his Brethren.\" This is for Herr Mann entirely new ground.\n\nStockholm, Nov. 12.—The Nobel Prize for Physics for 1928 has been awarded to Professor Owen Willans Richardson, Yarrow Research Professor of the Royal Society and Director of Research in Physics at King's College, London.\n\nThe Nobel Prize for Physics for 1929 has been awarded to the Duc de Broglie. The award to Duc de Broglie is made on account of his discovery of the undulating nature of electrons.\n\nThe 1928 prize is awarded by the Academy of Science to Professor Richardson for his discovery of the fundamental physical law known as the \"Richardson law,\" which governs the motion of electrons emanating from hot bodies. This formula constitutes the basis of the action of the wireless valve, upon which wireless telephony and broadcasting depend."
