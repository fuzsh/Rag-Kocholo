        "text": "Mary Evans Picture Library Photo Prints and Wall Art\n\nGerhart Hauptmann\n\nGERHART HAUPTMANN German writer Date: 1862 - 1946\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 14275837\n\nÂ© Mary Evans Picture Library\n\n1862 1946 Hauptmann\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nThis evocative photograph captures the introspective gaze of Gerhart Hauptmann (1862-1946), a towering figure in German literature. Born in Oberwiesenthal, Saxony, on February 1, 1862, Hauptmann would go on to become a pioneer of modern German drama and a Nobel Prize laureate in Literature. The image, taken in the early 20th century, shows Hauptmann deep in thought, his furrowed brow and piercing eyes reflecting the depth of his artistic introspection. The photographer has captured him in a moment of quiet contemplation, a testament to the profound impact of his literary creations on his mind. Hauptmann's literary career began in earnest in the late 1880s, and he quickly gained recognition for his innovative approach to drama. His plays, which often explored the struggles of the working class and the complexities of human relationships, challenged the traditional forms of German theater. In 1912, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his deep understanding of human beings and the truthful portrayal of their feelings.\" Despite his literary success, Hauptmann's life was marked by personal and political turmoil. He was a vocal critic of the Nazi regime, and his anti-fascist stance led to his exile from Germany in 1933. He spent the remainder of his life in exile, living in various European countries before eventually settling in Switzerland. This photograph serves as a poignant reminder of Hauptmann's enduring legacy as a German literary giant, whose works continue to resonate with readers around the world. The furrowed brow and piercing gaze of the man in the photograph speak to the depth of his artistic vision and the profound impact of his literary creations on the human psyche.\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
