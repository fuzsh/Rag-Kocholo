        "text": "This course offers students a deeper analysis of literary and cultural studies taught in English. No prior knowledge of German is required. Course may be taken twice for credit, as content may change with the instructor.\n\nAs a response to the horrors and destruction throughout Europe after World War II, the German-Jewish philosopher Theodor Adorno posited in 1949 that to write poetry after Auschwitz is \"barbaric.\" In the decades that followed this now infamous and often misinterpreted dictum, it was a common belief that the systematic discrimination and mass extermination of European Jews and \"undesirables\" could not be represented, rationalized, or imagined. Despite this, there has been a steady stream of cinematic representations of the Holocaust extending through today.\n\nFrom the very beginning of its history, photography has served as a device to reflect on and about representation. In this seminar students explore the many interrelations between literature and photography specifically in the German context as they are represented in genres of fiction, illustrated texts, autobiography, photo books, and others. Students will read and discuss selected texts, photo narratives, and combinations of photos and texts, as well as the supposed affinities and analogies between story-telling and photographic images.\n\nThis seminar seeks to interrogate assumptions about contemporary German and American culture and examine how one can better define what German and 'Germanness' means today (if at all possible) from the perspective of the outsider, the foreigner, and the other. What do the words 'Heimat' and 'Nation' mean to Germans today and why have these notions remained so fluid - even undefinable - in the German context? In this course, students engage with various literary texts, film, news items, and other media from Germany after reunification (1989/90).\n\nThis seminar introduces key themes and concepts in contemporary German-speaking literature and cultural studies with a focus on the role of human-nature interactions. Students examine contemporary issues and questions such as: How can we better understand climate change and its effects and develop systemic / planetary thinking according to proper scales (space, size, time)? How can we talk about our way of life and reflect on globalization, consumption, capitalism, civilization, alienation, and exploitation?\n\nThis course exposes students to representative German-language dramatic works, with the intention of staging a public performance at the end of the semester. Additional shorter texts on dramatic theory and visual and/or videos will supplement course materials. As a practical component to the course, we will also conduct technical acting exercises and in-class readings of the dramatic texts. Emphasis will be on closely reading texts, on discussing them in German, and providing opportunities to systematically advance and improve articulation of spoken German."
