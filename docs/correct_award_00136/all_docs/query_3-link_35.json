        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nGERHART HAUPTMANN'S RANGE A S D R A M A T I S T IT IS EASIER, if more time­consuming, to write a book about a stimulating author than to say something worth while about him in a lecture. You do not wish me to take you on a Cook's Tour of Gerhart Hauptmann's vast production. It would be unspeakably tedious to enumerate each of his forty­odd dramas and his almost equally numerous novels, stories, verse epics, and other works and to affix to each some characteristic label. What do most of you know about Hauptmann? You all know of him as the author of a famous play about the Silesian weavers. A few of you who are old enough will recall his winning of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1912. And some of you know that he died a very old man in May 1946, having Uved just long enough to have witnessed the death of his native Silesia, the sociological extinction of a branch of the German people that had developed its characteristic physiognomy over many centuries in conjunction with the specific landscape of its habitat. Hauptmann died when all but the last of its population had been swept as fugitives to the west of the Polish zone of occu­ pation, a few weeks before the order for his own expulsion was to become effective. But unless you happen to pursue professional interests in German or in comparative literature, you are not apt to know that more has been written aboutHauptmann than about any otherGerman author except Goethe; that to a wide and devoted following he came over many decades to be regarded as the incarnation of the poetic spirit. His appeal was broad, deep, and lasting. Publicity and contempo­ rary popularity are no guarantees of enduring fame, but they are a factor to be taken account of in even the sketchiest treatment of some aspects of Hauptmann's career. Except for a short period at the beginning of his career, Haupt­ mann's appeal has always been broad rather than specialized. Un­ like his other great contemporaries in German literature, he had little, if anything, of the passion of art for art's sake in his make­up. He seemed always more concerned with the matter than with the Reprinted from Monatshefte, xuv (1952), 317­332, by permission of the Uni­ versity of Wisconsin Press. G E R H A R T H A U P T M A N N ' S R A N G E A S D R A M A T I S T manner of what he had to say. Except in the field of drama, he was an indifferent craftsman. One may be shaken to one's depths by the total pathos of a human situation projected by Hauptmann; one is rarely entranced in his work by a conscious experience of aesthetic perfection in the phrasing, in the rhythmic and melodic values of his linguistic material. He does not give to the trained ear the ecstasy of mutation achieved in the powers of language. He has none of the metallic density of Stefan George, none of the incor­ poreal incandescence of Rilke. His prose has none of the disciplined suppleness and brilliant phrasing that characterize Thomas Mann's mastery of narrative and essay. But what Hauptmann does in a com­ prehensive way is to penetrate to the heart of all that is human. Thus he encompasses the contemporary scene in accents which are com­ pellingly authentic. But also in the grand manner of poets like Shakespeare he re­creates outstanding figures of history and myth to revel in an orchestration of passions of incomparably richer scope than the very limited range of modern civilized man. The story of Hauptmann's youth is a saga of adventure which the old poet has himself recorded in great detail, taking full advantage of the perspective afforded by his subsequent rise to eminence. Born as the son of a hotel manager in a small Silesian spa (1862), he was largely left to his own devices as a youngster. Exceedingly alert and impressionable, he observed a great variety of town and country folk in pursuit of their callings, and visitors at the spa rep­ resenting all classes of society. He associated with well­brought­up middle class companions, and he chummed and fought with raga­ muffins of the gutter. While his adjustment to his home environ­ ment was happy on..."
