        "text": "If you often think that there is a lack of Arab representations in the Western world, primarily in Hollywood….you are wrong!\n\nThere are many celebrities with Arab ancestry, and I assure you that you will be surprised by seeing some of the names on this list.\n\nSo here are 12 celebrities who have Arab heritage.\n\n1. Shakira: Lebanese Roots\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CRmpUZ3MC8n/\n\nShakira, the ‘Waka Waka’ singer is half Lebanese and half Colombian. She gets her Lebanese roots from her father. Shakira is never shy of her Arab roots and often expresses them, may it be through her zaghrouta tongue roll, her belly dancing, or through her Arabic song ‘Ojos Asi’ (Eyes Like Those).\n\n2. Ariana Grande: Moroccan and Algerian Roots\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CRmKguglWys/\n\nThis singer who is known for her hit singles such as ‘thank u, next’ has Algerian and Moroccan roots which she found out after doing a DNA test in 2014, and on Twitter wrote “just found out my grandparents are heavily greek and part north african…. I thought I was Italian… who am i? my whole life is a lie.”\n\n3. Steve Jobs: Half Syrian\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CAnfjwAnu2q/\n\nWhat comes to your mind when you think of Steve Jobs?

Jade confesses that when she was younger, she had trouble with her Middle Eastern heritage. In an interview with BBC UK, Jade says, “I’d identify myself as mixed-race; if I delved deeper, I’d say of Arab heritage, I guess. I’ve had an inner battle of not knowing where I fit in or what larger community I fit into.” Thus, Jade is now attempting to reconcile with her Arab heritage and wear it proudly.\n\n9. Wentworth Miller: Syrian and Lebanese Roots\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CHsl6ZxM0xr/\n\nThis Prison Break star is quite multifaceted!
