        "text": "Macedonia’s opponents have revealed their rosters of summoned players for the two upcoming friendlies.\n\nIgor Angelovski will make his managerial debut on November 12 against Montenegro in Skopje. As for the opponent, coach Branko Brnović called up 21 players and will add two more next week. This will be their only November friendly, but Montenegro comes with mostly their best squad. CB Esteban Saveljich (based in Argentina and there was no point to travel so far for just one friendly) and FW Dejan Damjanović (engaged in contract negotiations with his Chinese club) are the only key guys missing. It should be noted that although star player Mirko Vučinić planned to be dropped due to his suspension for the next qualifier, he insisted to be available for this friendly. The lone debutante in the team is actually the player of Macedonian table leaders Vardar, Nemanja Mijušković.\n\nMontenegro’s squad:\n\nVukašin Poleksić – Sutjeska\n\nMilan Mijatović – Bokelj\n\nDanijel Petković – Lovćen\n\nMarko Baša – Lille\n\nStefan Savić – Atlético Madrid\n\nŽarko Tomašević – Kortrijk\n\nMarko Simić – Kayserispor\n\nNemanja Mijušković – Vardar\n\nSaša Balić – Târgu Mureș\n\nNikola Vukčević – Braga\n\nMladen Kašćelan – Arselan Tula\n\nElsad Zverotić – Sion\n\nNemanja Nikolić – BATE\n\nVladimir Boljević – AEK Larnaca\n\nAdam Marušić – Kortrijk\n\nVladimir Rodić – Malmö\n\nStaniša Mandić – Čukarički\n\nStevan Jovetić – Inter\n\nMirko Vučinić – Al-Jazira\n\nFatos Bećiraj – Dinamo Minsk\n\nStefan Mugoša – 1860 München\n\nLebanon, meanwhile, called up a larger roster totaling 31 players. They will face Macedonia on November 17 in Skopje, but five days earlier they play an important World Cup qualifier against Laos. Lebanon is actually managed by a Montenegrin coach in Miodrag Radulović.\n\nLebanon’s squad:\n\nAbbas Hassan – Elsborg\n\nMehdi Khalil – Al-Safa’\n\nDaniel Zeaiter – Mainz\n\nYoussef Wasef Mohamad – no club\n\nBilal Najjarine – Al-Dhafra\n\nWalid Ismail – Zob Ahan\n\nAli Hamam – Zob Ahan\n\nMootaz Chehade Jounaidi – Al-Ansar\n\nNour Mansour – Al-Safa’\n\nMohamed Zein Tahan – Al-Safa’\n\nMohammed Ali Khan – Halmstad\n\nJoan Oumari – Frankfurt\n\nMohammad Baghdadi – Eintracht Braunschweig\n\nAbbas Ahmed Atwi – Nejmeh\n\nRoda Antar – Hángzhōu Greentown\n\nAbbas Ali Atwi “Onika” – Al-Ahed\n\nHassan Chaito – Terengganu\n\nHaitham Faour – Al-Ahed\n\nMohammed Shamas – Nejmeh\n\nAdnan Haidar – HamKam\n\nHilal El-Helwe – Wolfsburg II\n\nIhab Darwiche – Ahlen"
