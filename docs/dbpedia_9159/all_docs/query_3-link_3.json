        "text": "Shannon Elizabeth was born in Houston, Texas, the daughter of a Syrian/Lebanese father. When Shannon was in 3rd grade, her family moved to Waco, Texas, to be close to relatives. As a girl, Shannon took dance lessons, including tap, ballet, and jazz. While attending high school, however, she was very interested in tennis. She even considered going pro and making tennis her life. During high school, she was active in cheerleading, dance team, and the student council. As a senior, Shannon was in a music video shot in Waco. The local music artists were called \"Hi-5\", and the director of that video just happened to be Antoine Fuqua. After graduating, Shannon moved to New York City to model. She then traveled all over the world with her newfound career to places that included Japan, Italy, France, and Australia. After moving to Los Angeles years later, she signed on with Ford Models and, eventually, Elite. Shannon had always wanted to start her acting career and had just modeled in hopes that it could help lead her into acting, which it did. About a year after moving to Los Angeles, she started taking acting classes with several different coaches. She got an agent, started working, and in 1999, she landed the iconic role of \"Nadia\" in the movie American Pie.\n\nShannon enjoys wearing even more hats these days. Since cutting her directing chops on music videos, she is now directing documentaries and film projects via her production company, Ganesha Productions. She also co-hosts the podcast The Art of Conservation.\n\nShannon also splits her time between the US and South Africa, running programs within her nonprofit, the Shannon Elizabeth Foundation. The mission is to improve this planet for the animals, environment, and indigenous people.\n\n\"You don't know who you are until you know where you came from\" is a quote Rima carried out through most of her life. Today, at 33 years old Rima Fakih Slaiby resides in California with her husband Wassim 'Sal' Slaiby and two children. Holding her current mission to break barriers for Arab women Rima holds today the title of National Director and Executive Producer of Miss Lebanon/ Miss Universe.\n\nIn less than two years Rima competed in and won four consecutive pageants prior to winning the title of Miss USA in 2010. Her win was a monumental breakthrough for all Arab women in the western world and beyond as Rima became the first and only ever Immigrant, Arab woman to win the title of Miss USA. As Miss Michigan USA 2010, Fakih served as one of the first official pageant ambassadors for women's self-defense awareness, educating women on the importance of taking the necessary precautionary measures to best protect and prepare themselves from unwanted situations. As Miss USA, Fakih is a spokeswoman for breast and ovarian cancer education, research and legislation - a platform that is close to her heart. She will travel nationwide as an advocate for organizations such as Susan G. Komen for the Cure and Gilda's Club, among others. Rima received the Key to the City of Waterbury and a Proclamation from the State of Connecticut declaring September 18th \"Rima Fakih Day.\" Mayor, John B. O'Reilly Jr. awarded Dearborn, Michigan native Rima Fakih the Key to the City and proclaimed Saturday, July 10 as \"Rima Fakih Day\" along a \"Welcome to Dearborn, Home of Rima Fakih sign to the city.\n\nHolding many notable appearances, Rima F Slaiby, has appeared at Ronald Reagan's Centennial Celebration, riding in a float at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Regis&Kelly Show, Good Morning America, The Wendy William Show, Jimmy Fallon, David Letterman, and attending an American Chamber of Commerce conference in Cairo alongside former President Bill Clinton. Rima continued to make many appearances with the World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE), including a special segment titled \"Tribute to the Troops\" and a role in the reality show \"Tough Enough\", \"Dancing With the Stars\", and Fox \"The Choice.\"\n\nOn September 30, 2018, through her role as President and Executive Producer of the Miss Lebanon 2018 pageant, Rima not only sparked country wide interest but she also delivered a record-breaking show. By combining her pageant and business knowledge, Rima and her team of professionals lead the vision for the new and improved pageant for future participants and winners of Miss Lebanon. Rima's outing and humorous personality continues to lead her to new adventures in life.\n\nGeorge Noory hosts the nationally syndicated program Coast to Coast AM, heard by millions of listeners on more than 600 stations in North America, is the #1 most listened to radio show in the overnight time period, according to Arbitron.\n\nWhile hosting The Nighthawk, a wildly successful, late-night program on KTRS in St. Louis, George Noory was recruited by Premiere Networks to guest host on Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell. On January 1, 2003, George Noory became the permanent host of the phenomenally successful overnight program, following the retirement of Art Bell. Under Noory's hosting, the show grew significantly.\n\nNoory captivates program listeners with his discussions including paranormal phenomena, time travel, alien abductions, religion, spirituality, conspiracies and all things curious and unexplained. He is driven, he has said, by the desire to solve the great mysteries of our time. From his first days as a radio broadcaster he says, \"I've wanted to cover stories that the mainstream media never touch--the unusual, the paranormal and things like that. I learned that broadcast is the best business for exploring these issues, and I've been doing it for years.\"\n\nHe dates his interest in these matters to a book by Walter Sullivan, We Are Not Alone, that his mother gave him when he was 13. He was hooked.\n\nPrior to his late-night show on KTRS, Noory had an extensive broadcast career. He started in radio at WCAR-AM in Detroit, where his first-ever interview was with nuclear physicist and UFO expert Stanton Friedman. From 1974-1978, he served as news producer and executive news producer at WJBK-TV. At age 28, he became the youngest major market news director in the country at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis. Noory was also the director of news planning and development at KSTP-TV in Minneapolis, was news director at KSDK-TV in St. Louis and the recipient of three Emmy Awards while a news executive.\n\nNoory released his first book in 2006. Worker In The Light: Unlock Your Five Senses And Liberate Your Limitless Potential, co-written by best-selling author William J. Birnes, is Noory's revolutionary guide to spiritual enlightenment, human empowerment, ultimate productivity and absolute happiness. Noory and Birnes co-authored a follow-up in 2009 entitled Journey to the Light, in which they present amazing first-hand accounts of how ordinary people changed their own lives, transcended their doubts and fears, and unlocked the secrets to their spiritual growth. In October 2011, Noory released his third book, Talking To The Dead. Co-written by Rosemary Ellen Guiley, a leading expert on the paranormal and supernatural, the book explores the colorful history and personalities behind spirit communications, weaving together spirituality, metaphysics, science and technology. Noory, along with Richard Belzer and David Wayne, released Someone is Hiding Something: What Happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370? in February 2015. Scrutinizing the theories the media and politicians claim are the \"most likely\" reasons the plane crashed, they argue that if a year after a huge Boeing 777 has gone missing, and there's still no sign of it whatsoever, it's time to think outside the box.\n\nIn July, 2016, Noory released Night Talk, a fictional story about a late-night talk-show host who is fascinated by the paranormal and becomes entangled in a deadly conspiracy. His latest work, Mad As Hell, is set for release in June 2017 and discusses the problems facing our country, why Noory is mad about it, and how we could bring about positive change.\n\nIn December 2012, GAIAM TV launched Beyond Belief with George Noory, a new TV show exploring the unknown and mysteries of the universe. The one-hour, weekly series features Noory's informative, investigative and dynamic conversations, as well as some of his favorite guests from the radio program. Taped in front of a live audience at GAIAM studios in Boulder, Colo., Beyond Belief with George Noory is available exclusively on http://www.beyondbelief.com/.\n\nWhen he's not busy hosting his radio show or writing his next book, Noory travels the U.S., meeting with fans at events like Contact in the Desert and the Conscious Life Expo, or his live George Noory & Friends stage shows. Last summer, he launched ParanormalDate.com for people who enjoy the subject matter covered on Coast to Coast AM. A companion site, ConspiracyDate.com, was also recently launched. Both apps are available for free on IOS and Android devices. For more information, please visit www.coasttocoastam.com.\n\nNoory was born, raised and educated in Detroit. He has three children and six grandchildren. He served nine years in the U.S. Naval Reserve. Coast to Coast AM is the most listened to overnight radio program in the USA and is broadcast live, Monday-Sunday from 1-5 a.m. ET."
