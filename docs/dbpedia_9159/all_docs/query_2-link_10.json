        "text": "BY ZULHILMI ZAINAL Follow on Twitter\n\nIn round five of the Super League (MSL), Selangor will take on Felda United FC, with both teams having crashed out of the FA Cup in the second round last Tuesday. The match, which will be held at Selangor's homeground the Selayang Municipal Stadium, is the only round five match to be played on Friday.\n\nApart from the cup exit, both sides also have another similarity. Including their cup matches, they have not won their last four matches.\n\nThe Red Giants won their league opener, before going on to record two draws and one defeat. The Fighters too bagged all three points in their first league encounter, but then collected just one point from their next three matches.\n\nBoth sides' foreign strikers are currently facing goal dearths. Selangor striker and former Felda man Forkey Doe, having scored two in their 5-3 defeat to PKNS FC a fortnight ago, then misfired against JDT and in the FA Cup match. His failure to find the back of the net last Tuesday was even more telling, as he had a number of good chances in the match that ended goalless after extra-time, which his side then lost on penalties.\n\nTwo other Selangor attackers, Victoraș Astafei and Juliano Mineiro too have not scored recently, although the former did bag one on his debut for the Red Giants.\n\nWhereas for the Fighters, Argentinian forward Gastón Cellerino has made appearances in all five of their matches this season without finding the back of the net even once, a statistic that would worry any head coaches. His compatriot Lucas Cano meanwhile has made only two appearances, having been plagued by injuries.\n\nSelangor boss Maniam Pachaiappan is not expected to make major changes to his side, considering his trust in his men and the lack of depth in his squad this season. Doe will likely lead the attack and be allowed to recapture his goal-scoring form, supported by Astafei, who was substituted off relatively early on Tuesday, and Mineiro.\n\nYoungster Syahmi Safari, who played all 120 minutes in their FA Cup defeat, and almost all 360 minutes of their previous four matches, is likely to be rested on Friday. Abdul Halim Zainal, who came on late in the second half of extra time on Tuesday and then missed a penalty, is expected to return to the starting line-up.\n\nManiam however may take a risk by resting centre back Ugo Ukah, who played well for 120 minutes before he too missed a penalty, but if he is dropped it will be due to fatigue and not because of poor performance. Goalkeeper Khairul Azhan Khalid is expected to start again, having kept two back-to-back clean sheets.\n\nWhereas for Felda caretaker coach Mohamad Nik, he has no other option but to continue relying on his misfiring forwards Norshahrul Idlan Talaha and Cellerino, although pre-season signing Fakrul Aiman Sidid may just be handed a rare start.\n\nLiberian playmaker Zah Rahan Krangar will also likely start, as will Malaysia winger Hadin Azman and Stuart Wark. Lebanese centre back Mootaz Jounaidi too may be paired up with skipper Shukor Adan in defence, with Farizal Harun maintaning his vice-like grip on the position of Felda's first goalkeeper.\n\nBut Mohamad's team selection against Selangor will have to take into account the fact that next Tuesday, the Fighters will be playing their first ever continental match, their 2017 AFC Cup opener against Singapore's Tampines Rovers FC.\n\nBoth sides have met five times in 2015 and 2016 alone, with Felda winning three encounters, Selangor one, and one match ending in a draw. Meanwhile, out their past five matches with Selangor as the hosts, each side have won two matches, with the remaining match ending in a draw.\n\nInterestingly, Red Giants forward Doe, who last season played for the Fighters, last year scored three times against his current club in their two league matches, helping them win both matches.\n\nManiam told The Star Online that they will be gunning for an early goal against Felda “We have to go for an early goal ... I’m confident our strikers will get their act right this time.”"
