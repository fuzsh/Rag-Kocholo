        "text": "Lebanon borders Israel and Syria. Along the Mediterranean coast is a narrow plain. The Lebanon Mountains, which rise to 9,800 feet (3,000 meters), run down the middle of the country. The Anti-Lebanon Mountains form Lebanon’s border with Syria. Between the two mountain ranges lies the high, fertile Bekaa Valley. The valley receives water from the Litani, the only river in Lebanon that flows throughout the year.\n\nLebanon’s coast has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Summers in the Bekaa Valley are hot and dry, and winters are cool. Lebanon receives more rain than most Middle Eastern countries.\n\nAmong Lebanon’s plants are brush and low trees, including oaks, pines, cypresses, firs, junipers, and carobs. Lebanon is famous for its cedar trees, but today they grow only in protected mountain groves.\n\nLebanon’s animals include deer, wildcats, hedgehogs, squirrels, martens (small weasel-like mammals), and hares. Flamingos, pelicans, cuckoos, and various birds of prey also live there.\n\nMost Lebanese are Arabs. There are small groups of Armenians and Kurds. Arabic is the main language, but many people speak English and French. Muslims make up more than half of the population. Most of the rest of the people are Christians. A smaller number of people are Druze—followers of a religion that combines elements of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and other faiths. About 90 percent of Lebanese live in cities, mainly along the coast.\n\nIn early times the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines ruled what is now Lebanon. In 1516 the Turks made the region part of the Ottoman Empire. After World War I (1914–18) France governed Lebanon. The country became independent in 1943.\n\nAfter independence, tensions grew between Christians and Muslims. In 1970 the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) moved its headquarters to Lebanon. The PLO launched attacks on Israel from Lebanon. Lebanese Muslims sided with the Palestinians against Israel and the Lebanese Christians. The Lebanese Muslims also wanted more power in Lebanon’s Christian-dominated government.\n\nIn 1975 the conflict escalated into civil war between Muslims and Christians. The following year Syrian forces entered Lebanon to support the Christians. In 1982 Israeli forces also invaded. The Israelis and an international peacekeeping force helped to force the PLO out of Lebanon.\n\nThe civil war ended in 1990, but violence continued in southern Lebanon, especially between Israeli forces and the radical Muslim group known as Hezbollah. About 300,000 Palestinian refugees also remained in Lebanon.\n\nIn 2000 Israel withdrew its forces from southern Lebanon. Syrian troops withdrew in 2005."
