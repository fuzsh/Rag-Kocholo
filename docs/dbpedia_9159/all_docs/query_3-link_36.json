        "text": "The award-winning American celebrity chef and host of CNN's \"Parts Unknown\" was interviewed by Bon Appétit Magazine last year, and he didn't exactly hide his love for Lebanon's capital city.\n\nBourdain was asked the simple question: \"Where should I travel now?\" and his response made every Beiruti feel a sense of pride.\n\n\"Beirut. The food’s delicious, the people are awesome,\" he said.\n\nIn 2015, Bourdain said he even considered naming his daughter Beirut.\n\nThe Puerto Rican pop star has visited Lebanon on numerous occasions, sometimes to perform and sometimes just to relax.\n\nMartin even came to Lebanon with his Syrian fiancé for vacation and to visit refugee camps prior to their engagement last year.\n\nIn a 2014 tweet, Martin said: \"My sunset in Beirut, Lebanon. I'm glad to be back!\"\n\nMexican-American actress Salma Hayek, whose paternal grandfather is Lebanese, finally made it to the land of her ancestors back in 2015.\n\n\"I have been dreaming of coming to Lebanon,\" she said at a press conference to promote her animated film The Prophet, based on the book by legendary Lebanese author Kahlil Gibran.\n\n\"I had a thorn in my heart that I had traveled the world but I had never been able to come here. And I have to say that, I feel so much better today that I have been here,\" she said.\n\nShe also called the film \"a love letter\" to her heritage.\n\nIn 2016, Jolie visited Syrian refugees in Lebanon and emphasized how impressed she was by the generosity and kindness of the Lebanese people.\n\n\"You are setting an example to the world of generosity, humanity, resilience and solidarity. Shukran,\" she said, according to The Daily Star.\n\n\"Lebanon must stay strong, and this is important for everybody, because no country in the world has given the refugees what Lebanon has,\" she added.\n\nIt's clear, after holding three concerts in Beirut, that Brian Adams loves Lebanon and the Lebanese love him right back.\n\nOn his most recent visit in March, he expressed his gratitude for being able to perform in such an \"amazing\" country once again. After his performance he posted on Facebook saying: \"Thank you for such a beautiful night.\"\n\nAnd of course, a trip to Beirut wouldn't be complete without a falafel. According to Adams, \"the most delicious falafel\" in the city can be found at Sahyoun on Bechara El Khoury near Downtown Beirut.\n\nThe international Colombian superstar Shakira performed in Lebanon in 2011 and expressed her love for the country.\n\n“I love you very, very much Lebanon,” she said before her concert, according to The Daily Star.\n\n“I am so happy to be here. My dad is very happy too. I brought my sister; the Moubarak family is really, really excited to be in Lebanon,\" she said.\n\nWhile Shakira's father is of Lebanese descent, the international star grew up in Colombia and made her first visit to Lebanon in 2003.\n\nThe British billionaire businessman, philanthropist and knight behind Virgin Group came to Lebanon in 2013 for the launch of Virgin Radio. At the time, he spoke on air about how impressed he was with Beirut and its vibrance.\n\nHe was even spotted with a Live Love Beirut bracelet."
