        "text": "Its Philippines versus Malaysia this week in the 2017 AFC Cup and nothing but fireworks are expected in both ties. Johor Darul Ta’zim will host Global Cebu in Johor on March 14 while Ceres-Negros will face FELDA United in Bacolod the day after.\n\nJDT v Global\n\nMalaysia Super League Champions Johor Darul Ta’zim will meet United Football League Champions Global Cebu FC in a Group F tie on Tuesday. It will be the first meeting of both squads in AFC competition with the top spot for Group F will be at stake. Global is still perfect after two matches highlighted by their recent 2-0 win against Boeung Ket Ankor in Phnom Penh. JDT played its reserve unit in match day 2 and settled for a 1-1 draw with ten men against Magwe in Yangon and the Malaysian champions are out to recoup lost points in this tight race to the top.\n\nWith JDT expected to bring out its best eleven, interesting individual battles will be seen throughout the match. Philippine International Misagh Bahadoran and Trinidadian Darryl Roberts and will have to deal with the defensive partnership of Malaysia’s Junior Eldstal and Brazilian Marcos Antonio. Former Azkal Paul Mulders will be pitted against former Malaysia Captain Safiq Rahim in a key battle in midfield. Global’s Amani Aguinaldo and Brazilian Wesley dos Santos will have a tough task ahead against Hazwan Bakri and Argentinian Gabriel Guerra.\n\nJDT last played a Philippine squad in Kaya FC with a 7-2 trashing at Larkin stadium in the Round of 16 of the 2016 AFC Cup. Global is keen to improve its record in the AFC Cup against Malaysian teams after getting double 0-0 draws against Pahang in the 2015 edition. Though pundits have marked JDT as the favorites in this match, Global is keen for an upset in front of the Johor fans. The match will kickoff at 845pm in Johor.\n\nCeres vs Felda\n\nCeres-Negros FC will host Felda United in Match Day 3 of Group G in the AFC Cup. Ceres has just come-off from a 5-0 win against Tampines Rovers which elevated them into first spot in the group. Felda almost came off with its first win against Hanoi at the Shah Alam stadium but the Vietnamese squad came up with a last minute goal for the 1-1draw. Both squads qualified for the group stages of the tournament after placing second in their respective leagues last year.\n\nCeres has had a history of tough matches against Malaysian clubs especially against Selangor in last year’s AFC Cup. Their opening match in Bacolod saw Selangor scoring first with a brilliant free kick from Hafiz Kamal until Ceres equalized late with a Stephan Schrock strike. Both teams played the second leg in the Selayang Municipal Stadium where Ceres forced a 0-0 draw which consequently allowed them to qualify for the Round of Sixteen of the 2016 AFC Cup.\n\nThe tie will feature a new challenge for both squads in all areas of the pitch. Fernando Ceres’ Spaniards Rodriguez and Bienvenido Maranon will slug it out with central defenders in Lebanese Mootaz Jounaidi and Malaysian legend Shukor Adan. Manny Ott will have to deal with Scottish-Malaysian defensive midfielder Stuart Wark in the midfield. Argentinean striker Lucas Cano and Liberian Zah Krangar will be a handful for Carli de Murga and Super Herrera.\n\nThe Bacolod squad will gun for a second straight victory but the visitors are fully aware that a win is the only way for them to reach the next round of the tournament. A capacity crowd is again expected at the Panaad Stadium to support the home team. The match will be aired at 7PM on Wednesday.\n\nPhotos from AFC Cup/Lagardere Sports\n\nAFC Cup Group E leaders Ceres-La Salle FC now focus their sights in their final group match against the resurgent Lt. Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club Ltd from Bangladesh. ‘Sheikh Jamal’ for short, the club is based in the capital of Dhaka and is considered as the most successful club in Bangladesh\n\nPhoto from Sheikh Jamal wikipedia page\n\nPlayers to Watch\n\n#7 Landing Darboe (Midfielder)\n\nThe top scorer for the club scoring four goals in the last three games. This versatile player is given a free hand to roam around the attacking half producing a dangerous partnership with Wedson Anselme.\n\n#10 Wedson Anselme (Forward)\n\nThe targetman for Sheikh Jamal hasn’t scored a lot but his movement, shooting, and passing is of high quality and should not be disregarded. Also given a free hand to roam the captain of the squad\n\n#9 Emeka Onuoha (Forward)\n\nThe other danger man of the team that is part of the three headed attack of Sheikh Jamal. The Nigerian may or may not show up with the squad as some unconfirmed reports that hes been replaced but since the lineup cant be changed after the round of 16, lets assume that he will play.\n\n#12 Jamal Bhuyan (Midfielder)\n\nThe Danish-born Bhuyan is a quality defensive midfielder who according to his wiki page once played for Stallion FC. Considered a top player for the Bangladesh national team, he can be a thorn to offensive players. An injury however may not allow him to suit up for this match.\n\nLast Three Games\n\nSheikh Jamal vs Selangor\n\nSelangor vs Sheikh Jamal\n\nSheikh Jamal vs Tampines Rovers\n\nFirst XI\n\n#9 Emeka #10 Wedson\n\n#7 Landing\n\n#13 MD Jewel #17 Rana\n\n#12 Bhuyan\n\n#6 Linkon #3 Bosh #2 Barman #21 Yeasin\n\n#23 Mazharul Islam\n\nStrategy\n\nSheikh Jamal has been always been very dependent on their foreign trio. Their familiarity has been their key point and they have always adjusted to what is given to them. The team has scored goals from the last few games because of their offensive awareness. Landing has been the dominant midfielder dictating the play with his vision and power but you can see the others taking in the slack if the situation permits. Stopping the midfielder would be the objective. The Bangladeshi squad has been the weakest in the group leaking plenty of goals. If their weakness is taken advantage off, then good things will happen to the opposing team.\n\nTen-man Kaya FC withstood a late Ceres rally to win the 2015 UFL Cup via a penalty shootout last August 28 at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. Goalkeeper Nick O’donnel secured the win for Kaya after saving two shots from Ceres.\n\nIt was Kaya who took it to the league champions in the early going when Tishan Hanley sneaked a diving header forcing a one hand save from Louie Michael Casas. Kaya’s Joven Bedic found the back of the net minutes after but the referee ruled it out after contact was made to the Ceres goalie prior to the shot.\n\nCeres was in the backfoot in the first thirty minutes as the players were still adjusting to the combinations due to the absence of Manny Ott. The Bacolod squad regained some control in the remaining minutes after multiple attempts from their attacking players. Their best chance came when a Lee Jeong Woo superstrike was parried by O’donnel towards Okunaiaya who’s deflected cross found it’s way to Patrick Reichelts lap. Reichelt wasn’t quick enough to act causing his shot to be deflected out wide.\n\nIn injury time, OJ Porteria initiated a counter attack who laid off to Dieho Barrera in the wings with the midfielder issuing a perfect cross to Hanley. The striker buried the shot in the bottom corner giving Kaya a 1-0 lead just before the whistle.\n\nCeres started out strong in the second half with shot attempts from Bienvenido Marañon, Lee, and Martin Steuble. The strong start was negated by Kaya after forcing a counterattack where Joven Bedic supplied Diego Barrera with a good ball. The Colombian player hit an inch perfect strike where it hit the bar and in stunning Ceres for the 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Bacolod squad got back minutes later when Lee struck a beautiful curling shot to the second post to the delight of the Ceres fans. Things looked bad for Kaya as Lee was locking heads with Chris Greatwhich and both players were given yellow cards. Greatwich, who had recieved a yellow earlier, was given his marching orders after fourth official Clifford Daypuyat discussed the violation minutes later leaving Kaya to ten men.\n\nJuani Guirado scored the equalizer in the 73rd after glancing in a cross from Martin Steuble. Ceres put pressure to the Kaya but timely saves from the keeper and the defense maintained the 2-2 scoreline after ninety minutes.\n\nCeres was pushing Kaya early in extra time but the LBC backed squad was resolute in holding up their 4-4-1 defensive position. Half chances were made but the defenses held on forcing the game into a penalty shootout.\n\nWith the score at two apiece, Ceres’ Louie Casas blocked the shot of Kaya’s third kicker in Kenshiro Daniels. The penalty was ordered to be retaken after the linesman adjudged the keeper to have come off the line before the shot was made. The retake however was also saved by Casas putting the pressure on Kaya.\n\nPaul Mulders’ weak penalty was easily saved by O’donnel while Christian Ayew made no mistake putting the underdogs in the lead. O’donnel again saved another after a Martin Steuble penalty which forced a Ceres save in the next kick in order to stay alive. The Ceres goalkeeper guessed the right way but Louis Clarks’ bottom corner strike sealed the deal for Kaya for their first UFL title after many years.\n\nBy Ivan Gayares (@ivangeoffrey)\n\nCeres-La Salle FC scored a 2-0 win against a tough Kaya squad to move one point away from the League title.\n\nBienve Marañon and Adri Gallardo scored the goals but a great defensive performance from the Ceres backline and goalkeeper Michael Casas made the difference in the game.\n\nThe game was as good as advertised as both teams were out to get a result. Kaya threatened first with a 20-yard rocket of a free kick from Chris Greatwich in the 6th minute which went over the bar. Ceres also tried five minutes after when a hastily taken free kick found it’s way to Gallardo who found himself one on one with Kaya keeper Nick O’donnel. Gallardo blasted one towards the goal but the young keeper came up with a great reaction save.\n\nIn the 14th minute, Kaya’s Christian Ayew tried his luck from top of the box but Casas easily collected the shot. It was a chess match in the first twenty as both defenses did not allow any passes through the final third.\n\nCeres were dangerous in the 21st when Martin Steuble snuck in a free kick to Marañon who blasted his shot wide. Kaya returned the favor a minute after when Ayew layed off to Greatwich whose shot was took a deflection went inches wide of the top corner.\n\nOJ Porteria fired a shot which was again deflected dangerously toward goal in the 24th but Casas was there to provide a superb save. It was an open game for both teams as they heavily relied on counter attacks to overcome the defenses of both squads.\n\nThe opening goal came in the 39th minute when Patrick Reichelt did a beautiful turn to beat his man on the right flank. He then pushed the ball up till the goal line when he released a cross towards a rushing Jeong Woo Lee. Lee smartly let the ball through his legs drawing the defense to him and allowing Marañon to poke the ball just enough to get past the goal line for the. The half ended with Ceres leading 1-0.\n\nThe Bacolod-based squad were dangerous early in the second half when they got back to back chances in the 51st minute. Patrick Reichelt snuck in a cross to a rushing Gallardo but O’donnel was there to snuff out the chance, Moments later, Lee broke away from the left flank only to shoot over the goal.\n\nIt was eight minutes later when Manu Ott got the ball from the middle and made a solo run towards the Kaya half. He then flicked the ball towards the direction of Gallardo who was marked by Kaya Captain Masa Omura. Omura tried to clear the ball which glanced off his head towards Gallardo who had enough space to pick his spot and beat O’donnel for the second Ceres goal.\n\nKaya had a golden chance to score on a one-on-one a minute later but Porteria’s shot went wide of the second post. Porteria again had a chance in the 68th but his six-yard shot was equalled by a super save from Casas.\n\nThe LBC-backed squad put in substitutes in Joven Bedic and Diego Barrera to revitalize their attack which then paid dividends when Barrera hit a curling shot towards the goal. The ball spun out of Casas hands but the veteran immediately collected the ball over his shoulder.\n\nKaya produced chances at the end of injury time but were again denied by a Michael Casas reaction save and a goal-line clearance from Orman Okunaiya. The match ended 2-0 with Ceres getting the valuable three points to push their lead to 9 points over global with three games at hand. Kaya are 12 points behind with four games to play.\n\nThe game then became a card-fest after successive fouls from the opposing teams. This was highlighted when Barrera clipped Steuble after losing the ball which made the Azkal furious. Both players seemed to be in the Christmas Spirit as they gave each other extra-physical plays and sweet nothings until Steuble was substituted because of injury. The match ended with a total of 9 yellow cards given to both teams.\n\nThe match saw an inspired defensive performance from the Ceres backline to deliver the much coveted win against Kaya. Jason Sabio, Sang Min Kim, Juan Guirado, and Yong Chan “Victorino” Son performed very well against a very quick Kaya squad.\n\nMichael Casas delivered another superb performance deserving of another call-up with the Azkals. Kaya had eight shots on target compared to Ceres’ five but Casas and his timely saves proved to be the difference.\n\nLeague Leaders Ceres-La Salle FC bounced back from a disappointing draw with Global to drub Green Archers United 7-0 last July 15 at the Rizal Memorial Football Stadium.\n\nLeague topscorer Adri Gallardo scored a hat trick while Jeong Woo Lee and Bienve Marañon both hit a brace. Juani Guirado also scored for the Bacolod-based squad.\n\nIt was an easy win for Ceres who were relentless in the early going with Gallardo completing his hat trick after 19 minutes. Gallardo got assists from Lee and Jason Sabio for the first two goals and had an individual goal for his third.\n\nThe Archers started the game without number one Paolo Pascual due to injury and was replaced with veteran Kim Versales. Versales had a busy first twenty minutes collecting crosses and swatting shots but was overcome by a feisty Ceres attack.\n\nUnited also had a chance with Jhan Melliza in the 27th but Mike Casas was there to snuff out the chance. Lee made it 4-0 for Ceres in the 41st. The Archers’ Jimuel Arriola had a chance five minutes after but he couldnt convert.\n\nThe second half saw the Archers threatening early but Marañon made it 5-0 five minutes after the restart. In the 57th, Robert Lopez Mendy had a chance but his header from a free kick was over the bar.\n\nIt was 6-0 in the 61st when Marañon converted a penalty kick from a foul commited against him.\n\nThe Green and White squad had a chance in the 80th with veteran Tatinf Pasilan but his shot was out wide.\n\nCeres completed the route in the last minute when lee lobbed the ball over the keeper to complete the 7-0 win.\n\nThe Archers end their impressive four game winning streak against league leaders Ceres who were eager to bounce back from their second half collapse in a draw against Global.\n\nCeres-La Salle will need two more wins to secure the League title with their next assignment against formidable Kaya FC on Sunday. The first game saw Global FC hammering Team Socceroo for a 6-0 win. (@ivangeoffrey)\n\nDefending league Champions Global overcame a 2-nil halftime deficit to secure a 2-2 draw with Ceres-La Salle FC last July 12 at the Rizal Memorial Stadium.\n\nRed-hot Misagh Bahadoran came up with an equalizer to frustrate the league leaders from an easy route to the title.\n\nIt was an exciting few days before the game as the fixtures were only set days before the match as league and cup matches were realigned for separation.\n\nGlobal started withour regulars in Mark Hartmann who was out with an injury and Daisuke Sato who had accumulated yellow cards.\n\nBoth teams had defensive adjustments in their lineup with Ceres’ Martin Steuble starting at left back and Global’s Ray Jonsson covering for Sato’s original spot.\n\nThe Bacolod-squad started out strong producing clear chanches on goal which was highligted by a beauty in the 12th minute by Bienvenido Maranon. The spanish winger who had space in the right chipped the ball beautifully over Global’s Patrick Deyto to score the opener.\n\nManu Ott doubled the advantage for Ceres when he shot an inch perfect twenty-yard free kick eight minutes after.\n\nGlobal showed some fire in the latter part of the second half to find gaps in the Ceres defense and produce some good chances especially in the dying minutes. The half ended with a 2-0 scoreline in favor of Ceres.\n\nAt halftime, Leigh Manson put in Izzo El Habbib and OJ Clarino to revitalize the Global attack with the intention to press the Ceres defense for a goal.\n\nThe gamble paid off for Global as they secured early chances for the Dan Palami squad. It was in the 60th minute when Global pulled one back after a Matthew Hartman free kick hit the underside of the crossbar which was then nodded in by Clarino on the rebound.\n\nIt was a good exchange of chances in the final thirty minutes with Global having the more dangerous opportunities. Bahadoran came through for Global in the 79th as he skirted the Ceres defense and shot to the bottom corner beyond Mike Casas’ reach.\n\nEl Habbib almost made it three for Global after the restart when he was given a free shot on top of the box that went over the bar. Both teams had good chances in the last ten minutes but none was converted. The match ended with both teams spliting points.\n\nGlobal moved to 4th place while Ceres maintained top spot. Ceres would need to win three out of their last five games to secure the league title. IVG\n\nAn early hat-trick by Adrian Gallardo Valdes set the tone for Ceres-La Salle’s 5-0 win over Pachanga-Diliman FC in the United Football League First Division last June 23 at the Rizal Memorial Stadium.\n\nGallardo topscored with four goals with Lee Jeong Woo adding one against hos former team.\n\nIt didn’t take long for the tie to be broken as Ceres found the back of the net four minutes after kickoff when a Jeff Christaens corner skipped all the way to the second post to a waiting Gallardo. The spanish striker didn’t waste the chance to put one past Steve Yambo.\n\nThe Bacolod squad put on the pressure as newcomer Bienve Maranon had a golden chance blocked by the Pachanga defense in the 11th. He again found space five minutes after but his shot went straight to Yambo.\n\nPachanga had its first chance when Gerardo Valmayor shot from twenty yards in the 26th minute but was wide if the post.\n\nThe Bacolod squad still owned the play and had consecutive chances ruled offside.\n\nIn the 33rd, Nate Burkey forced a cross from the goal line and the ball ended up with Maranon who unselfishly lays off to Gallardo who got his 2nd after blasting it to the top corner.\n\nValmayor again tried his luck in the 35th with a quick turn and shot at the edge of the box but it was easily saved by Ceres’ Ed Sacapano.\n\nGallardo made it 3-0 one minute after when Maru Angeles beat the offside trap from the right wing where assisted Gallardo who slotted it in the bottom corner.\n\nJist before halftime, Pachanga’s Anto Gonzales injured his ankle after inadvertently colliding with Juani Guirado.\n\nGallardo made it 4-0 in the 58th minute when he broke free in the right wing and put another one past the Diliman goal.\n\nThe spanish forward missed the previous game against Loyola due to uniform issues but picked up where he left off to solidify his spot as the league’s top scorer.\n\nIn the 68th, Pachange had a golden chance in the counter attack led by Valmayor. The San Carlos native cut the ball back to Stephen Permanes who released the ball to Danial Gadia. Gadia however was found wanting with his poor finish.\n\nThings got more interesting in the end when Nate Burkey rounded out the Pachanga keeper only for his succeeding strike to be cleared off the line by Reuben Silitonga in the 84th minute.\n\nLee had his shot saved by Yambo after getting a “Rabona” pass from compatriate Kyum Son Cho.\n\nCeres however closed the deal one minute after injury time when Arnie Pasinabo assisted Lee to complete the 5-0 route of the Diliman Squad. IVG\n\nBy Ivan Gayares (@ivangeoffrey)\n\nNewcomer Bienvenido Marañon scored a brilliant hat trick as Ceres-La Salle FC came from a goal down to demolish Loyola-Meralco Sparks 6-1. National Player Patrick Reichelt scored a brace while substitute Jeffrey Christaens completed the tally for Ceres.\n\nLoyola started the game with intensity which was highlighted by the 18th minute foal from new signing Bradley Grayson. The Meralco backed-squad was rewarded for their early pressure when Grayson broke free from the defense to put up a shot which was tapped by Ceres Keeper Louis Michael Casas but eventually went in.\n\nIt wasn’t long after when Ceres’ Reichelt found himself in a similar situation in the 25th minute. The Azkals mainstay shot was tapped by Loyola’s Tomas Trigo but the ball still found its way to the bottom corner for the equalizer.\n\nA handball in front of the goal in the 26th minute forced referee Linjun Talaver to call for a penalty against the Sparks which Marañon cooly converted for his first goal and the Ceres lead.\n\nThe Spanish player doubled his output in the dying minutes of the first half when he scored from the narrowest of angles to make it 3-1 for the Bacolod squad. The Loyola keeper expected a Marañon cross from the goal line but was surprised by a strike which went between him and the first post.\n\nTwelve minutes after halftime, Reichelt broke away from the Sparks defense after a Marañon delivery to score the fourth goal for Ceres. Loyola also had their chances but the resolute Ceres backline and the timely saves of Casas prevented them from getting another goal.\n\nMarañon completed his hat trick in the 71st minute. He also added in assist the the 85th when he cut back a goal-line cross to an onrushing Christaens who completed the demolition of Loyola with their sixth goal.\n\nThe 29-year old spanish player who last played for UD Socuellamos in Segunda B – Group 2, the third tier football league in Spain, proved that he was a game changer and a great signing for the USLS-affiliated squad.\n\nIt was an emphatic win for the Bacolod squad who were a bit rusty early in the game after to a month long layoff. The win cements their lead temporarily to six points from number two team Stallion FC who still has a game in hand against Global.\n\nLoyola will play Team Socceroo while Ceres will lock horns with the Pachanga for a midweek clash on June 23.\n\nIn the first game, Green Archers United outplayed Pachanga Diliman 9-5 in the highest ever goal output for a first division game this year. Robert Lopez Mendy topscored for the Archers who are\n\nThe second half of league play was shortened due to the pullout of Philippine Army FC from which effectively ends the relegation battle between Army and Socceroo."
