        "text": "The Philippines Football League (PFL) is set for a grand launch on April 21 for what is deemed to be the first professional league for football in the country. Here are some key talking points of the upcoming league prior to its launch.\n\nWhat is the PFL?\n\nFor the benefit of readers outside of Philippine Football, the PFL is a professional football league in the Philippines that will be considered the highest level of mens football competition in the country. The league will see eight participating football clubs from all over the Philippines namely: Ilocos United, JPV Marikina, Kaya FC – Makati, Loyola Meralco Sparks, Stallion Laguna, Global Cebu, Ceres-Negros, and Davao Aguilas.\n\nThe eight teams will play a double-round home and away fixture that will see teams play 28 games each where they will play each other four times. The top four teams will will feature in what is called the Final Series where they will compete in home-and-away semifinal legs with the semifinal winners playing in a one game Grand Final. The league will also serve as a qualifier for the Philippines in the AFC Champions League and the AFC Cup.\n\nLeague details? What details?\n\nFans and the media alike have been in the dark with regard to the specifics of the league. High level information has been provided by PFF leadership regarding the participating teams, competition format, and official tv partner but basic things like the league logo, an initial fixture list, and official media platforms such as a website and facebook page were not made available in advance. Many superfans have resorted to creating their own support pages to generate discussion and even content to hype up the league.\n\nA ‘Philippines Football League – PFL’ page exists but it seems to be made by a fan. I tried to create facebook pages under the Entertainment > Sports League category with the names of ‘Philippines Football League’ and ‘PFL’ and was successful. Also tried to create a duplicate PBA page under the same category but was not allowed to by the platform. My little experiment may not prove much but these little details or lack thereof may be telling. I’ll hold on to the facebook pages temporarily for safekeeping. In the case of match fixtures, they can be delayed given that a deal for broadcast has only been made recently and picking games for broadcast is known to be a difficult exercise. The mention of a logo being included in the launch gives everyone hope that most of the basics would be available come Friday.\n\nThe teams are ready to play\n\nThe only thing that is assured of in the league from the surface is that all the participating teams are ready to play. Global, Ceres, and Stallion started their pre-season early with the first two teams competing in continental competition. Stallion meanwhile has been the busiest with pre-season matches as early as January, a team and stadium launch, and an invitational tournament that was joined by most teams. Former United Football League teams like JP Voltes, Loyola, and Kaya have ramped up their preparation and tune-up games in the last few months to keep in step of the first three. The two debutantes in Davao Aguilas and Ilocos United seemed to have finalized their pool of players with Ilocos getting more familiar names and Davao doing a training camp with their young core in Singapore.\n\nThe teams have also secured their home stadiums, a task that is a feat in itself considering that most of the infrastructure is owned mostly by city and provincial governments. Securing the stadium is only half the problem as the improvements to the infrastructure and most importantly the field of play are necessary. The Marikina Sports Stadium pitch for example needs some improvement as a recent photo showed some areas of dryness and overuse. Most stadiums might also need to meet the minimum security criteria with the exception of Panaad and Rizal Memorial which has already passed stringent AFC standards.\n\nWhat do we expect from the launch?\n\nThe official invite of the event describes it as the ‘Official Launch and Draw Ceremony’ of the Philippines Football League. The launch component is expected to provide all the finer details in the league and hopefully answers to the different details mentioned previously. Official league sponsors may also be present in the launch to promote the partnerships who will help bring the league forward.\n\nWhat has not been mentioned though is the purpose of the draw ceremony. My best guess is that the draw will be the final step to fill-in an already made first round schedule and replace Team Numbers with actual club names. The opening match might be determined by this exercise.\n\nPhoto from the United Football League Philippines\n\nThe Philippine Azkals and Harimau Malaysia are set to square off for a friendly on March 22 in preparation for the 2019 Asian Cup qualifying with both teams coming into the match with contrasting fortunes.\n\nSome luck for the Philippines\n\nIt’s no secret that Philippine club football is in a temporary hiatus, with the Philippine Football Federation leadership preparing for its forthcoming National League, putting the domestic game to a halt. The Azkals are lucky however because a good portion of its core players are participating in the AFC Cup for Ceres-Negros and Global removing doubts on fitness issues brought about by the extended break. Both clubs have been playing at a high level regularly since February and players from these clubs are expected to be favorites in the starting eleven.\n\nIt also helps that some players are coming in from abroad where fitness and timing is not an issue. Neil Etheridge and Daisuke Sato are coming in from Europe where the football season is at its peak. Javier Patino and Mike Ott are also coming in from China and Thailand whose leagues have already commenced. The rest of the local players will have some catching up to do on their local counterparts. Loyola’s James and Phil Younghusband, Kaya’s Kenshiro Daniels, and Stallion’s Fitch Arboleda have\n\nIssues for Malaysia\n\nThe Malaysians however have a different story with domestic and International issues putting preparations for the Asian Cup qualifying on-hold. The Football Association of Malaysia will hold a major election which will include the presidency of Malaysia’s football governing body. A win by favorite Tunku Sultan Ismail, owner of Malaysian powerhouse Johor Darul Ta’zim, could mean a big change for the national squad.\n\nReports say that current Malaysia Coach Ong Kim Swee could be on his way out with the possibility of a former JDT Coach coming in to manage the squad. Many of JDTs stars have prematurely retired from international football in 2016, following complaints on training methods, but the retirements were largely viewed as political move from the Johorian club in protest of the current FAM administration. Their return and the coaching change could be a big boost for Malaysian football but will somewhat peg the national team back to square one in terms of preparation.\n\nThe recent diplomatic tensions between Malaysia and North Korea have forced the Malaysian government to ban the Malaysian squad from playing their March 28 match in Pyongyang. The banhas forced the AFC to move the match to a neutral venue with the date set back to June 8.\n\nWhat’s at stake\n\nFor the Philippines, cohesion leading into next weeks opening match with Nepal is the target for home squad. The schedule between the international break and the AFC Cup has been tight leaving the players with less time to rest and prepare against Malaysia. With players dishing out good performances in the regional stage, the Azkals would be fighting for their place in the starting eleven.\n\nFor Malaysia, the current team is determined to get a win for their Coach who has been a true professional in dealing with the current issues and is still grieving with a loss in his family. The match will also serve as an audition of the current squad should changes occur in the new FAM administration.\n\nThe recent use of FIFA rankings as a seeding tool in World Cup and Asian Cup qualifying by the AFC would also mean that Asian teams could no longer take International friendlies for granted. A win is necessary as a it could spell the difference in the qualifying draws for future tournaments.\n\nBoth teams last played to two 0-0 draws in 2014 with matches held in Selayang and Cebu. The two matches also served as debuts for Thomas Dooley and Ong Kim Swee as coaches of their respective teams.\n\nThe match will be played on Wednesday (Mar 22) with kickoff scheduled at 730PM. There will be no local tv coverage but a livestream will be made available at the PFF website.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPhoto from Felda United Wikepedia Page\n\nFELDA United was established in 2007 by the Federal Land Development Authority, a Malaysian government entity. Also known as “The Fighters”, the club has been in and out of the Malaysian Premier League and the Malaysian Super League since its existence with its best finish in last year’s top flight placing second to JDT in the MSL.\n\nFELDA was at the top of the table most of the first half of the league but JDT bounced back in the latter half earning 58 points in a historic unbeaten season with FELDA producing 43. Malaysian pundits declared at the start of the season that FELDA United will have difficulty emulating last year’s finish because of a coaching and foreign player change. Mohamad Nik is the caretaker manager after appointed coach Azmi Mohamed left after the club’s third game.\n\nPlayers to Watch\n\nForeign Players\n\nThe Asian Football Confederation (AFC) employs a 3+1 foreign player rule where 3 Non-Asians and 1 Asian player can be included in the line-up of different clubs. This allows the development of local talent within the country and the continent.\n\n#5 Moutaz Jounaidi (Defender)\n\nThe Lebanese defender has represented his country many times in international level and is currently the main centerback for FELDA United. The 30-year old is very experienced using his height (1.88m) to command control at the back. Pairs well with either Nor Fazly or Shukor Adan for the central defense.\n\n#8 Lucas Cano (Forward)\n\nThe Argentinean striker is currently on loan to Felda United. Almost breaching 6 feet and just 21years of age, the lanky striker has already scored four times for the squad this season and will be the target man for the visiting side.\n\n#23 Gastón Cellerino (Forward)\n\nThe veteran striker has been a journeyman in South America, Europe, and the United States. The 30-year old has come off the bench in both AFC Cup matches playing in either striker or winger. Standing at 1.85m, this Argentinean forward will be another threat for the Malaysian outfit.\n\n#8 Zah Rahan Krangar (Midfielder)\n\nThe Liberian midfielder has been a mainstay of FELDA and was instrumental in their winning record last year. The 32-year old has played for his national team and was a long time player in the Indonesian circuit scoring 60-plus goals in ten years. The diminutive player (1.65m) moved to FELDA in 2014 and has scored plenty since.\n\nLocal Players\n\n#9 Norsharul Idlan (Forward)\n\nThe 30-year old veteran is one of FELDA’s key signings this season. He brings himself a wealth of experience in the top flight and International experience as one of Malaysa’s better strikers. Norsharul was one of the most sought after players during his prime.\n\n#7 Stuart Wark (Midfielder)\n\nThe Scottish-Malaysian midfielder played for JDT last year with him trying his luck with FELDA in the current season. Influential in the midfield using his strength to his advantage, the defensive midfielder has started both AFC Cup games.\n\n#27 Hadin Azman (Midfielder)\n\nOne of Malaysia’s talented youngsters at the age of 22, the midfielder can play either side of the wing and even attack from the middle. A former youngster in JDT who took his chance in FELDA for a starting role in 2015, he has since thrived in his attacking roles with 9 goals in 30+ appearances.\n\n#12 Shukor Adan (Midfielder/Defender)\n\nShukor Adan is one of Malaysia’s most popular players. Having played a while until his international retirement in 2014, this 37-year old has been regarded to be one of the best defensive midfielders in Malaysian history with 50 caps to his name. Currently he plays both centre mid and central defence for FELDA.\n\nPossible Formation & First XI\n\nStrengths\n\nVery good offensive awareness by attacking players\n\nVery good counterattack\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMany of the local players are past their prime\n\nInconsistent backline\n\nOpportunities\n\nInjuries or experiments have cause different backline combinations\n\nYellow card situation (4 yellows)\n\nOffensive approach by away team (Must win for Felda)\n\nThreats\n\nImproving run of form\n\nDesperate football (Must win for Felda)\n\nTactics\n\nFelda has scored twice in the tournament with both goals coming from long range. Opportunistic strikes that punished both opposing keepers. The Malaysian outfit is naturally a good counter attacking team but have some difficulty building up against good defensive teams.\n\nFelda United will approach the game with a 4-2-3-1 to maximize the efficiency of #10 Zah Krangar behind the striker #8 Lucas Cano. The Malaysian squad did well against Hanoi by scoring early but conceded late in injury time. Their tall strikers as the defensive target have allowed their midfielders some creativity in the midfield. Zah Krangar, might be small, but he has been a good engine up front with his mind off defensive duties that is taken care of by Stuart and Syahid.\n\nOnly one of the Argentine strikers are used in most of the games as they accommodate the highly paid veteran Norsharul on the left and young player Hadin on the right. Things might be different in the next game as either one of the wings might be given up ion the attempt to win the game. Expect FELDA to press well and attempt to get an early goal.\n\nThe back four is a tricky subject. The usual centerback pairing is the Lebanese Mootaz with veteran Norfazly but injuries might have forced Felda to use Captain Shukor Adan as centerback. FELDA have plenty of options for their wingbacks but they are believed to be available for MD3. The central defense seems to be the weakest part of FELDA and they must be tested comprehensively.\n\nWith the current AFC Cup format, FELDA has no choice but to force a win against Ceres in order to keep their hopes of progression alive. Hard pressing is expected from the visiting side including a high line which the home team should attempt to capitalize.\n\nHighlights\n\nTampines vs Felda (Highlights)\n\nFelda vs JDT (Full Match)\n\nFelda vs Hanoi (Highlights)\n\nIts Philippines versus Malaysia this week in the 2017 AFC Cup and nothing but fireworks are expected in both ties. Johor Darul Ta’zim will host Global Cebu in Johor on March 14 while Ceres-Negros will face FELDA United in Bacolod the day after.\n\nJDT v Global\n\nMalaysia Super League Champions Johor Darul Ta’zim will meet United Football League Champions Global Cebu FC in a Group F tie on Tuesday. It will be the first meeting of both squads in AFC competition with the top spot for Group F will be at stake. Global is still perfect after two matches highlighted by their recent 2-0 win against Boeung Ket Ankor in Phnom Penh. JDT played its reserve unit in match day 2 and settled for a 1-1 draw with ten men against Magwe in Yangon and the Malaysian champions are out to recoup lost points in this tight race to the top.\n\nWith JDT expected to bring out its best eleven, interesting individual battles will be seen throughout the match. Philippine International Misagh Bahadoran and Trinidadian Darryl Roberts and will have to deal with the defensive partnership of Malaysia’s Junior Eldstal and Brazilian Marcos Antonio. Former Azkal Paul Mulders will be pitted against former Malaysia Captain Safiq Rahim in a key battle in midfield. Global’s Amani Aguinaldo and Brazilian Wesley dos Santos will have a tough task ahead against Hazwan Bakri and Argentinian Gabriel Guerra.\n\nJDT last played a Philippine squad in Kaya FC with a 7-2 trashing at Larkin stadium in the Round of 16 of the 2016 AFC Cup. Global is keen to improve its record in the AFC Cup against Malaysian teams after getting double 0-0 draws against Pahang in the 2015 edition. Though pundits have marked JDT as the favorites in this match, Global is keen for an upset in front of the Johor fans. The match will kickoff at 845pm in Johor.\n\nCeres vs Felda\n\nCeres-Negros FC will host Felda United in Match Day 3 of Group G in the AFC Cup. Ceres has just come-off from a 5-0 win against Tampines Rovers which elevated them into first spot in the group. Felda almost came off with its first win against Hanoi at the Shah Alam stadium but the Vietnamese squad came up with a last minute goal for the 1-1draw. Both squads qualified for the group stages of the tournament after placing second in their respective leagues last year.\n\nCeres has had a history of tough matches against Malaysian clubs especially against Selangor in last year’s AFC Cup. Their opening match in Bacolod saw Selangor scoring first with a brilliant free kick from Hafiz Kamal until Ceres equalized late with a Stephan Schrock strike. Both teams played the second leg in the Selayang Municipal Stadium where Ceres forced a 0-0 draw which consequently allowed them to qualify for the Round of Sixteen of the 2016 AFC Cup.\n\nThe tie will feature a new challenge for both squads in all areas of the pitch. Fernando Ceres’ Spaniards Rodriguez and Bienvenido Maranon will slug it out with central defenders in Lebanese Mootaz Jounaidi and Malaysian legend Shukor Adan. Manny Ott will have to deal with Scottish-Malaysian defensive midfielder Stuart Wark in the midfield. Argentinean striker Lucas Cano and Liberian Zah Krangar will be a handful for Carli de Murga and Super Herrera.\n\nThe Bacolod squad will gun for a second straight victory but the visitors are fully aware that a win is the only way for them to reach the next round of the tournament. A capacity crowd is again expected at the Panaad Stadium to support the home team. The match will be aired at 7PM on Wednesday.\n\nPhotos from AFC Cup/Lagardere Sports\n\nPhoto from Hanoi FC Facebook Page\n\nThe club formerly known as Hanoi T&T has been one of the most dominant clubs in Vietnamese football, finishing no less than second for the last seven years in the top flight, winning it three times. Hanoi qualified to the AFC Cup as the 2016 champions of V.League 1 which also allowed them to participate in the preliminary rounds of the AFC Champions League (ACL). The club been participating in the ACL preliminaries and playoff the past few years but has always fell short of the group stage when facing tougher opposition in the final playoff match.\n\nVietnamese clubs have never dropped back to the AFC Cup after near misses in the ACL because of its higher ranking. It was only till this year when Hong Kong overtook Vietnam in the seeding which allowed the Vietnamese clubs to participate in the group stages of the AFC Cup.\n\nThe Hanoi club got a taste of Asian football when it met Kitchee in the preliminaries of the ACL last January. Hanoi FC was leading 1-0 ten minutes from time but Kitchee got back to force a win in extra time. The 2016 V.League 1 champions are currently third in the domestic table, just two points behind erstwhile Than Hoa, after being nicked by SHB Da Nang for a draw in their last match.\n\nPlayers to Watch\n\nForeign Players\n\nThe Asian Football Confederation (AFC) employs a 3+1 foreign player rule where 3 Non-Asians and 1 Asian player can be included in the line-up of different clubs. This allows the development of local talent within the country and the continent.\n\n#77 Alvaro Silva (Defender)\n\nThe Filipino-Spanish centerback has been in Asia for the last three seasons with stints in Kuwait and Korea before moving to Hanoi this season. Silva has played for the Azkals for a couple of games and has not returned since. The defender is tall and agile but chemistry with his new team is still an issue.\n\n#20 Gonzalo Marronkle (Forward)\n\nThe Argentinean striker has been with Hanoi since 2009 and has figured in all of its recent success. This 32-year old is known for his goal scoring ability, aside from his height (1.92m), and is a threat from anywhere in the box.\n\n#99 Loris Arnaud (Forward)\n\nThe French striker is a product of the PSG academy and has been a journeyman around France for the last few years. He is the third choice striker behind Gonzalo and Samson in Hanoi.\n\n#8 Moses Oloya (Midfielder)\n\nThe Ugandan midfielder moved to Vietnam six years ago as a teenager and has since played in the country for five years and getting a stint in Russia in 2016. Now 24 years old, Oloya has signed for Hanoi and has been fighting for a slot in a very talented pool of midfielders. He is a versatile midfielder that can do both holding and attacking positions.\n\nLocal Players\n\n#10 Nquyen Van Quyet (Forward)\n\nOne of the most recognizable faces in Vietnamese football, Van Quyet is a mainstay of the National Team being one of the most talented attacking players in the country. He can play as a striker, winger, and attacking midfielder with a preference to the right side of the pitch. Still young at 25, this player is the perfect complement for Hanoi’s foreign born strikers.\n\n#7 Pham Thanh Luong (Midfield)\n\nDo not underestimate him for his size (1.61m), Than Luong has already helped his country win the AFF Cup at the tender age of 20 with his pace and lethal finishing. Now 28, the Vietnam national team veteran is still a thorn in the left side of the midfield because of his unpredictability and knack on goal.\n\n#19 Nguyen Quang Hai (Midfielder)\n\nNguyen Quang Hai is the future of Vietnamese football. At 19 years of age, he has shown the quality of being a versatile attacker and a very intelligent footballer. He is deployed on the left flank to make use of his preferred left foot.\n\n#36 Hoang Vu Samson (Forward)\n\nThe Nigerian-born player acquired his Vietnamese citizenship in 2013 which allows him to play as a local for Hanoi. Initially playing as a striker, Samson is flexible enough to play in the midfield in this loaded Hanoi attack. He has won scoring titles in V.League 1 and has the highest scoring percentage in the league in the last few years. He is tall, strong, fast, and has a very high rating in scoring awareness.\n\nPossible Formation & First XI\n\nStrengths\n\nDeep pool of players with low average age\n\nQuality local players (National, U23, U19)\n\nFamiliarity of foreign attacking players (>5 years)\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNew foreign center back (Alvaro)\n\nPoor run of form (Loss-Draw-Draw)\n\nOpportunities\n\nOverconfidence by Coaching Staff as seen on Champions League\n\nThreats\n\nHanoi players in shape (7 games played)\n\nBad results means AFC Cup game is a must win\n\nCold Temperature in Hanoi\n\nTactics\n\nThe Hanoi Coach will bring in his best 11 in response to the AFC Champions League defeat where he tried to use more young players in the match. He might not play the French striker (Arnaud) because of poor form and the presence of Gonzalo. The 20-year old player Duy Manh will be chosen over Moses in the defensive midfield as he is considered as one of Vietnam’s best at his tender age.\n\nHanoi plays 4-1-4-1 defensively but somehow transitions to a flexible 4-3-3 offensively. The left and right midfielders are all interchangeable, Quang Hai 19 and Thanh Luong 11 on the left can switch as winger and attacking mid at any time with each other. Van Quyet 11 and Samson 39 can also interchange with themselves on the right. Expect a lot of creativity and passing in the midfield as and Thanh Luong and Van Quyet are the best players in Vietnam for their position. The veterean players including Samson have the freedom to break formation and attack, Quang Hai is usually the one left behind just because he is the younger player but he is a threat from distance as well.\n\nThe back four are very quick and disciplined to a certain limit. Hanoi is very resilient in the first clearances in danger areas but they are still very shaky. Alvaro and Dai Dong still have a lack of understanding that the Ceres attack can score from. They are good in individual defense but the weakness in their partnership is the second ball, especially with Dai Dong. The two wingbacks are young and needs to be tested throughout the match.\n\nHanoi will be expected to go on an all-out attack because of their highly technical players and deep bench. If the team is not careful, it will be an early 2-0 lead for the hosts given their early start in the season. The visiting team must be precise in their finishing to get a goal as chances will be few.\n\nSquad List\n\nNo. Nationality Position Player Age Height National Team others\n\n18 Vietnam GK Trần Anh Đức 25 1.8 –\n\n30 Vietnam GK Nguyễn Văn Công 24 1.82 Vietnam U23\n\n33 Vietnam GK Phí Minh Long 22 1.8 Vietnam\n\n2 Vietnam DF Nguyễn Đại Đồng 30 – –\n\n4 Vietnam DF Nguyễn Văn Dũng 22 1.74 Vietnam U21\n\n5 Vietnam DF Nguyễn Văn Biển 31 1.73 Vietnam\n\n7 Vietnam DF Sầm Ngọc Đức 24 1.7 Vietnam\n\n13 Vietnam DF Trần Văn Kiên 20 – –\n\n15 Vietnam DF Nguyễn Minh Hải 23 – Vietnam U20\n\n16 Vietnam DF Nguyễn Thành Chung 19 – –\n\n17 Vietnam DF Doan Van Hau 19 Vietnam U19\n\n77 Philippines DF Álvaro Silva Linares 32 1.87 Azkals\n\n89 Vietnam DF Đào Duy Khánh 23 1.83 Vietnam U23\n\n6 Vietnam MF Đặng Văn Tới – – –\n\n8 Uganda MF Moses Oloya 24 1.83 Russian League\n\n11 Vietnam MF Phạm Thành Lương 28 1.61 Vietnam left + right\n\n23 Vietnam MF Nguyễn Hải An 28 1.67 –\n\n28 Vietnam MF Đỗ Duy Mạnh 20 1.8 Vietnam\n\n29 Vietnam MF Phạm Đức Huy 22 1.73 Vietnam U23\n\n74 Vietnam MF Trương Văn Thái Quý 19 1.71 Vietnam U19\n\n88 Vietnam MF Đỗ Hùng Dũng – – Vietnam U23\n\n9 Vietnam FW Phạm Văn Thành 22 1.75 Vietnam U21\n\n10 Vietnam FW Nguyen Van Quyet 25 1.72 Vietnam right footed\n\n19 Vietnam FW Nguyễn Quang Hải 19 1.64 Vietnam U23 left footed\n\n20 Argentina FW Gonzalo Marronkle 32 1.92 Portugal League left footed\n\n39 Vietnam FW Hoàng Vũ Samson 28 1.82 * Nigerian right footed\n\n92 Vietnam FW Trịnh Duy Long – – –\n\n98 Vietnam FW Hồ Minh Dĩ – – –\n\n99 France FW Loris Arnaud 29 1.84\n\nFilipino clubs Global FC and Ceres-Negros FC will have a more challenging path towards the final of Asia’s second-tier club football tournament after recent changes in its competition format.\n\nThe AFC Cup has since deviated from its usual east-west format to a new zonal one which will feature five different zones across Asia namely: West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, ASEAN, and East Asia. West Asia and ASEAN Zones will have three groups while the rest will only have one each. The new format also allows more teams to join the group stage, with this years competition having 34 teams and possibly stretching it to 36 in the future.\n\nNext round qualification will also be different this year as the tournament will name Zonal winners who will move on to the latter rounds of the competition. With Global and Ceres both in the ASEAN groups, they will have to be the top teams of their group or be the best runner up of the three groups to qualify for the four-team ASEAN Zonal semi final.\n\nThe Filipino clubs will need to endure a two-legged zonal semifinal and another two-legged zonal final in order to win the ASEAN Zone, unlike other groups which only need to top the group stage to be declared zone winners. The West Asia Zone, which also has the groups, will also need a zonal semi-final and final but the West Asia winners have the incentive to go straight to the AFC Cup final.\n\nIf winning the ASEAN Zone will be tough enough for the Pinoy squads, the Inter-Zone playoff will be another tough nut to crack as they will have to face the other well-rested zonal winners who would have played four games less. The Inter-Zone playoffs will entail another level of two-legged semifinal and final matches before the remaining AFC Cup finalist is declared.\n\nFor this years tournament, East Asia will have the shortest path to the tournament needing only to get results in 8 games to reach the final as they have only three participants in their group. They are followed by West Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia with 10 games while ASEAN will need to hurdle 14 games before doing so.\n\nThe lack of domestic competition will be a big challenge in Ceres and Global’s AFC Cup campaign as top squads from other ASEAN nations are already 5-6 games in their domestic campaigns. With the Philippines Football League still in the works, both teams need to shake their cobwebs fast to match the pace of their opponents. Kaya and Ceres’ good performance in AFC Cup group stages was attributed to both teams playing in the UFL Cup which started a few weeks before the AFC tournament last year.\n\nNevertheless, both teams will be eager to eclipse the historic round of 16 achievement of 2016. AFC Cup action starts on February 21 with Global facing Myanmar champions Magwe in Rizal Memorial while Ceres will travel to Vietnam to play juggernaut Hanoi FC.\n\nCeres-La Salle FC have secured home advantage in the AFC Cup Round of 16 and out to get an upset is Hong Kong’s South China AA.\n\nPhoto from South China AA Wikipedia Page\n\nSouth China Athletic Association is Hong Kong’s most successful club scoring the most first division titles (41) in its 112 years of existence. The club has participated in the AFC Cup 7 time since 2008 reaching the semifinal in 2009. Also known as “Chinese Temple”, this storied club reached the quarterfinals in last years AFC Cup yielding to eventual champions in Malaysia’s Johor Darul Ta’zim.\n\nThe Hong Kong club started poorly in the group stages losing the first three games and recovering to win the last three and the runner up spot for group G. In the last three games, the club has only allowed one goal (via deflection) while scoring seven. South China finished third in the recently concluded Hong Kong Premier League where eventual champions eastern and Kitchee were on a two-horse race for the title.\n\nPlayers to Watch\n\nForeign Players\n\nThe Asian Football Confederation (AFC) employs a 3+1 foreign player rule where 3 Non-Asians and 1 Asian player can be included in the line-up of different clubs. This allows the development of local talent within the country and the continent.\n\n#22 Bojan Malisic (Defender)\n\nThe Serbian centerback has been with the club since 2014 and is currently the captain of South China. He stands 1.86 cm (6’1″ ft) and is agile enough to cover fast attackers.\n\n#8 Mahama Awal (Midfielder)\n\nThis Cameroonian winger has the pace, passing, and shooting skills, playing mostly from the right flank but can switch when needed. He has scored two goals in the competition and has also an assist. The topscorer for his club in the HK Premier League with 11 goals, he should be marked very well by opposing defenders.\n\n#3 Ryan Griffiths (Forward)\n\nThe Australian striker is the top scorer of the club in the AFC Cup after getting three goals, two from penalties. The 34-year old has played for the Socceroos and is known for his positioning and knack on goals. He is a well traveled journeyman who has played in Europe, Asia, and Australia.\n\n#10 Luiz Carlos\n\nThe Brazilian midfielder stands 1.85m (6’1″ft) has not scored in the AFC Cup but is known for imposing his presence in the middle for South China.\n\nLocal Players\n\n#7 Chan Siu Ki (Forward)\n\nChan is the Hong Kong National Team’s all-time top scorer in international football. The 30-year old’s versatility to play up front and on the wings makes him a dangerous player aside from the finishing that he can produce.\n\n#21 Law Hiu Chung (Midfielder)\n\nLaw is a very hardworking midfielder for South China. His hard work has given him two goals in very scrappy occasions. The HK player should not be overlooked by the defense.\n\n#36 Wisdom Fofo Agbo (Defender)\n\nThe Ghanian born player has been a veteran for the Hong Kong league since 2004. He plays defensive midfield for South China .\n\nRead: [AFC Cup 2016] South China AA: Scouting Report Part 1\n\nPossible First XI\n\nStrategy\n\nSouth China has been very dangerous in set pieces and in the counter. A good portion of the goals came from corners where the offense is quick to react on goal scoring opportunities. Mahama Awal has lorded over the right flanks with his pace creating opportunities for himself and for his teammates during counterattacks. South China is a scrappy team which takes advantages of second balls and undisciplined defenses. Their defense has only conceded once in the last three games after allowing nine goals in the first three. They were disorganized defensively in their first three games especially on set pieces and counters."
