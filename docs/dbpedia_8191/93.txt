Gardner's literary career took off in the late 1960s with the publication of his first novel, "The Resurrection," which received critical acclaim. However, it was his third novel, "Grendel," published in 1971, which brought him widespread recognition and success.

His book "On Moral Fiction," published in 1978, challenged the prevalent notion that literature and morality should be separated, arguing for the importance of ethical considerations in works of art. Gardner also delved into the craft of writing with works like "The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers," which continues to be a highly influential guide for aspiring authors. In addition to his writing, Gardner was a dedicated teacher, holding various positions at universities such as Oberlin College, Bennington College, and Chico State University. He was known for his passionate and rigorous approach to teaching, and many of his former students have gone on to become acclaimed writers themselves. John Gardner's writing style was characterized by its complexity, intellectual depth, and examination of moral and philosophical themes. His works explored the human condition, often confronting the dark aspects of humanity with an unflinching honesty. Gardner's narratives were known for their intricate plots, vivid imagery, and well-crafted characters that resonated with readers. Despite his achievements, Gardner's life was tragically cut short at the age of 49. However, his literary legacy continues to inspire and influence writers to this day.
