        "text": "John Gardner, who has died aged 80, was the consummate thriller writer, producing more than 50 novels. But he owed his reputation to James Bond. His early success came with send-ups of the Bond genre, and he was to find greater fame, if not satisfaction, in reinventing Agent 007 almost 20 years after the death of the secret agent's creator, Ian Fleming.\n\nBorn in Seaton Delaval, then in Northumberland, Gardner was the only child of an Anglican priest - the family moved south when his father became chaplain at St Mary's, Wantage, Berkshire, where Gardner attended King Alfred's school. During the second world war, he joined the Home Guard aged only 14. He then served in the Fleet Air Arm in 1944 and the Royal Marine commandos in the Middle and Far East. After the war, he read theology at St John's College, Cambridge, and entered the Anglican priesthood, but after five years and a crisis of faith, he turned to journalism as drama critic of the Stratford-upon-Avon Herald, and to drink.\n\nBy the age of 33, he realised that his intake of gin qualified him as an alcoholic. As part of his therapy, he wrote Spin the Bottle (1963), a memoir about his relationship with alcohol. He claimed never to have touched booze since 1959, and the memoir - his only non-fiction book - launched him on a writing career.\n\nGardner's first novel, The Liquidator, a spoof of the Bond books, was published in 1964, the year of Fleming's death. The anti-hero, Boysie Oakes, had one drawback as a licensed-to-kill man of action: he was a coward who hated violence and sub-contracted parts of his missions to an assassin.\n\nThe book was filmed by Jack Cardiff, with Rod Taylor in the Oakes role and Eric Sykes as the hit man. Gardner was unimpressed with the result, but he was far less complimentary about Michael Winner's 1973 film The Stone Killer, starring Charles Bronson, adapted from his novel, A Complete State of Death (not one of the Oakes series), which he wrote in 1969 under the pen name Derek Torry.\n\nSeven more Oakes books followed, including Amber Nine (1966), in which the villain turned out to be Hitler's long-lost daughter. By 1974, though, Gardner was ready for a change and launched a new series based on the diaries of Professor James Moriarty, the nemesis of Sherlock Holmes. He intended a trilogy, but after the appearance of The Return of Moriarty (1974) and The Revenge of Moriarty (1975), he could not agree a publishing deal for a third book, and, in any case, Bond was about to intervene once more.\n\nWhile living in tax exile in Ireland, Gardner was approached by crime novelist and president of the Detection Club Harry Keating, on behalf of the Fleming estate. The proposition was to reinvent the Bond books for the late 1970s. Gardner, by now the author of 17 novels and two collections of short stories, was at first reluctant to commit. But in the end he convinced himself he could \"round out\" the character.\n\nLicence Renewed (1976) was the first in a franchise which lasted 20 years. There was a media frenzy at the return to the page of a more politically correct Bond - and an outcry that 007 was now driving a Saab 900 Turbo.\n\nAlthough they brought him wealth and a worldwide audience, Gardner never seemed comfortable with the Bond franchise, though he remained proud of one title, The Man From Barbarossa. Within three years, he had launched a series of five much grittier, hardboiled espionage thrillers, starting with The Nostradamus Traitor (1979) starring \"Big\" Herbie Kruger, a character shaped by the second world war - as Gardner had been.\n\nGardner wrote more Bond books than Fleming - a total of 16, two based on the films Licensed to Kill (1989) and GoldenEye (1995) - but in the same period, he also produced the Kruger books, another trilogy of spy stories and six stand-alone thrillers.\n\nGardner moved to America in 1989, but ill-health forced him to relinquish the Bond franchise to Raymond Benson in 1996. Medical bills for treating cancer of the oesophagus forced his return to England in reduced circumstances, only to suffer further when his wife of more than 40 years, Margaret, died suddenly the following year.\n\nNow living quietly in an almshouse in Basingstoke, he turned to his own memories of wartime Britain for his final series of thrillers, featuring Detective Sergeant Suzie Mountford. The first, Bottled Spider, was published in 2002. The leading character was based on Gardner's youthful romance with a nurse named Patricia Mountford, who, some 50 years after their last meeting, contacted him after reading about her namesake. The couple enjoyed a romantic reunion.\n\nIn the field of espionage fiction, Gardner lacked the intellectual complexities of John le Carr√© or the stylistic innovations of Len Deighton or Anthony Price, but he was a prolific and reliable deliverer to a thrill-seeking audience. Harsher critics have suggested he fed off the creations of others. He always knew that Bond would overshadow everything, and longed to be remembered as more than the man who brought back 007. In that, despite 52 novels, he probably failed.\n\nThe fifth Suzie Mountford book, No Human Enemy, has just been published. The third Moriarty book, The Redemption of Moriarty, completed shortly before Gardner's death, will be published posthumously. He is survived by the son and daughter of his marriage, Simon and Alexis; Miranda, the daughter of his relationship with Susan Wright; and Patricia Mountford, to whom he was engaged."
