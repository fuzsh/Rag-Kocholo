        "text": "John Gardner wears a black leather jacket and dirty blue jeans when be rides his Honda 750 onto the campus at the State University of New York, in Binghamton, where he teaches creative writing. He is a small, potbellied man and his white hair falls over his shoulders.\n\nCover: Photograph of John Gardner by Jean‐Pierre Laffont — Sygma; insets, top and bottom: Thomas Victor; inset, center: Helen Marcus.\n\nSo he looks sometning like a pregnant woman trying to pass for a Hell's Angel. As he walks across the campus — he bounces more than walks, often singing aloud to himself — he frequently pauses, draws a small pad out of his back pocket, and begins scribbling: perhaps a new novel, or a screenplay, or a book review, or a poem, or a libretto for one of the three operas he's writing. Gardner, who is 45, wrote fiction for more than 15 years without publishing anything: No one would have him.\n\nThen suddenly, during this decade, he began bringing out what seemed like a book every six months, sometimes every month. The 21 published so far include six novels, a collection of short stories, children's books, fairy tales, criticism, an epic poem and other worku harder to classify. (In “Gren del,” he rewrote “Beowulf” from the monster's point of view; in addition to everything else, Gardner is a respected medievalist and has written scholarly works, translations and two books on Chaucer.) “John Gardner,” wrote Robert Towers in his review of “October Light” — which the National Book Critics Circle proclaimed the best novel of 1978 — “is the dazzling virtuoso among recent novelists: a plausible impersonator, ventriloquist, puppet master and one‐man band.”\n\nGardner has also emerged as the leading warrior in the current battle over the proper substance and form of the contemporary American novel. He has raged against what he sees as the detached, unfeeling direction of mod ern literature, believing that it under mines many talented writers and even their readers. In a recent book, “On Moral Fiction,” Gardner wrote that “almost all modern art is tinny, commercial and immoral,” and concluded with a challenge: “Let a state of total war be declared not between art and society … but between the age‐old enemies, real and fake.” He got the literary fight be wanted — many\n\n©Jill Krementz prominent novelists have struck back — and now he is on the attack again. In his new book, “The Art of Fiction,” soon to be published by Knopf, Gardner refines and sharpens his criticisms. He reveals a near‐Messianic complex about the purpose of art, and of fiction in particular, and his views and novels have clearly touched raw nerves in both the writers he rails against and the readers he is trying to convert. Gardner's views reflect a profound and unresolved debate that has engaged literary minds since James Joyce.\n\nGardner believes there are no major American writers working now. In his opinion, John Barth, William Gass, Vladimir Nabokov (now dead, of course), Donald Barthelme and Stanley Elkin are more interested in “newfangledness” or in playing games with words or with literature itself than in concentrating on the moral and emotional problems of their characters; Norman Mailer, Joseph Heller, John Updike and Robert Coover, among others, don't even seem to care about their characters — a fatal flaw in any writer, according to Gardner — while other novelists are self‐indulgent philosophizers (Saul Bellow) or full of “winking mugging despair” (Thomas Pynchon).\n\nGardner exhales opinions on his fellow writers. In two minutes he can say:\n\n“John Updike doesn't revise enough. He feels he's got to publish a book a year. Again and again he brings out books that don't say what he means them to say. And you can't tell his women apart.”\n\n“Malamud is a great artist, an enormously serious writer, but he keeps blowing it in his novels.”\n\n“The New Yorker makes me furious. The magazine has gone cheap and New York fashionable, like New York painting. The New Yorker likes that cold, ironic stuff, like Barthelme, superrealism. I think it's just wrapping for their Steuben glass. If you put a real piece of fiction in The New Yorker, you've got to put it awfully far away from the fur coats and the Steuben glass, or the coats will fly apart and the glass will shatter. Their nonfiction is wonderful.”\n\n“Mailer's just lost. He's got the rage and he's got the idealism, but he can't find anything to focus on except an individual like Muhammad Ali or Marilyn Monroe or his mother.”\n\n“Joe Heller writes situation comedies. He's smart, so he verges on the serious from time to time, but he doesn't have anything serious to say about good and evil.”\n\n“The present scarcity of first‐rate fiction,” Gardner maintains, “does not follow from a sickness of society but the other way around…. Real art creates myths a society can live instead of die by, and clearly our society is in need of such myths…. Moral fiction holds up models of decent behavior: Characters whose basic goodness and struggle against confusion, error and evil — in themselves and others — give firm intellectual and emotional support to our own struggles.”\n\nNovelist John Barth is one of the most outspoken in his reaction to Gardner's criticisms. “To say that Gass and Barthelme are writing fiction full of\n\nJean‐Pierre Loffont — Sygma\n\nGardner at work. “Fiction,” he says, “is the only religion I have…. If I don't get my point of view across to younger writers, I will burn in hell for a thousand years.” literary games is stupid,” he said in a recent interview. “Fiction has always done that. ‘Don Quixote’ starts out as a satire of the novel of chivalry, but it is passionately about life. For that matter, Gardner condemns examples of my own writing for these reasons. But I'm very much concerned with real‐life contemporary problems and moral problems. There's something very selfserving about his argument. He's making a shrill pitch to the literary right wing that wants to repudiate all of modernism and jump back into the arms of their 19th‐century literary grandfathers. Gardner's own later novels do this and are applauded, of course. He's banging his betters over the head with terminology and, when the smoke clears, nobody is left in the room but Mr. Gardner himself.”\n\n“His argument in ‘On Moral Fiction’ isn't made well enough,” says critic Hugh Kenner. “There's a kind of junkexperimental fiction which is made out of the dictionary and which I would repudiate as heartily as Gardner, but he throws out far too much else.”\n\n“I picked up ‘On Moral Fiction’ in the bookstore and looked up myself in the index,” says John Updike, “but I didn't read it through. I try not to read things that depress me. Gardner doesn't find me moral or inspiring and that might have been depressing.” (He chuckles.) “‘Moral’ is such a moot word. Surely, morality in fiction is accuracy and truth. The world has changed, and in a sense we are all heirs to despair. Better to face this and tell the truth, however dismal, than to do whatever life‐enhancing thing he was proposing…. I thought he was awfully cavalier with Bellow.”\n\n“If I'm not Gardner's ideal novelist,” says Saul Bellow, “I'm full of regret. I can't suit every taste.”\n\nSpeaking of Gardner's occasional bits of praise for his contemporaries, Bernard Malamud says, “Whenever Gardner hands you a chocolate cake, it's loaded with worms. I find Gardner lacking in generosity and, sometimes, judgment.”\n\n“Gardner is a pretentious young man, talks a lot and has little of intelligence to say,” Joseph Heller says. “He writes dull novels and dull carping criticism.”\n\n“No comment,” says Norman Mailer, and he pauses and smiles. “We'll meet in heaven.”\n\nGardner isn't fazed. “Their criticism is silly,” he says. “I am absolutely sure that my ideas will prevail. The only law I'm sure of is the survival of the fittest.”\n\nGardner sees himself as something of a latter‐day Tolstoy- the only novelist he seems fully to approve of. Both Tolstoy and Gardner are “philosophical” novelists, influenced by Christianity (Tolstoy's last major novel was “Resurrection,” Gardner's first was “The Resurrection”); both men were deeply affected by the death of a brother; and both felt that most contemporary art lacked moral seriousness. “I agree with Tolstoy,” Gardner writes, “that the highest purpose of art is to make people good by choice.” Yet the man who emerged from the pages of “On Moral Fiction” resembled Tolstoy less than Gardner's re‐creation of Grendel, the primeval beast in “Beowulf.” Grendel hides in the forest gnashing his teeth at human stupidity, waiting to swoop down upon the village of Hrothgar, rip it apart, and kill the people there. Gardner himself (like Tolstoy) has an anticity bias (especially an anti‐New York City bias) and one can hear his teeth grinding away through much of his critical writing. He seems fearless and ferocious, and if one had to choose between spending an evening with the author or with the beast you might pause before deciding. It would never occur to you that John Gardner can be gracious and speaks in a quiet tone of voice, that his voice catches whenever he mentions his mother and father, that he is a man who claims to be “absolutely happy.”\n\nHe was born in Batavia, N. Y., in July 1933. His mother,(Continued on Page 34)"
