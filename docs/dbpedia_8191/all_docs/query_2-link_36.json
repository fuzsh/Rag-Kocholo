        "text": "Dr. John Gardnerâ€™s research fields are labor economics and applied microeconomics, with emphases on the economics of migration, the economics of race and gender, and the econometrics of causal inference. His recent work on labor economics examines the effects of foreign immigration on economic outcomes for native women and the consequences of the African American Great Migration for the migrants as well as the cities to which they moved. In my recent work on econometrics, I have developed techniques for identifying the effects of treatments in situations where receipt of the treatment is partially determined by unobserved factors."
