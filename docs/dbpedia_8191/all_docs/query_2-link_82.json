He is particularly well known for taking over the Jame Bond series after the death of its creator, Ian Fleming. He made numerous contributions to the series and is considered as the prolific author among all those who have worked on this series. Prior to the beginning of his writing career, author Gardner worked for the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines. Gardner retired from writing the series of James Bond novels in 1996 when Raymond Benson replaced him as the successor. Author Gardner was born on November 20, 1926, in Seaton, Delaval, Northumberland; and died on August 3, 2007, in Basingstoke, Hampshire. He was born as John Edmund Gardner. Other than the James Bond books, Gardner was also famous for writing his original series called Boysie Oakes. Gardner has also written three novels that feature Sir Conan Doyle’s popular fictional character named Professor Moriarty. Following his career in Royal Marines, he worked for some time as Anglican priest. Later, he left it after losing faith. Gardner suffered from alcohol addiction, but recovered soon and then wrote his autobiography in 1964. It is called as Spin the Bottle. Over the course of his writing career, author Gardner wrote more than 50 fiction novels, 14 of which were original Bond books and 2 were the novel versions of a couple of movies featuring the character. Gardner’s parents were involved in church works all their life. This is the reason why he too was influenced to get involved in the Anglican church. In 1933, his family shifted from the village to a market town called Wantage. At the time of the World War II, Gardner became a part of Home Guard, even though he was just 13 years old. Subsequently, he joined Air Arm of the Royal Navy and was transferred as a commando in the Far East. Gardner did not think of himself as a good commando.\n\nAfter coming from war, author Gardner enrolled himself at the St. John College, Cambridge. He studied theology and became a priest subsequently. In one of his interviews, he has mentioned that he did not believe even a single word that he was saying during a sermon. Realizing that he has made a huge error in choosing career, Gardner decided to leave the church in the year 1958. The novelist career of Gardner started in 1964 with the novel book, The Liquidator. This book was the first one to feature his original character Boysie Oakes. Gardner described Oakes as a coward and having a phobia of heights, who is mistaken as a pitiless, tough man and gets recruited as a spy in a British agency. With the success of Boysie Oakes books, author Gardner experimented with the creation of other characters like Derek Tory and Herbie Kruger. Later in his career, Gardner took a break of 5 years and then returned again in 2000 to continue writing novels. A few of his novels were short listed by the CWA for Gold Dagger award. Author Gardner was married to Margaret Mercer, with whom he had 2 children named Alexis and Simon. He had one more daughter named Miranda out of an extra-marital affair with a woman named Susan Wright. In 1989, author Gardner moved to United States, along with his family. During the later stages of his life, he suffered from cancer on two occasions, first with prostate cancer and then 6 years later with oesophagus cancer. Gardner became nearly bankrupt because of the treatment in US. Then Gardner decided to return to UK in 1996 and started writing again. After the death of his wife, he created a character based on a former girlfriend Patricia Mountford. Patricia contacted him after reading the book and two got engaged once again. Author Gardner’s death occurred due to a heart failure while shopping. He was rushed to the hospital, but was declared dead later.\n\nThe Boysie Oakes series written by John Gardner consists of a total of 8 books, which were released between the years 1964 and 1975. All the books of this novel series depict the chief protagonist as Boysie Oakes. One of the initial books written in the series is entitled ‘Understrike’. It was released by the Endeavor Press in the year 2014. At the start of this book, Boysie Oakes is introduced as a suave and womanizing agent working for the British Intelligence. As a part of his new mission, he is asked to travel to America during the testing times of the Cold War. As an official observer from England, Boysie Oakes is asked to witness the test fire of the latest nuclear missile of America, The Trepholite, in Sand Diego. However, the Soviets play a deadly game to prevent the Americans from testing the missile successfully. They send a body double of Oakes to the test field. Soon after, Boysie Oakes finds himself embroiled in a bluffing and double crossing game that involved a con man named Vladimir Solev and a holocaust missile. In Vladimir Solev, Boysie sees a part of himself and respects him as an opponent. On his way, Oakes gets busy with a couple of gorgeous ladies, Chicory Triplehouse and Priscilla Braddock. His adventure in the US makes him run for his life, dodge bullets, and save himself from jealous women and deadly predators. He is required to act fast as time is running out and the mission Understrike is already set in motion.\n\nAnother mind blowing book published in this series is titled as ‘Amber Nine’. The Viking Books released it in 1966. The story of this book opens by showing Boysie Oakes visiting Lake Maggiore for a mission. He is tasked to kill a Parliament Member. But, the mission takes an awry turn when the target turns up dead even before Boysie set his plan in motion. He wonders who killed the MP and what was the reason for killing him? The mystery begins to unravel when Boysie visits a finishing school run by a dangerous and mysterious man named Doctor Thirel. Shortly after, Boysie finds himself trapped in a big espionage. He is surrounded by girls and dangerous enemies. A lady named Petronella Witching helps him get to the roots of the mystery. Eventually, Boysie Oakes goes on to find out everything about the top secret mission called Amber Nine and the man who runs it. Surrounded by tough opponents on all sides, Boysie takes the help of some friendly secret agents in the enemies’ den and solve the mysteries successfully. He also prevents himself from getting killed in the process."
