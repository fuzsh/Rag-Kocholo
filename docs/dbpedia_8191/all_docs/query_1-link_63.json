        "text": "Kate Flora: It will happen sometimes. I’ll be reading a book and suddenly a single sentence or two will leap out at me and stop me in my tracks. Sometimes it’s an insight into character that gives me ideas for my work in progress. Sometimes a description. Sometimes it will be something that is true for me as a writer in a way that I never thought about before. A few days ago, in a book called The Book of Dreams by Nina George, an editor is thinking about her local cafe, where she sometimes meets with aspiring authors, and she thinks this:\n\nThose writers would describe their imaginary worlds to me, each hoping I would publish their manuscript and turn them into an author so that they might devote their lives to storytelling\n\nWe don’t talk about it enough, I think, that we are storytellers. Sometimes the magic of storytelling, of using our imaginations to create entire worlds we can invite readers into, gets lost in the mix of marketing, the ‘buy my book’ dance, anxiety over whether an editor will buy our book, buy our next book, whether we will have a good idea for the next book, and all the myriad things that surround the actual process of creation.\n\nI’m still struck by an experience I had years ago, which I described in an earlier blog this way:\n\nA few years ago, at one of those A-list parties where I was surrounded by some of those “famous” authors whose books are on all our shelves, I was working on an assignment to write a column for a magazine. The topic was “IMAGINATION,” so I asked several of the authors what came to mind when I said “imagination.” You’d think I’d said a dirty word. Some were silent. Some pondered as though I’d asked a trick question. A few offered uncertain answers, suggesting the realm of fancy and fantasy, or something dark or New Age. Not one responded as I’d expected, shrugging their shoulders and stating the obvious. “Imagination? Heck, we’re writers. Imagination is our principal tool.”\n\nBut the issue here is giving yourself permission to be a storyteller. What it feels like to set aside all of the other chores a writer had and become immersed in story. Allowing your imagination to soar so that you’re in that rare zone where story flows and your characters are real and you feel the sunshine of your face if it’s daytime in the story or sense the darkness and danger of being in the woods at night when there are bad people there too.\n\nIt’s kind of a special mindset, learning to identify oneself as a writer. I had probably published three books before I stopped filling the occupation blank on forms with lawyer and started writing author or writer instead. Until then, I hadn’t felt entitled to do that. Most of us suffer from some form of imposter syndrome, where we feel as though we’ve mistakenly been published, seen as an author, even read as an author. That sense that one day soon, someone will come along and burst the bubble. We’ll be revealed as the frauds we are.\n\nWhich gives rise to the question: why can’t we just enjoy this magical ability we have to create worlds and blow life into characters, and describe imaginary places that feel so real our readers can imagine being there. Characters so real our readers know them. Dialogue that sounds like the way real people talk. Why do we let so much other “stuff” get in the way of the pure joy of creation. Of achieving what, for many of us, what a life long dream–to be a writer.\n\nSo this week, as long as I can hold the rest of the “stuff” at bay, I am going to enjoy being a storyteller. I am going to finish the Joe Burgess book I’ve been working on for months and let myself get deeply immersed on those tense, climactic scenes. I am going to smile when I at last type “The End” of latest endeavor as a storyteller, and hope that those I end up telling the story to will feel some of the enchantment.\n\n(author’s note: the photos aren’t on topic except me doing my “buy my book” dance. Otherwise, they’re some of the magic of my world outside the writing process)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nKaitlyn Dunnett/Kathy Lynn Emerson here, today writing as Kathy. Face Down Under the Wych Elm released a week ago, meaning the first five books in the Face Down series are now available in newly edited, print-on-demand, trade paperback editions. The other five are edited, proofread, and scheduled to come out one each month from September through January. For those of you who read my last blog, I freely admit there may be typos I missed, most of them probably inserted when I was making a change to the earlier text or correcting an older typo. The nice thing about Indy publishing is that corrections really can be made as needed, so feel free to let me know if you spot anything in any of the versions I’ve revised and reissued during the last couple of years.\n\nSo what’s next? I’m glad you asked. The original plan was to go back to turning my paranormal historical romance, Firebrand, originally written in a rush in just three months and published in the 1990s, into a more cohesive novel retitled Treacherous Visions. I’ll still do that, and publish it in both e-book and trade paperback, but it occurred me me after editing Face Down #10 (Face Down O’er the Border) that I really should do a print-on-demand trade paperback edition of the Face Down short stories. They’ve been collected before, in the three-volume e-book omnibus editions of the Face Down novels (now updated to agree with the text in the new paperbacks) but there is no single e-book or book version that contains all seventeen of them. Several of them weren’t even imagined, let alone written when Murders and other Confusions, my first short story collection, was published by Crippen & Landru.\n\nSo, on tap after a breather is editing and proofing what will be titled Lady Appleton’s World: The Complete Short Stories. I envision a February 2025 release date.\n\nWhat do I plan when all ten Face Down novels and the short stories are available? Promotion for the “collector’s set” was the initial goal. Perhaps a special offer if purchased directly from the author. I doubt I’ll be doing signings or panels, even if I have a new knee by then, but I’ll do more than usual online. Since I’m not dependent on book sales to keep a roof over my head, and there’s no publisher breathing down my neck about self-promotion, I’m free to do as much or as little as I like. Thank goodness!\n\nI may just keep on doing what I’ve discovered I really enjoy doing—revising and reissuing backlist titles. You see, the rights for two more of my sixteenth-century mysteries are due to revert to me within the next year, and another two will follow after that. And those, like the short story collection, can be reissued in both e-book and paperback formats because there won’t be any older versions out there to confuse the issue.\n\nAnd after that? I’m sure I’ll think of something. I may not be writing any new fiction, but I’m far from ready to retire completely.\n\nKathy Lynn Emerson/Kaitlyn Dunnett has had sixty-four books traditionally published and has self published others.

My emotions this week border on, dare I say it?\n\nDread.\n\nIt’s a mild dread. Nothing too serious, but pernicious. A weak but notable anxiety, like the hour before an exam for which you’ve studied but, gosh, you never know if you might have missed that one section of the reading the professor chooses to emphasize.\n\nAnd okay, fine, some nausea. But that could be all the coffee.\n\nWhen I search “sophomore slump” online, hundreds of articles and blog posts shuffle down my computer screen like a dusty window blind. I skim and gape. The contents read like a horror story.\n\nFailure to live up to standards. Frustration. Boredom. Lack of motivation. Loss of momentum. Existential dread.\n\nIs this me?\n\nI pat myself down like a triage nurse looking for signs of injury. I’m okay. I’m okay. I repeat the words like a mantra, and no gaping wounds appear. I’m okay.\n\nI’m not as okay as last year.\n\nLast year I was a freshman novelist. When my first Olivia Lively mystery, FINAL DRAFT, launched, I felt excited and hopeful. Not quite cotton candy fluff, but close. My attitude tended toward cheerful and energetic. I jumped into my life as a published novelist, grinning, throwing launch parties, gushing on social media, and exuding manifest positivity. Life was good. My dreams of publication had been realized. People will read my book, I thought. Maybe not a ton of people, but some! How marvelous!\n\nI didn’t consider myself totally naive. Although I was a debut novelist, I thought I knew the score. I’d spent years in the apprenticeship trenches learning all I could, not only about the writing craft but also the industry. I firmly told my husband, “Don’t expect me to become famous or make a ton of money. It just doesn’t happen.” He said he got it. “And I’ll have to hustle, you know, to make sales.” He said he heard me loud and clear.\n\nGoing into a contract with a small press, I knew I’d be taking on the bulk of marketing responsibility for the book. I knew sales would be counted in the hundreds, not thousands. I knew publication wouldn’t change my life or anything. I considered myself prepared.\n\nAs predicted, my first book launched and sales were what I and my publisher expected. While I’d hoped for even more, of course, the numbers themselves didn’t faze me. It was a start. I was pleased by reader response. People liked—some even loved—my first book. They shared it with their friends and bought it as birthday presents for family members. Ratings on Amazon and Goodreads were above average. Reviews were positive.\n\nI saw the first book as a platform on which to build.\n\nOnce FINAL DRAFT launched, I had this idea to write prequel novella to use as a lead magnet. Before long, I realized it was actually book two in the series and expanded my original plot. On advice from an experienced and excellent Maine Crime Writer, I made it a murder mystery.\n\nI set the story once again in Portland, but I also sent my main character, female private investigator Olivia Lively, to a cozy cabin in the north woods. Think loons and kayaks and crows in the pine trees. The smell of lakewater and smoke from mesquite grills. A dead body. I then spirited Liv back to Portland for art galleries, restaurants, and runs along the Eastern Prom and Back Cove. I threw in a secret erotic novel, a seedy stripclub, possible Russian mafia dudes, boyfriend troubles, and a goofy Labradoodle to lighten things up.\n\nWriting this book was fun.\n\nNow NIGHT MOVES: An Olivia Lively Mystery is ready to launch into the world, and I’m feeling oddly panicked. Last year’s cheerful optimism has faded into a miasma of doubt. Uncertainty spirals like fog from a Maine lake on a chilly morning.\n\nI love my book. I did the best I could. What if it’s not enough?\n\nIt’s the second-book shudder. I know more now than I did last year. The realities of the publishing industry–specifically marketing–bum me out. I wonder, can I do better this time? What if I do worse? Is there really anything I can do about it? Because standing out in a super-crowded market kind of seems impossible even if you spend a big chunk of time and energy and money promoting yourself and your work.\n\nMarketing is a beast devouring my writing time and joy. I picture it with sharp spines, slavering mouth, and a bloated, ravenous belly dragging on the ground.\n\nI grapple with the marketing monster on a daily basis. I wave my sword. I identify and resolve tech issues. I post several times a day on social media in hopes of reaching new readers. I then read that social media doesn’t work anymore to reach new readers. I see a billion ads that tell me all I need to do is take “this awesome Masterclass” to learn how to use social media to reach readers. I pivot from one email marketing software (EMS) to another. I spend hours in webinars. I read books and articles and blog posts on marketing. I join groups to learn more about growing a reader base. I buy a domain email that, sigh, doesn’t “authenticate” with the new EMS. I end up on yet another platform using my old free gmail.\n\nAll this to sell a few hundred books? When I think about it, my heart stutters.\n\n“But, Shelley,” you say. “This is just business. It’s part of the writer life. Grow up.”\n\nIt is. I know it. I know I’m being a sophomoric crybaby.\n\nSomething about this imminent second book launch has panic gathering inside me like a thunderstorm, all dark purple clouds and flashes of distant lightning. As launch approaches, I start to wonder, what’s all this hustling for? What’s so great about being a published author? Could I simply write for myself and leave marketing behind forever? Would I be happier?\n\nI love writing. Conjuring a story onto paper that was once just a glimmer in my head gives me all the feels. I get huge joy from sharing those stories with others, and that’s what hooks me. In order to share, I need to market. In order to market, I need to chill out.\n\nAfter a few days of this existential dread, I go in search of help.\n\nI send a “save me!” text to my cohort in Las Vegas, and she listens and offers some perspective, asking, “What’s the worst thing that could happen?”\n\nI realize that the worst thing would be nobody buys my book and I’ll have spent a year of my life on a failed project. I will have embarrassed myself–and probably my relatives, too. They’ll pretend not to know me if they run into me at Devaney, Doak, and Garrett where I’ll be staring mournfully at the Maine author shelves while my lucky writer’s shirt falls to shreds around me like Miss Havisham’s dress.\n\nI’m kidding. I don’t have a lucky writer shirt.\n\nHowever bleak this scenario, my life wouldn’t end. I’d still have a home and food and coffee and books to read. I’d still have a lovely husband and friends. I’d still be living in two beautiful places, Maine and San Diego, and experiencing all there is to love about these locales.\n\nI realize I could shut down my social media and website tomorrow, abandon the internet completely, throw away my email list, and still manage to live a good, meaningful life full of reading, writing for fun, knitting, and making lots of soup.\n\nBut I’m not ready to give up. Harnessing the power of Google search, I seek out some Stoic principles that actually help with the imposter syndrome I’m experiencing. I’m reminded that I can only control my thoughts and decisions and actions, not external events.\n\nI learn that hope and despair are dual and connected. Failure and success are dual and connected. Everything is itself and its opposite. Trippy.\n\nI learn the key to life is progress, not perfection. If I work hard, write as well as I’m able, learn from my mistakes, and take reasonable steps to market my books, the rest is out of my control.\n\nThe panic subsides, and I feel better. It’s just a sophomore shudder, I realize. Nothing terminal. I’ll live to write another day. But maybe I should get a lucky shirt just in case?\n\n____________________\n\nNight Moves: An Olivia Lively Mystery\n\nEncircle Publications, August 14, 2024\n\nAfter a splashy success with her last big case, Olivia Lively, P.I. is struggling to manage Lively Investigations’s sudden—and exciting—growth spurt. When an old friend offers her a chunk of cash to investigate his wife and brother who may be having an affair, Liv reluctantly agrees. She heads to a cozy cabin in the Maine woods to investigate, thinking it will be a chance to enjoy summer while also solving her cash flow problem. When the suburban wife turns up dead, Liv discovers a possible connection to a seedy strip club and the Russian mob. It’s a sticky summer in Portland, Maine, and in the heat of it all, Liv discovers that often the most complex relationship a woman has is the one with herself.\n\n____________________\n\nShelley Burbank is a mystery and women’s fiction author and journalist based in Maine and San Diego, California.

In that instance, I had a recurring dream that I had murdered a young woman while still drinking and after getting sober, kept waiting for the police to nab me. The story In Your Dreams was published in an early Level Best Books anthology. I made $25 and never had the dream again.\n\nIn 1970, after graduating from college, I was granted conscientious objector status by my draft board and was thus required to do two years of alternate civilian service. My choices were work at the Augusta State Hospital, or the Bangor State Hospital. Augusta was closer to Union where I grew up, so I chose to work at what soon became AMHI. Since I wasn’t allowed to live in my home town, I got a free room (bed, bureau, and high walls with no ceiling) on the third floor of the old chapel.\n\nI was hired as a basic psychiatric aide at a weekly salary of $86.50 and assigned to the 4-12 shift on the Harlow Building. My first night on duty, while awaiting being scheduled for basic aide training, my supervisor, handed me the keys to the medication cabinet and said, “I’m off to dinner, have fun.” Having zilch for experience and training, I was justly apprehensive. That feeling was reinforced when an hour later, I had to escort an older man who was in the manic phase of his bi-polar illness, to a seclusion room and lock the door once he was inside.\n\nThat should have been a heads-up, but I was a bit slow on the uptake and my two year commitment stretched for twenty-seven years. During that time period, I got married, got sober, earned two masters degrees (adult education and library science), and had experiences that rival things you’ve read in fantasy and horror stories.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have found a different job in state service early on after fulfilling my commitment, but that didn’t happen. Let it be said that state (probably local and federal) jobs come attached with varied levels of dysfunction. I believe your average dairy farmer could govern or legislate as well as most folks who get elected. The Peter Principle certainly runs riot in state government.\n\nHere are some of the experiences that I suspect contribute to the dream I can’t get rid of (specifics about that later). When I was promoted to assistant team leader on the 3-11 shift, my current girlfriend who also worked at AMHI and I took a van load of patients to a hockey game at Colby College. When we were getting ready to leave the arena, one of them bolted out the door. We searched, but couldn’t find him, so we went to the police station and reported what had happened.\n\nWhat followed was painful and stressful. He was found dead in a cornfield three days later and my girlfriend and I were treated as though we had completely neglected our responsibility since we were dating.\n\nYou’d think that would be enough trauma for a job, but wait, there’s more! One inescapable fact of working in mental health is that patients kill themselves (some staff, too, but that’s another matter). There’s no way you don’t make connections with certain patients. That’s simple human nature. One young woman who had made a serious suicide attempt stabilized, but we knew it was just a matter of time before she succeeded. She did so by cutting her throat with a butcher knife. Another man who I became friends with, was unable to work through guilt over how he’d treated his family. A year after being released, he walked into a river and drowned. Another young woman who I befriended went to a private psychiatric facility in another state. She mailed me a post card telling me that life looked much better and she now had a boyfriend. The day I received the card, she shot herself.\n\nOne woman who I didn’t know jumped off the big bridge before the suicide fence was erected. She did so in November, but her body wasn’t found until March. When we tried to put her on a morgue slab, we had to jump up and down while pushing on her knees to get her legs straight enough to slide the metal tray into the opening.\n\nMy next experience was right out of a Twilight Zone episode. We had reorganized AMHI into geographic units and I was the evening team leader for one that served Androscoggin, Oxford, and Franklin Counties. As part of our planning for community re-entry, we had an internal halfway house on the top floor of the building adjacent to where we treated patients. One evening, I went over to administer medications and found one of the male patients hanging from a light fixture.\n\nHelp arrived quickly, but it was too late, so the physician on duty ordered us to put the deceased in a body bag and take him to the morgue. No sooner had we done so than he realized we needed to involve the medical examiner. The good doctor had me retrieve the body, dress him and then re-hang his corpse. Once the medical examiner arrived and did his job, I had to re-do everything. Once I returned from the morgue, the physician threw up his hands and said, “I can’t deal with any more right now. You call his wife and tell her.” I did and it was probably the most painful and awkward phone conversation I’ve ever had.\n\nIf traumatic experiences had been confined to interactions with patients, it would have been bad enough, but places rife with pathology attract pathological people as employees. When I got sober in October of 1980, that changed the dynamics between me and those who supervised me. The two who were above me in the supervisory chain were pieces of work. My direct supervisor was the activities director. She had been divorced by an alcoholic husband and had a level of hatred for men in general that was scary. My being in recovery pushed plenty of buttons. It got so bad that every time I went on vacation, I knew when I returned that something unpleasant would happen, like work hour changes, losing staff, or extra duties without any logic.\n\nHer boss was more subtle, but had a problem with prescription medications that also left her feeling threatened by my recovery. In addition, some of the people running the department of mental health were sicker than the patients. When I volunteered to be an affirmative action trainer, I was informed by the airhead from central office that I could no longer tell jokes because it would tarnish my credibility as a trainer. You can guess where that went.\n\nPlenty more strange events happened in my twenty-seven years at AMHI, but I’ve given you an insight into why I might have disturbing dreams. Oddly enough, the one I have at least once a week is about my still working there even though I haven’t received a paycheck for five years. Nobody appearing in my dream seems to find that odd except me. Hopefully, this blog post will banish that semi-nightmare. Stay tuned to find out.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHave you ever arrived at the end of your novel and realized it just didn’t work? Or that you had no idea how to end it? Or who did the crime and why they did it? If the answer to these questions is yes then don’t feel like you’re alone. All of us writers feel this way at one point or another.\n\nWriting a compelling ending is hard work. It requires a lot of thought and contemplation. You have to be adaptable and willing to look at your story from different angles. How many times have we read a great novel, often one by a big name author, and been sorely disappointed by the ending? It’s almost as if they got tired of their story and just stopped. As writers, we definitely don’t want to leave our hard-earned readers on a sour note.\n\nIf writing endings were easy, everyone would be a writer. At times, I wish being a writer was like being a starting major league pitcher. You pitch the first eight innings of the game and then have a closer come in to finish the ninth for you. But alas, if you want to be an author, writing a satisfying ending is something we must learn to do.\n\nUsing another sports analogy; the best defense is often a good offense. And by this I mean that half the battle in composing a great ending is writing a great story. Making the reader care how your story ends means you’ve done a successful job holding their interest. Now you need to smoothly land this jet plane that is your plot and make sure your passengers get to their gates. You’ll need to provide an ending that will give closure and allow the reader to walk away satisfied.\n\nThe type of book you’re writing can often determine the type of ending you’re shooting for. A police procedural or cozy mystery requires that the ending be neatly wrapped up. Domestic thrillers, which I write, often have ambiguous endings, leaving the reader wondering what just happened. A great example of this is Gillian Flynn’s GONE GIRL. After all the horrendous things Nick’s wife has put him through during the course of the novel, Nick realizes at the end that he can’t just up and leave her. Amy’s gotten herself pregnant, and Nick is terrified that his child will be raised by this evil woman.\n\nMany readers were angry that Flynn ended her novel this way. Others loved this ambiguous ending. It left the reader contemplating about will happen next in their relationship. It’s the same reaction many viewers had when watching the last episode of The Sopranos. Tony and his family are sitting in the booth of a diner. Mysterious people walk in and out. There’s something tense and scary about this scene. We wonder what’s going to happen. Will Tony and his family get killed? Then the screen goes black and that’s the end of the show. Some people loved this ending while others despised it and felt they’d been cheated for all the time and effort they put in watching the series.\n\nThe show, Breaking Bad, on the other hand, has a well defined plot arc that resembles a rainbow; at the end is a pot of gold. The writers wrapped up the show and left no question about Walt’s fate. Each show ended differently, for entirely different reasons, and each ended in interesting fashion. The ending fit the story line.\n\nNot to get metaphysical, but what actually is an ending? If you ask yourself this question, I believe it will make writing your endings that much easier. Or at least less harder. Because, when one thinks about it, an ending is merely the beginning of something else. Consider what will happen to your surviving characters after your book ends. If it’s a series, the conclusion will impact how your characters act and think in the next book.\n\nThe most important aspect of your ending is this: how will the main characters change or be changed by the events that happened in your plot. Sometimes a violent, action-packed ending is not what’s needed. Sometimes, it’s how your character has changed that leaves the reader emotionally impacted. As in GONE GIRL, Nick is left reeling because he will have to live with his evil wife for the foreseeable future. This type of profound ending hits like a sledgehammer and keeps the reader thinking about your story long after it’s finished.\n\nLay the groundwork for your ending by writing a killer plot. A strong storyline will do much of the heavy lifting when it comes to crafting the conclusion. Spend time thinking about how to close out your novel even while you’re writing it. Sometimes it helps to write out a few different scenarios before you find the one that fits best. Often, it will take a few rewrites to get it just right. Then, if you’re like me, you’ll listen to your agent and editor, both of whom will give you additional input as to bring your storyline together.\n\nDon’t get discouraged. Endings are tough. Persevere and work your way through them. And with that, I wish you the best writing that killer ending.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nJule Selbo\n\nWant to know what it’s like to feel appreciated, respected and an immediate part of a community as a writer?\n\nJoin the three chicks on a ferry who were invited to visit Vinalhaven Island Library to lead a night of fun: Create A Mystery Night.\n\nKate Flora got the enquiry. Turns out Jen Wadleigh (head librarian and author), librarian Linda Whittington, Board Members and a super-active group called Friends of the Library asked if a special night could be put together for their summer programming. The library wanted to make sure that it was understood that ferry tickets, a cocktail party, publicity for the event and a water-view cottage with a refrigerator full of snacks, quiche, salad, wine and seltzers would be provided.\n\n—— Jennifer Wadleigh/librarian/author/ lobsterwoman and FOL —–\n\nAs the emails passed back and forth, Jen assured us (Kate, Maureen Milliken and me) the islanders were voracious readers, they loved to get together to talk about books and writing and that the timing of the event would not conflict with the island’s busy summer concert schedule, its poetry sessions, its ice cream socials and parades. Jen told us to bring lots of books, because islanders liked buying author-signed books.\n\nThe day arrived, Kate, Maureen and I meet at the ferry in Rockland at noon and for the next 24 hours – lived a pretty idyllic life. I’ve been a life-long lover of all things Maine but I’ve only been a full-term resident here for less than a decade and so Vinalhaven Island was still on my ‘go-there’ list.\n\nThe Penobscot Bay island (permanent population about 1200) is part of the Fox Islands (named after silver foxes who lived there) along with the smaller nearby island North Haven (permanent population about 350). Around 5000 years ago, it was the home of the Red Paint People and then the Abenaki made homes there. When Europeans found its shores in the 16th century, they saw its full forests and granite resources, sawmills and quarries were set up.\n\nThe granite even made its way to New York, it was used in the construction of St. John the Divine and the Brooklyn Bridge. More European settlers arrived, and farms were built and the island was thriving. During the Revolutionary War, the Brits looted it and terrorized the (mostly) Patriot community.\n\nAfter the war, near the end of the 1700s, the islanders petitioned The General Court of Massachusetts that the settlers of the island be given full possession of the lots they occupied. Massachusetts agreed if a place of public worship was built, a minister hired, and a school raised for the children. Deal done. At that point, it was named after John Vinal, a Boston lawyer who (he must have done) a super-duper job on doing all the paperwork.\n\nIt’s a laid-back place. There are a lot of sailboats, but I didn’t see any large marina. There are art galleries and a few cafes and taverns and a few nice clothing stores, but the sidewalks near the ferry (and one of the best donut shops I have ever visited) are not crowded.\n\nAnd the readers turned out! The library (built with support of Andrew Carnegie) was packed – every seat was taken in the main room, people were standing in hallways and every available cubby.\n\nThe night was a lot of laughs, included great creative ‘what-ifs’ (Darth Vader as one of our murder victims) fabulous audience participation, we included a raffle (we each contributed a book) and we sold nearly every book we’d brought over in our suitcases.\n\nAt the end of the event, we three chicks headed back to our own-for-the-night spacious cottage where more food and fine beverages were provided. We three stayed up talking about writing, love of stories and characters and all things that go along with being a crime/mystery writer. The moon shone on the water, a breeze was blowing through the curtains. This was another highlight of the trip.\n\nIn June, 2020, a black bear was spotted going ashore on Vinalhaven. Most people think he swam over from the mainland. I don’t know if he decided to stay or not. Well – we didn’t swim, we took a ferry – but I certainly could have stayed a long long time.\n\nAnd as a sidelight, famous artist Robert Indiana lived on Vinalhaven. These are some of his most famous pieces and one he had no hand in at all – can you guess which one he would not take credit for?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRob Kelley here, writing this month’s entry on the road. I switched dates this month to accommodate another Maine Crime Writers’ travels and find myself writing this post while traveling. I was out in beautiful Albuquerque visiting with two of my sisters and got some great writing time in: first on the plane on the way out, then in the early mornings, still on Eastern Daylight Time.\n\nMargot and I call these “hotel days”: found time in a quiet, unfamiliar place that spurs creativity and focus. When one of us travels for work, the other often tags along, making it a bit more fun and building in a hotel day!\n\nWriters get into the zone in different ways and I’ve tried to be conscious about what things have worked for me historically so that I can make those part of my ongoing practice.\n\nEarly in my career, before my responsibilities grew, I was often able to carve out time on Sundays to work for an hour or two, drafting several early attempts at novels. But as my career took off, I couldn’t find the down time to do that more engaged work, not in the mornings, evenings, or the weekends. My brain just couldn’t turn off my work creativity to make space for my writing creativity.\n\nThat said, I found small sparks, often while on the road. I traveled a significant number of weeks a year, and while flying would whip out a notebook to jot down a random idea, or while driving would sent myself a voicemail over speakerphone.\n\nThere’s a likely very anecdotal story about a Nobel Prize-winning author who had a huge hot water tank installed in his house so he could have extra shower time to think. True or not, I get it. I often find that a shower or a drive help me solve plot and character conundrums that thwart me completely when I’m just staring at the screen. “Shower thoughts” are a well-documented psychological state, a version of the state of flow that allows our “default mind network” to surface novel ideas and creativity. (It is also a delightfully quirky Reddit subreddit).\n\nI find that those alternative spaces, and places, where I can let my mind wander are valuable enough that I now try to incorporate it more purposefully in my writing. When I hit a snag in a draft or revision–with some intractable plot hole or lack of believable character motivation–I consciously frame the problem in my mind then let it go. Reliably, after an hour or so, a day or two, in the shower, on a walk, or in the car, some version of the answer appears.\n\nHow do you inspire yourself to be creative or get past a writing conundrum?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
