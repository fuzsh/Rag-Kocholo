        "text": "A prison mug shot released this week depicts the notorious murderer of Amber Dubois and Chelsea King as a heavier man with a scruffy beard.\n\nJohn Albert Gardner lll, 35, is incarcerated at the men-only California State Prison, Corocran in Kings County, where he lives in a protective housing unit, said California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman Terry Thornton.\n\nGardner and other high profile prisoners are housed in the segregated area due to the notoriety of their cases and because placing them in the general prisoner population would seriously jeopardize their safety, Thornton said.\n\nSome of his fellow inmates in the unit include the infamous Charles Manson, Jaycee Lee Dugard’s kidnapper Phillip Garrido, Mikail Markhasev, who murdered Bill Cosby’s son, and serial killer Juan Corona, who was convicted in 1971 in the murders of 25 migrant workers.\n\nGardner was convicted in 2010 in the rape and murder of 14-year old Amber Dubois, who was kidnapped in Feb. 2009 as she walked to Escondido High School and Chelsea King, 17, who was ambushed as she jogged on a trail in Lake Hodges a year later.\n\nHe was sentenced on May 14, 2010 to two consecutive life prison terms without parole in a deal that spared him the death penalty in exchange for his guilty pleas in both cases."
