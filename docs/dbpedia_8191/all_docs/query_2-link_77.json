His father composed sermons behind the plow and Gardener said that they were wonderful.  Gardner started writing poems at a young age, about a boy and a dog, to attract attention. Gardner had boxes of manuscripts and one, Mickelsson’s Ghosts took 20 years to work over and get published. He talks about studying a gesture, a moment to get it right, and that all fiction takes some reality in the nature of a person or mannerism. - August 07, 2024",

You're the best writer in town.\" You want to have the most vivid idea, the most unique. Persistence is key, whether you start your own small magazine, or try to get published in the Atlantic Monthly or some other publication. Don’t worry about getting a publisher until you have something worthy of publishing.\n\nSide Notes:\n\nJuly 21, 1933 - September 14, 1982\n\nGardner was a gifted poet and a critic who published several books on Old and Middle English poetry\n\nHis reputation was established with the appearance of Grendel September 17, 1971.
