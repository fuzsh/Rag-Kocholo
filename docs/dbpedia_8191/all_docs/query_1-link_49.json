        "text": "I'm glad you enjoyed the interview, @chrisno1. Yes, John Gardner definitely had a fun side. This can also be seen in his writing. I like how he laughs as he's saying something sometimes - it's an endearing quality. I remember hearing him being interviewed by Simon Mayo on BBC Radio 5 Live on 23 July 2002 to promote his first Suzie Mountford novel, Bottled Spider, and being able to tape the end of it. He did the same thing there too and was quite wry in his answers. I suppose Glidrose saw reviving the Bond continuation after a break of over a decade to be a big deal and so they required their prospective author to submit an outline and sample chapters. As he said in interviews, Gardner found this rather a chore as normally he tended to write novels from an idea or character or whatever and then developed the story as he went along. He said that he felt his Bond novels would've been much better if he'd been trusted like a seasoned spy novelist to just get on with it and write the novels in his usual way of working.\n\nAs regards being an army officer being enough to admit you to university, yes, you could do things like that back then. You certainly couldn't do it today. Being in the services was like a skeleton key that opened a lot of doors. I suppose the prevailing view was that if you went to fight and risk your life in a World War for your country the least that they could do afterwards was to offer you a step up the ladder to try to improve your life through advanced academic study. It's like how people used to become barristers without studying Law. The past is a foreign country, as they say. Gardner's degree at St John's College, Cambridge was an MA in Theology. He obviously had the intelligence to go to university to study, if not the academic pieces of paper to back it up. Here is a follow up US radio interview with Gardner (again by Don Swaim) from about a year later on 21 November 1985 where he briefly discusses Bond, his writing method, real espionage and his then new novel, The Secret Generations:\n\ndonswaim.com/JohnGardner1985.mp3\n\nYes, it is a good interview. Not so much for Bond, as you say, but more for learning about his writing habits and routine. Gardner clearly put a lot of effort into his writing and really stuck at it. It's not surprising as between 1963 and his death in 2007 he wrote a total of 55 books, the first being an autobiography called Spin the Bottle, followed by 52 novels and 2 short story collections. That's a lot of work over a space of 44 years! Gardner is certainly one of the more prolific Bond authors and he's in the Guinness Book of Records as having written the most Bond novels. That's more than even Bond's creator, Ian Fleming. Gardner said that he drove himself into the ground writing the Bond novels as well as his own spy novels at the same time and that he was literally dying by the time he wrote his last Bond novel, Cold (1996). Gardner also stated that he felt that he was underwriting the Bond novels as he paid for the research travel costs out of his own pocket. Hopefully some day soon Gardner's substantial contribution to keeping the literary Bond flame alive will be better appreciated.\n\nYes, I'd say you're right about established authors such as Gardner getting an advance to cover such expenses as travel and research. Perhaps Gardner felt that the deal should've been better than that from Glidrose, I'm not sure. Writing so many Bond continuation novels (one a year mostly, apart from 1985 when there was none and 1989 where there were two books) probably did take a toll on Gardner as a writer and on the quality of some of the later novels which he had to churn out to meet quite tight deadlines. It's interesting that in the radio interview posted above he says that he doesn't think he'll be asked to do more after Bond book number 6 (which became No Deals, Mr Bond) was completed when he wasn't even half way through the amount of Bond novels he'd actually go on to write. Perhaps Glidrose \"made him an offer he couldn't refuse\", Godfather-style?\n\nI used to write far more when I was still studying at university and writing long essays and problem question answers for my Masters in Law. Since then I find that I write much less now and it's all much slower in coming together. I am working on a new Bond blog article I hope I can get finished before the end of the year. I have it plotted out; it's just a matter of getting the notes and scribblings down on the page and assembled into a readable article. You are a prolific writer in my opinion and you certainly produce much more than I do these days, so take heart from that, @chrisno1. ðŸ™‚\n\nI think it is interesting the ponder what the legacy of Gardner would have been if he had quit after No Deals, Mr Bond. My impression is that most of the criticism and negativity towards his series is caused by the latter half of his tenure as Bond author, with his repetitive habits of double-crossing and twisting that makes many of those novels a bit tiresome.\n\nIf his set of novels just included Licence Renewed to No Deals, Mr Bond I think you would have a set of very solid James Bond novels, a couple of which are really quite good.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm greedy so I'm glad all those additional Gardner Bonds are on my shelf, and I think there were a few highlights in the second half of the Gardner series. Most of all, where would @Silhouette Man be without Never Send Flowers? ðŸ˜„\n\nYes, Gardner should have quit earlier than he did. But why including No Deals, Mr Bond which is a novel full of issues ? Calvin Dyson, whose reviews are excellent, also considers it as one of the author's worst and points out everything wrong with it.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1987, it's a roller coaster.\n\nRole of Honour, is, IMHO, the worst novel ever written between 1953 and 2023, and I mark my words. The villain's plot is ill-conceived, the characters are uninteresting, the climax is desperately weak, and most of all, the stakes are not only far-fetched but ridiculous. It's probably the only one I felt totally unable to read with any ersatz of enjoyment, not even a single chapter.\n\nI think half of the first six novels are very poor, and that's why Icebreaker was the perfect one for Gardner to end his journey. With a solid entry like Licence Renewed and a very satisfying third book, he could have easily been forgiven for the quite disappointing For Special Services.\n\nI think they probably should as John Gardner came up with as many good ideas as the likes of Purvis and Wade ever have. I think though that Eon/the scriptwriters only ever consider using a scene, dialogue or character etc. from a Bond continuation novel when they're in a creative bind and they can't find another way out. They really have to be between a rock and a hard place figuratively before they consider the \"In Emergency break glass\" option of using a continuation Bond novel as a source for their script. That was certainly what happened with their decision to adapt the Colonel Sun torture scene in Spectre, as was mentioned in an interesting article in MI6 Confidential magazine some years ago. Just look at Michael G. Wilson's disparaging comments at a Bond fan event in New York in 1995 on Gardner's Never Send Flowers. There he jokingly referred to what he saw as the inappropriateness of Gardner's decision to have Bond like Disneyland and to have the climax of the novel set at Euro Disney. From that attitude it's easy to see Eon think that the Gardner novels in particular are below them and not something they'd \"stoop\" to adapting. Of course that hasn't stopped them nicking ideas like an airship climactic fight, an aircraft hangar fight, a villainous lair called the Ice Palace etc. Those could all be conveniently chalked up to coincidence as \"general thriller ideas\" plucked from the ether should anyone from Glidrose/IFP have come knocking with their lawyers in tow. It seems to me that Eon very much calls the shots when it comes to James Bond, not IFP. They are merely a junior partner happy to take their 10% in profits from each film.\n\nThere's also the crucial economic consideration of a full adaptation or a partial adaptation meaning a fee would have to be paid to the Gardner Estate or the continuation author themselves if they are still alive. There would also have to be an on-screen credit. That was what happened with the Amis Estate so they could use his torture scene in Spectre. I think any future use of the continuation novels would continue to centre around Colonel Sun as it has an elevated status as the cream of the crop due to Amis's writing ability and it being set close to Fleming's timeline. They have lifted most of the best parts already though - Greece as a location, M being kidnapped, Colonel Tan-Sun Moon as a villain name and especially the infamous head torture scene. There's not a lot of highlights left after all that. However, Eon seem to mostly be content paying their own writers to come up with scripts and ideas and are loath to pay out any more money to adapt a continuation novel. I suppose, in their position, why would they? That's even more the case when you consider how many scenes or even full novels/short stories of Fleming's are still yet to be properly adapted in the Eon Bond films.\n\nI suppose that's fair enough. I think Purvis and Wade at their worst are pretty bad - Bond surfing a tsunami wave and Blofeld being Bond's stepbrother being the most dire examples.\n\nLee Tamahori is on record as saying that the surfing was his idea (see Some Kind of Hero) and Mendes is down as saying that the stepbrother thing came from an idea of Michael Wilson's. And I still think if you trace that concept through it's not a terrible one: they're adapting Fleming's Octopussy where Bond goes after the killer of his childhood mentor Oberhauser- that's Fleming himself doing a personal plot. As you want Bond and the villain to be around the same age in the film and to know each other, it makes kind of sense to change the killer to being closer to a child's age, hence he becomes a jealous son (apparently Jez Butterworth wrote a lot of the cuckoo stuff). And it makes little difference what his name is- why not Blofeld? It's no more ridiculous than any other name to Bond. It all makes logical sense within the story and it comes pretty directly from Fleming, the problem is they didn't take a step back and see that Bond and Blofeld being brothers just feels a bit silly to the audience.\n\nOne quite neat thing is that Purvis & Wade wanted the Austria stuff to bet in Kitzbuhel, because when Fleming stayed there as a youngster he lived with a couple who provided therapy for those in a constant negative contest with their siblings. I think that's nice thinking.\n\nI know Gardner did reuse his double and triple agent trope too much but sometimes he pleasingly subverted expectations too - such as in Never Send Flowers where the villain David Dragonpol instead kills and impersonates his twin brother Daniel in order to evade capture. No double or triple agents in that story.\n\nGosh I don't know, is identical twins impersonating each other less cliched and schlocky than a vengeful foster brother?"
