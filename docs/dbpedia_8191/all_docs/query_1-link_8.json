        "text": "VJ Books Presents Author John Edmund Gardner!\n\nJohn Edmund Gardner (20 November 1926 - 3 August 2007) was born in Seaton Delaval, a small village in Northumberland. During World War II he joined the Home Guard, despite being only 13 at the time. Gardner subsequently served in the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm, before transferring to the Royal Marines 42 Commando for service in the Middle and Far East.\n\nAfter the war he went up to St John's College, Cambridge, to study theology and was subsequently ordained as an Anglican priest in 1953. He realized that he had lost his faith and made an error in his career. Gardner published his autobiography, Spin the Bottle, in 1964.\n\nIn 1964, Gardner began his novelist career with The Liquidator, in which he created the character Boysie Oakes who inadvertently is mistaken to be a tough, pitiless man of action and is thereupon recruited into a British spy agency.\n\nFollowing the success of his Oakes books, Gardner created new characters: Derek Torry, a Scotland Yard inspector of Italian descent, and Herbie Kruger, the latter of which appeared in a series of novels published simultaneously with his Bond works. In the mid-1970s Gardner also wrote the first of three novels using the character of Professor Moriarty from the Sherlock Holmes series, the last of which was published posthumously.\n\nIn 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) approached Gardner and asked him to revive Ian Fleming's James Bond series of novels. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels, and the novelizations of two Bond films.\n\nHis break from writing lasted for five years, following the death of his wife, but after battling his illness he returned to print in 2000 with a new novel, Day of Absolution. Gardner also began a series of books with a new character, Suzie Mountford, a 1930s police detective.\n\nJohn Gardner Book List\n\nSimilar authors: Vince Flynn, Anthony Horowitz, Robert Ludlum, Eric Van Lustbader, Kyle Mills\n\nSeaFire\n\nFirst Edition\n\nDeath is Forever\n\nFirst Edition\n\nNobody Lives Forever\n\nFirst Edition\n\nJohn Gardner Bibliography\n\nAutobiography\n\nSpin the Bottle - 1964\n\nBoysie Oakes Series\n\nThe Liquidator - 1964\n\nUnderstrike - 1965\n\nAmber Nine - 1966\n\nMadrigal - 1967\n\nFounder Member - 1969\n\nTraitor's Exit - 1970\n\nThe Airline Pirates - 1970 - published in the U.S. as Air Apparent\n\nA Killer for a Song - 1975\n\nTwo Boysie Oakes short stories appear in The Assassination File (A Handful of Rice, Corkscrew).\n\nTwo Boysie Oakes short stories appear in Hideaway (Boysie Oakes and The Explosive Device, Sunset At Paleokastritsa).\n\nDerek Torry Series\n\nA Complete State of Death - 1969 - reissued in the U.S. as The Stone Killer\n\nThe Corner Men - 1974\n\nProfessor Moriarty Series\n\nThe Return of Moriarty - 1974\n\nThe Revenge of Moriarty - 1975\n\nMoriarty - 2008\n\nHerbie Kruger Series\n\nThe Nostradamus Traitor - 1979\n\nThe Garden of Weapons - 1980\n\nThe Quiet Dogs - 1982\n\nMaestro - 1993\n\nConfessor - 1995\n\nThe Railton Family Series\n\nThe Secret Generations - 1985\n\nThe Secret Houses - 1988\n\nThe Secret Families - 1989\n\nJames Bond Novels\n\nLicense Renewed - 1981\n\nFor Special Services - 1982\n\nIcebreaker - 1983\n\nRole of Honour - 1984\n\nNobody Lives for Ever - 1986\n\nNo Deals, Mr. Bond - 1987\n\nScorpius - 1988\n\nWin, Lose or Die - 1989\n\nLicence to Kill - 1989  novelization of a film script\n\nBrokenclaw - 1990\n\nThe Man from Barbarossa - 1991\n\nDeath is Forever - 1992\n\nNever Send Flowers - 1993\n\nSeaFire - 1994\n\nGoldenEye - 1995  novelization of a film script\n\nCold - 1996  published in the U.S. as Cold Fall\n\nDetective Sergeant Suzie Mountford Series\n\nBottled Spider - 2002\n\nThe Streets of Town - 2003\n\nAngels Dining at the Ritz - 2004\n\nTroubled Midnight - 2005\n\nNo Human Enemy - 2007\n\nOther Novels\n\nThe Censor - 1970\n\nEvery Night's a Bullfight - 1971 (Published in the U.S. in a bowdlerized edition as \"Every Night's a Festival\" in 1972.)\n\nTo Run a Little Faster - 1976\n\nThe Werewolf Trace - 1977\n\nThe Dancing Dodo - 1978\n\nGolgotha - 1980 - published in the U.S. as The Last Trump\n\nThe Director - 1982 (A re-working of his 1971 novel \"Every Night's a Bullfight\".)\n\nFlamingo - 1983\n\nBlood of the Fathers - 1992 (as by \"Edmund McCoy\".
