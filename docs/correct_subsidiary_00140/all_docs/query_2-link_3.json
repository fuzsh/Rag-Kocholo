        "text": "WebCenter Portal provides all the tools you need to quickly create a robust portal through an intuitive user interface and a selection of out-of-the-box portal templates to help you get started with built-in functionality appropriate for the portal you want to create. After creating a portal, you can easily develop it by adding pages, components, and more. You can customize the look and feel of a portal, define security and membership in the portal, and continually add new features and functionality as the needs and demands of your portal change.\n\nBusiness users can easily assemble new portals or composite applications using Portal Composer and a page editor that includes a library of prebuilt reusable components. They can enhance user experience by wiring components together on the page, configuring content personalization, enabling the use of integrated social tools, and creating data visualizations.\n\nWebCenter Portal provides users with a personalized, secure, and efficient way of consuming information and interacting with people and applications in the context of business processes. It optimizes the connections between people, information, and applications; provides business activity streams so users can navigate, discover, and access context; and offers dynamic personalization of applications, portals, and sites to provide a customized experience."
