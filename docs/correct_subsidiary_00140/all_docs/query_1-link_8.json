        "text": "Oracle Portal 11g offers compelling interoperability capabilities with Oracle WebCenter Services 11g in the context of enterprise business processes leveraging BPEL. Oracle WebCenter Services provides horizontal enterprise-ready Web 2.0 services, that enable a collaborative and composite environment, and enrich the end-user experience with context-aware enterprise portals, thus successfully expanding on the overall value proposition of Oracle Portal.\n\nA key takeaway benefit that resonates across all of the messaging is the ubiquitous adoption of open portlet standards-JSR 168 and WSRP 2.0-around the portlets that plug into Oracle Portal 11g. Additionally, Oracle is the specification lead on the JSR 301 initiative, which defines the standard for the Oracle JSF Portlet Bridge. This bridge is the underlying technology that enables portletization of WebCenter Services."
