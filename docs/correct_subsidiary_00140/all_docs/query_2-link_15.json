The big question is either going for Ms SQL back-end or Oracle, bearing in mind the most of the corporation apps are all on oracle.\n\nIf choosing either, what are the advantages and disadvantages?\n\nThank you all in advance.\n\nIt’s not a choice, SharePoint uses SQL Server. No options.\n\nBut even if it did, what would even make you consider Oracle for a database? Slow, expensive, buggy, bad support. I only know of one circumstance when companies choose Oracle DB - when the app that they are using doesn’t support anything else.\n\nBut in this case, you are saved by the fact that Oracle isn’t an option.\n\nOn what do you base this statement? Posting an unrelated link to make it look like you are referencing something isn’t cool. And why would you try to mislead the OP like that?"
