        "text": "The digital platform enables companies worldwide to manage their credit insurance policies and apply for credit limits in one spot, in real time.\n\nThe new portal provides Atradius’ customers a quick and easy way to complete credit insurance transactions worldwide in more than 45 countries and has been built with a flexible architecture so that new functionalities can be added easily.\n\nThe Atradius Atrium portal will provide brokers, agents and account management teams with a faster and more efficient way to complete claims applications for the insured customers of Atradius. They are able to search and view information about buyers’ creditworthiness, such as buyer ratings, current cover, and claims before applying for a credit limit. The customer can then directly apply for a credit limit with the information already included in the application so credit limit decisions can be made quickly.\n\nAtrium was developed using Oracle web publishing technology which connects to a back office application based on Oracle business application technology. Atradius has consistently and deliberately standardized its IT environment on Oracle in order to benefit from a one stack approach. By doing so, the company benefits from seamless integration and optimum use of Oracle licenses. The company also uses Oracle cloud-based solutions, including Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM) Cloud and Oracle Sales Cloud.\n\nDr. Jörg Müller, Atradius Group IT Director: “The Atrium customer portal is an important milestone for us as we move to modernize our business. It is a tremendous timesaver for our customers and reduces the risk of errors, making credit management fast, simple and transparent. Oracle and its technology are integral in helping us improve our customers’ experience in a landscape now dominated by digital engagements.”\n\nRené van Stiphout, Country Leader Oracle the Netherlands: “The companies that use Atradius software are serving consumers who are digital and mobile first in every part of their daily lives. They demand the same fast and accurate digital experience from the companies providing financial and insurance services. It is imperative that Atradius provides platforms that enable them to meet these expectations.”\n\nThe launch of Atrium follows the success of the award-winning Atradius Insights online analysis tool that helps insured companies identify risks, monitor portfolio performance and find new business opportunities.\n\nAdditional resources:"
