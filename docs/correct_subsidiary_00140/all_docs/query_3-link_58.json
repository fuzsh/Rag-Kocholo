        "text": "Key Insights\n\nGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Oracle's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions\n\nA total of 3 investors have a majority stake in the company with 52% ownership\n\nIf you want to know who really controls Oracle Corporation ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 44% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nGiven the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Oracle.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Oracle?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Oracle. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Oracle's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Oracle. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Oracle's case, its Top Key Executive, Lawrence Ellison, is the largest shareholder, holding 42% of shares outstanding. With 5.4% and 4.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nTo make our study more interesting, we found that the top 3 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Oracle\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own a reasonable proportion of Oracle Corporation. Insiders own US$145b worth of shares in the US$345b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 14% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.\n\nUltimately the future is most important.
