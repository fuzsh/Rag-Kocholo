        "text": "The Snow Inventory Agents for Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS are installed on the computers and servers in your organization. They collect inventory data, such as software information, software usage, user information and hardware specifications. The agents send the collected data in an encrypted file to a Snow Inventory endpoint for further processing. The data is normalized and later processed and refined for use in Snow Atlas or Snow License Manager.\n\nTo collect Oracle related data, you can deploy the Snow Inventory Oracle Scanners to the computers and servers in your Oracle environments:\n\nThe data collected by the Oracle Scanners is included in the encrypted file that the Snow Inventory Agent sends to the Snow Inventory endpoint. The type of endpoint differs depending on whether you are in a Snow Atlas or a Snow License Manager environment."
