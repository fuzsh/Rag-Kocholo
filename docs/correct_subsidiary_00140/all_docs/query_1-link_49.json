        "text": "Before I explain my undying love for OBRM let me first tell you why I call this billing system The Baap (Father) of all the Billing Systems in the world. This is for the simplest reason that this is the only-of-its-kind futuristic convergent billing platform that caters to all the industries. Though it was started by Portal’s founder Mr. John Little in Cupertino, California, USA as an ISP billing system but it has grown to a great extent today. After Portal’s acquisition of Solution42, a German company which has a rating product called integRate for GSM services, the telecom companies around the world started vying for Portal Infranet and Pipeline (Portal renamed integRate to Pipeline). And when Oracle acquired Portal Software in 2006 the OSS/BSS world was literally shaken. Oracle’s intentions were clear, they wanted to rule the communication, media, and entertainment industry with this billing system. Soon after acquiring Portal they renamed their product Portal Infranet/Pipeline to Oracle Communications Billing and Revenue Management (Oracle BRM/OBRM/OCBRM). Today, you name any big telco operator in the world they must be using Oracle BRM. This is the kind of impact this billing system has.\n\nHowever, by calling Oracle BRM the Baap (Father) of all the billing systems I want to devalue other Billing products in the market. They are also big in their own way. But, OBRM is huge, humongous. No other billing system can compete with this. Its very powerful, robust, flexible, and highly customisable. When I mentioned in the first paragraph above that it can be leveraged to be used in any any industry its so because of its this highly customisable feature. You can use it in manufacturing, medical, petroleum & gas, automobiles, banking, real-estate, cloud, Internet of Things (IoT) etc.\n\nNow, let me tell you about my undying love for Oracle BRM.\n\nReason #1\n\nIts highly scalable, easier to implement, powerful, robust, flexible, out-of-the-box, customisable, and convergent.\n\nReason #2\n\nIts interesting. Interesting? weird. Isn't it? My answer is no. Its so techie that it can easily make the engineering and MCA/BCA/Ph.D. sophomores scratch their head in perplexity that they need to first gain experience on this. Though, the core of this system is written in C programming language, it uses C++, Perl, UNIX shell script, Oracle SQL & PL/SQL, and JAVA extensively. So, only after working on this for few years one would be able to understand the complete system.\n\nThe interesting part lies in its development & implementation, and testing & support. Have you ever wondered what would it be like that you work on something that is used on a daily basis and you see your code doing the trick live in action? When you make a phone call through your mobile/landline the CDRs generated for your calls gets fed to the Oracle BRM system which calls various that you configured/worked on to applies rates, discounts, roaming charges etc and finally creates a bill and sends you an invoice in case of postpaid. Pre-paid happens on the fly. This is just the beginning. Welcome to BRM.\n\nAlso, when you write codes that doesnt work you rewrite them again and again until it works and do various testing to ensure the results of your implementations are correct. There is whole lot of other interesting facets of Oracle BRM. Just dive into it and you will fall in love with this.\n\nReason #3\n\nIf you become an OBRM professional you will earn enough that can help you lead a good life in any metro city in India and the world.\n\nReason #4\n\nIt will take you places. Soon with OBRM on your backpack you will become a globetrotter.\n\nReason #5\n\nIt will help you grow career wise very quickly.\n\nReason #6\n\nYou will work with the best mind in the world.\n\nWhen I started working on this, Portal Infranet version was 6.0.2 & 6.0.3 and Portal had not opened up their shop in Bangalore/India. After gaining some experience at my first company I joined Portal India where I was part of Solution’s Engineering Group.\n\nThen I did some consulting and my life was on cloud 9. Right then a bad luck stuck me and I fell ill for a very long time. I almost got a second life after that. Post this I worked on OBRM on on and off basis but my quest to learn more and more of it continued. Today, I am all geared up again and ready to reboot my OBRM career after 2 long years of hiatus.\n\nCome, lets walk the OBRM path together and empower the world with this beautiful technology.\n\nI am a proud OBRMer."
