This paid, 12-week program, launched in 2013 in India, provides individuals with an opportunity to strengthen their technical skills, explore a new career path and assess their ability to transition back into the workforce on a full-time basis. Following the Returnship, the program provides opportunities to explore joining the firm as a fulltime employee.\n\nIndia Veterans Integration Program\n\nLaunched in 2014 in India, Goldman Sachs Veterans Integration Program, previously known as the Armed Forces Integration Program, provides officers joining the civilian workforce after serving in the armed forces with an opportunity to develop their professional skills, strengthen their understanding of financial services and prepare for future careers in the industry. The 12-week paid program is crafted as a âhands onâ experience and offers participating veterans a real view into future responsibilities and demands. Based on performance, and depending on the availability of suitable roles, the initiative provides an opportunity to explore full-time roles following completion of the program.\n\nParenting Support: Onsite Childrenâs Center and Parenting Program\n\nThe firm provides working parents with access to onsite childcare services including both full-time and backup care.

Services include mentoring, personalized coaching, health and nutrition consultations, lactation support and manager sensitization programs.\n\nThe mission of the Womenâs India Network is to help the firm achieve its gender diversity goals, to enable the firm to become the employer of choice for women, and to help attract, develop and retain talented women in the workforce.\n\nIDIF is a forum to raise awareness and understanding of the needs, priorities and potential of people with disabilities. Our vision is to ensure that Goldman Sachs is an employer of choice for individuals with a disability and that the firm is accessible to all.\n\nAs part of Goldman Sachsâ global commitment to diversity, the networkâs mission is to advocate an inclusive work environment that respects lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender professionals, and enables them to perform to their fullest potential and contribute to the greater goals of the firm.\n\nThe mission of the AFIF is to assist the firm in recruiting and integration processes of talent from the armed forces; enhance the firmâs outlook as employer of choice, and provide leadership on veteran affairs in India."
