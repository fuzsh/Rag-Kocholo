        "text": "Oracle and TimeControl Resources Portal\n\nHMS Software has had a relationship with Oracle since 1997. TimeControl uses Oracle Technology to empower our users at multiple architectural, database and application levels.\n\nAt a technical level, HMS supports a wide range of Oracle Technology from within TimeControl. HMS Software's multi-facted relationship with Oracle started from several different places.\n\nIn 1997, HMS and Oracle started a partner alliance based on TimeControl's newfound support of the Oracle database. At the same time, TimeControl clients began linking TimeControl with Oracle Financials, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards. PeopleSoft and JD Edwards would become a part of Oracle in 2005. In 1997 TimeControl also officially became a Primavera technology partner and released a link between TimeControl and Primavera's P3 project planning software. Primavera would become a part of Oracle in 2008.\n\nHMS Software is an Oracle Gold Partner and our support of these different Oracle product lines continues. There are many clients who use TimeControl in conjunction with one or more elements of Oracle technology. This portal brings the myriad resources on our website relating to Oracle into one index. You will find webcasts, factsheets, white papers, screen shots, PowerPoint presentations and links to external sources to help you to deploy TimeControl and Oracle products together.\n\nPopular links for Oracle clients include:\n\nIntegrating TimeControl with Oracle-Primavera\n\nTimeControl has had a link to Primavera's scheduling systems since 1997. Some of the largest deployments of TimeControl have been done in conjunction with Primavera's products. We have maintained links from TimeControl with every Primavera scheduling system version since 1997. TimeControl links to both Primavera Professional and Primavera EPPM\n\nRead more...\n\nIntegrating TimeControl with Oracle-Primavera and Hard Dollar's HD PCM\n\nWhen HMS designed TimeControl Industrial to integrate Hard Dollar's HD PCM project estimating and cost control system we knew already that Hard Dollar and Primavera had a working integration themselves. Given that TimeControl also links to Primavera, we designed the HD PCM link so that it can work in collaboration with the Primavera link. The result is remarkable. You can now integrate TimeControl Industrial (or TimeControl), Hard Dollar's HD PCM and Oracle-Primavera into one powerful project control environment where the best of each product is used to control an aspect of the projet.\n\nRead more...\n\nTimeControl and ERP/Finance Systems\n\nVirtually every ERP and Finance System comes with its own timesheet yet, in some organizations these timesheets are never deployed. In other organizations ERP timesheets systems are deployed and become only one of several timesheets that are maintained. TimeControl's flexibility is the ideal solution to complement ERP systems because of all the different roles it can fulfill.\n\nRead more...\n\nAlso, don't forget to visit the other TimeControl Use Cases areas by looking at the menu selection on the left side of this page.\n\nRelated Content"
