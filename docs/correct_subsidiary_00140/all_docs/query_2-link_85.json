        "text": "Author: Mark Paterson, Director of Product Management, Oracle Content and Experience\n\nThe JD Edwards EnterpriseOne integration with Oracle Content and Experience offers you the following benefits out of the box:\n\nStore documents in the cloud\n\nIn-context transaction and internal operational collaboration\n\nCollaborate with external customers, suppliers or partners\n\nReduce storage costs\n\nBeyond this however, with Oracle Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), a business can create its own custom applications. An example of such a custom application might be a supplier portal.\n\nDoes your procurement process rely on manual coordination and multiple communication channels? For many businesses, the procurement process involves manual coordination that can be costly in both time and labor:\n\nBuyers must contact the provider to determine the status of a purchase order, often more than once\n\nBuyers must manually update purchase order status as status changes\n\nSuppliers are often unaware of pending orders which creates delays\n\nSuppliers submit invoices in different ways that often require manual re-entry of order information\n\nCommunicating through phone calls and email can slow the process\n\nA supplier portal built using JD Edwards orchestrations and Oracle PaaS Services (Oracle Content and Experience and Oracle Integration Cloud) could automate many of the steps in the procurement process to provide an efficient, integrated process flow.\n\nThis article explores how such a supplier portal could be created using the following services:\n\nThe diagram below shows a possible integration architecture between JD Edwards EnterpriseOne, Oracle Integration Cloud, and Oracle Content and Experience for creating a supplier portal that automates many of the steps in the purchase order fulfillment process.\n\nFigure 1 – Sample Supplier Portal Architecture\n\nImagine the following personas using such a portal…\n\nLet’s examine the procurement process user flows Morgan and Joshua are regularly part of:\n\nMorgan creates the purchase order\n\nJoshua ships the order\n\nMorgan receives the order\n\nJoshua submits the invoice\n\nBuyer Creates the Purchase Order\n\nIn this step, the Morgan issues a purchase order (PO) in JD Edwards and Joshua is notified so he can review and acknowledge that Dakota Farms can fulfill the order.\n\nThis sequence includes the following actions:\n\nA JDE print orchestration creates a PDF version of the purchase order and routes it to the appropriate folder in Oracle Content and Experience.\n\nAdding the purchase order to the folder updates the list of buyer purchase orders on the supplier website and initiates a process in Oracle Process Cloud that notifies Joshua and sets pertinent metadata for the file.\n\nJoshua can use the portal to acknowledge receipt of the purchase order which ties back in to the Oracle Process Cloud to notify the buyer and update the purchase order status in JD Edwards.\n\nFigure 2 – Submit Purchase Order with Supplier Acknowledgement\n\nSupplier Ships the Order\n\nIn this step, the Joshua ships the order to the buyer and submits invoice.\n\nThis sequence includes the following actions:\n\nJoshua uses the portal to indicate that the order has been shipped. This starts a process in Oracle Process Cloud that notifies the buyer, sets pertinent metadata for the file, and updates the purchase order status in JD Edwards.\n\nAs part of this same flow Joshua is asked to upload the invoice associated with the purchase order. The invoice gets stored in the appropriate folder in Oracle Content and Experience, which starts an invoice approval process.\n\nFigure 3 – Supplier Ships the Order\n\nBuyer Receives the Order\n\nIn this step, Morgan receives the order and Joshua is notified of receipt.\n\nThis sequence includes the following actions:\n\nMorgan creates a receipt of goods.\n\nA JDE print orchestration creates a PDF version of the receipt and stores it in the appropriate folder in Oracle Content and Experience Cloud.\n\nAdding a receipt to the folder starts a process in Oracle Process Cloud Service that notifies Joshua and sets pertinent metadata for the file.\n\nFigure 4 – Buyer Receives the Order\n\nSupplier Submits the Invoice\n\nIn this step, the submitted invoice is processed.\n\nThis sequence includes the following actions:\n\nIn previous sequence when Joshua shipped the order he also uploaded an invoice. The invoice is stored in the appropriate folder in Oracle Content and Experience.\n\nWhen the invoice is added to the folder, pertinent metadata is applied to the file and a process is started in Oracle Process Cloud that notifies the approver, typically accounts payable.\n\nAccounts payable reviews and approves the invoice which triggers Oracle Process Cloud to send invoice data for the creation of the needed voucher to JD Edwards.\n\nIn addition, the Oracle Process Cloud notifies Joshua that the invoice has been approved for payment.\n\nFigure 5 – Supplier Submits the Invoice\n\nDescription of “Figure – Supplier Submits the Invoice”\n\nYour procurement processes may not match up with these exactly but hopefully they help illustrate what is possible. The benefits of Procure to Pay Process Automation include the following:\n\nFriction is removed, process is simplified\n\nBuyer receives orders faster\n\nSupplier receives payment faster\n\nReal time buyer/supplier collaboration\n\nBuyer Supplier relationship improves\n\nReduced process costs\n\nIncreased transaction accuracy\n\nA supplier portal is just one example of a custom application that becomes possible using Oracle Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). These same ideas could be re-imagined as a partner portal, a customer portal, a contracts portal, …"
