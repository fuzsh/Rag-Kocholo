        "text": "3.1.1 What is Oracle Application Server Portal?\n\nOracle Application Server Portal is a Web-based tool for building and deploying e-business portals. It provides a secure, manageable environment for accessing and interacting with enterprise software services and information resources. A portal page makes data from multiple sources accessible from a single location. Figure 3-1 shows a sample portal page from http://my.oracle.com. Each one of the tabbed areas within the Office tab contains information from a different data source.\n\n3.1.1.1 Introducing Oracle Instant Portal\n\nOracle Instant Portal is a custom application built with OracleAS Portal that provides smaller enterprises an opportunity to build simple portals in a short amount of time. Oracle Instant Portal provides instant out-of-the-box portals for secure publishing and content sharing, which is ideal for enterprises with a need for smaller-scale intranets or an internal communications hub.\n\nFigure 3-2 Oracle Instant Portal Build Tab\n\nDescription of \"Figure 3-2 Oracle Instant Portal Build Tab\"\n\nUnlike OracleAS Portal portals, Oracle instant portals are intended for user communities that have well-defined, somewhat limited needs for information sharing. These kinds of communities might include:\n\nIndividual departments or groups within a larger organization\n\nA subset of your organization that wishes to share information with partners or ISVs\n\nKey Oracle Instant Portal features include:\n\nPre-created, preconfigured pages that are ready for content loading immediately.\n\nPreconfigured home page to display news, announcements, and newly added content. Plus, each user has an area for their favorite content, which they can choose through simple personalization tools.\n\nPoint-and-click operations let you easily manage pages, contribute and manage content, and create and manage user accounts.\n\nIntuitive user interface that is easy to learn and easy to use.\n\nIn-place editing provides a simple, WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editing experience right on the page.\n\nIn addition, as your portal needs grow, you can easily migrate your Oracle Instant Portals to the full Oracle Application Server Portal.\n\n3.3.1 Portal Page Creation, Management, and Customization\n\nOracleAS Portal incorporates a portal creation and deployment framework. The framework defines Web information sources as information components, and assembles these components within a portal page. It also supports customization of the Web page to one or more user communities.\n\nEach portal page is divided into either item regions or portlet regions. Item regions allow you to add text, images, and files to a portal page. Portlet regions provide an area where you can place one or more portlets.\n\nA portlet is an HTML or XML area that summarizes, promotes, or provides basic access to an information resource. The information resources can take on many forms and can serve many purposes. Stock feeds, weather forecasts, even other Web sites are all examples of information that can appear as portlets on a page.\n\nItems and portlets are the fundamental building blocks of an OracleAS Portal page. Page owners can populate the pages they create with content, or they can delegate that task, as well as page maintenance tasks, to other users.\n\n3.3.2 Portal Content Publishing and Management\n\nOracleAS Portal provides an integrated set of features for self-service document publishing, file upload, page formatting, and access control. Collaborators and content publishers no longer need specific technical skills or a Webmaster to publish their content. Instead, they can use an item region on a portal page to publish their content and format content appearance using simple controls.\n\nAn item region includes built-in features for publishing, organizing, classifying, cross-referencing, and displaying the content it manages. Key components that make up an item region include:\n\nItems that are the pieces of content themselves: Items are defined by the base content that makes up the item and one or more attributes that describe the item. Item publishers create items by completing a series of steps in a wizard. Additional features, such as item version control, check-in and check-out, expiration, and automatic indexing support collaborative document creation and ease content management tasks.\n\nStyles that define how items are displayed: Item region style properties govern the colors, font properties, size, background images, banners, and other graphical elements for the items and navigation bars in an item region.\n\nItem regions also include components that assist users in navigating or locating content of interest and allow for classifying content with categories and perspectives.\n\nOracleAS Portal provides categories and perspectives as a means of applying a classification to the content (items and portlets) you add to your portal. Categories and perspectives can be used to locate content during searches. Categories are used to describe the type of content you are adding. For example, if you are creating a Human Resources page, you might have categories such as Benefits, Policies, and Payroll. Perspectives are used to describe the type of audience who might be interested in the content, such as managers, supervisors, and non-exempt employees.\n\n3.4.1 Integrating with Portlet Providers\n\nApplications and information sources, represented as portlets, communicate with the portal through a provider. Each portlet only has one provider, and a provider can have one or more portlets that expose an underlying application or information source.\n\nAll portlets from portlet providers make use of Oracle Application Server Single Sign-On, regardless of their location. It is not necessary for portlets to be deployed within Oracle Application Server or even on the same hardware. This ensures that only authorized users are able to subscribe to a particular portlet and that authorized users can access all registered portlets by logging into their main portal page.\n\n3.4.1.1 Oracle Application Server Portlets\n\nSome Oracle Application Server components act as portlet providers to OracleAS Portal. This allows you to easily integrate information from various Oracle Application Server components into a single portal page.\n\n3.4.1.1.1 Oracle Application Server Reports Services\n\nOracleAS Portal includes a simple report building facility. However, as your reports become more complex, you can import the report into Oracle Application Server Reports Services reports. You can deploy any Oracle Application Server Reports Services report as a portlet.\n\n3.4.1.1.2 Oracle Business Intelligence Discoverer\n\nAs a portlet provider, Oracle Business Intelligence Discoverer offers worksheet portlets and list of workbooks portlets to OracleAS Portal users. A worksheet portlet contains information from a single Discoverer worksheet. The portlet displays this information in either a table, a graph, or both. The list of workbooks portlet presents a list of available workbooks.\n\n3.4.1.2 Partner Portlets\n\nIn addition to the list of Oracle Application Server components, a growing community of independent software vendors (ISVs) and Internet content providers are creating standard, supported portlets that access their applications and services. For these partners, customers can access the partner's application or service through one or more pre-integrated portlets.\n\nThe current catalog of portlets includes the following services:\n\nBusiness intelligence and reporting (including Axis Technology and Quest Software)\n\nCollaboration (including Cubika Internet Technology and SiteScape)\n\nDocument, content, and knowledge management (including Interwoven and STI AS)\n\nE-business applications, such as customer relationship management and enterprise resource management (including Billboard and Droplets)\n\nNews and information sources (including NT-Exchange.com)\n\nPortal tools (including Curl Corporation and Oracle Application Server Portal Developer Kit)\n\nInternet searches (including Business Objects and Quest Software)\n\nSee Also:\n\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technology/products/ias/portal/ for a complete list of Partner portlets\n\n3.4.1.3 Custom Portlets\n\nThe Oracle Application Server Portal Developer Kit (PDK) allows developers to either reuse existing applications as portlets or create new portlets. Developers can write portlets using familiar languages and technologies. These technologies can be as follows:\n\nJava applications\n\nOracle PL/SQL packages\n\nWeb pages built with any standard technology like Active Server Pages (ASPs) or Perl\n\nWeb services\n\nSee Also:\n\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technology/products/ias/portal/ for more information on the Oracle Application Server Portal Developer Kit\n\nAdditionally, PDK developers can take advantage of the Knowledge Exchange, available through Portal Studio, to leverage portlets created by other Oracle Application Server Portal users.\n\n3.4.2 Oracle Application Server Portal Integration with Oracle Application Server Web Cache\n\nOracle Application Server Portal is closely integrated with Oracle Application Server Web Cache to improve the overall availability, scalability, and performance of OracleAS Portal. OracleAS Web Cache combines caching, compression, and assembly technologies to accelerate the delivery of both static and dynamically generated Portal content.\n\nOracleAS Portal functions as a web cache origin server to take advantage of OracleAS Web Cache features such as fine-grained cache control and load balancing.\n\nSee Also:\n\nChapter 9, \"Performance and Caching\" for more information about Oracle Application Server Web Cache\n\n3.4.2.1 Oracle Application Server Web Cache Deployment with Oracle Application Server Portal\n\nWhen you install Oracle Application Server Portal, an OracleAS Web Cache instance is automatically created with pre-defined cache configuration settings. Portal sites can choose from the following deployment options:\n\nCo-located: OracleAS Web Cache runs on the same physical server as the Portal middle tier. This configuration is appropriate for smaller, low-volume sites where the scalability of the middle tier is not a concern.\n\nDedicated: OracleAS Web Cache is deployed on a dedicated server that sits in front of one or more Portal middle-tier servers. Dedicated deployments are usually preferable to co-located deployments, as there is no risk of resource contention with other server processes. OracleAS Web Cache performs well on commodity hardware, so a dedicated deployment does not have to be costly in terms of hardware expenditure.\n\nFor very high-volume sites and to avoid a single point of failure, two or more nodes running OracleAS Web Cache may be deployed behind a third-party network load balancer. If you have multiple deployments of OracleAS Portal, each Portal site can have its own OracleAS Web Cache server, or one or more sites can share a single Web Cache. Similarly, a Web Provider can share a Web Cache with a Portal site, or a dedicated Web Cache can be deployed in front of the Web server that hosts the Web Provider.\n\nA browser-based console , Oracle Application Server Web Cache Manager, is used to administer all aspects of OracleAS Web Cache, including configuration of caching and load balancing rules, security, manual and automated invalidation, monitoring, and logging."
