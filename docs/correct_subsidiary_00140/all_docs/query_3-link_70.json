        "text": "Oracle Autonomous Database is a cloud-based relational database service offered by Oracle Corporation. It is designed as a highly automated, secure database solution that optimizes performance and reliability while minimizing manual database management tasks like backing up, tuning and upgrading.\n\nIt is called \"Autonomous\" because of its automation features, which allow seamless integration with other Oracle Cloud services and tools.\n\nOracle Autonomous Database is configured for high availability, with redundant systems and automatic failover mechanisms ensuring the database remains accessible in the event of hardware and software failures. Because the product requires minimal manual intervention, users can devote more time to developing applications and analyzing data.\n\nOracle Database stores data using a hierarchical structure to support complex business applications.\n\nLogical data storage in Oracle refers to how data is logically organized and structured within the database itself, independent of the physical storage details.\n\nThe fundamental, logical building block for storing data in Oracle is the table, which contains rows and columns.\n\nA table, the basic storage unit in Oracle Database, works similarly to a spreadsheet, with rows (“records” or “tuples”) and columns. A row represents a single entry of data in a table. A column specifies a specific attribute or property of the data. For instance, in a table named Employee, each row might represent a single employee's data and the columns might include \"EmployeeID\", \"FirstName\", etc.\n\nAt a physical level in Oracle Database, data is stored in data files, which are organized into tablespaces. A tablespace is a logical storage container that groups related, physical data files. Within each tablespace, data is further organized into segments, which are sets of extents that contain the actual data blocks for a specific database object, such as a table or index. Each table or index has its own segment within a tablespace.\n\nPhysical storage in the file system is managed as operating system blocks, but within Oracle, the database works with data blocks as the fundamental units of storage. Data blocks contain actual data, and they are organized into tablespaces."
