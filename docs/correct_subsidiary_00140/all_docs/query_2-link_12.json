        "text": "5.1.1 Creating an Oracle Instant Portal\n\nPerhaps the best way to determine if an Oracle instant portal will suit your needs is to simply create one and experiment with it. To create an Oracle instant portal:\n\nGo to the Build tab in OracleAS Portal:\n\nFigure 5-1 Build Tab in OracleAS Portal\n\nScroll down until you see the Oracle Instant Portal portlet:\n\nFigure 5-2 Oracle Instant Portal Portlet\n\nEnter a name for the portal in the Name field under Create an Oracle Instant Portal.\n\nClick Create.\n\nNote:\n\nBy default, all Oracle instant portals are based on a company theme. That means you get one page dedicated to each common line of business: Sales, Marketing, Finance, and Human Resources. You can rename these pages, or, if you decide you want to create new instances of Oracle instant portal with your own structure of pages and sub-pages, you can create an XML file to define that structure. The OracleAS Portal online Help topic \"Sample XML File\" provides an excellent starting point for this task.\n\nThe default Oracle Instant Portal home page looks like this:\n\nFigure 5-3 Default Configuration of the Home Page\n\nOf course, instead of Oracle Instant Portal, you'll see whatever name you supplied when you created your portal.\n\nAs you can see, right out of the box you're presented with a fully functioning, albeit simple portal, ready for you to start adding content. Before you start doing so, however, let's take a quick tour of the home page and talk about some of the customizations you may wish to make there.\n\nNote:\n\nBecause you created this Oracle instant portal, you automatically are considered an administrator of the portal and thus have full capabilities within it. For a better understanding of Oracle Instant Portal's users and security model, see the Oracle Instant Portal online Help.\n\nFamiliarizing Yourself with the Home Page\n\nLike all home pages, the Oracle Instant Portal home page is intended to be a central access point for items of interest to all users of the portal. To make things easier, the body of the page is divided into four distinct areas in which those items can appear:\n\nNews: Items pertaining to events occurring in your industry, for example, or at a corporate level.\n\nAnnouncements: Items that remind or inform people of upcoming events within your company or department.\n\nNew Content: Items that were added anywhere within the portal over the last seven days. The New Content area is automatically populated; you don't have to do a thing.\n\nFavorite Content: Content unique to each user. As users move through the portal, they can flag content they want to see on their home page by clicking an icon that appears beside each item.\n\nNow let's see a home page that has undergone a bit of customization at a fictitious company, TangFish Software:\n\nFigure 5-4 Typical Customizations for the Home Page\n\nThe Oracle Instant Portal administrator at TangFish Software has customized this page to reflect the company's identity in several ways:\n\nThe name of the company appears in the banner.\n\nThe company's official logo also appears in the banner.\n\nAlong the left side of the page, the administrator added links to e-mail addresses for TangFish's Support and Feedback groups, so that users can access them quickly.\n\nA link to the company's corporate Web site was added at the bottom of the page.\n\nThe color scheme has changed from the default blue to red and black.\n\nThese are all things the administrator did explicitly. If you're the Oracle Instant Portal administrator, you'll probably want to make similar kinds of customizations to your own home page. The next section arms you with an understanding of the basic principles of how Oracle Instant Portal works so you're prepared to do just that.\n\nUnderstanding Oracle Instant Portal\n\nLet's take a look at another page from TangFish Software's portal to help illustrate some basic Oracle Instant Portal concepts:\n\nFigure 5-5 Geography of a Typical Oracle Instant Portal Page\n\nFor the executives at TangFish Software, the default tabs along the top (Company, Finance, Marketing, and so forth) are perfectly suited to their goals, as they wish to create a company-wide intranet that includes these organizations. This may be the case for your group as well, or you might want to rename the tabs or create new ones to better reflect your organization. A travel agency, say, might find that tabs named Hotels, Restaurants, Air Fares, and Rental Cars are more closely aligned with the kind of work it does.\n\nWhen you click a tab, a page called a top-level page is displayed. In this example, the content of the Sales top-level page is displayed on the right side of the page, which is called the content area. Although the Sales page is populated with content in this example, by default all top-level pages are empty, waiting for you and your users to load them with content.\n\nNotice the navigation area on the left, which appears on every page (except the home page). The navigation area contains:\n\nThe search box, which enables you to search the entire portal for a given string, or limit your search to a single top-level page.\n\nA list of child pages which, in the case of the Sales top-level page, are called Sales Reports, Presentations, Customers, and so on. Child pages are pages you create below a top-level page to organize the content, just as you use folders and sub-folders on your Windows workstation. Every top-level page comes with its own set of preconfigured pages designed to help you organize your work within a given theme. And because each child page can have its own child pages (the Customers page has three), you can easily create a hierarchy to neatly organize all of your content. The Sales hierarchy, for example, looks like this:\n\nFigure 5-6 Child Pages of the Sales Top-Level Page\n\nNow that you understand the concept of top-level and child pages, let's return to the home page for a moment. Recall that the content that appears there is simply a collection of content from other places. The News and Announcements areas of the home page are actually populated by two child pages of the Company page, as illustrated here:\n\nFigure 5-7 Announcements and News Populate the Home Page\n\nBy default, the Company page comes with two child pages, News and Announcements. Whatever you place on those pages also appears in the News and Announcements areas on the home page.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you don't like the names of the News and Announcements areas, you can easily change them to names that more closely reflect the kind of content you want to display on your home page. As soon as you change the page names, the corresponding areas on the home page change as well.\n\n5.2.1 Contributing Content\n\nHere again is the sample page from the TangFish Software portal:\n\nFigure 5-8 Items on the Sales Page\n\nEach block of text delineated by horizontal lines is an item within the portal. In this example, there are two items: \"Welcome to the Sales Department\" and \"Sales Forecast Expected Soon.\" Items are the means through which you add content to your portal. You can add items to the portal in edit mode. To toggle to edit mode, click the Edit Mode icon, located at the top of every Oracle Instant Portal page. You will see the Edit Mode icon (Figure 5-9) only if you have privileges to add content to the page:\n\nFigure 5-9 Edit Mode Handle Bar\n\n(More about privileges later.) Once you are in edit mode, you'll see the New Item button, located in the content area:\n\nFigure 5-10 New Item Button\n\nWhen you click the New Item button, a list of item types is displayed:\n\nFigure 5-11 Available Items in Oracle Instant Portal\n\nThe type of item you select depends upon the kind of content you want to add, as described in Table 5-1:\n\nTable 5-1 Items in Oracle Instant Portal\n\nIf you have this kind of content... Add this type of item\n\nOnce you select the type of item you want to add, all you have to do is follow the prompts to supply the necessary information. For example, when you add a File item, you are prompted for the file you want to upload. Once you confirm the file name, the file is uploaded to the portal repository. Then you can add the title and summary text to the page so that others can understand what you just uploaded.\n\nNote:\n\nUnlike OracleAS Portal, the set of items available to Oracle Instant Portal users is fixed. Custom item types are not available in Oracle Instant Portal.\n\nThe first time you add a Rich Text or Expandable Rich Text item, you'll be impressed by how Oracle Instant Portal's in-place editing capabilities drastically simplify the task. As soon as you add an item, it appears on the page in context, ready for you to begin editing:\n\nFigure 5-12 Adding a Rich Text Item\n\nNow you can start entering the title, the summary, and the text of the item, exactly as it will appear to your users. And while you're writing your text, you have access to a full range of text editing controls, including bulleted lists, numbered lists, tables, cut and paste, indents and outdents, and so on. You can even work directly with HTML code, or switch back and forth between modes as you need to. You can also enrich your text by including images, hyperlinks, and tables. In this example, a table is being added, which can be populated or modified using the standard table editing tools:\n\nFigure 5-13 Inserting a Table in a Rich Text Item\n\nTo give you the flexibility you need, Oracle Instant Portal enables you to cut and copy items, move items to different pages, delete items—all the tools you need to develop content-rich portals and allow you to manage and share that content with others. And if something isn't quite right with what you've done, you can use the Revert key to restore the portal to the way it was before you started editing.\n\nNote:\n\nIf you have WebDAV enabled, you can add your Oracle instant portal as a Web folder and interact with it right from your desktop.\n\n5.2.3 Administering Oracle Instant Portal\n\nManaging an Oracle instant portal is far less complicated and takes significantly less time than managing a full-scale enterprise portal. With just a few simple steps, you can brand your portal with your corporate identity, select a color scheme for your portal, and set up accounts for all your users.\n\nTip:\n\nIf you're the Oracle Instant Portal administrator, look for the topic called \"Setting Up Oracle Instant Portal: A checklist\" in the online Help for a complete list of the customization options available to you.\n\n5.2.3.1 Customizing the Look and Feel\n\nThere are three main ways in which to brand your portal, two of which occur in the portal's banner. The banner is the top region of the page, which is identical for every page within the portal. Here is an example of a typical banner:\n\nFigure 5-16 Tangfish Banner\n\nThe Welcome link at the top of the banner contains the name of the logged in user (in this example, MARCO), along with links to log out of the portal or change aspects of the user's account. You can also add your own corporate logo to the right side of the banner, and provide a name for the portal on the left.\n\nSelecting a style for your portal is equally easy. By clicking the style icon, you can display ten different styles, each centered around a different color scheme. As you run your cursor down the list, you can instantly see how your portal appears in each color. When you select the one you want, the entire portal is rendered in that color scheme for every user.\n\nFigure 5-17 Selection of Styles in Oracle Instant Portal\n\n5.2.3.2 Controlling Access to Your Portal\n\nCreating users and managing the roles they are to play within the portal can be an arduous task. In Oracle Instant Portal, however, a simple security model protects your content without placing an undue burden on you, the administrator.\n\nA single user can have a different level of security for each top-level page within the portal: View, Contribute, or Manage.\n\nView privileges allow the user to view content on the page.\n\nContribute privileges allow the user to add items to the page.\n\nManage privileges give the user full permissions over the page, including the ability to add child pages.\n\nThe privileges you set for a top-level page cascade down to the child pages as well.\n\nUsers are created and their permissions managed through a single, easy-to-use dialog:\n\nFigure 5-18 Manage User Rights Window\n\nThe left pane lists all registered users. When you select a user on the left, the pane on the right reflects that user's privilege level for each top-level page in the portal. Granting or revoking privileges is as simple as checking or unchecking a box.\n\nYou can also control access to a page from the page itself, by clicking the Manage Page Privileges icon (circled in Figure 5-19):\n\nFigure 5-19 Establish Security for a Page\n\nThe Manage Page Privileges window looks similar to the Manage User Rights window, but the privileges you can set there are confined to the page from which it was launched.\n\nWhen a user is granted Manage privileges on any portal's home page, that user is considered an Oracle Instant Portal administrator and has full privileges over that particular portal. Additionally, the Oracle Instant Portal administrator can:\n\nCreate new users.\n\nDelete any user in the Manage User Rights dialog, even those he or she did not create. (For this reason, it's wise to restrict the number of users who have Manage privileges on a home page.)\n\nCreate new Oracle instant portals.\n\nUsers that were created through OracleAS Portal can also have access to Oracle instant portals, as long as you first add the users to the OIP_AVAILABLE_USERS group. Then you can use the Manage User Rights dialog to grant appropriate privilege levels to the users.\n\n5.2.3.2.1 What Users Are Created By Default?\n\nDuring the OracleAS Portal install process, two users are created: PORTAL and ORCLADMIN. Both of these users are considered Oracle Instant Portal administrators for every Oracle instant portal, regardless of who created them. In addition, two user groups are created during installation:\n\nOIP_USER_ADMINS, who can both create Oracle instant portals and perform user administration on them. PORTAL is a member of this group.\n\nOIP_AVAILABLE_USERS, list of users who can access Oracle instant portals. This list appears in the Manage User Rights dialog."
