Paid listings are billed based on the pricing model that you select. BYOL listing can be either free or paid. In the case of a paid BYOL listing, the customer works directly with the partner or their other resale channels to obtain and pay for that software license.\n\nWhere are the Oracle Cloud Marketplace listings available?\n\nFree and Bring Your Own License (BYOL) listings are available in all Oracle Cloud regions. Paid listings are available in all US commercial regions.\n\nWhile creating a listing, I don't see OCI Application Listing as an option.

See Submitting a Listing.\n\nYou can monitor the status during the approval process and respond to review comments provided by the Oracle Cloud Marketplace administrators. See Monitoring the Listing Status During Approval.\n\nHow do I set my listing to auto-approve after submitting?\n\nYou can't set auto-approve for a listing that you have already submitted. Let's consider that you have submitted a listing in the morning and you receive approval from Oracle to auto-approve your listings by noon. The listing that you had submitted in the morning can't be changed to auto-approve, but all future listings are auto-approved.\n\nHow long will it take for Oracle to approve my listing?\n\nThe time taken for approving each type of listing is as follows:\n\nPaid Listings : 15 days\n\nFree/BYOL Listings: 5 working days\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure Lead Generation Listings only: 5 working days\n\nSee Submitting a Listing.

First, customers deploy a Marketplace application in a Primary region, then they proceed with building the Disaster Recovery on a different region. We encourage Marketplace publishers to provide guidance - documented- to customers on how to deploy your application correctly in a separate region.\n\nNote\n\nMarketplace Snapshot images or Boot devices can't be exported outside the region it is deployed. Therefore, Marketplace suggests the high-level approaches mentioned below.\n\nBlock Volume Replication : Configure your Application to store the data required to restore your application in a Block Volume device attached to Marketplace Instances. This enables customers to make use of OCI Cross-Region Volume replication to transfer data to a different region.\n\nNote\n\nThis approach requires manual setup after Marketplace Instance is launched. See, https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/volumereplication.htm\n\nIn the Disaster Recovery region, customers launch a new Marketplace Instance. Then, attach replicated block devices, where your application should be able to find the data required to bring services back online.\n\nNote\n\nEach region has its own Instance(s) launched from Marketplace. Any configuration in the Marketplace Instance's boot device must be performed in every region.\n\nMarketplace Stacks with DR setup included: Publish Marketplace stacks that will upon launch, configure all services and infrastructure required for deploying a Disaster Recovery (using Marketplace Images) in a separate region. Terraform Plan will deploy and configure two regions following the same set of instructions.\n\nNote\n\nIf the approaches suggested above do not fall into your application disaster recovery options, we encourage you to provide documentation on how OCI customers can launch your listing in a separate region and use it as a Disaster Recovery strategy. For more information on Disaster Recovery, read more on OCI Architecture Center.\n\nHow do I update my listing in Oracle Cloud Marketplace?\n\nUse the Listings page to manage the listings that youâre creating, that you submitted to Oracle for approval, and that you published to Oracle Cloud Marketplace. You can update your listings using Oracle Cloud Marketplace Partner Portal. See Modifying Listings\n\nHow is billing done when an instance is created from custom image (snapshot) of a marketplace paid listing ?\n\nBilling will be same as the listed image in Marketplace.\n\nHow can I change the price for my paid listing?\n\nTo change the price of a paid listing, you must create and submit a new listing with the updated price. You can't change the price of an existing listing.\n\nI had published a listing in a government region. After I updated my listing, my listing no longer appears in government regions.\n\nThis can happen if you forgot to select government regions as markets while updating the listing or package version. To fix this issue: create a new version of the listing, select government regions as markets while editing the listing, and then publish the updated listing. See Migrating an Image Listing to Government Regions and Replicating Stack Listing to Other Markets.\n\nHow do I change the name of my company?\n\nTo change your company name, send an email to Oracle at marketplace-help_us_grp@oracle.com and submit a ticket to the Partner Assistance Team at https://partnerhelp.oracle.com/app/ask/tool/opn.\n\nYou canât use Oracle Cloud Marketplace Partner Portal to change the name of your company because your company name is associated with your Oracle Partner Network account and membership.\n\nCan companies that are not based in US create listings in Oracle Cloud Marketplace?\n\nYes. Companies that are not based in US can create listings in Oracle Cloud Marketplace.

See Building an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Install Package\n\nWhere can I find the image OCID for a listing on Oracle Cloud Marketplace?\n\nYou can find the Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) of an image using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console.\n\nUsing the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console, create an instance with the image for which you want to find the OCID.\n\nAfter the instance is provisioned, details about it appear in the instance list. To view additional details, including image details, click the instance name.\n\nClick on the image details to view the OCID of the image along with other related information.\n\nCan I use an image with a flexible shape to create artifacts in Oracle Cloud Marketplace?\n\nYes. A flexible shape is a shape with a customizable number of OCPUs. Oracle partners can select a flexible shape as a compatible shape in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console while creating a custom image. Oracle Partners can use such custom images to create artifacts in Oracle Cloud Marketplace Partner Portal. For more information about flexible shapes, see Compute Shapesin Oracle Cloud Infrastructure documentation. For more information about creating an artifact in Oracle Cloud Marketplace, see Creating an Artifact for Stack Listing.\n\nWhere can I find support for a third-party listing?\n\nIf you have any questions for an app that you are creating in the Oracle Cloud Marketplace for a third-party listing, then you can contact the support team for that app. For example, if Acme has listed an app on Oracle Cloud Marketplace and you want to create a listing using the app that Acme has listed.

However , the old partners who don't have OCI automatically added as a product will not have the option to create an OCI Application Listing during the list creating process.
