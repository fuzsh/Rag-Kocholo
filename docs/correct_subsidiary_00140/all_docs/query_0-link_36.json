        "text": "Many large companies now use multiple cloud platforms (multicloud or hybrid cloud). This leads to complex billing from multiple providers, and current solutions often lack transparency or are too expensive. Companies need a cost-effective way to gain insights into their cross-cloud spending and optimize their costs.\n\nWith Looker, you get robust out-of-the-box reporting for your day-to-day needs and long-term optimization initiatives. Looker helps you easily identify the one-off high cost problems faster and slow burn global inefficiencies sooner.\n\nMarketers need to analyze and activate their first-party data but lack a friendly, interactive UI from which to do it from. While this has always been a desire/need, the shifts in data regulations and browser privacy has made this a must-solve problem.\n\nLooker acts as a user interface for this solution. With out-of-the-box analytics (data exploration and dashboards), you can build custom segments from first party data. Looker also offers packaged activation paths to places like Google Analytics, so you can activate those segments.\n\nCompanies are eager to increase data analytics adoption, but the technical learning curve hinders widespread use. While generative AI (gen AI) promises to transform data interaction, businesses struggle to get started and have concerns about the reliability of AI-generated results.\n\nLooker adds an API-first platform that is easy to create and customize data applications, a semantic layer to provide trusted metrics, an in-database architecture to optimize the performance and scalability of the cloud, and gen AI integration to provide a natural language interface into the application.\n\nData monetization is the process of leveraging the data your organization already collects to create new revenue streams or business value. Looker is ideal for data monetization because it allows you to create tailored data products, embed analytics seamlessly, scale with your business, and maintain data security.\n\nCustomers struggle to understand the usage of productivity and collaboration solutions like Google Workspace across the organization, and are often unprepared for security audits of these tools. With the Looker Block for Workspace, you get modeled schemas for Gmail, login, Drive, Meet, and rules. In addition, you get two out-of-the-box dashboards on Security Audit and Adoption and Collaboration, where you can drill down to row level audit log details.\n\nOther Looker for Workspace solutions include: Looker for Connected Sheets, to explore modeled data from Looker within Sheets and bring the power of LookML to the spreadsheet, and Looker Studio integration with Google Sheets, transforming Sheets data into interactive visualizations.\n\nLooker and BigQuery together form a dynamic data analytics powerhouse, transforming raw information into actionable insights that drive business growth. BigQuery's unparalleled ability to store and process massive datasets seamlessly integrates with Looker's intuitive, Google-friendly platform.\n\nWith Looker's semantic modeling layer, complex data relationships are simplified, ensuring a single source of truth and fostering collaboration across your organization. From interactive dashboards and custom applications to real-time insights and AI-powered analytics, Looker and BigQuery empower you to make smarter decisions, faster, and stay ahead of the competition."
