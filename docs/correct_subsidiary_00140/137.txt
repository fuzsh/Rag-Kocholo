3. Oracle Corporation Oracle Corporation is a U.S.-based multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Redwood City, California, United States CEO: Larry Ellison Headquarters: Redwood City, CA, United States of America Founded: June 16, 1977, California, United States Founders: Ed Oates, Larry Ellison, Bob Miner

4. History Ellison took inspiration from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks." He heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the IBM Research Journal provided by Ed Oates (a future co-founder of Oracle). System R also derived from Codd's theories, and Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible with System R, but IBM stopped this by keeping the error codes for their DBMS secret. Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL).

5. In 1979 SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc.(RSI). In 1982, RSI renamed itself Oracle Systems Corporation to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. At this stage Bob Miner served as the company's senior programmer. In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation. The company is officially named Oracle, but sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, which is in fact the name of the holding company. Part of Oracle Corporation's early success arose from using the C programming language to implement its products. This eased porting to different operating systems (most of which support C).
