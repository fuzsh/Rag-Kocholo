        "text": "Along with industrialization and colonialism came the uncompromising worldwide exploitation of natural resources. From extensive single-crop farming to excessive hunting as a recreational sport, man exterminated countless animal and plant species during the last centuries, and systematically destroyed haunts in the water and on the ground in order to ensure his own luxury. No earlier than the 20th century, people realized their harmful influence on nature. Frightening visions emerged in the utopian literature which hinted at the problems of genetic alterations, medical trials and chemical experiments early on. H.G. Welles must be named as a visionary whose anti-utopian nightmares have to this day again and again been adapted for the big screen (“The Island of Dr. Moreau”). And following the controversial nuclear tests after World War II, the international criticism of man’s boundless submission of nature gained strength. This criticism also bore the fear of a revenge of nature, the worry to fall prey to mutations, aggressions and contamination. The nature’s revenge subgenre of the horror film exploited the animal world as the breeding ground of the monstrous. Ideologically, however, the original criticism couldn’t always be found in these films – in fact, the animals themselves were degraded to nightmare figures instead – and the criticism of the underlying reasons oftentimes fell by the wayside.\n\nMore than 45 years after the publication of Arne Næss’s article “The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement” in which the Norwegian philosopher postulated the difference between shallow ecology and deep ecology, the human-nonhuman relationship continues to be at the heart of the debate of environmental philosophy. By adopting diverse approaches and moving from anthropocentric, biocentric, or ecocentric perspectives, environmental philosophers have proposed a variety of theories and models trying to identify the fundamental principles and values on which a coherent, adequate environmental ethics must be based. Within this broad and complex scenario, film can express new and more vivid arguments and offer filmgoers many different film worlds in which they can rethink themselves, reflecting on their role in the ecosystem and their relationship with the nonhuman. Moving from film as philosophy and the related concept of the film world, this paper will focus on the cinematic representation of environment and, in particular, on the analysis of the modes of expression of environmental philosophy in contemporary cinema. Through the analysis of the two conflicting movies The Shallows (Collet-Serra 2016) and The Red Turtle (Dudok de Wit 2016), a discussion on expressive forms will be carried out in order to highlight the key aspects of a film ecophilosophy in which the specific mode of relationship between human and nonhuman is raised to the status of philosophical principle.\n\nThis paper analyses three different films representing attempts of the film industry to portray people in the process of re-establishment of the healthy relationship with the nature and their quest for “ecological self” juxtaposing it with a Freudian definition of civilisation as a defence against nature. It is crucial to mention that movies such as Dersu Uzala, Medicine Man and Take Shelter serve as an explication of cultural myths related to eras of the 1970s, 1990s and 2000s in relation with corresponding real-life worsening of environmental crisis and reflecting psychological impacts of climate change. The analysis demonstrates how this marginal genre as opposes to various apocalyptic and dystopian movies develops from a dialogue of opposing forces of the civilisation and the nature into a sphere of an intimate dialogue within our minds to overcome psychological defence mechanisms and recognise the reality of environmental crisis.\n\nThe essay is divided into three main parts. The first one discusses my theoretical background in animal rights theory and ethical philosophy. I will review the concept of “speciesism” and recite a brief history of animal rights and some of the movement’s main arguments. The second part constitutes a retelling of the story of the now legendary serial killer Ed Gein, whose work inspired at least three generations of horror cinema. His story provides a paradigm example of speciesism in action and of the dystopian world where humans are hunted and killed precisely in the same manner as animals. The third part will analyze selected films from the horror genre in light of four different themes, or motifs, that I believe to resurface again and again in horror cinema. This part will be my experiment to perform what I refer to as a “vegetarian analysis” of filmic examples by referring both to the ethical background of the animal rights movement and the visual representations used to portray the relationship between the killer and his or her victims. By doing so I hope to show that human victims are often represented through animal terms (and can thus be read as symbolic for the status of animals in society) and that the storyworld of these films is one of an extremist “non-speciesist” disposition. The essay concludes with some points for further discussion."
