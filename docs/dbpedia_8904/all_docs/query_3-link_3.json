        "text": "Genre Theory:\n\nThe Horror Film\n\n\"If movies are the dreams of the mass culture... horror movies are the nightmares\"\n\n- Stephen King -\n\nHorror films are without a doubt one of film's most enduring genres for audiences in search of thrills. They are designed to frighten, shock and disgust while evoking our worst hidden fears, ironically captivating and entertaining us at the same time. Horror films are centered around the dark side of life, the forbidden and strange, unexplainable events. They deal with our most primal nature and it's fears: our vulnerability, nightmares, alienation, our terror of the unknown, fear of death and/or our fear of sexuality.\n\nLawrence Grossberg outlined three theories of meaning when discussing the relationship between genres. He stated that \"there are many ways to define a genre as there are theories of meaning, but three are most commonly used. The first defines a genre by a shared set of conventions\" (Grossberg, p.160). These conventions include, but are not limited to, lighting, camera techniques and the strategic use of sound.\n\nLighting in horror films are extremely crucial in creating fear in the viewer. Most horror films have somber, low-key lighting and most of the horrific moments in the movie occur at night.\n\nThe use of good strategic camera techniques in a horror film are also very crucial in creating and instilling fear. One of the major horror conventions is the sustained use of the point-of-view shot, which was prominent and extremely well executed in The Shining. One of the most recognized point-of-view shots within The Shining would have to be the long tracking shot combined with the point-of-view shot which followed Danny throughout The Overlook Hotel on his bike.\n\nFinally, the strategic use of sound is also an extremely important convention in making and creating an impact on the viewers. It helps to instill fear at certain points in the film, as well as preparing us for a 'frightening' scene.\n\nThe second approach which Grossberg outlined, defines \" genre[s] as the underlying structure of values that the genre puts into play\" (Grossberg, p.161). This can be examined as the expectations which individuals come into the film with. Many expect to see a conflict between the 'unknown', or 'monster-like being' with an unforseeing victim within the horror genre. These expectations shape our movie-watching experience, especially when it comes to the horror film. Whatever dark, primitive, and revolting traits that simultaneously attract and repel us are featured in the horror genre. Horror films often violate the laws of nature and are often combined with science fiction. This is apparent when the 'monster' is related to a destruction of technology or Earth being threatened by aliens. These types of movies involve many special effects and heavy make-up. Suspense horror films like Diabolique and The Shining don't revolve around intense editing, yet horrifies the viewer by playing with one's mind. Adding in a psychological element and/or expectation, horror films can successfully fool us into believing that something may be possible in the real world. Horror films - when executed well, by placing less reliance on horrifying special effects - can be an extremely potent film form. It allows the film to tap into audiences dream states, the horror of the irrational, the unknown and the horror within man himself. Horror films are often generally set in spooky old mansions, dark locales with an 'unknown' being, supernatural creatures, the 'possessed', freaks and even the unseen, diabolical presence of evil.
