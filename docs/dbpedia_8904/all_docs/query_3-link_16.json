        "text": "Mary Gabrielle Strause\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n10 min read\n\n·\n\nMar 20, 2016\n\n--\n\n“You’re Next,” a 2011 film directed by Adam Wingard, was a Slasher film with a bit of an off-genre twist. Though it met many of the typical conventions of the genre, the story took a turn of its own in terms of characters, backstory, and characteristics of its’ protagonist.\n\nTypical Conventions Met:\n\nLocation: Usually, in Slasher films, the setting takes place at a location either vastly familiar or unfamiliar with. For example, high school’s are frequently used in Slasher films. This is a common location because it’s a place where the typical victim (high school age students) don’t expect anything unusual or harmful to happen. In You’re Next, the location is both familiar and unfamiliar, so it plays on this typical convention in a new way. Being that they have a vacation home in the woods that they visit infrequently, making them unfamiliar, yet still having stayed there before and having a prior relationship with their neighbor up there, to make it somewhat familiar to them.\n\nFinal Girl/Heroine: Although this is a convention that isn’t entirely met via the typical Slasher film style, Erin still meets most all of the called for characteristics. Like most Slasher Films, our heroine, Erin, is strong and fueled by good deeds. She wishes to protect all around her to the best of her ability and has nothing but good intentions towards all. She is the last one standing at the end of the film, as she has constantly been fighting throughout, and of course, she kills the bad guys. There are also a few characteristics that Erin had that didn’t match the typical Final Girl, whatsoever, but we’ll talk about in a moment.\n\nWeapons: Most Slasher films, if not all, rarely use guns. Knives, axes, bows, bats, fists, and other weapons that use organic force are the typical key for bloodshed, otherwise killing people would be too easy and the film would lack suspense, and the gore would feel less earned and deserved. In You’re Next, this convention is very much met. There are no guns to be found, while axes, arrows, knives, nails, and other sharp objects go flying through heads and torsos left and right — what a day to be alive…or not so much.\n\nLighting: To keep suspense high and the mood of the film causing a giant gaping pit in the stomachs’ of the audience, the overall atmosphere of the film must remain dark and gloomy. This motive is achieved through low-key, natural, or practical lighting — primarily at night, which creates a very dark setting. Being that You’re Next took place in a rurally located house and in the woods at night, these conventions were taken into effect, and a Slasher film was born.\n\nCamera Shots: Slasher films typically want most things to be perceived as suspenseful or a complete surprise. With this, many close-ups, point of view shots, and handheld camera movement are used to create more of an impact and immersive experience for the audience. Wide shots are used too, but more so to establish an area, or to create brief moments of suspense, such as the killer peering in through a window, standing behind a tree or across the street — known by the audience, but not to the character in the movie. You’re Next uses these conventions to a “T” and keep the audience immersed with tight framing and perfectly paced suspense and torture.\n\nDifferences and Attempts to Reinvent:\n\nOur Victims: A key difference in You’re Next, compared to typical Slasher Films, is the fact that our victims are a family, and don’t exactly take part in the sins of drinking, drugs, or sex within the film; murder, however, now that may be where the prior be forgotten. Being that Felix and Crispian turn on their family to have them all killed for the inheritance, bring out the sins of murder, anger, and greed, which makes up for the rest.\n\nOur Killer and the History: In most films within the genre, there is one primary killer with a history behind him or her that made them the monster they are today. In You’re Next, however, there are three men working together, two of them brothers, and besides that information, we know nothing else of them. Our killers and the details of their lives are not important to or in this film. Most Slasher films focus on the story of the killer, whereas in You’re Next, we focus on the story of our heroine, Erin, and the family around her.\n\nOur Heroine: Whereas in most Slasher films, our heroine is innocent, somewhat naive, and relatively tender. In You’re Next though, Erin is anything but that. She is a trained survivalist, who never truly seems to be afraid. She seems to have the answer to most things from the very beginning, and never really goes through much of a struggle. She always seems to be a step ahead of the game and is able to kill each man without much resistance. The only injury she ever receives isn’t even from one of the masked men, it’s from her sudden impulse to jump out of a second story window — which she easily gets up from. I understand that adrenaline numbs a bit of pain, but seriously — that’s a superhero-like ability.\n\nHere Comes The Twist:\n\nPersonally, I didn’t see the twist coming. When Crispian left after his mother was murdered, I honestly thought he was going out for help — it wasn’t until the end of the second act that I realized that he was still missing and was wondering where he had gone. After the twist was revealed though, I thought back to the rest of the film and found a lot of things that could have tipped anyone off to the twist at the end of the film, like the following:\n\nWhen Crispian and Erin are on their way up to the vacation home, the two are talking about how his parents are loaded and Crispian comes off as a little uneasy.\n\nAfter Aubrey, Crispian’s mother, hears something upstairs and has Paul, her husband, and Crispian’s father, go to check it out — Paul is just about to look into the closet to find one of the killers, but then Crispian pulls him away just in the nick of time, to greet him. This, I feel, foreshadows the end to when Crispian greets Erin after everyone has been killed.\n\nAs Erin and Crispian are on their way up to the house, Crispian explains that his family is a bit out there. When they all arrive at the home, we realize that his relationship with his mother and father is a bit awkward, that his brother Drake is obviously more liked by his parents, and that he and Drake are a bit hostile towards one another. Also, when his sister, Aimee, arrives, she is the baby of the family, and his parents adore her far more than him. And finally, when Felix arrives, he comes by a little later than everyone else, uninterested, and with his girlfriend, Zee, who is completely passive and rude to both of his parents.\n\nWhen Crispian and Felix greet one another though, all is fine and dandy, and as Zee goes to introduce herself to Erin, she goes on to say — “ I’ve heard a lot about you,” which is a bit off-putting and friendly compared to her previous encounter with Crispian and Felix’s parents.\n\nWhen Aubrey is left alone in the bedroom after Aimee’s throat is slit, she is brutally murdered. After the family hears her piercing scream and runs to discover she is dead, Crispian fleas the scene — never to come back until the very end.\n\nWhen Paul goes upstairs to scope the area again, Felix, Zee, and Erin are the only ones left in the house (so is Drake, but he’s passed out behind the drapes), Felix and Zee go upstairs while they leave Erin to fend for herself in a bit of a tight situation. As Felix and Zee arrive upstairs, Paul has just discovered that the killers have been watching them for some time, and soon after, one of them kills him before the eyes of Felix and Zee, whom just sit back on the sidelines with their buckets of popcorn, and watch it happen — doing nothing about it. It isn’t until afterward, when the killer doesn’t go after the two of them, and Felix says, “ You really had to do that right in front of me,” that it’s only slightly obvious that Felix has a little something to do with the shady events going on, on the day of his parent’s Anniversary. After Drake wakes up and Felix stabs him with seven screwdrivers, though, the answer becomes pretty clear — Felix is probably the bad guy here.\n\nAfter Erin shoves a working blender into Felix’s head and knife into Zee’s, Crispian calls Felix and Erin answers. When he asks Felix if it’s all over, and explains himself — everything else pretty much falls into place.\n\nLet’s Talk About Erin:\n\nWhen we first meet Erin in the car, she and Crispian are on their way up to his parent’s house for their anniversary party. The first words out of her mouth are, “So your parent’s are loaded,” and Crispian nods his head in agreement, I get a slimy vibe from Erin and automatically have mixed feelings towards her. I don’t want to like her.\n\nAfter she and Crispian arrive, she acts completely genuine towards his family and tries her very hardest to be sweet and gain their approval. They’re not entirely into her at all, though, and seem to easily judge her. I don’t know whether to feel bad for her or happy that the family can see right through her.\n\nAs the family marvels at the fact that Tariq has been shot, and has an arrow sticking out of his forehead, Erin is very quick to come up with a solution in order to get the rest of the family in the foyer. From here on out, Crispian’s family is her main concern, and she has quick answers and ideas to every little situation. This fact at first made me feel bad that the family thought the things they did about her, and that she was just really trying to take on the role of a leader, but then I got a little upset about who her character was as the story went on.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, Erin is one hell of a character, and I appreciate how much of a badass the writer and director made her — it’s a beautiful thing for women everywhere, but who she was within the story was just completely unrealistic. The fact that she knew exactly what to do from square one, and that she grew up on a survival compound seemed a bit too convenient for my liking. She had no real signs of a struggle throughout the entire film. She had all of the answers to every possible situation without truly thinking, she killed everyone who stood as a threat almost immediately and left the fight with hardly any damage. The only damage caused was due to her jumping out of a second story window and getting a chunk of glass lodged into her thigh, which was an injury based off of her own “bravery.” This strategic happenstance is obviously pretty cool and all, but she get’s right up after the fall — not even Wonder-Woman can do that and make it seem realistic.\n\nOverall, I like Erin. She is kind and genuine enough, but she is just too convenient of a Heroine to win this battle at the end. If she was specially trained for a situation like this from the very beginning, then there is no mystery in how the story will end. However, this fact was a good distraction from the twist at the end, and it makes sense when Erin tells Zee that she hadn’t told Crispian that she grew up on a survival compound. Still though — I like to see a character that faces struggle and doubt as any human would, and that was hardly visible in Erin throughout You’re Next.\n\nPsychoanalytic Theories and “You’re Next.”:\n\nBased on the Article: “The Final Girl: A Few Thoughts on Feminism and Horror,” several different psychoanalytic theories are touched upon via several female thinkers, but one finding interested me more than others.\n\nThis topic is one of first to be discussed within the article, but I find it to be something I didn’t entirely realize before. The findings of Linda Williams in which jump from Laura Mulvey’s to Carol Clover’s is the idea of the Final Girl being a symbiotic double for both the woman/victim and the monster. Williams compares this to earlier classic horror films where “monsters,” were sympathetic creatures. They were only deemed as monsters because of their abnormal exterior — this idea pertains to figures such as the monster of Frankenstein, King Kong, and the Mummy.\n\nBased off of my own comparison, I find the supposed “monster,” or the thing in which makes her different, within the Final Girl is her lack of conformity, confidence within herself, and her genuine heart. She is different because those around her are tainted in the ways she is not, and she has the determination and will to fight back. I also find this idea as being a symbol for the fate of the Final Girl to be resting in her own hands. Being that she is also the monster in the piece, she is the most powerful, even if she doesn’t use that to her advantage, nor is she probably aware of it. Her being different is her greatest asset, and everyone else’s biggest fear, so if she is able to outsmart the supposed and harmful being, she has outsmarted everyone.\n\nI feel as if this idea is the most relevant to You’re Next because Erin is the epitome of this bi-symbiotic theory. Erin could be deemed as the monster in this film because she is brought into a house of judgment. She is still a student and Crispian’s family feels as if she doesn’t belong in this environment, and that she’s pretty much just a slam piece for their son and brother. She is the victim because she is brought into this house where three men in masks are killing those around her. They supposed harmful beings and/or monsters within the film, and Erin is able to outsmart and defeat them, therefore making superior, as she was able to outsmart the family, the three masked men, and indefinitely, herself.\n\nLink to Article: http://offscreen.com/view/feminism_and_horror\n\nwww.vagabondetvirtuosa.com"
