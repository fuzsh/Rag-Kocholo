        "text": "Summary\n\nMost feature screenplays regardless of genre start in a similar manner. The beginning requires at least one strong scene, a clear definition of the world and what’s important in it, a significant change and we need to be engaged with at least one of the characters (even if it’s the villain). After that, the genre/subgenre preferences really kick in. The audience will now expect a “certain type of story.”\n\nIf horror is a mood—the genre of building dread, dark revelations, shocking revulsions and primal urges—then you’ll need to ask how jumpy, repulsive and primal you want to go and still be appropriate within your subgenre expectations. People don’t watch a ghost movie for the gore. All considered, my classic beats do sit reasonably well against the monster and ghost horror beats, but it’s often an expected “yeah, but it really depends” situation.\n\nEssentially, once you’ve set up to match the subgenre expectations then you can zig-zag a bit—as long as you come back to a strong genre beat every now and again. To demonstrate, let’s take a look at just four aspects that strongly define the “monster horror movie” subgenre:\n\n1. How a subplot is treated in the middle of the movie\n\n2. The size of the world\n\n3. Character goals and relationship with death\n\n4. Pacing\n\nThe question of using the subplot/new location is key in contemporary horror screenwriting. Not having a subplot and staying in one main location means a low page count. In non-horror genres, sustaining one idea in one place for 105 pages while keeping it fresh is insanely difficult. Consequently, popular Hollywood genres simply can't survive without a subplot or at least the ability to change locations—particularly in the second half of the screenplay. Therefore, horror has developed a whole bag of techniques and ghastly tricks to keep you engaged in one place.\n\nFor example, Jaws (1975) has local economics and politics as a backdrop because if you don’t go into the water, there isn’t a problem. However, the 4th of July is tomorrow and we need those happy beach tourist dollars to keep us afloat! Buy some ice cream, take a refreshing dip, you might even see a fish! Is this technically an interconnected subplot? I suppose Amity’s economy is, and it’s the 50th Annual Regatta as well, but in a new location? Not really, but ... enter the panicky mayor to supercharge the shark problem.\n\nMany classic monster movies refuse to use a subplot/new location once the game’s afoot, e.g. Alien (1979), The Thing (1982), Predator (1987) and even Jurassic Park (1993)—it makes little sense to have plot information play out somewhere removed, distant and well away from the main action. Claustrophobia and isolation are key. The radio’s destroyed. Help isn’t coming. In the monster horror movie, the world is and feels… small. I guess that’s why Godzilla is more Hollywood than scary.\n\nThere’s a joke—How do you know if a film is a horror or a thriller?\n\n… marketing.\n\nEven if you follow the genre patterns detailed above, in practice, horror comes down to two approaches:\n\nHow far are you going to break “reality”?\n\nHow far are you going to embrace the darkness? (e.g. death, mental and physical pain, evil, sin, dark sex, lust, menace, sexual frustration/repression, blood, gore and visceral violence, etc.)\n\nThe approaches to these two questions will determine whether it is a horror, a horror-thriller, or a thriller. You must be clear that you have the right starting point. For example, beware of signaling to your audience that this is shaping up to be a haunted house horror in the first 25 minutes and then not break “reality,” so now that “mysterious and sexually dangerous” character (who just turned up at the front door), will make the menace feel more “sexual thriller” than “ghostly terror.” This runs the risk of confusing an audience. Mystery is good but confusion leads to disengagement—which leads to boredom.\n\nTo be general, in most Hollywood genres, every scene has one character within it wanting a form of love (in the broadest sense of the word). This can exist in horror—but many of the dark subgenres favor survival, the exploration of primal urges and understanding of “what the hell is going on” to drive character behavior first. The preferred character goals we have are immediate survival or control, not personal growth. The protagonist may grow or be redeemed—but they have to survive first and don’t think beyond that. Even if you make good decisions, there are no guarantees you will live.\n\nFinally, the positioning of the scares can be even (the modern expectation is a scare every 10 pages and a big one within the first 3–5) or uneven (hypnotic opening, slow build-up, front load all the character relationship tensions and then keep punching hard in the second half). There is general agreement that if you do something truly awful and horrific early enough it keeps the audience on their toes waiting for the next awful moment.\n\nConclusion\n\nTrying to build an overarching story structure for all feature films is really just an experiment to see if you can do it. It becomes a method to teach beginners, but how useful is it really for the specifics of horror?\n\nAs a diagnostic tool, it can highlight missing plot elements that might explain why you are running out of steam on page 65, or why your story feels like it's meandering too much, or it may shine a light on why that big cathartic ending is falling flat. It’s not a checklist of quality, because some of these classic beats can feel right to include in horror, but it can’t prop up a flawed screenworthy premise or a weak antagonist.\n\nWe are now reaching a close to the screenwriting education boom. Many have punched themselves out with intense 20-plus years of screenplay shapes and techniques online, yet not many got into horror and picked the bones of its narrative corpse—chickens!\n\nWhy? I don’t know. Horror is evergreen and has proven itself time and time again at the box office. Along with comedy, it’s a genre that people like to share with a crowd. There are many horror film festivals around the world with devoted fans who still queue around the block for a midnight showing.\n\nThis table will certainly help at the “design stage” of your monster and ghost stories (and maybe other terrifying subgenres). However, once the main beats are baked into the first draft you will have a tough time making fundamental changes to the shape of the story. You will naturally end up using most of these beats and spending hours trying to disguise the hell out of them through redrafting, reinvention, and character behavior. Waiting for the day when the story characters inside your head take over and start writing the script themselves …\n\n… but isn’t that just like a horror screenwriter to pray for some kind of demonic possession to kick in?"
