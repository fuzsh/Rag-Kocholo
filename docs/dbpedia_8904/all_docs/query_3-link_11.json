        "text": "What is horror? How exactly do we define this topic. What decides whether or not we classify something as horror? These questions lay the framework for Noel Carroll discussion in the first chapter of his book, The Philosophy of Horror. What I found it of significant interest in this chapter is that Noel Carroll did not consider the term horror as we understand it in general language to be sufficient for use in what will be his exploration of the genre. As such, he decided to use this first chapter of his book to “rationally reconstruct the latent criteria for identifying horror that are already operative in ordinary language.”’ Accordingly, in order to encompass the meaning of the word horror he offers up two terms, natural-horror and art-horror. I am personally curious how many other people in this class who read the chapter consider, as Carrol did, consider this to be a necessary move.\n\nDifferentiating between the two words, Art-horror is supposed to be an emotion felt in response to a fictional monster that defies our scientific understanding of the world. Natural horror on the other hand is an relation to an event that we might naturally find horrific. It is the kind of horror that one would express in saying “I am horrified by the prospect of ecological disaster” or “ What the Nazis did was horrible.” It does not serve the purpose of crossing art and media as does the term art-horror.\n\nHe goes even further than this though in distinguishing between the terms. Just because actions taken in a movie might cause it to be classified as horror, the movie does not necessarily become art-horror based solely on its medium. He offers the hypothetical example of a person being horrified by the muder in Camus’s the stranger as an example of what might be misunderstood. Just because this movie was generated by art, it is not part of Carrols “phenomenon of art-horror.” It is natural. On the otherhand, in order to be art-horror, it must involve emotion that encapsulates both fear and repulsion in response to the thought of monsters such as Dracula, or the Wolfman.\n\nI found it frustrating in this article how Carrol leaves the term natural horror so ambiguously defined. So far as I could understand what he meant though, natural horror has an apparent lack of either fright or disgust. It does not encompass both. So while as we see in movies, characters have literal physical anxieties concerning touching monsters (The example in which the girl shuddered and kicked as she was surrounded by the cancer as if it was a slug. Revulsion could be seen on her face). Natural horror which frightens or terrifies us does not also disgust us. Consider Carroll’s example of “ Brinkmanship in the age of nuclear arms is horrifying” as natural horror. Who would not be afraid of a nuclear Armageddon The Cold War was a terrifying time for people all around the world. Yet, no one was disgusted by the thought Armageddon as they would be if an animated rotting corpse were to touch them. I mentioned earlier I was curious how many other people felt the use of these two terms as distinct there are in our class. I personally am of the volition that there is some merit in defining art-horror so thoroughly. But am not sure if it validates, generally speaking, this books creation. Why does horror have to both disgust and terrify us? Is fright not enough? These are just opinions though, and opinions are meant to be argued. How does everyone else feel?"
