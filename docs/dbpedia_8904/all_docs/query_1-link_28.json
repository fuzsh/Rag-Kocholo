        "text": "Subgenre of horror fiction\n\nAnalog horror is a subgenre of horror fiction and an offshoot of the found footage film genre,[1][2][3] said to have originated online during the late 2000s and early 2010s with web series such as No Through Road, Local 58, Gemini Home Entertainment, and Marble Hornets.[3][2][4][5]\n\nCharacteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nAnalog horror is commonly characterized by low-fidelity graphics, cryptic messages, little to no traditional jump-scares, and visual styles reminiscent of late 20th-century television and analog recordings.[2][6][7] This is done to match the setting, as analog horror works are typically set somewhere between the 1960s and 1990s, or work with elements from that time period.[2][6] Analog horror is often noted to use visual and audio distortion, as well as glitch-like effects that emphasize and replicate the technological limits the subgenre works with.[8][9] The name \"analog horror\" comes from the genre's aesthetic incorporation of elements related to analog electronics, such as analog television and VHS (Video Home System), the latter being an analog method of recording video and audio.[2][6]\n\nThe genre is also known to show manipulated pre-existing media from the time period it is trying to imitate, as seen in series like The Mandela Catalogue.[2][10] Oftentimes, analog horror works use their formats supposed limitations to their advantage. The effects and graphics of analog horror often intend to let viewers wonder, and subsequently fear, what they are witnessing.[2] Works such as The Backrooms use the limitations of the equipment they're replicating to disguise the use of Blender and Adobe After Effects, making the series appear more visually realistic.[11]\n\nAnalog horror may also be influenced by found footage horror films, such as The Ring (1998) and The Blair Witch Project (1999).[2][12] David Lynch's Inland Empire heavily influenced both No Through Road and Petscop,[13][14] the former of which is a short film from which analog horror originates, and the latter of which is a web series rooted in analog horror.[15]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAnalog horror could be regarded as a form or descendant of creepypasta legends.[16] Many creepypastas anticipated analog horror's themes and presentation: Ben Drowned and NES Godzilla Creepypasta, among others, featured manipulated or contrived footage of \"haunted\" media, and Candle Cove, a creepypasta from 2009, focused on a mysterious television broadcast.[17]\n\nSome commentators have drawn parallels between analog horror and 20th-century radio and television programs that presented fictional stories in the style of \"live news broadcasts,\" such as Orson Welles's 1938 radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds and the shot-on-video TV movies Special Bulletin (1983), Ghostwatch (1992) and Without Warning (1994).[18][19]\n\nThe subgenre is typically cited as originating between the late 2000s and the mid-2010s Internet (mainly with YouTube) videos,[4][2] specifically from Steven Chamberlain's No Through Road in January 2009,[3] and gaining substantial popularity with the release of Kris Straub's Local 58 in October 2015, from which series' slogan (\"ANALOG HORROR AT 476 MHz\") the genre received its name.[2][4] The series, which quickly became successful, would later inspire works such as The Mandela Catalogue and The Walten Files.[2][5] Another YouTube channel, Kraina Grzybów TV, anticipated many main themes of the genre, as in December 2013 it began publishing videos stylized as a TV program from the 1990s that contained disturbing and surreal imagery.\n\nSome analog horror series have been adapted into different forms of media. In 2020, Netflix announced that it would adapt the analog horror podcast Archive 81 into a series of the same name.[7][20] Despite its positive reception, the show was canceled after airing only one season.[21][22]\n\nMarble Hornets had a film set in the same setting release in 2015, which was negatively received.[23][24] A film adaptation for The Backrooms was announced to be in production in 2023, with Kane Parsons set to direct it.[25]\n\nExamples\n\n[edit]\n\nNo Through Road\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: No Through Road\n\nNo Through Road is a YouTube series created by then-seventeen-year-old Steven Chamberlain of Hertfordshire, England, in 2009. Set within the real-world private \"no through road\" at the entrance of Broomhall Farm, it follows four teenagers driving home at night as they find themselves trapped in a space and time loop, eternally passing the same two road signs marking an intersection between Benington and Watton between miles of liminal space countryside, while threatened by a figure who can manipulate the loop back to an archway at the road's entrance.[26] Other plot aspects include all footage of the events being stolen from MI6 and uploaded online to YouTube.[3]\n\nComposed of four shorts,[27] No Through Road has attained a cult following,[13] and is considered a foundational work of the analog horror genre.[3][28][29]\n\nLocal 58\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Local 58\n\nKris Straub's Local 58 is a series of YouTube videos presented as authentic videotaped footage of a television station that has been continuously hijacked over several decades. While there is no main plot in this series, episodes include messages related to looking up at the Moon or the night sky, as well as the in-universe Thought Research Initiative (TRI).[12] Local 58’s first video \"Weather Service\" was published in 2015 as a stand-alone short[30] and then added to the dedicated YouTube channel when it was established in 2017.\n\nLocal 58 is frequently credited with creating and/or popularizing analog horror.[4][31][32][30] Additionally, the series is responsible for naming the genre through its slogan, \"ANALOG HORROR AT 476 MHz\".[12]\n\nCH/SS\n\n[edit]\n\nCH/SS is a YouTube series that was first released in 2016. It was created by an individual known as Turkey Lenin III, a Singaporean user who was 15 at the time of its first upload.[32] The series starts as various uploads from a mental health television service sponsored by the United States government. As it progresses, details and mysteries are slowly revealed of the service's true background with the appearances of a mysterious being constantly disrupting its programs and pursuing its creators. Besides the Youtube videos, the CH/SS lore contains additional content provided through MediaFire download links and an accompanying Twitter account.[32]\n\nArchive 81\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Archive 81 (podcast)\n\nArchive 81 is a horror podcast released in 2016, made by Dan Powell and Marc Sollinger. The podcast is centered around an archivist named Dan, who recently began a job from the Housing Historical Committee of New York, who is told by his boss to constantly record his life.[33] Dan records himself as he listens to and organizes a number of interview tapes, recorded by Melody Pendras and detailing her conversations with residents of an apartment complex.[33][34] It's revealed that these recordings of Dan doing his job are tapes that his friend Marc is now listening to, as Dan has gone missing and Marc seeks to find out what happened to him.[33][35] The podcast was adapted into a Netflix Original series, having released in 2016.[36] The Netflix series was cancelled after one season.[37]\n\nMarble Hornets\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Marble Hornets\n\nMarble Hornets is an alternate reality game YouTube series created in 2009, based on the Slender Man creepypasta.[38] Made by Troy Wagner and Joseph DeLage, the series follows Jay Merrick (Wagner) as he attempts to find out what happened to his friend Alex Kralie (DeLage) during the production of Alex's student film, Marble Hornets.[38][39] Jay watches tapes from the films production, and uploads them to YouTube as various entries showing that Alex was being stalked by an elusive entity known as \"The Operator.\" Aspects of the series that put it in the analog horror subgenre include its use of video tapes, as well as the implementation of a second channel for the series titled \"totheark,\" where cryptic codes and messages are embedded into unconventional video editing.[40] Marble Hornets had a spinoff film released in 2015 called Always Watching: A Marble Hornets Story, with reviewers remarking that the series did not translate well onto the big screen, from both a storytelling and technical standpoint.[41][23][42] The film was negatively received.[24]\n\nGemini Home Entertainment\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Gemini Home Entertainment\n\nGemini Home Entertainment is a horror anthology series by Remy Abode that was initially released in 2019.[12] It centers around the eponymous Gemini Home Entertainment, a fictional distributor of VHS tapes that detail numerous anomalous incidents taking place around the world, including the appearances of various dangerous alien creatures in the United States and an ongoing assault on the Solar System by \"The Iris\", a sentient rogue planet which sent the entities to Earth as part of its efforts to subjugate the planet and humanity. The creature of the \"Woodcrawler\" in the series is heavily inspired by the Native American mythologies of skinwalkers and the wendigo.[43]\n\nEventide Media Center\n\n[edit]\n\nEventide Media Center was a horror anthology series created by Aidan Chick in 2020.[44] The series was framed as being the \"local collection\" of a public library in the fictional town of Eventide Valley, Massachusetts.[45] Each episode focused on a different event or monster that inhabits Eventide Valley or other fictional towns in the state. The series commonly incorporated reveals and dark humor into the endings of its episodes. For example, the episode \"Midnight Movie\"[46] is a recording of the closing credits of a 1950s monster movie produced in Somberville, Massachusetts (a fictionalized version of Somerville) in which nearly the entire cast is listed in an in memoriam segment. The film's title is revealed to be \"Attack of the Somberville Spiders\" and the footage rewinds to the final scene of the movie, showing a camerawoman being attacked by a giant spider. The film then is interrupted by an advertisement for a pest repellent called \"Spider Shield\".\n\nIn 2022,[47] near the beginning of production on the second season, the series was cancelled amid controversy surrounding the ending of the recent episode \"Crimson Creek\",[48] in which an attack on a school by an eldritch abomination is covered up by news outlets as a school shooting, in possible reference to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories. Aidan Chick removed the video on the day of its upload[49] and later privated the rest of the episodes of the series along with his other analog horror series, including Analog Archives and Rocket Records.[50][51]\n\nThe Walten Files\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Walten Files is an animated YouTube series, partially inspired by the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise and analog horror works spawned from it.[52] It was created by Chilean internet personality Martin Walls.[53] It is presented as found footage from the fictional restaurant Bon's Burgers, which featured animatronic entertainment, and produced by the fictitious Bunny Smiles Incorporated.[12] The story focuses on the backstory of the restaurant and its founders, Jack Walten and Felix Kranken, alongside the many mysteries behind its enigmatic closure and the former's disappearance.[5]\n\nThe Mandela Catalogue\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The Mandela Catalogue\n\nThe Mandela Catalogue is a YouTube series created by twenty-year-old Alex Kister[53] of Hubertus, Wisconsin in 2021. It is set in the fictional Mandela County, Wisconsin in the 1990s and 2000s,[54] which is threatened by the presence of \"alternates\", doppelgängers who coerce their victims to kill themselves and can manipulate audiovisual media.[31] Other plot aspects include Lucifer disguising himself as the biblical archangel Gabriel, shown through altered footage of episodes from The Beginners Bible.[55][10] Composed of fourteen shorts,[56] The Mandela Catalogue became popular online through analysis and reaction videos.[57]\n\nThe Smile Tapes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Smile Tapes (stylized as The SMILE Tapes) is an analog horror series created by Patorikku in 2021. The story is set in the mid-1990s in the United States and revolves around a fictitious new drug in circulation on the black market called \"SMILE\". Usage of the drug induces violent behavior in its users and causes them to laugh and smile uncontrollably. As the series progresses, SMILE is revealed to actually be the spores of an extraterrestrial fungus-like organism native to the asteroid belt. The series was inspired by the fungus Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, a fungus species known for infecting and altering the behavior of ants.[2][12]\n\nThe Monument Mythos\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The Monument Mythos\n\nThe Monument Mythos is a YouTube webseries set in different alternate history versions of the United States.[58][59] The premises include James Dean serving as President and Martin Luther King Jr. avoiding his assassination. The episodes are in the found footage and mockumentary format and revolve around American national monuments being depicted in relation to unusual incidents, involving fictional conspiracy theory narratives, such as disappearances of immigrants near the Statue of Liberty and a mysterious infection affecting individuals near Mount Rushmore.[58][53][60][61]\n\nMidwest Angelica\n\n[edit]\n\nMidwest Angelica is a YouTube horror series published in 2022 on the channel Midwest Angelica and made by Team AQ. The story takes place in 1999 when a government organization called H.O.M.E (Heavenly Operation Material Examination), made to research the being codenamed \"AZ-001\", makes contact with AZ-001 when it reaches the Earth's atmosphere.[62][53]\n\nBackrooms\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Backrooms (web series)\n\nIn January 2022, a short horror film titled The Backrooms (Found Footage) was uploaded to YouTube by then-sixteen-year-old Kane Parsons of Northern California, known online as Kane Pixels.[53] It is based on the creepypasta of the same name, using the software Blender and Adobe After Effects,[5][7][63][64] and is presented as a VHS tape recorded by a filmmaker who accidentally enters the Backrooms in the 1990s and is pursued by a monster.[25][65] This was later expanded into a series of sixteen shorts, following the employees of a company investigating the Backrooms.[66] Parsons received a Creator Honors for the series at the 2022 Streamy Awards from The Game Theorists.[67]\n\nAfter receiving positive reviews from critics,[68][69][70] on February 6, 2023, A24 announced that they were working on a film adaptation of the Backrooms based on Parsons' videos, with Parsons set to direct. Roberto Patino is set to write the screenplay, while James Wan, Michael Clear from Atomic Monster, Shawn Levy, Dan Cohen, and Dan Levine of 21 Laps are set to produce.[25][66][71][72]\n\nSkinamarink\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Skinamarink\n\nWritten and directed by Kyle Edward Ball, Skinamarink is a supernatural horror film that first debuted at the 2022 Fantasia Film Festival.[73] It uses experimental techniques to tell the story of two young children, Kevin and Kaylee, as the pair witness the doors and windows of their house disappear.[74] Their parents are missing as well, and the film focuses on the pair struggling to understand the nature of the supernatural entity that has come into their home.[73][75] Using a crowdfunded budget of $15,000, the film conveys its themes of horror with \"unconventional viewpoints and angles\" to best simulate the experience of its child protagonists.[73] With the budget in mind, the movie creators were able to use what they had on hand for lighting and filming at Ball's childhood home, with a majority of the movie being lit by a CRT television.[75] In terms of embodying analog horror traits, the visuals and sound design of the film simulate the quality of VHS tapes. Skinamarink also uses an array of toys from the '90s, the aforementioned CRT television, and older cartoons to work within the analog horror subgenre.[8][75]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nVaporwave\n\nLost media\n\nCollage television\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nWorks cited\n\n[edit]"
