Take a look at our 50 places that may inspire your next creepy tale.

Of course you can use monsters and fantastical characters you have created, but often the best effect is mixing an everyday character with a setting where they belong; for instance a clown hiding inside a car at an empty scrapyard, or a little old lady, bony and bent double, in the middle of the jungle. And remember – these characters can be the good gifs, the bad guys, or maybe a mix of both!\n\nClown\n\nLittle old lady\n\nTroubled teenager\n\nA person with no eyes\n\nPolice officer\n\nNurse\n\nWoman with dramatically applied make-up\n\nLumberjack\n\nWriter\n\nGangster\n\nSex worker or pimp\n\nSomeone with blades for fingers\n\nBaby in a crib\n\nToddler that doesn’t speak\n\nGirl in bedclothes with hair that covers her face\n\nA character that belongs in another time\n\nScarecrow\n\nAnimal that can talk\n\nPerson with wings for arms\n\nA very normal looking mother.

If not, here’s how to take our horror ideas to the next level:\n\nFound a horror story prompt you like but unsure of where to take it next? Let’s take #8 from the top list, for example, and add a few interesting characters from our list and choose a setting or two. Then start to build an information bank on your protagonist from there. At this point focus on the character, not the plot – because often one thing can lead to another.\n\nThe Prompt: You’re a troubled teen who terrifies your family when you wake up floating two metres above your bed. You just moved into an old house in a quiet, creepy suburban street. An exorcist tells your family he has cured you, but the demon doesn’t actually leave your body, and learns to come out only when you are alone.\n\nYou’re still a teenager, living at home. Your name is Jackson, but you go by Jax. You’re a second generation immigrant and you speak Greek at home with your family. Your father named you after his favourite American baseball player. You have dark hair, dark eyes, and when you would steal your grandmother’s baklavas off the kitchen counter she would say she could see the devil in your face. You spend the weekends riding the coastal roads on motorbikes with your friends, doing your best to stay out the way of your spoiled little sister and your overworked father. You’re closest to your YaYa but too afraid to tell her where you spend most of your time. Moving house unsettled you and took away everything you ever loved.\n\nOr, why not map out a rough plot first? The inciting incident for this prompt could be:\n\nYou’ve snuck back into your room after a long night out with your friends. You left the window open. Four hours after you collapsed onto your bed in your clothes, you wake with a start to find yourself hovering inexplicably in the air. Your body is locked into position. You spend a panicked hour trying to wriggle free of its grip, but you can feel another presence inside your own body, forcing you down. You’re going to be late for your new school, your sister is turning the doorknob and your father is yelling for you. Your feet frame the pure terror in the three faces at the door as your eyes strain to see them. Your grandmother recovers the quickest, stuffing her komboskini into your frozen fist and running out of the room to phone her priest.\n\nWhether you start your horror story with just a vibe, a small seed of an idea, a great setting, character, or a full plot – it doesn’t matter. A great story can start anywhere, you just have to make sure that (like any scary monster) you keep feeding it and watch it grow bigger and more horrifying every day!\n\nBy Thea Pelletier\n\nAbout the author\n\nThea is part of the Writer Support Team here at Jericho Writers.
