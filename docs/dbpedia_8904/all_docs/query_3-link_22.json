As a language learner, understanding genre-specific vocabulary is crucial, especially when discussing popular culture. This article will provide key terms, phrases, and context to help you navigate conversations about horror films more fluently.\n\nVocabulary of Horror Subgenres\n\nJust like a painting can have different styles, horror movies are categorized into different subgenres. This list helps to classify and understand the type of horror presented.\n\nSlasher: Movies featuring a killer, often masked, who violently murders their victims.\n\nPsychological Horror: Focuses on the unstable mental states of characters rather than gore.\n\nGothic Horror: These films often revolve around supernatural occurrences, haunting, and dark romanticism.\n\nBody Horror: Horrifying transformations or degenerations of the body are central to this subgenre.\n\nFound Footage: Films shot in a documentary or home-video style to create an illusion of reality.\n\nParanormal Horror: Focuses on paranormal activities and hauntings.\n\nSci-Fi Horror: Combines elements of science fiction and horror, often involving aliens or monstrous creatures.\n\nSurvival Horror: Here, characters are put into a situation where they must survive against horrifying odds.\n\nZombie Horror: Centers on creatures returned from the dead who prey on humans.\n\nComedy Horror: Combines elements of horror with comedy, often parodying typical horror movie tropes.

In horror movies, these are often techniques to induce fear, suspense, or shock.\n\nJump Scare: A sudden, unexpected event designed to frighten the viewer.\n\nCreepy Child: Children portrayed as malevolent or unnerving.\n\nFalse Scare: A scene designed to scare that turns out to be harmless, often preceding a real threat.\n\nFinal Girl: The last character, typically a woman, left alive to confront the killer.\n\nKiller's POV: The point of view of the villain, making the audience indirectly involved in the terror.\n\nIsolation: Characters are cut off from the outside world, amplifying their vulnerability.\n\nHaunted House: A location that is inhabited or influenced by a ghost or other supernatural entity.\n\nUnstoppable Killer: A villain that cannot be killed or stopped, regardless of the characters' efforts.\n\nMistaken Identity: Characters believe the wrong person is the perpetrator.\n\nGory Discretion Shot: The violent act is implied but not directly shown, leaving it to the viewer's imagination.\n\nUnderstanding the tropes used in horror movies can deepen your appreciation of the genre. They are a shared language amongst fans, filmmakers, and critics alike, and recognizing them can enhance both your viewing and discussion of horror films.\n\nVocabulary for Horror Movie Settings\n\nEvery horror movie has a setting that adds to the tension and horror.\n\nHaunted Houses: A house with supernatural entities or occurrences.\n\nForest: Isolated and filled with unseen dangers.\n\nAsylums: Often abandoned and housing past traumas.\n\nBasements: Dimly-lit, confined spaces used for suspense.\n\nGraveyards: Associated with death and the supernatural.\n\nSmall Towns: Often isolated, with many secrets.\n\nIsolated Cabins: Remote and cut-off, creating a sense of isolation.\n\nSchools: Places of familiarity turned uncanny.\n\nSpaceships: Isolation in space where escape is nearly impossible.\n\nDeserted Cities: Emptiness creating a post-apocalyptic feel.\n\nThe setting can be a key element in the fear factor of a horror movie. Identifying and discussing the setting can provide you with more insight and context when talking about a specific film or scene.\n\nTerms of Horror Plot Devices\n\nDifferent mechanisms can take the form of objects, events, or characters, and their choices.\n\nMacGuffin: An object that drives the plot, but its specific nature is unimportant.\n\nRed Herring: A misleading clue meant to divert attention from the real threat.\n\nMirror Scare: A character sees something frightening in a mirror's reflection.\n\nPhone Line Cut: Communication is cut off, increasing isolation and fear.\n\nThe Prophecy: A prediction or forewarning of future events.\n\nDream Sequences: Used to show a character's subconscious fears or foreshadow future events.\n\nMad Scientist: A character whose unorthodox experiments lead to horrific outcomes.\n\nCurse: A negative force placed on a character, driving the plot.\n\nPossession: A character is taken control by a supernatural force.\n\nThe Unexpected Hero: An unlikely character rises to defeat the evil force.\n\nFamiliarizing yourself with these common plot devices can enrich your understanding of how horror narratives are built. It will also provide you with the necessary vocabulary to discuss and critique the structure of horror films.\n\nHorror Movie Plot Structure Terms\n\nMoving from devices that drive the plot to how these plots are organized, plot structure refers to the sequence of events in a story.\n\nLinear: The plot unfolds in a sequential, straightforward manner.\n\nNonlinear: The plot jumps around in time or space, often using flashbacks or foreshadowing.\n\nParallel: Multiple storylines are happening simultaneously.\n\nCyclical: The plot ends where it begins, often showing a character's failure to escape their fate.\n\nRevelation: The plot slowly reveals the horror, building suspense.\n\nMirror: The second half of the plot mirrors the first, often with a twist.\n\nDescent: The plot follows a character's downfall or descent into madness.\n\nJourney and Return: Characters venture out, confront horror, and try to return to their normal life.\n\nIn Media Res: The plot begins in the middle of the action.\n\nRashomon: Different characters provide contradictory accounts of the same event.\n\nUnderstanding the various plot structures used in horror films can not only improve your comprehension of the movies you watch but also provide you with the tools to discuss and analyze the narrative in a more in-depth way.\n\n13\n\nTypes of Horror Movie Characters Vocabulary\n\nAfter exploring plot structures, it’s vital to focus on the individuals who inhabit these plots.
