H. G. Wells (Herbert George Wells) (21 September 1866 â€“ 13 August 1946) was a prolific writer whose work spanned the last quarter of the Victorian Era, through the Edwardian Era and continued until 1939. Wells's main theme was always about humans and their society, even in the earliest days of his writing.

His childhood was impoverished, forcing him to lead a hard-scrabble existence during his formative years. He was also among the first of male feminists having supported the suffragettes in their struggle to acquire voting rights for women and, surprisingly, was a champion of eugenics.

Politically Wells was left of center, being a member of the Fabian Socialists.

The works of a any author tend to be a reflection of the author's beliefs and value judgements and the works of H.G. Wells are no exception. What makes Wells a phenomenon was his ability to project what technology would bring to or upon society. At this he is arguably the single most prescient writer who ever set hand to paper.
