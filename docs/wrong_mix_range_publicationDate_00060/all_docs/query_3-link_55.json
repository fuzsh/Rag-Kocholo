        "text": "Malcolm Gladwell’s books are a must read. This much goes without saying. He has perfected the art of what I would call “analytical storytelling”. A serious topic is taken, a story is laid out, evidence is gathered , experts are consulted and the lessons are presented making a round circle with the original story. So one gets to see bit of everything ; a story, serious research , ethical lessons and a novel relationship between the variables otherwise not known. In nutshell Gladwell answers the “ Why question” but in a distinct and intuitive way. This places him somewhere in the middle of the hardcore researchers and anecdotal generalists. His journalistic background adds to the academic bent of mind and given stellar treatment by the superior art of storytelling. You can never go wrong with a good story.\n\nThe latest book “Talking to Strangers” is also a collection of disparate stories. The story of Chamberlain and Hitler, of spies and double agents, of pedophiles and harassers, of frauds and Ponzi schemers on wall street , of suicidal poets like Sylvia plath and terrorists like Khalid Shaikh Mohammad. All that started with an encounter of a black woman and a white cop in Texas suburbs. The white cop behaves predictably in arresting the woman, and she end up dead few days later, committing suicide. Two strangers who could have just moved on after few minutes, but instead one gets the other all wrong and the other lady takes her life. The smartest politicians of Europe could not get Hitler even after meeting him for ling time and those that did not meet him at all like Churchill got him inside out. The spies could not identify double agents despite having clear signals and the whole campuses and organizations fail to see the obvious pedophiles for years. The police routinely get wrong persons implicated and the best intelligence agencies do not get the obvious signals even when these stared them in the face. Why do people get other people wrong ?\n\nThe most obvious reason is DEFAULTING TO TRUTH. We only believe what we want to believe. We assume truth because truth is convenient , stable and easy. It is not that we believe unconditionally. There are always doubts, some doubts. Doubts are natural and doubts are expected but the doubts are mostly not enough. The distinction between “some doubts” and “enough doubts” is one of the take-aways from the book. The bar of doubts, especially when judging someone you know well is really high. This is why double agents go undetected despite the warning signs and frauds like Bernie Medoff manage to cheat for decades. We have doubts but we shrug them and move on. But this moving on and defaulting to truth is what has world and society stable. If each and every doubt is red flagged, there will be chaos and anarchy. Defaulting to truth is something we have to live with and navigating the doubts has to be managed within the assumption of truth.\n\nDefaulting to truth is not the only issue while talking to strangers. Transparency is the other one. Gladwell gives great example of the TV series FRIENDS, which is my personal favorite too. Now the Friends , and for that matter any good tv series has to be transparent. The characters even if muted convey what they are thinking and feeling. This transparency is what glues people to Tv screens. Real life is different though. Here transparency is not an advantage. Amanda Knox an American tourist in Italy was falsely implicated in murder just because she was too transparent, and careless. The same happens all around us ; in homes, in offices , in classrooms and police stations. People default to truth-but not the real truth, just their own version truth. This transparency in misinterpreted in harassment situations, where strangers assume that just because other person is transparently friendly also means he or she is available. This leads to often disasters situations. Law enforcement assuming transparency is the most dangerous. The so called lie detection is one of the biggest hacks , but a hack believed with confidence. This leaves the strangers at the receiving end disadvantaged and often hurt.\n\nDefaulting to truth and transparency become worse when coupled with the environment. Here comes one of my areas of interest i.e suicide. People commit suicide for all sorts of emotional reasons , depression to heartbreak. There is always a lag between the decision to commit suicide and executing, and available options dictate the outcome. This coupling with the outer world defines how the interactions will take place. If lethal gas is available in the TV room, it will become an opportunity , if golden gate bridge is nearby or there are ready to pop in pills , the probability of suicide will increase manifold. This coupling becomes all the more important in crime and law enforcement. The places are often more crucial than the people. The crime ‘hotspots’ became a rage in eighties and nineties , though we have imported the technique quite late. There were the extra patrol experiment in Kansas City , and the places were marked and circled more and more frequently.\n\nThis brings to the end of story with which the book started. The white cop, who stopped a black woman in a Texas suburb, was not acting randomly. There was a whole system working in the back, The system of defaulting to truth , transparency and coupling perfected over the years. To start with , the ‘stop’ was in that point unnecessary but not in the eyes of cop , who was operating under the experiments conceived and applied over two decades. Gladwell very cleverly answers the “why question” and leaves us with a lesson that nothing just happens randomly and there is always a reason - a system and thought behind the incidents involving the strangers. To better acquaint with strangers and make better use of endless opportunities offered in these interactions, we have to be easy on assumptions and pre-conceived notions. We have to give each other time and space, and we will see the benefits.\n\nHappy Reading."
