        "text": "\"You don't understand,\" he said, \"who I am or what I am. I'll show you. By Heaven! I'll show you.\" Then he put his open palm over his face and withdrew it. The centre of his face became a black cavity. \"Here,\" he said. He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall something which she, staring at his metamorphosed face, accepted automatically. Then, when she saw what it was, she screamed loudly, dropped it, and staggered back. The nose—it was the stranger's nose! pink and shining—rolled on the floor.\n\nThen he removed his spectacles, and everyone in the bar gasped. He took off his hat, and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and bandages. For a moment they resisted him. A flash of horrible anticipation passed through the bar. \"Oh, my Gard!\" said some one. Then off they came.\n\nIt was worse than anything. Mrs. Hall, standing open-mouthed and horror-struck, shrieked at what she saw, and made for the door of the house. Everyone began to move. They were prepared for scars, disfigurements, tangible horrors, but nothing! The bandages and false hair flew across the passage into the bar, making a hobbledehoy jump to avoid them. Everyone tumbled on everyone else down the steps. For the man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation, was a solid gesticulating figure up to the coat-collar of him, and then—nothingness, no visible thing at all!\n\nChapter 7: The Unveiling of the Stranger\n\n\"Why!\" said Huxter, suddenly, \"that's not a man at all. It's just empty clothes. Look! You can see down his collar and the linings of his clothes. I could put my arm—\"\n\nHe extended his hand; it seemed to meet something in mid-air, and he drew it back with a sharp exclamation. \"I wish you'd keep your fingers out of my eye,\" said the aerial voice, in a tone of savage expostulation. \"The fact is, I'm all here: head, hands, legs, and all the rest of it, but it happens I'm invisible. It's a confounded nuisance, but I am. That's no reason why I should be poked to pieces by every stupid bumpkin in Iping, is it?\"\n\nChapter 7: The Unveiling of the Stranger\n\n\"Pull yourself together,\" said the Voice, \"for you have to do the job I've chosen for you.\"\n\nMr. Marvel blew out his cheeks, and his eyes were round.\n\n\"I've chosen you,\" said the Voice. \"You are the only man except some of those fools down there, who knows there is such a thing as an invisible man. You have to be my helper. Help me—and I will do great things for you. An invisible man is a man of power.\"\n\nChapter 9: Mr. Thomas Marvel\n\nI remember that night. It was late at night—in the daytime one was bothered with the gaping, silly students—and I worked then sometimes till dawn. It came suddenly, splendid and complete in my mind. I was alone; the laboratory was still, with the tall lights burning brightly and silently. In all my great moments I have been alone. 'One could make an animal—a tissue—transparent! One could make it invisible! All except the pigments—I could be invisible!' I said, suddenly realising what it meant to be an albino with such knowledge. It was overwhelming. I left the filtering I was doing, and went and stared out of the great window at the stars. 'I could be invisible!' I repeated.\n\nTo do such a thing would be to transcend magic. And I beheld, unclouded by doubt, a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might mean to a man—the mystery, the power, the freedom. Drawbacks I saw none.\n\nChapter 19: Certain First Principles\n\n\"By Heaven, Kemp, you don't know what rage is! To have worked for years, to have planned and plotted, and then to get some fumbling purblind idiot messing across your course! Every conceivable sort of silly creature that has ever been created has been sent to cross me.\n\n\"If I have much more of it, I shall go wild—I shall start mowing 'em.\n\n\"As it is, they’ve made things a thousand times more difficult.\"\n\n\"No doubt it’s exasperating,\" said Kemp, dryly.\n\nChapter 23: In Drury Lane"
