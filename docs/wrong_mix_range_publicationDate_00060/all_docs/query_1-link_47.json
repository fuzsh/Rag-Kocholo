With science fiction we can discover far off alien planets with Captain Kirk on the U.S.S. Enterprise, time travel with H.G. Wells, or create an immortal man—or monster—like in Mary Shelley’s 18th century tale.\n\nAuthors around the globe have mined real-world events and culture to create some of the most well-loved sci-fi, often providing a critical look at the news and beliefs of their time while crafting visions of what any number of alternate futures there could be.\n\nNowadays, we see science fiction all around us in books, our favorite television series, and on the big screen in blockbuster movies.

Asimov was also the first person to coin the word robotics!\n\nLearn about the history of science fiction, explore works by some of the genre’s greatest visionaries, and get inspired by the real world science behind some of our favorite sci-fi concepts below. Then, give science fiction writing a try for yourself with classroom-ready lesson plans and activities.\n\nJump to article sections:\n\nThe Art & History of Science Fiction\n\nLiterary Visionaries & Trailblazers\n\nScience Fiction… in the Real World!\n\nActivities & Lesson Plans"
