        "text": "H. G. Wells (Herbert George Wells) (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) was a prolific writer whose work spanned the last quarter of the Victorian Era, through the Edwardian Era and continued until 1939. Wells's main theme was always about humans and their society, even in the earliest days of his writing.\n\nHis childhood was impoverished, forcing him to lead a hard-scrabble existence during his formative years. He was also among the first of male feminists having supported the suffragettes in their struggle to acquire voting rights for women and, surprisingly, was a champion of eugenics.\n\nPolitically Wells was left of center, being a member of the Fabian Socialists.\n\nThe works of a any author tend to be a reflection of the author's beliefs and value judgements and the works of H.G. Wells are no exception. What makes Wells a phenomenon was his ability to project what technology would bring to or upon society. At this he is arguably the single most prescient writer who ever set hand to paper.\n\nNovels Published during the Victorian Era[]\n\nWells wrote seven science fiction novels and two anthologies of science fiction short stories during the Victorian Era: The Chronic Argonauts published in 1888 while Wells was still in school. The Time Machine published in 1895. Was actually a re-writing of The Chronic Argonauts. The Stolen Bacillus and Other Incidents an anthology published in 1895. The Island of Doctor Moreau published in 1896. The Invisible Man published in 1897. The War of the Worlds published in 1898 and formed the basis for one very infamous radio show put on by Orson Welles in San Antonio, Texas. Later used as the basis for several movies.\n\nWhen the Sleeper Wakes published in 1899.\n\nTales of Space and Time, an anthology published in 1899 The First Men in the Moon published in 1901.\n\nNovels and Other Works Published during the Edwardian Era[]\n\nThe Food of the Gods and How it Came to Earth, published in 1902. The Discovery of the Future, a book of non-fiction predictions published in 1902. The Sea Lady, a novel length story about a mermaid and the public's reaction to her. Published in 1902. The Land Ironclads, published in 1903. The innovation everyone wants to point to in this story is the advent of armoured tanks, used to end trench warfare, but there are other, more significant developments described in this story. Mankind in the Making a book of predictions written for the Fabian Society published in 1903. Twelve Stories and a Dream, an anthology of thirteen stories including The New Accelerator the basis for a Star Trek episode. Published in 1903. The Food of the Gods published in 1904. A Modern Utopia, speculation on what a perfect society would be like. Published in 1905 In the Days of the Comet, published in 1906. The Future in America; A Search After Realities, published in 1906. The War in the Air, published in 1908. First and Last Things; A Confession of Faith and Rule of Life, published in 1908, this was the personal philosophy of Wells. Tono-bungay was published in 1909 and is not really science fiction unless sociology is counted as a science. Anne Veronica published in 1909 was Wells's support for the liberation of women. The Sleeper Awakes, published in 1910 is a re-writing of When the Sleeper Wakes published in 1899. The New Machiavelli published in 1910 is Wells's idea of an autobiography. The Country of the Blind, and other Stories an anthology of thirty-three stories published in 1911, some of them had been published before. The Door in the Wall and Other Stories, an anthology of eight stories published in 1911.\n\nThe World Set Free a novel about atomic power published in 1914. The Research Magnificent a novel about a main character who is much like that of Don Quixote created by Miguel de Cervantes. Published in 1915. What is Coming? A European Forecast written by H.G. Wells and published in 1915.\n\nFull Bibliography[]\n\nThe above is just the works of Science Fiction written by Herbert George Wells. A full bibliography may be found here, at The H.G. Wells Society web site.\n\nMedia Featuring H. G. Wells[]"
