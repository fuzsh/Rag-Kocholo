Neuware -Now a Major Motion Picture starring Andrew Scott, Paul Mescal, Claire Foy, and Jamie Bell.A man is drawn back to his childhood home and discovers his parents living just as they were on the day they died thirty years before.Screenwriter Harada is disconnected from the world. Lonely and jaded, he's drifted apart from his son and is dismissive when approached with gestures of friendship, including from a lonely and mysterious tenant who lives in his mostly empty apartment building.One night, when Harada returns to the dilapidated downtown district of Tokyo where he grew up, he meets a man who looks exactly like his long-dead father. And so begins Harada's ordeal, thrust into a reality where his parents appear to be alive at the exact age they had been when they died many years earlier. Deeply felt, searching, and profound, All of Us Strangers is a beautiful meditation on loss and the connection between familial love and romantic love. 201 pp. Englisch.\n\nSoft cover. Condition: Fine. 1st Edition. First American edition as stated published in 2003 in NYC no dust-jacket as issued . Book looks unopened and new with only a very light sunned spine a very tiny worn top corner.
