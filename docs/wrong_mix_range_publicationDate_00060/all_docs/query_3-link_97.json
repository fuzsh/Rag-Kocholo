        "text": "Book Feature - Strangers We Know by Elle Marr\n\nHBL Note: Elle Marr is back with another twisty and tense plot! You might remember I featured her previous novel, Lies We Bury, last year. If you enjoyed that one, you’ll be sure to enjoy STRANGERS WE KNOW by this #1 Amazon Charts bestselling author. What would you do if you found out, through a DNA test, that you are related to a serial killer still at large? Elle Marr explores that very question through her protagonist Ivy Hon who was adopted in her infancy and turns to DNA testing when she diagnosed with a mysterious illness. Scroll down to read more.\n\nFrom the publisher:\n\nAdopted when she was only days old, Ivy Hon knows little about her lineage. But when she’s stricken with a mystery illness, the results of a genetic test to identify the cause attract the FBI. According to Ivy’s DNA, she’s related to the Full Moon Killer, who has terrorized the Pacific Northwest for decades. Ivy is the FBI’s hope to stop the enigmatic predator from killing again.\n\nWhen an online search connects Ivy with her younger cousin, she heads to rural Rock Island, Washington, to meet the woman. Motivated by a secret desire to unmask a murderous relative, Ivy reaches out to what’s left of a family of strangers.\n\nDiscovering her mother’s tragic fate and her father’s disappearance is just the beginning. As Ivy ventures into a serial killer’s home territory, she realizes that she may be the next victim of poisonous blood ties."
