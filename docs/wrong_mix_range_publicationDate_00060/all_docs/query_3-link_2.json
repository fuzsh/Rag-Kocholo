Coming home can be murder...\n\nWhen Cole Harper gets a mysterious message from an old friend begging him to come home, he has no idea what he's getting into. Compelled to return to Wounded Sky First Nation, Cole finds his community in chaos: a series of shocking murders, a mysterious illness ravaging the residents, and reemerging questions about Cole’s role in the tragedy that drove him away 10 years ago. With the aid of an unhelpful spirit, a disfigured ghost, and his two oldest friends, Cole tries to figure out his purpose, and unravel the mysteries he left behind a decade ago. Will he find the answers in time to save his community?\n\nReviews\n\nSelected for the Best Books of 2017\n\nAmerican Indians in Children's Literature (AICL)\n\nThis first volume in a projected trilogy is a mash-up of sorts—thriller, superhero origin story, old-fashioned science fiction, and YA coming-of-age. Its Indigenous imagery and cultural references bring these genres and their conventions into an invigorating context, often with refreshing ironic humor and always with ample reference to pop culture. ..the story’s tantalizing mystery pulls readers on.\n\nDeirdre F. Baker, The Horn Book Magazine\n\n[T]he indigenous Canadian viewpoint gives insights into First Nations life and a truly original superhero for the beginning of this new series.\n\nRecommended.\n\nTara J. Williams, School Library Connection\n\nThe tone deftly oscillates between moodiness and humor, capturing the angst of the tale’s teens without becoming self-serious. Though this is very much an archetypal story, the blend of Native American fantasy elements and a noirish Canadian setting make this a memorable addition to the genre.\n\nA promising first episode of a new series with a striking hero and a coyote spirit.\n\nKirkus Reviews\n\nIndigenous and non-indigenous readers will enjoy the setting of Wounded Sky, the character of Cole and the other Indigenous characters in the book. There are murders and mysteries which are never completely solved, a hint of romance which is never entirely fulfilled, and the supernatural plays a large role in the plot. Something for everyone – and many readers will anticipate the next book in the series.\n\nAnn Ketcheson, CM Association\n\nWith fierce pace and terrific style, Robertson's novel Strangers pulls a reader straight into a world of intrigue, murder and revenge. ..The humour and crackling dialogue keep even the most terrifying plot twists artful, and the novel is a fantastic entry into The Reckoner trilogy. I can't wait for the next book in this series…\n\nAlice Kuipers, author of Me (and) Me\n\nThough the singularity of superpowers adds flair and excitement for readers, Robertson’s spirited trilogy is ultimately rooted in a sense of community nurtured by compassion, hard work and a little bit of mischief.\n\nNyala Ali, Winnipeg Free Press"
