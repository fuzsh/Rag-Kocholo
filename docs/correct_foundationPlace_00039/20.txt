The Burlington Library Foundation is organized as a not-for-profit (501(c)3) organization to secure contributions necessary to provide exemplary service to patrons and our community through modern and accessible facilities and comprehensive collections and programming opportunities.

Funds raised by the Foundation supplement funds provided by the City of Burlington, Racine and Walworth Counties, and allow the library to extend its mission and plan for future growth.
