Jennifer was excited to take on this role of helping parents in the PWS community to work collaboratively with school professionals and parents to create positive, effective learning environments for children with PWS across the country. Jennifer is a graduate of the WSEAT program.\n\nPerry A. Zirkel has written more than 1,500 publications on various aspects of school law, with an emphasis on legal issues in special education.
