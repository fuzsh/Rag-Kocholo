        "text": "Foundation Push Pier Installation in Vermont and New Hampshire\n\nAt Northern Basement Systems, we recommend foundation push piers to stabilize foundations that are settling or sinking and showing symptoms such as cracked foundation walls, tilting chimneys, and jamming doors and windows.\n\nOur patented system provides effective and permanent repairs for damaged foundations, ensuring that you have a safe, stable home. Give us a call today at 1-802-696-0106 or click below to get a free estimate on foundation repair! We offer free estimates in Burlington, Concord, Keene and the nearby areas.\n\nWhat are push piers?\n\nPush piers are made with heavy duty steel and are connected to your foundation by a steel foundation bracket.\n\nThe piers are driven deep below your home in sections until the piers reach strong supporting soils. Steel brackets connect piers to the foundation, effectively transferring the weight of the structure to the deeper load-bearing soil.\n\nAdvantages of our system\n\nInstalling our foundation push pier system\n\nThe Supportworks Push Pier System permanently stabilizes foundations that are damaged by settlement. Our warrantied solution can be installed on your foundation in four simple steps:\n\nWhy our push piers are the best\n\nThe reinforced push pier system we use at Northern Basement Systems provides extra support to ensure stability.\n\nThe Supportworks push pier system is engineered to handle the heaviest structural loads. As the weight bears down on the foundation bracket, the bracket exerts great pressure on the pier directly beneath the bracket.\n\nThis is the most critical point of stress on a foundation push pier system, where extra strength in the pier helps the most. Our push pier system includes a steel sleeve that extends from the bottom of the bracket, reinforcing the pier at this critical point.\n\nThe external sleeve strengthens piers during installation as well, which prevents the kinking, buckling, and rotating that is commonly seen during the installation of other push pier systems.\n\nA Word of Warning:\n\nBeware of contractors who tout the strength and capacity of their system's bracket. The foundation bracket is only one piece of the puzzle!\n\nBecause push piers are installed adjacent to a foundation footing and not directly underneath, the weight instead bears directly down on the bracket, and the pressure is then transferred down to the pier itself. Engineers refer to this effect as eccentricity.\n\nBecause of this eccentricity, all pier systems see the greatest level of bending stress directly below the bottom of the foundation bracket. Installing a steel sleeve on the pier directly below the bracket is a cost-effective way to effectively strengthen your entire pier system.\n\nPush Pier Installers In Vermont and New Hampshire\n\nAs an trusted Supportworks member, we offer professional installations of push pier systems for structures that are experiencing damage from settlement or sinking.\n\nWe provide free, written push pier installation quotes.
