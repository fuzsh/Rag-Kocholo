Many manufactured home parks and residents have been adversely impacted by the COVID pandemic. Through 3 distinct program areas, MHIR offers assistance to income-eligible mobile home parks and current and prospective mobile home owners. These programs include:\n\nPark Improvements for Small-Scale Capital Infill to assist park owners with small-scale capital needs to infill vacant lots and cover associated expenses up to $20,000 per lot.\n\nHome Repair Awards assist homeowners with covering the costs of repairing existing homes to prevent displacement.\n\nManufactured Home Foundation Awardscan help prospective and current homeowners to pay for a foundation and related expenses in preparation for siting a home, up to $15,000.\n\n*Note that under Vermont law, the terms mobile home and manufactured home are used interchangeably. For this program, we will use the term manufactured home.\n\nCommunity Small-Scale Capital Infill\n\nPark Improvements through Small-Scale Capital Infill are available to owners of mobile home parks in Vermont (also known as manufactured home communities) to infill vacant or abandoned lots within the park. Park and owner must be registered in the Registry of Vermont Mobile Home Parks to be eligible for the program. Owners can be awarded up to $20,000 per lot. However, parks applying to infill more than 2 lots will require an additional review process, with a maximum of 10 lots per park."
