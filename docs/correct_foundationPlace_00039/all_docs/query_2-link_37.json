        "text": "​​​The Halton District School Board has the responsibility, under the Education Act, to provide a safe and secure working and learning environment for students and employees.\n\nThe Board is in a position of trust with regard to students and must strive to protect their intellectual, physical, mental, and emotional well-being. The Halton District School Board will not employ or continue to employ persons who have criminal records and/or patterns of behaviour that may place students at risk.\n\nNew Employees\n\nAll offers of employment with the Board are conditional upon the applicant supplying an acceptable Criminal Record Check with Vulnerable Sector Screening. ​A ​Criminal Record Check is a document concerning an individual:\n\nthat was prepared by a police force or service from the national data on the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) database within six (6) months before the date the Board collects the document; and\n\nthat contains information concerning the individual’s Personal Criminal History information on criminal offences of which the individual has been convicted under the Criminal Records Act (Canada) and for which a pardon under Section 4.1 of the Criminal Records Act (Canada) has not been issued or granted to the individual.\n\nReturning Employees\n\nIf an individual terminates their employment with the Board and is then rehired within one (1) year of their original termination, the Human Resources Department will request completion of an Offence Declaration upon the date of rehire. If the date of rehire occurs beyond one (1) year from the date of termination, the Board requires the employee to submit an acceptable Criminal Record Check.\n\nAdditional Resources"
