The priority deadline to complete this application was 5/1/2024, and we have awarded our scholarships to students who applied by May 1st. We will still take applications but we are now placing new applications on a waitlist. If funds become available, we will notify you by mail if you are awarded a scholarship. If you donâ€™t have other financial aid that is enough to cover your balance, you will need to be prepared to pay out of pocket by the Fall 2024 payment deadline: Thurs. August 1st by 5 pm.\n\nApplication & Scholarship Information:\n\nThese scholarships are provided through the generosity of private donors or organizations in our community who support our students and programs. Some scholarship donors stipulate that preference be given to students meeting certain criteria, so please complete all fields of the application so that we can explore all avenues of scholarship funding for you.\n\nPriority Deadline: Submit this application by May 1, 2024 to increase your chance of receiving scholarship funds for the 2024-2025 school year. (We will accept applications after May 1, 2024 & place on a waitlist).\n\nFor students who apply by the May 1st priority deadline, decisions for fall are typically made before the end of July (in time for the fall payment deadline). Applications received after the May 1st priority deadline may not be reviewed until after the semester begins so those students will need to be prepared to pay their costs out of pocket.\n\nEnrollment in at least 3 credit hours, and a GPA of 2.0 or higher (on a 4.0 scale) is required for scholarship consideration unless otherwise specified.\n\nFoundation scholarships are divided equally into the Fall and Spring semesters, and you must remain registered each semester in order to receive the semester award, along with maintaining at least a 2.0 GPA, unless otherwise specified.\n\nPreference may be given to students not receiving any other forms of financial aid (such as the Pell Grant or NC Scholarship)."
