With our free mobile app, you can securely access your account information 24/7 from anywhere using your mobile device.\n\nThe Northwest Community Bank Foundation was funded and organized on January 1, 2022 by Northwest Community Bank and its Divisions, Collinsville Bank and Litchfield Bancorp, as a separate non-profit entity. The Foundation extends the Bank’s contributions to non-profit agencies and organizations working to address the needs of the communities the bank serves.\n\nIn its 2023, The Northwest Community Bank Foundation, Inc. awarded $302,100 to 83 non-profit organizations. Foundation President Paul McLaughlin, Jr., states that, “We were very pleased with the response and our opportunity to support area non-profit organizations. In addition to our traditional Corporate Giving Program, the Foundation is another way the bank achieves our fundamental goal: to serve the communities where we live and work. We look forward to continuing to give support in 2024.”\n\nThe Northwest Community Bank Foundation proudly hosted our second annual GALA Event at KidsPlay Museum in Torrington, CT. We were honored to be joined by many of the non-profits who received grants. In all, 83 organizations received over $300,000 in 2023. These non-profit organizations provide much needed support in so many ways, helping families in need, offsetting food insecurity, providing behavioral health services, supporting individuals with disabilities, assisting with land preservation, and funding afterschool activities. Together, we’re making a positive impact in our community!\n\nIn 2022, Northwest Community Bank Foundation awarded a total of $50,000 to Northwest CT YMCA for its sports field in Torrington. From left to right, Foundation Vice President Paul McLaughlin; Northwest Y Chief Executive Officer Greg Brisco; Foundation Chair of the Board Alan Colavecchio; and Foundation President Stephen Reilly.\n\nOur basic human services grants support organizations that meet the immediate needs of individuals and families while also supporting prevention and long-term solutions for people living in difficult economic circumstances.

Extenuating circumstances may be considered.\n\nGrants will be reviewed by the Foundation’s Board of Directors in an impartial manner based upon an evaluation of each grant request. Some key elements examined in our grant evaluation process include an organizations’ financial sustainability, leadership, impact and collaboration within the community.\n\n2024 Phase I: Application Available February 15th Due March 15th Notification May 15th 2024 Phase II: Application Available August 15th Due September 15th Notification November 15th\n\nAlthough there are many worthy endeavors, the Foundation generally does not invest in the causes listed below.
