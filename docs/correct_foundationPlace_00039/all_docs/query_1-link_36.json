After visiting a mountain for the first time through Chill’s snowboard program, Jona got involved with Chill as a skate mentor and eventually started a job as an instructor at Talent skatepark. Jona has found his passion is skateboarding and has made a name for himself in the Burlington Skate Community. \n\nSince graduating from high school, he is now a first-year student at Champlain College studying graphic design. He still works as a skate instructor at Talent, where he helps teach Chill youth how to skate.\n\nWatch the video to hear more of Jona’s story and donate today at the link in our bio to give more young people the gift of boardsports this holiday season!\n\nEvery donation, up to $200K before December 31, 2023, will be matched by Chill partners Rally 2\nGive and BOA - so your gift will have twice the impact!\n\n#ChillFoundation #DiversifyOutdoors\".",
