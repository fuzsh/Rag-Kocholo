        "text": "Cambridge, Mass. (June 16, 2010) – Twelve media innovation projects have been named the 2010 winners of the Knight News Challenge, a contest that funds ideas that use digital technology to inform specific geographic communities.\n\nThe winners will receive $2.74 million as part of the fourth round of the five-year international contest.\n\nAmong the winning ideas are two easy-to-use tool sets for journalists and bloggers to illustrate raw data visually – one of the most promising new areas of digital journalism. One project (Tilemapping) was field-tested in Haiti, to map where aid was needed after the earthquake.\n\n“The free flow of shared information is essential for communities to function in a democracy. More each day, that information flows through and because of digital technology,” said Alberto Ibargüen, president of Knight Foundation. “Until someone figures out the next big thing – the next killer app that might provide blockbuster connectivity and information sharing to masses of people – we can use the Knight News Challenge to experiment with ways to learn how to think in different ways about information sharing so we might discover the future of news.”\n\nOther winning projects include experiments to:\n\nFind new ways to fund journalism – including tools to create “real time ads” that display a business’ latest Twitter or Facebook update. Another, building on 2008 challenge winner Spot.Us, provides a place for the public to pitch and pay for stories on public radio;\n\nEngage readers in new ways – with a mobile application that enables residents to geo-tag ideas for improving their neighborhood, and via local wikis, based on a successful California site where residents exchange local knowledge and news.\n\nA full list is attached.\n\nNearly half of this year’s winners are private enterprises, up from 15 percent in 2009. Businesses are finding more ways to build on open source software, a requirement of the Challenge.\n\nKnight Foundation announced the winners at the Future of News and Civic Media conference at MIT, where Challenge winners past and present gather to exchange ideas and collaborate.\n\nOver the Challenge’s four years, Knight Foundation has reviewed 10,000 applications and funded 50 projects for $23 million.\n\nAlready, past projects have been adopted by other media organizations and are having an impact:\n\nHnews, which allows readers to see the source of information in online articles, is being tested by the Associated Press and 250 newspapers.\n\nDocumentCloud, which allows reporters to share source documents, is being used by ProPublica, the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.\n\nSpot.us, the community-funded reporting site, has had stories published in the Oakland Tribune and the New York Times and has expanded to Los Angeles.\n\n“The future of news is being advanced every day by Knight News Challenge winners, who are bringing critical information to communities in new ways,” said Jose Zamora, Knight Foundation journalism program associate.\n\nFor more information about the contest and the winning projects visit www.newschallenge.org.\n\nAbout the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation\n\nThe John S. and James L. Knight Foundation advances journalism in the digital age and invests in the vitality of communities where the Knight brothers owned newspapers. Knight Foundation focuses on projects that promote informed and engaged communities and lead to transformational change.

The dynamic interfaces will be appropriate to each data type, starting with crime and working through 311 calls for service, among others. The creators will use high design standards, making the visuals beautiful as well as useful.\n\nBio: Eric Rodenbeck is the founder and creative director of Stamen, a leading mapping and data visualization design studio based in San Francisco. Recent Stamen projects for the London 2012 Olympics, MSNBC and the City of San Francisco push the boundaries of online cartography and design.

Rodenbeck led the interactive storytelling and data-driven narrative effort at Quokka Sports, illustrated and designed at Wired magazine and Wired Books, and was a co-founder of the design collective Umwow. His work is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. Rodenbeck received a bachelor’s in the history and philosophy of technology from The New School for Social Research in 1994.

The simplified tools will be created with busy journalists and editors in mind, people who have the pulse of their community but don’t have a background in game development. By answering a series of questions about the major actors in a news event and making value judgments about their actions, The Cartoonist will automatically propose game rules and images. The games aim to help the sites draw readers and inspire them to explore the news.\n\nBio: Ian Bogost, a videogame designer, critic and researcher, is associate professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and founding partner at Persuasive Games.

Challenge winner Brad Flora helped pioneer the idea on his Chicago news site, WindyCitizen.com.\n\nBio: Brad Flora is a journalist and entrepreneur in Chicago. He is the founder and president of WindyCitizen.com, which gives Chicagoans a place to share, rate and discuss their favorite local stories, events and deals.
