We serve children who demonstrate a desire to learn music, as well as teachers who have students willing to learn.\n\nIn 30 years, we’ve delivered more than 22,000 instruments to children in all 50 states and 35 countries.\n\nWe believe that by sharing instruments and musical experiences, children who would not otherwise have the opportunity can experience a kind of freedom and self-discovery that is often stifled in an atmosphere of economic hardship.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nWe invite you to watch the video and see the transformative power of the gift of a musical instrument. We ask people and organizations to donate musical instruments to our tax-exempt organization and then we match the donated instruments with the countless requests we receive. See the miracle of music in action, transforming young hungry souls into inspired musicians.\n\nWho We Do It For\n\nWe support music teachers, program directors, social workers, and school counselors who have students unable to participate because of the cost.\n\nWe support established, innovative community music programs that need support.\n\nWe have served more than 22,000 children in the past 30 years.\n\nGood News!\n\nIf you would like to get a more in-depth insight into our mission, please check out our newsletter archive and see what we’ve been doing!\n\nNumber of Instruments Distributed in 2023:\n\n2,172\n\nDownload Our 20-Year Retrospective\n\nIn 2024, we celebrate our 30th year of providing the gift of music to underserved children with a hunger to play.\n\nLooking Back...\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\nNPR Interview\n\nCheck out an NPR interview with Hungry for Music Executive Director Jeff Campbell. It was aired on NPR’s Morning Edition, hosted by Noel King, on October 19, 2020.
