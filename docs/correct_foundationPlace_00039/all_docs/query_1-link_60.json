The Postsecondary Readiness Reports include information on enrollment in colleges and universities, remedial course-taking rates, and postsecondary retention and completion rates for students who graduated from public high schools in Iowa. These rates are available statewide, by Iowa high school and by student group. Statewide data on participation in registered apprenticeships is also available with future plans to integrate school-level data on registered apprenticeship into the existing reports."
