        "text": "Most scholarship funds offer varying award amounts, which range from $350 to several thousand dollars, depending on the size of the particular fund, the number of qualified applicants and the intent of the fund's donor(s). If the amount of the award is known, it will be listed in the Scholarship Directory.\n\nEach scholarship fund has specific eligibility criteria defined by the donor. Please read through the Scholarship Directory to see if you qualify for a scholarship. However, general criteria that apply to most scholarships include: Being a resident of or attending a high school in Bristol, Burlington, Plainville, Plymouth, Southington or Wolcott; demonstrating financial need; demonstrating community service; and attending an accredited two- or four-year college or university or enrollment in a career training program.\n\nThe majority of our scholarships require you to be a resident of Bristol, Burlington, Plainville, Plymouth, Southington or Wolcott, Connecticut or require that you are attending a high school in one of those towns. However, there are a few scholarships that do not, so please read the eligibility criteria carefully before applying.\n\nThe majority of scholarships require that you be a graduating high school senior; however, there are numerous scholarships that are open to students who reside in or attended a high school in Bristol, Burlington, Plainville, Plymouth, Southington or Wolcott, Connecticut. As always, please read the eligibility criteria carefully before applying.\n\nNo; however, by far the majority do. Be sure to read through the criteria outlined in the Scholarship Directory to see if the scholarship you want to apply for requires a different application or has any other special instructions.\n\nAdditional instructions and requirements are listed on the application, but the following are required in order for the application to be deemed complete:\n\n- Electronic signature, including the electronic signature of a parent/guardian if under the age of 18\n\n- All required questions to be answered, including the upload of letters of recommendation and the completion of the essays\n\n- One (1) copy of transcript\n\n- One (1) copy of FAFSA Student Aid Report (SAR)\n\nYou will need to prepare the following support materials to send in with your scholarship application:\n\n- Copy of your full FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS), which you receive when you complete the FAFSA (www.fafsa.ed.gov).\n\n- Current transcript/report card.\n\n- Two letters of recommendation (required for most funds; must be blinded).\n\n- Essay (required for most funds; each fund has its own unique essay).\n\nIf each scholarship that you are applying for requires that you use the online application, you will fill out the Common Application form and then answer supplemental questions specific to each scholarship (essays, letters or recommendation, etc.). You will only need to fill out the basic information (personal, financial, community activities, education information, etc.) once.\n\nYour financial information will never be shared with anyone other than the foundation staff member who processes the application. This information will not be seen by the scholarship reviewers.\n\nNot all scholarships consider financial need when evaluating applicants, some focus on other things, such as community service, school involvement or your intended field of study. Additionally, scholarships give a varying degree of weight to financial need. For example, financial need is 50 percent of the total score for some scholarships, but only 5 percent of the total score for others. Furthermore, other factors help determine financial need, including the number of people living in your home, the cost of the college and any unexpected financial hardships your family has faced in the last few years.\n\nMain Street Community Foundation utilizes a blind review process to ensure not only confidentiality but also fairness. Other than on the cover page and your transcript, you cannot put any identifying information, including your name, your parents’ names, your siblings’ names or your address.\n\nNo; however, if your school or recommender requires that your transcripts or letters of recommendation be sent individually, those can be submitted separate from your full application until the application deadline. In addition, if you do recognize that an error has been made, contact the Foundation's office and we will work with you to correct it.\n\nYes. You must create an account to save and submit an application. An account allows you to access your application, and all required documentation, and it allows us to send you notifications. Please consider using an email address that you will have for the entirety of your college career, so you can fill out the appropriate forms and apply for scholarships in future years.\n\nIf you are a first-time applicant with Main Street Community Foundation:\n\n- Go to the Online Scholarship Portal.\n\n- Click \"Create New Account\".\n\n- Enter the required information.\n\n- Login using the email address and password you just created.\n\n- Select the application/cycle you want to apply to.\n\n- Begin your application.\n\nIf you have an account, but have lost or forgotten your password click on the Forgot Password button below the sign in screen. A link to reset your password will be emailed to you.\n\nYou can save your work by hitting the save icon at the bottom of the application page and come back to complete the application later. When you come back, you will find your saved application listed on your Applicant Dashboard. Select your application and hit the blue “Edit” button on the right-hand side.\n\nWherever you see an Upload button section, click the button to browse. From there you need to find the completed and saved document on your computer. Click on that document and hit the Open button.\n\nWhen you submit your application you will receive a notification on your screen and you will receive an email confirming that your application has been received. Of course, never hesitate to contact us should you have any questions.\n\nFoundant SLM, the system MSCF uses, has an applicant tutorial, which can be accessed here: https://support.foundant.com/hc/en-us/articles/4520338873111-SLM-Applicant-Tutorial. This page details how to do everything from register, to printing the application to filling out the forms. Of course, do not hesitate to contact us should you have additional questions or concerns."
