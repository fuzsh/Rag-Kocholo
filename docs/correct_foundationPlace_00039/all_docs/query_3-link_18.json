        "text": "Established in 1995 as our very first youth development program, Chill Burlington operates year-round with snowboard, skateboard, and stand up paddleboarding programs for youth from 11 to 19 years old. We work with various schools, youth agencies, social programs, and boardsports partners to provide these programs with all associated costs covered and barriers to participation removed. We embody the latest Positive Youth Development best practices to ensure participating youth build resiliency through targeted lessons and challenging physical activities.\n\nOur programs use the process of learning boardsports, an experiential learning cycle, and a core value-driven curriculum to help youth grow personally and see that there is a path out of their current circumstances.
