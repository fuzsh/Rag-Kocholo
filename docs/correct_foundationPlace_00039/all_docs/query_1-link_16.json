        "text": "BHS/BTC Schedule Update – September 13, 2023\n\nUpdated Schedule – WT’s Final GMP also provides a very basic schedule update. The updated schedule assumes a worst-case scenario Substantial Completion date of April 26th, 2026, and a move-in-ready date of July 10th, 2026. While this is later than I had hoped for, I believe that being able to move into this building before the start of the 2026/27 school year is critical and I am glad to see this is still possible after the unanticipated setbacks the project has faced from the Asbestos findings on the foundation this summer. Still, our team will continue efforts to fast-track the schedule so that delays do not push us any further back.\n\nIn August of 2020, while planning for a major renovation project, BSD discovered extensive PCB contamination in the air throughout the high school and technical center campus, forcing the District to close the entire campus to in-person learning. We began thinking extensively about the next steps for the project, before ultimately deciding to abandon the renovation project and build a new high school and technical center.\n\nIn December 2021, the School Board voted to award the contract for architectural services to a team comprised of Freeman, French, Freeman, Colin Lindberg & Associates, and Drummey Rosane Andersen. The vote followed strong recommendations from the Superintendent and the Proposal Review Committee.\n\nThis group presented five design options to the Board in the Spring of 2022; the Board chose “Option C” which was supported by the community, was the least expensive option, and provided the best fit for students and staff. Plans for this building were further refined in June after the Board voted to allow BSD leaders to leverage a $10m Congressional Grant to move some BTC program spaces to a new Aviation Education Center at the airport; it is estimated that this move reduced the cost of the building by $20m. In July, the Board further voted to allow BSD’s two alternative high school programs to remain in their current, off-campus locations which are serving students well.\n\nIn August 2022, the school board voted to ask City Council to approve a $165 million bond request on the November ballot to go towards the total project cost of $190m. City Council approved this request on August 15th and on November 8, voters overwhelmingly approved the bond. The rest, as they say, is history!\n\nYou can dig into the story more by looking through the materials available in our Pre-bond Archive."
