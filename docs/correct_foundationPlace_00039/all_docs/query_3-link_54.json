        "text": "Thank You!\n\nMore than 9,000 generous donors from across all 50 states and 12 countries showed up to help individuals and families rebuild and repair their flood-impacted homes. We were so touched by this response that we wanted to capture and preserve the spirit of this generosity in a video highlighting just how much the impact of our donors mattered - and continues to matter.\n\nLearn more about the VT Flood Response & Recovery Fund\n\nOur Funds and Foundations\n\nThe Community Foundation family is made up of hundreds of funds, foundations, and generous donors working together with a common love of Vermont.\n\nView All Funds\n\n“The Vermont Community Foundation was one of the first that reached out to CVOEO to help in the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the donors to the VT COVID-19 Response Fund may be unknown, but they are not at all forgotten. To say I’m grateful is to minimize your impact—thank you!”\n\nJan Demers | CVOEO Executive Director"
