Each youth will receive a total of $30,000 over the course of the 18-month intervention to support progress toward securing housing and independence.\n\nSpectrum’s Direct Cash Transfer program is designed to empower youth by providing them with a stable cash flow to help them pursue housing, jobs, education — whatever they need.\n\nRead More\n\nMentors Needed!\n\nYou don’t need to be a hero or a trained counselor. Spectrum mentors spend time doing activities and setting goals with a young person between the ages of 12 and 22 who needs a positive adult role model.\n\nSpectrum Mentors and Mentees are matched based on shared interests and meet at least twice a month. We have a particular need for male mentors of color, and LGBTQ+ identified mentors. Click here to learn more about Spectrum’s Mentoring Program.\n\nChange both your life and the life of a youth!\n\nApply Today!"
