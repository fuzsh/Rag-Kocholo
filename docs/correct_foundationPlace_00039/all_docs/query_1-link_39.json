        "text": "What does the Spark grant program support?\n\nThe Spark program will accept applications from hyperlocal, place-based projects (applications from a single community or a few towns working in partnership in the same region) or statewide/regional projects that support a community of individuals with a shared identity or interest.\n\nThis program will prioritize projects that:\n\nIncrease Vermonters access to opportunity as outlined in our five areas of impact,\n\nIncrease opportunities for positive social interaction while assuring full accessibility,\n\nConnect people with each other in deep and meaningful ways that are grounded in acts of generosity, and\n\nConnect people to the environment around them in ways that encourage stewardship and respect.\n\nHere are some examples of what the program will fund:\n\nOut of school and/or experiential learning opportunities for students to connect with local community members;\n\nCommunity-created public art to support downtown revitalization;\n\nA nature trail to support environmental education and encourage healthy exercise; and\n\nA community diversity event and dialogue in a town experiencing changing demographics.\n\nThe program will prioritize applicants with operating budgets of $500,000 or less.\n\nWhat does the Spark grant program not support?\n\nCapital costs and campaigns, unless the capital investment is needed for an activity or event that builds community connections (for example, eligible expenses may include purchase of materials to construct or expand on a community garden or greenhouse; purchase of upgraded lighting or furniture to expand use of a local gathering space; and/or purchase of materials to repair a skatepark and restore safe use).\n\nOngoing, recurring, or annual events or projects.\n\nEvent sponsorships\n\nPerformance ticket subsidies or scholarships that are not directly connected to community-building work. However, the program will support stipends to individuals who otherwise would not be able to participate to ensure more inclusive community processes, programs, and/or events (ex. childcare support, stipends to individuals, or transportation).\n\nEvents and performances that do not prioritize audience or community engagement.\n\nDebt reduction\n\nIndividuals (applicant should apply as part of a nonprofit organization, community group, municipality, or similar entity)\n\nExpenses that have already been incurred.\n\nRequests for general operating support.\n\nPrograms with religious instruction.\n\nIndirect expenses for a project (including fiscal sponsor fees).\n\nRepeat support for the same, or a similar, project.\n\nHow will your application be evaluated?\n\nThe Vermont Community Foundation utilizes the following criteria when reviewing applications to the Spark program:\n\nApplication clearly demonstrates how the proposed work will build or result in greater social capital.\n\nApplication provides evidence of community buy-in, interest, and/or engagement by:\n\nDemonstrating collaboration or volunteer engagement\n\nHaving additional funding sources for the work beyond this grant\n\nHaving received a request from the community for the work to happen\n\nApplication demonstrates that the work will result in cross-difference connection within a community (i.e. bringing together groups of people who might not otherwise cross paths).\n\nWho is eligible to apply?\n\nFirst time grant seekers are encouraged to apply and be in touch if any help is needed with the application process.\n\nGroups and organizations may apply multiple times but may only receive funding once in a calendar year, even if the organization is applying for funding for projects in different communities or towns.\n\nAn organization serving as fiscal sponsor for a Spark grantee does remain eligible to submit another application for a different project.\n\nAll applicants to programs at the Vermont Community Foundation must meet the guidelines outlined in the General Applicant Guidelines and Requirements found on our For Nonprofits page."
