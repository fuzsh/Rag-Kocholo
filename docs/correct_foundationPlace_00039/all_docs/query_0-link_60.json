Do you offer a waitlist?\n\nWe do not offer a waitlist. We do offer you an option to register to receive an email notification when a fund re-opens.

What are the eligibility criteria?\n\nTo qualify for assistance, you must meet CCAF financial, medical and insurance criteria. Please review eligibility criteria by selecting a specific diagnosis on our Covered Diagnoses chart.\n\nWhat are the income requirements?\n\nIndividuals or families with an adjusted gross income of up five times the federal poverty level may qualify for assistance (view the Federal Poverty Guidelines). Income verification is required as part of the application process.\n\nCCAF understands that cancer is an expensive illness and the family income can change drastically due to a cancer diagnosis. If your income is over our criteria, please call and discuss your specific financial situation with one of our co-payment specialists. If we are unable to assist you, we may be able to provide you with other vital resources and support services.\n\nCancerCare Co-Payment Assistance Foundation has limited resources and eligibility is determined based on financial need. Therefore, we must verify your income to determine if you are eligible for assistance within the guidelines of a particular fund.\n\nCan I get a list of the diagnoses you cover?\n\nYes. You can view our Covered Diagnoses chart. Please keep in mind that available funding may change, so check the website regularly for updates.\n\nDo uninsured patients qualify for help?\n\nNo. CCAF is only able to assist insured individuals who need help paying the co-payment cost of their treatments. However, our co-payment specialists can refer you to other resources that may be able to help, including drug company patient assistance programs and state prescription programs. PhRMA’s Medicine Assistance Tool (MAT) is helpful for people without insurance.\n\nIf I have Medicare Part D, can I still apply?\n\nYes. CancerCare Co-Payment Assistance Foundation can help if you meet all other medical and financial criteria. This assistance will count toward your true out-of-pocket costs (TrOOP) to get you through the Medicare Part D coverage gap. Please check for specific insurance eligibility requirements for each fund.\n\nIf you have a low income (up to 150% of the federal poverty level) with limited assets and are enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan, you may be eligible for Low Income Subsidy (LIS) assistance. If you qualify for LIS, your out-of-pocket expenses will be less. You can find out if you qualify by calling 800-772-1213 or by visiting cms.gov.\n\nDo you only assist Medicare patients?\n\nWe have certain funds that are limited to patients insured through a federal health insurance program such as Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE. We also have funds that accept all types of insurance coverage both private and public insurance. Please view specific diagnosis fund eligibility with insurance types noted.\n\nMust I live in the United States?\n\nYou must be either a U.S. citizen or a legal resident residing in the United States or U.S. territories.\n\nDoes my approval cover treatments I’ve already had?\n\nCCAF will consider retroactive reimbursement on a case-by-case basis for first time applicants actively receiving chemotherapy or targeted treatment. Our retroactive assistance will only consider dates of service within 60 days prior to the date we approve your application. Conditional approval does not include retroactive coverage.\n\nCommunication\n\nHow do I contact the CancerCare Co-Payment Assistance Foundation (CCAF)?\n\nYou, or a representative on your behalf, can contact CCAF by calling 866-55-COPAY (866-552-6729).

We will make every effort to provide you with other resources.\n\nCan my grant be ended without my knowledge?\n\nWe must see that you are using your grant.
