        "text": "Challenge\n\nThis housing development has 4 columns marking the entry driveway and one in particular was starting to lean, dangerously close to falling over. Due to the size and age of the column, previous contact to other contractors had been unsuccessful as no one was willing to undertake the work required.\n\nSolution\n\nFrontier Basement Systems however has patented products suitable for delicate jobs like this!\n\nA Push Pier was installed support the foundation using a low profile bracket. The under-footing low profile bracket is secured against and below the existing footing while pier sections are hydraulically driven (pushed) through a low profile bracket and into soil below using the combined structural weight and any contributory soil load as drive resistance. Pier sections are added and driven until a suitable load-bearing stratum is encountered. The weight of the structure is then transferred through the foundation brackets and pier, and to firm load bearing soil or bedrock."
