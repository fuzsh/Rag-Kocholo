Mike utilized a Burlington-Only team of artists, engineers, and opening acts for the event. A Local brewery provided free tickets for all veterans. Portions of ticket sales were donated to VT-based Waterwheel Foundation for local charity. \n\n-\nMike Finoia is a Comedian based out of NYC. He is a producer for TruTV's hit show Impractical Jokers, and tours regularly with the guys on their national tour. Mike is also the host of the podcasts Dented Cans and Comes a Time, which he co-hosts with Dead & Company bassist Oteil Burbridge.\n\nMike's debut special, \"Don't Let Me Down\" was met with glowing reviews in 2023, and when Mike isn't on the road he can be found nightly at NYC premiere comedy clubs, and heard regularly on Sirius XM's The Bonfire and Jim & Sam.\n\nSee him this weekend! üôå\nTickets in bio ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è\".",
