The Burlington Capital Foundation seeks to apply its parent company’s investment philosophy to investing in organizations whose efforts have direct and clear game-changing effects on people and their communities.

Our main areas of focus are Military/Veteran, Education, Arts, and Community Improvement support. We’ve made the choice to focus our gifts in Nebraska and Iowa; however, grants to national organizations are considered if they impact these specific geographic areas. Additionally, employees of Burlington Capital are encouraged to apply even if they are located outside of this region as it is our goal to assist our employees’ communities across the nation.
