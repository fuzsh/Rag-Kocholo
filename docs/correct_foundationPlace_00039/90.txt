The Antonio and Rita Pomerleau Foundation's Neighborhood Park in Burlington, VT is one of those “don't blink or you'll miss it” kind of things. Every day, thousands of cars pass by on the their way down busy Route 7 and barely notice this odd, little park on the corner of Route 7 and Home Avenue.

The Origins of the Unique Burlington Park

When Ernie Pomerleau, the President of Pomerleau Real Estate, approached Burlington City Arts, he had an artistic vision in mind for the redevelopment site of a shopping mall. His request was to incorporate a sculptural element, and the result was a remarkable sculpture garden that serves multiple purposes. Acting as a bus stop, a pedestrian gateway to the mall, and a vehicular entrance to Burlington, this garden has become an iconic landmark along Shelburne Road.

The “pocket park,” as it's affectionately called, features striking concrete sphinxes perched atop columns, adding an air of mystery and intrigue to the space. The originality of the artwork and the seamless integration of the park design have garnered widespread praise, making it a beloved attraction for locals and visitors alike.

Commissioned by Burlington City Arts and sponsored by the Antonio and Rita Pomerleau Foundation, this artistic endeavor was brought to life by the talented duo of Leslie Fry and Steven Schenker, whose collaborative efforts have left an indelible mark on the city's cultural landscape.

While it's doubtful that anyone makes a special trip to this park, unlike the nearby grand and gorgeous Oakledge Park, many of the locals simply take it for granted. The oblivious TJ Maxx shoppers barely acknowledge it's existence on their way to discount shopping nirvana. Honestly though, it's a unique work of art that is definitely worth taking a moment or two to enjoy.

What's with the eerie “gargoyle” statues?

The question is who designed this creepy little corner park and why the odd looking concrete gargoyle like figures?

Maybe only Tony Pomerleau knows for sure! The plaque on the side says “In Memory of Anne Marie and Ellen Pomerleau 1999” and maybe that holds some answers. Perhaps the intent of the park was to welcome shoppers into the small shopping plaza/shopping mall. The artists were Leslie Fry & Steven Schenker and maybe they have the answers as to why the design is a bit “unusual”.

While it would be rare to see anyone picnicking in the park or tossing a frisbee to a canine friend, occasionally you'll see someone hanging out waiting for a bus, taxi or whatever. It seems like a popular place to park shopping carts from the nearby Price Chopper. So, if you're in the area take notice of this quirky little enclave of Vermont. It's sort of the odd little cousin to Barre, Vermont's famous Hope Cemetery. One thing for sure is that it's weird and thought provoking. Utterly Vermont!
