        "text": "While countless millennials were undoubtedly changed on a molecular level by the ubiquitousness of “Cups” (more commonly known as “The Cup Song”) when the first “Pitch Perfect” movie premiered in 2012, it might be hard for many of us to believe we’ve had that damn song on the brain for 10 years.\n\nYes, 10 years.\n\nWe’ll say it again, this time with feeling: The first “Pitch Perfect” movie premiered 10 years ago on Sept. 28, 2012. And there's more on the way.\n\nThe first film — which racked up a $115 million worldwide gross on a $17 million budget — was a surprise success at the time, becoming \"one of the top-performing DVD, VOD and pay-cable titles of 2013,\" per \"Variety.\" This resulted in a 2015 sequel, \"Pitch Perfect 2\" ($287 million worldwide gross on a $29 million budget), as well as a less-than-stellar-performing threequel, \"Pitch Perfect 3,\" in 2017. Talks of a fourth film persisted for several years (spurred on in part by a 2018 Instagram post from series star Rebel Wilson in which she and several co-stars were pictured holding up four fingers) before Peacock announced a spin-off series starring fan-favorite character Bumper (Adam Devine) would premiere in late 2022. So, with a decade of mouth sounds to spur us on (that's what it is and you know it; don't get mad at me), here's what you need to know about the upcoming series.\n\nRELATED: Sarah Hyland Announces She's The New 'Love Island' Season 4 Host\n\nFirst, though, a look back: Starring Anna Kendrick in her breakout role, \"Pitch Perfect\" followed indie-girl college freshman Beca (Kendrick) as she joined her school’s all-women a cappella group, the Barden Bellas, largely against her will. However, along the way, she manages to use her music production skills and dry sense of humor to create a found family amongst her fellow Bellas (including Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, and Anna Camp), fall in love (with a leading man from a rival squad portrayed by Skylar Astin), and kick some a-ca-ass.\n\nThe second and third films added additional cast members (notably actress-singer-songwriter Hailee Steinfeld before her roles in hits such as \"Bumblebee,\" \"Dickinson,\" and \"Hawkeye\"), international competitions against some Imagine Dragons-loving Germans, and a USO tour.\n\nPeacock's spin-off series, \"Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin,\" will see Devine's Bumper Allen (aka the most gloriously weird a cappella frat boy in history) move to Germany several years after the events of the first three films when one of his songs hits big there. We're sure his ego is perfectly in check. Devine will be joined by returning series co-star Flula Borg (who portrays Piëter Krämer) as well as series newcomers Sarah Hyland (host of \"Love Island USA\"), Lera Abova, and Jameela Jamil, per \"Variety.\"\n\nIf you're looking to catch up on the a-ca-madness before \"Bumper in Berlin\" hits NBCUniversal's streaming service, you're in luck. You can find \"Pitch Perfect\" and \"Pitch Perfect 2\" on Peacock.\n\n\"Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin\" premieres on Peacock on Nov. 23."
