Well....I got bored one night and it came on tv.....i'll be damned if it wasnt hysterical! Very cool movie. I've read that the people that sing in the movie actually recorded their own vocals. SO major props for that. Anybody seen this movie?\n\nThis site may earn a commission from merchant links like Ebay, Amazon, and others.\n\nLeadFinger\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 10, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n2,778\n\nReaction score\n\n2,292\n\nLocation\n\nLos Angeles\n\nJun 29, 2014\n\n#2\n\nWhen was it made?

I was surprised at the entire movie. When I originally saw the previews I thought it was gonna be Hollywood cheese.\n\nsgtbeefheart\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 20, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n4,104\n\nReaction score\n\n1,141\n\nLocation\n\nUK\n\nLPBR\n\nActive Member\n\nJoined\n\nApr 7, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n117\n\nReaction score\n\n34\n\nJul 9, 2014\n\n#7\n\nWe tried to watch it a couple months ago (me and my wife) but the movie failed to hook us: after 10 minutes or so we gave up. It may be interesting to whose enjoy TV reality shows such as American Idol though.\n\neS.G.\n\nWell-Known Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 1, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n15,308\n\nReaction score\n\n10,425\n\nLocation\n\nThe SWAMP (central Florida)\n\nJul 9, 2014\n\n#8\n\nTrailer seems like a Glee meets \"Scary Movie\" style of spoof type thing?????\n\nNo car explosions....guns...Monty Python or any member of the original cast of Saturday Night live......I'm out.\n\nBut now if I had some of the damn RUM Angus is hording I could probably tolerate it. :-)"
