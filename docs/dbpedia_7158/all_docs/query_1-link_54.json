        "text": "This feature was produced in collaboration between Vox Creative and OnStar. Vox Media editorial staff was not involved in the creation or production of this content.\n\nSome of the most insightful conversations come in the most casual settings. On The Ride we catch up with today's top personalities in technology and entertainment on their way to work, running errands, or checking out a new show. Along the way, we field questions sent live from The Verge readers via a tablet connected to the OnStar 4G LTE built-in Wi-Fi® hotspot.\n\nWhen screenwriter Kay Cannon first set out to write a movie about the world of competitive a cappella, she had no idea where to begin. She also had no idea the movie catch on like wildfire and set up a record breaking sequel that currently holds the title for highest grossing music comedy film to date. With \"Pitch Perfect 3\" set to hit theaters in 2017 and several other projects in the works, Cannon is never short of creative outlets. We caught up with the LA-based comedian, writer, producer and director to talk about hitting deadlines as a new mom and the perks of writing into the wee hours of the morning.\n\nWhere are we headed?\n\nKay Cannon: The mall, baby. Gotta go to the mall. Lids, Zales, you name it. We're going.\n\nYour main credit at this point is \"Pitch Perfect,\" which is now a franchise. Can we call it franchise?\n\nKC: I think you can now because I just signed on to do the third one\n\nWhy do you think that people respond so well to music in film and why so much more recently?\n\nKC: Well, I think it kind of started for me with television because \"American Idol\" being \"American Idol\" and then \"The Sing Off\" and \"The Voice.\" There's just all these shows that obviously the nation loves, they just love to hear a song and to watch people be really good at singing and they like to watch people be really bad at singing, and they get to vote and they are all connected to it and it doesn't matter if you speak English or if you speak whatever language that you can relate.\n\nA song just brings back memories and emotions and all that kind of stuff. I actually think that musicals are quite hard to be successful at for films, and so I think the reason maybe Pitch worked is because, hopefully, knock on wood, the comedy.\n\nIt seemed like around the turn of the century there was sort of a resurgence of music in film and \"Pitch Perfect\" seemed to tap right into that. Do you think that was luck or do you think maybe you were inspired by that?\n\nKC: I think it was a little bit of luck because I have to say that pitching a movie about a capella and it not being a direct connection to the musicals that we know and love and understand, it's a pretty tough sell and when you have a full mostly female cast. Young, female cast, it makes it even tougher. It's sort of like a little bit of a genre on it's own because although it's considered a musical, to me and a big part of it is it's a comedy that has music in it.\n\nI think everybody involved is totally 100% surprised [by] the success of \"Pitch Perfect\" and that there was a sequel and that there's going to be a third one. I don't think anyone saw that coming.\n\nDid you have any experience in music prior to writing the movie?\n\nKC: I sing in the shower so much. No, I have a theater degree and I've done musicals. It's really like I never did a capella. I was an improviser. I wasn't in that world at all, but I was in the chorus growing up and I did swing choir and then I would karaoke with the best of them. I was thinking a lot about music actually during that time and sometimes I would just go in a private room with my husband at the time and we would just sing songs just the two of us.\n\nWhat sort of reputation did the a capella groups have when you were growing up? I've heard of them just being total babe magnets like they're the cool people on campus. Is that your experience?\n\nKC: Yeah. It's like the rock star situation, right? Bar none, forgive me in being disrespectful to any \"a capellians\" listening right now or watching right now, rather, but they are nerds. What they come out and I'd ask them to tell me stories and they're like, \"This night got totally crazy,\" and you're just like, \"Nerd.\" It wasn't that crazy but then you watch them perform and you get a talent crush, they're adorable.\n\nSometimes when I watch a lot of cuts of the first movie, so there's a lot more performances from the trebles and there was a couple of trebles that I was like, \"They are so cute.\" I don't think I would have felt that way had I not seen them perform. Actually for me in high school and college I didn't even know that the world of a capella existed because we didn't have it.\n\nHow did you find out about it?\n\nKC: First season of \"30 Rock.\" I was a writer and there was a joke with the character Toofer, played by Keith Powell, being from Harvard and he was in a Harvard a capella group and I thought that was made up. I was like, \"That was so funny,\" and my boss Robert Carlisle said, \"No. That's a real world. There's actually groups that compete,\" and I literally said in the room, \"Somebody needs to write a movie about that.\" I thought it was so interesting and weird and hilarious and [during] my lunch hour, I looked up different groups to see whatever I could find online.\n\nThen totally separate from that, I was friends with Elizabeth Banks and had told her, \"I want to write a movie about college a capella but I don't know enough about that world to do it,\" since I didn't really know anything about it. On her campus, it was very popular and then 2 years later, it's so crazy and separate from that conversation that I had with her because I would pitch to everybody, \"I want to write this, but I don't know anything about it.\" Her husband, Elizabeth's husband Max, found out about the book \"Pitch Perfect.\" She called and I think she forgot about that conversation that I had with her, but felt like I would be the right person to write that movie.\n\nWe're actually getting questions from The Verge audience live. Did you expect the movie to blow up like it did?\n\nKC: No. Absolutely not. I was thrilled the movie got made at all. I remember being at the premiere of \"Pitch Perfect\" and being interviewed and stuff and I was like, \"I still kind of can't believe that it's real. That it's even happening,\" and wanted to pinch myself.\n\nHow do you keep the story and the characters fresh?\n\nKC: I don't know yet. It's tough. It's a challenge. I felt like the sequel was a challenge for that very same reason, and I feel like we somehow pulled it off. For the third one, I think it's about breaking the rules. I think it's about showing really the unexpected.\n\nWhat were some of your earliest scripts?\n\nKC: I'm a big football fan and I wrote this pilot. I started writing because I was auditioning for stuff and I wasn't getting anything for like a year or something. I'd get little things here and there, but it was pretty frustrating so I felt like I had to write for myself and so I did. Me and my friend Karen wrote this pilot called \"Big Foam Finger,\" which is supposed to be a show within a show of this crew not unlike what we're doing, that goes to actual tailgate parties of football games while they're happening. It's scripted, but it's character-to-character but then they'd go and they'd be with real superfans. That would be improvised.\n\nYou wrote a part for yourself in there?\n\nKC: Yeah, totally — and my friend Karen. We both wrote parts for ourselves. That was my first thing and I happened, luckily, to be friendly with Tina Fey. She liked it, so that got it started and then from there, I wrote a spec of \"The Office\" back when specs were a thing to write. Then my first real script was \"30 Rock.\" This script called \"Black Tie\" with Paul Reubens. He plays a prince. He played an inbred prince.\n\nWhere did cups come from? The whole idea of the cup thing.\n\nKC: Yeah. The two girls who are on \"Nashville,\" they did a video. That was very very popular and Anna Kendrick saw that and she taught herself how to do it. Then in the script I knew that that Beca — Anna's character Beca — was not going to do the same thing that the other people did for their audition, but I didn't know what yet so it was kind of open ended. When Anna Kendrick came in and auditioned, that's what she auditioned with. She auditioned with cups.\n\nWhen we saw that, we were just like — the director and myself, the producers, all unanimously — were just like, \"That's what she's going to do,\" and god bless her for doing that because it's huge and it's been awesome. That's the song that brought the world together in a way because that's what a lot of people do. It's exciting. A lot of tweens do it or even 8 year olds will do it and I've seen a group of 500 people all doing it where they connect with each other so it's really cool.\n\nYou're about to do your third \"Pitch Perfect.\" Is it boring to keep going with \"Pitch Perfect?\"\n\nKC: No, not at all. They're so challenging. You just don't want to mess it up, and you have a lot more pressure. I have a lot more pressure from the studio and from the director and from even the actors really because I don't want to fail them. There's a lot of scrutiny, so it's hard and I will say for the sequel, I had just had a baby and so that was real, real hard. No joke, I was breastfeeding over the computer.\n\nWow.\n\nKC: I had a deadline and I had to get it in. My daughter — who's now going to be almost two — we don't let her watch television, but she has seen cups. So she will take a cup and start doing stuff with it. It's super hard. I think this third one is going to be even more challenging because you just don't want to screw it up and you don't want it to taint the feeling of the first movie.\n\nI find I do my best work when I'm holed up in a room and have a deadline and I can write. I can work for very long periods of time without fatiguing so it helps me. I think at nighttime 'til two or three in the morning. That seems to be the most fun for me. There's something like when the sun is out it's just — you just want to go outside and walk around and be next to a pool.\n\nI had this deadline coming up, and so I very much am a structured like I just write all day long and just take some breaks whenever I can. It's kind of like I got into a little room and I curl up and become like a little monster. You would think that I didn't have money to buy food. I kind of live that kind of way. I feel like if there's anything luxurious around, it's not helpful to the process. My husband's a comedy writer and he'll sit with me because comedy — to me — I always think should be written in an ensemble. I think when you're just by yourself it's just too hard.\n\nWhat's next for Kay Cannon?\n\nKC: What's next for me? I'm writing this movie for Universal that we go into pre-production in October and it's called \"Let it Snow\" and it's a book written by John Green and two other writers. Maureen and Lauren are their names and it's kind of a young adult \"Love Actually.\" I think it's kind of cool. I love me some \"Love Actually.\" I've got some TV stuff on the horizon that I can't talk about yet, which is such a bummer because all I want to do is talk about it and Pitch 3 and then yeah, I'm going to start directing — and life.\n\nFantastic. This is the mall.\n\nKC: Going to eat some Cinnabons."
