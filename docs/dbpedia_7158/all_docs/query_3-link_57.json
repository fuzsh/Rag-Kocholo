        "text": "Rebel Wilson (Bridesmaids, Jojo Rabbit) has made a good career for herself, starring in mostly comedic roles that really kicked off in 2012 when the first Pitch Perfect movie came on the scene.\n\nThe franchise ended up making two successful sequels, and a spinoff series that didn’t last too long, but according to Wilson, we can anticipate a fourth film.\n\nIn a recent interview with BBC Radio 2, the actress shared: \"Hopefully, there's a fourth one in the works. There is one being developed.”\n\nShe added: “I mean, I know we're older now, so I don't exactly know what the storyline's going to be. I guess they've got to get the script right first, which is the age-old dilemma.”\n\nSo it sounds like things are still super early stages, but it’s cool to hear that another one is in the works. I enjoy the campiness of those movies, and their fun soundtracks. We will let you know more as the sequel develops."
