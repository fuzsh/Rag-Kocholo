Arriving at her new college, Beca (Anna Kendrick) finds herself not right for any clique but somehow is muscled into one that she never would have picked on her own: alongside mean girls, sweet girls and weird girls whose only thing in common is how good they sound when they sing together. When Beca leads this a cappella singing group out of their traditional arrangements and perfect harmonies into all-new mash-ups, they fight to climb their way to the top of college music competitions. The Pitch Perfect Sing-Along Edition is an outrageously hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy that also stars Anna Camp (The Help), Brittany Snow (Hairspray) and Rebel Wilson (Bridesmaids).",

        "text": "One of the best comedies ever made\n\nJuly 14, 2023\n\nItâ€™s aimed at Glee fans and teenage girls, but the infectious energy will appeal to a wider audience.\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\nPitch Perfect is still aca-exciting a decade after its release.\n\nOctober 6, 2022\n\nThe singing is great, the jokes are plentiful, and, well...Ben Platt! Need I say more?\n\nSeptember 27, 2022\n\nPitch Perfect combines the tuneful underdog triumphs of Glee with the sassiness of Bridesmaids to produce a sweet-sounding, wickedly funny movie.\n\nDecember 17, 2020\n\nAnna Kendrick anchors a terrific cast of young women as they explore internal struggles and external threats in a cappella glory.\n\nDecember 16, 2020\n\nFeatures a performance from Rebel Wilson that should turn the actress into a household name.\n\nSeptember 20, 2020\n\nPitch Perfect isn't always on key, but it's more impressive than a good karaoke performance, enough so to provide plenty of laughs and entertainment.\n\nJanuary 22, 2020\n\nSilly, predictable but funny as hell with an infectiously catchy soundtrack, Pitch Perfect is a ray of cinematic sunshine.\n\nDecember 9, 2019"
