        "text": "Well… sometimes I have the feeling I can do crystal meth, but then I think, mmm… better not.\n\nRating 12a\n\nLength 1h52\n\nRelease 21.12.2012\n\nDirector Jason Moore\n\nAbout Beca, a college fresher, reluctantly joins an all-girls a cappella group and later infuses freshness into their repertoire. They then take on a male a cappella group in a competition.\n\nMoon: no moon sighting\n\nWhere to Watch: Netflix\n\nTrailer:\n\nThe Good\n\nAnna Kendrick gives an opinion changing performance with this film and sees me going from avoiding anything with her in, thanks to Twilight, to her being someone I’d watch in everything.\n\nNot only is she likeable and relatable as Freshman Beca, I was left with a want to see how Twilight would have played out had she secured the role of Bella Swan.\n\nThere is a really good plot thread in which Leader Aubrey, feeling challenged by natural leader Beca, doubles down on her management style and makes it clear that Beca is not liked, or wanted. Now this may appear to be a clique that has been seen in many films. Even music competition film Sister Act has a similar theme with Whoopi’s teacher nun and the class she has to look after.\n\nHowever, Pitch Perfect makes it feel fresh and new.\n\nThe music is awesome. Every song collected for this soundtrack is upbeat and will have you humming along for days after you watched.\n\nI like that the romance, while present, takes a back seat, favouring a slow burn and friendship.\n\nThe Bad\n\nI do love both Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins. However for every line that hits a funny bone, there’s about three that will have you cringing. I guess that’s the nature of ad lib.\n\nI wish they’d put subtitles on Lilly, because what she actually says is genius. They should have been there for every line even in the cinema. I absolutely cannot recommend strongly enough that the next time you watch, you put on the subtitles.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nSome of the jokes, particularly those that are aimed at Cynthia Rose’s sexuality, feel very dated and boarding on being phobic.\n\nIn the same sense, the whole concept of “Fat Amy”. While not so much that it hasn’t aged well, but more that it was never funny. Yes, I’m saying that as a larger lady. However, the point is that even if you have the “fat” character poking fun at themselves it’s rarely going to work if she’s written by someone who has never had weight issues.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis is such a comfort movie for me, despite the flaws. I think I watch it at least once a year and this is quite significant considering I watched it on one of the worst days of my life."
