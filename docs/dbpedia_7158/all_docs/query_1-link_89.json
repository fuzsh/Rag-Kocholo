        "text": "The Barden Bellas are in a funk. Beca (Anna Kendrick) is a failed music producer and Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is singing on street corners – as Fat Amy Winehouse, one of the many tasteless, unfunny moments Wilson gives us. Desperate to reform, they wind up in Europe on a USO tour performing for troops, thanks to blonde Bella member Aubrey (Anna Camp), whose father is a military bigwig.\n\nFilm review: The Greatest Showman – Hugh Jackman is out to entertain in glossy original musical\n\nThere’s a wretched subplot, featuring Fat Amy’s shady long-lost father (John Lithgow, with a criminal Aussie accent), who is trying to steal her inheritance and winds up kidnapping the Bellas. There’s also DJ Khaled playing himself – he should be ashamed – and several flirtations between the Bellas and random guys, notably student vet Chloe (Brittany Snow) lusting after her military escort.\n\nThankfully, the songs are still top-notch, with Britney Spears’ Toxic, George Michael’s Freedom! ’90 and Sia’s Cheap Thrills all entertainingly performed. Even so, and despite School of Rock’s smart Mike White co-scripting, the film still feels like a shadow of its predecessors. Even Elizabeth Banks – returning as commentator Gail – lacks her usual snarky bite.\n\nYoung Post’s review of Pitch Perfect 3\n\nPitch Perfect 3 opens on January 18"
