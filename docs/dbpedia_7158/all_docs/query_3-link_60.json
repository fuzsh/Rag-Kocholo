        "text": "Wilson played Amy in the films, a confident and funny character known for her renditions of Amy Winehouse songs, starring opposite Anna Kendrick as lead protagonist Beca Mitchell.\n\nShe told Roslin: \"I absolutely loved making those movies – we're all still friends, all of us girls – they're just so joyful. I think what people see on the screen is just us having a laugh.\"\n\n\"It wasn't really acting because I love singing and dancing, and I just loved hanging out with that cast so, so much. It was really fun,\" continued Wilson.\n\nMore like this\n\nThe actor went on to tease a potential fourth entry in the franchise, which she claimed is \"being developed\", but appeared in the dark about what the narrative could involve.\n\nWilson added: \"Hopefully there’s a fourth one in the works. There is one being developed. I mean, I know we’re older now so I don’t exactly know what the storyline’s going to be... I guess they’ve got to get the script right first, the age-old dilemma.\"\n\nPitch Perfect was recently revived for streaming service Peacock with the six-episode series Bumper in Berlin, which featured The Good Place's Jameela Jamil and Workaholics alum Adam DeVine.\n\nAlas, the series lost its season 2 renewal during the uncertain months of last year's SAG-AFTRA and WGA strike action, so it would be interesting to see if any of its characters could find a second life in the next film.\n\nWilson said there were countless \"great pop songs\" she'd love to see covered in the next film, with the near-decade long break between entries meaning there would be a lot of recent hits to choose from – as well as the classics, of course.\n\nThe actor was promoting her memoir Rebel Rising, which was released in the UK last week.\n\nPitch Perfect is available to stream on Netflix. Sign up for Netflix from £4.99 a month. Netflix is also available on Sky Glass and Virgin Media Stream."
