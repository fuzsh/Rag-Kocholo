        "text": "It’s probably wise not to assume too much about Pitch Perfect. I went into the cinema knowing relatively little and found it delightfully surprising. I’m not exaggerating when I say that it’s one of the funniest films I’ve seen in a long while and I’m sure others will agree. This edgy musical comedy has an excellent cast full of great talent and a sharp script that is as bold as it is hilarious. The competition-focused structure of the movie may seem familiar but Pitch Perfect is something quite different, and it makes this clear right from its very first scene.\n\nAnna Kendrick stars as Beca, a freshman more interested in a career producing music than getting involved at university. She reluctantly wades into the apparently ruthless world of collegiate a cappella contests when her father presents her with an ultimatum about her future. The rest of the cast includes Anna Camp, Brittany Snow and a scene-stealing turn from Bridesmaids’ Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy. Wilson’s comic timing is superb, with many of her obviously improvised lines scoring the film’s biggest laughs.\n\nThroughout, Pitch Perfect makes it clear that it’s prepared to approach gross-out humour that most would see as unusual for an all-female cast. How much audiences enjoy this sort of thing will vary, but I found a lot of it very amusing. One of the messages in this film is the idea that the girls can match or beat the all-male team when they take a few risks and break out of conventional roles. I welcome this type of feminism and feel that the tone and handling here is refreshingly different. The theme of embracing individuality is hardly something original, but I think this film succeeds in its aims. It certainly helps that it spends loads of time referencing The Breakfast Club and exploring the power of music in movies. (I really like how the male lead played by Skylar Astin is an unashamed movie geek, it makes an interesting change from what I expected with the character.)\n\nWhile I’m sure many will interpret this as a cynical comedy, I’m left feeling that the main theme here is trust. The elements that really work in Pitch Perfect are those that focus on relationships in which somebody is holding someone (or a group of other people) at a distance. This is shown in the relationship between Beca and her father and in Beca’s attitude towards the a cappella group. It’s also clear through Camp’s character Aubrey and in the unobtrusive romantic subplot that runs through the film.\n\nIt doesn’t surprise me to learn that Pitch Perfect’s great screenplay was written by Kay Cannon. She’s someone who has been a longtime writer for 30 Rock and now works on New Girl; the irony and fast-pace to the humour in those shows is something that is obviously present here. While this is a film that has a few faults, it is outrageously funny and surprisingly heartfelt at times. I like how openly accepting it is of how nerdy its characters are and how it never treats that nerdiness negatively. The cast is brilliant, with Kendrick and Wilson as standouts, and the movie is so amusing that I’m already eager to watch it all over again."
