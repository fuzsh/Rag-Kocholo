        "text": "You don’t need to be a Gleek who adores spontaneous break outs of choreographed musical numbers to go see Pitch Perfect; all you need is a love of flying Mexican food, a devotion to music and the desire to watch a movie that will make you laugh until the very end.\n\nThe plot revolves around a reluctant freshman at Barden College, Beca, played by Anna Kendrick, whose dream is to be a DJ. Her dad, a professor at the university, gives Beca an ultimatum. He will help her move to L.A. and fulfill her dream only if she will just go out, make friends, and enjoy the college experience at the activities fair.\n\nThat is where we are introduced to the esteemed world of acapella at Barden and the two main groups at the campus, the Treble Makers and the Barden Bellas, an all female acapella group that Beca is wheedled into. At the acapella ‘mixer’ where all the groups get together Beca meets Jesse, member of the Treble Makers, a movie buff who also works at a local radio station with her. The Treble Makers and the Bellas, constant rivals, compete in a lot of competitions and a “Riff-Off” where the groups battle through categories of songs.\n\nThe Bellas struggle through constant power conflicts of the old and new with many memorable characters, Aubrey the leader you love to hate, Lilly the quiet Asian girl who says disturbing facts in awkward silences like ‘I ate my twin in the womb’, and the funniest of all the girl who calls herself Fat Amy.\n\nBumper (member of the Trebles): “I sometimes have the feeling we should kiss”\n\nFat Amy: “I sometimes have the feeling I should do crystal meth, but then I think, hmmm… better not”\n\nPitch Perfect is not just your typical High School Musical type of movie; it is actually funny, surprisingly relatable, and takes the songs everyone loves to the big screen. Numerous shows and movies have taken popular songs and recreated them, but Pitch Perfect mashes up songs so they sound so much better. Mash ups such as Just the Way You Are/ Just a Dream, Bright Lights Bigger City/ Magic, and the biggest one of all Price Tag/ Don’t You (Forget About Me)/ Give Me Everything/ Just the Way You Are/ Party in the U.S.A and Turn the Beat Around.\n\nSo if you want to dance in the aisles, or just sulk and toe tap in the corner, I suggest you go watch Pitch Perfect; you won’t be disappointed. Pitch Perfect is rated Pg-13 and is 112 minutes long. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars."
