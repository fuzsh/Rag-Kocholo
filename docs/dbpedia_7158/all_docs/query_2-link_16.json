        "text": "Adam DeVine [who plays TheTreblemakers' lead singer] is a great singer. Lots of confidence. In fact, he's probably as good as a lot of other singers we work with. He was really prepared, he knew all his lines, he knew the song really well and he knew what he could do with his voice.\n\nKendrickâ€™s voice range is definitely lower than a lot of the other girls, so it helps to harmonize as several of the girls in the a cappella group have noticeably higher voices.\n\nWilson also had a really good voice and did a profoundly good job when it came to exemplifying her character while singing.\n\nSnow shines in her solos at the beginning of the movie where people get to hear her high-range voice"
