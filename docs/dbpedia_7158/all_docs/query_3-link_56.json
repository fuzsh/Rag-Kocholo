        "text": "Despite its popularity with audiences, Pitch Perfect staple Anna Camp doesn't think that a fourth film is currently being developed.\n\nAfter the release of the first Pitch Perfect film in 2012, it was evident that the movie-turned-franchise was one of the few musical films to generate several entries, receiving a complete trilogy. In fact, throughout its run, the films nearly garnered an impressive $600 million total, leaving plenty of room for other Pitch Perfect entries or spin-off stories.\n\nDespite that popularity with audiences, one of the longtime stars of the franchise doesn't have much hope to offer fans who might be awaiting news that a fourth cinematic installment is in the works.\n\nPitch Perfect Star Doesn't Think a Fourth Installment is Being Developed\n\nWhile recently speaking with Screen Rant, actor Anna Camp admits, \"I don't think [Pitch Perfect 4] is in development, unfortunately, but if we did get a [Pitch Perfect 4], I mean at the end of three, I was a doula. I was wanting to become a doula. I don't know if anybody remembered that.\" Camp then goes on to add that if there was another film, \"I would like to see what Aubreyâ€¦ if she's really delivering children into the world and singing acapella to them as they come out of their mother's bodies, you can print that. And I hope that the writers see it and that we make it.\" While we do have an affinity for Camp's work, perhaps it might be best to close this one out with the generally successful third film.\n\nPitch Perfect 3 synopsis: After the highs of winning the world championships, the Bellas find themselves split apart and discovering there aren't job prospects for making music with your mouth. But when they get the chance to reunite for an overseas USO tour, this group of awesome nerds will come together to make some music and some questionable decisions one last time.\n\nWell, there you have it, Pitch Perfect writers. If you decide to move forward with another movie, there's at least one potential idea to follow up on. All things considered, is Pitch Perfect 4 really necessary at this point? Let us know your thoughts below."
