        "text": "The Barden Bellas are a collegiate, all-girls acapella singing group thriving on some of the female pop songs and their perfect looks. Introducing some much needed energy into their selection, The Bellas take on their male rivals in one of the competitions taken place on the campus. After a devastating fail at last year’s finals, they were forced to regroup. Among the new recruits is a freshman at Barden University, Beca, an independent, aspiring DJ with no interest in the college life. She is cajoled into joining The Bellas. But after she meets Jesse, from the rival all-male a cappella group, Beca has a new outlook and takes it upon herself to help the Bellas find their new look and sound and get back into the competition.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why I am so interested in this film. One reason why I love this film is because of the songs that were song throughout the movie. It shows to the audience that not only can this all-female cast are great actresses, but they also have the talents of dancing and singing. Another reason why I love this film is because it shows how competitive boys and girls are against each other. It shows the true meaning of “battle of the sexes”. It shows how far females will go and how much effort females would put into their goal to show that they could challenge males and have victory.\n\nAlso “Pitch Perfect” is similar to one of the other films that I used for this project, “Mean Girls” because the main cast of the film are a group of young actresses. The cast members show to the world that even young women could be comedic performers too. The actress who portrayed Beca, Anna Kendrick, carries the movie with ease. One thing that I like about this film is that she leaves enough room for the rest of the cast members to blossom too. The film does not only focus of the main leading character of the film, but it gives the other actresses opportunities to show off their talents more too. The singing was pretty good.\n\nSomehow the movie is still a pop culture phenomenon. The a cappella-themed movie initially had modest box office success, but with its DVD and soundtrack, Pitch Perfect’s post release year is when the movie actually increased attention. It’s launched several of its actresses and actors to recognition and fame, and spawned a No. 1 Billboard hit in “Cups,” plus a sequel, and a Christmas album.\n\nOf course, similar to most of all of the other chick flicks that has ever came out, “Pitch Perfect” does have one of those “girl meets boy” story in it, and there should be. This film could be categorized as a romantic comedy also. A romantic comedy is a movie that deals with love in a light, entertaining and amusing way. The movie “Pitch Perfect” is the wit and charm of a classic romantic comedy. It is a romantic comedy about the kind of love that turns everything else upside down.\n\nSo in conclusion, even though the movie did not do as well like the film “Bridesmaids”, it is still considered to be one of the best all-female leading cast because of the songs and comedic performances by the actresses. This sweet-natured film was about the life and loves of collegians from competing a-cappella groups. This is one of the strangest and also one of the more entertaining movies of the year of 2012. I chose this film because it is different from the other comedic chick flicks that has ever been released, because it is a not only a romantic comedy, but it is also a musical."
