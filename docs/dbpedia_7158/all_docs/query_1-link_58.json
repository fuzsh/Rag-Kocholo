        "text": "It has surpassed the total take of the first “Pitch Perfect” film ($115.4 million). Released May 15, \"Pitch Perfect 2\" is the second chapter in the story about an all-female a cappella college singing group called The Barden Belles. It stars Anna Kendrick, who also starred in two previous musical films in the last six months (“Into the Woods” and “The Last Five Years”). She earned a Tony Award nomination at age 12 for her performance in High Society. With a score of pop hits, the film is directed by Elizabeth Banks, with a script by Kay Cannon, based on characters in Mickey Rapkin's book, “Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory.”\n\nIt still has a way to go before it surpasses worldwide grosses of “Frozen” ($1.27 billion) and “The Lion King” ($987.5 million). The top-grossing non-animated musical was “Mamma Mia!” ($610 million)."
