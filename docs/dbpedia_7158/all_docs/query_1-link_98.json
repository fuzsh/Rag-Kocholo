        "text": "On a friend’s suggestion I decided to check out the much talked about Pitch Perfect. Aaaaand…..I wasn’t disappointed. I am glad I listened to her because this Anna Kendrick starrer got me grooving and singing along with Barden Bellas. And any movie getting you that involved got to be good.\n\nPitch Perfect (2012): IMDb\n\nI love how the movie didn’t shift its focus much on Beca’s love life and kept it centred around music, which is what the movie is essentially about. Change is a theme that screams right at you when you watch this movie. It’s about the perks of change and flexibility. Once one gets over their pride and ego and obviates anything that is stopping them from making a positive change, life can move towards the better. Change isn’t that bad at all.\n\nThe story revolves around Beca, a freshman who aspires to become a DJ. She is challenged by her dad to participate in college life by joining an activity group and if she doesn’t like it by the end of the year then he would fund her to go to LA and start her career as a professional DJ. So she gets into this acapella band called the Barden Bellas. The Bellas are desperate to find new recruits after their disastrous performance at Lincoln Center the year before. Making a compromise they admit a diverse group of women in their group and hence began the battle of creative independence. The Bellas earned themselves a notorious reputation of being the snooze fest of acapella as they keep repeating songs which the youth of this century can’t relate to. All except one member is willing to bring in a change in their style. But the leader of the group being a traditionalist pushes the group to perform the same old song no one likes. Beca keeps trying to imbibe her own mix to the group but fails. This result in a fallout after which both Beca and Aubrey reflect on their own mistakes and get the group together, giving it a new voice and new face.\n\nThe movie runs at a pretty fast pace focussing mostly on the Bellas and Beca’s mixing talents while quickly touching upon the romance between Beca and Jesse. The anguish and frustration of having to deal with a controlling traditionalist is palpable and boy are those commentators annoying! The movie has a freshness about it which separates it from any other movie of the genre. It doesn’t go over many clichés that such movies are wont to; except for maybe the happy ending part. It really is exceptional and is like a gust of breeze in its freshness.\n\nThe casting and direction is really good given Hollywood’s tendency to portray college life as something so extravagant that half the world can’t relate to it. At least this felt close to the real college life. And I especially liked Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow and Anna Camp’s performances. It had humour in moderation in the form of Rebel Wilson’s Fat Amy. It felt like a pretty balanced movie with a few iconic lines like, “Not a good enough reason to use the word penetrate” and more.\n\nThis movie is a must watch for anyone who likes music and rhythm. It’s a movie one would like to watch on a lazy Sunday when they want nothing more than a good story and some good music. It’s one of those movies that will be on the popular charts for long and will be the fan favourites forever.\n\nThanks for Reading\n\nMore\n\nIT Review\n\nMoana Review\n\nMy Top 10 Disney Pixar Movies\n\nCaptain Fantastic: Why everyone should watch it.\n\nThe Perks of Being a Wallflower: My Favourite Movie #1\n\nThe Godfather: My Favourite Movie #2\n\nFlipped: My Favourite Movie #3\n\nGentleman’s Agreement\n\nTop 10 Harry Potter Tear Jerkers"
