        "text": "The third movie arrived in 2017\n\nThere's already been three amazing movies, but it sounds like a fourth edition of musical comedy Pitch Perfect could be in the works!\n\nAccording to Australian actress Rebel Wilson, who plays the iconic role of Fat Amy in the franchise, a script is already in development for a fourth movie, with Rebel also admitting that conversations have been had.\n\nThe Mirror are reporting Rebel confessed the exciting news to fans during her show at the London Palladium on Monday night (29th April), saying: \"I would love Pitch Perfect to be made. I believe they have a script in development.\n\n\"I think someone should get married, maybe me and Bumper (Adam DeVine).\"\n\nRebel appeared in all three movies, Pitch Perfect (2012), Pitch Perfect 2 (2015), and Pitch Perfect 3 (2017) as eccentric character Fat Amy, alongside the likes of Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Skylar Astin, Adam DeVine, Elizabeth Banks and Ben Platt.\n\nThe first movie, which earned $115.4 million at the box office worldwide, follows an all-female a cappella group called the Barden Bellas as they compete to win the Nationals.\n\nSet three years later, Pitch Perfect 2 follows on the story as the Baden Bellas find themselves involved in a national scandal, following Fat Amy ripping her pants infront of American President Barack Obama.\n\nThe final instalment is then set another three years later, with all of the Barden Bellas having graduated from college and working in the real world. With all of the girls hating their day jobs, they decide to reunite for a final performance, competing at the USO tour headlined by DJ Khaled.\n\nEver since the last movie's release in 2017, fans have been calling out for a fourth instalment, but up until now, there's been no word.\n\nIt does sound like mum-of-one Rebel is still great friends with her co-stars, saying: \"We had the best time, it was just like having fun with your friends. Me and all the girls talk about it all the time.\n\n\"We’re busy but they can pay us to come together!\"\n\nDespite Rebel's tease, there's been no official word on Pitch Perfect 4 just yet.\n\nCheck out the biggest films dropping and their release dates:\n\nNow read:\n\nBridget Jones 4 confirmed for 2025 release with Renée Zellweger\n\nSee Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga in the Joker: Folie à Deux teaser trailer\n\nPierce Brosnan shares his thoughts on Aaron Taylor-Johnson as possible James Bond\n\nHow to listen to Hits Radio:\n\nTurn it up with Hits Radio!
