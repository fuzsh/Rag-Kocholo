        "text": "3K\n\n“Pitch Perfect 2″ is a great example of how good movie sequels can be.\n\nThe first movie, made back in 2012, became one of the most popular movies of the early 21st century, bringing the younger generations in with the music and the older generations in with the humour. Starring in the sequel are the usual cast members, including Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Rebel Wilson, Ester Dean and Anna Camp, who makes a special appearance. New cast members Hailee Steinfeld and Chrissie Fit play new members Emily and Mercedes, and Fit steals many of the scenes with her witty one liners. The sequel follows the Bellas after a horrendous performance in front of President Obama. In order to redeem themselves and secure their place as a competition group. To accomplish this, the girls travel to Denmark to compete in the World Acapella Competition, where if they win, they will be able to keep the group running.\n\nThe beginning of the movie is a perfect draw-in for audiences, bringing back the catchy acapella version of the Universal theme song, leading into a hysterical performance by the Barden Bellas, which start their journey of redemption. Following the first movies footsteps, the arrangements that the Bellas sing are filled with songs that are currently on the Top 40 lists. Rebel Wilson gets incredible one liners once again, which all made the audience laugh out loud. Anna Kendrick’s awkward quirkiness shines through the entire film, as she encounters the German team and even at her producing internship. She has always been able to bring herself into every role that she plays, and Becca truly allows her to have fun within her uncomfortable nature.\n\nHowever, the ending performance at the World Competition, is nothing close to the first movie’s ending arrangement. It started off extremely strong, with clapping leading into Beyonce’s “Girls (Run the World).” The song continues in a fine fashion, but falls short of the incredible “Price Tag/Don’t You Forget About Me” that the Bellas killed at the end of the first film. The ending of the second movies arrangement ends with Steinfeld’s characters original song “Flashlight.” Yes, it is a smart move for the group to use an original song in their set, but it felt very disconnected and random. As an audience member, it felt as though the film-makers looked at each other and said, “We’ve had Steinfeld sing this song so much during the film… let’s just add it to the end.” If there had been a clearer transition within the set, maybe “Flashlight” would’ve worked, but there was nothing special about this song, nor the actress who sang it.\n\nOverall, Pitch Perfect 2 is a fantastic ending to such a popular movie. It’s a feel-good movie, that makes you sing in your seat and feel as if you are part of the Bellas yourself. Pitch Perfect 2 opens in theatres May 15.\n\n-Talia Edelheit"
