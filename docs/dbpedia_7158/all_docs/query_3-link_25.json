        "text": "Pitch Perfect 2 is a 2015 American musical comedy film directed and produced by Elizabeth Banks with a script from Kay Cannon. The cast of the film consists of Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Adam DeVine, Katey Sagal, Anna Camp, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, John Michael Higgins, and Banks. It serves as a sequel to the 2012 film Pitch Perfect.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on May 15, 2015 by Universal Pictures. A sequel, Pitch Perfect 3, was released on December 22, 2017.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThree years after winning the previous competition, the Barden Bellas are now led by senior Beca Mitchell and three-time super senior Chloe Beale. The Bellas have become ICCA champions each of these three years. However, the group becomes involved in a national scandal (dubbed \"Muffgate\") when Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart accidentally rips her pants in front of U.S. President Barack Obama during a performance on his birthday at the Kennedy Center, showing her genitalia to the public as she did not wear underwear. This scandal leads to the Bellas' suspension from the ICCAs. Beca makes a deal to allow the Bellas to be reinstated, should they win the World Championship of a cappella.\n\nFreshman Emily Junk begins her college career, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her mother Katherine (Kayleigh Lewinton) by being a Bella. Katherine tells Emily she is more than junk and that she is in fact Pitch Perfect. At orientation, she watches an a cappella performance by the Treblemakers, now led by Beca's boyfriend Jesse Swanson. Benjamin \"Benji\" Applebaum, Jesse's best friend, overhears Emily, leading to a crush on her.\n\nThe Bellas learn that Das Sound Machine (DSM), a German powerhouse group, have replaced the Bellas on their victory tour. Additionally, Beca has started an internship at a recording studio, Residual Heat, something only Jesse knows.\n\nEmily goes to the Bellas' sorority house to audition for them because of their absence from the auditions. When she sings her unfinished song \"Flashlight,\" she succeeds in joining the Bellas.\n\nAt a car show where the ICCA winners are due to perform, the Bellas scout their replacements, DSM, led by intimidating duo Pieter Krämer and Kommissar, who take delight in mocking the all-girl group. Later, the Bellas are invited to an exclusive riff-off against DSM. Also in attendance are the Treblemakers and the Tone Hangers (a group of former Treblemakers, including former Treblemakers leader Bumper Allen, whom Fat Amy is now dating), as well as a group calling themselves the Green Bay Packers. The Bellas make it to the final two, but end up losing to DSM in the final showdown after a nervous Emily screws up an attempt to sing \"Flashlight,\" due to it being an original song not from the right category (\"90's Hip-Hop Jamz\").\n\nThe next day at the warmups, the Bellas' chances of winning end in disaster when the performance sets Cynthia Rose Adams's hair on fire by pyrotechnics. Even before then, John and Gail question the Bellas' identity. In order to regain harmony and sync, Chloe takes them to a retreat led by former leader Aubrey Posen. Beca starts a heated debate with Chloe over herself being the only one thinking about life beyond the Bellas and Chloe's obsession with winning Worlds.\n\nTo prove to her boss that she can produce music well, Beca offers Emily to produce \"Flashlight\" at the studio. The group realizes that they will no longer be together and may go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing \"Cups (When I'm Gone)\" (the very song that got Beca into the Bellas in the first movie). Amy remembers that she broke up with Bumper, and the next day, she goes to apologize to Bumper by standing on a canoe and paddling across the lake to him while singing \"We Belong.\" Hurt, Bumper unsuccessfully tries to turn Amy away initially, but as the song progresses, he forgives her, and they reconcile. At the studio, Emily and Beca present their song to Beca's boss, in which he demonstrates envy for their talent and looks forward to producing with them.\n\nThe senior Bellas graduate and they all head off to Copenhagen for the World Finals, with Jesse and Benji to cheer them on. They perform a harmonized version of \"Flashlight\" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining in. The Bellas win the championship and repair their damaged legacy. As the senior Bellas leave Barden, they give Emily a belated proper initiation with Fat Amy showing her how to do the last tradition: christening the house by sliding down the staircase.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Bumper performs on The Voice, chooses Christina Aguilera as his coach and makes her uncomfortable when he gives her an oddly lengthy hug.\n\nCast[]\n\nThe Barden Bellas[]\n\nAnna Kendrick as Beca Mitchell\n\nBrittany Snow as Chloe Beale\n\nRebel Wilson as Fat Amy\n\nHana Mae Lee as Lilly Onakuramara\n\nAlexis Knapp as Stacie Conrad\n\nEster Dean as Cynthia Rose Adams\n\nHailee Steinfeld as Emily Junk\n\nChrissie Fit as Flo Fuentes\n\nKelley Jakle as Jessica\n\nShelley Regner as Ashley\n\nAdditonal characters[]\n\nSkyler Astin as Jesse Swanson\n\nAdam DeVine as Bumper Allen\n\nAnna Camp as Aubrey Posen\n\nBen Platt as Benji Applebaum\n\nBirgitte Hjort Sørensen as Kommissar\n\nFlula Borg as Pieter Krämer\n\nKatey Sagal as Katherine Junk\n\nJohn Michael Higgins as John Smith\n\nElizabeth Banks as Gail Abernathy-McKadden-Feinberger\n\nKeegan-Michael Key as Sammy\n\nShawn Carter Peterson as Dax\n\nDavid Cross (credited as Sir Willups Brightlysmore) as the Riff-Off host\n\nReggie Watts, John Hodgman, Jason Jones, and Joe Lo Truglio as Tone Hanger singers\n\nPentatonix as Team Canada\n\nPenn Masala as Team India\n\nFilharmonic as Team Philippines\n\nGreen Bay Packers players Clay Matthews, David Bakhtiari, Don Barclay, Josh Sitton and T.J.
