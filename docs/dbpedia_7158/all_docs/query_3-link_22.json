I think the reason I'm most excited about this is: especially if you've watched the movie a second time, you can feel how much more is there with all of these characters (not to mention how many brilliant scenes/jokes of Kay Cannon's they probably ran out of room for). And that, my friends, is when it's the right time to get the band back together. Literally, in this case. Just to refresh everybody on where we left off at the end of the movie: Beca and Jesse were presumably back together, Benji had gotten his due onstage, and the Bellas were reigning champs, auditioning newbies for next semester. I'm pulling for Adam Devine to drop in whenever he gets a few days off from singing backup for John Mayer (perhaps to romance Rebel?), as well as more Hana Mae Lee, please! But hopefully no dastardly return of the ultimate",
