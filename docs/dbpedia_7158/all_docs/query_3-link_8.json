        "text": "Rebel's career started on the Sydney stages in the early 2000's where she often wrote and produced her own work. This led to various television shows in Australia where she quickly became the most prominent female voice in Australian comedy. In 2008, Rebel wrote, produced and starred in her own musical television series Bogan Pride for SBS. In 2010 Rebel moved to the US with her role in the cult classic Bridesmaids. Rebel is perhaps most known internationally for playing the role of 'Fat Amy' in the Pitch Perfect trilogy, which are the highest-grossing musical comedy films of all time. Rebel's other feature credits include the Academy Award-winning Jojo Rabbit, Isn't It Romantic, How To Be Single, and The Hustle. In 2022 she starred in the hit cheer leading comedy Senior Year on Netflix which was watched by over 89 million unique Netflix accounts in its first ten days of release internationally. This year Rebel's memoir Rebel Rising instantly became a New York Times (US), Sunday Times (UK) and Australian best-seller. Rebel is an alumni and now patron of The Australian Theatre for Young People whose home base in Sydney is called 'The Rebel Theatre', named after her. The inaugural production in this theatre was a workshop production of The Deb which originated out of Wilson's annual scholarship program that aims to mentor emerging young Australian talent. Rebel has now turned The Deb into a feature film which marks her directorial debut. She also co-wrote and produced the film, is a contributing songwriter and co-stars as the town's villainous hairdresser 'Janette.' Rebel will next be seen in the action comedy Bride Hard with recent Oscar winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph, directed by Simon West.\n\nHailee Steinfeld was born on December 11, 1996 in Tarzana, California, to Cheri (Domasin), an interior designer, and Peter Steinfeld, a personal fitness trainer. She has a brother, Griffin. Her uncle is Jake Steinfeld, a fitness trainer, and her great-uncle is actor Larry Domasin. Her father is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and her mother's ancestry is Filipino, African-American, British Isles, and German. Hailee was raised in Thousand Oaks, California.\n\nAt an early age, she appeared in several short films to gain experience. She played the role of Talia Alden in She's a Fox (2009), which received several awards. Her debut in a feature film for theater was True Grit - Vergeltung (2010). She played a major role, Mattie Ross, with Jeff Bridges, Josh Brolin, and Matt Damon. She got big attention for her performance in this movie, and she was nominated for the 'Best Supporting Actress' Academy Award. After a short break, she appeared in several films which were released in 2013. She played the role of Juliet in Shakespeare's Romeo & Julia (2013), which also starred Douglas Booth, and was released in 2013. Also, she appeared in Ender's Game - Das große Spiel (2013) as Petra Arkanian, based on the book written by Orson Scott Card, and this movie was directed by Gavin Hood.

Hailee says she is very interested to be on the other side of camera and would like to eventually produce and direct.\n\nEster Renay Dean is an American Singer, Actress and Grammy Award Nominated Songwriter.\n\nBorn in Muskogee, Oklahoma, and raised in Tulsa, Ester is the youngest of five children and was raised in a single mother, low-income household. At a young age she learned how to channel her pain into music, using creative writing as a kind of self-therapy. When she was 15 her mother moved Ester and her sister Deandria to Omaha, Nebraska, leaving her older siblings in Tulsa. The separation made Ester again dig deeper for a connection, drawing her closer to the music. Singing in every studio, writing for local Omaha rappers and producers, Ester unknowingly grass-rooted herself and learned the ins and outs of music production.\n\nAt 20 yrs old, Ester made a bold move. She packed her bags and left Omaha with only $500 in her pocket and drove 18 hours alone to Atlanta, Georgia determined to break into the music industry. She sang for anyone who would listen. As fate would have it, Ester sat alone backstage at a Charlie Wilson concert, humming a tune to herself. When music producer Tricky Stewart happened by and heard her, he immediately set up a meeting. Caught unawares by Ester's talent, he was blown away when she played him some samples of not only her singing, but also of her excellent songs. He signed her to a small publishing deal that allowed the fledgling artist to grow and connect with other known writers and producers.\n\nEster broke into the big leagues when she collaborated with Norwegian record producers, Stargate and major label recording artist, Rihanna to write and record Ester's first #1 hit song \"Rude Boy\". Going on to write \"What's My Name\", \"Where Have You Been\" and several other Rihanna hits, Katie Perry's \"Firework\" and Nicki Minaj's \"Superbass\", as well many, many other hits by a Who's Who of contemporary popular artists has earned her the well-deserved nickname, \"Ester Dean the Song Machine\".\n\nModern popular songs are often a collaborative effort by a songwriting team, with each member responsible for a different aspect of the song, such as the initial beat, chord structure, lyrics, etc. Ester Dean has established a reputation as a master of the top line or \"hook\" of a song. Her preferred method is to go into the vocal booth and start improvising over top of the beat, knowing she is onto something when she starts to feel \"a little chill\" go up her arms.\n\nEsters goals and dreams did not stop there. In 2012 Esther set out to conquer the voice-over world, lending her voice to the hugely popular Blue Sky Studios, Ice Age Franchise, in Continental Drift. As well as in the CG animated Fox film, Rio.\n\nIn addition voice-over work, Esther has also contributed to movie soundtracks. When she was approached to write the end title song, Let it Grow for the movie The Lorax, Ester somehow managed to write and deliver the song within five hours of receiving the request. Impressing all with her amazing work ethic, Ester was eventually asked to audition for a small role in an upcoming movie about an all-girl a capella group. She jumped at the chance and landed the role of Cynthia Rose in the hit movie Pitch Perfect, going on to co-star in Pitch Perfect 2 and 3.\n\n\"Entertaining is what I love to do. From writing fun songs to make you dance. To singing a love song to make you fall in love. Being silly on the TV screen to make you laugh. To delivering a great line of dialog in a drama to make you cry. My life is all about connecting with people. Hoping to make the world feel like we are all one beating heart if only for second\".......Ester Dean\n\nKelley Jakle is an actress and singer/songwriter from Sacramento, CA.\n\nAs the only girl in a family with two older brothers, Kelley held her own playing competitive soccer, basketball and swimming. However, it was acting and singing that eventually consumed her interest, beginning with The Sacramento Children's Chorus. She soon started giving impromptu performances of the National Anthem at swim meets and local parades, which turned into solo performances for the Sacramento River Cats and the NBA's Sacramento Kings. After competing against hundreds of contestants from around the country, Kelley was also selected to sing in front of thousands of fans and a national television audience for the SF 49ers.\n\nIn high school, Kelley starred in stage productions that varied from satirical comedies such as Urinetown (as Hope Cladwell) and The Princess Bride (as Princess Buttercup), to poignant and thought-provoking works like The Laramie Project (as Catherine Connolly). Her music development flourished, as she wrote songs inspired by the likes of Andrew McMahon, Michelle Branch and Sheryl Crow, while accompanying herself on the piano. By her junior year Kelley produced her first self-titled CD, Spare Change, containing five original songs. This was followed by a self-titled album with her band, By the Way.\n\nAs the founder of her high school a cappella group, it was no surprise when Kelley chose to attend the University of Southern California and become a member of the SoCal VoCals - USC's premiere a cappella group. The VoCals won the coveted International Competition of collegiate Acappella in New York City twice during her time in the group.\n\nThe national television spotlight soon found Kelley when the SoCals were chosen to appear on the first season of the NBC vocal competition series, \"The Sing-Off\". Kelley was back again for season two, this time making it to the finals a member of the Backbeats, a group comprised of vocal performers from USC, UCLA and BYU.\n\nAfter graduating with honors, Kelley remains in Los Angeles pursuing a career in music as well as in television and film.

He was educated at Tonbridge School and trained in acting at the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain. He studied English Literature at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Whilst he was a Cambridge undergraduate, he acted in several student drama productions. He played the title role in the Marlowe Dramatic Society's production of William Shakespeare's play, \"Macbeth\". This was staged at the Cambridge Arts Theatre from Tuesday 26th February to Saturday 2nd March 2002. The cast also featured Rebecca Hall in the roles of Lady Macbeth and Hecate. During one of his university summer holidays in August 2003 he went to Slovakia where he filmed his scenes for the Hallmark production of Die Kreatur - Gehasst & gejagt (2004). Dan played the part of Henry Clerval and the mini-series was first broadcast on American television on 5th October 2004. Shortly after graduating from Cambridge Dan was nominated for an Ian Charleson award for his performance as Orlando in \"As You Like It\" at the Rose Theatre at Kingston in Surrey. \"As You Like It\" was directed by Peter Hall and ran from 30th November to 18th December 2004. This production for the Peter Hall Company subsequently went on a tour of America in the early months of 2005, playing at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, the Curran Theater in San Francisco and the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City. It featured Rebecca Hall in the role of Rosalind.\n\nDan was reunited with the director Peter Hall when he played Claudio in a new production of the Shakespeare play, \"Much Ado About Nothing\", for the Peter Hall Company at the Theatre Royal in Bath from 29th June to 6th August 2005. In February 2006 Dan played the parts of Marban and Maitland in a revival of Howard Brenton's controversial play, \"The Romans in Britain\", directed by Samuel West at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Then in May 2006 he played Nick Guest, the protagonist in Die Schönheitslinie (2006). This three part television mini-series was adapted by Andrew Davies from the 2004 Booker prize winning novel by Alan Hollinghurst. Die Schönheitslinie (2006) is about Nick Guest's relationship with his university friend Toby Fedden. The story takes place in the 1980s. It is set against the backdrop of Margaret Thatcher's free market economic policies and the spread of the acquired immunity deficiency syndrome, (AIDS). These two social developments directly affect the characters in the story because Toby's father Gerald is a Conservative member of parliament and Nick is homosexual.\n\nWhilst Die Schönheitslinie (2006) was being broadcast on BBC television, Dan was appearing as Simon Bliss in the Noël Coward play, \"Hay Fever\". This play was staged at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London from 11th April to 5th August 2006 and the cast also included Judi Dench in the role of Judith Bliss. At the end of the year Dan played Lord Holmwood in a television dramatization of Dracula (2006), which was broadcast on 28th December 2006. In 2007 Dan played the part of Michael Faber in Nemesis (2007), an Agatha Christie adaptation with Geraldine McEwan in the role of Miss Jane Marple. He also featured in the cast of Maxwell (2007), a television drama about the famous newspaper magnate. Maxwell (2007) was first broadcast on British television on 4th May 2007. David Suchet played Robert Maxwell, and Dan took the part of Basil Brookes, one of the press baron's financial directors.\n\nDan played the part of Edward Ferrars in a television dramatization of Jane Austen's novel, Sinn und Sinnlichkeit (2008). This was broadcast in three episodes on BBC1 between Tuesday 1st and Sunday 13th January 2008. The novel was adapted for television by Andrew Davies, whom Dan had previously worked with on Die Schönheitslinie (2006). Davies felt that the part of Edward Ferrars was underdeveloped in the book, and so he deliberately added scenes not included in the novel to help draw out the character. So, for instance, we saw Edward out horse riding on the Norland estate and chopping logs at Barton Cottage. In the DVD audio commentary Dan joked that this was the best example of log chopping ever seen on British television! After Sinn und Sinnlichkeit (2008), Dan featured in the cast of \"The Tennis Court\", a BBC Radio 4 Saturday play broadcast on 19th January 2008. He also played Nicky Lancaster in a revival of the Noël Coward play, \"The Vortex\", at the Apollo Theatre in London from Wednesday 20th February to Saturday 7th June 2008. This was another collaboration with the stage director, Peter Hall. Dan played the eponymous hero of \"Dickens Confidential\", a six part radio drama series set in the 1830s which imagines what might have happened if Charles Dickens had continued his career as a journalist. This was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between Monday 9th June and Monday 14th July 2008. He played the part of Peregrine in 'Orley Farm', the BBC Radio 4 Classic Serial. This was a three part adaptation of the novel by Anthony Trollope broadcast between Sunday 28th December 2008 and Sunday 11th January 2009. A month later he played Duval in the BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour drama, 'The Lady of the Camellias'. This was broadcast between Monday 2nd and Friday 6th February 2009.\n\nDebby Ryan was born in Huntsville, Alabama on May 13, 1993, but she and her family moved to Texas when she was a small child and lived there for five years before moving to Wiesbaden, Germany.
