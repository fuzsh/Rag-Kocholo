They are preforming in an a cappella competition, two commentators mention how hard it is for all female groups to win these competitions because they cannot hit low-key notes. The Bellas who wear uniform costumes that make them look like flight attendants, sing tradition songs by female artists. The leader of the group criticizes a late Aubrey and reminds her not to mess up or else. Aubrey of course ends up vomiting on stage.\n\nWords flash on the bottom of the screen to info us that it is four months later. It then proceeds to introduce the protagonist, Beca, who is mixing music on her laptop before getting into a cab that will take her to Barden University. As she gets her luggage from the back of the cab she hears a guy singing in the car next to her, this is the audience’s first glimpse at Beca’s love interest. Beca enter’s her dorm room to find an unsociable roommate. Her father then enters the room and introduces himself as a Professor from the University. We then learn that it is his decision, not hers, to be at this University. She wishes to be in L.A. already working on her D.J. career. After a few more tense moments between father and daughter she leaves to check out the student activity fair.\n\nJesse, Beca’s soon to be love interest, meets his roommate Benji, who is really into magic and illusions. They, unlike Beca and her roommate, like each other and also go to check out the student activities.\n\nBeca soon meets Aubrey and Chloe who are the new leaders of The Bellas, she listens to what they do but rejects their offer to tryout by saying she doesn’t sing. Benji and Jesse meet The Trebblemakers, who are Barden’s all male a cappella group and reigning in the National Championship as well as The Bellas rivals.\n\nBeca meets Jesse at the University’s radio station where they will be both working. Jesse is obviously immediately interested thought it seems that Beca isn’t really. A month passes and her father enters her dorm angry that she is skipping class and makes a deal that if she joins a club, and really tries for at least a year and still hates it, he will support her decision to go to L.A. Beca agrees to the terms. She is later taking a shower in the dorm’s community bathroom when Chloe, one of The Bella’s a cappella leaders, hears her and forces her to acknowledge that she can sing, then proceeds to invite her to the a cappella tryout.\n\nNext is the auditions where everyone performs Kelly Clarkson’s “Since You’ve Been Gone”. Beca who comes in late and unprepared is allowed to sing another song and impresses Chloe once again though Aubrey seems unsure. Both the Trebles and The Bellas make their choices and induct the new members of their group. Jesse feels bad that Benji was not accepted in. The groups then hold a party to celebrate their new recruits and a new year. Next day two Bellas are kicked out for sleeping with Trebblemakers.\n\nThe Bellas begin to practice, Beca immediately notices that most of the songs are no longer popular with younger crowds and Aubery’s need for control is also beginning to be obvious. She demands cardio and intense dance and singing practices. They perform at a Frat party but are so boring that they are asked to leave. Aubrey begins to criticize them and then turns on her co-leader Chloe, who unhappily informs them all that she has “nodes” or vocal cord nodules, which are very painful and harmful to a singer.\n\nDespite the fact that they are in rival a cappella groups, Jesse and Beca begin to form a friendship. Jesse discusses his love for movies and his dream to produce the music score in movies. Beca admits that she never really watches films because the ending according to her are predictable. He is appalled claiming the endings are the best and swears to educate her in film and then asks if her group is ready for the “Riff Off”, a contest where each of the a cappella groups perform mash-ups of songs. The Trebblemakers are on a role until Beca interrupts and steals the show. Though the girls still loose due to a technicality that is possibly created just to get them out, it is clear that they were the crowd favorite.\n\nJesse begins Beca’s movie education, he picks the film The Breakfast Club. The Bellas continue to practice and it becomes clear that Chloe can no longer sing the solo role, she wants Beca to sing for her. Beca agrees but only if they change up the music, Aubrey refuses and Fat Amy gets to sing the solo. On their way to regional the girls stop their bus to get gas, The Trebblemakers pass by and see Fat Amy, Bumper throws a huge burrito at her. In her shock and anger she forgets to put gas in the bus and they end up calling The Trebblemakers for a ride. They perform at the regional barely getting second place to take them to the semifinals. After the competition some of the Trebblemakers, including Jesse, get into a fight with a few alumni’s. Beca jumps in to help Jess out and accidentally breaks a window. She is then arrested and bailed out. Beca at first thinks Jesse bailed her out but angrily realizes that he called her father. She returns to her dorm where the rest of the Bellas are waiting for her.\n\nAt the semifinals, Beca notices that the judges are falling asleep during their music and daringly begins to sing “Bulletproof” into their song. It gets the judges attention however the girls do not make it to the finals and take it out on Beca. Jesse tries to help but Beca angrily pushes him away and quits the Bellas. Benji notices that the main singer for the group who won second place is holding a high school bag.\n\nBeca is now pretty much alone, though she tries to apologize to Jesse he tells her that he’s tired of her pushing him away and refuses to speak with her. She watches The Breakfast Club in its entirety and seeks out her dad for advice. She also admits that she knows she pushes people away though she isn’t sure why. It seems that Benji’s suspicions of the rivals main singer is correct and that he is indeed a high school student. His group is disqualified from the competition and the Bellas are back in. All of them receive the news, Chloe gets it while she is in the hospital and passes it on to Beca.\n\nThe Bellas meet up for rehearsal all missing Beca, and agreeing that maybe they need to mashup their performance. After a massive fight breaks out and an incident with vomit, Beca shows up and apologizes. The girls realize that they don’t really know each other and decide to tell everyone some truths. Aubrey then asks Beca for help to create a mashup for the finals. They all begin to work together and Chloe learns that she can hit the low notes each female group is unable to perform.\n\nMeanwhile, Bumper, the Trebbles main singer has been hired to tour as back up for John Mayer and abandons their group. Unsure what to do Jesse gets Benji to take Bumpers place.\n\nThe Trebbles perform amazingly at the Finals and the Bellas show up in new outfits that mix the original outfit with something that represents themselves. They do a mashup of songs the main being the featured song in The Breakfast Club, “Don’t You (Forget About Me). Which is obviously for Jesse who happily shares a Judd Nelson fist pump with Beca and makes up with her at the end with the end of the movie kiss.\n\nThe final scene is at the next years auditions where we learn that the girls did win the Finals and get to pick the song for tryout.\n\nCommentary\n\nOne of the most intriguing things about this movie is how much of the music and sound used is a cappella. In this audition scene, editor used a number of techniques of film editing to create a multitude of overlapping and montage a cappella sounds that created a diegetic, asynchronous rendition of Kelly Clarkson’s “Since You’ve Been Gone.”\n\nThis scene is edited by using multiple shots as split scenes, parallel editing, intercutting, jump cuts and even a moment of montage images/scenes of various audition shots so that the audience is aware that each part of the music is a cappella and that it takes more than just synchronized singing to re-create the whole song in its entirety music and all.\n\nThe film uses a lot of repetition and familiar images to foreshadow the changes that will need to take place/happen so that a cappella group successfully obtain their goal. The first moment of foreshadowing is in the beginning scene when the commentators at the a cappella competition mention that it is hard for all women groups to win because they cannot hit low keys. This leads to, probably the most obvious use of repetition, Snow’s character who is diagnosed with vocal cord nodules. The audience is made aware of her condition, it is brought up again when she begins to struggle with her solo and it is given to some one else, we then see Snow in the hospital, obviously getting surgery to take of the problem, and once again to her confessing that she can not sing higher than G to realizing that she can now provide the low-key that is typically missing in all women a cappella groups.\n\nThe familiar image of computerized music that Beca mash-ups, is used in various ways throughout the film. This image allows us to see a bit of Beca’s character as well as give the audience an understanding that the a cappella group needs to create something “new” or “re-mix” their performance so that they have a chance to win the final competition.\n\nA second use of repetition is the John Hughes movie Breakfast Club, this repetition deals more with the romantic aspect of the comedy. Beca’s love interest introduces her to the film, after the “split” between the characters she spots the soundtrack of the movie, watches it alone and then at the finale uses the music featured in the Breakfast Club, “Don’t You (Forget About Me)”, to ‘get the guy’ which results in success as they share the infamous Judd Nelson fist pump and a kiss at the end.\n\nIt is also important that to notice the change in costume in this performance compared to the others. Throughout the play the group keeps a strict dress code that is broken down and redone for the finals keeping the theme of “re-mixing.” Some important changes are with Anna Camp’s character Aubrey who has the hardest time allowing any form of change happen. She is the one who keeps closest to the tradition idea of the Bella’s costume though by the end of this scene she has finally ‘let her hair down’. Each character keeps the scarf that represents the group in someway or another. The Protagonist Beca wears a brighter blue that the others that makes her stand out, and some of the other supporting characters are dressed in a way that represents them."
