        "text": "LOS ANGELES â€” How do the Barden Bellas plan to pitch-slap the box office again?\n\nThey started with boot camp. Before cameras ever rolled on Pitch Perfect 2 (in theaters Friday), Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow and the rest of the Bellas subbed trust falls and campfires with vocal warm-ups and sheet music.\n\n\"You normally split up the day between choreography and singing,\" says Wilson, who deadpans winningly as Fat Amy in the a cappella-fueled sequel. \"And we also do some cardio and physical training just so we're getting in shape for the film.\"\n\nFat Amy quickly became a crowd favorite in the 2012 original, thanks to the Australian comedian's comic chops. Wilson arrived in the USA in 2010 and made her mark as Kristen Wiig's ridiculous roommate in Bridesmaids before stealing scenes in Pitch Perfect with a blend of bravado, crude jokes and vocal chops.\n\nWilson admits to being \"really worried\" going into the sequel. \"I felt a lot of the weight of the comic expectations on me and Fat Amy,\" she says. \"And I really did want to make it as good as the first one.\"\n\nRentrak senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian compares Pitch Perfect, a surprise box office success, to the Austin Powers phenomenon. Both were \"a modest hit the first go-round in theaters and then came a massive hit on home video,\" he says, predicting Pitch Perfect 2 will give the R-rated Mad Max: Fury Road a run for its money this weekend.\n\n\"The first Pitch Perfect really did change my life,\" says Wilson. After Bridesmaids, \"people started to know me but I could still go to Trader Joe's in my sweatpants. But when Pitch Perfect came out, that's when you had paparazzi outside your house. I get recognized now everywhere I go.\"\n\nPitch Perfect 2 catches up with the Barden Bellas three years later. Now established pros, the seniors are performing for the president of the United States. (Here's an aca-tip: Look for a Shonda Rhimes cameo in the opening scene.) Cue Fat Amy, triumphantly spinning from the ceiling wrapped in Cirque du Soleil-like trapeze silks. And then her pants split.\n\n\"I know I make jokes but I trained very hard to be able to do that,\" says Wilson, eyes wide. \"There was nothing below. It was cold concrete if I fell.\"\n\nThe pressure is on, too, for star Elizabeth Banks, who directs the sequel. Wilson says she's grateful Banks let her \"do my thing\" on set; she estimates that half of Fat Amy's jokes are improvised.\n\n\"Fat Amy resonates as a character because she is devoid of self-consciousness,\" Banks says. \"That's a tribute to both Rebel's fearlessness and intelligence.\"\n\nAnd Fat Amy's love life is on center stage when her former hookup, Bumper (Adam DeVine), makes a play for more."
