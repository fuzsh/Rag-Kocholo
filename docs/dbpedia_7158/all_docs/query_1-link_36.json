        "text": "Can you aca-believe that Pitch Perfect came out 10 years ago?\n\nDirected by Jason Moore, the 2012 musical comedy introduced viewers to the fascinating world of competitive collegiate a cappella. Anna Kendrick stars as Beca Mitchell, a new freshman student at Barden University and aspiring DJ. Though she has no real interest in college, she strikes a deal with her dad to give this first year a try. She soon gets roped into successfully auditioning for the Barden Bellas, the school's all-female a cappella group, helmed by uptight Aubrey (Anna Camp) and friendly Chloe (Brittany Snow).\n\nThe previous year, the Bellas suffered an embarrassing defeat at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella to their all-male rival group, the Barden Treblemakers. Aubrey is determined for the group to regain its reputation but insists on keeping the same dated setlist, while Beca pushes to add modern tunes into the mix. As the Bellas prepare for the competition, Beca also finds a spark with Treblemaker Jesse (Skylar Astin) and friendship with her fellow Bellas, including confident Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart (Rebel Wilson). The film is written by Kay Cannon and is loosely adapted from Mickey Rapkin's non-fiction book, Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate a Cappella Glory.\n\nPitch Perfect received mostly positive reviews and has a Metascore of 66. The film became a cultural phenomenon thanks to its quotable dialogue and catchy mashup tunes. Three songs on the film's soundtrack charted on the Billboard Hot 100; a version of Kendrick's performance of Beca's audition song peaked at No. 6. The film's success spawned two sequels,Pitch Perfect 2(Metascore: 63) and Pitch Perfect 3 (40).\n\nTo celebrate 10 years of aca-awesomeness, Metacritic has compiled a list of more feel-good movies like Pitch Perfect.

Queen bee Regina George (Rachel McAdams) takes a shine to Cady, but the newcomer quickly finds herself in over her head when she gets caught up in the quest for popularity. The film became a pop culture phenomenon and is often recognized as one of the most iconic high school movies of all time.\n\n\"An edgy comedy, where laughs stem at times from uncomfortable situations.

After a misunderstanding with a college recruiter, Quinn Ackerman (Sabrina Carpenter) decides to audition for her school's award-winning dance team in hopes that their impressive reputation will give her an extra edge. After she gets rejected, she forms her own eclectic dance team and begins training for the popular annual Work It competition, enlisting the help of her talented best friend Jasmine (Liza Koshy) and Jake (Jordan Fisher), a former elite dancer who stopped competing after a bad injury.\n\n\"The expectations of the genre provide a framework for Work It that both delights (so many dancing montages! all of them fun!) and confounds (a chemistry-less romance). When it dares to break those boxes, however, things get miles more interesting.\" — Kate Erbland, IndieWire\n\nBring It On\n\nMetascore: 52\n\nBest for: Fans of female-fronted teen comedies and movies about competitions\n\nWhere to watch:\n\n, Google Play,\n\nRuntime: 98 minutes\n\nMuch like Pitch Perfect, Bring It On also features a group of girls preparing for a team competition — only in this case, they're competitive cheerleaders. Kirsten Dunst stars as Torrance Shipman, the new captain of her San Diego high school cheerleading squad, the Toros. She faces immense pressure to help the Toros bring home their sixth consecutive national title. However, she soon learns that the previous captain stole all their highly successful routines from the East Compton Clovers, who are captained by Isis (Gabrielle Union). Often recognized as a cult classic, the 2000 Peyton Reed-directed film explores themes about cultural appropriation as it follows Torrance's journey to nationals and inspired quite a few sequels.\n\n\"Succeeds in displaying the physical drive and demands of cheerleading.\" — Robert Koehler, Variety"
