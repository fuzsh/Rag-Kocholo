        "text": "Here’s some aca-mazing news for Pitch Perfect fans: following the sequel’s impressive $160.9 million gross at domestic box offices, the studios behind the film are pursuing a third installment of the series.\n\nUniversal Pictures and Gold Circle Films are negotiating with screenwriter Kay Cannon, who wrote the first two movies, about coming back for a third, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThough star Rebel Wilson has been vocal about her willingness to reprise her role as the hilarious Fat Amy, the involvement of other Pitch Perfect players is up in the air. Before Pitch Perfect 2 hit theaters, star Anna Kendrick told TIME she wasn’t focusing on her future with the franchise. “I’m not one to count my chickens, so I just want to see how this one does and find out if there’s an appetite for that before I even think about it,” she said.\n\nAnd while there’s also no word about whether Elizabeth Banks, who stepped into the director’s chair for the sequel, would return, she must be thrilled with its success given the dearth of blockbusters helmed by women directors. “I felt ready and wanted to do it of course, but I also felt like once I said yes, I couldn’t screw it up,” she told TIME recently. “There was definitely that pressure. It is very rare, and because it’s rare, I unfortunately—whether I like it or not—am taking on a role here.”"
