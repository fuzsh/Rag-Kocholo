        "text": "Name: Deke Sharon\n\nTwitter: @dekesharon\n\nBest known for: being “the father of contemporary a capella”, promoting the singing style around the world, and bringing it to the big screen in smash hit musical comedy Pitch Perfect.\n\nMore like this\n\nBasically, he gave the world THIS. Bow down.\n\nBio: Born and raised in San Francisco, California, Deke Sharon is all about singing. He’s been making music with his mouth since he was just eight years old, having toured North America sharing the stage with the likes of Pavarotti.\n\nWhilst at university he was determined to make a capella cool again and began working on a new dense vocal-instrumental sound that we now come to associate with the term.\n\nThe man can actually teach you how to sing like an instrument. It’s pretty cool.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-utZM_PUf8?ecver=1\n\nOver the past few years he’s been working as a producer on a show called The Sing-Off, which sees a capella groups going head to head in spectacular TV sing-offs. He’s also worked with some major players in the field and is a big supporter of a capella music group Pentatonix.\n\nAnd yes, as you may have gathered, he’s the Arranger, on-site Music Director and Vocal Producer for the Pitch Perfect movies. So basically you have him to thank for Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson’s cracking cinematic antics.\n\nHe won’t be judging the acts, but he will be sharing some feedback and arranging their big musical numbers at the start of each show."
