        "text": "Ever wish your favorite song would never end? Instead of replaying it on an endless loop, try diving into the stories behind the songs. Welcome back to the Breadcrumb Trail! In this edition, we take a look at the tales that go into making our favorite tunes, as well as the power of music to affect us and shape the stories of our lives.\n\nWhen listening to a talented musician, what can often go unrecognized is the tremendous effort and practice necessary to make them sound so good. Often this education takes place at a specialized school where intense training and nerve-wracking performances are the norm.\n\nLooking at the lighter side of learning music, the 2012 film Pitch Perfect follows college freshman Beca, played by Anna Kendrick, who begins her journey into the drama-filled world of a cappella. Reluctantly entering college, Beca only wants to pursue her passion as a DJ. Rather than study, she spends her time making mash-ups of her favorite songs and interning at the school radio station. When she is overheard singing in the shower, she is enlisted to join the Barden Bellas, the all-female a cappella troupe. Here she meets the other members, made up of classic stock characters typified by college and high school films.\n\nAs she learns to navigate her way through the drama and politics of the group who are seeking to beat the all-male troupe, the Barden Treblemakers, at this year’s competition, after an embarrassing defeat at the previous contest, Beca’s new ideas about what songs the group should perform get her in hot water. But as the group and the audience comes to love the mash-up styles she favors, enemies become friends on stage and off.\n\nLoosely based on a biography of a collegiate a cappella group, Pitch Perfect is part musical, part comedy, and part classic college flick. Filled with a star-studded ensemble cast the film is a dazzling display of singing and performance as well as a story of how music can bring together even the most opposing personalities.\n\nWhere Pitch Perfect looks at the struggles to perform through a heartfelt and humorous angle, the 2014 picture Whiplash tells a much darker tale. Following another first-year student, Andrew, played by Miles Teller, at a prestigious music conservatory in New York City, the story revolves around his relationship with his abusive yet inspiring teacher and conductor of the school’s highest jazz band, played by J.K. Simmons. Dreaming of becoming one of the greats like his hero Buddy Rich, Andrew is a drummer who only wants to play with the best. After being overheard in a practice room late at night, he is invited to try out for the top jazz band.\n\nOnce a part of the band, Andrew learns the hard way how to become great at the hands of Terence Fletcher, the cruel perfectionist conductor of the group. An intensely dislikable character, Fletcher berates his students into playing better or quitting in tears, justifying his style as a way to motivate his students and weed out those who don’t have what it takes, namely an all-consuming obsession for talent. He uses the story of Charlie Parker, a legendary jazz saxophonist, who became so after a band leader threw a cymbal at his head. Miles is determined to rise to the occasion through any means necessary, leading to fractured relationships, a traumatic accident, and eventual withdrawal from the school and drumming. The film ends with his and Fletcher’s reunion, initially in conflict but brought together in the end through music.\n\nThe film received the Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor for J.K. Simmons portrayal of the terrifying teacher Terence Fletcher, as well as Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing, both earned for displaying the hectic and wild patterns of jazz with special emphasis on close-up shots of instruments.\n\nAfter learning to play and getting some gigs, the next and most difficult part of being in a band is getting a record deal. It can seem like luck or even fate that some bands should be discovered while other great acts never break through. In her book A Visit from the Goon Squad, Jennifer Egan tells the disparate stories of those connected to record executive Bennie Salazar. Spanning generations, from Bennie’s days in an upstart punk band, to his top of the world executive office in downtown L.A., and many characters the he knows or are only related through a string of others. Egan’s novel tells humorous and heartfelt stories about different facets of the music industry and those closely related.\n\nOne chapter follows Bennie in his earliest days of trying to get in a band and falling under the influence of an older, cooler record producer. Another chapter finds this producer on his deathbed in his luxury mansion, once the site of outrageous parties and now nearly desolate. An entire chapter consists of a PowerPoint on silences in music, laid out in presentation style that note songs that the narrator found particularly moving, calculating time of break versus emotional impact, interspersed with funny commentary on her family in pie charts and bar graphs.\n\nAnother chapter is an article on a movie star whom the interviewer finds so uninteresting he is forced to lash out and assault her just to get a story. The interview is written from jail and the interviewer plays a role in another chapter after he is released and tasked with writing about the career revival of an aged rock star. Like Egan’s other work, The Candy House, the novel is humorous and insightful, delving into family and relationship issues, tragedy and the will to live on that can only be captured in a work that spans decades. It even features characters from The Candy House, placing both works in the same universe, allowing the reader to trace the evolution of characters over multiple works.\n\nOften listening to music can open a whole world of memories inside us, connecting the past to the present through a single song. This is the premise for Haruki Murakami’s novel Norwegian Wood, named after the Beatles song. After Toru, the narrator, hears a muzak rendition of the song on an airplane he finds himself driven to write down the story of his relationships in college, namely with his friend Naoko and their connection through their deceased best friend, Kizuki.\n\nInseparable in high school, the friends’ lives change drastically after Kizuki commits suicide. To cope, Toru and Naoko bond over long walks and sharing silence. But when they attend different universities they become estranged, Toru leading a life of an anti-social outcast and Naoko suffering a nervous breakdown, eventually moving into a sanitarium in the mountains. While at school in the city, Toru enjoys his solitude, spending most of his time reading and taking aimless walks. He is uninterested in school life and the civil upheavals on campus. His few connections to others are his womanizing friend Nagasama, with whom he goes out drinking, and Midori a classmate who becomes Toru’s girlfriend, though he still harbors feelings for Naoko.\n\nAfter Naoko moves to the mountain retreat to focus on her mental health, Toru often visits her, also finding the remote landscape healing. He meets her roommate, an older woman who teaches piano and plays guitar. It is her renditions of Beatles songs that becomes in immovable memory for Toru as he reflects back on his life filled with sorrow, heartbreak, and love. Norwegian Wood tells the story of friends whom tragedy forced to grow up too fast, their relationships, and their struggle to overcome their sorrowful pasts.\n\nMusic can contain a world in itself, and listening can shift your mood or match it perfectly. The stories behind the music can be equally as compelling, whether in film or novels, and can create an even larger world filled with emotions and ideas unheard in the original song.\n\nDespite cultural and national differences around the world, there is one that unite these differences while celebrating the individual nations and citizens – sports. Despite the things that make us different from nation to nation, state to state, and city to city, sports bring us together under one set of rules, allowing us to showcase our pride in our home in a healthy way.\n\nWelcome back to the Breadcrumb Trail, where this month we will look at the exciting tales of sports from both the journalistic and imagined angles. Sports journalism has been around as long as sports have, allowing those who were unable to witness the game partake in the thrill of the competition. Before the advent of radio and television, sports journalists make these games available to the public at large, often giving their own commentary and insight into what happened on the field.\n\nSome journalists go so far as to put themselves in the stories, not only giving a description of the event, but relating their experience, thoughts, and opinions. Journalist and novelist Norman Mailer approached one of the biggest sporting events of the twentieth century in this manner. Not only was it one of the biggest sporting events, it was also a massive cultural happening – the boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman for the world heavyweight title in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which at the time was renamed Zaire after a revolution of independence from the French in 1971. Mailer takes his inquisitive and opinionated views to bear on the new country as well as the match that brought the attention of the world to focus on it.\n\nMailer uses his book, The Fight, to examine African culture and the burgeoning interest in it in America with the rise of the Black Power movement. He uses the two fighters as representing opposite poles – Ali as the galvanizing and vocal proponent of Black Power, and Foreman as the quiet and dedicated fighter. After hanging around Ali for a few weeks, even going on a 4 A.M. run with him, he relates the exciting fight which pits Ali’s technique against Foreman’s power. The match ends in an upset and the following day the stadium is flooded by a downpour.\n\nMuch like the Ali-Foreman fight, sports events can often coincide with a wider cultural or political milieu to give the event added weight. Possibly the biggest example of this was the Miracle on Ice at the 1980 Winter Olympics. The hockey series between the United States and the Soviet Union pitted the two biggest superpowers in the world at the height of the Cold War. This infamous matchup was made into the 2004 Disney film Miracle.\n\nThe underdog American team, consisting of young amateur players, continued to shock the world as they advanced to the finals against the Soviet squad, who had won the gold five out of the previous six Winter Olympics. Through head coach Herb Brooks, played by Kurt Russell, the team is pushed to their fullest potential in grueling practice, dedication, and commitment. The film captures the uplifting power of sports to rise above national differences and compete in a bloodless way. The in-the-rink camera work puts you inside the epic match and the dramatic acting and moving score work to heighten what was already a great story of competition.\n\nWhile sports can often bring out the best in an athlete, it can also bring out the worst in the desire to win at all costs. Portraying another infamous event on ice, I, Tonya tells the story of figure skater Tonya Harding, played by Margot Robbie, and the dramatic assault on rival Nancy Kerrigan prior to the 1994 National Championships. The mockumentary depicts Harding as a victim of events out of her control, and features fake interviews of Harding and her ex-husband who masterminded the assault, both contradicting each other to create a dubious air around the question of guilt of Harding.\n\nThe film tells Harding’s story, including her relationship with her domineering, perfectionist mother and her abusive marriage. It looks at how the media portrayed her negatively because of her poor background in an elite sport, despite her incredible ability. Her frustration with her losses because of her unwholesome image leads her to questionable actions, which inevitably lead to the assault on Kerrigan. The film plays with the serious event in a humorous manner, with unreliable interviewees casting doubt on what actually happened.\n\nEven though true sports events have enough excitement and drama for a good story, it is often fun to make up our own sports, sometimes casting them into the unknown future. In his short story collection The Infinite Arena, author Terry Carr brings together seven science fiction stories about sports in space. These sports slightly resemble those that we know now, but tweak them to represent the possibilities of the technological future. In one, polo is played with spaceships instead of horses. In another by Arthur C. Clarke, author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, solar-powered ships compete in a race to the moon.\n\nThe classic poem about baseball, “Casey at the Bat” is skewered to depict an alien planet where Earth lore and culture has been adopted, melding wannabe gangsters and pirates as they compete against a team of snakelike competitors in a game of baseball. The aliens rely mostly on their star, who has taken on the persona of Casey, going so far as to believe that the infamous day in Mudville actually happened to him. The sole human on the planet takes the task of helping the imbibing ewok-like inhabitants win the regional pennant and prevent the tragedy of Mudville from repeating itself.\n\nNo matter if you are an athlete or not, sports can be an exciting event that captures the human spirit in all its competitiveness and determination. Whether true or not, the physical feats of sports cause awe in the viewer and pride in the participant, showcasing the potential of us all through hard work and persistence.\n\nFamilies are often full of dirty secrets, hidden from younger generations. One may not learn the truth about a relative until after they have passed, when it is deemed safe to bring the dark parts of their life to the light. In a similar manner, a city’s shadowy history can be unknown to those living in it today. In Michael Rips’ novel The Face of a Naked Lady, the author explores his family’s history, which inevitably leads to a history lesson on his hometown of Omaha.\n\nThe story begins with a mysterious nude painting done by Rips’ father, discovered in the family basement after his death. Michael only knew his father as a quiet, thoughtful man, bookish and prone to naps. But with the discovery of a series of risqué paintings, Michael takes it upon himself to learn who the woman is, and who his father really was. He hires a mysterious private investigator to assist him, who ends up giving clues rather than answers to Michael’s search.\n\nAfter speaking to old friends of his fathers, Rips learns that he was the first to smoke, drink, and court women among his friend group. He discovers the meaning behind his father Norman’s nickname “Nick,” which was shortened from “Nicotine” due to his smoking habit. But his father was also a lover of literature, frequenting a local bar to read – and flirt.\n\nThe more Rips learns about his father and the older generations of his family the more increasingly bizarre the stories become. His father was born in a brothel owned by his grandparents and raised in part by the women who worked there. Rips explores the old city of South Omaha, which before incorporation was the fastest growing city in the country due to its main industry – the stockyards. As immigrants moved to the city to work, the population boomed, and as most were men, brothels and bars were the next biggest businesses.\n\nRips tells the story of his family alongside the history of Omaha, including mob boss Tom Dennison and his connections to Al Capone during prohibition, the tragic 1919 race riot, and the development of the suburbs. He tells of his own youth and time spent working in his father’s optical factory making eyeglasses. It is here that Michael believes his father met the woman who would be the subject of his paintings.\n\nPart memoir, part history, and part magical realism, Michael Rips tells an entertaining tale twisting light and dark, humor and death, sex and adventure into a search for a man he knew his whole life, yet only truly learned about after it was too late.\n\nThe Face of a Naked Lady is available at Bellevue University Library, located in the general collection. All books can be borrowed for 21 days with the option of renewal.\n\nImage source: https://www.amazon.com/Face-Naked-Lady-Family-Mystery/dp/0618711899"
