There is one being developed,\" she told BBC Radio 2's Gaby Roslin.\n\n\"I mean, I know we’re older now so I don’t exactly know what the storyline’s going to be [...] I guess they’ve got to get the script right first, which is the age-old dilemma.\"\n\nWilson further reflected: \"I absolutely loved making those movies – we're all still friends, all of us girls – they're just so joyful. I think what people see on the screen is just us having a laugh.\n\n\"It wasn't really acting because I love singing and dancing, and I just loved hanging out with that cast so, so much. It was really fun.\"\n\nRelated: Pitch Perfect star Adam Devine welcomes first child with wife Chloe Bridges\n\nThe series focuses on female acapella group The Barden Bellas, and also stars the likes of Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin and Ben Platt.\n\nThe franchise returned in 2022 for TV series Bumper in Berlin, which focuses on Adam DeVine’s Bumper Allen as he heads to Germany to revive his music career.\n\nDespite being initially renewed for a second season, the show was subsequently cancelled amid last year's Hollywood strikes.\n\nAlongside DeVine, the show also starred Sarah Hyland, Jameela Jamil and Flula Borg.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
