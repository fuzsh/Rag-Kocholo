        "text": "#10: “Pool Mashup”\n\n“Pitch Perfect” (2012)\n\nThe Barden Bellas are a ragtag team of awesome nerds who seemingly have nothing in common outside of their mutual desire to sing. Although they spend much of the first movie off-key, the team eventually comes together in harmony thanks to Beca’s leadership. The Bellas unlock their true potential through a toe-tapping mashup of Bruno Mars’ “Just the Way You Are” and Nelly’s “Just a Dream.” While the performance isn’t extravagant or show-stopping, watching these characters connect musically is every bit as invigorating as a Broadway musical. It’s especially inspiring to see Aubrey finally let her guard down and embrace the Bellas’ new direction. We guarantee you’ll be clapping along by the song’s conclusion.\n\n#9: “Right Round”\n\n“Pitch Perfect” (2012)\n\nThe Treblemakers are the Bellas’ greatest competition in the first film and their performance at regionals is definitely a highlight. The all-boy a cappella group wows with their rendition of Flo Rida’s “Right Round.” While you could argue that the song itself has become overused in recent years, the Treblemakers put a unique spin on the dirty rap single. Complete with tight choreography, catchy vocals, and an all-around cool vibe, this performance turns heads in all the right ways.The hilarious commentary from John and Gail is just an added bonus. The Bellas might go on to win nationals, but there’s no denying which group stole the show at the semi-finals.\n\n#8: “We Belong”\n\n“Pitch Perfect 2” (2015)\n\nWhen they initially meet, Fat Amy compares kissing Bumper to trying crystal meth. Nevertheless, sparks eventually fly between the two like an exploding burrito. In the sequel, Amy realizes that she wants to make beautiful music with him. That’s exactly what she does, as she blindsides Bumper with a performance of “We Belong.” Paddling in a canoe, Amy unleashes her feelings in the most romantic and hysterical way possible. Traveling across a lake and a road, Amy’s practically out of breathe by the time she reaches her love. Although Bumper is reluctant at first, the solo eventually becomes a duet and they finish the song together...like a cheesecake.\n\n#7: “Riff Off: Round 2”\n\n“Pitch Perfect 2” (2015)\n\nThe Bellas find themselves in another riff off, although this time the stakes have been raised. They not only have to go up against the Treblemakers, but also Das Sound Machine, Tone Hangers, and the surprisingly angelic Green Bay Packers. This makes for a fierce competition comprised of categories like “Songs About Butts,” “Country Love,”“I Dated John Mayer,” and “90s Hip-Hop Jams.” The performance is like shuffling through an iPod of various hits, building to a final round between the Bellas and their German rivals. It’s a close call, but Emily’s original song ultimately costs her team the $42,000 gift card to Dave & Busters. Who knew singing a cappella could be so lucrative?\n\n#6: “Party in the U.S.A.”\n\n“Pitch Perfect” (2012)\n\nThis performance might be one of the most straightforward from the original film, but it’s also one of the most crucial. On a bus, the Bellas all sit in silence, ignoring one another. Once they start singing along with Miley Cyrus’“Party in the U.S.A.,” though, the diverse group begins to find some common ground. One by one, the Bellas all join in, turning their vehicle into a literal party bus. Even Beca can’t contain herself as the others encourage her to take part. Uplifting, bouncy, and just a ton of fun, you never want this musical number to end. Unfortunately, the tank runs out of gas, bringing the party to a halt.\n\n#5: “Kennedy Center Performance”\n\n“Pitch Perfect 2” (2015)\n\nThe sequel opens on a high note as the Bellas perform at the Kennedy Center before President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. Given their high-profile audience, the ladies go out with one of their most ambitious mashups ever, combining “We Got the World,” “Timber,” and “America the Beautiful”. The music is perfectly complemented by the showy choreography, flashy costumes, and scenery that simply screams patriotism. Their performance is capped off with a grand finale from Fat Amy. Just as her song selection suggests, however, she comes in like a wrecking ball and suffers the worst wardrobe malfunction since Nipplegate. The Obamas aren’t at all amused, but we’re left laughing our butts off.\n\n#4: “Riff Off: Round 1”\n\n“Pitch Perfect” (2012)\n\nThe second riff off might’ve been bigger, but nothing can top the original. As Beca learns more about the world of a cappella, she attends a singing battle with the Bellas. The riff off is full of terrific moments, as the competing groups face off with categories like “Ladies of the 80s” and “Songs About Sex.” However, the standout moment has got to be when Beca chimes in with “No Diggity.” The performance demonstrates that Beca is more than a sarcastic cynic. She has a real passion for music, which wins her the respect and support of her fellow singers as well as an MTV Movie Award for Best Musical Moment.\n\n#3: “World Championship Finale”\n\n“Pitch Perfect 2” (2015)\n\nIn order to triumph over Das Sound Machine at the World Finals, the Bellas up their game like never before. Their final performance opens with an atmospheric clapping routine that leads into a mashup that includes “Run the World (Girls)” and “Where Them Girls At.” The finale climaxes with an original song entitled, “Flashlight,” which went on to reach #2 on the ARIA Charts. It’s a touching number that shines the spotlight on freshman Emily. What really warms our hearts, however, is seeing all the Bellas of the past appear on stage. “Pitch Perfect 2” is largely about finding the courage to start a new chapter in life and this song wonderfully encompasses that theme.\n\n#2: “Cups”\n\n“Pitch Perfect” (2012)\n\nFollowing an awkward duet in the shower, Beca is prompted to audition for the Bellas. Despite arriving unprepared, she still manages to impress with nothing but a plastic cup and her natural talent. Taking a page from the 1931 Carter Family song, “When I'm Gone,” Beca’s rendition of “Cups” is as awesome as it is simple. Actress Anna Kendrick actually learned how to do the routine from an online video, influencing the filmmakers to feature the tune in the movie. “Cups” subsequently celebrated a newfound popularity with Kendrick later recording a music video. The song would additionally make a comeback in “Pitch Perfect 2” as the Bellas prepare to say goodbye around a campfire.\n\nBefore we get to our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions:\n\n“Lollipop”\n\n“Pitch Perfect 2” (2015)\n\n“Bellas Regionals”\n\n“Pitch Perfect” (2012)\n\n“Since U Been Gone”\n\n“Pitch Perfect” (2012)\n\n#1: “Bellas Finals”\n\n“Pitch Perfect” (2012)\n\nIf you thought a cappella was lame going into “Pitch Perfect,” then this performance officially shattered all of your preconceived notions. Bringing the Bellas into the 21st century, the finale starts off calm and soothing, but quickly blows up with beat-boxing, colorful choreography, and a refreshing sound. Mashing up tunes like “Price Tag” and “Give Me Everything,” the act allows each major Bella a chance to shine. Of course the most noteworthy moment is Beca’s solo of “Don't You (Forget About Me),” signifying her true feelings for Jesse. Leading the Bellas to victory, the finale is the ultimate mic drop, not to mention the very definition of pitch perfect."
