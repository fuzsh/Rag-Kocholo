        "text": "Pitch Perfect is a movie that was released in 2012 and is rated PG-13. The film stars Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, and many other actors who capture the audience’s attention with their brilliant performances. The plot centers around a protagonist named Becca in her freshman year of college. Wanting to pursue a career in music production, Becca has an interest in creating music during her free time and has a talent for singing. She joins an on-campus acapella group, The Bellas, who are working to repair their reputation and win various acapella competitions.\n\nThe film features a variety of hit songs which the audience is promised to know. Additionally, it falls into the genre of comedy which is performed by the actors in ways that have the audience laughing the entire movie. Pitch Perfect is the first in a trilogy of movies, the last of which was released in 2017 and takes place after the main protagonists graduate college. All three movies are enjoyable and entertaining, keeping the audience engaged throughout the entire viewing experience."
