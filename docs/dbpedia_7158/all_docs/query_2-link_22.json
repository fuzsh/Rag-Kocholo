        "text": "“Pitch Perfect” has a pitch problem.\n\nThis movie is about collegiate a cappella, but it’s loaded with the plotting conventions of the Disney Channel’s tweener shows. That makes it only occasionally funny and not at all illuminating about the rich world of a cappella singing.\n\nBeca (Anna Kendrick) is a new arrival at Barden University and joins the Bellas, an all-female a cappella group whose run in a national competition the year before ended ignominiously. As the group tries to sing its way back to respectability, Beca has not-very-convincing catfights, a fledgling romance with a guy (Skylar Astin) from a rival all-male group, daddy issues and so on.\n\nAs the overstuffed plot makes its muddled way toward the inevitable onstage triumph, the best comic moments come from secondary characters like Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), another Bella, though they sometimes court offensiveness. The NBC competition series “The Sing-Off” showed how entertaining a cappella music can be, but this movie doesn’t respect it enough to delineate the hard work that goes into making it.\n\n“Pitch Perfect” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) because college students sometimes talk about sex."
