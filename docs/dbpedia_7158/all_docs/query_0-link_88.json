        "text": "01 of 30\n\n50/50 (2011)\n\nIf you’re looking for a lighthearted, romantic romp, 50/50 is not the movie for you. Guaranteed to make you ugly cry and call your loved ones, this black comedy about falling in love in the middle of cancer treatment is beautifully written and acted, and has a lot to say about maternal, platonic, and romantic relationships. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars opposite Seth Rogen, who also executive produces. (The script is based on screenwriter Will Reiser’s actual cancer battle, and the character of Kyle is based on Rogen, who is real-life friends with Reiser.)\n\nThe film’s subject matter could have resulted in a saccharine sob-fest, but EW’s critic writes that the jokes and energy Rogen & Co. bring to the project helps evoke a “mash of the sweet and the bracingly coarse, that sells this unusual downer/upper of a life-and-death comedy.” —Ilana Gordon\n\nWhere to watch 50/50: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Jonathan Levine\n\nCast: Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Seth Rogen, Anna Kendrick, Bryce Dallas Howard, Anjelica Huston\n\n02 of 30\n\nAm I OK? (2022)\n\nA coming out and coming-of-middle-age movie co-directed by comics and real-life spouses Tig Notaro and Stephanie Allynne, Am I Ok? is the queer millennial movie you didn’t know you needed. Dakota Johnson stars as Lucy, a woman stuck in career and romantic limbo, who is forced out of her everyday mundanity by a new understanding of her sexuality and her best friend’s upcoming international move.\n\nA comedy about love — both platonic and romantic — the movie was filmed during the pandemic and premiered at Sundance, but has since found a home on Max, and a fan base amongst movie lovers who enjoy authentic comedies about late bloomers finding love and themselves. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Am I OK?: Max\n\nDirectors: Tig Notaro, Stephanie Allynne\n\nCast: Dakota Johnson, Sonoya Mizuno, Jermaine Fowler, Kiersey Clemons, Molly Gordon, Whitmer Thomas, Odessa A'zion, Sean Hayes, Tig Notaro\n\n03 of 30\n\nAs Good As It Gets (1998)\n\nAs Good As It Gets is not interested in being your prototypical romantic comedy. The film scorns genre tropes and easy to digest characters in favor of following a selfish, misanthropic writer (Jack Nicholson), a struggling waitress (Helen Hunt), and a gay painter (Greg Kinnear), all of whom end up in each other’s lives after a series of unfortunate events.\n\nReleased in the late ‘90s and offering a progressive exploration — at the time — into topics like sexuality and mental health, the film is well-regarded for its smart dialogue and winning performances. (Nicholson and Hunt both took home Best Acting Oscars for their work on the film.) As EW’s critic at the time writes, “it’s fun to watch Jack Nicholson draw on great reservoirs of bile to play a mean SOB with an obsessive-compulsive disorder who is partially humanized by his contact with Helen Hunt (well, who wouldn’t be)?” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch As Good As It Gets: Max\n\nEW grade: B— (read the review)\n\nDirector: James L. Brooks\n\nCast: Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich, Shirley Knight\n\n04 of 30\n\nA Star Is Born (2018)\n\nIt's a tale as old as time. While this is the fourth iteration of A Star Is Born — previous films were released in 1937, 1954, and 1976, respectively — Bradley Cooper proved why the story of doomed romance is, in fact, timeless. The director/co-writer/producer also stars as Jackson Maine, a washed-up country singer who falls in love with a budding singer-songwriter, Ally (Lady Gaga). Their romance is tested when Ally's meteoric rise to fame eclipses his, while he also struggles with alcohol dependency and substance abuse.\n\nWith gripping performances, striking cinematography, and one hell of a soundtrack, this Star Is Born is one we love to revisit again and again, even knowing it'll break our hearts once more. —Kevin Jacobsen\n\nWhere to watch A Star Is Born: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Bradley Cooper\n\nCast: Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga, Andrew Dice Clay, Dave Chappelle, Sam Elliott\n\n05 of 30\n\nBridget Jones's Diary (2001)\n\nWhen it comes to turn of the 21st century romantic comedies, you don’t get much more iconic than Bridget Jones’s Diary. Based on the novel by Helen Fielding, Bridget Jones tells the story of its eponymous heroine, Bridget (Renée Zellweger), a British thirtysomething looking for love. Bridget’s romantic life — which she chronicles in her diary along with her other misadventures — takes a turn when she engages in an ill-fated affair with her dashing boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), leaving the kind Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) in the lurch.\n\nFans of the book were skeptical when production announced the role of Bridget would be played by a Texas-born actress, but Zellweger pulls off the role with aplomb, perfectly channeling Bridget’s lovably messy essence. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Bridget Jones’s Diary: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Sharon Maguire\n\nCast: Renée Zellweger, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones\n\n06 of 30\n\nCasablanca (1942)\n\nDespite boasting some of the best quotes in all of cinematic history, Casablanca was just one of many films churned out by the studio system in the early years of World War II. But something about the movie's heart-wrenching love triangle, political and social relevance, and lush setting charmed viewers, propelling the project to an unexpected Best Picture win, and a permanent spot on almost every Best Of list.\n\nElectricity rations were common at the time of the movie's release, but entirely unnecessary — the sexual currents pulsating between stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman had to have been strong enough to generate power for a small city, at the very least. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Casablanca: Max\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Michael Curtiz\n\nCast: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains\n\n07 of 30\n\nCeleste and Jesse Forever (2012)\n\nEnding a relationship is easier than falling out of love. In Celeste and Jesse Forever, the titular characters (Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg) are high-school sweethearts who have made the decision to divorce but haven't yet figured out how to move on. Celeste is a high-achieving career woman looking for something more, but when Jesse gets involved with another woman, she's left to sort through her complicated feelings and starts to second guess whether breaking up was the right move after all.\n\nA rom-com that is less about escapism and aspirational love than it is about the hard slog of digging through and understanding intimate realities, Celeste and Jesse Forever is smart, funny, grounded, and energized by the couple's incredible chemistry. EW's critic praises the movie, writing, \"It's been a while since a romantic comedy mustered this much charm by looking this much like life.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Celeste and Jesse Forever: Max\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Lee Toland Krieger\n\nCast: Rashida Jones, Andy Samberg, Chris Messina, Ari Graynor, Eric Christian Olsen, Will McCormack, Elijah Wood, Emma Roberts\n\n08 of 30\n\nDate Night (2010)\n\nA screwball comedy modernized to highlight the exhausted suburban parent, Date Night follows Claire and Phil Foster (Tina Fey and Steve Carell), a New Jersey couple who decide to break out of their mundane routine by enjoying a trendy dinner in the city — only to find themselves confused for another pair and embroiled in a corruption scandal. Pursued around New York City by cops and mobsters, the two rediscover their connection at gunpoint, but have their years of marriage prepared them enough to survive a night out on the town?\n\nCarell and Fey — both operating at the height of their TV comedy careers — are perfectly matched and happy to elevate an already solid script with improvised ad libs. Also benefiting from a supporting cast of reliable comedy favorites, Date Night is the perfect film to watch on a date night, or any time you're craving a zany caper that travels from reality to absurdity and back again. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Date Night: Max\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Shawn Levy\n\nCast: Steve Carell, Tina Fey, Taraji P. Henson, Common, Mark Wahlberg\n\n09 of 30\n\nDear White People (2014)\n\nWhen the movie Dear White People was released in 2014, it represented a step for modern cinema: an ensemble movie about a group of Black students at a fictional, predominantly white university, as told from the perspective of those Black students. Featuring one of Tessa Thompson's breakout movie roles, Dear White People was a critical and commercial success, spawning a TV series of the same name in 2017, which ran for four seasons on Netflix.\n\nWhile this isn’t a romantic comedy by traditional definitions, it's definitely a comedy and the students’ love lives all play significant and interesting roles. You may recognize some of the film’s jokes from screenwriter and director Justin Simien’s Twitter (now X) account circa the early 2010s, where the writer used to workshop some of the film’s future material. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Dear White People: Max\n\nDirector: Justin Simien\n\nCast: Tessa Thompson, Tyler James Williams, Teyonah Parris\n\n10 of 30\n\nDefinitely, Maybe (2008)\n\nFor those seeking a quicker rom-com fix than binging nine seasons of How I Met Your Mother, this sleeper late-2000s flick offers the same formula with a worthwhile conclusion in just under two hours. Ryan Reynolds is as charming as ever in his role as soon-to-be divorcée Will Hayes, whose inquisitive daughter (Abigail Breslin) prods him to narrate his meet-cute with her anonymous mom. Dipping back into his past relationships not only unveils the complexities of marriage and love but also helps him discover, much like a skilled storyteller, how he'd want his happy ending to play out.\n\nWhile not revolutionary, Definitely, Maybe delivers all the essential ingredients for a top-tier rom-com — an endearing cast, witty banter, and plenty of touchy-feely moments — making it the perfect recipe for a cozy night in. —James Mercadante\n\nWhere to watch Definitely, Maybe: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Adam Brooks\n\nCast: Ryan Reynolds, Isla Fisher, Derek Luke, Abigail Breslin, Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz\n\n11 of 30\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada (2006)\n\nMeryl Streep may not have won the Oscar for her performance as Miranda Priestly in The Devil Wears Prada, but the film does bear the distinction of being one of her most quotable works. An adaptation of the 2003 novel by the same name — which was based on the author’s experiences working as an assistant at Vogue — the movie tells the story of Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), an aspiring writer who accepts a job working for the demanding editor in chief at one of the most distinguished fashion magazines in New York City.\n\nWhat follows is a headlong descent into the fashion world, complete with ridiculous assignments, eccentric characters, and glorious outfits. Hathaway is charming as the fish out of water who gets the fashion education she never knew she wanted or needed, but the movie belongs to Streep and her clipped, precise performance. That’s all. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Devil Wears Prada: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: David Frankel\n\nCast: Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci, Simon Baker, Adrian Grenier\n\n12 of 30\n\nDinner With Friends (2001)\n\nHBO's cinematic adaptation of Donald Margulies' Pulitzer Prize winning 1998 play, Dinner With Friends maintains the original's simple premise while mining deep for emotional and personal revelations. The story of two New England couples dealing with the fact that one of the pairs is divorcing, the film captures the unexpected moments of vulnerability and honesty that define long-term relationships — even ones that are falling apart.\n\nDennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell are perfectly cast as a pair of foodies who are more comfortable navigating what's on their dinner plates than what's going on in their friends' lives, and Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette toggle between insecurity and self-assurance as the couple whose marriage is broken up by an affair with a younger woman. Haute cuisine served over seven scenes, Dinner With Friends is the rare adaptation that remains faithful to the original while still finding new paths to tread. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Dinner With Friends: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Norman Jewison\n\nCast: Dennis Quaid, Andie MacDowell, Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette\n\n13 of 30\n\nFever Pitch (2005)\n\nThe only film to feature a love triangle between a woman, a man, and the baseball team he adores, Fever Pitch bears the distinction of not only being a solid romantic comedy, but of also doing its part to help break an 86-year-old curse. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is a Red Sox superfan who falls in love with a baseball agnostic named Lindsey (Drew Barrymore), but struggles to prioritize their relationship over his MLB viewing schedule.\n\nThe movie was filmed during the 2004 Red Sox season, which — not to drop any spoilers two decades later — ended up being an eventful one for Boston, necessitating a rewrite for the movie’s ending. You don’t need to love baseball to enjoy this sports comedy, but it doesn’t hurt to have an appetite for New England-based humor, super fandom, and underdog stories. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Fever Pitch: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirectors: Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly\n\nCast: Drew Barrymore, Jimmy Fallon\n\n14 of 30\n\nForgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)\n\nJason Segel bares his soul — and his fully nude body — in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, a rom-com about a man trying to escape the aftermath of a bad breakup. Segel plays Peter, an aspiring composer who flees to a Hawaiian resort after being dumped by Sarah (Kristen Bell), a Hollywood TV star with bigger ambitions for her career and love life. Peter's island getaway takes a turn for the worse when Sarah and her new boyfriend show up to stay in the same resort, and it's further complicated when Peter starts to develop feelings for Rachel (Mila Kunis), the resort's receptionist.\n\nA comedy that allows you to romp through Hawaii's scenic vistas while unpacking a former couple's dirty laundry, Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a trip that will make you grateful you checked your own emotional baggage at the door. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Forgetting Sarah Marshall: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Nicholas Stoller\n\nCast: Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, Russell Brand, Bill Hader, Jonah Hill, Da'Vone McDonald, Jack McBrayer, Maria Thayer, Paul Rudd, Jason Bateman\n\n15 of 30\n\nGarden State (2004)\n\nZach Braff's Garden State — the story of a struggling young actor's return home to New Jersey after the death of his mother — is not a perfect movie. Written by Braff during a period of depression and inspired by his own feelings of numbness, the film interrogates themes like mental illness, medication, growing up, and falling in love, sometimes nailing the sentiments and other times falling short.\n\nIn spite of its deficits, however, the romantic comedy was a sleeper hit when it premiered in 2004, a reception attributable to the film's excellent soundtrack, objectively sick cast, and resonance with a young generation staring down the barrel of adulthood. Starring Braff as the film's protagonist and Natalie Portman as his eccentric and compulsively dishonest love interest, the film is often compared to The Graduate, but remains a singular romantic comedy that demands an emotional reaction from its audience. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Garden State: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Zach Braff\n\nCast: Zach Braff, Natalie Portman, Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Holm, Jean Smart, Jackie Hoffman, Ann Dowd, Method Man, Jim Parsons\n\n16 of 30\n\nJust Wright (2010)\n\nCombining love and basketball often makes for a romantic comedy slam dunk, and 2010’s Just Wright delivers just the right amount of sports, laughs, and relationship drama to keep the trend alive. Queen Latifah stars as Leslie Wright, a physical therapist who keeps getting friend-zoned by her dates. Her career picks up when she helps NBA star Scott McKnight (Common) work through a potentially career-ending injury, but their bond is complicated by Leslie’s friendship with Morgan (Paula Patton), who is dating Scott.\n\nA charming comedy confidently led by a trio of stars, Just Wright gives Latifah room to do what she does best: win over audiences with her likeability and wit. A good rom-com option for basketball fans, EW’s critic writes “The hoops set can enjoy some courtside action with real pro players.” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Just Wright: Max\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Sanaa Hamri\n\nCast: Queen Latifah, Common, Paula Patton\n\n17 of 30\n\nThe Last of the Blonde Bombshells (2000)\n\nA film with a sensibility that can only be described as singularly British, The Last of the Blonde Bombshells is a romantic comedy with some rhythm. Elizabeth (Judi Dench) spent World War II playing saxophone in a swing band called the Blonde Bombshells. After the death of her husband, Elizabeth reconnects with Patrick (Ian Holm) — the band's former drummer and only male member, who avoided conscription during the war by cross-dressing. When the pair start dating, Elizabeth decides to get the band back together, but discovers the Bombshells have scattered with members in jail, suffering from alcoholism, and devoted to the Salvation Army.\n\nDescribed by EW's reviewer as \"witty and wistful,\" The Last of the Blonde Bombshells is another piece of evidence that blondes really do have more fun. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch The Last of the Blonde Bombshells: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gillies MacKinnon\n\nCast: Judi Dench, Ian Holm, Romola Garai, Olympia Dukakis\n\n18 of 30\n\nLegally Blonde (2001)\n\nYou can't make a list of Reese Witherspoon's best movies — regardless of genre — without including Legally Blonde. A fish out of water comedy that takes a SoCal sorority girl and drops her into Harvard Law to win back the boyfriend who dumped her, this rom-com is on a mission to prove that blondes have more fun (and more brains) than people give them credit for. Witherspoon plays to the top height of her intelligence, transforming Elle Woods from a sheltered, privileged West Coast princess to a legal shark whose generosity and good attitude outside the courtroom helps her attract a crew of admiring outcasts.\n\nWhite Lotus fans will love seeing Jennifer Coolidge in one of her best roles as a beaten down manicurist in need of a cheerleader, and it's a credit to the strength of the film and the actors' performances that while Legally Blonde has been adapted into a Broadway musical, it hasn't been remade into a new movie — yet. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Legally Blonde: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Robert Luketic\n\nCast: Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Matthew Davis, Victor Garber, Jennifer Coolidge\n\n19 of 30\n\nLet Them All Talk (2020)\n\nJoan Didion once said \"Writers are always selling someone out,\" and that is exactly what Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Hughes (Meryl Streep) is accused of doing. In Let Them All Talk, Alice boards the Queen Mary 2 on a transatlantic trip with the intention of writing her new book and spending time with two of her oldest friends (Candice Bergen and Dianne Wiest). But as the voyage proceeds, Alice ends up battling with Roberta (Bergen) over how much of her original book was based on Roberta's life, and watching as her nephew Tyler (Lucas Hedges) falls for her literary agent, Karen (Gemma Chan).\n\nFunny, wise, bitter, primarily improvised, and made in barely two weeks, EW's critic describes the film as \"a chance to spend two hours watching Streep & Co. make the most of Deborah Eisenberg's deliciously salty script, while Soderbergh — who also serves as cinematographer — shoots it all in ruthless, radiant light.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Let Them All Talk: Max\n\nEW grade: A- (read the review)\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nCast: Meryl Streep, Candice Bergen, Dianne Wiest, Gemma Chan, Lucas Hedges,\n\n20 of 30\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002)\n\nToula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) embraces her role as the loyal yet overlooked member of her enormous clan until she decides to take control of her life at 30. While her parents tirelessly seek the perfect Greek man for her, Toula knows none of those suitors stand a chance against WASP English teacher Ian Miller (John Corbett), who's head over heels for her and is ready to take on the challenge of getting her family to approve their marriage. (He's really all that and a bottle of Windex!)\n\nAdapted from Vardalos' one-woman show based on her real-life family, My Big Fat Greek Wedding delves into the dynamics of growing up in an immigrant household deeply rooted in their culture, navigating a world that centers on conformity. —Angela Andaloro\n\nWhere to watch My Big Fat Greek Wedding: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Joel Zwick\n\nCast: Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Lainie Kazan, Michael Constantine, Gia Carides, Louis Mandylor, Andrea Martin, Joey Fatone\n\n21 of 30\n\nPitch Perfect 2 (2015)\n\nThe box office success of 2012's Pitch Perfect mandated a sequel, and Pitch Perfect 2 obliged. After a scandalous mishap during a performance for the President keeps the Barden Bellas from competing in Nationals, the franchise takes a Mighty Ducks 2-esque leap in logic and goes international. Now forced to compete with a German supergroup called Das Sound Machine, the Bellas must pull out their best medleys and moves if they are to secure the win at the world competition and find their way back into the a capella sphere's good graces.\n\nTurbocharged with jokes — as one would expect from Kay Cannon, a former 30 Rock writer — and bowing at the altar of the movie's patron saint, Beyonce, Pitch Perfect 2 finds its heart, as EW's critic writes, in giving \"big, joyful voice to groups whose members have spent their whole lives being targeted because of who they are, be it black, gay, overweight, female, or just deeply uncool.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Pitch Perfect 2: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Elizabeth Banks\n\nCast: Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Adam DeVine, Katey Sagal, Anna Camp, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Ester Dean, Chrissie Fit, John Michael Higgins, Elizabeth Banks\n\n22 of 30\n\nPretty Woman (1990)\n\nIf you haven't yet seen this '90s classic...big mistake! Big! Huge! Garry Marshall's Golden Globe-nominated flick spins a modern Cinderella story starring the then-rising star Julia Roberts as the unpolished, down-on-her-luck escort Vivian and Richard Gere as leverage buyout executive Edward, who offers her a taste of the high life in exchange for her company at social gatherings. While it's undeniably a product of its time, steeped in outdated gender stereotypes and degrading convictions of sex work, the film was groundbreaking during its initial release, and its enduring charm lies in the palpable chemistry between Gere and Roberts.\n\nEven EW's critic, who notoriously panned it with a D grade, had a change of heart 20 years later, bumping it to a B — acknowledging its message that \"you can be a feminist and a seductress, a hooker and a princess, all at the same time\" and how it \"marked Pretty Woman as the rare Hollywood movie that doesn’t just channel the culture but changes it.\" —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Pretty Woman: Max\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Garry Marshall\n\nCast: Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Ralph Bellamy, Jason Alexander, Héctor Elizondo, Laura San Giacomo, Alex Hyde-White\n\n23 of 30\n\nSerendipity (2001)\n\nWhen destiny has a sense of humor, we call it serendipity, which also happens to be the title of one of 2001's most beloved romantic comedies. A whirlwind New York love story, Serendipity stars Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack as two young city dwellers who meet and enjoy a magical night — only to decide to let fate control whether they end up together. As the years pass and their life paths diverge, it seems destiny has other plans for the would-be lovers, but New York City and a series of fortunate events may end up reuniting the pair after all.\n\nA missed connections comedy featuring an excellent supporting cast and a screenplay that is more than willing to lean into all of the best tropes of the genre, Serendipity is fun, funny, and guaranteed to make you yearn for a holiday season spent in the Big Apple. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Serendipity: Max\n\nEW grade: A- (read the review)\n\nDirector: Peter Chelsom\n\nCast: John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale, Molly Shannon, Jeremy Piven, Bridget Moynahan, Eugene Levy\n\n24 of 30\n\nSex and the City: The Movie (2008)\n\nAfter spending six seasons either loathing or swooning over Carrie Bradshaw's (Sarah Jessica Parker) will-they-won't-they relationship with Mr. Big (Chris Noth), loyal Sex and the City viewers were gifted a feature film four years post-series finale to meet their curiosity. In this cinematic continuation, the ever-pensive Big ruffles Carrie's feathers by jilting her at the altar, thus prompting the N.Y.C. writer to turn her pre-booked Mexico honeymoon into a healing journey by traveling with her three besties: Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Samantha (Kim Cattrall), and Charlotte (Kristin Davis).\n\nOne of the highest-grossing rom-coms of all time, Sex and the City: The Movie is escapist fiction at its zenith, preserving the irresistible charm of the original series while injecting more melodrama, more luxury, more character development (albeit controversial), bigger and better closets, and — you guessed it — more sex. —J.M.\n\nWhere to watch Sex and the City: The Movie: Max\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Michael Patrick King\n\nCast: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon, Jennifer Hudson, Candice Bergen, Chris Noth, David Eigenberg, Jason Lewis\n\n25 of 30\n\nShakespeare in Love (1998)\n\nEven Shakespeare suffered from writer's block, or at least that's the premise of the late '90s period romantic comedy, Shakespeare in Love. Joseph Fiennes stars as the Bard, a strapping poet and writer whose newest play Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter is going nowhere fast — much to the dismay of Philip Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush) who owns the playhouse where the show is set to be performed. Inspiration strikes in the form of Lady Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a fan of Shakespeare's work and an aspiring actor who auditions for a role in his new work and ends up becoming his muse.\n\nRiddled with the love triangles, tragic miscommunications, and comic asides that have distinguished the playwright's work for centuries, Shakespeare in Love is, as EW's critic writes, \"really about two great loves at once — the love of life and of art — and the way that Shakespeare, like no writer before him, transformed the one into the other.\" —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Shakespeare in Love: Max\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: John Madden\n\nCast: Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Ben Affleck, Judi Dench, Simon Callow, Jim Carter, Martin Clunes, Antony Sher, Imelda Staunton, Tom Wilkinson, Mark Williams\n\n26 of 30\n\nSilver Linings Playbook (2012)\n\nRarely is mental health explored on screen in a nuanced, vibrant, joyful way, but that’s exactly the tone director David O. Russell nails in Silver Linings Playbook. Pat and Tiffany (Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) are both dealing with personal issues and recovering from losing their romantic partners. Unmoored and filterless, they meet and agree to help each other out — Tiffany promises to assist Pat in winning back his ex-wife, and in turn, he agrees to be her partner in a dance competition. As they rehearse together and struggle to sort through their woes, they uncover coping mechanisms that allow them to not only live but find the beauty in their respective challenges.\n\nThe kind of comedy that cleans up at awards shows while still retaining its rewatchability, EW’s critic at the time writes, “We’re ready for the comedy of craziness, but the depth of compassion is the movie’s silver lining.” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Silver Linings Playbook: Max\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nDirector: David O.

Released 29 years after the entertainment industry premiered its first movie featuring sound-on-film, the story stars Gene Kelly as a celebrated silent film actor struggling to make the jump to the \"talkies,\" and Debbie Reynolds as an up-and-coming actress trying to break into the business.\n\nThe majority of the film's comedy and over-the-top dance numbers are provided by the charismatic Donald O'Connor, and Jean Hagen makes a delightful (and Oscar-nominated) turn as Lina, a silent movie star with a face for film and a Brooklyn accent strong enough to stop traffic. A beloved treasure and shining representative from Hollywood's Golden Era, Singin' in the Rain continues to endure and inspire. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Singin' in the Rain: Max\n\nEW grade: A+ (read the review)\n\nDirector: Stanley Donen, Gene Kelly\n\nCast: Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, Jean Hagen\n\n28 of 30\n\nSomething's Gotta Give (2003)\n\nThe star-studded cast of this Nancy Meyers rom-com compares to no other. Meyers wrote the part of womanizing Harry Sanborn for Jack Nicholson, and it shows. His comedic, wildly irresponsible persona meets its match with Diane Keaton as the successful and stern writer Erica Barry. The only problem? He's dating her daughter, Marin (Amanda Peet)…at least, until a health emergency pulls Dr. Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves) into the mix, turning this love triangle into a dizzying square. Unlikely romances are at the heart of this film, which follows Harry and Erica as they explore dating, both within their generation and outside of it.\n\nIt's an unusual take on what romance looks like as we age and grow, a premise that won over Reeves, who was at the height of his Matrix fame when he took on this project. He told EW that he knew the film was unique right away, saying, \"It's one of the best romantic comedy scripts — or any script — I've read in a long time. It's smart and personal and relevant and funny.\" And who are we to question Keanu? —Angela Andaloro\n\nWhere to watch Something's Gotta Give: Max\n\nEW grade: N/A (read the review)\n\nDirector: Nancy Meyers\n\nCast: Jack Nicholson, Diane Keaton, Keanu Reeves, Frances McDormand, Amanda Peet, Jon Favreau\n\n30 of 30\n\nUp in the Air (2009)\n\nOne of the only industries that thrived during the 2008 recession was the business of firing people. Such is the job of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), a consultant who traverses the nation to deliver pink slips on behalf of corporations. Driven by an increasing airline status and distaste for interpersonal relationships, Ryan has distanced himself from his family and maintained only a FWB arrangement with a fellow business traveler (Vera Farmiga). But when he's confronted with Natalie (Anna Kendrick), a recent college grad who pitches ambitious ideas about the art of \"downsizing,\" Ryan is prompted to reassess the life he leads.\n\nHelmed by Juno director Jason Reitman, Up in the Air is a charming, heart-wrenching, and thought-provoking exploration of a challenging period in U.S. history — all delivered in the guise of a clever, wry rom-com. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Up in the Air: Max\n\nDirector: Jason Reitman\n\nCast: George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott, J.
