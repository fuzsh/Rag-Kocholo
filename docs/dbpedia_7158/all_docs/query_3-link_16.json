        "text": "After nearly three years, “Pitch Perfect 2” has finally been released after the major success of its predecessor. The original film, an innovative take that follows the journey of an all-female collegiate a cappella group, quickly became one of my favorite movies upon its release. The witty humor and fun spin on the musical genre drew many others in as well, making its sequel a highly anticipated film.\n\n“Pitch Perfect 2,” while a sequel, far exceeded my high expectations. While I personally found the original film to be funnier and groundbreaking in its genre (how many movies have you seen about a cappella?) I would certainly recommend getting a ticket to see the second movie. I laughed out loud and sang along to the film countless times. I also enjoyed seeing fresh faces like Emily played by Hailee Steinfeld, and the new chemistry between the Bellas as seniors as a highly acclaimed a cappella group. The plot, while a little more complex than before, was paced wonderfully and easy to follow while still offering a few surprises.\n\nWhile the movie is definitely a comedy, I also appreciated some of the film’s deeper aspects as well. Like the first one, “Pitch Perfect 2” explores the themes of friendship and teamwork, this time on an all-new level as the Bellas must work together to rediscover their sound. With so many films and television shows offering negative depictions of high school and college-aged students — especially among girls — the positive illustration of the Bellas as sisters who support each other was very uplifting. The girls in this film work together to achieve their goals, all while enjoying some funny moments and flawless singing along the way.\n\nThe problem with a lot of sequels is they either attempt to copy the exact formula as the original, or make too big of a departure. “Pitch Perfect 2” fits right in the middle because it introduces new characters and a new obstacle for the Barden Bellas to face, while still incorporating the elements of angelic a cappella vocals and droll humor that audiences appreciate.\n\nThe main appeal of “Pitch Perfect” was the keen combination of humor and sing-a-long songs. While many musicals can seem cluttered with pointless songs, the storyline allowed for moments of planned or spontaneous performance, and “Pitch Perfect 2” achieved the ideal balance between plot and singing. I particularly enjoyed the fresh set list used in the new film, and appreciated the exploration of other genres such as country in certain scenes.\n\nThe film is definitely worth seeing. While not as fall-out-of-your-seat hilarious as the original, it is still hysterical, and the songs are even more elaborate than before. With favorable reviews from Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, I encourage you to go see what all the fuss is about, and sing along to the Bellas one last time!\n\n— Milo Frayre is a senior at Lanphier High School.\n\n***\n\nPitch Perfect 2\n\nPG-13\n\n4 stars"
