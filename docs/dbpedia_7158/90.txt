Pitch Perfect, the 2012 comedy starring Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson as singers in an acapella group was a smash hit with audiences and rightfully so; it was hilarious and possibly one of the best films of the year. So it makes sense that this year they’re bringing us a sequel, directed by co-star Elizabeth Banks, for which we have a new clip.

Hands down one of the best parts of the fire Pitch Perfect was the face off scene, in which several different acapella groups are given a category and have to spontaneously take over another group’s song. Well it seems we’ve got yet another of those scenes in this sequel as The Bellas compete with another group on the subject of 90s Hip Hop Jams.

The scene isn’t quite as the good as the one in it’s predecessor, but of course, this isn’t the full clip. Perhaps in the extended version, it’s a lot more akin to the previous film and hopefully just as funny and catchy.

Pitch Perfect 2 is in cinemas 15th May
