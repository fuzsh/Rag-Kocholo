        "text": "Is there any better definition of a gift, really?\n\nSo, here are 5 coin and medal gift ideas to suit all budgets.\n\n5 types of collectible items sure to go down a treat!\n\nI - Gold coins listed on the stock exchange\n\nIf you are looking for a valuable gift to replace an envelope in an original way, look no further: listed gold coins combine aesthetic appeal, the historical value of the collectible item, and the quality of the precious object all in one.\n\nThis coin was issued between 1803 and 1914 and does not necessarily feature the effigy of Napoleon I, although he was responsible for its original creation. Individual coins can be more or less expensive depending on how many were struck and the state of conservation.\n\nIn France, in a time not so long ago, it was tradition to give a Napoléon to your grandchildren once a year. As such, it is a coin steeped in history.\n\nOur firm favorite\n\nLess “classic” than that with the effigy of Napoleon I, the “Rooster” 20 franc coin, the last type issued and engraved by Chaplain, boasts both elegance and symbolism with Marianne on the obverse and the Gallic rooster on the reverse.\n\nThe history of the sovereign is split into two eras: first, its initial period of issue from 1489 to 1952, then, in a second period, under Elizabeth II since 1957. The half sovereign, containing half the weight of gold compared with the sovereign, is more affordable. Its engraving has followed precise rules since 1817: a profile of the....sovereign (monarch) on the obverse and St. George slaying the dragon on the basis of a particularly successful design by Benedetto Pistrucci on the reverse.\n\nThis coin had an international impact during the great era of the British Empire and symbolizes wealth and durability.\n\nOur firm favorite\n\nThis sovereign issued in the early years of Elizabeth II’s reign with a particularly fine and aesthetically appealing engraving and a very attractive bronze patina.\n\nThis, in addition to its appeal as a collectible coin, its rarity, and its state of conservation, explains its higher cost compared with other listed coins. There are two types: the first, “Liberty Head”, issued between 1849 and 1907, and the second, “Saint-Gaudens”, issued between 1907 and 1933.\n\nA symbol of opulence and influence over the world, this bullion coin simply enchants with its aestheticism and exquisite quality.\n\nOUR FIRM FAVORITE\n\nThe “Saint-Gaudens” owes its name to its creator, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, commissioned to design it by Theodore Roosevelt. The obverse, with its view of Lady Liberty inclined slightly backward holding a torch and an olive branch, conveys a sense of power and strength. On the reverse, an eagle soaring over the sun.\n\nThe best thing about listed gold coins?\n\nBeyond their value as collectible items (which can be higher than the stock market price), these coins are always listed on the stock market and are therefore likely to increase in value over time.\n\nII - Lucky coins\n\nAntique: The horn of plenty\n\nBudget: From €75\n\nLet’s now go back to the source and, in addition to a coin bearing the symbol of wealth in the form of the mythical horn of plenty, you gift all the historical weight of a coin that is over 1,000 years old.\n\nThe horn of plenty (or cornucopia) is shaped like a...horn and is overflowing with fruit, milk, and honey, all inexhaustible resources. According to the myth attached to it, it was said to have adorned the forehead of the nanny goat Amalthea, foster-mother of Zeus during the god’s infancy. Notably an attribute (among others) of the goddess Fortuna in Roman mythology, the horn of plenty is an inexhaustible source of benefits.\n\nCoins bearing this horn, frequently on the reverse, are diverse and varied, often of Greek or Roman origin.\n\nFrom a symbolic perspective, its round form is reminiscent of the sky and the central square represents the Earth, thus the coin brings the two together in perfect harmony. Tradition holds that three of these coins threaded on a red cord will bring the bearer happiness and prosperity.\n\nFor optimal effect – and in light of the relatively modest budget for the purchase of ancient and genuine coins – it is of course a good idea to purchase three rather than just one.\n\nThe penny, or more appropriately “lucky penny”, is famous among English speakers as a bringer of good luck.\n\nIII - Silver bullion coins\n\nIf gold is often expensive and a little out of your price range, there is nothing to stop you settling on another precious metal no less aesthetically pleasing: silver, which makes another appealing substitute for the traditional but somewhat expected envelope containing banknotes or a check.\n\nSome of them, like the one shown here, are engraved with a wide range of diverse themes, come from all over the world, and are sometimes even encrusted with a precious stone. The choice is vast, and the price varies according to its weight, its rarity, and its state of conservation.\n\nBullion coins are investment coins with a value based on their precious metal weight (gold, silver, platinum). Coins of this type are also issued as limited editions destined for collectors. The price therefore varies depending on their status, weight, rarity, and state of conservation.\n\nIV - Medals for passions\n\nBudget: All budgets\n\nOUR FIRM FAVORITE\n\nThis magnificent bronze “Yachting” medal issued in 1976 and engraved by Raymond Delamarre, a sculptor and medalist who graduated from the Beaux-Arts de Paris National School of Fine Arts, was practically mermaid (sorry!) to be a gift for a sailing enthusiast.\n\nV - Limited editions in gold and silver\n\nFinally, to conclude, here is a carefully selected range of high-quality gold and silver coins (brand new or fleur de coin) issued in limited quantities around the world.\n\nThey are true collector’s items, and each of these coins will surely leave a mark on the mind of the recipient of this precious and unique gift.\n\nOUR FIRM FAVORITE\n\nThis stunning leather case, including an authentic White Star Line stock certificate, a sheet of 5 stamps from the Titanic issue, two Royal Canadian Mint Titanic coins (one 25 cent coloured coin, one coloured & silver plated 50 cent coin) and 3 post cards. Only 10,000 were struck:\n\nSo, that’s it for our 5 gift ideas. We hope you found what you were looking for, among these metallic treasures galore. And, if not, one thing’s sure – our search engine has plenty more to explore!\n\nTranslation: Michael Wright\n\nUpdated on: 12/01/2023\n\nICONOGRAPHY:"
