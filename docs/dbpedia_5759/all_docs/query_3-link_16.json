        "meta_description": "A charming village by the seaside, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Oslo, Drøbak is home to narrow streets with idyllic, wooden houses. With its large marina and a leisure park for swimmers and sunbathers, the influx of day-trippers in the summer is enormous. There are many cozy pubs, cafés and restaurants. Weekly \"jazz cruises\" on the fjord depart from the harbor. Drøbak is also known for Tregaardens Julehus i Drbak, a Christmas emporium open all year round. This has led to the town getting its very own road signs, with a small nisse (elf) on them. To get there, a catamaran ferry departs daily from Oslo in the morning, returning late in the afternoon (travel takes about one hour and is only possible in the summer). There are also frequent all-year bus services to and from Oslo.",
