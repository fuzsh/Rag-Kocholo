        "text": "580\n\nIf you’re looking to take a day trip from Oslo, the small and picturesque town of Drøbak is the perfect getaway.\n\nThis page contains affiliate links. If you buy through these links I may receive a small commission, at no additional cost to you. I only recommend products or services I tried and/or find useful and reliable.\n\nLess than one hour south of Oslo, Drøbak is a small town on the Inner Oslo Fjord. The town is a true winter wonderland during the cold months but it’s just as charming in summer. The narrow alleys, the beautiful marina, and the typical Norwegian wooden houses with their bright colors make this place a lovely destination for a city escape. I visited in winter and fell in love with the snow-covered alleys and the cozy atmosphere.\n\nA day trip to Drøbak is more than enough to check out everything there is to see. While the town may not be packed with visitors, there is no lack of tourism. Drøbak is home to the only saltwater aquarium in the area, not to mention Santa’s house and post office.\n\nBefore getting into the planning and visiting details, here’s a quick overview of the places I will mention on the map:\n\nPlanning your day trip to Drøbak\n\nIf you don’t have a car, the best way to get to Drøbak from Oslo is by bus. Number 500 departs from Oslo Bus Terminal near Oslo Central Station and arrives at Drøbak Brygge in about 40 to 50 minutes. A more convenient stop is by the church in Drøbak. From there, it’s just a two-minute walk to the main square.\n\nIn summer, you may also reach Drøbak by ferryboat, route B21, which takes one hour and a half from Oslo Aker Brygge. This way you’ll combine the trip with a lovely boat ride along the Oslo Fjord. You can check the departure times for buses and ferries on Ruter#.\n\nYou can explore the entire town of Drøbak just by walking so you don’t need to worry about any public transportation there. In less than 10 minutes, you’ll be able to walk from one end to the other of the town.\n\nJulehuset – The Christmas House\n\nOne of the main attractions in Drøbak is without a doubt Treegaarden’s Julehus or the Christmas house. From the outside, it almost looks like any other Norwegian wooden house but as soon as you enter, you’ll find yourself immersed in the Christmas atmosphere with toys, Christmas decorations, and gifts all over the place.\n\nThe house was built at the end of the 1800s as a prayer house and it remained open until World War II. After staying empty for more than 40 years, the house was finally sold in 1986. Treegaarden’s Julehus opened only two years later and has been attracting visitors ever since.\n\nIf you’re visiting Drøbak in winter, this is a must-see. The house is in the main square of Drøbak so it’s impossible to miss. Go buy your Christmas decorations and some souvenirs, or just look around. And don’t forget to check out Santa’s post office!\n\nWhat to see during your day trip to Drøbak\n\nThere are plenty of things to do to fill your day trip to Drøbak. As you walk down the alley that goes from Santa’s house to the port area, you’ll find an interesting street sign picturing Santa Claus running with his bag of presents. The sign is near Drøbak’s Tourist Office, where you can check out an exhibition of over 250,000 letters to Santa Claus sent from all over the world.\n\nNext to the tourist office, you’ll also find the Drøbak Aquarium. If you have time, go in for a visit. A ticket costs 70 NOK, which is around 8 USD or 7 euros. Don’t forget to check out the mermaids’ sculpture right outside the aquarium and enjoy a stroll along the Oslo Fjord.\n\nYou can spend the rest of your time enjoying the walk around the narrow alleys and checking out the colorful houses or stopping for lunch or a coffee break at one of the many restaurants, cafés, and bakeries. Check out also the Badeparken Drøbak and the Drøbak Church.\n\nEat and drink in Drøbak\n\nIf you’re looking for a place to have a slice of cake and a coffee, try the cozy Galleri cafe Teskje AS on Niels Carlsens gate. Next to it, you’ll also find Kumlegaarden restaurant og selskapslokaler if you want to have lunch or dinner.\n\nIf you’re visiting Drøbak in summer, enjoy the sun sitting on the terrace at Pavels Spiseri for a cold drink, some delicious baked goods and cakes, or a full meal.\n\nDespite being quite small, Drøbak has a lot to offer in terms of restaurants. You’ll find anything from pizza to Chinese and Indian restaurants.\n\nPlanning your trip to Norway\n\nFirst things first. If you’re still planning your trip to Norway, start by finding the best flights. I always use Skyscanner to compare prices and find the most affordable options. You can find many great flights from several European cities to Oslo. Search your flights below:\n\nAs for accommodation, Booking.com has plenty of options for every budget, from low-cost hostels to luxury hotels. Oslo can be quite pricey, so I recommend booking your accommodation in advance. Check out the best accommodation in Oslo below:\n\nAnother thing to consider before your trip to Norway or anywhere else is getting travel insurance. I find SafetyWing to be among the best travel insurance out there. It works in 185 countries, and your policy extends automatically every month, so you don’t end up without coverage.\n\nFind out more about the insurance coverage and sign up here. I also wrote a detailed article about SafetyWing if you’re looking for more reasons to get this insurance.\n\nFinally, if you are planning on spending more time in Norway, you may want to visit the beautiful city of Bergen, on the southwestern coast of Norway. You can also reach Bergen by train, experiencing one of the most scenic train rides in Europe!\n\nEnjoy your Drøbak day trip!\n\nTravel Resources\n\nLastly, here is a complete list of my favorite apps and websites for travel planning.\n\nCan’t read now?
