        "text": "Drøbak was in the 19th century used as a winter port for the capital Oslo, because the fjord froze in winter time. The most famous story is Oscarborg Fortresses role during the Norwegian campaign of World War II. On 9 April 1940, the fortress sunk the German cruiser Blücher and thus delayed the Nazi German invasion of Norway.\n\nToday the town is a picturesque little spot, which consists mostly of small, whitepainted wooden houses. Especially in summer, the town is used as a seaside resort for many tourists, who find many scenic attractions here. From the harbor in Drøbak there is a ferry to the former fortress Oscarsborg, which has been converted into a museum and a hotel resort. During the summer season, the fortress can also be reached by a separate liner boat from Oslo/Sentrum. Mandatory for those with an interest in history and beautiful sceneries.\n\nBy plane\n\nOslo Airport Gardermoen, Norway’s Main Airport. Travelling time by car to Drøbak is approximately 1 hour (50% more during busy day hours through Oslo Ring Road).\n\nFor more information on facilities at and around Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, see the Oslo Airport, Gardermoen article.\n\nBy boat\n\nGood moorings if you have your own boat.\n\nIn the period April 15 to September 30 you may travel to Drøbak by ferry. The ferryboat leaves every day from Aker Brygge in Oslo, landing at Sjøtorget in Drøbak. This ferry stops at Oscarsborg Fortress and Håøya.\n\nBy bus\n\nBus routes 541 and 542 from Oslo, about 40 minutes away. The fare is 74kr.\n\nBy car\n\nEuropean Route E6 is going through Frogn municipality in the north-south direction (from Oslo and the Swedish border). Follow signs to Drøbak from the motorway. There is a sub sea tunnel at Norwegian National Road 23 under the Oslofjord from the west side of the fjord. (Hurum and Drammen where connected to the European Road E18)\n\nBy motorcycle\n\nThe mentioned routes for bicycles are tempting drives for MC-enthusiasts who want to avoid the motorway and enjoy curvy country roads.\n\nBy taxi\n\nA taxi from Oslo will cost you about 500-600kr in the daytime, and about 1000kr in the evening or at night. On longer taxi rides, it's OK to bargain with the driver for a fair price.\n\nThe town of Drøbak is small, and most can be reached on foot. For tours in the wider area Follo, the bus is the best option, both north towards the capital, Oslo and south towards Østfold county.\n\nDrøbak has good ports for small boats. The surroundings around Drøbak provide excellent opportunities to use a bicycle or motorcycle. If you drive a car, you should be aware of the many toll booths in the area. Taxi is a rather expensive alternative.\n\n1 Ferry to Oscarsborg Fortress."
