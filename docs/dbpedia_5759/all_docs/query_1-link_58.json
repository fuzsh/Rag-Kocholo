        "text": "The research station Biologen is situated right at the sill of the Oslofjord, which allows easy access to both the inner and outer fjords and their distinct marine communities. Within the station area, one can deploy loggers and other scientific equipment, such as underwater microscopes and experimental setups, quickly and easily. One has access to a rocky shore algae community directly from the station. Researchers can take samples in the vicinity using the two station boats.\n\nLaboratories and rooms\n\nBiologen offers a variety of laboratories, which we can adjust to the needs of your project. These include an aquaria room, smaller experimental rooms, a teaching lab with microscopes, a laboratory with two fume hoods, and a conference room and kitchen.\n\nTollboden is a teaching and conference centre located in beautiful downtown Drøbak. It is the perfect size for small workshops and university and school courses. It has two conference rooms of different sizes and two kitchens. Up to 21 people can be accommodated in several rooms. It also has three showers and a handicapped-accessible toilet. When the weather allows, guests can use the terrace and pier with a view of the Oslofjord.\n\nTeaching laboratory\n\nIn addition, guests can use a spacious teaching lab equipped with microscopes, TV screens, blackboards, a fridge, and two sinks to prepare samples. Outside, there are two 400-l pools that can be continuously supplied with surface seawater, and one can take samples directly from the pier."
