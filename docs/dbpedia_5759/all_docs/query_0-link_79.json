        "text": "Reenskaug Hotel lies at the heart of the small town of Drøbak. Enjoying a central location on the Oslo fjord, the hotel has been a popular holiday spot for more than 100 years. Over time, we have come to understand the importance of nurturing traditions and preserving what makes us distinctive. The result is a modern hotel that melds the old and new beautifully.\n\nMany famous artists have stayed at the hotel. One was the painter Edvard Munch, who is said to have been sent for from his summer house in Åsgårdstrand to rescue the celebrated Tulla Larsen – his former lover – who was languishing sick in her room here and pining for him. The author Knut Hamsun stayed at Reenskaug Hotel in 1904 and it was here, in room 213, with a view of the fjord and Drøbak’s main street, that he wrote his novel Sværmere, published in English as Dreamers.\n\nThe town has gradually developed into a rich art and cultural environment, and is often described as one of the gems of the Oslo fjord. The hotel is situated in the centre of Drøbak, within walking distance of all the town’s amenities and attractions such as the Christmas House, the Newspaper Artists’ Museum and a number of galleries. The ferry to Oscarsborg Fortress is also just a short walk away.\n\nMoreover, it’s just 20 minutes to Tusenfryd amusement park and 10 minutes to Drøbak’s attractive 18-hole golf course.\n\nYou will find everything you need here for an experience-packed and relaxed stay – holiday and conference alike."
