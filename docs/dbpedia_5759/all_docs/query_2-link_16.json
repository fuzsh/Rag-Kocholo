        "text": "âGroups of girls often come here to spend the night, often from far away. There are numerous special and unique shops here in DrÃ¸bak, so itâs the ideal place to combine an overnight stay and some hopping,â General Manager Kjetil Eide says just a short time after we have stepped in through the hotel entrance that suddenly appears in the midst of densely built, white wooden houses in the heart of DrÃ¸bak.\n\nGeneral Manager Kjetil Eide can share heaps of historic information and fun facts.\n\nâThere are also a surprisingly large number of people visiting us from Hadeland and Gran area, many of whom come here about 6-7 times a year. And I donât really have a good explanation for that,â Kjetil adds with a smile.\n\nâWe generally have a lot of return guests â people often want to stay in the same room and ideally they also like having the same waiter! We even have a guest who stays with us for two months every year and likes things just so! Itâs really nice to know that people feel so at home here,â Kjetil says.\n\nAfter enjoying a lovely lunch featuring lots of delicious ingredients, and we learn that the Reenskaug takes allergies very seriously, Kjetil shows several rooms that can be used to host weddings, confirmations, christenings and funerals, as well as birthday celebrations, summer parties, Christmas get-togethers and other festivities! The rooms are spacious and inviting. There is also a private dining room that is suitable for up to 10 people and is equipped with video conferencing equipment.\n\nYou can enjoy a delicious lunch in the restaurant.\n\nA course? A conference? A meeting? Itâs all possible here in this charming setting!\n\nâThis weekend, we have one confirmation with 37 people, one with 20 people and one with 25 people in three different rooms, all at the same time. Fortunately, everyone gets the same menu!â Kjetil says, before singing the praises of his wonderful kitchen staff.\n\nTo learn more about the hotel ghost, âMrs Bolletteâ, we head upstairs to have a look at some of the hotel rooms, including the Parrot Room and the Angel Room. We arrive at number 213 and learn that Knut Hamsun wrote SvÃ¦rmere (Mothwise/Dreamers) in this very room, the Hamsun Room. The historic furnishings are time appropriate, and the room probably looks just like it did back when Hamsun stayed here. And we catch a glimpse of the sea from here as well. We proceed to the Munch Room and learn that he had a lover staying nearby in room 215. He clearly had a generous soul.\n\nRoom 213, the Hamsun Room. Knut Hamsun stayed in the hotelâs corner room in 1903, while his new home was being built, and wrote the novel SvÃ¦rmere (Mothwise/Dreamers) here during that time.\n\nâMunch used to throw money out of the window to the boys selling cherries on Lehmannsbrygge, a bridge near the hotel. Every time they passed by the hotel to sell their cherries, he threw some spare change at them, to give them some extra money,â Kjetil says and tells us that they are planning to give the room a more historic design like the Hamsum Room.\n\nThe Parrot Room â perhaps somewhat surprising?\n\nWe move on to view the Parrot Room covered in parrot dÃ©cor and the Angel Room that has a fabulous bed. Kjetil tells us that many return guests request these rooms, but heâs not entirely sure why. There are also a number of ânormalâ rooms, all of which offer charming accommodation with comfortable beds, a minibar and crisp bed linen!\n\nFamous paintings used as insulation\n\nThere are lots of nooks and crannies in this fabulous building and Kjetil tells us with great enthusiasm what the various common areas and living spaces have been used for over the years â one of the rooms that is now a cosy living room with lounge furniture was once a piano bar.\n\nWe see several paintings by the artist Anton Thoresen, who was born in DrÃ¸bak, and learn that several of his paintings were actually found in the attic, having been used as insulation. Fortunately, they were taken carefully removed, restored and displayed here at the hotel.\n\nWe learn that this ghost with the white dress most probably was âMrs Bolletteâ, the lady who once owned and lived in Reenskaug right at the beginning. This gives us goosebumpsâ¦ Kjetil is sure that those people who have told him of their sightings were not aware of any other ghost stories, since they have never been spoken of publicly (until now!). Regardless, all the stories have always involved a lady in a white dress. The last story Kjetil tells us is the most bizarre of all.\n\nâThe strangest thing happened back in 1992. One morning we found beer glasses of various sizes stacked on top of each other from floor to ceiling filling the entire room where the bar used to be! Weâre talking about an whole room full of beer glasses! And we know for sure that there was no one in the building that night, and we also know that there were no such stacks of beer glasses when the last people left the building the day before,â Kjetil explains and we find ourselves immediately agreeing with everyone who thinks that Reenskaug Hotel should be on Ã ndenes Makt [Norwegian TV series âThe Power of the Spiritsâ].\n\nThe reception.\n\nItâs time to leave this idyllic gem of a hotel. We bid our farewells and wander out into the charming, narrow streets of DrÃ¸bak. Maybe weâll return to spend the night there some time, if only to have the opportunity to obtain our very own ghost story, though perhaps most of all to experience a stay in the Angel Room. We receive a text message from our Oslo-based friend Petter Larsen, who has seen some of the pictures we took at the hotel:\n\nPetter Larsen and his group of friends have nothing but praise for the Reenskaug Hotel.\n\nWe immediately decide to return as soon as we can. We know that lunch is good, but we still have dinner and breakfast to try! Perhaps weâll just do a \"Petter\" and treat ourselves to a night on the town with an overnight stayâ¦and perhaps a bit of shopping in the gorgeous little shops the next day. According to Kjetil, Reenskaug has apparently long been known as âthe fjord's best place for a night outâ among the slightly older crowd, and we can certainly understand how this place manages to be so popular with people of all ages."
