The bus provides safe and interesting transportation along the seaside to Oslo Fjordcamp at Hvervenbukta, which offers a nice beach (tel 455 04 765 / fjordcamp@naf.no). From here, choose Gamle Mossevei (”The old road to Moss”) which offers a picturesque route for bicyclists along the lake Gjersjøen and the amusement park Tusenfryd. The road continues along Bunnefjorden and another lake, Årungen. From there you will find a passage under the motorway, and from here most small roads will lead to Drøbak (follow signs). Further south there is also a bridge leading over the motorway. Useful map: på www.frogn.kommune.no/Kart\n\n• From Moss: Find the local road in the direction of Kambo that leads further on along the coast. Follow signs for Son on your way to Drøbak. You may also take a «side tour» to Hvitsten, a local community at the seaside – well known for it’s exhibited figureheads from historic trade vessels owned by Fred. Olsen Line. In general, the whole area is very suitable for bicycling, and the mentioned villages are well worth a stop on your way. We do recommend an up-to-date road map.\n\n• From Ski and Ås: Follow main road 52 in direction of Drøbak. Most of this distance offers separate, safe bicycle lanes. It takes you through a beautiful agricultural landscape with traditional farmhouses, most of them meticulously well kept. Along the road there are burial mounds from the viking era to be seen. Ski and Ås offers a regular railway connection to Oslo Central Station.\n\nMotorcycle Adventure\n\nThe mentioned routes for bicycles are also tempting drives for MC-enthusiasts who want to avoid the motorway and enjoy curvy country roads. Many MC riders prefer to take a break in Drøbak Harbour, where coffee, soft drinks etc. is available at the kiosk.\n\nTravelling by Air\n\n• Oslo Rygge Airport is the closest airport to Drøbak, 30–40 minutes away by car.
