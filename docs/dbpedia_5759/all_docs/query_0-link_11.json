        "text": "Drobak ‚Äì The Christmas Town in Norway\n\nChristmas and the merry festive season is over‚Ä¶ It is a long wait until December‚Ä¶ And you can‚Äôt wait‚Ä¶ If you are that kind of a person, then we have just the place for you ‚Äì a small town in Norway is known for celebrating Christmas all year round !! üòâ Go there and celebrate the merry season at your convenience!\n\nDrobak and all-year Christmas with Santa\n\nSounds too good to be true? Well, Drobak is a small town near Oslo, which is known to be the Christmas town in Norway ‚Äì a town where you can go if you feel gloomy during the year to get a piece of the Christmas cheer they enjoy all through the year!\n\nWhere the Christmas tree is always decorated, the Christmas lights are always on and gifts are exchanged all the time possibly‚Ä¶ Another peculiar thing about the Christmas house is that, this is one place where one can send letters to loved ones all year round, with Santa addressing them or if you are lucky maybe get to send a picture with Santa himself‚Ä¶ So, here‚Äôs the reason why it is the Christmas town of Norway ‚Äì it is said that near Drobak is where Santa was born! The jury is out on that with some claiming that Santa was born in the North Pole, but who are we to question the birthplace of the man who brings joy to the world? üòâ Ok ok, this isn‚Äôt Santa but his cousin who‚Äôs hometown is Drobak, but this does not stop the locals from celebrating the day of Christmas all year round! Why should it stop you? You also get to see signboards that say ‚ÄúBeware! Santa Crossing ‚Äù much like in some of the other Norwegian towns where signboards of ‚Äúbeware reindeer crossing drive slow‚Äù are common.\n\nWhen you are in the town of Drobak, watch out ‚Äì Santa might just surprise you!\n\nThings to do in Drobak\n\nThe town is also known for the old 1700s and 1800s built houses, which are currently safeguarded by the town. These were the settlements of the fishermen of the town, though now these are just tourist magnets of the town‚Ä¶\n\nDrobak is also known for many things other than the town where Christmas lives forever ‚Äì the garrisons, the art, the restaurants (if you are a foodie this is a place for you), golf (get your clubs along, it‚Äôs a great place to play your game in foreign lands ‚Äì why let vacation take the joy of playing away), the riding (if you like horses and riding is something you love, then this town is for you), tennis (bring out your inner Maria Sharapova)‚Ä¶ Oh, and the mermaids! Magic and Christmas and an all-rounder location for everyone in your group of friends or the family üòâ\n\nThe Catch\n\nExcited? Sounds too good to be true? Now, here‚Äôs the catch ‚Äì Christmas is actually pretty limited to the Christmas house which is near the city center. And Santa does show up out of the blue ‚Äì that‚Äôs a plus, right? üòâ\n\nEach city has its quirks, so visit the city with an open mind and enjoy the side of the city that excites you the most!\n\nBefore we forget, in case you are in time to experience the sun for 20 hours a day, then this is THE place to see the Midnight Sun! A glass of wine, a sandwich maybe, and a place in the Sun!\n\nThe town of Drobak is as complicated as the world around us, don‚Äôt you think? Explore it, your way‚Ä¶\n\nHow to get to the town of Drobak?\n\nIt‚Äôs a bus ride from the city of Oslo, Norway, for 70 NOK. if you have a vehicle at your disposal then this calls for a road trip!"
