We are known for our pleasant and informal environment, something we appreciate and work to maintain. In addition, over time and with laborious work, we have had a very nice golf course with top greens and high quality at all levels to suit most amateurs, yet challenging enough for even the best players. We have an open and transparent 18 hole parkway, which is very centrally located in idyllic Drøbak only 25 minutes drive from Oslo and Drammen.\n \nWe are proud of our golf course and facilities, and have received many praise words for green quality, layout and more, and we have been honored with the award: \"Premier European Golfcourse\" from the European Association of Golf Architects. We were also in 2010, as one of 3 sports teams, nominated for the Inclusion Prize by the Norwegian Sports Federation for our work to make the golf known and as an activity for everyone through, among other things, the Golf Green Merry concept.",
