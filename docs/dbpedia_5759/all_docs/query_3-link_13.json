Drøbak is a short commute from Oslo and a great place to escape the city, especially in the Summer on a Sunday. Read on to learn why.\n\nA First Timers Guide to Drøbak Near Oslo, Norway\n\nHow To Get There\n\nFrom Central Oslo, take a tram or bus to a station where you can board the 500 bus. It has 27 stops departing from Oslo Bussterminal and ending at Drøbak Brygge. We boarded at the Bjørvika stop. From there, the ride took about an hour. We jumped off right in the midst of everything at Drøbak Torg.\n\nWhat To Do\n\nMost of the shops are located along Niels Carlsensgate, Storgata and around the main square. On the summer Sunday when we visited, there were also various vendors on the square selling clothing and antiques.\n\nThere’s family friendly fun at the Follo museum (a short walk from the town center) and the aquarium (located minutes from the square). If you want to swim, Skiphellebukta and Elleodden is located south of the center of Drøbak. The family beach has a long shallow sandy beach, a large lawn and several rocks where you can sit and sun. And you don’t want to miss the Christmas House and Santa’s post office. The yellow wooden house on the square is the Nordic region’s only year-round Christmas house. In Drøbak harbor you will also find the Santa Claus traffic sign, right outside the Tourist Information Office (sadly, we missed this). What we didn’t miss was the three lively mermaid statues by the marina.\n\nOf course, there are multiple places to eat and drink. We enjoyed lunch at Håndverksbakeriet where I had the most amazing club sandwich, followed by drinks and dessert at Skipperstuen restaurant.\n\nWhen To Visit\n\nAs mentioned, most Norwegian businesses are closed on Sundays. But the town of Drøbak is brimming with life every Sunday, all year around."
