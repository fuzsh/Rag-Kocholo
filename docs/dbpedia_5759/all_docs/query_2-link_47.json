        "text": "The most western of the Scandinavian countries, Norway is famous for its spectacular fjords and glaciers, as well as its Viking history. Its capital city of Oslo is situated on the country's southern coast, and Norway's Viking heritage continues to be celebrated in the city, which is the location of the Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Viking Ship Museum (where Viking ships from the ninth century are on display). Oslo has a population of 673,469 residents in the city and around 1.7 million in the metropolitan area. In addition to being Norway's most populous city, it is also the administrative and economic center of the country.\n\nThe city of Bergen, on Norway's west coast, is the second-largest in the country, with a population of 280,216 in the city and 420,000 in the metropolitan area. Perhaps surprisingly given its location, Bergan has a relatively mild climate, even in winter. In fact, there can be a temperature difference of up to thirty degrees Celsius between Bergen and Oslo â€“ this is due to the Gulf Stream that keeps Bergan's coastal waters quite warm and the surrounding mountains that help protect the city from cold winds. In addition to being a popular tourist destination, Bergen is also a center of business (particularly the shipping and petroleum industries), finance and higher education."
