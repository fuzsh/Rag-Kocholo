Moorings - important information Drøbak boat harbor is a small boat harbor, and there is very little rolling of berths in the harbor, and there are currently no vacancies. From experience, only one country house berth (14 feet) will possibly be available approx. every five years. Larger berths will probably take even more years before some become available. We recommend that you contact Vindfangerbukta boat association in the north of Drøbak (see: www.vindfangerbukta.com ). Prices for berths of all sizes can also be found on Vindfangerbukka's website.\n\nView Details"
