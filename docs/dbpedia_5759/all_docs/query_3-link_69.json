        "text": "Oscarsborg Fortress is on an Oslofjord about 1.5 hours away from the city of Oslo and was once a military territory that has recently been made publicly available. The tour begins with a pickup from Oslo after which the short boat ride takes you sightseeing through the coastal areas and to the Oscarsborg Fortress. The fortress is known for sinking the German warship on 9th April 1940 called Blücher.\n\nThe tour lasts for about 2 hours at the fortress where a guide takes you to the Oscarsborg Museum after which you are taken to the small town of Drobak which is about 35km away from Oslo. Nicknamed as the Norwegian home for Santa Claus, the narrow streets and small wooden homes speak of culture and lifestyle that is vastly different from the hustle and bustle in Oslo. The town was an exporter for timber and ice for nearly 200 years because of which the businesses in the area have flourished."
