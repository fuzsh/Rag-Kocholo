        "text": "We're delighted to be able to welcome you to Oscarsborg Festning situated on an idyllic island in the Drøbak Sound. There are two small islands connected by a bridge, and you can easily get here by ferry from Drøbak, just a short drive away from Oslo. You could even take the Ruter ferry from Aker Brygge during the warmer months of the year.\n\nA place for important decisions\n\nIn addition to being a place to make important decisions, Oscarsborg Festning is also the perfect venue to get inspired and learn new skills, in the midst of this stunning natural landscape. There are several hiking trails and historical monuments to explore, as well as a variety of galleries, museums and events to enjoy. In other words, you'll be stepping right into a historical treasure chest here in Drøbak. People of all ages will find lots to do at Oscarsborg Festning, a marvellous fortress with a fascinating history. Younger visitors can try fishing for crabs, getting up close to large canons, and exploring dark passageways and tunnels.\n\nMeetings, conferences & activities in a magical historic setting\n\nIf you're looking for a venue to host a course, conference or teambuilding event, it is essentially just your imagination setting the boundaries of what you can do here at Oscarsborg Festning! We have a number of activities on offer that can be booked as part of events, including guided tours of the hotel, RIBs, tunnel battles and murder mystery games! Who'll be the one to claim the title of the Oscarsborg Challenge? There's also a shooting range nearby for a thrilling teambuilding activity.\n\nFood & drink\n\nThe key to a truly memorable event is of course very much down to the food and drink! We place huge value on providing our guests with quality ingredients. During the summer, you can enjoy a great meal at our à la carte restaurant Forpleiningen, which has a wonderful outdoor terrace where you can watch the sun down down! You can also pre-order lunch or a 3-course \"Chef's Strawberry\" from Monday to Sunday. Dinner is served in the Forpleiningen restaurant, but we can even serve your meal in the Hovedfortet (main fortress) with a banquet menu if you prefer.\n\n9 April 1940\n\nOscarsborg is one of the most famous historical fortifications in Norway from the Second World War. This is where the Norwegian military sunk the German heavy cruiser Blücher on 9 April 1940, considered one of the most effective attacks on the German invaders. Today, there is no remaining military presence at Oscarsborg, but the swallowtail flag, the Norwegian naval ensign, still flies at the old fortress.\n\nDefence museums\n\nThere are no less than five museums on the island including the Fortress Museum and the Torpedo Battery, the Coast Guard Museum, the Fire Control Museum and the Canon Park. The Fortress Museum is open during the daytime and entry is free of charge all throughout the summer. Use your mobile to scan the QR code and you'll get a guided tour - just make sure to use headphones so as not to disturb other visitors.\n\nWelcome to Oscarsborg Festning!"
