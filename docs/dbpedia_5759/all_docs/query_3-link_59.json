        "text": "Skip capital prices and Northern distances in favour of Oslofjord\n\nI fell in love with Oslofjord during Norway’s short, warm summer, but with forest-set spas and a town where it’s always Christmas, the area has a winter feel that lasts year round.\n\nSet just outside Oslo, the area includes a fork-shaped inlet, which cuts through the land with water from the North Sea. Colourful towns and cities are scattered east and west of the oceanic fjord made up of various straits and sounds. Drøbak, a pretty harbour town, is an ideal base for exploring, set a 20 minute drive from downtown Oslo - or 30 minutes by bus or train.\n\nThe area comes under the district of Østfold, the motto of which is ‘The Heart of Scandinavia’. Much like the sagas and folklore of the Scandinavian kingdoms, the names and geography of this county are frequently perplexing to outsiders.\n\nLike the capital, Oslofjord’s settlements have gone from being sleepy villages to places of profound visibility on the business map. Impressive infrastructure has shot up amongst historic listed grounds and buildings - all surrounded by raw natural beauty. Nowhere does lifestyle alongside and within nature quite like the Norwegians.\n\nYou can go petroglyph and ancient burial mound-spotting - and fossil trailing over on the west bank of the fjord at Slemmestad, next to a fantastic nautical museum at another booming marina, Vollen. They have a diving centre and an excellent Scandi-Italian fusion waterside restaurant. But the fjord’s east is mostly where I’ve made my own tracks - and kept coming back.\n\nDark history made light\n\nThe fjord itself was the stage of some of European war history’s most electrifying scenes, such as the sinking of the German battleship Blücher during the dramatic 1940 Battle of Drøbak Sound. The vessel still eerily lies underwater, close to the 1948 Oscarsborg Fortress, which delivers detailed guided tours retelling that fateful night.\n\nAnne Felberg, a former soprano, keeps the drama of this location alive by arranging an annual summer opera in the fortress, where people dress up, arrive by boat and banquet before the week-long opera run - this August’s edition will feature performances of La Fille du Régiment.\n\nStay at the low-key Reenskaug hotel in the Oslofjord town of Drøbak, where Knut Hamsun, amongst other Norwegian bohemian literati, would write. Alongside views over Båthavna, restaurants are one of the town’s calling cards. Enjoy akvavit-laden luncheons at Skipperstuen, or have snaps (a potent Nordic spirit) and reindeer at the characterful Kumlegården.\n\nThe town also enjoys an evergreen yuletide at the Julehuset emporium run by the charismatic Eva Johansen. Selling an abundance of Nordic festive oddities - there’s a Santa riding a pig, and lots of stuffed mice - thousands of letters to Santa arrive here each year, and a photograph of Johansen with the King of Thailand’s first wife in the grotto is pride of place.\n\nFor more on the region’s cultural history there’s the Follo Museum and famous South Pole explorer Roald Amundsen's House, both set in the woods near the water and engaging for both adults and children.\n\nMunch, Sonia Henie and other eccentrics\n\nVisitors will find artist, Reidar Finsrud at his multi-media gallery just outside Drøbak: clad in all-white dungarees he makes for a peculiarly fascinating presence as you wander the rooms.\n\nAfter an entire gallery of Phenisaurs (penis sculptures), countless oil portraits of nymph-like muses and a hand-kept garden of illustrious botanics and fountains, visitors will find an escape-room of sorts; a mind-boggling model city/railway of such elaborate mechanics. Miniature figurines cavort in a dystopian, NYC-like apartment penthouse.\n\nFinstrud’s garden is rivaled by that at Ramme. Formerly Munch’s summer home, it’s now inhabited by Petter Olsen, who famously sold the artist’s The Scream, and is set to open as a sprawling eco-luxe forest-fjord resort and farm estate near Hvitsten (a hilly town dotted with wooden houses and looming statues) this May\n\nThe organic farm and country estate will offer horse-riding, organic dining, and Shakespeare in the gardens. Find an impressive, high-security underground museum full of Munch built into rock beneath the hotel. It’s easy to reflect on the artist’s relationship with nature here, and a major exhibition curated by Oslo’s main Munch Museum will open at Ramme this summer.\n\nThis blend of nature and culture is continued at the wondrous 3500 m2-vast Henie Onstad contemporary art museum, opened in 1968 at the fjord’s tip in Bærum. Go to see work from Picasso, Monet and Kusama - plus installations, photography and artist talks from emerging global talent.\n\nRest and relaxation\n\nJust over an hour’s drive (or 90min train ride) from Drøbak are the neighbouring municipalities of Hvaler islands and Fredrikstad. Check out the Hope Cathedral, further south along the fjord on the Hvaler archipelago. Snug stays are plentiful: bed down on a horse farm on Kirkeøy or in an old-town guesthouse in Fredrikstad.\n\nVenture to Hvaler’s ‘capital’ Skjærhalden to find the simple-but-beautiful dining room of Første Reis, which serves fresh local dishes - halibut and potatoes covered in a dark sauce of apricot and chocolate is a must-try. Or enjoy the seafood platters and home-brewed beer mastered by the charming family-run Big Fish.\n\nDon’t miss a day of stomping the cobbles of Fredrikstad, a fortress town with old and new sides either side of the Glomma. Find gamey fare at Majoren’s Kro & Stue, an Alpine-meets-Nordic tavern based on hunting traditions. Jazz can be found at the local pub, Tamburen.\n\nA 40 minute drive from Drøbak will take wellness enthusiasts to spa hotel Støtvig in the ancient village of Larkollen. An in-house diner and bowling alley are the hotel’s quirkier offerings."
