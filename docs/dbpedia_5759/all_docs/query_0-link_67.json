As a thank you to the Drøbak community for the years she lived there, Ingeborg commissioned the mermaid statues and donated them to the city’s marina.\n\nThe plaque by the mermaids reads:\n\n“DE TRE HAVFRUER”\n\nGitt til Drøbak av Ingeborg Drangsholt\n\nmed takk for byens store\n\nhjelpsomhet\n\nTranslation:\n\n“THE THREE MERMAIDS”\n\nGiven to Drøbak by Ingeborg Drangsholt\n\nwith thanks for the town’s great\n\nhelpfulness\n\nReferences:\n\n● Ingeborg Lane tribute\n\n● http://www.oblad.no/badebyen/les-intervjuet-med-ingeborg-lane-1.3855285\n\n● http://www.oblad.no/badebyen/populere-havfruer-1.3893585\n\n● The Mermaids of Earth coffee-table book: See page 23 in the book about these sculptures.\n\nContribute additional pictures of these mermaids here."
