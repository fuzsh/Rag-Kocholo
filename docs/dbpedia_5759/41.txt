Located at the narrowest point of the Oslofjord, Drøbak is a traditional Norwegian town that’s clustered with old wooden houses now occupied by art galleries and restaurants. It was originally established in the mid-18th century as a winter harbour for Oslo when the upper reaches of the fjord were frozen.

Things to do in Drøbak

Spend an afternoon strolling the historic streets of Drøbak and admire the 18th-century wooden church that was gifted to the town by the timber merchant Niels Carlsen. Take note of the bronze mermaid statues by Reidar Finsrud beside the marina and pay your respects at the War Memorial, which forms part of leafy Badeparken Drøbak. During World War II, the Drøbak Narrows served as the setting for the sinking of the German cruiser “Blücher”. This event allowed the Norwegian Royal Family to be safely evacuated from Oslo.

You can get up close to native marine life at Drøbak Akvarium, which is home to various species that inhabit the waters of the Oslofjord. Come face-to-face with Hugo the catfish and see Norway’s only species of octopus, as well as spotted red sharks, beach crabs and large sea eels.

A short drive from the centre of Drøbak is the Follo Museum, an open-air museum that features historic farmsteads, houses and a school that have been relocated from across the region. See traditional crafts and trades being demonstrated and admire the vintage boats that once plied the Oslofjord before exploring the battery remains of the nearby Seiersten Skanse.
