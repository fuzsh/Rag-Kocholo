        "text": "Mauritius, is an island nation in the Indian Ocean about 2,000 kilometres off the southeast coast of the African continent. The capital and largest city is Port Louis. It is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the African Union. Formerly a Dutch colony (1638–1710) and a French colony (1715–1810), Mauritius became a British colonial possession in 1810 and remained so until 1968, the year in which it attained independence.\n\nThe people of Mauritius are multiethnic, multi-religious, multicultural and multilingual. The island's government is closely modelled on the Westminster parliamentary system, and Mauritius is highly ranked for democracy and for economic and political freedom. The Human Development Index of Mauritius is the highest in Africa. Along with the other Mascarene Islands, Mauritius is known for its varied flora and fauna, with many species endemic to the island. The island is widely known as the only known home of the dodo, which, along with several other avian species, was made extinct by human activities relatively shortly after the island's settlement. The Dodo was a flightless bird which was hunted to extinction in 1660. Mauritius is the only country in Africa where Hinduism is the largest religion. The administration uses English as its main language, however French is more spoken in the daily life.\n\nIt was amazing to see all these people from different religions, hindus, muslims, christians, buddhism as well as Chinese live side by side - in harmony! Yes we are struck by the island’s cultural diversity: Mauritius has a distinct Indian flavour, seasoned by African, Chinese, French and British cultures. This mix is reflected in the food, music and sounds of the island.\n\nTake Off in the harbour Caudan Bassin.\n\nThis pedestrian street was a 2 min walk from our boats and we had access to shopping malls, ice cream bars, restaurants …. felt very civilised considering our last port of call being Cocos Keeling Islands. Yes it felt very luxurous. The Caudan Waterfront is a sophisticated shopping mall and the vibrant tropical city of Port Louis is just through the underpass. Alex and Inez found and sat on the “Dodo”.\n\nThe luxurous Hotel Labourdonnais.\n\nA buzzling city ...\n\n… as well as busy blocks.\n\nEverywhere we could see these beautiful dancers dancing for different occasions according to their religion.\n\nWe visited a UNESCO World Heritage AAPRAVASI GHAT, protecting the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.\n\nThe Aapravasi Ghat is among the oldest surviving entry and transit point associated with indenture. This site symbolises the story of the more than 462 000 indentured labourers, the vast majority from India but also from China, the Corroros, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, South East Asia and Yemen, who were recruited to work on sugar plantations in Mauritius between 1834 and 1910. These men, women and children were part of the British Government’s “Great Experiment” to bring in another form of labour after the abolition of slavery.\n\nThe Aapravasi Ghat is where the ancestors of almost 70% of the Mauritian population arrived on the island from 1849 to 1920’s. After Mauritius became independent in 1968 the Aapravasi Ghat was gradually recognised as a major landmark for Mauritian history.\n\nThis was an amazing visit to understand the true story of Mauritius and the heritage it brings from its history.\n\nThis guy had his store at the beginnig of the shopping street and made some sort of drink from the sugar cane.\n\nHere we have a very happy girl who found our favourite place - the ice cream bar where we had ice cream.. yes I think nearly every day! So we had a go at all the tastes!\n\nWe are enjoying our ice-cream together here with Thomas from Hanna.\n\nIn every street corner we could find these small shops overloaded with all sort of things. You just wonder how on earth they know what they have in their store or even find what they have! But we had a specific request and we found it in this shop.\n\nFound this shop: thinking of sister Mado haha.\n\nOne of our sundowners together with the rest of the fleet: Ken on Aurora. Eileen on Aurora and Jeff and Anne on Sandvita.\n\nJeff and Joe on Altair. The Russians Sergej on Arabella and Michael on Cesarina."
