        "text": "Port Louis\n\nnational capital, Mauritius\n\nPort Louis, city, capital, and main port of the island of Mauritius in the western Indian Ocean. It lies between a well-sheltered, deepwater harbour, accessible to ships through a break in the coral reef, and a semicircle of mountains.\n\nPort Louis was founded about 1736 by the French as a calling place for ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa) on the passage between Asia and Europe. British occupation of the island during the Napoleonic Wars (1800–15) was a strategic factor in securing control of the Indian Ocean, but the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 resulted in the port being bypassed by shipping. Port activity increased during the closure of the Suez Canal (1967–75), and the harbour was modernized in the late 1970s. The city is the central collecting and clearing point for all imports and exports from Mauritius and its dependencies and is connected by road to the rest of the island. Sugar exports, once the mainstay of the economy, have been superceded in importance by manufacturing (notably textiles) and services (notably tourism).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nCapitals of Island Countries in the Indian Ocean Quiz\n\nThe city is dominated by an old fortress, the Citadel (1838), built on a hill almost in the centre. A small racecourse is located on the eastern side. Port Louis possesses Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, a natural history museum and an art gallery, several libraries, educational institutions, publishers, and research institutes, government offices, and the colonial-era Government House. In the late 1990s there was considerable development in Port Louis, including the addition of shops, restaurants, entertainment venues, and lodging in the city’s Caudan Waterfront area. Nearby is Aapravasi Ghat, an immigration depot used from 1849 to 1923 and the site where the modern indentured labour system was begun by the British government in 1834; it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2006. The University of Mauritius (1965) and the Sugar Industry Research Institute (1953) are at Réduit, just south of Port Louis. Pop. (2000) 144,303; (2011) 149,226.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaThis article was most recently revised and updated by J.E. Luebering."
