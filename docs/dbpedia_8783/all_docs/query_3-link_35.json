        "text": "Where Is Mauritius?\n\nThe island nation of Mauritius is located in the Indian Ocean. The nation consists of several large and small islands that together occupy an area of 2,040 square km. The nation is located 2,000 km off Africa’s southeastern coast.\n\nWhat Is The Capital Of Mauritius And Where Is It Located?\n\nThe city of Port Louis serves as Mauritius’ capital city. The city occupies parts of the Port Louis and Black River districts of the country. Port Louis’ importance is not just limited to it being the seat of government of Mauritius, but the city is also the country’s cultural and economic center. The city has a population of 149,194, as of 2012.\n\nHistory Of The Capital City Of Mauritius\n\nPort Louis played an important role in the global trade and commerce by virtue of its harbor that was already in use in 1638. The city became the administrative center of Mauritius in 1735 during the rule of the French government and has acted as the capital of the island since then. Prior to the construction of the Suez Canal, Port Louis acted as a major port of call for ships journeying from Asia to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope. The fact that the port was well-protected from cyclones due to the presence of the Moka Mountain Range helped enhance the significance of the port. Later, even though the value of Port Louis fell due to the opening of the Suez Canal, it regained the lost fame by developing the tourist industry which now supports the economy of the city in a major way.\n\nPresent-Day Role Of The City As The Capital Of Mauritius\n\nPort Louis houses the Parliament of Mauritius and is the meeting venue of the National Assembly of the country. The city’s economy depends largely on tourism, the manufacturing sector, port facilities, and a thriving financial sector. The main harbor of Mauritius is located in the city. Port Louis is also the location of the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Over 10 commercial banks also hold their offices in the city and serve a wide client base. The country’s central bank, the Bank of Mauritius, has its headquarters based in Port Louis. The Bank of Mauritius Tower, located in the city, is the country’s tallest building. Port Louis is also the cultural hub of Mauritius and attracts famed writers, poets, sculptors, and painters. The city houses a multicultural population and hence is culturally very rich."
