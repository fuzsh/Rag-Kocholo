        "text": "Mauritius, officially the Republic of Mauritius, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, about 2,000 kilometres (1,100 nautical miles) off the south-eastern coast of East Africa, east of Madagascar. It includes the main island, as well as Rodrigues, Agaléga, and St. Brandon. The island of Mauritius along with nearby Réunion (a French overseas department), are part of the Mascarene Islands. The main island of Mauritius, where the population is concentrated, hosts the capital and largest city, Port Louis.\n\nPort Louis is the capital city of Mauritius. Port Louis is the country’s financial and political centre, and the most populous city. It is administered by the Municipal City Council of Port Louis. According to the 2018 census, the population of the city was 147,066.\n\nPort Louis was used as a harbour by the Dutch settlers from 1606. In 1736, under the French government, it became the administrative centre of Mauritius and a major reprovisioning stop for French ships during their passage between Asia and Europe, around the Cape of Good Hope. The Port is named in honour of King Louis XV. During the period of French colonisation, Mauritius was known as Ile de France. The French governor at that time, Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais, contributed to the development of the city. Port Louis was selected to house both the main harbour and fort for the island. The port continued to be important during the British occupation of the island during the Napoleonic Wars (1800–15). However, ships coming into the port fell drastically following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.\n\nModernization of the port in the late 1970s helped it maintain its role as the central point for all imports and exports from Mauritius. The expansion of the tourism industry in the late 1990s led to considerable development in Port Louis, with many shops, hotels, and restaurants being built in the Caudan Waterfront area.\n\nThe economy of the city is mostly dominated by its financial centre, port facilities, tourism, and the manufacturing sector which includes textiles, chemicals, plastics and pharmaceuticals. Port Louis is home to the biggest port facility in the Indian Ocean region and is one of Africa’s major financial centres. Port Louis is the financial centre of Mauritius, located in Port Louis is the Stock Exchange of Mauritius. Also in Port Louis are over ten commercial banks that serve both domestic and offshore clients, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, leasing companies, and foreign exchange dealers.\n\nThe oldest bank based in Port Louis is the Mauritius Commercial Bank, which was founded in 1838. The Bank of Mauritius is the central bank of the country. Measuring 124 m (407 ft) from ground level to its pinnacle, the Bank of Mauritius Tower is the tallest building in the country.\n\nDue to concerns about high winds, there was some doubt whether we would be able to stop at Port Louis. However, it was with some relief that the winds dropped and we were able to enter Port Louis harbour. The city lies below the dramatic backdrop of various hills and mountains.\n\nThe harbour and port was very busy with ships from all around the world, the problems in the Middle East had no doubt increased traffic, although it was surprising to see a Taiwanese shipping fleet so far from home.\n\nThe cruise ship terminal, opened in 2010 and named after Christian Decotter, Cruise ships of up to 300 metres can be accommodated at the facility, the facility was the first in the Indian Ocean to be capable of handling some of the largest cruise ships in the world.\n\nShuttle buses were provided for the short 10 min trip into the city. We were dropped off at the Le Caudan Waterfront which has a number of restaurants and shops around the marina.\n\nOn the waterfront is the Blue Penny Museum which tells the story of one of the rarest stamps in the world.\n\nThe rather strange Umbrella Square is covered by Umbrellas, why we did not know but it did make for a colourful scene.\n\nEqually strange was the front of the casino whose entrance was like the front of a ship with a large lion looking quite fierce.\n\nThis is quite an interesting area to walk around with lots of signs and information and the odd old statue and cannonball.\n\nTo get from the waterfront to the city is via an underpass because the roads are quite busy\n\nand many of the lights did not seem to be working and the crossings were being dealt with by the local traffic police.\n\nPlace d’Armes fills the space from the waterfront to the Government House. It is lined by century old palm trees and would make a lovely walk but just flanks the road.\n\nNear the city centre, there are several French colonial buildings that date to the 18th century, including the Government House which has a statue of Queen Victoria at the front.\n\nThe street signs in this area were quite difficult to follow but we did make our way to the Central Market.\n\nRegular readers will know that we love a market because it is a great way to meet the locals and see what is available locally.\n\nThis market was full of colour with vegetables and fruit\n\nand the wonderful smell of spices.\n\nAlthough early in the morning, the market was full of shoppers looking for bargains, at the back of the market were stalls with souvenirs. The stallholders were keen to show us their products which seemed quite expensive but they did like to haggle, so a more reasonable price was found.\n\nIn a back street, near the market were buildings from old Port Louis.\n\nNearby was the Mauritius Postal Museum, housed in an old stone building that dates to the 18th century, and houses displays of stamps and postal paraphernalia from Mauritius and around the world.\n\nNext door was an 18th century Windmill.\n\nThinking it was time to take a break and relax, we headed towards the Jardin de la Compagnie,\n\nSitting under the rather exotic trees, our attention to the rather noisy birds at the top of the trees, we were surprised they were not birds at all but fruit bats or flying foxes.\n\nWe had come across these bats in Fiji, so were fascinated that they were here as well.\n\nPort-Louis-born poet and semiologist Khal Torabully has designed a Travellers’ Lane in the park\n\nso there were a number of statues, sculptures and wise words from a number of people like Nelson Mandela.\n\nNear the park is The Natural History Museum of Port Louis which houses exhibits of the fauna of Mauritius, with a gallery devoted to birds and terrestrial animals, a second focusing on marine species, and a third focused on the dodo, the famous Mauritian bird which became extinct during the Dutch occupation.\n\nThe Dodo’s image is found everywhere in Port Louis and is one of the iconic images of the city.\n\nThe museum was quite old school with lots of models and stuffed animals but was fun and interesting.\n\nPort Louis is a fascinating mix of old and new, there are numerous buildings and monuments that reflect its rich and diverse colonial history. Unfortunately we did not have time to visit the many religious buildings like the Jummah Mosque, the English Saint James Cathedral, the Indian Tamil Temple, the Port Louis Theatre (Théâtre de Port-Louis), the Champ de Mars Racecourse, and the Chinese Pagoda.\n\nA cruise stopover does give you time to get a taste of Port Louis but you need longer to really explore the city and the other parts of Mauritius.\n\nOld Fogies Travels are the adventures of two elderly Londoners (The Old Fogies) as they explore their home town and travel around the world looking out for the ordinary, strange, unusual and absurd."
