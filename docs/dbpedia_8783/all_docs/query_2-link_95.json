        "text": "Mauritius, known officially as the Republic of Mauritius an Indian Ocean island nationÂ which is locatedÂ off the southeast coast of the African continent. It is also known for its beaches, lagoons and reefs, the mountainous interior includes Black River Gorges National Park, with rainforests, waterfalls, hiking trails and wildlife like the flying fox. Capital Port Louis has sites such as the Champs de Mars horse track, Eureka plantation house and 18th-century Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Gardens ,. It is a volcanic island of lagoons and palm-fringed beaches with coral reefs surrounding most of the coastline.Â\n\nThe island is situated approximately 2400 kilometers off the South East Coast of Africa. The island covers an area of 1,865 square kilometers or 720 square miles, with 330 kilometers of coastline. Mauritius is 45km in width and 65km in length.\n\nMauritius is a densely populated island of around 1.3 million people. It has a reputation for stability and racial harmony among its mixed population. Mauritius is known as a plural society where all the ethnic groups present: Hindus, Muslims, Creoles, Chinese and Europeans live in peace and where all the ancestral cultures have been preserved. These features make the island a unique place in the world, and the Mauritians known for their tolerance and kindness towards all people.\n\nMost Mauritians are bilingual being equally fluent in French and English. English is the official language, but French and Creole are widely spoken. Oriental languages also form part of the linguistic mosaic.\n\nMauritius has preserved its image as one of Africa's few social and economic success stories, being a sugar and clothing exporter and a center for up market tourism.\n\nMauritius was first discovered by the Arabs as early as in the 10th century, but officially explored by the Portuguese in the 16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch in the 17th century. The Dutch were the ones who named the island in honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU.\n\nMauritius was occupied successively by the Dutch (1598-1712) and later by the French (1715-1810).\n\nThe French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing the Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane.\n\nThe British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars through the Treaty of Paris. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later on, an air station playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. On 12 March 1968, Mauritius became Independent.\n\nMauritius Things to Do\n\nMauritius has earned the reputation of a top holiday destination, but only few of the island visitors know that Mauritius is one of the leading destinations in the world while referring to the large variety of the activities it offers in comparison to its size.\n\nWhen visiting Mauritius you are sure to benefit from an amazing selection of almost 200 activities, attractions and places of interested all waiting to discovered.\n\nFrom more traditional museums, parks and reserves, to extreme activities, sea cruises, island trips and many more, you will find it all!\n\nSo make sure to discover the real Mauritius to the fullest via the various fun and exciting activities it offers!"
