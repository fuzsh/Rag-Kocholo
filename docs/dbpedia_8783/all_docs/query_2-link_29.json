Because the street art is incredible, and also #you’reworthit.\n\n*This site contains affiliate links, where I earn a small commission from purchases you make, at no cost to you.\n\nMauritius is the ultimate island getaway destination- known for its paradise beaches and incredible marine wildlife. I’m well aware that as a general rule, tourists and travellers don’t flock to this African nation in order to pay a visit to its capital city. But that does not mean that Port Louis isn’t worth visiting- this is a city with a rich cultural history and surprises around every corner. In fact, I’d go so far as to say I blooming’ loved this metropolitan hotspot.\n\nWorking on a cruise ship which docked in Mauritius, I was able to spend several months getting to know this beautiful city, and absolutely loved every second. Here are some of my most favourite of all the ideas of what to do in Port Louis.\n\nA brief history of Port Louis\n\nOnce upon a time, many moons ago, Port Louis was a key stopping point for ships from the Dutch East India Company, on their way from Europe to Asia. The Indian Ocean is a vast expanse so it makes sense that sailors would need to stop to stretch their legs and restock with provisions. (Also Mauritius is beaut, so that’s surely a massive bonus.)\n\nWhen the French took over in 1736 they renamed the Dutch ‘Harbour of Tortoises’ as ‘Port Louis’ after good old Louis XV. (We know all about him from that trip to Versailles, don’t we pals!?). Although Mauritius was governed by the French for less than 100 years- and was consequently under British rule until 1968- Mauritian Creole is still the language de rigueur round these parts. (Although English is widely spoken, too).\n\nWhen the Suez Canal opened in 1869- cutting out the lengthy journey by sea around the Cape of Good Hope- Port Louis fell off the radar for passing ships. It was no longer such a desperate necessity to stop for refreshments as the journey to Asia was nowhere near as lengthy. But Port Louis remains Mauritius’ central hub, and the city is the financial and political centre of the island nation, with a whole load of money being poured in to its regeneration and modernisation.\n\nWith tourism now one of Mauritius’ key money-earners, there are also plenty of activities and sights in Port Louis to draw in the crowds.\n\nTravelling in Mauritius on a budget\n\nVisit Le Caudan Waterfront\n\nLe Caudan Waterfront is a mahoosive glossy development right next to the port itself. If you’re a crew member like me, you will almost certainly become a regular here- there are shops and restaurants galore to kill time at.\n\nAlso- the wifi is wonderful.\n\nLea Café is my favourite place for coffee, delicious Middle Eastern food, and super friendly staff. It’s also, weirdly, where I had Christmas Day lunch all by myself whilst FaceTiming my pals back in England- so that’s proof in how great the wifi is! The Sunset Cafe is a spot with tonnes more outdoor seating and some delicious cocktails, and there are also plenty of options at the food court- whether it’s Mauritian, Greek, American or Chinese food. They’ve pretty much got it all here.\n\nIf you want an amazing Indian restaurant in Port Louis, go to Namaste. The restaurant is upstairs at Le Caudan Waterfront, with an open air balcony overlooking the harbour- and the food is absolutely delicious. They’re also brilliant at catering to vegans and vegetarians. Good on you, Namaste.\n\nSpot the street art in Chinatown\n\nI feel incredibly ignorant admitting this, but I was surprised to learn that Port Louis has its own very tiny Chinatown- four blocks in total, in fact. And for anyone questioning what to do in Port Louis, I would 100% recommend a visit to Chinatown as the number one activity. Especially if you like spotting street art, like me.\n\nPort Louis Chinatown began life when the first Chinese immigrants arrived and is actually over 160 years old. Once the epicentre of trade on the island, the area started to decline into shadiness when supermarkets became popular and younger members of the Chinese population began to leave.\n\nRealising that Chinatown was in danger of disappearing, the locals started a New Chinatown Foundation to spruce the place up and breathe some much needed life into the area. And they’ve done an absolutely BARNSTORMING job.\n\nI mean, pals- check out how colourful this wonderful spot is!\n\nPort Louis Central Market\n\nThe Central Market is a hive of activity, with one outdoor thoroughfare from where you can head off into the covered market sections on either side. This market is massive, raucous, and filled with aromas both pungent and delicious.\n\nBrowse the array of tropical fruit, vegetables and spices and hopscotch over the discarded leaves and peelings which litter the floor. Cram yourself full of roti, noodles and all the smoothies, and don’t forget to say hi to the man selling herbs right by the entrance. (I personally never bought anything from him in case ship security thought it was drugs and confiscated it. But he’s a real character that’s for sure.)\n\nThe best beaches on the west coast of Mauritius\n\nIf you head on to the second floor, prepare to hear all the sales patter from all the salespeople. Me and my pals found it weirdly entertaining (we did buy some things, promise).\n\nA word of caution: stay out of the meat section. There is minimal refrigeration. (By minimal I mean pretty much none). And get there first thing in the morning so you don’t miss any of the action.\n\nThe Jummah Mosque\n\nThe Jummah Mosque is frequently listed as one of the most beautiful buildings in Mauritius, and therefore is a must on the list of what to do in Port Louis. Behind the heavy carved wooden doors at the entrance is one of the prettiest courtyards I’d seen in a long old time, housing a grand old almond tree under a glass roof.\n\nLocated on a corner in Chinatown, the mosque is an ornate white and turquoise building built in the late 1800s for the growing Muslim population who were arriving from India. Mauritius is a truly multi-cultural kind of a place, and over 17% of the population now counts themselves as a Muslim.\n\nAs long as it’s not time for prayers, visitors are welcome. Just cover up and keep your voices hushed- and if you want to visit but aren’t dressed particularly modestly (let’s face it, that’s tricky when it’s so humid), let someone at the mosque know and they’ll offer you a robe to cover up with.\n\nA Visit to the Jummah Mosque, Port Louis\n\nGet your learning cap on\n\nYou know how much I love to get my learning on, don’t you pals!?\n\nThe Blue Penny Museum is located at Le Caudan Waterfront, and tells the tale of Mauritius’ colonial and maritime past, from the very first Dutch settlers all the way to the present day. It also houses the blue and red penny stamps from where the museum got its name. These bad boys are some of the rarest and most valuable stamps in the world, don’cha know? I definitely wouldn’t class myself as a stamp fanatic but the fact that two of these sold for $4 million back in the 90s is still rather awe-inspiring.\n\nThe Blue Penny Museum is open from 10am-5pm Monday-Saturday. Entry cost for adults is Rs. 245 (about €5), or Rs. 50 for all Mauritian residents.\n\nHiking Le Morne Brabant\n\nThe Natural History Museum is the place to head to if you ever wondered what a real dodo looked like. These big old birds only ever lived on Mauritius- but soon after the first humans arrived here, things took a turn for the worse. For the hungry sailors, dodos were easy to catch and easy to cook. As more and more humans settled on the island, the dodos’ habitat was destroyed whilst they were simultaneously over-hunted. So, alas- you won’t find a real life dodo bird in the Natural History Museum or anywhere but you can see a full on skeleton. And as a bonus, it’s completely free of charge to visit.\n\nThe National History Museum is open from 9am-4pm Mon-Fri, and 9am-12pm on Saturdays.\n\nAapravasi Ghat\n\nThe Aapravasi Ghat was built by the British Government in 1849. The first depot in the world to receive indentured immigrants, this was a crucial part of the so-called ‘Great Experiment.’\n\nWith all those plantations around the world which had relied on slavery for success, what could the British do to keep prospering after it was abolished? The answer, it seemed, was in this ‘Great Experiment’ into indentured labour. Labourers were brought from India, China, Madagascar and the coast of East Africa, to work on the sugar plantations. They weren’t paid a single penny; instead they worked to pay off the cost of their passage to Mauritius, and in exchange for their food and shelter.\n\nIn case your curious: Here’s my take on the whole talking about colonialism thing\n\nI’ll be honest pals, although the working and living conditions were arguably slightly better than slave labour, the only real difference I can see is that after many years, the indentured workers were free. But maybe that’s simplifying it a bit; admittedly I’m no expert on the subject.\n\nAbout half of the original Aapravasi Ghat site remains, including some of the buildings which housed the immigrants, a hospital, and some kitchens. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it’s also the place where the ancestors of many Mauritians first stepped foot in the country. Which is pretty crazy when you think about it.\n\nAapravasi Ghat is free to visit. Open 9am-4pm Monday-Friday, and 9am-12pm Saturdays\n\nVisit a Hindu Temple\n\nThere are several Hindu temples in Port Louis. And whether you go in or just admire from the outside, there’s no way that a visit should be left off of a list of what to do in Port Louis.\n\nThe Kannanur Mariamman Kovil isn’t far from Aapravasi Ghat, and Madurai Mariamman Kovil is located within walking distance of Le Caudan Waterfront and the port area. These brightly coloured, outrageously ornate temples are a haven of peace and quiet in the midst of the craziness of Port Louis.\n\nVisiting Ganga Talao, Mauritius’ Most Sacred Spot\n\nDrink cocktails at Le Suffren\n\nFor a chilled out evening vibe and some of the most incredible cocktails you could ever hope to taste (or see, because some of them truly are a spectacle), get yourself down to Le Suffren Hotel at Le Caudan. (It’s also a great choice of hotel for staying in Port Louis.)\n\nThe atmosphere on the outdoor patio of the On the Rocks Bar in the evening is downright lovely, and this is a great spot to sit with pals with the twinkly lights of the port as the backdrop. It’s easy to forget you’re almost inside the hustle and bustle of the city itself. For those searching for a full on party, the hotel’s Pink Socks bar on a Friday or Saturday is the place to go.\n\nPort Louis may not be the first port of call for visitors to Mauritius (unless you literally call into the port, like me on my cruise ship). But there’s no shortage of interesting things to do here. Even for just a day, I’d definitely recommend heading to the capital city just to soak up the culture of this incredible place and learn a little bit more about the islands incredible past, and present.\n\nWant more gems of info for your future travels?\n\nSign up here to get newsletters from time to time, delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nI consent to receiving emails and personalised ads.\n\nLeave this field empty if you’re human:"
