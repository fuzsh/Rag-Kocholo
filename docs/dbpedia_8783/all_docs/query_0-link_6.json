        "text": "Champ de Mars Racecourse: Local color abounds at this thoroughbred track, founded in 1812 and set amid towering volcanic peaks. Try to snag a pass to the Mauritius Turf Club boxes.\n\nCentral Market: Just up from the waterfront, the city's primary fruit, vegetable, meat, and fish market blends the sights, smells, and tastes of both Africa and Asia.\n\nCaudan Waterfront: This first-rate urban renewal project mixes restaurants, handicraft shops, artisan spaces, and even a casino with historical attractions like the Blue Penny Museum (all about stamps) and the adjacent Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site.\n\nChinatown: Far more than Singapore or San Francisco, Port Louis's ethnic Chinese neighborhood is still the real McCoy, a warren of shops, shrines, and eateries that dates back to the 1820s.\n\nSouvenir Hunters: Between Chinatown, Caudan Waterfront, and Central Market, there's plenty to purchase in Port Louis.\n\nGamblers: Take a spin at roulette in the casino, plunk down some cash on the ponies at Champs de Mars, or work your way into a mahjong game in Chinatown.\n\nThere Are No Beaches: Those questing sun, sea, and sand will need to hop a taxi to Turtle Bay on the north shore or Albion or Flic en Flac farther south.\n\nTake a Taxi Into Downtown: Although it's little more than a mile, the walk from the cruise ship jetty in Les Salines to downtown Port Louis is through a drab, boring industrial area."
