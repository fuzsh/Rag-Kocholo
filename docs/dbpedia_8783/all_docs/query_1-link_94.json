In \"Administrative Subdivisions of Countries\", I reported that ISO 3166-2 (at that time in draft form) showed Mauritius divided into five cities, nine districts, and three dependencies. In my opinion, the five cities were not really first-level subdivisions, but were parts of two of the districts. The standard listed Port Louis city and Port Louis district, both with the code MU-PL. I didn't point out the ambiguity of the code, because I wasn't treating Port Louis city as a subdivision. In this newsletter, ISO has apparently recognized the code conflict, and changed the code for Port Louis city to MU-PU.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameMAURITIUS ISO codeMU FIPS codeMP LanguageEnglish (en) Time zone+4 CapitalPort Louis\n\nAlthough Mauritius was a British colony from 1814 until it gained independence on 1968-03-12, its place names retain a strong flavor of older times when it was the French colony of Île de France.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Mauritius\n\nDutch: Mauritius, Republiek Mauritius (formal)\n\nEnglish: Republic of Mauritius (formal)\n\nFinnish: Mauritius\n\nFrench: Maurice f\n\nGerman: Mauritius n\n\nIcelandic: Máritíus\n\nItalian: Maurizio\n\nNorwegian: Mauritius, Republikken Mauritius (formal)\n\nPortuguese: Maurício m, Maurícia, Maurícias fp, Ilha f Maurício (Portugal), República f do Maurício (formal)\n\nRussian: Республика Маврикий (formal)\n\nSpanish: Mauricio m\n\nSwedish: Mauritius\n\nTurkish: Mauritius Cumhuriyeti (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nnamed by early explorers after Maurice of Nassau (1567-1625)\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nMauritius is divided into nine districts, two dependencies, and one region.\n\nDistrictTypHASCFIPSPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)Capital Agalega IslandspMU.AGMP212747027Port Louis Black RiverdMU.BLMP1276,604259100Tamarin Cargados CarajospMU.CCMP2210Port Louis FlacqdMU.FLMP13135,406298115Centre de Flacq Grand PortdMU.GPMP14110,907259100Mahebourg MokadMU.MOMP1582,30223189Moka PamplemoussesdMU.PAMP16136,26817969Pamplemousses Plaines WilhemsdMU.PWMP17362,29220579Beau Bassin-Rose Hill Port LouisdMU.PLMP18118,4314417Port Louis Rivière du RempartdMU.RRMP19106,26714857Poudre d'Or RodriguesrMU.ROMP2340,43410440Port Louis SavannedMU.SAMP2067,90624394Souillac 12 divisions1,237,0912,041787\n\nTyp: d = district, p = dependency, r = region\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.

This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names:\n\nPamplemousses: French for grapefruit (plural)\n\nChange history:\n\nThe divisions of Mauritius according to the 1952 census were these:\n\nDistrictPop-72Pop-52 Black River23,86613,430 Flacq89,05056,867 Grand Port80,71952,709 Moka48,61027,961 Pamplemousses68,94840,663 Plaines Wilhems261,004149,399 Port Louis133,99684,539 Rivière du Rempart66,99540,323 Rodrigues24,76913,333 Savanne53,01135,309 Other dependencies3661,752 Total851,334516,556\n\nDistrict: Rodrigues is a\n\ndependency.

The district councils (and their capitals) were Moka-Flacq (Quartier Militaire), North (Mapou), and South (Rose Belle). The urban councils were Beau Bassin-Rose Hill, Curepipe, Port Louis, Quatre Bornes, and Vacoas-Phoenix. The dependencies were Agalega Islands, Cargados Carajos Shoals, and Rodrigues Island. The urban councils are the same as the cities mentioned under \"Further subdivisions\". I believe that these governmental divisions are less representative than the geographical divisions in the main table.\n\n~1976: Moka-Flacq district council (capital Quartier Militaire, FIPS code MP05) split into Flacq and Moka districts. North district council (capital Triolet, FIPS code MP06) split into Pamplemousses and Rivière du Rempart districts. South district council (capital Rose Belle, FIPS code MP10) split into Black River, Grand Port, Plaines Wilhems, and Savanne districts. The five urban councils were apparently absorbed into their respective districts.\n\n2001-11-20: Status of Rodrigues Island changed from dependency to island region.\n\nOther names of subdivisions:\n\nCargados Carajos: Saint-Brandon (variant)\n\nRodrigues: Rodriguez (obsolete)\n\nPopulation history:\n\nDistrict1846-08-011851-11-201861-04-081871-04-111881-04-041891-03-061901-04-011911-03-311921-05-21 Black River6,83110,09117,17111,99715,29215,69814,06314,94514,717 Flacq19,18224,18641,46849,49956,02256,73455,18851,89853,423 Grand Port16,75619,08237,20744,22652,98248,16949,56849,07950,373 Moka4,6615,72517,70421,23629,76832,55235,25832,71929,897 Pamplemousses28,81532,03653,59842,97837,67038,54739,01737,38137,448 Plaines Wilhems12,78413,89328,02035,14746,31557,59163,63467,86675,688 Port Louis45,21249,90974,52563,27466,65262,16952,74050,06050,307 Rivière du Rempart15,06116,03019,33120,24220,72624,15126,67931,05131,807 Rodrigues4956931,1081,4312,0683,1624,8296,584 Savanne9,1609,87121,02627,44334,44734,97734,87633,79232,825 Total158,462181,318310,743317,150361,305372,656374,185373,620383,069\n\nDistrict1931-04-261944-06-111952-06-301962-06-301972-06-301983-07-021990-07-012000-07-022011-07-03 Black River14,26312,50213,43018,56826,17136,86143,76860,58776,604 Flacq52,64050,84256,86773,06189,050107,670112,773126,839135,406 Grand Port48,61946,53352,70969,02380,71993,18096,667106,665110,907 Moka29,28322,86327,96137,24548,61061,20965,17675,47982,302 Pamplemousses36,84734,13140,66355,89968,94890,466101,666122,252136,268 Plaines Wilhems95,258120,170149,614208,184258,699303,993321,713358,182362,292 Port Louis54,43565,96284,539119,950133,996133,702133,073127,855118,431 Rivière du Rempart30,79233,23840,32353,30966,99580,99386,77998,854106,267 Rodrigues8,20211,88513,33318,33524,76933,08234,20435,77940,434 Savanne31,10132,94435,30946,38053,01158,78960,84166,35667,906 Total401,440431,070514,748699,954850,968999,9451,056,6601,178,8481,236,817\n\nData from source [7], except for 2011 census (source [8]). A few of these data disagree with those shown under Change history. Source [7] excludes \"Other dependencies,\" i.e., Agalega Islands. For 1952, source [4] has a footnote indicating that the total includes \"215 European mililary personnel and 56 crew members and passengers on ships in harbour.\" Source [7] must have put those 215 people in Plaines Wilhems, and omitted the 56 completely. For 1972, source [7] has moved 2,305 people from Black River to Plaines Wilhems. All totals exclude Agalega Islands.\n\nSources:"
