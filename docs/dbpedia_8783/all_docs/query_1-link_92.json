        "text": "Mauritius is the twinkling jewel in the Indian Ocean off the south-east coast of Africa that punches way above its weight. While sunny skies, sandy beaches and the warm Indian Ocean (the water is rarely cooler than a balmy 23°C / 73°F!) all come standard on a Mauritius holiday, this diverse island can truly be said to have something for everyone, whether you want a vibrant resort town with ample nightlife or a quiet nook where you can go hiking or birding.\n\nThe easiest way to decide where to go in Mauritius is to divide the island into four and match your interests and expectations with the best stretch of coastline and best places to visit. The northern and western beaches are generally busier and have more amenities and tourist attractions if you’re after an action-packed, sight-seeing vacation while the eastern and southern beaches are quieter and lend themselves to a ‘doing nothing much’ holiday.\n\nOf course, Mauritius is small enough that you can rent a car for the day and drive yourself to another beach or to see a particular landmark or tourist attraction – you won’t be ‘stuck’ in one place at all. Its coastal roads make for lovely driving and, along with a staggering selection of beaches, there are plenty of places of interest, like welcoming towns to pretty gardens and nature reserves in the island’s green and mountainous interior.\n\nHow to see a different side to Mauritius: while we have no doubt that your main reason for travelling to this sun-soaked island is sandy beaches and tropical sea, we’d also highly recommend a few days inland surrounded by forested hills woven with cool, clear streams and nature trails.\n\nThe Black River Gorges National Park is well known for its walks past thick jungle-like vegetation and pretty waterfalls, hiking and mountain biking trails, heavenly viewpoints, plenty of tortoises and fantastic birdlife including pink pigeons and green parrots – two rare species that have been bought back from near extinction. Abseiling from the Chamarel waterfall is not for the faint-hearted: it plunges about 95m / 312ft with spray that rises more than half way up!\n\nOther places worth leaving the beach for include the surrealistically striped sand dunes at the ‘Seven Coloured Earth’, which is also in the Chamarel region close to the Black River Gorges. These dunes are thought to date back approximately seven million years and vary in colour from the expected yellow and brown to the unexpected black, red and purple.\n\nAnd if you’re up in the north of the island, why not spend a few hours at the ‘Jardin des Pamplemousses’, botanical gardens with shady trees and giant water lilies? On your drive, stop at local farm stalls to buy fresh coffee, sugar cane and sweet pineapples."
