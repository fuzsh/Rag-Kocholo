        "text": "HISTORY OF THE CITY\n\nMauritius and its capital city, Port Louis, are closely linked in history. Port Louis was chosen, as from 1732, to be the port of the then Ile de France (former name of Mauritius). This was the ideal choice as Port Louis had the characteristics of a natural harbour with a strategic position in the Indian Ocean.\n\nBertrand FranÃ§ois MahÃ© de Labourdonnais, first governor of Mauritius, started the construction of Port Louis in 1735.\n\nPort Louis has the credit of being the birthplace of regional democracy in Mauritius, one century before the legislative assembly was created. The first municipality in the island was established in Port Louis in 1790 during the period of the French revolution. Thomas Enouf had been the first âMaire de Port-Louisâ in 1790 and was succeeded by ten other French mayors. However, this municipality was abolished in 1803.\n\nDuring what was known as the âpÃ©riode rÃ©publicaineâ, from 1790 to 1803, the name of the town changed on two occasions. From 1790 to 1793, the town was known as Port Louis. Port Louis became âPort de La Montagneâ in 1794 and this name was changed to âPort Nord-Ouestâ from 1795 to 1803.\n\nWhen General Decaen took over as governor of the island in 1803, the town was named as âPort NapolÃ©onâ. In 1810 when the island became British colony, Governor Robert Farquhar gave back its original name of Port Louis to the town. The municipal administration, established during the French period and abolished in 1803, was replaced by a district administration."
