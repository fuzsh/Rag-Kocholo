        "text": "Introduction\n\nPort Louis is the largest city and capital of the small island nation Mauritius, which is located in the southwest Indian Ocean. The city had a population of 148,416 people in 2010. Port Louis, located on the northwest coast of the main island, is an important financial services center and tourist destination. Due to tourism and a manufacturing economy based around the port, which includes the production of chemicals, textiles, plastics, and pharmaceuticals, Port Louis is one of the most prosperous African cities.\n\nThe history of Port Louis goes back to its founding and settling in the 17th century by Dutch mariners who named it Noordt Wester Haven. In 1736 the French took control of the island and renamed the city after French King Louis XV. The French used Port Louis as a port of call for ships that, on their passage between Asia and Europe, needed to go around the Cape of Good Hope inSouth Africa. The island was also used for sugar production. Enslaved people, imported from Madagascar, were summoned to work on the sugar plantations.\n\nData and facts\n\nCapital landmarks: Citadel Fort Adelaide, Bank of Mauritius Tower, Swami Vivekananda International Convention Centre, and Caudan Waterfront Casino.\n\nIncluding municipal city limits plus nearby communities, Port Louis’ land area measures 18 square miles (47 square kilometres) with an estimated population of 149,194 residents in 2015.\n\nAt the country level, Mauritius has a population equal to 1.3 million inhabitants as of July 2016.

Other services are provided to the city by the central government. These include police services through the Mauritius Police Force, which maintains two divisions responsible for the Port Louis area (Metropolitan Divisions North and South). There is also a specific Port Police, composed of the Harbour Police and Bulk Sugar Terminal Police. Their roles include providing security to cargo and facilities in the port area and enforcing laws related to harbor regulations, customs, quarantine, immigration, and drug trafficking.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economy is dominated by its port, which handles Mauritius' international trade.

US$75m) to roll out fibre across the island, and the project which was expected to be complete in 2020 was way ahead of schedule and saw completion last year.

It consists of a 3+6+5+2 system of formal education. The education system in Mauritius is categorized into 4 main sectors – pre-primary, primary, secondary, and tertiary. Pre-primary schools accept students from the age of three. Children from the age of five to eleven go to primary school. They are admitted to a standard I and gradually moves on to standard 6. Primary education ends with a national examination which is the Certificate of Primary Education (CPE).

Daily newspapers and weeklies offer balanced coverage in several languages. They are often critical of both the government and the opposition parties. Two media groups - Le Mauricien Ltd and La Sentinelle Ltd - dominate the press scene.\n\nCulture\n\nThough Mauritius is located near the African continent, its culture is quite distinct owing to its British and French colonial heritage and the predominant Indian population.
