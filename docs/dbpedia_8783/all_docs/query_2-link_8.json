        "text": "Port Louis is the capital of Mauritius, an island country in the western Indian Ocean. It is on the country’s main island, which is also called Mauritius. Port Louis is the country’s largest city and main port. It lies between mountains and a harbor.\n\nShipping goods through the port is important to the economy of Port Louis. Industries in the city make clothing, food products, and ships. Tourism also brings money to Port Louis.\n\nThe French founded Port Louis in about 1736. It was a port for ships traveling around southern Africa on the route between Europe and Asia. The British took control of the island in the early 1800s.\n\nThe port became less important after the Suez Canal was opened in Egypt in 1869. That waterway enabled ships to travel between Europe and Asia without sailing around Africa. In 1968 Mauritius became an independent country with Port Louis as its capital. Population (2014 estimate), 150,353."
