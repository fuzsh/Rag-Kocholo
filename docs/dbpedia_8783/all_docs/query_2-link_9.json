        "text": "Welcome to Port Louis!\n\nPort Louis is the capital city of Mauritius and you’ll find this lively economic hub in the northwest of the island. Port Louis is home to shopping malls, markets, offices, beautiful parks and historical landmarks. It is also known as one of the best cities in the world for street food!\n\nFor an authentic taste of Mauritius, head to Port Louis’ Central Market. This is where the locals shop. Stalls are piled high with juicy tropical fruits and vegetables and you’ll hear the sound of stallholders echoing around the hall as they shout prices and vie for your attention.\n\nMake sure you explore each section of the market. You’ll be rewarded with tasty sweet pastries and a thirst-quenching glass of the island’s creamy alouda drink.\n\nYou’ll find Central Market close to the Chinatown district, where the flavours continue inside tiny shopfronts. Biscuit shops, Chinese cakes and steaming dim sums freshly-stuffed with meat, fish or vegetables tempt visitors inside these colourful doorways. Explore the narrow streets and the shops that have been passed down from generation to generation. While wandering around, you are bound to spot some of the city’s street art. There is street art everywhere in Port Louis and many of these murals can be found in Chinatown.\n\nThe Caudan Waterfront is a great place to start exploring Port Louis, as there is plenty of parking and it’s an easy walk to shop-lined walkways where colourful umbrellas hang overhead. You can browse the big-named shops in Victoria Urban Terminal shopping mall and combine a shopping trip with a visit to Caudan Arts Centre, a cultural hub that offers art exhibitions, theatre productions and music concerts.\n\nTo learn about the island’s history, visit Aapravasi Ghat. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is the remains of an immigration depot and is a good place to learn about the Indian indentured labourers who arrived in Mauritius after the abolition of slavery.\n\nMauritius is one of the most multi-cultural countries in the world and this is reflected in the city’s architecture. In Port Louis, you can see Jummah Masjid mosque, St Louis Cathedral, Kwan Tee Pagoda and Sockalingum Meenatchee Ammen Kovil temple.\n\nWe hope to see you in Port Louis soon!"
