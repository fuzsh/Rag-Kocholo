        "text": "Discover the capital of Mauritius, Port Louis, where the island’s history and heritage are seamlessly incorporated into this vibrant city.\n\nPort Louis, the city, was founded in 1735 by French governor and pioneer Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais. Port Louis is the administrative and business center of the country, located on the northwestern coast.\n\nSome of the most popular local sites are just at walking distance, white others, situated on the outskirts of the city, will require transport. Don’t miss out on the following…\n\nThe Central market\n\nBehind the ancient cast iron gate, one finds heaps of local vegetables and fruit, colourful handicraft, a surprising herbal stand and many local specialties to taste amidst the hustle and bustle of the vendors.\n\nCaudan Waterfront – Exciting shopping and entertainment places coexist with excellent hotels and restaurants overlooking Port Louis Harbor. The Le Caudan Waterfront shopping complex, with its 170 boutiques, is a must-see for shoppers, providing luxurious shops, crafts, a food hall, and restaurants.\n\nPort Louis Main Market – The Port Louis Main Market (also known as the Port Louis Main Bazaar) is a must-see for its exotic fruits and vegetables, clothing, wooden & traditional handicraft goods, local jewelries, and souvenirs at rock-bottom rates. There is also a modest snack area with an eclectic selection of local foods.\n\nChinatown – Located in the city’s center, this area is densely packed with stores selling a variety of Chinese and Far Eastern goods. Chinatown also functions as the island’s apothecary, stocking a wide range of traditional herbs and plants.\n\nChamp de Mars – Champ de Mars is a famous horse racing track in Mauritius. The Mauritius Turf Club inaugurated the club on June 25, 1812, by the first British Governor, Sir Robert Townsend Farquhar, making it the oldest horseracing organization in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nFort Adelaide (also known as La Citadelle) – Located on the higher lands of Port Louis, this fortress was constructed in response to the surviving French settlers on the island’s dread of civil war. Fort Adelaide provides a panoramic view of Port Louis and its harbor.\n\nNatural History Museum – The museum is the oldest in Mauritius and houses an extensive collection of natural science artifacts, including a reconstruction of the world-famous dodo. The museum’s galleries enable visitors to learn about Mauritius’ natural history over the last 500 years.\n\nMarie Reine de la Paix – Pay your respects to the Virgin Mary at the Marie Reine de la Paix, a modern church with a 26-foot-high statue of the Virgin Mary on a 175-foot-high platform."
