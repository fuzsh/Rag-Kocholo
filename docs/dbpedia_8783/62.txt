Port Louis, Capital of Mauritius

Port Louis , the capital of Mauritius, was founded by the French governor and colonist Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais in 1735.

Situated on the north-west coast, Port Louis is the business and administrative capital of Mauritius. Packed with office-workers during the day, it quickly quietens down after office-hours – allowing visitors to enjoy a night out along the famous Caudan Waterfront.

Those arriving during daylight hours should head for the bustling Central Market or Champ de Mars: the oldest racecourse in the Indian Ocean region.
