Munich, Germany, 8-9 September 2011.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeltsch, Albert\n\n2011-12-01\n\nAt the Epigenetics Europe conference in Munich, Germany, held on 8-9 September 2011, 19 speakers from different European countries were presenting novel data and concepts on molecular epigenetics. The talks were mainly focused on questions of the generation, maintenance, flexibility and erasure of DNA methylation patterns in context of other epigenetic signals like histone tail modifications and ncRNAs.\n\nMajor Conference about Astronomical Technology in Munich\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2000-03-01\n\nPress Conference on Monday, March 27, 2000 Which are the latest astronomical discoveries made with the new 8-10 metre class astronomical telescopes? Will it be possible to construct even more powerful instruments on the ground and in space to explore the near and distant Universe at all wavelengths from gamma-rays to radio waves? Which research areas in this dynamical science are likely to achieve break-throughs with emerging new technologies? These are some of the central themes that will be discussed by more than 600 specialists from all over the world at an international conference in Munich (Germany), \"Astronomical Telescopes and Instruments 2000\" , beginning on Monday, March 27, 2000. During five days, the modern architecture of the new International Congress Center in the Bavarian capital will be the scene of lively exchanges about recent progress at the world's top-class astronomical research facilities and the presentation of inspired new ideas about future technological opportunities. The conference will be accompanied by numerous on-site exhibition stands by the major industries and research organisations in this wide field. This meeting is the latest in a series, organised every second year, alternatively in the USA and Europe by the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) , this year with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) as co-sponsor and host institution. The conference will be opened in the morning of March 27 by the Bavarian Minister of Science, Research and Arts, Hans Zehetmair .

The conference was organized by Roland Schmid and Matthias Ebert from the Technical University of Munich, Germany. The central theme of the meeting was 'translational gastrointestinal oncology: towards personalized medicine and individualized therapy'. The conference covered talks on markers for diagnosis, screening and surveillance of colorectal cancer, targets for molecular therapy, response prediction in clinical oncology, development and integration of molecular imaging in gastrointestinal oncology and translational research in clinical trial design. Owing to the broad array of topics and limitations of space, this article will focus on biomarkers, response prediction and the integration of biomarkers into clinical trials. Presentations mentioned in this summary were given by Matthias Ebert (Technical University of Munich, Germany), Esmeralda Heiden (Epigenomics, Berlin, Germany), Frank Kolligs (University of Munich, Germany), Florian Lordick (University of Heidelberg, Germany), Hans Jorgen Nielsen (University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Anke Reinacher-Schick (University of Bochum, Germany), Christoph RÃ¶cken (University of Berlin, Germany), Wolff Schmiegel (University of Bochum, Germany) and Thomas Seufferlein (University of Halle, Germany).\n\nSpace Radar Image of Munich, Germany\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1994-01-01\n\nThis spaceborne radar image of Munich, Germany illustrates the capability of a multi-frequency radar system to highlight different land use patterns in the area surrounding Bavaria's largest city. Central Munich is the white area at the middle of the image, on the banks of the Isar River. Pink areas are forested, while green areas indicate clear-cut and agricultural terrain. The Munich region served as a primary 'supersite' for studies in ecology, hydrology and radar calibration during the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) missions. Scientists were able to use these data to map patterns of forest damage from storms and areas affected by bark beetle infestation. The image was acquired by SIR-C/X-SAR onboard the space shuttle Endeavour on April 18, 1994. The image is 37 kilometers by 32 kilometers (23 miles by 20 miles) and is centered at 48.2 degrees North latitude, 11.5 degrees East longitude. North is toward the upper right. The colors are assigned to different radar frequencies and polarizations of the radar as follows: red is L-band, vertically transmitted and horizontally received; green is C-band, vertically transmitted and horizontally received; and blue is C-band vertically transmitted and received. SIR-C/X-SAR, a joint mission of the German, Italian, and United States space agencies, is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.\n\nProceedings of IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (4th) held at the Technische Universitat Muenchen, Munich, Germany on 17-19 Aug 2004.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2004-08-01\n\nMedizinische Elektronik, TU MÃ¼nchen, Munich, Germany) 16.25-16-45 TH_SP_6 Drug delivery for nerve tissue regeneration POSTER II POSTER I ORAL SESSIONS MAIN...Carolina 29208, USA) WE-P8 Effects of Synthesis Conditions on the Growth of MWCNTs Using an Ultra Sonic Evaporator with Pyrolysis of Hydrocarbon... regeneration , F.

In Munich (Germany), low emission zone and transit bans for heavy-duty vehicles were introduced in 2008 aiming at reduction of traffic emissions contribution to PM10. The effects of those measures on PM10 mass concentrations in Munich were investigated with a semiparametric regression model for modeling PM10 levels adjusted for time, background pollution, public holidays and wind direction. The reduction of PM10 concentration after the introduction of the measures was larger at a traffic monitoring site (13.0 %, 19.6 % in summer, and 6.8 % in winter) and smaller in urban background (4.5 %, 5.7 % in summer, and 3.2 % in winter). The effect was most pronounced on Fridays and on the weekends in summer.

Germany lacks surveillance data and is home to a large Latin American immigrant population. Recognising that Bolivia is the country with the highest CD prevalence in Latin America, this cross-sectional, descriptive pilot study investigated CD and associated factors among citizens of Bolivian origin living in Munich, Germany. Methods Participants completed a questionnaire in order to collect socioeconomic and health-related data. In addition, serology was performed. In case of positive serological tests, PCR diagnostic and clinical staging together with disease management was initiated. Qualitative research was conducted to identify personal and community barriers as well as strategies to increase CD awareness among the population at risk. Results Between June 2013 and June 2014, 43 people from Bolivia (or descendants) were enrolled. A total of 9.3% (4/43), of whom two women were of childbearing age, tested seropositive (ELISA and IFAT), and one also by PCR. For 2/4 positive participants, clinical evaluation was performed and the indeterminate form of CD was diagnosed. Knowledge about CD symptoms and ways of transmission were completely absent among 55.8% (24/43, 2/4 with CD) and 30.2% (13/43, 1/4 with CD) of participants, respectively. A total of 27.9% (12/43, 0/4 with CD) of participants had donated blood prior to the study, whereas 62.8% (27/43, 3/4 with CD) were motivated to donate blood in the future. The qualitative research identified lack of knowledge as well as stigma and fears related to CD. Conclusions Despite the small number of participants, the prevalence of CD as well as the potential risk of non-vectorial transmission was alarming. Campaigns adapted for Latin American migrants as well as control strategies should be developed and put in place in order to prevent non-vectorial transmission and actively detect cases of CD in Germany.

Its financial existence between the world wars was assured by generous donations from the Jewish American scholar and philanthropist James Loeb. The scientific work done by Walther Spielmeyer (neuropathology), Felix Plaut (serology), Kurt Schneider (clinical psychiatry) and Ernst Rudin (psychiatric genetics) earned the DFA a reputation as an international center for psychiatry and neurology. During the 'Third Reich' Ernst Rudin cooperated with the National Socialist health system. His genetic concepts provided support for eugenic programmes such as forced sterilization of individuals with psychoses. These complex interactions underscore the importance of the DFA in understanding the recent history of medicine in Germany.\n\nDefense.gov Special Report: Travels With Hagel\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nGermany January 2014 News Stories Hagel: Future Requires Renewed Era of Partnership In a changing security 50th Munich Security Conference in Germany today, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel met with leaders from Germany, the United Kingdom, Israel, Georgia and India to discuss military relationships and common\n\nPhysicists and Physics in Munich\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTeichmann, JÃ¼rgen; Eckert, Michael; Wolff, Stefan\n\nWe give a tour of Munich and some outlying sites that focuses on the lives and work of the most prominent physicists who lived in the city, Count Rumford, Joseph Fraunhofer, Georg Simon Ohm, Max Planck, Ludwig Boltzmann, Albert Einstein, Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen, Wilhelm Wien, Arnold Sommerfeld, Max von Laue, and Werner Heisenberg.

The prediction of potential fluid pathways in urban Munich has been started with the interpretation of a 3-D seismic survey (170 km2) that was acquired during the winter of 2015/2016 in Munich (Germany) within the Bavarian Molasse Basin. As a part of the research project GeoParaMoL*, we focus on the structural interpretation and retro-deformation analysis to detect sub-seismic structures within the reservoir and overburden. We explore the hydrothermal Malm carbonate reservoir (at a depth of 3 km) as a source of deep geothermal energy and the overburden of Tertiary Molasse sediments. The stratigraphic horizons, Top Aquitan, Top Chatt, Top Bausteinschichten, Top Lithothamnien limestone (Top Eocene), Top and Base Malm (Upper Jurassic), together with the detailed interpretation of the faults in the study area are used to construct a 3-D geological model. The study area is characterised by synthetic normal faults that strike parallel to the alpine front. Most major faults were active from Upper Jurassic up to the Miocene. The Munich Fault, which belongs to the Markt-Schwabener Lineament, has a maximum vertical offset of 350 metres in the central part, and contrary to previous interpretation based on 2-D seismic, this fault dies out in the eastern part of the area. The south-eastern part of the study area is dominated by a very complex fault system. Three faults that were previously detected in a smaller 3-D seismic survey at Unterhaching, to the south of the study area, with strike directions of 25Â°, 45Â° and 70Â° (LÃ¼schen et al. 2014), were followed in to the new 3-D seismic survey interpretation. Particularly noticeable are relay ramps and horst/graben structures. The fault with a strike of 25Â° ends in three big sinkholes with a maximum vertical offset of 60 metres. We interpret this special structure as fault tip horsetail-structure, which caused a large amount of sub-seismic deformation. Consequently, this\n\nPREFACE: International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP 2012)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nErnst, Michael; DÃ¼llmann, Dirk; Rind, Ofer; Wong, Tony\n\n2012-12-01\n\nCollaborative Tools.

The institute was founded in 1973 as a non-profit non-governmental organization (NGO) with a focus on applied research. Starting with behaviour therapy-based development and evaluation of programmes for alcohol, illicit drugs and smoking and the evaluation of treatment services, the institute gradually expanded its topics, covering prevention (1985) and epidemiology and policy evaluation (1990), and participated throughout this period in the development of guidelines and screening, diagnostic and clinical instruments. Later, the IFT tried to bridge the gap between basic sciences, applied research, health-care services and health policy, with a network of national and international contacts, including its own university engagements and collaborations with foreign research groups and national and European Union (EU) agencies. Possible creativity-promoting factors on the institutional and individual levels are discussed, e.g. the collaboration of experienced senior researchers with carefully selected innovative doctoral students, considerable in-house and external training of young researchers and the early participation and presentation of their work at international conferences, independence from stakeholders in the field and the refusal of project funds which require external clearance of publications.

Immediately after his studies at KÃ¶nigsberg Isserlin in 1903 came to Kraepelin at Heidelberg, later he followed him to Munich. All his life he kept a Kantian orientation and defended Kraepelin's positions out of this background. Kraepelin entrusted to him all of psychotherapy, theory and practice, which Isserlin for at least 18 years gave courses of in Kraepelin's department. His textbook of psychotherapy thus transmissions Kraepelins convictions about this topic also. During World War I Isserlin was the head of a field-hospital for brain damaged soldiers and continued working this way after the end of the war. Finally he became the founder of child psychiatry in Munich, until he was forced to leave Germany for Britain with a heavy heart.\n\nThe Munich accelerator for fission fragments MAFF\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHabs, D.; GroÃ, M.; Assmann, W.; Ames, F.; Bongers, H.; Emhofer, S.; Heinz, S.; Henry, S.; Kester, O.; Neumayr, J.; Ospald, F.; Reiter, P.; Sieber, T.; Szerypo, J.; Thirolf, P.

It will deliver several intense beams (Ë3Ã10 11 s -1) of very neutron-rich fission fragments with a final energy of 30 keV (low-energy beam) or energies between 3.7 and 5.9 MeVÂ· A (high-energy beam). Such beams are of interest for the creation of super-heavy elements by fusion reactions, nuclear spectroscopy of exotic nuclei, but they also have a potential for applications, e.g. in medicine. Presently the Munich research reactor FRM-II is ready for operation, but authorities delay the final permission to turn the reactor critical probably till the end of 2002. Only after this final permission the financing of the major parts of MAFF can start. On the other hand all major components have been designed and special components have been tested in separate setups.\n\nCologne Consensus Conference: providers in accredited CME/CPD 11â12 September 2015, Cologne, Germany\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSimper, Julie\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOn 11â12 September 2015, the fourth annual Cologne Consensus Conference (CCC) was held in Cologne, Germany. The 2-day educational event was organised by the European Cardiology Section Foundation (ECSF) and the European Board for Accreditation in Cardiology (EBAC), a specialty continuing medical educationâcontinuing professional development (CMEâCPD) accreditation board of the European Union of Medical Specialists (UEMS). The conference was again planned in cooperation with an impressive group of international organisations and faculty members representing leading European and North American institutions. Each year, the CCC is organised around a specific topic area. For the conference's fourth iteration, the providers in accredited CME/CPD were the focus. The CCC 2015 set out to share ideas, discuss concepts, and increase collaborations amongst the various groups.

In both the case of Dr Maurice Hutzler, who committed suicide after conflicts with senior colleagues at the Gisela Childrenâs Hospital and a sentence of the court of honour of the Munich Medical District Society, and the Berlin âpatient tradeâ affair, in which the medical professors Ernst von Leyden, Hermann Senator, Karl Anton Ewald and Carl Posner were accused of having made payments to middlemen for bringing them lucrative private patients, notions of personal and professional honour played a central role. The Munich case highlighted shortcomings of the Bavarian medical court of honour system, which was less developed than its Prussian counterpart. The analysis of the two cases suggests that the ethics of medical practice in early twentieth-century Germany should be viewed as part of a culture of honour.

The BMW Tower was envisioned to resemble a four-cylinder motor and become a symbol for the recent flourishing success of BMW. Throughout its four decades, the BMW Tower has become the main architectural feature of modern Munich and a pride for one of the World leading car manufacturers. The structural design of the BMW Tower represented a major challenge to Germany's finest engineers because the suspended 99.5m-high structure had to whitstand not only static loading but large wind dynamic loading while having deflections within appropriate serviceability limits. Strand7 has been used to determine the stresses and deflections the structure is subjected to in order to analyse its behavior under static and dynamic loadings.

The first results are presented here. How the first contacts came about remains unclear but a few of his articles were published in German from 1955 and in the 70's he held occasional seminars in Munich. His contacts with colleagues from the DPV at the end of the 70's and the beginning of the 80's (until his death in 1986) seem however to have been the most influential, especially through a supervision group he led. Rosenfeld transmitted a particularly experience-near approach to the patient, which also acknowledged and took seriously (self) destructive elements in the transference and countertransference. In the following years and decades a number of colleagues wished to deepen this approach. How this line was further developed is illustrated in outlining G. Appy's clinical description of intrusive speechlessness. Rosenfeld's ideas on the pernicious effect of idealizing destructive elements are especially stressed as they contributed to thinking about the entanglements with Nazi Germany, and in addition are still useful in analytical practice, out of which they developed.\n\n76 FR 58005 - Change in Bank Control Notices; Acquisitions of Shares of a Bank or Bank Holding Company\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-09-19\n\n...

Data were taken from the Municipal Munich Subway System case registry (southern Germany) for all suicidal incidents on the track: purposely inflicted; date, time and location of incident, sex of victim, outcome. The analysis covered a 20 year observation period between 1980 and 1999, for which the Munich Municipal Office for Statistics also provided data of all deaths due to suicides within the city area of Munich. Suicide mortality was classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision (codes E950-E959). A total of 306 incidents were documented with an annual mean of 16.5 cases. Case fatality was 66% (n=202). It was highest in winter and in higher aged groups. No significant time trend for incidences was observed. Median age of suicide attempters was 38 years. Most incidences (24.2%) were recorded for persons aged 20-29 years. The male: female ratio was 1.15 : 1. The peak time of day for incidences in women was during the late morning hours while significantly more men committed subway suicides during evening hours (p=0.001). No consistent seasonal variation was observed. In comparison to average suicide attempters, subjects committing subway suicides are markedly younger and they follow to a lesser extent established seasonal or circadian time patterns. More women are involved in subway suicides than would be expected. However, similarities to reports on behavioural patterns of subway suicides in other communities are striking.\n\nMunich anatomy and the distribution of bodies from the Stadelheim execution site during National Socialism.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchÃ¼tz, Mathias; Waschke, Jens; Marckmann, Georg; Steger, Florian\n\n2017-05-01\n\nDuring the reign of National Socialism (NS) anatomical institutes regularly received bodies of executed prisoners in steadily increasing numbers. After 1939, the execution site at Stadelheim prison in Munich supplied not only Munich anatomy but also the institutes in Erlangen, Innsbruck and WÃ¼rzburg. Due to the disappearance of the Munich body journals, the exact dimension and procedure of body procurement from Stadelheim remained unknown for 70 years. After consultation of a wide range of sources, including rediscovered fragments of the body journals, it is now possible to give an almost comprehensive account of the developments. This article deals with the attempts at recovering information on body procurement from Stadelheim prison during the NS period, which already indicated the significance of Munich anatomy in organizing the distribution of bodies. Thereafter, it addresses the number and distinct groups of Stadelheim prisoners, executed and delivered to the four anatomical institutes, the differences in the handling of their bodies, and the extent to which in particular Munich anatomy profited from the massive increase in executions. Finally, it unveils the role of the Munich Anatomical Institute in distributing those bodies among the anatomies during the Second World War, making it not only the main beneficiary but also the interim center of this process.

Large stockpiles still exist to the present day. SM is believed to be a major threat to civilian populations because of the persistent asymmetric threat by non-state actors, such as terrorist groups, its easy synthesis and handling and the risk of theft from stockpiles. Following an asymptomatic interval of several hours, acute SM exposure produces subepidermal skin blisters, respiratory tract damage, eye lesions and bone marrow depression. Iranian victims of SM exposure during the Iran-Iraq (1984-1988) war were treated at intensive care units of 3 Munich hospitals. All 12 patients were injured following aerial attacks with SM filled bombs, which exploded in a distance between 5 and 30m. All patients soon noted an offensive smell of garlic, addle eggs or oil roasted vegetables. No individual protective equipment was used. Eye itching and skin blistering started 2h after SM exposure. Some patients complained of nausea, dizziness and hoarseness. 4h after exposure, most patients started vomiting. Eye symptoms worsened and most patients suffered from temporary blindness due to blepharospasm and lid oedema. Additionally, pulmonary symptoms such as productive cough occurred. Patients were transferred to Munich 4-17 days after SM exposure. On admission all patients showed significant skin blistering and pigmentation. Conjunctivitis and photophobia were the major eye symptoms. Pulmonary symptoms, including productive cough were persistent. Bronchoscopy revealed massive inflammation of the trachea with signs of necrosis. 3 patients needed tracheotomy. Chest X-ray did not yield abnormal observations. This presentation summarizes the experience of treating SM victims in Munich and discusses therapeutic implications.\n\nThe Munich Anatomical Institute under National Socialism. First results and prospective tasks of an ongoing research project.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchÃ¼tz, Mathias; Waschke, Jens; Marckmann, Georg; Steger, Florian\n\n2013-07-01\n\nWhile research into the history of German anatomy under National Socialist rule has increased during the last decade, the story of one of the most important anatomical institutes of the time, the Anatomische Anstalt Munich, has not yet been explored. This study presents the results of an ongoing, cooperative research project at the universities of Halle and Munich and focuses on the history of the institution, its personnel and organization, and its interactions with the National Socialist regime. It reveals continuity and disruption within the institute following Munich anatomists' involvement with the regime's policies and ideology as well as their becoming victims to these policies. Also documented is the manner in which the Munich anatomy benefited from the massive increase in executions, especially during the Second World War, by receiving and using the bodies of prisoners executed at the Stadelheim prison in Munich for scientific purposes. Finally, an outlook is presented regarding planned research aiming to fully understand the history of the Anatomische Anstalt during National Socialism. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Under the direction of Bumke the psychiatric clinic also laid claim to the representation of neurology starting in 1924. However, the military departments for nerve- and brain-injured soldiers, which were founded during WWI, developed into non-academic neurological treatment centres in Munich with donations from the German-American philanthropist Heckscher and the initiative of war invalids organisations. In 1925 the Heckscher Nerven-Heil- und Forschungsanstalt was established as the first neurological hospital in Munich. The main characters involved in this development were the neurologist Eugen von MalaisÃ© and the psychiatrist Max Isserlin. With the early death of von MalaisÃ© in 1923 neurology in Munich lost an important advocate of its institutional independence. The dismissal, prosecution and expulsion of the Jewish chief physician Isserlin was the second heavy blow to the efforts towards autonomy of neurology in Munich.\n\nPartner, workplace, and stranger abuse during pregnancy in Germany.\n\nPubMed\n\nStÃ¶ckl, Heidi; Hertlein, Linda; Friese, Klaus; StÃ¶ckl, Doris\n\n2010-11-01\n\nTo investigate the prevalence, perpetrators, sociodemographic correlates, and health impacts of psychological, physical, and sexual abuse during pregnancy among women attending a maternity ward in Germany. A written questionnaire was given to pregnant women in a maternity ward of a university hospital in Munich. Abuse during pregnancy was assessed using the Abuse Assessment Screen. Of 552 women, 401 completed the questionnaire for a response rate of 72.6%. The prevalence of psychological, physical, or sexual abuse during pregnancy by any perpetrator was 6.7% (n = 27); the main perpetrators were women's partners and work colleagues. After controlling for the effect of age, psychological, physical, or sexual abuse during pregnancy was significantly associated with a history of abuse, low education level of the woman and the father of her child, short relationship duration, unintended pregnancy, financial problems caused by the pregnancy, having more than 3 children, and insufficient social support. Women who reported abuse during pregnancy were significantly more likely to smoke and to have adverse maternal health outcomes. Psychological, physical, or sexual abuse during pregnancy was experienced by 1 in 15 women who attended a maternity ward in Munich and adversely affected maternal health outcomes.

This conference was the fourth event in a series of meetings, which started in Waterloo, Canada (HFM 2000), followed by the second one in Grenoble, France (HFM 2003), and the third meeting in Osaka, Japan (HFM 2006). HFM2008 attracted more than 220 participants from all over the world. The number of participants of the HFM conference series has been increasing steadily, from about 80 participants at HFM 2000, to 120 participants at HFM 2003, and 190 participants at HFM 2006, demonstrating that highly frustrated magnetism remains a rapidly growing area of research in condensed matter physics. At the end of HFM2008 it was decided that the next International Conference on Highly Frustrated Magnetism will be held in Baltimore, USA in 2010. HFM2008 saw four plenary talks by R Moessner, S Nakatsuji, S-W Cheong, and S Sachdev, 18 invited presentations, 30 contributed talks and about 160 poster presentations from all areas of frustrated magnetism. The subjects covered by the conference included: Kagome systems Itinerant frustrated systems Spinels and pyrochlore materials Triangular systems Unconventional order and spin liquids Chain systems Chain systems Novel frustrated systems This volume of Journal of Physics: Conference Series contains the proceedings of HFM2008 with 83 papers that provide a scientific record of the scientific topics covered by the conference. All articles have been refereed by experts in the field. It is our hope that the reader will enjoy and profit from the HFM2008 Proceedings.

The struggle of Munich anatomist Titus von Lanz during National Socialism.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchÃ¼tz, Mathias; Waschke, Jens; Marckmann, Georg; Steger, Florian\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe article analyzes the life and career of the anatomist Titus von Lanz (1897-1967) of Munich focusing on the period of National Socialism (NS). Von Lanz lost his position as an associate professor at the Anatomical Institute of Munich University because of his marriage to a \"half-Jewish\" woman in 1938. In contrast to most of his colleagues affected by National Socialist measures, von Lanz had opportunities to save his career and made extensive use of them. His story is that of a complicated struggle for the continuation of his work, involving a wide range of supporters from prestigious physicians to high-ranking National Socialist officials as well as the alienation of his colleagues at the Munich department of anatomy. The article tries to clarify these developments through the presentation of his social background, his supporters, his enemies, the research he conducted during NS and von Lanz' own remembrance of these developments from the post-war period. It aims at laying out a critical appreciation of his motives and actions, thereby contributing to the understanding of individual behavior of anatomists under NS. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Although founded for a broader range of theoretical physics, the quantum became the major topic of research in Munich after the Bohr-Sommerfeld-model of the atom (1913-16). The heyday came in the 1920s, when Bohr's and Born's institutes started operation and became further attractive centers for ambitious theorists all over the world. The discovery of quantum mechanics (1925) should be regarded not only as the achievement of a few young geniuses (in particular Werner Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli) but also as the result of a collaborative effort emerging in the new social and intellectual environment of their teachers' schools in Munich, GÃ¶ttingen and Copenhagen.\n\nThe Medical Meaning of Reeducation for Germany: Contemporary Interpretation of Cultural and Institutional Change.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGerhardt, Uta\n\n1997-01-01\n\nExamines the approaches taken, the topics discussed, and the practical results of the 1944 conference, \"Germany after the War.\" Organized and led by psychiatrist Richard Brickner, the conference focused on reeducation, institutional change, and psychological rehabilitation.

Due to the concurrence on the local \"medical market\" none of the five Jewish doctors named in the documents could practice for a longer period in teh late medieval city. Unlike their co-religionists in several cities of Westphalia, where physicians and surgeons were lacking, no Jewish medical practitioner was ever employed by the Magistrate of Munich. Thus, all of them seemed to have hoped for an employment at the court of the Bavarian Dukes. But with the exception of Jacob of Landshut, physician to the Bavarian Dukes Steven III. and Albrecht III. during the second half of the 14th century, whose medical career and social environment can roughly be retraced, no Jewish doctor seems to have been in service of the court for a longer time.\n\nA Cryogenic Detector Characterization Facility in the Shallow Underground Laboratory at the Technical University of Munich\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLangenkÃ¤mper, A.; Defay, X.; Ferreiro Iachellini, N.; Kinast, A.; Lanfranchi, J.-C.; Lindner, E.; Mancuso, M.; MondragÃ³n, E.; MÃ¼nster, A.; Ortmann, T.; Potzel, W.; SchÃ¶nert, S.; Strauss, R.; Ulrich, A.; Wawoczny, S.; Willers, M.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe Physics Department of the Technical University of Munich operates a shallow underground detector laboratory in Garching, Germany. It provides Ë 160 {m^2} of laboratory space which is shielded from cosmic radiation by Ë 6 m of gravel and soil, corresponding to a shielding of Ë 15 {m.w.e.} . The laboratory also houses a cleanroom equipped with work- and wetbenches, a chemical fumehood as well as a spin-coater and a mask-aligner for photolithographic processing of semiconductor detectors. Furthermore, the shallow underground laboratory runs two high-purity germanium detector screening stations, a liquid argon cryostat and a ^3 He-^4 He dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of â¤ 12-14 mK . The infrastructure provided by the shallow laboratory is particularly relevant for the characterization of CaWO_4 target crystals for the CRESST-III experiment, detector fabrication and assembly for rare event searches. Future applications of the laboratory include detector development in the framework of coherent neutrino nucleus scattering experiments (Î½ -cleus) and studying its potential as a site to search for MeV-scale dark matter with gram-scale cryogenic detectors.\n\n[Anatomical Vitamin C-Research during National Socialism and the Post-war Period: Max Clara's Human Experiments at the Munich Anatomical Institute].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchÃ»tz, Mathias; Schochow, Maximilian; Waschke, Jens; Marckmann, Georg; Steger, Florian\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn autumn of 1942, Max Clara (1899-1966) became chairman of the anatomical institute Munich. There, he intensified his research concerning the proof of vitamin C with the bodies of executed prisoners which were delivered by the Munich-Stadelheim prison. This research on human organs was pursued by applying ascorbic acid (Cebion) to prisoners before their execution. The paper investigates this intensified and radicalized anatomical research through human experiments, which Max Clara conducted in Munich and published from Istanbul during the postwar years, as well as its scientific references from the Nazi period.\n\nRecollections of life as a student and a young astronomer in Germany in the 1920s\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrÃ¼ck, Hermann A.; BrÃ¼ck, Mary T.\n\n2000-12-01\n\nThe author of this essay, Hermann Alexander BrÃ¼ck, Emeritus Professor of Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh and former Astronomer Royal for Scotland, died on 4 March 2000 in his 95th year. He was the last of his generation of astronomers in both Germany and Britain, and among the oldest members, if not the oldest, of the Royal Astronomical Society and of the Astronomische Gesellschaft. Hermann BrÃ¼ck was born in Berlin in 1905 and, as he recounts below, received his education at the Universities of Kiel, Bonn and Munich in 1924-1928. To the end of his life he looked back on his student days in Munich as the most profitable and exciting he ever experienced. From Munich he began his astronomical career at the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory. These, too, were happy days, destined, however, to be blighted within a few years by the rise of Nazism. In 1936 BrÃ¼ck left Germany, and obtained a temporary Research Assistantship at the Vatican Observatory. From there he went a year later to Cambridge, rising to the rank of John Couch Adams Astronomer and Assistant Director of the Observatory. In 1947, in response to an invitation from Eamon de Valera, then Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland, he moved to Dublin where he undertook the task of re-founding the defunct Dunsink Observatory under the auspices of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. He moved from Dublin to the Royal Observatory Edinburgh in 1957, taking up the combined post of Astronomer Royal for Scotland and Regius Professor of Astronomy in the University of Edinburgh. He retired in 1975 at the age of 70. Always interested in history, he occupied himself in his retirement with various historical projects. These included writing the histories of the Royal Observatory Edinburgh (The Story of Astronomy in Edinburgh, Edinburgh 1983) and of the earlier Dun Echt Observatory in Aberdeenshire (Lord Crawford's Observatory at Dun Echt 1872-1892, Vistas in Astronomy 35, 1992) as well as a record of his own\n\nPrices of over-the-counter drugs used by 15-year-old adolescents in Germany and their association with socioeconomic background.\n\nPubMed\n\nItalia, Salvatore; Wolfenstetter, Silke B; BrÃ¼ske, Irene; Heinrich, Joachim; Berdel, Dietrich; von Berg, Andrea; Lehmann, Irina; Standl, Marie; Teuner, Christina M\n\n2017-11-25\n\nIn Germany, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are normally reimbursed up to the age of 12Â years only. The aim of this study was to analyse prices of over-the-counter drugs used by adolescents in Germany and their association with socioeconomic factors. Based on the German GINIplus and LISAplus birth cohorts, data on drug utilization among 15-year-old adolescents (nâ=â4677) were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The reported drugs were subdivided into prescription drugs and OTC drugs. The drugs' prices were tracked by the pharmaceutical identification numbers. Overall, 1499 OTC drugs with clearly identifiable prices were eligible for analysis. Their mean price was â¬9.75 (95% confidence interval: â¬9.27-10.22). About 75% of the OTC drugs cost less than â¬10. Higher mean prices were associated with residing in Munich (â¬10.74; 95% confidence interval: â¬9.97-11.52) and with higher paternal education (e.g. highest education level: â¬10.17; 95% confidence interval: â¬9.47-10.86). Adolescents residing in Munich (in comparison with the less wealthy region of Wesel) and adolescents with higher educated fathers were also significantly more likely to use OTC drugs costing â¥ â¬10 or â¥ â¬25, respectively. The price of â¬10 for non-reimbursable OTC drugs may represent a (psychological) threshold. Higher prices could discourage especially adolescents from a lower socioeconomic background from taking medically advisable but non-reimbursable OTC drugs.\n\nA Universal Model of Giftedness--An Adaptation of the Munich Model\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJessurun, J.

R.; Bayerstadler, A.; Heumann, C.; Nowak, D.; JÃ¶rres, R. A.; Fischer, R.\n\n2014-03-01\n\nThis study determined the influence of various meteorological variables and air pollutants on airway disorders in general, and asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in particular, in Munich, Bavaria, during 2006 and 2007. This was achieved through an evaluation of the daily frequency of calls to medical and emergency call centres, ambulatory medical care visits at general practitioners, and prescriptions of antibiotics for respiratory diseases. Meteorological parameters were extracted from data supplied by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast. Data on air pollutant levels were extracted from the air quality database of the European Environmental Agency for different measurement sites. In addition to descriptive analyses, a backward elimination procedure was performed to identify variables associated with medical outcome variables. Afterwards, generalised additive models (GAM) were used to verify whether the selected variables had a linear or nonlinear impact on the medical outcomes. The analyses demonstrated associations between environmental parameters and daily frequencies of different medical outcomes, such as visits at GPs and air pressure (-27 % per 10 hPa change) or ozone (-24 % per 10 Î¼g/m3 change). The results of the GAM indicated that the effects of some covariates, such as carbon monoxide on consultations at GPs, or humidity on medical calls in general, were nonlinear, while the type of association varied between medical outcomes. These data suggest that the multiple, complex effect of environmental factors on medical outcomes should not be assumed homogeneous or linear a priori and that different settings might be associated with different types of associations.\n\nProceedings of the International Association for Development of the Information Society (IADIS) International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age (CELDA) (13th, Mannheim, Germany, October 28-30, 2016)\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nSampson, Demetrios G., Ed.; Spector, J.

Often it is not possible to obtain sufficient practical training in a clinical environment. The training can be improved by Virtual Reality technology. In the frame of the Munich Knee Joint Simulation project an artificial leg with anatomical properties is attached by a force-torque sensor to an industrial robot. The recorded forces and torques are the input for a simple biomechanical model of the human knee joint. The robot is controlled in such way that the user gets the feeling he moves a real leg. The leg is embedded in a realistic environment with a couch and a patient on it.\n\nPREFACE: Rutherford Centennial Conference on Nuclear Physics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFreeman, Sean\n\n2012-09-01\n\nDobacewski (Warsaw, Poland) G Dracoulis (ANU, Australia) S J Freedman (LBL, USA) M Hass (Weizmann Institute, Israel) M Huyse (Leuven, Belgium) P Jones (Birmingham, UK) D Khao (Hanoi, Vietnam) R KrÃ¼cken (Munich, Germany) K Langanke (Darmstadt, Germany) C Lister (Argonne, USA) G A Miller (University of Washington, USA) D Morrissey (MSU, USA) T Motobayashi (RIKEN, Japan) S Nagamiya (J-PARC, Japan) W Nazarewicz (ORNL, USA) S Mullins (iThemba, South Africa) T Nakamura (Tokyo, Japan) P Roussel Chomaz (GANIL, France) R Ribas (Sao Paolo, Brazil) M Vanderhaeghen (Mainz, Germany) U Wiedner (Uppsala, Sweden) F Xu (Peking University, China) Q Zhao (IHEP, Bejing) W Zajc (Columbia, USA)\n\nSupport for U.S. Participants at the 15th International Congress on Catalysis\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWachs, Israel E.\n\n2013-08-05\n\nThe grant was used to partially assist the travel expenses of U.S. academic scientists to attend the 15th International Congress on Catalysis. The conference was held in Munich, Germany from July 1-6, 2012. The importance of the International Congress was to bring together the international community of faculty members who participate in catalysis research, and to share information that would lead to further developments and directions in the field of study. Graduate students and Post Docs were invited to apply for travel assistance based on criteria established by the North American Catalysis Society (NACS) and the local Catalysis Clubs.\n\nInvestigations and results concerning railway-induced ground-borne vibrations in Germany\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDegen, K. G.; Behr, W.; GrÃ¼tz, H.-P.\n\n2006-06-01\n\nBesides noise reduction, ground-borne vibrations induced by railways are another important environmental issue associated with the construction of new or the reconstruction of existing railway lines that had to be tackled during the last decade. Annoyance can occur, particularly for lines in urban areas at small distances to neighbouring houses or lines in shallow depth tunnels under buildings. The ground-borne vibrations can be perceived by the inhabitants via the floor vibrations, as well as via the air-borne noise radiated inside the building by the vibrating building structures (secondary noise). At present, legal specifications for judging railway-induced ground-borne vibrations do not exist in Germany. In order to review common practices, an experimental psycho-physical laboratory study was performed. To estimate the annoyance of railway-induced vibrations, the mean vibration energy of a train pass-by seems much more significant and related to the annoyance than the commonly used RMS value according to the German standard DIN 4150-2. The minimum difference in vibration that can be felt by people was found at a signal difference of 25%. This paper will review results of a project performed in cooperation with the engineering office Obermeyer in Munich and the Technical University of Munich [A. Said, D. Fleischer, H. Kilcher, H.

In recent years researchers recognized the usefulness of keyword network analysis for visualizing and analyzing scientific research topics. Therefore, we applied keyword network analysis to present an overview of current epidemiologic research topics in Germany. Accepted submissions to the 9th annual congress of the German Society for Epidemiology (DGEpi) in 2014 were used as data source. Submitters had to choose one of 19 subject areas, and were ask to provide a title, structured abstract, names of authors along with their affiliations, and a list of freely selectable keywords. Keywords had been provided for 262 (82Â %) submissions, 1030 keywords in total. Overall the most common keywords were: \"migration\" (18 times), \"prevention\" (15 times), followed by \"children\", \"cohort study\", \"physical activity\", and \"secondary data analysis\" (11 times each). Some keywords showed a certain concentration under one specific subject area, e.g. \"migration\" with 8 of 18 in social epidemiology or \"breast cancer\" with 4 of 7 in cancer epidemiology. While others like \"physical activity\" were equally distributed over multiple subject areas (cardiovascular & metabolic diseases, ageing, methods, paediatrics, prevention & health service research). This keyword network analysis demonstrated the high diversity of epidemiologic research topics with a large number of distinct keywords as presented at the annual conference of the DGEpi.\n\nIFLA General Conference, 1985.

Four years after the modification of the infection protection act became law, the Munich public health department aimed to evaluate the state of implementation of antibiotic consumption surveillance in Munich hospitals and to ascertain which antibiotic stewardship (ABS) structures have already been established. AÂ questionnaire was sent to Munich hospitals about their antibiotic management structural data and state of implementation of legal requirements. Only 32â% of the hospitals have qualified ABS-experts available. In 76â% of the hospitals persons responsible for antibiotic consumption surveillance are appointed, while in 12â% persons responsible for antibiotic consumption surveillance are at least partly released from their normal work for this activity. Twenty-one hospitals (21â%) conduct antibiotic consumption surveillance taking into account all antiinfective agents mentioned in the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) guidelines. Of these, 19 (76â%) did this on basis of World Health Organizations ATC/DDD-system (anatomical therapeutic chemical [ATC] classification system which uses defined daily doses [DDD]). The data on antibiotic consumption is evaluated in 72â% of the hospitals, 68â% take account of the local resistance situation. In 96â%, in-house lists of antiinfectives are available; in 80â%, in-house guidelines for antibiotic treatment are available. Fourty-four percent of the hospitals take part in aÂ national surveillance. For the first time data were collected on implementation of antibiotic consumption surveillance in hospitals, which has been required by law since 2011. An incomplete implementation of legal requirements was demonstrated. It was found that structural and personnel prerequisites are often missing, that\n\nToxicity and elemental composition of particulate matter from outdoor and indoor air of elementary schools in Munich, Germany.\n\nPubMed\n\nOeder, S; Dietrich, S; Weichenmeier, I; Schober, W; Pusch, G; JÃ¶rres, R A; Schierl, R; Nowak, D; Fromme, H; Behrendt, H; Buters, J T M\n\n2012-04-01\n\nOutdoor particulate matter (PM(10)) is associated with detrimental health effects. However, individual PM(10) exposure occurs mostly indoors. We therefore compared the toxic effects of classroom, outdoor, and residential PM(10). Indoor and outdoor PM(10) was collected from six schools in Munich during teaching hours and in six homes. Particles were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Toxicity was evaluated in human primary keratinocytes, lung epithelial cells and after metabolic activation by several human cytochromes P450. We found that PM(10) concentrations during teaching hours were 5.6-times higher than outdoors (117 Â± 48 Î¼g/m(3) vs. 21 Â± 15 Î¼g/m(3), P < 0.001). Compared to outdoors, indoor PM contained more silicate (36% of particle number), organic (29%, probably originating from human skin), and Ca-carbonate particles (12%, probably originating from paper). Outdoor PM contained more Ca-sulfate particles (38%). Indoor PM at 6 Î¼g/cm(2) (10 Î¼g/ml) caused toxicity in keratinocytes and in cells expressing CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Toxicity by CYP2B6 was abolished with the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetylcysteine. We concluded that outdoor PM(10) and indoor PM(10) from homes were devoid of toxicity. Indoor PM(10) was elevated, chemically different and toxicologically more active than outdoor PM(10). Whether the effects translate into a significant health risk needs to be determined. Until then, we suggest better ventilation as a sensible option. Indoor air PM(10) on an equal weight base is toxicologically more active than outdoor PM(10). In addition, indoor PM(10) concentrations are about six times higher than outdoor air. Thus, ventilation of classrooms with outdoor air will improve air quality and is likely to provide a health benefit. It is also easier than cleaning PM(10) from indoor air, which has proven to be tedious.

The aim of this study was to describe trends in mortality attributable to the principal causes of death: AIDS, drug overdose, suicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents, among adults aged between 15Â and 34Â years in three European cities (Barcelona, Bologna and Munich), over the period 1986Â to 1995.â¨METHODSâThe population studied consisted of all deaths that occurred between 1986Â and 1995Â among residents of Barcelona, Bologna and Munich aged from 15Â to 34Â years. Information about deaths was obtained from mortality registers. The study variables were sex, age, the underlying cause of death and year of death. Causes of death studied were: drug overdose, AIDS, suicide and motor vehicle traffic accidents. Age standardised mortality rates (direct adjustment) were obtained in all three cities for the age range 15-34. To investigate trends in mortality over the study period Poisson regression models were fitted, obtaining the average relative risk (RR) associated with a one year increment.â¨RESULTSâYoung adult mortality increased among men in Barcelona and Bologna (RR per year: 1.04,Â 95% confidence intervals (95%CI): 1.03,Â 1.06Â in Barcelona and RR:1.03, 95%CI:1.01, 1.06Â in Bologna) and among women in Barcelona (RR:1.02, 95%CI: 1.01,Â 1.04), with a change in the pattern of the main causes of death attributable to the increase in AIDS and drug overdose mortality. In Munich, the pattern did not change as much, suicides being the main cause of death during the 10Â years studied, although they have been decreasing since 1988Â (RR:0.92, 95%CI:0.88, 0.96Â for men and 0.81,Â 95%CI: 0.75-0.87 for women).â¨CONCLUSIONâThe increase in AIDS mortality observed in the three European cities in the mid-80s and mid-90s has yielded to substantial changes in the pattern of the main causes of death at young ages in Barcelona and Bologna.

The conference was organized by Riga Technical University (Latvia) and Kaunas University of Technology (Lithuania). The series of Baltic conferences on silicate materials was started since 2004: the first conference was held in Riga, Latvia, 2004; the second conference was held in Kaunas, Lithuania 2005; the third was held again in Riga, Latvia, 2007, and the fourth was held in Kaunas, Lithuania 2009. BaltSilica 2011 was attended by around 50 participants from Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Germany, Poland, Italy, France, Ukraine and Russia. In comparison with previous silicate materials conferences, the broadening of participating countries is an indication of the interest of scientists, engineers and students to exchange research ideas, latest results, and to find new research topics for cooperation in the fields of silicate, high temperature materials, and inorganic nanomaterials. The scientific programme included 8 invited plenary lectures 23 oral presentations and 25 posters [1]. Scientific themes covered in the conference and in this special issue: Natural and Artificial Stone Materials; Traditional and New Ceramic and Glass-Like Materials; Nanoparticles and Nanomaterials. This volume consists of 23 selected proceeding papers. The Editor of this special issue is grateful to all the contributors to BaltSilica 2011. I am also very grateful to the scientific committee, the local organizing committee, the session chairs, the referees who refereed the submitted articles to this issue, and to students from the Department of Silicate, High Temperature and Inorganic Nanomaterials Technology of the Riga Technical University who ensured the smooth running of the conference. Particular thanks goes to eight plenary\n\nWomen in Physics in Germany, 2008\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKluge, Hanna\n\n2009-04-01\n\nThe status of women in physics in Germany has not changed dramatically in the three years since the last IUPAP Women in Physics Conference was held in 2005. The salary of a woman remains approximately 25% lower than that of a man in a comparable professional position. The number of female professors is growing slowly. The number of young women beginning to study physics is around 20%. There is, however, a noticeable increase in organization and societal acceptance of female physicists, and an increasing amount of men taking part in this process. There is also increased acceptance and support of dual-career couples. The Helmholtz Alliance for \"Physics at the Terascale\" founded a dual-career option program. In 2008, the annual Conference of German Female Physicists (DPT) held in Muenster became an official conference of the DPG (German Physical Society). Various scientific groups working for equal opportunity have formed a \"network of networks.\" At the DESY (German Electron Synchrotron), a group of women led by an equal opportunity officer is involved in the entire process of hiring new staff members in all positions, including directors.\n\nThe Company and Its Role in the Production of Qualifications: The Constitution and Development of Middle-Level Qualifications in Germany and France--A Comparison.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nCEDEFOP Flash, 1990\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThis paper summarizes a conference on the development of midlevel technical personnel in Germany and France.

The current article reports on the considerations of augmentation that were made during a European Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (EURLSSG)-sponsored Consensus Conference in April 2006 at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) in Munich, Germany, the conclusions of which were endorsed by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) and the World Association of Sleep Medicine (WASM). The Consensus Conference sought to develop a better understanding of augmentation and generate a better operational definition for its clinical identification. Current concepts of the pathophysiology, clinical features, and therapy of RLS augmentation were evaluated by subgroups who presented a summary of their findings for general consideration and discussion. Recent data indicating sensitivity and specificity of augmentation features for identification of augmentation were also evaluated. The diagnostic criteria of augmentation developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conference in 2002 were reviewed in light of current data and theoretical understanding of augmentation. The diagnostic value and criteria for each of the accepted features of augmentation were considered by the group. A consensus was then developed for a revised statement of the diagnostic criteria for augmentation. Five major diagnostic features of augmentation were identified: usual time of RLS symptom onset each day, number of body parts with RLS symptoms, latency to symptoms at rest, severity of the symptoms when they occur, and effects of dopaminergic medication on symptoms. The quantitative data available relating the time of RLS onset and the presence of other features indicated optimal augmentation criteria of either a 4-h advance in usual starting time for RLS symptoms or a combination of the occurrence of other features. A paradoxical response to changes in medication dose also indicates\n\nSolar technology in the Federal Republic of Germany\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1979-01-01\n\nA series of papers dealing with the status of solar research and development in the Federal Republic of Germany are presented at a conference in Greece with the object of promoting international cooperation in solar energy utilization.

It was organized jointly by the Institute for Computational Studies at Colorado State University, U.S.A., and the Gasellschaft fur Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung Bonn, F.R. Germany, and was sponsored by the Air Force Office of Sponsored Research and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Headquarters. The conference was attended by 80 scientists, divided by institution almost equally into private industry, research laboratories, and academia. Fifteen attendees came from countries other than the U.S.A. In addition to the fruitful discussions, the most significant factor of the conference was of course the lectures. The lecturers include most of the leaders in the field of multigrid research. The program offered a nice integrated blend of theory, numerical studies, basic research, and applications. Some of the new areas of research that have surfaced since the Koln-Porz conference include: the algebraic multigrid approach; multigrid treatment of Euler equations for inviscid fluid flow problems; 3-D problems; and the application of MG methods on vector and parallel computers.\n\nMulti-scale modeling of urban air pollution: development and application of a Street-in-Grid model (v1.0) by coupling MUNICH (v1.0) and Polair3D (v1.8.1)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Youngseob; Wu, You; Seigneur, Christian; Roustan, Yelva\n\n2018-02-01\n\nA new multi-scale model of urban air pollution is presented. This model combines a chemistry-transport model (CTM) that includes a comprehensive treatment of atmospheric chemistry and transport on spatial scales down to 1 km and a street-network model that describes the atmospheric concentrations of pollutants in an urban street network. The street-network model is the Model of Urban Network of Intersecting Canyons and Highways (MUNICH), which consists of two main components: a street-canyon component and a street-intersection component. MUNICH is coupled to the Polair3D CTM of the Polyphemus air quality modeling platform to constitute the Street-in-Grid (SinG) model. MUNICH is used to simulate the concentrations of the chemical species in the urban canopy, which is located in the l"
