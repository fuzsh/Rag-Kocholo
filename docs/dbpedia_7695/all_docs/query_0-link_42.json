Principle clinical features of MRKH syndrome are primary amenorrhoea associated with congenital absence of vagina, uterine anomalies, normal ovaries, 46 XX karyotype with normal female secondary sexual characteristics and frequent association with renal, skeletal, and other congenital anomalies. A case of a 3-year-old child with congenitally absent thumbs and big toes is reported herein; she was brought in with complaints of urinary incontinence. Radiological investigation (ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan) revealed absent uterus and vagina while both ovaries were normal. Intravenous urography (IVU) study showed bifid pelvicalyceal systems bilaterally. Karyotyping revealed a 46 XX female phenotype. Laparoscopy confirmed normal ovaries bilaterally and small unfused uterine buds lying beside both ovaries on each side of pelvis. Early diagnosis of MRKH syndrome is essential for timely planning of vaginal and (if possible) uterine reconstructive surgeries.\n\nRecurrent microdeletion at 17q12 as a cause of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome: two case reports\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nNovelli Antonio; Fedele Luigi; Divizia Maria; Barbano Giancarlo; Frontino Giada; Baban Anwar; Carella Massimo; Gervasini Cristina; Gimelli Stefania; Bernardini Laura; BÃ©na FrÃ©dÃ©rique; Lalatta Faustina; Miozzo Monica; Dallapiccola Bruno\n\n2009-01-01\n\nAbstract Background Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) consists of congenital aplasia of the uterus and the upper part of vagina due to anomalous development of MÃ¼llerian ducts, either isolated or associated with other congenital malformations, including renal, skeletal, hearing and heart defects.

An 18-year-old Saudi single, virgin female was accompanied by her mother seeking medical advice regarding absent menses. She had normal breasts, normal axillary and pubic hair, normal vulva, urethra and labial folds, however, the vagina was blind, approximately 2 cm length. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed normal appearing ovaries, a small uterus and small cervix and vagina. Investigations showed initial high serum prolactin of 1,517mIU/L. Cranial MRI was normal. The patient was diagnosed as mullerian hypoplasia class I American Fertility Society.

This is probably due to the fact that when those patients are diagnosed not much attention or information is given for long term psychiatric follow-up. Owing to their inability to bear children, these subjects often become socially harassed. Thus these constant stressors may lead to development of psychopathology in future. Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is a congenital abnormality with absence of uterus, cervix and vagina, but normal secondary sexual characteristics and external genitalia and occurs in every 1 out of 4000-10,000 females. There is also limited literature on the probable common chromosomal aetiology for both psychosis and MRKH patients. We, present here a case of MRKH syndrome, whose initial presentation was psychosis only. In this respect, we also highlight the much neglected need of appropriate psychiatric screening and provision of psychiatric care in this population.\n\nAcute abdomen in a patient with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPetriÄ Aleksandra\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background. Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH syndrome is a malformation of female genital tract (incidence 1 in 4000 female newborn children. It appears as a result of a disorder in the development of Millerian cannals. Etiology is unknown. Syndrome MRKH is the most frequent cause of primary amenorrhoea (90%. Patients with MRKH have a normal female phenotype, with normal pubic hairness and thelarche, and female karyotype (46XX followed by primary amenorrhoea. Hormonal status corresponds to healthy women, where the appearance of ovarian tumors and tumors on rudiment parts of uterus is possible. Case report. We presented a case of acute abdomen in a patient with previously not diagnosed MRKH. The diagnosis was done during the operation. Small pelvis and an abdominal part were filled with torquated tumor lump, where ovaries, oviducts, uterus or something resembling rudiment of uterus were not recognized through careful examination. Furthemore, the patient had a short, dead-end vagina. Tumorectomy was done and hystopathological finding showed the presence of vascular leiomyoma. Conclusion. The diagnosis of complex syndromes, such as MRKH, can, despite modern diagnostics, be absent for non-medical and psycho-social reasons. We can expect ovarian and uterine pathology on hypoplastic structures in these patients, as well as in healthy women. Vascular leiomyoma in the patients with MRKH was not found in the available literature.\n\nRecurrent microdeletion at 17q12 as a cause of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH syndrome: two case reports\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNovelli Antonio\n\n2009-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH consists of congenital aplasia of the uterus and the upper part of vagina due to anomalous development of MÃ¼llerian ducts, either isolated or associated with other congenital malformations, including renal, skeletal, hearing and heart defects. This disorder has an incidence of approximately 1 in 4500 newborn girls and the aetiology is poorly understood. Methods and Results we report on two patients affected by MRKH syndrome in which array-CGH analysis disclosed an identical deletion spanning 1.5 Mb of genomic DNA at chromosome 17q12. One patient was affected by complete absence of uterus and vagina, with bilaterally normal ovaries, while the other displayed agenesis of the upper part of vagina, right unicornuate uterus, non cavitating rudimentary left horn and bilaterally multicystic kidneys. The deletion encompassed two candidate genes, TCF2 and LHX1. Mutational screening of these genes in a selected group of 20 MRKH females without 17q12 deletion was negative. Conclusion Deletion 17q12 is a rare albeit recurrent anomaly mediated by segmental duplications, previously reported in subjects with developmental kidney abnormalities and diabetes. The present two patients expand the clinical spectrum associated with this imbalance and suggest that this region is a candidate locus for a subset of MRKH syndrome individuals, with or without renal defects.\n\nRecurrent microdeletion at 17q12 as a cause of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome: two case reports.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBernardini, Laura; Gimelli, Stefania; Gervasini, Cristina; Carella, Massimo; Baban, Anwar; Frontino, Giada; Barbano, Giancarlo; Divizia, Maria Teresa; Fedele, Luigi; Novelli, Antonio; BÃ©na, FrÃ©dÃ©rique; Lalatta, Faustina; Miozzo, Monica; Dallapiccola, Bruno\n\n2009-11-04\n\nMayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) consists of congenital aplasia of the uterus and the upper part of vagina due to anomalous development of MÃ¼llerian ducts, either isolated or associated with other congenital malformations, including renal, skeletal, hearing and heart defects.

First described more than 400 years ago, this complement of anomalies now rechristened, the MRKH syndrome has been extensively studied. Found to occur once in every 4000 females; estimated on its incidence vary from 1/5000 to 1/20,000. Despite its fairly wide prevalence, this syndrome has remained largely underdiagnosed or cryptic. Social and cultural perceptions have perforce driven, the wide existence of the very personal handicap underground and unacceptable. Accidentally discovered during routine examination, during secondarily associated medical problems, the mullerian agenecies syndrome has been subject of a wide range of clinical and laboratory investigations. The oddity in the syndrome is that the patient appears absolutely normal and that it presents with no genetic marker. We herein report the palmar dermatoglyphic and doctylographic features of a patient with MRKH syndrome. However interpretation, show conclusively, at least in this single case that the MRKH syndrome can be diagnosed through its characteristic dermatography patterns. In our view, routine dermatographic study of all live females births may lead to not only an early but also a cost effective diagnostic method.\n\nThe treatment of cyclic pelvic pain in 35 years old patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlpaslan Kaban\n\n2012-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH Syndrome comprises the absence or hypoplasia of the uterus and the upper two third of the vagina. Diagnosis of these patients may be delayed until the period of adolescence or even sexualy active period because the external appearance of patients are the same with completely normal female and often do not have any complaints. Renal, cardiac, skeletal abnormalities, pulmonary and hearing defects may be associated with MRKH Sydrome. Accuracy of diagnosis of MRKH syndrome is very important for providing psychological support, acquisition of normal sexual function, treatment and to give advice on assisted reproductive techniques. In these cases, a detailed systemic evaluation for the presence of other accompanying system anomalies should not be Accuracy of diagnosis. Our presentation is about a patient with 36 year old with MRKH Sydrome diagnosed at the age of 16 and had undergone vaginoplasty operation there after she could be sexually active.\n\nMR findings of Mayer-Rokiansky-Kuster-Hause syndrome: two cases report\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKim, Tae Hoon\n\n1997-01-01\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome in two 21-year-old women. In one ase MRI revealed that fluid filled an area of the uterus measuring about 4x4cm, but that the ovaeies were normal; in the other case, a rudimentary uterus and normal ovaries were seen. MRI is useful both in the planning of surgical management and in evaluating the details of pelvic anatomy and uterine morphologic characteristics.=20\n\n[Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome: two cases report].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nÃvila-Vergara, Marco Antonio; LeÃ³n-Ãlvarez, DamiÃ¡n Alfredo; LÃ³pez-Villegas, Miriam Nayeli; Quintero-Medrano, Samantha Melissa; Angulo-Bueno, Gladys Fabiola; Vadillo-Ortega, Felipe\n\n2015-03-01\n\nAgenesia of the MÃ¼llerian ducts is a low-frequency congenital disease but with devastating effects on women's reproductive health. In this paper we present two cases of women affected by Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH). First case was a 17-year-old woman with aplasia of the upper vagina and absence of uterus. No other defects were found and was classified as type 1-MRKH. Second case was 18-year-old woman with absence of uterus, escoliosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, classified as type II-MRKH. Patients were seen at the Hospital with primary amenorrhea and fully developed secondary sexual characteristics. A clinical follow-up protocol, including the use of high-resolution image studies was used for diagnosis.

Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) affects 1 in 4500 female births and, rarely, it might be associated with gonadal dysgenesis. A 17-year-old girl was referred to our clinic with short stature and primary amenorrhea. The patient was diagnosed with Turner syndrome and underwent estrogen therapy. At the age of 24Â years, just after the patient's sexual initiation, the first complete gynecological examination was performed. A blind-ending vagina was revealed and the patient was diagnosed with MRKH. Early diagnosis of coexistence of MRKH and Turner syndrome, although very difficult, might prevent patients from developing serious complications.

This association has never previously been reported in the medical literature. Case presentation A nine-year-old Indian girl was referred to our hospital for growth retardation, mental retardation, lax joints, generalized hypertrichosis, and hypoplastic fifth fingernails and toenails. A thorough medical examination and evaluation revealed she had phenotypic features of Coffin-Siris syndrome, with Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome on radiological evaluation. The karyotype of our patient was normal. Conclusion In an unexplained case of mental retardation with facies suggestive of Coffin-Siris syndrome, association with Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome should be considered and the patient should be evaluated for the same. Both of these syndromes may have a common pathogenesis, as yet unknown.

Previous attempts to identify causal mutations of MRKH syndrome have primarily resulted in negative outcomes. We investigated whether these reported variants are associated with MRKH syndrome (types I and II in a relatively large sample size of Chinese Han patients, and whether any gene-gene epistatic interactions exist among these variants.This study included 182 unrelated Chinese women with MRKH syndrome (155 with type I and 27 with type II and 228 randomized female controls. Seventeen candidate loci in the AMH, PBX1, WNT4, WNT7A, WNT9B, HOXA10, HOXA11, LHXA1 and GALT genes were genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform. Single-marker association, additive effects and multifactor interactions were investigated.The gene frequency distributions of MRKH type 1 and type 2 were similar. Rs34072914 in WNT9B was found to be associated with MRKH syndrome (P = 0.024, OR = 2.65, 95%CI = 1.14-6.17. The dominant models of rs34072914 and rs2275558 in WNT9B and PBX1, respectively, were significantly associated with MRKH syndrome risk in the Chinese Han patients. Additive gene-gene interaction analyses indicated a significant synergetic interaction between WNT9B and PBX1 (RERI = 1.397, AP = 0.493, SI = 4.204. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR analysis revealed novel dimensional epistatic four-gene effects (AMH, PBX1, WNT7A and WNT9B in MRKH syndrome.This association study successfully identified two susceptibility SNPs (WNT9B and PBX1 associated with MRKH syndrome risk, both separately and interactively. The discovery of a four-gene epistatic effect (AMH, PBX1, WNT7A and WNT9B in MRKH syndrome provides novel information for the elucidation of the genetic mechanism underlying the etiology of MRKH syndrome.\n\nAn incidental coexistence of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome with pelvic ectopic kidney and perirenal endometrioma\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBalci, O.; Karatayli, R.; Capar, M.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn this case report, Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome with pelvic ectopic kidney and a perirenal cyst with endometrial tissue inside is demonstrated. A 17 year old patient admitted with primary amenorrhea. Pubertal stages were completed. In pelvic ultrasonography; uterus could not be detected, a 6x11 cm sized cystic lesion was seen on the right adnexal area. A centrally located 5.5x9 cm sized ectopic pelvic kidney was detected. Hormones and tumor markers were normal. Laparoscopy was planned. In the laparoscopic observation, uterus and both tubes could not be detected, ovaries were normal. There was a 6x7 cm sized cyst located in the retroperitoneal area, the origin of cyst could not be identified. Laparatomy was considered, retroperitoneal space was entered, an 8x11 sized smooth contoured perirenal cyst adjacent to the pelvic kidney was detected. Cyst was extirpated. The pathology result was reported to include endometrial tissue and hemorrhage inside.

Case report A case showing pulmonary hypoplasia, hip dysplasia, hereditary renal adysplasia, and Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome in adulthood is reported here. The i.v. pyelography showed right renal agenesis with a normal left kidney and ureter. Ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging also showed right renal agenesis with multicystic embryonary remnants in the right hemipelvis probably corresponding to a dysgenetic kidney. An uretrocystoscopy showed absence of ectopic ureter and of the right hemitrigone. She was scheduled for a diagnostic laparoscopy and creation of a neovagina according to the McIndoe technique with a prosthesis and skin graft. Laparoscopy confirmed the absence of the uterus. On both sides, an elongated, solid, rudimentary uterine horn could be observed. Both ovaries were also elongated, located high in both abdominal flanks and somewhat dysgenetics. A conventional cytogenetic study revealed a normal female karyotype 46, XX at a level of 550 GTG bands. A CGH analysis was performed using a 244K oligoarray CGH detecting 11 copy number variants described as normal variants in the databases. The 17q12 and 22q11.21 microdeletions described in other MRKH patients were not present in this case. Four years after operation her evolution is normal, without symptoms and the neovagina is adequately functional. The geneticists have studied her family history and the pedigree of the family is shown. Conclusions We suggest that primary damage to the mesoderm (paraaxil, intermediate, and lateral) caused by mutations in a yet unidentified gene is responsible for: 1) skeletal dysplasia, 2) inappropriate interactions between the bronchial mesoderm and endodermal\n\nSurrogate in vitro fertilization outcome in typical and atypical forms of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRaziel, A; Friedler, S; Gidoni, Y; Ben Ami, I; Strassburger, D; Ron-El, R\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe genital malformations in Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) are frequently accompanied by associated malformations whose forms were recently classified as typical (isolated uterovaginal aplasia/hypoplasia) and atypical (the addition of malformations in the ovary or renal system). The aim of this study was to compare the surrogate IVF performance of women with typical and atypical forms including their chances of achieving pregnancy. The follow-up data on a total of 102 cycles of surrogate IVF in 27 MRKH patients treated in our department between 2000 and 2010 were analysed. Twenty patients with the typical form who underwent 72 IVF cycles were compared with seven patients with the atypical form who underwent 30 IVF cycles. The various examined parameters of these intended mothers were age, hormonal profile during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and laboratory outcome. The mean number of gonadotrophin ampoules needed for stimulation and treatment duration was significantly higher in the atypical form (3600 Â± 1297IU for 13 Â± 2.3 days versus 2975 Â± 967 IU for 11.6 Â± 1.6 days, Pâ¤ 0.01). Serum estradiol and progesterone levels measured on the hCG administration day were similar. A significantly higher mean number of follicles 12.6 Â± 6 versus 8.9 Â± 5.4, Pâ¤ 0.03, metaphase II (MII) oocytes 8.7 Â± 5.1 versus 6.7 Â± 4.8, Pâ¤ 0.05, fertilizations 6 Â± 3.6 versus 4.4 Â± 3.3, Pâ¤ 0.03 and cleaving embryos 5.7 Â± 3.8 versus 4.1 Â± 3.3, Pâ¤ 0.01 were available in patients with the typical form compared with those with the atypical form, respectively. There was no significant difference in fertilization rate, cleavage rate or the mean number of transferred embryos. Embryo quality of the transferred ones and pregnancy rate per cycle were also similar between the two groups. Women with the typical form of MRKH needed fewer gonadotrophins and for a shorter duration for ovarian hyperstimulation.

As uterine transplantation is still an experimental procedure, data on their clinical outcome using assisted reproduction techniques are imperative to allow evidence-based counselling. For this purpose, a systematic non-restricted electronic literature search was conducted. The 14 studies included in this review were published between 1988 and 2011. From a cohort of 140 patients with MRKH syndrome, mostly from the the USA and Israel, only four studies contained data on more than 10 patients; the others were case reports or small series. In the studies reviewed, 125 patients underwent 369 cycles of IVF with gestational surrogacy, and delivered 71 newborns. The reporting of outcome of patients with MRKH syndrome undergoing assisted reproduction techniques in the available literature is less than optimal and is characterized by bias of publication, inconsistent reports, including few patients, treated over a long time span, and lacking systematic reports from large IVF centres. None of the national registries contain specific outcome data on patients with MRKH syndrome. The paucity of data limits the possibility to draw firm conclusions but substantiates the need for a systematic multicentre reporting system. Copyright Â© 2015 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

Pelvic magnetic resonance images and medical records of 92 MRKH patients were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were subgrouped by uterine morphology: uterine agenesis, unilateral rudimentary uterus and bilateral rudimentary uteri. Uterine volume, presence of endometrium, location of ovary, endometriosis and pelvic pain were compared among groups. The mean uterine volume was 33.5 ml (17.5-90.0 ml) for unilateral uterine remnants, and 16.1 ml (3.5-21.5 ml) for bilateral uterine rudiments (p<0.01). The incidence of presence of endometrium (100% vs. 22%, p<0.001), haematometra (56% vs. 3%, p<0.001) and ovarian endometriosis (22% vs. 3%, p<0.01) was significantly increased in the group of unilateral rudimentary uteri as compared with the group of bilateral uterine remnants. Thirty-one patients (38%) showed ectopic ovaries. Pelvic pain was more common in individuals with unilateral rudimentary uterus than those who had no (56% vs. 5%, p<0.01) or bilateral uterine remnants (56% vs. 14%, p<0.05).

METHODS: the study was a retrospective analysis of a series of 28 patients with the MRKH syndrome conducted from 1990 to 2003. The patients were attended and treated at the AmbulatÃ³rio de Ginecologia Infanto-Puberal (AGIP of the Hospital UniversitÃ¡rio of the Faculdade de Medicina de RibeirÃ£o Preto of the Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (FMRP-USP, being submitted to neovaginoplasty by the technique of McIndoe and Bannister, modified by the use of a human amniotic membrane graft. Epithelization, amplitude and depth of the neovaginas were evaluated 7 and 40 days after the procedure. Patient satisfaction was determined during the late postoperative period in terms of the presence of discomfort and dyspareunia during sexual relations. RESULTS: postoperatively, seven patients (25% presented vaginal stenosis and six of them were submitted to a new surgical intervention, one had shortening of the neovagina, corrected with the use of exercises with a vaginal mold, three (10.7% developed a rectovaginal fistula, one (3.6% a uterovesical fistula, and one (3.6% excess skin in the vaginal introitus - all successfully corrected with surgery. Four patients (14.3% presented urinary tract infection. Two months after surgery, 11/19 patients (57.8% presented satisfactory sexual activity and 42% dyspareunia, and within a maximum period of four years, 20/21 patients (95.2% had satisfactory sexual activity and 4.8% dyspareunia. CONCLUSIONS: an amniotic membrane graft is a good option for the treatment of vaginal agenesis. Perioperative follow-up involves educational guidance regarding the use of the mold and regarding patient sexuality in order to reduce the complaints of dysfunctional coitus in the presence of a favorable surgical evolution and a neovagina of adequate aspect.\n\nSensibility of vagina reconstructed by McIndoe method in Mayer-KÃ¼ster-Rokitansky-Hauser syndrome\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nVesanoviÄ Svetlana\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Background/Aim. Congenital absence of vagina is a failure present in Mayer-KÃ¼ster-Rokitansky-Hauser syndrome. Treatment of this anomaly includes nonoperative and operative procedures. McIndoe procedure uses split skin graft by Thiersch. The aim of this study was to determine sensitivity (touch, warmness, coldness of a vagina reconstructed by McIndoe method in Mayer-KÃ¼ster-Rokitansky-Hauser syndrome and compare it with the normal vagina. Methods. A total of 21 female persons with reconstructed vagina by McIndoe method and 21 female persons with normal vagina were observed. All female persons were divided into groups and subgroups (according to age. Sensibility to touch, warmness and coldness were examined, applying VonFrey's esthesiometer and termoesthesiometer for warmness and coldness in three regions of vagina (enter, middle wall, bothom. The number of positive answers was registrated by touching the mucosa regions for five seconds, five times. Results. The obtained results showed that female patients with a reconstructed vagina by McIndoe method, felt touch at the middle part of wall and in the bottom of vagina better than patients with normal one. Also, the first ones felt warmness at the middle part of wall and coldness in the bottom of vagina, better than the patients with normal vagina. Other results showed no difference in sensibility between reconstructed and normal vagina. Conclusion. Various types of sensibility (touch, warmness, coldness are better or the same in vaginas reconstructed by McIndoe method, in comparison with normal ones. This could be explained by the fact that skin grafts are capable of recovering sensibility.\n\nA Rare Case of Primary Amenorrhea with Two Etiologies, Hypothalamic Amenorrhea, Transverse Vaginal Septum, and No Hematocolpos\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGhaffari, Firouzeh; Keikha, Fatemeh; Arabipoor, Arezoo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe reported a rare case of hypothalamic amenorrhea and transverse vaginal septum.

The syndrome is defined as uterovaginal aplasia in female with normal 46,XX karyotype. A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of MRKHS patients diagnosed or treated at the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinical Hospital of Poznan University of Medical Sciences between 2010 and 2015. Sixty-eight patients (54,4%) were found to have one or more coexisting anomalies. Thirty-eight patients (55,9% of cases with concomitant malformations, 30,4% of the entire study group) had coexisting anomalies of at least two organ systems. The most frequent extragenital malformations were skeletal anomalies found in 40 patients (32%) and renal anomalies found in 36 patients (28,8%). Fifty-seven patients (45,6%) were diagnosed with typical form (type 1) and 16 (12,8%) with the atypical form (type 2) of MRKHS. In the other 52 patients (41,6%) we diagnosed MURCS association. Five of our patients (4%) had karyotype abnormalities. Our study confirms complexity and clinical heterogeneity of MRKHS. Concomitant congenital malformations are present in about half of MRKHS women. A significant proportion of patients have coexisting anomalies of at least two organ systems. The most common coexisting findings are musculoskeletal and renal abnormalities. Chromosomal aberrations may be present in patients with either typical or atypical form of MRKHS.

During this transition period, adolescents change from pediatric to adult medical care. This process must be carefully structured, particularly when special medical care is required. Challenges and difficulties become apparent particularly in the case of rare diseases. This is increasingly so when the rare disease affects the adolescence-specific development of patients, such as Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS, also known as MÃ¼llerian agenesis. Methods A systematic literature review identified the care requirements of girls and young women with MRKHS, as well as studies of medical care during the adolescent transition period for various other diseases. This investigation was carried out in the years 2012 and 2013, and was updated in 2014/2015. In addition, the reference lists of the identified studies were reviewed. Results Nine publications on MRKHS and ten publications on the transition from adolescence to adulthood were included. Medical care requirements and measures were identified for the following areas: diagnosis during adolescence and organization of medical care, reactions to the diagnosis, functional infertility, psychological stress and threat to self-image, contact with others, and dealing with MRKHS coping strategies. Discussion There is still a great demand for research in the area of care during the transition period from adolescence into adulthood, particularly for rare diseases. The recommendations for treating MRKHS patients derived from the literature should be implemented and evaluated with regard to their effectiveness.\n\nHigh incidence of recurrent copy number variants in patients with isolated and syndromic MÃ¼llerian aplasia.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNik-Zainal, Serena; Strick, Reiner; Storer, Mekayla; Huang, Ni; Rad, Roland; Willatt, Lionel; Fitzgerald, Tomas; Martin, Vicki; Sandford, Richard; Carter, Nigel P; Janecke, Andreas R; Renner, Stefan P; Oppelt, Patricia G; Oppelt, Peter; Schulze, Christine; Brucker, Sara; Hurles, Matthew; Beckmann, Matthias W; Strissel, Pamela L; Shaw-Smith, Charles\n\n2011-03-01\n\nCongenital malformations involving the MÃ¼llerian ducts are observed in around 5% of infertile women. Complete aplasia of the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina, also termed MÃ¼llerian aplasia or Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, occurs with an incidence of around 1 in 4500 female births, and occurs in both isolated and syndromic forms. Previous reports have suggested that a proportion of cases, especially syndromic cases, are caused by variation in copy number at different genomic loci. In order to obtain an overview of the contribution of copy number variation to both isolated and syndromic forms of MÃ¼llerian aplasia, copy number assays were performed in a series of 63 cases, of which 25 were syndromic and 38 isolated. A high incidence (9/63, 14%) of recurrent copy number variants in this cohort is reported here. These comprised four cases of microdeletion at 16p11.2, an autism susceptibility locus not previously associated with MÃ¼llerian aplasia, four cases of microdeletion at 17q12, and one case of a distal 22q11.2 microdeletion. Microdeletions at 16p11.2 and 17q12 were found in 4/38 (10.5%) cases with isolated MÃ¼llerian aplasia, and at 16p11.2, 17q12 and 22q11.2 (distal) in 5/25 cases (20%) with syndromic MÃ¼llerian aplasia. The finding of microdeletion at 16p11.2 in 2/38 (5%) of isolated and 2/25 (8%) of syndromic cases suggests a significant contribution of this copy number variant alone to the pathogenesis of MÃ¼llerian aplasia. Overall, the high incidence of recurrent copy number variants in all forms of MÃ¼llerian aplasia has implications for the understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of the condition, and for genetic counselling in families affected by it.\n\nA complex microdeletion 17q12 phenotype in a patient with recurrent de novo membranous nephropathy.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHinkes, Bernward; Hilgers, Karl F; Bolz, Hanno J; Goppelt-Struebe, Margarete; Amann, Kerstin; Nagl, Sandra; Bergmann, Carsten; Rascher, Wolfgang; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Jacobi, Johannes\n\n2012-05-14\n\nMicrodeletions on chromosome 17q12 cause of diverse spectrum of disorders and have only recently been identified as a rare cause of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuester-Hauser-Syndrome (MRKH), which is characterized by uterus aplasia Â± partial/complete vaginal aplasia in females with a regular karyotype. For the first time we report about a patient with a 17q12 microdeletion who is affected by MRKH in combination with a vascular and soft tissue disorder. Repeatedly she suffered from kidney transplant failure caused by consuming membranous nephropathy. A 38-year-old female patient had been diagnosed with right kidney aplasia, left kidney dysplasia and significantly impaired renal function during infancy. Aged 16 she had to start hemodialysis. Three years later she received her first kidney transplant. Only then she was diagnosed with MRKH. The kidney transplant was lost due to consuming nephrotic syndrome caused by de novo membranous nephropathy, as was a second kidney transplant years later. In addition, a hyperelasticity syndrome affects the patient with congenital joint laxity, kyphoscoliosis, bilateral hip dysplasia, persistent hypermobility of both elbows, knees and hips. Her clinical picture resembles a combination of traits of a hypermobile and a vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos-Syndrome, but no mutations in the COL3A1 gene was underlying. Instead, array-based comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) detected a heterozygous 1.43 Mb deletion on chromosome 17q12 encompassing the two renal developmental genes HNF1Î² and LHX1. Deletions of HNF1Î² have recently drawn significant attention in pediatric nephrology as an important cause of prenatally hyperechogenic kidneys, renal aplasia and renal hypodysplasia. In contrast, membranous nephropathy represents an often-unaccounted cause of nephrotic syndrome in the adult population. A causative connection between theses two conditions has never been postulated, but is suggestive enough in this case to hypothesize it.\n\nIndigenous technique of fabricating vaginal mould for vaginal reconstruction and uterine drainage in McIndoe vaginoplasty using 10 ml syringe\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBrijesh Mishra\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Absence of vagina poses multitude of physical and psychosocial problems in woman's life. 10% of Mayer- Rokitansky-Ã¼ster-Hauser (MRKH syndrome patients with high vaginal septum and vaginal atreisa has additional issue of draining uterine cavity. MC Indoe vaginoplasty is universally acceptable and widely practiced procedure for neocolposis reconstruction. Simultaneous reconstruction of vagina with simultaneous continued uterine drainage presents surgical challenge. We offer a simple solution of creating a vaginal mould using a 10 ml disposable syringe, which enables graft application of neovaginal cavity with simultaneous protected uterine drainage per vaginum. Total 10 patients were included in this study of which 4 needed uterine drainage procedure in addition to neovaginal creation. All the patients fared well, there were no problems regarding graft loss or vaginal mould extrusion etc. Fabrication of mould for graft enables easy dressing changes with out disturbing the skin graft. This innovation offers a simple easily reproducible and cheap way of fabricating vaginal mould for McIndoe vaginoplasty. It is especially useful for neovaginal graft application and simultaneous uterine drainage.\n\nBowel vaginoplasty in children\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSarin Yogesh\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFull Text Available OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience with bowel vaginoplasty done in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of eight children aged 10 months to 8 years, who underwent bowel vaginoplasty over a period of 5 years (2000-2005. The indications of bowel vaginoplasty included anorectovestibular fistula (ARVF associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH syndrome (n=6 and cloaca (n=2. The bowel segment used for vaginoplasty included colon (n=3, ileum (n=2 and duplicated rectum (n=1. In two patients of ARVF associated with uterovaginal agenesis, the distal- most part of ARVF was transected at the level of peritoneal reflection and left as neovagina, whereas the proximal bowel was pulled through at the proposed neo-anal site. All the patients were advised daily home dilatation of the neo vaginal orifice with Hegarâ²s dilators, for a period of six weeks. RESULTS: Bowel vaginoplasty was done in eight patients. None had any significant per-operative complication. Two patients had abdominal wound dehiscence, requiring secondary suturing. Two patients had mucosal prolapse of the neovagina, which required trimming. One patient died two months after discharge, because of meningitis. Out of the eight patients, seven are in regular follow-up. Six patients have neovagina, cosmetically acceptable to the parents; all have been radiologically proven to have adequate length. One patient had unacceptable perineal appearance with nipple-like vaginal orifice and scarred perineal wound, that merits a revision. None of the patients had vaginal stenosis and excessive mucus discharge, during follow-up visits. Although post surgical results are acceptable to the parents cosmetically, the sexual and psychological outcome is yet to be assessed. Conclusions: Bowel vaginoplasty is a safe and acceptable procedure to treat the pediatric patients of uterovaginal agenesis and cloaca.\n\nA complex microdeletion 17q12 phenotype in a patient with recurrent de novo membranous nephropathy\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHinkes Bernward\n\n2012-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background Microdeletions on chromosome 17q12 cause of diverse spectrum of disorders and have only recently been identified as a rare cause of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuester-Hauser-Syndrome (MRKH, which is characterized by uterus aplasia Â± partial/complete vaginal aplasia in females with a regular karyotype.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of children with vaginal atresia and Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. The sigmoid segment was used for vaginoplasty in all the cases. Results: Eight children were studied over a period of 7 years. The postoperative complications were ileus in 2, mucosal prolapse of the neovagina in 1, and minor wound infection in 1 patient. Seven patients are on regular follow-up. All the neovaginas were patent and functional. One patient had unacceptable perineal appearance, that is, badly scarred perineum as a late complication. None of the patients had vaginal stenosis or excessive mucus discharge, during follow-up visits. Out of the 7 patients, 2 patients are sexually active and satisfied. Conclusions: Sigmoid vaginoplasty is a safe and acceptable procedure for vaginal agenesis with good cosmetic results and acceptable complications rate. Sigmoid colon vaginoplasty is the treatment of choice because of its large lumen, thick walls resistant to trauma, adequate secretion allowing lubrication, not necessitating prolonged dilatation, and short recovery time.\n\nVaginoplastia: modificaciÃ³n de la tÃ©cnica de McIndoe usando esponja de gel hemostÃ¡tico Vaginoplasty: modification to McIndoe techique using hemostatic gel sponge\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nN.

This is the second most common cause of primary amennorhoea in young females who shows normal development of secondary sexual characters and endocrine profile with essential normal female phenotype & genotype (46 XX. Our study is to emphasis the role of MRI in diagnosis of this syndrome non-invasively without exposure to radiation. The excellent soft tissue anatomical details by MRI provides the diagnosis with accuracy along with information of adjacent viscera and other associated systemic anamolies.\n\nMR imaging of paediatric uterovaginal anomalies\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLang, I.M.; Babyn, P.; Oliver, G.D.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nBackground. Transabdominal ultrasound (US) has not proved completely reliable in Muellerian duct anomalies. One study has shown it useful in obstructed uterovaginal anomalies. We are unaware of a study that has used endovaginal ultrasound in children to investigate uterovaginal anomalies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now gaining wide acceptance in imaging congenital abnormalities of the genital tract. Objective. To identify the problems and potential pitfalls of using MRI to evaluate the female genital tract in paediatric patients. Materials and methods. A retrospective review of the MRI scans of 19 patients, aged 3 months to 19 years (mean 14 years), with uterovaginal anomalies. Results. The uterovaginal anomalies were categorised into three groups: (1) congenital absence of the Muellerian ducts, or the Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (n = 7), (2) disorders of vertical fusion (n = 2) and (3) disorders of lateral fusion (n = 10). Conclusions. MRI is a reliable method for evaluating paediatric uterovaginal anomalies, but should be analysed in conjunction with other imaging modalities (US and genitography). Previous surgery makes interpretation more difficult and, if possible, MRI should be carried out prior to any surgery. An accurate MRI examination can be extremely helpful prior to surgery and it is important for the radiologist to have knowledge of how these complex anomalies are managed and what pitfalls to avoid.

Case report\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMonica Matteo\n\n2004-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract Background Alterations in the normal sequence of development of mÃ¼llerian ducts lead to a wide spectrum of reproductive tract abnormalities. A rare form of lack of development, regarding a short tract of the mÃ¼llerian ducts, leads to the isolated agenesis of the uterine cervix. Anomalies identified among patients with mÃ¼llerian agenesis include skeletal deformities (i.e., scoliosis of the spine and Klippel-Feil anomaly. Case presentation A 46 years old woman presenting cyphoscoliosis and very low stature (120 cm â 3,93 feet, came to our observation for acute pelvic pain; she also reported primary amenorrhoea associated with cyclic pelvic pain. Clinical and imaging evaluation, evidenced a blind vaginal duct of normal length, left cystic adnexal mass, and enlarged uterus with hematometra. FSH, LH, 17Î² estradiol and CA-125, karyotype and radiographic study of limbs and vertebral column were also evaluated. At laparotomy, a left ovarian cyst was found. Uterus ended at the isthmus; under this level a thin fibrous tissue band was found, joining the uterus to the vagina. Uterine cervix was replaced by fibrous tissue containing some dilated glands lined with mÃ¼llerian epithelium. Karyotype resulted 46, XX. The described skeletal deformity, were consistent with Klippel-Feil syndrome. Conclusion We report a case of congenital scoliosis associated with mÃ¼llerian agenesis limited to uterine cervix, association thus far seen only among patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (utero-vaginal agenesis. This case report supports the necessity to evaluate, for accompanying mÃ¼llerian anomalies, all cases of congenital structural scoliosis in view of the possibility for many mÃ¼llerian development abnormalities, if timely diagnosed, to be surgically corrected.\n\nCauses of amenorrhea in Korea: Experience of a single large center\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKwon, Su-Kyoung; Lee, Kyung-Hee; Kim, Sung-Hoon; Kim, Chung-Hoon; Kang, Byung-Moon\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective To investigate the causes of amenorrhea in Korean women. Methods Medical records from 1,212 women with amenorrhea who visited the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Asan Medical Center, between January 1989 and December 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. Amenorrhea was categorized as either primary or secondary. Results Primary amenorrhea was identified in 132 of the patients (10.9%) and secondary amenorrhea in 1,080 (89.1%). The most frequent causes of primary amenorrhea were gonadal dysgenesis (28.0%, 37/132); Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome (20.0%, 27/132); and constitutional delay and androgen insensitivity syndrome (8.3%, 11/132; 8.3%, 11/132, respectively). Secondary amenorrhea was due to polycystic ovary syndrome (48.4%, 523/1,080); premature ovarian insufficiency (14.0%, 151/1,080); and nutrition-related hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (8.3%, 90/1,080). Conclusion In this retrospective study, gonadal dysgenesis was the most common cause of primary amenorrhea and polycystic ovary syndrome was the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea in Korean women.

The aim of the mixed-method study presented was to examine the self-perception of CAIS individuals regarding different aspects of gender and to identify commonalities and differences in comparison with subfertile and infertile XX-chromosomal women with diagnoses of Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome (MRKHS) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The study sample comprised 11 participants with CAIS, 49 with MRKHS, and 55 with PCOS. Gender identity was assessed by means of a multidimensional instrument, which showed significant differences between the CAIS group and the XX-chromosomal women. Other-than-female gender roles and neither-female-nor-male sexes/genders were reported only by individuals with CAIS. The percentage with a not exclusively androphile sexual orientation was unexceptionally high in the CAIS group compared to the prevalence in \"normative\" women and the clinical groups. The findings support the assumption made by Meyer-Bahlburg ( 2010 ) that gender outcome in people with CAIS is more variable than generally stated. Parents and professionals should thus be open to courses of gender development other than typically female in individuals with CAIS.\n\nAuthor Details\n\nAfrican Journals Online (AJOL)\n\nPanti, AA.

It is compared to Kaspar Hauser, similarities and differences are highlighted. The \"Kaspar Hauser of Stuttgart\" is retrospectively revealed as a young man with experiences of severe deprivation. The missing case history and independent history were an obstacle in the treatment, albeit not fundamental, advantages being reached with a relation-oriented approach. Informations obtained after clarification of the identity of the young man suggest a multiplication of unfavourable circumstances, leading to sub-optimal treatment and finally the \"Kaspar-Hauser-Situation\". Contributing were his belonging to the less integrated group of migrants in Germany, as well as severe deprivation in the family and a generally sub-optimal treatment of mentally disturbed young patients.\n\nHubungan Imunoekspresi NF-kB dengan Sinus Rokitansky Aschoff pada Kolesistitis Kronik\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHerry Yulianti\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Carcinoma of the gallbladder is relatively uncommon but it is a very lethal disease. Gallbladder cancer constitutes 3â4% of all malignant lesions and ranks 5th among the digestive system tumors. Gallblader carcinoma is difficult to detect and diagnose in early stage because it usually has very slight symptoms or asymptomatic. It becomes increasingly necessary to make early diagnosis and identification of high-risk patient,as well as gallstone and history of chronic cholecystitis. Chronic cholecystitis is a chronic inflammation of gallbladder associated with cholelithiasis in more than 90% of cases. Cholelithiasis is one of the important etiological factors in carcinoma of the gallbladder. The histological examination of chronical cholecystitis shows the presence of Rokitansky Aschoff sinuses. Genetic approaches have proven that the components of inflammation such as primary inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF, IL-6 and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB play the key roles in carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study was to understand the correlation between the immunoexpression of NF-kB and Rokitansky Aschoff sinuses in chronic cholecystitis. The method was cross sectional of 30 cases of chronic cholecystitis from Department of Pathology Anatomy of Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung/Faculty of Medicine Universitas Padjadjaran in 2010â2011. A section from 4 Âµm-thick paraffin embedded tissue of chronic cholecystitis was stained with hematoxylin eosin for histopatological evaluation and immunohistochemical using polyclonal NF-kB antibody. Immunoreactive cells was counted in five tumor areas of 400x field by light microscopy. The result showed a significant correlation between the immunoexpression of NFkB and Rokitansky Aschoff sinuses (p=0.000. In conclusion, there is a correlation between immunoexpression of NFkB and Rokitansky Aschoff sinuses because as the immunoexpression of NFkB increase, more Rokitansky\n\nOvarian maldescent\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nTrinidad, Carmen; Tardaguila, Francisco; Fernandez, Gabriel C.; Martinez, Concepcion; Chavarri, Elena; Rivas, Isabel [Departments of Radiology and Gynecology, Povisa Medical Center, Salamanca St. 5, 36211, Vigo (Pontevedra) (Spain)\n\n2004-05-01\n\nUndescended ovary is a rare disorder that can be associated with muellerian malformations. There is an unclear association with infertility and malignant disease. When an ovary is not in its normal location, it is sought in other locations above the pelvic brim. This is important in cases of undetermined cyclical abdominal pain, follicle aspiration and surgical castration. MRI has proven to be the best imaging method for finding an ovary in an anomalous position and for disregarding associated malformations. We report two patients with unilateral ovarian maldescent, one of them with Rokitansky-Kuester-Hauser syndrome. A review of the literature is included.

The European climax of a long line of wild children, Kaspar Hauser was a nineteenth-century German foundling whose fate has inspired a host of novels, dramas, novellas, poems, songs, and movies, even an opera and a ballet. It has been treated by Paul Verlaine, R. M. Rilke, and Klaus Mann, by the Dada poet Hans Arp, by the dramatist Peter Handke, and by the filmmaker Werner Herzog. This article offers a brief historical sketch of Hauser's life before discussing a key aspect of the literary Kaspar Hauser reception: the motif of the foundling as a latter-day messiah. By examining a set of twentieth-century texts that develop this motif in an exemplary mannerâJakob Wassermann's novel Caspar Hauser or The Inertia of the Heart , Georg Trakl's Kaspar Hauser Song , the anthroposophist Kaspar Hauser poems by Emma Krell-Werth, and David Constantine's Caspar Hauser: A Poem in Nine Cantos âwe can gain insight into our century's desire for redemption and its ethical ramifications.\n\nConvergence of mayer expansions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrydges, D.C.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe tree graph bound of Battle and Federbush is extended and used to provide a simple criterion for the convergence of (iterated) Mayer expansions.

He quickly became the centre of social interest but also the victim of intrigue. His appearance, his origin and assassination in 1833 were, and still are, the source of much debate. The most widely accepted theory postulates that Kaspar Hauser was the son of Grand Duke Carl von Baden and his wife Stephanie de Beauharnais, an adopted daughter of Napoleon Bonaparte. To check this theory, DNA analysis was performed on the clothes most likely worn by Kaspar Hauser when he was stabbed on December 14th, 1833. A suitable bloodstain from the underpants was divided and analysed independently by the Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Munich (ILM) and the Forensic Science Service Laboratory, Birmingham (FSS). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was sequenced from the bloodstain and from blood samples obtained from two living maternal relatives of Stephanie de Beauharnais. The sequence from the bloodstained clothing differed from the sequence found in both reference blood samples at seven confirmed positions. This proves that the bloodstain does not originate from a son of Stephanie de Beauharnais. Thus, it is becoming clear that Kaspar Hauser was not the Prince of Baden.\n\nDerivation of Mayer Series from Canonical Ensemble\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWang Xian-Zhi\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMayer derived the Mayer series from both the canonical ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble by use of the cluster expansion method. In 2002, we conjectured a recursion formula of the canonical partition function of a fluid (X.Z. Wang, Phys. Rev. E 66 (2002) 056102). In this paper we give a proof for this formula by developing an appropriate expansion of the integrand of the canonical partition function.

GonzÃ¡lez\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The reading of Arnold HauserÂ´s work, in particular his book Der Manierismus, written in 1964, that deals with Spanish literature, allows us to overcome the usual classifications found in manuals of this area based only on chronological data. Hauser calls \"Mannerism\" the crisis of the Renaissance, distinguishing it from European Baroque movements. Some of the Spanish authors and their works from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries respond to the characteristics of Mannerism, if one takes into account their perspectivism, the presence of paradox, their cerebral construction, the discovery of the modern reader, their autonomy as literary works, the overcoming of the classical genders, the use of dialog, etc, and can, therefore, be seen as the basis of the literary Modernity.\n\nGenetics Home Reference: congenital central hypoventilation syndrome\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n...

AtÃ© hoje o seu enigma persiste: apesar de muitas hipÃ³teses e suspeitas, nÃ£o se descobriu sua origem. Apoiando-se em estudos de Vygotsky e Luria, que indicam que a percepÃ§Ã£o depende, sobretudo, da prÃ¡xis social, necessÃ¡ria para gestar o referencial cultural de apreensÃ£o da realidade, a autora analisa como se articulam linguagem e pensamento no desenvolvimento cognitivo de Kaspar Hauser e como ele concebe o mundo que o cerca, tendo sido privado dos filtros e estereÃ³tipos culturais que condicionam a percepÃ§Ã£o e o conhecimento.Starting from a historical-cultural approach in Psychology, this work analyzes the development of Kaspar Hauser, a real and enigmatic character that didn't know how to speak, nor to walk and didn't behave as a human being when he was found in Nuremberg, in 1928, at supposedly age 15. Still today, his enigma remains: in spite of a lot of hypotheses and suspicions we have not yet discovered its origins. Leaning on studies of Vygotsky and Luria, which indicate that the perception depends, above all, on the social practice which is necessary to produce the cultural reference for the apprehension of reality, the author analyzes how language and thought are articulated in Kaspar Hauser's cognitive development and how he conceives the world that surrounds him, having been deprived from the filters and cultural stereotypes that stipulate the perception and knowledge.\n\nMrkH, a novel c-di-GMP-dependent transcriptional activator, controls Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilm formation by regulating type 3 fimbriae expression.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJonathan J Wilksch\n\n2011-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Klebsiella pneumoniae causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly amongst hospitalized individuals. The principle mechanism for pathogenesis in hospital environments involves the formation of biofilms, primarily on implanted medical devices. In this study, we constructed a transposon mutant library in a clinical isolate, K. pneumoniae AJ218, to identify the genes and pathways implicated in biofilm formation. Three mutants severely defective in biofilm formation contained insertions within the mrkABCDF genes encoding the main structural subunit and assembly machinery for type 3 fimbriae. Two other mutants carried insertions within the yfiN and mrkJ genes, which encode GGDEF domain- and EAL domain-containing c-di-GMP turnover enzymes, respectively. The remaining two isolates contained insertions that inactivated the mrkH and mrkI genes, which encode for novel proteins with a c-di-GMP-binding PilZ domain and a LuxR-type transcriptional regulator, respectively. Biochemical and functional assays indicated that the effects of these factors on biofilm formation accompany concomitant changes in type 3"
