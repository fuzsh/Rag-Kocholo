        "text": "Weierstrass Approximation theorem in real analysis presents the notion of approximating continuous functions by polynomial functions. According to the theorem, every continuous function defined on a closed interval [a, b] can approximately be represented by a polynomial function. Polynomial functions are simple functions that even computers can easily process, hence the Weierstrass Approximation theorem has great practical as well as theoretical utility. Especially, when it comes to polynomial interpolations in numerical analysis.\n\nThe Weierstrass Approximation theorem is named after German mathematician Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass. He gave this result when he was 70 years old.\n\nStatement of the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem\n\nLet f: [a,b] → R be a real valued continuous function. Then we can find polynomials pn(x) such that every pn converges uniformly to x on [a,b].\n\nIn other words, if f is a continuous real-valued function on [a, b] and if any ε > 0 is given, then there exist a polynomial P on [a, b] such that |f(x) – P(x)| < ε, for every x in [a, b].\n\nThe essence of this theorem is that no matter how much complicated the function f is given, we can always find a polynomial that is as close to f as we desire.\n\nProof of Weierstrass Approximation Theorem\n\nThere are several ways of proving this theorem. Here we shall see the proof by using Bernstein Polynomial.\n\nDefinition of Bernstein Polynomial: If f is a real valued function defined on [0, 1], then for n ∈ N, the nth Bernstein Polynomial of f is defined as\n\nBn(x, f) :=\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sum_{k=0}^{n}f\\left ( \\frac{k}{n} \\right )\\begin{pmatrix}n \\\\k\\end{pmatrix}x_{k}(1-x)_{n-k}\\end{array} \\)\n\nProof: To prove the theorem on closed intervals [a,b], without loss of generality we can take the closed interval as [0, 1]. Now consider f is a continuous real-valued function on [0,1]. Since [0, 1] is compact, the continuity of f implies uniform continuity. Now for a given ε > 0 there exist 𝛿 > 0 by the definition of uniform continuity of functions\n\n|x – y| ≤ 𝛿 ⇒ |f(x) – f(y)| ≤ ε/2 for every x, y ∈ [0, 1].\n\nLet M = ||f||∞ exists as f is a continuous function on a compact set [0, 1]. Now, fix ζ ∈ [0, 1]. Then by uniform continuity of f we can have\n\n|x – ζ| ≤ 𝛿 ⇒ |f(x) – f(ζ)| ≤ ε/2\n\nNow, |f(x) – f(ζ)| ≤ 2M ≤ 2M [(x – ζ)/ 𝛿]2 + ε/2\n\nthat is, |f(x) – f(ζ)| ≤ 2M [(x – ζ)/ 𝛿]2 + ε/2 ∀ x ∈ [0, 1].\n\nThe Bernstein Polynomial is used to approximate f on [0, 1].\n\nBn(x, f – f(ζ)) =\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sum_{k=0}^{n}(f-f(\\zeta))\\left ( \\frac{k}{n} \\right )\\binom{n}{k} x^{k}(1-x)^{n-k}\\end{array} \\)\n\n= Bn(x, f) – f(ζ)Bn(x, 1)\n\nAnd, Bn(x, 1) =\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\binom{n}{k}x^{k}(1-x)^{n-k} = (x+(1-x))^{n}=1\\end{array} \\)\n\nwhere the Binomial Theorem is used.\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\left|B_{n}(x, f)-f(\\zeta) \\right|=\\left|B_{n}(x,f-f(\\zeta)) \\right|\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\leq B_{n}\\left ( x,2M\\left ( \\frac{x- \\zeta}{\\delta } \\right )^{2}+ \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\right ) \\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}= \\frac{2M}{\\delta ^{2}} B_{n}(x,(x- \\zeta )^{2})+ \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\end{array} \\)\n\nSince, if 0 ≤ f ⇒ Bn(x, f) and if g ≤ f ⇒ Bn(x, f).\n\nNow,\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}B_{n}(x, (x- \\zeta)^{2})= x^{2}+ \\frac{1}{n}(x – x^{2})-2 \\zeta x + \\zeta ^{2}\\end{array} \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\left| (B_{n}(x,f)-f(\\zeta))\\right|\\leq \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}+\\frac{2M}{\\delta ^{2}}(x- \\zeta)^{2}+\\frac{2M}{\\delta^{2}}\\frac{1}{n}(x- x ^{2})\\end{array} \\)\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\left| (B_{n}(x,f)-f(\\zeta))\\right|\\leq \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}+\\frac{2M}{\\delta ^{2}}\\frac{1}{n}(\\zeta- \\zeta ^{2})\\end{array} \\)\n\nA simple calculation shows that on [0, 1], the maximum of z – z2 is ¼. Thus,\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\left| (B_{n}(x,f)-f(\\zeta))\\right|\\leq \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}+\\frac{M}{2\\delta ^{2}n}\\end{array} \\)\n\nLet N ≥ M/(2𝛿2ε), then for n ≥ N, we have\n\n|| (Bn(ζ, f) – f(ζ)||∞ ≤ ε.\n\nThis proves the theorem for continuous functions on [0, 1]. By application of the theorem for function on [0, 1], the case for an arbitrary interval [a, b] follows.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nContinuity of Functions\n\nUniform Convergence\n\nFatou’s Lemma\n\nLimits\n\nSolved Example on Weierstrass Approximation Theorem\n\nExample:\n\nIf\n\n\\(\\begin{array}{l}\\int_{0}^{1}f(x)x^{n}dx=0\\end{array} \\)\n\nfor all n in N.
