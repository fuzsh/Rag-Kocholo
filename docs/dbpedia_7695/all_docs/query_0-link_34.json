THE USH AND ABUSE OF THE IONIC THEORY * TWENTY-FIVE years have elapsed since Arrhenius advanced the theory that acids, bases and salts in aqueous solution are dis- sociated into their constituent ions. Now that the storm of contention aroused by this doctine is clearing, it may not be inap- propriate to consider in cooler blood this proposition of Arrhenius, to reinspect the foundations, and to weigh without preju- dice the pros and cons, the successes and failures of the ionic theory. To show that an electrolyte in solution suffers a change analogous to dissociation, Arrhenius brought forward evidence of three different kinds. First, he pointed out that the various methods of deter- mining molal concentration in solution (freezing-point, boiling-point, vapor pres- sure, osmotie pressure), all of which are identical in principle and yield nearly identical results, indicate that in a salt solution the number of molecules dissolved, or less hypothetically the number of mols, is greater than the number calculated from the simple chemical formula of the salt. The second argument rests upon the ob- servation that in an aqueous solution of a strong electrolyte the properties are purely additive. Thus a dilute solution of hydro- chloriec acid has no properties which are peculiarly its own. It tastes sour, turns litmus red, dissolves metals, inverts sugar and possesses a number of other well-known properties, all of which are possessed in some degree by every acid. Moreover, it precipitates silver and mercurous salts, and 1 Address of chairman of the Section of Physical Chemistry, Baltimore, December 29, 1908. 2 SCIENCE exhibits other properties which are found in all chloride solutions. In other words, the solution has no properties which are not included in one of two distinct sets, one possessed by all acids, and one by all chlorides. So it seems natural to regard this solution as a mixture of two sub- stances, hydrogen ion, which is present in all acids, and chloride ion, which is present in all chlorides. To illustrate this additive property let me perform this simple and familiar experiment. Here are two solu- tions in alcohol, one containing cobalt ni- trate, the other an equivalent amount of cobalt chloride. One is red, the other a brilliant blue. On pouring these two into equal large volumes of water, the difference in color disappears and both assume the pink color which is typical of aqueous cobalt solutions. Here again are three cop- per salts, nitrate, chloride and bromide, which in aleohol are respectively blue, green and dark brown, but when poured into equal volumes of water all show the same blue color of the cupric ion. Finally, the third main argument in favor of ionization is derived from the electrical properties of solutions. Some fifty years ago Clausius believed that the conduction of electricity in electrolytes affords sufficient evidence to show a dissociation into ions. Whether or not we accept this proof, which is perhaps a little metaphysical, other experimental facts such as Kohlrausch’s law of the addi- tivity of conductivities at infinite dilutions, the agreement between conclusions drawn from conductivity and transference experi- ments, and the coincidence in the degree of dissociation calculated from conductivity and from freezing point, all give strong support to the theory of ionic dissociation. Unfortunately, some over-enthusiastic advocates of the ionic theory, not content with this solid evidence, have superimposed on the theory other extraneous speculations (N.S. Von. XXX. No. 757 which, when later discredited, have in some quarters brought the parent theory into disrepute. For example, J may mention the dictwm that all chemical reactions in aqueous solutions are ionic in character, a notion which not only is intrinsically im- probable upon theoretical grounds, but has been refuted experimentally by the experi- ments of Kahlenberg and others. Some too zealous ionists have applied the theory to highly concentrated solutions, without making allowances for the deviations from the laws of the perfect solution which are to be expected there. It would be absurd to class as a dilute solution one which is five or ten times molal, yet we see attempts to apply to a pair such as sodium and potassium nitrates the law of solubility lowering which has been obtained for ideal solutions. In justice to the author of the ionic theo- ory, it should be noted that he has had no part in these attempts to stretch the theory beyond its elastic limit. In his papers on this subject, brief as they have been, Ar- rhenius has with great fairness and ex- traordinary acumen stated, as far as our present limited knowledge permits, the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about ionic dissociation. Against the excess of zeal in some advo- cates of the theory may be balanced the dogmatism of others who for a priori rea- sons have declared it absurd that a sub- stance like potassium chloride, bound to- gether presumably by an enormous affinity, could break spontaneously into its constitu- ent parts. Instead of attempting to refute such circular reasoning, let us return rather to the consideration of that experimental material upon which are based the three main arguments for the ionic theory. Here a careful scrutiny reveals facts which, dis- concerting as they may be, no fair advocate of ionic dissociation can afford to ignore. JuLy 2, 1909] The first of these unpleasant facts is that the values for the degree of dissociation of strong electrolytes calculated on the one hand from freezing points, and on the other from conductivities, while usually fairly concordant, frequently differ by an amount far greater than the experimental error. For half normal solutions of lithium chlo- ride, magnesium chloride and calcium fer- rocyanide, the degrees of dissociation cal- culated from the freezing points are 94 per cent., 99 per cent. and 2 per cent., while from conductivities we calculate 71 per cent., 62 per cent. and 20 per cent., respectively. Of course these are moder- ately concentrated solutions and at higher dilutions the discrepancies become less. Moreover, it is not unlikely that the at- tempts to explain such facts, by assump- tions of hydration, association, and the like, may ultimately be successful, but in the meantime these facts can not be neg- lected. In the second place, the additivity of the properties of electrolytic solutions, striking as it is, seems to prove too much. If it is an argument for the dissociation of elec- trolytes, it seems to be an argument for complete dissociation. Why should the properties. of a normal solution of potas- sium chloride be simply those of potassium and chloride ions if, as measurements of conductivity show, it is 25 per cent. undis- sociated? Why should the undissociated part have no individual properties of its own? It is easy to see why completely dissociated acids and bases should give the same heat of neutralization, since we regard this heat as simply due to the union of hydrogen and hydroxide ions, but half- normal potassium and sodium hydroxides give essentially the same heat of neutraliza- tion with an acid, although they are 20 per cent. undissociated. Half-normal barium hydroxide gives the same, although 40-per SCIENCE 3 cent. undissociated. Copper sulphate as dilute as one tenth normal is still more than half undissociated, but its color is nearly the pure color of cupric ion. In- deed in all the strong electrolytes the par- tial volume, heat capacity, internal energy, viscosity, refractive index, rotary power, in fact practically all the significant physical properties of the undissociated part of the electrolyte, seem practically identical with the properties of the constituent ions. If we had no other criterion for the degree of dissociation, these facts would undoubtedly lead us to regard salts, up to a concentra- tion of normal or half normal, as com- pletely dissociated. Finally, the phenomena of electrical con- duction present several puzzling, and as yet unexplained, features. For example, at- tention has recently been called to the in- teresting fact that the two ions which in aqueous solution possess by far the greatest mobility, are the ions of water itself, hydro- gen and hydroxide. This might possibly be regarded as chance if it had not also been found that in other solvents a similar con- dition exists. Thus in methyl alcohol, the methylate ion moves with unusual velocity. To explain this curious fact, it has been suggested that the ions of the solvent have a mode of progress different from that of other ions, due to their ability to pass vir- tually through the molecules of solvent. This view, in a certain sense, requires a return to a modified Grotthus theory, and if accepted, necessitates the conclusion that the process of conduction is not quite so simple as it may have seemed to the orig- inal advocates of the ionic theory. Perhaps the most vulnerable point in the whole armor of the ionist is reached when we attempt to apply the mass law to the dissociation of strong electrolytes. The mass law derived rigorously only for the perfect solution could hardly be expected 4 SCIENCE to be exactly true in the case of actual solutions. We might therefore expect cer- tain small deviations from the mass law, but are in no way prepared for the start- ling discrepancies which are in fact ob- served. This discrepancy is sufficiently marked in the case of salts of the simplest type, like potassium nitrate or sodium chlo- ride, but is most striking in the case of some salts of a higher type. The following table gives for three electrolytes the values of the ‘‘mass law constant’’ (K) at differ- ent molal concentrations (C’). We see that when the concentration changes one thou- sand fold, K changes one hundred fold in the case of potassium chloride and one mil- lion fold in the ease of potassium ferro- eyanide!

To the extremely bizarre conductivity curves there obtained few have had the temerity to apply in full the principles derived from the ionic theory. Neverthe- less, we are beginning to realize that the phenomena of aqueous solutions are but special instances of the widely varying phenomena occurring in other solvents; and it seems unlikely that a satisfactory understanding of the behavior of aqueous solutions can come except through a care- ful study of non-aqueous solutions. At present our quantitative knowledge of such solutions is extremely limited, and does not [N.S. Vou. XXX. No. 757 encourage the belief that we have in any sense a final answer to the problem of solutions. These, then, are some of the weak points of the ionic theory as it stands to-day. If the case were to rest here I am afraid it would be difficult to bring in a verdict for the theory of dissociation. . Indeed many scientists, on the basis of such evidence, have decided to close the hearing and to class the ionic theory with other ingenious hypotheses that have failed to stand the test of experience. But these men have not applied the one criterion by which in the end every scientific proposition must be judged—the test of serviceability. After all, what have we said except that the ionic theory is not complete? But perfection is rare in the science of chemistry. Our sci- entific theories do not, as a rule, spring full-armed from the brow of their creator. They are subject to slow and gradual growth, and we must candidly admit that the ionic theory in its growth has reached the ‘‘awkward age.’’ Instead, however, of judging it according to the standard of perfection, let us simply ask what it has accomplished, and what it may accomplish in scientific service. When we examine a little more critically the unfavorable features which we have mentioned, we find that they enter chiefly in the application of the theory to strong electrolytes. If we consider the weak elec- trolytes, like ammonia, acetic acid and most of the organic substances, of which a large number have been investigated, we find a remarkably satisfactory state of affairs. For these the mass law has generally been shown to hold with remarkable accuracy. Indeed it is hardly too much to say that every prediction from the ionic theory has been quantitatively verified for all the weak electrolytes which have been carefully in- vestigated. The degrees of dissociation ob- Juty 2, 1909] tained in different ways are in complete accord; the properties are additive only just in as far as the electrolytes are ion- ized; the electrical properties seem entirely normal. Here, then, is an enormous field in which the whole theory of Arrhenius may be quantitatively applied, with perfect safety, to a wide variety of problems. Again, in the ease of strong electrolytes at high dilution, the theory of ionic disso- ciation is completely in accord with all known facts. The agreement between transference numbers measured directly and those caleulated from the conductivi- ties at infinite dilution is eminently satis- factory. There can hardly be any question that with increasing dilution the ratio of the molal concentration to that calculated when no dissociation is assumed approaches just two for binary, and just three for ter- nary salts. Is there any other hypothesis which will account for this cardinal fact? Any valid criticism of the ionic theory must, therefore, be based upon its applica- tion to solutions of strong electrolytes at moderately high concentrations. Here the problem is unquestionably one of great dif- fieulty. Even the simple question of de- termining the true degree of dissociation is one which still permits much divergence of opinion. One of the suggestions which has been made to account for some of the anomalies of the strong electrolytes is that, owing to the change in the mobility of the ions with the concentration, the conduct- ivity is not a correct measure of the degree of dissociation. In some cases, especially in the ease of the hydrogen ion, this sup- position has indeed been definitely verified. Yet in the majority of cases it seems very unlikely that we may thus explain the ex- traordinary discrepancies such as those that I have pointed out in the application of the mass law to strong electrolytes. I have shown in another place that while conduct- ivity may not indeed be an absolutely reli- SCIENCE 5 able measure of the concentration of the ions, it furnishes, nevertheless, the only way that we have of determining them. Every other method which has been used gives a measure, not of the real concentra- tion, but rather of the escaping tendency, or activity, which may not in all cases be proportional to the concentration. I be- lieve that we shall make no great error in assuming that the degree of dissociation calculated from the conductivities is in most cases substantially correct and that the lack of fulfilment of the requirements of the mass law for strong electrolytes is due to deviation of one or more of the dissolved substances from the laws of the perfect solution. This assumption is by no means inherently improbable. In fact, in the case of many non-electrolytes we find marked deviations from the ideal laws even at small concentrations. If we must conclude that one of the sub- stances present in a solution of an elec- trolyte is abnormal in its behavior, we are inclined at first to suspect the ions, which on account of their peculiar electrical con- dition might be expected to differ ma- terially from ordinary substances. But this view proves to be untenable. As far aS we can judge, the ions seem to obey, at least to a fair degree of approximation, the laws of the perfect solution, and thus we are forced to place the responsibility for the observed anomalies chiefly upon the un- dissociated part of the electrolyte. The correctness of this idea may be tested by applying the simple laws of solutions to those cases where the properties of the undissociated substances may be eliminated from consideration. Every such test, which our present experimental material permits, substantiates this hypothesis. Thus, for example, when we consider the equilibrium between a dissolved salt and the ions in its saturated solution we need not consider the undissociated portion. Assuming that the 6 SCIENCE ions are normal in behavior, we are led at once to the principle of the constancy of the solubility product, the substantial cor- rectness of which has been demonstrated by the experiments of Noyes, and the more recent work of Stieglitz. An entirely sim- ilar method which depended upon the elim- ination of the undissociated electrolyte was employed by Rothmund in his study of the dissociation of picrie acid. Another deduction which is similarly justified is that the product of the hydro- gen and hydroxide ion concentrations is a constant, in any dilute aqueous solution, and this important constant has been ob- tained by several independent methods, all in excellent agreement. Finally the Nernst equation for the electromotive force of a concentration cell gives very satisfactory results when we consider only the ion con- centrations. If, however, we apply an equation similarly obtained to the undisso- ciated portion of the electrolyte we obtain results which are by no means corroborated by experiment. A few years ago I had occasion to make a calculation which involved simultaneously the application of all the principles which I have just enumerated, the Nernst equa- tion, the solubility product, the dissociation constant of water. By the aid of these it was possible to calculate from the decom- position pressure of silver oxide the poten- tial of the oxygen electrode. The potential thus obtained differed more than one tenth of a volt from the value previously ac- cepted, but was in perfect agreement with the results of the independent investiga- tions published during the same year by Haber and by Nernst. The calculation would obviously have been vitiated if any one of the principles used had been unre- liable. To review the service rendered by these simple generalizations deduced from the ionic theory would be to summarize a very [N.S. Von. XXX. No. 757 considerable part of the exact work in physical chemistry published during the past two decades. In the study of chem- ical equilibrium and reaction velocity, espe- cially in the process of rationalizing quan- titative analysis, these principles are of daily service. While therefore many difficult problems relating to the application of the ionic theory remain to be solved, this theory must even at the present time be regarded as established on a sound working basis. Advance will come through the exact quan- titative study of the properties of aqueous, and especially of non-aqueous, solutions. After this work is completed it is not im- probable that our views of the nature of solutions will be greatly changed, but I venture to predict that the later and better theories will not be substitutes for, but rather developments of, the simple hy- pothesis of Arrhenius. Gingert Newton Lewis MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE or TECHNOLOGY THE COLLEGES OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS * Tue colleges and universities of the United States are social forces of such power that the campaign against tubercu- losis can not ignore them: it needs their help, it seeks to enlist them among its strongest allies. And the campaign is so reasonable, so timely, and already so effi- cient, that it may confidently expect the co- operation of the colleges of the country, as, indeed, it depends on the cooperation of all intelligent men and women interested in the betterment of man. First in importance among the aids which the higher schools are giving is per- haps the investigation of fundamental *Read before the International Congress on Tuberculosis, Washington, D. C. Juny 2, 1909] problems. It is largely in the universities that the problems which come under the cognizance of this section of the congress— problems of hygiene and sanitation, of eco- nomics and sociology—are being solved, and it is here that students of the subject are trained in special methods of research. As examples of various lines of investiga- tion carried on in the higher schools, I may mention the advanced courses in social eco- nomies under Dr. EH. T. Devine, at Colum- bia University, where in 1908 an entire term was devoted to seminar work on the social aspects and control of this disease; the in- vestigations of Professors Fisher, Baily and Farnham, of Yale, in diet and housing im sanatoria, and in the relation of tubercu- losis to labor and tenement conditions; the sociological work at the University of Chicago where students accompany pa- tients of the college dispensary to their homes, together with the regular visiting nurses and physicians and study local con- ditions and surroundings and the methods employed in improving the environment; and the work of the University of Wiscon- sin whose classes from the departments of political economy and sociology visit Mil- waukee to study the social and industrial aspects of the disease. In not a few col- leges students are securing valuable data as to some of the simpler problems of the local fields of the college or of their home towns and counties, such as the number and proportion of deaths from tuberecu- losis, the recurrence of the disease in in- fected houses, the average length of the disease, and its economic losses. From answers to a questionnaire sent to two hun- dred representative higher schools of the United States, it is found that about one fifth are engaged in investigative work in tuberculosis. The higher schools are also furnishing from their faculties not a few men of SCIENCE u knowledge and conviction as leaders in the propaganda. ‘The lists of officers of this congress, of the National Association and of the state leagues and state boards of health show that the colleges are supplying at least their full quota for this purpose. A most effective help which the colleges are giving in the fight is along educational lines. In states where the commonwealth does not furnish lecturers for the educa- tional campaign, the work of arousing and teaching the people from the platform falls largely on the schools. University exten- sion courses, summer chautauquas and more incidental occasions furnish a means of reaching the people which Phillips and Garrison might have coveted in their cam- paign against slavery. The subject of public health receives an interested hear- ing everywhere, and on this theme the col- lege man speaks with an authority and influence enhanced by his institutional re- lations. And to college men the educa- tional campaign makes a specially strong appeal. We can not see the people perish for want of knowledge, knowledge which it happens to be our good fortune to pos- sess, and not be stirred by some missionary zeal to go forth and preach the gospel of sanitation and the salvation which it offers from disease. University extension lec- tures on tuberculosis are now offered by at least fifteen colleges and universities. A still more fruitful field lies within the college walls. In our students we find an exceptional receptivity to new truth. The stolidity of ignorance, unable to apprehend fundamental principles, the inertia of long- fixed habits of thought and will, the preju- dice of financial interests imperiled—none of these obstacles are present in the college. Surely that warm-hearted enthusiasm of youth, easily stirred to noble ends, which in our civil war sent forth to battle the boys of the colleges of North and South 8 SCIENCE alike, may be aroused to serve in a cam- paign whose purpose is not to destroy life but to save it. Some of our colleges are teaching by ex- ample the prophylaxis of the disease in the way of bacterial cleanliness. At Dart- mouth the class rooms, dormitories and chapel are examined every two weeks by the exposure of gelatine plates, and when the number of bacteria which fall on these plates during ten minutes exceeds forty, the rooms are thoroughly disinfected with formaldehyde. Since the adoption of the wholesale method of disinfection the sick- ness among the students has been very markedly reduced, especially those mild forms of disease such as pharyngitis, tonsil- itis, measles and ordinary colds. In a number of schools immediate attention is given to any suspicious cases of incipient tuberculosis. Colleges whose class rooms are well ventilated, which occasionally test them for the proportion of carbon dioxide present, teach the value of fresh air in the most emphatic way. And the schools whose aim is not the making of a few over- specialized athletes, but rather the physical well being, the maximum efficiency of all their students, inspire an ideal of vigorous health which translated into life becomes the best possible prophylaxis against tu- berculosis. Ags a matter of education, as well as for stronger reasons, a number of colleges have prohibited the rooming of students in families afflicted with tuberculosis and in houses where the occurrence of such cases has not been followed with disinfection. Where there are state or municipal regu- lations requiring registration and super- vision of cases and prompt disinfection of houses after death or removal, and where these rules are rigidly enforced, there may be little need of college rules. But the replies to our questionnaire indicate that [N. 8. Vox. XXX. No. 757 such municipal or state regulations obtain in less than half of college towns and in a still smaller number are they effectively enforced. Apparently in the majority of our higher schools no control is exercised on this vital matter. The young student comes to the college town a stranger, utterly ignorant of the sanitary conditions of the houses of the town among which he is to choose his home. Very possibly he is igno- rant of the causes of tuberculosis and sees no danger in joing a family infected with it. He is thus allowed to place his life in hazard without even a remonstrance from those who are supposed to have his physical well being in their charge and who with no ereat difficulty can usually know of the special places which form the ambushes of the disease. The reason why such regula- tions are not more widely made is in part the general exemption of college students from serious diseases. But before this reason is held sufficient, an examination should be made into the mortality from tuberculosis of the younger alumni, a mor- tality which is often high, and which in some instances may possibly be found sig- nificant of conditions in the environment of the college. The following from a cor- respondent in one of the large universities of the middle west may represent the atti- tude of many schools: I believe that there are no faculty regulations at the present time, but the committee on hygiene has considered the matter and expects to inaugu- rate an active campaign in regard to this with the next school year. There has been so little trouble of this sort among university students that the need has not seemed urgent heretofore, but as matter of education I am personally very strongly in favor of it. Among the matters which make for the education of the student as to tuberculosis is the use of the tuberculin test with the dairy cattle kept by agricultural colleges and by a number of schools for the use of JULY 2, 1909] their boarding halls. The regular inspec- tion of such dairy herds, reported by a number of colleges, is a duty so obvious that its neglect will go far to neutralize the most efficient teaching of the class room. Our colleges are using the directest means of enlisting their students in the war against the great white plague. Local anti- tuberculosis societies are organized, as at Radcliffe. Special lectures or courses of lectures are given before student assemblies. At the Rose Polytechnic and at Bryn Mawr such addresses are given by the president. At Vanderbilt University the director of a tuberculosis exhibition held at Nashville was obtained to address the students. At Cornell College, Iowa, the Science Club for four successive years has provided open evening lectures for students and towns- people, securing for this purpose the state bacteriologist, the state lecturer on tubercu- losis and one of the government meat in- spectors from one of the cities of the state as well as physicians and teachers of the town and college. In about one fifth of the 200 representative colleges such lectures are now given before student assemblies. A still larger number of schools give special attention to tuberculosis in the class room. At Dartmouth the physical director gives two or three lectures a year to the freshman class in a course on hygiene. Indiana State University provides instruc- tion on tuberculosis, its causes, results and methods of prevention and cure, in a course of lectures on hygiene given by different members of the faculty and required of all candidates for graduation in the college of liberal arts. Purdue University assigns a large place to the subject in a series of lectures on health and efficiency and Carl- ton College provides for the same in a course on social problems. The propaganda is carried on in many schools in the depart- ments of biology and hygiene, in sociology, SCIENCE 9 domestic science, sanitary engineering, and economics. The University of Wisconsin for several years has given lectures on tu- berculosis in farmers’ courses and before various meetings of teachers. The Univer- sity of Minnesota makes such lectures an integral part in the program of its colleg of education. The recent organization of schools of education in the stronger colleges and universities opens a large field for the propaganda. Colleges and universities now supply the majority of high-school. teachers. To teach the students of the schools of education in the colleges and universities the facts as to tuberculosis is to dissem- inate these facts throughout the secondary schools. To enlist college and university men and women in the great crusade is to draw under the same banner the hundreds of thousands of high-school boys and girls who in the immediate years are to be under their instruction. An educational agency effectively em- ployed in some schools is the circular. The students of the University of Minnesota were recently thoroughly cireularized on the subject under the auspices of the anti- tuberculosis committee of the Associated Charities of Minneapolis. At Syracuse University the students have entered so heartily into the campaign that they re- cently distributed cardboard circulars on tuberculosis printed in five languages to the 25,000 homes of the city. Perhaps less than one half of our higher schools have as yet actively interested themselves in the twentieth century cru- sade. Yet even those replies to our ques- tionnaire which confess a total lack of co- operation in the present are often most encouraging in their promise for the fu- ture. ‘‘It is high time that we devoted some attention to a matter of such vital importance,’’ writes the president of a col- 10 SCIENCE lege of the middle west. And this from a president of one of the state universities: I have to say in humiliation that practically nothing has yet been done in this state and in our institution as to tuberculosis. . . . I am going to take up the matter in the university next year. I regard the movement as one of supreme impor- tance and hope to bear my share in the beneficent cause. What results may we expect from the cooperation of all the colleges when it is once secured? Hach year we shall enlist hundreds of thousands of the best young men and women of the country. We shall obtain through them the cooperation of the secondary schools whose teachers they sup- ply. And as our students go out into every city and town and village in the land to take their places as citizens of excep- tional influence in their communities, we shall secure the cooperation of the leaders of the future. The harvest sown in the college may be some years in ripening, but it is no less sure. In summation let me say that we may reasonably ask the college and university to help us by giving instruction on tubereu- losis in general lectures before student as- semblies and in specific teaching in the class rooms of the social, economic and bio- logic sciences. We may ask for exemplary sanitation of college buildings, for inspec- tion of college herds, and for care over the health of students by regulations securing immunity from house infection and by the early detection of incipient cases of the disease. We may ask for the exertion of effective influence in securing model san- itary conditions in the immediate college environment and for help in promoting the propaganda throughout the state and na- tion in every possible way. W. H. Norton CoRNELL COLLEGE, Iowa [N.S. Von. XXX. No. 757 PROPOSED PUBLICATION OF BULER’S WORKS STRENUOUS efforts are now being made to secure the publication of the complete works of Leonhard Euler (1707-83), one of the most prolific writers of all times on pure and ap- plied mathematics. Euler lived at a time when the differential and integral calculus was still young, and he was most influential in making this powerful instrument of thought more easily available in the various fields of mathematics. The enormous extent of his writings has been a great obstacle in the way of securing a publication of his complete works and has thwarted earlier efforts along this line. From a recent circular issued by the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences, it ap- pears that we may reasonably expect that the publication of this great work will begin at an early date. The following extract from this circular should be of interest: On the initiative of the German Association of Mathematicians, the International Mathematical Congress, meeting at Rome in April, 1908, unani- mously passed the following resolution: “The fourth International Congress of Mathe- maticians, held in Rome, regards the publication of the whole collection of Euler’s works as an undertaking of the greatest importance, both to pure and to applied mathematics. The congress gratefully welcomes the initiative taken by the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences in this matter and expresses the wish that the great work may be carried out by that society in common with the mathematicians of the other nations. The congress begs the International Association of Academies, and more particularly the Berlin and St. Petersburg academies, of which Euler was so preeminent a member, to support the enterprise in question.” Immediately on the adoption of this resolution the representative of the Paris Academy, Mons. G. Darboux, made known that the International Association of Academies had discussed the Euler question at Vienna in the preceding year, and had expressed entire sympathy with the movement. The correspondence which has since taken place between the president of the Swiss Euler Com- mittee and Mons. Darboux, as also with Herr Lindemann, who had aroused interest in the matter in Vienna, leads us to hope that the sup- port of the Association of Academies will be Jory 2, 1909] accorded to the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences, as desired at the congress in Rome. At its annual meeting, on August 30, 1908, the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences passed the following resolution, proposed by the Central Committee: §1. The Swiss Society of Natural Sciences is willing to publish a complete edition of Leonhard Huler’s works, on condition that this undertaking be adequately supported by the government au- thorities of the Swiss Confederation and of the cantons, as well as by learned bodies and scien- tists, both at home and abroad, and that the scientific cooperation required for its accomplish- ment be forthcoming. §2. The Swiss Society of Natural Sciences en- trusts to the Euler Committee in cooperation with the Central Committee the execution of all pre- liminary work. § 3. On the conclusion of the preliminary work a further resolution on the part of the society will be necessary before proceeding to publication. To §2 some special remarks were added, the last of which demanded “the creation of a fund, by means of private contributions and subscrip- tions, for the eventual publication of Huler’s works.” The Central Committee and the Euler Com- mittee of the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences heve always regarded it as a matter of course that the collection of voluntary contributions should begin in Euler’s native land. And we are pleased to be able to announce that this idea has been cordially seconded in all parts of Switzer- land. The list is not yet closed, but the subscrip- tion will most probably reach the amount of 100,000 franes ($20,000). We accordingly con- sider ourselves justified in turning now to other countries for their support. Two distinguished scientific bodies have already set a praiseworthy example in this direction. In September, 1908, the German Association of Mathematicians decided at their annual meeting at Cologne to hand over 5,000 francs to the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences for the publication of Euler’s works. This amount is of great signifi- cance when we add that the German Association of Mathematicians was thus devoting one third of all its available funds to the object in question. The resolution unanimously proposed by the managing committee and warmly recommended by the chairman, Professor Dr. Felix Klein, was ac- cepted by the Cologne meeting in a spirit of noble enthusiasm, unanimously and without discussion. SCIENCE 11 The wording of the reasons given for the motion deserves special notice: “In consideration of the great importance of Euler’s ever-fresh works to the whole field of mathematical science, the German Association of Mathematicians hereby declares its readiness to actively support the publication of Euler’s works as proposed by the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences and the asso- ciation places at the disposal of the above-named society the sum of 5,000 franes to be taken from the funds of the association.” Further, in January last, the Paris Academy resolved to subscribe for 40 copies of the Euler edition (payable on receipt of each volume), on condition that it should appear in the original languages. This condition has been recently de- clared agreed to by the Swiss Euler Committee. The entire cost of the Euler edition as planned has been estimated, after careful calculation and information received from competent firms, at 400,000 frances ($80,000), against which we may place at least 150,000 frances receipts from the sale of the books. If, as we confidently hope, the example of the Paris Academy is followed, and subscriptions come in in sufficient number, the financial effect would, of course, be more favorable. We therefore now appeal to the mathematicians in every quarter of the globe and to all friends of the mathematical sciences for support and coopera- tion. We request them earnestly to procure for us as quickly as possible the subscriptions necessary for carrying out the enterprise, urging especially scientific libraries to become subscribers. The Euler edition will consist of about 40 volumes, and the price per volume will not exceed 25 franes ($5). The yearly expenditure will be thus comparatively insignificant, even if several volumes should ap- pear in the course of the twelvemonth. And surely every mathematician will in future all the more insist on finding Euler’s works in any library to which he has recourse, as at present these works are rarely to be met with, particularly in newer libraries, for example in America. We further appeal to all the great mathemat- ical associations to follow the example of the German Mathematical Association. At the same time, we beg their members to arrange the collec- tion of voluntary contributions. As in Switzer- land, so surely in other countries, the insurance companies, the more important technical societies, especially those of civil engineers, and such ex- tensive industrial concerns as are based on mathe- matical-technical science, will be ready to coop- erate for the success of our undertaking. For are 12 SCIENCE not Euler’s works to be classed amongst the greatest of all ages, not only on the subject of pure mathematics, but also for their manifold technical applications! We are hopeful that our appeal will meet with that interest on the part of all mathematicians which a complete edition of Euler’s works may justly claim. So much preparatory work has already been done that it needs now but a com- paratively slight effort from individuals and from scientific associations to insure the success of our great plan, the publication of Euler’s works! This appeal is signed by the presidents of the central committee and the Euler com- mittee of the Swiss Society of Natural Sci- ences. Subscriptions may be sent to Professor F. Rudio, Dolderstrasse 111, Zurich YV., Switzerland. G. A. Minter REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO VISIT THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY To the Board of Overseers of Harvard Col- lege: The committee wish to report that they visited the museum on April 29, and were re- ceived by Mr. Agassiz, the director, and by Mr. Henshaw, the curator, under whose aus- pices an inspection of the collections of the museum was made. A walk through the museum can not fail to impress the observer with the careful fore- thought for great simplicity and security of construction, and the thoroughly scientific ar- rangement and handling of the vast collec- tions therein contained. The architectural arrangement of the various departments is of the simplest character, and one can not but be impressed with the high degree of scientific accuracy displayed everywhere. The material on exhibition forms but a small part of the whole collection—more than two thirds of the specimens being stored for the purpose of scientific study. Among these are many great special collections—for instance, those of the Brazilian Expedition of Professor Louis Agas- siz, and those of the numerous dredging ex- peditions of Mr. Alexander Agassiz, which have been the subject of classic memoirs. Among the recent acquisitions of the mu- seum which have already been described in [N.S. Vou. XXX. No. 757 previous reports, is the large model of the Bora-Bora coral reefs, which has been ecare- fully prepared under the direction of Mr. Agassiz, and is now cased in the museum. It serves in its own way to commemorate the extensive and fruitful investigations into coral reef formation which he has made during recent years. There are at present more than 45,000 vol- umes in the library, which, owing to its scien- tific value, has become one of Harvard’s great possessions. Jt is eagerly sought out and con- sulted by students and masters in several de- partments of science, and not from Harvard alone, but from the whole United States and Canada. This great growth has made it nec- essary to place the books in stacks, and owing to this somewhat compact arrangement, the facilities for consulting the books are not so convenient as they would be if provision could be made for a more perfect system of artificial illumination. With the growth of the museum, the need of a number of expert assistants in the preparation and mounting of specimens has been felt. The first need to which we call attention would not involve great increase in the ex- penditures, but the second is a large item. As the resources of the museum and the director’s private generosity are already taxed to the ut- most, it rests with the university itself, or with the public, rather than with the museum, to bear this additional burden. Your com- mittee feel strongly that the university should assume it. It is appropriate on this occasion to call at- tention to the fact that this year marks the semi-centennial of the establishment of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. On April 2, 1859, the legislature of Massachusetts voted that the sum of $100,000 should be granted to the Museum of Comparative Zoology. In June, 1859, articles of agreement were made and executed between the trustees of the museum and the president and fellows of Harvard College. A piece of land about five acres in extent was deeded by the corporation to the museum, for the purpose of erecting a JULY 2, 1909] fireproof building. The laying of the corner- -stone took place with appropriate ceremonies on June 14,1859. The formal establishment of the museum took place in October of the same year, by the presentation of Professor Agassiz’s collections to the trustees. The foundation was placed at first in the hands of a body of trustees appointed by the state, and it was not until 1875 that the museum was turned over and placed perma- nently in charge of the corporation of the university. A small and lonely looking brick block which was erected at this time, with its four rooms to the floor, has grown nearly continu- ously around three sides of the great square originally laid out for it. A second section of the museum was soon added to the first, in 1871-2, and further additions were made in 1877, and again in 1880-2, and it was not until 1888-9 and 1901-2 that the last portions of the museum were finally added. The depart- ments of botany and mineralogy and geology which have been added from time to time, and the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology—the building of which was begun in 1876—form portions of the present struc- ture now known as the university museum, of which the Museum for Comparative Zoology forms the major part. The university museum contains thirty-two rooms in its ground plan, and is by far the largest building of the university. Nor is it an empty shell—it barely serves to house its treasures and the students thereof. A glance at the plans of this building shows what grand results have been accomplished in a half-century’s work, and what has fol- lowed from the inspiration of a great teacher. Intellectually, the institution has grown from the daring experiment of a great enthusiast to an important position among the leaders of the world’s museums and laboratories. It is doubtful if any department of the university has brought home to it from the old world more fame, or if any department has done more enduring work for time to come. It is well to recall these historical memoirs on this occasion, and it must never be for- SCLENCE 13 gotten that such progress and development would have been impossible without the life- time devotion of two very remarkable men— father and son. One is gone; in his life and death he has had great praise. He deserved it, and the university should ever commemo- rate him. One is with us; we should not wait until he is gone to give praise to him. He is a major benefactor to the university, and a great figure in her history. To him the uni- versity owes not only a lavish fortune spent in her service, but much more than this—the lifework of a great administrator, and a great scientific man. Your committee, therefore, are unanimously of the opinion that this fiftieth anniversary of the Museum of Comparative Zoology should be fittingly celebrated by the whole university, and, further, that no celebration could be so fitting as one which would evince the univer- sity’s admiration of the scholar and the man —Alexander Agassiz. It strongly recom- mends, therefore, to your board timely and positive steps in this direction, and tenders its services if desired for more concrete sugges- tions or consultation. J.

JuLy 2, 1909] Dr. Santiago Rory, of the La Plata Mu- seum, Argentina, has accepted membership on the International Correlation Committee of the National Academy of Sciences. The object of this committee is to obtain data for a better correlation of the geological succes- sion in different parts of the world, a matter in which there is at present wide diversity of opinion. Dr. Roth will contribute especially upon the Mesozoic and Cenozoic formations of the Argentine Republic. At the commencement exercises of the med- ical department of the University of North Carolina, Dr. William H. Welch, of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, delivered the address. Dr. Welch has now sailed for Europe. A staTUE in honor of Theodor Swann, the physiologist, has been erected at Neusz where he was born. Proressor Cart N. I. Borcen, for thirty- four years director of the Imperial Observa- tory at Wilhelmshaven, has died at the age of sixty-six. Dr. Maria Aristipes Brezina, formerly director of the mineralogical department of the Imperial Vienna Museum, died in Vienna on May 25, after a long illness, in the sixty- second year of his age. Dr. Brezina was one of the most brilliant and thorough of the European mineralogists. He devoted the latter part of his life to the study of meteor- ites and he created a vast amount of im- portant literature on the subject, incidentally making the meteoric collection in the Imper- jal Museum in Vienna the most complete in existence. The mineralogical collections prospered under his direction; indeed, the Viennese collections were for many years the leading ones in Europe. Dr. Brezina leaves a wife, two daughters and a sister.

No, 757 DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE JOINT MEETINGS OF ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETIES To tHE Epiror or Scimnce: There has been brought to my attention much severe criticism of the fact that at the recent Baltimore meet- ing Section F held meetings parallel with those of the American Society of Zoologists; and many of these criticisms are in such a form as to suggest that the officers of Section F deliberately planned that conflicting ar- rangement. Such is not the case. The offi- cers then responsible for Section F were also members of the American Society of Zoolo- gists and therefore were especially anxious to avoid conflicting meetings. For some weeks preceding the meeting, the secretaries of the American Society of Zoologists and Section F carried on correspondence looking towards a joint program, with the exception of the vice- presidential address before Section F. In the last days before publication of programs, it suddenly became evident that the large num- ber of papers submitted made a joint two-day program as planned impossible, and there was no time for considering possible rearrange- ments of plan. The problems of conflicting meetings have now been more carefully considered by the sectional committee of Section F; and with the hope of leading to better organized zoolog- ical meetings, with grouping of papers into natural subdivisions and perhaps sectional meetings when necessary in order to complete the program of papers in two or three days, the committee has voted that if the American Society of Zoologists goes to Boston next De- cember Section F will propose limiting its meetings to the vice-presidential address and business, and leave to the American Society of Zoologists entire charge of the meetings for the reading of zoological papers. Such a proposition has been transmitted to the secre- tary of the American Society of Zoologists for reference to the executive committee of that society. The writer has heard only one line of objec- tion to the general plan of this proposition, namely, that Section F has among its mem- bers several hundred who are not eligible to JuLy 2, 1909] membership in the American Society of Zool- ogists. This is true and is one of the strong- est reasons for the existence of Section F as an organization independent of the American Society of Zoologists. However, so far as ex- perience at meetings in recent years goes, this large membership of Section F has no impor- tant bearing on the question of a consolidated program of papers under the auspices of the American Society of Zoologists. There have probably not been a half dozen papers read before Section F in the past three years by authors who were not also members of the American Society of Zoologists or who could not have obtained an introduction to that society for the reading of their papers. More- over, the sectional committee of Section F has constitutional authority for rejecting papers not satisfactory in preliminary abstracts; and since the members of that committee are also members of the American Society of Zoolo- gists there is no reason to suppose that an irresponsible member of Section F could get an opportunity to read a paper in a consoli- dated program with the American Society of Zoologists. A second objection is that the large audi- ences composed of members of Section F in- hibits discussion and as a result zoological meetings are not so helpful as they were years ago. This is absurd to one who observed the record-breaking run of papers made by the American Society of Zoologists at Baltimore on the days when Section F held its own meet- ings. It is evident that the American Society of Zoologists has already overgrown in scope, in membership and in productivity of mem- bers; and soon must consider some natural subdivision in order to gain the time for the © deliberate work which was once so satisfactory. It is true, as charged by certain members of the American Society of Zoologists, that the majority of papers read before Section F are by the younger group of zoologists. But may not these men just entering the zoological field have some right to the inspiration and criti- cism derivable from reading papers before a body of older zoologists? Have those who object to the reading of papers by the younger SCIENCE ile men forgotten that ten or twenty years ago they too were just emerging from the graduate schools and were eager to present their re- search work? The need of an opportunity for those not yet eligible to membership in the American Society of Zoologists is alone suffi- cient justification for regular programs of Section F whenever the American Society of Zoologists does not adopt some such grouping of papers and parallel sectional meetings as will permit the reading of all zoological papers worthy of serious consideration. If the offi- cers of the American Society of Zoologists are willing to make such an arrangement, the present officers of Section F will cooperate fully in the selection of papers offered by members of Section F who are not also mem- bers of the American Society of Zoologists, and after that will leave the programs for reading of papers entirely under the auspices of the officers of the American Society of Zool- ogists. But if such a consolidation is not acceptable to the American Society of Zool- ogists, the officers of Section F will continue to consider it their duty to arrange otherwise for the reading of worthy papers by men who do not have an opportunity to present results of their research before the American Society of Zoologists. Maurice A. BicELow, Secretary of Section F TEACHERS COLLEGE, CoLuMBIA UNIVERSITY THE BIRTHPLACES OF LEADING AMERICANS AND THE QUESTION OF HEREDITY Iy Sciences, April 9, I challenged the fol- lowing statement of Mr. W. J. Spillman: With only 29 per cent. of our population actu- ally living on the farm, with miserably poor school facilities as compared with our city population, this 29 per cent. furnishes about 70 per cent. of the leaders in every phase of activity in this country. In Somner, May 7, Mr. Spillman corrects his 29 per cent. to about 36 per cent. He admits that he has “no way of ascertaining how many of the men who are distinctly lead- ers in this country were actually brought up 18 SCIENCE on the farm.” . He also says he merely re- peated a statement he had heard frequently and which he had never heard challenged. Mr. Spillman, however, doubts the signifi- cance of the facts which I presented in Sct- ENcE, April 9, drawn from “Who’s Who in America” showing that centers of population of 8,000 and over have produced about twice their expected ratio of persons included in this volume. I do not myself claim that these figures give a final refutation to the belief which Mr. Spillman holds, that there is a special value to be assigned to life on a farm during early boyhood, but there appears to be certainly no evidence at present to support such a view. Future investigation may show that the farms give a higher ratio than the small towns and villages, but the inference from such data as we have is in favor of concen- trated centers of population against sparsely settled regions in general. This idea must stand until special researches show that it does not apply to towns and villages against farms. In any event, the actual farms have probably produced much less than 70 per cent. of the total leaders of the present day, since 30 per cent. are found from the cities alone, and this would leave nothing for the towns and villages. Mr. Spillman’s second letter contains so much that requires discussion or correction that I am forced to quote nearly the entire article, taking the points up one at a time. Although I thank him for his complimen- tary references to my study of heredity in royalty, still I am sorry that he has introduced this more complicated discussion just here. But since in the first part of his article he has done so, I would like to correct one or two misinterpretations of my position on the question of environment versus heredity. Mr. Spillman says: I have only one criticism of Dr. Woods’s reason- ing. In studying heredity in royalty he purposely chose this class because it could be assumed that their characters were formed under the most uni- form environment, which purpose was of course entirely legitimate. This was really not my purpose in choosing royalty as a basis of study; and, furthermore, [N.S. Vou. XXX. No. 757 I do not think that their characters were formed under a uniform environment. I have found in studying their lives the greatest variation in their environments, all the way from the supposed advantages of a wholesome family life, with famous tutors to give them learning, or the call of warfare to grant op- portunity, down to the foul atmosphere of some Bourbon court, or the mouldering walls of a prison cell. On all this I have dwelt in the same book which Mr. Spillman here alludes to. On page 9 I say: Although all have the highest social rank, they have lived in different countries, in different cen- turies, and under varying circumstances, with different educations and opportunities. The same theme is expressed more fully on page 284, and occurs here and there through- out the whole work. Mr. Spillman goes on to say: But it must be remembered that this [royal"
