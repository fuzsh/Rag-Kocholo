In offering this argument now for publication, I throw down the gauntlet to the whole philosophic world, espedaXLy to Prof. Ernst Haeckel of Jena, whose recent famous publication briefly sums up the pronouncements of nineteenth century science on the opposite side. To me it has always seemed that there is absolutely no escape from the conclusion that consciousness — or the con- scious principle in man and animals — actually does, ever and again, originate energy. There are two main steps in the argument by which this theory is established. I. Mind directs the motions of matter. This theoiv has been di^^puted by some leading inlcllccis, more scien- tists than philosophers, notably Professor Huxley, who boldly maintained that the mind was a mere spectator of all that occurred around it, and was powerless to interfere. To others, such as Tyndall, the problem has remained a ENERGY. Digitize^! by Google 2 THE MONIST, Standing puzzle. But I think most are now gradually com- ing round to the view that mind does direct the motioas of matter. And perhaps what has chiefly led to this is, that without this theory there seems to be no foundation for the ethical idea— ethics ceases to be a science. If all movements are determined by purely mechanical or ph3rs- ical causes there is no room for any question of rig-ht or wrong. If ail the internal and external movements of animal bodies were entirely independent of amsciousness, and wnmld go on just the same if consciousness were not involved, then there is an end of all moral responsibility. Of course this is only an indirect argument. And I think there is no direct proof of the theory. We can only argue, \"for if not, if it be possible, suppose that consciousness does not direct motion,\" and then see if the alternative conclusions thus presented are such as we can swallow. The disappearance of the distinction between right and wrong is one of the first conclusions. Possibly two or three logical fanatics might be found who would not stick even at this. But I think it safe to say that there is not the smallest possibility of any such theory ever becoming more than a curiosity. Another indirect argument is simply this — can we pos- sibly believe that all that has ever happened and is happen- ing among conscious beings in this world, would have happened and would go on happening exactly the same, if consciousness was not and never had been present. If ani- mals were unconscious creatures would the daily and yearly events of their lives be exactly the same? You can't prove that they would not be by Barbara or by any- tliing else. But tiie fact remains that the alternative con- clusion is absurd — what then would be the function of consciousness, what the use of it ? None I Well you would never get anybody but a few logical monomaniacs to be- lieve that Digiiiztxi by WILL-FORCE. 3 The direct argument is not conclusive. And yet per- haps it is as conclusive as the indirect one. The direct argument is simply — All conscious beings are conscious of controlling events; if this conscionsness has no founda* tion in fact, how do you explain it? And the answer Is that it is quite capati^e of explanation. So lon^ as that which happens is that which we desire, \\vc infer that it is our desire that has brought it about; when it is not what we want, we attribute it to external causes. But I think there is an answer to that Reckoning numerically, the vast majority of all the movements of the body which are accompanied by consciousness are just what we desire — unless a man be diseased by paralysis or drunkenness, or catalepsy, or something of that sort, his amis and legs never fail to do the hundreds of little things that he is continually wanting them to do, all day long. But, it wmII be said, our actions are the result of in- grained habit — the result of certain tendencies inherent in the physical constitution of the body. And our sense of desiring them is really merely the sense of pleasure that comes from doing what our bodies are especially made to do— 4hc sense of pleasure that always more or less forms part of the performance of any natural and healthy func- tion, or even sometimes of morbid activities that have be- come habitual. But that argument can easily be met. Let us rigidly exclude any and all activities that are habitual. Let us select any actions quite arbitrarily — actions, not activities. Think for a moment — \"I will move my arm or leg, this way or that,*' and you find you can do it. Can we possibly attribute each one of these instances to a mere coincidence that the motion of the arm or the leg happened to occiu: just at the same time as the desire for that motion?. . . , Really I think this is the strongest argument of all. It is not the direct argument with which we started The direct Digitize^! by Google 4 THE KONIST. argument, \"I desire this movement — this movement oc curs — therefore my desire is the cause of it\" — ^may be said to have failed. Because, theoretically, there is an alter- native conclusion. But that alternative conclusion pres- ents, surely, the biggest indirect argument — the strongest reducHo ad absurdum^^UhBt it would be possible to find anywhere. If there is a stage at which the probabOities of the indirect form of argument become as good as the certainties of a direct one, it is surely here. The reply, if any, could only be, that it is only throiig-h illusion that the movement appears to follow the desire; and that, as a matter of fact, it is the desire that follows the movement — the desire being, really, a mere conscious- ness of and pleased acquiescence in tht movement But then, I say, try the experiment as often as you like; deter- mine on the movement a measurable time beforehand, so as to be sure that it is the movement that follows the de- sire, and not vice versa. To which you might perhaps reply, \"Again illusion. The desire which appeared to you to determine the movement, was really itself determined by the same unseen, internal, previous causes, which de- termined the movement.\" — Well it is a conclusive answer to that argument, if, instead of trying to pre-determine the movement yourself, you let someliody else determine it for you. That etiectually eUniiiiates all possibility of illusion. Physiological causes internal in you could not have deter- mined in the other person's mind the choice of what move- ment you should make. But besides all that — even when you pre-determine the movement yourself, why suppose illusion? The evi- dence of our senses is all that we ever have about anything at all. And generally speaking we think it right to accept it You must then have some especial reason in this case for imagining that there is illusion at work.

And that reason is the conservation of energy. That mind can direct the motions of matter appears to you to be the contrary to the theory of the conservation of en- ergy; hence your obstinate objection to the theory of the conscious control of motion. Now thb theory of the conservation of energy is an in- vention of the day before yesterday. And yet all you scien- tists will accept any alternative however extraordinary, rather than gi\\ e it up. You will deny the existence of moral responsibility, and you will believe that all conscious beings are mere machines, and that consciousness is without any function or use in life, which could get on just as well without it, and you will reject the daily experiences of all mankind from ihe earliest times up to now, and will tax your brains to invent all kinds of extraordinary hypotheses to provide a way out of the difikiilties that yon vourselves have created out of your adherence to this pet new theory, rather than allow this one exception to it Such is the pride of intellect! If anything had to go to the wall, it would be this new- fangled theory of the conservation of energy. But I will show later on that you may still keep your theory if you like, though in a somewhat modified form, and may admit the plain evidence of your senses as well. I think, however, as I said, that the opinion that mind directs the movements of matter, is steadily gaining ad- herence among men of science to-day. They do not give up the conservation of energy; but they try all sorts of intellectual gymnastics to try and reconcile the two the- ories.* I hope to make the feat an easier one for them. Meanwhile, after what I have said, I think we are justified * Sec Prof. Lloyd Morgan in the October number of 7 he Monist for 1896, m an article on \"Animal Automatism and Consciousness, \" about which Uie len wA the better. Digitized by Google 6 THE MONIST. in taking the fonner theory as practically proved. Mind directs the movements of matter. Now for the next step. How does it do so? Here I issue my challenge : 2. There is one very evident, and very simple way, in which, we can easily see, that mind might direct the move- ments of matter. Suppose a certain single, simple movement of a certain material body has been completely pre-determined by cer- tain mechanical causes — that is, by certain previous move- ments of that and other material bodies ; and suppose that after this material body has started on its mechanically predetermined career, some conscious being observing the event suddenly perceives that, from a human point of view, it is a matter of tremendous importance that the motion of that particular material body should receive a certain particular change in direction. What then is the role of consciousness? How can it interfere to avert the mechan- ically predetermined result, or, to bring about a result predetermined in consciousness. Some, second, additional, different motion must be added to the motion of"
