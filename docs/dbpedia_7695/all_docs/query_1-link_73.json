She recruited a second mathematician from Cambridge for the Bryn Mawr faculty in 1887 and a third in 1903. In 1900 she attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris and wrote a twenty-two-page report that appeared in the AMS Bulletin.30 She persuaded a young couple, Bertrand and Alys Russell, then not widely known, to visit the United States in 1896 and to spend a few weeks lecturing at Bryn Mawr. “With their markedly unconventional statements, radical theories, and probing questions, they set the college, and in particular, the trustees, by the ears.”31 In 1922 her former students arranged a dinner in her honor on the Bryn Mawr campus. Over 200 people attended, many traveling long distances to give a brief speech of recognition. Alfred North Whitehead made a special trip to the United States to attend. A short quote from his featured speech provides an appropriate conclusion to this story: A friendship of peoples is the outcome of personal relations. A life’s work such as that of Professor Charlotte Angas Scott is worth more to the world than many anxious efforts of diplomatists. She is a great example of the universal brotherhood of civilization.32 Sonia Kovalevsky LINDA KEEN Sonia Kovalevsky, 1850–1891. Based on “Sonya Kowaleskaya—Her Life and Work,” a talk at the panel “History of Women in Mathematics,” moderated by Lenore Blum, 1976 Summer JMM, as reported in the AWM Newsletter 7(2), 1977, 2–6. Keen was then a professor of mathematics, Lehman College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, where she is now a professor of mathematics and computer science. Sonia Kovalevsky was born in Russia in 1850. During her teens she began to develop various intellectual interests, but the idea of a learned woman was abhorrent to her father. When he was told she was particularly good in algebra, her algebra book was taken away. However, she was able to reacquire the book and continued to read it secretly at night. Both she and her older sister very much desired to obtain university educations for themselves but felt it was impossible; Russian universities 52 KEEN 30.

On a visit to Petersburg, Sonia’s sister Anyuta heard of a way to do so. They would try to arrange, with the help of some intellectual friends, “fictitious marriages,” that is, marriages in name only that would, however, free them from legal ties to their parents. In 1868, Anyuta was introduced to a young geology student, Vladimir Kovalevsky, who was willing to marry her. However, that year he married Sonia instead. When they arrived in Heidelberg, Sonia was shocked to discover that it was not easy for women to study at the university and that, in fact, they were barred from matriculating. After enormous effort, she received permission to audit lectures without matriculating. The next three semesters were among the happiest of her life. During this period Sonia decided that she wanted to devote herself entirely to mathematics, and that there was only one man with whom she wanted to study, Karl Weierstrass at the University of Berlin. Weierstrass took her as a private pupil. In 1874 Sonia finished three articles, any one of which, Weierstrass claimed, would make a fine doctoral dissertation. The problem was to obtain a degree for her. Eventually Göttingen agreed to award her a doctorate in absentia. After receiving her degree, Sonia and her husband decided to go back to Russia to live and to turn their fictitious marriage into a real one. Her daughter was born in October 1878. Sonia became unsatisfied and unhappy and decided to return to mathematics. Her husband committed suicide, after which Mittag-Leffler helped her obtain a position at the University of Stockholm in 1883. She was made professor for life in 1889. She died in 1891 and was buried in Sweden. She was finally honored by the Russian government on the centenary of her birth. References 1. K. R. Biermann, “Karl Weierstrass,” Journal für die..."
