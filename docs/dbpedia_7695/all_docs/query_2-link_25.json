It contains mainly papers published in Kaljulaid’s lifetime. Many of them were originally written in Russian, a few also in Estonian, and have now been translated into English, mainly, by one of us, J. Peetre1.\n\nHeritage. In addition to this published material, Kaljulaid left a large number of manuscripts in various states of completion. They are currently in the custody of the Senior Editor. For instance, there is an almost complete paper on right order groups, surveying the subject in its historical development, starting with D. Hilbert; some material on Petri nets, etc., things that, apparently, occupied Kaljulaid in his last years. Hopefully, part of it can also be made public, at a later stage, perhaps in the form of Selecta II. Let us now highlight some of the main items of the present Volume. Contents. We offer here the English translation of Kaljulaid’s 1979 Tartu/Minsk Candidate thesis [K79a], which originally was typewritten in Russian and manufactured in not so many copies. The thesis was devoted to representation theory in the spirit of his thesis advisor B. I. Plotkin: representations of semigroups and algebras, especially extension to this situation, and application of the notion of triangular product of representations for groups introduced by Plotkin. We include also two summaries of the thesis [K77a] and [K79b]. Through representation theory, Kaljulaid became also interested in automata theory, which at a later phase became his main area of interest. Another ﬁeld of research concerns combinatorics. Besides being an outstanding and most dedicated mathematician Uno Kaljulaid was also very much interested in the history of mathematics. In particular, he took a vivid interest in the life and work of the great 19th century Dorpat-Tartu algebraist Th. Molien (see Chapter V). Perhaps he saw in Molien a kindred soul, as neither of the two got quite the recognition from their Alma Mater, which they for sure deserved; in Molien’s case, he had to go into voluntary exile in Tomsk, Siberia. Kaljulaid was also very interested in the teaching and exposition, or popularization of mathematics; he had several outstanding research students. Some of his more popular-scientiﬁc papers were published in an Estonian language journal Matemaatika ja Kaasaeg (Mathematics and Our Age). Amongst there is a whole series of papers about algebraic matters, culminating in a brilliant, elementary – although partly rather philosophical – essay devoted to Galois theory [K75a]. Another such series is his excellent essay of Diophantine Geometry [K68a,69b], in various installments, followed by his éloge [K68b] to another of his teachers Yu. I. Manin. We believe that the inclusion of these papers here will make the Volume more interesting for beginners, and perhaps even contribute to attracting young people to mathematics, in Estonia and elsewhere. 1Later on referred to as Senior Editor.\n\nviii\n\nPREFACE\n\nPresentation. The papers in the Volume are assembled in chapters according to the theme. Important matters or notions have often, with some consequence, been set in italics, sometimes upon their ﬁrst appearance, or else where they are deﬁned. Rather rare quotes in other languages than English are usually followed by a translation within parentheses. References to items of Uno Kaljulaid come in the form [Kx], where x (a year) is taken modulo 1900, and refer to the bibliography. References to other mathematicians come in the form [y], where y runs through 1, 2, 3 . . . , independently in each separate paper. In case of books translated into Russian, the Russian translation is often indicated, along with the original for the beneﬁt of the Readers reading Russian or having access to the Russian book. In transliterating the Cyrillic into English we use, with some consequence, the system in Mathematical Reviews, as set forth on p. 1–2 of the book [1]. Some facts about Estonia and Estonian mathematics. It should perhaps also be recalled here that Estonia is the northern most of the three Baltic Republics, facing the Finnish Gulf in the north, bordering to Latvia in the south and to Russia in the East. Its population is about 1.3 million, most of them Estonians, many living in the capital Tallinn; there is also a large Russian speaking minority. The Estonians speak a language somewhat afﬁned to Finnish and not at all related to the language of their southern neighbors the Latvians and the Lithuanians. Estonians were mentioned already by the Roman writer Tacitus (c. 55–117) who spoke of them as the Aestorum gentes. However, around the beginning of the 13th century the Estonians were still among those few people in Europe who had not accepted Christianity. In a devastating war (1208–1227), against German, Swedish and Danish Crusaders, the new religion was forced upon them. The last stronghold of the Estonians, the Castle of Valjala on the island of Saaremaa, was conquered by a Crusader’s army, coming from Pärnu and marching over the frozen archipelago, in February, 1227. Then the Estonians became united, together with the Latvians, in a state ruled by the Order of the Brethren of the Sword, later known as the Teutonic Order, while the native population came to live, for centuries, in serfdom. The rule of the Order lasted until mid 16th century. At later times, Estonia was governed, alternatingly, by Swedes, Poles, and Russians. The situation of the indigenous deteriorated ever more and was particularly low towards the end of the 18th century, farmers were freely sold to the highest bidding landowner; one could even draw a parallel to the Belgian Congo at a much later epoch. However, in the mid of the 19th century a national awakening took place. After hard struggles, the Estonians managed to form an independent country of their own in 1918–20, in the aftermath of World War, when all empires collapsed, the Russian one included. In the advent of the Molotov-Ribbentrop treaty in August, 1939 it was annexed by the Soviet Union in June, 1940, and regained its independence in 1991, during the fall of the Soviet empire. For more details about the above, and also some information about mathematics in Estonia until 1940, with a tradition going back to the Academia Gustaviana in Tartu, founded by the Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus in 1632, closed down in 1656, when the city was captured by the Russians, and then followed by the Academia Carolina\n\nPREFACE\n\nix\n\n(1690–1710)2, we refer to an article by Ülo Lumiste, nestor of Estonian mathematicians, in the book [2]. After a long interregnum the university was reopened in 1802, under the auspices of czar Alexander I; Estonia was now a part of the Russian Empire, the university’s ofﬁcial name being Kaiserliche Universität zu Dorpat, as the language of teaching was German.\n\nAcknowledgements.

Peetre\n\nThe following is mainly drawn from Uno Kaljulaid’s own curriculum vitae along with my personal recollections, as well as information obtained from his daughter Mrs. Annika Tallinn, and some other persons. Uno Kaljulaid was born on October 21, 1941 in Kõpu3 in the district of Viljandi in south-western Estonia.\n\nPrimary education. In primary school in Kõpu Uno was supposedly a naughty boy, but he had never any problems in learning. Once even a question was raised of sending him to a special school. After ﬁnishing primary school his father, Elmar Kaljulaid wanted him to become a tractor driver, but a relative (the husband of Uno’s sister) took care of him and so Uno moved to Pärnu, a nearby famous seaside resort on the Eastern side of the Riga bay.\n\nSecondary education. So his secondary education young Uno got in Pärnu. He graduated the Pärnu First High School in 1959. But even after Uno still did return to Kõpu. In summer time he used to help his mother with haymaking. But his great hobby was to go and pick cranberries in the swamps and morasses – a great part of Estonia consists of morasses. Early in the morning off he went on his moped and returned only by midnight, when everybody at home already was worried about him. But each time his rucksack was crammed with berries. In Kõpu he also wrote many of his mathematical papers, a special room having been prepared as an ofﬁce for him. After the death of his parents, however, the farm was sold. Then Uno began to spend his summers in Pärnu, where he rented a room in a house in Toominga (Wild Cherry) Street at the beach area. He liked the arrangement very much and spent at least ﬁve years there. Academic career. Uno Kaljulaid studied at Tartu University 1959–1963. But already in 1959, prior to his entering the university, he attracted general attention by participating in the All-Estonian Mathematical Olympiad, arriving as an honorable number four. This was a turbulent time in Estonian mathematics, as the old professors (Jaakson, Rägo, Sarv) were all about to retire. The leading mathematician at the mathematics department of Tartu was then Gunnar Kangro (1913–1975), who opened up a new direction, summation theFig. 1: Uno Kaljualid – a student in Tartu ory and attracted many good students4 there. After four years of study Uno was transferred to the Mechanical and Mathematical Faculty 3Kõpu, small village (population: 372 in 2000) situated on the highway connecting Viljandi and Kilingi-\n\nNõmme, ﬁrst mentioned in 1481. [1], 12, p. 264 4In 1940/41, Kangro wrote a long paper on summation theory (100 p.). It appeared in the Acta in 1942, the author had, in 1941, been drafted by the Red Army and then deported to Russia. [2], p. 16.\n\nxii\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF UNO KALJULAID\n\nof Moscow University. He got his diploma in algebraic geometry, under the auspices of Yuri Manin 1966, but he was never formally Manin’s “aspirant”, several applications by him being turned down (cf. below). Post-graduate studies again were done at Tartu University in 1968–1972. As follows to the comments by J.-E. Roos to his diploma work [K69a], some problems, then open, have been settled now. The advisor of his Candidate thesis was Professor Boris Plotkin (at Riga, now in Jerusalem). The defence took place, on March 11, 1979, at the Mathematical Institute of the Belorussian Academy of Sciences in that country’s capital Minsk, with Zenon I. Borevich and Alex E. Zaleskiˇı as ofﬁcial opponents. Uno Kaljulaid taught at Tartu University from 1972 on, ﬁrst 1972–1974 as an Assistant Professor and then 1974–1983 as an Associate Professor. He was made a Docent in 1983. From 1993 on he did scientiﬁc work and provided consultative service at the Computer Science Institute of the Department of Mathematics of Tartu University. Simultaneously, Kaljulaid was a part time senior research fellow at the Institute of Cybernetics in Tallinn, where he carried out studies on compositional theory of abstract state machines with memory.\n\nFig. 2: Boris Isakovich Plotkin, supervisor of Uno Kaljulaid\n\nScientiﬁc work. Teaching. Students. Uno Kaljulaid’s scientiﬁc output is, nominally, not large. Much is in the form of short papers, often merely research announcements. The bibliography below sets the number of items printed under Kaljulaid’s life time to some 40. According to MathSciNet he has 27 reviewed papers in Mathematical Reviews. Searching there for Anywhere: Kalju∗ gave, somewhat surprisingly, 124 hits, indicating that Uno Kaljulaid, after all, was quite inﬂuential. To some extent this high ﬁgure can be accounted for by the fact that it comprises also reviews written by Kaljulaid. On the other hand, MATH Database lists 14 items covered by Zentralblatt. The ﬁrst printed paper by Uno Kaljulaid seems to be [K69a] and visibly represents, although we are not explicitly told this, his diploma work at Moscow. It is about algebraic geometry in a rather abstract style (Serre, Grothendieck), to wit about the cohomological dimension of algebraic varieties. This is what Professor Manin wrote to me when he learnt about the untimely death of Uno: He was a student at the Algebra Chair of Moscow University. For some time, I was nominally his advisor, however, he always had his own scientiﬁc interests. I remember his mild smile and gentle speech. He was deeply interested in mathematics and enthusiastic about it. During the last decade or so I received a couple of letters and postcards from him. He was explaining what he was doing mathematically and usually added just a few words about life, which so drastically changed for many of us. I will miss him. Although Uno Kaljulaid was a dedicated mathematician and all absorbed by this subject, he had also wide interests outside mathematics. We have already recorded his\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF UNO KALJULAID\n\nxiii\n\npassion for the lovely Estonian cranberries. During his Moscow days he also fell in love with ballet. After his sojourn at Moscow University, Uno Kaljulaid did one year of military service in the same city. Having returned to Estonia, in 1967, he worked some time with Professor Jaak Hion5 as supervisor. However, he soon was attracted to the theory of representations, especially of semigroups and algebras, and so his thesis advisor became, at least unofﬁcially, Professor Plotkin, at this time one of the leaders in this area. His Candidate thesis [K79a] (in type script and written in Russian), is translated into English, and printed here for the ﬁrst time. An “author’s review” of the thesis [K79b] is likewise included here. For a very brief overview we also refer to a note in Uspekhi Matematicheskikh Nauk [K77a]. Furthermore, some preliminary results later covered in [K79a] were presented in Fig. 3: Military service 1967 separate publications prior et posterior, see e.g. [K71b,71c,73c,76,77b,78a,78b,81,82a,82b, 83a,83e,85a], not reproduced here). The following lines were written, on my request, by Professor Plotkin about his contacts with Uno: Uno Kaljulaid was not only my pupil but also a very close friend. Our contacts started in the end of 60-ties, when I used to come to Tartu from Riga with talks and lectures. That time the mathematical life in Tartu was rather active. One of the most popular activities was Summer Mathematical Schools in Kääriku. In Kääriku there was a base of Tartu University and mathematicians enjoyed this place where mathematical discussions could be combined with rest, beautiful nature and conversations. I remember that these conferences were made possible due to [Jaak] Hion, Mati Kilp, [Ülo] Lumiste and other mathematicians from Tartu. At the beginning of 70-ties my interest was focused on the varieties of group representations. This topic attracted attention of Uno. Soon after he asked me to give him a problem for his [Candidate] thesis. I recommended him to build a similar theory for representations of semigroups. In this case I took into account that Uno [had] already 5Born in 1929, Hion got his Candidate degree in Moscow under A. G. Kurosh, an outstanding algebraist mainly known for his work in group theory, in 1955.\n\nxiv\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF UNO KALJULAID\n\nstudied semigroups for a long time. Simultaneously I proposed him some problems about group representations. Uno managed to prove a series of signiﬁcant results and in the end of the 70-ties he brilliantly defended his [Candidate] thesis at the Institute of Mathematics in Minsk. His work was highly appreciated by the reviewers and the Council members. Along with great results achieved by Uno, I should mention that he had deep and wide mathematical background. Uno has graduated from Moscow State University, where he got his education from outstanding teachers. For example, I know that during his university years he collaborated with Yu. I. Manin. I think Uno took great advantages from his education in Moscow University and the wide style of mathematical thinking can be traced in all his works during his mathematical career. During the period of preparation of the thesis Uno frequently visited me in Riga. Also later he used to come to discuss various problems. Methods, elaborated in the thesis, were extended and used in the automata theory. We considered automaton as a three-sorted mathematical system which possesses algebraic operations converting states to states and states to output signals. The system of input signals naturally constitutes a semigroup with the representation on the set (space) of states. This algebraic point of view on automata turns out to be very fruitful. Last years he collaborated with his pupil Olga Sokratova and other pupils in automata theory. I think that they could give useful information about his last works. I am sure that your activity in commemorating the memory of Uno Kaljulaid will be appreciated by mathematicians.\n\nFig. 4: Participants of Summer School in Kääriku 1966: V. Vagner, J. Hion, E.

Plotkin\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF UNO KALJULAID\n\nxv\n\nFig. 5: Mati Kilp and Uno Kaljulaid on their way to Moscow 1964\n\nI ﬁnd it curious that thus two men, independently, ﬁrst declare that Uno Kaljulaid was not their pupil, but otherwise give him all the praise that they can! This shows that Uno already early on was an independent mind. There is however one person in Tartu that inﬂuenced him quite a lot. This is Hion, who also should be considered as the founder of the Estonian school of algebra. So, maybe he should after all be viewed as the true teacher of Uno Kaljulaid! Later he became, undoubtedly inspired by this, interested in automata theory. Already in [K69a] there is a brief treatment of at least linear automata. Indeed, automata theory became his main occupation in the last decade of his life. With his unusually broad mathematical education, Kaljulaid took also a vivid interest in the history of mathematics. In particular, he wrote several papers (see this Volume, Chapter V, in particular the last one) about Theodor Molien (1861–1941), born in Riga of Swedish decent, studied in Dorpat/Tartu and a docent there, later in Siberia), who was a pioneer in the ﬁeld of algebras, but is relatively little known to the general mathematical public, despite the fact that he inﬂuenced, for instance, Emmy Noether, who also duly quoted him. Kaljulaid was also early interested in combinatorics, which is treated here in Chapter III. It is my guess that it was through teaching that he was led to this subject. Among research students of Uno Kaljulaid I mention Annela Kelly (née Rämmer), Peeter Laud, Riina Miljan, Jaan Penjam, Tiit Pikkmaa, Varmo Vene, Tiina Zingel (née Nirk).\n\nMy recollections of Uno Kaljulaid. I ﬁrst met Uno Kaljulaid during a trip to then still Soviet occupied Estonia in the spring of 1989. Namely at a meeting of the Estonian Mathematical Society, which took place at Klooga-Ranna, a seaside resort a few miles West of Tallinn and not far from Paldiski, which at the time was a base for\n\nxvi\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF UNO KALJULAID\n\nSoviet submarines. (The conﬂict about submarines with Sweden was going on. “There they are, the submarines, which you cannot catch”, I was told, and people pointed to across the bay.) On that meeting, Kaljulaid gave a talk on combinatorics. After the talk I had a discussion with him and I told him about my own experience of this subject. It ended by me inviting him to Sweden. Kaljulaid came to Stockholm in the spring of 1990. I had rented a room for him in the apartment of Bertil Eneroth, Civil Engineer, in Sibyllegatan 38 in the district Östermalm, where I housed many of my guests during my Stockholm years6. He gave a talk at the algebra seminar run by Jan-Erik Roos at Stockholm University. This was the year when I directed, jointly with Svante Janson, a program at the Mittag-Lefﬂer Institute, which was devoted to Hankel theory. So I invited him also there one day. He had supper with me and my betrothed Eila in the company of, also, Marcel Grossman from Marseille. At the same time Uno went also to Lund, where he met Lars Hörmander and his team of bright young Russian students. Our contacts continued later by correspondence. Uno Kaljulaid wrote to me numerous letters to which I responded less frequently. Much of this correspondence is preserved, but some has, regretfully, been lost, especially most electronic messages. Corresponding with him was not easy. He told me about his ideas, gave bibliographical information7, often quite useful, wrote about his travel, the meetings he had been to, and people that he had met . . . Often he wrote several letters, one on the top of the other. Despite my reprimands, they were often undated, so it was not always clear in which order they ought to be read; now afterwards this makes identiﬁcation quite complicated. Sometimes he, apparently short of paper, wrote numerous post scripts and supplements on odd post cards. He admired me very much and never stopped to thank me for having invited me and for other support. Nevertheless, I think that this collection – I have all stored in a special, rather thick binder –, gives a vivid picture of his thoughts and scientiﬁc activities. However, often Kaljulaid sent me odd items such as excerpts from local newspapers which I found of no interest. He sent me also a number of gifts at various times. Among these I value especially highly a copy of the Estonian translation of Johann Renner’s chronicle [6], which covers the highly dramatic period 1555–1561 in the country’s history, when the Swedes under Erik XIV established themselves in the turbulent country8. As a person Uno Kaljulaid was rather complex. He was always very friendly, and utterly polite, at least to me. Many mathematicians, at least among my Swedish colleagues, took a liking of him, and so the news of his untimely death came as a shock to everybody. In a way he was a maniac. He belonged to the category of mathematicians for whom there was no life outside mathematics. I am not a psychiatrist, but my diagnosis is 6Others who stayed at the same apartment, at various times, include Fernando and Luz Cobos, Genkai Zhang; the last was probably Gennadi Vainikko. 7For instance, he gave me precious references of vital importance for my work on trilinear forms, by pointing to work by V. V. Dolotin, I. M. Gel’fand et al etc. 8Johannes Renner, German man of law (c. 1552–1583), lived 1556–1561 in Estonia and was in the service of the Teutonic Order. He witnessed from a close corner the early phases of the devastating Livonian War (1558–1583). The chronicle was completed in 1582, a year before its author’s death, but the ms. of Renner’s book was lost for about two centuries and so the book appeared in print only in 1876. Nowadays it is regarded as a classic in Low German, which was the ofﬁcial language of Livonia (Estonia + Latvia) for centuries, until the beginning of the 18th century).\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF UNO KALJULAID\n\nxvii\n\nthat he suffered from a kind of persecution mania. I once called, in desperation, Vainikko (then at Helsinki) about this, but he showed little understanding; some of the things that Kaljulaid had told him also turned out not be true (that obstructions were made to him when he left Tartu etc.). Already in the very beginning of our acquaintance Kaljulaid began to worry about that some of his letters could have been intercepted. This was still in Soviet times, but such allegations continued throughout the period of our relation. Let me relate only one such episode, which is supposed to have taken place during one of his stays at Lund (cf. infra). Namely, Kaljulaid claimed that, in our Department’s coffee room, some Swedes, speaking in Swedish, had slandered him in his presence. With my knowledge of Swedes and Swedish mentality, I ﬁnd this highly improbable, especially as I have doubts of Kaljulaid’s ability to understand spoken Swedish. Also many people here liked him; among them was Anders Melin – I am not sure if he was supposed to have been present on the occasion referred to above; it was also Melin who ﬁrst suggested to us to make an application to the Crafoord Foundation (see again infra). Kaljulaid told me also of several other incidents, about various acts of persecution against him, which I found more or less credible. On these occasions his whole attitude suddenly changed, the voice altered almost to whisper, although there could be nobody nearby who could overhear our conversation in Estonian; to me he then looked more like an old woman telling a gossip. Once I wrote to him and advised to go to the Rector of the University and complain; afterwards I realized that, although this could have been a logical step in Sweden, it could hardly have been a good idea in post-communist Estonia. I doubt that Kaljulaid followed my advice. After my return to Lund in 1992, I arranged Uno Kaljulaid a second visit to Sweden with money coming from the Swedish National Council for Scientiﬁc Research (NFR); again, he visited both Stockholm and Lund. To Lund he came in September 1994. It was on this occasion that we set up a plan to study majorization from a very general point of view. However, only a tiny portion of our rather ambitious plan was ever materialized (see Chapter III); it is clear that I wrote the ﬁrst version of that paper already then. We made also plans for future cooperation; to this end we applied, in 1995, for a grant from the Crafoord Foundation, and, indeed, we were given a rather handsome sum of money, which allowed Kaljulaid to come to Lund several times. So, Kaljulaid arrived again in Lund at the end of September 1994. By the irony of fate, he came the week before the Estonia catastrophe9, so, had he come only slightly later, he could well have been one of the victims. I recall that Eila and I heard about it by 6 o’clock in the morning by early, Finnish language broadcast on the Swedish radio. I immediately phoned Uno, who was staying in one of our Department’s guestrooms. We were both, of course, utterly shocked, and I reminded him about all the Estonian refugees, often in tiny vessels, who had drowned in similar weather conditions in the same month in September, 1944. Anyhow, soon we went on with mathematics. Kaljulaid gave several colloquium talks on automata theory; they were based on material which he had prepared on previous occasions. So I volunteered to write them up for him (see Chapter II, Section 2). Having learnt about his inability in practical matters, I saw it\n\n9The passenger vessel Estonia, owned by a joint-venture Swedish Estonian company on the line TallinnStockholm, perished near the Finnish coast, on September 28, 1994, in one of the ﬁerce autumn storms in the Baltic. On this occasion, 869 persons were killed.\n\nxviii\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF UNO KALJULAID\n\nas my duty to try to help him publish at least part of his ideas. Probably, I prepared a TeX-version of Lecture 1 already while he was in Lund. Next time that Uno Kaljulaid came to Sweden was the year after, in October, 1996. We then made plans for another visit. This time we made an application to the Swedish Institute (SI), which included also a visit for Kaljulaid’s bright student Peeter Laud; I was supposed to have become his advisor. Unfortunately, the application was turned down. Later Laud showed interest in more applied things and defended his PhD thesis [3] on information security matters in 2002. An even shorter, last trip was in May 1997. After that time (during the last two years of the life of Uno Kaljulaid), my contacts with him were even more sporadic. I wrote Lecture 2. Uno sent me corrections and additions, and also some material for Lecture 3. Rereading our correspondence from this period, I ﬁnd it striking that he showed relatively little interest in the whole project. On my side, I also took almost none initiative, as I was busy with teaching and other activities . . .\n\nMarriage. Uno Kaljulaid married in 1973. His future wife Helle was a technical assistant at the mathematics department. From this marriage two daughters were born, Annika in 1974 and Kristina in 1979. In the mid 1980’s the parents divorced, but they never separated. Illness and death. Uno Kaljulaid became ill already at the end of the 1987 and had a surgery for a stomach cancer. At the time doctors gave him only at most ﬁve years to live. However, he was practically rather healthy until the middle of July, 1999. He worked and went jogging every morning. Until the mid of July he rested in his beloved Pärnu but then he began to cough and gradually felt less and less at ease. Nevertheless, at the end of July he participated in a conference in Poland, and, probably, gave also a talk there. Upon his return he, ﬁnally, went to see a doctor, because his health had seriously began to deteriorate. Mid September he underwent another surgery, but its purpose was only to set a diagnosis: a cancer in the stomach with remote metastases in the lungs and in the liver. After the operation Uno told that he would not surrender so easily and that he hoped to be able to ﬁnish at least the ongoing work. A few days before his death, however, asked that all should be ﬁnished. Luckily he did not suffer of heavy pain, but still it was very hard. Uno Kaljulaid passed away at the age of 57 on September 26, 1999 in the pulmonary clinic at Tartu. Annika wrote me that it was a sunny autumn day. He died in the arms of his half-sister Laine. He was buried on October 1st at his native village Kõpu in the district of Viljandi. His death was that of a true hero . . . In the meantime, I was quite unaware of everything. Early in June I received two postcards from Uno, dated in Tartu on June 4, 1999, and, apparently, sent in the same enclosure, the text of which I hereby offer a translation:\n\nBIOGRAPHY OF UNO KALJULAID\n\nxix\n\nDear Mr. Peetre, Thank you for sending me the thesis of Mr. Rosengren10, and likewise for your lines. This time everything arrived in unhurt shape, although with some delay. I have now ﬁnished my courses, and very soon I shall also ﬁnish the exams. But this occupation gives me steadily less and less satisfaction. Probably I’ll have a chance to participate in the CSconference in Uppsala. But I have not yet made up my mind whether to go there or not, because its scope covers a few of my interests. But it would be an opportunity to see Stockholm once more. Spring here was chilly, frost took the ﬂowering of the currant bushes. Probably things were not so bad where you are – for Lund is on the latitude of Latvia or even further south. I presume that you are already by the sea, I wish a pleasant summer. Uno Kaljulaid\n\nI was notiﬁed about Kaljulaid’s death, three days after, in an email message from his daughter Annika. She gave me also the above details of his illness and death. Furthermore, she told me that at his sickbed her father told that he wanted me to take care of his “Nachlass”, which I also eventually did . . . So all this is just my tribute to him . . .

Roos\n\nAbstract. We prove that the cohomological dimension of the complement an arbitrary ﬁnite set of points in an r-dimensional Cohen-Macauly projective variety equals r −1.\n\nThe problem of the computation of the cohomology of quasiprojective varieties with coefﬁcients in coherent sheaves leads, in particular, to the interesting question of the cohomological dimension of such varieties. This characteristic of a variety interests us, in ﬁrst place, in connection with a result by Nagata [7] to the effect that every algebraic variety can be embedded in a complete algebraic variety. As simple examples show, far from always this embedding V → V ∗ satisﬁes the requirement of the minimality of the number dim(V ∗ \\V ). It is an interesting problem to exhibit all the cases when this number can be described in terms of the cohomological dimension of the complement V ∗ \\V . In this paper one such case is described in Theorem 1.2. Section 1.1 contains a brief survey of some known, but not readily available results of the theory of local cohomology of A. Grothendieck in a form suitable to us. In Section 1.2 we state some general properties of cohomological dimension. In Section 1.3 it is shown that the cohomological dimension of the complement of a ﬁnite non-empty of points in an n-dimensional projective space equals n − 1, and in Section 1.4 we give some auxiliary computations.\n\n1.1. The local cohomology of Grothendieck 1. We give some basic deﬁnitions. The space X has cohomological dimension n if, for an arbitrary algebraic sheaf F on X, for i > n the group H i (X, F ) is zero, but there exists a sheaf F such that H n (X, F ) = 0. According to Grothendieck ([3], Theorem 4.15.2) a space of combinatorial Zariski dimension ≤ n has cohomological dimension ≤ n. On the other hand, there exists a space of inﬁnite combinatorial dimension but having zero cohomological dimension [3]. For algebraic varieties X we change the deﬁnition of cohomological dimension, considering instead of Abelian sheaves on X the category of coherent sheaves. Then the afﬁne varieties gives us an example of Zariski spaces of arbitrary large combinatorial dimension, in addition having zero cohomological dimension. 2. If Z ⊂ X is locally closed, then by deﬁnition one can ﬁnd an open set V ⊂ X such that Z is closed in V . In the group F (V ) of sections of F on V we distinguish the semigroup ΓZ (X, F ) of all such sections whose supports are contained in Z. The group ΓZ (X, F ) is independent of the choice of V , and the functor F =⇒ ΓZ (X, F )\n\n4\n\nC HAPTER I. REPRESENTATIONS OF SEMIGROUPS AND ALGEBRAS\n\nmaps an exact sequence of sheaves 0 → F → G → H into an exact sequence of Abelian groups 0 → ΓZ (F ) → ΓZ (G) → ΓZ (H). This means that the functor F =⇒ ΓZ (X, F ) is exact from the left from the category of Abelian sheaves on X into the category of Abelian groups. If U ⊂ X is open, then the natural homomorphism of restriction F (V ) → F (V ∩ U ) induces a homomorphism ΓZ (X, F ) → ΓZ∩U (U, F |U ), which is indeed a sheaf. The functor F =⇒ ΓZ (F ) is exact from the left in the category of Abelian functions onto itself; we deﬁne the right derivative HZi (X, F ) of this functor which is called the sheaf of local cohomology of X. Let X be an r-dimensional Zariski space F , F an Abelian sheaf on it and Z ⊂ X locally closed. Grothendieck’s theorem ([5], Proposition 1.12) says that for i > r the groups HZi (X, F ) and that the sheaves HZi (X, F ) are zero. 3. Let X = SpecA be an additive scheme, Y one of its subschemes, given by an ideal I ⊂ A; the sheaf of coefﬁcients F associated with the A-module N . Then one has for all i > 0 the isomorphism HYi (X, F ) ≈ lim ExtiA (A/I n , N )\n\n([5], Theorem 2.8).\n\nn\n\nFor each open Y ⊂ X and a coherent sheaf F on X one has the exact sequence 0 → ΓY (X, F ) → Γ(X, F ) → Γ(X\\Y, F ) → HYi (X, F ) → . . . HYi (X, F ) → H i (X, F ) → H i (X\\Y, F ) → HYi+1 (X, F ) → . . . . As in the case at hand H i (X, F ) = 0 for all i > 0, we have the isomorphism H i (X\\Y, F ) ≈ HYi+1 (X, F ). Next, let X be an r-dimensional projective space and S = k[t0 , . . . , tr ] the algebra of polynomials over the ﬁeld k. We take for F the sheaf O(n). Then, by Serre [11], for r O(n)) 0 < i < r the groups H i (X, are zero, while the group H (X, O(n)) is a vector −n−1 and has a basis of skew symmetric cocycles of cover space over k of dimension r U = (ti = 0) of the form 1 , f01...r = α0 t . . . tαr where αi > 0 and αi = −n. Therefore we have for 0 < r < r − 1 the isomorphism H i (X\\Y, O(n)) ≈ HYi (X, O(n)), while, by deﬁnition the groups H r (X\\Y, O(n)) are given by the exact sequence HYr (X, O(n)) → H r (X, O(n)) → H r (X\\Y, O(n)) → 0.\n\n1. On the cohomological dimension ...\n\n5\n\n4. Let M and N be graded S-modules. Then the derived functor Ext of the functor Homs (M, N ) = ⊕ HomnS (M, N ), deﬁned, on the one hand, by Serre in [11] and, on the n\n\nother hand, Cartan and Eilenberg in [1] need not coincide. However, it is easy to see they do coincide in the case needed by us of ExtiA (A/I n , A), where A = k[t1 , . . . ,r ] and I is the ideal in A given by Y ⊂ X. Indeed, the ring A/I n as a module over itself, is also an A-module. As a ring A/I n is Noetherian. The submodules of A/I n are ideals in it; therefore, it follows from Hilbert’s theorem ([1], p. 32) that this module is Noetherian. But a Noetherian module over a Noetherian ring is of ﬁnite type. In this case ([11], p. 434) both deﬁnitions coincide. Let there be given R-modules A, B, A , B and R-homomorphisms α : A → A and β : B → B . Introduce an R-homomorphism Hom(α, β) : Hom(A, B) → Hom(A , B ) which to each ϕ ∈ Hom(A, B) is deﬁned by the Hom(α, β) ◦ ϕ = β ◦ ϕ ◦ α. The objects Hom(A, β) and Hom(α, B) are obtained from Hom(α, β) for A = A and B = B respectively. The following theorem from homological algebra may be useful in the calculation of local groups of cohomology. Let us consider the exact sequences of modules α\n\n0 → I n → A → A/I n → 0 and\n\nβ\n\n0 → A → K → A → K/A → 0, where A is a projective and K an injective module. The following isomorphisms hold true (cf. [1], p.141): n ExtiA (A/I n , A) ≈ Exti−2 A (I , K/A);\n\nExt2A (A/I n , A) ≈ Coker(HomA (α, β)); Ext1A (A/I n , A) ≈ Ker (Hom(α, β))/[Ker (HomA (α, K/A)) + Ker (HomA (A, β))]. As by the ﬁrst main theorem of Grothendieck one has the isomorphism HYi (X, O) ≈ lim ExtiA (A/I n , A), n\n\nthe three isomorphisms just given sufﬁce for the calculation in a 3-dimensional space.\n\n1.2. Some general properties of cohomological dimension 1. Let X and Y be algebraic varities; ϕ : Y → X a morphism and F an algebraic sheaf on X. Then there is deﬁned on Y an algebraic sheaf F ϕ , called the inverse image of the sheaf F under the isomorphism1 ϕ. If F is a coherent sheaf on X, then F ϕ too is coherent on Y . Indeed, in view of the coherence of F there exists U ⊂ X for which one has an exact sequence Op → Oq → F → 0. The homomorphism Ox → Oy induces the identity map on the base ﬁeld k; therefore we have the canonical isomorphism Oy ⊗Ox Ox ≈ Oy . 1Regarding the construction of the sheaf F ϕ , cf. [9].\n\n6\n\nC HAPTER I. REPRESENTATIONS OF SEMIGROUPS AND ALGEBRAS\n\nThis gives us Oyn ≈ (Oxn )ϕ , n = 1, 2, . . . and so in ϕ−1 (U ) we have for F ϕ the exact sequence Op → Oq → F ϕ → 0, proving the coherence of F ϕ . 2. T HEOREM 1.1. For arbitrary algebraic varieties X and Y we have the inequality dimh(X × Y ) ≥ dimh X + dimh Y.\n\n(1)\n\nIf dim X = dimh X, dim Y = dimh Y , then both sides of (1) coincide. P ROOF. Let p1 : X × Y → X and p2 : X × Y → Y be the natural projections. Furthermore, set dimh X = r, dimh Y = s. Then there exists coherent sheaves F and G, on X and Y respectively, such that the k-vector spaces H r (X, F ) and H r (Y, G) are not zero; therefore H r (X, F ) ⊗k H s (Y, G) = 0. Let us use the Künneth formula for sheaves [10]: H i (X, F ) ⊗k H j (Y, G), H n (X × Y, F p1 ⊗OX×Y Gp2 ) ≈ i+j=n\n\nIt follows from it that H r+s (X ×Y, F p1 ⊗OX×Y Gp2 ) = 0, whence dimh X ×Y ≥ r+s. Let us remark that for t > r + s the relation n ) = 0 H t (OX×Y\n\ncannot hold true. This follows from Künneth’s formulae in view of n p1 OTn = OTn ⊗OT OT = (OX ) ⊗ OT (OYn )p2 ,\n\nwhere T = X × Y . In the case dim X = dimh X, dim Y = dimh Y , we obtain in view of Grothendieck’s theorem ([3], Theorem 4.15.2) that dimh X + dimh Y ≥ dim X × Y ≥ dimh X × Y ≥ dimh X + dimh Y, which again gives dim X × Y = dimh X + dimh Y. 3. Let i : V → W be a closed embedding of algebraic varieties. Then holds the relation dimh V ≤ dimh W. Indeed, if we set r = dimh V , then the group H r (V, F ) is non-zeo for some coherent sheaf F over V . On the variety W we consider the sheaf F W , deﬁned by the process of extending F off the variety V . The required relation follows from the isomorphism H r (W, F W ) ≈ H r (V, F ). We remark that for an open mapping this relation is not true. Indeed, let V = A2 \\(0), W = A2 , where A2 denotes the afﬁne plane. Then dimh W = 0, but dimh V = 1 (cf. Paragraph 1, Section 1.4).\n\n1. On the cohomological dimension ...\n\n7\n\n4. We make the following conjecture: for an arbitrary ﬁber bundle (E, π, B) whose ﬁber is the projective space P r , it holds the formula dimh E = dimh B + r. If this is true it follows from it in a trivial way that the cohomological dimension for the σ-process for a point only can increase. Let X ∗ be a variety obtained by monoidal transformations from a non-special, irreducible algebraic variety X of dimension r. Let the center of this σ-process be a nonspecial d-dimensional variety i : V → X. Furthermore, let f : X ∗ → X be the projection. The inverse image of X under this projection of X ∗ is a projective ﬁbering of rank r − d − 1 with basis V . In view of the fact that the embedding i∗ : V ∗ → X ∗ is closed, the hypothesis made and the monotonicity properties we obtain dimh X ∗ ≥ dimh V + r + d − 1. In particular, for the σ-process for a point we obtain dimh X ∗ ≥ r − 1. As dim X ∗ = dimh X, we have in view of known theorems (cf. Paragraph 1, Section 1.1) we obtain either dimh X ∗ = r or dimh X ∗ = r − 1. Let us now take for X an afﬁne variety of dimension r, and for V a point. It is clear that dimh X = 0. Clearly, as V ∗ is a projective space, then dimh X ∗ = r − 1. Thus for r > 1 we have dimh X ∗ > dimh X.\n\n1.3. The cohomological dimension of a certain variety 1. Let us consider the projective space P r and an arbitrary subvariety of codimension ≥ 2 in it. In Section 1.1 we saw that the group H r (P r \\Y, O(n)) can be found from the exact sequence HYr (P r , O(n)) → H r (P r , O(n)) → H r (P r \\Y, O(n)) → 0. Is the group H r (P r \\Y, O(n)) always different from zero? The answer to this question is negative and follows at once from the following theorem ([5], Theorem 6.8): For any quasiprojective variety of dimension r the following three conditions are equivalent: (1) all irreducible components of X of dimension r are non-proper; (2) H r (X, F ) = 0 for any quasi-coherent sheaf F on X; (3) H r (X, OX (−n)) = 0 for all n ≥ 0, where OX (1) is the “very abundant sheaf” of Serre, induced by some projective embedding of X. As X = P r \\Y is a quasiprojective variety of dimension r (open in P r ), apparently irreducible and non-complete, then condition (1) is fulﬁlled. Therefore condition (2) gives H r (P r \\Y, F ) = 0 for every coherent sheaf F on X. 2. T HEOREM 1.2. The cohomological dimension of a quasi-projective variety P r \\Y obtained by throwing away a non-empty ﬁnite set of points Y = {Q1 , . . . , Qs } in the projective space P r equals r − 1.\n\n8\n\nC HAPTER I. REPRESENTATIONS OF SEMIGROUPS AND ALGEBRAS\n\nP ROOF. In view of the result of the previous subsection it is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd a coherent sheaf F on P r \\Y such that the group H r (P r \\Y, F ) is non-zero. It turns out that one can take F = O(n). We prove the relation H r (P r \\Y, O(n)) = 0 by contradiction. Assume that for each coherent sheaf F the group H r (P r \\Y, F ) is zero. Then in the exact sequence . . . → H r (P r−1 \\Y, F ) → HYr (P r , F ) → H r (P r , F ) → H r (P r \\Y, F ) → . . . the boundary groups are zero, and we obtain, in particular, the isomorphism HYr (P r , O(n)) ≈ H r (P r , F ). We use Proposition 1.9 in [5], which we reformulate in a form suitable for us. Let Y ⊂ Y ⊂ P r be closed subspaces and Y = Y \\Y . Then for any coherent sheaf F on P r we have the exact sequence HYr (P r , O(n)) → H r (P r , O(n)) → HYr (P r , O(n)) → 0. By the excision formula ([5], Proposition 1.3) for a topological space X, a locally closed Y ⊂ X and an open V ⊂ X such that Y ⊂ V ⊂ X, one has, for each Abelian sheaf F and for all i, the isomorphism HYi (X, F ) ≈ HYi (V, F |V ). Take any point Q in the set Y = {Q1 , . . . , Qs } and consider for Y with respect to the set {Q}. The point Q lies in some component A of the standard afﬁne covering of the space P r . We apply now the excision formula to the penultimate term of our exact sequence for the sheaf O(n). Taking account of that A is afﬁne and the isomorphism O(n)|A = O|A, we get the isomorphisms HYr (P r , O(n)) ≈ HYr (A, O(n)) ≈ H r−1 (A\\{Q}, O). Therefore we have the following exact sequence: α\n\nHYr (P r , O(n)) → H r (P r , O(n)) → H r−1 (Ar \\{Q}, O) → 0, where α is an epimorphism of k-vector spaces. Thanks to a result of Serre [11] one knows that H r (P r , O(n)) is a ﬁnite dimensional k-vector space. On the other hand, the computations in Paragraph 2 of Section 1.3 show that the k-space H r−1 (Ar \\Q, O) is inﬁnite dimensional. Therefore the exact sequence of vector spaces obtained concludes the contradiction. The Theorem is proved. In the question of the dimension of the k-space HYr (A, O), where Y = {Q1 , . . . , Qs }, one can limit oneself to the case of a one-dimensional space Y . In fact, the following corollary holds true. P ROPOSITION 1.3. Let A be an r-dimensional variety and F a coherent sheaf on r A. If the space HQ (A, O) is inﬁnite dimensional over k for an arbitrary point Q ∈ A, then the relation r (A, F ) = ∞ dimk H{Q 1 ,...,Qs }\n\nholds for any arbitrary ﬁnite family of points {Q1 , . . . , Qs } ⊂ A.\n\n1. On the cohomological dimension ...\n\n9\n\nP ROOF. By Grothendieck [3] for Q1 ⊂ {Q1 , . . . , Qs } ⊂ A one has the exact sequence β\n\nα\n\nr r r HQ (A, F ) → H{Q (A, F ) → H{Q (A, F ) → 0, 1 1 ,...,Qs } 2 ,...,Qs }\n\nwhich we, for the sake of simplicity, rewrite in the form α\n\nβ\n\nA(1) → B(s) → C(s − 1) → 0. Our Proposition gives the possibility to carry induction over the number of points s. Let us assume that the statement is proved for s < n. Then in the exact sequence A(1) → B(n) → C(n − 1) → 0, the term C(n−1) has inﬁnite dimension, which in view of the fact that B(n) is a k-space gives a contradiction. As the computation in 1.4.2 shows that r dimk HQ (k r , O) = dimk H r−1 (k r \\Q, O) = ∞,\n\nit follows from what has been proved that for each ﬁnite collection of points S in k r the k-space H r−1 (k r \\S, O) is inﬁnite dimensional. 3. The character of the facts, from [5] and [11], used in the proof of Theorem 1.2 is such that the statement of the theorem, apparently, can be carried over to the case of an arbitrary variety V of dimension ≥ 2, if it were possible for each afﬁne variety r (X, OX ) is inﬁnite dimensional. X = Spec A, dim A = r, to prove that the k-space HQ r (A) Clearly, A may be taken as a local ring; then everything reduced to the proof that HM is inﬁnite dimensional, where M ⊂ A is a maximal ideal. As S. I. Dolgaev has observed that, when all local rings of a variety V are CohenMacauly rings (for example, when V is nonsingular or is locally a complete intersection), this easily follows from the following criterion of Grothendieck for the coherence of sheaves of local cohomology: Let X be a locally Noetherian pre-scheme locally embedded in a regular pre-scheme, and Y a closed subvariety of X, F a coherent OX -module, c(x) = dim{¯ x}, n ∈ Z. The following two conditions are equivalent [4]: (i) for all x ∈ X\\Y such that c(x) = 1, depth Fx ≥ n; (ii) for i ≤ n the sheaves H iY (F ) are coherent. Indeed, take X = Spec OV,Q = Spec A. As by assumption A is a Cohen-Macauly r (A) ring and c(x) = dim{¯ x} = 1, then depth Ax = dim Ax = r − 1. If the space HM were ﬁnite dimensional, then it would follow from condition (ii) that n = r, from which by (i) depth Ax ≥ r, which is contradictory.\n\n1.4. Some computations and remarks 1. Let us consider the algebraic variety X, obtained from the afﬁne plane [with coordinates (x, y)] by exclusion of the origin; it is not afﬁne but admits an afﬁne cover U = (U1 , U2 ), where U1 = X\\(x = 0) and U2 = X\\(y = 0). If X is an arbitrary variety in which the subvariety Y has codimension ≥ 2, we obtain, in view of the fact that the singularity of every rational function on X has codimension 1, that H 0 (X \\Y, O) ≈ H 0 (X , O). Therefore, in this case H 0 (X, O) consists of all polynomials P (x, y).\n\n10\n\nC HAPTER I. REPRESENTATIONS OF SEMIGROUPS AND ALGEBRAS\n\nLet us compute the group H 1 (U, O). It is clear that all cochains f12 ∈ C 1 (U) P (x, y) , where k, l are integers. In view of C 2 (U) = 0, all one dimenhave the form xk y l sional cochains are cocycles. The clariﬁcation of the question which of the cochains are P (x, y) coboundaries is equivalent to when all k can be written in the form x y xk P1 (x, y) − x P2 (x, y) , xk y Thus, we have\n\nH (X, O) ≈ 1\n\nP (x, y) xk y l\n\nk, ≥ 0\n\nxk P1 (x, y) − x P2 (x, y) xk y\n\n,\n\nwhere P, P1 , P2 are arbitrary polynomials, while k , , k, l ≥ 0. It is easy to see that this 1 factor space is inﬁnite dimensional. To this end we remark that all expressions k give x y different cosets: 1 xk y − xm y n 1 − = , xk y xm y n xp y q where p = max(k, m), q = max(l, n), k = p − n, m = p − m, = q − , n = q − n. It is sufﬁcient to show that there exist numbers P and Q such that xk y − xm y n = xp P − y q Q. To this end we have to consider two cases 1) p = k, q = and 2) p = k, q = n. Assuming that such P and Q exist in the ﬁrst case, we obtain xp P − y q Q = 1 − xp−m y q−n , which is a contradiction, as the left hand side of the equation has unity among its terms. Analogously, in the second case the equation y q− −xp−m = xp P −y q Q, where p−m < p, q − < q, leads us to a contradiction. Thus we have proved that dimk H 1 (X, Q) = ∞. 2. T HEOREM 1.4.

Kneser, in a 3-dimensional space X an irreducible curve E can be expressed by three algebraic surfaces, which we denote by V0 , V1 , V2 . In view of E = ∩Vi we have for X = X \\E the open afﬁne covering U = (Ui = X \\Vi ) and i\n\nwe can apply the following theorem of Serre [11]. Let X be an algebraic variety, F a coherent sheaf on X and U = (Ui ) a ﬁnite afﬁne covering of X. Then for each i ≥ 0 the homomorphism σ(U) : H i (UU, F ) → H i (X, F ) is an isomorphism. As dim U = 2, we have by this theorem H 3 (X, F ) = 0 for all coherent sheafs on X. There arises an interesting question: For an algebraic curve E and a coherent sheaf F on X, can the group H 2 (X, F ) be different from zero? This is connected with the conjecture on the impossibility to express an arbitrary curve in a 3-dimensional space by two surfaces. Indeed, we would have a proof of this negative statement if for some curve E the answer to the question posed would be positive. The question of the non-triviality of H 2 (X, F ) arises also in connection with the conjecture that each vector bundle of rank 2 on a 3-dimensional afﬁne space is trivial. Indeed, Serre proved in [12] that if this problem has a positive solution then each non-special rational or elliptic curve in a 3-dimensional afﬁne space would be a complete intersection. Therefore this conjecture would be refuted if in a 3-dimensional afﬁne space one could ﬁnd a rational or elliptic curve E such that H 2 (CE, F ) = 0 for some coherent sheaf F . This shows that the question perhaps could be solved in terms of cohomological of algebra. In [6] Hartshorne introduced the notion of local connectivity of a variety of codimension 1, which refers to the situation when spreading out of a subvariety of codimension greater than unity does not disturb the connectivity structure of the variety. He obtains a necessary condition for a manifold to be a complete intersection, which amounts to local connectivity of this variety of codimension 1. It turns out that the non-triviality of the groups H i (X \\V, O), i ≥ 2, is not a necessary for the representability of that variety as a complete intersection. This is shown by the following example. Consider in the complex afﬁne space X = C4 with the Zariski topology the variety V which is the union of two planes: x1 = x2 = 0 and x3 = x4 = 0. It is clear that at the origin this variety is not connected with codimension 1 and so it cannot be a complete intersection. However, a computation reveals that H 2 (CV, O) = H 3 (CV, O) = 0, where [as before] CM denotes the complement on C4 of a set M . We have X = CV = C[(x1 = x2 = 0) ∪ (x3 = x4 = 0)] = 3\n\n=C(x1 = x2 = 0) ∩ C(x3 = x4 = 0) = ∪ Ui , i=0\n\n1.

By Serre’s theorem H i (X, O) ≈ H i (U, O), i = 2, 3. Let us complete H 3 (U, O).

Peetre, comments by R. Lipyanskiˇı\n\nThe triangular product in the theory of varieties of representations of groups plays a role analogous to the role of the wreath product for group varieties. In this note we study the triangular product of representations of semigroups and associative algebras. We assume that K is a ﬁeld. This is required in the main results of the paper, although the principal constructions and notions can be introduced for any associative and commutative ring K with unit. For pairs (G, Γ) such that the semigroup (algebra) Γ acts by semigroup (algebra) endomorphisms on the K-module G, one can introduce, exactly as in the case of groups, a net of notions and constructions. A variety of representations of semigroups and algebras is a saturated Birkhoff class of the corresponding pairs. By deﬁnition, a class K of pairs is termed saturated if for all right epimorphisms of pairs (G, Γ) → (G , Γ ) with (G , Γ ) ∈ K it holds that (G, Γ) ∈ K. The variety generated by the class K will be denoted Var K. Multiplication of two varieties Θ1 and Θ2 is deﬁned by the rule: a pair (G, Γ) is contained in Θ1 · Θ2 if G has a Γ-invariant submodule H such that (H, Γ) ∈ Θ1 and (G/H, Γ) ∈ Θ2 . There arises the semigroup M(K) (the semigroup L(K)) of varieties of representations of semigroups (algebras). The semigroup M(K) is anti-isomorphic to the semigroup of ideals of the semigroup ring F = KΨ of the free monoid Ψ with a countable set of free generators, invariant with respect to all endomorphisms F induced by endomorphisms of the monoid Ψ. The semigroup L(K) is anti-isomorphic to the semigroup T (K) of non-zero ideals of the free associative Kalgebra F of countable rank (with respect to the usual multiplication of ideals of F ). 1. For pairs (A, Σ1 ) and (B, Σ2 ) we set Φ = Hom+ K (B, A) ⊂ EndK (A, B). The natural action of the semigroups Σ1 and Σ2 on the (additive) semigroup Φ allows us to introduce a multiplication in Φ × Σ1 × Σ2 , (ϕ, σ1 , σ2 ) · (ϕ , σ1 , σ2 ) = (σ2 · ϕ , ϕ · σ1 , σ1 σ1 , σ2 σ2 ). There arises the semigroup Γ = Φ Σ1 × Σ2 ; its action on G = A ⊕ B goes according to the formula (a + b) ◦ (ϕ, σ1 , σ2 ) = a ◦ σ1 + bϕ ◦ σ1 + b ◦ σ2 , extends to the pair (G, Γ), which will be denoted (A, Σ1 ) (B, Σ2 ) and called the triangular product of the given pairs. The properties of this construction are in many respects parallel to the properties of the triangular product of group pairs (B.I. Plotkin, 1971, [3]). Let us remark that Γ is a group if and only if Σ1 and Σ2 are groups and Φ is treated as the additive closure to a group of the semigroup Hom+ K (B, A). T HEOREM 2.1. The following formula holds true: Var(K1 K2 ) = Var K1 · Var K2 .\n\n16\n\nC HAPTER I. REPRESENTATIONS OF SEMIGROUPS AND ALGEBRAS\n\nFrom this one deduces that the variety of linear representations (over a ﬁeld) is a semigroup with a unique decomposition as a product of a ﬁnite number of indecomposable varieties. 2. The questions under study are also connected with automata theory. A linear semigroup automaton A = (A, Γ, B) is a system, where A (the states) and B (the outputs) are K-modules, while Γ (the input signals) is a semigroup and there are given K-linear operations A◦Γ → A and A Γ → B such that (A, Γ) is a liner map with respect to the action ◦, and a ∗ γ1 γ2 = (a ◦ γ1 ) ∗ γ2 for all a ∈ A, γ1 γ2 ∈ Γ. The automaton A = (A , Γ , B ) is called an invariant subautomaton of A if A and B are K-submodules in A and B respectively and A ◦ Γ ⊂ A , A Γ ⊂ B . By deﬁnition an automaton A belongs to the product of two varieties of linear automata Θ1 and Θ2 if there exists an invariant subautomaton such that A ⊂ A, A ∈ Θ1 with A/A ∈ Θ2 . T HEOREM 2.2. A variety of linear automata with the multiplication indicated is a semigroup which is not free but contains a free subsemigroup isomorphic to M(K). ¯ where Σ ¯ acts from the left and the right on 3. Let there be given K-algebras Φ and Σ, ¯=Φ ¯ ⊕Σ ¯ we retain Φ and that this is a bimultiplication in the sense of Hochschild. On Γ the deﬁnition of addition and multiplication by scalars, while multiplication is deﬁned anew putting (ϕ, σ) · (ϕ , σ ) = (ϕ · σ + σ · ϕ + ϕϕ , σσ ). ¯ which is the semidirect product of the algebras Φ and There arises the K-algebra Φ Σ, ¯ Σ. ¯ 1) For given pairs (G1 , Σ1 ) and (G2 , Σ2 ), where Σi are K-algebras, we let (G1 , Σ ¯ 2 ) be the corresponding faithful pairs and set G = G1 ⊕ G2 . We treat Σ ¯ = and (G2 , Σ ¯ 2 and Φ = HomK (G2 , G1 ) as subalgebras of EndK G. Multiplication in EndK G ¯ 1 ⊕Σ Σ ¯ on Φ. Setting Σ = Σ1 ⊕ Σ2 we obtain a natural deﬁnes a left and a right action of Σ ¯ then we can extend the action of Σ ¯ on Φ to an action of Σ on epimorphism f : Σ → Σ, ¯ = Γ whose action on G = G1 ⊕ G2 is given by the Φ. We arrive at the algebra Φ Σ formula (g1 + g2 ) ◦ (ϕ, σ) = g2ϕ + (g1 + g2 ) ◦ σ. This action agrees with the operations on Γ. There arises the pair (G, Γ), which is the triangular product of the representations (G1 , Σ1 ) and (G2 , Σ2 ), which we denote by (G1 , Σ1 ) (G2 , Σ2 ). T HEOREM 2.3 (Main theorem). For any two classes K1 and K2 of representations there holds the formula Var(K1 K2 ) = Var K1 · Var K2 . It follows from this that each non-trivial representation of algebras decomposes uniquely as a ﬁnite product of indecomposbale representations. Thus, the semigroup L(K) is free. This opens a new door to the result of Bergman and Lewin [1] on the freeness of the semigroup T (K). Here we have supplementary possibilities. It is known that the set A(K) of proper varieties of (associative) K-algebras is in a bijective correspondence with the set T (K). Multiplication in T (K) induces now on A(K) an associative multiplication , which we denote by ∗. We are led to the following results. For a K-algebra A let A∗ be the result of an outer adjunction of a unit to it , and let Var A be the variety of K-algebras generated by A. Let us introduce for any K-algebras\n\n2. Triangular products of representations\n\n17\n\nA and B the operation of wreath product by the formula AwrB = HomK (B ∗ , A∗ ) (A ⊕ B), where A∗ and B ∗ are regarded as K-modules. The justiﬁcation of this name is given by the functional role of this operation, which is disclosed by the formula (Var A∗ ) ∗ (Var B ∗ ) = Var(BwrA). By deﬁnition a T -ideal is ﬁnitary if the variety of K-algebras deﬁned by it generates a ﬁnite dimensional K-algebra. It turns out that a ﬁnite product of T -ideals is ﬁnitary when all factors are ﬁnitary. If a variety of K-algebras is given with the aid of identities in n variables then it can not be decomposed in more than n factors. In particular, the semisimplicity (in the sense of Jacobson)of a K-algebra forces Var A to be indecomposable. The author is obliged to Professor B.I. Plotkin for supervising this work, and for his valuable advice and interesting discussion, and, furthermore, G. Bergman for sending him his pre-print. [3], [2]\n\nComments. It is known that if K1 and K2 are two classes of group representations over a ﬁeld and K1 K2 their triangle product, then Var(K1 K2 ) = Var K1 · Var K2 [4]. Uno Kaljulad extends this result to representations of semigroups, associative algebras and linear automata. In this way he obtains another proof of the Bergman-Lewin theorem that the semigroup of T -ideals (verbal ideals of absolutely free associative algebra over a ﬁeld) is free Bergman-Lewin [1]. He introduces a new operation over associative algebras, the wreath product of algebras, and proves some interesting properties of this operation: (Var A∗ ) ∗ (Var B ∗ ) = Var(BwrA), where A∗ (and B ∗ ) is obtained from algebra A (and B) by adjunction to it a unit. Author investigates also decomposition of ﬁnitary T -ideal in indecomposable factors. He brings a sufﬁcient condition when factors of this decomposition to be indecomposable: if K-algebra is semisimple (in the sense of Jacobson), then Var A to be indecomposable. There are also other sufﬁcient conditions for the above-mentioned properties. I think that this paper of Uno Kaljulad was a pioneer work in the theory of the variety of semigroup representations and the variety of linear automata. His results extend also above mentioned Bergman-Lewin theorem. Ruvim Lipyanskiˇı\n\nReferences [1] G. Bergman and J. Lewin. The semigroup of ideals of a ﬁr is (usually) free. J. London Math.

[18, 20, 32, 46, 47, 50, 54, 65, 66, 86]. If one takes into account that a representation is a two-sorted algebraic system (a pair) then the systematics of representations is facilitated. The book [35] is\n\n20\n\nC HAPTER I. REPRESENTATIONS OF SEMIGROUPS AND ALGEBRAS\n\nwritten from this point of view, and, furthermore, there is visible evidence of this in the note [57] and in the survey [41]. The naturality and usefulness of the study of classes of algebraic systems has often been emphasized by A. I. Mal’cev; for example, in [30]. The reduction of classes to “simpler” ones is one of the fundamental problems of this direction; as an example, let us mention the result of A. L. Shmel’kin and Neumanns 2 on the freedom of the semigroup of varieties of groups ([34, Theorem 23.4]). The problem of decomposition has always been an essential ingredient of every theory of representations: the classical theory of reduction to irreducible linear representations of a ﬁxed group (§14 in the book [48] by D. A. Suprunenko) or the reduction to indecomposable varieties of representations with a variable group (the paper [43] by B. I. Plotkin and A. S. Grinberg, as an example). Indecomposable classes as “simplest blocks” in a given theory can not be reduced to simpler classes and have to be studied separately. On the other hand, for the reduction to indecomposable classes one needs tools for doing the decomposition. In the theory of varieties of groups this role is played by the wreath product of groups, and in the case of representations with a variable group the construction of the triangular -product of group representations. According to B. I. Plotkin [36], the pair (G, Γ) is the triangular product of its subpairs (A, Σ1 ) and (B, Σ2 ) if the following conditions are fulﬁlled: (1) for the subgroup Σ = {Σ1 , Σ2 } ≤ Γ, generated by two subgroups Σ1 and Σ2 , the subpair (G, Σ) decomposes into the direct product of its subpairs (A, Σ1 ) and (B, Σ2 ); (2) in the group Γ there exists a normal subgroup Φ such that the subrepresentation (G, Φ) is faithful, and the image of Φ in Aut G coincides with the centralizer of the series 0 ⊂ A ⊂ G, that is, it acts as identity on each factor of this series; (3) the group Γ coincides with the semi-direct product Φ Σ. The object of this thesis is the study of the triangular product and its applications. It consists of two parts. The goal of the ﬁrst part (Sections 3.1 and 3.2) is to ﬁnd the -construction for representations of semigroups and algebras, to study the properties of these tools and their application to the decomposition of the varieties of the corresponding representations. In the second part (Section 3.3) the triangular product is applied to the study of the powers of the fundamental ideal of group rings. Representations by endomorphisms of modules, semigroups and algebras have been the subject of many studies by A. V. Mihalev [33] and L. M. Gluskin [10]. On the other hand, the representations of rings by endomorphisms of Z-modules is a classical research topic. The tendency towards a category-theoretic formulation of the classiﬁcation of representations makes urgent the problem of the decomposition of classes of representations of various algebraic objects (groups, semigroups, algebras etc.), as the elaboration of a general theory requires the understanding of the possible deviations and its leading to a coherent series of notions, constructions, and results. This is one of the reasons why the introduction and the study of tools of decomposition of representations of semigroups and algebras deserve attention. The known difﬁculties for carrying over results for groups and their representations to semigroups increases the interest for cases and ways where it is possible; concerning that see [24, Chapter 7]. 2 Editors’ note. Three well-known group-theorists: Bernhard and Hanna Neumann and their son Peter M. Neumann\n\n3. Triangular products and stability of representations\n\n21\n\nThe essential results of the ﬁrst part of this thesis concern the search for suitable constructions for representations of semigroups and algebras, the study of several their properties, and further the establishing of connections between these new constructions with the triangular products of representations of groups. There exists a cryptomorphism (in the sense of G. Birkhoff [58]) of the three constructions mentioned, although even their deﬁnitions are quite different, and, as a result, sometimes there are considerable differences in the proofs of properties. The varieties of representations of the semigroups admit an associative multiplication and the corresponding semigroup is factorial. This follows from the main result of Section 3.2, Theorem 3.33 about the generating representations. Such results are also obtained for algebras (Theorem 3.43 and Theorem 3.44). The role of the -constructions, introduced in Section 3.1, in the proof of these facts is analogous to the role of the wreath product in the proof of the above mentioned grouptheoretic theorem of Shmel’kin and Neumanns. For the theorem on freedom of the semigroup of varieties of linear representations of semigroups there is also a proof in terms of the semigroup ring of the free countably generated monoid; the extract of the reasoning needed is well-known from [56]. Among the consequences of the theorem on generating representations of algebras (Theorem 3.43) let us mention the theorem of Bergman and Lewin on the freedom of the semigroup of T -ideals, which in [56] is proved by means of the theory of FI-rings of Cohn [5]. Here the corresponding fact is interpreted as a statement about the freedom of the semigroup of varieties of representations of algebras, and in this form it readily follows from Theorem 3.43. The given approach, however, allows to penetrate more deeply into the essence of the matter. For example, for given ﬁnite dimensional (over a ﬁxed ﬁeld K) pairs (A, Σ1 ) and (B, Σ2 ) the identities for the variety Var(A, Σ1 )·Var(B, Σ2 ) are readily found, these are exactly the identities for Var(G, Γ), where (G, Γ) = (A, Σ1 ) (B, Σ2 ). This might be rather difﬁcult to obtain such a result by means of multiplication of T -ideals. There are also other applications of the material in Section 3.2 concerning representations of algebras in the theory of associative algebras themselves. Let us mention a necessary condition for the indecomposability of a variety of algebras (Theorem 3.49). The technique developed in the ﬁrst part of this thesis is tightly connected with automata theory [31]. After the interaction of this discipline with the theory of algebras (V. M. Glushkov [9]) an essential result was established, that is the theory of decomposition of ﬁnite automata. Nowadays algebraic methods in automata theory are developing rather intensively; cf. [18], [42], [65], [45] etc., and furthermore in Eilenbergs’ book [66] there is given a detailed analysis of the corresponding methods in a modern presentation. The present author has introduced the semigroup of varieties of linear automata and has given a description of it in the language of pairs of “consistent” ideals in the free countably generated associative algebra (over the given ﬁeld), which gives the possibility to establish interesting properties of this semigroup (Theorem 3.37). Since the very beginning of the theory of group representations a major role have been played by the group and semigroup algebras. In this connection it was observed that the application of the ideas and methods of the (general) theory of algebras and their representations to group algebras was fertile and even the group algebras themselves turned out to be a subtle tool of calculation in the study of the structure of groups. The papers [81,98–100] convince of the great heuristic value of group and semigroup algebras\n\n22\n\nC HAPTER I. REPRESENTATIONS OF SEMIGROUPS AND ALGEBRAS\n\nin Combinatorics. The situation here reminds the one in Number Theory, where for the achievement of many deep facts on integers one applies algebraic and analytic methods. The main goal of Section 3.3 of this dissertation is the study of an issue of the of the powers of the fundamental ideal of an integral groups ring stabilization, which is already being deeply investigated for more than a decade, cf., for example the survey A. V. Mihalev and A. E. Zaleskiˇı [51], the lectures by A. A. Bovdi [3] or the book by D. Passman [96]. Our choice of subject was stimulated by the deep and beautiful work of A. I. Mal’cev [27], K. Gruenberg [69] and B. Hartley [77], where the special role of nilpotence in this circle of ideas is likewise clearly set forth. In Sections 3.3.1–3.3.3 the possible values of terminal are found for Artinian groups and the limit of ﬁnite groups is calculated. These results of the papers [13, 14] have been obtained independently and by other methods, and were in part generalized by Gruenberg and Roseblade [71], Sandling [102] and Hartley [80]. In Section 3.3 the methods of [13, 14] are developed, using moreover systematically the language and technique of the general theory of group representations, and, furthermore, a circle of ideas connected with the well-known theorem of L. A. Kaluzhnin [84] on nilpotence of a group, acting faithfully and stably on a ﬁnite invariant series of another group, and some applications of it. The elements of such an approach were set forth by Hartley [76], but he uses it only for the interpretation of some results. Due to mentioned approach, a self-developed presentation, and in several cases a generalization and a considerable simpliﬁcation of the proofs in [14, 71, 80] are achieved. The paper [26] of A. I. Mal’cev on the possibility of embedding semigroups into a group gave rise to a well-known cycle of developments, in particular, there appeared results, that are at the ﬁrst glance not connected with stability. Given the goal for ﬁnding “good” classes of semigroups with cancellation embeddable in a group, A. I. Mal’cev has found in [28] a notion of nilpotence for semigroups such that each such semigroup with cancellation is embeddable in a nilpotent group. Up to now the interest for this notion has not been considerable. The present author has made an attempt to unify the results of [28] with the above mentioned theorem of Kaluzhnin. This leads to the necessity of reconsidering the notion of stability for semigroups of endomorphisms. This question, and further some properties of semigroup rings of locally nilpotent (in the sense of Mal’cev) semigroups are treated in Section 3.3.4. The papers [11–17] have been published on the theme of this dissertation. The main results have been communicated at the XI All Union Algebraic Colloquium (Kishinev, 1971); the All Union Symposium on Ring Theory, Algebras and Modules (Kääriku, 1976); at the Algebra Seminar of Tartu State University; at the Riga Algebra Seminar; at the the Seminars of Higher Algebra and Rings and Modules at Moscow State University; and at the Minsk Algebra Seminar. Twice the material of the two ﬁrst sections was used in a special lecture course in automata theory presented by the author himself at Tartu State University; the main contents of this course were set forth at the III Regional Conference-Seminar of leading lecturers of mathematics of the Belorussian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian Soviet Republics and the Kaliningrad Oblast of the Soviet Union (Minsk, 1977).

Triangular products and stability of representations\n\n23\n\n3.1. The triangular products This section has a preparatory character. First of all, here we treat representations as two-sorted entities (pairs) and carry over the corresponding deﬁnitions to the case when the acting object of a pair is a semigroup or an associative algebra. The main object of the section is the introduction of the triangular product of representations of semigroups and algebras and the study of their properties and connections. Applications of the frame of notions considered are given in the Sections 3.2–3.3. We underline that although the main constructions and notions of this section can be introduced for an arbitrary associative and commutative unitary ring K, we prefer to restrict ourselves in the ﬁrst two sections because of reasons of organization, to the case when K is a ﬁeld. 3.1.1. Triangular products of group representations 1. The object of this ﬁrst section is preparatory, to acquaint the Reader with the notion of triangular product for group pairs. This construction turns out to be useful for us also in our study of the fundamental ideal of group rings in Section 3.3, but, in the ﬁrst place, it serves as a model for analogous constructions of the triangular product of representations of semigroups and algebras. 2. Let A and B be any two groups. The set AB of all functions B → A forms a group on which B acts according to the formula ∀ x,\n\nb ∈ B,\n\nf ∈ AB ,\n\n(f ◦ b)(x) = f (xb−1 ).\n\nThere arises the pair (AB , B). We accompany this pair with the semi-direct product AB B which will be called the (complete) wreath product of A and B, and denoted AwrB. Let us ﬁx an associative-commutative ring K, for example K = Z and let Γ be an arbitrary group. If there is given a representation of Γ by automorphisms of a certain K-module G, then one speaks on the (group) pair (G, Γ). Let (A, Σ1 ) and (B, Σ2 ) be any two group pairs, and let Φ = HomK (A, B) be the module of all K-homomorphisms of B into A. Deﬁning an action of the groups Σ1 and Σ2 on Φ respectively by the formulae ∀ x ∈ B,\n\nσ1 ∈ Σ1 ,\n\nϕ ∈ Φ,\n\n(ϕ ◦ σ1 )(x) = ϕ(x) ◦ σ1\n\nand\n\n∀ x ∈ B, σ2 ∈ Σ2 , ϕ ∈ Φ, (ϕ ◦ σ2 )(x) = ϕ(x ◦ σ2−1 ) we arrive at the pairs (Φ, Σ1 ) and (Φ, Σ2 ). Moreover, as the actions of Σ1 and Σ2 are permutable on Φ, we can now deﬁne the pair (Φ, Σ1 × Σ2 ) to which corresponds the group Γ = Φ Σ1 × Σ2 , where the initial groups Φ and Σ1 × Σ2 are embedded, ¯ = {φ¯ = (φ, 1)|ϕ ∈ Φ} ⊂ Γ, Φ→Φ while the group Σ1 × Σ2 can be identiﬁed with its image in Γ via the map (σ1 , σ2 ) → ¯ Σ1 × Σ2 there corresponds the pair (Φ, ¯ Σ1 × (ε, σ1 σ2 ). To the semi-direct product Φ ¯ It Σ2 ), the representation of the group Σ1 × Σ2 by inner automorphisms of the group Φ. ∼ ¯ is easy to convince oneself that (Φ, Σ1 × Σ2 ) = (Φ, Σ1 × Σ2 ). Let G = A ⊕ B and let us deﬁne the pair (G, Φ). To this end we consider in G the series of submodules 0 ⊂ A ⊂ G. In the group Aut G we introduce the centralizer Z\n\n24\n\nC HAPTER I. REPRESENTATIONS OF SEMIGROUPS AND ALGEBRAS\n\nof this series, that is, all automorphisms that act as identities of A and G/A. T"
