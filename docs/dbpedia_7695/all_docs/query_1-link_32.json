        "text": "In 1885 Karl Weierstrass wrote down his most famous theorem often referred to as the \"Stone-Weierstrass Theorem\" in analysis textbooks. The theorem itself is the quintessential constructive theorem and as it turns out, can be proved using very different approaches; this makes the theorem elegant as well as perfect for broadening ones purview of maths.\n\nOne is hard pressed to not run into the name Weierstrass in the analysis field, and for good reason. There are a multitude of results and methods a second-semester calculus student might read penned by him. Interestingly, the man had apprehensions about studying mathematics and only after \"four years of intensive fencing and drinking\" [1] did Weierstrass formally pursue mathematics. Refreshingly enough there seems to exist some kind of modern type of soul-searching and purpose-seeking in the story of Weierstrass.\n\nThe Problem and Quick Solution\n\nThe interesting question posed from here, is can one find a polynomial (a nice function) to approximate such a horrendous function as Figure 1? A classic problem first seen in second semester calculus, we want to defer, out of sheer hardness of the current function, to a set of \"nicer\" functions. I define \"nicer\" for my students here to mean differentiation and integration both become trivial when considering simple polynomials. This is quite the problem! How is one to pull an approximant (or sequence of approximants) out of thin air?\n\nAs u is entire for positive time it is real-analytic, whence it can be represented by a Taylor series. This Taylor series can be truncated to get an arbitrarily ordered polynomial approximation to f by taking the limit as t goes to 0 (time shrinks back to not melting the function). This convergence is uniform on compact subsets of real numbers and so is pointwise everywhere.\n\nReferences\n\nThis biography of Weierstrass\n\nApproximation Theory and Approximation Practice - Nick Trefethen\n\nK R Biermann, Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography (New York 1970-1990)."
