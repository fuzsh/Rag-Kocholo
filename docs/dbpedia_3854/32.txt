At the YMCA the other day I met a man who had a US Navy Korean War Veteran hat and I asked him what ship he was on. He stated he was a Cargo Ammunition Ship taking ammo from Japan to Korea. I said at least he didn't have to worry about being sunk by a Sub, was I wrong?.

He said they only worried that the ammo stayed stable.

Neither N. or S. Korea had a Navy of any consequence to attack the NATO fleet, but that doesn't mean that Russia or China didn't have that capability.

Am pretty sure that if Russia/China had attacked one of our ships, that a continuation of WWII would have ensued. It's kind of surprising that it didn't happen.

On a similar note, I found it surprising how many lives were lost on both sides in the Korean War. Upwards of 600,000 dead and nearly 1,000,000 wounded, not to mention the ~2.5 million civilians killed. I'm astounded. See:
