        "text": "SOUTHFIELD (WWJ)- A Detroit man missing in action from the Korean War has been identified and will be buried with full military honors.\n\nThe Department of Defense POW/Missing Personnel Office announced Monday that the remains of Army Cpl. A.V. Scott, 27, of Detroit, will be buried June 22 at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe Pentagon says in February 1951, Scott's unit, the 503rd Field Artillery Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division, was supplying friendly forces approximately 70 miles east of Seoul, South Korea, when Chinese Communist units attacked the area. Scott was captured by enemy forces and marched north to a prisoner of war camp in Suan County, North Korea.\n\nSurviving POWs within the camp reported Scott died in April 1951.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1994, North Korea gave the United States 208 boxes of remains believed to contain the remains of 200-400 U.S. servicemen. North Korean documents turned over with one of the boxes indicated the remains were exhumed near Suan County, which correlates with Scott's last known location.\n\nScientists used dental comparisons and the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory used\n\nmitochondrial DNA – which matched that of Scott's cousins—in the identification.\n\nMore than 2,000 servicemen died as prisoners of war during the Korean War. 7,993 service members still remain missing from the war."
