        "text": "The civilian toll in both North and South Korea was high: Around 990,000 in South Korea, and over 1,500,000 for North Korea. But this is not included in military casualty list. There was much death on both sides. Brothers murdering brothers.\n\nThe South Korean army was running by a bunch of green bugs, they have suffered much higher casualties than the US army.\n\nThe US army itself has lost more than 60000 men, so I have highly doubted over these Korean sources.\n\nSince the memorial site in the UN has proven otherwise.\n\nMaybe it is only the western countries which excluded South Korea itself.\n\nSince South Korea has suffered the tremendously heavy casualties during the Korean War.\n\nI've read works on the Chinese side during this war. It was sad to read that many of the Chinese recruits sent to help North Korean People's Army were new recruited draftees. Their sacrifice in defense of China is great, but I am saddened to have read the letters and stories of the mothers of these young Chinese recruits who died in a foreign land for foreign people. The pain of mothers in knowing their baby boys being buried in mass graves, with no formal tomb stones that marks their names.\n\nMany young Koreans, Chinese, Americans, Turks, French, British, and other host of UN volunteers died in this war. May their souls rest in peace...\n\nKorea's growth and expansion throughout the years has been awesome. We Pakistanis can learn much from them.\n\nWhat I see here is an Asia beset with distrust, barbarism and assertiveness. Every nation in Asia almost has or has had beef with each other which makes us the most divided continent.\n\nChina has disputes with Vietnam, South Korea, India and vice versa.\n\nIndia has enmity against Pakistan while Bengalee's dislike Indians and vice versa\n\nWe should appreciate China, India or whoever does good not because they are from that country but because we are all human. I believe it will be much harder for us to build up an Asian union modeled on the Euro nations. My point is look at how much all those fought in the past and yet they have an organization like the EU and the people of Europe cooperating there throughout.\n\nWe Pakistani Indians and Chinese should build a better relationship for our people. +we all might need to because a hegemonic world power is keen to see us disgraced and weak. No one wants US bases in their nations.\n\nYet these bases and American troops on the ground remain there. To counter the US China should be enough but it will take time to outrace them.\n\nI've read works on the Chinese side during this war. It was sad to read that many of the Chinese recruits sent to help North Korean People's Army were new recruited draftees. Their sacrifice in defense of China is great, but I am saddened to have read the letters and stories of the mothers of these young Chinese recruits who died in a foreign land for foreign people. The pain of mothers in knowing their baby boys being buried in mass graves, with no formal tomb stones that marks their names.\n\nMany young Koreans, Chinese, Americans, Turks, French, British, and other host of UN volunteers died in this war. May their souls rest in peace...\n\nSometimes I wonder how many lives were sacrificed for the \"prevention\" policy of US. Sometimes the world should just sit and watch. Because if other nations interfere we get the same results with much larger death tolls."
