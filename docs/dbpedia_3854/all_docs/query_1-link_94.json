You are charged $5 for each additional replacement card. When you or your EBT alternate cardholder requests 3 or more replacement EBT cards within a 12-month period, you will be issued a replacement card, but you may not be able to use it until you make contact to explain the reason for the replacement EBT card request.\n\nProtect Your Benefits: Arizona EBT cards are NOT insured.\n\nYou are responsible for your EBT Card, Personal Identification Number (PIN), and the use of your benefits. KEEP YOUR PIN PRIVATE! Please read the following guide for help with selecting your pin:\n\nHow to Use Your Arizona EBT Card - English (FAA-1045A)\n\nHow to Use Your Arizona EBT Card - Spanish (FAA-1045A-S)\n\nHere are some tips to help keep your benefits safe:\n\nFreeze your electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card when not in use through ebtedge.com or through the ebtEDGE mobile app\n\nDo not treat an EBT card like a savings account. The EBT card is not insured.\n\nDon’t keep a large balance in your EBT account.\n\nKeep your PIN a secret.\n\nTry and change your PIN the day before your benefits become available each and every month.\n\nYou can change your PIN by calling the FIS Customer Service line at 1-888-997-9333, using the FIS mobile app ebtEDGE (available on Google Play and Apple App Stores), or online at www.ebtedge.com.\n\nShare what you know and be a part of the solution. Provide us any information about persons or websites selling EBT cards:\n\nDES Fraud Line: (800) 251-2436\n\nReport fraud online\n\nFederal law now allows states to protect and replace stolen Nutrition Assistance (NA) and TANF Cash Assistance benefits due to electronic benefit theft such as card skimming, card cloning, and phishing scams. On June 19, 2023, DES began accepting and processing requests for the replacement of stolen NA, CA, Grant Diversion (GD) or Hopi Tribal TANF benefits. View the Arizona State Plan.\n\nHouseholds are potentially eligible for a replacement when the electronic benefit theft is reported within 45 calendar days from the date of the theft.\n\nTo report and request a replacement of stolen benefits, you, a household member, or Authorized Representative may complete and sign one of following forms:\n\nElectronic Benefit Theft Replacement Request Form - English (FAA-1847A)\n\nElectronic Benefit Theft Replacement Request Form - Spanish (FAA-1847A-S)\n\nSubmit your request by any of the following ways:\n\nPreferred:\n\nMail:\n\nDepartment of Economic Security\n\nPO Box 19009\n\nPhoenix, AZ 85005-9009\n\nFax: (602) 257- 7031 or toll free to 1 (844) 680-9840\n\nIn person: At any FAA Office. Use the office locator to find an office near you.\n\nAlternative:\n\nCall: 1 (833) 786 - 8823, Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.\n\nHouseholds have the right to file an appeal if they disagree with the action or inaction of DES. Households are not eligible for replacement of their stolen benefits while the appeal is pending.\n\nIf your household experienced electronic benefit theft, ensure that the compromised Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card is replaced. You or your authorized representative can call the Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) at 1-888-997-9333 (TTY: 1-800-367-8939) or walk into an FAA office to request a replacement. In these instances, DES waives the replacement fee.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nAfter I submit a claim, when will I receive replacement benefits if it’s approved?\n\nArizona will process claims reporting losses that occurred on or after June 19, 2023 within 10 business days of receiving a completed and signed request.\n\nDES will send you a notice once your claim has been processed and replacement benefits have been issued. Sign up today for electronic notifications through MyFamilyBenefits, which is, on average, approximately 5 days faster than waiting for U.S. mail.\n\nWhat if my claim is not approved but I believe I am entitled to replacement benefits?\n\nHouseholds have the right to file an appeal if they disagree with the action or inaction of DES. Households are not eligible for replacement of their stolen benefits while the appeal is pending.\n\nHow much am I eligible to receive as replacement benefits?\n\nReplacement benefits due to electronic benefit theft cannot exceed the amount of two months of benefits or the amount of my actual reported loss, whichever is less.\n\nHow will I receive replacement benefits?\n\nReplacement benefits will transfer back to the EBT card, unless that card has been compromised and you haven’t replaced your card already; in those cases, the compromised EBT card will be deactivated and the household will receive a replacement EBT card within the process timeliness standards mentioned above. If a replacement EBT card is needed more quickly, you can visit a local FAA office.\n\nMy benefits were stolen prior to this announcement. Am I eligible for replacement benefits?\n\nHouseholds are potentially eligible for a replacement when the electronic benefit theft is reported within 45 calendar days from the date of the theft.\n\nI received SNAP benefits from another state, but my benefits were stolen in Arizona. Are you able to replace my stolen benefits?\n\nIndividuals who received SNAP benefits from another state will need to contact their respective state programs regarding the replacement of benefits, as DES can only replace benefits issued by Arizona, regardless of where the theft occurred.\n\nHow long will DES be able to process and provide replacement benefits?\n\nThis program is currently scheduled to end September 30, 2024."
