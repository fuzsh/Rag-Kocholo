        "text": "Virginia Military Dead Database Introduction\n\nThe index contains the following information on approximately 54,628 Virginians:\n\nName with Prefix and/or Suffix\n\nRank, Unit (Company, Regiment, Ship, Squadron, etc.)\n\nBranch of Service (Army, Navy, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, Merchant Marine, Red Cross, etc.)\n\nConflict (See Conflict Codes list for an explanation of the codes appearing in this column.)\n\nRace, Gender\n\nDate, Place, and Cause of Death (See Cause of Death list for an explanation of the codes appearing in this column.)\n\nResidence (Town/City/County)\n\nSource(s) of Data\n\nNotes/Additional Information (e.g., alternative residence, burial location, conflicting information, etc.)\n\nLinks to Other Sources\n\nEntries in the index use historical terminology found in the original records, including outdated and offensive terms related to race and ethnicity.\n\nThis index has been compiled from approximately 1,120 sources. Inevitably, some of these sources conflict with one another. Obvious errors have been corrected. The absence of data from any field has no meaning except that the information was not found in the cited sources.\n\nAs of December 2014, updates are no longer being made to the database. Contact Library Reference Services with questions or error reports.\n\n* Sources for these conflicts are shared and appear on a combined Sources List.\n\n** Sources for these conflicts are shared and appear on a combined Sources List.\n\n*** Sources for these conflicts are shared and appear on a combined Sources List.\n\nFrench & Indian War, 1754–1763\n\n163 Virginia military deaths have been identified in this conflict between the British, French, and their respective Indigenous allies. Many more Virginia civilians also died.\n\nDunmore’s War, 1774\n\n48 Virginian deaths have been identified in this conflict between the Colony of Virginia and Native American groups in the Ohio Valley.\n\nConflicts With Indigenous Peoples\n\nFollowing the arrival of Europeans in Virginia, centuries of armed conflict ensued between European settlers and Indigenous peoples defending their sovereignty. This index identifies 47 Virginians who died in violent conflicts between Europeans and Native groups. A few Native Virginian deaths were included by the original indexer, but this tally represents a small fraction of the Native Virginian deaths that resulted from European colonialism.\n\nAmerican Revolution, 1775–1783\n\n1,675 Virginians who died in the American Revolution have been identified.\n\nWar of 1812, 1812–1815\n\nAction in Virginia during the War of 1812 included Britain's attempt in June 1813 to capture Norfolk and numerous raids on Virginia towns and plantations on the Chesapeake Bay. The constant threat of attack kept Virginia militia active throughout the war. We have identified 825 Virginians who died during this war.\n\nFor further information, consult Virginia's Participation in the War of 1812: Selected Resources in the Library of Virginia.\n\nSeminole Wars, 1812–1818, 1835–1842, 1855–1858\n\nThese wars represented the United States' effort to acquire Florida from Spain and forcibly remove the Seminole population. Some Virginians in the regular army participated; of these, 31 Virginian deaths have been identified.\n\nTexas Revolution, 1836\n\nIn 1836, native–born Texans joined with settlers from the United States to initiate an armed rebellion against the Mexican government, culminating in the formation of an independent Texan state. This index identifies 16 Virginians killed at the Alamo, seven more killed later at Goliad, and six killed elsewhere.\n\nMexican War, 1846–1848\n\nThe Mexican War was a conflict between the United States and Mexico that followed the U.S. annexation of Texas.

The database includes the names of 15 Virginia sailors killed or missing in action as a result of the explosion of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898, although these deaths were likely the result of an accident, not Spanish action as was claimed at the time.\n\nThe most common cause of death for Virginia soldiers during the Spanish-American War was disease. Only one Virginian is known to have been killed in action during the Spanish-American War. There are several cases in which only the date and not the cause of death is known.\n\nFor further information, consult \"Virginia’s Participation in the Spanish American War, 1898; the Philippine–American War, 1899–1901; and the China Relief Expedition, 1900–1901: Selected Resources in the Library of Virginia” (pdf).\n\nPhilippine–American War, 1899–1902\n\nAfter the Philippines was transferred from Spain to the United States, the United States refused to recognize Filipino independence. The Philippine-American War followed. 52 Virginia military deaths have been identified during this period. Of those, the Philippines is the place of death for only five. In many cases the place of death and place of residence were not recorded.\n\nFor further information, consult \"Virginia’s Participation in the Spanish American War, 1898; the Philippine–American War, 1899–1901; and the China Relief Expedition, 1900–1901: Selected Resources in the Library of Virginia” (pdf).\n\nMexican Border Punitive Expedition, 1916–1917\n\nThis conflict was an unsuccessful attempt to capture the Mexican revolutionary Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa, after Villa's forces attacked a town in New Mexico.
