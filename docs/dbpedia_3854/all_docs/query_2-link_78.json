        "text": "There are a number of sources from which casualty statistics can be drawn. The figures below, the number of deaths as a result of service with Australian units, are derived from the Roll of Honour.\n\nQuestions of eligibility for the Roll of Honour are determined solely by the Memorial’s Council, and have been considered many times over the years by Council and before it by the Memorial’s Board. When a name has been approved by Council as eligible for addition to the Roll of Honour for a current conflict, that name is added on Remembrance Day each year.\n\nConflict Dates of conflict[1] Number of deaths New Zealand 1860–61 Nil Sudan 1885 9 South Africa 11 October 1899 to 31 May 1902 593 China 6 August 1900 to 25 April 1901 6 First World War 4 August 1914 to 31 March 1921 61,678 Second World War 3 September 1939 to 30 June 1947 39,657 Australia (North Queensland Coast, bomb and mine clearance) 1947–50 4 Japan (British Commonwealth Occupation Force) 1945-52 43 Papua and New Guinea 1947-75 13 Middle East (UNTSO; Operation Paladin) 1948 1 Berlin Airlift 1948-49 1 Malayan Emergency 16 June 1948 to 31 July 1960 39 Kashmir\n\n(United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan) 1948-85 1 Korean War 27 June 1950 to 27 July 1953 340 Malta 1952-55 3 Korean War (Post-Armistice service - ceasefire monitoring) 1953-57 16 Southeast Asia (SEATO) 1955-75 12 Indonesian Confrontation 24 December 1962 to 11 August 1966 22 Malay Peninsula 19 February 1964 to 11 August 1966 2 Vietnam War 3 August 1962 to 29 April 1975 523 Thailand 25 June 1965 to 31 August 1968 2 Irian Jaya Operation Cenderawasih) 1976-81 1 Western Sahara (MINURSO) 1991-94 1 Somalia 20 October 1992 to 30 November 1994 1 Border Protection 1997 - 4 Bougainville 1997-2003 1 East Timor (Operations Faber to Citadel) 1999 to 2003 3 East Timor (Operations Spire to Astute) 2004-2013 2 Afghanistan 11 October 2001 to 8 October 2021 47[2] Iraq 16 July 2003 to 14 December 2013 4 Solomon Island (RAMSI - Operation Anode) 2003-13 1 Indonesia (Operation Sumatra Assist) 2005 9 Fiji 2006 2 Greater Middle East 2014 - 3 Total\n\n103,021"
