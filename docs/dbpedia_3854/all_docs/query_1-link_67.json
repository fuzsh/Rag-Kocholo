        "text": "ROCK FALLS, Ill. (KWQC/Gray News) - After more than seven decades, a young soldier from Illinois who went missing during the Korean War was finally brought home.\n\nArmy Cpl. Richard Seloover was laid to rest 74 years after his death during the Korean War at a cemetery in Rock Falls. His family and community gathered to give him the farewell he deserved.\n\n“His mother regretted signing for him because he wasn’t of age. And if she hadn’t signed, he couldn’t have gone,” Selvooer’s half-sister, Janice Fischer Rupp, said.\n\nSeloover went MIA on Sept. 6, 1950, at the age of 17 during a fierce battle along the Naktong River in South Korea.\n\n“He was going to join the service and see the world is what he went in for. And then Korea broke out and he got his basic training on a ship over to Korea and never came home,” Rupp said.\n\nHis family held onto the hope that he would be found one day.\n\n“For years they couldn’t search in North Korea because North Korea wouldn’t allow it. So come to find out he was located two months after he was killed, but he had no dog tags or any identifying marks. So, he’s been an unknown for 74 years,” Dave Rupp, Seloover’s brother-in-law, said.\n\nThe family’s hope turned into reality in June 2021 when Seloover’s remains were exhumed from the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, also known as the Punchbowl, in Honolulu.\n\nAfter spending years in a grave labeled unknown X-348, Seloover was accounted for on Jan. 10 after scientists at the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) identified his remains.\n\nThrough DNA testing, along with dental and anthropological analysis, a chest radiograph, and circumstantial evidence, scientists at the DPAA were able to narrow it down to three possible matches.\n\n“And out of those three soldiers, he’s the only one to fit 17 years old, the stature and everything so it was him,” Dave Rupp said.\n\nSeloover’s remains were returned to Rock Falls on May 30, bringing closure to his family after decades of uncertainty.\n\n“I wanted him to be put with my mother,” Janice Rupp said. “And he’s put with my mother. So she got reunited with him because she signed for him to go in. She never forgave herself. So now, they’re back together.”\n\nJanice Rupp said the fact that Seloover and his mother have been reunited gives her a great sense of peace.\n\nJanice Rupp said she was only 5 years old when her brother joined the Army, but she always made sure the government knew her relation to him.\n\n“I’m the last living person, so when I pass away, there will be nobody left to find,” Janice Rupp said. “Therefore, I made sure to inform the government officials.”\n\nThe procession for Seloover took place at Coloma Township Cemetery as the national anthem played. The ceremony included a flag folding, a three-volley salute, and the playing of Taps.\n\nSeloover is one of thousands of names inscribed at the Courts of the Missing in the National Cemetery of the Pacific, honoring those missing from the Korean War."
