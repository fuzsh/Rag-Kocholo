        "text": "Was it worth It??? I don’t think so. We have never fought a war since WWII, that we intended to win. It’s very easy for politicians to order American Military to fight, because they don’t have too. Then everything becomes a stalemate, and more Americans die while they decide what to do. In this era just look at Iraq, that war was won, now it’s lost. Someone’s EGO.\n\nTOMC RM2 73-76"
