Alger Hiss was discovered to be a communist by the HUAC in the 1930s Hiss was the epitome of communists (lawyer, Harvard, worked for.\"— Presentation transcript:\n\n1 Killian Petetti\n\n2 Alger Hiss was discovered to be a communist by the HUAC in the 1930s Hiss was the epitome of communists (lawyer, Harvard, worked for FDR, etc.) Hiss denied all of the claims He was seen innocent by liberals but not conservatives Truman denounced Chamber’s allegation as a “red hearing” Facts\n\n3 Chambers also blamed him of espionage Hiss gave Chambers gov’t documents and he kept them Hiss was charged with perjury Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested for espionage charges Some Americans found them to be innocent but they were sentenced to death In 1990, Soviet documents prove Julius did espionage Facts\n\n4 The Cold War scared many Americans and it made many people worried about espionage. People who had any suspicious activity were put on trial to see if they were communists or Soviet spies. People were even able to be put to death. Summary\n\n5 Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers Julius and Ethel Rosenberg Key Terms\n\n6 Pics\n\n7\n\n8 What could of happened if we did not catch Julius Rosenburg? What secrets could he have stole? Would those secrets have risked national saftey? Discussion Question\n\n9 Alger Hiss and The Rosenburgs By: Jack Brown\n\n10 Alger Hiss He was an American lawyer, government official, lecturer, and author Accused of being a Soviet spy Convicted of purgery Whittaker Chambers (former communist) testified that Hiss was a communist but not a spy When Whittaker said this on the radio, Hiss filed a law suit Then Whittaker admitted to being involved in espionage with Hiss Sentenced to ten years in prison Died after 3 years and always claimed to by innocent\n\n11 The Rosenburgs Charged with espionage Accused of giving info about nuclear weapons to Soviets The hard evidence that confirmed that Julius Rosenburg was a spy was only let out in 1995 Decoded Soviet cables are what confirmed the espionage Cables did not prove Ethel Rosenburg guilty She was executed anyway Entire trial consisted of scientist Klaus Fuchs, Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and the Rosenburgs Only rosenburgs were executed because all other spy’s gave Americans info about the other spy’s\n\n12 Summary Both Alger Hiss and the Rosenburgs were registered American citizens accused with espionage. During the time of the cold war, the threat of a Soviet attack made some paranoid accusations of espionage were flying left and right and some of the people who caught the bad end of it were Alger Hiss and the Rosenburgs. The conviction of these people only furthered the anxiety of a Soviet attack now with the Americans knowing that they cant trust anyone.\n\n13 Key Terms Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers- First two people to be involved with an espionage case Julius and Ethel Rosenburg- coconspirators in a wartime spy network\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16 Discussion Do you think the severity of the crimes committed were a little exaggerated due to it being a war-time? Was it right for Whittaker Chambers to not be charged while Hiss went to prison?\n\n17 LOYALTY AND SECURITY &THE ANTICOMMUNIST CRUSADE BY: SAMSON TESSEMA\n\n18 KEY TERMS House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) - Committee that held hearings to expose communist influence in American life\n\n19 FACTS The Communist Party claimed 80,000 members during World War II Truman issued Executive Order 9835, establishing the Federal Employee Loyalty Program People were fired for “Reasonable grounds for belief that the person is disloyal” 4.7 million jobholders and applicants underwent loyalty checks by 1952 Some people lost jobs for associating with radical friends or had once belonged to organizations now declared disloyal\n\n20 FACTS By the end of Truman’s presidency, 39 states had loyalty programs School teachers, professors, and state and city employees were forced to sign loyalty oaths The HUAC frightened the labor movement and made them avoid progressive causes The Supreme Court Case (Dennis v. United States) allowed the curtailment of freedom of speech for national security purposes The Communist Party was fading as the politicians magnified its threat\n\n21 SUMMARY Loyalty had a major impact on the everyday lives of millions of Americans. It scared many Americans and companies into background checks and many were fired because of loyalty. The First Amendment rights were violated but the Supreme Court ruled it okay because it was for national security purposes. Later, however, the Anticommunist Crusade was used a political tool to frame progressives as communists.\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24 DISCUSSION QUESTION Do you feel it was okay for the government to curtail freedom of speech for national security purposes?\n\n25 The Fair Deal & The politics of Anticommunism Kj McBride\n\n26 The Fair Deal Truman proposed a Fair deal agenda that included civil rights, health-care, and federal aid Based on the belief in continual economic growth Enacted the Displaced Persons act of 1948 Raised hourly minimum wage from 40 to 75 cents Increased social-security benefits and coverage Expanded appropriations for public power, conservation, and slum clearance Authorized the construction of nearly a million low- income houses\n\n27 The Politics of Anticommunism A second red scare began Some Americans concluded that the nations difficulties lay in domestic treason and subversion The House Un-American Activities committee served as a platform for right-wing denunciations of the new deal as a communist plot\n\n28 Summary The fair deal had many new provisions and aids for Americans and would help with many of Americas post war problems. The congress rejected a large portion of the deal and was afraid of communist plots involved. Many people and things were impaired in this period of time because of the fear of communism.\n\n29 Key Terms Fair Deal - an ambitious set of proposals put forward by United States President Harry S. Truman to the United States Congress in his January 1949 State of the Union address. Second Red Scare – AKA: McCarthyism - fear of communist espionage\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32 Discussion questions What issues were found in Truman's Fair Deal? What could be added or taken away from it to make it better? Why was everyone so afraid of the communists?\n\n33 Politics of Civil Rights & Election of 1948 Morgan Gilmer\n\n34 Politics of Civil Rights War heightened expectations of African- Americans for equality Many pushed for fair employment and outlawing of lynching Southern whites reacted brutally Truman said he would act to help African Americans Established President’s Committee on Civil Rights\n\n35 Election of 1948 Considered the greatest election upset in American history Truman endorsed weak civil-rights bill to keep Southern support after founding President’s Committee on Civil Rights – Lost Democrat support because of anti-Soviet policies Eisenhower was urged to run but did not want to Dixiecrats– hoped to restore “southern way of life” Dewey decided to run in conservative manner because he already had many votes Truman took to the road to help rebuild the broken up Democrats Truman shockingly won the election\n\n36 Summary After World War II, African Americans returned hoping to have equal rights. They were met with protests and resistance from conservatives. Truman tried to help them, but he decided to run in 1948 with a weak Civil Rights plan to keep Southern support. Everyone expected the win in the election to go to Thomas Dewey, but Truman was reelected with help from the moderate Democrats because of global affairs and the radical ways of the opposing parties.\n\n37 Key Terms President’s Committee on Civil Rights\n\n38 Politics of Civil Rights\n\n39 Election of 1948\n\n40 Discussion What events and conditions in America allowed the moderate Truman to beat the radical Thomas Dewey in the election of 1948?\n\n41 The Truman Administration at Home, 1945- 1952 and The Eightieth Congress, 1947-1948 Miriam van der Spek\n\n42 Truman Facts Family and career, not public issues, interested most Americans. 2 nd and 3 rd generation white Americans began to reject liberals at the polls. Voters cared more about the growing crime rate and the decline in family authority than about the civil rights of African- Americans. They feared communist subversives, not the loss of civil liberties. Anticommunism was wanted, and people wanted victory in the Cold War, not a standstill like what was occurring.\n\n43 Congress Facts Massive post-war strikes created a national consensus for curbing union power. In 1947, more than 20 states passed laws restricting union activity and Congress passed the Taft-Hartly act (Labor- Management Relations Act). The act weakened organizing drives in the nonunion South and West (relocating labor intensive industries from Northeast and Midwest),and also drove leftists from CIO positions of power (weakening organized labor as a force for social justice). Truman vetoed the bill in hopes of gaining voters for the 1948 election, but Congress overrode his opposition. Congress defeated Democratic bill to raise the minimum wage and to provide federal funds for education and housing.\n\n44 Key Terms Truman none Congress Taft-Hartly Act\n\n45 Summery The Truman Administration sparked many new ideals. People in America began to worry more about themselves then the good overall. Conservative views began to replace the former liberal ones, and civil rights and unemployment no longer mattered. What they wanted was a victory in the Cold War, a decline in crime and a rise in family authority and lower taxes. They wanted an administration who would cost them little, and didn’t worry about whether justice was served or not. In the Eightieth Congress, many appeals from democrats were shot down, while congress worked to pass the Taft-Hartly Act, an act that would weaken unions and give the power to the government to call off any strike. Truman vetoed this bill, but was eventually over-ruled. Truman’s main reason for this was the want to be re-elected in the 1948 elections. His want for re-election also caused him to stress opposition for the Iron Curtain, over-rode objections of the state department, and widely offered sympathies to Holocaust and War survivors.\n\n46 Truman Administration Pictures\n\n47 The Eightieth Congress Pictures\n\n48 Discussion Question How did the Taft-Hartly Act affect America in the 1940s?\n\n49 THE KOREAN WAR JACK WHEATLEY\n\n50 Anti-Communist South Korean strength: 972,214 (326,863 Americans) Communist North Korean strength: 1,642,600 Lasted June 25 th, 1950-July 27 th,1983 First armed conflict in the global struggle between democracy and communism (Cold War) Gen. Douglas MacArthur was declared commander of the U.N. forces supporting South Korea, but was later replaced after publicly criticizing U.S. policy and threatening the Chinese with massive retaliation. FACTS\n\n51 South Korean strength dead/missing/wounded: 178,426 (33,741 American Deaths); 32,925; 566,434 North Korean strength: 367,283-750,282; 686,500-789,000 38 th parallel divided Korea into North and South territories, and was the location for much of the fighting War ended with Korean Armistice Agreement, signed in Panmunjom, which kept North and South Korea separate after war Also known as “Forgotten War,” “Fatherland Liberation War” in North Korea, “Six-Two-Five War” in South Korea, & “War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea” in China\n\n52 SUMMARY After World War II, Korea was divided across thirty-eighth parallel. The line divided the country into the American- supported Anti-Communist South Korea and the Soviet- supported Communist North Korea. On June 25 th 1950, North Korean troops invaded South Korean troops to capture the South Korean capital of Seoul. However, right as the UN Troops were cornered on the tip of a peninsula, at risk of falling into the sea, General Douglas MacArthur of the United States made a brilliant tactical move to provide help from the sea and push the North Koreans back. Within two weeks, the North Koreans had been pushed back all the way across the 38 th Parallel. MacArthur wanted to pursue the North Koreans all the way into their home country.\n\n53 SUMMARY, CONT’D With President Harry S. Truman being angry about the communism in North Korea, he gave the general consent. However, when the Chinese threatened to counterattack if the fighting raged past the Yalu River (Border between Korea and China), and did so, the South Korean strength suffered a major setback. Truman fired MacArthur for insubordination after he called for an escalation of the war while Truman wished to prevent a world war, not start one. However, the American citizens supported general MacArthur to get back at communism.\n\n54 SUMMARY, CONT’D However, the American citizens supported general MacArthur to get back at communism. In a lose-lose situation for Truman, the fighting raged on in a stalemate for two years until the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, separating Korea into North and South Korea across the 38 th Parallel (nothing had changed.) The whole war did not accomplish much, and cost the United States excess of $54 billion. It increased defense spending from $13 billion to $60 billion. The U.S. army more than doubled. And by agreeing to a military pact with Australia and New Zealand and committing itself to rearm Germany, the American dollars were flowing out like waterfalls. They were also covering nearly three- fourths of French war costs in Vietnam. The only main success for the U.S. is that they prevented some of the communism in North Korea.\n\n55 KEY TERMS Korean War 38 th Parallel and Communism also very important\n\n56\n\n57\n\n58 DISCUSSION QUESTION Who truly won the Korean War?? Why did the North Koreans cross the 38 th Parallel and attack the South Koreans in the first place??\n\n59 By: Josh Vergules\n\n60  The US tried to block communist influence in China and funded Nationalists efforts headed by Jiang Jieshi  US failed to stop communism in China and Mao Zedong established the Communist People’s Republic of China (PRC)  After Jiang’s defeat he and his regime collapsed and withdrew to Taiwan  The United Nations refused to recognize the PRC and proclaimed Jiang’s Nationalist regime in Taiwan the legitimate government of China\n\n61  In 1949 Soviets explode their first nuclear bomb  Americans panicked practiced air raid drills and built bomb shelters to protect them against a nuclear soviet attack  Truman ordered a crash program to build a fusion-based hydrogen bomb  In November 1952 the US detonated first Hydrogen bomb named “Mike”  Nine months later the soviets detonated their own Hydrogen bomb  Truman Called for a review of defense policies the secret report NSC-68, emphasized soviet strength the US tried to counteract this with a large army and a surplus of nuclear weapons\n\n62  This chapter talks about America’s war on communism starting with their failed attempt to reform china  The Chapter then shifts its focus to the increased tensions between USSR and the USA starting with the nuclear race and then a secret report which caused a enlargement of the US armed forces and Nuclear weapon supply\n\n63  Mao Zedong  NSC-68\n\n64\n\n65\n\n66  What would it be like if the Cold War with Russia resulted in Nuclear warfare, and what effect would it have on our daily life now?\n\n67 By: Garrett Cantor\n\n68 February 21, 1947 – Britain tells US they can no longer afford to help Turkey and Greece fight the communists March 12, 1947 – Truman asks for $400 million in military aid Congress set up DoD and CIA Germany divided into 4 zones, Berlin divided into 4 zones Stalin blockaded West Berlin Truman orders B-29 bombers to England Stalin ends blockade after US airlifts supplies US, Britain, and France end occupation of West Germany and allow the Federal Republic of Germany to form US forms NATO to protect West Europe from Russian attack Truman convinces Congress to set aside $1.3 billion for NATO countries and convinces Dwight Eisenhower to become Supreme Commander of NATO forces\n\n69  Starting in February of 1947, when Britain informed the US that it could no longer afford to fight the communist threat in Turkey and Greece, the United States became the “global policeman”. As the economies of Western Europe grinded to a halt, and the communists began to gain support for their cause, Truman decided that something had to be done. He convinced Congress to send $400 million In military assistance to Turkey and Greece to fight in the “universal struggle of freedom against tyranny.\n\n70  The Soviets response to American actions was to keep a watchful eye on Eastern Europe. As Western powers tried to unite their regions of Germany, the Soviets decided to lock down Berlin. Even though it was split into 4 parts, it was deep inside East Germany and the USSR decided to lock down any routes through their zone to Berlin. Truman ordered frequent air drops until this ended in 1949. After West Germany was officially its own nation, the United States, Canada, and Western European powers formed NATO to keep the Soviet Union at Bay.\n\n71 Truman Doctrine National Security Act of 1947 Marshall Plan Berlin Airlift North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\n\n72\n\n73\n\n74 Why was it necessary for Truman to call for the creation of NATO? Why did the United States feel the need to combat the communists in Greece and Turkey?\n\n75 Emily Higginson\n\n76 Joseph Stalin wanted to end the Soviet Union’s weakness of invasions from the west by having an military-free Germany and a line of nations friendly with Russia along the its western edge. Stalin wanted dominance in Eastern Europe and encouraged independent countries to turn to a communist government. Truman did not want to allow Soviet rule past Russia’s borders and opposed the idea of dictators. They could not get along so they stayed very separate from one another. The Cold war began when the Americans met up with the Soviets to celebrate the ending of Hitler’s ruling.\n\n77 The Soviet Union wanted to be separate from all non-communist areas. The Soviet Union was to the East of this “curtain” and on the West, states established their own global financial and armed alliances. The Iron Curtain was given its name from Winston Churchill in a speech given to warn everyone of the threat to Western democracies (Moscow). The Soviet Union began to develop nuclear weapons and Truman tried to get them to stop but they refused. U.S. started to develop nuclear weapons of their own to prepare for the worst. Less than a year later, Soviet and American soldiers met at a river to celebrate the defeat of Hitler when the Cold War began.\n\n78 Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and Harry S. Truman did not agree on “enforcing sovietization” on other countries. Stalin wanted more countries to have a communist government and Truman did not. The U.S. and Soviet Union did not want to have military fighting between one another. Winston Churchill gave a speech about the separation of communist countries and independent countries using the term Iron Curtain (A border separating the West from the Soviets) and the president supported this speech. Many believe this was the start to The Cold War which was a war where there was no military action, only things like threats passed between countries.\n\n79 George F.

Drobot\n\n84 The Economic Boom Facts The Economic Boom Facts: During the boom Americans spent an estimated $135 billion dollars in money saved from the war. New products boomed such as televisions, phonographs, automatic transmissions and freezers. The Bretton Woods agreement among all the allies had set the stage for the U.S. to become the economic leader of the noncommunist world. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) stabilized exchange rates by valuing other currencies related to the U.S. dollar. This helped create the International Bank for Recreation and Development.\n\n85 Truman’s Domestic Program Facts Truman’s Domestic Program Facts: Nicknamed the “fair deal” Marked a new stage in the history of Modern Liberalism in the U.S., but the Conservative Coalition dominant in Congress. Helped repeal the Taft-Hartley Act His most important proposals were to help education The only significant domestic accomplishment was the Employment Act of 1946\n\n86 Summary The Economic Boom was a period of time after the war had ended. Families were able to save a lot of money while their loved ones were away at war and woman had to work which also brought in more money. When the men returned American’s turned into consumers rather than producers and spent over $135 billion dollars between the period of late 1946-1956. The Truman Domestic Program was a program designed to help out American’s here at home that were not in good situations financially. The program was known as the “fair deal” and increased minimum wages. Truman was hoping he could focus on education but the only real accomplishment he had was passing the Employment Act of 1946.\n\n87 Economic Boom Levittown, NY\n\n88 Truman’s Domestic Program Political Cartoon of all the things going on while Truman was working on his domestic program.\n\n89 Discussion Questions Since the economy boomed as a direct result of the war, why hasn’t that occurred with our economy after any other war?

Bill of Rights Josh Shikoff Period 9\n\n91 Summary of Demobilization and Reconversion Demobilization- the process of being discharged/disbanded from the military Reconversion-The act of re-converting back to a previous state or condition Following the Cold War in 1945, civilians want the soldiers to return home. After Truman agreed to this popular demand, the soldiers were able to return home, resulting in a weaker military. The returning vets faced readjustment problems such as divorce and a lack of available housing, and fear of unemployment rose. As a result, by the end of the decade, more women were working outside of the house in traditional jobs.\n\n92 Demobilization and Reconversion FACTS Civilians and Soldiers used sayings like “Home alive in ’45” and “No Boats, No Votes” in order to convince the Congress to let them return home Civilians and Soldiers used sayings like “Home alive in ’45” and “No Boats, No Votes” in order to convince the Congress to let them return home In one day in December 1945, sixty thousand postcards arrived at the white house saying “Bring the boys home by Christmas” In one day in December 1945, sixty thousand postcards arrived at the white house saying “Bring the boys home by Christmas” In 1948, the American military strength dropped from 12 million to 1.5 million In 1948, the American military strength dropped from 12 million to 1.5 million In 1946, Defense spending dropped from 76 billion to 20 billion In 1946, Defense spending dropped from 76 billion to 20 billion More than 1 million defense jobs vanished More than 1 million defense jobs vanished\n\n93 Demobilization and Reconversion Pictures\n\n94 Summary of The GI Bill of Rights The GI Bill of Rights was designed to forestall the expected recession by easing veterans back into the daily American lifestyle.
