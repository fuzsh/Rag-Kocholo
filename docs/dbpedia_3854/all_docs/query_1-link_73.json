        "text": "The State of Exception\n\nThe July 1960 assembly was concerned with a specific class of casualties of the 1950–1953 war. These casualties were not fallen soldiers of the civil war, either on the Southern or on the Northern side; nor were they considered innocent civilian victims at the time. Even today, the inclusion of these casualties of war in the category of innocent civilian victims of war, commonly referred to as yangmin (meaning literally “benign subjects” or “benevolent people”), provokes strong objections from certain sectors of the South Korean public. By the time of the Korean War, the category of civilians, as stated in the 1949 Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, primarily addressed people inhabiting territories occupied by hostile state powers or those exposed to belligerents’ artillery fire or aerial bombardment – that is, the lives of unarmed people potentially under threat, in the condition of war, from the acts committed by armed adversaries.3 The victims of war addressed by the Daegu assembly did not belong to either of the two principal categories of casualties of modern warfare – combatants or innocent civilians. Instead, they were victims of a specific form of political violence perpetrated prolifically at the outbreak of the 1950–1953 war, which, although it had taken place as part of the broader reality of a national and international crisis referred to as the Korean War, was nonetheless distinct from the forms of violence familiar from the existing public knowledge of this formative conflict of the twentieth century. The violence perpetrated against them was not the same as the destructive powers exchanged between the two defined state entities and their international allies. It also differed from the coercive violence exercised liberally by both of these entities for the purpose of mobilizing the population behind their respective war efforts. This violence was committed not “in the hands of the adversary,”4 but by the very state power to which the victims stood as its subjects. The targets of this violence were not armed enemy combatants or unarmed civilians in enemy territory, but people “whose mere presence was deemed to threaten the security of the state and the war effort.”5\n\nSuch violence of the state against its own society was first unleashed as part of the state of emergency measure implemented throughout the territory of South Korea, following the beginning of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, and before the war transformed into a full-blown international conflict. Mass arrests and killings took place first in areas that were under the threat of occupation by the advancing communist forces. The South Korean combat police and military police carried out killings in remote valleys or in abandoned mines. The victims were mostly people who had been earmarked before the war as harboring some sort of sympathy toward communism or socialism, and they included prison inmates arrested during the prewar political unrest in parts of South Korea. The decision to eradicate these individuals en masse was on the pretext of a preventive measure, allegedly to stop them from providing support to the enemy. It was also a reaction to North Korea’s revolutionary war strategy that combined a frontal assault against South Korea’s defense with popular revolutionary uprisings from within enemy territory. It is believed that about 200,000 lives succumbed to this whirlwind of state terror unleashed at the outset of the Korean War, although the exact number of victims remains unknown to date. Such wanton destruction of civilian lives continued throughout the war, later changing in character to punitive violence (committed against alleged collaborators with the enemy forces), once the tide of war changed and the North Korean forces were pushed back. This followed atrocities committed by the retreating communist forces in their briefly occupied zones, against people who they believed were sympathizers with the Southern regime. The violence committed by one side radicalized the intensity and scale of the violence committed by the opposite side, and this vicious cycle of terror perpetrated against the civilian population devastated countless local communities to the extreme.\n\nThese waves of violence that came with the changing tides of war involved not only an extreme abuse of the states’ coercive powers but also the self-destruction of traditional communities. Villages were turned inside out, becoming a crucible of destruction in the image of the wider theater of war, but in the hands of people who had lived together for generations. In an account by the late Korean writer Park Kyung-li, Ji-young speaks of the situation in her village in September 1950:\n\nIn the words of Park Wan-seo, “As the frontline moved back and forth, the order of the world changed as if someone was flipping his hand. Each time the world changed, accusations were made against ‘collaborators’ or against ‘reactionaries’. Then, innocent lives were lost. The villagers underwent this madness repeatedly.”7 Park Chan-sung, a historian who investigated local histories in an island community off the southern coast, describes what he encountered in the islanders’ Korean War memories: “These small village wars are not a thing of the past in the affected communities. These wars lasted only two to three months, whereas their shadows are still vigorously alive in these communities sixty years after.”8\n\nSimilar conditions are referred to in the existing literature as the privatization of violence.9 Stathis Kalyvas investigates, primarily with reference to events during the Greek civil war, what he calls the zone of ambiguity in civil war conflicts – the murky arena in which the violence committed by states or other organized political forces meets with the violence initiated from within local communities. Kalyvas calls the latter a civil war’s “intimate violence” to distinguish it from the impersonal violence executed by the coercive forces of the state hierarchy.10 These two forms of violence – impersonal and intimate – proliferated in the theater of Korea’s civil war. They were closely intertwined in local realities and remain sometimes indistinguishable in collective memories. In many testimonial accounts recently made available, it is often impossible to tease out traces of impersonal political violence from those of intimate communal violence. It is also difficult to discover the details of intimate violence in a community where both the victims and the perpetrators of this violence still share the space of communal life today. However, it is clear that these details, rather than necessarily those of impersonal violence, constitute especially vexing memories within the community. In such milieus, people still struggle with the radical disparities between their distant memory of sharing food and child-minding with a neighboring family before the war broke out, on the one hand, and, on the other, the ever-present memory of their neighbor turning his or her back on them at a time when they needed the latter’s support most desperately. If that neighbor also happens to be a relative, bitter memories of betrayal are brought back, for instance, at a gathering for ancestral remembrance. On such occasions, the act of making food and alcohol offerings to some ancestral graves becomes a poignant reminder of the family’s wartime division and its enduring, unspoken divisiveness – rather than, as tradition has it, a moment of togetherness and rediscovering the comfort of closeness.\n\nIn the initial chaos of war, catastrophic conditions also confronted those who joined the exodus to Daegu and elsewhere in the southeastern corner of the peninsula. Steven Lee insists that the reality of the Korean War is unintelligible if it is approached only from the perspective of conventional military history that focuses on the interaction between organized armed groups.11 In support of this point, Lee explores how the different armed groups of the conflict related to the confused civilian population. He focuses on the assault by the South Korean state against its citizens, the mobilization of civilian labor for the cause of national liberation carried out by the Northern forces in their occupied Southern regions, and the difficulties faced by the US forces in distinguishing allies from foes, and civilians from enemy combatants. Concerning the last, several recent studies convincingly show gross failures on the part of US military commands in the Korean conflict in protecting the unarmed civilian population.12\n\nOne well-known example in this regard is the tragedy of Nogun-ri near Daejeon, which was en route from Seoul to Daegu. The massacre of war refugees in Nogun-ri was one of the first incidents of civilian killings in the Korean War to become public knowledge in the mid-1990s, which has since attracted wide attention internationally.13 It resulted in the killing of several hundred refugees over three days and began with a US warplane opening fire on the refugee columns, which forced them to take shelter underneath a nearby railroad bridge. The refugees were cornered by machine-gun fire from a unit of a US cavalry division that had prepared a defense line there against the advancing People’s Army forces. After three days of shooting, only ten out of an estimated 400 refugees – mostly children, elders, and women – survived. The investigation carried out by a group of Associated Press journalists found that the incident was not simply the tragic collateral damage of a military action, resulting from difficulties in distinguishing genuine civilians from enemy fighters infiltrating the rear line disguised as civilians.14 Instead, the investigation concluded that the tragedy was the result of a systemic failure in the military command that blatantly disregarded, in the name of a condition of emergency and in that of efficacy in a military operation, the obligation to discriminate unarmed civilians from armed combatants.15\n\nThe exodus of war refugees was a widespread phenomenon by the time the massacre in Nogun-ri took place in July 1950. The widely executed assaults against refugee groups, most often by aerial actions, made their movements highly precarious. For this reason, among the most common episodes that appear in the testimonial histories of the Korean War are those concerning unintelligible attacks by allied planes against the refugees. This also explains why it soon became general knowledge among the Korean War refugees that in order to stay alive, it was imperative that they move during the night and along rugged mountain paths to remain invisible to American planes, which often meant following the same routes as those taken by the Northern communist forces. This was indeed the case in the experience of five students, whose stories I had the privilege to learn. Consisting of two female high school students and three male junior high school students, all from the same rural area near Daegu, the group joined the exodus to the South toward their birthplace on June 27, 1950. They narrowly escaped the strafing against the refugee boats by US warplanes while crossing the Han River that cuts across Seoul. The North’s expeditionary forces were advancing ahead of them, and following advice from other refugees, the students tracked behind the communist troops along the central mountain ranges, traveling only in the dark.\n\nClose to their home village, along a mountain footpath, the students were stopped by a group of armed communist partisans. Although the partisan leader was intent on reeducating the young refugees and recruiting them for the revolutionary war, he let the group of five go free. It turned out that the leader had recognized one of the students. He spoke to this student with these words, which she remembers vividly today: “I am letting you go. Your father is a rightist but I know he is a decent man. You go home and tell him to be kind to my family back home, just as I am kind to you now.” By the time the five students reached their home village after eleven days on foot, the area was already under Northern occupation. The parents of one girl were waiting for their daughter, and on the night she arrived, they left the village to join their family who had already evacuated to Daegu. On their way out of the village, they took with them one of the three boys who, having discovered that no one was at his home, happened to come to her place in the late evening to ask for news. The other girl also found her home empty and went to see the village chief the following morning. There she was greeted by members of the village’s hastily organized revolutionary women’s association. She later joined the village’s revolutionary youth organization together with the two other boys in her group from Seoul. When the girl who moved to Daegu returned home a few months later, she heard that the two boys had left the village, heading north shortly after the communist troops had evacuated the area. The villagers had not heard of their whereabouts since. A year later, she was shocked to see a picture of her dear friend, the girl with whom she shared the arduous journey home, on the front page of the local newspaper. The news was about a female student communist mountain guerrilla fighter captured alive, together with three dead male comrades. In the picture, the captured friend looked exhausted and heavily pregnant.\n\nWhile these refugees were heading to Daegu and elsewhere further south during a time of great hardship, a state of emergency was declared throughout the territory of South Korea. The presidential decree issued on June 28, 1950 ordered the suspension of the judicial procedure for crimes that concerned national security. The decree specified that these crimes were acts that benefited the enemy in terms of material assistance, and of providing information and voluntary assistance to enemy troops and authorities. However, by the time this executive order was endorsed by the country’s parliament and subsequently developed into a formal declaration of a state of emergency on July 8, 1950, the country’s police and military police forces had already arrested a large number of individuals on charges of potential collaboration with the enemy and executed them without any due court procedure. The mass execution targeted prison inmates classified as “ideological criminals” as well as members of the so-called Alliance of Converts (bodo yŏnmaeing), the nationwide state-run organization established in 1949, whose stated objective was to bring the former members of the South Korean Communist Party and other alleged sympathizers of communism to “the right way of patriotism and anticommunism.”16 Many of these ill-fated prison inmates and so-called ideological converts were survivors of South Korea’s earlier, prewar state-of-exception politics. These locally confined emergency measures were first implemented by the US Military Government in Korea (from September 1945 to August 1948), which targeted specific areas that experienced outbreaks of popular revolt and armed partisan resistance against the Military Government. The politics of the state of emergency continued after the South Korean government was established on August 15, 1948.\n\nThe state of emergency that was declared in 1948 in Yŏsu, amid the crisis of a mutiny in this southern coastal town, ruled: “Individuals who conceal traitors or those who communicate with the latter shall receive the punishment of death.” The state of emergency declared in June 1950 was, in form, an extension of this and other earlier measures on a national scale. In its character, however, the June 1950 decree was distinct from the prewar varieties in that it was intended principally to justify preemptive violence, which targeted presumed, hypothetical collaborators (“suspected traitors”), rather than actual crimes of treason.17 These measures were imbued with a profound historical irony, too. It has been observed that the 1948 constitution of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) had no provision for martial law, which obliged the country’s lawmakers, during the political crisis of 1948–1950, to refer back to the Meiji constitution of the colonial era in justifying the state’s right to institute a state of emergency.18 This observation highlights the critical ambiguity in South Korea’s constitutional power in this sphere, which was, on the one hand, an extension of the power of the US Military Government in South Korea, and, on the other, a restoration of Japan’s imperial constitutional order.19 As the Korean War developed into an international conflict, involving the intervention of United Nations forces, the rule against collaboration continued to take effect, changing in character from preventive to punitive action. When the territory that had been briefly occupied by the Northern army was recovered by South Korea’s national army, the country’s police, military intelligence, and paramilitary anti-communist youth groups conducted brutal cleanup actions against individuals who were thought to have assisted the occupying Northern political authorities and military forces. These actions were typically indiscriminate, with the punishment falling not only on the individual suspects, but also on the individuals’ families, and sometimes on the entire village community to which the accused individuals belonged.\n\nThe behavior of the North Korean occupation forces was overall relatively more restrained during the early days of occupation. This was in part because their war was nominally a revolutionary people’s war, the success of which relied heavily on earning the hearts and minds of the local population. The relative calm did not last long, however. When the communist units were forced to retreat northward in September 1950, they committed a number of atrocities including summary civilian killings in their occupied areas.20 These killings targeted “the civil servants [of South Korea], members of the rightist organizations, and wealthy farmers,” and were based on the order issued by North Korea’s politburo to remove “all elements that might turn out to be potential supporters of the United Nations forces.”21 As such, they constituted preemptive violence, the same in nature as the violence committed earlier by their Southern adversary. The victims of this preemptive violence included prison inmates in North Korea’s occupied territories and, in some areas, members of local churches. In the city of Daejeon, 150 kilometers south of Seoul, the UN troops discovered that the withdrawing Northern units had left behind a prison compound where the cells were stacked with several layers of corpses. This atrocity was widely reported at the time in both the South Korean domestic press and the international press. One report described the incident: “More than a thousand patriots were brutally murdered by the communist puppets.” These reports did not mention, however, that two months prior to this incident, the same prison had been widely mentioned in the North Korean press and in the international press of the Eastern Bloc countries as the site of a major atrocity committed by “the puppets of American imperialists.”22\n\nIn the southwestern region of the peninsula, the advancing South Korean forces met fierce resistance from the remaining North Korean troops and their local recruits, some of whom had by then transformed into partisan groups entrenched in the surrounding hills. In the village of Gurim, at the beginning of October 1950, the communist partisans set fire to the local school and the village’s ancestral assembly hall and Protestant church. On October 7, 1950, according to the local annals prepared by the villagers in 2006:\n\nThe annals continue that the arrested were subsequently locked up in a private home, which was then set on fire, not knowing “what crimes they had committed to deserve such a cruelty.”24 Soon after this incident, on October 17, the village suffered once more. The village annals mention the second massacre only fleetingly. Hence, I quote from a different source, the report of a local history project conducted in the area in 2000–2002:\n\nThe memoir of Park Wan-seo speaks of the precarious living conditions in Seoul at the time of its liberation from the North’s occupation. Park’s family failed to evacuate the city before the Northern army took control of it. This was hardly unusual for residents of Seoul at that time, many of whom, although feeling confused and uncertain about the future, did not feel compelled to abandon their homes.26 In fact, of the city’s population, amounting to a million and half, less than a third joined the exodus to the South. Of those who did, eight out of ten were refugees who had left their homes in Northern Korea during the prewar partition period of 1945–1950; that is, people whom the communist forces were likely to define as harboring hostility to the state. Park’s elder brother, a schoolteacher, had a background in working with progressive intellectuals and leftist groups before the war, which resulted in a host of problems for the family. The activity he was involved in was, according to his mother, “the business of the red” and a sure sign of a forthcoming catastrophe for him and for the family.27 The son’s actions met resistance from his family, particularly from his mother, who moved the family’s residence each time their house became a meeting place for her son’s entourage. Influenced by his mother’s insistent protests, Park’s brother eventually abandoned his political activity, found a teaching job in a rural school, and married. The family later found out that before taking up the job, he was forced to sign up to the Alliance of Converts to prove that he had abandoned and renounced communism. Immediately after the North Korean forces took over the town, her brother was approached by his old comrades, who urged him to join the revolutionary youth organization and the patriotic front in support of the People’s Army. Park herself was drawn to a similar initiative organized among her college friends. Meanwhile, the liquor store of her paternal uncle and aunt was transformed into a gathering place for North Korean military officers, where the couple had to prepare meals for their new clients. Park’s mother saw the family’s growing incorporation into the politics and economy of the communist occupation as an ominous sign of a dark future for the family. She was particularly worried about her son’s unstable, deteriorating mental condition, which Park believed was related to his bifurcated mind – between his obligations to family as the eldest son and his political commitments as a conscientious intellectual – as well as the shame of embracing an ideology after having renounced it.\n\nThe liberation of Seoul was not a celebratory event for Park’s family, whose living conditions became even more precarious thereafter. Having witnessed the roundup of people classified as counterrevolutionaries or supporters of the Southern regime during the early days of the North Korean occupation, this time Park was shocked to hear of the arrest and summary execution of neighbors and other residents, now being branded as buyŏkja or “collaborators.” Park’s paternal uncle and aunt were among those arrested, denounced by one of their neighbors as having fed and entertained the enemy combatants. Park Wan-seo herself endured a humiliating interrogation at the hands of an anti-communist paramilitary group, together with other family members accused of being collaborators. Her brother escaped this round of violence because he had already been conscripted into North Korea’s armed forces, and Park struggled to persuade her interrogators that her brother did not volunteer for the enemy’s armed forces but was simply forced to join. Park learned through this experience that in the eyes of her interrogators, the residents of Seoul who experienced North Korea’s occupation were all collaborators with the communists and “people who offered their labor to the enemy.” She realized that the population of the liberated Seoul was divided between the returning refugees and the nonreturnees, depending on whether or not they had evacuated the town before the communist occupation, and that those who failed to leave the city before the occupation were not regarded as proper citizens of the South Korean state and, instead, as disposable elements having no civil or human rights. Hence, she writes, “The life of a ‘red’ is like the life of an insect; the family of the ‘red’ has a destiny no better than that of worms.”28 Coming to the understanding that the only possible way to preserve life in the liberated city was to join the struggle against communism, Park Wan-seo took the initiative to seek employment with an anti-communist youth organization as a secretarial clerk. She understood the prevailing logic of violence at the time: if her family as a whole faced the threat of appearing impure to the jealous persecutors as an extension of a family member, whom the latter regarded as a seditious and impure element, the only possibility for the family to shake off this life-threatening appearance and to survive was for someone in the family to join the interiority of anti-communist militancy. Also notable in Park Wan-seo’s accounts of vulnerable life in wartime Seoul is the breakdown of communal trust in a state of siege. The summary killing of her uncle was triggered by his neighbor’s accusation. Her own arrest by a paramilitary group was also caused by information about her brother provided by her family’s long-time neighbor. Park’s mother lamented the situation: “How in the heavens’ name is this possible? What happened to the food we used to share? Have people forgotten how we, the rich or the poor, had all taken turns to care for our grandchildren?”29 The general vulnerability of life and the fear of complicity influenced close kinship groups, too. Park introduces the following as one of the most painful episodes of the time. While her aunt and uncle were in jail, Park’s mother wished to deliver clothes to them, so she asked a favor of a relative who worked as a prison guard. She was shocked to hear him remark sternly that he wished to have nothing to do with a family that was an enemy of the state.\n\nThe distortion of communal relations caused by the politics of retributive violence often took a more radical form in rural communities. It has been observed that the Korean War “permitted two antagonistic state powers to penetrate deep into the communities and thereby played a constitutive role in disintegrating these communities.”30 Indeed, recent studies show how the states’ systematic terror against civilians developed into a spiral of tragic intimate violence perpetrated within and between communities in which “the victims of violence turned into the perpetrators of violence and the perpetrators to the victims” – a situation that was repeated following the movement of the frontier.31 These studies show that in many rural communities, the Korean War is remembered primarily as a village war, as briefly noted earlier, a conflict that took place within the community and between local groupings. Two challenging questions arise from the investigation of the Korean War’s intimate violence. One of them concerns the circumstances in which the politics of civil war brought a civil war-like crisis into a village community, and correspondingly, the extent to which the violence waged within a local community was related to locally specific historical conditions. The investigators who raise these questions also find considerable diversity in the experience of communal violence across places and even between physically close communities.\n\nThe anthropologist Yun Taik-lim’s study based in Yesan, a rural area near the city of Daejeon, for instance, asks why between the two neighboring villages she investigated, retaliatory communal violence erupted only in one particular village, not in the other (see later discussion). Other recent studies raise similar questions as to how social groupings within a community, such as lineage groups, came to experience the war’s violence in markedly different ways.32 Similar observations are made in the recent reports prepared by South Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (see Chapter 6) on its investigation of several dozen incidents of mass civilian killings during the Korean War. The Commission’s richly documented reports amply show considerable variance in the patterns of state and communal violence. In a district near Kongju, in the south-central region, for instance, the Commission found that although residents of this area suffered from the preemptive violence perpetrated against alleged communist sympathizers in the early days of the war, the region was fortunate to avoid a subsequent escalation of violence, unlike other nearby places. According to one local villager who provided testimonies to the Truth Commission’s investigation team, this was due to the fact that “the retaliation against the Right rarely took place during the time of People’s Republic [in our area], so no retaliation against the Left followed after the recovery [of the village by South Korea].”33 The Commission’s investigation also notes a geographical factor in explaining the relative absence of communal violence in this area – that the evacuation of the North Korean troops and their local supporters involved fewer of them turning into locally based partisan resistance groups, unlike in other places in wartime South Korea, as the region lacks wooded mountains and hills that could shelter partisan insurgents.34\n\nThe diversity of war experience is observed not only between regions but also within the same locale and even within the same village community. Notable in this respect is Yun’s accounts of a village in the Yesan district mentioned earlier. The village was the birthplace of several locally prominent intellectuals, who assumed leadership roles in the wider region’s radical social reform movement and political organizational activities during the early postcolonial years. Due to this legacy, the village earned, during the war and afterward, the designation of “Yesan’s Moscow” or “another Moscow” among the locals (see Chapter 3).35 Although the village as a whole was viewed by outsiders as a hotbed of radical politics, relations were more complicated within the village, which consisted of two residential clusters, Gamgol and Bamgol. Even before the outbreak of the war, according to Yun, conflicts were intense in Bamgol. The hamlet was divided between the returning former veterans and labor conscripts of Japan’s imperial army from various parts of the Pacific War theater and, on the other, a village notable and his supporters. The latter played a role in conscripting the village youths into Japan’s war ventures, so the returning veterans had legitimate grudges against the man and his entourage, who continued to exert influence in village affairs after the end of Japan’s colonial occupation of Korea in 1945. By the time the Korean War broke out in 1950, animosity between these two groups of villagers was magnified and took on, according to Yun, “the façade of a left versus right ideological struggle.”36 What Yun means by this remark is, from my understanding, that the polarization of village politics, according to the terms of the Cold War, was partly rooted in the colonial-era conflicts between the collaborators with colonial politics and the victims of these politics. These intra-communal conflicts were less prominent in the village’s other settlement of Gamgol, however, according to Yun, who associates this community’s relative peace in 1945–1950 with strong leadership within the hamlet provided by two prominent anti-colonial activists and radical intellectuals.37 These two men enjoyed great moral authority in Gamgol, not only due to their anti-colonial credentials, but also because they were from families that had long enjoyed prominence within the settlement.\n\nThese two settlements reacted to North Korea’s occupation politics quite differently. Gamgol was incorporated into the revolutionary administration swiftly and relatively peacefully, and some of its residents were recruited for important positions in the village and district-level war administrations of the occupation power. In Bamgol, by contrast, the occupation generated a tumultuous local situation. The villagers who were classified by the occupation authority as counterrevolutionaries had to run for their lives, and their properties were confiscated. Those who failed to escape were put before a panel of summary justice, called the People’s Court, and five of them were subsequently beaten to death. Yun observes that this violent episode at the outset of the occupation later led to vicious retaliatory violence against the villagers who had participated in the People’s Court, when the North Korean forces left the area, and the people who had escaped the occupation returned to the village triumphantly in advance of the South Korean government forces. This time, the villagers who had taken part in the local administration during the occupation were forced to evacuate the area. People who failed to do so were executed, and their properties were taken by villagers who claimed to be anti-communist patriots. These lethal actions extended to the families of the accused individuals. Although both settlements suffered retributive violence during this time, Bamgol’s experience was far more destructive than Gamgol’s. In Gamgol, acts of retribution were mainly conducted by the South Korean military forces. In contrast, residents of Bamgol were persecuted not only by the military but also by vengeful villagers who had suffered under North Korean occupation. The latter is remembered by the villagers as the most painful episode of the war, according to Yun, and it continues to haunt village life to this day.38 A village elder in Gamgol said:\n\nWhen the UN forces crossed the 38th parallel, the prewar frontier that partitioned Korea into two separate states, and charged through the territory of North Korea, it is reported that the troops found numerous traces of mass killings. The withdrawing North Korean political and military authorities continued their violence against civilians on the grounds of guilt by suspicion, but this time against their own citizens whom they suspected might collaborate with the Southern forces. In certain areas, the violence specifically targeted members of local church groups.40 When the northward advance of the UN troops was halted by the Chinese and North Korean forces along North Korea’s border with China, which then began to roll back the UN forces from the territory of North Korea and further back to the central region of South Korea, a new whirlwind of violence was unleashed.\n\nChina’s military intervention in the Korean conflict is a subject of intense investigation among historians of the Korean War today, together with the US decision to cross the 38th parallel, which triggered the intervention. China’s involvement changed the character of the Korean War from principally a civil war with elements of an international war to a full-blown international war with a diminishing dimension of civil war. Militarily, it altered the form of the Korean War from a chaotic mobile-territorial war in the second half of 1950 to stagnant trench warfare and hill fighting along the 38th parallel that would last two more years. However, the radically changing conditions of the Korean War at the end of 1950 politically and militarily meant, in terms of social experiences, a return of the chaos of July 1950. During the retreat of the UN forces in the early months of 1951, numerous civilians in the central region of South Korea succumbed to a revived storm of preemptive violence, and these included people who had survived the earlier storm of political violence. It is known that communities in North Korea were also affected by this wave of violence, although details are yet to emerge.41 A number of rural communities in the environs of Seoul, including those on the island of Kanghwa and in the district of Koyang, were almost completely destroyed during this time by the indiscriminate violence of summary killings committed by South Korea’s combat police troops and paramilitary youth groups. In Koyang, local paramilitary groups arrested villagers suspected of having assisted the North Korean occupying forces, executed them en masse on a hill, and threw their bodies into an abandoned colonial gold mine. The paramilitary groups in Kanghwa gathered the islanders who they had previously earmarked as collaborators and conducted a series of executions along the seashore."
