        "text": "Henry Kelly\n\nAt the YMCA the other day I met a man who had a US Navy Korean War Veteran hat and I asked him what ship he was on. He stated he was a Cargo Ammunition Ship taking ammo from Japan to Korea. I said at least he didn't have to worry about being sunk by a Sub, was I wrong?.\n\nHe said they only worried that the ammo stayed stable.\n\nHank Kelly RM2 50-52\n\nNeither N. or S. Korea had a Navy of any consequence to attack the NATO fleet, but that doesn't mean that Russia or China didn't have that capability.\n\nAm pretty sure that if Russia/China had attacked one of our ships, that a continuation of WWII would have ensued. It's kind of surprising that it didn't happen.\n\nOn a similar note, I found it surprising how many lives were lost on both sides in the Korean War. Upwards of 600,000 dead and nearly 1,000,000 wounded, not to mention the ~2.5 million civilians killed. I'm astounded. See:\n\nKorean War - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nKorean War - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nTotal: 178,426 dead and 32,925 missing Total wounded: 566,434\n\nPreview by Yahoo\n\nPaul Wieloszynski\n\nSTG3, 3rd Div\n\n1969 - 1972\n\n(Am astounded on either what I don't remember about history or what they didn't teach us)"
