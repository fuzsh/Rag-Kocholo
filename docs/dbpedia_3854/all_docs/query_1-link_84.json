        "text": "“In September 1952 1st King's, after acclimatising in Hong Kong and Battle Training in Japan, deployed to Korea under command 29th Infantry Brigade Group. The Companies deployed into defensive positions at the beginning of October. The war was in stalemate and much like the Great War, with the men in deep trenches under constant harassing fire. The average age was 19 and many of the men had been brought up during the Blitz so they did not consider the conditions too bad, and the food was better than at home. Offensive activity was limited to patrolling, until May 1953.\n\nThe Brigade was defending positions on The Hook [a crescent-shaped ridge, ‘The Hook’ was the most notorious position of all along the UN front line]. There was considerable speculation about ‘Peace’ accompanied with an assessment that the Chinese were likely to try to over-run The Hook to gain an advantage in the negotiations.\n\nAgainst the background of Chinese preparations, on 22nd May 1953 1st King's mounted a diversionary company night attack against a Chinese held feature nicknamed “PHEASANT”. The point platoon entered a mine-field and the operation was abandoned because of the number of casualties.\n\nOn 28 May 1953, the Chinese mounted a determined assault against The Hook which was held by 1st Battalion, The Duke of Wellington’s Regiment and A Company 1st King's. The artillery fire from both sides was unimaginable but The Hook was held, and 1st King's mounted the counter-attack to clear the Chinese off The Hook.\n\nA week later, on 4 June 1953, C Company mounted a night attack against caves which it was assessed were being used to provide a covered approach for another Chinese assault. The point again stumbled into a minefield but despite the casualties pressed on and mounted a successful attack.\n\nDuring all the operations the Mortar Platoon had been engaged and although the Command Post had received a direct hit the platoon had suffered no casualties but had gained a terrific reputation for both accuracy and speed of response. The post action report noted that the Battle of The Hook ‘called for immense volumes of accurate and rapid fire from the Mortar Platoon, and the platoon excelled itself’. Almost 2000 men had served in 1st King's in Korea, with some 200 recorded as casualties.”"
