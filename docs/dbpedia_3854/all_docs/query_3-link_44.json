        "text": "In April 1951 Chinese forces launched an offensive focusing on Kapyong and the Imjin River to break the UN line, and then Seoul would once more be within striking distance. On the night of 22nd April, the Chinese attacked, outnumbering UN forces three to one.\n\nChinese forces numbering some 40,000 attacked the British 29th Brigade, which was supported by Belgian forces along the Imjin River. Despite being heavily outnumbered, troops of the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, defended Hill 235 on the river for three days before they were forced to retreat amid heavy casualties. Chinese forces took more than 500 prisoners. The 1st Battalion was later awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation for their gallantry.\n\nImjin River was one of the bloodiest battles fought by the British Army since the Second World War. The sacrifice of the British and Belgian forces gave the UN Forces opportunity to retreat to a stronger defensive position where they eventually halted the North Korean and Chinese troops.\n\nFor the next two years troops faced a stalemate near the border; in trenches little more than a mile apart they withstood extreme conditions of cold and heat.\n\n“Sleep and ‘my time’ was minimal. Through time it got to a point where you could drop off to sleep standing up!... Unfortunately, bed was where we faced our second enemy – the rats. Like humans, rats feel the cold and seek warmth, especially where food is to be had… One particular time, I had two bars of chocolate and was eating one in the dark and the other bar had disappeared. I found a rat nibbling it at the bottom of my so-called bed. When I threw my mess tin at the offender, it disappeared so I threw the bar of chocolate away. One of the lads, Ron Smailes, found it and simply broke off the nibbled bit and ate the rest. Fortunately, he lived to tell the tale!”\n\nAn area around a ridge overlooking the Imjin River known as ‘the Hook’ had been a focus for control and two battles had repulsed Chinese forces. In May 1953 it was successfully defended again, this time by The Duke of Wellington’s Regiment (West Riding).\n\nCharlie Daynes, Duke of Wellington’s Regiment:\n\n“On the night of 28th May 1953, I was selected to go out on patrol in no-man’s land on a feature called Green Finger – one of the spurs leading from the Hook. We were in readiness to go out when Hell let loose and the third battle of the Hook had begun… Unfortunately, our patrol commander was killed instantly, so we took shelter in the nearest bunker.\"\n\nFinally in July 1953 an armistice agreement was signed, although no peace treaty has ever been concluded, and thousands of former prisoners on each side were returned.\n\nIn total about 81,000 British and over 50,000 Commonwealth service personnel served during the Korean War, with British casualties being more than 1100 killed in action and more than 2500 wounded. Nearly 37,000 Americans lost their lives. It is estimated that over half a million North Korean and Chinese troops were killed and at least half a million South Korean personnel were killed or injured. The civilian cost of the war was extremely high, estimates are that a total of two million North and South Korean civilians were killed.\n\nSeven decades on, many veterans feel the war in Korea is the ‘Forgotten War’. But for those who served and their families, and who live with its legacy, it should always be remembered."
