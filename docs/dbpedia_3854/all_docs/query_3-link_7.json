        "text": "On July 5, for the first time since the end of World War II, American troops engaged in ground combat at Osan near Seoul. By September, the North Koreans had taken over much of the Korean peninsula and driven the ROK army to the region of Pusan. In October, Chinese Communist Forces began their first offensive, engaging in their first battle with US forces on November 1 near Unsan. Bitter and bloody battles, including those at Changjin (Chosin) and Seoul within the first six months of the war, would continue on for another two and a half years.\n\nOn July 27, 1953, the Korean War, technically a “conflict” since the US Congress did not actually declare “war,” would finally come to an end. The armistice between North and South Korea would establish the boundary between nations as a demilitarized zone, or DMZ. By the end of the conflict, Americans suffered some 140,000 casualties.2 The total number of deaths of all armed forces involved is estimated to be more than 1,250,000.3 It is also estimated that at least two million and possibly as many as four million civilians died.4\n\nThe Korean War is often referred to as “The Forgotten War,” a moniker it was given by US News and World Report as early as October 1951. In actuality, the war itself was not necessarily “forgotten” but, sadly, disregarded. At the time, the American public had little interest in the conflict once it failed to reach the scale of World War II, which had ended just five years prior.5\n\nToday, the Korean War is often overshadowed by World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and now, the conflicts in the Middle East. The Nisei who served in Korea are also too often “forgotten.”"
