        "text": "The following abbreviations for German prisoner of war camps are found in our records:\n\nStalag (Stammlager) – in most cases, a camp for NCOs and enlisted men\n\nOflag (Offizierlager) – a camp for officers only\n\nStalag Luft (Stammlager Luftwaffe) – a camp for Air Force officers administered by the Luftwaffe\n\nDulag (Durchgangslager) – a transit camp where captured aircrew were processed and interrogated before being sent to a permanent camp\n\nMilag and Malag – in most cases, a camp for men of the British Merchant Navy and Royal Navy\n\n3. Online records\n\nThough many records are not available to view online there are some key sets of records that are. They are all covered in this section.\n\nVarious selected lists and other records of POWs in Europe and the Far East, Second World War\n\nAmong the very wide variety of different prisoners of war records 1715-1945 digitized from National Archives collections on Findmypast (£) there are many from the Second World War. Some of the most significant are listed below – click on the record series links to learn more about the original records:\n\nLists of Prisoners of War from the War Office’s Directorate of Prisoners of War (from record series WO 392)\n\nJapanese Index Cards of Allied Prisoners of War and Internees, partly in Japanese (from record series WO 345) – for help with translation see the Dutch National Archives’ guide on translating Japanese POW cards (this link will download as a PDF file)\n\nAround 13,500 allied prisoners of war and civilian internees held in Singapore camps (from record series WO 367)\n\nRegisters and other records of POW deaths across Europe and the Far East from the War Office Casualties (L) Branch of the Department of the Permanent Under Secretary of State (from record series WO 361)\n\nPOW lists and rolls from Air Ministry intelligence reports and papers (from record series AIR 40)\n\nMerchant Navy POW deaths (from record series BT 373)\n\nForeign Office and Colonial Office records of POWs\n\nPOW liberation questionnaires, Second World War\n\nSearch among the POW liberation questionnaires on Ancestry (charges apply), digitized versions of National Archives records from series WO 344. The questionnaires relate to POWs captured by both Germany and Japan.\n\nThe online images and indexes on Ancestry exclude individuals born less than 100 years ago. These are available as originals for consultation at The National Archives in Kew. In these instances, browse through WO 344 in our catalogue, ordered by surname ranges, to pick out the range and therefore the document applicable to the name you are searching for.\n\nAs well as giving personal details like name, rank, number, unit and home address, these records can include:\n\nthe date and place of capture\n\nmain camps and hospitals in which imprisoned and work camps\n\nserious illnesses suffered while a prisoner and medical treatment received\n\ninterrogation after capture\n\nescape attempts\n\nsabotage\n\nsuspicion of collaboration by other Allied prisoners\n\ndetails of bad treatment by the enemy to themselves or others.\n\nIn addition, the liberated POWs were given the opportunity to bring to official notice any other matters, such as courageous acts by fellow prisoners or details of civilians who assisted them during escape and evasion activities.\n\nEscape and evasion reports, Second World War\n\nSearch The National Archives catalogue for escape and evasion reports in WO 208 by the name of an individual. These are individual accounts of escape attempts or capture, or awards for those who assisted escape attempts. The reports cover prisoners held in Europe and North Africa.\n\nNot all of the records from WO 208 have been digitised and many are therefore not viewable online and won’t be findable with a name search in our catalogue. If you are unable to find an online version, see section 5 below for advice on finding original documents in WO 208.\n\nBritish Prisoners of War database, Second World War\n\nSearch the British Army Prisoners of War, 1939-1945 database on Ancestry.co.uk £ for listings of Second World War British Army, Navy and Air Force POWs. These are not National Archives records.\n\nAmong the information you can find on an individual POW in these records is:\n\nrank\n\nregiment or other military unit detail\n\nPOW number\n\ncamp type, number and location\n\nNotifications of deaths, 1939-1942\n\nAmong the Foreign Returns sent to the General Register Office, held in series RG 32 at The National Archives, are notifications of prisoner of war deaths. You can search for online versions at bmdregisters.co.uk (£). Use the advanced search on the BMD Registers site and search in the following way:\n\nEnter the names you are searching for\n\nFrom the dropdown options in the ‘Search within’ box, select RG 32\n\nFrom the dropdown option in the ‘Event type’ box, select Deaths & Burials\n\nIn the ‘Year of Event’ box, type 1940 (records dating from within 5 years of 1940 will be returned)\n\n4. How to search for original records across our entire collection\n\nMany POW records held at The National Archive have no online version and to see these you will need to consult them at our building in Kew or pay for copies to be emailed to you. The search for records held at Kew can, however, begin online, by searching for document references in our online catalogue.\n\nThe key to a successful search is knowing what search terms to search with and which record series to search within, though you can try speculative searches across our entire collection from the catalogue homepage. Most of the records are not searchable by the prisoner’s name so you will probably need to try the following keyword search terms instead:\n\n‘prisoner of war’\n\ncountry names, for example Italy, Germany, Japan, Korea with the term ‘prisoners of war’\n\n‘camp’ as a single keyword, or camp name or number\n\n‘prisoner of war list’\n\n‘awards’ and ‘helpers’\n\n‘civilian’ and ‘prisoner ‘, ‘internment’ or ‘internees’\n\nship or glider name, aircraft type and number for missing personnel\n\ntype of service, i.e. Royal Air Force and ‘prisoner’ or ‘Merchant’ and ‘prisoner of war’ for merchant seamen PoWs\n\nThe above search terms will return higher proportions of relevant results when you target specific record series using the advanced search of our catalogue. Sets of record series collectively make up record departments, most of which represent the central government departments which originally collected and created the records. Use the following reference codes to target specific departments in which PoW records are held:\n\nWO for War Office records\n\nAIR for Air Ministry records\n\nADM for Admiralty records\n\nFO for Foreign Office records (use our guide to Correspondence of the Foreign Office, 1920-1951 for more advice on finding FO records)\n\nCO for Colonial Office records\n\nDO for Dominions Office records\n\nMT for Ministry of Transport records\n\nThe rest of this guide provides advice on which record series within these large departments are specifically, and in some cases exclusively, series of PoW records and how to search through them.\n\n5. Second World War POWs in Europe and the Far East – name searchable original records\n\nNot all the original records of POWs are searchable by name in our catalogue but a significant proportion are. We have created a bespoke search tool, below, for many of these, covering multiple series, to make searching for POW records in our catalogue by name easier. Search here either by surname only, by surname plus initial/s or by surname and forename/s (try all three alternately as different combinations may return different results):\n\nBelow is a list of the record series covered by this search – click on the series links for more details on each series:\n\nADM 358, Missing naval personnel\n\nAIR 40, RAF escapees among records of the papers of the Air Ministry’s Directorate of Intelligence\n\nAIR 81, RAF missing personnel – these files may contain missing person and casualty action sheets, death certificates, personal letters and correspondence, exhumation reports, investigation reports, questionnaires by repatriated personnel and personal effects of POWs; you can also search these records by the place, date or location of the incident in which air crew went missing or by the type of aircraft (for example, Blenheim)\n\nBT 373, Merchant Navy prisoners of war – you can also search these records by ship and some of the records are available online at Findmypast (£) – see section 3\n\nCO 1070, Colonial Office card index of allied internees and some prisoners of war captured in Hong Kong and Malaya (index cards for names A-D are missing)\n\nWO 208, Escape and evasion reports\n\nWO 416, German record cards of British and Commonwealth POWs and civilian internees – not all the records in this series are yet open to the public as records remain closed for those born less than 100 years ago\n\nRecords of escape and evasion\n\nAmong the various records of the War Office’s Directorate of Military Operations and Intelligence held in series WO 208 are a number of different types of files relating to POWs who escaped camps or who evaded capture in enemy territory. Key among these are the escape and evasion reports covering prisoners held in Europe and North Africa. Files in WO 208 include:\n\nindividual accounts of capture, escape attempts or awards for those who assisted escape attempts\n\ndetailed recommendations for honours and awards made to foreign civilians and military personnel who assisted allied escape and evaders (in range WO 208/5451-5460)\n\ndetails of individuals who assisted evaders in Belgium and Luxemburg, Denmark, France, Greece, Holland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Italy and Poland which may provide limited personal information (in range WO 208/5461-5480)\n\nspecial questionnaires made by individuals about work of escape committees, escape aids, German Censorship and collection of geographic information which might assist future escape attempts (in range WO 208/5437-5450)\n\nYou should use one or both of the following two ways to find an escape and evasion report in WO 208:\n\nsearch by name for a reference to a report in WO 208 which you can use to order the original document – if the reference for the report itself does not appear in search results you may find a reference to one of the index cards once used to access the reports and this should, in turn, provide a catalogue reference to the report in WO 208 (each index card listing provides a prisoner’s name, rank, number and corps)\n\nsearch by name at Findmypast.co.uk (£) – this should provide either the report itself or a WO 208 index card reference which you can search for in our catalogue which will in turn provide a catalogue reference to the report in WO 208 (as above)\n\nThere are other series that cover POW escape and evasion records:\n\nReports of Royal Air Force POWs who escaped or evaded capture in AIR 40/1545-1552. These reports include internal indexes. Read our guide on RAF personnel for other records of RAF POWs.\n\nescape and evasion maps produced by MI9 between 1940 and 1945 in series WO 418. Escape maps and plans can also be found within the escape and evasion reports in WO 208.\n\nRecords of liberated prisoners\n\nThe two most significant sets of records created to document the experiences and individual details of prisoners were:\n\nLiberation questionnaires – these were questionnaires put to liberated prisoners to document their experiences. As indicated in section 3, you can search for these questionnaires online at Ancestry.co.uk, though the online images and indexes exclude individuals born less than 100 years ago. The original questionnaires are arranged in alphabetical surname ranges (separately for Germany and Japan). You can browse WO 344 by these ranges.\n\nLiberation and interrogation reports – these reports may provide more details than the liberation questionnaires. Some contain details of escape attempts, intelligence details and so on. Search for liberation reports by surname and either first name or initials in WO 208 or the search box above. Search results may include other types of documents held in WO 208.\n\nHowever, not all interrogation reports are searchable by name in our catalogue. If your name search fails then you should try consulting the card index for these records. sorted by prisoners’ names, in the reading rooms at The National Archives. Use the guide ‘reports by prisoners of war, Second World War’ available in the reading rooms for guidance on how to find references and the explanation of the appendices."
