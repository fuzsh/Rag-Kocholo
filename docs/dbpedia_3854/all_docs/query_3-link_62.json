        "text": "My husband, Benjamin W. Barr, Sr., served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean Conflict. He believed in freedom for everyone. He loved his country and our flag. I have listened to my husband talk of the war and watched the tears fall down his face. But when I asked him and my uncles who served in World War II and Korea why they went in to the service, their answer was simply, \"So our brothers, sisters and our children to come wouldn't have to go.\" They gave so much so we would be free and safe.\n\nJanice A. Barr, Medway\n\nMy father, Benjamin W. Barr, Sr., served in the Korean Conflict. Although he was not an honored hero in a military way, he will always be my hero. Also, his dedication to veterans, their families, and our community is an honor in itself. He loved his country, the State of Maine, and veterans in general. At his memorial service a gentleman said it about as well as anyone possibly could: \"I feel I am standing in the shadow of a very great man.\" Indeed sir, you were.\n\nKimberly M. Lyons, Lincoln\n\nI am voting in honor of my brother, William J. Champlin, who served in the Army in Korea. He helped lead 7 men to safety from behind enemy lines.\n\nFrancis T. Champlin, Van Buren\n\nServed from 1957-1961\n\nI will vote in honor of my husband, Petty Officer, 2nd class, Paul Joseph Pepin, who served in the Navy for four years during the Korean Conflict. He served aboard the battleship New Jersey and took part in ship to shore bombardments, making it safer for the ground crews to do their jobs. He was the recipient of three battle stars and the Korean Presidential Unit of Citation, among others. I am very proud of him and the positive attitude he has regarding the defense of our great country.\n\nJoyce H. Pepin, Newport\n\nThe Maine Korean War Memorial was dedicated July 29, 1995, two days after the national memorial was dedicated in Washington, D.C.\n\nIt is located on a beautiful site next to a tranquil pond in Mt. Hope Cemetery, Bangor, Maine, and it salutes all veterans of the first United Nations action since the end of the Second World War.\n\nThe memorial reflects the work of a small group of Korean War Veterans who began in 1992 to plan how to construct an appropriate memorial to the Korean War honoring all Maine servicemen and women, especially those who were killed in Korea.\n\nOn polished granite slabs are engraved the names of 233 Maine men who died in Korea. Eight additional names are to be added as a result of further investigations. The memorial also provides visitors with a history lesson about the \"Forgotten War\".\n\nMy grandfather, Kenneth L. Hall, Sr., was in the Navy during the Korean Conflict. He was a gunner's mate on a ship. While he was serving, he contracted pneumatic fever and was sent home. He and my grandmother were married for 45 years before he passed away in 1995. I would like to vote in his memory and in honor of a time in his life of which he was very proud but spoke little.\n\nJennifer M. Bassett, Auburn\n\nI will vote in honor of my wife, Shirley Ayer Lupo, who joined the Navy in 1952 but was required to be discharged in 1955 because she got married. (At that time if a female married, she had to leave the military.) Her most interesting flight was in 1954 when she took French troops from Indo-China back to Paris.\n\nRaymond R. Lupo, Hampden\n\nServed 5 years in the Navy and 15 years\n\nin the Air Force in Korea, Vietnam and the Congo\n\nMy brother, Norman O'Clair, served our country in the Army during the Korean Conflict. He was the sole survivor of a landslide and was seriously injured. He is now 71 years old. I admire his bravery and sacrifice. He is the oldest of fourteen children and I am the youngest. He got news of my birth while on a hospital ship on his way back home to the states. Another brother, Paul, wanted to be with Norman in Korea and lied about his age to join the Army. He was on his way to Korea the same time Norman was on his way back home.\n\nCatherine Herson, Sorrento"
