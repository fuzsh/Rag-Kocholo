        "text": "The directly elected president is a largely symbolic figure, with formal powers limited to the right to veto legislation and make certain appointments. The president may serve up to two five-year terms. Timorese participated in a two-round presidential election in 2022. Sixteen candidates competed in first round, a record. Former president José Ramos-Horta defeated the incumbent, Lú-Olo of Fretilin, in the April run-off with 62.1 percent of the vote. Turnout stood at 77.3 percent in the first round and 75.2 percent in the second. Ramos-Horta was supported by Xanana Gusmão of the CNRT.\n\nThe leader of the majority party or coalition in Parliament becomes prime minister and serves as head of government. In June 2018, former independence fighter and former president José Maria Vasconcelos, popularly known as Taur Matan Ruak, was sworn in as prime minister. He remained in that post when Fretilin, the People’s Liberation Party (PLP), and the Party for the Enhancement of Timorese National Unity (KHUNTO) formed a governing coalition in May 2020.\n\nMembers of the 65-seat, unicameral Parliament are directly elected and serve five-year terms. Following a minority government’s failure to pass a budget, the president dissolved Parliament in January 2018. Polls were held that May. The sitting opposition parties—the CNRT, KHUNTO, and the PLP—formed the Change for Progress Alliance (AMP) coalition and won an outright majority of 34 seats. Fretilin won 23, the Democratic Party won 5, and the Democratic Development Front won 3. European Union (EU) observers called elections “transparent, well-managed and credible.” Polls were generally peaceful and orderly, despite a few violent incidents during the campaign period.\n\nA new governing coalition of the PLP, KHUNTO, and Fretilin was formed in May 2020, three months after Parliament failed to approve a budget. The CNRT triggered that failure by abstaining but was ultimately unable to muster a new coalition of its own.\n\nEU observers present for the 2022 presidential election noted that the National Election Commission (CNE) benefited from legal changes introduced after the last parliamentary election. The observers also reported that local stakeholders viewed the CNE and the Technical Secretariat for Electoral Administration as professional and independent.\n\nProvisions governing elections are found across several pieces of legislation. EU observers reported that some of these laws “are not organised coherently” and that some of the framework is ambiguous in practice.\n\nPolitical parties are generally free to operate. Some campaign-finance regulations favor larger parties. These include a lack of spending caps and a system in which government campaign subsidies are awarded after elections, according to the number of votes a party has won.\n\nTwo new parties, youth-aligned KHUNTO and the PLP, won 13 parliamentary seats between them in 2017. They joined AMP in the 2018 elections and formed a governing coalition with Fretilin in 2020.\n\nEthnic minorities are generally well represented in politics.\n\nWhile male independence leaders often hold key political roles and dominate elite political circles, 40 percent of parliamentarians are women. Four women ran for president in the 2022 elections. One-third of electoral-list candidates must be female. Women are massively underrepresented at the local level. Observers suggest that few women would seek office except for the existence of gender-parity legislation.\n\nAnticorruption bodies lack enough funding to operate effectively. The independent Anti-Corruption Commission (CAC) was established in 2009 with no powers of arrest or prosecution. It relies on the prosecutor general, with input from police and the courts, to prosecute corruption cases. An anticorruption law including protections for whistleblowers and witnesses came into force in 2021. That same year, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime provided manuals for the CAC to help it enforce the new law.\n\nWhile media freedom is constitutionally protected, domestic media outlets are vulnerable to political pressure and self-censorship due to the small media market with limited nongovernmental sources of support. However, journalists still produce articles critical of the government.\n\nIn May 2022, government minister Francisco Martins da Costa Pereira Jerónimo filed a defamation claim against Francisco Belo Simões da Costa, editor in chief of the Hatutan news outlet. Hatutan had published an article alleging that a government project was affected by corruption. In October, the national police summoned the editor in chief and another journalist at the Jornal Independente after it published articles discussing misconduct allegations against National Intelligence Service official Gastão Pereira.\n\nJournalists reporting on allegations of abuse within the Roman Catholic Church have faced official scrutiny. In January 2022, the Tempo Timor outlet said it was subpoenaed over its coverage of a Roman Catholic priest’s report on abuse which openly identified victims. In June, journalist Raimundos Oki was placed under investigation for violating judicial secrecy after he interviewed girls who said they were abused by defrocked priest Richard Daschbach; Daschbach was convicted of child sexual abuse in 2021.\n\nWhile freedom of assembly is constitutionally guaranteed and generally respected in practice, some laws can be invoked to restrict peaceful gatherings. Demonstrations must be authorized in advance, and those deemed to be “questioning constitutional order” or disparaging the reputations of the head of state and other government officials are prohibited.\n\nIn November 2022, the National Maubere Alliance began holding regular protests in front of Parliament, calling for increased spending for public services. Police detained 37 protesters in mid-November; 26 were later charged with a penal-code violation, but they were reportedly acquitted.\n\nWorkers may form and join labor unions and bargain collectively, though a 2011 law requires written notification of demands and a response from employers in advance of striking. If employers do not respond or if an agreement is not reached within 20 days, then five days’ notice is required for a strike. In practice, few workers are unionized due to high unemployment and informal economic activity.\n\nDue process rights are often restricted or denied, owing in part to a dearth of resources and personnel leading to case backlogs. Use of Portuguese for court administration poses an obstacle, and shortages of interpreters have sometimes forced adjournment of trials.\n\nCases involving past human rights abuses require a panel including two international judges. The 2014 dismissals of international judges interrupted these cases and no new cases have been brought since.\n\nAlternative methods of dispute resolution and customary law are widely used, though they lack enforcement mechanisms and have other shortcomings, including gender discrimination.\n\nMany municipalities have no fixed courts and rely on mobile services established as an interim measure. Plans for a hybrid justice system, with more harmonization between formal and customary dispute resolution mechanisms, have been announced.\n\nWhile hate crimes based on sexual orientation are considered an aggravating circumstance in the penal code, other protections against discrimination for LGBT+ people are lacking. Gay men and transgender women have trouble accessing employment opportunities due to low rates of access to education and discrimination. Lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals report cases of extreme physical violence from strangers and relatives, including cases of “corrective” rape and forced marriage. Equal rights for women are constitutionally guaranteed, but discrimination and gender inequality persist in practice and in customary law.\n\nReligious minorities have reported difficulties in authorities’ acceptance of marriage and birth certificates issued by religious entities. Muslims have reported discrimination in civil service hiring.\n\nTimor-Leste is a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention. However, asylum seekers must apply for asylum within 72 hours of arriving under the 2017 Migration and Asylum Law."
