In addition, we also grant traineeships by way of derogation to a limited number of nationals from other countries.\n\nThis type of traineeship is addressed to young people who have a university degree or have completed three years of study (at least six terms) at a university or an equivalent institute of higher education.\n\nThe EPP Group covers the cost of living in Brussels with a monthly allowance of â‚¬1.500.\n\nUnpaid, short-term traineeships of a maximum length of 3 months (when the traineeship is compulsory in the framework of the university studies)\n\nThis type of traineeship is addressed to university students who have not yet completed at least six terms at university and when the traineeship is a compulsory part of their studies. This has to be justified by a letter provided by the university. The EPP Group can offer a limited number of this type of traineeship.\n\nMoreover, the EPP Group has a compulsory, primary sickness and accident insurance for trainees. All trainees get to attend one plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.\n\nAs an equal opportunities employer, we encourage applications from young people with disabilities."
