        "text": "Holotype:\n\nAMNH 138547, adult male, collected at Yungas, 3600 ft, 16.20S, 66.45W (Paynter, 1992), Cochabamba, Bolivia, on 3 June 1915, by Leo Miller (no. 12186) and Howarth Boyle.\n\nComments:\n\nChapman cited the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and listed (on pp. 27–28) specimens that he included in maculosus. Of the 12 male (in addition to the type) and eight female Bolivian specimens he included, I found the following nine male and six female paratypes cataloged in AMNH: Yungas, AMNH 138546, 138548–138554, four males and four females, June 1915, by Miller and Boyle; Locotal, AMNH 138556, 138557, two females, May 1915, by Miller and Boyle; Todos Santos, AMNH 138544, 138545, two males, July 1915, by Miller and Boyle; Mission San Antonio, Rio Chimoré, AMNH 138555, male, August 1915, by Miller and Boyle; Tres Arroyas, Rio Espiritu Santo, AMNH 148980, male, February 1915, by G.K. Cherrie; Beni River, AMNH 30651, male, August 1886, by H.H. Rusby. Of these I did not find AMNH 138550 in the collection. I found only one of the Peruvian paratypes in AMNH: Chauillay, Urubamba Cañon, AMNH 145816, male, July 1916, by Chapman and Cherrie. I found 32 of the 33 Brazilian paratypes in AMNH: Urucum near Corumbá, AMNH 128324–128327, two males and two females, December 1913, by Miller and Cherrie; Chapada, AMNH 32804–32827, 32829–32832, 16 males, 12 females, by H.H. Smith, 1882–1885. While 13 females were indicated, only 12 were entered in the AMNH catalog. AMNH 32832bis was not considered a paratype because all of the listed males were found and because the “bis” number was added after the other specimens were cataloged and the specimen label did not bear Chapman's measurements, as had all of the other specimens. AMNH 32828, also a male, had been mounted for exhibition in 1905 and would not have been available to Chapman when he named maculosus. Other paratypes were borrowed by Chapman, but he did not indicate which specimens they were.\n\nFraga (2011: 754) noted that recent DNA studies do not support recognition of maculosus and he synonymized it with nominate decumanus.\n\nOstinops sincipitalis neglectus Chapman\n\nOstinops sincipitalis neglectus Chapman, 1914: 190 (Monteredondo, eastern slope of Eastern Andes, alt. 5800 ft).\n\nNow Psarocolius angustifrons neglectus (Chapman, 1914). See Hellmayr, 1937: 23; Blake, 1968: 141; Dickinson, 2003: 768; and Fraga, 2011: 753–754.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 123115, adult male, collected at Monteredondo, ca. 04.17N, 73.48W (Paynter, 1997), Cundinamarca, eastern slope of the eastern Andes, Colombia, on 1 March 1913, by T.M. Ring.\n\nComments:\n\nChapman cited the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and gave details for three paratypes. I can verify only one of the paratypes: AMNH 100917, male, collected near Mérida, Pedregosa, 2000 m, 30 November 1902, by S. Briceño Gabaldón. Chapman (1914: 190) listed two additional paratypes, “an adult male and female from the eastern slope below Andalucia (5000 ft).” There are three specimens, AMNH 117486–117488, labeled as from Andalucia, 5000 ft, one unsexed and two sexed as females, but judging by size, one female and two males, all three collected on 10 June 1912 by Miller. They were all labeled neglectus with one additionally marked “near alfredi.” AMNH 117489, sexed as a male, was collected on the eastern slope below Caquetá, 2500 ft, on 22 June 1912 by Miller. It has no yellow on the forehead and is labeled “angustifrons + neglectus” and is discussed as a possible intergrade by Chapman (1917: 627).\n\nChapman (1917: 50–58) gave details of this expedition. Ring was collecting at Monteredondo while the rest of the expedition personnel were based at Quetame, which name appears on the AMNH label of this specimen. However, Ring's field label gives the correct locality, as did Chapman in the description of neglectus.\n\nCassicus (sic) vitellinus Lawrence\n\nCassicus (sic) vitellinus Lawrence, 1864: 107 (New Granada, Isthmus of Panama).\n\nNow Cacicus cela vitellinus (Lawrence, 1864). See Hellmayr, 1937: 28–29; Blake, 1968: 144; Wetmore et al., 1984: 346–349; Dickerman, 2003: 769; and Fraga, 2011: 749–750.\n\nSyntypes:\n\nAMNH 41901, male, and AMNH 41902, female, collected in New Granada, Isthmus of Panama, in the “winter” of 1860–1861, by James McLeannan and John R. Galbraith. From the George N. Lawrence Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nWhen Lawrence (1861a: 297) first received the the first of these specimens, he misidentified it as Cassiculus icteronotus Vieillot, 1816, but without giving any details. Later, after receiving a second specimen he realized his mistake, and named Cassicus vitellinus, describing both male and female but without specifying the number of specimens he had. The wing and tail measurements published with his description of the male and female are the same as those written on the labels of the syntypes, and both are marked “Type” by Lawrence. Apparently, the female syntype is the specimen that Lawrence had originally, as it bears one label marked “Cassicus icteronotus” in Lawrence's hand, with a second label marked “Cassicus vitellinus” and “Type” by Lawrence. It is possible for Lawrence to have received this specimen from the joint collectors prior to his publication of Part 1 of his catalog in January 1861, as their collecting was done in the “winter” of 1860–1861.\n\nThere are two additional, undated, specimens of this form from the Lawrence Collection, collected by McLeannan. McLeannan collected alone both before and after his joint collecting with Galbraith, and these two specimens, AMNH 41903 and 41904, were probably collected later, as both have labels bearing only the name C. vitellinus. They are not marked “Type.”\n\nFraga (2011: 749) suggested that subspecies vitellinus and flavicrissus may represent a species separate from C. cela based on differences in plumage color and voice, but retained them in the one species.\n\nCacicus uropygialis pacificus Chapman\n\nCacicus uropygialis pacificus Chapman, 1915: 657 (Alto Bonito, R. Sucio, Chocó, Colombia).\n\nNow Cacicus uropygialis pacificus Chapman, 1915. See Hellmayr, 1937: 33–34; Blake, 1968: 145–146; Dickinson, 2003: 769; and Fraga, 2011: 748–749.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 134533, adult male, collected at Alto Bonito, 1500 ft, ca. 07.05N, 76.30W (Paynter, 1997), Antioquia, Colombia, on 17 February 1915, by Leo Miller (no. 11227) and Howarth Boyle.\n\nComments:\n\nChapman gave the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and gave measurements for 13 males (including the type) and seven females from Colombia and Ecuador. The following specimens are considered paratypes of pacificus: Colombia, Rio Salaqui, AMNH 113363, male, 23 February 1912, by Kerr; Alto Bonito, AMNH 134534, male [female], 18 February, AMNH 134535, 134537, males, 23 February, AMNH 134538, sex?, 17 February, AMNH 134539, female, 23 February, all collected in 1915 by Miller and Boyle; Baudo, AMNH 123504, male, 29 June, AMNH 123505, male, 17 June, both collected in 1912 by Kerr, the latter specimen exchanged to O. Bangs in 1918, now in MCZ; Barbacoas, AMNH 118349, male, 3 September, AMNH 118350, female?, 1 September (measurments on label), AMNH 118353, female, 5 August (no measurementson label), all collected in 1912 by W.B. Richardson; Puerto Valdivia, AMNH 134531, 134532, males, 14 December 1914, by Miller and Boyle, the latter specimen exchanged with Bangs in September 1918 and now in MCZ; La Vieja, AMNH 123506, female, 2 October 1912, by Kerr. Ecuador, Esmeraldas, AMNH 119038, male, 27 October, AMNH 119039, female, 24 October (exchanged to ANSP in 1928), AMNH 119040, female, 25 October (exchanged to MCZ in 1928), AMNH 119041, male, 24 October, AMNH 119042, male, 20 November, AMNH 119043, male, 27 November, all collected by Richardson in 1912.\n\nI was not able to verify that the following specimens should be considered paratypes: AMNH 134536, male, Alto Bonito, 19 February 1915 was exchanged with USNM, no date, and was perhaps not available to Chapman. AMNH 118351, female, Barbacoas, 22 August 1912, was exchanged to USNM, no date, and I did not find AMNH 118352, male, Barbacoas, 18 August 1912 in the collection. AMNH 155193, although collected by Richardson on 24 August 1912 at Barbacoas, was not cataloged until 1920, and then only to genus. It is not a paratype.\n\nChapman (1917: 58–68, 640) gave more information on the Miller and Boyle expedition and the locality Alto Bonito.\n\nThe subspecies pacificus is usually considered a subspecies of C. uropygialis, but Fraga (2011: 749) has separated the subspecies pacificus and microrhynchus as the separate species C. microrhynchus based on vocal differences. He also suggested that pacificus may merit treatment as a full species based on vocal differences, but that more research is required.\n\nAmblycercus holosericeus flavirostris Chapman\n\nAmblycercus holosericeus flavirostris Chapman, 1915: 659 (Barbacoas, Nariño, Colombia).\n\nNow Amblycercus holosericeus flavirostris Chapman, 1915. See Chapman, 1917b; Hellmayr, 1937: 43–44; Blake, 1968: 148; AOU, 1998: 656; Dickinson, 2003: 769; and Fraga, 2011: 747.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 118354, adult female, collected at Barbacoas, sea level, 01.21N, 78.09W (Paynter, 1997), Nariño, Colombia, on 13 August 1912, by W.B. Richardson.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Chapman cited the AMNH number of the holotype and listed the specimens he had measured. There are also a few additional specimens in the same series that would have been accessible to Chapman but may not have been measured. These are also included as paratypes, as is a specimen from Guineo, Rio Calima, Colombia, recorded by Hellmayr (1911: 1122) and included in flavirostris by Chapman. Paratypes in AMNH: Colombia, “Bogotá,” AMNH 41929, 41930, sex?, undated, from the G.N. Lawrence Collection; El Piñon, AMNH 123122, female, 6 April 1913, by Chapman et al.; Rio Toché, AMNH 113198, female, 26 October 1911, by Allen and Miller; Los Tambos, AMNH 71624, male, 18 August 1898, by J.H. Batty; Alto Bonito, AMNH 134540, female, 17 February 1915, by Miller and Boyle. Ecuador, Esmeraldas, AMNH 119044–119046, males, AMNH 119047, 119048, females, 21 October–8 November 1912, by Richardson; Naranjo, AMNH 125220–125222, one male, two females, 8–11 May 1913, by Richardson; Santa Rosa, AMNH 130542, 130543, two females, 8–11 September 1913, by Richardson; Guayaquil, AMNH 130544, male, 15 August 1913, by Richardson. AMNH 119044 was exchanged to ANSP in 1928, and AMNH 119046 was exchanged to MCZ in 1928.\n\nThe affiliation of this species with the Icteridae is uncertain and more than one species may be involved (See AOU, 1998: 656, and Fraga, 2011: 747).\n\nAmblycercus holosericeus australis Chapman\n\nAmblycercus holosericeus australis Chapman, 1919: 333 (Incachaca (alt. 7700 ft), Prov. Cochabamba, Bolivia).\n\nNow Amblycercus holosericeus australis Chapman, 1919. See Hellmayr, 1937: 44–45; Blake, 1968: 149; Dickinson, 2003: 769; and Fraga, 2011: 747.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 138594, adult male, collected at Incachaca, 7700ft, 17.14S, 65.49W (Paynter, 1992), Cochabamba, Bolivia, on 12 May 1915, by Leo E. Miller (no. 11714) and Howarth Boyle.\n\nComments:\n\nChapman cited the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and examined an additional two Peruvian specimens from the Urubamba Valley. Chapman (1921b) did not include this species in his list of Urubamba Valley specimens and there are no Urubamba Valley specimens in AMNH or USNM (C. Milensky, personal commun.) that might have been part of the Yale University–National Geographic Society Expedition to the Urubamba Valley that Chapman had been studying when he described this subspecies. Most of the specimens from that expedition are in USNM, with a subset deposited at AMNH. Therefore, I have not been able to identify his paratypes.\n\nThere are four Peruvian specimens that would have been available to Chapman when he described australis. AMNH 166625, male, and AMNH 170769, female, collected by Watkins on 11 March 1917, from Limbani, Puno, Peru, have “Nat. Geog. Soc.” stamped on Watkins' field label; the male was cataloged with specimens from that expedition. AMNH 146600, male, and AMNH 146601, female, were collected by Watkins at Santo Domingo, Puno, Peru, on 24 September 1916 and purchased by AMNH from Watkins in 1918. Both of these localities are near the Bolivian border and far from the Urubamba Valley, and nothing on the labels of these specimens indicates that either pair might have been part of Chapman's description.\n\nIcterus hondae Chapman\n\nIcterus hondae Chapman, 1914: 191 (Honda, alt. 600 ft, Magdalena River, Colombia).\n\nNow Icterus chrysater hondae Chapman, 1914. See Hellmayr, 1937: 131–132; Blake, 1968: 151; Olson, 1981: 369–370; Omland et al., 1999; Dickinson, 2003: 771; and Fraga, 2011: 759.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 123163, adult male, collected at Honda, 600 ft, 05.12N, 74.45W (Paynter, 1997), Magdalena River, Colombia, on 3 February 1913, by Frank M. Chapman and George K. Cherrie.\n\nComments:\n\nChapman gave the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and noted that he had only one additional specimen. The paratype is: AMNH 123162, adult male, collected at Honda on 4 February 1913 by Chapman and Cherrie. Olson (1981: 369–370) and Dickinson (2003: 771) recognized hondae; Fraga (2011: 759) synonymized it with I. chrysater giraudii. Olson (1981: 370) gave characters for recognition of hondae based on the above two specimens, and noted that additional specimens of hondae from the upper Magdalelna River Valley are needed.\n\nIcterus xanthornus trinitatis Hartert\n\nIcterus xanthornus trinitatis Hartert, 1913: 76 (Savannah Grande, Trinidad).\n\nNow Icterus nigrogularis trinitatis Hartert, 1913. See Hellmayr, 1937: 134; Blake, 1968: 152; Omland et al., 1999; Dickinson, 2003: 771; and Fraga, 2011: 764–765.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 521859, adult male, collected at Savannah Grande, Trinidad, on 13 February 1897, by Percy Rendall (no. 56). From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nThis is the single specimen from the Rothschild Collection with these data and it was listed by Hartert (1919a: 136) as the type. In addition, specimens of this form in the Rothschild Collection, collected by André, were included. The paratypes, all collected by André, are: Trinidad, Caparo, AMNH 521836–521846, eight males, one immature male, two females, March–April 1902; “Trinidad,” original label lost, AMNH 521847, 1902; Pointe Gourde, AMNH 521848–521850, males, January 1903; Lavantill, AMNH 521851, 521852, males, March and April 1903; Chaguaramas, 521853–521855, males, January 1903; Leelet, AMNH 521858, male, July 1903. Two specimens, AMNH 521856 and 521857, collected by Carr at Caguaranas in May and June 1894, were not mentioned by Hartert and are not considered paratypes.\n\nIcterus pectoralis anthonyi Griscom\n\nIcterus pectoralis anthonyi Griscom, 1930: 18 (Finca El Cipres, near Ocos, Pacific coast of Guatemala [error]).\n\nNow Icterus pectoralis guttulatus Lafresnaye, 1844. See Griscom, 1932: 398–399; Hellmayr, 1937: 145; Blake, 1968: 154–155; Dickerman, 1981; and Dickinson, 2003: 770.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 398802, adult male, collected at Finca El Cipres, 9 mi from Mazatenango, Pacific slope, at base of Volcan Zumail, Suchitepequez (Griscom, 1932: 417, map), Guatemala, on 28 July 1924, by A.W. Anthony (no. 473). From the Jonathan Dwight Collection (no. 58330).\n\nComments:\n\nGriscom cited the Dwight Collection number of the holotype in the original description and noted that he had 48 specimens (including the type) from Guatemala and three from Nicaragua. Later, Griscom (1932: 398) listed the localities from which his Guatemalan specimens had come, but by that time did not include Nicaragua in the range. Of the 47 Guatemalan paratypes, 35 came to AMNH: Finca El Cipres, AMNH 398801, 398803–398806, 398808–398811, five males, four females, 27 July–1 August 1924; Finca El Espino, AMNH 398807, female, 23 July 1926; Hacienda California, AMNH 398812–398824, 398826–398828, eight males, eight females, 5–27 June 1926, 25 September–10 November 1927; Ocos, AMNH 398825, 398829, males, 24 October 1927, all by A.W. Anthony; Pantaleon, AMNH 399361–399366, two males, four females, 22 October–2 November 1919; San Felipe, AMNH 399367, male, 4 December 1919, all by Austin Paul Smith. I did not find paratypes AMNH 398816 and 398819 from Hacienda California in the AMNH collection and they were perhaps exchanged later, without the catalog having been marked. The Guatemalan collection was divided with MCZ before it was cataloged at AMNH and the other paratypes are probably there. I also did not find the three Nicaraguan specimens from Leon, Chinandega, and Volcan Viejo; these were perhaps borrowed from other institutions by Griscom.\n\nDickerman (1987: 84) called attention to the error in the location of the type locality given in the original description. Griscom (1932: 398) did not correct this in his text, but he did make a correction (Griscom, 1932: 417, map) without calling attention to the earlier error. Mazatenango is at 14.31N, 91.30W (Times atlas).\n\nThe subspecies anthonyi was recognized by Hellmayr (1937: 145), synonymized with I. pectoralis pectoralis by Blake (1968: 154–155), and synonymized with I. pectoralis guttlatus by Dickerman (1981), Dickinson (2003: 770), and Fraga (2011: 766).\n\nIcterus gularis troglodytes Griscom\n\nIcterus gularis troglodytes Griscom, 1930: 13 (San Felipe, Retalhuleu, Pacific slope of Guatemala).\n\nNow Icterus gularis mentalis Lesson, 1831. See Griscom, 1932: 396; Hellmayr, 1937: 148; Blake, 1968: 156; Dickinson, 2003: 771; Dickerman, 2007: 35–38; and Fraga, 2011: 765.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 399358, adult male, collected at San Felipe, 2500 ft, 14.40N, 91.30W (Times atlas), Retalhuleu, Pacific slope of Guatemala, on 7 December 1919, by Austin Paul Smith (no. 19209). From the Johathan Dwight Collection (no. 56504).\n\nComments:\n\nGriscom cited the Dwight number of the holotype in the original description, and noted (on p. 14) that he had 29 specimens from Ocos to San José (including the type), one male from Antigua and one male from San Lucas. Later, he (Griscom, 1932: 396) listed these 31 specimens by locality. Of the 30 paratypes, the following 21 are in AMNH: Finca El Cipres, AMNH 398723, 398725–398730, two males, one immature male, four females, 23 July–24 August 1924; Antigua, AMNH 398724, male, 6 June 1924; Hacienda California, AMNH 398731–398736, 398738, two males, four females, one immature female, 7 June–3 July 1926, 29 September 1927; Ocos, AMNH 398739, male (as on label), AMNH 398740, female, 14–16 October 1927; San Lucas, AMNH 398737, male, 27 May 1927, all collected by A.W. Anthony. Pantaleon, AMNH 399356, male, 18 October 1919; San Felipe, AMNH 399357, female, 5 December 1919; San José, AMNH 399359, male, 29 January 1920, all collected by Austin Paul Smith.\n\nHellmayr (1937: 148) noted that Icterus mentalis Lesson, 1831, could not be identified with certainty because the type locality was not recorded and recognized instead I. g. tamaulipensis Ridgway, 1901. Blake (1968: 156) and Dickinson (2003: 771) apparently accepted Hellmayr's analysis and listed tamaulipensis, yucatanensis, and troglodytes as valid subspecies of Icterus gularis without mentioning mentalis; Dickerman (2007: 35–38) accepted mentalis Lesson, 1831, as a valid name, restricted the type locality to the city of Veracruz and considered yucatanensis, tamaulipensis, and troglodytes to be synonyms of mentalis. This was accepted by Fraga (2011: 765).\n\nAs in the previous form, the collection was divided between AMNH and MCZ before it was cataloged. The remaining paratypes are probably at MCZ. See Casto and Burke (2010: 13) for information on Austin Paul Smith.\n\nIcterus gularis gigas Griscom\n\nIcterus gularis gigas Griscom, 1930: 13 (Sacapulas, Rio Negro Valley, central Guatemala).\n\nNow Icterus gularis gularis (Wagler, 1829). See Griscom, 1932: 396; Hellmayr, 1937: 148–149; Blake, 1968: 156; Dickinson, 2003: 771; Dickerman, 2007: 38; and Fraga, 2011: 765.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 398742, adult male, collected at Sacapulas, Río Negro Valley, central Guatemala, on 4 February 1928, by A.W. Anthony (no. 6513). From the Jonathan Dwight Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nGriscom cited Anthony's unique field number for the holotype in the original description; it had no Dwight Collection number. Griscom (1932: 396) noted that he had eight males and 10 females, including the type, from Sacapulas. Of the 17 paratypes, there are 11 at AMNH: AMNH 398741, 398743–398752, four males, seven females, 4 February–13 March 1928, by A.W. Anthony. This collection was divided with MCZ before cataloging, and the remaining paratypes may be in that institution.\n\nHellmayr (1937: 148–149) recognized gigas and considered xerophilus a synonym of it. Both Blake (1968: 156) and Dickinson (2003: 771) followed him. More recently both Dickerman (2007: 38) and Fraga (2011: 765) synonymized gigas and xerophilus with nominate gularis.\n\nSacapulas is on the Río Negro, 25 mi north of Quiché, at ca. 15.15N, 91.10W (Griscom, 1932: 421 and map). See Griscom (1932: 11–15) for a summary of Anthony's collecting localities.\n\nIcterus gularis xerophilus Griscom\n\nIcterus gularis xerophilus Griscom, 1930: 14 (Progreso, Motagua River Valley, central Guatemala).\n\nNow Icterus gularis gularis (Wagler, 1829).

Anthony (no. 287). From the Jonathan Dwight Collection (no. 58303).\n\nComments:\n\nGriscom cited the Dwight Collection number in the original description and said that he had 21 specimens, including the type, from Progreso; Griscom (1932: 396) noted that there were 16 males and five females. Of the 20 paratypes, the following 14 are cataloged in AMNH: AMNH 398753–398755, 398757–398767, eight males, two immature males, four females. I did not find AMNH 398762 in the collection and it is possible that it has been exchanged to another institution without the catalog having been marked. Part of this collection went to MCZ before cataloging and the remaining paratypes may be in that institution.\n\nHellmayr (1937: 148) recognized I. gularis gigas and synonymized xerophilus with it. Blake (1968: 156) and Dickinson (2003: 771) accepted that. More recently, Dickerman (2007: 38) synonymized both xerophilus and gigas with nominate gularis, and Fraga (2011: 765) agreed. Dickerman (2007: 38) incorrectly gave the original citation to I. g. xerophilus as Griscom (1930: 4); the description was on page 14.\n\nSee Griscom (1932: 11–15, 415, map) for more information on Anthony's collecting localities.\n\nIcterus pustulatus yaegeri Phillips\n\nIcterus pustulatus yaegeri Phillips, 1995: 101 (8 km north of crossing of Rio San Pedro at Peñitas, northwestern Nayarit).\n\nNow Icterus pustulatus yaegeri Phillips, 1995.

Phillips. From the Allan R. Phillips Collection (no. 4443).\n\nComments:\n\nPhillips gave his no. 4443 for the holotype in the original description. There is no indication on any specimens of pustulatus in AMNH that Phillips considered them paratypes of yaegeri. Dickerman and Parkes (1997: 231) and Dickinson (2003: 771) accepted yeageri, but Fraga (2011: 763) considered the diagnostic characters uncertain.\n\nIcterus pustulatus dickermani Phillips\n\nIcterus pustulatus dickermani Phillips, 1995: 101 (Joluchuca, 17°21½′ N, 101°12½′ W, southeast of Petatlán, southwestern Guerrero).\n\nNow Icterus pustulatus dickermani Phillips, 1995.

(no. 27). From the Allan R. Phillips Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Phillips gave Farfán's field number of the holotype. There is no indication on any AMNH specimens of pustulatus that Phillips considered them paratypes of dickermani. Dickerman and Parkes (1997: 231) and Dickinson (2003: 771) accepted dickermani as valid; Fraga (2011: 763) thought the diagnostic characters uncertain.\n\nIcterus pustulatus interior Phillips\n\nIcterus pustulatus interior Phillips, 1995: 101 (Cañón de Lobos 20 km east of Cuernavaca, Morelos).\n\nNow Icterus pustulatus interior Phillips, 1995. See Dickerman and Parkes, 1997: 231; Dickinson, 2003: 771; and Fraga, 2011: 763.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 831715, adult female, collected at Cañón de Lobos, 20 km east of Cuernavaca, 18.57N, 99.15W (Times atlas), Morelos, Mexico, on 4 November 1972, prepared by Santos Farfán B. From the Allan R. Phillips Collection (no. 10650).\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Phillips gave his collection number of the holotype. There is no indication on any AMNH specimens of pustulatus that Phillips considered them paratypes of interior. Dickerman and Parkes (1997: 231) and Dickinson (2003: 771) accepted interior as a valid subspecies of pustulatus; Fraga (2011: 763) thought the diagnostic characters uncertain.\n\nIcterus sclateri alticola Miller and Griscom\n\nIcterus sclateri alticola Miller and Griscom, 1925: 4 (Progreso, Guatemala).\n\nNow Icterus pustulatus alticola Miller and Griscom, 1925. See Griscom, 1932: 397; Hellmayr, 1937: 155–156; Blake, 1968: 157; Dickinson, 2003: 771; and Fraga, 2011: 763.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 398792, adult male, collected at Progreso, 17.18N, 90.08W (Times atlas), Guatemala, on 17 September 1924, by A.W. Anthony (no. 830). From the Jonathan Dwight Collection (no. 58978).\n\nComments:\n\nMiller and Griscom gave the Dwight Collection number of the holotype in the original description and listed one Guatemalan specimen collected by von Patten, three males, three females, one sex?, collected at Progreso, one female from Volcan Zunil, and one male from El Tanque, Nicaragua. At the time of publication of this name, Miller and Griscom (1925: 1) were working on their Nicaraguan collection and had borrowed specimens from Dwight and others for comparison. It is not now possible to tell which specimens from Progreso are paratypes of alticola as all of the Dwight specimens were cataloged together and Griscom identified and initialed them all as alticola. As the description was published in 1925, it seemed possible that only specimens collected in July 1924 were available. But this is not correct, because the type was collected in September 1924. Later, Griscom (1932: 397), when working with the entire Dwight Collection, noted that he had 22 specimens of alticola; there are 15 alticola, including the type, in AMNH. Because the collection was divided with MCZ, the remaining specimens may be in that institution and some of them may be paratypes. There are, however, two definite paratypes in AMNH: AMNH 42020, male, Guatemala, from Dr. v[on] P[atten], from the Lawrence Collection; and AMNH 144752, male, El Tanque, Nicaragua, 11 April 1917, by Miller, Griscom and Richardson (now considered a specimen of I. pustulatus sclateri). I did not find the female specimen from Volcan Zunil, Guatemala, listed by Miller and Griscom (1925: 4), and it was perhaps also borrowed. See Griscom (1932: 11–15, 420, map) for a summary of Anthony's collecting localities.\n\nIcterus sclateri maximus Griscom\n\nIcterus sclateri maximus Griscom, 1930: 15 (Sacapulas, Rio Negro Valley, interior of Guatemala).\n\nNow Icterus pustulatus maximus Griscom, 1930.

Anthony (no. 6563). From the Jonathan Dwight Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nGriscom cited Anthony's unique field number of the holotype in the original description (the specimen had no Dwight number), and (on p. 17) noted that he had 17 specimens. Griscom (1932: 397) gave these as 14 males and three females; the 11 paratypes, all from Sacapulas, in AMNH are: AMNH 398769–398771, 398773–398780, eight males, three females, 4 February–24 March 1928, by A.W. Anthony. Part of the collection was sent to MCZ before cataloging, therefore, the additional paratypes may be in that institution.\n\nHellmayr (1937: 156) considered maximus a synonym of alticola, and was followed by Blake (1968: 157). Howell and Webb (1995: 748) recognized maximus, as did Dickinson (2003: 771) and Fraga (2011: 763).\n\nGriscom (1932: 421, map) noted that Sacapulas was 25 mi north of Quiché, at ca. 15.15N, 91.10W.\n\nIcterus cucullatus masoni Griscom\n\nIcterus cucullatus masoni Griscom, 1926: 18 (Manatee, British Honduras).\n\nNow Icterus cucullatus igneus Ridgway, 1885.

Ingraham.\n\nComments:\n\nThe AMNH number of the holotype was given in the original description, although AMNH was not mentioned. There are four paratypes: Mexico, Quintana Roo, AMNH 254755, Chunyaxche, adult male, 30 January; AMNH 254756, immature male, Palmul, 9 February; AMNH 254757, female, Vigia Chica, 27 January, all collected in 1926 by Griscom. “Honduras,” AMNH 42001, male, from the Lawrence Collection.\n\nXanthornus icterus ridgwayi Hartert\n\nXanthornus icterus ridgwayi Hartert, 1902b: 299 (Aruba).\n\nNow Icterus icterus ridgwayi (Hartert, 1902).

From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Hartert designated as holotype the male specimen he collected on Aruba on 26 June 1892 and said that he had five specimens from Aruba and Curaçao. Only four specimens from those two islands came to AMNH with the Rothschild Collection, and they were, in fact, the only four specimens listed by Hartert (1893a: 297), although the date for the Aruba specimens was incorrectly given as 27 June. The whereabouts of the fifth specimen is not known. Paratypes in AMNH: Curaçao, near Beekenburg, AMNH 521889, female, AMNH 521890, male, 2 August 1892, by Ernst Hartert (nos. 264 and 266, respectively); Aruba, AMNH 521892, female, 26 June 1892, by Ernst Hartert (no. 106).\n\nHartert (1893a) had earlier reported on his visit to the Dutch West Indies.\n\nPsarocolius auricollis Wied\n\nPsarocolius auricollis Wied, 1839: 367 (Fort Pierre, South Dakota).\n\nNow Icterus bullockii (Swainson, 1827). See Hellmayr, 1937: 104–105; Blake, 1968: 161; Dickinson, 2003: 771; and Fraga, 2011: 763–764.\n\nType:\n\nAMNH 2230. Information regarding this specimen is here summarized, but no decision on its type status could be reached.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, D.G. Elliot owned one of the most complete collections of species of birds from North America. In 1868, when Elliott was planning a lengthy but indefinite stay in Europe, he became concerned for the safety of his collection while he was away and offered it to the then-forming AMNH. The approximately 1100 specimens were purchased as the first collection for the new museum. His specimens were mounted for exhibit by John G. Bell, a New York taxidermist, and were put on display in the Arsenal in Central Park, headquarters for the new museum until a permanent home could be provided (Anon., 1915: 133). At the same time, Elliot was authorized to purchase in Europe for the new museum several collections of specimens of birds and mammals. His selections included a large number of Maximilian, Prince of Wied, specimens from Brazil. These were mounted specimens also intended for display. It was not until 1883 that the AMNH bird catalog was begun with, at that time, separate volumes for mounted specimens and study skins. The Elliot and Wied collections, along with several other collections of mounted birds were combined and arranged systematically before they were entered in the catalog.\n\nAMNH 2230 was originally entered in the catalog as a male from the upper Missouri River from the Elliot Collection. In addition to his collections in Brazil, Wied led an expedition to the upper Missouri River in 1832–1834. It is entirely possible that Elliot had this specimen, which appears to be a Wied specimen, in his North American collection and had purchased it long before he purchased the Wied South American specimens for AMNH. Later, someone has overwritten “Elliot Collection” with “Maximilian Coll.” On the type label is a note “See mounted catalogue for note by J.T.Z.” Zimmer, opp. #2230, noted “Type of Psarocolius auricollis Wied?”\n\nThere is no longer an original label on the specimen, only an exhibit label, which is printed as being from the Elliot Collection. The locality on these exhibit labels is usually printed, but in this case, a strip of paper has been glued over the printed locality and “western North America” added in pen. It probably originally said “Upper Missouri” as in the catalog.\n\nApparently, this specimen had been chosen, and the catalog so stamped, to be sent on exchange to Queens College in August 1953. It was probably investigated by Zimmer at that time and found to be a possible type. Hellmayr (1937: 104) had noted that the type was in AMNH. The catalog was then marked “Dismounted for Study Collection” and a “type?” label added by Zimmer.\n\nHellmayr (1937: 104) gave the type locality as Fort Pierre, South Dakota, and Wied (1839: 367) described P. auricollis in Chapter 11, “Reise von Catonment Leavenworth bis zu den Punca-Indianern, vom 22. April bis zum 12. Mai.” The above specimen may well be one of the specimens collected by Wied at that time, but because of lack of definite information on its provenance, it seems impossible to be sure of its status.\n\nXanthornus affinis Lawrence\n\nXanthornus affinis Lawrence, 1851: 113 (Rio Grande, Texas).\n\nNow Icterus spurius spurius (Linnaeus, 1766). See Hellmayr, 1937: 105–107; Blake, 1968: 161–162; Scharf and Kren, 1996: 3; Omland et al., 1999; Dickinson, 2003: 770; and Fraga, 2011: 770.\n\nSyntypes:\n\nAMNH 41954 (Lawrence no. a414a), adult male, AMNH 14958 (c414a), immature male, AMNH 41960 (b414a), all collected at Brownsville, 25.54N, 97.30W (Times atlas), Rio Grande, Texas, by J.P. McCown. From the George N. Lawrence Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nLawrence did not designate a type in the original description and described both the adult male and immature male. Five specimens, all male, of this form were cataloged with the Lawrence Collection at AMNH, but I have found only three, two adult males and one immature male, still present in the collection. Only AMNH 41954 is marked “Type” by Lawrence and is the only specimen that had been included in the AMNH type collection. AMNH type labels have been added to the other two specifomens and they have been added to the type collection. The other two specimens, AMNH 41956, 41962, males, collected in Texas by McCown, if found, should also probably be considered syntypes, although none of the specimens is dated. If either of these specimens had been exchanged, the most likely recipients would have been ANSP or USNM, but neither N. Rice (personal commun.), ANSP, nor C. Milensky (personal commun.), USNM, found them in those collections.\n\nAlthough some authors record this name as having been introduced in 1852, it appeared in the section of volume 5 of the Annals published in May 1851 (not 1881, Foster, 1892: 2). In the original description, Lawrence said that affinis was found breeding in April and that his specimens had been collected in “the past year,” i.e., 1850. On the labels of all three syntypes, Lawrence recorded the collecting locality as Brownsville.\n\nFraga (2011: 770) treated I. spurius as monotypic.\n\nIcterus spurius phillipsi Dickerman and Warner\n\nIcterus spurius phillipsi Dickerman and Warner, 1962: 311 (1 mile west of Acámbaro, Guanajuato, México).\n\nNow Icterus spurius phillipsi Dickerman and Warner, 1962. See Blake, 1968: 162; Scharf and Kren, 1996: 3; Dickinson, 2003: 770; Dickerman, 2007: 34; and Fraga, 2011: 770.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 817691, adult male, collected 1 mi west of Acámbaro, 20.01N, 101.42W (Times atlas), Guanajuato, Mexico, on 7 May 1958, by Robert W. Dickerman (no. 8746). From the James Ford Bell Museum of Natural History (no. 14167, formerly Minnesota Museum of Natural History, MMNH).\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Dickerman and Warner gave the MMNH number of the holotype and noted (on p. 312) that they examined 80 specimens of phillipsi. Because Dickerman and Warner borrowed widely for their study and because none of the AMNH specimens have an indication that they were considered paratypes of phillipsi, I have been unable to verify that any of the paratypes are in AMNH.\n\nFraga (2011: 770) treated I. spurius as monotypic.\n\nIcterus fuertesi Chapman\n\nIcterus fuertesi Chapman, 1911: 3 (Paso del Haba, south shore of Tamesi River, 35 miles northwest of Tampico, Mexico).\n\nNow Icterus spurius fuertesi Chapman, 1911.

Fuertes (no. 2200).\n\nComments:\n\nChapman gave the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and noted that he had four specimens. Two of the three paratypes are in AMNH: AMNH 95907, immature male, AMNH 95908, female, collected at the type locality on 7 April 1910 by F.M. Chapman. The fourth paratype remained in Fuertes' Collection (no. 2201). This new form was illustrated by Fuertes in plate 1, opposite page 1 of the description.\n\nScharf and Kren (1996: 3) and Fraga (2011: 770) treated I. fuertesi as a separate monotypic species, but other authors have maintained it as a subspecies of Icterus spurius.\n\nIcterus prosthemelas praecox Phillips and Dickerman\n\nIcterus prosthemelas praecox Phillips and Dickerman, 1965: 298 (Almirante, Bocas del Toro Province, western Panamá).\n\nNow Icterus prosthemelas praecox Phillips and Dickerman, 1965. See Blake, 1968: 162; Wetmore et al., 1984: 367–368; Dickerman and Parkes, 1997: 231; Omland et al., 1999; Dickinson, 2003: 770; and Fraga, 2011: 770.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 248065 (not 392316), juvenile male, collected at Almirante, 09.20N, 82.18W (Siegel and Olson, 2008), Bocas del Toro Province, western Panamá, on 22 August 1927, by R.R. Benson (no. 797).\n\nComments:\n\nAs noted by Charles O'Brien on the AMNH type card, the AMNH number of the holotype was erroneously recorded as AMNH 392316; Dickerman and Parkes (1997: 231) also call attention to this error. The holotype is AMNH 248065. There were four paratypes recorded from Costa Rica, only two of which are in AMNH: Estrella Valley, Atalanta, AMNH 392315, 392316, immature males, both collected on 1 July 1921, by Austin Paul Smith.\n\nIcterus northropi Allen\n\nIcterus northropi Allen, 1890: 344 (Andros Island, Bahamas).\n\nNow Icterus northropi Allen, 1890. See Hellmayr, 1937: 117; Blake, 1968: 163; Omland et al., 1999; Dickinson, 2003: 770; Garrido et al., 2005; and Fraga, 2011: 771.\n\nSyntypes:\n\nAMNH 49911, adult male, AMNH 49912, adult female, collected on Andros Island, Bahamas, on 3 June and 14 April 1890, by John I. Northrop.\n\nComments:\n\nBecause syntypes were designated in the original description, other specimens have no nomenclatural standing. Northrop (1891) published on his specimens and observations of the birds on Andros and illustrated I. northropi in a plate. I. northropi has usually been considered a subspecies of I. dominicensis, but most recent authors support full species status for it.\n\nAgelaius phoeniceus arthuralleni Dickerman\n\nAgelaius phoeniceus arthuralleni Dickerman, 1974: 8 (Lago Peten Itza, Departamento Peten, Guatemala).\n\nNow Agelaius phoeniceus arthuralleni Dickerman, 1974. See Dickinson, 2003: 774; and Fraga, 2011: 789.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 803755, female, collected at Lago Petén Itzá, ca. 17.00N, 89.30W, Petén, Guatemala, on 20 February 1968, by Robert W. Dickerman (no. 14026).\n\nComments:\n\nDickerman cited the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and said that he examined specimens from Lago Petén Itzá, Laguna Perdida, and L. de Zolz. The following AMNH specimens from Petén Itzá, sexed as females, are considered paratypes: AMNH 803748, 803750, 803752, 803754, 803756–803758, 803760, all collected on 19–20 February 1968, by Dickerman.\n\nThe AMNH number of this holotype is AMNH 803755, not 805755 as cited by Dickerman (1987: 83).\n\nAgelaius xanthophthalmus Short\n\nAgelaius xanthophthalmus Short, 1969: 1 (15 km north-northeast of Tingo María, 4 km north of the Tulumayo River, and about 2 km northwest of the village of Pumahuasi, elevation approximately 2150 feet, Depto. Huánuco, Perú).\n\nNow Agelasticus xanthophthalmus (Short, 1969). See Johnson and Lanyon, 1999; Dickinson, 2003: 772; Eaton, 2006; Schulenberg et al., 2010: 628; and Fraga, 2011: 797.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 789778, adult male, collected at 15 km north-northeast of Tingo María, 4 km north of the Tulumayo River, and ca. 2 km northwest of Pumahuasi, ca. 2150 ft, ca. 09.04S, 75.40W (Stephens and Traylor, 1983), Huánuco, Peru, on 17 August 1968, by Lester L. Short (no. 2999).\n\nComments:\n\nThe AMNH number of the holotype was cited in the original description. The type series comprised two specimens; the second specimen, the paratype, is AMNH 789779, female, collected on the same day at the type locality. In the original description, Short designated this bird an allotype of xanthophthalmus. According to the Code (ICZN, 1999: 75), “The term ‘allotype’ may be used to indicate a specimen of opposite sex to the holotype; an ‘allotype’ has no name-bearing function.”\n\nIn addition to Agelaius, this species has been included in the genera Chrysomus (Dickinson, 2003: 772) and Agelasticus (Fraga, 2011: 797).\n\nAgelaius icterocephalus bogotensis Chapman\n\nAgelaius icterocephalus bogotensis Chapman, 1914: 191 (Suba Marshes, Bogotá Savanna, Colombia).\n\nNow Chrysomus icterocephalus bogotensis (Chapman, 1914). See Hellmayr, 1937: 179; Blake, 1968: 173; Johnson and Lanyon, 1999; Dickinson, 2003: 772; Cadena et al, 2011: 540–545; and Fraga, 2011: 798.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 123126, adult female, collected in the Saba Marshes, 8750 ft, 04.45N, 74.05W (Paynter, 1997), Bogotá Savanna, Colombia, on 21 February 1913, by Frank M. Chapman.\n\nComments:\n\nChapman cited the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and noted that he had a series of seven males and nine females. The 15 paratypes are: Bogotá Savanna, AMNH 123124, 123125, 123127, 123128, two males, two females, collected in February 1913, by Chapman et al.; La Holando, AMNH 126891–126897, four males, three females, collected in May 1913 by M. Gonzalez; Puente Andalucia, AMNH 126898, female, AMNH 126899, male in female plumage, AMNH 126900, male, collected in April 1913, by M. Gonzalez; La Herrera, AMNH 126901, female, collected in May 1913,by M. Gonzalez. Of these, the following were exchanged: AMNH 126892, male, to O. Bangs in 1918, now in MCZ; AMNH 126894, male, to USNM; AMNH 126895, female, AMNH 126900, male, to BMNH in 1921. I did not find AMNH 126896 in the collection and it was perhaps exchanged without the catalog having been marked.\n\nIcterus atro-olivaceus Wied\n\nIcterus atro-olivaceus Wied, 1831: 1216 (an der Ostküste von Brasilien, in der Gegend von Coral de Batuba, bei der Lagoa Feia).\n\nNow Agelasticus cyanopus atroolivaceus (Wied, 1831). See Allen, 1889c: 226; Hellmayr, 1937: 180; Parkes, 1966: 1–12; Blake, 1968: 174; Dickinson, 2003: 772; and Fraga, 2011: 797–798.\n\nSyntype:\n\nAMNH 4731, female, Curral Ubatuba ( = Coral de Batuba), near Lagõa Feia, ca. 22.10S, 41.20W (Paynter and Traylor, 1991), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. From the Maximilian Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Wied (p. 1218) noted that he had not seen a male and that his hunters had shot two females upon which he based his description.\n\nAllen's listing of this specimen as Wied's type of atro-olivaceus was questioned by Hellmayr (1937: 180), who thought that Wied's description did not fit well with A. cyanopus and that the collecting locality was far removed from the range of the species. Parkes (1966: 1–12) made a detailed study of A. cyanopus, including a study of the type of atroolivaceus at AMNH. He was able to compare this type to other specimens of cyanopus from Rio de Janeiro sent him on loan by Helmut Sick and commented: “Comparison of this series with Wied's type makes it clear that all of these birds belong to an isolated population of Agelaius cyanopus, whose distinctive characters account for the discrepancies noted by Hellmayr” (Parkes, 1966: 6). Parkes also noted Hellmayr's inadvertant listing of the name as atro-violaceus, a misspelling that has been repeated in a number of subsequent publications. Currently it is accepted as a valid subspecies, atroolivaceus, in the species cyanopus, but included by some authors in the genus Chrysomus (e.g., Dickinson, 2003: 772), and by others in the genus Agelasticus (e.g., Fraga, 2011: 797–798).\n\nBokerman (1957: 215) gave 20 September 1815 as the date of Wied's visit to Curral Ubatuba.\n\nSturnella magna saundersi Dickerman and Phillips\n\nSturnella magna saundersi Dickerman and Phillips, 1970: 308 (9 km S of Niltepec, Oaxaca, at an elevation of 5–25 m).\n\nNow Sturnella magna saundersi Dickerman and Phillips, 1970. See Dickerman and Parkes, 1997: 231; Dickinson, 2003: 775; and Fraga, 2011: 806–807.\n\nSyntypes in AMNH:\n\nAMNH 801592 (RWD no. 13260), adult male, AMNH 801595 (RWD no. 13258), immature male, collected 9 km S. Niltepec, 16.33N, 94.35W (Times atlas), Oaxaca, Mexico, on 15 January 1966, by R.W. Dickerman.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Dickerman and Phillips designated 11 syntypes of saundersi, based on their field numbers. Three of the syntypes collected by Dickerman originally came to AMNH. The third syntype, AMNH 801593 (RWD no. 13262), was sent to USNM in November 1973. AMNH 801595 was thought to be uncataloged as the number had not been written on the label, so it was recataloged with the number AMNH 810401. The earlier number is the correct one.\n\nDickerman and Parkes (1997: 231) listed AMNH 801594 as a syntype of saundersi, but this is incorrect. That specimen bears RWD no. 13263, which was not given for any of the syntypes.\n\nBecause syntypes were specifically designated, other specimens have no nomenclatural standing.\n\nSturnella magna quinta Dickerman\n\nSturnella magna quinta Dickerman, 1989: 161 (Frechal, Rio Surumu, Amapa, Brazil).\n\nNow Sturnella magna quinta Dickerman, 1989. See Joseph, 2001: 69–71; Dickinson, 2003: 775; and Fraga, 2011: 806–807.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 237404, adult male, collected at Flexal ( = Frechal), 03.50N, 60.32W (Paynter and Traylor, 1991), Rio Surumu, Roraima (not Amapa), northeastern Brazil, on 10 September 1927, by T. Donald Carter (no. 268, not 208) on the Lee Garnett Day Expedition.\n\nComments:\n\nDickerman cited the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and listed (on p. 162) 20 paratypes from Surinam and 14 from Amapá, Brazil. Paratypes in AMNH are: Surinam, Zanderij, AMNH 348596–348603, 388079–388089, eight males, nine females, two juveniles, by Haverschmidt in 1948–1949; in the interior, AMNH 521462, female, 1 November 1905, by H.R. Putscher. Brazil, state of Roraima, Flexal, AMNH 237400–237403, 237405, 237406, four males, two females, 4–15 September 1927, on the Day Expedition; Limão (not Lima), Rio Cotinga, AMNH 237407–237410, two males, two females, 30 September–1 October 1927, on the Day Expedition. I did not find specimens from Porto Platon in AMNH.\n\nJoseph (2001: 69–71) discussed the type locality of “Frechal” and showed that it must be the locality “Flexal” in Roraima given by Paynter and Traylor (1991). Paynter and Traylor (1991) did not locate a Flexal in Amapá, but subsequent to their publication, Vanzolini (1992) gave the coordinates for such a place as 00.05N, 52.11W, certainly not in the vicinity of the Rio Surumu.\n\nTate (1930) provided a map of the Lee Garnett Day Expedition, showing it approaching Mount Roraima from the south, through the state of Roraima in Brazil. As Joseph (2001: 70) commented, “Frechal” and Limão are close together in the Savannas south of Mount Roraima. Chapman (1931: 133–134) assigned the same 11 specimens to S. m. monticola Chubb, 1921, type locality Mount Roraima. Hellmayr (1937: 218–219), while he saw no differences between monticola and praticola, reluctantly recognized monticola, but Blake (1968: 180) considered it a synonym of praticola. Haverschmidt and Mees (1994: 537) assigned Surinam birds to the subspecies praticola, where it is said to occur in Surinam only in the area around the Zanderij airport (ca. 05.26N, 55.08W, Stephens and Traylor, 1985). Because of the error regarding the type locality, the subspecies quinta should be reexamined.\n\nCassidix mexicanus loweryi Dickerman and Phillips\n\nCassidix mexicanus loweryi Dickerman and Phillips, 1966: 129 (Chicxulub Puerto, Yucatán).\n\nNow Quiscalus mexicanus loweryi (Dickerman and Phillips, 1966). See Blake, 1968: 189; Dickerman and Parkes, 1997: 230; Dickinson, 2003: 775; and Fraga, 2011: 780.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 803125, adult female, collected at Chicxulub Puerto, Yucatán, Mexico, on 25 January 1965, by Robert W. Dickerman (no. 12595). From Cornell University (no. CU 30456).\n\nComments:\n\nBoth the Cornell University number and the Dickerman field number of the holotype were given in the original description, and 10 paratypes were listed from the vicinity of Progreso, Yucatán. None of the paratypes is in AMNH.\n\nQuiscalus quiscula stonei Chapman\n\nQuiscalus quiscula stonei Chapman, 1935: 25 (Lakehurst, New Jersey).\n\nNow Quiscalus quiscula stonei Chapman, 1935. See Blake, 1968: 191; Dickinson, 2003: 775; and Fraga, 2011: 778.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 99687, adult male, collected at Lakehurst, 40.01N, 74.19W (Times atlas), New Jersey, on 8 June 1907, by W. DeW. Miller and James P. Chapin.\n\nComments:\n\nChapman gave the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description. This form was based on intergrade individuals that have a breeding range from southern Louisiana to southern New York in the area between the breeding ranges of Q. quiscula quiscula and Q, quiscula ridgwayi. As the specimens were not labeled by Chapman and the area involved is not well-defined, I have not been able to decide which other specimens Chapman considered part of his type series.\n\nQuiscalus fortirostris Lawrence\n\nQuiscalus fortirostris Lawrence, 1868: 360 (Barbadoes).\n\nNow Quiscalus lugubris fortirostris Lawrence, 1868. See Hellmayr, 1937: 87; Blake, 1968: 193; Dickinson, 2003: 774; and Fraga, 2011: 779.\n\nSyntypes:\n\nAMNH 42098, female, AMNH 42099, male, collected on Barbados ( = Barbadoes) Island, West Indies, undated, by A.H. Alexander. From the George N. Lawrence Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nLawrence described both male and female in the original description and said that the types were in his collection. Both of these specimens are marked “Type” by Lawrence, and they are the only two specimens of this form in AMNH from the Lawrence Collection. A.H. Alexander was a New York taxidermist (Wynne, 1969: 4) from whom Lawrence received specimens on occasion.\n\nMolothrus (Lampropsar) Cabanisii Cassin\n\nMolothrus (Lampropsar) Cabanisii Cassin, 1866: 22 (Guiana and Santa Martha, New Grenada).\n\nNow Molothrus bonariensis cabanisii Cassin, 1866. See Stone, 1891: 346; Stone, 1899: 34; Chapman, 1917: 361; Hellmayr, 1937: 65–66; Blake, 1968: 197; Dickinson, 2003: 773; and Fraga, 2011: 786–787.\n\nSyntype:\n\nAMNH 42067, unsexed, collected in Santa Marta, Colombia ( = New Grenada), undated, by “J.A.” From the George N. Lawrence Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Cassin said that he had one specimen from “Guiana” in PNAS, and a second specimen from “Santa Martha, New Grenada” in the Lawrence Collection along with others in PNAS without locality data. Chapman (1917: 631) listed as type the Santa Marta specimen in AMNH labeled “Lampropsar cabanisii” by Cassin. AMNH 42067 is so labeled and is marked “Type” by Lawrence. Stone (1891: 346) in his revision of species allied to M. bonairensis, listed the range of cabanisii as Colombia and Venezuela, with birds from Guiana included in atronitens ( = minimus) and later (Stone, 1899: 34) listed the type of cabanisii as PNAS no. 3651 from the Rivoli Collection but without a locality. Hellmayr (1937: 65) noted that the locality “Guiana” was an error. Cassin's type is not listed by Meyer de Schauensee (1957: 239).\n\nMolothrus bonairensis aequatorialis Chapman\n\nMolothrus bonairensis aequatorialis Chapman, 1915: 661 (Barbacoas, Narino, southwestern Colombia).\n\nNow Molothrus bonairensis aequatorialis Chapman, 1915. See Hellmayr, 1937: 66; Blake, 1968: 197; Dickinson, 2003: 773; and Fraga, 2011: 786–787.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 118355, adult female, collected at Barbacoas, 01.41N, 78.09W (Paynter, 1997), Nariño, southwestern Colombia, on 5 August 1912, by William B. Richardson.\n\nComments:\n\nChapman cited the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and listed measurements for six males and four females in addition to the holotype. In addition to the birds Chapman measured, there are four specimens that would have been available to him but were either missexed or immature. These 14 specimens, all collected by William B. Richardson, are considered paratypes of aequatorialis: Barbacoas, AMNH 118356, immature sex?, 5 October 1912; Tumaco, AMNH 118357–118359, one male, one female?, one immature male, 28–30 July 1912; Esmeraldas, AMNH 119049–119054, three males, three females, 5 November to 1 December 1912; Manavi, AMNH 120246, male, 16 December 1912, AMNH 120247, male, 14 February 1913, AMNH 125225, “female” in male plumage, 7 March 1913; Daule, AMNH 125224, female, 28 April 1913. Of these AMNH 119053, female from Esmeraldas, was exchanged to ANSP in July 1928. Two additional specimens, AMNH 155194 and 155195, females, were collected by Richardson at Esmeraldas on 26 October and 4 December 1912, but these two specimens were not cataloged until August 1920, after aequatorialis was described, and they are not paratypes; one of these, AMNH 155194, was exchanged to MCZ in July 1928.\n\nSee Chapman (1917b: 49–50) for an account of Richardson's expedition.\n\nMolothrus occidentalis Berlepsch and Stolzmann\n\nMolothrus occidentalis Berlepsch and Stolzmann, 1892: 378 (Peru occ. (Lima etc.)).\n\nNow Molothrus bonariensis occidentalis Berlepsch and Stolzmann, 1892. See Hartert, 1919a: 137; 1928: 192–193; Hellmayr, 1937: 66–67; Blake, 1968: 197; Dickinson, 2003: 773; and Fraga, 2011: 786–787.\n\nSyntypes:\n\nAMNH 521045, male, collected at Lima, 12.03S, 77.03W (Stephens and Traylor, 1983), Peru, on 10 November 1889, by J. Kalinowski (no. 258); AMNH 521046, female, collected at Lima, Peru, on 18 October 1889, by J. Kalinowski (no. 179); AMNH 521047, female, collected at Lima, Peru, on 6 October 1889, by J. Kalinowski (no. 140). From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nNo type was designated in the original description, Berlepsch and Stolzmann describing male and female and noting only that Kalinowski had collected “nombreux exemplaires; octobre et novembre 1889, janvier 1890.” Hartert (1919a: 137) at first listed only the adult male specimen as a cotype ( = syntype), giving its Kalinowski no. 258, and it is marked “Typus” on the original label. This specimen came to AMNH bearing a Rothschild type label and was cataloged at that time as the type. Hartert (1928: 192–193) later added the female collected on 18 October as a syntype, but it bears no Rothschild type label; it is also marked “Typus” on the original label. AMNH 521047 was not listed by Hartert and is not marked “Typus,” but is part of the same series and should also be considered a syntype. AMNH type labels have been added to the two additional syntypes. There are four more syntypes in MIZ (Mlíkovský, 2009: 128).\n\nMolothrus minimus Dalmas\n\nMolothrus minimus Dalmas, 1900: 138 (Ile de Tobago).\n\nNow Molothrus bonariensis minimus Dalmas, 1900. See Hellmayr, 1937: 57–59; Blake, 1968: 197–198; Dickinson, 2003: 773; and Fraga, 2011: 786–787.\n\nSyntype:\n\nAMNH 521003, adult male, collected on Tobago Island, Trinidad and Tobago, in 1898, by Comte de Dalmas. From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nDalmas, in the original description, did not say how many specimens he had but described the male, female, and young. Rothschild bought part of the Dalmas Collection, other parts going to Munich and Paris (Hartert, 1919a: 151; Hellmayr, 1931: 163; Phelps, 1945: 333). Specimens that Rothschild purchased bear labels printed “E Museo Dalmas,” as this syntype does. Other syntypes, if extant, may be in one of the other collections. The original tag on this specimen is stamped Tobago 1898, and on the reverse is written: “Molothrus n. sp., ♂.” Dalmas (1900: 132) noted that he was on Tobago in the months of November and December 1898. A separate small tag bears the number “110.1.13” of unknown significance. A wing measurement of the male was given by Dalmas as “112 [mm],” but I measure it as 102 mm, indicating a misprint in Dalmas' account. Six additional males from Tobago in AMNH had wing measurements of 98–101 mm.\n\nIcterus violaceus Wied\n\nIcterus violaceus Wied, 1831: 1212 (Rio Parahyba and Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro).\n\nNow Molothrus bonariensis bonariensis (Gmelin, 1789). See Allen, 1889c: 226; and Hellmayr, 1937: 59–64.\n\nSyntypes:\n\nAMNH 6771, female, AMNH 6772, male, and AMNH 4719, male, collected in “Brasilia” by Maximilian, Prince of Wied. From the Maximilian Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nAllen (1889c: 226) listed two Wied names under Molothrus bonariensis: Oriolus violaceus Wied (1820: 53) and Icterus violaceus Wied (1831: 1212). The earlier name appears in Wied's text but is a nomen nudum there. It is not mentioned by Hellmayr (1937: 59–64).\n\nAs syntypes of Icterus violaceus Wied, Allen (1889c: 226) listed only AMNH 6771 and 6772 (incorrectly given as 6671 and 6672). The original Wied label that is glued to the back of the AMNH label on AMNH 6772 was marked “Icterus violaceus mihi” in Wied's hand and had applied to two specimens, a male and female. The female is AMNH 6771, and it was labeled “female” by Allen. The two specimens had probably been tied together originally.\n\nThere is a third syntype in AMNH, a Wied specimen of violaceus in male plumage that was on exhibit and perhaps because of this was overlooked by Allen. It is AMNH 4719, male, also with an original Wied label bearing the name “Icterus violaceus mihi” in Wied's hand and applying to two specimens, a male and a male juvenile. I did not find the male juvenile in the collection although there is an entry in the AMNH catalog at number 4721 of a “male juv?” without other data.\n\nMolothrus bonariensis milleri Naumburg and Friedmann\n\nMolothrus bonariensis milleri Naumburg and Friedmann, 1927: 494 (Urucum, near Corumbá, Matto Grosso, Brazil).\n\nNow Molothrus bonariensis bonariensis (Gmelin, 1789). See Naumburg, 1930: 394; Hellmayr, 1937: 59–64; Blake, 1968: 198; Dickinson, 2003: 773; and Fraga, 2011: 786–787.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 128345, female, collected at Urucum, 19.09S, 57.38W (Paynter and Traylor, 1991), near Corumbá, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, on 12 December 1913, by George K. Cherrie (no. 17389) on the Roosevelt Rondon Expedition.\n\nComments:\n\nNaumburg and Friedmann cited the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description, giving measurements of four adult males, three adult females and describing the juvenile plumage of the male and the female. They had specimens from Corumbá, Descalvados, and Cuyabá. Paratypes are: Urucum near Corumbá, AMNH 128339–128344, 128346, four males, one immature male, two females; Cuyabá, AMNH 128347, immature male, all collected by Cherrie in November and December 1913 on the Roosevelt Rondon Expedition; Descalvados, AMNH 149800, female, collected on 27 December 1916, collected by Cherry on a later expedition supplemental to the Roosevelt Rondon Expedition.\n\nSyntype:\n\nAMNH 456744, juvenile male, collected in Vienna ( = Wien), 48.13N, 16.22E (Times atlas), Austria, on 8 August 1824. From the Brehm Collection via the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nS. orientalis Brehm was not among the Brehm types listed by Hartert (1918) and was only discovered in the general collection at AMNH after enquiries by E. Dickinson in 2008. In the original description Brehm described male, female, and young. The above specimen bears the original Brehm label, marked “Serinus flavescens orientalis, ♂ juv. 8. August 1824 Wien.” A juvenile female, collected on the same day in “Wien” is labeled meridionalis by Brehm (see below). Because of the conflicting evidence, I have not considered it a syntype of either name. Other specimens labeled orientalis by Brehm were collected after the publication of the name.\n\nKinzelbach et al. (2009) found that Serinus estherae orientalis Chasen was preoccupied by Serinus orientalis C.L. Brehm, 1831, and provided a replacement name for that of Chasen.\n\nSerinus meridionalis C.L. Brehm\n\nSerinus meridionalis C.L. Brehm, 1831: 255 (in Tyrol und der Schweiz).\n\nNow Serinus serinus (Linnaeus, 1766). See Hartert, 1903: 83; Vaurie, 1959: 599; Howell et al., 1968: 210; Dickinson, 2003: 746; and Clement, 2010: 516–517.\n\nSyntypes:\n\nAMNH 456733, adult male, AMNH 456734, adult female, both collected on 15 July 1820, in Tyrol. From the Brehm Collection via the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nS. meridionalis Brehm was not among the Brehm types listed by Hartert (1918). Three specimens labeled meridionalis by Brehm were discovered in the AMNH general collection when looking for the syntype of S. orientalis (above). The adult male and female were tied together and are labeled as from Tyrol, given as a locality for this form by Brehm. They are considered syntypes of meridionalis. The third specimen, AMNH 456745, juvenile female, 8 August 1824, Wien, while labeled meridionalis is from a locality given for orientalis. It was also collected on the same day as a juvenile male of orientalis (see above). I have not considered it a syntype of either name.\n\nSpinus citrinelloides kikuyensis Neumann\n\nSpinus citrinelloides kikuyensis Neumann, 1905: 356 (Kikuyu).\n\nNow Serinus citrinelloides kikuyensis (Neumann, 1905). See Hartert, 1919a: 156; Howell et al., 1968: 212; Fry and Keith, 2004: 460–462; and Clement, 2010: 521.\n\nLectotype:\n\nAMNH 710620, adult male, collected in the Kikuyu Mountains, Kenya, undated, by William Doherty. From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Neumann said that the type was an adult male in the Rothschild Collection, collected by Doherty at Kikuyu, and added that he had six such specimens. There are, in addition to the type, six adult male specimens in AMNH from the Rothschild Collection, collected by Doherty in the Kikuyu Mountains. Neumann's designation of the type did not serve to distinguish it from one additional undated Doherty specimen, nor did Hartert (1919a: 156) further distinguish the type. Neumann has written his new name and “Typus” on AMNH 710620, and that is the specimen that bears the Rothschild type label and was cataloged as the type when the Rothschild Collection came to AMNH. In order to remove the ambiguity from Neumann's intended type, I hereby designate AMNH 710620 the lectotype of Spinus citrinelloides kikuyensis. Neumann, in the original description also compared females and immature males from the Kikuyu Mountains, of which there are four, with specimens of S. c. citrinelloides. I consider all of Doherty's specimens from the Kikuyu Mountains in addition to the lectotype to be paralectotypes: AMNH 710613, male, October 1900; AMNH 710614, immature male, November 1900; AMNH 710615, immature male, November 1900; AMNH 710616, male, December 1900; AMNH 710617, male, January 1901; AMNH 710618, male, January 1901; AMNH 710619, male, March 1901; AMNH 710621, male, undated; AMNH 710622, female, November 1900; AMNH 710623, female, March 1901.\n\nNeumann also included in kikuyensis an example from Naiwascha-See collected by Fischer in ZMB and Kenyan examples collected by Lord Delamere.\n\nThis subspecific name is frequently misspelled as kikuyuensis (e.g., Fry and Keith, 2004: 461), but it was spelled kikuyensis in the original description. Hartert (1902g: 620) provided information on this collecting locality.\n\nSerinus leucopygius riggenbachi Neumann\n\nSerinus leucopygius riggenbachi Neumann, 1908a: 44 (Thiés near Dakar).\n\nNow Serinus leucopygius riggenbachi Neumann, 1908. See Hartert, 1919a: 160; Vaurie, 1956a: 5–6; Howell et al., 1968: 215; Fry and Keith, 2004: 470–471; and Clement, 2010: 522–523.\n\nLectotype:\n\nAMNH 713382, adult male, collected at Thiés, 14.49N, 16.52W (Times atlas), Senegal, on 24 May 1907, by F.W. Riggenbach (no. 519). From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Neumann said that the male type, in the Rothschild Collection, was collected on 24 May 1907 at Thiés, but there are two Riggenbach specimens collected on that date, therefore the type designation is ambivalent. Hartert (1919a: 160) listed this type, giving Riggenbach's unique field number of 519, thus designating the specimen that is now AMNH 713382 the lectotype. The following specimens are paralectotypes: Senegal, Thiés, AMNH 713383 (Riggenbach no. 515), AMNH 713384 (518), 713385 (514), males; AMNH 713386 (516), 713387 (517), 713388 (513), 713389 (521), females, collected in May and June 1907; Gassam, AMNH 713390 (1292), 713391 (1264), 713392 (1253), males; AMNH 713393 (1243), female, collected in August and September 1907; Onomim, AMNH 713394 (872), male, collected in September 1907. There are two additional undated Rothschild specimens from Gambia that are probable paralectotypes: AMNH 713395, ex Bartlett Collection; AMNH 713396, ex Boucard Collection.\n\nSerinus leucopygius pallens Vaurie\n\nSerinus leucopygius pallens Vaurie, 1956a: 6 (Azzal, north of Agadés, Aïr Massif).\n\nNow Serinus leucopygius pallens Vaurie, 1956. See Hartert, 1921: 135; Howell et al., 1968: 215; Dickinson, 2003: 746–747; Fry and Keith, 2004: 470–471; and Clement, 2010: 522–523.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 713404, adult female, Azzal, north of Agadéz ( = Agadés), 17.00N, 07.56E (Times atlas), Aïr Massif, Niger, on 14 July 1920, by A. Buchanan. From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nVaurie gave the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and (on pp. 5–6) listed the 10 specimens of the new subspecies that he examined. These were the same Buchanan specimens listed by Hartert (1921: 135). The nine paratypes of pallens are: Tatukut, Damergou, AMNH 713397–713399, three males, 22–24 March 1920; Zinder, AMNH 713400–713402, two males, one female?, 30 June 1920; Azzal, AMNH 713403, female, 14 July 1920; Kano, AMNH 713405, male juvenile, 5 December 1919; Farniso, near Kano, AMNH 713406, male juvenile, 23 December 1919.\n\nThe subspecies pallens has been recognized by most recent authors, but Fry and Keith (2004: 470) include it in riggenbachi without explanation.\n\nSerinus flavigula Salvadori\n\nSerinus flavigula Salvadori, 1888: 272 (Malca-ghebdu).\n\nNow Serinus flavigula Salvadori, 1888. See Rand, 1968: 116–119; Erard, 1974; Dickinson, 2003: 747; Fry and Keith, 2004: 484–485; Ash and Atkins, 2009: 365; and Clement, 2010: 524–525.\n\nSyntype:\n\nAMNH 713268, unsexed, collected at Melka Ghebdu ( = Malca-Ghebdu), 09.31N, 39.56E (Ash and Atkins, 2009: 417), Shewa ( = Shoa), Ethiopia, on 19 February 1885 (not 1886), by Vincenzo Ragazzi (no. 512). From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nThis specimen was listed by Salvadori (1888: 272) as one of his three specimens of S. flavigula, although he misread the date as 1886. It bears the original label with the number 512 on it. On the reverse of this label, Salvadori has written: “Serinus flavigula Salvad., nov. sp. ?” (with the ? marked out) “Typical specimen,” “b,” and “7.a.” The “b” refers to the letter opposite this specimen in the original description. I do not know the significance of the “7a.”\n\nThis type was not mentioned by Hartert in any of his Rothschild type lists and was apparently first referred to as in AMNH by Erard (1974: 308), after which it was found in the collection by Carlo Violani and added to the AMNH types. Rand (1968) considered S. flavigula to be “yellow-throated aberrant specimens or mutants” of S. atrogularis xanthopygius. Erard (1974: 320–322) thought it was best considered a full species as Irwin (1961: 138–139) had suggested. Subsequent authors have followed them for this very rare species.\n\nSerinus angolensis somereni Hartert\n\nSerinus angolensis somereni Hartert, 1912: 63 (Toro, Uganda).\n\nNow Serinus atrogularis somereni Hartert, 1912. See Hartert, 1919a: 160, Howell, et al., 1968: 216; Dickinson, 2003: 747; Fry and Keith, 2004: 471–473; and Clement, 2010: 523.\n\nSyntypes:\n\nAMNH 713306, AMNH 713307, male and female, collected at Bwezu, Toro, Uganda, in November 1910, by R.A.L. van Someren (nos 69 and 70 B.G.). From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Hartert designated as types the male and female bearing the numbers 69 and 70 B.G. Because syntypes were designated, other specimens mentioned by Hartert have no nomenclautral standing. Apparently only one label originally served for both birds; this label was copied and the copy tied on the other specimen. Only specimen AMNH 713306 bore a Rothschild type label, which had been marked “syntypes of Serinus angolensis somereni” by Hartert, and he (Hartert, 1919a: 160) listed both as types. A type label has been added to the second specimen and it is now included in the type collection.\n\nSerinus pseudobarbatus van Someren\n\nSerinus pseudobarbatus van Someren, 1919: 56 (Fort Ternan, Kavirondo).\n\nNow Serinus mozambicus barbatus (Heuglin, 1864). See van Someren, 1922: 172; Hartert, 1928: 199; Howell, et al., 1968: 218; Fry and Keith, 2004: 479–482; and Clement, 2010: 527–528.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 713851, adult male, collected at Fort Ternan, 00.12S, 35.205E (Polhill, 1988), Kavirondo, Kenya, on 24 August 1918. From the V.G.L. van Someren Collection via the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, van Someren said that the type, bearing the above data, was in the Rothschild Collection; he gave inclusive measurements but did not enumerate his specimens. Van Someren (1922: 172) gave eight measurements, mentioned young specimens, and listed the following localities: Kisumu, Fort Ternan, Kibigori, and Kibingei. Only one of the paratypes came to AMNH with the Rothschild Collection: AMNH 713852, female, collected at Fort Ternan on 24 August 1918, from van Someren.\n\nThe type locality is Fort Ternan, not Fort Fernan, misread by Hartert (1928: 199) from the original label.\n\nSerinus buchanani Hartert\n\nSerinus buchanani Hartert, 1919b: 50 (Maktan, British East Africa).\n\nNow Serinus buchanani Hartert, 1919. See Hartert, 1928: 199; Howell, et al., 1968: 221; Zimmerman et al., 1999: 562; Dickinson, 2003: 747; Fry and Keith, 2004: 488–489; and Clement, 2010: 528.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 713518, adult male, collected at Maktau (not Maktan), 03.25S, 38.07E (Polhill, 1988), Teita, Kenya, on 18 September 1915, by Angus Buchanan (no. 1). From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Hartert gave Buchanan's field number of the holotype and noted that he had one male, one female, and a nest with eggs. The paratype in AMNH is: AMNH 713519, female, collected at Maktau on 19 October 1915 by A. Buchanan (no. 26). The nest and eggs did not come to AMNH.\n\nThis form had been treated as a subspecies of S. donaldsoni, but Zimmerman et al. (1999: 562) treated it as a full species, and subsequent authors have agreed.\n\nSerinus maculicollis taruensis van Someren\n\nSerinus maculicollis taruensis van Someren, 1921a: 114 (M'buyuni).\n\nNow Serinus dorsostriatus maculicollis Sharpe, 1895. See Hartert, 1928: 199; Howell et al., 1968: 221; Dickinson, 2003: 747; Fry and Keith, 2004: 483–484; and Clement, 2010: 529.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 713666, adult male, collected at M'buyuni, 03.14S, 38.30E (Polhill, 1988), Kenya, 27 June 1918. From the V.G.L. van Someren Collection via the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, van Someren said that his type was a male collected on 17 June 1918 at M'buyuni and that he had five male and three female specimens. Four specimens of taruensis came to AMNH in addition to the type. The following two specimens are paratypes: AMNH 713667, female, M'buyuni, 3 July 1918, and AMNH 713669, male, Manugu, 8 August 1918. AMNH 713668, male, 2 July 1918 from Masongaleni is a probable paratype but this locality was not mentioned, and AMNH 713670, unsexed, Manugu, 3 August 1918, is also a probable paratype, but unsexed specimens were not mentioned in the description.\n\nOf recent authors, only Clement (2010: 529) recognized taruensis.\n\nSerinus (? flaviventris) loveridgei van Someren\n\nSerinus (? flaviventris) loveridgei van Someren, 1921a: 114 (Lumbo, North Mozambique).\n\nNow Serinus sulphuratus sharpii Neumann, 1900. See Hartert, 1928: 199; Howell et al., 1968: 223; Dickinson, 2003: 747; Fry and Keith, 2004: 489–491; and Clement, 2010: 529–530.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 713613, adult male, collected at Lumbo, 15.00S, 40.40E (Times atlas), Mozambique, on 10 July 1918, by Arthur Loveridge. From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, van Someren designated as the holotype a male in the Rothschild Collection collected at Lumbo on 10 July 1918 by Loveridge. He apparently had two males, but the second male, a paratype, did not come to AMNH.\n\nHowell et al. (1968: 223) recognized S. sulphuratus shelleyi, with loveridgei a synonym. More recent authors have synonymized shelleyi and loveridgei with S. s. sharpii (not sharpei).\n\nLoveridge (1922: 837) listed his localities for collections made during the years 1915–1919 and noted that new forms had been named by van Someren.\n\nPoliospiza striolata ugandae van Someren\n\nPoliospiza striolata ugandae van Someren, 1921a: 114 (Mt. Elgon).\n\nNow Serinus striolatus striolatus (Rüppell, 1840). See van Someren, 1922: 168; Hartert, 1928: 199; Howell et al., 1968: 227; Dickinson, 2003: 748; Fry and Keith, 2004: 495–497; and Clement, 2010: 535.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 714161, female, collected on Mount Elgon, ca, 01.08N, 34.33E (Polhill, 1988), Uganda, on 18 July 1916. From the V.G.L. van Someren Collection via the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, van Someren noted that his type, in the Rothschild Collection, was a female, collected on Mount Elgon on 18 July 1916, and said that he had seven males and three females from Mount Elgon and South Ankole and that “Specimens from the Kivu districts appear to be indistinguishable from ugandae.” Paratypes in AMNH are: AMNH 714163, male, AMNH 714164, female, and AMNH 714165, male, collected in July 1907 by collectors for van Someren. AMNH 714167–714181, seven males, eight females, collected in the Kivu district, in August and November/December 1907 by Grauer would have been seen by van Someren in the Rothschild Collection and are also paratypes of ugandae.\n\nHowell et al. (1968: 227) recognized S. striolatus affinis and considered ugandae a synonym of it. Recent authors have considered affinis a synonym of nominate striolatus.\n\nSerinus striolatus graueri Hartert\n\nSerinus striolatus graueri Hartert, 1907: 84 (Ruwenzori, 7000 feet).\n\nNow Serinus striolatus graueri Hartert, 1907. See Hartert, 1919a: 159; Howell et al., 1968: 227; Dickinson, 2003: 748; Fry and Keith, 2004: 495–497; and Clement, 2010: 535.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 714162, adult female, collected in the Ruwenzori Mountains, 7000 ft, ca. 00.05–00.50N, 29.45–30.25E (Polhill, 1988), Uganda-Congo (Kinshasa) border, undated, by Rudolf Grauer (no. 3571). From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nHartert cited Grauer's no. 3571 in the original description, and noted that Grauer collected two specimens. The paratype is: AMNH 714166, male, from the Ruwenzori Mountains, 7000 ft, undated, by Grauer. The number “3571” appears to have been added by Hartert, the paratype has no Grauer number.\n\nLinurgus elgonensis van Someren\n\nLinurgus elgonensis van Someren, 1918b: 283 (forests on Elgon).\n\nNow Linurgus olivaceus elgonensis van Someren, 1918. See Hartert, 1928: 199; Howell et al., 1968: 282; Fry and Keith, 2004: 531–533; Arnaiz-Villena and Moscoso, 2007: 826–834; and Clement, 2010: 541.\n\nLectotype:\n\nAMNH 714358, adult male, collected on Mount Elgon, ca. 01.08N, 34.33E (Polhill, 1988), Kenya/Uganda border, on 16 November 1916. From the V.G.L. van Someren Collection via the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, van Someren did not designate a type but noted that he had three male and two female specimens. Van Someren (1922: 156) later mentioned that the type was in the Rothschild Collection without giving further information; by that time he had acquired an additional male, but only the three cited in the original description were part of his type series. Hartert (1928: 199) listed the male collected on 16 November 1916 as the type, thereby designating it the lectotype. This specimen, now AMNH 714358, is marked on the original label “TYPE Linurus elgonensis vS” and bears a Rothschild type label. No paralectotypes of elgonensis came to AMNH.\n\nChloris curvirostris C.L. Brehm\n\nChloris curvirostris C.L. Brehm, 1855: 95 (in Schweden und Deutschland).\n\nNow Carduelis chloris chloris (Linnaeus, 1758). See Hartert, 1903: 61; Hartert, 1918: 10; Howell et al., 1968: 235; Dickinson, 2003: 749; and Clement, 2010: 542–543.\n\nLectotype:\n\nAMNH 456671, female, collected in Stockholm, 59.20N, 18.95E (Times atlas), Sweden, on 30 April 1849. From the Brehm Collection via the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nHartert (1918: 10) listed the Brehm specimen collected in Stockholm on 30 April 1849 as the type, thereby designating it the lectotype of C. curvirostris. He also listed a pair and a nestling from Renthendorf as labeled curvirostris by Brehm. These three specimens were perhaps AMNH 456668, male, 20 June 1817, AMNH 456669, male, AMNH 456670, female, 4 September 1837, cataloged as curvirostris but exchanged to ZFMK. They may be paralectotypes of curvirostris. Hartert (1918: 10) listed W. Meves as the collector of this lectotype.\n\nHartert (1903: 61) restricted the type locality of Carduelis chloris to Sweden and listed C. curvirostris Brehm as a synonym, as have subsequent authors.\n\nChloris septentrionalis C.L. Brehm\n\nChloris septentrionalis C.L. Brehm, 1831: 261 (Er bewohnt schon Nord-deutschland, z.B. die Gegend bei Kiel geht aber warscheinlich viel höher nördlich hinauf, lebt vom November bis zum April in Mitteldeutschland).\n\nNow Carduelis chloris chloris (Linnaeus, 1758). See Hartert, 1903: 61; Hartert, 1918: 10; Dickinson, 2003: 749; and Clement, 2010: 542–543.\n\nLectotype:\n\nAMNH 456673, adult male, collected at Kiel, 54.20N, 10.08E (Times atlas), Germany, in 1824. From the Brehm Collection via the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nHartert (1918: 10) listed the Brehm specimen collected in Kiel in 1824 as the type of septentrionalis, thereby designating it the lectotype and said that the specimen was the only one in the Brehm collection from Kiel and was probably collected by Boie. Other Brehm specimens in AMNH labeled septentrionalis by him were collected after 1831.\n\nChloris chloris smithae Koelz\n\nChloris chloris smithae Koelz, 1939: 74 (Balkh, Afghanistan).\n\nNow Carduelis chloris turkestanica (Zarudny, 1907). See Vaurie, 1956a: 8–10; Vaurie, 1959: 601–602; Howell et al., 1968: 236; Dickinson, 2003: 749; and Clement, 2010: 542–543.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 466940, adult male, collected at Wazirabad ( = Balkh), 36.46N, 66.50E (Times atlas), Afghanistan, on 1 December 1937, by Walter Koelz.\n\nComments:\n\nKoelz, in the original description, said that the type was an adult male (wing 91 mm), collected at Balkh, Afghanistan, 1 December 1937, and that he had an additional male and two females with the same data. AMNH 466940 bears the AMNH type label and Koelz's original label is marked “type” by him; I measure its wing at 91. Paratypes are: AMNH 466939, male, AMNH 466941, 466942, females, collected at Balkh on 1 December 1937, by Koelz.\n\nChloris sinica tschiliensis Jacobi\n\nChloris sinica tschiliensis Jacobi, 1923: 25 (Peking, Jingschujingtsze, Balihandiën).\n\nNow Carduelis sinica sinica (Linnaeus, 1766). See Vaurie, 1959: 602; Howell et al., 1968: 236; Dickinson, 2003: 749; and Clement, 2010: 543–544.\n\nSyntypes:\n\nAMNH 709209, adult male, AMNH 709210, female, collected at Westgräben bei Beijing ( = Peking) 39.55N, 116.25E (Times atlas), on 11 March 1916, by H. Weigold on the Stoetzner'sche Szetschwan-Expedition. From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Jacobi said that he had six males and five females collected at Peking, Jingschujingtsze, and Balihandiën, on 11 March, 2 May, and 26 June, and a juvenile female collected at Peking on 26 June. The above specimens were both collected near Beijing on 11 March 1916 and are both marked “Cotypus.” Wing measurements in pencil on the reverse of the original labels are: male 82, female 77.5, both measurements being given in the original description. These syntypes were not listed by Hartert in his lists of types in the Rothschild Collection and had not previously been included with AMNH types. Töpfer (2013) has recently discovered the whereabouts of the remaining 10 syntypes: six, with an additional one lost in World War II, SNSK; one, ZFMK; two, MCZ.\n\nChloris sinica ussuriensis Hartert\n\nChloris sinica ussuriensis Hartert, 1903: 64 (Sidemi-Mündung, Ostsibirien (Ussuri)).\n\nNow Carduelis sinica ussuriensis (Hartert, 1903). See Vaurie, 1959: 602–603; Howell et al., 1968: 236–237; Dickinson, 2003: 749; and Clement, 2010: 543–544.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 709174, adult male, collected at the mouth of the Sedimi ( = Sidemi) River, 43.00N, 131.29E (USBGN, 1959), Ussuri, eastern Siberia, Russia, on 30 April 1884. From the Dörries Collection (no. 2116) via the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Hartert gave the Dörries Collection number of the holotype and the range from eastern Siberia to Amur, Korea, and Sachalin and Askold islands. Paratypes in AMNH are: AMNH 709169–709173, 709175–709194, 14 males, seven females, four unsexed, collected on the Sedimi River, Amur Bay, 1884–1886, from the Dörries Collection; AMNH 709195–709208, 12 males, two females, from Gensan, Korea, collected by Robert Hall in April and May 1903. Of these, I did not find AMNH 709187 in the collection.\n\nThe name ussuriensis was published in November 1903 (Hartert, 1910: XIII). Rothschild noted in his unpublished and incomplete list of purchases (Archives, Department of Ornithology, AMNH) that he had received 212 specimens of Korean birds from Hall in August 1903, so those specimens would have been in Hartert's hand before the publication of ussuriensis.\n\nSpinus obscurus C.L. Brehm\n\nSpinus obscurus C.L. Brehm, 1855: 108 (Aeusserst selten in Deutschland).\n\nNow considered an aberrant specimen of Carduelis spinus (Linnaeus, 1758). See Hartert 1903: 71; and Hartert, 1918: 10.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 456881, female, collected in the Thüringer Wald, Germany, on 6 April 1819. From the Brehm Collection via the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nBrehm described only the female and said that it was very rare in Germany. He probably had a single specimen, which is apparently lacking all yellow pigment in the plumage.\n\nSpinus nigricauda Chapman\n\nSpinus nigricauda Chapman, 1912: 160 (Paramo, Santa Isabel, alt. 12700 ft, Central Andes, Colombia).\n\nNow Carduelis spinescens nigricauda (Chapman, 1912).

Allen and Leo E. Miller (no. 392).\n\nComments:\n\nChapman based his description on two specimens which he listed as adult males and gave the AMNH number of the holotype as AMNH 112752. This holotype was unsexed by the collectors. The paratype is AMNH 112753, adult male, collected at the type locality on 20 September 1911 by Allen and Miller (no. 515). Chapman (1917b: 32–40) described this expedition and the collecting localities.\n\nSpinus crassirostris amadoni George\n\nSpinus crassirostris amadoni George, 1964: 249 (about 20 kilometers northeast of Tarata (via Tacna-Puno road), 12,000 feet elevation, Departamento de Tacna, southern Perú).\n\nNow Carduelis crassirostris amadoni (George, 1964).

He also included in his new subspecies three specimens collected by Dorst (1962: 433) in 1960. Paratypes in AMNH: 117 km NE Tacna, AMNH 489481, female, 6 January 1963; 20 km NE Tarata, AMNH 489482, 489483, 489485, 489487, 489488, three males, two females, 28 March 1963; 8 km N Lampa, AMNH 489484, male, 19 October 1962, all collected by W. George. AMNH 1640 (alcohol collection), male, Tarata, 28 March 1963, collected by George, is also a paratype. Tarata is at 17.28S, 70.02W (Stephens and Traylor, 1983).\n\nSpinus peruanus paulus Todd\n\nSpinus peruanus paulus Todd, 1926: 51 (Zamora (3250 ft), Loja, Ecuador).\n\nNow Carduelis magellanica paula (Todd, 1926).

Cherrie (no. 22655).\n\nComments:\n\nTodd gave the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and typed (!) and initialed (WECT) his new name on the back of the AMNH label of the specimens he included as part of his type series. Of the 50 paratypes Todd (1926: 52) listed, the following were in AMNH: Ecuador, Calasnique, AMNH 41838, male, 30 September 1874; Alamor, AMNH 152925, 152926, male, female, 10, 13 July 1919, AMNH 172407, 172408, males, 23, 30 August 1921; Portovelo, AMNH 168122, female, 3 September 1923; Zamora, AMNH 168125–168127, two males, one female, 1–4 December 1920; Punta Santa Ana, AMNH 168128, male, 19 December 1920; El Paso, AMNH 168129–168138, seven males, three females, 9–14 January 1921; Bucay, AMNH 172410, male, 1 December 1921; Pallatanga, AMNH 173554, male, 29 July 1922. Peru, Milagros, AMNH 152923, 152924, male, female, 3–5 July 1919; Huancabamba, AMNH 175632–175638, four males, three females, 20 November–11 December 1922; Palamba, AMNH 175639–175642, two males, two females, 20 September–28 October 1922. Of these, AMNH 168130 and 168136 were exchanged to ANSP and AMNH 168133, 168134, and 168138 were exchanged to MCZ in July 1928. I did not find AMNH 175633 in the collection and it was perhaps exchanged without the catalog having been marked.\n\nSpinus magellanicus urubambensis Todd\n\nSpinus magellanicus urubambensis Todd, 1926: 65 (Cuzco (11,000 ft), Peru).\n\nNow Carduelis magellanica urubambensis (Todd, 1926). See Hellmayr, 1938: 279–280; Howell et al., 1968: 241; Dickinson, 2003: 750; and Clement, 2010: 553.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 129181, adult male, collected at Cuzco, 11,000 ft, 13.31S, 71.59W (Stephens and Traylor, 1983), Cuzco, Peru, on 16 October 1914, by Harry and Casimir Watkins.\n\nComments:\n\nTodd cited the AMNH number of the holotype in the original description and listed 33 specimens in his type series. Of the 32 paratypes, the following 12 were in AMNH: Peru, Cuzco, AMNH 129182, 129185, male, female, 18–26 November 1914; Tica-Tica, AMNH 145594–145596, three males, 2–3 July 1916; Lauramarca, AMNH 99181, male, 24 June 1899; Lucre, AMNH 99182, sex?, 10 July 1899; Oroya, AMNH 166138–166142, three males, two females, 3–7 March 1913. These paratypes had Todd's name typed on the AMNH label and initialed by him.\n\nSpinus magellanicus tucumanus Todd\n\nSpinus magellanicus tucumanus Todd, 1926: 62 (Lavalle (1800 ft), Santiago del Estero, Argentina).\n\nNow Carduelis magellanica tucumana (Todd, 1926). See Hellmayr, 1938: 283–284; Howell et al., 1968: 242; Dickinson, 2003: 750; and Clement, 2010: 553.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 142201, adult male, collected at Lavalle, 1800 ft, 28.12S, 65.08W (Paynter, 1995), Santiago del Estero, Argentina, on 17 June 1916, by Leo E. Miller (no. 17041) and Howarth S. Boyle.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Todd gave the AMNH number of the holotype and listed his 45 specimens, including the type. Of the 44 paratypes, the following 12 are in AMNH: Tilcara, AMNH 142210, 142211, male, female, 8–12 February 1916; Rosario de Lerma, AMNH 142199, 142200, males, 9–12 January 1916; Tafe del Valle, AMNH 142205, male, 6 April 1916; above San Pablo, AMNH 142206, male, 3 March 1916; AMNH 142207, male 19 May 1916; Lavalle, AMNH 142202–142204, female, two males, 17–26 June 1916; Angaco Sud, AMNH 142208, 142209, male, female, 7–9 August 1916. These paratypes had Todd's new name typed on the back of the AMNH label and were initialed by him.\n\nSpinus alleni Ridgway\n\nSpinus alleni Ridgway, 1899: 37 (Chapada, Matto Grosso, Brazil).\n\nNow Carduelis magellanica alleni (Ridgway, 1899). See Hellmayr, 1938: 282–283; Todd, 1926: 52–54; Howell et al., 1968: 242; Dickinson, 2003: 750; and Clement, 2010: 553.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 32618, adult male, collected at Chapada dos Guimarães ( = Chapada), 15.26S, 55.45W (Paynter and Traylor, 1991), Mato Grosso, Brazil, on 21 May 1883, by H.H. Smith.\n\nComments:\n\nWhen Allen (1891: 375) published on the Herbert H. Smith collection from Chapada, Mato Grosso, he identified his siskins as Spinus yarrelli (Audubon) and noted that he had two males, two young males and a female. Ridgway (1899: 37) found that this was not the correct identification and named the Chapada birds Spinus alleni with the type specimen listed as AMNH 32618, data cited as above. Hellmayr (1938: 282–283) accepted this name, included it as a subspecies of his Spinus magellanicus and gave an expanded range for the form, as did Todd (1926: 53). Both authors (Hellmayr, 1938: 273, Todd, 1926: 30–32) considered Spinus yarrellii a separate species with a range in eastern Brazil and northern Venezuela. This was also followed by Howell et al. (1968: 240, 242), both forms by then included in the genus Carduelis. Dickinson (2003: 750) and Clement (2010: 553) did not include Mato Grosso in the range of alleni, probably an inadvertant omission, as the type locality is Chapada.\n\nRidgway, by mentioning Allen's (1891) paper, made bibliographic reference to all of the specimens Allen had and the other four specimens are paratypes of Ridgway's name (ICZN, 1999: 76, Art. 72.4.1): Chapada, AMNH 31524, 32619–32621, one adult male, two young males, one female, colleted at Chapada dos Guinarães, in May and June 1883 (one dated June 1885), by H.H. Smith.\n\nSpinus olivaceus Berlepsch and Stolzmann\n\nSpinus olivaceus Berlepsch and Stolzmann, 1894: 387 (Vitoc).\n\nNow Carduelis olivacea (Berlepsch and Stolzmann, 1894). See Todd, 1926: 46–47; Hellmayr, 1938: 287; Howell et al., 1968: 243; Dickinson, 2003: 750; Schulenberg et al., 2010: 630; and Clement: 2010: 554.\n\nSyntype:\n\nAMNH 516205, adult male, collected at Vitoc, Garita del Sol, ca. 11.17S, 75.21W (Vaurie, 1972), Junin, Peru, on 13 February 1893, by Jean Kalinowski (no. 1872). From the Rothschild Collection.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Berlepsch and Stolzmann said that Kalinowski collected three males and one female on 24 July and 13 February 1893 at Vitoc and also included two specimens in the Berlepsch Collection, collected by G. Garlepp at Huayabamba, in their type series; they did not designate a type. Hartert (1919a: 157) recorded the above syntype in the Rothschild Collection, now AMNH 516205; it is marked “Typus” by Berlepsch and Stolzmann and bears a Rothschild type label. Mlíkovský (2009: 141) reported two additional syntypes in MIZ.\n\nMlíkovský (2009: 140) noted that Wolters (1953: 280) had provided a replacement name for Spinus olivaceus Berlepsch and Stolzmann, 1894 [preoccupied by Fringilla olivacea Rafinesque, 1810, now Carpodacus erythrinus (Pallas, 1770), if Carpodacus is merged with Carduelis].\n\nSpinus tristis pallidus Mearns\n\nSpinus tristis pallidus Mearns, 1890: 244 (Fort Verde, Yavapai County, in central Arizona).\n\nNow Carduelis tristis pallida (Mearns, 1890). See Hellmayr, 1938: 296; Howell et al., 1968: 245; Middleton, 1993; Dickinson, 2003: 750; and Clement, 2010: 559.\n\nHolotype:\n\nAMNH 52666, adult male, collected at Fort Verde, Arizona, on 3 May 1888, by Edgar A. Mearns. From the Mearns Collection (no. 6311).\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Mearns designated as holotype his no. 6311; this specimen bears an AMNH type label and the original label is marked “Type” by Mearns. He gave measurements for 10 males and 11 females from Arizona and his type series included a “quite large series of winter specimens of both sexes” and six specimens in winter plumage collected by Scott, on which Allen had commented (in Scott, 1887: 198). Mearns' paratypes from his series in AMNH are: Fort Verde, Arizona, AMNH 52667 (Mearns no. 5987), AMNH 52668 (5986), males, 20 January 1888; AMNH 52669 (4577), female, AMNH 52670 (4576), male, 6 March 1886; AMNH 52671 (3666) male, 30 December 1884; AMNH 52672 (3672), AMNH 52673 (3673), AMNH 52674 (3674), AMNH 52675 (3675), four females, 3 January 1885; AMNH 52676 (4342), AMNH 52677 (4344), AMNH 52678 (4346), AMNH 52679 (4348), two females, two males, 23 December 1885; AMNH 52680 (4559), female, 5 March 1886. Two additional Mearns specimens from this series came to AMNH with the Sennett Collection and are also paratypes of pallida: AMNH 83211 (4518, Sennett no. 5971), AMNH 83212 (4519, 5970), female, male, 1 March 1886.\n\nOf these paratypes, AMNH 52667 also bears an AMNH type label and is marked “Type of pallidus” by Mearns; it remains in the type collection with a label attached to explain its paratype status. AMNH 52676 is also marked “Type of pallidus” by Mearns, but had no AMNH type label attached; it is a paratype and remains in the regular collection.\n\nThe six paratypes collected by W.E.D. Scott are the following: Catalina Mills, Arizona, AMNH 83205 (Scott no. 994, Sennett no. 3354, old AMNH no. 28731), female, 3 February 1886; AMNH 83206 (989, 3349, 28726),; AMNH 83207 (991, ?, 28728), males, 19 December 1885; AMNH 83208 (993, 3353, 28730),; AMNH 83209 (992, 3352, 28729), males, 30 December 1885; AMNH 83210 (990, 3350, 28727), female, 19 December 1885. These six specimens had inadvertently been cataloged with the W.E.D. Scott Collection when it was purchased by AMNH ( = old AMNH no.) and the catalog is marked “Belong to Mr. Sennett—cataloged here by mistake.” When the Sennett Collection came to AMNH, they were then cataloged with the rest of the Sennett specimens. AMNH 83207 has both legs missing and neither a Scott nor a Sennett label is present; the AMNH label is tied on around the neck. Scott's number was ascertained from the old catalog entry.\n\nThe holotype of pallidus is the only specimen among all of the above in AMNH that is in full breeding plumage.\n\n[Acanthis carduelis britannica Hartert]\n\nAcanthis carduelis britannica Hartert, 1903: 68 (Rottingdean, Sussex).\n\nNow Carduelis carduelis britannica (Hartert, 1903). See Hartert, 1919a: 156; Hellmayr, 1938: 264; Vaurie, 1959: 608; Dickinson, 2003: 751; and Clement, 2010: 561–562.\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Hartert gave the number “1100” for the type in the Rothschild Collection, a male, collected at Rottingdean, Sussex, England, in April 1902, by the Brazenor Brothers. Later, he (Hartert, 1919a: 156) listed this type, but omitted any mention of the number “1100.” Hellmayr (1938: 264) noted that the type, formerly in the Rothschild Collection, was in the AMNH, New York, but did not say that he had examined it. As a matter of fact, the holotype did come to AMNH with the Rothschild Collection in 1932, but was one of the types of British birds that was presented to BMNH in 1936. It had been cataloged as AMNH 450918 and now bears BMNH Reg. no. 1936.10.15.14 (Warren and Harrison, 1971: 77).\n\nHartert (1903: 68) noted that he had 66 specimens of britannica but did not give further information that would assist in recognizing them. Certainly the 32 specimens in AMNH collected in Sussex by the Brazenors between December 1888 and April 1902 are paratypes: AMNH 710231–710235, 710237–710260, 710264–710266.\n\nAcanthis carduelis africanus Hartert\n\nAcanthis carduelis africanus Hartert, 1903: 69 (Mhoiwla bei Mazagan in Marokko).\n\nNow Carduelis carduelis parva Tschusi, 1901.

Riggenbach (no. 78).\n\nComments:\n\nIn the original description, Hartert cited Riggenbach's no. 78 for the holotype and said that he had 17 specimens collected by Riggenbach and himself in Morocco, five from Tunis, one from Aguilas, Spain, and others from Algiers. The following paratypes, collected prior to 1903, came to AMNH with the Rothschild Collection: Mhoiwla, AMNH 710337–710341, five males, February and May 1902, by Riggenbach, AMNH 710345, female, 8 April 1901, by Hartert; Tunis, AMNH 710391, sex?, 19 April 1858, from the Jardine Collection.

Allen's (1889c) study of Wied types was based on Wied's Brazilian collection, specimens from which had been purchased for the newly founded AMNH and Linaria americana was thus not mentioned by him. There is an AMNH catalog entry of a mounted bird from the Wied Collection from Missouri at AMNH 3063, with no indication that there was any reason to consider it a type. I have been unable to find this specimen.\n\nLinaria Holboellii C.L. Brehm\n\nLinaria Holboellii C.L.
