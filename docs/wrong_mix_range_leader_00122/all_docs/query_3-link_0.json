        "text": "The political system in East Timor is a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic,[1][2][3] whereby the Prime Minister of East Timor is the head of government and the President of East Timor functions as head of state. East Timor has a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the president and the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Parliament. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The East Timorese constitution was modelled on that of Portugal, with lesser power given to the president.[2] The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions. The Economist Intelligence Unit rated East Timor a \"flawed democracy\" in 2022.[4][needs update]\n\nExecutive branch\n\n[edit]\n\nThe head of state of the East Timorese republic is the President, who is directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term, and whose executive powers are somewhat limited by the constitution, the president is able to veto legislation, however this action can be overridden by the parliament. Following elections, the president usually appoints the leader of the majority party or majority coalition as the prime minister,. As head of government the prime minister presides over the cabinet.\n\nMain office-holders Office Name Party Since President José Ramos-Horta CNRT 20 May 2022 Prime Minister Xanana Gusmão CNRT 1 July 2023\n\nLegislative branch\n\n[edit]\n\nThe unicameral Timorese National Parliament (Parlamento Nacional) has 65 members elected by proportional representation (d'Hondt method) for a five-year term. The number of seats can vary from a minimum of 52 to a maximum of 65, with the exception of the first parliament, which included 88 members who previously served as the Constitutional Assembly six years rather than five (2001-2007). The longer term was in part due to the constitustion being put in place in 2002.[5]\n\nThe East Timorese constitution was modelled after that of Portugal.[6] The country is still in the process of building its administration and governmental institutions.\n\nPolitical parties and elections\n\n[edit]\n\nPresidential elections\n\n[edit]\n\nCandidatePartyVotes%Francisco GuterresFretilin295,04857.08António da ConceiçãoDemocratic Party167,79432.46José Luís GuterresFrenti-Mudança13,5132.61José NevesIndependent11,6632.26Luís Alves TilmanIndependent11,1252.15Antonio Maher LopesSocialist Party of Timor9,1021.76Ángela FreitasTimorese Labor Party4,3530.84Amorim VieiraIndependent4,2830.83Total516,881100.00Valid votes516,88197.74Invalid/blank votes11,9322.26Total votes528,813100.00Registered voters/turnout743,15071.16Source: CNE\n\nParliamentary elections\n\n[edit]\n\nPartyVotes%Seats+/–Alliance for Change and Progress (CNRT–PLP–KHUNTO)309,66349.5834–1Fretilin213,32434.16230Democratic Party50,3708.075–2Democratic Development Forum (PUDD–UDT–FM–PDN)34,3015.493+3Hope of the Fatherland Party5,0600.8100National Development Movement (APMT–PLPA–MLPM–UNDERTIM)4,4940.7200Republican Party4,1250.6600Social Democratic Movement (CASDT–PSD–PST–PDC)3,1880.5100Total624,525100.00650Valid votes624,52598.33Invalid/blank votes10,5911.67Total votes635,116100.00Registered voters/turnout784,28680.98Source: CNE\n\nRecent developments\n\n[edit]\n\nFrancisco Guterres, known as Lú-Olo, of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) was elected president in 2017 and held the position until May 2022.[7] The Alliance for Change and Progress (AMP), a three-party alliance, attempted to form a coalition with National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction, led by former president Xanana Gusmao, but the talks failed and Fretilin formed a minority government with the Timorese Democratic Party (DP) in September 2017. In October that year, the three opposition parties formed an alliance called Parliamentary Majority Oppositional Alliance (AOMP), and following pressures from this opposition alliance, president Guterres decided to dissolve the parliament in January 2018. This led to the second general election in May 2018.[8] In June 2018, former president Jose Maria de Vasconcelos known as Taur Matan Ruak of the Alliance of Change for Progress (AMP), became the new prime minister.[9] José Ramos-Horta of the centre-left CNRT has served as the president of East Timor since 20 May 2022 after winning the April 2022 presidential election runoff.[10]\n\nIn parliamentary elections held on Sunday, May 21, 2023, the opposition party led by Xanana Gusmao won 41% of the vote, making him likely to return as prime minister of the country in a coalition with at least one other party.[11]\n\nJudicial branch\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Supreme Court of Justice has one judge appointed by the National Parliament and the rest appointed by the Superior Council for the Judiciary. As mentioned in a 2010 source, the country was in the process of developing a legal system that includes private practice attorneys.[12]\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Municipalities of East Timor\n\nEast Timor is divided into thirteen municipalities:\n\nThe districts are subdivided into 65 subdistricts, 443 sucos and 2,336 towns, villages and hamlets. \"Ministerial Order\" (PDF).
