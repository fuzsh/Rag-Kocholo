        "text": "That’s it for our #UATransformationLab Study Trip 2024 to Berlin. Over the course of the past week, together with a group of 12 representatives of Ukrainian #thinktanks and NGOs from #Kyiv and different UA regions, we explored various facets of the #Berlin think tank landscape, visited civil society organisations and the German #Bundestag. The trip focused on German-Ukrainian relations, intercultural communication as well as policy advice and advocacy in an international context. We extend our special thanks to Stephan Bischoff and the office of MP Robin Wagener; Marco Gaj, office of MP Armin Laschet; Dr Susan Stewart, Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP); Eva Yakubovska, Kateryna Tarabukina, Vitsche, Krista-Marija L., Ukrainian Embassy; Nadja Sieffert, Mariia Vorotilina, Coopera e.V.; Prof Dr Heiko Pleines, Universität Bremen; Garry Poluschkin, Pavel Bilek, Berlin Economics; Rafael Loss, Gabriele Valodskaite, European Council on Foreign Relations; Teresa Becher, Merritt Fedzin, Polis180 e.V. - Grassroots-Thinktank für Außen- und Europapolitik; Oleksandra Keudel, Ph.D., Freie Universität Berlin (Free University of Berlin).

The event was held in collaboration with CES Ukraine. After IEP Director Prof Dr Funda Tekin welcomed our guests, speakers Nadiya Bihun, Deputy Minister of Economy of Ukraine & Maria Repko, Deputy Executive Director at CES Ukraine shared their expertise. The debate was moderated by our Research Associate Laura Christoph. Key challenges & developments identified in the debate: 👉Ukraine's GDP is forecast to increase by 3% in 2024 (EBRD) 👉91% of businesses, which had to cease operations in 2022, have resumed their work 👉Ukrainians remain resilient & creative under given circumstances 👉Human capital crisis is the most pressing issue for the economy: Ukraine is facing 30% population loss & massive internal displacement 👉Ukraine's energy sector is severely impacted by the war 👉A free Black Sea corridor & safe energy infrastructure are crucial for economic stability 👉 To make it harder for Russia to attack the energy grid, Ukraine focuses on more small-scale and distributed generation systems 👉#Ukraine aims at more efficient & sustainable energy systems, high demand for relevant components & investors 👉Budget gaps have flattened out Ukrainian defence spending, while #Russia is increasing military budget. International support at this level will not bring success but make the war longer & more expensive 👉Lack of private investments could be addressed with the 50 bn in 🇷🇺 frozen assets 👉Russia must be prevented from obtaining Western cutting-edge military technology 👉Open EU market to export UA goods like metal or agricultural products crucial for Ukraine 👉With a view to EU accession, Ukraine's lithium & rare earth deposits should be emphasised more strongly The present expert guests also raised the questions of electricity imports, the resilience of #Kharkiv's economy despite attacks, and the outcomes of the Ukraine Recovery Conference with regard to the economy. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the discussion, to our speakers for their valuable inputs & our guests for their comments and questions! This was our last #BreakfastDebate for the foreseeable future, but we hope to continue the format in 2025. The German-Ukrainian #BreakfastDebates are part of the #UATransformationLab, a joint project by Institut für Europäische Politik e.V., New Europe Center, Cedos & Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, kindly supported by Auswärtiges Amt (Federal Foreign Office) Germany. #BreakfastDebate #CivilSocietyCooperation #URC2024 Photos by Pavlo Slobodnychenko."
