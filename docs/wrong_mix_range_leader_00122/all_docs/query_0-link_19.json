(In Ukrainian)\n\n16 May 2023 - ,\n\nSuspilne\n\nForeign policy / EPC FLASH ANALYSIS\n\nToday’s Gymnich menu: Russia for lunch; China for afternoon tea\n\nWhen EU ministers for foreign affairs meet today in Sweden, they have a full menu: Russia and its aggression on Ukraine for lunch; EU-China relations for the afternoon tea or coffee. While there is greater convergence and unity on how Brussels and the EU27 should respond to Moscow’s armed geopolitical revisionism, future relations with Beijing are harder to digest. Clearly, there has been a gradual European hardening on China over the last few years, but the several dimensions and layers of EU-China ties make it a much harder challenge to address in a fully coherent and coordinated way.\n\nHence, it should not come as a surprise if what comes out of the informal Gymnich meeting is a sharper reiteration of current China as a ‘partner,’ ‘competitor,’ and ‘rival’ policy. Commission President von der Leyen’s ‘de-risking-not-decoupling’ compass is also likely to feature high, but the basic tenets of the EU’s China strategy are unlikely to change fundamentally. Besides, calling China a ‘rival’ is already a sunk diplomatic cost: Beijing rejects that characterisation, and unless the EU scraps the term altogether, it is pointless for policymakers to devise a synonym that is likely to equally annoy the Chinese.\n\nChina and Russia are on today’s menu, but they are not the only countries with which the EU needs to grapple with. Apart from these two big players, a key relationship is the one with the United States. Although transatlantic relations are presently on a better path despite known irritants, 2024 may take the two sides of the Atlantic back to the future if Mr Trump or a Trumpian candidate is elected. Before the upcoming election cycle starts, the EU and the US should rapidly set up ‘transatlantic guardrails’ to keep the relationship on track irrespective of the outcome of the US presidential elections.\n\nAs the world becomes geopolitically more fragmented and competitive, the EU needs to think more deliberately about its global relations and devise a policy of ‘strategic diversification’ across all policy areas, also assessing and mapping countries that can advance or hinder the objectives of the Union, from economic security and military defence to the green and digital transitions. This represents a large swath of nations worldwide – like-minded and not. Indeed, ‘strategic diversification’ would allow the EU, in the long-term, to act autonomously when it needs to do so to defend or advance its values or interests and in partnership when its aims are better served by acting together with other countries that share the same values and/or interests.\n\nEU autonomy through diversification may be better than pursuing the current ambivalent path that risks alienating friends and competitors. Maybe ministers can have ‘strategic diversification’ with brännvin for a nightcap?\n\nP.S. – President Macron’s “Made in Europe” doctrine published today in the media is also a good weekend reading.\n\n12 May 2023 - ,\n\nSingle market / EPC FLASH ANALYSIS\n\nThe Commission must defend the EU’s biggest asset – the Single Market\n\nCommission actions against internal market infringements fell by 80 per cent from 2020 to 2022 in the first three years of von der Leyen’s term as president, compared with the corresponding period under her predecessor Jean-Claude Juncker. At the same time, companies have reported an increasingly skewed playing field, with varying sourcing prices across countries and local exceptions to European rules, which constitute internal trade barriers at the expense of consumers and European competitiveness.\n\nThis comes on top of a consecutive liberalisation of state aid rules over the last few years, which threatens to fragment the Single Market. Germany and France have spent 80 per cent of the 672 billion euros in state aid granted since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, leaving businesses in smaller and fiscally weaker states at a competitive disadvantage. A recent settlement prohibiting the sale of Ukrainian grain in Eastern EU member states has further strained the Single Market.\n\nThe Single Market is thus acutely threatened on its 30th anniversary and just a month after a Commission communication celebrating its achievements. The Commission has had to invest significant resources to deal with a set of crises since von der Leyen took office in late 2019. And overall, it has delivered an impressive policy response to the Covid crisis, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the competitiveness challenge of the American IRA. But compromising the internal market, which constitutes the backbone of the EU economy, is not something the EU can afford in times of permacrisis.\n\nThis is because a functioning Single Market is essential for the EU’s triple transition goals: the green and digital transition as well as the objective to reach greater economic security in an increasingly confrontational geo-economic environment. The Single Market has increased competition, labour specialisation and economies of scale and pushed the efficiency of the EU’s economy to unprecedented levels over the past 30 years. It could facilitate the development of new European industries or value chains, especially in the key green and digital fields in the future.\n\nThe Commission should therefore focus its resources on stronger enforcement of Single Market rules across all member states. It should also further harmonise rules in fields where the Single Market has been underdeveloped, particularly in services, energy and financial markets. The liberalisation of state aid should be limited in time and scope, and instead, more European-level financing should be mobilised, which would not undermine the Single Market.\n\n11 May 2023 - ,\n\nEU sanctions / INTERVIEW\n\nInterview with Deutschlandfunk\n\nPhilipp Lausberg was interviewed by Deutschlandfunk on the EU's 11th sanctions package against Russia and how it addresses loopholes in the sanctions regime.\n\nThe recording is available here.
