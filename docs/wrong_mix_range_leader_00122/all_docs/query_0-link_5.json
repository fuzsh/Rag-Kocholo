        "text": "Authorities said Monday they had uncovered an assassination plot against imprisoned Medellin drug lord Pablo Escobar Gaviria by the rival Cali cartel. They said the plotters intended to use 500-pound bombs to blow up Escobar's prison in Colombia. The plotters apparently managed to get three of the four bombs _ purchased from a Salvadoran air force officer _ out of the country, the officials said. Nine people have been arraigned in criminal court on charges of possession of and theft of weapons of war, officials said. In Bogota, Colombia, police said they were searching for the three bombs. Colombian authorities have barred all aircraft from airspace over the jail at Envigado, where Escobar is awaiting trial on charges of murder and smuggling cocaine.\n\nMexicans arrested in \"Moreliagate'\n\nMORELIA, Mexico _ Authorities have arrested three government agents who reportedly posed as journalists to try to bug a meeting of the leadership of Mexico's largest opposition party, an official said Monday. Leaders of the National Action Party charged that the three Interior Ministry agents left a tiny microphone and transmitter hidden in a conference room at a hotel in Morelia, where the party's national executive committee was to meet. They also claimed the men obtained confidential party documents. The attorney general's office said the three were expected to give statements to investigators today. Newspapers have started calling the case \"Moreliagate.\"\n\nBelgium gets new prime minister\n\nBRUSSELS, Belgium _ Belgium's new prime minister promised on Monday that his government would regain the confidence of voters, who have grown weary of political crises. Jean-Luc Dehaene, a Christian Democrat who leads a new center-left coalition, told parliament his government's top priority would be cutting the budget deficit and pushing through constitutional reforms that would give more power to Belgium's main regions, Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia. Constant disputes between the two have brought down most Belgian governments since World War II: Dehaene's is the 35th. His government ends the era of Europe's longest serving premier, Wilfried Martens, who served for 12 years.\n\nElsewhere . . .\n\nBEIRUT, Lebanon _ In the first official statistics on Lebanon's civil war, police said Monday that more than 144,000 people were killed and nearly 200,000 wounded from 1975 to 1990. The report excluded 6,630 people killed and about 8,000 wounded in related conflicts involving Palestinians. The report said that 17,415 people remain missing and that most are presumed dead.\n\nBELFAST _ Protestant and Catholic politicians in Northern Ireland resumed talks Monday, but there was concern the discussions could be delayed because of a British general election, which British Prime Minister John Major is expected to call for April 9. The talks are aimed at returning the province to local power-sharing government after 18 years of British rule.\n\nLONDON _ China formally acceded to the Non-\n\nProliferation Treaty Monday and pledged to help prevent the spread of nuclear arms and work for nuclear disarmament. China is the last major nuclear power to sign the treaty.\n\nDARWIN, Australia _ A Portuguese \"peace boat\" with students and activists aboard set sail Monday for East Timor, with an Indonesian navy flotilla determined to block it. The protesters want to lay wreaths at the Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili, East Timor, in memory of the 50 to 180 civilians massacred by Indonesian troops in November. Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975."
