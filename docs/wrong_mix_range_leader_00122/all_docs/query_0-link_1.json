He serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and the Appropriations Committee. Prior to the Senate, Murphy served for three terms in the U.S. House representing the state's fifth congressional district. In Congress, Murphy is acknowledged as a leading voice for stronger anti-gun violence measures, a smarter foreign policy, and reform of our nation's mental health system. Before being elected to Congress, Murphy served for eight years in the Connecticut state legislature.\n\nMurphy graduated with honors from Williams College in Massachusetts, and received his law degree from the University of Connecticut School of Law.\n\nHe is married to Catherine Holahan, an attorney, and they have two sons, Owen and Rider.\n\nMs. Rosenberger assumed her position as Chair of the Board of Trustees of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) in March 2023. AIT is a non-profit, private corporation established pursuant to the Taiwan Relations Act to manage the U.S. unofficial relationship with Taiwan. As Chair, she participates in senior-level policy discussions on Taiwan and represents the Administration in visits to Taiwan and in meetings with Taiwan representatives in the United States.\n\nMs. Rosenberger has nearly two decades of deep, high-level experience on the Indo-Pacific, both in and out of government, including on Taiwan, China, cross-Strait, and broader national security issues. Ms. Rosenberger worked on these issues at senior levels in the U.S. government, most recently as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for China and Taiwan on the National Security Council (NSC) at the White House, where she advised the President and National Security Advisor on all matters related to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan, led development of the Biden Administration’s China Strategy, developed strategies to responsibly manage U.S.-PRC competition, and led the broadening and deepening of U.S. unofficial relations with Taiwan.\n\nMs. Rosenberger also served in a range of positions at the State Department and the NSC. As Chief of Staff to then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken and as Senior Advisor to then-Deputy National Security Advisor Blinken, she provided counsel on the full range of national security policy. In her role as Senior Advisor at the NSC, she also managed the interagency Deputies Committee, the U.S. government’s senior-level interagency decision-making forum on our country’s most pressing national security issues. Her other assignments included NSC Director for China and Korea; Bilateral Political Unit Chief on the State Department’s Office of Chinese and Mongolian Affairs; Special Assistant for the Asia-Pacific to then-Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Bill Burns; and Foreign Affairs Officer in the State Department’s Office of Korean Affairs. She first joined the State Department as a Presidential Management Fellow.\n\nOutside of government, Ms. Rosenberger founded and served as Director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy and as a Senior Fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF), where she focused on strategies to counter authoritarian threats to democracies. She also served as Foreign Policy Advisor to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMs. Rosenberger received her master’s degree in international peace and conflict resolution from American University’s School of International Service and received her bachelors’ degrees with honors from Penn State University’s Schreyer Honors College and College of Liberal Arts in sociology, psychology, and women’s studies. She is originally from Pittsburgh, PA, and is an avid Steelers fan.\n\nSusan A.

She is currently a Senior Fellow and Visiting Lecturer in Law at the Yale Law School Paul Tsai China Center. She is also the director of the Forum on Asia-Pacific Security at the National Committee on American Foreign Policy and a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nUntil July 2018, Thornton was Acting Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the Department of State and led East Asia policymaking amid crises with North Korea, escalating trade tensions with China, and a fast-changing international environment. In previous State Department roles, she worked on U.S. policy toward China, Korea and the former Soviet Union and served in leadership positions at U.S. embassies in Central Asia, Russia, the Caucasus and China.\n\nThornton received her M.A. in International Relations from the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and her B.A. from Bowdoin College in Economics and Russian. She serves on several nonprofit boards and speaks Mandarin and Russian.\n\nGraham Allison is the Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at Harvard University where he has taught for five decades. Allison is a leading analyst of national security with special interests in nuclear weapons, Russia, China, and decision-making. Allison was the “Founding Dean” of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, and until 2017, served as Director of its Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs which is ranked the “#1 University Affiliated Think Tank” in the world. As Assistant Secretary of Defense in the first Clinton Administration, Dr. Allison received the Defense Department's highest civilian award, the Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, for \"reshaping relations with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to reduce the former Soviet nuclear arsenal.\" This resulted in the safe return of more than 12,000 tactical nuclear weapons from the former Soviet republics and the complete elimination of more than 4,000 strategic nuclear warheads previously targeted at the United States and left in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus when the Soviet Union disappeared.\n\nDr. Allison’s latest book, Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap? (2017), is a national and international bestseller. His 2013 book, Lee Kuan Yew: The Grand Master’s Insights on China, the United States and the World, has been a bestseller in the U.S. and abroad. Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe, now in its third printing, was selected by the New York Times as one of the \"100 most notable books of 2004.\" Dr. Allison's first book, Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis (1971), ranks among the all-time bestsellers with more than 500,000 copies in print.\n\nAs \"Founding Dean\" of the modern Kennedy School, under his leadership, from 1977 to 1989, a small, undefined program grew twenty-fold to become a major professional school of public policy and government.\n\nAs Assistant Secretary of Defense under President Clinton and Special Advisor to the Secretary of Defense under President Reagan, he has been a member of the Secretary of Defense’s Advisory Board for every Secretary from Weinberger to Mattis. He has the sole distinction of having twice been awarded the Distinguished Public Service Medal, first by Secretary Cap Weinberger and second by Secretary Bill Perry. He has served on the Advisory Boards of the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the CIA.\n\nDr. Allison was the organizer of the Commission on America's National Interests (1996 and 2000), a founding member of the Trilateral Commission, a Director of the Council on Foreign Relations, and has been a member of public committees and commissions, among them the Baker-Cutler DOE Task Force on Nonproliferation Programs with Russia, the IAEA’s Commission of Eminent Persons, and the Commission on Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism.\n\nDr. Allison has served as a Director of the Getty Oil Company, Natixis, Loomis Sayles, Hansberger, Taubman Centers, Inc., Joule Unlimited, and Belco Oil and Gas, as well as a member of the Advisory Boards of Chase Bank, Chemical Bank, Hydro-Quebec, and the International Energy Corporation.\n\nDr. Allison was born and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was educated at Davidson College; Harvard College (B.A., magna cum laude, in History); Oxford University (B.A. and M.A., First Class Honors in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics); and Harvard University (Ph.D. in Political Science)."
