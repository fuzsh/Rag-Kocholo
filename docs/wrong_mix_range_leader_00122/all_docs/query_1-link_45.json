Humanity & Inclusion worked in the country to champion the rights of people with disabilities and to promote their inclusive employment, among other activities. Since 2017, East Timor has been included in a regional program with the Philippines and Indonesia but HI currently has no projects in the country.\n\nPeople with disabilities in East Timor often experience multiple layers of discrimination and even violence due to certain beliefs and traditions and are unlikely to be able to attend school or find employment.\n\nHumanity & Inclusion also campaigned to defend the rights of people with disabilities at local and national levels and to increase recognition of their right to a life of dignity. The organization worked with organizations of people with disabilities to create conditions favorable to the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n\nHumanity & Inclusion is not currently conducting any projects in East Timor."
