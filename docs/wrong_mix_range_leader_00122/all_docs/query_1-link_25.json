        "text": "This guide was created to highlight resources that could be useful to someone conducting research on Timor-Leste (East Timor); however, it is not a comprehensive review of sources. Instead of being organized by type of resource, this guide is divided into three tabs—history, languages, and government—that feature resources relevant to each topic.\n\nThe history tab lists several books about the periods of Portuguese colonialism, Indonesian control, and independence.\n\nThe languages tab showcases six articles about the linguistic makeup of Timor-Leste. In addition, it features links to relevant databases and a 1907 Tetum-Portuguese dictionary.\n\nLastly, the government tab gives a brief description of Timor-Leste's government structure and has links to some of the country's government entities, such as the Ministry of Finance. It also provides information on Timor-Leste's cultural heritage institutions and statistics office.\n\nAll resources provided in this guide come from or can be accessed through the University Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign."
