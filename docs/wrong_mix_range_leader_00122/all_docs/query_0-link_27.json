        "text": "Top jobs 2.0 - deal or no deal? European leaders get back to Brussels this week after a failed, early attempt to put together Team Europe. Cliché perhaps, but these are the names of the top policymakers that should - in principle - lead Europe’s political, economic and foreign policy efforts into the next cycle. So it matters. And it’s an interesting one. Giorgia Meloni, winner of the European election in Italy, was angered last week by the approach to the talks. No need for a diplomatic debrief, her body language said it all. The Italian premier went through a whirlwind week. She hosted her dream G7 surrounded by a sea of lameduck leaders- only to find herself out of the game in Brussels a few days later. The big names representing the consensus of centrist parties got into a room and started to trade jobs. She wasn’t in the picture. Those of us who follow Meloni in Brussels have come to know there is one thing she dislikes above all - being snubbed. Or at least the perception of it. Not being in the picture inevitably becomes a domestic story for her back in Rome and leads to unflattering comparisons with Mario Draghi, her predecessor. One of her personal obsessions is to show Italy isn’t relegated under her watch. The top jobs negotiations is a test for her. Overall, putting the Italians in a corner is a risky strategy. And Meloni makes a fair point; the results of the European elections show von der Leyen 2.0 cannot be a straight continuation of the first von der Leyen mandate. Macron and Scholz came out weaker. Pedro Sánchez came second losing to the conservatives in Spain. And yet - the photograph (without Meloni) is important because it shows the limits of her approach and institutionalization. Meloni claims she will talk to everyone - there is no Serie A and Serie B for member states. But if there is something Monday’s failed talks showed us is that she couldn’t simultaneously be photographed with Orban and then enter the room with Macron and Scholz. Two out of the main political groups - the Socialists and Liberals - have made it their policy, perhaps the only that sticks in this context with their voters, not to enter deals with the far right. Meloni aimed to be in both rooms but ultimately couldn’t. The European Council meets again this week. It’s not about the deal - but the how.\n\nMario Draghi goes deep on industrial policy - but who, if anyone, will give him the platform to deliver? Interesting to see the amount of times China is mentioned. Ample evidence suggests «China’s progress owes to sizeable cost subsidies, trade protection and demand suppression, and that part will lead to lower employment for our economies» the biggest source of inequality for Europeans and among Europeans. On the much debated USA/ Europe productivity gap, Draghi notes, excluding tech and digital, both would be practically on par measured over a period of the past 20 years. But the modern economy is based largely on tech innovation and digitalization. Interestingly, Draghi looks to Sweden as a test case - tech sector twice as productive - can reinforce the social model. To close the gap across the Atlantic, lower energy costs, leverage single market, boost research and innovation budget and financing. The mother of all questions in Brussels. Draghi acknowledges level of financing required is and will be enormous. His support for joint funding is clear. The challenges ahead, he says, will require unprecedented level of cooperation among EU member states. But - and this is my addition - the political landscape following the European elections remains complex and the Draghi card is up in the air. Who, if anyone, can give him a platform now?\n\nMuch is written these days about the surge of the far-right in Europe ahead of Sunday’s election. If that’s your take, you’re a cycle too late. What changes now is the institutionalization of power. Over the past two years, except for Spain, governments across the union have switched from left, progressive to conservatives with or without alliances. Europe itself has pivoted into much harder positions. Certainly when it comes to migration and green policies, partly societal, partly economic. I covered the 2019 campaign, the energy on the campaign was forward looking, young and climate focused. This campaign has been played on the defensive. Sunday is a vote on the institutionalization of the fringes and power from within. Top jobs, portfolios and working majorities. In that sense, it is a transcendental vote. And every European should be paying attention.\n\nEuropean elections: Italy Giorgia Meloni is running as lead candidate for Brothers of Italy in the upcoming European elections. She will run as Giorgia, and her pitch is Italy will change Europe. Over the past year, the Italian premier has built a close working relationship with Ursula von der Leyen, who arguably now needs her more than Meloni needs her if she wants to secure a second term at the Commission. The balance of power will even out if VDL secures her Commission 2.0 but nonetheless the influence of Meloni is objectively growing on the Commission president. Meloni hasn’t endorsed von der Leyen’s candidacy - and don’t expect her to do to so while the campaign is underway. Giving too much, too soon, lowers your bargaining power in Brussels. And Meloni knows her MEPs will be key. There’s also a political component; among her base, von der Leyen is divisive. In fact, being seen as too close to VDL, is a net negative on the campaign. Let me explain: In France, Jordan Bardella and Marine Le Pen are vocal about their opposition to VDL and their determination to undo her policies. Both have challenged Meloni to do the same. She won’t, but she won’t applaud VDL either. As long as the campaign is on, they will maintain tactical distance. On May 23, there will be a televised debate between Meloni and Elly Schlein, head of the PD. This will be the first opportunity to learn about Meloni’s vision for Europe. Over the past month, we’ve had a myriad of reports about the future of the EU and the single market. Macron delivered his Sorbonne 2.0 speech and Mario Draghi is finalizing his report. When it comes to Meloni, details are scarce. The campaign has so far played out on national politics and she is facing growing criticism over her Government’s influence on the public broadcaster RAI, which looms large on the Italian public debate. While her party is polling first, support seems to have peaked lately. As I mentioned earlier, Meloni is running a campaign centered around her. She is running as Giorgia. By putting her name forward, she strategically maximizes her visibility: head of Government, host of the G7 and now election candidate (although it is clear she won’t swap Rome for Brussels after the election even if she leads it). It’s about dominating the public space. That’s of course, not without criticism. When covering Brussels, one thing becomes clear: if you’re able to facilitate deals at the European Council, your stock goes up. The question remains: to do what?\n\nMario Draghi - cambiamento radicale. The speech that has galvanized the conversation in Brussels around competitiveness in a global race. «Radical change - that’s what is needed.» The Draghi report will be presented in July. In the meantime, a preview that’s not just technical, but highly political: “Restoring our competitiveness is not something we can achieve alone, or only by beating each other. It requires us to act as a European Union in a way we never have before. Our rivals are stealing a march on us because they can act as one country with one strategy and align all the necessary tools and policies behind it. If we are to match them, we will need a renewed partnership among Member States – a re-defining of our Union that is no less ambitious than what the Founding Fathers did 70 years ago with the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community.” Two key questions: Who will implement a vision that calls for fundamental changes to the way the Union is managed? And is there consensus? The European elections and - importantly - the nominations for top jobs across the institutions are the two main events to watch."
