Tower of Power, the legendary funk and soul band renowned for their horn-led sound, are set to celebrate a significant milestone as they commemorate 55 years of touring. To honor the achievement, the band has announced over 30 additional tour dates across the United States to conclude the anniversary celebration this year. The second half of this momentous event will commence on Aug. 10 and extend until Dec. 17, encompassing various destinations from the far Pacific Northwest to the Deep South.

Reflecting on their remarkable journey, Emilio Castillo, the founder and bandleader of Tower of Power, shared, “55 years have flown by in the blink of an eye, and this year has been extraordinary. From a captivating late-night performance at the Jazz Fest in New Orleans alongside the Symphony to mesmerizing crowds at festivals and clubs throughout the UK and Europe, we are thrilled to share this special moment with our fans worldwide, particularly during the holiday season. Here’s to 55 more years!”

Currently amidst a sold-out European tour, the band will return to the United States for a series of performances in select markets. Notable stops include Providence, R.I., and Kansas City, Mo., where the local symphony will accompany the band. Additionally, Tower of Power will headline a momentous hometown show at Oakland, Calif.’s beloved Fox Theater in December.

While the August, September, October, and part of November performances will showcase traditional Tower of Power shows, from Thanksgiving onwards fans can expect a holiday twist. Titled Holidays & Hits, these shows will blend the band’s beloved chart-topping hits with a sprinkling of beloved holiday classics.

In addition to standard admission tickets, Tower of Power is offering a limited quantity of VIP access for most shows on the newly announced tour. The VIP experience includes preferred seating, a Tower of Power bomber jacket, a collectible VIP laminate, Tower of Power pins, and a commemorative VIP ticket.
