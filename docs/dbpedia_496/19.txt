“55 years have flashed before us in the blink of an eye, and this year has been extraordinary,” shared Emilio Castillo - founder and bandleader for Tower of Power. “From a late night Jazz Fest performance in New Orleans with the Symphony to festivals and clubs across the UK and Europe, we couldn’t be more thrilled to celebrate this moment with our fans across the globe, especially those around the holiday season. Here’s to 55 more!”

The band, currently in the midst of a month-long, sold out trek through Europe, returns to the States to perform in select markets such as Providence, RI and Kansas City, MO - both of which will feature the local symphony - and a big hometown show in Oakland at the iconic Fox Theater this December.

While all dates in August, September, October and (part of) November will be traditional Tower performances, fans attending from Thanksgiving on can expect a holiday twist. Holidays & Hits will feature the fan-loving chart-topping hits with a dusting of select holiday classics.
