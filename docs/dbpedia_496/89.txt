Join the Old Sugar Mill as we “kick off” a weekend long celebration of “Farm to Fork Uncorked!”

Join us out on the Plaza lawn listening to Oakland’s very own, Tower of Power (TOP). Tower of Power is an American R&B and funk based band since 1968. They will be performing their hit songs, ” Down to the Night (Bump City)”, “What is Hip”, “Clean Slate”, ” Your still a Young man”, and more.

Receive a Complimentary Souvenir Wine Glass (everyone 21 & up) with ticket purchase! The wineries will be uncorking wine throughout the evening along with food trucks serving up some delicious bites. (Food & wine available for purchase).

Doors open at 5:00 PM, Sacramento’s Own Lab Rat’s will perform at 6 PM, and Tower of Power hits the stage at 7:30 pm. The event concludes at 10 PM. This is an outdoor event. A limited number of patio tables and chairs are available; however, seating is first come first serve. You are welcome to bring a low back chair or blanket for lawn seating.
