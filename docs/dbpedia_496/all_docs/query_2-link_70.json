        "text": "Tickets on sale: Friday, November 24 at 10AM\n\nFor over 55 years, Tower of Power has delivered the best in funk and soul music.\n\nBump City, their 1972 debut for the label, was a hit on both the Billboard 200 and the R&B Albums chart, and netted them the hits You’re Still A Young Man and Down to The Nightclub. The 70s were a boom period with radio classics like So Very Hard to Go and What Is Hip?, and the band continued to tour and record over the years.\n\nThe future of Tower of Power is set out to be vigorous and dynamic, and will prove to be just that for fans around the world starved for the band’s groove… just the way Tower of Power likes it!"
