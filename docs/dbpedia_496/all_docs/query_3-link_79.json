        "text": "Tower of Power, the ensemble known for their iconic horn-led funk and soul lean, has announced their new holiday EP, It’s Christmas, a collection of traditional songs associated with the annual winter celebration. In addition to impending music, the band also shared a series of select tour dates slated for 2024. News from Tower of Power arrives on the heels of their 55 anniversary.\n\nIt’s Christmas was produced by Joe Vannelli and bandleader Emilio Castillo at Blue Moon Studios in Agoura Hills, Calif., just outside Los Angeles. The seven-track collection presents the group’s take on Christmas classics from “Santa Claus is Coming to Town” to “Silver Bells” and “O Holy Night.” In addition, the EP boasts an original, “It’s Christmas (A Long Way from Home),” written by Emilio, Doc Kupka, and Joe Vannelli.\n\nPaired with the news of forthcoming music, Tower of Power also shared a series of tour dates. The first patch of dates picks up this month and flows into December when the band marks the season with a series of holiday and hits gigs. Then, at the end of January, they’ll start another round of tour dates extending into February and March.\n\n“55 years have flashed before us in the blink of an eye, and this year has been extraordinary,” shared Castillo. “2023 has been a monumental year for Tower of Power – from a sold-out European tour to performances with world-renowned symphonies and shows that have attracted fans from every era of Tower of Power’s history. And we’re glad to be celebrating the holiday season with the release of our new EP. We can’t wait to get back out in 2024 to keep the spirit of funk and soul alive!”\n\nScroll down to view the tracking list for It’s Christmas and a list of tour dates.\n\nFor more information on Tower of Power, visit their official website.\n\nIt’s Christmas Tracking List:\n\nThe Christmas Song\n\nThis Christmas\n\nA Very Special Christmas\n\nSanta Claus is Coming to Town\n\nSilver Bells\n\nIt’s Christmas (A Long Way from Home)\n\nO Holy Night\n\nHolidays and Hits 2023:\n\nNovember 25 – Thousand Oaks, Calif.\n\nNovember 26 – Las Vegas, Nev.\n\nNovember 28 & 29 – Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nDecember 1 – El Cajon, Calif.\n\nDecember 2 – Coachella, Calif.\n\nDecember 3 – Lemoore, Calif.\n\nDecember 5 – Grass Valley, Calif.\n\nDecember 7 – Salem, Ore.\n\nDecember 8 – Spokane, Wash.\n\nDecember 10 – Tulalip, Wash.\n\nDecember 12 – Kalispell, Mont.\n\nDecember 13 – Ketchum, Idaho\n\nDecember 15 – Oakland, Calif.\n\nDecember 16 – Campbell, Calif.\n\nDecember 17 – Cerritos, Calif.\n\n2024:\n\nJanuary 27 – Soul Train Cruise\n\nFebruary 4 – Ft.
