        "text": "TOWER OF POWER 'Dinosaur Tracks' is -believe it or not- a complete, fully-loaded, totally groove-filled PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED STUDIO ALBUM from 1983.\n\nSoulful ballads. Up-tempo swingfests. And a couple disco-twinged dance numbers (remember this was the early 1980s now, wasn't it?). All with that unique trademarked sound of the mighty TOWER OF POWER horn section. While one of these tracks snuck out awhile back to be used on a European -then later US- release and another was later re-recorded for a live album, this is THE VERY FIRST TIME ANYWHERE this ENTIRE studio album, just as TOWER OF POWER originally intended it to be, has appeared anywhere on Earth.\n\nTOWER OF POWER 'Dinosaur Tracks' is an individually numbered limited edition 14-track compact disc. It has -of course- a nifty booklet with a history of the creation of this album, as well as a track-by-track commentary, from TOWER OF POWER leader Emilio Castillo.\n\nTOWER OF POWER has undergone many incarnations over its thirty years. The band, way cool and way hip, which you'll find on 'Dinosaur Tracks' is:\n\nEMILIO CASTILLO 2nd Tenor Sax, Background Vocals\n\nSTEPHEN \"DOC\" KUPKA Baritone Sax\n\nGREG ADAMS 2nd Trumpet, Flugelhorn, Background Vocals\n\nCHESTER THOMPSON Hammond B3 organ, Acoustic Piano, Synthesizer, Background Vocals\n\nWILLIE JAMES FULTON Guitar, Background Vocals\n\nMIC GILLETTE Lead Trumpet, Trombone, Background Vocals\n\nMARC RUSSO Alto & Lead Tenor Sax\n\nMICHAEL JEFFRIES Lead & Background Vocals\n\nVITO SAN FILIPPO Bass\n\nMARK SANDERS Drums\n\nwith\n\nLENNY PICKETT Lead Tenor Sax on \"You Taught Me To Love\"\n\nVICTOR PATTERSON Drums on \"You Taught Me To Love\"\n\nMastered from the original tapes under TOWER OF POWER's careful supervision, 'Dinosaur Tracks' is one of those rare, remarkable Archival discoveries: A finished studio album from a outstanding band which, for a series of reasons almost amusing in retrospect, sat more-or-less unheard of and forgotten in a Vault for seventeen years.\n\nUntil now, that is.\n\nUPC: 081227770327"
