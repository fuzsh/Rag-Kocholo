        "text": "Early Life[]\n\nWanda Maximoff and her twin brother, Pietro, were born to a nomadic Romani witch named Natalya near Novi Pazar, in Serbia. Afraid of harming her children due to her perilous lifestyle, Natalya Maximoff placed the babies under the care of her brother, the ventriloquist Django, and his wife, the gentle Marya. When the High Evolutionary and his Knights ravaged the region where the Maximoffs lived in search of babies for his experiments, the twins were kidnapped by a catholic priest and brought to the Evolutionary's citadel on the Wundagore Mountain, in Transia.[18] The High Evolutionary made alterations to the twins' genomes, disguising them as regular mutants.[22] The babies were nursed by one of the Evolutionary's servants, the humanoid cow and midwife Bova. While under the Evolutionary's care, the newborn Wanda Maximoff was imbued with the mystic energies of the Wundagore Mountain, which was in fact a prison for the demon-lord of chaos known as Chthon. From that moment on, she acquired a natural latent talent for the practice of magic. Bova and the Evolutionary attempted to have the twins to be adopted by World War II heroes Whizzer and Miss America. However, the former fled in desperation while the latter perished after a miscarriage. Instead, a disappointed Evolutionary returned the babies to Django and Marya Maximoff.[50]\n\nWanda and Pietro lived a happy childhood, constantly travelling alongside their foster parents' tribe in Central and Eastern Europe.[3] Wanda's potential for magic eventually attracted the attention of a powerful coven formed by Margali Szardos, Maria Russoff, and Lilia Calderu. Calderu approached Marya Maximoff and had her bring Wanda to Castle Russoff. They hoped to recruit Wanda into their coven as an apprentice, being able to predict her future as a relevant magic wielder. However, servants of Chthon, Taboo and Damballah, interfered with Wanda's initiation. The battle only ended once Wanda was able to manifest her hex powers for the first time, accidentally allowing Chthon to reach out to her soul and make it known that Wanda was not allowed to join any coven. The witches then returned Wanda to her family.[51]\n\nUnder their family's protection, Wanda explored her mystic potential freely while Pietro manifested an unusual superspeed power. Afflicted by poverty and the lack of opportunities to provide for his family, Django began to steal food for his starving family and enraged villagers attacked their caravan. Using his phenomenal speed, Pietro fled from the camp with his sister. The circumstances of their separation from their clan were so traumatic that not until well into adulthood could they remember anything but the barest details of their childhood. For the next few years, Wanda and Pietro wandered central Europe, living off the land.[3][52][53][54][55]\n\nBrotherhood of Evil Mutants[]\n\nWanda accidentally set fire to an unnamed village with her powers and was attacked by villagers. One of them proclaimed her to be \"a Scarlet Witch,\" which would later become her codename. Magneto arrived at the scene, and rescued Wanda from the villagers. Due to this rescue, Wanda felt indebted to Magneto. She was willing to serve him until her debt was repaid.[5]\n\nWanda and Pietro were later recruited into Magneto's Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and, as the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, fought the X-Men on several occasions.[56][57] Throughout her tenure, Wanda fended off romantic advances from fellow member Mastermind. She proclaimed that she would rather die, than become his wife.[5]\n\nIn their initial battle with the X-Men in Santo Marco, the Scarlet Witch knocked out Angel, who had incapacitated her brother, in retaliation and brought the captured X-Man to Magneto. But the X-Men forced them to abandon their prisoner and even the entire country.[5] At their next scheme, Scarlet Witch disagreed with Magneto's plan to kill the X-Men. During his attempt to kill every X-Man except the captive Angel, Scarlet Witch used one of her hexes to short-circuit Magneto's control panel. She injured one of Magneto's hands in the process. Before Magneto could \"teach her a lesson,\" Wanda hid behind her protective brother Quicksilver. Subsequently, Wanda was nearly injured by debris created by one of Cyclops' blasts.[58]\n\nAt their next conflict with the X-Men, Quicksilver was easily captured by Marvel Girl. Wanda was worried about her brother's safety, and asked Magneto to save him. She instead learned that Magneto was about to fire a deadly weapon against the entire group of X-Men, willing to sacrifice Quicksilver's life to gain victory. Wanda tried to stop him, but Magneto threatened to kill her for defying his decisions. Namor intervened on Wanda's behalf and destroyed the equipment before it could be used.[59]\n\nWhen Magneto, Mastermind, and Toad fled from X-Men's attacks, Wanda chose to stay behind. All by herself, she demanded that the X-Men release her brother immediately, but she was in no position to impose demands. Namor, however, came to her aid and started to fight the X-Men. He easily defeated the Beast and the Angel but was immobilized by Cyclops' blasts. Before their fight could escalate further, Professor X intervened, revealing to Wanda that he had placed Quicksilver under mind-control. He was willing to release him to Wanda's custody, as he didn't consider the twins anything more than Magneto's pawns.[59]\n\nTo have her brother returned to her, Wanda convinced an angry Namor to back down. Upon leaving the scene, Namor remarked upon his attraction to the Scarlet Witch. But her beauty reminded him of Susan Storm, and he feared that this potential relationship would be similarly doomed, and he would end up being rejected, so he departed.[59]\n\nAvengers[]\n\nThey soon abandoned their terrorist activities, while Magneto was imprisoned by the Stranger,[60] and joined the Avengers. The remaining founding members had all gone on a leave of absence, leaving Captain America to lead an all-new lineup including Wanda, Pietro, and the archer known as Hawkeye.[32] By then, the Scarlet Witch would have rather become an actress, but she never had a chance to pursue such a career.[61] They left the Avengers after the Scarlet Witch lost her powers and Quicksilver was shortly influenced by Magneto again.[62]\n\nThe Scarlet Witch then began a quest to recover her powers by studying grimoires, with Quicksilver and the Toad supporting her. Her studies accidentally summoned extra-dimensional caudillo Arkon, who kidnapped the Witch to make her his bride, the Toad when he opposed, and then a number of Earth-born scientists in an attempt to use atomic power to save his own world, Polemachus, even by destroying Earth. Quicksilver gained the help of the Avengers,[63] the Avengers managed to save Polemachus without damaging Earth, Arkon ceased any further violence against Earth and renounced to the Scarlet Witch because she had convinced him of the importance of small things. Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch then resumed their membership with the Avengers.[64] The Toad chose to remain at Polemachus.[65]\n\nNot long after the birth of Quicksilver's first child, Wanda and Pietro learned a secret about their parentage, that Magneto was allegedly their true father.[31]\n\nAlthough she became more adept in her power's use, Wanda did not realize that she was tapping into genuine magic. It was believed that the Scarlet Witch would have been an ordinary energy manipulator or perhaps simply able to cause bad luck if not due to Chthon's attempt to use her as a pawn.[66]\n\nWanda fell in love with the synthezoid Vision, an artificial being created by Avengers foe Ultron who joined the team rather than fight them. The Scarlet Witch eventually married her teammate, the android Vision, not realizing that they were being manipulated by Immortus, who sought to prevent Wanda from having a child under the belief that Wanda was actually a key figure, or nexus being, to her reality, and her children would have the power to shake the foundations of the universe.[67]\n\nWanda eventually drew on magic energy to give birth to twin sons, Tommy and Billy, but this energy was eventually revealed to have come from the demon Mephisto, who reabsorbed them, effectively ending their existence. Agatha Harkness cast a spell to make her forget her children in order to ease her pain.[37] Though Wanda later recalled her loss,[13] she suppressed this memory over the long term.[68] After his reformation, The Vision and Wanda no longer shared the closeness they once had.[69][70]\n\nForce Works[]\n\nWhile both were serving as members of the Avengers West Coast, Wanda also grew to love Wonder Man, the man whose brain patterns had been used to form the Vision's mind. Both were among the former AWC members who opted to form Force Works after the team's dissolution. As the leader of this new team, Wanda used a 'hex mainframe' computer designed by Iron Man. Through her powers and the computer's calculations, they could proactively determine where the team was most needed rather than react to an alarm or breaking news. Although Wanda was appointed team leader, she often clashed with Iron Man overriding her orders. She was deeply saddened by Wonder Man's death on the first mission of Force Works.[71]\n\nRejoining the Avengers[]\n\nAfter rejoining the Avengers, Wanda found that her powers were growing stronger. She also discovered a bond with her powers and the deceased Wonder Man, and eventually succeeded in resurrecting him. The two soon began a relationship.[72]\n\nTraining with Agatha Harkness increased Wanda's control of her 'chaos magic'. Even after Agatha died her astral form continued to assist Wanda. However, at least some of this training may have been an illusion created by Wanda herself.[73]\n\nWanda became one of the leading figures of the Avengers, whose constantly rotating roster included various reservists participating in missions on and off. She and Wonder Man eventually ended their romance amicably, and she attempted to salvage her relationship with Vision as best she could - although sparks also appeared with Captain America towards the end of her Avengers tenure - the moment she brought the team to its lowest moment ever recorded.[74]\n\nBreakdown[]\n\nThe Scarlet Witch seemingly gained powerful reality-altering abilities from \"chaos magic\"; however, this proved to be an uncontrolled aspect of her mutant power and created a great mental strain on her. An unintentional remark by teammate Wasp about Wanda's lost children eventually drove her over the edge. Blaming the Avengers for robbing her of her children, she suffered a nervous breakdown and lashed out with her new power, subjecting the Avengers to a savage assault and seemingly killing Agatha Harkness and some of her teammates. Others were injured or affected by various unexplained outbursts and incidents, including Vision, who was killed by She-Hulk after Wanda used her powers to force him into attacking the Avengers.[73]\n\nDoctor Strange appeared, sensing abuse of magic, and angry that he had not been notified of Wanda's recent problems. Strange was forced to use the Eye of Agamotto on Wanda, which showed her a memory so horrible she went into a catatonic state. Magneto suddenly appeared to collect his daughter. Uncertain what to do with her, the Avengers turned her over into his custody, and Magneto brought her to Genosha so Professor X could help her.[75]\n\nBy the end of Wanda's rampage, Avengers Mansion was destroyed, Ant-Man, Hawkeye and Vision were dead, several Avengers such as Warbird and She-Hulk suffered severe emotional trauma, and Iron Man endured significant damage to his reputation and finances, leaving him unable to continue to finance the team. With most active members deciding to leave the group, the Avengers officially disbanded.[73]\n\nHouse of M[]\n\nDespite his best efforts, Professor Xavier proved unable to get through to Wanda. Keeping Wanda in a comatose state, Xavier ultimately called a meeting between the Avengers and X-Men to decide whether or not Wanda should be euthanized, fearing that her powers would threaten all of reality. Quicksilver was horrified at the fact that their father and friends were seriously considering killing Wanda and convinced Wanda to take desperate action to keep this from happening: By using her powers, Wanda warped reality, creating a world where mutants were the majority, humans the minority, and Magneto the ruler (simultaneously giving various other heroes what they wanted most, hoping this would help them accept the new world).[76] In this reality, Wanda was seemingly a human, living a peaceful life with her two children.[77][42]\n\nA young mutant named Layla Miller found herself remembering the real world and was able to use her mutant abilities to restore several of the heroes' memories. Meanwhile Wolverine (the only person who sensed the reality's \"wrongness\") and a resurrected Hawkeye (who had been seemingly killed during Wanda's breakdown) and Cloak gathered these heroes into an assault force to try to restore reality. This rag-tag army headed to Genosha to attack Magneto, believing him to be the one responsible for the change. During the battle between Magneto's forces and the others, Layla was able to restore Magneto's memories, just as Wanda confessed to Dr. Strange that it was Quicksilver, not Magneto, who had initiated the reality warp.[78]\n\nEnraged, Magneto confronted Quicksilver, angry that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name. In the ensuing scuffle, Magneto killed Quicksilver.[42]\n\nWanda revived her brother, and broke down in a fit of hysteria, telling Magneto that Quicksilver had only wanted him to be happy and that Magneto had ruined them, choosing mutantkind over his own children. Wishing to punish her father, Wanda uttered the words \"No More Mutants\", restoring reality to its original form but with the intention of de-powering all mutants. Through the intervention of Emma Frost and Dr. Strange, a small percentage of mutants were saved.[79] Surviving mutants and ex-mutants would come to refer to this as \"M-Day: The worst day in mutant history\".[80]\n\nWanda's actions caused countless deaths, as mutants lost their powers in sensitive situations, such as while flying, or were left with mutant bodies that were unable to sustain life without their mutations.[79]\n\nPost-House of M[]\n\nAfter the fallout, the resurrected Clint Barton tracked Wanda to a small village near Wundagore Mountain, where he unknowingly saved her from a thief. Wanda was living in a small apartment with her only relative, her \"Aunt Agatha\". She appeared to be powerless and believed that she had lived her entire life in the village. She did not recognize Hawkeye, nor did she remember her life with the Avengers or other events. Wanda told Hawkeye that he was her \"hero\" for dealing with the thief and kissed him, and they spent the night together. The following morning, while Wanda was sleeping, Hawkeye became curious about the next room where \"Aunt Agatha\" was supposedly sleeping, but the doorknob appeared to shift away from his hands, a subtle reality manipulation usually associated with the Scarlet Witch. However, Clint looked back to see that Wanda was still asleep.[81]\n\nIn his desperate quest to reverse M-Day, Beast later found Wanda at the same village. Wanda showed no memory of him either, and showed no interest when he attempted to steer the conversation towards the Avengers or their common past, but told him a story with a warning to be careful what he wishes for, which Beast interpreted as her remembering him.[82]\n\nThe Young Avengers Wiccan and Speed decided to find Wanda, as Wiccan wanted to know once and for all if she was indeed their mother. They traveled to several places connected to Wanda and themselves in their search, but Wiccan was unable to detect any sign of Wanda's magic. Wiccan and Speed united to search for her around the planet, but both ultimately failed, though they were told by Master Pandemonium that they had to cease their quest to seek her, lest risk unleashing the darkness of the Witch's past yet again.[83]\n\nLater, the Asgardian god Loki, concealed in an astral form by simple spells and illusions, disguised herself as Wanda and assembled a new team of Mighty Avengers to be led by Hank Pym to oppose Chthon. Chthon was eventually banished back to his own dimension, and his human vessel Quicksilver was released from his control. Loki's goal was to prevent another god of chaos from laying siege to the Nine Worlds and cracking Norman Osborn's armor to quicken his fall. She continued to assemble the Mighty Avengers, who remained unaware of Loki's involvement.[84]\n\nNone were aware that the true Wanda had yet to reemerge from seclusion, as only Clint Barton, Beast and higher powers than they, such as the Living Tribunal or Uatu knew of her status. Quicksilver, having joined the Mighty Avengers, sought to use his position on the team to find her, a desire not missed by the impassive Loki. Pym also wanted to use Pietro in turn to solve the mysterious return of Wanda Maximoff.[85]\n\nAgamotto later detected her presence and displays her as one of thirty possible candidates for the role of Sorcerer Supreme through his Eye, but due to her apparent lack of magic and past instability refrained from selecting her, instead choosing Brother Voodoo to fill the position.[86]\n\nThe Children's Crusade[]\n\nWanda was found in Latveria by her alleged son Wiccan. She seemingly lost all her memories and powers and was engaged to Victor von Doom. Wiccan told her about who she was, and what she did. He also told her about her twin sons, and almost told about his suspicions that he and Speed were actually her reincarnated sons. His story was interrupted by the battle between the Avengers, the Young Avengers, Magneto and Doctor Doom. Wolverine tried to kill Wanda but was stopped by Iron Lad, who teleported the Young Avengers and Wanda into the timestream.[87]\n\nThey all went into the past and met reanimated Jack of Hearts, who exploded. After that Wanda remembered who she is, and regained her powers and returned herself, the Young Avengers and Scott Lang to the present.[88] She then finally confirmed that Billy and Tommy were indeed her reincarnated sons.[20]\n\nRealizing that her sons are alive Wanda met with X-Factor and re-powered Rictor, planning to restore powers of all depowered mutants who wanted it.[89]\n\nIt was revealed that Wanda's ability was brought about when Doctor Doom assisted her in becoming a conduit for Life Force itself, in an effort to recreate her children. The power was too great for her to control, leading to her breakdown. Doom stole Wanda's power and became omnipotent, but while battling the Avengers and the X-Men, his powers overloaded, leaving him with his scarred face again and powerless. Unable to continue the battle, he teleported himself away. The X-Men agreed to leave her be, Magneto and Quicksilver both wished to spend time with her as a family and Captain America offered her a spot in the Avengers, but Wanda declined saying she needed to be alone.[90]\n\nAvengers vs. X-Men[]\n\nWanda played a key role during the events featured in AVX. After defeating both M.O.D.O.K. and A.I.M. with the help of Ms. Marvel and Spider-Woman, she visited Avengers Mansion but was not welcomed by Vision. She then began to have visions of the Phoenix Force; and during one of those visions, she foresaw a future in which the Phoenix killed the original Avengers.[91]\n\nBelieving the Mutant Messiah to be the key to defeating the Phoenix Five, which consisted of the Phoenix Avatars Cyclops, Emma, Namor, Magik, and Colossus, the Avengers launched an operation to extract Hope from Utopia. If it wasn't for Wanda, they would have been defeated by Cyclops. Wanda convinced Hope to go with the Avengers, as Cyclops vowed that he would no longer tolerate the Avengers.[92]\n\nAfter a confrontation between the Avengers and the Phoenix Five, in which Wanda defeated Magik, she began to train Hope with Spider-Man's help in Wakanda, but the Phoenix Five decided to take Hope back with them. Hope revealed that Wanda was the only Avenger the X-Men feared and respected. Doctor Strange gave Amulets of Illusion to different Avengers to make them appear as Wanda when she wasn't present, in hopes of scaring the Phoenix Five. It worked to a degree and bought the other Avengers time to complete missions across the globe. The Phoenix Five began to suspect the many-Wandas were an illusion, so Namor decided to attack one of them. Much to his disappointment, she was the real Scarlet Witch and she defeated him. Namor then led the Atlanteans into war against Wakanda, and nearly defeated all of the Avengers, until Wanda showed up and defeated him.[93]\n\nMeanwhile Iron Fist had taken Hope and Wolverine to K'un-Lun to hide and prepare for a confrontation with the Phoenix Five. When Cyclops learned of their location, he decided to travel there and take Hope back with him, but Hope used Wanda's and Shao Lao the dragon's power to send him to the Moon. After a brief confrontation between Hope and Wanda, which was stopped by Captain America, the Avengers came to realize Cyclops had become the sole-wielder of the Phoenix Force. Cyclops took the title Dark Phoenix after killing Professor X.[94]\n\nThe Dark Phoenix began to burn the world, so Wanda and Hope decided to join forces in order to stop him. Together, they managed to take down Dark Phoenix. The Phoenix escaped Cyclops's body and entered Hope's. Hope used its power to reverse the damage and destruction caused by Dark Phoenix and restore the mutant population. Then, as Wanda had once used her powers to wish away mutants by uttering the words, \"No more mutants,\" Wanda and Hope joined their powers and wished, \"No more Phoenix\", forcing the Phoenix Force away from Earth by the spell.[95]\n\nUncanny Avengers[]\n\nWhile visiting Charles Xavier's grave, Wanda was approached by Rogue who tried to make her leave. The two wound up fighting, when they were captured by the Red Skull. The Red Skull also took Xavier's corpse and cut out his brain, claiming his vast telepathic powers for himself.[44] The Red Skull then used his powers to brainwash Wanda into helping him de-power mutantkind once again. While tracking down Rogue who had escaped his custody, Wanda encountered Xavier's corpse which snapped her out of the Skull's control.[96] Scarlet Witch and Rogue were mentally controlled into allowing being executed by the mentally-controlled mutant-hating crowd Red Skull gathered, but snapped back once the Avengers Unity Division appeared to fight Shmidt.[97] After Red Skull and his S-Men escaped, Wanda and Rogue joined the Avengers Unity Division.[98]\n\nDuring a mission involving the Apocalypse Twins, Wanda was killed by Rogue who thought she had betrayed the team.[99] Her death was undone when Havok and the surviving members of the Unity Squad were sent from the future by Kang to stop the twins from destroying Earth, their minds projected back into their past selves so that they could transfer most of their powers to Rogue and give her the strength to fight back.[100] After the crisis was over, Rogue was in the process of being driven mad by all the heroes she had absorbed. The Scarlet Witch cast a spell to return those powers to their owners, although Rogue still retained the powers and the very essence, she absorbed from Wonder Man.[101]\n\nAXIS[]\n\nMonths after the battle against the twins; Wanda, Rogue, and Alex were abducted by Red Skull's S-Men and taken to his re-education camps in Genosha. After escaping, they encountered Magneto, also held there. They broke him free and confronted the Red Skull and the S-Men.[102]\n\nFueled by MGH, Magneto killed the S-Men, and beat the Red Skull to death, accidentally unleashing the Red Onslaught, the merging of the Skull with the dark and powerful Onslaught.[103] They were soon aided by the Avengers, X-Men, and allies of both teams, who arrived to Genosha upon learning about the Red Onslaught's existence. However, the Red Onslaught deployed their own version of the Sentinels made specifically to battle heroes.[104] In the ensuing battle against the Sentinels, the Scarlet Witch was neutralized along with numerous other heroes.[105] After being broken free by a group of super villains gathered by Magneto to fight the Sentinels, Wanda and Doctor Doom performed a spell to invert the moral compass of the Red Skull in order to defeat him. The spell worked and the Red Onslaught was defeated, but the spell also accidentally affected everyone in Genosha, turning heroes into villains and vice versa.[106]\n\nUnder the influence of the inversion spell, the Scarlet Witch set out to kill Doctor Doom in revenge for his manipulations.[107] Magneto and Quicksilver joined forces to prevent Wanda from crossing the line but failed.[108] Using a spell meant to affect those with blood ties to her, Wanda seemingly killed Quicksilver. To her surprise, the spell didn't affect Magneto, revealing that the Master of Magnetism wasn't actually her father.[7]\n\nDoom briefly fled from the fight, to bring back Doctor Voodoo, who used the spirit of his brother Daniel to possess Wanda so she could \"cooperate\" in the conjuration of a reinversion spell, which successfully brought almost everyone back to normal, including the Scarlet Witch. In the wake of the conflict, the Avengers Unity Division was reassembled.[4]\n\nCounter-Earth[]\n\nWanda and Pietro returned to the Wundagore Mountains to find out their true parentage, and they were brought to the reformed Counter-Earth, which the High Evolutionary used to test and try to create his perfect New Men.[109] The twins encountered the Low Evolutionary, the leader of a resistance formed by the High Evolutionary's rejects.[19]\n\nAfter being tracked down and defeated by Luminous, a new creation by the High Evolutionary with both Quicksilver's and Scarlet Witch's powers, Wanda and Pietro were brought to the High Evolutionary himself.[110] He revealed to them that Django and Marya Maximoff were their true parents, as well as the truth that the twins were supposedly not mutants but they had been experimented on by the High Evolutionary. After escaping from the Evolutionary's experimentations, Pietro and Wanda located the Avengers Unity Division, who had traveled to the Counter-Earth looking for the twins, and helped the inhabitants of Lowtown, a refuge for the High Evolutionary's rejects, from their creator's assault.[22] After the High Evolutionary was forced to flee through a portal once he was defeated, the Unity Division returned to Earth.[111]\n\nAll-New, All-Different Marvel[]\n\nSeeking to find her place after all the revelations of her true past, Wanda found herself investigating a recent disruption in magic, as well as meeting the spirit of her biological mother, Natalya Maximoff (Django Maximoff's sister), who was apparently the Scarlet Witch before Wanda.[112] When the second superhero Civil War began, Pietro came to ask Wanda for help, but Wanda refused, because she and Pietro disagreed on which side was right—Pietro not liking the idea of profiling people based on what they might do and Wanda feeling that thinking about the future would have prevented many of their more dangerous mistakes in the past. Past precedent made Wanda feel that introducing her powers to a conflict of this nature could make the situation more dangerous (plus she distrusted Tony Stark), and she resented Pietro for trying to tell her what to do as though she was a child, bluntly informing him that his refusal to learn from his mistakes marked him as a sociopath.[113]\n\nSecret Empire[]\n\nWhen Captain America launched a plan of conquest after having been secretly turned into a Hydra sleeper agent by a sentient Cosmic Cube, the Scarlet Witch joined other superheroes in Washington, D.C. in trying to stop Hydra from taking control of the capital. They ultimately failed,[114] and in the process Hydra neutralized Wanda by having her become possessed by Chthon once again.[115] Under possession, Wanda joined Hydra's Avengers.[116] She was eventually freed from Chthon's possession by Doctor Strange during the final battle against Hydra.[117] After the fall of Hydra's regime,[118] Scarlet Witch rejoined the Avengers Unity Division and helped them defeat an out-of-control Graviton.[119]\n\nPretender[]\n\nWith the establishment of a mutant exclusive island nation on the island of Krakoa, the Scarlet Witch became a diabolical figure in Krakoan society, being referred to as the \"pretender\".[6] Remorseful due to her past transactions against mutants, she decided to reverse the genocides that mutants had suffered by Cassandra Nova in Genosha. Doctor Strange advised against her efforts, but the Scarlet Witch explored ways to resurrect the mutant victims, unaware of the Krakoan Resurrection Protocols. The spell she cast did not work, raising the corpses of the mutants killed on Genosha as the undead.[46] The Scarlet Witch sought help from Doctor Strange, who countered the spell. As it would take thirty days to return all the dead, a barrier was placed around Genosha to prevent any of the dead from leaving. The barrier did not prevent the living from entering the island though, since the alien Cotati set up a base on the island as part of an attempted invasion and were attacked by the mutant zombies. When the Gateways on Krakoa were affected, Krakoan mutants investigated and wound up under siege until the spell took effect. The Krakoans remained unaware the Scarlet Witch was responsible for this crisis.[120]\n\nConcurrently, the Scarlet Witch was recruited by the Avengers chairperson, the Black Panther, to investigate the Savage Land during the Cotati invasion. One of the Cotati, Veltri, unleashed a controlled Man-Thing against the team and also revealed that they had Shanna the She-Devil under their control as well.[121] Shanna attempted to convince her husband Ka-Zar to join the Cotati while the Avengers were immobilized. The Scarlet Witch employed her magic to take Ka-Zar into his wife's mind to free her from the Cotati.[122] After Ka-Zar was stabbed by the Black Knight's Ebony Blade, the Scarlet Witch, Doctor Voodoo, and Shanna worked together to revive him. With the Cotati in the Savage Land overpowered,[123] the Scarlet Witch joined the other Avengers in their victorious final fight against the aliens.[124] As a celebration, the Scarlet Witch attended the wedding of Wiccan and Hulkling.[125]\n\nDarkhold[]\n\nSensing Chthon return, the Scarlet Witch discovered that the original Darkhold book had been uncovered by Doctor Doom and his prime champion Victorious. Reluctantly, she joined forces with Doom to defeat Chthon. They learned that Chthon was once defeated by a group of five warriors called the Darkhold Defenders. With Victorious' help, the Scarlet Witch assembled a modern version of the team, formed by some of her superhero allies. The group read excerpts of the Darkhold to chase for Chthon in the Other-Realm; however, they were corrupted.[47]\n\nThe deviant team was sent to defeat Chthon's army and weaken him. The Scarlet Witch then entered Chthon's domain with Doctor Doom to confront the demon directly. She betrayed Doctor Doom and took the Darkhold in order defeat Chthon herself. Fused with the book, she was able to defeat and possess Chthon entirely. Empowered by the Darkhold and Chthon, she undid the corruption. Afterwards, the Scarlet Witch taunted Doom for his past abusive schemes against her and proclaimed her freedom.[24]\n\nRedeemer[]\n\nDuring the first Krakoan Hellfire Gala, Magneto invited the Scarlet Witch to the event. Ashamed, she saw him in private only, sharing a wish of making amends with the mutant community.[23] That night they performed a mystic ritual to increase the capabilities of the Resurrection Protocols, whose existence had been revealed by Magneto. By folding time, the Scarlet Witch attempted to allow mutants who had died before Cerebro was activated and potential future mutants to be resurrected from a plane called the Waiting Room. In order to link this place with Krakoa, the Scarlet Witch arranged for her own sacrifice since being resurrected on Krakoa would activate the process. Using a glamour spell, she made her suicide look like a murder.[8] Her dead body was found by her son Speed on Krakoa,[28] and Magneto was blamed for her assassination.[126]\n\nA bizarre investigation led the Avengers to invade Krakoa and Magneto to counterattack. Meanwhile, Magneto and Hope secretly had the Scarlet Witch resurrected without the Quiet Council of Krakoa's knowledge, using an old mental backup. This \"younger\" version of the Scarlet Witch met the Avengers unaware of the most recent events concerning her life.[127] Struggling to cope with being introduced to traumatic memories, the Scarlet Witch conjured gigantic monsters that attacked Krakoa. In the Eldritch Orchard, the present-day Scarlet Witch faced an older version of herself.[128] The old woman explained the monsters where manifestations of her guilt and shame and that she forgave herself to get rid of them. As the three Scarlet Witches joined forces against the monsters, they merged together.[29] Falsely accusing Toad to be her killer in order to protect Magneto, the Scarlet Witch exposed the Waiting Room's existence. Reformed as a mutant savior and finally putting the M-Day behind her, the Scarlet Witch became known by the Krakoan society as \"the Redeemer.\"[8]\n\nThe Last Door[]\n\nWanda moved to Lotkill, New York, where she opened a metaphysical shop called the Emporium. There, she created an enchanted doorway that was designed to open for those with nowhere else to turn. Finding new purpose as the hero of the hopeless, Wanda solved an array of problems for a diverse range of clientele. Wanda offered shelter and a job to Darcy Lewis, a journalist who had come through the Last Door after running afoul of the Bacchae. While assisting a young woman named Jarnette, Wanda obtained a strange pendant with the ability to repel magic. After Wanda helped settle her debts with Scythia, Darcy continued to work at the Emporium while investigating the pendant’s origins. Polaris later confirmed that the pendant was made out of an altered form of the mutant metal, mysterium.[129]\n\nDuring this time, Wanda was invited to join a new iteration of the Avengers, led by Captain Marvel.[130] Wanda was also reunited with her mentor, Agatha Harkness, who warned Wanda of the danger of imprisoning Chthon within her own soul. After an initial confrontation, Agatha expressed pride and support for Wanda, but secretly infiltrated Wanda’s soul and stole Chthon’s heart.[131]\n\nWanda was surprised when Magneto’s wayward clone, Joseph, arrived at her door, but willingly gave him a place to stay. However, Joseph had been sent by the alchemist Hexfinder to gain Wanda’s trust and get past her defenses. Using the low mysterium, Joseph and Hexfinder set a trap to kill Wanda, but in the end, Joseph betrayed Zosimos and sacrificed himself to save the Scarlet Witch's life."
