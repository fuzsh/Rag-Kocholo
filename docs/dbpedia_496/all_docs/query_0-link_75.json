        "text": "Steve Prefontaine\n\nYears competed: 1970-1973\n\nMajor: Broadcast Communications, UO '74\n\nHometown: Coos Bay, Oregon\n\nIf there existed a Mount Rushmore for former Oregon student-athletes, the candidates for such an honor would be numerous, but at least one would be a near unanimous pick.\n\nSteve Prefontaine.\n\nHe was a star runner, an icon who blazed his own trail on and off the track, and an inspiration for the jogging boom across the United States in the late-20th century. Known simply as “Pre,” he grew up in Coos Bay on the Oregon Coast and earned rock star status across the nation before his untimely death at the age of 24.\n\nPrefontaine ran with a flamboyant style, refusing to stalk the leaders and instead pushing the pace at every opportunity. He saw running not only as a test of speed and fitness but of toughness and grit, and said famously, “to give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.”\n\nPrefontaine arrived at the University of Oregon in 1969, having won two high school state cross country championships and three more state titles on the track for Marshfield High School. He finished third in the NCAA Cross Country Championships as a freshman but took home the titles as a sophomore, junior and senior, and he won four straight titles on the track in the three-mile/five-kilometer event.\n\nAt one point, Prefontaine owned all eight American records at distances between 2,000 and 10,000 meters, and between two miles and six miles. He also held eight collegiate records while at Oregon, and in 38 races at Hayward Field between 1970 and 1975, Prefontaine won 35 times.\n\nThe three losses all were in the mile, but Prefontaine broke the 4-minute barrier in that distance nine times. His personal best for a mile was 3:54.6 in 1973, less than four seconds off the world record at that time.\n\nIt was at the 1972 Olympic Games that Prefontaine captured the eye of the world. After setting the American record at 5,000 meters in the U.S. Olympic Trials, 13:22.8; Prefontaine was determined to run with his trademark style in the Olympics. He took the lead in the last mile in Munich, only to fall to fourth in the home stretch.\n\nAn automobile accident claimed Prefontaine’s life in May 1975, leaving the running community to wonder what might have been at the 1976 Olympics and beyond. But Prefontaine’s legacy lives on to this day, inspiring runners around the world to ask their bodies for more than it seems possible to give, so as not to sacrifice the gift.\n\n- Rob Moseley, UO Athletics\n\nAshton Eaton\n\nYears competed: 2007-2010\n\nMajor: Psychology, UO '10\n\nHometown: Bend, Oregon\n\nIt’s not that the Hayward Field faithful needed more reasons to love Ashton Eaton. After all, the Bend, Ore., native had won five NCAA titles during his storied UO career including a victory in front of the home crowd in his final collegiate competition at the 2010 NCAA Championships.\n\nTwice a world medalist—2011 (decathlon/silver) and 2012 (heptathlon/gold)—in his first two seasons as a professional, the adoration for Eaton grew when he broke the world record in the decathlon at the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team Trials in Eugene.\n\nIn front of a frenzied 21,795 fans at Hayward Field on June 23, 2012, Eaton completed the two-day, 10-event display with 9,039 points to become just the second man in history to eclipse the 9,000-point barrier in the decathlon, besting the previous world record of 9,026 points set by the Czech Republic’s Roman Sebrle in 2001.\n\nEntering the final event—the 1,500 meters—Eaton needed to produce a personal best to topple the world mark and, with the uproarious support of the fans, he responded with a time of 4:14.48 and was the new world-record holder. Another memorable moment was added to Hayward Field lore.\n\n“I am a big believer in the Hayward magic,” Eaton said following the race. “At 600 meters, I knew there was no way I wasn’t going to get the record.\n\n“I love the fans, I love this field and it’s special for it to happen here. It is a very special place.”\n\nEaton went on to extend the world record to 9,045 points at the 2016 Olympics in Beijing to win his second gold medal in the decathlon. His mark now ranks No. 2 on the all-time list after Kevin Mayer of France broke the world record in 2018.\n\nEaton started his domination of the NCAA multi-event in 2008 when he won his first of three-consecutive decathlon titles in Des Moines, Iowa. He followed up with wins in 2009 and 2010 to become the first person with three-consecutive NCAA decathlon titles.\n\nHe completed the NCAA heptathlon-decathlon double in 2009 and 2010. With his 2009 national title in the heptathlon, Eaton helped the Men of Oregon win the program’s first NCAA indoor team crown.\n\nDuring his senior campaign in 2010, Eaton cemented his place as an icon of Oregon track and field. In the process of winning another NCAA heptathlon title with 6,499 points, Eaton not only broke his own collegiate record—set earlier that season—but he broke the American and world record in the event. He took down the old mark (6,476) set by Dan O’Brien in 1993.\n\nEaton extended that world record three more times before retiring in January 2017. He set the still-standing world mark of 6,645 points in winning the world indoor title in 2012.\n\nAt the 2010 Pac-10 Championships in Berkeley, Calif., Eaton put on a performance for the ages by winning three events—110m hurdles, long jump and decathlon—and finishing as runner-up at 100 meters. He became just the fifth man in conference history to win three league titles at the same meet.\n\nEaton finally got a chance to win an NCAA decathlon title on his home track and he did just that with a record-breaking performance at the 2010 NCAA Championships at Hayward Field. He broke the meet, school and conference records with a score of 8,457 points. Ten years later, Eaton still ranks as the No. 4 all-time collegiate performer in the decathlon.\n\nIn his final collegiate act, Eaton won The Bowerman following his spectacular 2010 season.\n\n- Zach Lawson, UO Athletics"
