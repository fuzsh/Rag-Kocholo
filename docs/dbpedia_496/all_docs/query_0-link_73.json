        "text": "Kung Fu FightingCarl Douglas\n\nKung Fu was big in 1974, with movies by Bruce Lee and a TV series called Kung Fu. Carl Douglas brought it to the dance floor that year with \"Kung Fu Fighting,\" a #1 hit.\n\nPiano ManBilly Joel\n\n\"Piano Man\" was inspired by Billy Joel's time playing at a piano bar in Los Angeles. The \"real estate novelist\" was a guy who always talked about writing a book, but spent all his spare time in the bar.\n\nMr. Tambourine ManBob Dylan\n\nBob Dylan's original version of \"Mr. Tambourine Man,\" released on his album Bringing It All Back Home, has no tambourine, just guitars and harmonica.\n\nThe Memory RemainsMetallica\n\nAn unexpected guest vocal: Marianne Faithfull on the Metallica song \"The Memory Remains.\" A star in the '60s, this collaboration helped revive her career.\n\nThe Most Beautiful Girl In The WorldPrince\n\nPrince released \"The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\" on his own label to prove he could generate a hit song whenever he wanted. He made his point: It was a big hit around the world.\n\nSusanna Hoffs - \"Eternal Flame\"They're Playing My Song\n\nThe Prince-penned \"Manic Monday\" was the first song The Bangles heard coming from a car radio, but \"Eternal Flame\" is closest to Susanna's heart, perhaps because she sang it in \"various states of undress.\"\n\nHistory Of RockSong Writing\n\nAn interview with Dr. John Covach, music professor at the University of Rochester whose free online courses have become wildly popular.\n\nTommy JamesSongwriter Interviews\n\n\"Mony Mony,\" \"Crimson and Clover,\" \"Draggin' The Line\"... the hits kept coming for Tommy James, and in a plot line fit for a movie, his record company was controlled by the mafia.\n\nBrian Kehew: The Man Behind The RemastersSong Writing\n\nBrian has unearthed outtakes by Fleetwood Mac, Aretha Franklin, Elvis Costello and hundreds of other artists for reissues. Here's how he does it."
