        "text": "From Facebook:\n\nA message from David Garibaldi:\n\nBrothers and Sisters of The Drum and everyone else…!!! Greetings form the west coast. Today, with great satisfaction and a feeling of deep fulfillment and humility, I'm announcing that as of January 12, 2024, my time with Tower of Power has reached its end. I always told myself and others that when it's time to leave the Million Gig March, that I would know. Well, that happened last July as we were nearing the end of our European tour. My body told me. My body told me and I listened. By the time I got home from last year’s touring on December 18, I knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that I had enough.\n\nJust so that I could be sure about how I felt, I looked back at our schedule and was amazed to see that we had been on the road for approximately 180 days…that’s 6 months. 180 days that included 110 shows and a few recording days thrown in for good measure. Into that mix went my other commitments, rehearsals and preparation for the Christmas tour and honestly, I was worn out. I also realized that I had kept my bags packed for over 20 years. It has been constant touring since I rejoined the band in February 1998. Since then, there were many years that were 150-175 shows, which can mean 200 days traveling. As we said many times, “you can’t be a ***** if you want to be in a funk band!”\n\nThe Million Gig March is global. What an incredible education that has been. You know you’ve traveled a lot when you have favorite restaurants in other countries. Truth be told, I love my TOP brothers. Everything I know about how to be in a band, I learned there. It’s been my life and my school. I’ve never wanted to be in any other band. For me, this has been a mountaintop experience. What blessing it has been.\n\nSo…what will I do? The first thing was unpacking my bags, then very soon, my wife and I are headed somewhere to get sun and relax, then I’ll come home and get after things again. There’s always lots to do. By no means am I “retired”…I’m just not on the tour bus. I’m very much looking forward to see what’s next! God bless you all and I hope to update you again soon.\n\n- DG\n\nYamaha Drums\n\nSABIAN Cymbals\n\nVic Firth\n\nRemo Inc.\n\nAudix Microphones\n\nLatin Percussion\n\nHudson Music\n\nPercussive Arts Society\n\nDan"
