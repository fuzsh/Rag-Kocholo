        "text": "WHEN Tower of Power hits the Fox Theatre in Redwood City on Sunday, fans are expected to “bump” to the music of the often mislabeled “Oakland-born-and-raised” group.\n\nNo wonder the perception exists. Some Web sites, including Epic Records’ site, declare it. The group itself doesn’t do much to dispel the myth, with albums such as 1973’s “Back to Oakland” and 2003’s “Oakland’s Own, In the Oakland Zone.”\n\nThe truth is the band got its start in Fremont, in 1964, when 14-year-old Emilio Castillo, a freshman at Irvington High School, formed a group called the Roadrunners.\n\n“I had this little band, and we were starting to learn to play music,” Castillo said in a phone interview from his Scottsdale, Ariz., residence. “We didn’t take lessons, just had this teacher come in once in awhile and help us.”\n\nThe Roadrunners consisted of Castillo’s older brother, Jack, and some friends (not the ensemble that’s today’s Tower of Power). As the music got better, the group, which often played Friday night dances at Irvington, changed its name to the Extension Five.\n\nEmilio, Jack and their friend Jody Lopez, a pal from their days at Walters Junior High who played guitar, didn’t get serious about music until they were caught shoplifting at a Mervyns, then located in the Fremont Hub.\n\n“We walked in, put on these musclemen T-shirts and walked out,” Castillo says. “We got busted immediately.”\n\nHis father went down to the store, took his sons home and told them to write down what they wanted to do in life — or they couldn’t come out of their room.\n\nIt was easy, says Castillo: “We wanted to play music.”\n\nThe elder Castillo took his sons to Allegro Music, where Jack picked out a drum set and Emilio gravitated toward the saxophone.\n\n“I always thought the coolest guy was the sax player,” Castillo says. “And that’s how the music got started. I thought if I made it to Sacramento and played at the topless bars, I’d have it made.”\n\nAlthough Castillo and his band never made it to Sacramento, they did audition at a topless bar in Sunnyvale around the time Emilio transferred to Kennedy High School. They also changed their name to Batman & Robin, but before anyone could say “Bam!” or “Kerplunk!”, the group was threatened with a lawsuit.\n\nSo Batman & Robin became the Gotham City Crime Fighters. (At the time, local groups also were dressing up as characters, such as Peter Wheat & the Breadmen, a Kennedy High band that was popular.)\n\nAt first, the Gotham City Crime Fighters were a big draw, Castillo says. “Man, we’d pack them in at the Longshoremen’s Hall and other places.”\n\nBut as the Batman series left TV screens, so did the Gotham City Crime Fighters. “As the fad faded we had become laughable,” he says.\n\nSo the group changed its name to Black Orpheus and broke into an inevitable change — soul music. Growing too old for teen parties and high school gigs, the band members’ tastes drifted toward soul, and they became even more committed to the music.\n\nBlack Orpheus played places such as Frenchy’s on Mission Boulevard in Hayward, Off-Broadway in Oakland, Lucky 13 in Albany and Little Richard’s in Fremont.\n\n“Little Richard’s was the only place you could dance after hours,” Castillo said. “After 2 a.m. you had to do a show. We’d start playing and people would come from all over the Bay Area. We were such a good dance band.”\n\nThe album “Bump City” and the 1972 song “Down to the Nightclub” are about the clubs that the band played during its evolving years. But “Down to the Nightclub” isn’t the only song favored by East Bay locales, especially Fremont.\n\n“You’re Still a Young Man,” one of the group’s biggest hits, was written in an apartment at the Parkmont Apartments in Fremont. It’s about a young man who had his heart broken by an older woman as he pleaded with her not to leave.\n\n“I was 18 and she was 26,” Castillo says. “She ended up going back to her boyfriend, and I was devastated.”\n\nDuring the breakup, the woman told him he was too young to love and that he was wasting his time with her. He says, “But like the song, I told her I can love, that I’m not too young.”\n\nMost of the songs on the album “East Bay Grease” were written by Castillo and Stephen “Doc” Krupka in the Parkmont apartment. Their first Bay Area hit, “Sparkling in the Sand,” was co-written by Castillo and Lopez, the former guitar player from Irvington High.\n\nAlthough Castillo has been involved with the band for 37 years, he seldom makes it back to Fremont these days. “It’s too big and confusing,” he says.\n\nHe still has family and friends in the East Bay, though, including his younger brother, Mario, a fireman with the Oakland fire department, his former bandmate Jack, who lives in Alamo, and his two oldest daughters from his first marriage.\n\nCastillo says Starbucks has expressed an interest in releasing a CD of Tower of Power’s hits, but if that happens, it wouldn’t be until next year. Meanwhile, the group is thinking of recording more original music, but hasn’t made any specific decisions.\n\nCastillo plans to continue with the “Bump City” music until he drops. He says, “If I could be like Ray Charles or B.B. King, that would be great.”"
