        "text": "\"I felt like I was five feet off the ground for even four days afterwards.\"\n\nEmilio Castillo is sitting on the sofa of his Scottsdale home as recalls the joy he felt playing a concert to honor the 50th anniversary of Tower of Power, a horn-driven funk group whose hits include '70s soul ballads \"You're Still a Young Man\" and \"So Very Hard to Go\" and the more uptempo funk of \"Don't Change Horses (In the Middle of a Stream).\"\n\n\"Oh, it was extremely exciting,\" the bandleader says of the anniversary concert, which was staged last year in Oakland, California. \"We had a lot of past members. And we added some extra background vocalists and strings. It was completely off the chart.\"\n\nThey also honored the occasion with \"Soul Side of Town,\" their first release in nine years, which they plan to follow in the new year with a second album captured at those same recording sessions.\n\nAs they were approaching the anniversary, Castillo, who plays saxophone and sings, recalls, a manager suggested that they \"do the Michael Jackson method,\" cutting way more songs than needed and choosing the 12 that came out best.\n\n\"That was our plan,\" he says. \"But then they all came out great. We wound up cutting 28 songs. And the record company – we have a new record company, Mack Avenue – they loved it all and they wanted to put it all out. We said 'No, let's just do one at a time.'\"\n\nSo they released \"Soul Side of Town\" in June 2018, and \"Step Up\" is currently scheduled for a March release. \"But, of course, with record companies that could change,\" Castillo says.\n\nIt's not easy for Tower of Power to record\n\nGetting back in the studio and recording new music was fun, he says.\n\n\"You know, we're slow. We got 10 guys. We live all over the nation. It's a logistical nightmare just to get together. Plus we gig all the time. We’re out 200 days a year.\"\n\nThey got it done, though, bringing Joe Vannelli in to co-produce the sessions with Castillo after he suggested dropping by to cut a couple of tracks.\n\n\"I tried working with him,\" Castillo says. \"And it was just phenomenal. He's just a really great musician, great producer, super creative guy, good engineer. We cut a couple tracks. It went well. I did three more. And pretty soon, I realized that the thing was too big for me, and I asked Joe to help me finish it. That proved to be a really smart decision, because he's just incredible.\"\n\nAs to what kind of record they wanted to make, Castillo says, \"We don't really do themes or reinvent ourselves. We learned a long time ago that we have to stay true to ourselves. Because no matter what we do, we always come off sounding like Tower of Power. So we write original songs. We try to push the envelope musically, try different things, take chances. But as far as the concept it's always just Tower of Power, original soul music.\"\n\nFrom the Motowns to TOP\n\nCastillo was a teenager when he got into soul music and assembled the group that evolved into Tower of Power.\n\n\"I was about 16,\" he says. \"And my mother says, 'You know, if you're going to be a soul band, you should call yourselves the Motowns because you and your brother are from Detroit.' My brother was the drummer at the time.\"\n\nAbout a year and a half after forming the Motowns, he met the fellow saxophonist he's been writing songs with ever since, Stephen \"Doc\" Kupka.\n\n\"He was the first hippie I ever met,\" Castillo says.\n\nThe year was 1968 and the Motowns were hoping to land a gig at Bill Graham's Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco.\n\n\"The Fillmore was what was happening,\" Castillo says. \"And we knew we weren't gonna get in there with a bunch of suits and a name like the Motowns. So we chose the name Tower of Power.\"\n\nThey still weren't like the other Fillmore bands of 1968.\n\n\"The Fillmore was all psychedelic bands,\" Castillo says. \"You know, guitars – a keyboard here and there, but mostly guitars, bass and drums.\"\n\nOn the night they auditioned, a Tuesday, Tower of Power took the Fillmore stage following four such guitars.\n\n\"They were all the same, you know,\" he says. \"They played in the key of E, A and D and they had three guitars and drums. The crowd was tired. And here we come walking out. We’ve got five horns, we've got a black singer, we're all wearing these clothes that are just really funky, you know. And they just sort of turned around and started walking out. So we hit with this James Brown tune called 'Open the Door,' instrumental style.\"\n\nCastillo sings the song's opening riff.\n\n\"And it was like somebody said ‘About Face,’ man,\" he recalls, with a laugh. \"Everybody just turned around and started walking back, you know. And we're about halfway through that tune and I saw a head stick out of the back. There was this door by the snack bar. And that was Bill Graham. He always dug horns, and he always dug rhythm. And we had that in spades, you know.\"\n\nWhen Bill Graham digs your sound, you move\n\nHis parents had moved back to Detroit by then and after that Fillmore gig, Castillo followed.\n\n\"I wasn't gonna come back,\" he says, \"because we were just broke. And my partner Doc called and he said, ‘You gotta come back, man. He dug it.’ I go, ‘Who dug it?’ He goes, ‘Bill Graham. He wants to sign us.' I said, ‘Hock the organ and send me a ticket.’ I had a little organ that I didn't like. And I flew back. We signed four deals with him. We had a record deal, a publishing deal, a writing deal, a management deal and a booking agent deal. San Francisco Records.\"\n\nGraham's label released the first Tower of Power album, \"East Bay Grease,\" in 1970, an album he recalls as being \"cut real fast\" and \"mixed real quick.\"\n\nBy that point, they'd already found their sound.\n\n\"We had our sound even before I met Doc,\" Castillo says. \"I always approach rhythm differently. I was always making weird rhythms and weird basslines to go with that, and certain guitar rhythms to go in and out of the bass and drums, creating a sort of rhythmic fabric. I always came up with different sorts of background vocals, even when we were doing cover versions, you know. I changed them around. So looking back, I know that we had our own sound really early on. But then once you record and you do a couple of records, you start to realize that, oh, I have this certain bag of tricks, this certain group of tools that I use in making my music and then you kind of just polish the diamond at that point. You keep using those tools and then, it's like, you’re two records in and go, Oh, yeah, this is who I am.\"\n\nCastillo recalls the first time he heard one of his recordings on the radio.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" he says. \"I remember, we used to throw our mattresses on the floor back then. I'm asleep in the morning and there's a little radio next to me, which I kept on. We always just listened to KSAN radio, the big FM station. And all of a sudden, I heard a flute. And it was this ballad that we had done on 'East Bay Grease' called ‘Sparkling in the Sand.’ I couldn't believe it, you know. I’m looking at the little radio, and I'm banging on the wall because Doc was on the other side of the wall in the other bedroom. I go ‘They're playing it! They're playing it.’ It was just really exhilarating. And to be honest, it's still exhilarating today, every time I hear my stuff on the radio.\n\nA revolving door of lead singers\n\nBy 1973, when their third album, \"Tower of Power,\" hit the streets, they'd gone from Rufus Miller on lead vocals for their first release to Rick Stevens on lead vocals for \"Bump City\" to a third lead singer, Lenny Williams.\n\n\"It was scary,\" Castillo recalls of the revolving door behind the center mic. \"Not many bands can have a lead singer and lose him and still keep going and actually thrive, you know. Now, people come and go, and I'm just like, 'OK, now we got the next chapter, you know, the new excitement.' Plus our fans nowadays, when we make a change, they're like, ‘Let's go see who the new person is,’ because they know we always get good people.\"\n\nAs he recalls the initial reaction to lineup changes in the '70s, \"People at first, you know, they shouted out ‘Where's Rufus? We want Rufus!' And then Rick started bringing it, and pretty soon they weren't shouting, ‘Where's Rufus?’ Then we got Lenny Williams, and they're going ‘Where's Rick?’ You know. And as soon as Lenny started singing, there was no more ‘Where's Rick?’\"\n\nNo fewer than 60 musicians have toured or recorded with Tower of Power through the years, with Castillo and Kupka as the two remaining constants. Current drummer David Garibaldi has had four tours of duty in the band, going back to their first album. Bassist Rocco Prestia, who also played on the first, came in off the road last year for health reasons.\n\nLife with the Funky Doctor\n\n\"Doc is the only one that’s been with me the whole time,\" Castillo says. \"He always tells people ‘Other than a few days here and there where I was let go for bad behavior.’\"\n\nCastillo laughs.\n\n\"Doc is a quirky guy,\" he says. \"He’s really soulful, very unique. He’s the personality of the band. And he's my best friend. As best friends, we've sort of learned to navigate our relationship through the years to where now we just value it. I mean, I'll walk into a room where the guys are all eating and I just naturally go sit by Doc, you know? Whatever it is, if we get on the tour bus, I always sit by Doc. We're comfortable that way.\"\n\nThere have been times when that relationship was strained.\n\n\"We had our drug problems and alcohol problems in the first 20 years of our career,\" Castillo says. \"I got sober in '88. And Doc didn't want to get sober. When he shares his story now, he says, ‘I’m glad Emilio’s here because he made my life a living hell the last year that I used.’ We’ve both been sober now for over 30 years. And, you know, it was hard. Those things are hard. And not only that, but you know, the career going up and down.\"\n\nThey've stayed together through those ups and downs, Castillo says, \"because we don't do it for the money or the success. I mean, I love money. And I want to be successful. But I do it because I love it. It's what I do. It's who I am, this kind of music. And Doc is the same way. We just sort of have that creative connection. We see things the same way. That doesn't mean we agree all the time. But we have the same way of looking at things. And it's from a soulful approach.\"\n\nGetting sober helped, of course.\n\n\"Had it not been for getting sober,\" he says, \"I don't think I'd be the leader that I am, the musician that I am, the writer that I am, the producer that I am, none of those things would be as good. And for that matter, you know, I’m fairly sure I'd be dead.\"\n\nHow Emilio Castillo came to Scottsdale\n\nThe quest for sobriety took Castillo from his home in the Bay Area to LA. An earthquake made him move again — this time to Scottsdale, where he's lived since 1994.\n\n\"At the time,\" he recalls, \"I was married to this lady named Suzanne and she was pregnant with our first child. She was in the Northridge earthquake and I was in Florida. I remember, I flew home that night, and even the aftershocks were scaring me. I can't even imagine what she went through. She was traumatized.\"\n\nA short time later, he came home to find her crying.\n\n\"I'm like, 'What's going on?,'\" he says. \"And she said, 'I have to resume my plan.' When I met her, she was moving to Scottsdale. And she said, 'I know I have no right to ask you to go because your business is in LA, but I gotta go.' 'I was like, 'What are you, nuts?' I go, 'What do I do in LA? I just go to the airport. I think they got one in Phoenix.' Within a month, we were living in Scottsdale.\"\n\nHe loves it here, Castillo says.\n\n\"I mean, I love it,\" he says. \"You know, I made the best of LA, I'm not an LA guy. I'm a Bay Area guy. But I wound up going to LA to try to run away from my addiction. And I made the best of it while I was down there, It didn't bother me living there. But now I go back and I think how did they ever do it? God said, No, you're going over here, you know. And here I am in Scottsdale. It was providence.\"\n\nAs to how they manage to work on music while they're all spread across the country, Castillo says, \"We usually work things up at soundcheck. But when we had our 50th, the guys from Tony, Toni, Tone gave us a rehearsal spot in Oakland. And I just prepared everything ahead of time. We rehearsed with the rhythm section and the horns for three days. Then I brought in the strings. And I went a couple of days early and worked with the two background singers. When we have to do something really important, we'll say, 'Okay, let's get a place.' We did some rehearsing in Sacramento after the album came out so we could learn some of the songs six days, eight hours a day.\"\n\nThe world-famous horns\n\nIn addition to touring as Tower of Power, Castillo has carved out a lucrative side gig as leader of Tower of Power Horns, a spin-off unit featuring the band's five-piece brass section.\n\n\"That was kind of a fluke,\" he says. \"Early on, we got a call from Nick Gravenites, who was the singer for Big Brother and the Holding Company and did a lot of work with Mike Bloomfield. We were playing a lot of gigs with those guys. He called us in the middle of the night. He says, 'Hey, man, what are you doing?' You know, it’s like, two in the morning. I was like, ‘Just hanging out.'’ He goes I got this song.\"\n\nSo he went in and laid some horns down on a song called \"Funkie Jim\" and was surprised to be handed money \"for your trouble\" as he left the studio.\n\nIt wasn’t even a month later, Carlos Santana called.\n\n\"Same thing, middle of the night,\" Castillo says. \"He goes. ‘We're over here at Columbia Studios. And we got a song we think it would sound good with horns.\"\n\nIt was a song called \"Everybody's Everything\" on \"Santana III.\"\n\n\"Before we knew it, we started getting all these calls because when Santana's record came out, he was really hot. I mean, he was at the top of the world career wise and all of a sudden they heard Santana with horns and they were going, ‘What is that?' And all the DJs were saying, 'That's Tower of Power horns on Santana's new record.' It just made a big splash and we just started getting calls. You know, Elton john, just all these people started calling and we realized, 'Oh, we can have, like, this thing. We go for three hours in the afternoon and we leave and they pay us really good money.\"\n\nAsked if any of those jobs stand out, he says, \"Well, we played live with the Rolling Stones at Candlestick Park. That was really great. We toured with Huey Lewis and the News. We played the horns on 'When Something Is Wrong with My Baby' for Aaron Neville and Linda Ronstadt. Elton John 'Caribou' was super huge. All the work we did with Little Feat. That's the one I hear the most about — Little Feat, 'Waiting for Columbus.' We did all their albums previous to that as well. But that was a live record, a really astounding record. We just did a lot of great work.\"\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.
