He would slay that gig. Nate Smith is another one who would absolutely crush it (or just about anything, for that matter) and he definitely loves ToP, but I don't think he'd want to put his own band, Kinfolk, on the back burner to make it happen. Adam Deitch would slay it, as well, but I don't think he'd leave Lettuce to make it work.

I would look more for a Russ McKinnon as he was in the band, knows the music and is still friends with the guys. Those other drummers are all great but Tower will look for someone they can get along with the other 22 hours they are not on stage. Also, its a business. Tower i would imagine does not pay a whole lot.\n\nWell Gents, as i mentioned previously, the next drummer for Tower would not be a big name for numerous reasons. While i would love to see anyone of your suggestions on big names come true, its just not going to happen. The first few dates were filled in by Herman Matthews. Recently a drummer named Peter Antunes has been on the kit. Maybe they bring back Russ McKinnon? Maybe Rocky Bryant wants the gig once The Average White Band retires this year? Not sure. But one things for sure....those big names are most likely not coming. Sorry guys."
