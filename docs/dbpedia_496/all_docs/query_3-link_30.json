        "text": "Oakland’s finest soul band, Tower of Power, has announced a winter tour for 2023 to celebrate the band’s 55th anniversary. The band is still led by Emilio Castillo, who founded the group in 1968 with his brother Jack Castillo, Stephen “Doc” Kupka, and bassist Francis “Rocco” Prestia.\n\n“WOW, 55 years!! Tower of Power is heading coast to coast in 2023 to celebrate 55 years of being a band,” bandleader Emilio Castillo exclaimed. “I can remember back in the day dreaming about getting all the way to Sacramento [from Oakland]. To say the least, we’ve far exceeded our wildest dreams. An eternal thank you to our fans for keeping the spirit of Tower of Power alive for all these years. Looking forward to seeing you in 2023 for a proper SOUL VACCINATION!”\n\nMarc Van Wageningen has been ToP’s bassist for the past few years, even before Prestia’s passing in 2020. He’ll be tearing up songs like “What Is Hip” and “You’re Still A Young Man” as the tour heads from California all the way to New Hampshire and points in between. They’ll even have a short residency at the Blue Note in Honolulu, Hawaii in May.\n\nTower of Power 2023 55th Anniversary Tour Dates:"
