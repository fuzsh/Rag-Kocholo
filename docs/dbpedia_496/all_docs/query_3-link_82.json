        "text": "Regrettably, we can now confirm that the previously postponed Tower of Power (Wednesday 16 November 2022) show at The London Palladium has been cancelled.\n\nThe band says, “Despite their best efforts, our live team has been unable to find a new date for us to play in London and so regrettably our postponed show at The London Palladium now has to be cancelled outright. We are very grateful for the many years of support from our fans and we will be back as soon as we can to make it up to you. Everyone will be refunded from their point of purchase.”\n\nWe apologise for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nLW Theatres\n\nFor over 50 years, Tower of Power have been creating their own kind of soul and funk music. Since 1968, Tower of Power has delivered their unique brand of music to their fans, appearing before sold out crowds as they tour the world each year. Tower’s sound can be hard to categorize, but the band’s leader and founding member, Emilio Castillo, has labeled their sound as “Urban Soul Music.”\n\nTower’s rhythm section lays down a groove like no other band. The band’s horn driven sound is unique, and the way they approach everything, from writing and arranging to mixing and performing, is totally their own. Combine all of that with an outstanding lead vocalist and you have one of the most dynamic groups of musicians to ever hit the stage."
