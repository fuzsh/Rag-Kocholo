        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio - It’s been a couple years of celebrating “50 Years of Funk & Soul” for Tower of Power.\n\nThe brass-fueled group formed during 1968 in Oakland, Calif., and released its first album during 1970. The intervening years have seen a lot of music (18 studio albums, including last year’s “Step Up”) and more than five dozen members pass through its ranks. ToP’s esteemed horn section, meanwhile, has played with Huey Lewis & the News, Elton John, Aerosmith, Bonnie Raitt, Little Feat, Santana, Paula Adbul, Heart and a slew of others.\n\nDuring June of 2018 it welcomed back several of its alumni, including “Saturday Night Live” band leader Lenny Pickett, for a concert at the Fox Theater in Oakland. That was filmed for a recently released live album -- which debuted at No. 2 on Billboard’s Jazz Contemporary chart and No. 3 on the Jazz survey -- and video, which has also been airing on PBS. The current incarnation of the group is, like so many others, in pandemic dry-dock, but founder and saxophonist Emilio Castillo, 70 and at home in Arizona, is always happy to blow ToP’s horn...\n\nDoes it feel like it’s been 52 years or 52 minutes?\n\nCastillo: Well, it doesn’t feel like 52 years, but it doesn’t feel like 52 minutes, either. It’s amazing to me; I’m 70 years old but I tell people it’s like I’m an 18-year-old in my brain. Music sort of keeps you with a young heart, and it’s been a great ride. When I reflect on it I’m amazed, but I’m so in motion doing what I do all the time it just kind of feels like I’m still doing the same thing over and over. It’s a little heightened because everybody is making reference to the milestone, but it’s still business as usual.\n\nWhat do you think accounts for the longevity?\n\nCastillo: A lot of people refer to us as a musician’s band, and I’m very proud of that legacy. We’ve never really been a chart-topper, but there’s a high standard for the music that’s never really changed. We actually are one of the bands that did it full-time the whole time. We never took any time off. Some years we didn’t have a record deal but we were still playing live all the time -- and regularly, too. We never had to take a day gig or anything.\n\nHow did you develop the Tower of Power sound develop?\n\nCastillo: We just approached music a little differently than everyone else, who would hit it on the 2 and 4 (beats). It’s soul music, but it’s an original style of soul music. We have our own particular signature. We mess with the rhythms a lot and create this rhythm section fabric that’s very unique compared to other artists. And then we always have a real premiere lead singer and some unique songwriting, great background vocals, some pretty decent production -- that’s what makes Tower of Power. Doc’s (baritone saxophonist Stephen Kupka) a quirky personality, so we had quirky lyrics to go with ‘em. No matter what we do, we keep sounding like Tower of Power -- it’s a curse! (laughs)\n\nThere are surely many, but what have some of the highlights been over the years?\n\nCastillo: The one that I talk about the most is when we opened for Aretha Franklin when she recorded her “Live at Fillmore West album (March 5-7, 1971)” there all weekend. At the time we were in a legal dispute with Bill (Graham); We were fighting, but to show you what a classy guy he was, he knew we were the best act to open for her, so he put us on the bill all weekend. It was really a big event, the place was packed, everybody wanted to be in the dressing room. I was standing by the door to the stage and Aretha came walking toward me with a really tight white dress and a turban; I had to turn sideways so she could wedge through the door, and we were nose to nose and she said to me, “Tower of Power. My favorite band.” That was one of the highlights of my life ‘cause I’ve idolized her forever.\n\nYou’ve acknowledged that this hasn’t been a consistently chart-topping band. Do you mind that?\n\nCastillo: I remember doubtful times in my career when we were like, I’m sure there are a lot, but what have some of the highlights been over the years? Why don’t we sell like other bands?’ We didn’t ring the bell like Michael Jackson or Huey Lewis?” We hit the Top 20, a couple songs hit the Top 10, but nowhere near No. 1. Yet here we are 50 years later. People are really interested in talking about the band, and they say all these great things. So now I just realize it’s a blessing we have our own sound and people like and appreciate it.\n\nYou’ve mitigated that by being guns for hire, especially the horn section. How do you view that aspect of the group’s legacy?\n\nCastillo: It was kind of an accident. Nick Gravenites from Big Brother and the Holding Company called us in the middle of the night saying, “We’re recording in San Francisco and got this tune. It would be cool if your horns were on it.” So we go over there, make up some parts and he loved it. We just thought it was for fun, but when we’re walking out he gave everybody some money, and we were like, “Oh...” The world got about that and once again in the middle of the night Carlos Santana called and said the same thing and we went and played and as we walked out the gave us a lot of money and we were like, “Wow, this is cool...” And within a week that song was on the radio and we started to get more calls from record producers and artists and it just became something we did.\n\nTower of Power became particularly tight, and even synonymous, with Huey Lewis & the News during the 80s. How did that association happen?\n\nCastillo: We were fans of those guys before they even formed their band, when (Lewis and Sean Hopper) were in another band called Clover, and we got to know those guys just from being around town... Later on we were doing a session at CBS and Huey came in and said, “We’re in a studio down the hall and have this song we thought you’d be great on,” and we did and we started doing stuff with them in the studio and when (“Sports”) came out he came to me and said, “I’m wondering if you guys would consider going on the road with us?” I said, “I got the band” but he said, “Yeah, I know, but we’ll give you a lot of money” and blah, blah, blah. I told Huey, “If you promise me you’ll help promote the band at every turn, we’ll do it,” and he was true to his word. Huey really saved our career, and I’m eternally grateful.\n\nThe 50th anniversary concert was quite a moment. How was it for you?\n\nCastillo: “Phenomenal -- not just on a musical level. Just from friendship and personality, it’s so enjoyable. We love these guys and they love us, and it’s kind of that way with all our alumni. There’s just a lit if laughing, and then when we play it’s like you finish the first tune and everyone’s like, ‘Wow! Yeah!!’ So it’s wonderful, and then you get to be on stage and follow through with everything you worked on. It’s a great sense of accomplishment.\n\nWhat are “alumni relations” like, with as many members have been through the band over the years?\n\nCastillo: Y’know, I’m a believer, so I just think God’s got a lot do with that. And I changed the way I live in 1988, cleaned up my act. Doc did a year later. Because of that I was just very careful to protect our reputation and to build and continue to nurture great relationships. Even before that I wasn’t on the outs with a bunch of people. There have been a couple little instances here and there, but for the most part every one of the guys from our past I can call up any day and have great conversations.\n\nWhat have you been doing during this enforced “time off?”"
