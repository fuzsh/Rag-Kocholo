        "text": "A renowned horn-driven outfit, Tower of Power emerged in the late '60s playing a dynamic blend of R&B, soul, funk, and AM pop. Along with the similarly inclined Chicago and Blood, Sweat & Tears, Tower of Power helped push the sound of brass-infused music into the rock era. Led by Detroit-born tenor saxophonist Emilio Castillo, the Oakland-based group scored hits like \"You're Still a Young Man\" and \"What Is Hip?\" throughout the '70s. They also became one of the most sought-after backing ensembles in pop, playing on recordings by Elton John, Santana, Bonnie Raitt, Aerosmith, Josh Groban, and more. While their lineup has changed over the years, Castillo remains a constant and continues to guide the ensemble live and in the studio.\n\nLocated in the Brown County Music Center\n\n200 Maple Leaf Boulevard\n\nNashville, Indiana 47448\n\nboxoffice@browncountymusiccenter.com\n\n(812) 988-5323 ext. 1\n\nThe Brown County Music Center Box Office is currently open for in-person sales via outdoor ticketing windows:\n\nTuesdays through Fridays 10 am to 5 pm, (on event days, box office will close 30 minutes after headliner begins)\n\nSaturdays through Mondays open only event days (3 pm until 30 minutes after headliner begins)\n\n*Hours may differ during inclement weather events and holiday weeks, please check our social media pages for updated hours surrounding holidays and weather.\n\nTickets can be purchased anytime on our website and at Ticketmaster.com.
