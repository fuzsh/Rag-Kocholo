        "text": "55th Anniversary Tour\n\nFor more than 55 years, Tower of Power has delivered the best in funk and soul music. Tower’s window-rattling grooves and raucous party spirit has been a balm for the soul throughout their half-century existence, but the release of 50 Years of Funk & Soul: Live at the Fox Theater couldn’t arrive at a better time.\n\n“We started as a soul band called The Motowns,” recalls the band’s founder, Emilio Castillo. “Rocco was the bass player, I was there, and my brother was the drummer. I met Doc Kupka back in 1968, and gave him an audition. He joined the band, and we eventually changed our name to the Tower of Power.”\n\nThe band has long since surpassed Castillo’s modest aspirations, traveling the world, enjoying hit singles, and backing legendary artists like Otis Redding, Elton John, Santana, the Grateful Dead, John Lee Hooker, Aerosmith, Bonnie Raitt, and countless others. In the process they’ve defined the sound of “Oakland soul.” With their rich history and legendary music, Tower of Power’s future is looking bright and dynamic – giving their fans plenty more historic grooves and performances to look forward to.\n\nGenesee County residents receive 30% off – discount applied at checkout."
