        "text": "Tower of Power still packs the house,and rocks.I can't believe that a band with this much history,and influence still is not in the HOF.I have visited the HOF,and like how it reflects the history of rock, from the blues,Elvis,etc. TOP is NOT a regional band from Oakland,they are worldwide known.The time has come to truly recognize there contribution to so many musicians,and the the world.\n\nPosted by Ernie Franchino on Wednesday, 05/1/2013 @ 16:59pm\n\nKind of hard to believe that the Tower of Power has not been considered for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ? There isn't band today that can match musicianship and pure energy since the great James Brown Bands. It's a shame to see another induction because to be honest,. most of the acts are Bush League,.. Just think, when if they are ever inducted,. there will be a few present inductees that can actually be on stage with the great Tower of Power.\n\nPosted by Manuel Moreno on Saturday, 06/28/2014 @ 13:45pm\n\nTower still tours to sold out venues around the world, Their horns have alwaqys been the best and their band is the tightest. Reaaly some of the last grou[s that play their own music.We've been fo;;owing them since at keast 1977, and still try to see them whenever they are in townI love that when you hear their music it's identifiable how could you not induct them. Long overdue.\n\nPosted by Donna Howell on Friday, 08/5/2016 @ 02:52am\n\nThe Tower of Power has the greatest brass section in funk and R&B\n\nHANDS DOWN!! I am shocked that they are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They were and still are one of the \"Hippest\" bands ever! Please consider them.\n\nPosted by victoria mason on Friday, 05/5/2017 @ 17:47pm\n\nThe fact that there have been many inducted that have no business being in the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame proves the whole process is an embarrassing joke. As well others that haven't been inducted that should have been proves my point. I guess money is more important than influence\n\nPosted by George on Monday, 07/30/2018 @ 09:50am\n\nHow can the legendary band of \"You're Still a Young Man\", \" What is Hip\" and the most recent \"Soul Side of Town\" not be in the hall. Masterful musicians, from horns to organ to guitars, especially bassist Rocco to the best drummer in the world....David Galabaldi.\n\nPosted by dave mitchinson on Wednesday, 10/17/2018 @ 16:32pm\n\nTOP is the greatest band ever in my opinion! It would have been nice if they were inducted in the HOF this year. Their 50th Anniversary!! What's the hold up? They are more deserving than some of the recent members! HOF please get it together soon! I'll be watching and waiting!!!!!!\n\nPosted by JOSEPH HARRIS on Saturday, 12/15/2018 @ 08:45am\n\nThere are some major prejudices going on to not even consider TOP for the HoF. Whoever does the voting or controls the voting obviously has some hate or discrimination against Tower’! Is it because they’re from Oakland? I’m sure there are other bands around the country, the world that haven’t been considered either! Maybe it’s time to get some new blood doing the voting or maybe have the people do the voting too! It’s a travesty! TOWER OF POWER, your our HALL OF FAME band in the hearts of fans all over the world!\n\nPosted by Frank on Wednesday, 05/1/2019 @ 17:51pm\n\nThe Tower of Power has been playing their own brand of Funk music since 1968. They are still performing all over the world and producing new music to a new generation of fans, if that is not considered influence, than please tell me what is. They have long been considered the industries most sought after horn sections, performing on a list of artist albums as well as their live performances. The list is far to extensive to include here. Past members of the band have gone on to create their own brand of Bay Area funk and success. This sound originating from Oakland California and has vibrated it's soul influence all over the world for 50+ years. It is time that your committee recognizes what founding members Emilio Castillo and Stephen Kupka, along with all TOP members throughout the years, have brought to the music industry and their millions of fans.\n\nPosted by Rudy Castellanos on Tuesday, 07/16/2019 @ 12:49pm\n\nIt is a travesty. Tower of Power has been sited by so many artist as an influence. They have had legitimate radio hits. That continue to perform world-wide.When you see other boutique artist who are influential but have very little radio or mass public recognition get the nod and Tower not even get a whiff the Halls credibility is suspect. Only time will tell.\n\nPosted by Russell Hamilton on Saturday, 01/18/2020 @ 12:40pm\n\nBeen a fan throughout their whole existence as a band. Everything they do is RIVITING! T.O.P is without question one of the best BANDS to ever grace a stage. That they are not in the H.O.F. yet is a travesty of justice. THERE IS NO BAND MORE DESERVING. Please induct them while they're still with us. Please! This honor is long overdue. Listen to the people! T.O.P! T.O.P! T.O.P! T.O.P! T.O.P!\n\nPosted by Paul Medley on Friday, 06/26/2020 @ 22:07pm\n\nI can't believe Tower of Power isn't in the Hall of Fame. It reduces the level of respect I have for this organization when bands so deserving as TOP aren't on the list. One of the greatest and iconic bands in history should DEFINITELY be in there.\n\nPosted by Rob Holbert on Thursday, 10/15/2020 @ 15:01pm\n\nDavid Garibaldi has always been listed as one of the greatest drummers of our generation, and Rocco well, simply said, he was in a class all by himself. TOP helped to shape our influence as we continue our love of music since their beginning, rock, R&B, Funk was big part of our lives and Tower Of Power was right there driving the bus. Why they are not in the Rock & Roll Hall is truly a travesty to say the least.\n\nPosted by Fred G Comeau on Monday, 12/7/2020 @ 17:25pm\n\nThe RRHOS is an ABSOLUTE JOKE!!!! The Cure over Pat Benetar? WTF is that? Tower will NEVER get into the Rock and Roll Hall of SHAME. Tower absolutely 100% deserves to be inducted. If for nothing else, strictly on the merit of influencing practically every major artist over the last 50 years. Sting, Prince, Metallica, Megadeath, Chilli Peppers. They are a pro musicians band and their sound cannot be denied. You might not hear it in those artists music but they credit some member of Tower, some piece of Tower for making them the musician they are today.\n\nPosted by Jason Schoeller on Monday, 02/15/2021 @ 14:35pm\n\nthis is the musicians choice of greatest live band music ever. all star drummer david garibaldi , all star bassist rocco. mimi and doc, plus legendary horn players like lenny pickett . head of snl band,mic gillette and greg adam's. and my favorite b3 player of all time , the great chester thompson. what's wrong with you people ! i thought you are supposed to know something about music .\n\nPosted by bobby katz on Tuesday, 05/4/2021 @ 01:39am\n\nWhat hasn't been said already!? TOP deserves to be in HOF! Regardless if they make it or not, the only ones that count are the millions of TOP fans who know how great they are. I feel there are a lot of people who don't like TOP because where they're from. A terribly sad excuse and I hope I'm wrong about that. TOWER OF POWER FOREVER, BABY!!!\n\nPosted by Franklin Caspino on Thursday, 05/6/2021 @ 18:03pm\n\nIt is way past time for these influential group of musicians to be in the Hall. Their horn section has played with Elton John, Santana, Bonnie Raitt, Paula Abdul and Aerosmith, among many others. Obviously some of the best musicians of all time (and Hall members), feel they are talented enough to be invited to play on their albums. Why does the Hall not feel that they are talented enough to be nominated? Absolutely ridiculous, their career has spanned 50 years. Time for someone to do the right thing.\n\nPosted by Teresa on Thursday, 07/29/2021 @ 13:56pm\n\nTower of Power (TOP) is such an amazing band. Their horn section is second to none - NONE, not even Chicago. While I love Chicago, TOP deserves their props while members of the band are still alive and can have the induction experience. TOP deserves to have that legacy more so than some of the less talented, but more commercial popular and/or monetarily successful bands that have been inducted. Please, PLEASE, Please (doing a James Brown, just not on my knees) tell me who I have to write to, sleep with (lol), etc. to make this happen ASAP.\n\nPosted by J. Evans on Sunday, 12/12/2021 @ 12:56pm\n\nIt's a shame groups like Tower of Power and War are not in the hof what'sWrong with you people who are supposed to be experts on groups of musicians Tower of power and war have been selling out crowds for 50 years you people are nuts and I have no respect for the Hall of Fame of rock 'n' roll\n\nPosted by Paul Gigliello on Saturday, 05/14/2022 @ 00:40am\n\nThis band actually came out of Fremont CA. They were called The Extention five first then the Gotham city crime fighters, t h e motown AND THEN, Tower of power. One of my best friends in the world (Rocco prestia) played for them. He was my true brother up until his death. God love you Frank(Rocco)... Phil weirick\n\nPosted by Philip weirick on Tuesday, 09/13/2022 @ 00:14am\n\nJust saw Tower of Power again for the 11th or 12th time in my life and as always, so powerful in their sound and song! I will continue to attend their concerts and was surprised they are not \"in\" since their first album was end of the 60's into the 70's and still a great, solid, band...their members are all good guys tried and true...wish they would get in! Lots of fans out there would agree!!!!\n\nPosted by Denise Brownstein on Sunday, 11/6/2022 @ 01:26am\n\nFlood the message box at the rock hall of fame. They belong. They have put some mutts in in recent years and they skip over TOP! Give me a break. Put them in this year !!! Write to the hall now.\n\nPosted by Sal consiglio on Sunday, 07/16/2023 @ 14:57pm\n\nIf you follow the history of Tower of Power it just amazes me how Emilio Castillio and Doc Kuptka were able to keep such a tight band together for over 55 yrs. With new muscians in and out since 1968 the quality and tightness of this band is just incredible. Just go to one of their concerts and you will see what I am talking about. These musician have played and did arrangements for bands that were already inducted. Come on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, wake up.\n\nPosted by Raymond Kasunick on Saturday, 11/4/2023 @ 12:39pm\n\nTower of Power has performed for 56 years, led by Emilio Castillo and Doc Kupka and drummer Dave Garibaldi. They have played with countless performers and made major contributions to Huey Lewis and the News. Please consider them for this years Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Thank you.\n\nPosted by Raúl Pena on Monday, 01/1/2024 @ 23:36pm"
