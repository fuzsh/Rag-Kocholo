To honor the achievement, the band has announced over 30 additional tour dates across the United States to conclude the anniversary celebration this year. The second half of this momentous event will commence on Aug. 10 and extend until Dec. 17, encompassing various destinations from the far Pacific Northwest to the Deep South.\n\nReflecting on their remarkable journey, Emilio Castillo, the founder and bandleader of Tower of Power, shared, “55 years have flown by in the blink of an eye, and this year has been extraordinary. From a captivating late-night performance at the Jazz Fest in New Orleans alongside the Symphony to mesmerizing crowds at festivals and clubs throughout the UK and Europe, we are thrilled to share this special moment with our fans worldwide, particularly during the holiday season. Here’s to 55 more years!”\n\nCurrently amidst a sold-out European tour, the band will return to the United States for a series of performances in select markets. Notable stops include Providence, R.I., and Kansas City, Mo., where the local symphony will accompany the band. Additionally, Tower of Power will headline a momentous hometown show at Oakland, Calif.’s beloved Fox Theater in December.\n\nWhile the August, September, October, and part of November performances will showcase traditional Tower of Power shows, from Thanksgiving onwards fans can expect a holiday twist. Titled Holidays & Hits, these shows will blend the band’s beloved chart-topping hits with a sprinkling of beloved holiday classics.\n\nIn addition to standard admission tickets, Tower of Power is offering a limited quantity of VIP access for most shows on the newly announced tour. The VIP experience includes preferred seating, a Tower of Power bomber jacket, a collectible VIP laminate, Tower of Power pins, and a commemorative VIP ticket.\n\nLearn more and find tickets to Tower of Power’s 55th-anniversary tour here.\n\nAugust 10 – Layton, UT\n\nAugust 11 – Denver, CO\n\nAugust 12 – Telluride, CO\n\nAugust 17 – Oshkosh, WI\n\nAugust 18 – Madison, IN\n\nAugust 19 – Stockbridge, GA\n\nSeptember 15 – Long Beach, CA\n\nSeptember 29 – Hutchinson, KS\n\nSeptember 30 – Kansas City, MO*\n\nOctober 1 – Glen Ellyn, IL\n\nOctober 3 – Madison, WI\n\nOctober 5 – Des Moines, IA\n\nOctober 6 – Omaha, NE\n\nOctober 7 – Welch, MN\n\nOctober 27 – Nashua, NH\n\nOctober 28 – Providence, RI*\n\nNovember 3 – Shippensburg, PA\n\nNovember 4 – Munhall, PA\n\nNovember 7 – Charleston, SC\n\nNovember 8 – Ocala, FL\n\nNovember 10 – Birmingham, AL\n\nNovember 11 – Biloxi, MS\n\nNovember 25 – Thousand Oaks, CA^\n\nNovember 26 – Las Vegas, NV^\n\nNovember 28 & 29 – Scottsdale, AZ^\n\nDecember 1 – El Cajon, CA^\n\nDecember 2 – Coachella, CA^\n\nDecember 3 – Lemoore, CA^\n\nDecember 5 – Grass Valley, CA^\n\nDecember 7 – Salem, OR^\n\nDecember 8 – Spokane, WA^\n\nDecember 10 – Tulalip, WA^\n\nDecember 12 – Kalispell, MT^\n\nDecember 13 – Ketchum, ID^\n\nDecember 15 – Oakland, CA^\n\nDecember 16 – Campbell, CA^\n\nDecember 17 – Cerritos, CA^\n\n* with the local symphony\n\n^ Holidays and Hits"
