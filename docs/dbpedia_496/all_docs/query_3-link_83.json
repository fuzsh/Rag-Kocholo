        "text": "Wednesday’s concert at Meijer Gardens delivered the familiar and funky ensemble’s catchy catalog of material, bringing many fans to their feet. The review, photos at Local Spins.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR PHOTO GALLERY\n\nOn Wednesday at Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park, it was all about the mighty Tower of Power, who slowly worked the crowd into a frenzy, showcasing the band’s nonpareil horns and the dazzling voice of new lead singer Jordan John.\n\nOpening with the title track of the band’s 1978 LP, “We Came to Play,” John showcased his power and range from the jump, with an elastic falsetto that went wa-a-ay up there without a misstep or crack.\n\nBandleader Emilio Castillo has sung his praises, and rightly so. He may lack the grit of Hubert Tubbs or Marcus Scott or the depth of Ray Greene, but he has his own style, and hits all the notes and then some.\n\nOne of the strengths of the band is it always adapts to the lead singer – it has to, since it’s been home to more than a dozen vocalists over the years. With Tower of Power, it’s more than just singing, it is elevating the material and working the crowd. John brings a new element and style to the band, plus he’s obviously comfortable out front and off to a flying start with the band.\n\nAnd even after all these years, the band still does come to play every night. With a discography of more than 20 studio albums plus countless live recordings and collections, there are so many songs to choose from that true fans are bound to hear some favorites and be disappointed that others aren’t in the set.\n\nAmong those missing in action Wednesday were such favorites as “Only So Much Oil In The Ground” and “Knock Yourself Out” (though early arrivals could hear that tune and others almost in their entirety during a 45-minute sound check), or anything from its last two albums, “Step Up” or “Soul Side of Town.”\n\nBut what there was rocked the crowd and had it on its feet, whether “Diggin’ on James Brown” or singing about “Soul With A Capital S.” Yes, “You Ought To Be Havin’ Fun” because judging from the crowd’s reaction, everyone did.\n\nTOP has always been a player’s band, and that’s certainly still the case. New drummer Pete Antunes has a heavier feel than the immortal David Garibaldi, and powered the band throughout the night. His rhythm section mates were spot on all night, though bassist Mark Van Waganingen and guitarist Jerry Cortez were unfortunately nearly lost in the mix. So too were the background vocals, other than those of bandleader Emilio Castillo, and that was also the case for the trumpets.\n\nTom Politzer is the latest in a long line of lead saxophonists, and is the equal of any of them. Doc Kupka is simply the baddest bari player in all of funkdom, and Castillo’s playing and singing have never been better.\n\n“So Very Hard To Go,” the band’s biggest chart hit, is still a shimmering ode to lost love, and was one of John’s best performances. The band ended its set by asking the immortal question, “What Is Hip?” The answer will always be Tower of Power, and the band had fans on the hillside on their feet, though by that time many of them had left their seats and made their way to in front of the stage to dance.\n\nOf course there was an encore, and Tower fans knew what was coming: “You’re Still A Young Man.” Castillo and his longtime running mate, baritone saxophonist Stephen “The Funky Doctor” Kupka, are no longer so young. Yet after 56 years together, the 73-year-old Castillo and the 78-year-old Kupka are still pumping out the jams.\n\nLike “Souled Out,” which fittingly closed the show. First recorded in 1995, it’s a tribute to the band’s irrepressible party spirit, which continues unabated. “Late at night the place will be bumping/So you better bring your dancing shoes/’Cause there’s gonna be some hot funky rhythm and blues.” True that. Hot funky rhythm and blues were the order of the night, and by the end most everybody was dancing, whatever shoes they were wearing.\n\nOpening act Nathan Walton demonstrated his prowess on acoustic guitar, combining looping and fingerstyle, on some originals and a couple covers.\n\nHis country-esque approach on some of the numbers contrasted with what would come next, and he seemed a bit uncomfortable at first, mentioning a couple times the fact he was lacking the backing of his talented band, The Remedy, who could have helped round things out."
