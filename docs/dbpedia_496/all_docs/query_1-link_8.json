        "text": "“ Stars, thrones, skies, the Outside World, I don't need any of those things. But if someone tries to hurt someone precious to me, I will fight. ”\n\n—Jyu Viole Grace to Urek Mazino[13]\n\nTwenty-Fifth Baam (스물다섯번째 밤, Seumooldahseotbeonjjae Bahm; \"Twenty-Fifth Night\") or simply Baam for short, is an Irregular and the main protagonist of Tower of God. Baam entered the Tower in search of his best and only friend, Rachel, another Irregular,[14] who wanted to climb to the top of the Tower and see the stars.\n\nUpon passing Headon's test, he is deemed worthy of climbing the Tower. Before ascending, however, Baam must pass the Testing Floors (starting at Floor 2) whose purpose is to weed out anyone that might bring harm to the Tower. Bam finds a strong team and makes some great allies in the process.\n\nAfter being presumed dead after the events on the Test Floor, Baam is forcibly recruited into the organisation FUG, and later joins a new team: Team Tangsooyook. He manages to escape from FUG's clutches, eventually reuniting with his old friends and teammates. While affiliated with FUG, he went by the name Jue Viole Grace[15] (쥬 비올레 그레이스, Jyu Biolle Geuleiseu), a moniker that still follows him to this day. The name 'Jue Viole Grace' appears to have come from his mother Arlen Grace and his father V's names. This information is relayed to Baam during the events of the Floor of Death arc by the princess-in-hiding Garam Zahard[16] and further confirmed by Po Bidau Gustang, who refers to him as Son of Arlen, and the data of Khun Eduan, who refers to him as Son of V.\n\nOnce the Battle of the Last Station's events concluded, he willingly returned to FUG to train for two years and to utilize their resources to find a way to revive the comatose Khun Aguero Agnis and track down the Zahard Army's 4th Corps Commander Kallavan for having killed his master Ha Jinsung. Later discovering that his master was still alive and being held hostage by Zahard's forces under Khun Maschenny Zahard's watch, he and his team prepared for the opening battle of FUG's war against the Zahard Empire at the Battle of The Nest on the 52nd Floor.\n\nDuring the Battle of The Nest Baam and his team were pit against high rankers in the 4th Army Corp, which included Ranker members and Branch Leaders of the Lo Po Bia Family. Baam managed to both confront and fight Kallavan to a standstill. He astounded those present with the power and abilities he possesses by exhibiting both teleportation and spell-nullifying capabilities, notably as FUG breaches the First Defensive Wall with his help and allowing their forces to advance through The Second Defensive Wall. In the Cat Tower game directed by Lo Po Bia Yasratcha, Baam eventually confronts Arie White in his prime form. The fight appears to develop a darker side to Baam's powers, and at the end of the fight he, Khun and Rak all receive specific parts of White's powers. Shortly after, Baam manages to successfully reunite with his master.\n\nThe Nest battle derails with the appearance of Lo Po Bia Traumerei, family head of the Lo Po Bia Family and one of the Great Warriors, who takes Baam hostage with the intention to marry him into his Great Family, effectively ending the Nest battle and scattering many of FUG's forces across several unknown floors. Jinsung successfully convinces Traumerei to run a marriage competition for Baam's hand instead. The competition does not resolve in an actual marriage, but instead evolves into a competition between Traumerei and Gustang for the rights to Baam's freedom and their own lives at a Guide waymarker known as the Sprout.\n\nBaam is currently with several members of his team at the Sprout.\n\nNotes and Trivia[]\n\nIn Korean, the word 밤 (Baam) has two meanings: \"Night\" or \"Chestnut\". The latter meaning is emphasized by Headon, who abbreviates his name to Baam, joking, \"It has become a tasty name!\",[17] and the Second Floor Guardian who tells Baam: \"You... look tasty.\"[18][19]\n\nThe name \"Twenty-Fifth Baam (25th Baam)\" was relayed or given to Baam by Rachel.[2]\n\nBaam’s birthday and age are classified based on setting. SIU said; If you still want to celebrate, just celebrate my birthday instead (SIU’s birthday is May 29th). There is actually no way to find out his age.[2]\n\nHe goes under the alias Jue Viole Grace in Volume 2. It was first speculated that he might have been adopted by the leader of FUG, Grace Mirchea Luslec, but that has yet to be confirmed. After he meets Garam Zahard on the 43rd Floor, she tells him that his name comes from his parents.[20]\n\nSIU has stated that the origin of the name \"Viole\" came from the color \"Violet\".[21]\n\nBecause of his status as a Slayer Candidate, Baam has vast financial backup from FUG to the point where it can surprise many Rankers. It has been exemplified by Ha Jinsung buying Lo Po Bia Elaine for an unthinkable sum for Great families' financers during the Name Hunt Station auction .[22]\n\nBaam is apparently a great cook, having to cook for himself and Yeon Yihwa, with Ja Wangnan even calling him a super chef. His best dish is cream spaghetti,[23][24] which happens to be a dish Androssi Zahard ordered before the Submerged Fish Test.\n\nSurprisingly, Viole's clothes are all curated by Ha Jinsung. He is troubled by the fact that Jinsung sends him clothes every season.[23][24]\n\nAccording to Hwa Ryun, it is thanks to Ha Jinsung that FUG gives some freedom to Baam.[25]\n\nAfter the 28th Floor test, Viole buys junk food items for Team Tangsooyook. However, he has to eat them in secret or else Yeo Goseng will confiscate them since they're unhealthy. As a result, Viole has become a \"black market\" supplier and is very much loved by Yeo Miseng and Prince.[26][24]\n\nHe is ambidextrous, but was taught to dominantly use his right hand.[27]\n\nSIU stated that both he and Rachel know many secrets about the Outside.[28]\n\nHe is the once-dead son of Arlene Grace, who was later brought back to life by an \"Outside God\".[20] This was revealed by Garam Zahard on the 43rd floor using Arlen's pocket as evidence, a fact confirmed later by one of the 10 leaders, Po Bidau Gustang,[29] and Zahard himself.[30]\n\nAmong his core team (himself, Khun Aguero Agnis, and Rak Wraithraiser), he was only shown the shape of his shinsu when using the shinsu clickers on the Hidden Floor provided by Data Khun Eduan. The others were shown both their quality and shape.[31]\n\nHe usually doesn't eat anything salty, and he can't eat foods that are raw, such as sashimi.[32] He likes eating cooked Korean dishes and Eastern cuisine.\n\nDuring the Hell Train arc, SIU stated that he had the highest level of combat skill other than Androssi Zahard and Sachi.[33]\n\nHis character concept is a boy who clings to a girl to a point over normal. [sic][34]\n\nSince Tower of God is based on the Shōnen genre, it will have Baam's internal and external growth in the spotlight. Baam will realize his powers and advance farther as he climbs the Tower. That is the main attraction of Shōnen. But unlike Shōnen, Baam does not push his 'justice' and 'friendship' on others. His powers are not used for something like that.[35]\n\nSIU has stated that Baam is very strong against Spells. The secret behind that is something we will find out later.[36]\n\nSIU thinks that if there was a female character that Baam would hate, it would probably be the female equivalent of Yu Han Sung.[37]\n\nBaam has been noted by the God of Guardians to be similar to Zahard in his younger days, as he noted his conviction to gain power was similar to Zahard's own desire for power.[38] However, GOG revealed that though they both sought power to make people happy, Baam differed from Zahard in that he only wanted power to stay by his friends' side while Zahard wanted power to stand above others.[39]\n\nSIU even joked on his similarity to Zahard as a young man, stating how Baam and Zahard in his younger days would get along pretty well, but their relationship now is effectively ill-fated and antagonistic.[40]\n\nBaam is currently the only Regular strong enough to fight a Ranker and win and one of only two Regulars in history to achieve that feat, the other being Adori Zahard. However, he was able to accomplish this as a C-Rank Regular, whereas Adori only defeated a Ranker as an A-Rank Regular.[41] Additionally, unlike Adori, who was only ever known to beat a single Ranker as a Regular, Baam has faced and defeated several Rankers and has even defeated a High Ranker (Gado).\n\nDue to Baam's official victory over Test Ranker Pan, he is now universally negatively viewed by Rankers, who are angry at him for making the Tower look down on them.[42]\n\nBaam's fighting stance - palms flat or forming a fist, could indicate his state of mind or intention. In self-defence, flat palms indicate a defensive stance, showing Bam's unwillingness to fight and hurt others unless necessary, such as in early Season 2 and during his fight with Daniel. On the other hand, forming a fist indicates that a person goes from defensive to offensive, that the person no longer intends to just defend, but also to harm, like when he faced Data Zahard.
