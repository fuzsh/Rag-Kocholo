        "text": "PALM SPRINGS — The merger of media measurement houses comScore and Rentrak just completed, heralding what the pair say is a new era in consumer tracking for brands and publishers.\n\nAccording to comScore, the new entity can now see\n\n260 million desktop screens\n\n160 million mobile phone screens\n\n95 million tablet screens\n\n40 million television screens\n\n120 million video-on-demand screens\n\n40,000 movie theater screens\n\nBrands are pushing for holistic media measurement to take account of multi-modal consumer viewing in the digital age. Whilst comScore’s heritage is in online measurement, Rentrak majors in set-top box and movie measurement.\n\nRentrak CEO Bill Livek tells Beet.TV, in this video interview: “We’re creating nothing short of a new model for the dynamic, cross-platform consumer.\n\n“Cross-platform measurement is just in its infancy. But … when you add all the over-the-top digital platforms, there are a lot more consumers watching great TV shows. That’s great for the brand owners – they can use time and device as targets like never before.”"
