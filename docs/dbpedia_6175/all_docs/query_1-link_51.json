        "text": "Rentrak Business-to-Business Privacy Policy\n\nThis is a business-to-business Web site operated by Rentrak Corporation. This privacy policy applies to information that you provide to Rentrak via this site, and/or by use of other Rentrak sites or services that may be provided by other means or media included as set forth below. This Privacy Policy is intended to provide notice of Rentrak's information collection practices, including the types of information gathered, how the information is used and safeguarded, and the degree to which you may control the maintenance and sharing of your information. Your use of this Rentrak Web site or any of Rentrak's services constitutes acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any other applicable terms.\n\nPersonally Identifiable Information That We Collect\n\nRentrak respects your privacy and is committed to protecting personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with your use of its Web sites.\n\nUser Accounts\n\nIn order to use some services or download materials from Rentrak sites, you may need to register and create a user account (\"User Account\"). You may be asked to choose a user or member name (\"User Name\") and password. Please do not use your real name or the real name of another person when selecting a User Name. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, whether you choose it for yourself or Rentrak assigns it to you. You may also be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information, such as your real name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. As part of your User Account, you may receive email newsletters on occasion. You may request to opt out of these emails at any time by selecting the \"opt-out\" option within the body of the email.\n\nDepending on Rentrak products subscribed by you may be responsible for maintaining and updating your personal profile with current and complete information.\n\nInformation Collected by Other Means or Media\n\nIn some situations, we may also collect personally identifiable information and other information about you through other means, directly or indirectly. For example, if you access any Rentrak content, or purchase such content via your wireless carrier or through another third party, Rentrak may collect information directly from you or through the third party. Likewise, if you use our software, or provide information to other companies who share information about their customers, we may collect additional information about you. In each of these cases, Rentrak will apply this policy to any personally identifiable information that might be acquired.\n\nCustomer Service\n\nSome services may offer support and technical assistance through customer service centers via telephone, online chat, or e-mail. Whenever you communicate with customer service, you do so with the understanding that an operator may view and make changes to the information in your User Account in order to provide the assistance that you need.\n\nNon-Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect\n\nAs part of the registration process, you may be asked to provide information that does not personally identify you. This information is generally optional but may be included in your Personal Profile. Rentrak requests this information to understand you better and to also bring to your attention new services, programs, or offers that may be of interest.\n\nIn many cases, Rentrak will automatically collect certain non-personally identifiable information about your use of its sites and services. Rentrak might collect, among other things, information concerning the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your \"click path\" through the Rentrak sites or \"click-through\" from an e-mail, the Web site or advertisement that was linked to or from the Rentrak site when you visited, and your IP address. To do this, Rentrak may use cookies and other technology (see below). If you are using wireless services, we may also automatically collect information such as the type of wireless device you are using, your mobile identification number (assigned by your telecommunications carrier) and telecommunications carrier. Your use of our Web sites and services, and information provided through these technologies, will be anonymous unless you provide us with personally identifiable information or have provided such information in the past.\n\nCookies and Related Technology\n\nRentrak Web sites, and some services and advertisements may contain \"cookies,\" clear gifs (also known as web beacons or web bugs), or similar technology. A cookie is a piece of data that is sent to your browser, which will store the cookie on your computer if your browser is enabled to accept cookies. Clear gifs assist in the delivery of cookies and the collection of non-personally identifiable information, such as \"click path\" and other data as described above.\n\nRentrak uses cookies, clear gifs, frames, server log analysis and other technologies, as they are developed to customize your experience with our sites and services.\n\nMost Internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.

The ads, if and when applicable, appearing on our Web sites may be delivered to you by third-party advertising companies. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.\n\nNon-Personally Identifiable Information\n\nFrom time to time, Rentrak may share with third parties aggregate, non-personally identifiable user information to show general demographic and preference information among users of the Rentrak Web sites.\n\nPersonally Identifiable Information\n\nRentrak uses information about you to deliver the services that you request, to inform you of other services or offers in which you might be interested, and to improve and enhance our sites and services.

In the event of such a merger, acquisition, or sale, your continued use of the site or any related Service signifies your agreement to be bound by the Privacy Policy of the site's or Service's subsequent owner or operator.\n\nRentrak may also work from time to time with third parties to provide portions of its sites and services.

If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.\n\nRentrak will not share, sell, rent, or disclose any personally identifiable information that we have collected except as stated herein, or in the following instances: 1) we have been given your consent to disclose; 2) we have previously informed you of the disclosure, including by means of our Privacy Policy or on the Web site; 3) we are required by law, legal process, or court order to disclose; 4) disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may cause or be causing harm to, or interference with, Rentrak's rights or property, other Rentrak Web site users, or anyone else; or 5) to respond to an inquiry, request or complaint that you have made. Rentrak may also use IP addresses in cooperation with Internet service providers to identify users if we deem it necessary to comply with law, to enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or to protect our sites, customers, or others.\n\nOur Commitment to Data Security\n\nWhile Rentrak takes reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized disclosure and to prevent possible security breaches in our Web sites, services, and customer databases, no Web site, Internet transmission, computer system or wireless connection is completely secure.\n\nConsequently, Rentrak cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.
