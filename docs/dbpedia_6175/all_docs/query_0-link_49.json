        "text": "comScore Inc., an Internet analytics firm, and Rentrak Corporation, a global media measurement and research firm, announced that in separate meetings of their shareholders, Rentrak approved the merger, while those belonging to comScore were amenable to issuing the company’s common stock as a sign of acceptance of the merger.\n\nThe closing of transactions is expected to be on Friday, January 29, 2016, after which Rentrak will become a subsidiary of comScore. After the close of trading, comScore will be joining the S&P MidCap 400 Index, shifting from S&P SmallCap 600 Index.\n\nAccording to a press release, the merger communications about its completion and timing are based on particular provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, most specifically, the “safe harbour” provisions. The statements are a reflection of the management’s present views and expectations. They have been made to include factors like timing and effects regarding the pending transaction. The forward-looking statements are based on the estimates, assumptions and projections of the management. To be sure however, the stated factors could cause the final result of the merger to be significantly different from what has been projected.\n\nThe participants of the merger are the executive officers and directors from both participating companies."
