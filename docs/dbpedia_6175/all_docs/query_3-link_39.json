        "text": "Rentrak Appoints New CEO\n\nUS media measurement specialist Rentrak Corporation has appointed consumer and media research industry veteran Bill Livek as Chief Executive Officer, leading both day-to-day operations and the growth and evolution of the firm.\n\nLivek joins with more than three decades of market research industry experience. Most recently, he served in a number of roles at Experian, including as Co-President of Experian Research Services. He was previously the Co-Chair and Director of Simmons Market Research Bureau, where he directed the growth of the company and ultimately arranged its sale to Experian in 2004.\n\nPrior to this, Livek co-founded Symmetrical Resources, which bought Simmons in 1998, and served as President and CEO of ADcom Information Systems, which electronically measured local cable TV viewing. Earlier in his career, he was President and CEO of Birch Research, and before this, he was VP of Sales/Marketing for Arbitron.\n\nPaul Rosenbaum will continue to serve as Chairman of Rentrak's Board of Directors, having held the roles of both Chairman and CEO since September of 2000. He comments: 'I am confident that we have in Bill the ideal strategic and operational expertise on board to ensure continued growth opportunities for the company that will evolve Rentrak into a multi-screen measurement and research powerhouse'.\n\nRentrak is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, with additional offices in Florida, Los Angeles and New York City. Yesterday, the firm announced it has partnered with video and media solutions firm Concurrent to gain a 360 degree view of video and advertising consumption patterns across multi-screen media.\n\nWeb site: www.rentrak.com .\n\nAll articles 2006-23 written and edited by Mel Crowther and/or Nick Thomas, 2024- by Nick Thomas, unless otherwise stated."
