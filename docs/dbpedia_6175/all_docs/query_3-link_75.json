        "text": "The mobile advertising company Millennial Media, acquired by AOL in September, has launched a new ad product in partnership with Rentrak. Rentrak, which collects data across both satellite and cable providers, will measure TV viewers’ commercial viewership. Millennial will then use the data to target viewers on their smartphones and tablets. Advertisers will be able to hone in on specific viewers, retargeting viewers who have already seen their ads on linear TV, or even targeting viewers who have seen their competitors’ ads. “Screens are no longer used in isolation, with 70% using a mobile device while watching TV,” said Liza Blumenthal, Millennial Media’s Regional VP of Sales for the Northeast, in an email to Cynopsis Digital. “Targeting consumers who have seen a TV ad on their mobile screen maximizes the spend and brings a level of actionability.”"
