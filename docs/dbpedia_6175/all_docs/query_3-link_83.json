I have yet to purchase the new server as I need to know if the following programs listed above are compatible with Windows 7 and what server will they all be compatible with. They are currently running on Server 2000 and XP Pro stations which have to be swapped out.\n\nPLEASE HELP...I know Rentrak is no longer supported but we have to use it until Adagio Rentals is made for us.\n\nDouglas Dickie\n\nAdagio God\n\nRegistered: 06/02/99\n\nPosts: 4337\n\nLoc: Vancouver, BC\n\nI know that when setup correctly XP Pro 32 bit workstations and Windows 2003 servers will run all ACCPAC Plus modules and add-ons (Rentrak). Windows 7 and Server 2008 do have compatibility modes for the operating systems that will run ACCPAC Plus but I canÂ’t recommend them as no one has done any testing, so there is no guarantees. There is no means to change ACCPAC Plus or Rentrak to make it compatible with the newer operating systems.\n\nThe current versions of Adagio are compatible with the current versions of Microsoft's operating systems.\n\n_________________________\n\nDouglas Dickie\n\nAccSys Solutions Inc\n\nPhone: 1.888.534.4344\n\nddickie@accsyssolutions.com\n\nSteve Schwartz\n\nAdagio God\n\nRegistered: 03/10/02\n\nPosts: 4463\n\nLoc: Wynnewood, PA\n\nHi Mogolish\n\nDepending on how intense of a Rentrak user you are, you could switch from Rentrak to Adagio Invoices. I have converted a former Rentrak user and they are very happy with Invoices.\n\nWhat is the most important feature that Rentrak has that you can't give up?\n\nSteve\n\nMogolish\n\nNew Guy\n\nRegistered: 07/22/11\n\nPosts: 6\n\nLoc: Ottawa, Ontario\n\nUnfortunately for now we have to stick with Rentrak until the Rentals module is up and running. Will Windows 7 and Rentrak run together? I know the compatibility module is pretty good at fixing older running versions...it would only be for a couple of months.\n\nMogolish\n\nNew Guy\n\nRegistered: 07/22/11\n\nPosts: 6\n\nLoc: Ottawa, Ontario\n\nI have serveral users using Accpac as we're all networked. Are you saying to keep this as a solution or DON'T do it because it will be a nightmare??\n\nI think I am going to bring in a test environment of 7 and try to work with Rentrak - see how it fairs..."
