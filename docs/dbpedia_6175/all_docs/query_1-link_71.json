Both companies are based here.\n\nsmissed with leave to refile, according to a Rentrak-issued statement.\n\nIndependents Sue Blockbuster, Studios\n\nSAN ANTONIO -- Two independent video retailers based here, Five Palms Video and Chayn Reaction Video, filed suit last month against Blockbuster Entertainment and six movie studios under Texas state and federal antitrust laws, accusing them of conspiring to monopolize the industry.\n\nUnder the name Fairness Alliance of Independent Retailers, or FAIR, the class-action litigation alleges that direct shared revenue programs are \"exclusionary pricing agreements\" that have forced many independent retailers to go out of business.\n\nFAIR has filed two suits. One case, Loredo v. Blockbuster Inc., was brought against Blockbuster in state court here under the Texas antitrust statute.\n\nThe other case, Chayn Reaction Video Inc. v. Viacom Inc., et al, was filed against the studios and Blockbuster parent Viacom in the U.S. District Court here under federal antitrust laws. Paramount, Disney, Warner, Columbia, Universal and Fox were named in the second suit."
