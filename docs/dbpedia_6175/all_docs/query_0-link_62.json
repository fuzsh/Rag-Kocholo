        "text": "<!–[CDATA[Rentrak, a provider of viewership data that has recently been moving aggressively to strike pacts with a number of major media companies, said it had expanded its relationship with 21st Century Fox's Fox Networks Group.\n\nUnder the pact, Fox Broadcasting, FX Networks and the company's U.S. based National Geographic Channels will access Rentrak's complete TV ratings measurement insights. Rentrak utilizes data from set-top boxes and helps determine viewer behavior, among other things.\n\n\"As television continues to evolve from linear programming to a premium, platform-agnostic experience, and as we optimize that experience with messaging to highly defined customer segments, we see Rentrak as well positioned to deliver the kind of data insights that will help inform targeted TV advertising strategy,\" said Audrey Steele, FNG's senior vice president of sales research and marketing, in a prepared statement. \"Rentrak has been embraced by all the major agency holding companies and it is important to FNG we have the same intelligence that Rentrak provides to the buying community.\"\n\nLast week, Rentrak struck a deal to buy U.S. TV measurement services from Kantar, a research arm of ad-holding company WPP. In turn, WPP took a stake in the company, and WPP's large GroupM media-buying arm agreed to make use of Rentrak data to supplement the Nielsen audience information that is used as currency in negotiations between TV networks and advertisers.\n\n© 2014 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC"
