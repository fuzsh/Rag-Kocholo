        "text": "Rentrak Corporation is a global media measurement and research company serving the entertainment industry. Rentrak is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, United States. Assessing and disclosing box office collections of movies in the US is one of the tasks allocated for Rentrak.\n\nSince Rentrak discloses exact collections of films in the US, there is no chance buyers revealing fake collections of films. And now, gradually the demand of Rentrak system to get introduced in Telugu states spread its wings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCine fans, who wish to know the genuine collections of films are desperately seeking Rentrak to start its services in Tollywood.\n\nThere are many advantages with Rentrak collections in Telugu states. For an instance, a top Telugu hero is alleged not to have Rs.10 crores share film in Ceded area. As such, buyers can invest less on the hero's films. Similarly, another top hero doesn't have Rs.1 crore gross film in RTC X Roads. New buyers maybe aware of investing high budget on those films."
