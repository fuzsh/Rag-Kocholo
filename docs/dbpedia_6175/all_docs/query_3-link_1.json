        "text": "Two longtime leaders in measurement innovation use massive data scale to establish new currencies for understanding consumers’ multiscreen behavior\n\nRESTON, VA, February 1, 2016 – Comscore, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCOR) announced today the completion of its merger with Rentrak to create a new cross-platform measurement company built on a precise, innovation-led understanding of audiences, brands and consumer behavior at massive scale.\n\n“This merger brings together two great entrepreneurial companies that invented their respective fields and their respective trusted currencies,” said Serge Matta, CEO of Comscore. “Both have been driven to create innovative technology platforms that use massive data scale to measure increasingly fragmented consumer behavior. Together these two principal architects of the multiscreen future will deliver the cross-platform currencies that have been demanded for so long.”\n\nBoth companies have unmatched expertise in unifying billions of pieces of proprietary “census” data, encompassing digital, TV set-top box, movie screens and demographic information with the behavior of millions of individual consumers.\n\nTogether, the new company reports in more than 75 countries. In the United States, Comscore will now be measuring behavior on more than 260 million desktop screens, 160 million mobile phone screens, 95 million tablet screens, 40 million television screens, 120 million video-on-demand screens, and 40,000 movie theater screens representing well over a hundred million movie-goers.\n\n“The cross-platform world is changing rapidly and this change demands relentless inventiveness, agility, and collaborative intelligence,” added Matta. “These are qualities on which both companies have built their success. This proven ability to precisely measure extremely fragmented, dynamic audiences in dramatic, innovative ways --- and to quickly report on it --- has provided the insights that allow our clients to act with great competitive advantages.”\n\n“The media industry can no longer be measured with samples in the thousands of households or individuals,” said Bill Livek, Vice Chairman & President of Comscore. “The solutions our customers need must be based on unifying and making actionable massive amounts of information they can use as both a currency and to better manage their businesses. Our joint cultures have been living and breathing this mission from our companies’ inceptions.”\n\n“When you come from the world of trillions of fragmented digital interactions, you understand the need for massive data and sophisticated technology. That’s why for 15 years we’ve invented measurement systems based on these principles in anticipation of the evolving needs of our clients,” said Magid Abraham, Comscore’s Chairman and Co-Founder. “We’re incredibly excited about where our innovations and insights will take our clients in this new trajectory.”\n\nAbout Comscore\n\nComscore (NASDAQ: SCOR) is the cross-platform measurement company that precisely measures audiences, brands and consumer behavior everywhere. Comscore completed its merger with Rentrak Corporation in January 2016 to create the new model for a dynamic, cross-platform world. Built on precision and innovation, our unmatched data footprint combines proprietary digital, TV and movie intelligence with vast demographic details to quantify consumers’ multiscreen behavior at massive scale. This approach helps media companies monetize their complete audiences and allows marketers to reach these audiences more effectively. With more than 3,200 clients and global footprint in more than 75 countries, Comscore is delivering the future of measurement.
