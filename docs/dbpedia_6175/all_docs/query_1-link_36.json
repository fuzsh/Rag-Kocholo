I guess they like the higher number to add to their totals.\n\nDo you folks report your nightly ticket sales with taxes included in the total amount reported? I never have, but I guess I'll be starting now.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nTony Ratcliff\n\nExpert Film Handler\n\nPosts: 216\n\nFrom: Madison, IN, USA\n\nRegistered: Mar 2002\n\nposted 03-23-2015 03:27 PM When I had a theater in Florida, which does charge sales tax, I set up RTS to NOT include the tax.\n\nThe problem when you DO include the tax is that when the flash grosses are picked up by the studios, they will not match your box office reports that you send in at the end of the week, and all sorts of confusion can occur. I.E. you send in a check for what you should be paying, but the studio hasn't updated your account yet with your box office actuals, and you get a call or email saying you shorted the payment. Then you have to call them and straighten it all out.\n\nAlso, the studio license contracts say to report the grosses WITHOUT the tax on your box office reports, so I would think the same would apply to reporting to Rentrak.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nMike Blakesley\n\nFilm God\n\nPosts: 12767\n\nFrom: Forsyth, Montana\n\nRegistered: Jun 99\n\nposted 03-23-2015 05:55 PM Since we don't have sales tax I guess I never thought about it -- but after reflecting, I think it does make more sense that you would leave the tax out of the gross since tax money is just \"passed through\" the theatre to the government.\n\n| IP: Logged\n\nRusty Gordon\n\nFilm Handler\n\nPosts: 33\n\nFrom: Fairview, Tennessee USA\n\nRegistered: Feb 2004\n\nposted 03-23-2015 09:01 PM I can give you the definitive answer.\n\nWhen calling in or faxing in your grosses to Rentrak you *DO NOT* include admission taxes.\n\nIf you are reporting your grosses via FTP using your Ticketing POS System, the numbers submitted *DO* include tax. The Rentrak file specification for submissions via POS systems specifically states that including taxes is a requirement.\n\n\"Part 1, Data Definitions Boxoffice Hourly & Boxoffice Final File\n\nTotal_gross is comprised of all of the sales for that business day, even if sold on a previous date, including tax, less total_refunds. Sales for future dates may be reported using the corresponding date in the future.\n\n* * *\n\nTheater_ID_number\n\nShowtime_Date_Time (optional)\n\nTitle_number\n\nTitle\n\nTotal_gross (Entire day, include tax and previous advance sales)\"\n\nRusty Gordon\n\nSensible Cinema Software\n\n| IP: Logged"
