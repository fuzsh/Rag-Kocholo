        "text": "With a recent announcement that it had signed Fox and Buena Vista, and three smaller studios to its new Web-based box office-tracking system, Rentrak proved that Nielsen EDI is no longer the only money-counter in town.\n\nPortland, Ore.-based Rentrak — a company with roots in homevideo tracking — has lured several EDI studio clients to its Box Office Essentials primarily on cost and ease of use. Rentrak reportedly charges major studios in the high six figures, less for smaller suppliers — and substantially less than what EDI charged. (Some say EDI has dropped prices recently to stay competitive.)\n\nThose that have switched to Rentrak praise the system for its ease of use, claiming it isn’t as clunky as EDI’s Box Office Flash Figures Online.\n\n“I like the system better,” confirms Fox distrib president Bruce Snyder, whose company uses Rentrak exclusively. “It’s more user-friendly.”\n\nIn development for 18 months, Box Office Essentials is fed real-time box office data electronically from theaters’ point-of-sale systems. The Web-based system can be accessed by studio execs and other clients for the latest performance data, which can be viewed and analyzed according to cinema chain, region, genre and numerous other categories.\n\n“Technologywise, we are light years ahead of our competitor. We do it completely different than they do,” says Rentrak theatrical topper Ron Giambra. “We collect all our data electronically. We have real-time data.”\n\nEDI says it’s close to launching two updates to its system, which in the past couple of years moved from being a dial-up service to Internet accessible.\n\nEDI president Tom Borys says its 2001 acquisition by Dutch media conglomerate VNU — which also owns and operates Nielsen Media Research — coupled with Rentrak’s entrance has spurred the company to update its products.\n\n“Whenever there’s a competitor in the marketplace, it adds new insight in terms of what the market is looking for. It makes us think about our strategy and what’s important to our clients.”\n\nIn late March, EDI will introduce a more user-friendly interface for its BOFFO system, Borys says, and the company will add more reports from and analytical access to its historical database.\n\nThat same month, EDI will launch FilmSource, a Web-based B.O. database — co-branded with Variety — that gives a broad view on film performance. The system will allow users access to historical film information, market share and database queries based on ratings, box office, genre and other criteria.\n\nFor example, Borys says, to look up historical box office records regarding Presidents Day weekend will only require a few keystrokes, whereas current users must rely on their own records.\n\n“There’s always a tradeoff between simplicity and flexibility,” Borys explains. “There is a challenge to sort of balance out what’s most useful to the user and be able to reach an audience that has both very sophisticated users and users that just want to push a button and get results.”\n\nEDI, which collects its data in a variety of ways, typically has more numbers posted earlier, and the company continually updates figures as the day’s totals come in from theaters. The company began adding opening-day matinee figures five years ago and has added hourly updates on Friday night box office totals. Rentrak updates its information every day as numbers come in from theaters.\n\nEDI recently signed long-term contracts with most studios, the company says, which could be a deterrent to other studios signing on to Rentrak. However, Buena Vista is continuing with both services, and Rentrak says it will announce more deals at ShoWest.\n\n“Both companies have a lot of money behind them to invest in technology. Both are spending a lot of money to stay in this,” says Exhibitor Relations president Paul Dergarabedian, whose company has followed the rivalry. “They’re two companies with two slightly different philosophies trying to serve a purpose in the marketplace.”"
