        "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Vobile, the worldwide leader in video and audio content protection, measurement and monetization services, announced today it has acquired the Pay-Per-Transaction (PPT) business from Rentrak (NASDAQ: RENT), the leader in precisely measuring movies and TV everywhere. Vobile will hire all Rentrak PPT employees and continue to operate in their current Portland, Oregon office location. The PPT revenue sharing system enables retailers everywhere, regardless of size, to increase both the depth and breadth of their video inventory, better satisfy customer demand, and more effectively compete in the marketplace. The PPT business was the foundation that transformed the predecessor company, National Video, into Rentrak.\n\nPervasive broadband and smart phones today create unprecedented opportunity for global movie and TV distribution business while posing major threat of piracy at the same time. A trusted revenue sharing system with robust content protection and accurate measurement will be the key to unlock revenue potential for video content distribution over Internet.\n\n\"Vobile has been a trusted provider of premier services in content protection, measurement and monetization to movie studios and TV networks for nearly a decade,\" said Yangbin Wang, CEO of Vobile. \"We are very pleased to be able to work with Rentrak to acquire the complete team along with the Pay-Per-Transaction revenue sharing system, which has three decades of excellent track record in helping clients make more profit with less risk. By integrating the PPT system with our VDNA platform, Vobile will enable content owners and distributors to maximize their revenues in the mobile Internet era. We look forward to serving all our existing customers and many more.\"\n\n\"While our PPT business no longer fits with our strategy of precisely measuring movies and TV everywhere, it has provided considerable value for studios and brick and mortar retailers for many years, while generating more than $100 million in cash for Rentrak since 2006 that we used to build our movie and TV measurement businesses,\" said Rentrak Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman Bill Livek. \"Vobile has been a strategic vendor to Rentrak for some time, and we are confident that Vobile is fully committed to continuing our long-standing tradition of providing outstanding service to the clients of its PPT business. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Vobile in our information businesses.\"\n\nAbout Rentrak\n\nRentrak (NASDAQ: RENT) is the entertainment and marketing industries' premier provider of worldwide consumer viewership information, precisely measuring actual viewing behavior of movies and TV everywhere.
