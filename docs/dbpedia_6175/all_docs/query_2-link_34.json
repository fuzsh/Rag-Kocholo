        "text": "Our annual user conference Inspire 2015 in Boston, Massachusetts is in full swing and I am fortunate enough to host the Data Analyst track. Today, the first day of the track brought a great lineup of speakers and use cases and for those who were not able to make it to the show or couldn't make it to any of the sessions; here are some examples and highlights of what you missed.\n\nPaul Lilford from Tableau joined Wendy Gradek of EMC to deliver an excellent presentation highlighting how the combination of Alteryx and Tableau has allowed EMC to address their need to deliver analytics faster and in a more consistent manner.\n\nBrenden Weeks and John Kullman from Sprint use Alteryx to do Data Blending - pulling data from multiple sources and joining them together into a unified view, and then analyze the data to drive better business decisions.\n\nJon Albertini and Mandy Gray from Delhaize America showed how they built a macro in Alteryx that helps them reduce the time it takes to create customer-based and distance-based trade areas to help support site location research.\n\nShaye Eller of Rentrak, a company that processes over 182+ billion TV transactions annually, discussed the need for county-level TV ratings for over 210 media markets in the U.S. and the challenges of producing the sample data for analysis. She discussed how using Alteryx saves over 8 hours for each project.\n\nJohn Hollingsworth from Clear Channel Outdoor and also a contestant in the Alteryx Grand Prix demonstrated how to use the Download tool in Alteryx to scrape data from a websites location tool to analyze web traffic.\n\nIt was a fantastic Day 1 of track sessions and they really highlight how flexible of a product that Alteryx is and how organizations can take advantage of it in so many ways. That being said, the consistent theme that came from almost every presentation is speed, speed, speed.\n\nOrganizations are able to do things faster than they were before. This is something that we hear and see every day when we talk to customers. I look forward to seeing what Day 2 of the Data Analyst track has in store.\n\nCheck out tomorrow's blog to catch the highlights."
