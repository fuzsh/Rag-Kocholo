        "text": "Petr Jákl is a screenwriter, director and film producer. The latest film directed by Petr is the historical drama Medieval (2022), starring Ben Foster, Michael Caine, Til Schweiger and Matthew Goode. The Czech actors featured in the film include Karel Roden, Ondřej Vetchý, Marek Vašut and Jan Budař. In 2020, Petr was a producer on The Last Full Measure, a Lionsgate film with actors Sebastian Stan, Samuel L. Jackson, William Hurt, Ed Harris, Christopher Plummer and Peter Fonda. As a producer, he has also worked on American Traitor with Al Pacino (2021), Misfits with Pierce Brosnan (2021), Best Sellers with Aubrey Plaza and Michael Caine (2021), Savage Salvation with Robert DeNiro and John Malkovich (2022), One True Loves with Simu Liu (2022), The Inhabitant with Dermot Mulroney (2022), 57 Seconds with Morgan Freeman and The Black Demon with Josh Lucas. Petr has also worked with many other acclaimed actors such as Anthony Hopkins, Nicholas Cage, Alec Baldwin, Mila Jovovich and Vin Diesel.\n\nPetr Jákl’s path to the world of film was not entirely typical. In his youth he was primarily involved in sports, namely judo, but he also became a Czech national champion in Arm Wrestling. In judo he is a ten-time national champion and he won the World Cup and won two bronze medals at the Academic World Championships. The highlight of his judo career was his participation in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where he finished thirteenth. Despite all his success in judo, Petr gradually moved on to a career in film. Just as in sports, he embarked on his career in film, whether as an actor or stuntman, with patience and determination. He eventually began to appear in Czech and foreign films. These included Joan of Arc (dir. Luc Besson, 1999) and xXx (dir. Rob Cohen, 2002). Director Besson and Rob Cohen encouraged Petr to continue his interest in film, and as a result he decided to go to America to study.\n\nThe film Kajínek (2010) was Petr’s directorial, writer and producer debut. The political thriller achieved the highest sales during its opening week and the highest total sales in this genre in Czech history. The film won the Czech Lion in the Supporting Actor category and the main prize at the Belgian Film Festival in Liege. This was followed by the film Ghoul (2015), which Petr again directed, wrote and produced. Ghoul became the highest-grossing horror film in Czech history and won the main award at the Grossmann Fantastic Festival. His most recent work, which he directed, wrote and produced, is the historical epic Medieval (2022).\n\nPetr is also very intensively involved in project development. One such project is the film Calico Joe, on which Petr is an executive producer. John Grisham’s novel was adapted into a screenplay by Grant Heslov and George Clooney, who also stars in the film. One of the co-producers of the project, along with Clooney’s company, is Bob Dylan’s company. Petr is currently developing dozens of film and television projects, including a TV series with Stephen King and three films from Marvel creator Stan Lee, which he is producing with director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, with Angelina Jolie).\n\nPetr also founded R.U.Robot Studios in 2022, a virtual film and video game studio that focuses on the development, production, post-production and distribution of films and video games. This studio is also distributing his film Medieval and producing the video game for the film for PC and consoles, as well as the MEDIEVAL game for phones.\n\nBen Foster is an award-winning actor of film and stage whose riveting performances have mesmerize audiences for over two decades. This year, he received rave reviews for his performance as Harry Haft in “The Survivor,” reuniting him with director Barry Levison who cast him in his first film “Liberty Heights.” The film was released by HBO after premiering at the Toronto Film Festival. He also appeared in the Jeremy Zagar’s film “Hustle” this year opposite Adam Sandler for Netflix. Foster recently wrapped the true-crime thriller \"Finestkind\" opposite Tommy Lee Jones for director Brian Helgeland.\n\nFoster starred in Debra Granik’s acclaimed film “Leave No Trace” for which he was nominated for a Gotham Award and London Critics Circle Film Award for Best Actor. In 2016, Foster starred opposite Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges in David Mackenzie’s critical smash “Hell or High Water,” winning the Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Film, and named one of the best films of the year by the AFI. Additional credits include Scott Cooper’s “Hostiles,” Ron Howard’s “Inferno,” Craig Gillespie’s “The Finest Hours,” Stephen Frears’ “The Program,” Pete Berg’s “Lone Survivor,” David Lowery’s “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints,” John Krokidas’ “Kill Your Darlings,” James Mangold’s “3:10 to Yuma,” Nick Cassavetes’ “Alpha Dog,” and two films directed by Oren Moverman: “Rampart” and “The Messenger.”\n\nOn television, Foster memorably recurred as Russell Corwin on HBO’s Six Feet Under (SAG Award – Ensemble Drama) and won an Emmy for his performance in the TV movie “Bang Bang You’re Dead.” On Stage, he played Stanley Kowalski in the Young Vic’s production of “A Streetcar Named Desire” opposite Gillian Anderson in London and at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn.

He gained his latest Oscar®, Golden Globe® and BAFTA Award nominations for his work in 2002’s “The Quiet American,” for which he also won a London Film Critics Circle Award.\n\nCaine previously won Golden Globe® and London Film Critics Circle Awards and received a BAFTA Award nomination, all for Best Supporting Actor, for “Little Voice.” He won his latest London Film Critics Circle Award for his performance in Christopher Nolan’s period drama “The Prestige.” It was his second film for the director following their collaboration on the 2005 hit “Batman Begins,” in which Caine played Bruce Wayne’s butler and confidant, Alfred. In 2008 and 2012, he reprised the role of Alfred in Nolan’s blockbusters “The Dark Knight” and “The Dark Knight Rises.” In 2012, he also completed working with director Sandra Nettleback on “Mr. Morgan’s Last Love”, based on the novel \"La Douceur Assassine\" by Francoise Dorner, as well as on Louis Leterrier’s “Now You See Me”, with Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Jesse Eisenberg, and Woody Harrelson.\n\nCaine was born Maurice Micklewhite in South London in 1933 and developed an interest in acting at an early age. Upon his discharge from the Queen’s Royal Regiment and Royal Fusiliers in 1953, he began pursuing his career. Taking his stage name from the title “The Caine Mutiny,” he toured Britain in a variety of plays and began appearing in British films and television shows.\n\nIn 1964, Caine landed his first major film role as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead in “Zulu.” The following year, he starred in the hit thriller “The Ipcress File,” earning his first of 37 BAFTA Award nominations for his portrayal of secret agent Harry Palmer. However, it was his Oscar®- nominated performance in the seminal sixties film “Alfie” that catapulted Caine to international stardom. During the late 1960s, he went on to star in 11 films, including “The Ipcress File” sequels, “Funeral in Berlin” and “Billion Dollar Brain”; “Gambit,” earning a Golden Globe® nomination; “Hurry Sundown”; “Woman Times Seven”; “Deadfall”; “The Magus”; “The Italian Job”; and “Battle of Britain.”\n\nOver the next two decades, Caine starred in more than 40 films, including Robert Aldrich’s “Too Late the Hero”; “X, Y and Zee,” opposite Elizabeth Taylor; John Huston’s “The Man Who Would Be King”; “Harry and Walter Go to New York”; Richard Attenborough’s “A Bridge Too Far”; the Neil Simon comedy “California Suite”; Brian De Palma’s “Dressed to Kill”; John Huston’s “Victory”; Sidney Lumet’s “Deathtrap”; Stanley Donen’s “Blame It on Rio”; John Frankenheimer’s “The Holcroft Covenant”; Neil Jordan’s “Mona Lisa”; and “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,” for which he received a Golden Globe® nomination.\n\nSince then, Caine has starred in such films as “Blood and Wine,” “Quills,” “Miss Congeniality,” and “Austin Powers: Goldmember,” Gore Verbinski’s “The Weather Man,” Alfonso Cuaron’s “Children of Men,” the title role in the independent film “Harry Brown,” and reuniting with Christopher Nolan in smash hits “Inception” and “Interstellar.” He lent his voice to Lord Redbrick in “Gnomeo & Juliet” as well as “Cars,“ and also appears in “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island” for New Line/Warner Bros.

He more recently starred in James Marsh’s “King of Thieves.” Caine also produced and narrated “My Generation,” a bold, musically driven documentary about Britain in the sixties, which features Paul McCartney, Keith Richards, and other icons of the decade. Caine then starred in “Tenet” with Christopher Nolan- becoming their eighth collaboration. He followed with “Best Sellers” playing the leading role opposite Aubrey Plaza.\n\nCaine is also a well known author having penned numerous novels on acting as well as autobiographies, such as “What’s It All About?,” as well as “Acting on Film,” a book based on a series of lectures he gave on BBC Television. His latest memoir, “The Elephant to Hollywood,” was published to much acclaim in 2010 by Henry Holt and Co. in the United States.\n\nIn the 1992 Queen’s Birthday Honours, Caine was awarded the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (C.B.E.), and eight years later he received a knighthood.\n\nCaine is next set to star opposite Glenda Jackson in “The Great Escaper,“ to be directed by Oliver Parker.\n\nSOPHIE LOWE can next be seen in the independent film, THE DIVE, which she recently shot in Europe.
