The film didn´t address it (give DC 3 more months) but she is bisexual.

I also don't think people care about Deadpool's sexuality given that's not really a large element of his character.....plus despite the success of his movie he's still a relatively low level character most of the public isn't really familiar with.\n\nStuart Smith wrote:\n\nI generally find Japan handles these issues more tactfully than America does, but that might primarily stem from Japan being a much more humble society.\n\nA society that still isn't very accepting towards the LGBTQ community in spite of the prominence of gay, lesbian, and trans characters in various anime and manga.

This is the Power Ranger, how about we keep sex out of it.\n\nDude the characters in Power Rangers are teenagers.....sex (and sexuality) is something that realistically is going to be on their minds unless of course among them is one of those \"saving myself\" for marriage types. Also it's interesting you mention they shouldn't force diversity by highlighting it and yet when everyone found out Micheal B. Jordan was playing Johnny Storm in Josh Trank's Fantastic Four it was the detractors highlighting it the most. Though thankfully they stopped complaining about that (for the most part) to focus on the movie's more legitimate issues.\n\nBack to top\n\nI don't see what the big deal is. It seems to be just one quick line, much like the extremely short scene in Beauty and the Beast. It's not like she comes running out of a closet with a rainbow flag. Honestly, that's probably how it should be handled. A simple statement saying \"girlfriend problems\" and that's it. No shock, no repulsion, etc. If it would be okay for the blue, pink, or red Rangers to discuss who they've dated or who they have a crush on, then it should be okay for others, even if those people are of the same sex.\n\nTrini's sexuality wasn't ever a major plot point in MMPR, so it's not changing the story line beyond what they've already done. I do agree with the idea that perhaps the Blue Ranger should have been the gay character, especially considering the harassment his original actor was said to have undergone during filming.\n\nBack to top\n\nWell this discussion is nowhere near the level of the Yahoo comments section.\n\nThe one time I clicked on a Yahoo article...\n\nBack to top\n\nIt seems like the press cares more about this than the actual film does.\n\nNow can I see my mashup of Pacific Rim and the Breakfast Club already?\n\nBack to top\n\nUnless this is some publicity stunt, I've lost all interest. I don't need a form of escapism to preach any agenda.\n\nBack to top\n\nBadNewsBlues wrote:\n\nA society that still isn't very accepting towards the LGBTQ community in spite of the prominence of gay, lesbian, and trans characters in various anime and manga. Yet seemingly and ironically no one whines about agendas being pushed down throats.\n\nThe simple reason is because (until VERY recently) Japan was not a society big on \"remakes\". Most Japanese media was very much made, consumed and then they moved on. If you make a NEW story that has gay characters, then people see X character \"has always been gay\" and either likes or dislikes that CHARACTER on their own merits. (even if you wanna say someone hates the gay character due to homophobia, at least you can clearly parse out that \"I hate the gay character\") It's much different when you take an EXISTING franchise and start changing all the characters/story/etc. How many longtime fans hated the new Transformers because they had them making fart jokes and other stupid writing? Or people hated \"emo\" Superman. For all the arguments people got into over the female Ghostbusters, people also hated the totally heterosexual, male (but absolutely stupid) \"updated\" Dukes of Hazard.\n\nPeople can dislike \"remakes\" as a bad idea, and adding a bunch of changes doesn't make it BETTER, it's just one more thing to complain about. If Hollywood (or comics, or anime, or WHATEVER) writers have a great idea for a gay character, or a team that includes a gay character, or whatever else: WRITE THAT STORY. But if you take an EXISTING story and change certain parts to tell a different narrative that you want to tell, then you're a LAZY writer that just wants to appropriate someone else's success/hard work to push a story you're apparently unable to sell on your own.\n\nDisclosure: I HATE fanfic for exactly this reason.\n\nBack to top HyperGatack\n\nJoined: 20 Dec 2006\n\nPosts: 211\n\nLocation: MA\n\nPosted: Tue Mar 21, 2017 11:04 am\n\nAmbimunch wrote:\n\n50% on Rotten Tomatoes lol\n\nThats MUCH higher than I thought it would be at this point.\n\nPersonally, I cant wait to see it.

I don't need a form of escapism to preach any agenda.\n\nI feel sorry for you for saying something like that.\n\nBack to top\n\n@BadNewsBlues Harley was bisexuals since the 47th ep. of Batman TAS in 1993. The Paul Dini written tie-in comic made a VERY clear point on that too and her current book won an LGBT award.\n\nThe Wonder Woman canon was also filled with lesbian subtext, text and full blown bondage play since her inception in 1941 (yes, i read her Golden Age series).\n\nThat was pretty much the reason why US GIs got the comic as part of their care package. Look up who her creator is and whom she is based on, you may learn something. Her wiki entry is even part of the wiki series on LGBT topics. Your augment also makes no sense. The Yellow Ranger was never non-heterosexal before the film but she somehow needs to count more .\n\nDeadpool further starred the biggest R rated film of all time. We can debate his B list status before his film all we want but his 2016 film shook Hollywood to the core. He is literately bigger than R-rated Jesus (!) and Matrix 2. (300 was the first such R-rated comic Block-Buster though and the comic Spartans were very much bisexual and constantly naked.)\n\n2016 was actually a big year for gay superheros in \"features\". Batwoman had her animated debut on the feature length direct to DVD Batman: Bad Blood toon, with her kissing another woman on screen.\n\nCritics can lastly suck it. Power Rangers is clearly inspired by Zack Snyder films and is even openly criticized for it. I love those, so sign me up baby, and i had great fun with the utterly ripped apart Iron Fist over the weekend. Who expected the film to be Gold Certified anyway? It´s Power Ranger!\n\nBack to top\n\nI don't care. They aren't even pushing it in this movie. It seems like a throwaway line only there to show that like everyone else in the team, life ain't easy.\n\nYou guys gotta get over this stuff. If you watch this, I'll bet money right now that there is no secret audio/video stream that's going to turn you gay or something and I doubt there's anything more than a kiss in terms of explicit homosexual content.\n\nThere is a character that is gay. Gay people exist in real life and have existed since the dawn of humans. It isn't some made up concept Hollywood invented. One character is not someone shoving homosexuality down your throat and forcing it on you.\n\nDo you all feel this way about everything? Like there is a black ranger and there's someone black in another movie that's out. Is that Hollywood shoving black people down your throat and pushing an agenda?\n\nBack to top\n\nI have no idea what the first major non-heterosexual charter in a feature comic film is. Some random Japanese Pink film may actually take the cake, because you know... pr0n but what ultimately came to mind is Der bewegte Mann:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_bewegte_Mann\n\nIt was a smash hit (in German speaking countries) in 1994, the film is as gay themed as you can get (still a 12+ over here, just as Power Rangers 2017) and the originating (gay) comic writer is one of the biggest EU comic stars of all time. The most important thing though is that no one cared. The film was just seen as another mass market release. A raunchy comedy about an unusual topic and it delighted the masses. The film even stared the hot new actor of his day (he is still pretty big). That´s it.\n\n1994 also saw the comic doc Crumb. God knows how the sexuality of the 2 central bothers can be defined but the film still found no equal to this day. Look up the Ebert review too.\n\nNo superheroes will be found in either but these 2 must have been a major breakthrough for \"representation\". I will leave it here, so take a few minutes to google the history of comic films. Really weird ones will come up, especially if you go internationally.\n\nBack to top Back to top Topgunguy\n\nJoined: 08 Dec 2015\n\nPosts: 258\n\nPosted: Tue Mar 21, 2017 4:01 pm\n\nThis is Power Rangers, it's not supposed to be a social commentary.

It's also not much of a \"change\" to the character when the originals were all extremely two dimensional sitcom teen stereotypes. Frankly, just the fact that it's not an early 90s saturday morning kid's show anymore means the characterization for everyone is going to be unrecognizable.\n\nBadNewsBlues wrote:\n\nVirtually all depictions of Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn have depicted them as being heterosexual for decades so them being bisexual all of a sudden seems like it was tacked on out of nowhere.\n\nWonder Woman was super queer coded from the get go, her creator was a guy in a poly relationship with two woman and he had a lot of beliefs about female sexual liberation he put in his work. Harley, too, was made canonically gay in the comic book tie in to the 90s animated series by her own creator shortly after her debut.\n\nHowever, it doesn't count for peanuts when that never gets explored in the giant big budget releases. Even characters who are supposedly bisexual tend to be in the \"might as well be straight\" in most of their depictions, hence the not realizing they were queer to begin with. Indeed, even as a bisexual myself aware of the prejudice within the lgbt community towards bi people, ultimately it tends to get reduced to being convenient and lazy queer representation only brought up for jokes and occasionally backstory.\n\nCheezcakeMe wrote:\n\nCongratulations gay and autistic people!
