It helped to shape Hollywood cinema and had a major impact on other cinemas as well. This tried and tested book, popular in college classrooms and among general-interest readers, is the most comprehensive and readable introduction to the history of German cinema, specifically designed to meet the needs of those who want a comprehensible, accessible introduction to the subject. There is no other book that covers the history of German cinema in the same depth and also explores the genesis and meaning of the most important masterpieces in German film history. It does so in chapters devoted to each of thirty-two individual films and in seven interchapters that provide context for historical periods from early German cinema to postunification. The book now appears in an improved, expanded, and up-to-date second edition that covers five additional films, expands the coverage of women's cinema, and brings the history of filmmaking in Germany up to the present moment. The book is specifically designed to appeal to cinema aficionados and for use in college classrooms, where it has been greeted with acclaim by students and teachers alike.\n\nStephen Brockmann is Professor of German at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nIntroduction: Critical Film History and German Studies\n\nPART ONE: EARLY GERMAN FILM HISTORY 1895-1918\n\nEarly German Film History 1895-1918: Historical Overview\n\nDer Student von Prag (1913) and Learning to Look\n\nPART TWO: WEIMAR CINEMA 1919-1933\n\nWeimar Cinema 1919-1933: Historical Overview\n\nDas Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (1920) or Film as Hypnosis\n\nDer letzte Mann (1924) or Learning to Move\n\nDie Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed (1926): The Birth of the Feature-Length Animation Film\n\nMetropolis (1927) or Technology and Sex\n\nDer blaue Engel (1930) and Learning to Talk\n\nM (1931) or Sound and Terror\n\nPART THREE: NAZI CINEMA 1933-1945\n\nNazi Cinema 1933-1945: Historical Overview\n\nTriumph des Willens (1935): Documentary and Propaganda\n\nHallo Janine (1939): Dancing and Singing to Happiness\n\nDie große Liebe (1942) or Love and War\n\nPART FOUR: GERMAN CINEMA AT THE ZERO HOUR 1945-1949\n\nGerman Cinema at the Zero Hour 1945-1949: Historical Overview\n\nDie Mörder sind unter uns (1946): The Rubble Film\n\nPART FIVE: POSTWAR EAST GERMAN CINEMA 1949-1989\n\nPostwar East German Cinema 1949-1989: Historical Overview\n\nSonnensucher (1958) or Searching for the Socialist Sun\n\nSpur der Steine (1966) or Traces of Repression\n\nDie Legende von Paul und Paula (1973) or East Germany in the '70s\n\nSolo Sunny (1980) or Even Socialism Can't Stave Off Loneliness\n\nPART SIX: POSTWAR WEST GERMAN CINEMA 1949-1989\n\nPostwar West German Cinema 1949-1989: Historical Overview\n\nGrün ist die Heide (1951) and the Reinvention of the German Homeland in Living Color\n\nDie Brücke (1959): Film and War\n\nDer junge Törless (1966) or Recapturing Tradition\n\nAguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972): Film and the Sublime\n\nDeutschland im Herbst (1978) or Film and Politics\n\nDie Ehe der Maria Braun (1979) or West Germany Rebuilds\n\nDie Blechtrommel (1979) or Coming to Terms with the Nazi Past\n\nDie bleierne Zeit (1981): Film and Terrorism\n\nMänner (1985) and the New German Film Comedy\n\nDer Himmel über Berlin (1987): Berlin, City of Angels\n\nPART SEVEN: GERMAN FILM AFTER REUNIFICATION 1990-2019\n\nGerman Film after Reunification 1990-2019: Historical Overview\n\nDer bewegte Mann (1994) or West German Self-Absorption\n\nRossini (1997) or West German Self-Absorption Criticized\n\nLola rennt (1998) or Cool Germania\n\nGood Bye Lenin!
