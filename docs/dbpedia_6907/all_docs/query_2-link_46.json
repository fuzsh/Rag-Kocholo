Hardly any of my characters stay. Few arrive where they originally wanted to go. They are rarely happy and settled. They flee from something at times more and at other times less existential. Being on the road is sometimes a burden and sometimes happiness.« (Saša Stanišić, Where You Come From, 2019)\n\nFilmmaker Abozaar Amini was born in Afghanistan. When he was a child, he and his parents migrated to the Netherlands. After graduating, Aboozar moved back to Kabul and founded the production company KINOKABUL, which aims to bring new voices of his generation to the world. He was one of the filmmakers who defied the terror of the Taliban. His films deal with topics such as war and flight, but do not forget to dream of a better future. Maximilian Röttger was the director of the Goethe-Institut Sudan until 2023 when it had to close its office in Khartoum due to the outbreak of the war. Since April 2023, millions of Sudanese had to leave their homes, including many artists and cultural workers. What does exile mean for one’s own artistic practice? How can organizations like Goethe-Institut Sudan continue its work under such circumstances.\n\nA conversation about living and working in exile, the hardships, the opportunities, the search for one's own language in a foreign country and the finding of budgets.\n\nAs part of the Industry Day, we invite you to exchange ideas, discuss and network. Specific challenges of the industry will be put on the table and discussed in six rounds. To participate in the round tables, please register online via our website in the Industry section, indicating the table you would like to attend.\n\nTable 1: How Do I Get Featured?\n\nA round table on the most important questions in the life of a filmmaker: Who will buy my movie and show it? »Hello, my name is Catherine Colas and I work for ZDF/ ARTE. The magazine is called »Kurzschluss«. We only show short films and yes, I do buy films. We talk together about which films and why and how it can become your film. My last co-production is currently screening in competition at Cannes: Rrugës by Kosovan director Samir Karahoda. The next film could be yours. Let's meet!«\n\nHost: Catherine Colas (»Kurzschluss«)\n\nTable 2: Join in! Participation and Mediation at Film Festivals\n\nHow can film festivals create participation and what opportunities for participation are there? Many children's and youth festivals in particular work with different formats to convey the many facets of film festivals to young people. From journalistic projects to moderating, presenting and discussing to film selection and jury work – there are many options for opening up a festival and inviting the (young) audience to participate.\n\nHost: Lili Hartwig (SchulKinoWoche Hamburg, Kurzfilm Agentur)\n\nTable 3: Screening Fees – Let’s Talk About Them\n\nOne topic that often comes up in the time running up to the festival is the question of screening fees for films that are running in competition. For films that are presented in special programs it’s the norm that a fee is paid to the rightsholder. Why isn’t this the case for competition films? We want to talk with filmmakers and festival representatives about the various arguments in favor of or against this. In the end we should ask what a festival can do for you – if it doesn’t pay screening fees.\n\nHost: David Kleingers (DFF – Deutsches Filminstitut & Filmmuseum)\n\nTable 4: What To Do Next\n\nAmos Geva, co-founder and Head of Industry of T-Port, the online platform for short and student films supported by »Media«, talks about this troubling question for young filmmakers. What options for developing new projects best fit who? As a non-profit promoting emerging talent and facilitating the distribution of short films, T-Port is here to help tackle this hot potato. You're not alone.\n\nThis roundtable is presented with the kind support of Creative Europe Desk Hamburg.\n\nHosts: Amos Geva (T-Port) and Lisa Emer (Creative Europe Desk Hamburg)\n\nTable 5: New Insights from Old Educational Films?\n\nAlthough educational films, mostly in the form of 16mm prints, have been omnipresent in schools and political education work for decades, their significance for film and everyday culture has so far been little researched. As part of the »Archive of the Present« this roundtable is about an exchange of experiences on what a fruitful engagement with educational films that have been decommissioned but have not completely disappeared could look like today.\n\nHost: Stephan Ahrens & Julia Eckel (University Paderborn) and Tobias Hering (Curator & Publicist)\n\nTable 6: Archive Is the New Black\n\nGo to the archive: dark, dusty and definitely alone. That was yesterday. Today, working with archives is access to the many and is therefore perceived and supported very differently. At its best, a film archive is a reflection of multi-perspectivity. But it is often marginalized voices that are given space for the first time through the initiative of individuals. How can experience be conveyed to the senses? What does market value mean in the context of such collections? How can access to these archives be created? Maike Mia Höhne explores these questions in conversation with representatives of the Archivo de la Memoria Trans (Argentina) and SIKKA (Sudan).\n\nHost: Maike Mia Höhne (Artistic Director Kurzfilm Festival Hamburg)\n\nAnalogfilmwerke e. V. will lead a workshop for new and seasoned filmmakers alike during the festival. Participants will learn to shoot and hand-process on a mix of Super 8 and 16mm color and B&W positive films. These films will be shot, processed and screened at the festival center all within a three day period. Participation in the workshop is only possible with prior registration via email (morgana@shortfilm.com). The number of participants is limited. A flat-rate fee for materials of € 20 per participant will be charged. Please note that the workshop and the associated results are dependent on your commitment.\n\nParticipation in the workshop requires attendance at all three workshop sessions:\n\nWed, June 5 starting at 12 am\n\nFri, June 7 starting at 12 am\n\nSat, June 8 starting at 12 am\n\nSat, June 8 screening of the results at 23:45\n\nAnalogfilmwerke e.

Or: Flóra Anna Buda – currently the most successful European animation artist. She won the Palme d'Or in Cannes with her last film 27 and went on to win many more awards. »I hope that money, coolness and competition will become less important in our lives«, she said in 2022 and subsequently produced 27. A film that focuses on emotion more than anything else. For Flóra, filmmaking is everything. When she immerses herself in the story, which is not only her story but also our story, she becomes one with the film and one with the world. She lives in both worlds at the same time – proof of the simultaneity of being.\n\nIn conversation with Maike Mia Höhne, Artistic Director of the Kurzfilm Festival Hamburg, she gives us an insight into diving and drawing, developing, living with success, and enduring pressure when something new comes along. Her work is always about experiencing feelings. »It's just nice to focus on these moments«, she says. We think so too and are delighted to be focussing on Flóra Anna Buda in 2024.\n\nHarvard graduate Jennifer Lyon Bell always wanted all films to have longer and more explicit sex scenes. And so, she decided to mix arthouse cinema with hot, explicit sex in her own work. As the founder of Blue Artichoke Films, Jennifer creates erotic fiction and documentary films that explore the captivating, intimate and sometimes delightfully clumsy side of sex. In short, she makes kind of films she herself would most like to see. Her films won numerous international awards at both porn festivals and art film festivals and have been shown in venues ranging from prime-time television to London's Institute of Contemporary Arts. In her popular workshop »From Fantasy to Film« Jennifer Lyon Bell invites participants to creatively explore the following question in a safe, supportive, and fun atmosphere: »If you could only make one erotic/porn film that was completely tailored to what you like in terms of sex, style, characters or anything else, what would it look like?« The workshop begins with a joint viewing of various film examples from the field of »alternative porn«. This gives participants an idea of how different erotic pornographic films can look, both in terms of the cinematic style and the sexualities depicted. Participants then refine their fantasies in individual and group exercises and then record them in a storyboard. Finally, all those who wish to do so are invited to present their work. In addition to inspiration and concrete tips for realisation, the workshop will of course also look at how a film set can create and ensure a »safe space«. Because no matter which fantasy is to be realised on film: only ethical pornography can be really hot!\n\nJennifer Lyon Bell is a Harvard graduate and founder of Blue Artichoke Films.
