Of the three films included in this DVD edition of Abel Ganceâs LucrÃ¨zia Borgia, we are only familiar with the pioneering avant-garde short film La Folie du Docteur Tube, which has been available for several years on public-domain videotapes transferred from tolerable 16mm reduction prints. This edition has been mastered from a tolerable 16mm reduction print as preserved by the CinÃ©mathÃ¨que FranÃ§aise.

The film is presented without any musical accompaniment. The audio tracks are encoded into the disc but there is no music.

We are certain that this DVD will aid viewers in a reassessment of Ganceâs cinematic career.
