        "text": "The French production and distribution company mk2 offers a curated selection of films in its own online magazine TROISCOULEURS in the section “Festival à la Maison”, which is available online free of charge.\n\nEvery Wednesday and for the duration of the national assembly restrictions, the mk2 Curiosity section presents five to six works from its own film catalogue for free access: feature films, short films, making of, documentaries and bonus films that have shaped the history of world cinema.\n\nIn the first round, early or first short films by well-known directors were shown, such as “Ars” by Jacques Demy (1957), “Les Maîtres fous” by Jean Rouch (1957), “L’Amour existe” by Maurice Pialat (1960) or the provocatively brutal anti-Vietnam War film “The Big Shave” by Martin Scorcese (1967). Currently, “Black Panther” by Agnès Varda (1968) can be seen. The films can only be seen for a limited time, but the series will be continued.\n\nThe “Festival à la Maison” is also attended by others with short film offerings, such as the Cinémathèque française. The Cinematheque’s archive initially contributed restored short films by Jean Epstein: “La Chute de la maison Usher” (1928), “La Glace à trois faces” (1927), “Mor’vran – La Mer des corbeaux” (1930) and “Le Tempestaire” (1947).\n\nOn its own platform Henri, the French Cinematheque also showing rarities, curiosities and early avant-garde short films such as the burlesque experimental “La Folie du docteur Tube” by Abel Gance (1915), “Nous, les gitans” by Alberto Spadolini (1950) or the jazz film “Surprise Boogie” by Albert Pierru (1956), scratched directly onto celluloid – a model for Norman McLaren.\n\nThe magazine pages may be confusing, but with a little patience you can discover true pearls of film history or get informed by newsletter.\n\nMagazin Troiscouleur: mk2 Curiosity\n\nMagazin Troiscouleur: Le festival à la maison\n\nPictures"
