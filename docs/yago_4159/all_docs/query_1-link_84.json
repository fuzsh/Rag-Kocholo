        "text": "THERE was a time, not so long ago, when people went to see films that showed nothing more than leaves rustling on a tree or a dog walking down the street or smoke billowing from a chimney. These simple films, many of them made by the Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumiere at the turn of the century, lasted about 90 seconds each and were often shown in rented basement rooms and meeting halls.\n\nThis weekend, these early examples of movie entertainment - and many of the more sophisticated, longer silent films that followed them - will be shown in an ambitious new series at the Museum of Modern Art. Titled ''Rediscovering French Film, Part II,'' the series contains about 150 films to be shown throughout 1983. The entire history of French film is included, stopping just short of the New Wave movement that began around 1960. Part I of the series, which ended last January, covered much the same ground, but in more abbreviated form.\n\nFor the first eight weeks, the series will focus on the silent era, from 1896 to the late 1920's. Stephen Harvey, assistant curator of films at the Modern, hopes the series will help change popular notions about silent films.\n\n''People think of silent films as a primitive form,'' Mr. Harvey said. ''In fact, many silent films reach a level of sophistication in every way as high as the talkies that followed them. I think people will be struck by the warmth, the richness and extraordinary sophistication of these films.''"
