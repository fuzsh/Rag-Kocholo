        "text": "THOUGH NOT QUITE AS EPIC in proportion, the tortuous history of the production, exhibition, and preservation of Napoléon vu par Abel Gance (1927), the most ambitious project of the French silent cinema, mirrors the saga of its protagonist. Few films in the history of cinema have been as haunted by the ghost of a prior existence in some purportedly complete, pristine original form. Gance initially conceived the project as six separate films—spanning Napoleon’s life from boyhood to exile on the isle of Saint Helena—but only completed the first. Of taxing length and daunting screening demands, the film suffered multiple abridgments and for decades was considered just another casualty of the abuses and shortcomings of the film industry and of the institutions designed to preserve its heritage. But with the restoration project begun in 1969 by the filmmaker and historian Kevin Brownlow, the history of Napoléon (as the film would henceforth be known) took a fortuitous turn.\n\nGance is the sole European director to warrant a chapter in The Parade’s Gone By . . ., Brownlow’s celebrated 1968 study of Hollywood silent cinema, and the author even dedicates the book to Gance as the man who “made a fuller use of the medium than anyone before or since.” Quibble one might, but not about the worthiness of Brownlow’s forty-year struggle to restore a film that, judging from (often conflicting) accounts of its various early appearances, may well never have been seen in its entirety with its renowned triptych scenes intact. According to the historian of French cinema Richard Abel, even at its premiere at the Paris Opéra in 1927, Napoléon was condensed to less than half its length, and when it was screened in its six-hour entirety months later, it was without the triptych sequence—the film’s most salient feature, as well as a major reason it has been projected only in abridged or butchered versions over the years.\n\nAlthough the project was initially embraced by adventurous producers, Gance lost their support, not only because he exhausted on one film the funds intended for all six, but also because the producers objected to his artistic license with history—as the film’s original title suggests—and his indulgence in experimental techniques without regard for commercial appeal. Purchased by MGM, Napoléon was shown in several European cities, after which it was cut to roughly seventy-five minutes, without the triptych section, and then left in vaults, all but forgotten. After years of research at various film archives, including the National Film Archive in Britain, and further years of fund-raising and restoration work, Brownlow presented a long but still incomplete version—watched by the eighty-nine-year-old Gance from a hotel window—outdoors at the 1979 Telluride Film Festival. This was followed by the first screening with a live orchestra, conducted by composer Carl Davis, at London’s Empire Theater in 1980, and then a second at New York’s Radio City Music Hall in 1981, under the auspices of Francis Ford Coppola and accompanied by a score composed and conducted live by Coppola’s father, Carmine. Those in attendance on that occasion, including this writer, were duly impressed by the event and by the sheer chutzpah of Gance’s fusion of grandiosity and experimentalism, despite the fact that Coppola had cut between twenty and fifty minutes (depending on projection speed) from the existing footage to accommodate a four-hour running time.\n\nIn March of this year, the third full-scale restoration of Napoléon, first shown in London in 2000 (only to be shelved over legal issues), will have its American premiere as a special presentation of the San Francisco Silent Film Festival at Oakland’s Para­mount Theatre—itself a restored Art Deco marvel—accompanied by the Davis score conducted live by the composer. This event is of singular importance: First, because the version being screened is the most complete to date to include the film’s triple-screen sequence; second, because no future screenings or road shows are planned; and third, because, rumors to the contrary, neither a DVD nor a Blu-ray of this version is in the works (costs being prohibitive). This restoration runs approximately five and a half hours, about ninety-five minutes longer than the one shown in New York in 1981. According to Brownlow’s partner, Patrick Stanbury, half of those extra minutes are additional footage, and half are the result of projecting the film at the correct—which means slower—speed. Previously lost scenes have been restored, and footage of better quality replaces former footage. All title cards were remade to match the style of the original, and new tinting reproduces the original effects.\n\nThough the restoration of any film of such repute is a worthy endeavor, the question of Napoléon’s merits weighed against other films of the period is not irrelevant. And while Napoléon’s absence from many all-time-best lists may be attributed to its incomplete status, scholars routinely include on such lists Erich von Stroheim’s Greed (1924), which also exists in truncated form, a fraction of its original length. This may be because, unlike Greed, Gance’s film bears a hybrid aesthetic, welding epic aspirations and populist sentiment to avant-garde tendencies. Rife with the innovative editing and optical techniques Gance had employed in the surrealist La Folie du Docteur Tube (1915), the film also resorts to narrative clichés and established uses of mise-en-scène. The bold style the director displays in J’accuse (1919) and La Roue (1923) notwithstanding, subtler acting and psychologically richer narratives mark many European and American films of the period—from the poignantly etched character portraits in Carl Dreyer’s historically ambitious Leaves from Satan’s Book (1921) to the psychological sophistication of Stroheim’s The Merry Widow (1925) to the intense lyricism of F. W. Murnau’s Sunrise (1927). In fairness, if Gance had been able to make the other five parts of his saga, he might have cultivated greater complexity and nuance; for, once he had the “great man of destiny” theme in place, he would have been free to develop other aspects of his hero’s character and life.\n\nBut in the film we have, bravura sequences alternate with more conventional ones. For example, the carefully staged Siege of Toulon, a sequence designed to illustrate Lieutenant Colonel Bonaparte’s intuitive military genius, is less impressive now than it must have been in 1927. Though Gance filmed it on location and grounded the scene in the historical record—the nighttime maneuvers and Napoléon’s clash with senior officers occurring amid punishing winds and rain—the sequence bogs down, much like the soldiers loading and firing cannons while mired in mud. In the 1981 version, at least, certain scenes proceed without transitions, which may be a product of missing footage, or a reflection of a style that assumes audience familiarity with famous events. The improved intertitles promised in the newest version may clarify this.\n\nIn contrast, the film’s most effective scenes are driven by creative cinematography and dynamic, rapid editing. Gance attached cameras not only to technicians’ hands and bodies but to objects, horses, and running actors—long before lightweight cameras existed. Perspectives are unhampered by such minor obstacles as gravity and the sea: Images are shot underwater and from a pendulum swinging across an open space. When not immersing the spectator in what might otherwise be a static experience, the editing implants an idea through insistent crosscutting or simply revels in the possibilities of expanding the filmic experience in defiance of its two-dimensionality. Gance has a cubistic tendency to divide the screen into multiple squares or verticals and to use triple screens to project different images on the right and left, flanking a critical center. His vision of a bigger, deeper, wider, all-embracing cinema not only foresaw such technical developments as CinemaScope and Cinerama but seems driven by a desire to transcend screens and prosceniums altogether.\n\nA vital example of the immersion effect is the opening snowball-fight sequence, once believed lost. It begins with an alternation of close-ups with medium and long shots, establishing the positions of two groups of boys as if they were enemy soldiers hunkered down behind defensive barriers. As the fight continues, the cutting gets faster, and our ability to distinguish sides becomes increasingly impaired. The rapid cutting whips static shots and handheld shots into a blend, then an impressionistic mélange, comparable in musical terms to the reeling melodies and whirling tonalities of the final third of Ravel’s La Valse, 1920. Although the new version, according to Stanbury, will present this sequence at a slower speed than previously, it will still be faster than the projection speed for the rest of the film, thus hardly diminishing the effect. Indeed, given Gance’s view of cinema as a fusion of the arts, he no doubt sought such analogies. Unfortunately, the impact of the sequence in the 1981 version is undermined by the Coppola score, whose drum-propelled beat, though designed to stress the fight as a harbinger of young Napoléon’s military savvy, flattens the imaginative potential of the filmic dynamics. Based on the fifty-minute sample I have heard, the Davis score is more varied, incorporating tarantella-like folk melodies for the Corsican sequence and passages from Beethoven’s Third (initially dedicated to Bonaparte) and Sixth Symphonies, among other musical quotations.\n\nEditing that suggests ideas, earlier deployed by Griffith but most prevalent in the silent era in the work of Russian filmmakers Kuleshov, Eisenstein, Pudovkin, and Dovzhenko, is evident in the lengthy sequence in which scenes from the Revolution’s turbulent National Convention in Paris are crosscut with shots of a lone Napoléon (Albert Dieudonné) braving a storm in a small boat between Corsica and the French mainland. As the waves toss his vessel to and fro, the camera, mounted on a pendulum, swoops back and forth across the Convention Hall from above, grazing the angry, restless crowd below. (Gance may have been inspired by the aerial shots in E. A. Dupont’s Varieté, of 1925.) The idea implanted, as yet unfathomed by either Napoléon or the crowd, is that this little-known figure will become the nation’s stabilizing force, steering aright the ship of state just as he negotiates his boat through the tempest. The motif of one who sees everything from a higher perspective with an unerring eye is embodied from the beginning in Napoléon’s pet eagle, whose image is often superimposed directly over his face.\n\nThe image of Napoléon in this sequence follows others that likewise frame him as the anchored center of a frenzied context: whether sitting alone, reflecting in his room, as the chaos of the Terror rages about him; or in contrast to the instantly telegraphed portraits of an impassioned, wild-haired Danton (Alexandre Koubitzky), a sinister-seeming Robespierre behind dark glasses (Edmond Van Daële), and an edgy, morose-looking Marat (Antonin Artaud). This motif informs an invented sequence placed just before the Italian campaign near the end. Before leaving Paris, Napoléon stops at the darkened Convention Hall; as he scans the rows of empty seats, they suddenly fill with ghostlike figures of the convention’s members, superimposed with images of Danton, Robespierre, Marat, and Saint-Just (played by Gance), who direct him to spread the Revolution’s spirit throughout Europe and not to betray those who died for the cause. This scene not only proposes wholesale absolution for the cruel excesses of these figures—contradicting, for example, the image of a mercenary Saint-Just presented earlier—but it assures the viewer, through an intertitle, of Napoléon’s noble intentions to liberate oppressed people and suppress frontiers, no doubt ensuring the film’s appeal to nationalist sentiments.\n\nThe most innovative and exciting part of the film is the triptych sequence. As the image of Napoléon riding out to lead the armies in the Italian campaign recedes, the screen suddenly triples in width, and the thrill of Gance’s vision still produces goose bumps. Nor does he fail to exploit the effect to the fullest. At first, the three screens compose a unified image—a panorama of the entire French army encamped in the mountains over Piedmont. This view varies when Napoléon appears in the left panel addressing the men below him and in the two screens to the right. Gance then uses the three screens to triple the possibilities of montage: A close-up of Napoléon in the center is flanked by sheer open sky on either side, the latter giving way to shots of marching men to the left and right. Even Joséphine, whom he married quickly before leaving for Italy, and to whom he writes a wrenching letter before going into battle, gets into the picture. She appears in each panel in turn, at one point superimposed on an image of Napoléon and a map of Italy (as earlier she was superimposed on a globe), conflating the man’s personal preoccupations with his—no doubt grandiose—military ambitions. Her sustained presence in such a context exemplifies Gance’s idea of using the triptych to juxtapose “the physiological, the cerebral, and the emotional.”\n\nEventually, the imagery on all three screens is exchanged more rapidly: Marching men on left and right look up at the sky and are replaced by a soaring eagle in the center, whose wings soon spread across all three panels. Is it any wonder that, at a screening in 1927, a young officer named Charles de Gaulle reportedly stood up and cheered when the three screens became the French tricolor? Based on the rousing response I witnessed in 1981, I imagine the presentation at the Paramount Theatre will elicit similar enthusiasm, if not quite for the same reasons that moved de Gaulle.\n\nMore reflectively, anyone interested in film history may discern in Gance’s film an urtext of the silent cinema’s aspirations to break free of its limits. The absence of sound was the most immediate of these, but in a very real way what Napoléon demonstrates, quite apart from its merits, its limitations, and its value as history, is that the visual language of the silent cinema—which became richer and more sophisticated as the 1920s came to a close—was an art form of infinite possibilities, to be left unrealized.\n\nAbel Gance’s Napoléon will be presented at the Paramount Theatre, Oakland, CA, March 24, 25, and 31 and April 1.\n\nTony Pipolo is the author of Robert Bresson: A Passion for Film (Oxford University Press, 2010)."
