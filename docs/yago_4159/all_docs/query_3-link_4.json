        "text": "The restoration of J’ACCUSE is a joint project of Lobster Film Studios, Paris, and the Netherlands Filmmuseum with invaluable support from film historians Kevin Brownlow, David Shepard and Lenny Borger. The restoration process began by gathering and analyzing all existing film elements in an effort to duplicate the original version as closely as possible. The Netherlands Filmmuseum holds an original tinted and toned nitrate copy in its collection, the only known surviving color version of the film. This print was the source for the color information seen in the present reconstruction. Whenever possible, nitrate prints were the source for digital scanning, allowing for pristine photographic quality.\n\nThis French-titled edition contains many original art cards with optional English subtitles. There are many extras prepared exclusively for this release; the included booklet contains an extensive essay by celebrated author (The Parade’s Gone By…), director and film historian Kevin Brownlow who conducted the 1980 reconstruction of Gance’s NAPOLEON. Brownlow draws from his research and personal interviews with Gance. Paired with Brownlow’s essay is an additional work from historian Leslie K. Hankins, analyzing the potential influence J’ACCUSE had on the works of Virginia Woolf as well as its lasting impact on artists today. The Netherlands Filmmuseum also provides details on the film’s restoration.\n\nTwo short films are also included, courtesy of the Blackhawk Films and Lobster Films collections’: 1915’s PARIS PENDANT LA GUERRE (PARIS DURING THE WAR) takes a comical look at Parisian life during wartime and features a newly-recorded Fotoplayer score; and FIGHTING THE WAR (1916), featuring amazing frontline photography of French soldiers, shot during the battle of Verdun by adventurer Donald C. Thompson."
