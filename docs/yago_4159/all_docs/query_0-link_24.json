Simply put, the film concerns a doctor, his wife, and his brother. The doctor, a specialist in pediatrics, has no time for his wife Marthe. She seeks solace in the arms of his brother.

The way in which Gance visually communicates his story is extremely sophisticated for the era, showing the influence of Griffith but taking it to a…\n\nIn a philosophical sense, this could perhaps be considered The First Sound Film, the Original Talkie - let me explain:\n\nWhat I mean to say is that Abel Gance understood the fundamentally dangerous notion of storytelling and melodrama falling in the way of craft (as opposed to some symbiotic notion, or preferably a notion which allowed one to stand separate from the other), and specifically (it seems) understood that the presence of audible dialogue in films would not only limit their visual scope but also assist in shifting cinema's focus even further from the image to the story - it's no coincidence that Mater Dolorosa's release coincides with the immense surge in popularity of D.W.
