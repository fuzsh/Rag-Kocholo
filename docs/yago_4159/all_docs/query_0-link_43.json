Is there a silent movie you’d like to see me review? This is your chance!\n\nYou are free to request any silent films you like and second other requests. I will choose four or five titles and review them in January. It’s fun and often leads me to movies that I would not have discovered on my own.\n\nI generally try to strike a balance between the famous and the obscure, big stars and forgotten players, Hollywood and foreign fare. In other words, I’m pretty much open to anything I haven’t reviewed yet. Go ahead and leave a comment with your choice(s) and thanks in advance! Here’s to another great event.\n\n☙❦❧\n\nLike what you’re reading? Please consider sponsoring me on Patreon.
