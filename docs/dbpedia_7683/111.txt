Dreams are sequences of worlds with different Images, thoughts & scenarios which appear during sleep.

​

ASSOCIATION

The association with Dream Cerberus & this brand is that the three heads of Cerberus represent things I have seen & dreamt being acted out in the present & shared with the public in the future so this is me acting as Hades by ordering Cerberus (past present & future) to invite the audience to my very own mental underworld.
