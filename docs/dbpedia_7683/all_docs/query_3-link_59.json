        "text": "The Heracles’ Twelfth Labor\n\nThe children of Typhon and Echidna are usually known for their battles with Greek heroes, in which the heroes win, and the monsters die. Cerberus’ encounter with Heracles, the greatest Greek hero of all time, made him a household name. At the time, Heracles was serving King Eurystheus. It had been given a list of difficult tasks (labors) to perform by the king of Tiryns. Finally, Heracles was tasked with rescuing Cerberus from Hades, his twelfth and final labor.\n\nHeracles And Cerberus\n\nHeracles bravely went into the Underworld, and Charon was forced to ferry him across the river Acheron. Heracles went to the deity’s palace and spoke to Hades and his wife Persephone rather than facing the wrath of the great god Hades. Cerberus was allowed to return to the Underworld once Heracles had obtained permission from Hades to have him removed, provided his hound was not hurt in the process. To subdue Cerberus, Heracles put his weapons to one side and engaged the Hound of Hades head-on. Cerberus finally bowed to Heracles’ will after Heracles put him in a choke grip.\n\nIs Cerberus a Benevolent or Malevolent Figure\n\nCerberus appears in a wide variety of literary genres. Cerberus is mentioned in the book “Dante’s Inferno” as a guardian of Hell’s third circle. Cerberus has been referenced in ancient literature and art throughout the ages. Greco-Roman art frequently depicted him also. The beast first appears on a Laconian cup dating from the early sixth century BC. The capture of Cerberus on Attic vases was widespread in Greece. However, it was often represented alongside Hercules’ other tasks in Rome. However, Cerberus was considered a benevolent being, despite his nickname as the “hellhound.” Cerberus’ job was often portrayed as a protector of the Gates of Hell from undesirable invaders and keeping the dead from fleeing as the watchdog of the Underworld.\n\nAccording to Greek mythology, Cerberus is one of the greatest mythological beings and played a key role in guarding the Gates of Hell."
