        "text": "In Greek mythology, Cerberus was the monstrous watchdog of the underworld, or the land of the dead ruled by Hades. The fearsome dog was usually said to have three heads, though the ancient poet Hesiod wrote that he had 50 heads. Heads of snakes grew from Cerberus’s back. He had a serpent’s tail. The parents of Cerberus were the monsters Typhon and Echidna.\n\nCerberus devoured anyone who tried to escape from the underworld. He also prevented living humans from entering the land of the dead. In one myth, however, the living hero Orpheus was able to pass into the underworld by charming Cerberus with music. One of the 12 labors of the warrior Heracles (Hercules) was to bring Cerberus up to the land of the living. After he did so, Heracles returned the creature to the underworld."
