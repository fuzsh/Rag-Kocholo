        "text": "May 25, 2021\n\n3.5★\n\nThis was certainly different!\n\n& I have sat in front of my laptop for quite a while now, trying to think of what else to write!\n\nYes, we may have seen this done better but this was a very early dystopian novel & Francis Stevens (real name Gertrude Barrows Bennett) was a fresh & vital voice, writing in a genre that in those days had very few women authors- in fact Stevens was one of the first.\n\nStevens bio on Goodreads gives the sparse details that are known of her life - I would certainly like to know why her writing career was so short, why she (effectively) abandoned her daughter (not too surprisingly they became estranged) &, above all what happened to Stevens later in life. She was originally believed to have died in 1939 (the last time her daughter had contact from her) but a death certificate was found - & that says 1948. More googling is required.\n\nSo I enjoyed Viola, Terry & Roberts travelling into the future. Stevens created a very vivid fantasy world in Ulithia & a 2118 Philadelphia. Stevens shone with dialogue - hot tempered Terry in particular just jumped off the page.\n\nI would be happy to read more of Stevens work, but dystopia & longer science fiction aren't really my genre & I won't be in a rush.\n\nA biography of the enigmatic Stevens - well that is another matter!\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/view/carolshess...\n\nApril 19, 2022\n\nThis is a proto-SF novel from 1919 (assuming that ‘real’ SF starts with Hugo Gernsback and his Astounding Stories as well as the term itself, for say H.G. Wells’s novels were scientific romance). I read it as a part of monthly reading for April 2022 at The Evolution of Science Fiction group.\n\nThe story starts with one of the characters, Robert Drayton, waking up with a bloody wound on his head next to an open safe. It turns out that he is in the apartment of his friend, burly Irishman Terry Trenmore. As we find out, Robert is a lawyer, whose career was destroyed by an evil corporation (yes, this trope of a lot of modern SF isn’t that new), while Terry is an accidental owner of a vial filled to the top with some substance of the color of gray emery, with Cerberus’ heads: 'Said to have been carved by Benvenuto Cellini for his patron, the Duke of Florence. Its contents have never been examined. The legend runs, however, that the gray dust within it was gathered from the rocks at the gates of Purgatory by the poet Dante, and that it was to contain this dust that the duke required the vial.’ As they (inevitably for such stories) come in contact with the contents, they, together with the third character, Viola Trenmore, Terry’s beautiful sister, are transferred initially to a dreamlike realm and then to the future, which, despite the year (2118, I guess the date hints on when the story was written +200 years) is quite like their present-day in terms of closes and machines, but turns quite different in some other qualities.\n\nPartly an easy-going adventure story with valorous and brave heroes, partly a comment on possible political developments, this is a good yarn, but nothing that one may plan to re-read.\n\nApril 23, 2022\n\nThe Heads of Cerberus is a 1919 scientific fiction novel where after inhaling a grey dust, people are transported from Philadelphia hundreds of years into the future to a dystopian society that exists in the same location. This book is notable because it was a pioneer for time travel/ parallel worlds.\n\nIt didn’t deliver the sci-fi, time travel adventure that I was expecting. It lacked the science-based element, therefore, it felt more like fantasy to me. And that would have been alright had it not been for the underdeveloped characters (Terry, Bobby, Viola) and stilted, dated, or melodramatic dialogue. This book is just under two hundred pages, yet I struggled to finish half of it, skimming at times. I kept trying until my library loan expired, and I decided to move on. In the half of the book that I read; I didn’t learn but a scant more than I knew from the book’s description.\n\nI would think that some world building would take place by the halfway point. There were no techy gadgets mentioned. Everything seemed the same except for a new political system and a violent concern about the visiting trio not wearing their “buttons.” However, Viola is adored by all the males, which is creepy since she is 17 and they are older adults. ‘... so tiny, azure eyes…. curling lashes…modish hat….;” she was like a blue bird, fluttering in from the sunshine.”\n\nSince the first hundred pages of this book didn’t bring me any reading joy, I couldn't justify renewing my loan to finish it. I think it is safe to say that this is not the classic sci-fi I am seeking. Although, I can acknowledge its contribution to the parallel world concept.\n\nSeptember 24, 2015\n\nThough little read and seldom discussed today, in the late teens and early 1920s, Minneapolis-born Francis Stevens was something of a cause célèbre among discriminating readers. \"Francis Stevens\" was the pen name of Gertrude Barrows Bennett, who published her first story in 1917 at the age of 33. Her career as a writer only lasted six years, during which time she produced six novels and three short stories, and she only took to writing in the first place after becoming a widow, as a means of supporting her young daughter and invalid mother. Her work initially appeared in pulp periodicals such as \"All-Story Weekly\" and \"The Argosy,\" readers of which believed the name \"Francis Stevens\" to be a pseudonym for the great Abraham Merritt, who indeed was a fan of hers. And Merritt wasn't the only famous writer to sing her praises; no less a figure than H.P. Lovecraft, in a letter to \"The Argosy\" regarding Stevens' first novel, 1918's \"The Citadel of Fear,\" remarked, \"Stevens, to my mind, is the highest grade of your writers,\" and sci-fi critic Sam Moskowitz has since referred to her as \"the most gifted woman writer of science fiction and science-fantasy between Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and C.L. Moore.\" My first exposure to Stevens was via \"The Citadel of Fear,\" after coming across a very laudatory review of it in Cawthorn & Moorcock's \"Fantasy: The 100 Best Books.\" As I later wrote of that dark fantasy, it had dealt with the discovery of the lost city of Tlapallan and \"a whole slew of nightmare creatures, battling Aztec gods, indoor swamps, and on and on.\" And as it turns out, Stevens' next novel, 1919's \"The Heads of Cerberus,\" which first appeared in the August to October issues of \"The Thrill Book,\" netting Stevens around $750, is yet another winning creation from this wonderful author.\n\nAs in \"The Citadel of Fear,\" our heroes here are an American and an Irishman. After lawyer Bob Drayton is framed and disbarred, he falls on very hard times, and in desperation and half starvation, decides to burgle a house in Philadelphia. By a million to one chance, the house he happens to break into belongs to his old crony, a huge Irish adventurer named Terry Trenmore. The Irishman, it seems, has also come into some trouble lately. After winning a curio at auction--a glass vial with a Cerberus head, supposedly containing dust from the gates of Purgatory that had been collected by the poet Dante himself--several threats and violent attacks on his person had resulted. The two decide to unstopper the vial and examine the dust, and--along with Trenmore's beautiful, 17-year-old sister, Viola--are instantaneously transported to an otherworldly realm called Ulithia. And then things become even more problematic for our trio. After walking through the so-called Gate of the Moon, they appear back in Philadelphia...but in the year 2118! The city is now a totalitarian state, and the three are promptly arrested for not wearing their number badges on their lapels! (No names for the citizens here; only numbers. Anyone remember the classic BBC program \"The Prisoner\"?)\n\nYes, \"The Heads of Cerberus\" IS most assuredly an early dystopian novel, as well as having been called, by sci-fi author and critic P. Schuyler Miller, \"perhaps the first work of fantasy to envisage the parallel-time-track concept.\" But despite the fact that the bulk of the novel transpires in the year 2118--200 years after the time of its creation--it is never better than in that Ulithia segment, which takes up only 20 pages. Here, Stevens manages to conjure up a decidedly outré atmosphere, and the ruinous castle, living (but untenanted!) suits of armor, faceless dancers, living cobwebs, whispering and red-eyed shadows, and the ghostly, singing White Weaver that our trio encounters therein are all wonderfully described. In perhaps the book's finest single moment, Drayton, newly arrived and alone in Ulithia, flings \"out his arms in a gesture of despair,\" and the reader senses his awe at the cosmic mystery into which he has been thrust. Stevens uses the futuristic-Philadelphia section to examine a form of leadership that Terry later describes as \"a new low in autocratic government.\" Thus, high positions in the city council--the so-called Penn Service--are won by entering a peculiar series of games; rigged games, of course. The common citizens--the Numbers--are allowed to enter, but losers in these contests are summarily thrown into a spear-lined pit in the City Hall, a natural discouragement to participation! Our trio decides to enter this contest, each of them running for a different office. It is a truly nightmarish scenario, and the Numbers whom we encounter do seem to be a thoroughly demoralized and downtrodden bunch.\n\nStevens, to her credit, manages to keep her story taut and suspenseful, at the same time that she injects pleasing snippets of humor here and there, mainly thanks to the character of Arnold Bertram, a portly thief who had tried to rifle Trenmore's safe back home and had also been thrown into the year 2118 as a result. The author presciently posits the coming of a second World War, and yet her Philadelphia of two centuries hence still somehow contains \"clanging street cars,\" shooting galleries, and \"movie\" theaters. (I love the fact that Stevens puts the word \"movie\" in quotes; first used around 1911, it must have still seemed a newish, slangy word by 1918!) A pseudo-scientific explanation, at the novel's end, for all the mishegas that had come before goes far in claiming for the book its place of pride in the early sci-fi field. If Stevens' work here can be charged with a fault, however, it is its use of not just coincidence, but double coincidence: Besides the staggering one that opens the book (Drayton just happening to choose to rob a house that, unbeknownst to him, belongs to an old friend), we also have Bertram choosing--of all the hotel rooms in 22nd century Philly--our trio's hotel room to rob after he arrives! Once the reader manages to overlook these minor matters, however, a most entertaining and atmospheric read will be in store.\n\nFurther good news regarding \"The Heads of Cerberus\" is that the novel is available today via Dover Books, reasonably priced, and with a very informative introduction by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach and charming illustrations by Ric Binkley. It is a reprint of the 1952 Polaris Press edition, in which \"The Heads of Cerberus\" first (and probably last, prior to this) appeared in book form. Francis Stevens, I am happy to say, is now a very solid 2 for 2 with me. And I have a feeling that once I finish her 1920 novel \"Claimed\"--which supposedly deals with an Atlantean relic belched out of the sea after a volcanic eruption--she will be an even more solid 3 for 3....\n\n(This review, by the way, originally appeared on the FanLit website --www.fantasyliterature.com -- a most excellent destination for all fans of Francis Stevens....)\n\nNovember 6, 2021\n\nΤέταρτο συνεχόμενο βιβλίο δια χειρός γυναίκας που διαβάζω μέσα στον μήνα, ήταν και αυτό πολύ καλό, ενδιαφέρον και ιδιαίτερο. Το \"Φράνσις Στίβενς\" είναι το ψευδώνυμο της Γκέρτρουντ Μπάροουζ Μπένετ, που ήταν από τις πρώτες σημαντικές συγγραφείς του Φανταστικού στις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες, της οποίας όμως η συγγραφική παρουσία κράτησε ελάχιστα χρόνια, ουσιαστικά από το 1917 έως και το 1920, ενώ μετά απλώς εξαφανίστηκε! Αργώ να μπω στο ψητό, αλλά η περίπτωση της συγκεκριμένης γυναίκας μου φαίνεται πολύ ενδιαφέρουσα, και πραγματικά απορώ πώς έτυχε να μεταφραστεί φέτος ένα όχι και τόσο πολυδιαβασμένο μυθιστόρημα, όπως το συγκεκριμένο. Πάντως, χαίρομαι που ήρθε και στην Ελλάδα, μιας και μου άρεσε πολύ. Βέβαια, σαν γραφή και σαν ιστορία ίσως να μην είναι για όλα τα γούστα, γιατί γέρνει αρκετά προς το παλπ (και μάλιστα το παλιομοδίτικο παλπ), προσωπικά όμως το ευχαριστήθηκα σε μεγάλο βαθμό, κατάφερε να διατηρήσει το ενδιαφέρον μου από την πρώτη μέχρι την τελευταία σελίδα, και ουσιαστικά το τελείωσα σε δυο μεγάλες καθισιές. Η γραφή μου φάνηκε πολύ καλή (και κάπως ευχάριστα παλιομοδίτικη), χωρίς φιοριτούρες και πολυλογίες, οι χαρακτήρες χωρίς ιδιαίτερο βάθος αλλά οπωσδήποτε λειτουργικοί, και η ατμόσφαιρα σαφώς εξαιρετική. Φυσικά, κάποια \"γιατί\" και \"πώς\" στην πλοκή και την όλη κοσμοπλασία μάλλον δεν βρίσκουν απάντηση, ενώ η συγγραφέας δεν πείθει απόλυτα σε όλα τα σημεία για τα διάφορα που συμβαίνουν, όμως τέτοια βιβλία για να τα απολαύσεις και να μην τα πάρεις στραβά, πρέπει απλά να είσαι χαλαρός και όχι... στριμμένος. Εγώ το ευχαριστήθηκα! Και μακάρι να μεταφραζόταν κάποια στιγμή και το \"The Citadel of Fear\", για το οποίο έγραψε ενθαρρυντικά λόγια και ο πολύς Χ. Φ. Λάβκραφτ.\n\nJune 3, 2019\n\nFirst tale of alternate universes? A logical progression of The Time Machine by H.G. Wells? A tale of strange time distortion, at any rate.\n\nAn enjoyable, solid, fun read of twisted, dark events. A stranger with mysterious demands. A vial of gray powder. A friendship lasting beyond space and time. FREAKING DYSTOPIAN FASCISTS. I was played like a harp.\n\nAn excellent read. Recommend if you like early SF/science fantasy, or if you liked Time and Again.\n\nMay 22, 2022\n\nMagic dust leads to a dystopia in this early science fiction work by stenographer and part time writer Gertrude Barrows Bennett.\n\nIt starts with intrigue and unknown plots to acquire the Heads of Cerberus, a pocket size artifact that contains some magic dust, though the story takes a few chapters to get to this point. After that the story is equal parts weird worlds and social commentary, with more science fiction that other contemporary stories.\n\nLike \"The Time Machine\", there is a bit of lecturing, especially at the end. Overall, a solid story, and the dystopia feels contemporary. A quote from the book, describing said world:\n\n\"They curtailed the education of the people as needless and too expensive. When the people complained, they placated them by abolishing all grades above the primary and turning the schools into dance halls and free moving-picture theaters.\"\n\nApril 6, 2022\n\nPure pulp entertainment. If you are looking for something deep, you won't find it here. But this is a fun adventure story. Three people find themselves thrust into a future dystopia, fix the problem (more-or-less), then go home. Not much unlike a Doctor Who episode. The way that they are sent to the future feels like fantasy, but in the end it is given a semi-scientific explanation that invokes a concept similar to many-worlds quantum mechanics, but without mentioning quantum mechanics at all. (It does talk about electrons, which were discovered less than 10 years earlier.)\n\nI suppose the reason this was re-published in 2019 is because it is a supposedly rare example of a woman writing SF in 1919. But it isn't that rare, really. At a similar time these women were also publishing SF/F books: Rose Macaulay, Cicely Hamilton, Pauline Elizabeth Hopkins, Charlotte Perkins Gilman.\n\nLike I said, it is pure pulp. But there is nothing wrong with that! I may try to read some of her other books.\n\nNovember 3, 2021\n\nΘαυμάζω και υποκλίνομαι στη δύναμη της φαντασίας και της ικανότητας δημιουργίας ουτοπικών κόσμων που πολλοί συγγραφείς έχουν.\n\nΗ Francis Stevens εμπνεύστηκε ένα δυστοπικό μυθιστόρημα προπομπό του dark fantasy. Γραμμένο το 1919, έχει χαρακτηριστεί πλέον κλασικό, ενορατικό, σιβυλλικό, για ένα μέλλον δυσοίωνο.\n\nΈνα ταξίδι στο μέλλον. Από τη Φιλαδέλφεια του 1918, τρεις φίλοι μεταφέρονται, 200 χρόνια μετά, σε μια κοινωνία απολυταρχικής διακυβέρνησης.\n\nΗ Βαϊόλα, ο αδερφός της Τέρι και ο φίλος του Ρόμπερτ, έρχονται αντιμέτωποι με ανθρώπους απονομωμένους και αποκομμένους από τον υπόλοιπο κόσμο.\n\nΠολίτες που πλέον δεν έχουν όνομα μα έναν αριθμό, είναι οι Αριθμοί. Τα χρήματα έχουν καταργηθεί, η Υπηρεσία Πεν αξιολογεί την εργασία των πολιτών και οι εργατοώρες είναι το νέο νόμισμα.\n\nΌπως σε κάθε απολυταρχικό καθεστώς, την εξουσία έχει μια μικρή ομάδα ανθρώπων, την οποία εξασφάλισαν και εδραίωσαν δημιουργώντας πολίτες απαίδευτους, κατευθυνόμενους, δουλικούς και φοβισμένους, καθότι βάση αυτής της εξουσίας και μοχλός πίεσης είναι η πρόκληση τρόμου, ο συναισθηματικός εκφοβισμός και η επίκληση στο θρησκευτικό συναίσθημα επιβάλλοντας έναν κυβερνήτη-Θεό.\n\nΜια σαθρή, διεφθαρμένη εξουσία που λειτουργεί με στοιχεία νεποτισμού και διαπλοκής.\n\nΗ φαντασία, η μεταφυσική και η επιστήμη συνδυάζονται και ένα συναρπαστικό μυθιστόρημα δημιουργείται, καταγγελτικό για τις συνθήκες εργασίας, τη θέση της γυναίκας στην κοινωνία, το σαπρό πολιτικό και οικονομικό σύστημα, τη θρησκευτική πίστη.\n\nAugust 15, 2016\n\nStevens had a surprisingly short career, nearly all his fantastical fiction appearing over a period of about five years in the 1910s-20s. More surprising still, he never existed!\n\nFrancis Stevens was the pen name of Gertrude Barrows Bennett, the first major American woman author of fantasy. (Her true name was not released until the late '40s.) Appealing to a largely male audience in magazines such as Argosy, she delivers the expected brawny masculine characters and plotting, plus the usual gorgeous young thing thrown in as love interest – though her few female characters are strong and determined, and her male-bonding is especially effective.\n\nBennett is sometimes touted as in the inventor of \"dark fantasy,\" and Cerberus as the first dystopian novel; the work is actually a strange mixture of the two, with a bit of mad scientist thrown in. Perhaps there's too much going on with the changes in scene and atmosphere, and coincidence sometimes runs amuck, but the characters hold up and the writing is striking – especially in its arch skewering of pomp and ruling-class viciousness.\n\nGiant Irishman Terry Trenmore, his sister Viola, and lawyer-temporarily-turned-petty-crook Bob Drayton are unwittingly transported by a powder in an ancient phial (ornamented with the three heads of Cerberus) to the unpeopled, decadent plains of an almost-Earth, where the crumbled stone walls of day regrow themselves into full castles by night. From there they are channelled to Philadelphia – from whence they started – but 200 years in the future.\n\nRoughly half the book takes places in Philly's immense city hall, now transformed into the Temple of an all-controlling oligarchy that runs the city, which – like all others throughout the splintered U.S. – is isolated, by law, from the rest of the world. Change of any sort is forbidden.\n\nThis political and social stasis serves dual purposes: It reduces the underclass to a domestic-animal dependence, and it permanently freezes every aspect of costume, language and architecture, freeing the author from the need to invent futuristic trappings that almost never work.\n\nThroughout, Bennett combines the fantastic with a keen sympathy for social suffering and disgust at political machinations. She also shows a solid knowledge of science (including the then-recent work of Einstein). Her concept of parallel universes comes close to theories not fully formulated for another half century.\n\nAnd take it from this sometime Philadelphian: She nails the physical city beautifully.\n\nAugust 31, 2022\n\nI heard of this in Monster, She Wrote and was intrigued. It was only $1 on kindle so here we are.\n\nI think the tagline comparing this to The Hunger Games and The Man in the High Castle does it a disservice. There’re only vague similarities between this and either of those two. There is an alternate dimension or time travel; there is a sort of competition that the upper classes run, but it’s only briefly shown and is nothing like THG.\n\nThis is a really interesting earlyish fantasy/scifi. It’s a bit dated in places, but the concept is really interesting. I wanted more of Ulithia than we got, but the structure of 2118’s Philadelphia was pretty well done.\n\n(I don’t usually picture characters as anyone specific, but I pictured Trenmore as Cleary from The Knick.)\n\nI’m glad I read this. It is definitely worth the dollar.\n\nJune 15, 2018\n\nI understand the significance of the novel and the ground it broke, but still found it light and no more than entertaining. The coincidences that propel the story are a little hard to swallow. Happy I picked it up, though.\n\nJune 27, 2024\n\nParallelwelten-Klassiker mit leichten Schwächen im Finish, deshalb nur drei Sterne. War aber auf jeden Fall ein Lesevergnügen.\n\nJune 3, 2019\n\nGood pulpy sci-fi, like Conan Doyle's Professor Challenger stories, or Burroughs' Mars books.\n\nAugust 19, 2019\n\nNot quite what I thought it would be judging from the synopsis. I thought this piece of time travel fiction from 1919 would paint a utopian future world of 2118 in which women brutally rule over men. Instead there is one female authority among tons of male rulers and her claim to power is based on her beauty. Nevertheless, this glimpse into the future was interesting and fun. Often it felt almost whimsical and with the in-between space of Ulithia it reminded me more of a fantasy than a scifi novel. I also enjoyed the 3 main characters and the friendship dynamic between them. I just wish the woman, Viola, had not been the object of attraction for basically every male character (also, she's 17, it was uncomfortable at times).\n\nI like to remind myself that this piece of creative non-realistic fiction was written in the early 20th century by a woman and it makes me proud that Gertrude Barrows Bennett (she wrote under a pen name) had the imagination and courage to publish her work.\n\nFebruary 28, 2021\n\nI always enjoy a novel written sometime in the past and set sometime in the future. The glimpses of what was imagined can be fascinating. Francis Stevens did a fine job in 1919 conjuring up the dreadful lengths people would go to control others and elevate themselves into positions of power in a false democracy.\n\nIn The Heads of Cerberus, shades of the Hunger Games and Trump’s America come together in a dark and compelling story. The science fiction isn’t necessarily finely detailed so the reader has to accept a bit of magical thinking but it’s a very good read nonetheless.\n\nSeptember 23, 2022\n\nPuanım 2/5 (%42/100)\n\nEn başta genel olarak eh işte diyebileceğim bir kitap olduğunu söyleyerek başlayayım. İşe giderken yolda yanımda kitap bulunduruyorum ve elimde bu olduğu için bitirmek zorunda kaldım yoksa yarısına falan geldiğimde okumayı bırakırdım. Francis Stevens adıyla 1900lerin başlarında belki de kimseler yazmazken bu türde yenilikçi bir kitap yazmış Gertrude Barrows Bennett. O yüzden aslında çok değerli bir kitap çünkü paralel evrenin ilk geçtiği kitaplardan olması, distopya ve kara fantazya denildiğinde ilk isimlerden olması gibi birçok özelliği var. Fakat kitabın birçok problemi de var benim gözümde.\n\nÖncelikle bilim-kurgu olarak kabul etmek zor çünkü anlatılan şeyler çok ucundan bilimsel şekilde açıklanıyor o yüzden daha çok fantastik diyebilirim. Zaman yolculuğu vs. şeklinde reklamı yapılıyor ama onun bile büyü ile açıklanması daha kolay. Karakterler de fazla yüzeysel geldi bana o yüzden çok bağlanamadım. Genel olarak sıkıldım ve çok büyük umutlarla başlamış olsam da bir türlü sevemedim yani 100. sayfaya geldiğimde bile \"e hadi artık bir şeyler olsun\" derken buldum kendimi. Yani bilim-kurgu/fantastik edebiyat için önemli bir yazar ve eser olduğu için 1 kere okuyup kütüphanenizde saklayabilirsiniz ama çok umutlanmayın derim ben.\n\nApril 26, 2020\n\nMore like a 2.5, but I'll round it up and give it the benefit of the doubt since it's a pioneering work.\n\nThis is a tough book for a contemporary reader. Pushing through the dated language is one thing, but the god awful stock characters with their predictable tropes is tough.\n\nThe pace also plods, which isn't too uncommon for turn of the century literature; too many times the momentum of the story is stymied by unnecessary expository passages.\n\nThere is enough intrigue in the plot to carry the story through, though. There is a genuine sense of tension that remains consistent. I would love to see this translated to the screen.\n\nWhen considering the time that this was written, the premise is ingenious and it's disappointing to know that this book and its author have gone overlooked for their work.\n\nAugust 10, 2022\n\nLa fiole au Cerbère est une excellente découverte. Certes, si nous ne le remettons pas dans son époque de parution, c’est un roman qui peut paraître un peu daté sur certains aspects tout en offrant une lecture très plaisante, rythmée et envoûtante malgré ses défauts. Mais quand on garde en plus en tête qu’il est paru en 1919, on est impressionné par son côté novateur et l’univers dystopique imaginée par son autrice. Une découverte fort intéressante!\n\nCritique complète sur yuyine.be!\n\nSeptember 25, 2020\n\n3.5/5 stars. Unsurprisingly this book is a product of its time (1919) and therefore cringy at times. That said, it was an entertaining read and it was pretty neat to see some of the roots of books like The Hunger Games and Divergent.\n\nApril 15, 2022\n\nSnort some magic dust\n\nvisit the dumbest timeline\n\nwhat a wasted trip.\n\nRead\n\nFebruary 1, 2024\n\nA dystopian/sci-fi novel written by a woman in 1919 - very cool.\n\nOctober 3, 2011\n\nThis has to be explicably alternative history [with science fictions and speculative makings] a great character development for fiction in it’s time and drawing us in to see Philadelphia respectively like in 2118 alternatively Francis Stevens work was published between 1919-1920, cool as in cool genre eye opening brain candy from the days back when slang in English usages were norm and science fiction writers were likely new to getting attentive readers pleasing numerous audiences in the flavor of such mysterious alternative in literature.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nDaughter is reading this for Freshman Studies. SciFi from 1919, anticipating everything from Metropolis, and Princess of Mars, to 1984 and Brave New World to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Phantom Toll Booth, and Hunger Games. Some borrowed from Wizard of Oz. Francis Stevens is a pen name for the female author.\n\nI was charmed by this line:\n\n\"There is no known remedy for the loss of a sweetheart who has melted into the circumambient atmosphere.\"\n\nFrancis Stevens, The Heads of Cerberus\n\nNovember 27, 2013\n\nThis book is so badly written it's painful to read. I couldn't get more than a quarter of the way through.\n\nAugust 3, 2019\n\nThis is a reprint of a tale originally serialized in a pulp magazine back in 1919 and published now as part of the Modern Library's Torchbearers imprint (honoring \"women who wrote on their own terms, with boldness, creativity, and a spirit of resistance\"). Not only is it a very early science fiction/fantasy novel written by a female author, but it's apparently one of the first works to explore parallel worlds (in this case, with a dystopian twist).\n\nA note on reading early genre works: like many other stories of the time, there is a huge emphasis on exposition. It's not enough to just have the outré element, but you need to justify its origin and workings fully. (Not like these days where - poof! - we have a time machine.) Sometimes, that perceived necessity became a virtue (see most of the Sherlock Holmes canon, where the exposition is much of the story); other times, the need to explicate weighs down the narrative.\n\nStevens here walks a fine line between too much and too little. The engine that gets everything going is an artifact called (ta-dah!) the Head of Cerberus, which is filled with a fine grey dust. When the dust makes contact with a human being, they are transported to a strange fantasy realm which then transports them to an alternate world. (It's much like the setup in C.S. Lewis's The Magician's Nephew.) Stevens spends a bunch of writing on the dust, its origins, and its power (not so interesting) and leaves the fantasy realm almost completely unexplained (ooh! mystery!).\n\nWe follow a trio: an older brother (big, strong, and Irish), his little sister (attractive - of course - and spirited), and the brother's best friend (smart, but down on his luck, and - of course - falling for the sister). Nobody is terribly nuanced, but they're all likeable enough and all have parts in moving the plot forward. After making contact with the dust, they are captured in a Philadelphia of 2118, which strongly resembles their Philadelphia of 1918, except that the social and political hierarchy has become horribly authoritarian. (Most people have no name, just a number, and nothing more than a basic practical education.) Our trio does what you might expect in such circumstances, but the epilogue takes a strange philosophical twist.\n\nOverall, it was a fun read. Stevens relied too much on coincidence (several people get involved in the tale through botched burglaries!), but I really liked her description of the ruling class, where Superlatives (people called Strongest, Cleverest, Loveliest, etc... rule). I was thinking at the end that she was setting up a series about the dust and our trio, but from what I can tell, she never followed up on it. Recommended if you like early science fiction and fantasy writing.\n\nAugust 15, 2019\n\nModern Library has created a new curated series called Torchbearers, of books written by \"women who wrote on their own terms, with boldness, creativity, and a spirit of resistance.\" I'll be reviewing a few of these, starting with this one, a dystopian science fiction novel written by Gertrude Barrows Bennett in 1919 and originally published in 'The Thrill Book' magazine.\n\nThe worst thing about this welcome new edition is the introduction by Naomi Alderman. Sure, it's incisive, well-written and thought-provoking, but it tells us precisely nothing about Gertrude Barrows Bennett, who, after all, is the point of this reprint. Only a brief note on the back cover highlights that she was \"the first major female writer of science fiction and fantasy in the United States, and has been credited as the inventor of the subgenre of dark fantasy.\"\n\n'The Heads of Cerberus' is very much a product of its time, not just in its use of language which, contrary to modern standards, is happy to employ eloquent sentences and good grammar, but in the subject matter. Alderman ably points out that much of the dystopia is a commentary on the faceless masses who died for their countries in World War I, here depicted as the populace of an oppressed 2118 Philadelphia who are known by numbers rather than names.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. The book begins in 1918, still in Philly, in haunting manner. A man wakes up in a strange room, having been bludgeoned into unconsciousness. He sees an open safe, rustles through the papers and, finding something unexpected, hurls it from him in horror. He hears noises, suggesting that he's not alone, so flees through the house, eventually secreting himself in a downstairs room where the hand of a looming giant arrests him.\n\nIt's glorious stuff and it hooked me immediately. What we come to find out is that this man is Robert Drayton and what horrified him so in the safe was a gift that he himself had given, bringing home the fact that he had broken into a friend's house. He's stuck between thankfulness that he didn't rob him (even if someone else did) and guilt that he tried, even if he fell to crime after being framed and disbarred as a lawyer.\n\nWonderfully, the friend, a huge Irishman named Terry Trenmore, forgives him immediately and thanks the fates for bringing him here. The two of them move forward into the grand adventure that is to come, along with Terry's young and beautiful sister, Viola.\n\nFull review at http://www.thenamelesszine.org/Books-....\n\nJanuary 2, 2023\n\nThe Heads of Cerberus by Francis Stevens\n\n⚠️TW: Modern day Slavery\n\n📚Synopsis: Philadelphia, 1918: Three friends--brave, confident Viola Trenmore, clever but shy Robert Drayton, and Viola's strong and hot-tempered brother, Terry--discover a mysterious powder that transports them two hundred years into the future. The Philadelphia of 2118 is no longer a bustling metropolis but instead a completely isolated city recovering from an unknown disaster. Citizens are issued identification tags instead of having names, and society is split between a wealthy, powerful minority and a downtrodden lower class. The position of supreme authority is held by a woman, and once a year she oversees competitions to the death to determine who rules alongside her. When Viola, Terry, and Robert are forced to take part in these strange and deadly games, it will take their combined wits for them to escape this strange world and return home.\n\n💭My thoughts: I picked this up from my library on a whim. The synopsis was intriguing, despite it being a dystopian novel (I swore off of them back in '14). This book has surprisingly made me want to pick up more Scifi specific dystopian books; who would have thought this day would come!?\n\nThis was written in 1919 and it's incredibly interesting to see how the future was depicted by the author of that time period. Our characters stumble upon a land that seems devoid of all recognizable landmarks, with no food nor water and begin to explore this \"land of illusion\" to discover is it somewhat known to them.\n\nI wish this were more heavy on Science fiction, as this mysterious powder even just existing seemed all too convenient. I would have loved a deep dive into the science of time travel. Many moments in this book read as convenient coincidences, which was unfortunate. Overall, this is book is more Dystopian than anything and I enjoyed the adventure and characters, though, I felt this story would have benefited by being longer as more building needed to occur in a few areas (ex: history of powder & how it came to be in the house, who brought it and the science behind time travel.)\n\nSeptember 1, 2022\n\nI feel bad giving this a 3 bc I think a lot of the things I didn't like as much about it are not the book's fault. I'm just so fatigued of time travel narratives and parallel timeline narratives and the construction of the world felt very YA dystopian sci fi, but then I have to remember that this book was written in like 1916 and predates allllll of those associations and the thing is, it does have a lot going for it. The main characters are all very likeable, charming, soulful, a bit archetypal but in a fun satisfying way. The description of Ulithia was by far my favorite part, the most intriguing and exciting part, which makes me rly want to read Stevens's fantasy as opposed to the sci-fi, I'm also admittedly in a major fantasy zone and don't want sci fi right now which its my fault for reading this (its so funny how the genres are in some ways so similar but yet to me FEEL so so different, like the kind of immersion feels so different to me and I don't know why). I almost gave this 4 stars purely bc of how the explained everything in the end, I was glad it ended up not being an actual prediction of the future but rather the projection of the characters, their values and personalities. The explanation merged science and the occult in a very satisfying way instead of going the pure science route which I always dread (where is the mystery, the mystique, maybe thats why I like fantasy so much more, magic and mysticism is able to be so satisfyingly opaque, even when we know how it works, its essence is still mysterious while speculative science, futurism, while it may not explain its inner workings to you, it is always implied that those inner working are there and are based on something logical and ultimately knowable). I will also say, the way she predicted communism would be used as a scapegoat on the part of the elite to unilaterally seize insane amounts of power ended up being spot on."
