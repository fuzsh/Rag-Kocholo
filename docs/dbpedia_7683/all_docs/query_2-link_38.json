        "text": "Cerberus Supporting Cast\n\nReal Name: Cerberus.\n\nOccupation: Guard dog.\n\nIdentity: Cerberus's existence as anything other than a mythological figure is unknown to the general public.\n\nLegal Status: Property of Hades.\n\nOther Aliases: Hound of Hades, Hound of Hell.\n\nPlace of Birth: Unrevealed.\n\nMarital Status: Single.\n\nKnown Relatives: Tython (father), Echidna (mother), Lernean Hydra, Orthrus (brothers, deceased), Chimera (sister, deceased), Sphinx (niece, deceased), Nemean Lion (nephew, deceased), Gaea (grandmother). For more details on his extended family tree, consult Hesiod's Theogeny and other works.\n\nGroup Affiliation: Denizens of the Underworld.\n\nBase of Operations: The underworld realm of Hades.\n\nFirst Post-Reboot Appearance: HERCULES: THE LEGEND CONTINUES #\n\nHistory: Born of monsters, Cerberus would have been consigned to life as yet another monster to be slaughtered by the ancient heroes had it not been for his cousin, Hades, who treated the giant three-headed dog with respect. Hades placed Cerberus under his protection in exchange for Cerberus's services as the watchdog of his realm, the ancient Greek underworld. Only twice is Cerberus known to have relaxed in his duty: once when Orpheus persuaded Hades to restore the mortal's wife to life, and once when he was taken out of the underworld by Hercules as part of the demigod's Twelve Labors.\n\nThe latter incident has been related by both Hercules and Hades's wife, Persephone, as follows: Hercules had been ordered by his cousin Eurystheus, King of Tiryns, to deliver Cerberus to him as Herc's twelfth and final Labor. Descending into the underworld, accompanied by Athena and Hermes, Herc was welcomed as a guest by his uncle and half-sister (Hades and Persephone, respectively) and given every hospitality. Hades did not want Cerberus harmed, and Cerberus agreed to be carried to the surface world if Hercules could succeed in defeating him in unarmed combat. Hercules not only succeeded, but treated the hound with such respect afterward, including releasing Cerberus and accompanying him back to the underworld the moment the Labor was complete that the two soon formed a close friendship which continues to this day.\n\nCerberus was on hand to greet Hercules and his half-sister, Nyssa Savakis, when the two visited the Greek underworld. Nyssa was scared of Cerberus at first, but the giant dog soon won over her affections.\n\nPresumably Cerberus remains the ever-watchful guard dog of Hades's realm.\n\nAge: Indeterminate.\n\nHeight: 5' 6\" at the shoulder.\n\nLength: 8' 10\".\n\nWeight: 4500 lbs.\n\nEyes: Varies, commonly depicted as blue, green, or red.\n\nFur: Black.\n\nOther Distinguishing Features: Cerberus has three heads.\n\nUniform: None.\n\nStrength Level: Cerberus possesses superhuman (supercanine?) strength. Using two of his heads in unison, he is able to effectively lift (press) up to 80 tons.\n\nKnown Superhuman Powers: In addition to his strength, Cerberus has superhuman durability. His physical form is such that he can run at up to 50 miles per hour. His three heads permit him to look and pay attention in almost any direction at the same time. He otherwise has all the typical features and senses of a canine, albeit one much larger than most.\n\nLike all Olympian deities, he is immune to all terrestrial diseases and poisons/toxins, and does not age.\n\nOther Abilities: Unlike many of his siblings, Cerberus has a human-level intellect and is not instinctively afraid of fire.\n\n1,141 points\n\nST: 46/332 [115*â â¡] HP: 46 [0] Speed: 6.50 [0] DX: 12 [24â ] Will: 13 [15] Move: 6/24 [0] IQ: 10 [0] Per: 13 [15] HT: 14 [40] FP: 14 [0] SM: +1 Dmg: 5d+2/8d-1 (34d/36d) BL: 423 lbs.

Despite â or perhaps because of â his position, he is very lonely, as there are very few beings in Hades who are not shades of the dead.\n\nHe is very friendly with Hercules, as Herc â when he visits â always brings him a large snack (the last time was a 50 ton crate of Kibbles & Bits)."
