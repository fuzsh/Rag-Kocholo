        "text": "But Isn’t This About Powerlifting?\n\nIf you are thinking, Strongman isn’t Powerlifting, what gives? Strongmen and Powerlifting have a lot in common, with the easiest crossover being the pursuit of strength. Not convinced? Cerberus has a full line of Power Bars including a Deadlift Bar and Squat Bar. Strongmen deadlift, sometimes squat, and do a lot of pressing (not Bench, but we’ll forgive them for that).\n\nStrongman Is The Most Fun You’ll Have Lifting – Ever!\n\nYeah yeah I know, this is bad advertising for a powerlifting competition. But seriously, nothing is more fun than picking up heavy weight, running around with is, and throwing it somewhere. There is just something cool about weighted carries, log presses, dropping huge weights from overhead, stones, and more. The cool thing is, you can get away with a LOT of strongman training with just a few key accessories. And… AND!!!! Strongman work is great conditioning and super supplemental to your pursuit of a bigger total in the Garage Gym Competition.\n\nThat is why Cerberus Strength USA is our Official Strongman Training Sponsor!\n\nWhat Does This Mean?\n\nIf you enjoy strongman training, or want to dabble in it, or even get your pinky toe wet in it, we got you! Cerberus Strength USA has a ton of awesome resources that we will share with you. A bunch right here, and more in our GGC Newsletter as we progress throughout the year.\n\nAnd DEFINITELY check out their training tip resources for all things strongman related. There is plenty of carryover here regardless of what strength sport you train for.\n\nWhat Do I Need To Train Strongman At Home?\n\nWe have an article on the way. In the meantime, you can start simply by picking up some random stuff and carrying it around. Fill up a backpack with sand or rocks. Or grab a few items from the shopping list here.\n\nWhat Else Does Cerberus Strength USA Have?\n\nCerberus Strength USA has been a sponsor of the Garage Gym Competition for multiple years and will continue that into 2024. This year they are handing out prizes to 5 different winners in the 2024 Spring and the 2024 Fall GGC events.\n\nPrizes up for grabs are:\n\nA Pair of Dinne Stone Handles\n\nA Dual-Ply Sandbag V3 (two winners)\n\nA Cerberus Strength USA T-Shirt (two winners)"
