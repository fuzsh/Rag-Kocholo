My ears and my gut is telling me this is punk, so I’ll agree and barrel forward trying not to be too jejune about the whole affair.\n\nNow, working from our supposition that this is punk music, it appears to have been cross-contaminated by Metal, which is good, this is a tasty cross-contamination. Over the ten-odd minute length of this EP we get a sprinkling of gloomy depth; a hint of black void behind the sweat, spittle and smashing drums. To my ears this elevates it bit out of the morass and combined with the incensed female vocals across the viciously short tracks it leaves me scouring the web for more. Death Vacation has snuck around the carefully constructed wall I made between myself and the genre whose name I am tired of typing out. It won me over, I surrender.\n\nSN01: Through Your Head by Death Vacation"
