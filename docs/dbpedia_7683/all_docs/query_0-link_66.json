        "text": "This is an overview of the Cerberus Canis mesh head for Second Life avatars. The information may also apply to the other Cerberus heads however the photos are only of Cerberus Canis, and the list is what comes with Cerberus Canis. Other heads have slightly different content. As always I strongly encourage you to demo before making any final purchases. To browse other mesh heads, bodies, and more check out The Mesh Directory.\n\nBasic Info\n\nProduct Specifics\n\nCreator – Cerberus\n\nProduct – Canis\n\nPrice – L$349\n\nReview Version – 2.8\n\nIncluded Parts\n\nBody – No\n\nEyes – Yes\n\nEars – Yes\n\nHead – Yes\n\nSkin – Yes*\n\nExpressions & Animations\n\nEye Control – No\n\nTyping/Voice Animations – Yes\n\nStatic Expressions – Yes\n\nFacial Animations – Yes\n\nIncluded Gestures – Yes\n\nIncluded Customization\n\nBakes on Mesh (BOM)\n\nEyebrows – Yes*\n\nHairbases – No\n\nMakeup – Yes*\n\nEyes – Yes\n\nApplier\n\nEyebrows – No\n\nHairbases – No\n\nMakeup – No\n\nEyes – Yes (Tinting via HUD)\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nTeeth – Yes\n\nLashes – Yes\n\nPiercings – No\n\nCopy – Yes\n\nTransfer – No\n\nMod – Yes\n\nCompatibility\n\nBakes on Mesh (BOM)\n\nBakes on Mesh (BOM) – Yes\n\nEvoX Skin Compatible – No\n\nApplier\n\nSkin Appliers – Yes\n\nCosmetic Appliers – Yes\n\nApplier Save Slots – No\n\nOmega Compatible – Yes\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nMaterials Enabled – Yes\n\nUniversal Neck Standard ?When used with the same skin tone, heads and bodies both using the Universal Neck Standard result in a seamless neck. – No\n\nAdditional Neck Sizing Options – No*\n\nHUD\n\nPros, Neutral Notes, and Cons\n\nOther things of note to consider that haven’t been mentioned above.\n\nPros\n\nCerberus is a popular brand for furry products. This makes it easy to find third party products made for them\n\nTheir heads are very expressive out of the box, and you can purchase first and third party animators for even more expression options.\n\nNeutral Notes\n\n* While skin and makeup are provided, it’s mostly just an example skin to give you an idea how the head can look. The only body it’s compatible with is Regalia. The head CAN be used with other skins and bodies, and most folks who use Canis either purchase a mod kit designed specifically for Canis or make things themselves.\n\nCons\n\n* There is no neck with the Cerberus Canis head. A lot of folks use third party free options such as Apricot Paw’s SLUV Neck Extender or NARCOTIC SLUMBER’s Neck Extenders. You will not achieve a seamless neck with this head.\n\nWhat’s In The Box\n\nInworld Location\n\nMarketplace\n\nSL Group\n\nDiscord\n\nExample of Cerberus Canis In Use\n\nHead – Cerberus: Canis (No ear version)\n\nBody – eBODY: Reborn\n\nSkin/Markings/Makeup/Ears– MODZ: Angeles F Pink\n\nShape – Modified version of MODZ‘s Female Shape\n\nHair – RAW HOUSE: Bear X\n\nEyes – Whisk (Formerly Okaie): Gentle Eyes\n\nTongue – NARCOTIC SLUMBER: BOM Canis/Lupis split tongue\n\nGlasses– NARCOTIC SLUMBER: Spunkers glasses Canis/Lupus\n\nPiercings – Extasis: C-Canis Piercings\n\nTop – CryBunBun: Your Waifu\n\nPose – FOXCITY: Influencer-1\n\nLocation – My private home (most everything you can see is from Studio Skye and Hayabusa)\n\nWindlight (EEP) – Bryn Oh: Bryn Oh’s BOX MetaLES (This may be included as part of your viewer.
