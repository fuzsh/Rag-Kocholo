        "text": "Artist~ Emma-Fay on DeviantArt\n\nCERBERUS\n\n(sir-bir-is)\n\nHistorical Context: the Cerberus originates from Greek Mythology. The three headed dog is also referred to as the hound of Hades, who guards the doors to the underworld. However, in this handbook, the Cerberus will not follow the traditional build found in Greek Mythology.\n\nHeight: ≈ 110cm\n\nWeight: ≈ thirty to forty kilograms\n\nLife span: ≈ ten to thirteen years\n\nAttack: eight//they use teeth and claws when hunting, also they have immense strength\n\nArmour: thirty//their fleshy skin with a thin coat of fur offers no protection\n\nDefence: sixty// stamina and speed helps for a flighty getaway\n\nStealth: fifty//can be stealthy if trained, but is usually very obvious\n\nDiet: carnivore// main diet of meat\n\nHabitat: varies//not typically found in the wild; these are domestic pets\n\nArtist~ sancta-silje on DeviantArt\n\nSex:\n\nCerberus' are much like human dogs. The male cerberus is known as either a cerberus, stud or sire; all names are used in referring to this specific gender of cerberus. The female cerberus is referred to as a bitch and nothing more. Their offspring are known as puppies or pups.\n\nAppearance:\n\nThe cerberus can have the generalised description of a dog with three heads. Traditionally, from Greek Mythology, the cerberus is fifteen feet tall (457cm) with jet black shaggy fur and a snake-like tail. However, in the realm of fantasy, this isn't a likely case. A cerberus can be any shape or size of a normal human dog, minus the snake tail. They can be as small as a corgi, or as large as a german sheppard, with the fur coat of whatever dog.\n\nMating:\n\nCerberus's mate for life, but sometimes are used for breeding. Naturally, the cerberus is supposed to have one mate and pups with them, but the greed of humanity and other beings use them for money, and breed them, breaking this natural flow. The female cerberus can give birth to up to eight pups.\n\nArtist~ Andreas Walters\n\nHunting:\n\nCerberus's are usually kept as domestic pets, but they can be used as hunting weapons. Both male and female cerberus's are great hunters; three heads means three times the smartness. Typically, the males are used for hunting and the females are used for breeding. However, each head can be taught a different skill such as tracking, killing, sight, etc. Although all three can be taught all assests, it is wiser to divide the knowledge.\n\nTemperament:\n\nCerberus's have the temperament of an average dog. They can be playful and energetic, protective and agressive or dopey and humouress. They're easily trained and can be very trusting. The breed of cerberus can change along with its temperament, but the only knowledge that should be acquired is that they're like an average human dog.\n\nRarity:\n\nThe cerberus originally comes from Greek Mythology, and can be fifteen feet in height, and can have a snake-like tail. So far, there has only been knowledge of one cerberus that follows this description, the hound of Hades. But that doesn't mean that somewhere, someone, somehow figured out how to breed a hound just like Hades."
