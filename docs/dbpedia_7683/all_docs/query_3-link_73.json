        "text": "Basic Information\n\nAnatomy\n\nCerberus appear similar to wolves but with three separate heads that each possess an independent mind. Beside their heads they possess four legs and a single body which possesses only one of each of the organs found in a standard wolf or dog. The Cerberus is covered in a leathery hide which itself is covered in often dark shaded thin fur.\n\nGenetics and Reproduction\n\nCerberus reproduce through sexual reproduction. A male Cerberus possesses a penis and testicles which can be used to inseminate any subspecies of wolf and some other mammals to produce three headed children. Similarly female Cerberus can be inseminated by any subspecies of wolf or some other mammals to produce three headed spawn. In both cases the likelihood of impregnation is far higher with another Cerberus than with other species. Gestation of a Cerberus child takes approximately three months and children and birthed live but take several days to become fully mobile and able to move and eat.\n\nGrowth Rate & Stages\n\nCerberus pups are largely immobile for their first week while their minds compete and begin to develop their understanding of one another's influence and control over their organs. Once the equilibrium is reached and the Cerberus is able to share control between its heads it gradually begins growing as it eats and lives. Most Cerberus reach their full size at around three years of age and live until they are fourteen years old.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nPerception and Sensory Capabilities\n\nCerberus have strong senses of smell and perception enhanced by their three minds which can share information between them. The sharing of their other limbs does however mean that tracker Cerberus' can often find themselves competing over separate scent or visual leads.\n\nScientific Name\n\nKhake E Gnake\n\nOrigin/Ancestry\n\nWolf\n\nLifespan\n\n14 Years\n\nGeographic Distribution\n\nRemove these ads.
