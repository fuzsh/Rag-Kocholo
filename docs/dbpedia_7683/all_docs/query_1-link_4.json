You must have another name for me - a private name. You may choose it yourself if you like.\"\n\nI said nothing. It seemed to me quite impossible that I should have any name other than the two words which were, in some mystic sense I only respected without understanding, my name.\n\nWe know that it's the same name as his father's:\n\n\"Is that [Number Five] what you call him?\"\n\n\"It's more convenient since his name is the same as my own.\""
