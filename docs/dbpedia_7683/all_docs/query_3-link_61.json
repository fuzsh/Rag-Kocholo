        "text": "The principal activities of injected cerberus (cer) messenger RNA in Xenopus embryos are the inhibition of trunk mesoderm and neuralization of the ectoderm1. Xenopus cerberus protein (Cer) is structurally related to a family of cystine-knot secreted proteins that behave as antagonists of members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family7,8. To determine the molecular mechanism of Cer function, we prepared soluble Xenopus Cer protein tagged with the Flag epitope. In animal cap cells expressing cer mRNA, Cer–Flag was secreted as a soluble protein of relative molecular mass (Mr) 46,000, designated Cer-long (Cer-L); a minor form of Mr 33,000, designated Cer-short (Cer-S), was also produced ( , lane 1). Transfected human 293T cells ( , lane 2) produced almost exclusively the proteolytically processed Cer-S form ( ). To test whether Cerberus binds to any of the three main mesoderm-inducing candidate factors, we produced biologically active preparations of activin, Vg1 and Xnr-1 (Xenopus nodal-related-1, ref. 9), tagged with haemagglutinin (HA) at the amino terminus ( ). In immunoprecipitation experiments Cer–Flag proteins bound Xnr-1 but not activin or Vg1 proteins, displaying a remarkable degree of specificity ( ). In the presence of either Cer-L or Cer-S protein, the Xbra-inducing activity of Xnr-1 was blocked, but that of activin or Vg1 proteins was not ( ). In animal cap assays, we found that at 10−9 M, Cer-L and Cer-S proteins titrated Xnr-1 signalling stoichiometrically, indicating that the affinity of the interaction must be in the subnanomolar range ( ).\n\nThe neuralizing activity of cer mRNA can be antagonized by BMP-4 (refs 1,7). We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments to test whether Xenopus Cerberus proteins bind BMPs directly. Cer-L–Flag protein bound BMP-4, with a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.6 nM ( ). This interaction was highly specific, as it could be displaced by a 10-fold excess of the related molecule BMP-2, but not by TGF-β-1, epidermal growth factor (EGF) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF; , lanes 3−6). In biological assays, Cer-L protein had neutralizing activity ( , lane 3), whereas the proteolytically processed Cer-S protein did not bind BMP-4 (even in 10-fold excess, , lane 9) and did not induce neural markers ( , lane 4).\n\nAn additional property of cer mRNA is that it blocks the induction of secondary axes by Xwnt-8 mRNA4. We found that in animal caps, full-length cer mRNA inhibited Xwnt-8 but not β-catenin signalling ( ), suggesting that Cer-L might antagonize Xwnt-8 extracellularly. To test this directly, we incubated Xwnt-8–HA protein produced in oocytes with Cer-L–Flag or Cer-S–Flag and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. We found that Xwnt-8 bound to Cer-L, but not to the Cer-S protein ( , lanes 3−5). Thus, the Cer-L protein is a trifunctional antagonist that can bind Xnr-1, BMP and Xwnt-8 in solution.\n\nThe binding of Xnr-1 to Cer-L–Flag could not be displaced by excess BMP ( ) and Xwnt-8 binding was not displaced by excess BMP or Xnr-1 ( ). This suggests that Cer-L binds each ligand at independent binding sites ( ). In addition, the biochemical studies show that Cer-L is proteolytically processed into the Cer-S protein containing the cystine-knot ( ), which retains only the anti-Xnr-1 activity. This proteolytic cleavage could be important in regulating Cerberus function in vivo; a regulatory proteolytic step has been described in the case of chordin (Chd), in which active BMP ligands are released from inactive Chd/BMP complexes10.\n\nXenopus Cerberus has three distinct inhibitory activities and, as shown below, each one is required for the induction of ectopic head-like structures. To study the phenotypic effects of specifically inhibiting nodal-related signals in the context of the Xenopus embryo, we generated a construct encoding a secreted form of Cer-S, designated cer-S. Injection of cer-S mRNA into single blastomeres did not induce ectopic heads but instead gave rise to anterior defects in the endogenous head, including cyclopia (not shown). Embryos in which each blastomere was injected at the four-cell stage with cer-S mRNA lacked axial structures and the expression of the trunk mesoderm markers Xbra and Xwnt-8 was blocked ( ). In addition to maintaining a mesodermal fate, nodal-related signals are required for the formation of anterior endoderm: expression of endogenous cerberus was blocked by cer-S mRNA ( , lane 2) and induced by Xnr-1 mRNA ( ). Interestingly, endodermal patterning by Xnr-1 mRNA appears to function early in development, as injection of an Xnr-1 DNA construct expressed after mid-blastula was unable to induce cerberus ( , lanes 6−8). Taken together, these gain- and loss-of-function studies support the view that nodal-related signals have a central role in the patterning of anterior endoderm and in trunk mesoderm formation in Xenopus, in agreement with genetic studies in other vertebrates11–17.\n\nSince the anti-nodal activity of cer-S was not sufficient to induce ectopic head-like structures, we next tested it in combination with anti-BMP reagents in explants of ventral marginal zone (VMZ), which normally develops into postero-ventral mesoderm containing blood ( ). Microinjection of cer-S or of tBR, a dominant-negative BMP receptor mRNA6, did not cause head formation ( ). However, injection of combined cer-S and tBR produced a striking change in VMZ fate into head-like structures ( ). The explants contained a large cyclopic eye (often with crystalline lens), brain, cement gland and endoderm, but no notochord or somites, indicating the generation of head organizer activity. Indistinguishable head-like structures were formed by injection of full-length cer mRNA ( ). Co-injection of a dominant-negative putative nodal receptor18, tALK4, with tBR also induced head-like structures ( ), showing that the cer constructs do not have an instructive role. Although these experiments in VMZs show that simultaneous inhibition of nodal-related and BMP signalling is sufficient for head specification, they do not indicate whether the anti-Wnt activity of cerberus is required for head formation. Indeed, in VMZs the main Wnt, Xwnt-8, is inhibited at the gene-expression level in embryos injected with cer-S ( ) or tBR mRNA19.\n\nTo test whether triple inhibition of Wnt, nodal-related and BMP signalling is required for ectopic head formation, we carried out epistatic combinatorial experiments in the context of the whole embryo. Co-injection of chd (anti-BMP) and cer-S (anti-nodal) into a ventral blastomere resulted in ectopic heads containing a cyclopic eye (58%, n = 115); this induction was blocked by co-injection of Xwnt-8 DNA ( ). Similarly, selective inactivation of the anti-nodal activity of full-length cer mRNA by co-injection of a constitutively active ALK-4 receptor18, even at doses that only weakly promote trunk mesoderm formation, abolished ectopic head induction by cer ( ). Mimicking BMP signalling by co-injecting a constitutively active BMP receptor construct also antagonized ectopic head induction ( ). These epistatic experiments indicate that all three inhibitory activities of cerberus are required for the formation of ectopic head structures.\n\nNiehrs and co-workers have shown that simultaneous inhibition of BMP and Wnt signalling is sufficient to induce secondary axes containing heads with cyclopic eyes4. This is puzzling, for this head induction would occur without apparent inhibition of nodal-related signals. We confirmed these results using co-injection of chd10 and Frzb-1 (ref. 20) mRNAs, which encode secreted inhibitors specific for BMP and Wnt proteins, respectively ( ). Head formation by chd and Frzb-1 was suppressed by co-injection of Xnr-1 DNA ( ), suggesting that inhibition of nodal signalling could also be involved in this experimental situation, perhaps by activating transcription of cerberus. As shown in , co-injection of Frzb-1 and tBR mRNA led to strong ectopic expression of cerberus in ventral endoderm at levels comparable to those seen with endogenous cerberus mRNA ( , arrow), with concomitant inhibition of the trunk mesodermal marker Xbra near the site of injection ( )."
