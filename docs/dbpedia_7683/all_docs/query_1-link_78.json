        "text": "Terra Firma boss Guy Hands knew that a rival bid by Cerberus Capital Partners had collapsed within hours of submitting his own bid for British record label EMI, an attorney for lender Citigroup told the court yesterday.\n\nIn Hands’ third day on the stand, lead Citi attorney Ted Wells produced e-mails and documents between Hands and other officials indicating that Hands knew that Cerberus had dropped out of the running for EMI shortly after Terra Firma bid for the music company.\n\nHands has insisted that his decision to buy EMI was based solely on conversations with Citi banker David Wormsley, who deceived him into thinking that Cerberus was planning to make a rival bid for EMI.\n\nWells said that Hands had received a “heads up” from his press manager, Andrew Dowler, that reporters at the Financial Times had information suggesting that Cerberus was no longer in the running just 12 hours after Terra Firma submitted its own EMI bid.\n\n“Wouldn’t you want to at least investigate whether it was true or not?” Wells asked Hands. “Did you think about calling Mr. Wormsley?”\n\n“The best thing to do with things like that is to take no action,” Hands said.\n\nHands testified earlier that he didn’t know Cerberus had dropped out until months after he had submitted his offer. Terra Firma’s $8.4 billion fraud suit against lender Citi hinges on allegations that the bank duped him into making a bad investment.\n\nWells also said that 24 hours after Terra Firma’s bid was submitted, Hands’ private-equity firm engaged in talks with Cerberus to help fund the label purchase.\n\n“That was one day after the FT indicated that [Cerberus] was out. So now you were interfacing with [Cerberus] on the possibility of them investing in the deal?” Wells asked Hands.\n\n“It’s normal practice” Hands said.\n\nHands is expected to provide further testimony on Monday in a case that’s scheduled to last three to four weeks."
