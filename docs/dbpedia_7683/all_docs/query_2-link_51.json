        "text": "Cerberus was a large hound with three heads, live snakes coming out of his body, and a serpent tail. His main role was to guard the gates to Hades’ realm. The hound was so frightening and imposing that his name became a synonym for the ever-vigilant and hostile guard or keeper. Later in Greek mythology he would become the twelfth labor of Heracles (Hercules). He was to detain Cerberus and present him to king Eurystheus.\n\nKey Facts\n\nOrigins of Cerberus\n\nCerberus comes from a very rare and horrible family. He is among the best known of the monsters of Greek mythology, an offspring of Typhon, a monstrous serpentine giant and Echidna, The Mother of Monstrous. Cerberus’s infamous siblings are the fire-breathing Chimera, the Colchian Dragon, the many-headed Lernaean Hydra, the Caucasian Eagle, as well as the two-headed dog Orthrus, and the Crommyonian Sow.\n\nAfter his birth and his unnatural growth, Cerberus was taken by Hades, and subsequently chained at the entrance of the underworld. From then, Cerberus was to guard the gates of Hades’ realm, keeping the dead inside and the living out.\n\nEtymology\n\nCerberus’ name doesn’t have a clear source. Three theories (just like the beast’s heads) suggest that Cerberus can either mean ‘spotted’ or ‘flesh-eating’ from Creoboros or ‘the one that growls’. This latter hypothesis reveals a possible connection based on common roots with the Norse hound Garmr (the guardian of Hel’s gate – the Norse underworld).\n\nImpact\n\nA (near) grotesque creature guarding the way to the last resting place of the deceased always held great importance. In the old days, people viewed the underworld as a place of great struggle and misery. Cerberus was a terrible at first, well-respected beast that conveyed the sanctity of the afterlife. The monster-guardian’s uncanny ferocity simply signified the inevitability and also the futility of death; no mortal can defeat or escape death. In the centuries that followed, Cerberus became a synonym for the watchful and unyielding keeper, sometimes a very dangerous one.\n\nPlay Cerberus Quiz\n\nHow well do you know Cerberus and other Greek monsters?

Try them!\n\nThe myth of Cerberus\n\nThe setting\n\nThe underworld is a dark and mysterious site where the souls of the dead are bound forever. Its dismal and gloomy depths are intimidating and very dangerous. Few among the mortals are brave enough to venture into that sunless pit. And those swiftly turn tail and run once they lay their eyes on the vicious monster that guards its gates of brass.\n\nThe beast\n\nCerberus is the invincible guardian of Hades’ gates. He is big and strong. He has three heads, live snakes on his body and his tail is that of a serpent. Cerberus has a brazen voice and he is known for his malice and mercilessness towards those who dare to approach the gates.\n\nThe hero\n\nFor his twelfth and last labor, Heracles (Hercules) was tasked to capture Cerberus and bring him before the king of Tiryns, Eurystheus. With the help of Hermes, the messenger of the gods and guide of the spirits to the afterlife, and Athena, the goddess of wisdom, Heracles was able to reach the underworld. The demigod hero sought an audience with Hades, in which he asked if he could take Cerberus. Hades agreed on one condition: Heracles, The Strongest Hero had to force Cerberus into submission using only his bare hands.\n\nHeracles accepted this term and was promptly directed to the main gates of Hade’s domain. There, following a long and hard battle with the three-headed keeper, the hero made Cerberus surrender to him after an impossible-to-escape headlock with his powerful arms.\n\nHeracles brought the magnificent and terrifying beast to Eurystheus’ palace, after which it was declared that his labor was a success and his past deeds finally forgiven. Cerberus was then returned to the underworld to resume his duties of guarding and protecting the gates of Hades.\n\nOther appearances\n\nIn another story, Cerberus’s wild and uncontrolled temperament is lulled by Orpheus’ hypnotizing melodies. Orpheus, the legendary musician is determined to find his beloved Eurydice and bring her back to the world of the living. Even though he is frightened by the brutal Cerberus, the young man manages to calm him down by playing his lyre and then passing the gates unharmed.\n\nDepictions\n\nAccording to Hesiod, bloodthirsty Cerberus had fifty heads and a brazen voice. Pindar, the poet, however says that the beast had one hundred heads. Over the years, however, other writers and artists depicted him with three or two heads, and on some occasions with only one. Apart from the heads, he also had a serpent’s tail and writhing snakes forming its mane.\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nThe role and responsibility of Cerberus is to guard forever the gates of Hades. Under his watch, no one passes unnotices in or out of Hades. Cerberus keeps the dead inside – where they belong – and the living away. Those few who don’t heed the warning growls of the three-headed beast suffer the dire consequences.\n\nIn the old texts\n\nGreek\n\nCerberus is mentioned in Hesiod’s Theogony and both Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.\n\nA lost poem by Stesichorus titled “Cerberus” was about the prominent guardian of Hades’ gates.\n\nBacchylides, Diodorus Siculus, Euripides, Pindar, and Plato as well as Sophocles refer to the hound of Hades in various ways.\n\nRoman\n\nIn Aeneid, Virgil writes about Aeneas, the Trojan hero facing Cerberus that blocks the entrance to the underworld with his gigantic body. The Roman poet also brings up Cerberus again in his work Georgics.\n\nHe is also mentioned as well by Horace, Ovid, and Seneca.\n\nFAQs"
