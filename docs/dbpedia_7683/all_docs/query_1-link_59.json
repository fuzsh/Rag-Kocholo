Cerberus will wait until requests are no longer performed. That can be used in order to secure that all page components are fully loaded and does not miss some important ressource hits. In order to do so, Cerberus will check periodically the number of hits generated from the application. When the number of hits stops to grow during that period, Cerberus stop waiting and continue the test.\n\nParameter 'cerberus_networkstatsave_idleperiod_ms' can be used to change the period in millisecond and 'cerberus_networkstatsave_idlemaxloop_nb' can be used in order to limit those checks after a maximum of iteration.\n\n5.3.36. callService\n\nCall a service (REST, FTP, KAFKA,…​) defined the Service Library and provide the output within the execution.\n\nValue1 : Name of the service to call.\n\nValue2 : Nb of Event until the action finish.

No action will be executed and engine will go to the next action or control\n\n5.3.42. removeDifference\n\nDEPRECATED Action that should no longuer used.\n\n5.6. Test Case Property\n\nWhen clicking on Tab , the Property menu will appear. From there you can manage your TestCase properties or see your Inherited Properties - coming from the step libraries of your use steps.\n\nProperties are the key element of your Test Case to manage different variables in the same scenario. A property is identified by its name and the country for which it’s defined (e.g. you cannot have two properties defined for the same country with the same name).\n\nProperties can be called by their name using the following syntaxes:\n\n%property.property_name% : the execution will stop if any problem in the property calculation\n\n%property_name_here% : the execution will not stop if any problem in the property calculation\n\nWhen handling Datalib, the syntaxes to call the subdata are :\n\n%property.property_name.sub_data_name% or %property_name.sub_data_name%\n\n%property.property_name(sub_data_name)% or %property_name(sub_data_name)%\n\nProperties can be called in action or control values field or in another property.\n\n5.7. Test Case Variables\n\nYou can use variables in many area of Cerberus. Those variable are used in order to perform some actions of controls in a dynamic way. 3 types of variables can be created :\n\nVariables defined from properties inside Test Cases.\n\nVariables defined from application object.\n\nSystem Variables\n\nProperties and Application Object are defined by the users while system variable are provided by Cerberus.\n\nThe global syntax of a variable is : %[property|object|system].nameOfTheVariable%\n\nThis is the list of fields in Cerberus where you can use those variables.\n\nAll Test Cases, Steps, Actions and Control descriptions.\n\nCondition Value1 and Value2 at Test Case level.\n\nCondition Value1 and Value2 at Step Test Case level.\n\nCondition Value1 and Value2 at Action Test Case level.\n\nCondition Value1 and Value2 at Control Test Case level.\n\nTest Case Action Value 1, Value 2 and Value 3.\n\nTest Case Control Value 1, Value 2 and Value 3.\n\nTest Case Properties Value 1, Value 2 and Value 3.\n\nPath, Envelope and Method at Test Data Library (SOAP) level.\n\nSQL Script at Test Data Library (SQL) level\n\nColumn, Parsing Answer and Column Position at Test Data Library Subdata definition level\n\nPath, Request, Operation and Attachment URL at Service level.\n\nRequest detail (all keys and values) and Header (all keys and values) at Service level.\n\nWhen a variable is detected in one of those field, Cerberus will replace it by the value during the execution.\n\nIf the variable is an object, the value (that never change) is just replaced.\n\nIf the variable is a system variable, the value is calculated and replaced at the same time (for ex : time defined by %system.TODAY-doy% will be the day and time of the replacement).\n\nIf the variable is a property, it gets automatically calculated at the time of the replacement. If it was already calculated before, the same value (already calculated) is replaced. NOTE: In order to force the calculation of a property at a certain timing, calculateProperty Action can be inserted just before the action is used in a field.\n\nVariables can be defined in a recursive way. That means that the following syntax :\n\n%property.%system.country%% will be first replaced by\n\n%property.FR% and then by FR property value (if it exist).\n\nPlease note also that, if at the end of the decode operation, there are still references to %property.???% or %system.???% or %object.%%% in the field, the corresponding test case will report an error and generate an FA status.\n\n5.7.1. Property Variables\n\nProperty variable allow to have multi row content. As a consequence the full syntax will look like this :\n\n%property.NameOfTheVariable.rowNb.SubData%\n\nIf rowNb is not defined, the 1st row will be used. As a consequence, the syntax %property.rowNb.nameOfTheVariable% is the same as %property.1.nameOfTheVariable%\n\nIf SubData is not defined, the key value subdata will be used.\n\n5.7.2. Object Variables\n\n%object.myobject.value% : Get the application object myobject’s value\n\n%object.myobject.picturepath% : Get the application object myobject’s picture path\n\n%object.myobject.pictureurl% : Get the application object myobject’s picure url\n\n5.7.3. System Variables\n\n5.7.4. Tricks\n\nYou will find below some tricks which help you to implement specific test cases.\n\nNote\n\nIt is possible to create a random property with a number of digit defined. You have to feed the property fields like the screenshot below. This property will be different for each execution. Example: 884592, 004795\n\nSomething is incorrect/missing in this section? Feel free to submit modification.\n\n8.2. Administration\n\nThe 'Executions in Queue' tab from the Executions in queue screen allow to see and count the number of exe in various state.\n\nButton 'Filter Pending' allow to directly filter to QUEUED State.\n\nButton 'Filter Executing' allow to filter state : WAITING, STARTING and EXECUTING\n\nRefresh button allow to refresh the list without fully loading the page.\n\nOn each execution, you can modify its content by clicking on the edit button.\n\nButton 'Save' allow to modify the parameters of the execution.\n\nButton 'Save and submit again' is to save the new parameters and change the status again to QUEUED\n\nButton 'Cancel this execution' is to cancel the execution by moving it state to CANCELLED\n\nYou can also duplicate it to a new execution that will be inserted in QUEUED state by clicking on the duplicate button.\n\nButton 'Copy and submit a new execution' allow to copy the execution to a new one that will be inserted in QUEUED state.\n\nMass Action allow to perform similar operation in a massive way. Select a list of exe and click on Mass Action button in order to open the following screen:\n\n'move to QUEUED' allow to move an execution that is in state ERROR or CANCELLED back to QUEUED state\n\n'copy to QUEUED' allow to copy the list of execution to new executions that will all be in QUEUED state.\n\n'move to CANCELLED' allow to cancel the list of execution that are in state ERROR or QUEUED\n\n'force to CANCELLED' should be used only in very rare occasion when some executions are stuck in WAITING, STARTING or EXECUTING state. That could happen for example if Cerberus has been stopped when executions were still processing.\n\nOn that screen you can massively modify the priority of the execution list. Just put the new priority value and cick on 'Change Priority'\n\n8.4. Constrain management\n\nWhen submitting too many execution in a too short period of time, the result could be uncertain due to overloading the application being tested or robot infrastructure used. In order to prevent that issue, 3 levels of constrains can be defined.\n\nconstrain 'constrain1_global' : Global level of constrain in order to secure that Cerberus itself is not saturated by number of simultaneous execution. Parameter cerberus_queueexecution_global_threadpoolsize allow to configure the number of simultaneous execution will handle in total.\n\nconstrain 'constrain2_applienvironment' : Application/Environment level constrain. An application on a given environment could have some limitation that can be controlled by that constrain. The number of simultaneous execution can be defined in 'Pool Size' field from application screen or Environment screen.\n\nconstrain 'constrain3_application' : Global Application level constrain. An application could have some limitation (whether environment) that can be controlled by that constrain. The number of simultaneous execution can be defined in 'Pool Size' field from application screen.\n\nconstrain 'constrain4_robot' : Robot level constrain. Some robot cannot handle too many execution at the same time. The configuration of simultaneous execution is done at robot host level. Please use public invariant ROBOTHOST in order to define that number of simultaneous execution using gp1 field.\n\nA default value can be configured with parameter cerberus_queueexecution_defaultrobothost_threadpoolsize. That parameter will be used in case the invariant entry does not exist or cannot be converted to numeric value.\n\nNote\n\nOnly the applications that require a robot will enter to that constrain (GUI, IPA, APK, FAT).\n\nThe 'Pools Follow Up' tab allow to control and follow up all those constrain value\n\nIn that example, there is currently 2 executions for a global maximum of 50 executions. A total of 8 executions are still in the queue (that will be treated once the 2 pending will be finished). Saturation level is at 4% and considering that global queue is not saturated, there are no execution pending on saturated queue.\n\nThere is currently 2 executions running against Cerberus application in DEV for RX country. On that application / environment, a total of 6 executions are still in queue. That queue is saturated at 100% and 6 executions are in the queue on that saturated queue.\n\nThere is currently 2 executions running against localhost robot. On that robot host, a total of 7 executions are still in queue. That queue is also saturated at 100% and 7 executions are in the queue on that saturated queue.\n\nSorting the last column will give the constrain/queue that require the most attention in order to speedup the global execution of the campaign.\n\nTIP : In case you have an execution that you don’t understand why it is not released, you can modify for that execution the debug Flag to Y. Next time the queue job execute, the state message will detail the constrain that prevent the execution to be released.\n\nThe 'Queue Job Status' tab allow to monitor the 'queue execution job'.\n\n'Instance Job Activated' is at Y when the job on that instance (Tomcat JVM instance) is allowed to run. Job can be temporary disabled during maintenance period using the manage API.\n\n'Is Queue Job currently running ?' is at Y when the job that analyze the queue is currently running (that should almost never happen).\n\n'Last Queue Job start' correspond to the time when the last job was triggered. That job automatically trigger when a new execution is inserted inside the queue or an execution finish (releasing some space for a new execution to start).\n\nButton 'Stop Queue Job' allow to stop the queue job to be triggered. That will stop submitting new execution keeping all of them into the queue until the job is started again.\n\nButton 'Force Execution' will force the execution in case the job is not automatically triggered.\n\nSomething is incorrect/missing in this section? Feel free to submit modification.\n\n10.1. Create data\n\nA Test Data Library is used to store or define the way to retrieve the data that will be necessary to perform the tests. Different way of getting the data can be used (INTERNAL, SQL, SERVICE or CSV) but that definition is independent from the test case definition so that you can easily change from one to another without impacting all the corresponding test cases.\n\nThe first sub-data does not require a name, it correspond to the key of the datalib and should be unique to that entry. Inside a testcase, if property PROP1 is defined as getFromTestDataLib on that data, that sub data is retreived as %PROP1%. The other sub data values are retreived as %PROP1.SUBDATA1%.\n\nIf you do not select an environment, a system and a country, your data will be available for all environments, systems and countries.\n\nCerberus allows the definition of 4 types : INTERNAL, SQL, CSV and SERVICE\n\n14.5. KAFKA Service\n\nIn order to connect to a Kafka stream, you need to feed the following parameters:\n\nService Path : should have the list of kafka and port target. Ex : kafka-public-company-id.aivencloud.com:27453\n\nKafka Topic : the name of the topic to interact with Ex : cerberus-example\n\nAdditionally, you can define some extra key/value parameters inside Header tab.\n\nEx for connecting to Kafka public Aiven service in SSL mode (value depend from your own configuration) :\n\nsecurity.protocol\n\nSSL\n\nssl.keystore.type\n\nPKCS12\n\nssl.keystore.location\n\n/opt/config/client.keystore.p12\n\nssl.keystore.password\n\npassword\n\nssl.truststore.location\n\n/opt/config/client.truststore.jks\n\nssl.truststore.password\n\npassword\n\nssl.endpoint.identification.algorithm\n\nIn Cerberus, depending on the value provided in Method field, you can :\n\nproduce an event to a topic → PRODUCE\n\nsearch for an event in a topic → SEARCH\n\n14.5.1. PRODUCE\n\nWhen producing an event to Kafka, you should define :\n\n'Kafka Key' that will contain the key of the event produced. Kafka will use that information in order to route it to correct partition.\n\n'Service Request' that will contain the content of the event sent to the corresponding topic.\n\n14.5.2. SEARCH\n\nWhen searching an event from Kafka, at the action level you will be allowed to provide :\n\nNb Evt : That define the max number of event to wait until the action is released with the associated content.\n\nEvt Wait sec : That define the number of second that Cerberus will wait until it gets the target 'Nb Evt' events to retrieve.\n\nCerberus will wait until either the number of event retrieved or time is reached.\n\nWhen a test case contain a callService action with a KAFKA SEARCH method, at the beginning of the execution, Cerberus will automatically store the latest offset of each partition of the selected topic. When the action is reached, Cerberus will automatically search the events starting at the previously saved offset. That prevent Cerberus to search on the full list of events inside the topic securing performance of the test over time.\n\nAdditionally, you can fill a 'Kafka Filter Path' in jsonpath format and corresponding 'Kafka Filter Value' in order to filter the events found to some specific ones.\n\nThe best practice is to generate a functional unique key to Cerberus (e.g. 'cerberus%system.EXECUTIONID%') or use an existing one that will be available in the events to filter the results.\n\nExample\n\nThe results will be stored in the Cerberus elements (as it is done for SOAP/REST response) and filtered will all the elements matching the filter path = value.\n\nTIPS : If you want to have multiples conditions you can use the following syntax as json path :\n\nSomething is incorrect/missing in this section? Feel free to submit modification.\n\nWhen integrating Cerberus with any external tool, public API must be used. All public API are version managed in order to allow secure and stable integration. Each time the signature of the API is modified or behaviour has changed, it is implemented on a new version keeping existing version only subject to bugfix changes.\n\nOld version of Public API can disappear (after a deprecated period) from one version to another. In order to perform the impact analysis of the systems that are calling your Cerberus installation, you can use the parameter cerberus_log_publiccalls. Setting the parameter to Y will log every public API calls performed, reporting any deprecated calls that needs to be migrated to newer version of the same API."
