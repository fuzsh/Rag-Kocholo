The Heads of Cerberus

(1919)

A novel by Francis Stevens

Published only once in book form a half-century ago in a collector's edition of 1500 copies, this great science-fantasy sells for more than $100 today. Written by the woman whose pseudonym was Francis Stevens, it has been hailed as the first alternate history novel. Fantasy master H. P. Lovecraft hailed Francis Stevens as among "the top grade of writers." The Heads of Cerberus tells of "an alternate-world Philadelphia, reached by a handful of this-world people. This Philadelphia is one in which the political corrupters have become ruthless autocrats, ruling through phony "civic service" competitions which result in cynically brutal enslavement of the people. The name of William Penn has become, under the organizational label of "Penn Service," the very fountainhead of viciously depraved, dictatorial government. Definitely a classic and fun to read.
