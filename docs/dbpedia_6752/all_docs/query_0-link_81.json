        "text": "Grand Designs viewers were left in tears after watching an emotional episode in which a doting husband built a dream house for himself and his wife as she recovers from a stroke.\n\nCouple John and Helen, from Dunstable, had been living in a 17th century farmhouse since they married in 2007, having met at Newbury races two years earlier.\n\nBut since Helen, a retired vet, suffered a stroke in 2018, John, a retired racehorse breeder, sought a new start for himself and his wife after the pair had to sleep separately due to Helen struggling to access the main part of the house.\n\nAs viewers were moved by the couple's story, they took to Twitter to send John and Helen their good wishes, saying it was the 'best episode' they had ever watched - particularly as the new house saw the couple properly reunited at the end of the episode in their impressive pavilion-style home.\n\nOne person, who admitted they had been left in tears, said: 'Beautiful family and a beautiful home, I’m so pleased this worked out for them.'\n\nA second viewer said: 'One of the finest episodes we've seen. Family front and centre.'\n\nAnother well-wisher wrote: 'What a man, husband and father John is. I was praying for a nice smooth transition into their new home and it all came together.\n\n'Hopefully they will have their best days together in a beautiful new home.'\n\nAfter her stroke, Helen was left with aphasia, which affects her ability to communicate. As her mobility has also been affected, she struggled with the stairs and narrow doorways in the farmhouse.\n\nAs Helen began her journey to recovery, John decided a change was needed and he bought a two-acre plot nearby on which he wanted to build a new, accessible home for himself and his wife.\n\nWith an estimated cost of £1.3 million, John had planned to demolish the old house on the site and replace it with their custom-built home containing a pavilion and a wildlife garden, designed to aid Helen's recovery.\n\nWith an aim of 16 months to complete the project, the couple employed John's son Ollie as a project manager on the site.\n\nBut after getting off to a good start with several key aspects of the home built within three months, issues begin to crop up with the concrete and steel structures, putting immense pressure on Ollie to keep the project running smoothly.\n\nAnd while there were a few bumps in the road, Ollie came up trumps when he managed to have the project completed a little later than planned in 19 months - with Kevin admitting the finished product was 'remarkable'.\n\nHe described the pavilion-style house as 'more of a fortress' as he went to visit John and Helen at the end of the episode.\n\nSpeaking to the couple on arrival, Kevin asked Helen how her health was, to which she replied: 'Very good.'\n\nJohn joked the family member who was most thrilled with the finished house was their cat, a British Blue, who was pictured strolling around the garden - while their dog seemed less impressed and pressed its face up to the window while it slept.\n\n'I am just full of awe for Ollie, my son. It is a great credit to him,' John told Kevin.\n\nAs the couple walked Kevin through their new house, viewers could see the huge corridors and doorways built into the structure, which were key to making the house as accessible as possible for Helen.\n\nJohn said: 'Helen has loads of space to move around' as he pointed to a lower area that Helen could use in her wheelchair.\n\nThe finished design also included a gym, which John could use to keep fit but was also crucial in Helen's recovery.\n\nHe told Kevin: 'With a stroke sufferer, rehabilitation is, or can be, so slow. You have to be so patient about it all.'\n\nHe added: 'Slowly but surely it is coming together again for Helen.'\n\nIn the next scene, viewers were delighted to see Helen walking arm-in-arm with John, after having to rely on a wheelchair for so long.\n\nAs the couple sat down with Kevin at the end of the episode, John estimated the project had gone over its £1.3million budget by around £500,000.\n\nAlthough he agreed it was a 'hefty rise' he said: 'At the end of the day, it's worth it.'\n\nKevin said: 'I for one wish you a very long and happy and fulfilled joint life here.'\n\nViewers writing on Twitter echoed Kevin's good wishes for the 'delightful family', hoping they would share 'many years of happiness together'.\n\nOne viewer wrote: 'Can only wish the best of health and happiness to the whole family. What a lovely man John is.'"
