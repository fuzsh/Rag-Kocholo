        "text": "RIYADH: When Saudi film director and producer Aymen Khoja started his own company, AK Pictures, two years ago, most of his pitches were rejected by investors. Half-jokingly, he told his business partner that he wished he was a foreigner. “If my hair was blond and my eyes were blue, they would’ve accepted at least five of these projects,” he tells Arab News that he said. “And then I looked at him, like, ‘Oh. This could be an idea.’”\n\nIt was. And now that idea has become “Il Signore,” Khoja’s latest film as director, currently showing in cinemas across the GCC.\n\n“Il Signore” is, Khoja says, “a light comedy” about a Saudi architect called Salem, who has been working hard to earn a promotion. But on the day he comes to the office expecting to be told that he has been successful in his endeavours, he learns that he is being fired instead, because a Westerner working in the company “put in a word” that Salem wasn’t needed anymore.\n\nSalem searches for a new senior-level job, but most of the positions he applies for are taken by expats. Desperate, Salem decides to adopt a fake identity — an Italian called Paolo.\n\n“That’s the fun journey you’ll see in the first 20 or 30 minutes of the film, until he becomes the Italian guy,” says Khoja. “And then his life changes. He gets the Porsche, he gets the high salary, and he gets the lifestyle that he wanted to have as a Saudi. But he doesn’t have it as a Saudi, he has it as an Italian. And then he faces this identity problem. And he has to decide if he can confess to his family or not.\n\n“It’s so different from any other Saudi film,” Khoja continues. “It’s timely. I think it’s very important to discuss these challenges. I don’t want to call this a problem; it’s a challenge that we see around us. We’re not saying Westerners or experts coming from outside, are not adding value. No. They are adding value. At the same time, we’re saying Saudis deserve a chance. And how can we find the right balance between learning from the people coming from outside with experience, and also giving an opportunity to the locals?”\n\nThe film has “nothing to do with politics,” Khoja is quick to stress. “It’s purely comedy. When we made this film, we thought of three things: We wanted to entertain people, we wanted to touch people, and we wanted to fulfill people. We never thought about politics. We’re discussing this issue from a comedic point of view. And the takeaway is just that I think there are some locals that deserve a chance.”\n\nFinding an actor who could portray Salem/Paolo was also a challenge, Khoja says. “The reason why I picked Yasir (Alsaggaf) to act this role is I needed an actor that, when people look at him, they believe that he’s Italian, but they also believe he’s Saudi. That was really hard, but that’s why we cast Yasir.”\n\n“Il Signore” also features Egyptian A-lister Bayoumi Fouad as Paolo’s boss. “The great thing about Bayoumi is, he can play the comedic and the serious at the same time, so you never know, like, ‘Is he serious? Is he joking?’ We needed someone like him to play this part. And you can see that chemistry between Yasir and Bayoumi. It’s there.”\n\nKhoja practiced what he’s preaching in terms of giving Saudis a chance when he was putting his crew together. He estimates it was a roughly even split between Saudis and non-Saudis. “We had people from Tunisia, from Egypt, the UAE. We did the United Arab nation,” he says with a laugh. “But I would say more than 50 percent were Saudi.”\n\nClearly, he’s keen to support Saudi’s blossoming film industry. But he’s also eager to ensure that it is approached as a business, with the need to turn a profit.\n\n“Il Signore,” Khoja says, is a “high-quality, very low” budget film shot over just 18 days, following two months of preparation.\n\n“If you make movies that cost, say, two or three million dollars, how are you going to bring profits from the box office?” he says. “The risk is so high. You don’t need a lot of money. It’s about the stories, the characters… it’s about the idea. Honestly, I asked for this (low) budget specifically. We did this to help stabilize the market. This is a statement, because if we keep spending money to make films that don’t make money, then this industry will not survive. The support of the government isn’t going to last forever. We need the private sector to understand how to make movies within a budget that actually brings in profits so we can build a sustainable industry. That’s the goal. We could have pitched this film for three million dollars, but we chose this budget because now we only need around 50,000 admissions to break even. And our projection is about 250,000 admissions.\n\n“You know, we care about what we do. And we care about building a sustainable industry. It’s such a great industry. You can impact people’s lives,” he continues. “That’s why I love movies. People might be sad, they watch a film, they’re happy, you know? And that’s why I believe in what I’m doing. I like making films because it changes people.”\n\nUltimately, Khoja wants to see not just his own movies flourishing, but the entire Saudi film industry.\n\n“I want to make movies that travel to the 400 million people that live in the Arab world. And I want to help other filmmakers (do that too),” he says. “I want Saudi films to fly.”\n\nDUBAI: Throughout August, Sotheby’s is running “Hafla,” a sale series billed as “a celebration of Middle Eastern art.”\n\n“Hafla” comprises four exhibitions: “Khamseen: 50 Years of Saudi Visual Art,” “Masarat Al-Hibr: Exceptional Qur’anic and Calligraphic Works from the Bashir Mohamed Family Collection,” “A2Z Advisory Jewelry at Sotheby’s,” and an exclusive capsule collection of handbags with designs inspired by Saudi Arabia.\n\n“Khamseen,” Sotheby’s head of sale, modern and contemporary Middle East, Alexandra Roy, says, is the largest component of “Hafla.” It was curated in collaboration with Jeddah’s Hafez Gallery and its founder, Qaswra Hafez, and consists of paintings, sculptures, photography, prints and installations dating from the 1960s up to the present day.\n\n“We’ve known Qaswra Hafez for a long time, and this has been a project that he’s been thinking about doing for a while,” Roy says. “It’s very much overdue. There have been some amazing shows in London on Saudi visual culture and, of course, a lot is happening in the Kingdom right now. It’s an amazing moment to be part of that.\n\n“Sotheby’s was part of the two art biennales in Saudi Arabia, so we’re continuing on from that,” she adds. “We have 60 artists (represented) and it’s the first time some of the works have ever been seen. We go back to circa 1965, and it’s been difficult to source works from as early as that, but we really wanted to show (work) from the pioneers.\n\n“I actually didn’t know a lot of these artists, so I’ve been reading about them, and it’s pretty incredible. A lot of them were sent on scholarships abroad and studied in Italy, in France, and then came back and were responsible for setting up exhibitions themselves. And even after 1979 — the period in which the Kingdom became more conservative — artists really continued producing. They were also really supporting each other.”\n\nThe exhibition also shows, Roy suggests, how the present-day artists in the Kingdom “are responding to the global promotion which they’re now getting.”\n\nHowever, she stresses, “Khamseen” is merely an “introductory” show. “We could have dived so much deeper. I hope it will be the first step towards a few more.”\n\nThe other major Saudi influence in “Hafla” can be found in the capsule collection of handbags created by the UK luxury brand Asprey in collaboration with Nuun, the jewelry house founded by Princess Nourah Alfaisal.\n\n“We’ve been in touch with Princess Nourah for a number of years. She’s such an interesting personality who has a wide variety of personal projects,” says Sophie Stevens, director and jewelry specialist MENA for Sotheby’s. “She’s a very, very prominent figure in the Saudi cultural scene. She was enormously excited when she heard about this exhibition, because it’s a great platform to speak about those initiatives. We’re doing several events and talks and educational initiatives with her during ‘Hafla.’\n\n“Earlier this year she worked very closely with Asprey, to create five designs for their 1781 Asprey pochette bag, using textiles based on the five major regions of Saudi Arabia,” Stevens continues. “And we thought, as part of this initiative on the luxury side, it’s just perfect in terms of a blend between Saudi heritage and one of the oldest British luxury houses.”\n\nThe other part of the luxury side of “Hafla” is the collaboration with A2Z, founded in 2018 by Abdulrahman Al-Zayani, whom Stevens describes as the Gulf’s leading jewelry and art advisor.\n\n“We’re taking over the Sotheby’s salon space on New Bond Street, and we’re going to be exhibiting about 140 pieces that are inspired by Eastern design or have some kind of connection,” she says. “So, we’ve got some great designs from the last century or so — some great art deco pieces, phenomenal colored stones, great diamonds, and then we’ve also got some of the leading contemporary designers at the moment. It’s a great mix. And, again, we’ll be doing a few educational talks. We’re hosting one with (Al-Zayani), based on the art of collecting. It’ll be great to explore that topic with him.”\n\nThe final “Hafla” component presents 28 calligraphic and Qur’anic works from the family collection of the pioneering Islamic art expert Bashir Mohamed.\n\n“We’re starting from the earliest examples of the script from the 9th century up until contemporary iterations in the 21st century,” says Islamic and Indian art specialist Frankie Keyworth. “It’s a mix of Qur’anic leaves and calligraphic secular leaves, just to trace how the script was developed and how each region created its own identity by using the script in some of their works.”\n\nKeyworth highlights two works as particularly special: A bifolio from the famed Blue Qur’an, and an illuminated firman (mandate) bearing the tughra (a calligraphic monogram that served as an official signature) of Suleyman the Magnificent, from 1565 CE.\n\nOf the former, Keyworth says: “We’ve seen individual leaves from the (Blue Qur’an) come to auction, or in exhibitions, but it’s really exciting to have a bifolio because you get the true sense of its scale and of just how impressive it was.”\n\nThe firman, meanwhile, Keyworth describes as “so, so intricate, so finely illuminated. You see this beautiful interaction — how the calligraphic monogram comes together with the decoration to create this work of art in its own right.”\n\n“Hafla” opened at a time when the UK was experiencing civil unrest due in great part to right-wing groups stoking Islamophobia. And although the sale series was planned well in advance, the timing of a showcase of Middle Eastern culture is particularly apposite.\n\n“I think it’s hugely important and a very impactful way to open up greater exchanges and cultural understanding,” says Stevens. “I’m really looking forward to the educational side as well, because I think it’s going to deliver so much more understanding.”\n\nDUBAI: Fede Alvarez is no stranger to horror flicks. The Uruguayan filmmaker first made his mark on Hollywood in 2013 with his take on the 1981 horror classic “Evil Dead.” In 2016, he stepped out of his comfort zone of working with a familiar IP to write and direct “Don’t Breathe,” universally acclaimed by fans of the horror genre, as well as critics.\n\nFast forward to today, and with “Alien: Romulus” he’s paying homage to one of the greatest sci-fi horror franchises of our time.\n\nSet between Ridley Scott’s seminal 1979 original and James Cameron’s 1986 follow-up “Aliens,” “Romulus” acts as an “interquel,” bridging the two films while telling a standalone story.\n\n“There’s an ‘Alien’ movie I’ve been waiting to see for a long time, and so when I was given a chance to do one, I just went and did exactly the things that I wanted to see as a fan,” Alvarez told Arab News.\n\n“I think every movie, even the first one in a saga, has a backstory. In this case, it’s just that those stories happen to be other movies. But if they didn’t exist, it would work anyways. So, you have to do it in a way that a new audience doesn’t feel alienated. It has to work for them. And if you’re a fan, you make all the connections. That’s really the balance you’re trying to find,” he continued.\n\nThe film stars Cailee Spaeny (“Priscilla”), David Jonsson (“Industry”), Archie Renaux (“Shadow and Bone”), Isabela Merced (“Sicario: Day of the Soldado”), Spike Fearn (“Tell Me Everything”), and newcomer Aileen Wu as a ragtag crew of young space colonists looking to find a way off their sunless mining colony. They head out to scavenge a decommissioned space station, hoping to find the technology necessary to leave their doomed planet behind, but instead come face-to-face with a xenomorph.\n\nAlvarez was full of praise for his lead star Spaeny as orphan Rain, who, along with her android ‘brother’ Andy (Jonsson), is just looking to find her way to a more habitable planet.\n\n“I met Cailee a few years ago, she read for me for another project, and I was truly blown away by her presence, her acting skills, and — more than anything — her eyes. When you cast a movie, a great actor will have something that, when you push the camera on them, they save you from a lot of writing. You don’t have to write all this dialog about the bad things that happened in their life. You see in her eyes that she had a tough life even at her young age. She’s already been through a lot. That’s what her eyes convey,” he said.\n\nAlvarez also took time to sit with both Scott, who produced the film, and Cameron as he worked on “Romulus.”\n\n“They are both masters that I really look up to,” he said. “It’s a privilege to be able to even meet them and it’s definitely a privilege to be able to actually work with them and make a movie together. That’s a once-in-a-lifetime privilege.\n\n“(James) Cameron was kind enough to give me some time to tell me his experience making ‘Aliens’ and then he watched the cut of my movie and gave me his thoughts on all the things that had to do with the technology of the film. It really helped me flesh out a lot of the science-fiction ideas,” Alvarez said.\n\n“And to sit down with Ridley Scott — who has made so many great movies — and be able to discuss film and talk about this movie was such a learning experience for me. Every meeting was a masterclass in cinema,” he added. “He had a very strong point of view of what this film should be. I did as well. We didn’t agree all the time and that’s what you want — that’s really when I think the best work comes out; when you have slightly different points of view among a lot of creative people, and you find the truth somewhere.”\n\nDUBAI: Saudi fashion icon Aram Kabbani discusses trends, good and bad advice, and working out.\n\nBest TV show or film you’ve ever seen?\n\nMy favorite TV show is “Friends.” It’s so funny. There are lots of movies I like. I watch the the Egyptian movie “Fi Mahattet Masr,” with Karim Abdel Aziz on a weekly basis. I also love “The Vow.” It’s such a romantic movie and I love romantic movies.\n\nWorst film you’ve ever seen?\n\nSomething about aliens that I watched in the cinema. I don’t remember its name, but it was super-artificial. I prefer real stories.\n\nBest personal style moment so far?\n\nThere was an image where I was wearing a suit from Zara and I had short hair. It was such a spontaneous picture, I just took one shot and that was it. It has thousands of likes. It was a burgundy orange velvet suit that I wore for one of the fashion weeks in London with big, chunky accessories.\n\nWorst personal style moment?\n\nIt was a Versace show. My hair was dark and short. I had burgundy lipstick on and a dark abaya. I styled my hair in a very dramatic way. There was too much going on.\n\nBest accessory for a little black dress?\n\nStatement earrings. The hair is important, but when you have huge earrings, it adds a statement. I love chokers on me, but, generally, earrings attract me more.\n\nWorst accessory for a little black dress?\n\nA lot of bracelets. It distracts people when they are speaking to you and confuses them. They can look very off.\n\nBest fashion trend of 2024?\n\nLong skirts. I love it because it reminds me of my college days. It was a happy moment for me when it came back.\n\nWorst fashion trend of 2024?\n\nSurprisingly, nothing comes to mind. I forget about what looks bad. But one thing that throws me off is wet-look hair. It looks sticky and sometimes not clean.\n\nBest advice you’ve ever been given?\n\nIt’s an Arabic saying that translates to “Lost time is never found again.” I really believe in that. I live by it.\n\nWorst advice you’ve ever been given?\n\n“Chill. Leave it till tomorrow.” I don’t like that. It gives me anxiety when people say it. I’m a Virgo. I’m very, very organized. I have to finish things and be productive.\n\nBest book you’ve ever read?\n\nI don’t really read books. But I like fashion books, coffee-table books and books about the history of fashion.\n\nWorst book you’ve ever read?\n\nChemistry books in school.\n\nBest thing to do when you’re feeling low?\n\nI exercise. I like doing strength training. I do a lot of oxygen chambers and cryotherapy, which is something I have been doing for years, and it’s really good for your wellbeing.\n\nWorst thing to do when you’re feeling good?\n\nRecall a bad memory.\n\nBest holiday destination?\n\nPortofino, Capri and Los Angeles are my three favorite destinations. Portofino is a small and magical island that’s full of life in the morning. It’s very authentic. Italians in general are super-real. I like their vibe and their energy. The food is great. It’s a small village but everything is super-glamorous. At night, it turns into another village, where everything is dark and quiet.\n\nI love LA’s vibes. Everything is pretty in LA, including the people. I’ve been going there for years. It’s also a different fashion scene than any other city. It’s not like Paris or New York. When I go to a city, I like to see good-looking people, and there everyone looks good. Everyone is well dressed.\n\nWorst holiday destination?\n\nAmsterdam. I didn’t like the vibe, or the food. I was told there are a lot of museums and it’s an artistic city, but I just did not like it.\n\nBest subject at school?\n\nBiology. When I graduated from school, I wanted to study microbiology.\n\nWorst subject at school?\n\nChemistry. Well, both physics and chemistry.\n\nBest thing to do to ensure you have a productive day?\n\nWrite a to-do list in the morning. I like to organize everything. It’s good to put your thoughts on a paper, because sometimes you’re all over the place. I make sure I organize my schedule a week ahead.\n\nWorst thing to do when you’re trying to have a productive day?\n\nStress about it. You do nothing when you’re stressed.\n\nBest concert you’ve ever been to?\n\nDavid Guetta in Ibiza, Adele in LA and Fayrouz in Beirut. They were all amazing.\n\nWorst concert you’ve ever been to?\n\nRihanna in California. It was one of those concerts where the performance was just off. People were waiting for something they didn’t get. No one was dancing or vibing.\n\nDADU: As monsoon rains were about to break over Pakistan, 14-year-old Shamila and her 13-year-old sister Amina were married off in exchange for money, a decision their parents made to help the family survive the threat of floods.\n\n“I was happy to hear I was getting married... I thought my life would become easier,” Shamila told AFP after her wedding to a man twice her age in hope of a more prosperous life.\n\n“But I have nothing more. And with the rain, I fear I will have even less, if that is possible.”\n\nPakistan’s high rate of marriages for underage girls had been inching lower in recent years, but after unprecedented floods in 2022, rights workers warn such weddings are now on the rise due to climate-driven economic insecurity.\n\nThe summer monsoon between July and September is vital for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security, but scientists say climate change is making them heavier and longer, raising the risk of landslides, floods and long-term crop damage.\n\nMany villages in the agricultural belt of Sindh have not recovered from the 2022 floods, which plunged a third of the country underwater, displaced millions and ruined harvests.\n\n“This has led to a new trend of ‘monsoon brides’,” said Mashooque Birhmani, the founder of the NGO Sujag Sansar, which works with religious scholars to combat child marriage.\n\n“Families will find any means of survival. The first and most obvious way is to give their daughters away in marriage in exchange for money.”\n\nBirhmani said since the 2022 floods, child marriage has spiked in villages in Dadu district, one of the worst-hit areas that for months resembled a lake.\n\nIn Khan Mohammad Mallah village, where Shamila and Amina were married in a joint ceremony in June, 45 underage girls have become wives since the last monsoon — 15 of them in May and June this year.\n\n“Before the 2022 rains, there was no such need to get girls married so young in our area,” said village elder Mai Hajjani, 65.\n\n“They would work on the land, make rope for wooden beds, the men would be busy with fishing and agriculture. There was always work to be done.”\n\nParents told AFP that they hurried the marriage of their daughters to save them from poverty, usually in exchange for money.\n\nShamila’s mother-in-law, Bibi Sachal, said they gave 200,000 Pakistan Rupees ($720) to the young bride’s parents — a major sum in a region where most families survive on around one dollar a day.\n\nNajma Ali was initially swept up in the excitement of becoming a wife when she married at 14 in 2022 and began living with her in-laws, as is tradition in Pakistan.\n\n“My husband gave my parents 250,000 rupees for our wedding. But it was on loan (from a third party) that he has no way of paying back now,” she said.\n\n“I thought I would get lipstick, makeup, clothes and crockery,” she told AFP, cradling her six-month-old baby.\n\n“Now I am back home with a husband and a baby because we have nothing to eat.”\n\nTheir village, which lies on the banks of a canal in the Main Nara Valley, is barren and there are no fish left in the polluted water — its stench overwhelms the area.\n\n“We had lush rice fields where girls used to work,” said Hakim Zaadi, 58, the village matron and Najma’s mother.\n\n“They would grow many vegetables, which are all dead now because the water in the ground is poisonous. This has happened especially after 2022,” she added.\n\n“The girls were not a burden on us before then. At the age girls used to get married, they now have five children, and they come back to live with their parents because their husbands are jobless.”\n\nChild marriages are common in parts of Pakistan, which has the sixth-highest number of girls married before the age of 18 in the world, according to government data published in December.\n\nThe legal age for marriage varies from 16 to 18 in different regions, but the law is rarely enforced.\n\nUNICEF has reported “significant strides” in reducing child marriage, but evidence shows that extreme weather events put girls at risk.\n\n“We would expect to see an 18 percent increase in the prevalence of child marriage, equivalent to erasing five years of progress,” it said in a report after the 2022 floods.\n\nDildar Ali Sheikh, 31, had planned to marry off his eldest daughter Mehtab while living in an aid camp after being displaced by the floods.\n\n“When I was there, I thought to myself ‘we should get our daughter married so at least she can eat and have basic facilities’,” the daily wage laborer told AFP.\n\nMehtab was just 10 years old.\n\n“The night I decided to get her married, I couldn’t sleep,” said her mother, Sumbal Ali Sheikh, who was 18 when she married.\n\nAn intervention from the NGO Sujag Sansar led to the wedding being postponed, and Mehtab was enrolled in a sewing workshop, allowing her to earn a small income while continuing her education.\n\nBut when the monsoon rains fall, she is overcome by dread that her promised wedding will also arrive.\n\n“I have told my father I want to study,” she said. “I see married girls around me who have very challenging lives and I don’t want this for myself.”\n\nDUBAI: Set to open in 2025, Abu Dhabi’s Saadiyat Cultural District will be home to the Zayed National Museum, the Guggenheim, the city’s Natural History Museum, and a teamLab outpost, with director of the Louvre Abu Dhabi Manuel Rabate telling Arab News the hub aims to offer guests the chance to access world class museums in one location.\n\n“What Abu Dhabi is doing in Saadiyat, doing in this district, it's to gather all sources of curiosity, creativity, inspiration, education. It's an incredibly bold, I would say, commitment and belief in the importance of knowledge, of connection, of openness,” he said.\n\nThe idea has been in motion for years, said Rabate and a lot of brain power has been put into building a concept that is interconnected and part of one narrative in the capital of the UAE.\n\n“The idea to bring world class museums has been communicated for a while. What we see now is the critical moment where the plan is becoming a reality,” he said.\n\nAll the institutions in the district are collaborating on many levels, explained Rabate. Other than sharing the physical vicinity on the island, many of the entities tell different parts of the same story.\n\n“For the visitor experience, it is extremely pleasant, I think, to be able to move from one to the other, going to Zayed National Museum in the morning, an exhibition at Guggenheim to then having dinner at the Louvre Abu Dhabi and maybe catching a late show at Berklee, there is collaboration between institutions. Each one has its own mandate and its own narrative,” he explained.\n\nWith art, historical and technological institutions, the Saadiyat Cultural District positions itself as a unique global platform dedicated to celebrating Abu Dhabi’s traditions and embracing modernity."
