        "text": "A low-budget Irish comedy that initially went under the radar in 2022 has now become a huge hit on Netflix.\n\nThe coming-of-age comedy-drama, Joyride, features Oscar-winning actress Olivia Colman and is the first feature film from Dublin-based Emmy-nominated documentary filmmaker, Emer Reynolds.\n\nSet in the beautiful Co Kerry and filmed in the southwest of Ireland, the movie follows the unlikely friendship between a self-reliant 12-year-old boy and a middle-aged lawyer spiraling out of control with a newborn baby as they journey across Ireland.\n\nBono's daughter Eve Hewson fires back at nepo baby claims with 13-word slap down\n\nLiam Neeson's 'remarkable' gritty new thriller set in rural Ireland that divided critics is now available online\n\nHere's the official synopsis for Joyride: \"12-year-old Mully (Charlie Reid) has lost his mother, and discovers his debt-ridden father stealing the charity money they've raised in her name.\"\n\n\"Grabbing the cash, Mully flees the scene, steals a taxi and is shocked to find a woman, Joy (Olivia Colman), passed out in the back seat with a baby. Joy, an inadvertent mother, has decided to give her child away to a friend and leave the country.\"\n\nFOLLOW ALL THE LATEST ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\n\"This mismatched pair, a compassionate but troubled adolescent and a complicated, no-nonsense solicitor, set off on a road trip where they will ultimately find deep friendship and a happier way to journey through life.\"\n\nJoyride was released in cinemas in July 2022, but failed to make much of an impression on audiences, grossing just under $100,000 at the worldwide box office.\n\nThe film \"Joyride\" has been given a new spotlight after being released on Netflix this past week, quickly ascending to the top of the streaming giant's UK and Ireland film charts.\n\n\"Joyride,\" featuring a shared road trip adventure in Ireland, has become the number one movie on Netflix in the UK and Ireland, earning plaudits for its warm-hearted nature.\n\nA fan expressed their delight on X, previously known as Twitter: \"Oh, blimey. Joyride over on the Netflix is an absolute joy of a film. Charlie Reid, the sixteen co-star to Olivia Colman is going to go far. Tender, funny and warm. It was just what I needed tonight. It will go straight to your heart. Night, you lot.\"\n\nMany other spectators were touched by the dramatic yet comedic movie that includes an appearance by comedian Tommy Tiernan, finding themselves quite moved.\n\nBarry Keoghan's ex likes fiery comments after Sabrina Carpenter's latest song\n\nOne watcher said, \"Watched joyride on Netflix thinking it was going to be a silly little comedy film with Olivia Colman.... I'm SOBBING,\" while another praised, \"#Joyride .. I've so many words but very little to explain just how amazing this film is .. just watch it! \".\n\nFinally, another viewer provided a heartfelt review: \"Watched #OliviaColeman in an Irish film, #JoyRide on #Netflix. A woman coming to terms with an unexpected birth later in life, meets a young teenager grieving for his mum, wiser than his years, but lost for love. A mix of comedy, pathos, stunning scenery, and escapism 8/10.\""
