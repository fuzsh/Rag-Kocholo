        "text": "Sangamon County Sheriff Jack Campbell on Aug. 1 defended his agency's vetting of former deputy and accused murder Sean Grayson.\n\nCampbell, 60, has said he won't resign amid public criticism in the wake of the shooting death of Sonya Massey, a Black woman, at the hand of Grayson, who is white. And Campbell disagreed with statements from a police-reform expert who said the background investigation of Grayson by the sheriff's office was negligent.\n\n\"There was no indication that anything in his background would lead to a violent event like that,\" Campbell said in his first round of news media interviews after the nationally publicized incident between a 30-year-old white police officer and a 36-year-old, unarmed Black woman inside her home.\n\n\"There was nothing in his background that would disqualify him from being a police officer in Illinois,\" the sheriff told Illinois Times.\n\nCampbell, a Republican who is halfway through his second four-year term as sheriff, said Grayson was never fired from one of the five part-time and full-time police agencies he worked for in the three years before he joined the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office in May 2023.\n\nHowever, experts said a combination of Grayson's frequent job moves, serious misconduct in the military and integrity issues at former jobs should have been a glaring warning about Grayson as a candidate.\n\n\"In this particular circumstance, there were enough red flags or things that you go, 'Wow, there's a problem here,'\" said Chris Burbank, a former longtime chief of the Salt Lake City Police Department.\n\nCampbell said he would be willing to work with state officials to improve communication among police agencies about personnel issues when evaluating applicants. He said he has told people who handle hiring in his office \"to be as thorough as possible\" since Massey's death sparked protests locally, statewide and nationally.\n\n\"My standard is now that 'I want you to figure out a way not to hire this person,'\" Campbell said. \"That is my new standard ... I want you to do your best to keep this person from being hired.\n\n\"That's not really an angle we ever took,\" he said. \"If you thought about it, it's a negative angle, but I think that it's a good idea for us to take that angle and then again work with these other entities about trying to find a way to ensure we get all the information.\"\n\nCampbell added: \"Good cops do not want bad cops. We want to get rid of them. It puts a mark on all of us.\"\n\nGrayson has been charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a firearm and official misconduct after shooting and killing Massey in her home in the early morning hours of July 6 after she called for help thinking there was a prowler outside her home in the Cabbage Patch neighborhood of unincorporated Sangamon County, just outside Springfield.\n\nInvisible Institute, IPM News and Illinois Times obtained Grayson's personnel file and application materials through a public records request to the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office. After reviewing these records, Burbank said he believes the sheriff's office was negligent in hiring Grayson.\n\n\"My bottom line â€“ they were insufficient in evaluating this individual's background before hiring, and to the extent, I believe they negligently hired this person, and bear some responsibility for his poor actions,\" said Burbank, who is now a law enforcement strategy consultant with the Denver-based Center for Policing Equity.\n\nCampbell responded, saying, \"That's his opinion and speculation.\"\n\nHe added that a job recommendation his office received from Scott Butterfield, a retired Sangamon County deputy and the father of Grayson's fiance, had \"very little\" influence on the decision to hire Grayson.\n\nIn a summary of the sheriff's office's background investigation, Lt. Wes Wooden wrote that Butterfield told him Grayson was a \"mellow, non-confrontational person who has good communication skills.\"\n\nFast forward to July 2024. Campbell's chief deputy, Anthony Mayfield, wrote a letter to the sheriff's office's Merit Commission on July 17, the same day Grayson was charged with murder and fired by Campbell. The five-member Merit Commission administers written tests to entry-level job applicants and is informed of disciplinary action.\n\nMayfield said Grayson \"immediately escalated to deadly force\" after Massey told Grayson in her home, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\"\n\nMayfield wrote: \"The body-camera video shows that the inappropriate escalation of force set in motion a series of events that led to Deputy Grayson shooting (Massey) in the head. Based on the decedent's non-aggressive behavior, the circumstances existed for Deputy Grayson to attempt nonviolent strategies and techniques. And his failure to communicate or use a less-than-lethal alternative led to the death of Ms. Massey.\"\n\nAt a community meeting July 29, Campbell said his department \"failed the community\" and failed Massey and her family. But he told Illinois Times that his statement didn't mean his office made mistakes in hiring Grayson, a Riverton resident.\n\nThe hiring process for Grayson has spurred several Democrats on the Republican-controlled Sangamon County Board, including Marc Ayers, to call for Campbell to resign.\n\nAyers, a Springfield resident who represents District 12 and sits on the board's Jail Committee, which oversees the sheriff's office, said the sheriff's hiring process needs to be overhauled to include more input from county employees.\n\n\"Before all this happened, we knew absolutely nothing. And not just about the former deputy, literally any deputy that comes on,\" Ayers said. \"We literally know nothing about them.\"\n\nThe County Board is really just \"holding the purse strings,\" Ayers said.\n\nOnce the board approves the budget to hire a new officer, the only information County Board members see about a new hire is their name, Ayers said.\n\nReforming the hiring system is the top priority for many board members after the death of Sonya Massey, Ayers said.\n\n\"That process has got to get looked at first and foremost, because I think having sole hiring authority being done behind closed doors is not building public trust,\" he said.\n\nCampbell has said he won't resign from his $165,373-a-year job. and hasn't decided whether to run for another term in 2026.\n\nQuestionable references\n\nAt the Logan County Sheriff's Office, where Grayson worked immediately before being hired at Sangamon County, Grayson was investigated for initiating a traffic pursuit that reached 110 miles per hour and ended with him hitting a deer after he had turned his lights and sirens off, but was still traveling at a high speed.\n\nDuring the investigation, Logan County Chief Deputy Nathan Miller made clear he believed that Grayson had lied in his official report documenting his reasoning for initiating the stop in the first place.\n\nGrayson stated that he'd seen a woman suspiciously slide down in her seat in a parked pickup truck after making eye contact with him, but Miller demonstrated through Google Maps and video footage that Grayson could not have physically seen what he claimed to have seen based on his location.\n\nBased on what Grayson had written in his report, Miller said, \"You got a report-writing violation for policy. You got an accuracy violation for policy. You got a standard-of-conduct violation for policy.\"\n\nCraig Futterman, who directs the University of Chicago Civil Rights and Police Accountability Clinic, described the traffic stop to Invisible Institute and IPM News as a \"classic pretext stop,\" based solely on Grayson's suspicion, without any evidence, that some potential crime had occurred. Futterman said Grayson's decision to escalate the stop to a high-speed pursuit was an extreme example \"of poor judgment.\"\n\nDespite these issues with the case, all that existed in the official written documentation for the investigation was that Grayson admitted his memory failed him, and that he needed more training on \"high-stress decision making.\"\n\nCampbell blamed Logan County for failing to provide additional material and implied that Sangamon County asked for background information that ended up not being turned over.\n\nCampbell told Illinois Times that he talked with Logan County Sheriff Mark Landers after Massey's death. Campbell didn't say specifically whether Sangamon County asked Landers for a broad range of information from Grayson's personnel file.\n\n\"All I know is that he verified that we didn't get the information that we had sought,\" Campbell said. He told WCIA-TV that he relies on \"professional courtesy\" when contacting applicants' previous employers.\n\nA spokesperson for Landers said he will not speak to the media about Grayson.\n\nWooden of the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office summarized Grayson's time at the Logan County agency in a paragraph that quoted Jerry Mayes, a former coworker of Grayson's who also was a personal reference.\n\nWooden wrote that Mayes said Grayson is a \"good deputy\" who \"needs more extensive training.\"\n\nHowever, Burbank said the Sangamon County background investigator should have also been able to uncover what reporters were eventually able to find.\n\n\"The two most important things you can do as a police chief is hire people and fire people,\" Burbank said. \"Those are the only two things you have control over.\"\n\nIn the background investigation, the other personal reference listed was Butterfield, a longtime official with the sheriff's office who retired from the office in 2020.\n\nIn a podcast interview released May 7, nearly two months before Massey's death, Campbell discussed how family ties play into his hiring decisions.\n\nSharing that he is a \"legacy\" with the sheriff's office due to his father working there, Campbell said, \"I look for things like that\" when evaluating applicants.\n\n\"If we have a connection when we're looking for young applicants, do you have a connection with law enforcement â€“ especially the sheriff's office? Even if it's two or three degrees separated, there's still some connection there,\" Campbell said on The Table podcast, released by Springfield cleaning company Peerless Cleaning & Restoration Services.\n\n\"If you have that type of connection to an agency, then you really, I think, put in the effort and you wanna do right by your family,\" Campbell said. \"Your family knows that other people were there, could be an uncle or something, so I think that also ties us down\" when parsing through applications.\n\nAfter Campbell said Aug. 1 that Butterfield's recommendation didn't play much of a role in the decision to hire Grayson, the sheriff added: \"I've lived here my entire life. I've been in law enforcement for 30 years plus, and I know a lot of people. So I end up inevitably knowing some of the people that are listed as references or neighbors or something.\n\n\"I considered it, but it didn't change my feeling about Grayson. It was simply, OK, he will get an interview like everybody else, and we'll see how it plays out.\"\n\nCampbell told the podcast hosts that he thinks the sheriff's office has the \"best\" application process when compared with other local law enforcement. After applicants pass the physical and written tests, he said, they're entered into \"this giant pool\" of potential deputies.\n\n\"We can pluck anybody from that pool,\" Campbell said. \"We don't have any sort of order you have to go in by how you scored or anything, so I think we have the best process to hand-select the best people.\"\n\nAyers, the Sangamon County Board member, said: \"Nepotism runs thick in Sangamon County. That makes me question â€“ are we hiring the most qualified individuals? Or are we just hiring folks that know someone that knows someone else? Because that's inappropriate.\"\n\nNo investigation into Army discharge for serious misconduct\n\nThe Sangamon County Sheriff's Office did have Grayson's records from the U.S. Army showing he was discharged because of serious misconduct. However, no records were included about what this serious misconduct was.\n\nAccording to Campbell, he believed Grayson's DUI in 2015 was the reason for his discharge from the military because of a letter Grayson's former commanding officer wrote in his application to the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"Aside from Mr. Grayson's DUI, there were no other issues that he had during his tenure in the Army,\" Master Sergeant Ray Benekin wrote in a letter of reference.\n\n\"Past DUI convictions are not disqualifying criteria for a deputy,\" Campbell wrote in an online statement July 31. \"We recognize that individuals can change and improve over time.\"\n\nThe letter from Benekin, however, should have been a \"red flag,\" said Joshua Kastenberg, a former judge, prosecutor and defense counsel with the Air Force.\n\nThe letter wasn't relevant to Grayson's application to become a sheriff's deputy, Kastenberg said, because Benekin wrote it as a letter of reference to help Grayson someday get back into some branch of the military.\n\n\"If he can join the Navy, I have no doubt he will be a great asset and work very hard to be the best,\" Benekin wrote in his unsigned, undated letter.\n\nThe letters from Benekin and another sergeant who also discussed Grayson returning to the military \"don't apply to a police department application,\" said Kastenberg, who currently is a University of New Mexico law professor.\n\n\"Whoever's responsible should have looked at those and said, 'This is a big red flag,'\" Kastenberg said. \"At best, what they did was negligent.\"\n\nExperts consulted by Invisible Institute and IPM News have said it's possible but unlikely that the DUI was, by itself, the sole reason for the discharge. Experts said it's more likely that other misconduct occurred to warrant such a discharge.\n\nPublic records requests are pending with various Army offices for records about Grayson's service and discharge.\n\nAs a police chief who used to hire officers, Burbank said military records are often difficult to get. However, he said discharge records because of serious misconduct should have prompted the sheriff's office to find out more.\n\nCampbell said he had no reason to doubt Benekin, even though the reference letter wasn't an official document from the Army.\n\n\"I have no idea if it's correct or not,\" Campbell said. \"If he misled us, I would think that would endanger his career. ... I don't know how you get information out of the military.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office said in an online post that Grayson's application was sent to the Merit Commission for review and certification.\n\nHowever, Springfield lawyer Patrick \"Tim\" Timoney, a former Sangamon County Democratic Party chairperson and chairperson of the Merit Commission, said the Merit Commission doesn't review and certify applications. It also doesn't do background checks, he said.\n\nThe commission mainly exists to administer written tests to entry-level applications for deputy and correctional officer applicants, Timoney said.\n\nThe commission has no say over police who apply from other agencies to become deputies. Campbell and other top officials from the sheriff's office evaluate those applications, Timoney said.\n\nHe added that he talked with Campbell recently about expanding the commission's role in the hiring process for deputies. Such an expansion would require a change in rules governing the commission, Timoney said.\n\nExpert says \"red flags\" were missed\n\nHiring processes that don't investigate \"red flags\" allow officers like Grayson to move from department to department without accountability, Burbank said.\n\n\"Across the country, you have officers that move from agency to agency, and they have substandard performance that is either not documented whatsoever, or is documented and then not passed on,\" Burbank said. \"So people end up being hired that really shouldn't be police officers anymore but continue to perpetuate this problem.\"\n\nOther figures in policing have also spoken out about what they see as clear issues with the hiring process at the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"If a police chief/sheriff believes this was a thorough hiring process, you're wrong,\" Thomas Weitzel, former chief of the Riverside Police Department in Chicago's west suburbs, wrote on social media.\n\n\"Sonya Massey was killed by an officer who drifted from one law enforcement job to another after leaving the Army after a serious offense,\" wrote Cedric Alexander, a former police and public safety official in Minneapolis, suburban Atlanta and Rochester, New York, in an MSNBC op-ed. \"It doesn't appear that any of the departments that hired him thoroughly vetted him. How could they have hired him if they had?\" Both cited Invisible Institute and IPM News' coverage of Grayson's Army discharge.\n\nCampbell defended his decision to hire Grayson despite his moves from department to department.\n\n\"Grayson's employment history shows that he was employed by five different law enforcement agencies prior to applying to the Sangamon County Sheriff's Office,\" Campbell wrote online. \"This is a standard career path in this field. What I prefer to see is movement to progressively larger and more structured agencies with higher levels of public interaction, which indicates professional growth and ambition.\"\n\nGrayson passed a drug test, criminal background check and psychological evaluation and graduated from a 16-week training academy before serving as a Sangamon County deputy.\n\nBut Ayers said building a new way to screen and hire deputies is essential to rebuild the public's trust after Massey's death and the nationwide scrutiny on policing in Sangamon County.\n\n\"The public trust has been decimated at this point from what happened with Sonya Massey,\" Ayers said. \"There has got to be another body that reviews applications and background checks [to] screen candidates before they even get to Sheriff Campbell for hire.\""
