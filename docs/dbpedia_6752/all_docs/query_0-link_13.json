        "text": "Mark your calendars for the next installment of the Lumen Christi Speaker Series!\n\nThis talk will feature Fr. Robert Spitzer providing his message on “Science, Medicine, and the Shroud of Turin” held on Thursday, August 22 at 7:00PM at the Christ Cathedral Freed Theatre. Fr. Robert Spitzer is President of the Magis Center of Reason and Faith, as well as the Napa Institute. He has authored multiple award-winning books and many scholarly articles on faith and science, metaphysics, and happiness and ethics, and has his own weekly EWTN television show called Father Spitzer’s Universe.\n\nPre-registration is required to save your seat. Cost is free to those who are registered in the Lumen Christi Institute. If not, it is $25. Secure your seat or learn more through the link below.\n\nThe Diocese of Orange is so grateful to have taken part in the 2024 National Eucharistic Congress. All three of our bishops and members of our diocese participated in everything from enlightening workshops to a Eucharistic procession with thousands of the faithful through the streets of Indianapolis.\n\nListen, learn, and be inspired by checking out the 2024 National Eucharistic Congress video playlist on Youtube. This is just the beginning, #Revival is truly here!\n\nDeacon Angelo Giambrone was ordained as a permanent deacon for the Diocese of Orange. He and wife Cindy have supported several ministries at their parish, St. Vincent de Paul Church in Huntington Beach. In this episode, they speak with Rebecca Freeman of the Office for Family Life in the Diocese of Orange. The discussion centers around the ‘Care of the Whole Person Initiative.’ Tune in and find out all about it!\n\nAs we wind down the summer season and prepare for back-to-school, this week we dig into our vast podcast program archives. This episode of Empowered by the Spirit with Deacon Steve Greco was recorded and aired on local Catholic radio a few years back. This show got a lot of traction at the time because of the dynamics of the topic: how do we best implement and benefit from small faith sharing groups?\n\nDeacon Steve is joined by Katie Hughes, lay evangelist and prayer group minister, as well as Spirit Filled Hearts team member Michael Aimola. Is there a special takeaway that we can gain by sharing with other believers in a small group setting? What input do YOU have to share?\n\nThe Catholic Biblical Institute in the Diocese of Orange is devoted to empowering the faithful to deepen their understanding of Sacred Scripture and confidently share their faith with others. This institute offers a comprehensive biblical education program with 3 levels of courses, starting with a retreat and progressing to in-depth studies of individual biblical books.\n\nThe Catholic Biblical Institute is hosting Level 1 course opportunities and Spring Biblical Retreats."
