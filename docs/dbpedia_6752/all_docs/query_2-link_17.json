The movie is a raw crime drama-thriller depicting the Italian mob, the Catholic Church and family life in New Jersey. The cast is composed of all New Jersey locals/non-actors, making this one of the first modern neorealist Italian mob films. Vinny Dapello confesses his sins and unveils the ugly truth of his life; he is a hitman for the New Jersey Italian mob. Will he follow his father's footsteps in the organized crime family or sacrifice his life to save his soul?",
