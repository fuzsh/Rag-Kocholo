        "text": "Due to the secretive nature of Hollywood accounting, it is not clear which film is the most expensive film ever made. Star Wars: The Force Awakens officially holds the record with a net budget of $447 million (although it is possible that Avatar: The Way of Water costs more if its price tag is towards the upper-end of its reported $350–460 million production costs). The third and fourth Avengers films (Infinity War and Endgame) stand as the most expensive back-to-back film production, with combined production costs of over $1 billion, according to one of the directors.\n\nInflation, filming techniques and external market forces affect the economics of film production. Costs rose steadily during the silent era with Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925) setting a record that lasted well into the sound era. Television had an impact on rising costs in the 1950s and early 1960s as cinema competed with it for audiences, culminating in 1963 with Cleopatra; despite being the highest earning film of the year, Cleopatra did not earn back its costs on its original release. The 1990s saw two thresholds crossed, with True Lies costing $100 million in 1994 and Titanic costing $200 million in 1997, both directed by James Cameron. Since then it has become normal for a tent-pole feature from a major film studio to cost over $100 million and an increasing number of films are costing $200 million or more.\n\nThis list contains only films already released to the general public and not films that are still in production or post-production, as costs can change during the production process. Listed below is the net negative cost: the costs of the actual filming, not including promotional costs (i.e. advertisements, commercials, posters, etc.) and after accounting for tax subsidies. The charts are ordered by budgets that have been independently audited or officially acknowledged by the production companies where they are known; most companies will not give a statement on the actual production costs, so often only estimates by professional researchers and movie industry writers are available. Where budget estimates conflict, the productions are charted by lower-bound estimates.\n\nMost expensive productions (unadjusted for inflation)\n\n[edit]\n\nOnly productions with a net budget of over $200 million in nominal U.S. dollars are listed here. Due to the effects of inflation, all of the films on the chart have been produced in the 21st century.\n\nMost expensive films Rank Title Year Cost (est.)\n\n(millions) Refs and notes 1 Star Wars: The Force Awakens 2015 $447 [1][nb 1] 2 Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom 2018 $432 [2][nb 2] 3 Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker 2019 $416 [1][nb 1] 4 Fast X 2023 $379 [3] 5 Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides 2011 $379 [4][nb 3] 6 Avengers: Age of Ultron 2015 $365 [5][nb 4] 7 Avengers: Endgame 2019 $356 [6][nb 5] 8 Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness 2022 $351 [7] 9 Avatar: The Way of Water 2022 $350 [8][nb 6] 10 Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny 2023 $326 [9][nb 7] 11 Avengers: Infinity War 2018 $325 [10][nb 5] 12 Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End 2007 $300 [11][12][nb 8] Justice League 2017 $300 [13][14][15][nb 9] Star Wars: The Last Jedi 2017 $300 [1][nb 1] 15 Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One 2023 $291 [16] 16 Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania 2023 $276 [17] 17 Solo: A Star Wars Story 2018 $271 [1][nb 1] 18 Jurassic World Dominion 2022 $265 [2][nb 2] 19 John Carter 2012 $264 [18][nb 10] 20 Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 2016 $263 [19][nb 11] 21 Tangled 2010 $260 [20][21][22][23] 22 Spider-Man 3 2007 $258 [24] 23 Beauty and the Beast 2017 $255 [25] 24 Eternals 2021 $254 [26][nb 12] 25 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince 2009 $250 [27][28] Furious 7 2015 $250 [29][30][nb 13] The Fate of the Furious 2017 $250 [31][nb 14] The Lion King 2019 $250 [32][nb 15] No Time to Die 2021 $250 [33][nb 16] Thor: Love and Thunder 2022 $250 [34] Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 2022 $250 [35] Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 2023 $250 [36] 33 Black Widow 2021 $248 [37][nb 17] 34 Spectre 2015 $245 [38][39][nb 18] 35 The Little Mermaid 2023 $240 [40][nb 19] 36 Avatar 2009 $237 [41][nb 20] 37 Rogue One 2016 $232 [1][nb 1] 38 The Dark Knight Rises 2012 $230 [42][nb 21] Captain America: Civil War 2016 $230 [19][nb 22] Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales 2017 $230 [43][44][45] 41 Maleficent 2014 $226 [46][nb 23] 42 The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian 2008 $225 [47] The Lone Ranger 2013 $225 [48][nb 24] Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest 2006 $225 [11][49][nb 8] Man of Steel 2013 $225 [50][51][nb 25] 46 The Avengers 2012 $220 [52][53][54][55] The Marvels 2023 $220 [56][nb 26] 48 The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug 2013 $217 [58] Transformers: The Last Knight 2017 $217 [59][nb 27] 50 Men in Black 3 2012 $215 [60][nb 28] Oz the Great and Powerful 2013 $215 [61][nb 29] 52 X-Men: The Last Stand 2006 $210 [62][63] Transformers: Age of Extinction 2014 $210 [64][65][66] 54 Battleship 2012 $209 [67] Dawn of the Planet of the Apes 2014 $209 [46][nb 30] The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies 2014 $209 [46][nb 31] 57 King Kong 2005 $207 [68][69][70] 58 X-Men: Days of Future Past 2014 $205 [46][nb 32] Tenet 2020 $205 [71] Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom 2023 $205 [72] 61 Superman Returns 2006 $204 [73][74][nb 33]\n\nMost expensive back-to-back film productions Rank Titles Years Cost (est.)\n\n(millions) Refs and notes 1 Avengers: Infinity War\n\nAvengers: Endgame 2018–19 $1,000 [75][nb 5] 2 The Hobbit trilogy 2012–14 $623 [76][nb 34] 3 Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: At World's End 2006–07 $450 [77][nb 8] 4 The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 and Part 2 2014–15 $300 [78] 5 The Lord of the Rings trilogy 2001–03 $260 [79][80][nb 35] 6 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2 2010–11 $250 [81][82] 7 The Matrix Reloaded\n\nThe Matrix Revolutions 2003 $237 [nb 36] 8 The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 1 and Part 2 2011–12 $230 [nb 37]\n\n*Officially acknowledged figure.\n\nMost expensive films (adjusted for inflation)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe productions listed here have their nominal budgets adjusted for inflation using the United States Consumer Price Index[86] taking the year of release. Charts adjusted for inflation are usually ordered differently, because they are dependent on the inflation measure used and the original budget estimate.\n\nThe Soviet War and Peace, released in four parts across 1966 and 1967, is sometimes cited as the most expensive production ever: Soviet claims stating it cost $100 million (estimated at nearly $700 million accounting for inflation forty years after its release) were circulated in the American press during its showing there. However, its financial records reveal it cost slightly more than $9 million (about $60–70 million in today's money).[nb 38] Another notable omission is Metropolis, the 1927 German film directed by Fritz Lang, often erroneously reported as having cost $200 million at the value of modern money. Metropolis cost $1.2–1.3 million at the time of its production, which would be about $24 million at 2021 prices, according to the German consumer price index.[nb 39]\n\nMost expensive films adjusted for inflation Rank Title Year Cost (est.)

W. Griffith's Intolerance (1916) was reputed to have cost $2 million, but accounts show that it only cost $385,906.77;[215] additionally, A Daughter of the Gods (1916) was advertised as costing a million dollars, but Variety estimated its true cost at $850,000.[141] The first film that is confirmed to have had a $1 million budget is Foolish Wives (1922), with the studio advertising it as \"The First Real Million Dollar Picture\".[113]\n\nThe most expensive film of the silent era was Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925),[141] costing about $4 million—twenty-five times the $160,000 average cost of an MGM feature.[214] It is unclear which sound-era production superseded it as the most expensive film, although this is commonly attributed to Hell's Angels (1930), directed by Howard Hughes; the accounts for Hell's Angels show it cost $2.8 million, but Hughes publicised it as costing $4 million, selling it to the media as the most expensive film ever made.[216] The first film to seriously challenge the record was Gone with the Wind, reported to have cost about $3.9–4.25 million,[141] although sources from the time state that Ben-Hur and—erroneously—Hell's Angels cost more.[217] Ben-Hur was definitively displaced at the top of the chart by Duel in the Sun in 1946.\n\nThe 1950s saw costs rapidly escalate as cinema competed with television for audiences,[218] culminating with some hugely expensive epics in the 1960s that failed to recoup their costs.[141] A prominent example of this trend was Cleopatra (1963), which lost money on its initial release despite being the highest-grossing film of the year.[219] Since the 1990s, film budgets have once again seen a dramatic increase as the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) has become commonplace in big-budget features.[220]\n\nTimeline of the most expensive million dollar films Year Production Cost (est.)\n\n(millions) Refs and notes 1922 Foolish Wives $1.104 [113] 1922 When Knighthood Was in Flower $1.5 [214] 1923 The Ten Commandments $1.476 [221] 1925 Ben-Hur $3.967 [222][223] 1939 Gone with the Wind $3.9–4.25 [141] 1946 Duel in the Sun $5.255 [141] 1947 Forever Amber $6.375 [141] 1951 Quo Vadis $7.623 [141] 1956 The Ten Commandments $13.272 [221] 1959 Ben-Hur $15.175 [141] 1962 Mutiny on the Bounty $19 [224][225] 1963 Cleopatra $31.115 [141][nb 41] 1978 Superman $55 [212][213] 1988 Rambo III $58–63 [141][226] Who Framed Roger Rabbit $58.166 [227][nb 46] 1990 Total Recall $50–60 [229][230][nb 47] Die Hard 2 $62–70 [233][228][nb 47] 1991 Terminator 2: Judgment Day $94 [234][235][236] 1994 True Lies $100 [237][238][nb 48] 1995 Waterworld $172 [123][124][nb 40] 1997 Titanic $200 [112][113][114] 2005 King Kong $207 [68][69][70] 2006 X-Men: The Last Stand $210 [62][63] Superman Returns $204 [73][74][nb 33] Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest $225 [11][49] 2007 Spider-Man 3 $258 [24] Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End $300 [11][12] 2011 Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides $379 [4][nb 3] 2015 Star Wars: The Force Awakens $447 [1][nb 1]\n\nTimeline of the most expensive back-to-back film productions Year Production Cost (est.)\n\n(millions) Refs and notes 1990 Back to the Future Part II and Part III (1989–1990) $80 [246] 2003 The Matrix Reloaded\n\nThe Matrix Revolutions $237 [nb 36] The Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–2003) $260 [79][80][nb 35] 2007 Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) $450 [77][nb 8] 2014 The Hobbit trilogy (2012–2014) $623 [76][nb 34] 2019 Avengers: Infinity War (2018)\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2019) $1,000 [75][nb 5]\n\n* Officially acknowledged figure.\n\n† The figure given is the cost of a multi-film production, where the films are produced simultaneously.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm finance\n\nList of biggest box-office bombs\n\nList of highest-grossing films\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
