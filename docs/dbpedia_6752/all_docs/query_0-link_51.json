        "text": "Kelly Clarkson and Brandon Blackstock have reportedly come to a settlement in their divorce, which will include a huge payment from the pop star to her onetime manager.\n\nAccording to The Blast, Clarkson will make a onetime, tax-free payment of $1,326,161 million to her ex-husband as part of the settlement, on top of ongoing monthly child support payments of $45,601 for their two children, seven-year-old River Rose and five-year-old Remington Alexander. The former couple has also agreed to joint custody of their kids, who will live primarily with Clarkson in Los Angeles.\n\nThe agreement also stipulates that both of their children will be vaccinated against COVID-19, an issue “connected to the travel back and forth to see their father out of state,” according to The Blast. Blackstock has been living on the former couple’s ranch in Montana. As part of the agreement, the children will fly private until they are fully vaccinated, and Clarkson agreed to make a $50,000 “reimbursement” payment to her ex for the children’s private air travel. The singer got the ranch and another Montana property in the settlement, but they agreed that Blackstock can stay at the ranch until June as he searches for his own home, and he will pay Clarkson $2,000 a month in rent. However, Clarkson will also have to pay her ex-husband $115,000 a month in spousal support until January 31, 2024. This sum is slightly lower than the reported $150,000 in spousal support that Clarkson was ordered to pay in July of last year.\n\nThe pair have also divvied up a number of their other shared assets, per The Blast. Clarkson will keep the family pets, a flight simulator, as well as a number of their cars, namely a pick-up truck, Ford Bronco, Ford F-250, and a Porsche Cayenne, and “all guns acquired prior and during the marriage.” Blackstock, on the other hand, will take possession of their farm cattle, livestock, stock dogs, and horses, another Ford F-250, a Ford F-350, an ATV, and several CAT snowmobiles. He is also keeping a golf simulator and a couple of very pricey Patek Philippe watches.\n\nClarkson filed for divorce in June 2020 after nearly seven years of marriage. In July of 2021, she requested to be declared legally single as they continued to hash out the details of the division of their assets, arguing that they “both deserve the opportunity to build a new life,” according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly at the time. The singer was reportedly granted that request in September. According to The Blast’s sources, both sides are happy with the divorce settlement and just ready to move on with their lives.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair"
