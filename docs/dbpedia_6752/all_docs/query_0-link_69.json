The salary cost used to determine the amount of funding required for the state effort is based on that of a teacher having a master's degree and twelve years of experience, which equates to $52,604 $55,104 on the statewide minimum salary schedule for the current fiscal year and including fringe benefits is $69,153 $72,991. The calculation of teachers for every student ratio includes those teachers eligible pursuant to Section 59-20-50(4)(b), to include classroom teachers, librarians, guidance counselors, psychologists, social workers, occupational and physical therapists, school nurses, orientation/mobility instructors, and audiologists in the school districts of the State. School districts are required to meet the statewide minimum salary schedule in the current fiscal year and are required to provide the annual step increase pursuant to Section 59-20-50. No school district is required to increase teacher salaries above the amount necessary to meet the statewide minimum salary schedule as prescribed in this act. For the current fiscal year, the provisions of Section 59-20-50(3) of the 1976 Code, as amended, are suspended.\n\nTo allocate the funds, the department will calculate the total number of weighted pupil units (WPUs) in each school district and in the State. The funds appropriated herein for State Aid to Classrooms represent the state share of the total Aid to Classrooms program, which is seventy-five percent. The local required effort is twenty-five percent of the total program. The total Aid to Classrooms funding for each district is calculated based on the district's percentage of the total statewide weighted pupils multiplied by the total Aid to Classrooms program. The district's local share is calculated by multiplying the total local share by the district's imputed index of taxpaying ability, which is the district's relative fiscal capacity compared to that of all other districts in the State. The State Aid to Classrooms amount allocated to each district will be determined by subtracting the calculation of the district's local share from the calculation of the district's total Aid to Classrooms projected funding. The Statewide Public Charter School District and any approved institution of higher education authorizing charter schools shall receive one hundred percent of the Aid to Classrooms funding from the State. For Fiscal Year 2022-23 2023-24, no local match is required for the State Aid to Classroom EIA distributions for the base funding rolled up from the previous fiscal year.\n\nEach district will receive either the amount determined by this new methodology or the actual state funding received in Fiscal Year 2021-22 from State Aid to Classrooms, Aid School Districts, Student Health and Fitness, Guidance/Career Specialists, Handicapped - Profoundly Mentally, EIA - Aid to Districts, EIA - Students at Risk of School Failure, Allocations EIA - Teacher Salaries, Allocations EIA - Employer Contributions, EIA - Student Health and Fitness Act - Nurses, and EIA - South Carolina Public Charter Schools.\n\nTo provide flexibility, each district may expend the funds as determined by the local school board of trustees to meet the educational needs of students as defined in Section 59-1-50, Chapter 18, Title 59, and as delineated in a child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). Pursuant to Section 59-20-80, each school board of trustees must make available by September first of each fiscal year its annual budget that includes state, local, and federal investments in education. The budget must be available on the district's website. The department, in collaboration with local school districts, will provide a template that each district must use in reporting its budget.\n\nTo provide transparency, Revenue and Fiscal Affairs will document annually, through an online financial dashboard, the expenditure of all state, local, and federal funds by each district and other relevant data. To ensure that the public reporting meets the needs of educators, parents, citizens, and policymakers, the department, in conjunction with Revenue and Fiscal Affairs, will convene consult routinely with a group of educators, parents, citizens, and policymakers to provide recommendations regarding the items and the design of the dashboard by January 1. District expenditures for the prior fiscal year must be published on the department's website for public disclosure by January 1.\n\nIf a traditional school district, charter school authorizer, or special school district fails to submit expenditure data needed for the online financial dashboard, the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office will notify the Department of Education. Within thirty days of such notification, the Department of Education must then withhold ten percent of all state payments to the district or authorizer until the district or authorizer complies and all payments will then be made.\n\nTo ensure accountability, each district's annual audit that is submitted to the Department of Education pursuant to Section 59-17-100 must be conducted using an auditing firm from an approved list provided by the State Auditor. The State Auditor will develop standards and criteria for determining qualifying auditors. Each district's annual audit must be available on the district's website.\n\nFor the current fiscal year the South Carolina Public Charter School District and any institution of higher education sponsoring a public charter school shall receive and distribute state Aid to Classroom funds to the charter school. Students enrolled in charter schools authorized by the South Carolina Public Charter School District or an institution of higher education will receive in addition to the base weight of 1.00 or in addition to the disability weight of 2.60 an additional weight based upon the type of charter school that they attend. These additional funds must support the provision of educational services for children served by a charter school that does not receive local revenues. These students are also eligible to receive additional weights for personalized instruction. The department will make any necessary adjustments to account for the state share for Charter and Special Districts.\n\nThree and four year old students with a disability, who are eligible for services under IDEA and enrolled in brick and mortar charter schools sponsored by the South Carolina Public Charter School District or registered IHE, shall be included in student counts solely for the purposes of receiving the additional weighting for students attending a brick and mortar charter school.\n\nFor Fiscal Year 2022-23, special districts, career centers, and alternative schools will receive the amount received in the prior fiscal year from these funds.\n\nThe Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, must post in a prominent place on their website for each school district projections, including the per pupil state, federal and local revenues, excluding revenues of local bond issues, for the current fiscal year. Also, as soon as practicable, upon determining the exact numbers regarding pupil count and funding, the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, shall also post on their website the one hundred thirty-five-day average daily membership for each school district and per pupil state, federal and local revenues, excluding revenues of local bond issues, based on the most recent audited financial statement as reported annually pursuant to Section 59-17-100. The Department of Education and the Education Oversight Committee shall provide in a prominent place on their internet websites a link to the information posted by the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, including the projected numbers and the exact numbers.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the pupil classification weightings are as follows:\n\n(1) K-12 pupils or base students including homebound students 1.00\n\nStudents served in licensed residential treatment facilities (RTFs) for children and adolescents as defined under Section 44-7-130 of the 1976 Code shall receive a weighting of 2.10.\n\n(2) Weights for students with disabilities as documented by their Individualized Education Plan (IEP) 2.60\n\n(3) Precareer and Career Technology 1.20\n\n(4) Charter school students\n\n(a) Enrolled in brick and mortar school 1.25\n\n(b) Enrolled in virtual charter school 0.65\n\n(5) Additional weights for personalized instruction:\n\n(a) Gifted and Talented 0.15\n\n(b) Academic Assistance 0.15\n\n(c) Limited English Proficiency 0.20\n\n(d) Pupils in Poverty 0.50\n\nStudents in poverty are students who qualify for Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, or are homeless, transient, or in foster care.\n\nGifted and talented students are students who are classified as academically or artistically gifted and talented or who are enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), and Cambridge International courses in high school. Districts shall set-aside twelve percent of the funds for serving artistically gifted and talented students in grades three through twelve.\n\nStudents in need of academic assistance are students who do not meet state standards in mathematics, English language arts, or both on state approved assessments in grades three through eight and high school assessments for grades nine through twelve. The additional weight generates funds needed to provide additional instructional services to these students.\n\nStudents with limited English proficiency are students who require intensive English language instruction programs and whose families require specialized parental involvement intervention.\n\nFurther, the Department of Education may use school district student counts for personalized instruction as collected in the same manner as the prior fiscal year, PowerSchool or other available existing data sources as determined by the department to calculate the school district add on weightings for the personalized instruction classifications and the determination of the school districts monetary entitlement. End of year adjustments shall be based on the one hundred thirty-five-day student average daily membership for all classifications. During the current fiscal year, the department will update PowerSchool calculations, reports, screen development, documentation, and training to incorporate the new pupil classification weightings and to make final district allocation adjustments by June 30. The department must provide districts with technical assistance with regard to student count changes in PowerSchool.\n\nUp to ten percent of any funds appropriated for State Aid to Classrooms at the end of the fiscal year may be carried forward into the subsequent fiscal year and allocated to school districts, the South Carolina Public Charter School District, and an institution of higher education that authorizes charter schools pursuant to this provision. The additional funds must first support increases in student enrollment and any balance may be allocated proportionately utilizing weighted pupil units to districts. Any additional unexpended funds shall revert to the general fund or to the EIA Fund.\n\nWith the funds that the Department of Education receives for health insurance for school districts, the department shall allocate the funds to school districts proportionately utilizing weighted pupil units. The department shall allocate to districts funds received for retirement benefits through the State Aid to Classrooms formula.\n\n1.4. (SDE: Employer Contributions/Allocations) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the appropriation contained herein for \"Public School Employee Benefits\" shall not be utilized to provide employer contributions for any portion of a school district employee's salary that is federally funded.\n\nState funds allocated for school district employer contributions must be allocated by the formula and must be used first by each district to cover the cost of fringe benefits for personnel required by the Defined Program, food service personnel and other personnel required by law. Once a district has expended all state allocated funds for fringe benefits, the district may utilize food service revenues to fund a proportionate share of fringe benefits costs for food service personnel.\n\nThe Department of Juvenile Justice and the Department of Corrections' school districts must be allocated funds under the fringe benefits program in accordance with criteria established for all school districts.\n\n1.5. (SDE: Employer Contributions/Obligations) In order to finalize each school district's allocations of Employer Contributions funds for retiree insurance from the prior fiscal year, the Department of Education is authorized to adjust a school district's allocation in the current fiscal year accordingly to reflect actual payroll and payments to the Retirement System from the prior fiscal year. In the event the Department of Education is notified that an educational subdivision has failed to remit proper payments to cover Employee Fringe Benefit obligations, the Department of Education is directed to withhold the educational subdivision's state funds until such obligations are met.\n\n1.6. (SDE: Educational Responsibility/Foster Care) The responsibility for providing a free and appropriate public education program for all children including disabled students is vested in the public school district wherein a child of lawful school age resides in a foster home, group home, orphanage, or a state operated health care facility including a facility for treatment of mental illness or chemical dependence and habilitation centers for persons with intellectual disabilities or persons with related conditions located within the jurisdiction of the school district or alternative residences. The districts concerned may agree upon acceptable local cost reimbursement. If no agreement is reached, districts providing education shall receive from the district where the child last resided before placement in a facility an additional amount equivalent to the statewide average of the local base student cost multiplied by the appropriate pupil weighting as set forth in Section 59-20-40 of the Education Finance Act. If a child from out of state is residing in a facility owned and/or operated by a for profit entity, the district providing educational services shall be reimbursed by the for profit entity the local district's local support per weighted pupil above the statewide average base student cost multiplied by the appropriate pupil weighting as set forth in Section 59-20-40 of the Education Finance Act. Participation will be evidenced by a written agreement from the IEP team or 504 team, written referral, or the school district initiating the placement process. School districts providing the education shall notify the nonresident district in writing within forty-five calendar days that a student from the nonresident district is receiving education services pursuant to the provisions of the proviso. The notice shall also contain the student's name, date of birth, and disabling condition if available. If appropriate financial arrangements cannot be effected between institutions of the state, including independent school districts under the authority of the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs, and school districts, institutions receiving educational appropriations shall pay the local base student cost multiplied by the appropriate pupil weighting. Children residing in institutions of state agencies shall be educated with nondisabled children in the public school districts if appropriate to their educational needs. Such institutions shall determine, on an individual basis, which children residing in the institution might be eligible to receive appropriate educational services in a public school setting. Once these children are identified, the institution shall convene an IEP meeting with officials of the public school district in which the institution is located. If it is determined by the committee that the least restrictive environment in which to implement the child's IEP is a public school setting, then the school district in which the institution is located must provide the educational services. However, that school district may enter into contractual agreements with any other school district having schools located within a forty-five mile radius of the institution. The cost for educating such children shall be allocated in the following manner: the school district where the child last resided before being placed in an institution shall pay to the school district providing the educational services an amount equivalent to the statewide average of the local base student cost multiplied by the appropriate pupil weighting as set forth in Section 59-20-40 of the Education Finance Act; the school district providing the educational services shall be able to count the child for all funding sources, both state and federal. The institution and school district, through contractual agreements, will address the special education and related services to be provided to students.

Funding to providers is contingent upon receipt of data as requested by the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps. The Department of Education shall only provide funding for public school students whose complete records have been entered into PowerSchool based on the one hundred and thirty-five day student average daily membership. For the current fiscal year, providers may enroll pay-lunch children who score at or below the twenty-fifth national percentile on two of the three DIAL-3 subscales by July 1 if at least seventy-five percent of the total number of children eligible or the Child Early Reading Development and Education Program in a district or county are projected to be enrolled in that program, Head Start, or ABC Child Care Program as determined by the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps, Child Early Reading Development and Education Program. Providers may receive reimbursement for these children if funds are available. The Department of Education is required to offer waivers allowing students with disabilities to be served in multi-categorical classroom settings based on similar cognition and abilities. Funding appropriated for CERDEP may be carried forward and expended for the same purpose.\n\nAnnually, the Department of Education is directed to audit the annual allocations to public providers to ensure that allocations are accurate and aligned to the appropriate pro rata per student allocation, materials, and equipment funding. In the event the department, during the audit process determines that the annual allocations of the prior fiscal year are not accurate, the department must adjust the allocations for the current fiscal year to account for the audit findings. The department must provide the results of the annual audit findings to the General Assembly no later than December first. Likewise, in the event the Office of First Steps determines that the annual allocations of the prior fiscal year to private providers are not accurate, the Office of First Steps must adjust the allocations for the current fiscal year to account for the findings.\n\nOf the funds appropriated, $300,000 shall be allocated to the Education Oversight Committee to conduct an annual evaluation of the South Carolina Child Development Education Pilot Program and to issue findings in a report to the General Assembly by March first of each year. To aid in this evaluation, the Education Oversight Committee shall determine the data necessary and both public and private providers are required to submit the necessary data as a condition of continued participation in and funding of the program. This data shall include developmentally appropriate measures of student progress.

For eligible children residing in school districts that do not participate in CERDEP, the Department of Education is required to develop and implement inter-district transfer policies that give parents or guardians the option of their eligible child attending an out-of-district school that participates in CERDEP.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the Office of First Steps may expend: (1) up to $2,000,000 to pilot a program to provide higher reimbursement rates to high-quality child care centers providers. The reimbursement rate for students enrolled by child care providers rated B or higher in the ABC Quality System operated by the Department of Social Services may be increased by up to 10% of the per-student base following guidelines developed by the Office of First Steps; and (2) up to $100,000 $250,000 to provide one-time supplemental, needs-based incentive grants in an amount not to exceed $30,000 for newly created and/or newly approved private providers proposing to expand service to ten or more CERDEP eligible children in communities unable to enroll all eligible students in a public, private, or Head Start setting during the prior fiscal year. These grants are designed to address building renovations, documented as necessary to bring proposed classrooms into compliance with licensing regulations, materials and staffing costs, and/or other obstacles currently preventing their participation in the program. The First Steps Board of Trustees shall develop and approve an application process that incorporates formal review and fiscal safeguards designed to ensure grant funds are used solely to address documented barriers to program participation. Providers receiving this one-time supplement shall be expected to participate in the program and provide high-quality, center-based programs as defined herein for a minimum of three years. Failure to participate for three years shall require the provider to return a portion of the supplemental allocation at a level determined by the Office of First Steps to School Readiness. First Steps shall submit a report detailing its process, expenditures and expanded enrollment to the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee by March 15; and (3) up to $1,000,000 may be used to provide grants to public-private partnerships to address building renovations and designs necessary to get the building and classrooms into compliance with licensing regulations and other obstacles that prevent participation in CERDEP following guidelines developed by the Office of First Steps. Providers participating in this pilot shall be expected to participate in the program and provide high-quality, center-based programs as defined herein for a minimum of three years. Failure to participate for three years shall require the provider to return a portion of the supplemental allocation at a level determined by the Office of First Steps.\n\nIf by August first, the Department of Education or the Office of First Steps determines that appropriations will exceed expenditures, available funds may be used to fund an extended program and to increase the length of the program to a maximum of eight and a half hours per day or two hundred and twenty days per year or to fund summer programs. If a district chooses to fund summer enrollment, the program funding shall conform to the funding in this act for full year programs; however, it shall be reduced on a pro rata basis to conform with the length of the program. A summer program shall be no more than eight and a half hours per day and shall be not more than ten weeks in length. The per pupil allocation and classroom grant must conform with the appropriated amount contained in this act and end of year adjustments shall be based on the one hundred and thirty-five-day student average daily membership or later student average daily membership for districts choosing to extend the program past one hundred and eighty days. Funds may also be used to provide parent engagement, professional development, and quality evaluations of programs. No later than April first, the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps shall report to the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on the expenditure of these funds to include the following information: the amount of money used and specific steps and measures taken to enhance the quality of the 4K program and the amount of money used for professional development as well as the types of professional development offered and the number of participants. The Office of First Steps is directed to determine if the provision of extended programs in private centers improves the ability of parents to enter the workforce or to pursue postsecondary training or industry credentials.\n\nOn or before November 15, the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps shall share data that identifies the total number of children enrolled in CERDEP in both public and private providers. If available appropriations exceed the instructional costs of serving children enrolled in the program and if a waiting list of eligible children can be documented by the Department of Education and by the Office of First Steps, then the Executive Budget Office may authorize the transfer of funds between the Department of Education and the Office of First Steps.\n\nThe Office of First Steps and the Department of Education shall collaborate with the South Carolina Head Start State Collaboration Office to inform parents of all publicly funded full-day 4K programs including Head Start by participating in PalmettoPreK and First5SC.\n\nFor Fiscal Year 2022-23, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, children who were eligible to participate in the Child Early Reading Development and Education Program in the prior fiscal year but did not participate, shall be eligible to participate in the program during Fiscal Year 2022-23, subject to classroom availability and funding.
