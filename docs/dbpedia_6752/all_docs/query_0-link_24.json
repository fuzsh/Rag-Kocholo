        "text": "It all started last summer.\n\nI was out in Los Angeles and I was at\n\nsome event and I was chatting with someone\n\nwho worked for a major movie studio.\n\nI can't tell you the name of the movie studio,\n\nwhich is another fact that you'll have to keep in mind,\n\nwhich is that\n\nall of the really crucial details in this story\n\nI either don't know or I can't tell you.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nOr, in fact, cannot be known at all.\n\nAnyway, so these people from this unnamed studio\n\nwere talking on and on very excitedly\n\nabout a man named Dick who,\n\nwas famous for his 17 page emails.\n\nAnd so naturally I said, well who's Dick?\n\nAnd the head of this unnamed studio looks at me\n\nand he has this big smile on his face, and he says,\n\nDick?\n\nOh my god, you have to meet Dick.\n\nSo I met Dick.\n\nI call him up, and we have lunch\n\nat that fabulous restaurant on the Upper East Side called\n\nDaniel, Danielle, I don't know how you pronounce it.\n\n'Cause that's the sort of place where you go\n\nwhen you're on expense account and The New Yorker is paying.\n\nAnd Dick's name is Dick Copaken,\n\nand he turns out to be this,\n\nfor many many years, he was a partner at\n\nthis big, white shoe law firm in Washington, DC,\n\nCovington & Burling.\n\nThat fact will become briefly important later.\n\nAnd he's a short guy, and he's got thinning white hair,\n\nand he's got this large, kind of pink Charlie Brown head,\n\nand he's immaculately dressed.\n\nAlways in the starched white button down\n\nand the blue blazer.\n\nAnd he likes to talk, which is another fact\n\nthat will become important later.\n\nWhen I called up his best friend,\n\nhis best friend said, the first thing out of his mouth was,\n\nyou have to understand that Dick is relentless.\n\nAnd he really is relentless.\n\nAnd that was meant, by the way, as a compliment.\n\nHe's a man of obsessions, and he's obsessed about\n\nhis grandchildren, as far as I can tell, first and foremost,\n\nand he's obsessed about international law.\n\nAnd most of all, he's obsessed with the movies.\n\nYou have not met in your life someone\n\nwho cares more about movies.\n\nSo here we are at Daniel, and remember,\n\nwe're in a little booth on the side,\n\nand I don't know anything about this guy.\n\nSo I'm chatting with him.\n\nHe is the sort, he orders the salad and he picks at it,\n\nand then he feels so virtuous that he orders\n\nthe 5,000 calorie chocolate souffle for dessert.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nJust giving you a little flavor of what he thinks,\n\nand we're there for three and a half hours,\n\nand I say nothing, just the tape recorder's running.\n\nAll I do is check to make sure that\n\nI have enough battery life.\n\nAnd he's talking and talking,\n\nand the movie he keeps coming back to is a movie\n\ncalled Dear Frankie.\n\nNow I don't know how many of you have seen Dear Frankie.\n\nI imagine not many of you.\n\nIt was a movie that came out a couple years ago.\n\nIt's a Miramax movie and it takes place is Scotland.\n\nIt's about a woman, and she's fled an abusive relationship\n\nwith her young son.\n\nThey move around and they end up settling\n\nin a little port town in Scotland.\n\nAnd the boy grows up and he's deaf,\n\nand he really, truly misses his father.\n\nHis mother tells him this story,\n\nwhich is that your father is a sailor on a ship,\n\nand the ship rarely comes to port,\n\nbut you can write him letters and he'll respond.\n\nSo the little boy writes his father letters\n\nand the mother intercepts the letters\n\nand responds, posing as the father.\n\nAnd this rouse goes on for many years,\n\nand then the little boy realizes that his mother\n\nhas told him the name of his father's ship, the real ship,\n\nand that ship is in fact coming to shore at their town,\n\nand the mother panics, right?\n\nThe father she's made up is actually coming in.\n\nSo she has to do something and she finds some man\n\nto stand in for the father and of course\n\nshe falls in love with that man.\n\nThen the real father resurfaces in the midst of all of this,\n\nand she realizes, oh my goodness, I have a dilemma.\n\nAnd then the little boy reveals his secret,\n\nand that is that he'd known all along\n\nthat his mother was standing in place of his father.\n\nNow, Copaken tells me this story.\n\nHe says the first time he saw that movie\n\nhe was on flight, across the Atlantic flight\n\non Virgin Atlantic, and he's just in tears by the end of it.\n\nCompletely and utterly moved by this\n\nand he's so moved by it that when he gets home,\n\nhe thinks, well maybe you know how sometimes\n\nwhen you see a movie on the plane you cry\n\nbecause there's no oxygen and you just think it's\n\n(audience laughing)\n\na physiological effect so he rents the movie\n\nand comes home and he sees it again,\n\nyou know, at sea level, to see.\n\n(audience laughing) And he starts crying again,\n\neven though he knows exactly how it's gonna turn out.\n\nAnd then he's relating this story to me\n\nand I look at him and I realize he's crying a third time.\n\nHe's all choked up, and I'm getting a little bit choked up.\n\nIt's quite possible that Daniel,\n\nI don't know how many of you have ever been there.\n\nIt's quite possible that it's the most\n\nemotionally repressed restaurant\n\n(audience laughing) in all of New York.\n\nAnd yet, here is this high powered corporate lawyer\n\nsitting across from me weeping into his 5,000\n\ncalorie chocolate souffle.\n\nSo I say, well why are you crying?\n\nI mean that's the question: why are you crying?\n\nAnd he tries to explain and he says,\n\nwell, you know, that's a story about a little boy.\n\nAnd he has a grandson about the same age,\n\nso maybe there's something there, and then he says,\n\nit's also a story about absent parents.\n\nAnd for him, he says the whole idea of an absent parent\n\nis an enormous, significant, fact.\n\nAnd he launches into this long, complicated story\n\nabout how once, years ago,\n\nhe was representing the Marshall Islands\n\nwho were trying to restructure their\n\nrelationship with the United States,\n\nand he's the lawyer for the Marshall Islands,\n\nand it's an enormously critical negotiation\n\nbecause there's a very important missile range\n\non the Marshall Islands.\n\nAnd so, in the course of this negotiation,\n\nthere are like five countries and 50 federal agencies\n\ninvolved in the negotiation.\n\nAnd he realizes, when they schedule the final,\n\nwe're gonna sit down and work this out,\n\nthat his daughter's sixth grade production\n\nof Dorothy and the Wiz, falls right in the middle\n\nof the negotiation, and the negotiation\n\nis in Hawaii, his daughter's in Washington, D.C.\n\nSo he calls up the president of the Marshall Islands\n\nand says, I can't go, I have to go to my daughter's\n\nperformance of Dorothy and the Wiz.\n\nHalf an hour passes and he gets a frantic call\n\nfrom the state department and they say,\n\ndo you mean to tell me you're gonna\n\nimperil the national security of the United States\n\nbecause of Dorothy and the Wiz?\n\nAnd he says, I'm sorry, yeah, that's just who I am.\n\nAnyway, the point is that,\n\nthey actually end up postponing the negotiation, by the way.\n\n(audience laughing) He flies back.\n\nSo clearly this is a story, then, he says,\n\nthat touches some hot buttons for him.\n\nLittle boys and absent parents.\n\nBut then he kind of stops,\n\nand I can see that he doesn't find\n\nthat explanation satisfactory,\n\nbecause after all,\n\n50% of all movies that come out of Hollywood\n\nare about little boys and absent parents,\n\nand he doesn't burst into tears in the middle\n\nof emotionally repressed restaurants whenever\n\nhe thinks about them.\n\nIn fact, he's not even a crier.\n\nHe told me that he likes violent movies.\n\nHe's not some soppy sentimentalist.\n\nSo there must be something else that sets him off,\n\nthat causes him to cry.\n\nAnd I think this is an important,\n\na really, really critical question.\n\nSo think about, for example,\n\none of the most emotionally powerful stories\n\nof the last 25 years, the death of Princess Diana.\n\nNow, why is that story so incredibly powerful?\n\nWell you can say that, well, it's the tragic death\n\nof a beautiful princess, right?\n\nBut in the end, if you think about that,\n\nthat's about as unsatisfying as saying\n\nthat Dick Copaken cried because\n\nit was a story about an absent father and a little boy.\n\nThere's clearly a lot more going on there,\n\nthat sets this story apart\n\nfrom other kind of similar stories.\n\nSo, you know, surely it matters, for instance, that\n\nPrincess Di was killed in the presence of her lover,\n\nwho was a man who was greatly disliked by her family.\n\nIt's Romeo and Juliet, right?\n\nIt's tapping into not just the fairy tale\n\nabout the tragic death of beautiful princesses,\n\nbut another fairy tale, an even more powerful one,\n\nabout star-crossed lovers, right?\n\nWell then we can go further with this.\n\nWe can say, surely it matters as well\n\nthat she died in a tunnel.\n\nWhat is the tunnel?\n\nIt's the underworld.\n\nAnd how did she get in the tunnel?\n\nPursued by men on motorbikes.\n\nBy the hounds of hell.\n\nThey chased her into the underworld.\n\nAnd where was this underworld situated?\n\nWell it was below the city of Paris,\n\nthe romantic center of the world.\n\nThe absolute reigning symbol in our minds\n\nof everything that is romantic.\n\nAnd we can go on and on with with the this story.\n\nEvery single detail actually has some kind\n\nof great emotional significance.\n\nShe's blonde, her lover's dark.\n\nWhat's she in?\n\nShe's in a black limousine.\n\nI submit to you that if Princess Diana\n\nhad been driving a white rental car from Sacramento\n\nand it skidded on some ice,\n\nand, 'cause she ran into a telephone pole.\n\nThat story would not have had the same emotional impact.\n\nIt's something about Di, but it's also something\n\nabout this extraordinarily confluence\n\nof emotionally charged details.\n\nSo that's what a great story is,\n\nwhat a really powerful story is.\n\nIt's some kind of general narrative,\n\nmarried with some complex arrangement\n\nof things that have real meaningful associations for us.\n\nNow we don't know what that combination\n\nof meaningful association, what the optimal\n\ncombination of meaningful associations are.\n\nAnd that's why it's so rare that a movie\n\nwill move us to tears.\n\nAnd that's why we pay so much to people\n\nwho can write successful movies.\n\nBecause it's a very, very, scarce skill.\n\nWell, what if you could figure it out?\n\nWhat if you found some way to actually\n\ncome up with a formula that would describe\n\nthe way to get people to cry or to laugh\n\nor to experience some profound emotion\n\nin a movie theater?\n\nNow wouldn't that be an enormously powerful\n\nand useful, not to mention lucrative thing?\n\nWell that's what Dick Copaken had set out to do.\n\nThat's what his life has been about\n\nover the last three or four years.\n\nNow, I realize this sounds crazy.\n\nI'm sure many of you are familiar\n\nwith the famous dictum of William Goldman\n\nwhen he wrote his book about\n\nAdventures in the Screen Trade.\n\nHe said, in Hollywood no one knows anything.\n\nNobody knows anything.\n\nThere's a whole, in fact, school of economic analysis\n\nabout Hollywood which is based on that principle.\n\nHollywood is what economists like to call\n\na chaotic marketplace.\n\nIt is marketplace this is not predictable.\n\nYou have no clue whether something's gonna be big\n\nor something's going to be small.\n\nGoldman points out, Raiders of the Lost Ark was a movie that\n\nevery single studio in Hollywood passed on except for\n\nParamount, and do you know why Paramount\n\naccepted that movie?\n\nNo one knows. (audience laughing)\n\nThey just thought it sounded cool,\n\nand it ended up making them billions of dollars.\n\nGoldman quotes this former head of United Artists\n\nwho said, if he has said 'yes'\n\nto every project he said no to,\n\nand no to every project he said yes to,\n\nhis career would have turned out exactly the same.\n\nWhat these guys are saying is something\n\nthat philosophers have been saying for\n\nyears and years and years about art.\n\nThat is that art is necessarily a subjective experience\n\nand there's no way to kind of derive from your own\n\nsubjective experience some larger rules\n\nabout what constitutes beauty\n\nor what constitutes the sublime.\n\nNow,\n\nsimultaneously, while there has been a group of\n\npeople who say that art is necessarily subjective,\n\nthat beauty lies in the eye of the beholder,\n\nthere is another group of people who say actually no.\n\nThat in reaction to those who say, nobody knows anything,\n\nthere's always a kind of rearguard that says,\n\nactually, if you look hard enough,\n\nyou figure out that, it is possible to know something.\n\nSo for example, let me give you an example:\n\nthe music business.\n\nTalk to the head of a record company.\n\nAsk that person, do you know whether something's\n\ngonna be a hit?\n\nThey'll always say the same thing.\n\nThey'll say, well, I have a gut feeling about it,\n\nbut if I'm perfectly honest,\n\nI'll tell you that I'm usually wrong.\n\nIn fact, we're all usually wrong,\n\nand it's almost impossible to predict\n\nwhat the public is gonna like in a piece of music\n\nat any given time.\n\nThey believe, in their heart of hearts,\n\nat the end of the day, that what they do is,\n\nthey're trying to navigate the unknowable\n\nin their business.\n\nIn the last couple of years, there's been an\n\nupstart movement that has arisen.\n\nAnd this is a group of people who say,\n\nactually that's wrong,\n\nyou actually can predict hits.\n\nI went to see this guy, who, I call him\n\nMike McCready, who runs a little company\n\nat Union Square called Platinum Blue,\n\nand Platinum Blue is based on a software program.\n\nAnd what this software program does\n\nis it measures the mathematical relationships\n\namong all the structural components of a song.\n\nSo, melody, harmony, beat, tempo, rhythm, octave, pitch,\n\nchord progression, cadence, sonic brilliance, on and on.\n\nAnything that can be measured mathematically in a song,\n\nthey measure.\n\nAnd on the basis of analyzing those relationships,\n\nthey come up with a kind of mathematical\n\nsignature of a song, and they say that if you know\n\nthe mathematical signature of a song,\n\nyou can predict its likelihood of becoming a hit\n\nthat is, of reaching the Billboard Top 30.\n\nYou can do that with a success rate of about 80%.\n\nSo I go to see McCready and he's got this big loft office,\n\nand he just sits me down in front of his laptop.\n\nOn the screen is what looks like a cloud,\n\nand what that is is he has measured\n\nthe kind of mathematical signature of thousands\n\nand thousands of songs.\n\nEach song is a point in this cloud,\n\nand every song is a different mathematical signature.\n\nSo you just see this huge mass,\n\n'cause every song is different in some way.\n\nThen he, what he does, is he hits a button,\n\nand what the button does is it removes all the songs\n\nthat did not make the Billboard Top 30.\n\nNow what happens when he does that,\n\nis that you go from this one big, large differentiation,\n\ninto 60 distinct postures.\n\nAnd what he says is, this is what hit songs look like.\n\nThe universe of hit songs looks like 60 distinct,\n\nhighly predictable, hit clusters.\n\nAnd when you have a new song,\n\nwhat you do is you run it through your little\n\nsoftware progression, and you see whether\n\nit fits into one of these clusters.\n\nThen in fact, what you thought of as being this\n\nsort of confusing and unknowable thing,\n\nis actually something that follows some fairly\n\nconsistent, mathematical principles.\n\nHe was most famous when he was just starting out.\n\nMcCready got famous because he was just playing\n\nwith his software for the first time\n\nand he went to the store and he got 30 albums at random\n\nthat had just been released, like that day.\n\nAnd he runs them all through the computer,\n\nand the computer loves one album.\n\nAnd it so happened that a reporter called\n\nhim up that say and they said,\n\nwhat are you doing?\n\nAnd he told them and they said,\n\nwell what does your computer like?\n\nAnd McCready said, well it's this album.\n\nI've never heard of this artist, no one has.\n\nIt's her first album but,\n\nthe computer just thinks it's gonna be the biggest hit\n\nmaybe ever.\n\nWhat's the album?\n\nThe artist is Norah Jones, the album is Come Away With Me.\n\nIt sold 22 million copies.\n\nWhat is McCready doing?\n\nMcCready is doing precisely what Dick Copaken\n\nwants to do for Hollywood.\n\nThe simplest way to explain what Dick Copaken\n\nset out to do, is that he looked at people like McCready\n\nand said, I can take that approach,\n\nand I can apply that to movies.\n\nTurns out Dick Copaken has a friend named Nick Meaney,\n\nand Meaney loves the movies, too.\n\nAnd they're driving up through England one summer\n\na couple years ago, and Meaney tells Copaken\n\nthat he has a friend from college\n\nand this friend is in business with this other guy,\n\nand they are students of narrative,\n\nand what they do is they read scripts,\n\nthousands of them and they analyze them\n\nand they write papers for really obscure journals\n\non the evolution of the police drama\n\nin South American cable television.\n\nAnd they've developed this whole system for analyzing\n\nscreen plays and they've kinda broken down\n\nscreenplays into their kind of\n\nbasic elements and they create a kind of report card.\n\nSo, you know, they might say that the conflict\n\nbetween the lead and some other character in act one\n\nrates a seven on the ten point\n\nfirst act conflict scale.\n\nNow I can't go into anymore detail about the system\n\nbecause it's a secret.\n\nNo one will tell me anything more about it.\n\nAnd in fact, Copaken won't even tell me the names\n\nof these two guys, he'll only refer to them\n\nas Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown. (audience laughing)\n\nAnd halfway through the story, actually,\n\nparenthetically, I figured out who Mr. Pink\n\nand Mr. Brown were, but I couldn't tell Copaken\n\nbecause I thought it would really freak him out\n\nand I can't tell you either (audience laughing)\n\nbecause I'm worried it would blow your mind.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nCopaken and Meaney are also, as it turns out,\n\nobsessed with a very particular kind of computer program\n\ncalled a neural network.\n\nNow a neural network is this kind of\n\nartificial intelligence system.\n\nIt's used through all kind of industries.\n\nIt's a kind of computer system that learns\n\nthrough trial and error.\n\nWhen you write a check and you send it to the bank,\n\nthat check is read by a computer,\n\nit's not ready by a person.\n\nAnd that computer has learned how to read handwriting\n\nthrough endless, complex rounds of trial and error.\n\nIt's learned using what's called a neural network.\n\nAnyway, Copaken and Meaney, they're talking\n\nabout Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown,\n\nand all of a sudden, Copaken has this kind of\n\nbrain storm, this brain wave, and he thinks,\n\noh my goodness.\n\nThis system, this report card they've got,\n\nwill allow us to use a neural network\n\nto analyze screenplays.\n\n'Cause otherwise the big problem with using a computer\n\non screenplays is how do you get the computer\n\nto read the screenplay?\n\nComputers can't read.\n\nBut now we have a system for reducing a screenplay\n\nto a set of numbers, a set of scores.\n\nAnd all we have to do is feed the scores into the computer.\n\nSo he set up this company, it's called Epagogix,\n\nand they bring in investors and\n\nthey have Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown grade\n\na whole number of screenplays.\n\nI have no idea how many, but for the sake of argument,\n\nlet's say it's 100 and they give these scores\n\nto a computer scientist whose name they also won't tell me\n\nbut, Meaney once referred to him as being\n\nEnglish to his boot straps, so,\n\nlet's just call him Mr. Boot Straps.\n\nAnd they feed the computer, he has a neural network,\n\nand he feeds in all of the scores\n\nfrom Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown and also the box office\n\ntotal that these scripts ended up making.\n\nAnd what the computer does is, it starts out\n\nand it assigns a value to every one of the\n\ncategories of the screenplays, so,\n\nyou've got a car chase in act one,\n\nand the car chase is a seven out of 10\n\non the car chase scale and it says that's worth\n\n10 million dollars.\n\nAnd you have a beautiful red headed heroine\n\nwho dies a horrible death in act two,\n\nand they say that's worth 15 million dollars.\n\nAnd they go through and they assign a value at random\n\nto everything in the screen play and they go\n\n(make whooshing sound), and they say,\n\nthe movie's gonna make 15 million dollars.\n\nAnd then they compare it to how much the movie actually made\n\nand of course it's wrong in the beginning.\n\nAnd then they go back and they re-weight all the variables\n\nand try again.\n\nAnd they get a little closer, and they try again.\n\nAnd they'll go through thousands,\n\nhundreds of thousands of iterations,\n\nuntil they've precisely weighted every variable\n\nso that it matches the actual box office.\n\nThen they go on to the second movie,\n\nand they do the same thing with the second movie\n\nuntil they come up with a formula which ropes\n\nfor both movies one and two,\n\nand then they go to the third one and the fourth one.\n\nAnd the computer program will go through\n\nmillions and millions and millions of iterations\n\nuntil, what you've got, is a formula,\n\nwhich you can use on a new screenplay.\n\nWhich is a reliable predictor of how\n\nfour of these different narrative elements\n\nadd up when it comes to a movie's box office.\n\nNow, when you think about that,\n\nthe way that neural network is working,\n\nit's working like a human does.\n\nThat's what we do.\n\nA movie studio head, if he's analyzing a screen play,\n\nwhat he does is he thinks about all the screenplays\n\nthat he's known in the past, and he knows that\n\nthis element worked really well here\n\nand this element didn't work,\n\nand he does a kind of informal formula in his head.\n\nHe says, well, I think putting all those pieces together,\n\nthis looks to me like a 30 million dollar movie.\n\nBut the thing that we know about human beings is that\n\nwhen they do those kinds of formulas in their heads,\n\nthey don't do a very good job.\n\nThey can't handle all those different variables,\n\nand they have biases.\n\nAnd the thing that's great about a computer\n\nwhen it thinks that way, is that it doesn't have any biases.\n\nIt can handle 50 variables as effortlessly\n\nas it can handle two variables.\n\nSo there's a real possibility, in other words,\n\nthat if you use a computer in this way,\n\nto break down the elements of a screenplay,\n\nyou might do a better job than a human.\n\nSo, they come up with their formula,\n\nand Copaken decides to conduct an experiment.\n\nHe goes, I think 2004, and he goes and he get\n\n16 of the television pilots that had just been produced.\n\nIt's August 2004.\n\nAnd he runs each pilot through the system\n\nand he tweaks it so they're not predicting box office,\n\nbut they're predicting their ratings.\n\nAnd he comes up with an estimate\n\nfor what the ratings of every one of those shows would be\n\nat the end of December, three months into the season.\n\nHe writes 'em all down to paper,\n\nand goes to a guy at Warner Brothers and he says,\n\ntop guy at Warner Brothers and he says,\n\nI have made these predictions.\n\nI would like you to put this piece of paper in a drawer.\n\nI'm gonna come back in January,\n\nand we're gonna see how accurate they are.\n\nThe guy says okay.\n\nComes back in January, they open the envelope.\n\nTurns out that,\n\nin six cases they are right within half a share point.\n\nThat is to say, they have correctly guessed\n\nthe percentage of American homes\n\nthat were watching that show within .06 percent.\n\nIn 13 of the 16 cases, they were right within\n\ntwo share points, and by the way, in this world,\n\neveryone does these predictions.\n\nNo one's ever that right.\n\nIt's like a mind boggling amount.\n\nAnd the executive, the guy from Warner Brothers,\n\nhe just can't believe it.\n\nHe's just kind of, wow.\n\nThen they go to another Hollywood studio,\n\nand the studio gives them nine movies to analyze.\n\nAnd these are all movies that have been made,\n\nbut not released.\n\nAnd all they give Copaken is the screenplay.\n\nThey don't tell him anything else about them.\n\nHe gives the screenplay to Pink and Brown\n\nand they score it, they give it to Mr. Boot Straps.\n\nMr. Boot Straps comes back and, of the nine cases,\n\nthere's two very, very low budget films\n\nthat don't do a good job on,\n\nwhich doesn't really matter because there's\n\nalmost no money at stake.\n\nThe third one they miss on, which they're troubled by.\n\nBut on six of them, they're so close it's scary.\n\nThey're basically within a couple of million dollars.\n\nRemember, they're not factoring in the director,\n\nwhen it's produced, the promotional budget,\n\nthe stars, nothing, just the screenplay.\n\nI call up the guy who, at this unnamed studio,\n\nwho asked for this particular experiment to be done,\n\nand he was just almost speechless.\n\nHe would just say, it's really, really weird.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nOkay.\n\nSo now it's July, and I have this problem.\n\nI have this great story but they won't tell me anything.\n\nI mean, you really wanna say what the formula is,\n\nso what do I do?\n\nI have long negotiations with Dick Copaken\n\nthat involve hundreds of dollars of expenditure\n\nat fancy restaurants. (audience laughs)\n\nSo we decide that I'm gonna take a movie that's already\n\ncome out and you're gonna run it through your system.\n\nSo he says, alright.\n\nSo I choose the movie The Interpreter.\n\nI don't know if any of you ever saw this movie.\n\nIt's a Sydney Pollack film that comes out last year.\n\nIt stars Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn.\n\nThe reason I chose it, it's a problem film.\n\nIt goes through a zillion re-writes.\n\nThe budget just for screenwriting on this film,\n\nsix million dollars.\n\nWrap your mind around that one.\n\nThat's just for the writers.\n\nI can't tell you how much that fact\n\nfills my heart with joy. (audience laughing)\n\nIt cost 90 million to make and it only grosses 72 million,\n\nso no one's particularity happy with the outcome.\n\nSo that's a good one, in other words,\n\nfor these guys to analyze.\n\nAnd I want them to tell me, alright, what was wrong with it,\n\nand how would you fix is?\n\nOkay, the movie has several drafts.\n\nThe first draft goes something like this:\n\nwe open in Africa, guys drives up to a big soccer stadium.\n\nThey're led into the kind of basement area,\n\nand they see rows and rows and rows of dead bodies.\n\nThey're in this fictional African country called\n\nMatobo and it's ruled by this really evil,\n\nmurderous dictator called Zuwanie.\n\nThen we cut to the United Nations\n\nand we meet this woman called Silvia Broome,\n\nwho is an interpreter of the United Nations.\n\nShe's relating to the security staff a terrifying story.\n\nThe previous night she was at work really late\n\nin the interpreter's booth, and there's a malfunction\n\nin the kind of little buttons down on the floor,\n\nand she overhears two men plotting the assassination\n\nof this dictator, Edmond Zuwanie\n\nbecause he's about to come to New York\n\nto give a speech to the UN and they say\n\nit's gonna happen in this room, the assassination.\n\nAnd then she inadvertently hits the light switch.\n\nThey look up, she's convinced they saw her,\n\nand she's terrified.\n\nShe thinks her life is at stake.\n\nSo she's telling this to a guy named Tobin Keller,\n\nand Tobin Keller is a security,\n\nhe's on the security force of the United Nations.\n\nAnd so, in the beginning he's skeptical.\n\nThe story doesn't seem real to him.\n\nHe thinks that she's kind of making it up,\n\nbut then a series of terrifying things happen\n\nto Silvia Broome and Keller slowly begins\n\nto think something's going on.\n\nAnd, simultaneously, a kind of ambiguous love story\n\ndevelops between Keller and Broome.\n\nAnd Zuwanie's visit approaches and gets closer and closer\n\nand Keller is no closer to cracking the case\n\nand finally, on the day of the speech,\n\nBroome, the interpreter, ends up in the green room\n\nwith Zuwanie.\n\nOh, I've forgotten to tell you the critical fact,\n\nwhich is that Broome is from the same country as Zuwanie.\n\nShe's from Motobo.\n\nShe's white, but she's from this African country,\n\nso she knows the language, so she's assigned\n\nto be his interpretor,\n\nand Keller finally realizes the truth\n\nand that is that she made the whole story up\n\nas a way of bringing Zuwanie to justice.\n\nAnd he runs to the green room\n\nand Broome has poisoned Zuwanie\n\nand she's withholding the antidote\n\nunless he goes out on stage and, before the entire UN,\n\nconfesses to all these crimes of murdering his countrymen.\n\nAnd he does that.\n\nHe goes out and he confesses and he reads\n\nall the names of the people he killed.\n\nShe escapes, a doctor comes in,\n\nlooks at the poison and says, it's harmless.\n\nAnd then he turns to this dictator\n\nwho's just been tricked into basically\n\nwriting his own prison sentence and he says,\n\nyou were never in danger, Mr. Zuwanie.\n\nGreat twist on the end of this.\n\nSo it's really sparse and a political.\n\nIt's all about a terrorist, essentially,\n\na woman, a nonviolent terrorist,\n\nwho comes to this country with the express purpose\n\nof bringing this murderous man to justice\n\nthrough nonconventional means.\n\nNow, it's bought by Sydney Pollack, famous director,\n\nand he likes the premise, but he hates the twist.\n\nHe thinks the audience will feel cheated.\n\nAnd he also doesn't like the fact that the love story\n\nbetween Keller and Broome is ambiguous,\n\nhe actually wants them to really kind of get together.\n\nSo he brings in the original screenwriter again,\n\nand he hires on two other screenwriters.\n\nTwo of the most highly paid screenwriters.\n\nAnd they attack this script, and they revise it.\n\nAnd in the revise, Broome is no longer telling the story\n\nof overhearing the conversation, we see it happen,\n\nit actually happens.\n\nShe's not a terrorist anymore, she's now a full on victim.\n\nShe's not an isolated figure, she's now this kind of\n\nfervid and social.\n\nThey complicate the plot, they add lots of villains.\n\nThey have buses blowing up in Brooklyn.\n\nThey do all this kind of stuff to really make it\n\nin to much more of a kind of big picture, big budget.\n\nAnd they face this problem which is, okay,\n\nif she's not trying to kill Zuwanie, who is?\n\nAnd they concoct this whole scheme about\n\nhow Zuwanie actually stages an assassination on himself\n\nto win sympathy for his cause and they have this ending,\n\nwhich you've seen the movie, the ending doesn't work.\n\nAnd everyone pretty much concedes at this part,\n\nit's very, very super complicated.\n\nSo, I FedEx the scripts, two scripts.\n\nThe shooting script, the revised one,\n\nand the original script, to Copaken.\n\nHe sends them to Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown.\n\nThree weeks pass, I'm like waiting by my phone.\n\nI get a call.\n\nMeet me in London, July 16.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nSo I say, alright.\n\nIt's very clandestine.\n\nSo I fly to London and I'm given\n\nthese complicated directions to some restaurant hidden away\n\nin an alley way in Mayfair,\n\nand I get led through this sort of alley way.\n\nWe're in this private dining room and I walk in,\n\nand the first thing I see is little Dick Copaken\n\nwith his big Charlie Brown head, wearing his blue blazer,\n\nand then I see this big, huge burly guy.\n\nIt's Mr. Brown.\n\nAnd then I see this little, skinny nerdy guy\n\nwith crazy, grey Einstein hair,\n\nand he's Mr. Pink.\n\nNow, remember, that Copaken is a lawyer,\n\nso he has that kind of paranoid lawyer thing going on,\n\nand he's also, he thinks this idea that he has,\n\nhis company he's formed,\n\nis going to make him millions of dollars.\n\nImagine, the people at the movie studio who hired him,\n\nthey realize that had they hired Epagogix to do the analysis\n\nbefore they made those movies, they would\n\nhave saved themselves hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThis is an incredibly valuable tool they've got,\n\nso he wants to protect his investments,\n\nso what he says is, alright, we're gonna discuss\n\nThe Interpreter but I have to be\n\nthere to monitor everything.\n\nSo we sit down to talk, so I'm constantly looking over\n\nand Copaken's got both of his ears turned up to like 10\n\nto catch nuance that might possibly give away.\n\nAnd at one point, we sit down and he opens his briefcase\n\nand he pulls out this huge, 38 page document,\n\nwhich is their analysis of just what went wrong\n\nwith The Interpreter according to the computer.\n\nYou can just imagine how excited I am.\n\nThis is a cadmium.\n\nSo, I'm kind of nervous and I want us to start slow,\n\nso I wanna tease out, get Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown talking.\n\nPink goes first and I say, well you know,\n\nhow did this start?\n\nAnd he points out this really cool thing\n\nthat happened in England which is that,\n\nback in the 60s, they would have\n\nreligious programming on Sundays, which,\n\nalmost no one watched it.\n\nAnd then, starting at around seven o'clock at night,\n\nthe BBC would then show a movie\n\nand then there's one other at that point,\n\nthere's one other commercial channel,\n\nand all around the country, the commercial channels,\n\nthere's a different one in every part of the country,\n\nwould also show a movie up against the BBC.\n\nSo what you've got is this perfect\n\nnatural experiment to measure the popularity of movies.\n\nYou've got the control, the BBC,\n\nyou've got no lead in audience,\n\nand then you've got all these different people\n\nthrowing a different movie up against,\n\nand you can sit down, you can measure,\n\nwhat stories work and what stories don't.\n\nSo they start to put together this kind of ad hoc\n\nsystem and they start to develop their ways\n\nof grading movies.\n\nThe other thing that gets really interesting is,\n\nwhen you decide to watch a movie,\n\nyou haven't seen the movie, right?\n\nSo your measure for deciding whether a movie\n\nis appealing to you or not, is not based on the script,\n\nit's based on some portion of the script.\n\nIn fact, in the case of television,\n\nit's based on the two lines you read about it in TV Guide.\n\nSo they're obsessed with the two lines in TV Guide.\n\nAbout what they tell us about our feelings about stories.\n\nSo they build this whole database\n\nand they find out all kinds of weird things.\n\nThey start to work for people around the world\n\nand they begin to realize that,\n\neveryone, everywhere they go, in a new country will say,\n\nwell we know your system works in England,\n\nbut it won't work in our country.\n\nAnd they discovered, actually, it does.\n\nIn fact, the same thing that makes\n\nfor a great story in England,\n\nmakes for a great story in Tonga,\n\nand also in the Ivory Coast,\n\nand also in, you know, some small island\n\noff the coast of Japan.\n\nThey've discovered a kind of universal system\n\nfor what we like in stories.\n\nAnd at one point Mr. Brown says,\n\nyou know, you remember when the Passion of the Christ\n\ncame out, and everybody says, Mr. Browns says,\n\nand everyone said that the success of that movie\n\njust came out of nowhere, nobody could've predicated that.\n\nAnd he goes, we could have predicted it.\n\nThey're like these kind of savants of the movie world.\n\nSo then I said, well how long?\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAnd they say it takes them about a day to read a script\n\nand then they compare notes and I say,\n\nwell did you ever read a script that you\n\nthought was perfect, that needed no adjustments?\n\nMr. Brown thinks for like five minutes and he says no.\n\nMr. Pink thinks for another five minutes and he goes,\n\nonly one.\n\nLethal Weapon. (audience laughing)\n\nSo then, now they're talking about The Interpreter.\n\nThey're talking about the original script, right,\n\nand they scored it, and they both find it a little bit heavy\n\nand difficult, they think it's kind of a niche movie.\n\nThen they read the shooting script, the revised one,\n\nthey think it's better.\n\nThey say they solved some of the problems,\n\nand they go to Boot Straps.\n\nAnd Boot Straps, the previous weekend, did 15 runs\n\nthrough his neural network.\n\nLike lights flashing, and things spitting out,\n\nand paper going choo choo choo choo.\n\nAnd what Boot Straps says is,\n\nthe original script, the one where they say,\n\nyou were never in danger Mr. Zuwanie.\n\nIt's a 33 million dollar movie.\n\nWhich is, to say, how many of you saw Constant Gardner?\n\nConstant Gardner made 33 million dollars.\n\nWhat they're saying is, it's\n\nin the Constant Gardener territory.\n\nThen they say the shooting script\n\nis a 69 million dollar movie, which is interesting\n\nbecause the movie actually made 72 million.\n\nSo Boot Straps came within three million of the total.\n\nThat's so far, so good.\n\nSo then I say, okay, how much better could it have been?\n\nWhat if these guys had brought you in earlier?\n\nHow would you have fixed it?\n\nThe first thing that turns out is,\n\nthese guys are obsessed, obsessed, with locale.\n\nIt's all they seem to care about.\n\nWhere is the movie set?\n\nIt comes up again and again and again\n\nas they talk about movies.\n\nThey think that locale is a character in a movie,\n\nand movies only work when that character\n\nplays off against the human characters.\n\nAnd so their first objection to this movie is,\n\nit's set in the UN, but it's not set in the UN.\n\nYou wanna place something in the UN,\n\nthe UN must be a present in every single scene.\n\nYou must realize you're there and not in some random\n\nnondescript office building.\n\nIt turns out that, parenthetically, they're obsessed\n\nwith desert islands and prisons.\n\nAnd I get the sense that if they were to make a movie,\n\nit would be movie that would go back and forth\n\nbetween two different stories,\n\none of which was set on a desert island,\n\nand one of which was set in a prison.\n\nOr, that it would be a movie about a prison\n\non a desert island. (audience laughing)\n\nSo they get to this whole thing about Africa\n\nand they cannot believe the movie starts in Africa.\n\n'Cause they just say, do these people know nothing?\n\nIt's an American audience, you can't set a movie in Africa.\n\nAmericans see Africa and their eyes glaze over.\n\nAnd they say, not only that,\n\nyou guys started in a fictional country in Africa.\n\nThey literally think this costs millions and millions\n\nof dollars, this decision.\n\nPink actually says at one point, he goes,\n\none of my favorite quotes from him, he says,\n\nthey bought their ticket, but when they come out\n\nthey're gonna say, 'it was alright,\n\n'but it was in Africa.' (audience laughing)\n\nAnd he's upset.\n\nI mean at this point, I almost think Pink's gonna cry.\n\nAnd it turns out, in fact, most of the things\n\nthat they care about are incredibly minor,\n\nthey're not central elements of the plot.\n\nLike they go in this whole riff about V for Vendetta,\n\nthat movie with those guys in masks\n\nand all they can say is, the masks cover the whole face.\n\nYou can't have a movie where\n\nthe mask covers the whole face.\n\nAnd they go in this riff about Spider-Man,\n\nyou can see his face.\n\nYou know, Batman.\n\nYou can actually make out who Batman is.\n\nYou can't have a mask.\n\nAnyway, it goes on, it was quite\n\nfascinating to me, apparently. (audience laughing)\n\nThey talk about this movie that they did once.\n\nThis analysis where\n\nthey said three things to the studio.\n\nThey said, first of all, your V character\n\nhas gotta have more personality.\n\nAnd if you put more personality in,\n\nyou'll make 2.46 million dollars more.\n\nAnd then they said, and you've gotta make the locale,\n\nthe city where it's filmed, more of a character.\n\nAnd that's worth 4.92 million.\n\nAnd if you give the lead character a side kick,\n\nsome little side kick, that's gonna be worth\n\n12.3 million dollars.\n\nAnd if you do the sidekick, the locale,\n\nand the better characterization, the synergy\n\nwill make you 24.6 million dollars.\n\nAnd by the way, those are not major things.\n\nYou can do that in a week.\n\nBoot Straps says, and if you don't do those three things,\n\nthe movie will make 36 million dollars.\n\nThey didn't do those three things,\n\nyou know how much the movie made?\n\n37 million.\n\nAnyway, back to The Interpreter.\n\nSo they have all these ideas.\n\nThey're really upset that the Tobin Keller character\n\nis white, they say, no, no, no, he's gotta be black.\n\nThey've clearly run the numbers on black, white pairings\n\nand they look really good.\n\nThey think there's too many characters, they go chop off.\n\nThey really are also obsessed with the idea\n\nof a woman in peril, clearly is a huge thing.\n\nAnd they think, you've got a woman in peril,\n\nbut the peril's not perilous enough.\n\nSo they go on and on about how she has to be\n\nreally, really in peril for this thing to work.\n\nPeril is so huge that, whenever Pink and Brown\n\ntalk about a woman in peril, they're like\n\nglancing at Copaken 'cause they think\n\nhe's gonna step in and stop them.\n\n'Cause that's how big that is in their world.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nThey rewrite the movie and their movie\n\ndoes not start in Africa.\n\nIt starts with Silvia Broome walking gaily into\n\nthe United Nations and waving\n\nat the flirtatious security guard.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nShe overhears the conversation, she doesn't run home.\n\nShe gets chased through the long, labyrinth\n\nhallways of the UN by the two bad guys.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nAnd then she gets chased all over Manhattan, in fact,\n\nand at one point, she's riding her motor scooter\n\nand they force her off the road when she's riding over\n\none of Manhattan's iconic bridges\n\nand the bike goes over the side\n\nand she's hanging on for dear life,\n\nand Tobin, in a helicopter, comes.\n\nYou know waka waka waka, comes down, lowers the rope.\n\nAnd here's my favorite line:\n\nas she clings to Tobin's muscular body,\n\nwhile the two of them are hoisted off\n\ninto the hovering helicopter,\n\nwe sense that she is feeling more than relief.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nIn the Epagogix's ending, Sylvia stabs\n\none of Zuwanie's street men with a knife\n\nand then in the melee, Zuwanie storms off the stage,\n\nand he holds a press conference, and then he's shot\n\nby Sylvia's brother, or a friend of Sylvia's brother,\n\nwho somehow is involved in the plot,\n\nand then Sylvia cradles the dying man in her lap,\n\nand he quote dies peaceably with a smile\n\non his blood spattered face.\n\nAnd then she gets appointed, in a plot twist\n\nI never fully understood, Motobo's Ambassador\n\nof the United Nations, (audience laughing)\n\nand at the end, she turns to Keller\n\nwith a kind of wry, flirtatious smile and says,\n\nnow you'll have to protect me.\n\nAnd then they run the numbers on their script,\n\nand how much does it make?\n\n111 million.\n\nNow, so then I say, this is all just blowing my mind,\n\nand I think, yeah, but, wait a minute,\n\nyou guys were still adhering to the basic\n\noutlines of this plot.\n\nLet's go crazy: just take the premise,\n\nand tell me how much you could make\n\njust on the premise of an interpreter\n\nwho's protected by a security guard.\n\nAt which point Mr. Pink says, alright.\n\nAnd he starts talking about The Bodyguard.\n\nNow I don't know if you remember The Bodyguard.\n\nIt was a huge hit a couple of years ago,\n\nin which Kevin Costner's a body guard\n\nwho's protecting Whitney Houston, who's a big star,\n\nand they fall in love in the end.\n\nAnd he says, look, this movie is basically The Bodyguard.\n\nAnd we could turn it into The Bodyguard.\n\nWe just take out Africa entirely.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nNo more politics, we'll have them fall in love\n\nand go off together, I think it could do 200 million.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nSo now I'm thinking, 200 million?\n\n20 minutes ago, it was a 33 million dollar movie.\n\nAnd then, now it's a 200 million blockbuster.\n\nI could sort of feel the excitement in the air.\n\nIt's just like, wow, this is like commerce in action.\n\nI'm getting carried away and I'm practically\n\ncalling my broker, (audience laughing)\n\nyou know, let's buy all the Hollywood studios now.\n\nAnd I look over at Pink and Brown and I realize\n\nthey're not happy.\n\nAnd in fact, Mr. Pink has this big kind\n\nof frown on his face, and I say, what's wrong?\n\nAnd Mr. Pink says, I didn't like The Bodyguard.\n\nHe doesn't want to turn it into The Bodyguard.\n\nSo then I ask around the room,\n\n'cause all the Epagogix guys are in the room,\n\nI said what would you do?\n\nIt turns out everyone is kind of a little ambivalent now\n\nand they think, one of the investors there says well,\n\nhe'd wanna juice it up, but only to 250 million.\n\nHe wouldn't feel comfortable going that extra 50 million.\n\nAnd Meaney says he wouldn't make it with Sean Penn\n\nand Nicole Kidman, he'd wanna do it with cheaper stars.\n\nAnd then I talked to Copaken and Copaken says,\n\nwell, he'd like to see to making Tobin Keller black and,\n\nhe doesn't really wanna go to 200 million either,\n\nbecause he's the guy who loved Dear Frankie,\n\nand you know what Dear Frankie made in the box office?\n\n1.3 million.\n\nAnd if he knows that if Miramax had used his system\n\nback then, they never would have made Dear Frankie\n\nand that, you know, it breaks his heart,\n\n'cause he loves the movies.\n\nThen Mr. Brown says that\n\nwhat he would do is he would take, really,\n\nthe original script, and make it for 10 million\n\nwith no stars at all and kind of releases\n\nan indie movie and hoped that word of mouth\n\ngets them maybe a prize at the\n\nNew York Film Festival or something.\n\nSo here they are, they started with this 33 million\n\ndollar movie, they've shown how\n\nit can make 69 million dollars,\n\nand then they turn 69 into a 111 million dollars,\n\nthen they turn the 111 into 200 million dollars.\n\nThey know how to do this.\n\nThey actually have the means to bring\n\nabout this transformation and they can't\n\nbring themselves to accept it.\n\nSo here they are.\n\nThey've unlocked the secrets of the movie business\n\nand all it's done is it's made them\n\na little down in the mouth.\n\nAnd that's when I realize something about people\n\nwho believe in rules:\n\nthat they don't make the task of movie making easier,\n\nthey really make it harder.\n\n'Cause when you don't know anything,\n\nthen you can do whatever you want, right,\n\nin good conscience.\n\nYou can start a movie in Africa and you can have ambiguity\n\nand you can talk about politics\n\nand you can make a woman in peril a subtle thing\n\nand not an ambiguous thing.\n\nNo one's gonna call you on it because nobody knows.\n\nBut once you have the formula,\n\nyou don't have any kind of freedom anymore\n\nand you've gotta decide,\n\nright down to the exact dollar figure,\n\njust how much money willing to sacrifice for your art.\n\nIn other words, what the formula does,\n\nis it makes you think the way that every other\n\nindustry in America has to think.\n\nAnd that, at the end of the day, just isn't that much fun.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n(audience applause)\n\nIf this gets a dot to going forward\n\nby the unifications for creativity,\n\nalso along the lines of the music clusters,\n\nclearly all 60 of those didn't exist simultaneously\n\nat the beginning of time, so to speak,\n\nclearly new clusters over time are created.\n\nHow are those identified and,\n\nin this kind of applied mechanics of\n\ntaking this approach to product development,\n\nhow will we ever find these new creative thigs,\n\nand will they be totally repressed\n\nand never come to the fore where people\n\ncan expand their consciousness\n\nand their artistic creation and share it\n\nwit the world so to speak?\n\nA very good question.\n\nI have a couple of things to say.\n\nLet's be clear that, I have no idea whether\n\nthis things works.\n\nI mean, it sounds like it does, but I don't know.\n\nAnd if it does work, whether it will keep working,\n\nwhich is the question you're getting at,\n\nand I think is a very good one,\n\nthat our tastes are sufficiently fluid,\n\nthat is it the case that formulas that\n\nare successful in the past will\n\nbe successful in the future?\n\nNow what the Epagogix guys will say is,\n\nthat's absolutely right, which is why we keep\n\nchanging our formula, A.\n\nBut more important, they will tell you,\n\nwe don't pretend to predict everything,\n\nbut there's always gonna be outliers\n\nthat are really significant that we're not...\n\nSo they say that, we'll never be able to tell you\n\nthat you've got a 10 million dollar film\n\nthat will do 200 million.\n\nSo Big Fat Greek Wedding, you're not gonna.\n\nWhat their sweet spot is, is the 50 million dollar\n\nstandard Hollywood drama or comedy.\n\nThat is, to begin with, fairly formulaic,\n\nand everyone realizes the formula.\n\nBoy meets girl, right?\n\nThey can do when boy meets girl.\n\nBad guy, heroic villain, or heroic spy.\n\nThey can figure all that out for you,\n\nto the extent that you are consciously being formulaic.\n\nThey'll help you be better at being formulaic.\n\nOn the music thing, it's funny.\n\nI tell those two stories simultaneously.\n\nThere are some interesting differences.\n\nMcCready is quite adamant that what he has done is\n\ntapped into something absolutely universal\n\nabout the human brain.\n\nSo he says, he doesn't just limit his analysis\n\nto pop songs in the last 30 years.\n\nHe's got Beethoven.\n\nAnd he'll tell you that Beethoven's best song\n\nis in one of his hit clusters,\n\nand the stuff by Beethoven that no one listens to,\n\nisn't in it.\n\nSo he says, again, who knows?\n\nI haven't done this analysis, I find it\n\nkind of fascinating, I'm a little bit skeptical,\n\nbut not enough that it would stop me\n\nfrom writing a story about it. (audience laughing)\n\nHe thinks that there is something,\n\nhe's tapped into something profound\n\nabout the way our minds work, and\n\nthe way that our brains register pleasure.\n\nAnd do I find it completely impossible\n\nor improbable that there is some fundamental way\n\nthat almost all of us return to when it comes to\n\nseeking pleasure from some creative thing?\n\nI don't find that impossible.\n\nIn principle, I think that idea might have something to it.\n\nIt's a really good question.\n\nSure.\n\nMy question is perhaps somewhat similar\n\nor a slightly different angle on it,\n\nwhich is you mention that McCready,\n\nwhile he feels he's found something universal,\n\nalso recognizes that of the 60 clusters that are potential,\n\nonly 15 might be live at any point in time.\n\nI wondered if the movie guides have used any\n\nof that same sort of time series thinking\n\nto notice that certain types of movies,\n\nor certain opportunities, may come at a certain time\n\nand not at others?\n\nYeah, this is the big difference between\n\nMcCready and Copaken.\n\nCopaken's guys, Pink and Brown,\n\ndon't believe...\n\nIn Hollywood, they're obsessed with\n\nwhen you release, they'll say it feels like a,\n\nthat's a fall movie for me, not a summer movie.\n\nOr that's a winter movie.\n\nAnd the Copaken guys think that's complete hogwash\n\nand that a story is a story is a story.\n\nThey do all their analysis without any\n\nkind of periodicity issue built in.\n\nNow there's another periodicity issue which is,\n\nare we more in love with the serious thriller\n\nin the three years after 9/11,\n\nthan we were at the end of the go go 80s?\n\nAnd I don't know whether they have built that in,\n\n'cause of course I don't know what their algorithm is.\n\nIt doesn't sound to me...\n\nYou pick up little bits and pieces\n\nand because I figured out who they were,\n\nI was able to go to these obscure journals\n\nand read a lot of what Pink and Brown write about.\n\nAnd when you go back and read the original\n\nwritings of Mr. Pink and Mr. Brown,\n\nwhat you understand when you immerse\n\nyourself in the thought of Pink and Brown,\n\nis they're really, really, really obsessed\n\nwith biblical stories.\n\nThey think those are the err narratives.\n\nSo that would suggest that they don't think...\n\nIt's not like the story of Goliath goes out of style.\n\nOr the story of Samson only works in the\n\nfifth, seventh, and 12th centuries,\n\nand not so much in the medieval period.\n\nIt couldn't be because they watched\n\nthat early part of the TV show first?\n\nThe biblical lectures first, and then the movies,\n\nwhen they started?\n\nYou have no idea.\n\nThese men are, like I said, men of enormous mystery.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nAnd I could only begin to grasp what their...\n\nYou speak of neural networking as being as good\n\nas good as the varaibles that you put into it.\n\nSo from the offset, it sounds like there's\n\ncertain obvious ones to me that would make a difference\n\nthat they didn't consider at all,\n\nsuch as the star power.\n\nYou sort of have the Tom Hanks effect,\n\nor the Tom Cruise effect, and they don't even\n\nconsider that at all, so why even, you know?\n\nThis is the interesting thing.\n\nThey are radically uninterested in.\n\nNow, it's not just them\n\nwho are uninterested in star power.\n\n(audience laughing)\n\nMost Hollywood economists...\n\nThere's a whole very, very strong school of\n\nthought among economists that\n\nthe particular fixation of Hollywood executives\n\nwith stars is ludicrous.\n\nI've had long conversations with people\n\nin Hollywood about this.\n\nWhat they will basically say is,\n\nthe star does two things for you, three things:\n\nnumber one, you're a studio executive.\n\nYou're at Warner Brothers.\n\nThere are 25 or 30 projects competing, internally,\n\nfor a small sum of money.\n\nYou only have the money to make 10.\n\nHow do you get your three to be one of those 10?\n\nYou get it through a star.\n\nYou get to go into the room and you say,\n\nI've got Tom Cruise.\n\nAnd the guy next to you says, I have William Macy.\n\nYou win, right? (audience laughing)\n\nThe star works as a internal function\n\nthat has nothing to do with the outside world.\n\nReason number two is, there's some evidence\n\nto suggest what a star does is it\n\nlimits how much the movie can bomb.\n\nSo you have a stinker and it costs you 100 million to make\n\nand it makes 10 million.\n\nYou have a stinker with Nicole Kidman,\n\nit cost 100 million and it makes 15 million.\n\nYou feel a little bit better about it,\n\nhaving it around, 'cause you think,\n\nwe think that's what it does.\n\nThe third thing is, there's certain,\n\nvery specific kinds of movies that help\n\nwith overseas sales.\n\nBut there's almost no one who thinks anymore\n\nthat a star makes an appreciable difference\n\nin the domestic box office of most movies.\n\nThere's no evidence for it.\n\nYou can run, all these regressions have been done,\n\nyou can't see, aside from very, very fleeting effects\n\nfor certain stars,\n\nit doesn't seem to have an effect.\n\nAnd if it does, the effect it does,\n\nis swamped by the amount of money you pay them.\n\nSo maybe Tom Cruise is worth 10 million dollars\n\nto your movie, but he costs you 20 million dollars.\n\nBut that still requires a variable, right,\n\nto sort of weigh out.\n\nBut remember, as well, it's also in their interests.\n\nThey're doing the analysis before the script\n\nis usually cast, so they can't use it.\n\nBut their argument is, we don't need it.\n\nWe can capture much of what needs to be captured\n\nwithout the use of that.\n\nWhich I thought is interesting,\n\nbecause I think if you were to ask any person,\n\nhave you ever gone to a movie because\n\nit was Johnny Depp and you didn't care\n\nabout the premise of the movie,\n\nbut you think he's a terrific actor?\n\nThat most people can say, at least once,\n\nin their experience that they've gone to a movie\n\nsolely because of that reason.\n\nIt's interesting because, although one way\n\nI would explain that is that\n\ncertain well known movie stars become,\n\ntheir presence is a kind in, encodes a narrative.\n\nSo if I say to you, I'm gonna go see\n\na movie called Heart Attack involving Harrison Ford,\n\ndo I need to tell you what the script is?\n\nYou know what the script is. (audience laughing)\n\nMiddle aged corporate executive with young,\n\nattractive wife, and two small children\n\ngets caught in some, right? (audience laughing)\n\nOther people have tried to game other industries\n\nlike in the way you mentioned, such as\n\nKomar and Melamid with the visual arts,\n\nand Christoper Alexander with architecture.\n\nWhy is it more successful with the movies.\n\nI know you said music has several, fewer variables,\n\nbut movies are more successful.\n\nThe other would be,\n\nyou mentioned studio executives at the beginning\n\nof your talk\n\nwho, it seems like a crap shoot with\n\nwhat they approve and what doesn't approve\n\nand how much box office it makes.\n\nWhat do Pink and Brown bring to the table that,\n\nthese Hollywood studio executives that have also been\n\nstudying it for years, don't seem to have?\n\nWell what they bring,\n\nyou're right, there's always been this strain\n\nin the arts of people who wanna game,\n\nwith varying degrees of success.\n\nI think that what these guys are bringing to the table\n\nis that Hollywood is going through, it strikes me,\n\nhas been going through a period\n\nof a great kind of anti-intellectual period,\n\nor a period where they have turned their backs on a rigor.\n\nEvery now and again, Hollywood is transformed\n\nby outside money.\n\nAnd the outsiders come in and they think,\n\nif only these guys ran their business like a business,\n\nwe could make a lot of money.\n\nSony buys MCA, or whatever they bought,\n\npays billions of dollars,\n\nloses their entire investment,\n\nand runs home with their tail between their legs\n\nbecause, in fact, they couldn't pull it off.\n\nSo after that, Hollywood goes back into this thinking\n\nthat we are a cottage industry.\n\nWe deal with talent.\n\nYou can't bring in any kind of rules.\n\nAnd then, that goes on for 10 years,\n\nand then the people creep back again.\n\nSo what's going on right now is,\n\nhalf of the money, 50% of the money\n\nin Hollywood right now, for movies,\n\ncomes from hedge funds.\n\nCall your broker, now. (audience laughing)\n\nWhy are these guys involved?\n\nBecause they think they can figure it out.\n\nSo the hedge fund money, and Epagogix,\n\nmy guess, is where will they end up?\n\nThey will end up being a tool used\n\nby a series of hedge funds to analyze projects,\n\nwhich to invest in.\n\nThe pendulum is swung back towards,\n\nnow, do I think it'll end happily?\n\nNo, I mean at some point, there'll be some\n\nmassive blow out and there'll be some movie,\n\nthey spent 100 million dollars, and it'll\n\ntank and the hedge fund will run.\n\nBut there is this kind of constant\n\ntension between these two extremes\n\nthat I think that we're swinging towards.\n\nAnd that's when you had 10 years of,\n\nit's just all art and it's a cottage industry.\n\nIt's very attractive when someone sits down and says,\n\nI can help you identify just exactly what.\n\nI just wanted to ask you,\n\nlast year you talked about the dear of precociousness\n\nand how you can predict genius in children\n\nand however genius is defined.\n\nBut, I was just sort of thinking about that\n\nand how, the formulaic idea of music and art and creativity,\n\nand just how you lose that organic maturation\n\nthat, you know, I think you talked during that speech\n\nabout how the sophomore hit is sometimes the bigger hit\n\nand as you let an artist or a writer develop,\n\nyou may get that, what turns people on.\n\nAnd I'm just sort of seeing the connection here,\n\nI wonder if you could talk more about that.\n\nYeah.\n\nThere's absolutely no question that these tools\n\nused in a unsubtle way, what can have the\n\neffect of choking off true innovation.\n\nThere's a reason why you want\n\nthe formula to remain a secret,\n\n'cause you don't wanna give everyone the formula,\n\n'cause then you're gonna get everything by the formula.\n\nAnd there's a reason why you don't want everyone to this.\n\nA thing that the Epagogix guys say is,\n\nlike I said earlier, they would like to see\n\ntheir tool used in a particular band of movies.\n\nAnd if you look at a typical Hollywood studio,\n\nloses most of its money on a very particular\n\nkind of movie, on the 50 million dollar.\n\nThey make a batch of 50 million dollar movies every year.\n\nThe make 10 of them, and that's where they sustain\n\ntheir worst losses, that's where they need help.\n\nThe stuff at the low end, you can't use this tool\n\nto analyze an independent film, and you shouldn't.\n\nThe stuff at the high end, you don't need it.\n\nIf you do Batman Four, do you really need someone\n\nto tell you what the formula is?\n\nI would hope you know the formula by now, right?\n\nWhat they're saying is, look,\n\nif you're gonna make your next Michelle Pfeiffer\n\nfalls in love with William Hurt flick,\n\nwe can tell you how to move it from\n\n35 million, to 47.\n\nThat does not offend my belief in the future\n\nof Hollywood creativity.\n\nI feel like, that's of a piece with\n\nProctor and Gamble coming up with new and improved Tide.\n\n(audience laughing) Thank you.\n\n(audience applause)"
