        "text": "THE temptation to interpret works of art in terms of their creators' biographies can be a powerful and terrible thing: the biographical approach is a fallacy at best, and at worst the snake in the garden of aesthetics. The temptation is, however, tough to resist in the case of \"The Ballad of Jack and Rose,\" a movie about the almost unnaturally close relationship between an idealistic, sternly principled man and his teenage daughter, who live together on an island off the Atlantic coast of the United States, in a sort of pristine alternate universe constructed by him and inhabited (metaphorically) only by him and her. The film is written and directed by Rebecca Miller, daughter of the playwright and moralist Arthur Miller, who died last month. The role of the counterculture-Prospero dad is played by her husband of eight years, Daniel Day-Lewis, who is, as it happens, also the offspring of a rather imposing literary figure (C. Day Lewis, once Britain's poet laureate).\n\nSo at the end of a long, wide-ranging conversation with Ms. Miller and Mr. Day-Lewis on a very cold New York day, I have to ask whether it might, perhaps, be fair to say their own parents were, um, somewhat overpowering personalities. (Their mothers, too, were artists: hers, the photographer Inge Morath; his, the actress Jill Balcon.) Ms. Miller nods emphatically; Mr. Day-Lewis says, \"Absolutely.\" And did that fact have any sort of impact on their work in \"The Ballad of Jack and Rose\"? Ms. Miller answers, \"I did put a lot of myself as a young girl into Rose -- a sense of growing up, not nearly with the same level of isolation, but feeling kind of on my own out in the country, and that almost primitive personality she has.\" Her husband, addressing her, adds gently, \"And that protectiveness you had toward your father.\" After a pause, all she can say is: \"It's always so hard finally to dismember something you've made and recall how much of yourself is in it and how much is your imagination and how much is observation. A weird amnesia comes upon you, and sometimes I think other people are better at figuring these things out than I am.\"\n\nThere's no point, I realize, in pressing this issue, either with Mr. Day-Lewis (who has, in fact, avoided the question entirely) or with Ms. Miller, whose creative amnesia seems less an evasion than a principle, a conviction. Earlier, she has said to me, speaking not of her own art but of her husband's: \"Nobody who makes anything can tell someone else exactly how they do it, because they don't really know themselves.\" She describes his \"mysterious\" process of preparation as \"talking into a tape recorder, then going off into a room alone, and you realize that, gradually, somebody is quickening in there, and it's amazing when that person comes out and\" -- Mr. Day-Lewis finishes for her -- \"she sees what she's got to live with for the next year and a half.\" They laugh, and you sense that for whatever reason, biographical or otherwise, these people are perfectly at ease with each other's eccentricities, that a degree of bizarre, obsessive behavior is nothing remarkable to them -- as unquestionable and, at times, as comic an aspect of everyday life as the frenzied scratching of the family dog.\n\nMr. Day-Lewis's obsessiveness is fairly well known, and, as they both tell it, Ms. Miller had to adapt quickly. He says, \"Before this film Rebecca had already seen me through a couple of working experiences, the most shocking of which was probably 'The Boxer' -- we got married one day, the next day she realized she was living with a Belfast boxer.\" She says, mock-indignantly, \"He never told me he wasn't going to stop being that character.\" When they met -- through her father, whom Mr. Day-Lewis had befriended while making \"The Crucible\" (1996) -- Ms. Miller had already completed her first feature, \"Angela\" (1995), and he didn't get a chance to watch her working as a director until several years later, when \"as an antidote,\" he says, \"to the eight months of shooting 'Gangs of New York,\"' he tagged along for the hectic three-week, low-budget shoot of her film \"Personal Velocity\" (2002), a trilogy about women at early turning points in their young lives. He was impressed, he says, and, he admits, \"sort of envious\" of the communal atmosphere on her upstate New York set. \"I wanted to be a part of that thing.\""
