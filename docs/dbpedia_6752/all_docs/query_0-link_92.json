        "text": "Legislation to renew jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed has cleared an initial Senate hurdle, but the bill's fate remains in doubt.\n\nThe vote Tuesday was 60-37 to limit debate on the legislation, with a half-dozen Republicans siding with the Democrats.\n\nAt the same time, Senate Republicans served notice they would attempt to change the measure so the $6.4 billion cost would not add to deficits - a step that Democrats have so far rejected.\n\nAs drafted, the bill would restore between 14 weeks and 47 weeks of benefits averaging $256 weekly to an estimated 1.3 million long-term jobless who were affected when the program expired Dec. 28. Without action by Congress, thousands more each week would feel the impact as their state-funded benefits expire, generally after 26 weeks.\n\nNPR congressional correspondent Ailsa Chang joins Here & Now's Robin Young with the latest.\n\nGuest"
