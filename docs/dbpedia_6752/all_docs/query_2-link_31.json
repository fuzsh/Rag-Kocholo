During that time, I have been challenged by my students on every aspect of what I teach, and I am deeply grateful to all of them. It is said that the best way to learn a subject is to teach it, and I have found this to be true. The class has forced me to think about the procedures and methods I have used since entering the film business in 1974. Doing so has caused me to refine and distill these ideas, and to be able to anticipate many of the questions that newcomers arriving in this field may have. The information in this book is a result of that process and my over thirty years in the business of making feature films. It is intended as a source of practical information, presented in a way that I hope is both entertaining and instructive. No book is created in a vacuum and this one is no exception. I want to thank Jordan Susman, writer, director, and fellow producer of The Anarchist Cookbook, for allowing me to use his film as an example; Alan Bell, editor extraordinaire, for proofing the chapter on post production; Bruce Block, producer, professor, author, and friend, for his advice and guidance on navigating, which for me were the uncharted waters of authorship; and finally Howard Kazanjian, producer and author, who has been my mentor since I started in this business as a trainee. This book could not have been completed without the extraordinary help and encouragement of my editor, my partner, and my wife. Fortunately for me, they are all one person, Karen Kalton. While it is generally true that to be edited is to be humbled, to be edited by Karen is to be given unfair advantage over one’s shortcomings.\n\nIntroduction Making a film is a complex undertaking. It is equivalent to building a skyscraper or carrying out a small invasion. It involves synchronizing the efforts of vast numbers of people over months or years, and sometimes such a project can cost a hundred million dollars or more. I have often marveled at the complexity of a modern skyscraper (while scouting its deepest dungeons for a film location), tracing the various utility lines running like nerves and blood vessels to unknown places. How do we build such complex structures? Through planning. No one is capable of fully imagining such a structure in its entirety all at once. In order to conceive the complexity of such a construction, it is necessary to break the project down into manageable parts. So it is with film. To plan a film production intelligently and efficiently, it must also be broken down into manageable parts or we become overwhelmed with the details. In Jurassic Park when the water in the mud puddle vibrated from the footsteps of the Tyrannosaurus rex, the crew did not just show up with all of its equipment hoping to find a mud puddle that they could film. Someone had to choose where the puddle would be, someone else had to dig the puddle, someone else had to fill it with water, and finally, someone had to work out a way to make it vibrate on cue. Of course, this is in addition to all the people and equipment it took to put the image of the vibrating water on film. Before any of the above could happen, someone had to plan it. That person is the unit production manager and/or the line producer. The Directors Guild of America (DGA) defines a unit production manager\n\nxii Introduction\n\n(also simply referred to as the production manager or upm) as that person who: …under the supervision of the Employer, is required to coordinate, facilitate and oversee the preparation of the production unit or units (to the extent herein provided) assigned to him or her, all off-set logistics, day-to-day production decisions, locations, budget schedules and personnel.* It goes on to enumerate further the duties of the unit production manager to include, but not be limited to, the following: 1. Prepare breakdown and preliminary shooting schedule. 2. Prepare or coordinate the budget. 3. Oversee preliminary search and survey of all locations and the completion of business arrangements for the same. 4. Assist in the preparation of the production to insure continuing efficiency. 5. Supervise completion of the Production Report for each day’s work, showing work covered and the status of the production, and arrange for the distribution of that report in line with the company’s requirement. 6. Coordinate arrangements for the transportation and housing of cast, crew and staff. 7. Oversee the securing of releases and negotiate for locations and personnel. 8. Maintain a liaison with local authorities regarding locations and the operation of the company. † The Producers Guild of America (PGA) officially calls the line producer the co-producer. They define a co-producer as: 1. …the individual who reports directly to the individual(s) receiving “Produced By” credit on the theatrical motion picture. 2. The Co-Producer is the single individual who has the primary responsibility for the logistics of the production, from preproduction through completion of production; all Department Heads report directly to the Co-Producer. ‡ * Directors Guild of America, 2002 Basic Agreement, 11. † Ibid. 11-12 ‡ Producers Guild of America, “Producers Code of Credits,” Membership Roster 2004-2005, 20.\n\nIntroduction xiii\n\nA production may operate with just a unit production manager or both a UPM and a line producer. A film must include a production manager if it is made under the Directors Guild of America contract. Often a line producer is an experienced UPM, and can take on the functions of both jobs. The busiest and most intensive time on a picture for a production manager or line producer is during the pre-production or planning phase. Once the picture starts shooting, the line producer tracks the progress of the picture, maintains its efficiency, and runs as fast as he or she can to keep up. A line producer can be compared to the Greek mythological character Sisyphus rolling a huge boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down again and again. Unlike the myth though, eventually the boulder does get to the top of the hill and starts to roll down the other side of its own accord. At that point, Sisyphus, our line producer, has to run for all he or she is worth just to keep up. Without the proper planning, it can only end in disaster.\n\n‘Ready when you are, CB’ This famous story exists in many forms and it may or may not be true. It is valuable, however, since it illustrates how the unexpected can happen. Here is how it was told to me. One morning, Cecil B. DeMille, the great epic director, started rehearsing one of the most difficult scenes in The Ten Commandments. The scene involved thousands of extras, hundreds of horses, chariots, Egyptian legions, hoards of Israelites, and hundreds of crew members. They started at 6 am, working out all of the various cues for each of the groups of people. An army of wranglers prepped the horses and made sure each had an experienced rider on board. The special effects crew rigged all of the exciting effects, and by late afternoon the camera crews had all three cameras in place. The assistant director told DeMille that he thought they were ready. DeMille gave the order to shoot immediately since they had only enough daylight for one take. The assistant director raised his megaphone and called for quiet. “Roll cameras!” he shouted. “Action!” commanded DeMille. The Egyptian army surged forward. The Israelites went into mock panic. The horses charged. The special effects went off flawlessly. A charioteer flew through the air as planned when his chariot lost a wheel. Finally, his face flushed with excitement, DeMille shouted, “Cut! Cut! That was beautiful! Perfect! Did we get it?”\n\nxiv Introduction\n\nThe a camera operator came running up from his camera position. “I’m terribly sorry, Mr. DeMille,” he said, “The bloody camera jammed right at the beginning.” You could see the disappointment in DeMille’s face but he said, “No matter. You weren’t the only camera. b camera, how did you do?” The b camera operator was pulling himself out from under the wreckage of an overturned chariot while the camera assistant gathered up what was left of his camera. “Not well, I’m afraid,” he moaned. DeMille turned to the C camera operator perched high up on a hill. He had the wide shot and would have caught all the action. DeMille grabbed the assistant director’s megaphone and waved to the operator. “C camera, how did you do?” he shouted. The c camera operator cheerily waved back and replied, “Ready when you are, CB.” Apocryphal or not, the story is funny because it contains truth. Anyone who has ever worked on a film will attest to this. In fact, many of the procedures that will be outlined in this book got their start because of someone’s misfortune or disaster. For instance, if this scene were being filmed today, there would have been five or more cameras, not just three. In addition, the director would never have called “Action” until every camera operator confirmed he was rolling with a shout of “Speed!”\n\nMurphy Is In Complete Control Along with change, Murphy’s Law is a constant in film production. Whatever can go wrong will go wrong are wise words to remember. Throughout this book, I will use actual disasters on actual films as a way of illustrating what can go wrong and how to prepare for it. Avoiding disaster is a large part of production planning and it is important to anticipate what could go wrong.\n\nA Little History It is helpful in understanding the concepts I will be writing about if one understands their origin. Film complexity has evolved, and with it so have the methods of dealing with that complexity. In the early days of film production, the shooting schedule was the same length as the running time of the film. There were no cuts or coverage. You just set up the camera and staged everything in front of it as though the\n\nIntroduction xv\n\ncamera were the audience. Most of the early Edison films were done this way. They never amounted to more than a sketch and their running time was never more than a few minutes. The scripts were patterned after short play scripts and there were no numbered scenes. Watching these early films was much like watching a vaudeville performance. When films became longer and they began to involve more than one location or set, the scheduling became more difficult. It was no longer practical to shoot the separate scenes in story order. If the story returned to a specific location at three separate times in the script, it made better sense to shoot those three scenes all at once, eliminating the need for the shooting company to return to the same place again. In order to better organize the shoots, filmmakers began to number the scenes in the script. They would put the scene number and a short description of the scene on index cards which they would then pin to a cork board. In this way, they could organize the cards according to which scenes they would shoot on specific days. In the mid-1920s, German director Fritz Lang improved upon this method by replacing the index cards with strips of adding machine tape. This afforded more space for the filmmakers to include elements necessary to each scene such as cast, extras, props, animals, vehicles, and special equipment. An example of why this was beneficial is if a cast member was only available on certain days, the scenes with that cast member could be identified at glance and moved to the days that the actor was available. To accommodate the importance of scene numbers, the film script evolved into its current format with numbered scenes and descriptive sluglines (see Chapter 3). The collections of adding machine tape pinned to a wall evolved into the modern production board. We will go into detail on both script format and production boards in later chapters.\n\nStages of Preparation Even before you can secure financing, you need to determine what your film will cost. Whether your project is a student film or a hundred million dollar epic, the preparation of a film for shooting (and in the process learning what it will cost) can be broken down into a few major stages. Outside of securing financing, the stages of pre-production are briefly: • Breakdown of the script • Creation of a schedule • Making a Budget\n\nxvi Introduction\n\n• Securing Sets and Locations • Casting the Roles • Hiring a Crew We will go into further detail in each of these stages, and along the way, you will learn to look at film production in an entirely new way.\n\nPart I The Basics\n\n1 Why Low-Budget? For most people, the answer to this is a lack of funds. If they had access to more money, they would gladly use it. However, a high budget does not guarantee high returns. Many low-budget directors have found themselves suddenly in great demand when their low-budget, original and creative film hits it big. They then go on to make huge, big budget, studio-financed pictures, which sometimes fail. When I was a graduate film student at UCLA, I heard Roger Corman speak. After his presentation, he took questions from the audience. Corman was considered king of the B pictures at the time, and I asked him if he ever considered making a large-budget studio film. He answered me with an emphatic, “No.” He explained that if he were to raise his budgets he would have to involve the studios to help him finance his pictures, and if he did that, he would lose control. He was not just being an egomaniac. Being in control of your project is crucial to it coming out as you envisioned it. Picture yourself in a meeting with the studio creative execs. They tell you that you will get a green light (approval to start) on your film if it can be cast satisfactorily, and they hand you a list of suggestions for the role of Mother Teresa. You glance down the list, anxious for the expert advice from these people who know film and the film business inside and out, and your eyes lock on the top name on the list. “Paris Hilton?” you gasp. “Hey, she was great in that TV thing she did,” the exec tells you. “It made a bundle…and we’d want to modify the habit she’s wearing of course. Oh,\n\n4 Part I The Basics\n\nand she’s willing to leave the dog at home. She’s really hot.” You hesitate, “But…” “Look,” the exec says, “do you want to make the picture or not?” Okay, I’m exaggerating, but not by much. I actually have had a studio executive say those very words to me, Do you want to make the picture or not? Do you do what they ask with a possibility of going on to fame and fortune, or do you go back to waiting tables for the rest of your life? It’s not an easy question to answer, even with the prospect of Paris Hilton playing Mother Teresa. I certainly don’t mean to cast aspersions on the talents of Ms Hilton, but as Mother Teresa? But then, she is really hot… And look at it from the studio’s point of view. With the $60,000,000 they are going to give you to make your film, they need some assurance that it will make some money. Paris Hilton might guarantee a certain level of box office return. And with that huge investment, shouldn’t they have some say? Control is also crucial to your production being satisfying and fun. On big budget movies, the dollar dictates everything and you must answer to the studio for the decisions you make. You must justify your every move to the people in charge. On a low-budget production, you are the person in charge. You make the decisions and live or die on the consequences. You don’t have to check with six people before you can make a deal. The decision is yours. You are answerable only to your investors. There is great responsibility in freedom, but there is great freedom in that responsibility.\n\nWhat is a Low-Budget Film? Low-budget is a relative term. These days a studio would consider a film costing $5,000,000 low-budget. In fact, it is very low-budget when compared to their usual fare of projects costing $40,000,000 to over $100,000,000. Studios make these extravaganzas in hopes of generating box office returns in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Nevertheless, a big budget does not guarantee box-office success..\n\nThe Union Definitions The Screen Actors Guild of America (SAG) has several levels of budgets that they recognize under various conditions. (See 809-00 Talent in Chapter 18.) Their standard definition defines a low-budget film as any theatrical film under $2 million. There are exceptions which can increase\n\n1 Why Low-Budget? 5\n\nthis amount. The Directors Guild of America used to define a low-budget film as any theatrical film costing $500,000 or less. They defined a medium-budget film as any theatrical film costing over $500,000 up to and including $1,500,000. Anything over $1,500,000 was termed a high-budget film. Most recently, the DGA has revised their definitions to list four separate levels of low-budget films ranging from $1,030,000 and under up to $7,000,000. They are even exploring special consideration for projects under $500,000. These budget totals are known as the negative costs of a picture, meaning the cost of producing the final cut negative which does not include release prints, marketing expense, and distribution expense. These definitions by the guilds are important to you only in how they affect the rates that you will be paying for people employed under the respective guild contracts. We will go into more detail on this when we discuss budgeting.\n\nWhat Is It Really? If you are truly rolling in money, your budget will probably be in the $5,000,000 range. However, it is more likely to be in the $2,000,000 and under range. Some very successful films have been made for less than $500,000. The Blair Witch Project cost somewhere between $19.95 and who knows how much­—the producers aren’t talking. Let’s say you raise $2,000,000. Until recently, the dga would have said you are making a high-budget movie. Is it a high-budget movie? Maybe for D. W. Griffith. That is why they have revised their definition. If you plan to pay everyone, and your uncle does not own Panavision, you will be using all the tricks I can teach you to stay on budget.\n\n2 How Do I Get Into This Business? This is the single question asked most often by my students at usc. There are no set routes. Ask ten people in the business how they got there and you will get ten different stories. Formal apprenticeship programs are few and far between. The Editors’ union, Local 700 and the Script Supervisors’ union, Local 871 in Los Angeles have on occasion conducted apprenticeship programs. The dga and the Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers (ampta) jointly sponsor the Assistant Directors Training Program. My experience in my own career and in observing the careers of others is that the single most important quality you can have in pursuing a motion picture career is persistence. Rumor has it that you may even get an Oscar, if you live long enough.\n\nPursue Your Dream A very holy and devoted saint died after a long and selfless life. When he arrived in heaven, God wanted to reward the saint’s virtue and asked if he could build the saint a heavenly mansion in which to spend eternity. The saint smiled a shy smile and said that although God’s offer was most generous and greatly appreciated, the saint was used to living in his simple room with a hard pallet as a bed. God then said that he would bestow upon the saint a handsome limousine with angelic retainers at his disposal so that he might wander through heaven in comfort and style. The saint bowed\n\n8 Part I The Basics\n\nhis head and said that he hoped God would not be offended but that the saint preferred his quiet walks in heaven’s gardens where he could meditate alone on the beauty of God’s work. God was filled with respect and admiration for this humble servant. “Is there nothing I can grant you in reward for your life of service to others?” God asked. The saint thought for a moment, and that same shy smile flashed fleetingly across his face. “Well,” he said, “I would like to direct.” Most students in film school today want to direct, write, produce, or become a director of photography. Those without these specific ambitions enter film school thinking that they want to become a “filmmaker.” Very few enter film school with the idea that they want to become a production manager, assistant director, special effects technician, costume supervisor, makeup artist, propmaster, set dresser, or fill any of the other numerous positions essential to the production of a film today. If you are a student, or someone just starting out on a career path, this is the most flexible time of your life. You most likely do not yet have a mortgage or a family to support. You can afford to work cheap, delay rewards, and try different things. If you are encumbered with those responsibilities, you can still go after your dreams in your spare time and on weekends. Internships and production assistant (PA) positions are useful as places that you can use to learn about the different areas of film production and to see what each has to offer. However, there is a lot of competition to land one of these spots. Networking and meeting as many people in the business as possible will help tremendously in finding opportunities. Also, check the trades for films starting up or ads looking for people. However, if you want to direct, go direct. Direct anything you can get your hands on. Direct commercials. Direct student films. Direct theater. Direct video productions of your own scripts. Direct music videos for local bands. Direct 30-second public service videos and give them away to local stations. If you want to write, go write — every single day. Don’t stop writing. Study films, read scripts, immerse yourself. If you want to produce, go produce. Produce your friends’ short or feature length film scripts. Produce your own ideas. Produce ads for local businesses. Produce videos for local actors to show off their skills. If you want to be rich, go into investment banking. What is important here is to follow your heart’s desire. Follow your dream. Joseph Campbell said, “Follow your bliss.” Fame and riches can and often do follow. But if they don’t, you are still rich because you are doing what you love to do.\n\n2\n\nHow Do I Get Into This Business? 9\n\nDV—The Great Equalizer That’s all very well, you may say, but film production costs thousands and thousands of dollars. But who said it has to be film production? In the old west, Samuel Colt gave to the world the “great equalizer,” a six-shooter that allowed any 98-pound weakling to take on the toughest hombre in town, as long as his hand did not shake too badly. There is a new equalizer on the frontier and it is called Digital Video or dv, and if The Blair Witch Project is any indication, it does not matter if your hand does shake. Blair Witch was shot on dv and was purposely made to look amateurish to reinforce the conceit that it was a tape found in the woods. DV can look a lot better. Not long ago, an article titled “In This Day and Age, Everyone’s a Director” appeared emphasizing dv’s accessibility (Los Angeles Times April 8, 2000). DURHAM, N.C.—Matt Brutacao was a sophomore in high school when he wrote, shot, directed and edited “Stealing Can Be Murder,” a two-hour action-adventure movie with an original score and more than 80 cast members. He filmed it over nine months in about 30 locations, including his school bus and the local jail — where a friend’s father worked — and premiered it in his school’s gym. His total cost was $130. Although dv does not have the resolution one would normally expect in a feature film release, it is more than adequate for broadcast, dvd, or online. It can even be tolerated on the large screen if you have a gripping story with fully developed characters to distract everyone from a less than perfect image. A 3-ccd dv camera costs in the $2,000 to $3,000 range to buy and about $100 per day or weekend to rent. A separate microphone is essential for recording on-camera dialog. With broadband Internet connections becoming more common, a DV camera, a microphone, a few friends, and a computer loaded with Adobe Premier® or Apple’s Final Cut Pro® can put you and your films in front of millions of people. A number of World Wide Web sites are springing up solely to provide a venue for independent filmmakers. One of the more reputable sites is AtomFilms (http://www.atomfilms.com). Also, check out the quantity seller program on Amazon (http://www.amazon.com). If you go this route, be sure you know what you are giving away in exchange for distribution, and be sure you have full rights to the film and all of its content.\n\n3 The Script The Blueprint It all starts with the script. Whether you wrote it or you have acquired it from someone else, the script is the blueprint for the final film, and as such, it is central to planning your film. It is important that the script be in a standard format so that you can accurately judge the amount of material to be filmed. Screenplays come in two basic formats: the master scene format (fig. 3.1) and the shooting script format (fig. 3.2). They are very similar except for a few important differences. Both examples show a page from The Anarchist Cookbook written by Jordan Susman. The master scene format of the screenplay is written for only one purpose, to sell itself. For that reason, it is written in a manner that is easy and quick to read. The writer wants the prospective buyer of his script to see the movie he is describing and not be too distracted by the process of reading. Each page of the script is numbered. Each scene begins with a slug line which is printed in all caps. The slug line tells the reader whether the scene is an interior or an exterior scene. This is done by the abbreviations “Int.” or “Ext.” at the beginning of the slug line. The slug line also tells where the scene takes place and the time of day. The first scene of the page shown in figure 3.1 takes place outside on the campus of Southwestern Baptist College in the early morning.

Library.” In this case, the time of day had not changed so the writer felt it was not necessary to repeat it. The large blocks of text describing the visuals and the action of the scene are called “Action.” Dialog is indented under the character’s name which is indented even further. The abbreviation “V.O.” stands for “voiceover” indicating that the speaking character is not seen, but only his or her voice is heard. The script is written in a 12-point Courier font with one-inch margins all around. This standardization of format and font help filmmakers judge how long the finished film will be and how long it will take to shoot. We will go into this in further detail later. For now, just remember that on average, one page of script equals one minute of screen time. Figure 3.2 shows the same page from the script after it had been modified into a shooting script format. To be useful, a shooting script needs to have its scenes numbered as in this example. This makes it easy to refer to any scene in the script and have everyone know which scene you are talking about. Also notice that a revision name is typed at the top of the page. When the script is changed for any reason, a new version of the revised page is issued on a different color of paper. Each revision is named for the color of paper that it is issued on. To help further identify what was changed on a revised page, an asterisk is printed in the right hand margin on each line that was changed. Figure 3.3 shows a revised page. Scene numbers are conserved in shooting scripts. This means that if a scene is omitted, a notation is written in the script that the scene has been omitted as shown in figure 3.3, and that scene number is never used in that script again. If a new scene is put in place of the one omitted, then a new number is created by appending a letter to the previous scene’s number as can be seen again in figure 3.3. This policy helps prevent confusion and costly mistakes. It should be noted here that a numbered scene in a shooting script is not the equivalent of a scene in a play. In a play, if the scene starts in the drawing room, that scene continues until the action is concluded and we leave the drawing room. In a film script, a new scene number and a new slug line can occur with a change of camera angle, point of view, or new visual emphasis while the action continues.\n\nWorking from a Master Scene Format Several years ago, I was hired by a television producer to do a shooting schedule and a budget for a television production of Tennessee Williams’s\n\n3 The Script 15 PINK Revision 44\n\n-\n\n5-8-01\n\n20.\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n44\n\nPUCK (VO) (CONT'D) Ground Zero for American anarchy.

After discussing what the approach to the film would be and at what cost level he wanted the budget, I asked if he had a copy of the shooting script that I could use to start working on. He said, “Of course,” reached into his desk and handed me a copy of the Penguin edition of A Street Car Named Desire.\n\n16 Part I The Basics\n\nTo understand why I was taken aback, you need to realize that a play and a film are two very different entities. A play takes place on a stage in front of a live audience. You can only change story location by changing the set, although this is done in very inventive ways in many play productions. A film is much more realistic in that when the story location changes, you actually change locations. You can be in the drawing room in one scene and at the South Pole in the next. This obviously has huge implications in budgeting and scheduling. For example, in Streetcar, the characters talk of being in a bowling alley. In a film version you might want to actually show them at the bowling alley — or you may not. The moment Stanley is outside the apartment yelling up to Stella is handled very cleverly in the play by a split set which shows the audience both Stanley on ground outside and Stella upstairs in the apartment. In a film, you would need to be Ext. The Apartment House and Street for Stanley’s shots, and Int. Stanley’s Apartment for Stella’s shots. In order to do the schedule and budget, I needed to make decisions that normally would be up to the screenwriter and ultimately the director. I decided to provide for going to the bowling alley and was pleased to see that they did exactly that in the finished film. Occasionally, you may find yourself needing to work from a master scene formatted script. Hopefully it will be a screenplay and not a play script. On these occasions, usually all that is required is to number the scenes. This means numbering each of the slug lines and shots. A “shot” looks like a slug line in that it is written in caps and flush left but without the Int./Ext. designation or the time of day. It usually indicates a new camera angle or focus. Some examples would be CLOSE ON a hand as it reaches for the knife. or A BLINDING FLASH all but obliterates the group of protestors. or INSERT the timer stops at “0:07!”\n\nBegin numbering the slug lines and shots starting at the number 1 and continue consecutively through the end of the script. Each of these numbers stands for a “scene” even though it may only be part of a larger continuing action. In a typical dramatic film, there might be 90 to 150 scenes. An action or special effects film may have well over 200 scenes.\n\n3 The Script 17\n\nChain of Title Whether you are working with your own script or one you have acquired, it is important to be able to demonstrate the Chain of Title. “Chain of Title” simply means being able to prove that you lawfully own the script. You do this through copyright registration. Although by law a work is copyrighted the minute it is written, it can be difficult to prove ownership without copyright registration with the U.S. Copyright Office. Before a distributor will take your film on, the distributor will want to see proof of copyright registration. Even the Screen Actors Guild will insist on a copy of the copyright form before they will let you sign their contract. Fortunately, it is very easy to register a script. To obtain the proper form, go to the Library of Congress web site at http://www.loc.gov and click on “U.S. Copyright Office.” Under “Publications,” click on “Forms.” Once you have the list of forms, choose “Form pa” or “Form pa w/instructions” to down load a PDF file of the form. As of this writing (2005), the fee to register a script is $30 in the form of a check or money order. Do not confuse this with registering the script with the Writers Guild of America. The wga provides a service in which they will hold a copy of your script in their files for five years, at which time you may choose to renew the registration. This service was first established for their members to serve as proof in disputes among the members of when a given script was written and by whom. They offer this service to nonmembers for a fee of $20. This registration is also a very simple process and can be accomplished in person at the WGAw headquarters building in Los Angeles or by mail at: WGAw, Intellectual Property Registry 7000 West Third St. Los Angeles, CA 90048\n\nAlternatively, the wga now allows you to register your script online at http://www.wga.org. The wga registration has no legal standing. It is not proof of ownership and does not establish Chain of Title. It merely documents the date at which time the completed script was in your possession. A copyright registration proves ownership. Be sure to retain a copy of the Form pa that you file with the U.S. Copyright Office, as it will be weeks or even months before you get the completed registration back by return mail.\n\nPart II The Schedule\n\n4 The Shooting Sequence What is a Shooting Sequence? In order to break down your film into those easily managed parts I mentioned, you need to understand the concept of the shooting sequence. When I first began teaching at USC, I found that none of the names in use for this construct were adequate. People often referred to it as a “scene” as in “We’re filming the ‘shoot-out’ scene tomorrow,” or “I’ve rewritten the heroine’s death scene.” As we have seen earlier, “scene” is a very vague term and can describe a continuous action that actually covers several numbered scenes in the script. If you have a phone call “scene,” you may actually be talking about a part of the script that cannot be shot in one location, especially if you are going to film both sides of the conversation. I realized I needed to come up with a new term. This term needed to describe a piece of the script that one would shoot in a specific place over a specific period. Sequence is also an overused and vague term so I settled on the term shooting sequence. A shooting sequence can consist of part of a scene, or a whole scene, or several scenes. It consists of continuous action that is to be filmed at one location, at one time, with specific characters. Think of the Greek unities of time, space, and action. To those three parameters, we will add cast. If any of the four parameters of time, space, action, or cast changes in a fundamental way, a new shooting sequence has begun.\n\n22 Part II The Schedule\n\nThe Four Unities The four unities of a shooting sequence (action, cast, time, and space) govern how each part of the script will be shot. This is why they define a shooting sequence. Unity of Action. It makes sense to stop filming a sequence once the main action of the sequence ends and a new action begins. It is a natural stopping point. At that point in the film, even if all the other unities stayed the same, the audience would expect a change in camera angle and the filmmaker would want a change in angle to signal the new direction. In a long complex scene taking place in one set over a continuous period of time with the same cast, a change in the action will give the filmmaker a convenient place to break the sequence. Unity of Cast. If you have a scene in which the cast substantially changes, you probably also have a change in the action. More to the point, it does not make sense to have called in a large number of cast members for the sequence, only to have half of them wait around, unused, and racking up overtime while the other half works. Such a sequence would be better scheduled as two separate shooting sequences, one for each group of cast. This does not mean that every time one character enters or leaves a scene a new shooting sequence starts. Unity of cast is broken when a substantial number of the cast members in a scene change. Unity of Time. If there is a time lapse at some point in a sequence, that is also a natural place to break the shooting sequence. A time lapse indicates that some aspects of the sequence have changed. Time is defined by change. Imagine a scene in a movie showing a nervous group of people hiding in a ruined building from a marauding band of terrorist bandits. The filmmaker does not want to make the audience sit through three days of boredom watching the cast grow evermore haggard. Instead, the filmmaker will cut the camera, and using makeup and costume changes, make the group appear in the next shot as though they have been there for a long time. This is not a sequence to be filmed all at once. It would naturally break. The new sequence would begin with the cast looking haggard. Unity of Space. It is important to understand that the unity of space applies to both story location and shooting location. A change in story location invariably requires a change in shooting location, even if it is only a move to the set next door. Nevertheless, a change in shooting location can occur even if there has been no change in story location. Any change in shooting location must break the shooting sequence since the filming would have to stop and not continue until the company arrived at the new location. A change in story location is a way of determining a change in\n\n4 The Shooting Sequence 23\n\nshooting location. Other indicators may be moving from exterior to interior (or vice versa); cutting between two nearby story locations that may or may not actually be near one another; and the incorporation of shots coming from different sources such as miniature units, visual effects shots, and second units.\n\nAnalyzing a Script Passage Read the following short sequence with the above discussion in mind. Using your imagination, visualize the film as you read. 11 INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY\n\n11\n\nSheriff Curry reclines in his chair, dozing with his feet on the desk. Howie barges into the office. HOWIE Sheriff! Sheriff! You got to come to the saloon real quick like! The Sheriff jerks awake and almost falls over backwards in his chair. SHERIFF CURRY Damn! Howie. Don’t you know how to knock? HOWIE Mean Jim’s in the saloon and he’s acting real ugly. SHERIFF CURRY Mean Jim’s back? He stands and buckles on his gun belt. SHERIFF CURRY Thanks, Howie. 12 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY\n\n12\n\nSheriff Curry strides down the street toward the saloon. Various townspeople watch him, concern etched into their eyes. The sheriff suddenly glances toward the sky. 13 SHERIFF’S POV\n\n13\n\nA buzzard glides noiselessly in a lazy circle. 14 BACK TO SCENE Sheriff Curry turns his attention to Newman’s Drygoods and finds the one pair of eyes he wishes weren’t watching him.\n\n14\n\n24 Part II The Schedule 15 HELEN,\n\n15\n\novercome with emotion, rushes inside her father’s store. 16 SHERIFF CURRY\n\n16\n\nclenches his jaw and continues on to the saloon. He strides up to the front of the saloon and shoves his way through the doors. 17 INT. SALOON - CONTINUOUS\n\n17\n\nThe normal hubbub ceases as soon as he enters. The only sound comes from the two saloon doors flapping to a standstill. The sheriff scans the room and finds his man leaning on the bar. 18 MEAN JIM\n\n18\n\nswallows a shot of whiskey, slams the glass down on the bar, and turns to face the sheriff. MEAN JIM You really know how to put a damper on a party, Sheriff. Sheriff Curry glides across the room toward Mean Jim, his eyes locked onto his quarry. SHERIFF CURRY I told you not to come back. Yeah?\n\nMEAN JIM I guess I got homesick.\n\n19 CLOSE ON MEAN JIM’S HAND which inches stealthily toward his gun. SHERIFF CURRY I’ll be taking your gun. MEAN JIM I don’t think so. Suddenly, Mean Jim’s gun is in his hand pointed right at the sheriff’s chest. The sheriff has grabbed the gun from the top around the cylinder. Mean Jim smiles. MEAN JIM This here’s a double action colt, Sheriff. Your’re a dead man. Mean Jim tries to pull the trigger but it won’t budge as long as Sheriff Curry keeps the cylinder from turning. The sheriff jerks down on the gun, wresting it from Mean Jim’s hand. He then smacks Mean Jim across the face with the gun. Mean Jim staggers back against the bar. The sheriff grabs him by the neck and hustles him out\n\n19\n\n4 The Shooting Sequence 25 through the doors into the street. Mean Jim collapses in the mud. MEAN JIM This ain’t over!\n\nHow many shooting sequences? If you are not sure, go back and read it again. Remember the continuity of time, space, action, and cast. Now let’s go through these scenes together. It’s a good idea to try to think how and where a particular scene will be shot. We start with Scene 11, Int. Sheriff ’s Office, with the sheriff suddenly awakened by Howie coming in the door. How and where would this be shot? Are we outside with Howie before he enters the Sheriff’s Office? The way that the scene is written indicates that we are with the sheriff and that we are surprised, along with him, when Howie interrupts his snooze. Therefore, you would assume that we are not outside the office with Howie. Why is this important? It is important because we need to know where we are going to shoot the scene. Let’s look at the possibilities: 1. We are shooting inside a real sheriff’s office in some remote 19th century western town. 2. We are shooting inside a “practical” set in a western town backlot or on location. 3. We are on a sound stage inside a Sheriff’s Office set. Of these three possibilities, which is most likely? I would put my money on number 3. Maintaining a film crew on location is expensive, and most backlot western streets do not have practical interiors that can be used without extensive work. Also, location filming offers much less control than filming on a stage set does. If you need to see the outside as the door opens and Howie enters, that can be accomplished by a scenic backing outside the door on the stage. This would make Scene 11 a complete shooting sequence within itself. It takes place in one place, it is continuous action over a continuous time, and it uses a specific group of cast: unity of time, place, action, and cast. Now imagine if Howie had been unable to wake the sheriff and left while muttering about sheriffs who sleep all day. Let’s say that the next scene was later in the day, but again, inside the Sheriff’s Office and Howie returned with 10 townspeople to help him wake the sheriff. Is this still part of the first shooting sequence where Howie tries to wake the sheriff? Look at the unities of time, place, action, and cast. Is it the same continuous time? No, it’s later in the day. Is it the same place? Yes, it’s in the Sheriff’s Office. Is it the same action? Yes, Howie is still trying to wake the sheriff.\n\n26 Part II The Schedule\n\nIs it the same cast? No, it involves another 10 people. Is it a new shooting sequence? Yes, it lacks unity of time and cast. Individuals can enter or leave a scene without affecting the unity of cast, but if you involve a completely new set of characters, that usually will break the unity of cast. In Scene 12, we are out on Main Street. The time is immediately after Scene 11; the place is Ext. Main Street; the action is the sheriff walking to the saloon; and the cast involves the sheriff, Helen, and several unnamed townspeople who will probably be played by extras. (We will discuss extras in more detail later.) Since we have broken the unity of place from Scene 11 (we have gone from interior to exterior), Scene 12 begins a new shooting sequence. Where does this shooting sequence end? We are Ext. Main Street through Scene 16, when the sheriff enters the saloon. Does this shooting sequence include all the scenes from Scene 12 through Scene 16? Consider each scene in turn. In Scene 12 we learn that several townspeople watch the sheriff with concern expressed in their faces. This will necessitate shots of those people watching him go by and looking appropriately concerned. Are those shots new shooting sequences? No. They are simply coverage of the ensuing action. The scene encompasses the whole street and everyone in it. The townspeople’s reaction to the sheriff can be conveniently combined with the shots on the sheriff himself. In addition, the townspeople will necessarily be in the background when we focus on the sheriff, so they will have to be present. And what do we make of the close-up of Helen? This again is coverage on the scene as a whole. Helen should be present even when we are focusing on the sheriff. It would make a great deal of sense to shoot her close-up along with the rest of the action. So, Scenes 12, 14, 15, and 16 would all appear to be part of the shooting sequence. Now look at Scene 13, the buzzard circling in the sky above Main Street. Isn’t this more coverage of the scene? To answer this question, we must think about how the shot will be accomplished. Will we show up at our western street location and hope a buzzard flies by? Only if we are extremely foolish. This shot will be accomplished in one of three ways: 1. Stock Shot – we will buy a shot of a buzzard in flight from a stock shot library; 2. Second Unit – we will dispatch a small 2nd unit (consisting of a camera operator and assistant) out into the dessert and tell them to find a buzzard and get the shot; 3. second Unit – we will use a slightly larger 2nd unit crew, rent a buzzard, hire a buzzard wrangler (animal handler), and have them go out and film the trained buzzard against the sky.\n\n4 The Shooting Sequence 27\n\nNotice that none of these choices includes the sheriff or any of the rest of our cast, or Main Street, or even the main shooting crew on the production. Each of these choices is from a source other than our main shooting unit thereby breaking the unity of space. In addition to lacking unity of cast and place with the surrounding scenes, Scene 13 lacks unity of time (it could be anytime) and action (the buzzard is circling overhead, not walking down Main Street). Scene 13 is definitely a shooting sequence unto itself. Note that the buzzard shooting sequence interrupts, and is in the middle of, the Main Street shooting sequence. Scene 17 takes us Int. Saloon. Even if the interior of the saloon exists on our Main Street location, it is always wise to separate interiors from exteriors. This allows us to schedule the interior separately from the exterior. Whether we shoot this set on location or on a stage, it is a separate shooting sequence. The action has changed. We are no longer walking to the saloon, we are in the saloon and confronting Mean Jim. The cast is very different. The only cast member in the saloon who also appears on Main Street is Sheriff Curry. Scene 18 focuses our attention and the camera on Mean Jim. However, note that there is action in Scene 18 that cannot be seen while we are focused on Mean Jim, namely Sheriff Curry’s movement toward Mean Jim at the bar. Technically, the writer should have created another shot that said 18A SHERIFF CURRY\n\n18A\n\nglides across the room…\n\nThe writer did not do this because he was not writing the script for our convenience. He was writing his script so that it would read easily and he probably felt the added shot was intrusive. Instead, he implied the shot by the way he focused the reader’s attention on the sheriff. Whether the shot is explicitly described or implicitly hinted at, it is still the same action (confronting Mean Jim), the same place (Int. Saloon), the same time (continuous from the action before), and the same cast (everyone inside the saloon). This shot is part of the ongoing shooting sequence. Scene 19 explicitly focuses our attention and the camera on Mean Jim’s hand as it inches closer to his six-shooter. This again is coverage and belongs with the greater shooting sequence we have been discussing. Again, the writer added much more to the action than just Mean Jim’s hand moving toward his pistol. There is a physical confrontation where the sheriff grabs the pistol, dialog where Mean Jim tells the sheriff he’s a dead man, the sheriff pistol whipping Mean Jim and throwing him out onto the street, and finally, Mean Jim’s line of dialog from the street. Obviously we\n\n28 Part II The Schedule\n\nare not just staring at Mean Jim’s hand during all of this. The writer has not broken this scene up, but we must. Everything up to the sheriff throwing Mean Jim through the saloon doors is still part of the Int. Saloon shooting sequence. However, once we move outside, we have broken the unity of space and need to start a new shooting sequence, even though the unity of time, action, and cast have not been broken. Typically, this transition from Int. Saloon to Ext. Main Street or Ext. Saloon would be handled with a cut. We would see the sheriff rushing Mean Jim toward the saloon doors and just as Mean Jim hit them, we would cut outside to see him bursting through the doors and landing in the street. These two shooting sequences would then be edited together to give the impression of continuous action. The exception to this would be if the director decided to have the camera follow Mean Jim through the doors and into the street. This could only be accomplished if the Int. Saloon set actually existed within the Ext. Saloon set on the Main Street location. In this instance, it could be argued that we have not broken the unity of space since one could actually walk from Int. Saloon to Ext. Main Street, and we have not started a new shooting sequence by going outside. In fact, under those circumstances, it could be argued that the material from when the sheriff first walks down Main Street through Mean Jim landing in the mud (except the shot on the buzzard) could all be one long shooting sequence. However, if we were to do that, we would be getting away from the reason to divide a script into shooting sequences, namely to create manageable parts. If you know with certainty, that the director wants to follow Mean Jim through the doors and that you have a location or set that physically allows that action, then by all means, add Mean Jim landing in the street to the Int. Saloon shooting sequence. Even under those circumstances, I still would not recommend adding the Main Street shots prior to the Int. Saloon since that would be a rather unwieldy shooting sequence which does break the unity of cast. Normally, at the early stages of planning, you would not know if the director wants to shoot the scene in that way, nor would you know if you had a location that would permit it. It is therefore usually safer to split the scene into interior and exterior shooting sequences. If you later find that you will be following Mean Jim through the doors, then you can schedule the two shooting sequences side by side. So how many shooting sequences are in this short piece of script? Five: (1) Int. Sheriff ’s Office, (2) Ext. Main Street, (3) Ext. Sky (buzzard), (4) Int. Saloon, and (5) Ext. Main Street & Saloon. I have described these shooting sequences by the set in which they take place. There are probably other Ext. Main Street shooting sequences elsewhere in this\n\n4 The Shooting Sequence 29\n\nscript. To fully describe a shooting sequence you would need to include other information such as the action, cast, and time of day, or in other words, include the other three of the four shooting sequence unities. We will be doing exactly that in our discussion of breakdown pages.\n\nProblem Situations There are a number of problematic situations in which it is easy to become confused as to where a shooting sequence begins or ends, or what it includes. It is usually best, as we did above, to think how the sequence will be filmed and where. Ask yourself, where will the camera be, and what will it see? Let’s look at a few examples.\n\nInt. / Ext. As stated earlier, it is always best to separate interiors from exteriors, making them separate shooting sequences. They usually indicate a change in shooting location. Interiors require different lighting, different film stocks, and different conditions under which they can be shot. For example, if you see some characters enter a building, they then have a scene inside the building, and then they exit the building and drive away in a car, it would be best to split the exterior scenes from the interior scene. It might even make a great deal of sense to split the two exterior scenes apart and make them separate shooting sequences since there would be a period of time between when the characters entered the building, when they exit, and when they drive away (unity of time). In doing this, one would be able to shoot the two exterior sequences early in the day while there was plenty of sunlight, and then move inside to shoot the interior sequence where the lack of sunlight would not be a hindrance. A more complicated situation is the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet. In Shakespeare’s play, Juliet is on her balcony, Romeo in the garden below, and Juliet’s nurse is inside Juliet’s bedroom. Let’s say that we are filming this scene, we have built a set on a soundstage of Juliet’s bedroom, and we are using an actual location for the exterior of the house and garden. The location has a balcony at the end of a hallway that we will use for Juliet’s balcony. What shooting sequences will we have? Imagine where the camera will be, and what it will see. Romeo is standing in the garden, so all of his shots must be on location. Romeo’s pov (point of view) of Juliet must also be on location since the camera will be in the garden and will be see-\n\n30 Part II The Schedule\n\ning the exterior of the Capulet house. The Nurse’s shots must be on our stage set since that is the only place the bedroom exists. What if the Nurse spies Romeo through the bedroom window? Where would her pov of Romeo from inside the bedroom be shot? It would have to be on location since Romeo is in the garden, not in the bedroom. The shot would most likely be made from a platform at the height of the bedroom, shooting through a window unit which matched the window units in the set. So in this situation, there would be two shooting sequences: (1) Int. Juliet’s Bedroom, and (2) Ext. Capulet House – Balcony & Garden.\n\nVehicles Vehicles provide a special case in that even if you are inside a vehicle, you see what is outside the vehicle. Shooting inside and outside of a stationary vehicle is equivalent to being outside. You might as well make such scenes all one shooting sequence and not differentiate between interior and exterior. If the camera is inside the vehicle, we will see outside, and if the camera is outside the vehicle, we can certainly see inside. For this reason, vehicle interiors shot on location should be considered exterior shots. A moving vehicle presents a slightly more complicated situation. Often in the past, the interior of a moving vehicle was shot on a soundstage against a projected moving background while the exterior shots of the vehicle zooming by were done on location. These exterior shots are known as run-bys. In a situation such as this, it makes sense to separate the interior moving vehicle shots from the exterior moving vehicle shots. Even if the interior moving vehicle shots are done on location, the exterior run-bys may be done by a separate unit such as a second unit or stunt unit. If they are not done by a separate unit, they will probably be done at a separate time by the main unit. Rigging a vehicle with mounted cameras and lights takes a great deal of time, and the main unit would want to shoot all of the interior vehicle shots together once they were rigged for it. Because of this, you should separate exterior moving vehicle shots from the interior shots, yet still treat the interiors as exteriors.\n\nDay/Night Imagine a foreign legionnaire trekking endlessly through the trackless desert. He treks and treks and treks. Day becomes night, night becomes day. Is all of this one Desert Trekking shooting sequence? How do the unities\n\n4 The Shooting Sequence 31\n\napply? We cannot tell where he is since in this trackless desert every place looks like every other place. The unity of space is maintained. He is monotonously trekking. The unity of action is maintained. The unity of cast is maintained since we only see our hapless legionnaire. But, at the very least, you will need to shoot some of it in daylight and some of it at night. The unity of time is broken. Therefore, you will have, at minimum, two shooting sequences: the Day Trekking sequence and the Night Trekking sequence. These two sequences can then be cut up to appear like two weeks or more of endless trekking if the editor and director desire since nothing else is changing.\n\nLapse of Time The passage of time can be subtle. How much time must pass before we have broken the unity of time? In the 1960s and the 1970s, a number of avant-garde filmmakers, such as Andy Warhol, were making films in which they set up a camera and kept it running continuously for extended periods, pausing only to change film magazines. Twenty-four hours of the Empire State Building is one long, incredibly boring shooting sequence. But what about the unities? Let’s examine them. The unity of space is preserved in the extreme. The camera never moves. The unity of action is preserved since there is none. There are only people coming and going. The unity of cast is preserved since there are no particular people coming and going, just a faceless mass. But what about the unity of time? First it is day and then it is night, just like the Desert Trekking sequence. In the Desert Trekking sequence, we were not actually going to have our actor playing the legionnaire walk through the desert for thirty-six hours and follow along, pausing only to change magazines. We needed to create a schedule that normal human beings would be willing to work. No one wants to work thirty-six or even twenty-four hours straight, and if they did, it would be prohibitively expensive. In Twenty-four Hours of the Empire State Building, they did shoot for twenty-four hours. Therefore, the unity of time was not broken. So how much time must pass? The answer often depends on the unity of action. High Noon, starring Gary Cooper, preserves the unity of time. Throughout its 85 minute length, screen time equals real time. What separates this story into shooting sequences is the breaking of the unities of action and space. Gary Cooper’s character moves through the town, unsuccessfully trying to convince first this person and then that person to help him fight the evil killers who will be coming to exact their revenge.\n\n32 Part II The Schedule\n\nSometimes the shooting sequences can be defined by parameters which have nothing to do with the story. Alfred Hitchcock’s film, Rope, is another film where screen time equals real time. The film was designed to appear as if the camera never cut. Actually, the camera did cut at the end of each thousand-foot reel (approximately every ten to eleven minutes), and the cuts were disguised by various means such as having someone’s dark jacket fill the screen. This film was made up of eight ten-minute shooting sequences defined by the amount of film a camera magazine could hold at one time. In Twelve Angry Men, Sleuth, and ‘Night Mother, the unity of cast and space are preserved. The shooting sequences are defined by the action. All of these films take place in a small defined space: a jury room in the first, an apartment in the second, and a house in the third. Also, each has a small defined cast which is essentially present throughout the film, although Twelve Angry Men at times has a subset of the cast on the screen by themselves. In all of these films, the time that passes can be separated into shooting sequences by the action that is taking place. Each film is made up of discreet movements that propel the story forward. By analyzing how a film is to be shot and understanding how the story is structured, even extreme examples can be broken into shooting sequences.\n\nVisual Effects Elements Consider the following snippet of script. 74 INT. COCKPIT OF THE SPACESCOUT RANGER – DAY\n\n74\n\nCmdr. Egan fights to bring the craft under control after the devastating explosion. Lt. Harley raises her arm and points. LT. HARLEY Commander! Cmdr. Egan follows her pointing finger out the forward viewport. A lifeless JACK SIMMONS smashes into the thick screen and bounces off into space spinning madly.\n\nHow many shooting sequences? As always, it really depends on how it will be shot. If you can really go out into space and have some actor float by and collide with the viewport, it would be just one. The camera would be inside the ship and would film the action as described. However, it\n\n4 The Shooting Sequence 33\n\nseems it will be a few years before we can do this sort of thing, so next we need to consider visual effects. Visual effects influence shooting sequences by how the various elements are supplied. The action inside the cockpit of the ship is straightforward. It would be shot in a set on a soundstage. Out the window, or viewport, would be a blue screen. A blue screen can be easily removed from the frame either optically or on a computer and replaced by another shot. The filmmakers could put whatever they wanted outside that window, from a swirling black hole to an undersea coral reef, or even the courtyard at Windsor Castle. How we come up with that element outside the window is going to determine the shooting sequences. In the current example, we would hang the actor playing Jack Simmons in a harness that would allow him to spin and tumble in front of another blue screen, and we would then swing him toward a camera shooting behind a transparent barrier. We would bounce him off the barrier and swing him away from camera as though he were tumbling out into space. Next we would have a matte artist come up with a background that we could put behind him showing the cold limitless reaches of space. These three elements, the live action in the cockpit, the shot of Jack hanging in space, and the space background would then be composited together to create the shot described in the script. How many sequences? At least three: (1) Int. Cockpit, (2) Ext. Space (Jack floating around), and (3) the background produced by the matte artist. Each of these sequences will have to be accounted for in the schedule. At one point in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Indy is high up on a cliff. We are looking down on him from above. Far below him we see crocodiles swimming in the river. I’m not sure why the crocodiles were necessary; to paraphrase the line from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, “Hell, the fall would kill him.” How many shooting sequences? Did the filmmakers actually dangle Harrison Ford over a crocodile infested river? I think not. So there would be probably three shooting sequences: (1) Harrison Ford on a nice safe soundstage dangling over a blue screen, (2) Ext. Cliff looking down on a river for the background, and maybe (3) Crocodiles created by a visual effects company to be inserted into the background shot. Low-budget films rarely have the luxury of dealing with $100,000 visual effect shots, but even low-tech films can have shooting sequences required by visual effects. In Robin Hood: Men in Tights, there is a scene toward the end of the film where Robin is dueling with the Sheriff of Nottingham while Maid Marian lies restrained and helpless nearby. At one point in the duel, the Sheriff’s blade snags a cord around Robin’s\n\n34 Part II The Schedule\n\nneck, cutting the cord, and sending a locket it supported flying up into the air. The locket hits a stone archway, explodes into a million shimmering golden pieces and releases a key. The key tumbles through the air in slow motion and ultimately lands in the lock of Maid Marian’s chastity belt. The budget for this film did not allow any high-tech computer visual effects. A 2nd unit was organized to shoot a sequence which started with the locket flying through the air, and ended with the key landing in the padlock on the chastity belt. That was a shooting sequence within the dueling shooting sequence, and it needed to be scheduled separately from the rest of the scene. (See the appendix to read how the shot was done.) How did the unities apply? Time: the unity of time was preserved in that the sequence was contiguous with what went before. Space: the unity of space was broken in that a specially modified set was required to make the effect work. Action: the unity of action was preserved since the locket was flying into the air as a direct result of the duel. Cast: the unity of cast was broken since we used a photo double for Maid Marian (those are not Amy Yasbek’s hips, she was needed elsewhere during the filming of this shot), and Robin and the Sheriff were not required at all.\n\nOverlapping Shooting Sequences There are instances where a shooting sequence can be laid right on top of another shooting sequence. Do not confuse this with sequences such as the buzzard sequence mentioned previously. The buzzard sequence is inserted into the Main Street sequence, not laid on top of it. Scene 13 will not be filmed when the shooting company is at the Main Street location. To be more explicit, you could physically cut Scene 13 out of the scripts of the cast and crew, and they would not need it while they were shooting the Main Street sequence. Overlapping shooting sequences happen mainly in two dramatic constructs: phone calls and when there is a film within the film. In these situations, the same part of the script page is filmed in two separate locations. This will become clearer as we examine specific cases.\n\nPhone Calls Phones are ubiquitous in movies. Often a scene goes something like this: a phone rings, a character answers it and mumbles something back, hangs up, and says something like, “They’re at the old warehouse. Let’s go.” That’s\n\n4 The Shooting Sequence 35\n\na very simple shooting sequence. We are seeing only one side of the conversation. When both sides of the conversation must be filmed, it gets trickier. We have all witnessed something like the following scene in a movie: 32 INT. VANDERLING’S LIVING ROOM – NIGHT\n\n32\n\nMr. and Mrs. Vanderling sit together on the couch, obviously distraught. A dozen uniformed policemen and several detectives swarm through the house. The phone RINGS. The Vanderlings look at each other and then at Detective Winston. He nods to them to pick up the phone. As Mr. Vanderling picks the phone up, Detective Winston picks up an extension at the same time. MR. VANDERLING Hello? 33 INTERCUT\n\n33\n\nJoey, in a phone booth in a seedy part of town. JOEY Listen carefully, dude. Bring the money ALONE to the east end of the 6th street bridge. Come alone, dude, or the kid’s history. You understand? MR. VANDERLING I...I want to talk to my daughter. JOEY You’ll talk to her when I get the money. MR. VANDERLING I won’t come unless I can talk to my daughter. Detective Winston nods his approval to Mr. Vanderling. JOEY Don’t push me, dude. Joey lowers the receiver down to Jessica, held firmly at his side. JOEY Say something, kid. JESSICA Daddy? MR. VANDERLING Jessica? Joey takes the receiver back.\n\n36 Part II The Schedule JOEY You got two hours, dude. He hangs up. 34 INT. VANDERLING’S LIVING ROOM – CONTINUOUS\n\n34\n\nMr. Vanderling slowly lowers the phone. DETECTIVE WINSTON We’ll have the bridge surrounded. He won’t get away.\n\nScenes 32 and 34 are easy. That’s a shooting sequence shot in the Int. Vanderling Living Room, which preserves all four unities. However, Scene 33 is somewhat different. First, where is it? Is it in the Living Room or the Phone Booth? And what does the writer mean by Intercut? Scene 33 is in both the Living Room and the Phone Booth. Intercut means that the editor will be cutting between the two sets as he or she sees fit. We will not know in which set any specific part of the phone conversation will be seen. What does this mean to us as the filmmakers? It means that we will need to shoot all of Scene 33 in both locations. Why would we not just film each person saying his lines? Because it might be more interesting seeing the other person listen. When Jessica screams out “Daddy?” the editor may think it’s better to see the effect his little girl’s voice has on Mr. Vanderling. Each side of the phone conversation must be filmed completely. We have two shooting sequences: (1) Int. Vanderling’s Living Room consisting of Scenes 32, 33pt., and 34; and (2) Int. Phone Booth consisting of Scene 33pt. (The abbreviation for part of a scene is pt. and it means that Scene 33 will appear in more than one shooting sequence.) Both of these shooting sequences occupy some of the same real estate on the script page but the unity of space is broken because they take place in two different locations. A similar situation occurs when a movie has a film within the film: 43 INT. VANDERLING STUDY – NIGHT Mr. Vanderling pours himself a scotch and sits down at his desk. He picks up the remote and clicks on the TV and the tape player. Jessica’s happy smiling face beams out from the screen. MRS. VANDERLING (O.S.) How old are you today, Jessica? Jessica holds up three fingers. Mr. Vanderling swoops into the video frame, and picks his daughter up and spins around with her.\n\n43\n\n4 The Shooting Sequence 37 MR. VANDERLING (ON TAPE) That’s my girl! At his desk, Mr. Vanderling drinks his scotch while the tears roll down his face. MR. VANDERLING (ON TAPE) That’s my girl! Mr. Vanderling turns off the video and buries his face in his arms on his desk sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nThis should be simple. Mr. Vanderling is sitting in his study watching a video of himself and his daughter. However, you need to film the video also. Therefore we have two shooting sequences occupying the space of one scene on the page: (1) Int. Study, Scene 43pt; and (2) Ext. Backyard Party, Scene 43pt. These two shooting sequences break all four unities. The unity of time is broken because the two sequences obviously take place at different times. The unity of space is broken because one sequence is in the Study and the other one is in the Backyard. The unity of action is broken because in one sequence Mr. Vanderling is pining over his missing daughter, and in the other sequence, he is playing with that same daughter. Finally, the unity of cast is broken because Mr. Vanderling is in the Study alone, but in the Backyard, he is with his daughter.\n\nCreative Geography Sometimes a scene can be split into two shooting sequences merely because the geography of the scene does not exist. It must be created. In essence, this breaks the unity of space in a scene in which that unity appears to be preserved. Let’s consider the following scenario. Two men sit at a sidewalk café, observing the front of a hotel directly across the street. They are watching two detectives standing in front of the hotel. There is dialog between the two detectives, and there is dialog between the two men watching the detectives. In addition, the director wants to shoot a shot of the front of the hotel with the two men sitting at the sidewalk café in the foreground (fig. 4.2). You find you have only one problem. Nowhere within a hundred miles can you find this location. You can find hotels and you can find sidewalk cafés, but nowhere can you find a sidewalk café directly across the street from a hotel. Shot C in figure 4.1 can be achieved only by creating a geography that does not exist. First, you would film the two men at the sidewalk café, angling your shots so that the café is in the background (fig. 4.1 shots a and b). Once\n\n38 Part II The Schedule Hotel xx\n\nD\n\nA x\n\nB x\n\nC Café Fig. 4.1. A plan of the shots needed of two men at a sidewalk café watching two other men across the street standing in front of a hotel. The hotel and café do not exist in this relationship to each other and the location must be created filmically. The actors are marked by Xs and the camera angles are marked by Vs. The open end of the Vs point toward what the camera sees.\n\nthose shots are completed, you wrap that location and move to a hotel across town that has been selected. You stage the dialog between the two detectives in front of the hotel (fig. 4.1 shot d), keeping the hotel’s facade in the background. In order to tie the two locations together, you then put tables on the sidewalk across the street from the hotel, seat your two men there, and shoot over them toward the detectives in front of the hotel (fig. 4.1, shot c, and fig. 4.2). By doing this, you have overcome a disunity of space to make it appear as though there is none, but you nevertheless have had to shoot two shooting sequences to make that one scene. A similar situation occurred in the making of Hollow Man, directed by Paul Verhoeven. There is a scene early on in that film where a group of scientists led by Sebastian (Kevin Bacon), are celebrating in one of the finer restaurants of Washington, D.C. Thereafter, Linda (Elizabeth Shue), realizes that Sebastian has left the table and gets up to find him. She ambles out onto the restaurant’s balcony and sees him at the railing with the U.S. Capitol building glowing in the background. This geography does not exist. The interior of the restaurant was filmed in a very fine restaurant located on the ground floor of a Washington hotel. The balcony was filmed on the roof of the U.S. Department of Labor building which is in close proximity to the U.S. Capitol building. Elements of the restaurant, including the doorway, were duplicated on the roof location in order to\n\n4 The Shooting Sequence 39\n\nFig. 4.2. Shot C from fig. 4.1. This relationship of the café to the hotel exists only in the filmmaker’s mind.\n\nsmooth the transition from one location to the other and to enhance the illusion of the space being continuous. It was not known at the time of the first breakdown of the Hollow Man script that the restaurant described did not exist. However, the restaurant scenes were broken into two shooting sequences anyway since, in moving onto the balcony, the unity of space and the unity of cast were broken. Although some of the above examples are extreme, they are not unusual. When confronted with complex situations, always go back to the basic rule. Whenever any of the four unities are broken, it’s a good indication that the last shooting sequence has ended and a new one has begun. Being able to break a script into its shooting sequences is the key to managing its complexity.\n\n5 The Production Board 1 Shooting Sequence = 1 Strip\n\nchist\n\nCook\n\nbook\n\nAnar\n\nThe\n\nman Sus dan or: Jor man Sus Direct wn, er: Bro ck duc n Ma Pro Bria ector: t.

The information regarding each shooting sequence in the script is written on a cardboard strip, and then the strip is placed on the board. A production board is an organizing and sorting tool. It allows you to display each shooting sequence independently of all the others, and to sort all of the shooting sequences into a coherent and efficient shooting schedule.\n\nFig. 5.1. A production board in the process of being assembled.\n\n42 Part II The Schedule\n\nThe components of the production board consists of the board itself, a header, and various cardboard strips (fig. 5.2). The board serves to hold the header and strips securely in any given order. Boards come in various sizes that are designated by the length in inches of the strips that they are designed to carry. Standard sizes of production boards used over the past several decades from oldest to newest are 18 inches, 15 inches, 14 inches, and 11 inches. These strip lengths were based on the size of the paper that was used to manufacture the strips. In more recent developments, the 14 and 11-inch boards were based on using legal and letter size paper respectively, since these boards are printed out by computerized scheduling programs.\n\nThe Header The header board (fig. 5.2a) acts as a key to the production board and determines the order of the information presented on the strips. The order and information that is called for at the top of the header board can vary, but typically, it will list the strip number, whether the shooting sequence is day or night, and the length in pages of the shooting sequence. Below the upper segment is an information block in which the title of the picture and often the director, producer, assistant director, and script date are listed. Below this general information is a list of the cast. Notice that the cast list has had to be doubled up to conserve space. In doing so, the numbers printed on the board have had to be revised. Other needed elements such as extras, stunt players, vehicles, and anything else a filmmaker may want to track, including various makeup states or hair length, ­may be tracked on the board. Usually, it is desirable to track anything that might impact scheduling. In the first incarnation of the Santa Clause 2 script, the character played by Tim Allen (Scott) was seen in various stages while transforming from Santa to a normal human being. His makeup changed progressively throughout the picture. Switching him from one makeup change to another would take hours, so the filmmakers tried to schedule scenes with the same look on the same day. For that reason, it made sense to track the makeup changes on the production board (fig. 5.3).\n\nThe Strips The first thing you may notice when examining the strips on a production board is that the strips are in many different colors.

A typical color scheme might be: white for interior stage day, light blue for interior stage night, yellow for exterior day, darker blue for exterior night, tan for interior location day, green for interior location night. Other colors can be used to designate special shooting sequences such as visual effects elements or second units. Starting at the top of the strip shown in figure 5.2b, we see that this strip was created from breakdown sheet #174. (The strip number and the breakdown sheet number are the same.) The shooting sequence represented by this strip takes place in the daytime and it occupies 5/8 of a script page. If you cock your head to the left, you can read the set and scene numbers. The set is Int. Son of Sam - Living Room, and the scene number making up the shooting sequence is Scene 219. In the lined area below the set, the numbers of the appropriate cast are entered aligned with each cast member’s line on the header board. If it is necessary to enter two cast members who occupy the same line, such as Mrs. Gold and Truck Driver, then the second number is put in the next space below the first number. In this sequence, we will need the parts of Puck, Johnny Black, Milo, Rich, and Dale. Below the cast are entered the other items that are being tracked on the board; in this instance, the extras. There will be 18 extras or background players working in this sequence. At the very bottom of the strip, written vertically from bottom to top, is a brief but unique description of the action of the shooting sequence. We will discuss this in more detail when we cover the breakdown pages in Chapter 7.\n\n5 The Production Board 45\n\nThe Day Markers The day marker strips (fig. 5.2c) are black with a white space on which the day number, date, and total page count for the day can be written. Think of the day markers as end-of-day markers. They are placed to the right of the work for that day.\n\nBanners Banners are informational strips (fig. 5.2d, e, f, & g). Four different types of banners are shown in the illustration. Figure 5.2d is an end-of-week banner. End-of-week-banners are especially useful in longer shooting schedules. If you see that a piece of equipment must be used from week two through week five, you know that it will be needed for four weeks without having to count the weeks on the board. Figure 5.2e shows a company-move banner. It is important that the crewmembers know if a midday move is planned so that they are able to have the trucks packed and ready. Figure 5.2f is an end-of-principal-photography banner. The end of the main shooting period is an important time in the making of a film since many contracts will reference the end of principal photography in outlining terms of an agreement or contract. Figure 5.2g shows a banner that would preceed a section of the board devoted to stock footage (footage that will be bought from a library and not shot by the production company). Other board divisions that might be announced by a banner would be second unit shots, visual effects shots, and omitted scenes. Banners are usually made by writing the information on the plain white backside of a strip.\n\nThe Next Step I have given this brief introduction to the production board to help clarify the reasons for what follows next. As we go through the lining of the script and the making of the breakdown sheets, keep in mind where we are headed. It’s all necessary in order to make an accurate and complete production board. Now that you know our destination, let’s look at how we get there.\n\n6 Lining the Script Where to start? The first thing you must do when you are given a new script to breakdown is to fnd a comfortable chair, sit down, and read it from beginning to end. As you allow yourself to be transported into the story, it is important to visualize the movie that is being described. In the process, you will also start to learn the writer’s style and perhaps get a sense of the style of the picture as well. During this initial read, try not to worry about shooting sequences and mechanics. Just enjoy the story. If there are parts of the script that are confusing or that are unclear, make a quick note and try to get clarification from the director or writer later. Above all, it is important that you understand what happens in the story. Next, determine if you have a shooting script or not. Are the scenes numbered? If not, start at the first slug line and number all the scene headings and shots from the beginning to the end. As mentioned in chapter 3, the slug line is the line written in all caps that introduces each scene. If you are numbering the script, be sure that your numbers are communicated to whoever is distributing the scripts so that all the scripts can be number the same as yours. When you refer to Scene 27, you want to know that everyone else’s Scene 27 is the same as yours. The best and quickest way to number the scenes is to do it in the scriptwriting program in which the script was composed. The two leading scriptwriting programs, Final Draft® and Movie Magic Screenwriter®, each have a function to number the scenes. Once the scenes are numbered in the scriptwriting program, the script is\n\n48 Part II The Schedule\n\nlocked, meaning that any further changes to the script will be highlighted and the page that they occur on will be marked as a revised page. If this is not done and the script is revised without the changes being marked, most of what you are about to do will have to be redone. Once you have a numbered script, get yourself a pencil, a ruler, and a set of highlighter markers. Remove the brads holding the script together and either place it unbound on your desk or put it into a three-ring binder that will open flat. My preference is to use a three-ring binder so that I will not misplace any pages. You want it free of the brads so that you are not fighting to keep the script open and you are able to place the ruler flat across the open page.\n\nThe Point of Lining the Script Your goal at this stage is two-fold. You want to divide the script into shooting sequences, and you want to highlight all important elements in each sequence. What are the important elements? They would be cast, extras, vehicles, animals, props, special effects, visual effects, special makeup, notes about the set, lighting changes, costumes, and anything necessary to the filming of the sequence and which might affect the budget and/or the schedule. It is not necessary to make exhaustive lists of set dressing and props at this point. Your set decorator and your propmaster will do that. The elements that you want to highlight are the ones which are necessary to shooting the sequence and/or which are mentioned or inferred by the script. For example, in a shooting sequence set in a bar, it is understood that there will be tables, chairs, liquor bottles, barstools, and glasses, so it is not necessary to note these items. However, you should note the breakaway barstool that one character uses to smash the head of another since that is an unusual item and is necessary to film that particular scene. In highlighting these elements, it is useful to color code them.\n\nHighlighter Colors – Keep It Simple After leaving graduate film school, I lined my first script and made my first production board under the tutelage of Howard Kazanjian, an assistant director at the time, who later went on to produce Return of the Jedi and Raiders of the Lost Ark, among other films. I could not have had a finer teacher. Howard was known for his careful and accurate breakdowns,\n\n6 Lining the Script 49\n\nand his fine, artistic production boards. His production boards were such works of art with their skillful use of color and their neat, legible, handwritten strips, that the studio executives would leave them hanging on the wall long after the pictures were complete. They were a pleasure to look at and to use. Howard had a scheme of colors that he used when lining a script that gave each element a specific color depending on which category it belonged. For example, he might highlight each actor in red, extras in pink, special effects in blue, props in green, etc. You could look at any shooting sequence in a script that he had lined and see immediately what elements were required. When I began to breakdown large and complex scripts, I found I was spending most of my time removing and replacing the caps on the fist full of markers in my hand. I needed to come up with a more streamlined system, so I settled on a scheme that used only two colors: a warm color such as pink, red, or orange for all people (cast and extras), and a cool color such as blue or green for everything else. This made my marker maintenance more manageable without diminishing the value of the system. Normally, a highlighted item is self-evident as to which category it belongs. If there is any ambiguity, a quick note penciled in the margin will make it clear.\n\nLining Off Shooting Sequences In lining the shooting sequences, you need to draw a line across the page at the beginning and end of each shooting sequence (see figs. 6.1 and 6.2). Use solid lines to separate shooting sequences. Solid lines are always used except for a very specific instance that we will address below, under the section on overlapping shooting sequences. I use a ruler and a pencil. The ruler is a hold over from my training under Howard Kazanjian. It is important to keep the script neat and legible. Use pencil so that if you change your mind about a line you have drawn, you can erase it completely. If a sequence ends at the bottom of a page, draw a line at the bottom of the page and at the top of the next page. That way, you don’t have to waste time paging back and forth to see whether or not a sequence continues from a previous page. If there is a line at the top of the page, then that is where the sequence begins. Remember that shooting sequences begin and end with the breaking of at least one of the four shooting sequence unities: time, space, action, and cast. If you encounter omitted scenes, ignore them. Do not line them off; do not cross them out. Just pretend that they don’t exist.\n\n50 Part II The Schedule\n\nWHITE Revision\n\n-\n\n5-1-01\n\n1.\n\n1 EXT SOUTHWESTERN BAPTIST COLLEGE - EARLY MORNING\n\n1\n\nA mist hovers over the grassy knolls of the serene campus.
