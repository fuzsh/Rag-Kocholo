        "text": "Last week, Zach Braff started a Kickstarter campaign for a new movie, “Wish I Was Here,” a planned follow-up to the 2004 film “Garden State,” which he wrote, directed, and starred in. Braff also compiled the “Garden State” soundtrack, arguably the backbone of the story. Natalie Portman, in full manic-pixie-dream-girl mode, passes him headphones and says, “You gotta hear this one song. It’ll change your life, I swear,” and the two strike up romance to the Shins’ mellow crooning. Braff cast himself as an aloof twenty-something in the mold of Benjamin Braddock, but with the passivity of a roll of wallpaper—which he literally blends into, in a signature shot. In the decade since the release of “Garden State,” the Internet has established itself as the kind of place where an unknown can become a sensation, and a celebrity—just another I.P. address in the crowd—can convincingly play the part of a budding artist. At the end of Braff’s Kickstarter video, he pleads, “Please help me make another movie for you like ‘Garden State,’ with no compromises.”\n\nThe “Garden State” soundtrack sold more than 1.3 million copies; the movie, which cost about 2.5 million dollars to produce, grossed 35.8 million dollars worldwide. This time around, going the crowdsourcing route, Braff asked for two million dollars, with the promise of perks such as “Voice Greeting: fifteen seconds of me saying whatever you want,” and tickets to sit beside him at the première “with or without my hand resting gently on your leg.” The pledge for ten thousand dollars, which rewards one patron with a speaking role, was snatched up within the campaign’s first several hours. The project surpassed its fundraising goal in three days, backed by about twenty-eight thousand people and counting.\n\nAs a celebrity with industry connections, the thirty-eight-year-old millionaire runs counter to the ordinary Kickstarter user—ambitious creative seeking start-up cash. Braff got the idea from another high-profile Kickstarter fundraising campaign, for a “Veronica Mars” movie, which fans of the cult TV darling pounced on despite the fine print: “All funds will go into a Veronica Mars Movie Project production account which has been set up by Warner Bros. on our behalf.” Braff explained to his prospective backers, “I was about to sign a typical financing deal in order to get the money,” but he wanted to make his pitch to the people of the Internet, because the alternative “would have involved making a lot of sacrifices I think would have ultimately hurt the film.”\n\n“Wish I Was Here” operates on two levels of nostalgia: turning the movie into a cause—these shared, stale memories will seem fresher if we band together to reheat them—and the plot itself, which Braff lightly outlines on Kickstarter. The main character, “a struggling actor, father and husband, who at 35 is still trying to find his identity,” revisits his childhood fantasy of being “a futuristic Space-Knight” assisted by “a flying robotic-squire.” Played by Braff, the role would revive his successful-actor-as-floundering-actor turn in “Garden State,” and, fittingly, would revert further back into the territory of memory, by becoming the superhero figure dreamed up by his younger self.\n\nIn the campaign page’s comments, admirers tossed in words of support that affirm the movie’s particular sentimental pull. “Garden State helped shape me as a child, I’m happy to give back,” wrote in David Sisto; said Thomas Tarbox, “I can’t begin to tell you the influence that Garden state had to this 15 year old really depressed kid. Now at 24 I have looked over my adult years and found such a resemblance to the journey that Largman had to make and feel almost that my life has mirrored it. Now I get the chance to be a part of the next Zack [sic] Braff venture and feel truly honored.” For every devotee, there is a return to the past—a sense that the movie stands apart from his or her evolving tastes and fits into a separate category, where the relics of growing up are kept.\n\nBut as fast as the money arrived, so did the backlash on Twitter (“ ‘Don’t give your change to me, give it to Zach Braff’- The last three homeless people I walked by”) and elsewhere: the comedian Tim Heidecker scripted a prank-page of the movie, which was swiftly produced. Braff defended himself against the detractors, saying, “People seem to think I have Oprah Winfrey money. I’ve done well in my career, but I am not sitting on twenty-two million dollars,” and assuring, “It’s important to note I’m putting some of my own money into this endeavor as well. I was prepared to, worst-case scenario, do it at the most minimal budget possible.” How much, he couldn’t say.\n\nThe cynicism is also spurred by the belief that “Garden State” has not aged well—or at least, it does not live up to the memory of having seen it for the first time. The summer when “Garden State” came to my home-town theatre, in New Jersey, I was fifteen, working at a children’s gift shop called “P.S. I Love You,” and staring blankly into space for hours on end—just as Braff does for much of the film. I remember sitting quietly as the movie ended, letting its profundity wash over me. Ten years passed; I watched “Garden State” again, and it was like paging through an old yearbook, enduring the humorless soul-searching, the emphatic quirkiness, and, in particular, such a precious depiction of New Jersey. My fondness for “Garden State” is abstract—a Shins song heard unexpectedly during a drive down the Turnpike—but to see it play out on screen, beat by beat, is dreadful. It was the first pseudo-mature movie that I could actually understand, and to watch it now is to experience the shame of a discarded version of oneself.\n\nThe nostalgia that attracts a fan to “Garden State” is of a particular Internet variety: sow the seed of something beloved but nearly forgotten and the buds will yield attention, page views, gimmicks, and, of course, funds. Braff is picking up on this, to his credit, but it would be a shame if Kickstarter were taken over by those with the power to have appealed to their bases by alternate means. Kickstarter, after all, promises to facilitate the discovery of new projects, not the excavation of pop culture’s past."
