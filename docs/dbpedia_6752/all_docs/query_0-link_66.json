        "text": "Meet the 30 Under 30 Local Cincinnati Class of 2024\n\nBy Alexandra York, Zoya Hasan and Alicia Park\n\nBig things are brewing in Cincinnati. From record-breaking NFL quarterback Joe Burrow to a 28-year-old founder of a multi-million dollar mental health startup, the Queen City is becoming a hot bed for young talent.\n\nMore than a decade ago, Forbes launched the 30 Under 30 franchise—the definitive list spotlighting the must-know young people changing the world. Now, we’re taking it local. The end result: The 30 pioneers charting Cincinnati’s future.\n\nCaden Adams & Kayla Braden\n\n24, 24 | Cofounders, Peachy and Vintage\n\nAs sophomores at Northern Kentucky University, Kayla Braden and Caden Adams began selling thrifted goods on e-commerce platform Depop and became “top sellers” on the app. The success encouraged them to expand their brand to a brick-and-mortar storefront their senior year. After quickly outgrowing that first space, they moved to the 2,500 square foot shop in the Greater Cincinnati area where their company, Peachy and Vintage, currently operates. The duo placed second in the KY Pitch competition in 2022 and were recognized as Cincy Inno 5 Under 25 winners in 2023.\n\nEmil Barr\n\n21 | Founder, Step Up Social\n\nLike many startups, Step Up Social was founded in Emil Barr’s college dorm room in 2021. The marketing agency—which specializes in short-form videos for TikTok and Instagram Reels—brought in $550,000 in 2023 revenue and projects doubling that in 2024. Clients include Hulk Hogan, P&G and Decker's Brands. In July, Step Up Social merged with Los Angeles-based Candid Network, which counts clients like Shopify, Nike and Banana Republic. Barr is also the founded Flashpass, a social media certification company that provides social media training for businesses through Ohio’s TechCred program.
