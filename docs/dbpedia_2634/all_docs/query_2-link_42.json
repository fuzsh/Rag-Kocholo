        "text": "Astro\n\n1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nAstro (all-asia satellite television and radio operator), the first provider of satellite television and paid radio services in Malaysia and has expanded to Brunei and Indonesia. This service is a favorite among Malaysian citizen because it offers a wide variety of channels from entertainment, news, sports and children’s channels. With attractive packages it has increased the number of their customers from year to year. But recently the company Measat Broadcast Networks Sdn. Bhd, a service provider for Astro against illegal streaming device (ISD) equipment sellers who provide Astro broadcast applications over the internet illegally or on illegal streaming content sites. It is a violation of copyright under the Copyright Act 1987 to those who sell other people’s copyrighted items. This problem can cause losses to the company if more customers buy subscriptions illegally.\n\n2.0 COMPANY INFORMATION\n\n2.1 Background\n\nFigure 1: Company Logo\n\n2.2 Products/Services\n\nThe Astro company has a variety of device units and installations that are free to customers who subscribe to any Astro broadcast package. Among the device unit packages are:\n\nNjoi – it’s a free satellite TV service from Astro. A digital channel of entertainment, learning and information with no monthly fee & no contract. However, the installation and device must\n\nbe paid as much as RM399 according to the Malaysian market price.\n\nFigure 2: Njoi device unit\n\nAstro ULTRA – it’s the latest generation of 4K UHD enabled box devices that have upgraded features such as Cloud recording features, a new redesigned interface and UHD resolution. However, the package has to be paid every month as low as RM59.99 according to the market price.\n\nFigure 3: Astro ULTRA device unit\n\nAstro Go – It is a free streaming companion application for all Astro customers to watch any channels on their smartphones, tablets and computers anytime and anywhere. It can be obtained in the app store and Google store.\n\nFigure 4: Astro Go application\n\nAstro Fiber – It is Astro’s own internet service that allows customers to enjoy Astro content while staying connected with high-speed fiber broadband. Customers will enjoy a huge discount by choosing the broadband speed the customer wants from 50 Mbps to 800 Mbps to accompany the customer’s Astro TV package.\n\nFigure 5: Astro Fiber device unit\n\n2.3 Business, marketing, operational strategy\n\nAstro Malaysia Holdings Berhad is a Malaysian media and entertainment holding company that began as a paid digital satellite radio and television service. Astro has provided various broadcasts to 5.7 million television households and 17.2 million radio listeners in Malaysia.\n\nAt the beginning, Astro only provided 23 television broadcasts such as Astro Ria, TV1, TV2 Astro Vaanavil, Astro Wah Lai Toi and many more. As well as 5 radio broadcasts such as Hitz FM, TalkRadio, Mix FM and many more. Eventually, the Astro company began to create more television and radio broadcasts. In addition, Astro also cooperates with several local broadcasting companies such as Media Prima Berhad which broadcasts TV3, 8TV, NTV7 and many more.\n\nNext, customers can watch international broadcasts that have a variety of broadcasts such as sports, education, cooking, shopping and documentaries that can be ordered according to a certain package. Therefore, the Astro company provides a variety of attractive broadcast packages at Affordable price and provides free installation services to customers. Among them, Astro company services are ready to provide the best maintenance and service to customers if there are problems related to the product.\n\nAstro company is also following current developments where at this time, broadband development is starting to be upgraded. Therefore, Astro Fibre plan is an internet service or Internet Protocol Television service (IPTV) where customers can watch their broadcasts through a broadband connection that offers HDTV and high-speed internet services. This plan took place in collaboration with TIME dotCom Berhad and Maxis Berhad to expand their business. In addition, Syarikat Astro started taking broadcasts that produce movies such as Disney+ Hotstar, Netflix, HBO GO and many more. This is because it is an interesting opportunity and many customers request to use the movie broadcast. Therefore, Astro began to obtain approval to provide a film broadcast package.\n\n2.4 Financial achievements\n\nFigure 6: The segmental analysis and quarterly\n\nAccording to the segmental analysis and quarterly in the table, it shows a decrease when compared to 2021 and 2022. In addition, referring to the company’s stock information also shows a decrease of 29 billion on December 31, 2021 to 15 billion on September 30, 2022.\n\nThis may be a result of the COVID-19 pandemic where the ministry ordered a lockdown and reduced the operation of some premises in October 2021. However, Astro is empowering Internet Service Provider (ISP) services where Astro will become a company that provides internet services such as Telekom Malaysia Berhad, Celcom and many more. Therefore, the planning of Astro Fiber devices with various sets of attractive offers and packages and the planning will be launched on a full-scale to market this service to the public.\n\nAt the same time, Astro will continue to invest in its transformation plans, in particular content, broadband, streaming, customer experience, data, addressable advertising and technology infrastructure to simplify our processes, reduce overheads and, most importantly, to better serve for customers.\n\n3.0 COMPANY ANALYSIS\n\n3.1 Threats\n\n– Less service at countryside\n\n– Security level of illegal broadcast subscriptions\n\n– New technologies be developed by competitors and market disruptors\n\nAstro company has threats that need to be emphasized. Among the problems is the sale of broadcast package subscriptions went marketed at countryside. This is because Astro’s broadcast service is difficult to broadcast at countryside due to the weak network. Moreover, the security level of broadcast subscriptions that are easily obtained illegally. This is because Astro broadcast subscriptions are easily available on the internet without the knowledge of the Astro company. Among them, the Astro company is also facing competitors from broadcast companies or other networks. This is because every new device that be create by the Astro company, the competitors company it will take that idea and change it with more features and advanced. This can disrupt the marketing of those new device.\n\n4.0 FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION\n\n4.1 Findings\n\n4.1.1 Device units and broadcast services were purchased illegally.\n\nAstro Company’s profits are obtained through the sale of packages or sets of broadcast offers that include device units that are installed for free according to subscriptions purchased by customers. There is a complaint from Measat Broadcast Networks Sdn. Bhd which is owned by Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd who complained about the purchase of device items that do not belong to the Astro company and obtaining Astro broadcasts through the internet illegally or on illegal streaming content sites. Without management and agreement between buyers and sellers, it can affect the company’s income if more people do such actions.\n\n4.1.2 Cybercrime cases\n\nToday, there are many cases of cybercrime where criminals will steal users’ personal information. This problem occurs if the user browses illegally website which is dangerous and installs an application that is not from real owner. This problem can cause various problems such as extortion, spreading false information, online bank theft and many more. This problem can also have an impact on the Astro company because there is a high possibility that users can issue a lawsuit to the company over the level of safety of using Astro device units.\n\n4.2 Discussion\n\n4.2.1 Report the problem to the authorities.\n\nFrom copyright problem, Astro Company has to complain to the local government. This is because the behavior of illegally selling some other item or other people’s copyright is a violation of copyright under the Laws of Malaysia Copyright Act 1987. Seeing from the decision by the High Court the offense explains that the offense belongs to the sale of illegal streaming device (ISD) where punishment will be imposed on the offender according to the cases of criminal activity imposed on the sellers of this ISD item.\n\nAdvantages: Help fight the crime of national piracy in the right way.\n\nDisadvantages: Long implementation process and need to deal with the High Court.\n\n4.2.2 Create a new device that has a strong security level with new features.\n\nThis copyright problem can be solved by increasing the security level of the device unit. Therefore, the device unit that will be developed is able to solve the problem by providing a serial number on each purchase package subscription. The serial number is only\n\nissued by Astro to customers via email. Then, the user needs to enter the serial number in the device unit settings. This allows the customer to not be able to view any broadcast if the subscription serial number is not entered into Astro device.\n\nIn addition, increasing the security level of device units is also able to guarantee the safety of customers by providing a security layer function such as firewalls and malware that can prevent hacking from breaking into the network of customer device units. Looking at the scenario where the customer is attracted to the broadcast subscription fraud market with a cheaper price than the Astro company’s market price and the customer uploads the subscription. This device will analyze and identify every connected network activity whether it is from the Astro network or not. If the subscription that uses bought from hacker tries to break through the security level of the device, the device will automatically block the network and the device unit will give a notification to the user that their device has been hacked and ask to change the subscription.\n\nThis device will also increase the image resolution rate to 8K UHD. It is upgraded from the Astro ULTRA device which is the latest generation of Astro devices with an image resolution of 4K UHD. The difference between those two resolutions is, 8K UHD gives us a feeling of looking at the real thing because it has a 3D effect render feature. In addition, it is capable of reproducing a far wider range of color than precious HD and double the frame rate from 60 fps for HD to 120 fps for 8K UHD.\n\nFigure 7: Full HD, 4UHD and 8UHD resolution\n\nMoreover, this device adds new features where this device can not only watch television broadcasts or browsing the internet. It is also a video game digital distribution service device. Users can upload video game applications such as games from Epic Games, Origin, Steam Games and many more. These new features are able to draw customer interest and increase the device unit market.\n\nFigure 8: video game applications\n\nAdvantages: Increase the level of business quality from invalid broadcast package subscriptions and increase the security level of device units.\n\nDisadvantages: The research and development (R&D) department needs to review the old device unit problem for the addition of new features in the device unit that will be developed.\n\n5.0 CONCLUSION\n\nLooking at the whole discussion, the Astro company has been increasing the service of broadcasting television and radio shows for several decades. Now, Astro is one of the main shows of Malaysians and Asian residents nearby. In addition, many improvements and exciting plans follow the current distribution by providing the best subscription and service to customers. This is because Astro Malaysia Holdings Berhad wants to achieve their vision of being Malaysia’s no.1 entertainment destination. At present, the problem faced by the Astro company is the copyright problem. The problem can cause huge losses to the Astro company if many people buy device units and purchase broadcast packages illegally. However, this copyright incident is not a new crime in Malaysia and legal action can be taken if a report is made to someone responsible for the product copyright crime.\n\nCanon\n\n5.0 CONCLUSION\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThis is an effort to learn how to apply the ideas to realistic circumstances. As we all know, doing some research for our case study is a necessary thing. So, for this reason, we got the opportunity to study a company that produced the same product we want to create which is a Canon, currently based in Japan.\n\nThe second section of the project report is where the general information about the company was gathered. Additionally, information is gleaned from primary and secondary sources. In the second section of the report is the specialist subject-study. The initiative tries to concentrate on the context in which the primary problems, solutions, and associated ideas\n\nare present. First, we are researching Canon’s camera technology, which is essentially a standard technology utilised in the camera industry, as well as the company’s commercial, marketing, and industry-related strategies, all of which we find to be quite intriguing. The problem’s remedy is then examined, and findings and discussions of business and financial management successes are included.\n\nIn this case, a study using SWOT analysis we evaluated this company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in the real business world. Therefore, we studied and found a solution from the needs of this company’s current customers to resolve and make it our challenging part to proceed with the new product growth. Then the conclusion for the problems is being made at the recommendation and improvement part.\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1 Background of the study\n\nTechnology entrepreneurship is a tool that promotes growth in people, enterprises, regions, and countries. Finding high-potential, technology-intensive market opportunities for future development into consumer goods, processes, or services should be a focus of technology entrepreneurship research.\n\nTo find a suitable subject for a case study in which the main element is to recognize a product with significant potential for innovation, it would be most useful to study a product that many people use either for hobby or for work. Thus, it can also target the existing market or create an entirely new one. Hence, this case study is more to the existing market which not fully used technology tools.\n\n1.2 Problem Statement\n\nAs we all know, there are so many types of cameras in this nowadays industry. Each type of brand produces a good product for consumer and Canon would be one of it. Besides had a tight competition with the same categories of a product but a different brand, Canon also needs to compete with the smartphone company. Furthermore, smartphones camera is easy to use rather than a digital or mirrorless camera. In this era, a consumer of any age is preferable to use a smartphone camera. Assuming if the smartphone’s camera is more sophisticated in transferring images or functional tools, Canon will lose their strength as a worldwide brand including its marketing.\n\n1.3 Purpose of the study\n\nThe aim of the case study is to learn more about the firm and the product. able to identify product problems from the facts gathered to give the greatest concept of the innovation we’re going to contribute to the specified problem. The case study might aid the young entrepreneur in learning more by providing a practical company example. The case study can be used to evaluate how theories and concepts are applied to actual business scenarios. Additionally, they would be able to assist us by enhancing the decision-making and problem-solving skills that we may require when we soon enter the workforce.\n\n2.0 COMPANY INFORMATION\n\n2.1 Background\n\nHeadquarters of CANON INC. are in Tokyo, Japan.

Network cameras: Canon is applying such technologies as optics, image processing, sensors and communications technologies to develop multipurpose industrial camera systems that include intelligent surveillance cameras and wide-area surveillance with a greatly expanded field of view.\n\n2. Commercial printing: We are entering the huge market for offset printing and expanding the scope of high-mix, low-volume digital printing.\n\n3. Healthcare: Canon has long been developing its business for fundus cameras and x-ray sensors, but with the addition of Canon Medical Systems to our group, we now have a line-up of diagnostic equipment, including CT, MRI and ultrasound diagnostic equipment. We aim to achieve new advancements in the future by incorporating Canon technologies. 4. Industrial equipment: Canon manufactures ultra-high-precision semiconductor lithography equipment. As an extension of this business, we are focused on developing manufacturing equipment for organic LED (OLED) displays and MRAM (magneto resistive memory) and bonding equipment (devices for bonding the semiconductor die to a substrate).\n\nIn the long run, they will be able to develop diverse solutions to meet the needs of society by combining Canon’s powerful hardware with software technologies which employ AI. Canon’s job philosophy has been to “make the unseen visible.” In the future, as technology is evolving, not only will we be able to see things that were once unseen, but we will also be able to recognize and even make decisions based on what we can see now.\n\n2.4 Business, marketing, operational strategy\n\nThe medium-to-long-term Great Global Corporation Plan was introduced by Canon in 1996, and the first four phases of this plan have been successfully completed. Canon’s goal is to become an excellent corporation that is recognised and respected throughout the world. As they take on the challenge of fresh growth through a massive strategic transformation, they are putting seven main strategies into action in Phase V.\n\nEstablishing a new manufacturing system to get a cost-of-sales ratio of 45% is one of the first strategies. By placing a focus on Japanese production and combining design, procurement, production-engineering, and manufacturing-technology activities, local mother factories can be strengthened. Automation, robots, and other production engineering technologies can help you cut expenses. The second strategies are strengthened and help grow existing firms while generating new ones. Accelerate the horizontal expansion of existing businesses to create and grow new ones. Consolidate management resources, including the use of M&A, at the same time to hasten the expansion of potential company sectors.\n\nThe third strategies are restructure the global sales network in accordance with market changes. Review existing sales organizations and reinforce omni-channel marketing that integrates online and conventional sales routes. Strengthen and expand customer driven solutions businesses and focus energies on cultivating markets in emerging countries. The fourth strategies are enhanced R&D capabilities through open innovation. Discard the strict notion of self-sufficiency and construct an R&D system that proactively leverages external technologies and knowledge, promoting joint and contract research with various partners such as domestic and foreign universities and research institutes.\n\nNext, the fifth strategies are complete the Three Regional Headquarters management system capturing world dynamism. Promote the acquisition of promising businesses through M&A and complete the Three Regional Headquarters management system, under which Japan, the U.S. and Europe utilize each region’s strengths to establish comprehensive and efficient management. The sixth strategies are cultivating globally competent human resources capable of performing duties while maintaining an all encompassing perspective of the world map. Optimize use of human resources in operations worldwide. Evaluate personnel around the globe to identify candidates for senior management positions and develop the skills of these future leaders by rotating them through key positions in Japan and overseas.\n\nThe last strategies are re-instilling the Canon Spirit as a foundation for new growth. Revitalize the enterprising spirit in our corporate DNA and the San-ji (Three Self’s) Spirit,\n\nwhich have been the guiding principles of growth since our foundation and complete a grand strategic transformation. By those strategies it will help the company to strengthen its financial structure.\n\n3.0 COMPANY ANALYSIS\n\n3.1 SWOT Analysis\n\n4.0 FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION\n\n4.1Findings\n\nCanon, Inc. has remained one of those stellar performers that not only survived in the recession period that took place in Japan but also it grew and prospered in spite of difficult domestic market environment. Canon is one of the brands that already known worldwide. This brand has strong strength in many aspects, especially in manufacturing, quality, technology, and design. Each product that Canon produce has its own specialties used which means the technology used by Canon is sophisticated technology. For example, Canon’s product consists of a photography Camera that is a Digital SLR Camera and a Mirrorless Camera. Both types of cameras have their own benefit. For Digital SLR cameras, their target market more to a consumer who really desired a pretty or good image which is a professional photographer either use for work or for its own hobby. The second one is for the mirrorless camera target market is more to the consumer who uses it for enjoying the environment like taking pictures easy that is more to a family type.\n\nIn this case study, the problem that needs to find is based on Mirrorless Camera type. This type of camera is more likely to be used by any range of age. The design and its function might be more environmentally friendly which is easy to use and easy to carry everywhere. From the internet review, they really suggested use to buy the mirrorless camera because of its quality material and not bad in technology. But even though it is recommended, a few problems with the product need to be solved. The problem is assuming that when we want to take a family picture by using a tripod stand, we need to use a timer at the camera. So, it might be hard for the person who handles it because they need to run from one place to another place. Besides, if you are the type of person who loves to take a picture, there must be a lot of pictures that you want. So, it might be hard for you to transfer the picture to your smartphone or laptop. Thus, both of the problems need to be solved.\n\nFurthermore, though a global brand, they still have difficulties in sustaining their marketing. The lack of marketing experience and the inability to leverage the internet market’s full potential contribute to limited access for consumers who do not live in Tokyo, Japan. As a result, Canon’s products don’t target many potential customers. This modern marketing strategy applied is called e-business and is one of the most important purchasing channels in our days. In addition, ecommerce, which is part of the e-business, focuses on shares in online purchase and selling.\n\n4.2 Discussion\n\nTo identify an alternative solution to this problem, a few aspects need to be considered which is the tools are applicable for the camera design. Upgrading a product to a better thing isn’t as easy as we thought. However, it still needs to be solved. Hence, the first problem is an innovation needs to be done by change the timer button to the voice detector. Instead of we ran from one place to another just to catch the timer, why don’t we used our voice by saying something like ‘cheese’ word to make camera detect our voice then it will automatically snap for us. Besides, it can also use the hand gesture as a button to snap the picture. This might be a huge change to the design and manufacturing of the camera.\n\nThe second solution to the problem of transferring picture creates an app that can connect to the camera. Based on the information that already collected, the mirrorless camera only has WIFI in its feature. So, adding a new feature to the camera which is an app and Bluetooth can make it easier for users to transfer the picture as many as they want. The apps need to be installed on the smartphone or laptop. The other solution is upgrading the memory card or Sd card by making it large in MB then it will be transferred when needed.\n\nLastly, online marketing should be expanded to more dealers. For example, instead of the only amazon as an online supplier, attract another online supplier to sell the canon brand of products. On the official website of Canon which is dependent on its country, the review or feedback of a product section should be included as it will make the buyers easy to choose based on their target. Businesses these days use a variety of different methods to market themselves. Some methods are more costly than others, but one very effective and affordable means of marketing is through promotions in media. Everybody loves a special offer, discount, and this is one of the ways in which can spread the word about the business as well as drive traffic to into site. Of course, there is no point in having special offers and deals unless making people aware of them. Using social media platforms to market your promotions can benefit in many ways. This will solve problems having a lack of customers. The owner must enhance their sale by selling through media that nowadays people often find on it. Instagram, Facebook, or other else can improve gaining some customers and sales. It can seem that many young people use media social to sell their thing, but it’s not restricted for aged people like the owner. Moreover, it benefits the owner besides having quicker sales and attract new customers. This kind of strategy will help to improve the Canon financial.\n\n5.0 CONCLUSION\n\nIn a nutshell, Canon has succeeded in making a transition from a small family start-up to a relatively large company, having plenty of goods on the market that is known for its supposedly high quality along with rising prices and a well-paid consumer base. We can conclude from findings and discussion that every problem has its own solution, but it will depend on the suitability of the product. The solution is to create the functional features in the camera as it will give more benefits to the user. To attract a broader variety of consumers, specific steps need to be taken with the goal of innovating. By introducing the concept of creating a new feature, this dream statement is attempted to make it a reality, so that the product can reach a whole different market in terms of families, young people, and many more based on their uses. There will also be a new plan for keeping the campaign running. Some of these improvements, general changes and developments do need to be made under the presumption of a few sensitive aspects that the organization has not disclosed to us in due course.\n\nStar Buck\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nNowadays, many companies make their own app as their way to attract consumers and to improve direct communication with clients and customers. Other than that, they encourage consumers to use the app so they can make cashless payment as one of their options to use to make any transaction or payment and even or track their collection points. Not only that, most consumers also prefer to use that method instead of using cash so they are no need to bring any cash and there will be more contactless interaction between the consumers and retailers or cashiers. Starbucks launched their own app, using which customers could find out nearby stores, nutrition details, and even an interactive drink builder. The app has been proved to be a modification for improving retail experiences and plays a key role in securing brand sustainability.\n\n1.0 COMPANY INFORMATION\n\n1.1 Company Background\n\nStarbucks Corporation is an American coffee chain that was established in 1971 in cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market, Washington. The company’s name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick” and the mermaid logo were inspired by the love of the sea.\n\nTen years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz came by the shop and become captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip, then joining the company in 1982. In 1983, Howard experienced Italy’s coffeehouses when he was on a trip to Milan, and when he returned to Seattle, he brought the artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks as inspiration. By 1987, the company swapped their brown aprons to green ones and embarked on their next chapter as a coffeehouse.\n\nAfter some decades, they would grow to welcome millions of customers each week from neighbourhoods all around the world. They are always dedicated to their company’s mission which is “To inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup, and one neighbourhood at a time”. While Starbucks’s vision is “Establish Starbucks as the most recognized and respected brand in the world”.\n\n1.2 Products/Services\n\nStarbucks serves hot and cold beverages, entire bean espresso, micro-ground moment espresso, coffee, caffe latte, full-and free leaf tea products, Frappuccino refreshments and some baked goods. Some Starbucks outlets sell pre-bundled nourishment items, sweltering and cold sandwiches, and drinkware such as cups and tumblers. Furthermore, there are\n\nSelect “Starbucks Evenings” areas that offer brew, wine, and appetizers. Starbucks also provided a service where customers can order their own customized drinks.\n\n1.3 Business, Marketing and Operational Strategy\n\nOne of the Starbucks plans in this modern era is to expand its mobile marketing strategies to increase purchases in-app through personalized recommendations in 2016. Then in 2018, the Starbucks app was the most regularly used loyalty rewards app in major restaurant chains. Almost over 30 million people have used the app to order food and beverages from the company.\n\nStarbucks has a rewards program that is actually very traditional. Essentially, once you order enough food or beverages, you’ll be rewarded with freebies. It is similar to the conventional “buy ten, get one free” customer loyalty program.\n\nThe difference between Starbucks’s rewards and other brand is that the app helps users track previous orders and automatically adds the rewards to their points called “Star balance.” The app will track reward every time the users place an order in real-time. Users can also get higher rewards for things like ordering food or coffee a certain number of days in a row or playing games within the app. There are even “personalized challenges” for the users to challenge to earn star rewards faster. User can check their Star balance easier and they can see various options to earn more reward points right on the same interface.\n\n1.4 Financial achievements\n\n1.0 Number of Starbucks stores Worldwide.\n\n1.1 Starbucks Revenue Over The Years from 2011 to 2021. In 2020, the revenue drops because of the lockdown during Covic-19 at it peaks. (picture source by StartupTalky)\n\n2.0 COMPANY ANALYSIS\n\n2.1 SWOT Analysis on Starbucks\n\n3.0 FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION\n\n3.1 Findings\n\nFrom the SWOT analysis, it is shown that one of the major problems that the company is facing is that Starbucks app is unstable to use and have many problems in logging in account or never receive any emails if they have problems or other problems. In this modern era, many people prefer to pay something using cashless payment method, which they pay using by cards or online banking or points rewards in apps. Many consumers have high expectations towards Starbucks app since it is a famous brand, but turns out later that the app is a disappointment for them during their experiences using the app. These are some images to prove that the app is not useful for some customers:\n\nThe rating for the app is so low that shown that the app has many problems that need to be done so they can gain the customers’ trust back.\n\nThe image above shown some of the users’ complaint when they use the app.\n\n3.2 Discussion\n\nStarbucks needs to bring some improvements in the company to keep its market position stable and strong. They also need to search for any strategies to maintain or increase their market share and influence. For this, there are few recommendations that are being discuss as below:\n\n1. Make regular maintenances for their apps at least once a month so it can work smoothly for both administrator and the users.\n\n2. Give more rewards if they use the app to order and make payment to attract more customers and increase the affordability for all classes of consumers.\n\n3. Fix the login issues as soon as possible whenever a user makes a complaint. 4. Make a change of the user’s interfaces into more an attraction interfaces so they will be more delighted to use the app more often.\n\n5. Upgrade the system security so the user’s privacy information will be secured safely.\n\nOther than that, Starbucks can use a new feature where they add their own digital wallet for payment for those who does not have Starbucks Card. In the current app, consumers can pay using the app if they register their Starbucks Card into the app. So, they have choices whether to pay using physical card or digital card and they can know their balance remains. But not all consumers can purchase cards, so they pay by using cash or using the app by online banking or credit or debit cards.\n\nWith this suggested feature, consumers who don’t have money in their bank account or in their digital wallet like Touch n Go eWallet but have some money in the suggested digital wallet, then the customers will have not worry and they can satisfy their cravings.\n\n4.0 CONCLUSION\n\nThis case study examined the influential factors that affected Starbucks’ brand loyalty through content analysis. The purpose of this study was to understand the threats that the brand had been facing and to provide some practical suggestions for their use in the future.\n\nThe findings that I found indicate that several of the brand loyalty factors have been applicable to Starbucks is to perceived quality, transactional costs, situational factors, status, satisfaction and commitment.\n\nSome of Starbucks’ strategies have contributed to multiple brand loyalty factors which is one of them is the mobile Order and Pay app. The Mobile Order and Pay application have reduced waiting time and increased the customers’ satisfaction. But with the current problems occurring which the app being unstable, it can be a worst experience for customers who want to use the mobile app as their way of payment nowadays.\n\nIf they can upgrade the systems of the mobile apps, then they can highly recommend the customers to use the app for further building to stream lining ease of use and payment process. With these, it would help drive more customers, decrease wait time in stores and increase the efficiency. Not only that, it is also recommended to integrate Starbucks loyalty program with the mobile application.\n\nmonaliza enterprise sdn bhd\n\n1.2 Products/Services\n\n1) IT Devices retailer: Monaliza & Mastura Enterpise Sdn.

Is an IT company that been originally structured in Kelantan. Monaliza is a biggest local IT company in Kelantan with 5 branches around Kota Bharu. The company operates in the Computer and Computer Peripheral Equipment and Software Merchant Wholesalers sector. The enterprise was incorporated on November 18, 1991.\n\nThe company accel at being the top of its competition in Kelantan for IT company, they achieved it by offering more varied of selection for customer at affordable price compared to the current market value. The wide selection of IT devices truly makes an impact as the customer would try to check for, they desired at the widest selection store. In term of price, Monaliza also offers slightly cheaper than the current prices in IT market thanks to that their able to secure many customers.\n\nBesides, Monaliza also manage to secure a strategic location for their store in Kelantan, for example KB mall. As one of the big mall shopping malls in Kelantan it is undoubted that the placement leads the increasing of sales as the customer would make a swing to the shop when they went shopping at KB mall.\n\nThey also managed to tackle the IT market competition in Kelantan by developing their own websites for the store. This website shows the current stock and price for the devices at their stores. With this website, customers were able to check up the store without even visiting the store. This will help them to decide what to buy before going out to the store. This website also helps the customers that are far or out of reach as they could survey Monaliza’s product through the website.\n\n1.4 Financial Statistic\n\nFigure 2.0: Company Performance Graph\n\nBased on the figure 2.0, we can conclude that Monaliza excels in its sales. In its most recent financial highlights, the company reported a net sales revenue increase of 16.22% in 2021. Over the same period, its total assets grew by 41.89%. The net profit margin of Monaliza & Mastura Enterprise Sdn. Bhd. decreased by 0.4% in 2021.\n\n2.0 COMPANY ANALYSIS\n\n2.1 Threats\n\n– Slow customer and repair services.\n\n– Slow paces of restocking.\n\n– Rise of other bigger companies outside Kelantan.\n\nMonaliza & Mastura Enterprise Sdn. Bhd. have a few threats that need to emphasize. Among them are slow customer and repair services, this problem often occurs when there are too many customers that try to apply for services. Monaliza would often been overflowed with request to upgrade or fixing the customer devices. Besides, Monaliza also suffers from the slow pacing for restocking. At the starts of new graduate season, would always makes monaliza out of stock for some product as the graduates always visit their store for buying laptop and PCs. Furthermore, Monaliza also is being compete with other bigger IT company outsides of Kelantan.\n\n3.0 FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\n3.1 Findings\n\n3.1.1 Slow Customer and Repair Services\n\nThe main problem for monaliza is that the customer service often overflows with request which make the queue absurdly long and unorganized. This problem led to many customers complain which would affect the company trust ability. It is worrisome that customer would choose to get services at other premises besides Monaliza, this would greatly affect Monaliza income as the customers choose other IT company or store to get their Devices Fixed or Upgraded. The wait time sometime even reach 1 to 2 weeks delay for customers just to get their devices fixed. Which mean the customers cannot used their devices for that long.\n\n3.1.2 Slow Paces of Restocking\n\nSlow paces of restocking also became a vulnerable issue for Monaliza. Monaliza also suffering from slow restocking process even worse when the season for graduate to enter their new university, when the graduate wants to enter their new university, they would often like to purchase a new device that compatible with their new learning course. Some people would always like to showcase a new device that release in the IT market this all will lead to Monaliza crumble of stock, in summary the crumble of stock suffered by Monaliza cause by the unexpected large buying from the new graduates and enthusiast gamer. Monaliza must plan their stocking process carefully because they get their stock from overseas, which why it would slow down the stocking process.\n\n3.2 Discussions\n\n3.2.1 Developed a Separated Application for Customer and Repair Services\n\nFor Monaliza to address this problem, they to create a new separated application which specifies in booking and reserves for customer and repair services. The apps can be access throughout all the platform devices portable and non-portable. This allows for more flexible access for customer to book their customer and repair services anytime and anywhere.\n\nThe application also must allow the customer to view the queue and free time of the services which allow the customer to properly plan the book time. By allowing this the customers can freely adjust the timing which aligned with their need. Also, the application must have multiple services choices that span from fixing device, cleaning device, maintenance and upgrading the device. It also must display the price for each service so that the customer can see how much that it will cost for the services they want.\n\nLastly the application also must have a careline services for the customer especially for the IT literal, elderly person or the customer that have a unique question. This helps the customer who didn’t know what happen to their devices to seek help from the careline services. It also helps a lot for an elderly since they can get overwhelmed with the abundance\n\nof menu in the application. This would help to properly organize the queue and helps the customers who not very accustomed to their devices problems and also helps make the store less crowded.\n\nAdvantage: Helps make queue more organize and efficient for customer and repair services and it also make the service counter lee crowded.\n\nDisadvantage: The application requires more manpower that excel in IT devices repair expert. 3.2.2 Developed an AI for Calculating Restock Probability\n\nMonaliza also must develop an AI to calculate all the possible purchase of the new graduates. The AI should be able to count all the purchase quota and income probability for Monaliza store. By counting all the probability Monaliza would be able to predict how much the product will be bought and able to prepare for it. The AI also can calculate the market price and stock price in the meantime. This helps Monaliza to calculate on restock value more accurate and have more faster process of ordering. Overall, this method is positive improvement for Monaliza stocking process.\n\nAdvantages: Able to help Monaliza calculate faster and restock faster.\n\nDisadvantage: Require high level of investment and large AI company involvement.\n\n4.0 CONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion, Monaliza Enterpise Sdn.Bhd. is the leading IT device seller in Kelantan at this moment. Monaliza continue to improve day by day aligned with the flow of time, their feats in getting to the top IT company in Kelantan must be complimented. It is true that this time they can overcame the problem with my help and ideas, but the future is still unknown to anyone. They must know what lacking in their services to be able to improve more and soon to be the one that reign the IT company in Malaysia. By looking at the current progress I can say that Monaliza has the chance to be the one.\n\n5.0 Reference\n\nJ&T\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nJ&T Express is one of the businesses offering logistical services for the transportation of papers and commodities that can compete with more established businesses. J&T provides delivery goods and documents to the costumers’ doorsteps. However, there is a problem that was found such that the unprofessionalism and untruthfulness of the workers which the problem has been found in this case study.\n\nCOMPANY INFORMATION\n\nBackground\n\nJ&T Express which stands J for jet and T for technology that founded in 2015, is a Hong Kong-based courier company that operates in six Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, and the Philippines. J&T Express is an express delivery service that uses cutting-edge modernised e-technology. This company is proud to diversify its business from express deliveries, warehousing, and supply chains, all while covering the same city, inter-islands and international zone. J&T Express is a dependable integrated logistics company. The tagline “Express Your Online Business” positions J&T Express as the heart of e-commerce express. Their persistence in implementing advanced IT management systems improves global express delivery services and customer service quality with the quickest, most convenient and most efficient claims.\n\nJ&T Express began in Indonesia and has since expanded to Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Cambodia, and other countries to provide the best e-commerce express delivery in Southeast Asia.\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\nSPV\n\nHuman\n\nResources\n\nCoordinator Admin\n\nCustomer\n\nBranding Ware house IT services\n\nWarehouse Operation Finance Purchasing Logistic Training\n\nProducts/ Services\n\n– Last Mile Delivery\n\nDeliver customers’ packages to their doorsteps.\n\n– International Delivery\n\nCould deliver the packages as soon as possible and could track where they\n\nare at any point in time.\n\n– Fulfillment and Warehousing\n\nEnable the warehouse seamlessly integrates with major eMarket places and\n\neCommerce stores to enable omnichannel fulfillment.\n\nBusiness, marketing and operational strategy\n\nWhile most comparable businesses do not utilise brand ambassadors as a way of promotion, J&T Express uses them as part of their advertising as one of their marketing strategies. Maintaining the quality of the service also becomes a component of the strategy used by businesses to compete with one another. Price serves as a further determinant in the choice of logistics service providers for prospective customers of logistical services.\n\nCOMPANY ANALYSIS\n\nThreats\n\nDuring the pandemic in 2020, J&T was one of the couriers that plays a part in Malaysian courier services due to their fast shipment. They could deliver those parcels within 24 hours and over 700 thousand parcels have to be delivered to their rightful owners. Therefore, there is a higher chance the parcel might get missing. One of the worst cases was during the lockdown when most Malaysians have to stay at home because of the lockdown. So, they had to purchase products through online platforms. Therefore, there were lots of missing parcels during the delivery packages process. As a result, this drew a variety of emotions from net citizens and consumers who regretted the conduct of the personnel involved because they were concerned that the products in the shipment would not get into their hands.\n\nFINDINGS AND DISCUSSION\n\nFindings\n\nAs shown in the company analysis, there has been found a problem in J&T system. Therefore, the problem in this case is the loss of parcels of customers during the delivery of packages.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe solution to this problem is by using a GPS tracking system that use the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) network. This network consists of satellites that communicate with GPS devices to provide information on the vehicle’s current location, direction, time, and speed. We could implement GPS tracking into the packages by using this method. GPS tracking devices transmit special satellite signals, which are decoded by a receiver. These GPS receivers track the GPS device’s exact location as well as the time and velocity at which it is traveling. Using four different types of GPS satellite signals, these positions can also be computed and represented in three-dimensional views. GPS systems are divided into three parts: space, control, and user.\n\nThe advantage of having GPS by employees during the delivery of packages is customers could know the location of their goods and what exact time the goods could arrive. While the disadvantage affected the riders as it uses a lot of power which could drain battery in 8 to 12 hours. And it needs replacement or recharge of battery quite frequently.\n\nShopee Express\n\nExecutive Summary\n\n• Background Case Study\n\nAll UiTM Computer Science and Multimedia computing majors are required to pass the Technology Entrepreneurship (ENT600) course.

However, there are a few complaints from the customer itself about their service such as their parcel were lost and slow delivery.\n\nCompany Analysis\n\n• SWOT Analysis\n\nSWOT analysis performed to guarantee the level of service provided promptly, effectively, and to satisfy clients.\n\n• Threat\n\n– There were too many competitors from others delivery service company like J&T, Poslaju and others.\n\n– Slow delivery and lost track\n\nFindings and Discussion\n\n• Finding\n\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic has had a significant negative impact on courier delivery systems worldwide and Shopee Express was no exception. The challenge was increasing up by many competitors from others delivery service company and worse thing is slow delivery even no demand.\n\n– Too many competitors\n\nDuring the Covid-19 Pandemic, in Malaysia there were already many Parcel delivery services. Shopee express already have faced the challenge comes from other competitors before the pandemic but it became harder than before because every delivery company are getting stronger and it became threat to Shopee Express.\n\n– Slow Delivery and lost track\n\nEven there are no high demand, Shopee Express always got complaint from the customer about their slow delivery service. Sometimes customer have to face problem like lost track the parcel and that was the cause the parcel delivers late than it should be. What I mean from lost track is the parcel sometime delivers to other place, not the place it should it be.\n\n• Discussion of solution\n\nBased on what we concern about, Shopee Express delivery service was impacted by strong competitor and their system in delivery the parcel. to avoid such problems in the future, some components need to modify to overcome the problem. One of the main issue is there are too many competitors from other delivery services resulting their service can become irrelevant in the future. Other than that, there was other issue also which is slow delivery services. This issue can make the customer feel annoyed with the service and use other service.\n\nRecommendation and Improvement\n\n– Make Shopee Express as the first choice in Shopee App\n\nBefore this, all Shopee customers can choose what courier they want to use for the delivery, but if Shopee make Shopee Express as the first choice it can help the main problem because the user can’t decide what courier they want to use. For example, if someone buy something on Shopee, they need to use courier that Shopee decide, not themselves.\n\n– Use GPS tracker for every parcel and customer can report\n\nFor this problem, Shopee need to use GPS tracker to every parcel so the customer know where is their parcel and can report to the Shopee if their parcel was delivered and wrong place. For example, user can see the parcel inn which truck (use the truck plate number) and they put tracker on the truck so they can see where the truck is. If their parcel is ging to the wrong place, the customer can report to the customer service immediately.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this case study can identify the issues faced by the company. The corporation needs take action by making certain modifications to its business plan in order to thrive in competitive marketplaces. This case study shows how the company to face the issue and give some idea to them to make their service better. Therefore, this case study will assist the organisation in summarising the main issue they are now experiencing.\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) is an American video game\n\nCOMPANY INFORMATION\n\nElectronic Arts (EA) is an American video game company established in May 1982 by William Murray Hawkins III. The company primarily focuses on games for personal computer (PC) but has been making most of their game also available on other platforms such as the Xbox and the PlayStation. They are responsible numerous great games franchises such as Battlefield, The Sims, FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends and many more. The games that kickstarted EA’s rise for success are The Sims franchise and FIFA franchise. These are one of the most well\n\nknown franchises that are still popular for many years to come. These franchises also attracted a lot of audiences which soon became a die-hard fan of games made by EA making them one of the most successful video-game company today with an estimated worth of 35 billion USD.\n\nWhen it comes to the organizational structure of EA, it has a hierarchical organizational structure. It is headed by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Andrew Wilson. It has numerous development studios for different developer from various different countries. For instance, Bioware in Austin, Texas, Codemasters in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia and DICE in Stockholm, Sweden. These developers have a group general manager who responds to Laura Miele who is the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of EA.\n\nEA have a great marketing strategy, which consist of a hybrid strategy of owning a game fully and licensing distributed games with a cross-platform approach. A cross platform approach means that a single game is made available on different platforms such as Xbox, PC and PlayStation. For example, FIFA 22 is made available for PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and Series S, PlayStation 5, Google Stadia, Microsoft Windows. This strategy works very well for EA as it attracts a lot more audience from different platforms as everybody owns different types of platforms. EA also owned a large of successful development studios such as Bioware, Maxis, EA Sports, DICE and Criterion games. These development studios would then develop games that brings loads of revenue towards EA.\n\nThese strategies are proven to be successful as EA’s revenue in the year 2021 was about 5.6 billion USD. and the revenue for 2022 so far is about 6.9 billion USD. This is a huge increase compared to 2021 and is considered a great financial achievement for a company as big as EA.\n\nCOMPANY ANALYSIS\n\nThe company has a lot to offer when it comes to strength. First, their focus on customer’s satisfactions. The company following its mission has always been focused on customer satisfaction. It has been able to achieve it among its present customers and this also\n\n2\n\npositively affects the goodwill of the company in turn affecting its sales. This have given the company a lot of die-hard fans and loyal customers. Second, it developed a lot of creative and innovative products. It has a strong track record of developing original, creative products, which gives it the freedom to experiment with them, which has been advantageous for their\n\nbusiness. Third, the presence of a highly skilled employees. It has produced highly skilled employees thanks to effective training and education initiatives. A highly competent and motivated staff has been developed as a result of the company’s huge investment in employee training and development. Fourth, the use of great marketing strategies. Over the past year, the company’s digital sales have surged as a result of spending more on influencers. One of its most recent and effective strategies was the FIFA Faceoff series, a two-part game show that paired celebrities with FIFA insiders and the general public in an effort to win a $25,000 prize. Fifth, automation. By adopting automation, EA has improved the quality of its products and improved its ability to scale up and down in response to market conditions.\n\nHowever, nothing is perfect and EA is the same. It has flaws and weaknesses. One of the weaknesses of EA are its profitability ratio and net contribution. The profitability ratio and net contribution of EA are deficient and below the industry average. Second, the marketing also has some flaws. Despite employing effective marketing strategies that have helped it succeed in terms of sales, EA doesn’t do a good job of presenting the advantages that make its products stand out from the competition. Third, the lack of investment in research and development (R&D). Even though EA spends more on R&D than the industry standard, it has been unable to keep up with its rivals in terms of innovation in recent years. Fourth, the gaps in the product line. There are gaps in the product line that the business sells that could be advantageous to its rivals. Fifth, the lack of investments in new technologies. The areas and markets where the corporation plans to grow need for greater investment in cutting-edge technology. The business’s most recent technological investments fall short of its strategic goals.\n\nThe company has a lot of opportunities as it is a growing industry. First, the new taxation policy. The new taxation policy may have a big impact on how businesses operate and may also present new opportunities for businesses like EA. Second, the reduce in the cost of transportation. The reduced cost of transportation has led to cheaper shipping costs, which has reduced the company’s expenses and allowed it to use the money saved to supplement lacking resources or reward loyal customers. Third, the use of online platforms. The world’s transition to a digitalization has greatly benefited many businesses and given them the chance to expand their reach through online platforms. EA now has access to a more advantageous and cost-effective marketing channel because to the company’s strong online presence over the years. It can also take advantage of this as a chance to talk with clients and\n\n3\n\nlearn about their needs providing better customer services. Fourth, growth in the video-game industry. With the rise in global gaming popularity, the video game business is expanding. This provides a chance for video game companies to adopt marketing techniques that are current with trends to boost sales.\n\nThe company also has threats as it has increasing competition in the market. First, the growing competition. Although the number of players is increasing, there is also increased competition in the video game industry as tech powerhouses prepare to enter the market due to its profitable potential and expanding trend. Second, newer technologies. EA is threatened by the new technologies being produced by its rivals, and it is a struggle to outperform them.\n\nTechnologies such as better graphics and higher quality render is often competed by these big video-game companies. Third, the increase in isolationism. Similar responses from other nations may occur as a result of America’s growing economic isolationism. This would have a negative effect on its global sales. Fourth, increasing local distributors. Since the competition pays bigger sums to local distributors to boost their promotion and sales, it poses a threat to the business.\n\nFINDINGS AND DISCUSSION\n\nEvery company faces challenges and problems as growing a company business is a complicated in nature. EA is not excluded in these problem as it faces a couple challenges in the past years. However, for this case study, we will be looking at the problems of hackers and cheaters that exists particularly in multiplayer based games of EA called FIFA 22 which\n\nis a football game with microtransaction and online competing. This is a huge problem as it affects the reputation of EA as a competent video-game company making their loyal customer loses their trust in the company. Hackers and cheaters will also ruin their revenue as hackers will hack the game’s in-game currency that can only be bought with real money. This means the company will not gain benefit from their microtransactions. Other than that, some hackers would use the game’s leaderboard system to find out the top players’ information and then uses EA’s support system to claim the account locking out the actual owner of the account. The hacker would also delete or steal valuable items in the accounts making the owner loses progress and money from the account. This problem could cause the owner of the account\n\nlose their trust in EA making them loses a valuable customer.\n\nThere are various ways of dealing with these hackers. One of the ways is by allowing the game to install a third-party application or software to run in the background to ensure that the PC or platform is not running any hacks or cheats in the background. This is probably one of the most effective ways of to prevent hacks or cheats as it scans every file or folder in the\n\n4\n\nplatform for cheats. However, this also means that the players data is vulnerable to EA as this third-party software will be able to access anything that is running on the user’s PC at any time. Even if EA does not have malicious intention towards the user’s PC, the user would still be uncomfortable when it comes to installing the seemingly invasive software. The second possible way of dealing with these hackers are by blocking the cheater’s IP address from connecting to the server once the hacker has been detected. This will ensure that the cheater would not be able to connect to the EA servers making them unable to play the game at all. However, there is a quick way to get around this which is by using a virtual private network (VPN) which changes the user’s IP address making it impossible to block their connection to the servers. EA could also ban the accounts related to the hackers and the cheaters which\n\nmeans that they would have to get a second account and buy the game all over again. This method is used on most video-game. However, it is not very effective as the hacker could still create a new account once they made profit from hacking the in-game currencies or selling certain item from hacked account.\n\nI believe that the most effective way of handling these hackers is by applying two-factor authentication when a new login is detected. Two-factor authentication is a security protocol that requires a user to give two different authentication factors for self-verification. This means that a user would need to connect their account to a phone number or a different email. When a new login from a new device or different IP address is detected, the user would then have to check for a text message that sends a one-time code. The account can only be accessed once the password and code entered is accurate. This method is the most secured in my opinion as the code can only be known by the user’s personal phone number or email address. However, this security protocol does have flaw in which if the phone number is no longer available, the account could be locked forever and the user would have to contact the customer service for support. This could easily be avoided by using both phone number and email address as the second authentication factor.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTo conclude, after studying EA, we have learned that EA is one of the best video-game company in the market as of now. It has multiple strengths such as the employee’s professionality that keeps on delivering top tier games that provides satisfactions to their customers. However, there is also weaknesses that EA have to keep an eye on such as their growing competition and their lack of profitability that could pose a threat to the company. EA should also take opportunity of the growing gaming industry and new taxation policy to grow even bigger. EA also have hacker threats that threatens their customer’s trust on the\n\n5\n\ncompany’s competency and their revenue. However, we have concluded that this problem could be solved with a two-factor authentication that will ensure the only person to have access to the account is the owner himself.\n\nKTMB – Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nFrom this case study, I realized that even successful businesses have their own set of problems. I was able to research some elements of the business, including its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and use this information as a tool to monitor the issues and make suggestions for change. In general, we discovered a few issues with this company, such as the fact that KTM Northern station does not take the Komuter Link Card or the Touch ‘n Go card, unlike KTM Southern station. Hence, there are a few alternative solutions that has been recommended to the company for their business to improve in order to have a better future in the business field. The company can apply these alternatives in order to advance the company.\n\n1.0 COMPANY INFORMATION\n\n1.1 Background\n\nFor more than a century, Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) has operated as Malaysia’s primary railway company. Prior to 1962, Keretapi Tanah Melayu was known as the Federated Malay States Railway Administration (FMSR) and the Malayan Railway Administration (MRA). Three decades later, in 1992, the name was changed to Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB). The government of Malaysia continues to be the only owner of the corporation despite its corporatization. The Taiping to Port Weld section of Malaysia’s first railway line was opened in 1885. Currently, Peninsular Malaysia’s West Coast and East Coast are covered by the KTMB route.\n\nKTMB is one of the first electrified commuter train service in Malaysia with length of track gauge of 1,000 mm which equals to a total distance of 1,677 km. The gauge railway network consists of two main lines and several branch lines. As of 1982, the Kerdau-Jerantut and Sungai Yu-Tumpat lines had replaced their wooden sleepers with a ballasted system and locally built concrete sleepers. Although KTMB is known for its great rail services, the company has encountered numerous issues during the course of its operations.\n\n1.2 Organizational Structure\n\n1.3 Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad Services\n\n• Electric train shuttle (ETS)\n\nETS is operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad and uses numerous electric units. It is the fastest metre gauge train service in Malaysia that currently operates along the electrified and double-tracked stretch of the West Coast Line between Gemas and Padang Besar on the Malaysia-Thai border by the Malaysian national railway operator, Kereta Api Tanah Melayu. On electrified metre gauge rail lines, trains can reach speeds of up to 160 km/h (99 mph), which might be referred to as higher speed rail using passenger rail terminology rather than high speed rail.\n\n• KTM Intercity\n\nKeretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad operates a number of diesel-hauled intercity train services under the brand name KTM Intercity in Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand (KTMB). The capital of Malaysia’s Kuala Lumpur Sentral station is where the majority of services are offered.\n\n• Commuter\n\nKTM Commuter is a commuter rail service brand in Malaysia operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM). It was introduced in 1995 to provide local rail services in Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding suburban areas in the Klang Valley. The service was then introduced in the northern Peninsular Malaysia states of Kedah, Perak and Pulau Pinang in September 2015 after the completion of the Ipoh-Padang Besar Electrification and Double-Tracking Project.\n\n• The Skypark Link\n\nThe Skypark Link is a train service that connects you to the Skypark Terminal Subang Airport. This service will be very practical, time-saving, and cost-effective for people who use the KL Sentral – Subang Jaya – Terminal Skypark Route. This is yet another choice available to tourists as well as locals who live and work at or close to the Skypark Terminal.\n\n• KTM Cargo\n\nKTM Cargo provides cargo services that are safe and reliable, with a network that is highly accessible form seaports and inland Container Depot (ICD) as well as urban and rural areas, it is a cost-effective way to move you goods. Our cargo services are suitable for high-risk material, as it comes complete with insurance coverage. We have a variety of wagons to suit your cargo needs. Generally, cargo is moved either in open or covered wagons. However, in the future, all covered wagons will be replaced with containers to allow flexibility in the sense that the goods can be dismounted from the train and delivered directly to the customers’ premises thus, living up to the concept of door-to-door delivery.\n\n1.4 Business, marketing, operational strategy\n\nPromotions are one of the business strategies used by Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad. Electric Train Service (ETS) commuters were eligible for 50 and 25 percent discounts from KTMB in November 2018. According to the New Straits Time article, the promotion was made to encourage more people to use ETS. The discount was valid for travel on the KL Sentral-Gemas\n\nKL Sentral and Sungai Petani-Padang Besar-Sungai Petani ETS routes from Monday to Thursday.\n\n• KTMB Ladies-Only Commuter Coach\n\nWhen using the KTM Komuter Service, female passengers have the option of travelling in the Ladies Coach, which is reserved especially for them in order to reduce the possibility of sexual harassment in a crowded setting. On April 28, 2010, the Ladies Coach was officially introduced by the KTMB, due to the fact that 60% of KTM Komuter riders are female.\n\n• KTMi-Card Student\n\nThe ‘Komuter Link’ card and the KTMi-Card Student are two additional concession cards that KTMB offers to certain of its target users. Students who use the ETS train and KTM Intercity services often can purchase a KTMi-Card Student. This card offers a 40% travel fare savings. When purchasing tickets, the student must present this card and their ID.\n\n• Komuter Link Card\n\nNext, Komuter Link card is a Stored Value Card that is used to pay users journey made on the KTM Commuter. At the exit gate, the stored value of the card is deducted by the fare. This card is available at all KTM Ticketing counters and ticket kiosks for RM5.\n\n2.0 COMPANY ANALYSIS\n\nTHREAT\n\nSince its first operation, KTM Komuter has adopted the paper ticket system. It later introduced the ‘Touch n Go’ pre-paid stored value plastic-card-based ticket system to overcome some of the problems relating to inadequate ticket counters and high utilization of ticket vending machine during peak hours. However, only the KTM Komuter Klang Valley, which is in the Southern sector, has this technology in place. The Northern sector, however, does not accept the Komuter Link Card or the Touch ‘n Go card. Users still need to order tickets at counter that will cause queuing time for passengers buying tickets or user can purchase through the KTMB Integrated Ticketing System (KITS) online, however this causes heavy traffic because so many people are using the system at once. Additionally, whether reserving a ticket using the KTMB Application or website, online banking is not an available payment method. Even though debit or credit cards, Touch n Go eWallets, KTM Wallets, and Boost can all be used to purchase tickets, some individuals prefer the online banking payment method.\n\n3.0 FINDING\n\nFor the problem of KTMB ticketing system, what should be implemented are using specialized card or use mobile wallets and enhance an existing application or website.\n\nIt would be advantageous if the KTM Southen sector could use a cashless system by using the Komuter Link card or Touch n Go similar to the Southen station. To eliminate the requirement for users to bring their actual bank cards, it would be preferable if all KTM stations could take mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay.\n\nIt is essential for KTM to improve services in all areas, especially at the Northern service station, if they want to lead other public transportation services like buses and cabs. The company need to enhancing the e-Ticket and Touch n Go and system. An existing application also need to be improved such as enhancing a better user interface design and user experience of mobile train ticket application. Users can easily purchase a train ticket without required to take a long time of learning and quickly use the proposed design app again.\n\nsyarikat yg tidak boleh utk assignment Case Study ENT600\n\nAir Asia\n\nApple\n\nBSN\n\nAmazon\n\nCanon\n\nDiaso\n\nFoodpanda\n\nGrab\n\nIkea\n\nJ&T\n\nLalamove\n\nmiHoyo\n\nMonaliza\n\nNestle\n\nPos Malaysia\n\nSamsung\n\nSani Express\n\nSecrete Recipe\n\nShopee\n\nStarbuck\n\nXiomi\n\nYTL Corporation (banyak lg.. tunggu)"
