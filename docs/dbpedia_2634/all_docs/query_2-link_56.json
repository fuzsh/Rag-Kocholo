        "text": "Kinta District Administrative Complex, Batu Gajah (18 June, 2011)\n\nKinta District Administrative Complex (GPS: 4.47716, 101.03551), or Komplekx Pentadbiran Daerah Kinta, is a complex of government offices in the Changkat neighbourhood of Batu Gajah, Perak. It was built in 1892 at the cost of $20,000, during the British administration of the Perak.\n\nThe construction of the Kinta District Administrative Complex put Batu Gajah on the map. At the time of its construction, Batu Gajah was a major tin mining town, and tin wealth translated into new roads and beautifully landscaped parks, particularly in the Changkat neighbourhood, albeit built using convict labour.\n\nThe Kinta District Administrative Complex includes offices for various government departments included among others the Land Office, the Magistrate court, the Treasury and the Tax Collectors office.\n\nAlong with the administrative complex, the British administrators also built the the Batu Gajah Hospital, which comprises the European Hospital (for whites only) and the District Hospital (for everyone else). This was where the present Sultan of Perak, Sultan Azlan Shah, was born on 19 April, 1928, and pop artist Amy Mastura on 10 May 1971.\n\n360&deg View of the Kinta District Administrative Complex on Google Maps Street View\n\nBatu Gajah Hospital\n\nThe Kinta District Administrative Complex is on the Map of Batu Gajah, Perak\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nKinta Valley, Pioneering Malaysia's Modern Development, by Khoo Salma Nasution & Abdur-Razzaq Lubis ISBN 983-42113-0-9\n\nList of Government Buildings in Perak and Government Buildings in Malaysia\n\nLatest updates on Penang Travel Tips\n\nDiscover with Timothy YouTube Channel\n\nPG Food Channel\n\nLearn Penang Hokkien YouTube Channel\n\nSojiMart Videos\n\nSongs about Penang\n\nAbout this website\n\nHello and thanks for reading this page. My name is Timothy and my hobby is in describing places so that I can share the information with the general public. My website has become the go to site for a lot of people including students, teachers, journalists, etc. whenever they seek information on places, particularly those in Malaysia and Singapore. I have been doing this since 5 January 2003, for over twenty years already. You can read about me at Discover Timothy. By now I have compiled information on thousands of places, mostly in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, and I continue to add more almost every day. My goal is to describe every street in every town in Malaysia and Singapore."
