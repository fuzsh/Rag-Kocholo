When she learns about an upcoming \"Puteri Impian\" (\"Dream Princess\") competition, she submits her name as an applicant. She is overjoyed when she is picked as the winner, in which she will be given an all-expense-paid experience as Princess for one week, during which her exploits will be filmed for the \"Puteri Impian\" television show.\n\nNora revels in the experience, where she is given a thorough makeover and lives luxuriantly in the Istana Hotel (lit: Palace Hotel). The only shortcoming of the experience is her cameraman, Zulkifli, who immediately antagonizes her and mocks her for her wide-eyed naivety. However, Zulkifli's warning comes true when, during an event that Nora officiates as a princess, she is jeered at by onlookers who point out that she is nothing more than a dressed up nobody.\n\nMatters become complicated when Nora crosses paths with Tengku Faizal, who is a real prince. Tengku Faizal is enchanted by Nora's simple ways and sweet demeanor, and the two start dating. Zulkifli reacts to this jealously, to which Nora responds by using Tengku Faizal to keep Zulkifli at bay. When Tengku Faizal's parents learn that the prince is considering proposing to Nora, the Queen confronts Nora directly to let her know their disapproval.\n\nThe film ends with Nora, wiser from the experience, rejecting Tengku Faizal's proposal and returning to her simple life as a factory worker after the show ends. Zulkifli approves of her decision, but does not approach her.\n\nCast\n\n* Amy Mastura as Nora\n\n* Cico Harahap as Zulkifli\n\n* Nor Aliah Lee as Nancy\n\n* Hairie Othman as Tengku Faizal\n\n* Kuman as the Cameraman\n\n* Azwan Ali as TV Presenter\n\n* Sophia Ibrahim as the Queen\n\noundtrack\n\nAlthough the film does not have an official soundtrack, actress Amy Mastura released a studio album titled \"Puteri\", which contains a number of songs that were used in the film.
