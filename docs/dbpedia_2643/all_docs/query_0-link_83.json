        "text": "A Visit to The Hepworth :D\n\nI recently took an refreshing trip to The Hepworth in Wakefield, an interesting art gallery that was named after one of the main art contributors called Barbara Hepworth, who was born in Wakefield in 1903. It is a contemporary building overlooking the historic waterfront area on the banks of the River Calder that runs through the heart of Wakefield.\n\nOn this trip I took quite a few photos of artistic objects that caught my eye and this gave me a good base to form a blog post. Here are some of said photos:\n\nNo Man's Land - Created By Charles Sargeant Jagger in 1919\n\nThis was a plaster frieze that Charles Sargeant Jagger created over a years period form 1918 to 1919. He used his personal experience of the battlefield from his horrific times in Gallipoli to construct this mural-like artpeice. No Man's Land depicts a lone look-out using the horrific deaths and mangled, mutilated bodies as a cover. I found this interesting because it really describes what the reality of war was like - no honour, no brave heroics, just a grim battle for survival. This art is obviously contextually influenced by the great war and its purpose is to reveal the harsh reality to the public.\n\nCrab - Created by Bernard Meadows in 1980\n\nThis bronze sculpture was inspired by Bernard's war time service in the Royal Air Force on the Cocos Islands. There he found inspiration from the different forms of creatures such as this crab, and decided to sculpt them. I find them quite interesting because of the smooth shapes and surfaces he has created using the hard material - I would imagine it would be quite hard to achieve a look like this because you certainly can't do this with a hammer and chisel.\n\nThis is an old poster for an exhibition by Henry Moore, a legendary English sculpture and artist that was born in Castleford (whoop, go Yorkshire). Considering his father worked in the coal mines, I found it quite surprising that he became such a success from these sorts of beginnings. Not that being poor is bad or anything. I'll be quiet now...\n\nThis was a coal miner's sketch which again is contextually influenced by the main occupation of that time (1942). I quite like this sketch as it uses a different technique to visually record the miners - Henry Moore used a pencil, pen (& ink), wax coloured crayon and water coloured was on paper.\n\nSomew of the many smooth, refined sculptures Barbara Hepworth has created over her lifetime. Although these looked really cool and impressed me with the amount of effort put into them, I didn't really understand what they were meant to represent most of the time. It was pretty refreshing, actually.\n\nThis was a really cool piece of art conceived by Eduardo Paolozzi in 1971. It is called B.A.S.H, and it instantly caught my eye due to the bright, vibrant, psychedelic colours that reminded me of the 60's. This piece is heavily influenced by the decade and the happenings of the late 60's such as the colour scheme - it has derived from the hip, summer-of-love colour style that was big in the 'swinging' 60's. Paolozzi is a well-known sculpture, but he often devised screenprints such as this to help form sculpting ideas. This screenprint was one of the most detailed, complex and intracet designs he ever produced, with subjects that re-appear in his work time and time again: J.F.K, robots, telephones, lava lamps and Maryln Monroe. It is quite strange because it is an interesting blend of retro and phycedelia.\n\nThis last photograph is of weird suits of armour and contextual objects from different periods of time all contained in a camouflage sand pit. I think this was an attempt at combining many different contextual time periods into one, and I don't have a clue what it is supposed to represent or what the statement is (or if it is even expressing one).\n\nOverall I enjoyed my experience at The Hepworth and recommend it to anyone looking for a refreshing artistic break. So go now!\n\nWhat is American Realism?\n\nAmerican Realism was not just a fine art movement but a movement that spread into music and literature too. It was all about depicting real life within America so at the time and was heavily influenced by it's current culture in the early 20th Century. A few examples of subjects painted and portrayed could be a scenic view of New York or a boxing match. Anything and everything that was trending at the time was fair game for this movement's artists who tried their best to define what was real. As America grew larger as time passed by, American Realists were more inclined to create more urban works than rural as the cities were ever growing and evolving (especially near the coming of the new century). American Realism has inspired lots of different art styles and movements playing an important part in art history. An example of this is that it heavily inspired the Ashcan School movement which had a similiar group philosophy. Here are some of the works of an American Realist back in the day:\n\nGeorge Bellows\n\nGeorge bellows was arguably one of the most prolific painters in the American Realism movement, creating a wide variety of interesting real life depictions of the American way of life. I enjoy reeling through his work because not only is each piece aesthetically sound and impressive, but its like taking a step back in time with each picture. George Bellows even obtained his own studio on Broadway before he died in 1925 at the age of 42. He lived and died in the city he loved, and you can clearly sense this in his works I have hand picked below...\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: https://ephemeralnewyork.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/cliffdwellersbellows.jpg)\n\nCliff Dwellers - Created by George Bellows in 1913\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/culture_test/barra_dempseypainting_post.jpg)\n\nDempsey & Firpo - Created by George Bellows in 1924\n\nThis piece was George Bellow's masterpiece. I think it is a quite memorable painting as the amount of detail and subtle brush strokes included in this painting is truly striking. I think he has captured this energetic moment in time perfectly as there is a strong sense of movement which I discovered is quite hard to achieve in paintings. This is not only one of the best pieces from George and American Realism, but it was also a famous boxing match that rocked American culture and history.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://mydailyartdisplay.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/blue-snow-battery-by-george-bellows.jpg)\n\nBlue Snow Battery - Created by George Bellows in 1910\n\nI chose this painting because it shows the high detail and attention Bellows has put into the different textures of the snow which is awesome! He has nailed the colours making it really look like a window to the past...\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/George_Bellows_-_New_York.jpg)\n\nNew York - Created by George Bellows in 1911\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/George_Bellows_-_New_York_(detail)_1.jpg)\n\nNew York (Detail) - Created by George Bellow in 1911\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.oilpaintingsgallery.com/ProdImages/Barnyard-and-Chickens.jpg)\n\nBarnyard and Chickens - Created by George Bellows in 1924\n\nThis was an interesting piece by George because it was created using oil pastels instead of paint, coloured pencils etc. Using oil pastels instead of the traditional techniques has created an interesting, soft texture that compliments the image no end as it too uses soft, light and vibrant colours. I think George was using this peice to experiment because he used not only just a different technique but a different setting too - and in my opinion this experiment was a success.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.the-athenaeum.org/art/display_image.php?id=186715)\n\nForth and Back - Created By George Bellows in 1913\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.the-athenaeum.org/art/detail.php?ID=97713)\n\nAt The Dog Show - Created by George Bellows, date unknown\n\nThis chalk drawing created by George looks to have come form the early 20th century and I find it quite intriguing. This is because you don't see many artists drawing with chalk to such a high detail, and this works brilliantly because it gives an old traditionally feel to the image. George Bellows has captured this moment in time using a different technique to most artists of the same period, so I think this proves he was a very innovative chap. As with most of his works I have chosen (and yes I realise there is quite a lot of them), I find the contrast between America now and then striking and we owe this to the American Realism Movement because this would have never happened if they chose not to capture and define real day-to-day situations.\n\nAlthough the visual aesthetics and techniques contrast, I think after all these years you can still compare American Realism to the work of modern day designers like Julian Opie. This is because of the philosophy, not the actual images they create. What I mean by this is that although each designer's work may look and feel quite different when compared to one another, they have both tried to present and depict the culture and real life subjects of the time.\n\nA Quick Guide on the YBA\n\nWho are the YBA?\n\nThe YBA are more commonly known as the Young British Artists or Britart, and are a group of British artists who first began exhibiting their work deep in London in 1988. Most of the artists were fine art graduates from university, and so this influenced some of their work. They are mainly known for using strange and varied materials from unmade beds to preservation liquid, and they often use shock tactics which is highly controversial within the public. Here is some of their work below...\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.damienhirst.com/mother-and-child-divided-1)\n\nMother and Child Divided - Created by Damien Hirst in 1993\n\n(All credit for this image goes to:http://www.damienhirst.com/the-anatomy-of-an-angel)\n\nThe Anatomy of an Angel - Created by Damien Hirst in 2008\n\nDamien Hirst\n\nPersonally I don't like Damein Hirst's artistic views. His work consists of taking something naturally beautiful like a mother and child or an angel and poisoning it with a dark morbidity. I think this is a shock tactic the YBA have become famous for but I don't morally agree with what he has done and although it can be considered art as it makes you think about the piece itself this definitely does not mean I agree with it.\n\nHowever this doesn't mean I don't like the way he presents his work as this itself is quite clever as it is contextually influenced by society at the time. For instance, Damien uses a lot of shock tactics in his work to get people riled up and talking about it. But in 1993 I think society was not ready to accept something like a cow being sawed in half and labelled as art, therefore their outrage gave the piece fame and popularity for just how shocking it was. If he had waited 20 or so years and exhibited the 'Mother and Child Divided' artwork now, I don't think it would have caused as much of a stir as society is getting used to weird, shocking art. So well done Damien for rocking the art world of the 1990's!\n\nTracey Emin\n\nTracey Emin is another famous British member of the YBA who also uses shock tactics but in a completely different manner to Damien. Instead of using a morbid theme she shocks the public by basing her works around a very personal sexual nature. Like Damien, she has cleverly released her artwork when the public was not ready for it - this meant more controversy grew because it contrasted against the current public views on art and therefore became more famous (or rather infamous). The works below are quite good examples of what Tracey Emin creates as part of the YBA.\n\nThe first two images are photographs of a tent which contains the names of every single person she has slept with. Weird, right? Well, as I have already mentioned it really took the world of art by surprise when she released it in 1995 and caused great controversy, staying true to the YBA's style. As its something different to a painting or a drawing like the majority of artists concoct, I find its simplicity quite pleasing. it is what it is - A tent with names stitched inside. However just because it is a simple idea this does not mean it fails as a peice of art. Yes it looks a bit crap anaesthetically but all great art makes you think, and this is the ace up the tents sleeve. On closer inspection, I feel that Tracey Emin is using a spotlight on her past experiences to show the public the bad points of human behaviour. In short, I don't think this is just a piece of artwork - I think it's a statement Tracey Emin is making.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Emin-Tent-Exterior.jpg)\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963 - 1995 - Created By Tracey Emin in 1995\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.royaljellyfactory.com/davidbarrett/articles/images/arttext/arttext-sensation.jpg)\n\nEveryone I Have Ever Slept With 1963 - 1995 - Created by Tracey Emin in 1995\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.saatchigallery.com/imgs/artists/emin-tracey/tracey-emin-my-bed.jpg)\n\nMy Bed - Created by Tracey Emin in 1998\n\nThis was another one of Tracey Emin's life-sized models. Similiar to the tent, I think you need to think about what the work means not how it looks. If you do this, you will not see a disgusting bedroom full of used condoms, booze and fag butts but another strong statement Tracey Emin is making. She is combining her own experiences with a sense of humiliation to point out the honest flaws of human behaviour.\n\nPersonally, I don't like Tracey Emin's works because although it makes you ponder about many things it doesn't look good whatsoever and it is a personal opinion of mine that good art has this quality.\n\nYBA and Dada\n\nThere are quite a few similiarities between Dada and YBA, the most obvious being that they both use shock tactics within their work to gain popularity. I think with Dada however this shock element is overall a bit more subtle and less 'in-your-face' like the works of YBA. Who knows, maybe YBA had been contextually influenced by the post WW1 art movement Dada and this was what spurred on the shock tactics within their own work?\n\nThe Difference Between Fine Art & Graphic Design\n\nToday I am going to talk about some of the main characteristics of Fine Art and Graphics. I am going to compare the two together as there can be a lot of misunderstandings when it comes to telling which is which. I have also been busying researching some Graphic Designers and Fine Artists to use as examples to back up these points, so if you're ready, lets dive in.\n\nJulian Opie\n\nJulian Opie is a 'visual artist', so called because although his work is quite similar to a lot of the aspects of Graphic Design, it is still considered fine art because of the processes, techniques and purpose his work presents. Born in 1958, Julian showed a great affection for art and design, graduating from Goldsmith's School of Art in 1982 at the age of 24. From here he has built up his own creative empire, full of exhibitions not only in London but across the world. He his also well known for being a part of the 'New British Sculpture' art movement that formed in the early 1980's. This art movement focused on using the decaying UK environment as inspiration and using colour and humour to explore the way in which objects represent different meanings. Here is some of his work below...\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.julianopie.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/large-iphone/artwork/rollin.2014.web_-430315.png)\n\nRollin - By Julian Opie in 2014\n\nThe above image was created using a traditional fine art method - painting. This surprised me at first because it really looks like something created digitally like Illustrator or Photoshop as the smoothness of the colours and the lack of visible brush strokes lead me to believe so. Since this was hand painted by Julian Opie, I really like the effort and amount of detail he has worked into this portrait of a woman from the sleek, multi-coloured hairstyle to the shadow and light effects he has brought to life on her face I think he has done a really good job here. In most of his work I have noticed he is also very ware of the colours he uses keeping them not to vivid or strong but not to faded either, knowing what colours suit what and work well together to portray what he wants them to portray. This knowledge was probably developed during the early stages of NBS (New British Sculpture) as they are well known for experimenting with colours in different ways to present humour. In this image, he has kept to using quite bleak oil pastel like colours - a lot of which can be found quite easily on Illustrator or Photoshop. I do not know if Julian intended this piece to look like it had been digitally made as a way to further impress the observer or not, but I keep thinking it is something graphical every time I look at it. This is not true however because it does not communicate information or a message across to the user. The major purpose of the piece is to get you lost in thought on nothing but the painting.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to:http://www.julianopie.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/large-iphone/artwork/picture_47-1210726.png)\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.julianopie.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/large-iphone/artwork/picture_45-733489.png)\n\n'Sweet Compositions' & 'Painting Blue's - Created by Julian Opie in 1984\n\nThese two pieces are actual sculptures made by Julian Opie in his early days as a graphic designer. Like I mentioned earlier, in 1984 Julian was starting to explore his own art style, and when you compare the quality and content of colour in these two images to the piece before, you can see how his understanding of colour has developed over time; here they are more vivid, brighter and textured. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though as they work well with the sculptures they are used on. I really like how he has used a new and different process to express his art, one that means a real life object is actually created for you to interpret first hand. This reminds me of Henri Matisse & Jen Stark who I wrote about last week who also decided to use sculpturing as a way to capture their own imagination. Who knows, perhaps Julian Opie was also inspired by different art movements and artists like Henri Matisse and decided to try his own hand at sculpturing? If this were true, this could have been one of the main contributions towards the beginnings of NBS, and the art it has given us (and still gives) today? Of course this is all just speculation, but it just goes to show how famous artists and art movements of the past can influence and affect the artists of the present. Rant over!\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.julianopie.com/)\n\nJulian Opie's Homepage - Created I assume when his website begun...\n\nI have chosen Julian's homepage as an example as Julian Opie has still created this interesting idea inspired by the past and shown it to the world, albeit on a website rather than an exhibition. I find his homepage the best page of the website because it is an interactive art piece that takes inspiration from objects of the old British past. It has linked each object to a different page on his site, so if you hover your mouse over the 'Music' tab on the website the violin tilts upwards towards you, and if you hover over 'Map' the globe spins around in the painting. I really like this as it makes the whole painting quite literally come to life before your eyes and it has taken inspiration from the past which is what this blog is about (well, er... sort of).\n\nPatrick Caulfield\n\nPatrick Caulfield was a painter and printmaker born in West London in 1936. In his youth he actually joined the R.A.F until at the age of 20, he decided to enrol at the Chelsea School of Art until 1960. This begun him on an artistic career he would have never imagined. He died in 2005 leaving many artists devastated, as well as losing their source of inspiration. Some of his distinguished work is still in the galleries and collections of people like David Bowie. Here is some of his work...\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.ultravie.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Patrick-Caulfield-After-Lunch-1975-Tate.jpg)\n\nAs we can see in the image above Patrick Caulfield has a strange, unique way of expressing his art. He was well known for his use of photography and images within images like in the piece above. I think this is a creative way of thinking about things as he could have just blocked out the window or produced it the same way the rest of the image has been created but instead he has chosen to add a photograph, something that seems completely alien to its surroundings and plopped it where the window is. The photograph is so strange because it diverts your attention towards it, holding the most colour in the image. I think Patrick has done this intentionally, keeping the rest of the room a submissive blue so that the photo would take priority in the end. I also find Patrick's interest in geometric lines and shapes in his work overwhelming and I think this just goes to show how differently he looked at not only his art, but the world.\n\nAfter Lunch - Created by Patrick Caulfield in 1975\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/P/P04/P04098_10.jpg)\n\nVase On Display - Created by Patrick Caulfield in 1971\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/P/P79/P79199_10.jpg)\n\nDuck - Created by Patrick Caulfield in 1994\n\nThe two images I have chosen above are other famous artworks Patrick completed before his untimely death in 2005. The 'Vase On Display' is a classic example of Patrick's art style as he took simple objects such as vases and chairs, dissected them with geometric lines and gave them simple colours and black outlines, sharing his views with the world. I have never really seen this style before but I quite like how it looks overall - its simple but it works really well. I suppose you could say it was a little boring however as over his lifetime he repeated this style of art time and time over on a whole manner of different objects that he was influenced by at the time.\n\nI have chosen the 'Duck' artwork as an example of how (in my opinion) he finally broke the same artistic pattern he followed for years. In this image he has tried something different rather than getting an object and recording it using geometric lines. Here he has actually painted a living duck, and instead of using various lines and shapes he has used a contrast between black and white to create a sense of water within the artwork, even though technically none can be seen. I really like this piece due to my love of all simple but effective art, but I think this was a landmark for Patrick since he hadn't really created anything like this before. True to his style, there are still tell-tale signs this is one of Patrick's workings. For example in the centre of the piece there is a mysterious curvy shape that although fits the artwork in shape and flow, doesn't really resemble anything that should be on a lake in my opinion. This links to Patrick because he is well-known for including things in his artwork that common sense says shouldn't belong, but using different techniques he MAKES it belong which is really interesting.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://chipkidd.com/journal/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/jurassic-park-book-cover-chip-kidd.jpg)\n\nChip Kidd\n\nChip Kidd is a modern Graphic designer that I think can be loosely linked to the two of the designers I have already mentioned, however this time he is a graphic designer, not an artist. Chip Kidd is a famous American author, editor, book jacket producer and creator of other great graphical designs. He mainly specialises in book jackets and covers, the most popular design being the book of Jurassic Park. If you have been living under a rock for the last couple of decades you probably wouldn't know that the film version of Jurassic Park became a box office hit in Hollywood becoming popular worldwide for being 'that movie where dinosaurs go on a rampage and eat people'.\n\nAnyway, as you can see above I have chosen Chip's famous book cover design of Jurassic Park as an example to help explain what the difference between fine art and graphics is. A book cover has two major purposes - to be aesthetically pleasing and to express important information such as the name of the author and/or book. I think Chip has achieved both these purposes well by using a simple but explanatory design. I also think you could link Chip with Julien Opie and Patrick Caulfield as they have both used simple ideas and designs to creat something graphically brilliant like Chip has.\n\nIn addition, I think Chip Kidd has been contextually influenced by what was trended at the time, the result of which creating the work above. Since Jurassic Park became so popular at the time, Chip Kidd would have been influenced by its popularity into creating this boook jacket. This sounds a bit daft but think of it this way: If Jurassic Park didn't become as well known as it did and fell into the ranks of just another book and movie adaptation, would Chip still have created a book jacket for it? We will never know but it's an interesting thought on the matter.\n\nSo What's The Difference?\n\nThe main difference between Fine Art and Graphic Design is the purposes of each. Fine Art mainly concentrates on what and how the piece will make you feel and think where as a graphics is more using images and aesthetically pleasing objects to communicate a message to the viewer. So an example of a fine artist is someone like Patrick Caulfield or Julien Opie because their their work doesn't contain a message to the viewer. It only wants to make you ponder about the work itself. On the other hand, a good example of a graphics designer is someone like Chip Kidd, of whom has produced work that displays important messages and information such as titles and authors along with images and objects to give a hint of what the book is about.\n\nDada - The Movement That Took The Piss\n\nToday I will be talking about Dada, a movement that originated just after the first world war. It was created by artists who did not like the way society was heading after the horrors of the war, and so their work was solely made to provoke an emotional response from the public. The more famous pieces include a urinal and a moustache drawn on the Mona Lisa! Confused? Let me show you some examples...\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://amccourt.public.iastate.edu/skillconsol/images/monalisa.jpg)\n\nL.H.O.O.Q (In French these letters pronounced loosly translate as 'She is hot in the ass') - Created by Marcel Duchamp in 1919\n\nThis piece above was the work of Marcel Duchamp, who if you have been paying attention to my blog you would know is a famous cubist artist. However this was before the war so by the time it came and past it changed his attitude towards society and art massively so he helped create the Dada movement. The work above is a 'readymade' which is art that has already been created, changing it insignificantly and calling it your own basically. The Mona Lisa is considered one of the most famous paintings out there created by the legendary Leonardo Da Vinci so to take his work and paint a goatee and moustache on it and then give it a provoking name like 'She's hot in the ass' caused an absolute outrage in society. This is what Dada was all about - provoking a negative response from the public so that they would change where they were heading. In the book 'The Rise of the Sixties' it says ''Dada often recycled the current culture and re-used it to create their own statements in collages and other mediums.''\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u302/nonpareil_photo/fountain.jpg)\n\nFountain - Created by Marcel Duchamp in 1917\n\nThis piece by Duchamp also caused quite a stir when he put it on a spot for one of his exhibitons - he wanted people to see the craftmanship behind the urinal's design because although you wouldn't think about it somebody at some time has sat down, thought about the curves and designed it. The reason it caused such a fuss was because this was totally against all the traditional sides of art the people had just adjusted to like cubism. To sum up, Dada was a completely bonkers but considered art movement that wanted to rebel against and shock the world.\n\nWhat do I think of Dada?\n\nPersonally I think the cause is just and the artwork acheives its purpose well. They really did shock and outrage the public and that was the whole point. However apart from the two famous pieces above, I can't find any other work that acheives that purpose and so as an art movement I don't think it was a successful as it could have been. For example examine the image below....\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/images/dada_berlin_08.jpg )\n\nCut With The Kitchen Knife - Created by Hannah Hoch in 1919\n\nAlthough this photomontage created by Hannah is very interesting and contains lots of inspiration and subjects of her surroundings and society, nothing in it really shocks the viewer in my opinion. This could be because now that I am looking back on a changed society I can't pick out anything that could shock anyone at the time. If that isn't the case I cannot see the point of what Hannah has done here and this is the same for other Dada artists too.\n\nHave Any Artists Been Influenced by Dada Since?\n\nYes, quite a few people have been influenced by the way Dada provoked an emotional response using objects at the time. People like Julien Vallee, who as you can see below has used a plant and a lollipop to create something visually interesting which provokes an emotional response. This response is not necessarily negative like they are with Dada, but it IS a response from the public and this is what the piece has set out to achieve, just like Dada.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://valleeduhamel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ValleeDuhamel_HermesMetamorphose_19.jpg)\n\nHermes Metamorphose - Created by Julien Vallee quite recently...\n\nAll About Cubism - Where Do I Begin?\n\nToday I am going to talk about Cubism, a very unique and surprisingly recognisable art movement that formed in the early days of the 20th century.\n\nWhat is Cubism?\n\nCubism is an extremely influential art movement that was led by artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque around the region of 1910. As the name implies, it involves the use of blocky, patchy textures and strokes to create an interesting looks of chosen subjects. The philosophy behind this is quite complex, but in basic terms what Picasso and Braque were trying to accomplish was to give people a new way of seeing and depicting objects. In the early days of the movement the paintings are 2D/flattened mish-mashes of angles, shapes and lines and a limited colour pallet. However later on the movement began to evolve allowing more flexible colour pallets and different textures to the point where they began to look more like collages.\n\nAnalytic Cubism\n\nThere are two types of cubism - Analytical and Synthetic. Unlike traditional paintings of still life and landscapes cubism wasn't supposed to be realistic or life like - instead the artist would look at each and every angle of the subject and include fragments from each view into the final form. This was the artists way of giving a better explanation as to was the object was and what it meant. This was called Analytical Cubism and included pieces like the work seen below.\n\n'Le Pigeon Aux Petits Pois' A.K.A 'The Pigeon With Green Peas' - Created by Pablo Picasso in 1911.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/63/Picasso_-_Le_pigeon_aux_petits_pois_1911.jpg)\n\n'Les Baigneuses' A.K.A 'The Bathers' - Created by Albert Gleizes in 1912.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://images.travelpod.com/tw_slides/ta01/226/da8/albert-gleizes-les-baigneuses-paris.jpg)\n\n'Portrait Of Ambroise Vollard' - Created by Pablo Picasso in 1910.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-ambroise-vollard-1910.jpg)\n\n'Nude Descending A Staircase' - Created by Marcel Duchamp in 1912.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://allart.biz/up/photos/album/D/Marcel_Duchamp/marcel_duchamp_1_nude_descending_a_staircase_no_2.jpg)\n\nI find this style of cubism quite interesting because I quite enjoy trying to figure out what the subject is and then piecing together why the artist has presented it that way. At first the paintings look like chaos but when you look deeper and if you look long enough you begin to understand a little why the artist created it the way he did.\n\nSynthetic Cubism\n\nSynthetic Cubism is different to Analytical because it is uses a wider, broader range of colours and real life textures combined with a sense of layers instead of a flat 2d surface of a broken down subject. Synthetic Cubism was a later stage of the Cubism Movement, but it was still very influential and gave birth to creations such as the ones below.\n\n'The Open Window' - Created by Juan Gris in 1917\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.artyfactory.com/art_appreciation/still_life/gris/open_window_rue_ravignan.jpg)\n\nI quite like synthetic cubism because it generally used a wider range of colours and textures and in my opinion this made the piece as a whole more interesting when interpreting it. Although they were still pretty busy and full, they seemed to scale down a little too all the while sticking to the main principals of Cubism.\n\nHow did Cubism come about?\n\nA huge inspiration for the birth of Cubism came form the works of a then famous French artist called Paul Cezanne. His works of actual real life objects and surroundings without a general purpose other than to please the eye was not really explored before the 19th century and so his artwork shed light on a whole different area of art, causing a new revolution within the art industry. Never before his time came work like he produced or artists that thought like he did, so this really struck a cord with people and caught on. His work inspired the forefathers of Cubism (Picasso and Braque) so much that they decided to base a new art movement from it with different views and principals on their surroundings and discovered subjects. Here was some of the work Paul created...\n\nThere are still a large amount of artists and graphic designers who still use an element of cubism in their work, such as En Kure below. En Kure is a Malaysian graphic design student who has been contextual influenced by Cubism. He must have liked the interesting designs and philosophy behind cubism as he too has included it in his own work below.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: https://www.behance.net/gallery/snake-cobra-cubismpolygon/10518437)\n\nCobra Cubism - Created by En Kure in 2013\n\nI really like this design as it combines cubism, a well-known yet unique style of art and design with the contemporary technological advances of today. This whole design was completed using Adobe Illustrator instead of a traditional paintbrush, however it still looks cool and visually unique like the other cubism pieces of the past.\n\nThe Links Between Bacon and Trochut\n\nThis week I have decided to talk about Francis Bacon, a famous Irish artist born in 1902 who stormed the art world with his controversial but intriguing artwork. I'm also going to talk a little about how he links with a more recent, modern artist called Alex Trochut.\n\nSo who is Francis Bacon?\n\nFrancis Bacon was an Irish painter who created many popular artworks of portraits of various figures, heads, and animals in various situations and rooms. In the book 'The Rise of the Sixties' it is said that ''Francis Bacon had an expressionistic style, who create3d art drawn from personal experience and fixated on the traumatic memories of the Second World War.'' These paintings were not necessarily detailed or precise - it was more about the ways the paintings were put together, the composition and what the painting made about. He once stated that he saw ''images in a series'' and this can give us an good insight on how to view his work, and how he viewed it himself. He was also gay and this influenced his designs a lot, as he often used his various partners as subjects in his paintings and this was a good way of communicating emotions within his work. Here is some of his work below:\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.lukechueh.com/images/paintings/paintings-whole/bacon-figure-with-meat.jpg )\n\nThis image is called 'Figure with Meat'. Francis didn't make his paintings so that you could stand back and revel at the high detail and precision - he created them to make you think about the subjects within. He used certain techniques to achieve this like blurring and distorting the face and creating a scratchy texture with his brush. In my opinion, altogether this creates a strange nightmare style look, especially when I look at the main subjects. The slaughtered hanging meat doesn't seem to bother the figure as he sits by it which makes me think he is some sort of strange cult leader. This then disturbs me further when I look at his clothes as they remind me of a headteacher, and this is the last kind of person I would want hanging around kids! His face also creeps me out because it looks like it was created violently - smudged and scratched and you can see parts of his skull which makes me think he is some kind of monster. My interpretation and many others are what Francis Bacon wants when he created his paintings like the ones below.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to:http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_noAX2N9QUts/TNWhLb3nXNI/AAAAAAAAAAc/SB1o14mRrXM/s1600/0046w.jpg )\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.francis-bacon.com/images/21.jpg )\n\nWho is Alex Trochut?\n\nAlex Trochut is a modern, stylish graphic designer who originates from Spain. He has created many interesting and eye catching designs like the ones below, but today I'm going to talk about how he links in with Francis Bacon.\n\n(All credit for these images goes to: http://www.alextrochut.com/#/works)\n\nYou can clearly see the differences over time between the work of Francis Bacon and Alex Trochut, however both have struck a massive chord in their industries, wether that be art or graphic design. Below we can see how Alex Trochut has used a similar technique to Francis by swiping over letters with paint and acetate, much like how Francis swiped over his paintings back in the day. Alex Trochut has been influenced by this technique and tried it out himself to create some interesting typographical results, where as Francis used this technique to create a different effect altogether.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.alextrochut.com/#/works/raw)\n\nAll about Andy Warhol\n\nWelcome to my new blog! Here I will discuss various art movements and other subjects related to the big wide world of graphic design. Today for my first post, I decided to write about Andy Warhol, an inspiring American artist during the 20th Century and Pop art, an artistic movement that begun in the 1950's. In the book 'The Rise of the Sixties' it is said that ''Pop Art was a movement that took it's inspiration from its surroundings of the time, and was heavily influenced by consumerism''.\n\nWho was Andy Warhol?\n\nAndy Warhol was a famous American artist who was one of the main men leading a visual art movement called Pop Art. He was born in 1928 and studied hard until he held a successful career under his belt as a Commercial Illustrator. This made him a very popular but controversial artist who's work explored quite a lot of culture of his time and were such a hit that when he died in 1987, he was granted his own museum in Pennsylvania, America which became the largest museum in the U.S.A dedicated to a single artist.\n\n(All credit goes for this image goes to: http://a3.files.biography.com/image/upload/c_fit,h_1100,q_80,w_1023/MTE5NTU2MzE2Mzk5NjMzOTMx.jpg)\n\nWhat is an Art Movement?\n\nAn art movement is a specific style within art with a common goal or philosophy about it. Usually a group of Artists will set a movement off, and start a new trend by doing so.\n\nWhat Is Pop Art?\n\nPop Art is an art movement that originates from the 1950's in Britain and then set on later on America. It deviates from traditional fine art as it uses extracts from popular culture like news and advertisements. Sometimes the material does not fit into the same context as the rest of the work, and this is because pop art doesn't really refer to the art but more to the attitudes that lead towards creating it. Just after World War 2, artists thought about using their surrounding world and society to inspire them, and this is what gave birth to pop art. Although It has evolved quite a lot through time it still sticks to the same principles.\n\nAndy Warhol used Campbell's soup cans to create this piece which were a major product around the 1960's. This is a great example of the impact and importance of pop art because it can be classed as the first post-modernism type of art which made it popular with all sorts of artists across the world. I personally find pop art quite interesting and eye-catching as it makes me question the motives and thoughts of the artist at the time.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/5444584062_be79a52089.jpg )\n\nAbove is a more modern version of pop art which uses bright appealing colours and bend-aid dots. I personally find the pop art style interesting and appealing, and can understand why so many other artists and designers do too. One of these artists I speak of are Craig & Karl, two popular modern day designers who used art movements from the past like Pop Art to influence there own work like the piece I have chosen below.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/32/31/38/323138c8b7b0fac0568a2329c1e09039.jpg )\n\nThese two pieces of work were created by Craig & Karl and you can spot the distinctive Pop Art style and techniques used within them. For instance, the use of solid black outlines on simple shapes filled with basic but bright and full colours. There are also different strokes and textures introduced digitally like precise, crossing patterns and the classic bend-aid dots that are commonly found in earlier Pop Art creations. You can see how Craig & Karl have used Pop Art, an old art movement of the past, to their advantage in the present.\n\n(All credit for this image goes to: http://www.craigandkarl.com/)"
