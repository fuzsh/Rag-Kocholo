        "text": "Coined by Duchamp, the term ‚Äúreadymade‚Äù came to designate mass-produced everyday objects taken out of their usual context and promoted to the status of artworks by the mere choice of the artist. A performative act as much as a stylistic category, the readymade had far-reaching implications for what can legitimately be considered an object of art.\n\nDuchamp rejected purely visual or what he dubbed ‚Äúretinal pleasure,‚Äù deeming it to be facile, in favor of more intellectual, concept-driven approaches to art-making and, for that matter, viewing. He remained committed, however, to the study of perspective and optics which underpins his experiments with kinetic devices, reflecting an ongoing concern with the representation of motion and machines common to Futurist and Surrealist artists at the time.\n\nA taste for jokes, tongue-in-cheek wit and subversive humor, rife with sexual innuendoes, characterizes Duchamp‚Äôs work and makes for much of its enjoyment. He fashioned puns out of everyday expressions which he conveyed through visual\n\nmeans. The linguistic dimension of his work in particular paved the way for Conceptual art.\n\nMarcel Duchamp was raised in Normandy, in a family of artists. His father was mayor of Blainville and his mother raised their seven children and painted landscapes depicting the French countryside. Family time was spent playing chess, reading, painting, and playing music.\n\nOne of Marcel‚Äôs earliest artworks, Landscape at Blainville (1902), painted at age fifteen, reflected his family‚Äôs love of Claude Monet. Marcel was close to his two older brothers, and in 1904, after both had left home to become artists, he joined them in Paris to study painting at Acad√©mie Julian. His brother, Jacques Villon, supported him during his studies, and Marcel earned some income by working as a cartoonist. Duchamp‚Äôs early drawings evince his ongoing interest in visual and verbal puns.\n\nAfter he withdrew from the art world, Duchamp remained a passive, if influential, presence in New York avant-garde circles until he was rediscovered in the 1950s by Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. Duchamp‚Äôs insistence that art should be an expression of the mind rather than the eye or the hand spoke to Minimalists and Conceptual artists alike.\n\nIt ushered in a new era summed up by Joseph Kosuth‚Äôs claim that ‚Äúall art (after Duchamp) is conceptual (in\n\nnature) because art only exists conceptually.‚Äù The seminal concept of the mass-produced readymade was eagerly seized upon not only by Andy Warhol and other Pop artists who claimed Duchamp as their founding father but also, owing to its performative aspects, by Fluxus, Arte Povera and Performance artists.\n\nDuchamp‚Äôs radical critique of art institutions made him a cult figure for generations of artists who, like him, refused to go down the path of a conventional, commercial artistic career.\n\nThough his work was admired for its wide-ranging use of artistic materials and mediums, it is the theoretical thrust of Duchamp‚Äôs eclectic but relatively limited output that accounts for his growing impact on successive waves of twentieth-century avant-garde movements and individual artists who openly acknowledged his influence.\n\nOn his attitude about art: ‚ÄúIt is paradoxical. It is almost schizophrenic. On one side I worked from a very\n\nintellectual form of activity, and on the other de-deifying everything by more materialistic thoughts.‚Äù\n\nOn the readymade: ‚ÄúThe readymade is the consequence of the refusal which made me say: There are so many people who make pictures with their hands, that one should end up not using the hand.‚Äù\n\nOn chess: ‚ÄúI am still a victim of chess. It has all the beauty of art, and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position.‚Äù\n\nBiography is from The Art Story website.\n\nI hope you enjoy my tribute to the great Marcel Duchamp today. I had a surprisingly relaxing time creating it today! I wanted to incorporate his love for chess. I will see you tomorrow on Day 361‚Ä¶I‚Äôm going to try and have a relaxing rest of the day now. üôÇ\n\nBest,\n\nLinda"
