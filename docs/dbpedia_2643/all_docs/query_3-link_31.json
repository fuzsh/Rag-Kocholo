        "text": "Marcel Duchamp is often described as “the father of conceptual art”. He had a wide influence on many art movements during the 20th century, including Cubism, Surrealism and Dada. Many contemporary artists working today continue to cite Duchamp as an influence.\n\nAlthough Duchamp is most famous for his “readymades”, including Bottle Rack (1914) and Fountain (1917), I am most interested in his work with movement and kinetics, both in his paintings and his sculptures. One of Duchamp’s most famous early works is Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 (1912), which caused significant controversy when he submitted it for the Salon des Indépendants. The painting has significant associations with both Cubism and Futurism, particularly the fragmented depiction of movement common amongst Futurist paintings.\n\nDuchamp continued his experiments with movement and imagery through the creation of spinning works that created optical illusions. The first of these motorised sculptures was Rotary Glass Plates, Precision Optics (1920). This used a motor to rotate glass plates, on which Duchamp had painted segments of a circle. When the plates rotate, the complete circle appears.\n\nDuchamp continued his experiments with kinetic art in the work Rotary Demisphere, Precision Optics (1924). This piece worked in a similar way to Rotary Glass Plates, however it consisted of a rotating hemisphere, where the rotating of the image on the object created the optical effect, rather than the moving parts of the machine itself. See the machine in action here.\n\nThe optical effect that can be achieved through rotation is something that I am interested in, particularly the way that 2D images “dematerialise” when rotated at a high speed. Jean Tinguely and Yves Klein experimented with this idea of “dematerialisation” in the 1950s. Although I have previously experimented with this concept and I am sure it will feature in my future practice, I am currently more interested in the sound of the machine rather than the visual effect of rotation.\n\nBoth Duchamp and I are experimenting with the effect of rotation on the senses, in his case the visual experience of seeing, in mine the aural effect of hearing as rotated object clash together. I also like the mechanical aesthetic of his work, something that I am keen to create in my finished sculptures.\n\nFollowing on from my research into Duchamp’s work, I will continue to experiment with rotating objects. I am particularly keen on creating a series of mobiles made from found objects. These mobiles would create sounds when the suspended objects clash together, the movement either caused by the wind (if I were to present them outside), or by a motor rotating a stick that will beat against the objects as it rotates. I will also continue my research by looking at artists working with mobiles, particularly Alexander Calder and Jean Tinguely."
