        "text": "The term readymade was first used by French artist Marcel Duchamp to describe the works of art he made from manufactured objects. It has since often been applied more generally to artworks by other artists made in this way\n\nArt which uses sound both as its medium (what it is made out of) and as its subject (what it is about)\n\nA found object is a natural or man-made object, or fragment of an object, that is found (or sometimes bought) by an artist and kept because of some intrinsic interest the artist sees in it\n\nParodic humour was integral to Dada, and the influence of Nietzsche on dada is well known. However, the connections between buffoonery, Nietzsche and the anti-sublime in Dada have remained under-explored. This paper links key Dadaists in Berlin and Zürich to Nietzsche’s Ecce Homo, and to the Hanswurst – a tradition of German buffoonery – which Nietzsche deploys to counter the Schopenhauerian sublime.\n\nIn 1927 Marcel Duchamp married Lydie Fischer Sarazin-Levassor. The wedding was filmed by Man Ray and attended by Picabia. Here, we publish an extract from Sarazin-Levassor’s newly translated autobiography which gives an insight into Duchamp’s Spartan living habits – and his love of French puns.\n\nWhen Kurt Schwitters began making collages in 1918, the initial term he used to describe them was Merzzeichnungen (Merz drawings). This article considers the place of drawing in the development of Schwitters’s Merz practice and argues that the close connection he made between drawings and collages was not merely because of their common status as works on paper. By analogising collage and drawing, Schwitters gave new priority to the latter but not as immediate access to the artist’s thought. Rather, drawing was a medium that could meld together elements of painting, printmaking and writing, disrupting conventional artistic categories and demanding a greater role for the viewer in creative interpretation.\n\nWas this the same Kurt Schwitters, founder of Merz, collaborator with Dadaists, Cubists and Constructivists, who won first, second and third prizes in the 1946 Ambleside flower show art competition? A new exhibition picks up where many accounts trail off, examining the final years of a major European modernist on the run, who made work from the detritus of wartime London and the Romantic landscapes of the Lake District"
