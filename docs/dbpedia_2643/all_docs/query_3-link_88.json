        "text": "In a 1961 interview with Katherine Kuh, Marcel Duchamp, when asked about his readymades, let it be known that the concept behind those objects might be the most important single idea to come out of my work. (1) In June 1967, the self-proclaimed an-artist (2) - anticipating his final departure a mere sixteen months hence (\"Quite simply, I am waiting for death\") - elaborated on his concept of the readymade: Ultimately, it should not be looked at Its not the visual aspect of the Readymade that matters, its simply the fact that it exists. Visuality is no longer a question: the Readymade is no longer visible, so to speak. It is completely gray matter. It is no longer retinal. When pressed by his interviewer about the paradox of the readymades having ended up being consumed in museums and exhibitions, and sold as art objects (particularly in light of the editions produced by the Galleria Schwarz in Milan in 1964), Duchamp replied:\n\nThere is an absolute contradiction, but that is what is enjoyable, isnt it? Bringing in the idea of contradiction, the notion of contradiction, which is something that has never really been used, you see? And all the more since this use doesnt go very far. If you make an edition of eight Readymades, like a sculpture, like a Bourdelle or you name it, that is not overdoing it. There is something called multiples, that go up to hundred and fifty, two hundred copies. Now there I do object because thats getting really too vulgar in a useless way, with things that could be interesting if they were seen by fewer people. There are too many people in this world looking. We have to reduce the number of people looking! But thats another matter. (3)\n\nTo reduce the number of people looking echoes an early note by Marcel Duchamp, Limit the no. of rdymades yearly (?). (4) This comment, first published in the Green Box of 1934(Fig. 1), was most likely written between 1911 and 1915, during the period of the first readymades, such as the Bicycle Wheel (1913) (Fig. 2) and the Bottle Dryer (1914) (Fig. 3). (5) As he was never keen on showing them publicly, early on they may have functioned as works of private contemplation (not unlike Descartes famous piece of wax or William of Occams razor), responses, perhaps, to his note of 1913: Can one make works which are not works of art? (6) Accordingly, with the exception of one single New York exhibition in 1916, the readymades were unknown outside his small circle of friends and family until the 1940s. We should bear in mind that even the urinal entitled Fountain (Fig. 4)  submitted not under Duchamps name, but under the pseudonym R. Mutt  was rejected for display at the first exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists in 1917. Throughout his life Duchamp often declined to participate in exhibitions, especially when his readymades were involved. The Bicycle Wheel, for example, was not shown until 1951, and even then as a replica of the lost original. Duchamp is thus to be believed when he says that the readymades were a very personal experiment that I had never intended to show to the public. (7)\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nFigure. 1\n\nMarcel Duchamp, The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (aka the Green Box), 1934\n\nFigure. 2\n\nMarcel Duchamp, Bicycle Wheel, 1913\n\nFigure. 3\n\nFigure. 4\n\nMarcel Duchamp, Bottle Dryer, 1914\n\nMarcel Duchamp, Fountain, 1917\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nFigure 5\n\nMarcel Duchamp, Nude Descending a Staircase, 1912\n\nAs for their actual number, Duchamp once spoke of thirty to thirty-five, though today only about a third of them are known. (8) Many objects qualifying as readymades  mentioned in his notes and in early accounts by Charles Sheeler, William Carlos Williams, and Edgar Varèse  were never realized or are lost without a trace. In any case, their limited number, and the fact that at least a few of them are unaccounted for, strongly suggest that they were indeed the personal experiment that the an-artist described. Duchamp sought from the beginning to assure that his choice of objects would be limited in order to avoid redundancy, an inevitable consequence if a larger number of original readymades had been produced. In the 1930s Duchamp declined an offer from the Knoedler Gallery in New York, whose director offered him a substantial sum if he would continue to produce the works for which he was most famous (such as the Nude Descending a Staircase of 1912) (Fig. 5). It would force me to repeat myself. I will not even envisage this possibility. I value my independence too much. (9) Despite the temptation, Duchamp kept the readymades out of the fray and, accordingly, they remained virtually unknown.\n\nDuchamps refusal to have the readymades treated as works of art led him to claim that for a period of thirty years nobody talked about them and neither did I. (10) His often-pronounced aesthetic indifference towards these objects also excluded the possibility of their appearance in large numbers, as that would have allowed for taste to infiltrate his experiment. In later years, to maintain this indifference despite their newly acquired fame, Duchamp  always worried about the unavoidable aesthetics of patina  thought of swapping them for newer mass-produced objects, replacing, for example, the Bottle Dryer with a plastic bucket. (11)\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nFigure 6\n\nMarcel Duchamp, Boîte-en-Valise, (open; edition started in 1941)\n\nOutside of his notes in the Green Box, his private correspondence, and the miniatures and photographic reproductions in the Boîte-en-valise (which premiered in 1941) (Fig. 6), (12) Duchamp did not publicly mention the readymades until 1945. (13) In fact, the sole definition of the readymade published under Duchamps name, in 1938  an ordinary object elevated to the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist  turns out not to have written by Duchamp but by André Breton. (14)\n\nAll of the above can only hint at the intricacies of Duchamps early concept of the readymade and the many misreadings that followed. From the immediate post-war period until today, Duchamps readymades have been all too often taken as carte blanche for anything goes, mere nihilistic or iconoclastic gestures based on the belief that, generated by the choice of the artist, it is only the changing of the context (i.e. a urinal at a plumbing-fixture store vs. Fountain at a gallery) through which an ordinary object is transformed into a work of art. (15) Misreading Duchamp of course, is what the ambivalent an-artist himself must have anticipated and, to a certain extent, encouraged, as Dieter Daniels observed:\n\nWhenever other artists embrace the principle of the Readymade, the idea becomes completely detached from the historical objects and begins a life of its own. In so doing, it illustrates in the best way possible Duchamps dictum that it is the viewer who makes the pictures. The continued artistic influence of the Readymade may therefore be understood only as a permanent redefinition of its meaning. (16)\n\nDuchamps continuing fame, and his influence on a younger generation of artists, were unexpected: it took some time before it was established that this whole bloody, revolutionary, contradictory century has basically been a big Duchampian-Beckettian burlesque. (17) His own attitude towards his heirs seemed to be, at best, one of aloofness (of the same sort he had earlier professed towards Dada and Surrealism), and, at worst, frustration, as was articulated to the Dadaist Hans Richter:\n\nThis Neo-Dada, which they call New Realism, Pop Art, Assemblage, etc., is an easy way out, and lives on what Dada did. When I discovered the ready-mades I sought to discourage aesthetics. In Neo-Dada they have taken my readymades and found aesthetic beauty in them, I threw the bottle-rack and the urinal into their faces as a challenge and now they admire them for their aesthetic beauty. (18)\n\nThere is a problem with this infamous quote, however. Hans Richter asserted that it came straight from a letter written to him by Duchamp in 1961. Only years later did he admit that those words were not Duchamps. Richter had sent Duchamp this paragraph for comment, writing: You threw the bottle rack and the urinal into their face , etc. Duchamp simply scrawled: Ok, ça va très bien into the margins. (19)\n\nIn fact, the an-artists overall assessment of the new movements spreading all around him (and to which, to a certain degree, he owed his enormous renaissance) was, though disengaged, much more sympathetic than Richters misleading quote would suggest. In 1964, Duchamp, though unmoved by Pop artists sense of humor and choice of material, made the following favorable comments:\n\nPop Art is a return to conceptual painting, virtually abandoned, except by the Surrealists, since Courbet, in favor of retinal painting If you take a Campbell soup can and repeat it 50 times, you are not interested in the retinal image. What interests you is the concept that wants to put 50 Campbell soup cans on a canvas. (20)\n\nFrom the 1950s on, Duchamps influence on the American art scene has grown precipitously. Beginning in 1942 he lived permanently in New York, and his presence was undoubtedly a factor in the numerous exhibitions that were held in this country in succeeding years. (21) In 1952 Life magazine honored his continuing presence as Dadas Daddy in a ten-page photo spread, (22) and by the mid-50s some of his readymades were permanently installed in American museums. Robert Motherwell made a significant contribution toward a Duchamp renaissance with the publication of the anthology The Dada Painters and Poets (1951), in which he characterized the Bottle Rack as at once a sculpture and an anti-art and consequently dada gesture, concluding, it is evident, thirty-five years later, that the bottle rack he chose has a more beautiful form than almost anything made, in 1914, as sculpture. (23) The game was on, and it certainly didnt please everyone, least of all the Abstract Expressionists.\n\nIn 1957, Barnett Newman voiced his displeasure with the Whitney Museum of American Art, particularly with Robert Motherwells contribution to a catalogue for the memorial exhibition of Bradley Walker Tomlin. In a letter to John I. H. Baur, the Whitneys director, Newman accused Motherwell of smear and slander, stating that he wanted to make clear that if Motherwell wishes to make Marcel Duchamp a father, Duchamp is his father and not mine nor that of any American painter that I respect. (24) Four years earlier, in a similar tirade against the Museum of Modern Art, he had insinuated that Duchamps works in that institution merely added to its popularizing role of entertainment, and asserted that the American public seeks more from art than just gadgets. (25) In 1952, he confirmed that the gadgets of his scorn were indeed the readymades: Marcel Duchamp tried to destroy art by pointing to the fountain, and we now have museums that show screwdrivers and automobiles and paintings. [The museums] have accepted this aesthetic position that theres no way of knowing what is what. (26)\n\nThis was precisely the view of Clement Greenberg, the preeminent art critic of Americas post-war era. Greenberg attacked the tendency to produce art without the guidance of aesthetic judgment, a factor many artists wanted to do away with in the hope, periodically renewed since Marcel Duchamp first acted on it fifty-odd years ago, that by dint of evading the reach of taste while yet remaining in the context of art, certain kinds of contrivances will achieve unique existence and value. So far, this hope has proved illusory. (27) With the advent of Assemblage, Pop, Environment, Op, Kinetic, Erotic, and all the other varieties of Novelty Art (28)  all movements, that is, which were more or less indebted to Duchamp  Greenberg bemoaned not only the passing of Abstract Expressionism but of authentic art values. (29) These movements were fulfillments of Duchamps dream of going beyond the issue of artistic quality. the real failure of Pop art, on top of its easiness, was its vulnerability to qualitative comparisons, something Duchamp had supposedly initiated in his transcending the difference between good and bad in general. (30) It follows that at the heart of this confusion are the readymades in their three-dimensionality, a spatial coordinate that art has to share with non-art. (31) That Greenberg saw the readymade as belonging to the history of painting rather than to that of sculpture clearly evolved from these observations. (32)\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, it was Duchamp himself who spoke out vividly against the movement heralded most by Greenberg:\n\nThe recent examples of Abstract Expressionism clearly show the ultimate in the retinal approach begun by Impressionism. By retinal I mean that the aesthetic pleasure depends almost entirely on the impression on the retina, without appealing to any auxiliary interpretation The young artist of tomorrow will refuse to base his work on a philosophy as over-simplified as that of the representative or non-representative dilemma. (33)\n\nIn the field of art theory, similar opposing voices made themselves heard. To give but one example: early on, New Yorks young and infamous art critic Gene Swenson rejected the tradition that linked everything from Cubism to Color Field painting and instead proposed a different trajectory declaring Dada and Surrealism the ancestors of Pop. In 1966, he curated the exhibition The Other Tradition at the Philadelphia Institute of Contemporary Art. According to the catalogue, the shows declared goal was 1) seeing certain twentieth-century works of art which have been overlooked or neglected by art historians, and 2) suggesting alternative intellectual rather than formal ways of dealing with this art. Swensons checklist is topped off by four contributions from Duchamp, leading him to ask: How much longer will we rest content with our defective and infectious critical tools and our academic standards? How many more times can we see the words picture plane, modernism, crisis, new, and literary without flushing? (34)\n\nSwenson was reacting to a paradigmatic shift in American art, and many young artists were enthralled to find out that Duchamps newly discovered oeuvre spoke to their own strategies of subverting what came before them. He was simply in the air, (35) as Bruce Nauman put it. John Cage began lecturing on Duchamp at Black Mountain College (starting in 1952) as well as at the New School of Social Research (1956-58), to a new generation of artists that included Robert Rauschenberg, George Brecht, Alan Kaprow, Al Hensen, Dick Higgins, and Jackson McLow. George Segal remarked that Marcel Duchamp had a revived life through John Cage. (36) In 1958 Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns went to see the Duchamp collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Years before, during the War years, Joseph Cornell had befriended Duchamp in the course of his collaboration on the latters Boîte-en-valise. Yet to comprehend fully the scope of Duchamps deep appreciation by post-war generation and contemporary American artists as well as the influence he wielded over them  especially with his readymades  nothing serves the purpose better than to hear it in their own words (37) :\n\nRobert Motherwell\n\nI would say that one of the most astonishing things in my lifetime as an artist is his prominence. Thirty years ago, if somebody had said to me, he may become the major the major influence on the art scene, Id have said: Youre out of your mind, and most of my judgments were quite accurate then.\n\n- Vivien Raynor, A Talk with Robert Motherwell, Art News, vol. 73, no. 4 (April 1974). p. 51, quoted in: Dieter Daniels, Marcel Duchamp: The Most Influential Artist of the 20th Century?, in: Museum Jean Tinguely Basel (ed.)

Wiley, Berkeley: University Art Museum, 1971, p. 42, quoted in: The Influence of Marcel Duchamp, p. 173.\n\nPaul Pfeiffer\n\nSomewhere I read a statement by Duchamp to the effect that his art was intended as a destroyer, specifically of identity. I find that really inspiring. Putting a mustache on Mona Lisa makes a pretty basic point about the fluidity of identity and the depths to which gender, race and nationality are encoded into vision. Im interested in multiple meanings and a kind of ambiguity that frustrates any attempt to pin it down.\n\n- Linda Yablonsky, Making Microart that can Suggest Macrotruths, in: The New York Times, December 9, 2001, p. 39.\n\nRichard Pettibone\n\nMy response to Duchamp hasnt changed at all in the last 34 years. His work is just as beautiful. Being a visual artist I feel that its very important what things look like & in spite of all that talk about chance & giving up taste, etc. Duchamps work is still drop dead gorgeous.\n\n- letter to Francis M. Naumann, August 1997, quoted in: Francis M. Naumann, Apropos of Marcel. The Art of Making Art after Duchamp in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, New York: Curt Marcus Gallery, 1999 [exh. cat.], p. 13.\n\nSanford Biggers\n\nDuchamps readymades are now aesthetically and formally pleasing, though they were controversial for their time and opposed the conventions... I also follow the idea of keeping the form as one of the most important elements but also feel strongly about challenging prescribed notions in art theory. The fact that I am the creator or author of these pieces also adds to how these pieces are interpreted by art theory.\n\n- Lauren Wilcox, Transformation and Tradition: Interview with Sanford Biggers, in: Tout-Fait: The Marcel Duchamp Studies Online Journal, vol. 2, nr. 4, Art & Literature (January 2002),<http://www.toutfait.com/issues/volume2/issue_4/ArtandLiterature/bigger/bigger.htm> >>Next\n\npage 1 2\n\nNotes"
