        "text": "Overall, the ideologies discussed within the articles Written In Blood: 20th Century Art by Stephanie Dudek and Estrangement As A Motif In Modern Painting by John Adkins Richardson address similarities and differences from various standpoints. Modernistic ideologies towards social, cultural and technological changes of the 20th century are demonstrated in both articles. The article by Stephanie Dudek emphasizes on the employment of radical and transgressive values by modern artists within their work to target cultural, and artistic principles that have persisted over many generations leading to a transformation within the subject of art (Dudek 105). Furthermore, modern art set out to obtain new visions of reality as witnessed within the Cubist\n\nImpactful across the globe, both Dada and Surrealism were artistic movements created in the early 20th century that were significant in redefining modern art today. The Dada movement came about in 1916 through the performance of Hugo Ball’s sound poem “Karawane” at the Cabaret Voltaire that he opened with his partner, nightclub singer Emmy Hennings, in Zurich, Switzerland. The poem made absolutely no sense, purposely, and it didn’t have to. Ball would also dress in wild costumes for his performances as seen below:\n\nOne of the most unique figures in the continuum of the art world, Marcel Duchamp changed the way we look at and produce art today. Marcel Duchamp was by far, one of the most controversial figures in art. Two of the most well known and talked about pieces by him are The Fountain and The Bride Stripped Bare by her Bachelors, Even . Duchamp created many other pieces that caught the attention of critics, other artists, and the population in a negative way; however, these two pieces alone, brought about the greatest amount of controversy.\n\nMost of his work was seen in many department store windows, where his unique style was based on abstract expressionism. “Abstract Expressionism Art Movement” in the united states was influenced during the post-war. This movement helped American achieve international praise and put New York City on the map, US now becoming the center of the Western World of art. Thus beginning to making “Pop art” in the 1960’s, He started to photograph famous celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn\n\nWhen he moved from Belgium to the Netherlands, most of his most famous works are from then because the wet weather allowed him to work on them and he had a lot of time on his hands. When he was a younger artist, he sketched things such as nature and landscapes. When he was in Italy, he decided to draw things that didn’t form naturally. 2 examples of his famous works during this period were “Drawing Hands”, where 2 hands are popping out of a paper and look like they are drawing each other, and “Relativity”, where there is a building with many different staircases which confuses your brain because you don’t know which way is up or\n\nWith R Mutt’s Fountain, one of the most influential works of the twentieth century, this places an art historical value on the Duchamp piece. R Mutt’s Fountain was created in 1917, shortly after he became associated with the Dada movement, who emerged amid the brutality of World War One. Dadaism is a movement of art, who were experimental, pushing the boundaries, provocatively reimaging what art and art making could be. They used unconventional materials and chance based procedures, infusing their work with spontaneity and irreverence. Duchamp was a central figure in the Dada movement, declaring common, and “manufactured goods to be ‘readymade’ artworks, radically challenging the notion of a work of art as something beautiful made by a technically skilled artist . R Mutt’s Fountain is one of Duchamp’s most famous works reflecting the Dada movement and ideas surrounding it. He\n\nThe DADA art movement was an anti- art/anti-war political movement against war (WWI). World War I caused over 6.6 million civilian and military deaths (World war I by the Numbers, 2015) and this upset many people. Artist’s decided to react and protest using their talent starting what we know as the DADA art movement.The movement began in the 1916 in Zurich, Switzerland connecting art to the social conditions of what was going on in the world. Dadaist felt the battle over the land resources and power was pointless inhumane and confirmed society’s degradation. They gave a powerful metaphoric meaning, protesting the brutality of World War Ι through art. There were no rules and no unifying styles but their principles were the equivalent. Dadaism also emerged in other cities like Berlin, Hanover, Cologne, New York and Paris.\n\ndevelopment in visual artwork and writing, thriving in Europe between World Wars I and II. Surrealism became essentially was the next step up from the dada movement, which before World War I delivered works of against artwork that defied all reasoning; yet Surrealism's accentuation was not on invalidation but rather on positive expression. The development spoke to a response against what its individuals saw as the devastation created by the \"logic\" that had guided European society and governmental issues in the past and that had finished in the detestations of World War I.\n\nDuchamp challenged the very notion of what is art, his first \"readymades\" sent shock waves across the art world that can still be felt today. Duchamp's ongoing preoccupation with the mechanisms of desire and human sexuality as well as his fondness for wordplay aligns his work with that of Surrealists, although he steadfastly refused to be affiliated with any specific artistic movement per se. In his insistence that art should be driven by ideas above all, Duchamp is generally considered to be the father of Conceptual art. His refusal to follow a conventional artistic path, matched only by a horror of repetition which accounts for the relatively small number of works Duchamp produced in the span of his short career, ultimately led to his withdrawal from the art world. In later years, Duchamp famously spent his time playing chess, even as he labored away in secret at his last enigmatic masterpiece, which was only unveiled after his death. An artist that was inspired by Marcel Duchamp's \"readymades,\" Cornell elevated the found object to the center of his oeuvre and embodied a new paradigm of the artist as collector and\n\nMarcel Duchamp was born on July 28, 1887. His birthplace is Normandy, France, which is also where he was raised. Duchamp was one seven children. It is said that he “comes from a family of artists”. But ironically enough, his favorite childhood pastimes consisted of chess, reading, painting and playing music. Marcel created one of his earliest artworks at the age of fifteen and named it Landscape at Blainville (1902). He was very close with two of his older brothers that left home to become artists in 1904. Marcel went along with them to Paris and studied painting at Academie Julian. With the support of his brother, Julian Villion, he worked as a cartoonist while attending school. Duchamp became familiarized with the modern trends in painting, in Paris, during the 1900s. He also studied Fauvism, Cubism and Impressionism. Marcel related to the Cubist notation more than any of the others because it was “reordering reality,” not just “simply representing” it (“Marcel Duchamp,” sec 5). His early painting, Nude Descending A Staircase, showed his interest in machinery and its connection to the body’s movement through space, which later transcends into early Modernism. Duchamp was attracted to avant-garde notations of an artist as an anti-academic. He felt a natural liking in this respect with one of his early heroes, the Symbolist painter and graphic artist,\n\nThe Dada movement was an art movement that broke away from the traditional norms of art as well as the traditional mediums. Mediums like photomontage, photograms(rayographs), and readymade art pieces were becoming prevalent during this movement. Hannah Höch and Raoul Hausmann were both prominent artists of the movement that individually had success with their photomontage artworks. Hannah Hoch's Cut with the Kitchen Knife Dada through the Last Weimar beer Belly Cultural Epoch of Germany and Raoul Hausmann's ABCD are perfect examples of the purpose of the Dada Movement. Both Höch's Cut with the Kitchen Knife and Hausmann's ABCD possess several of the central characteristics, anti-war, anti-art, and anti-bourgeois, that define the Dada movement.\n\nThe year of 1914 marked the beginning of World War I and the commencement of a tumultuous era for politics, society and art. Amongst the considerable number of people negatively affected by the dreadfulness of the war, many of them found different ways of expressing their repugnance towards the horrific routes that humanity had taken. The Dada movement in particular began not only as a reaction against the war but also as a commentary on the social circumstances that lead to it. This essay reflects on the context that allowed the art movement to flourish and the circumstances that lead to its decline. The rise of machinery, mass production, fascism and overall disillusionment with society provided an ideal environment for radical movements to emerge."
