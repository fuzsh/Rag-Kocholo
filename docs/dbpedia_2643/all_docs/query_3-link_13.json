        "text": "Marcel Duchamp can be described as an author, sculptor, and painter (1887-1968).\n\nIn 1904, Duchamp joined his two brothers, Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, in Paris, where he studied painting until 1905. His earlier works were Post-Impressionist style. During the year 1911 his painting became directed more towards Cubism. Nude Descending a Staircase was shown at the Salon dOr in 1912. Duchamp's radical style preceded the founding of the Dada form of art around 1913. Dadaism was an art movement based on deliberate irrationality and negation of traditional artistic values. He also used Surrealist and Cubist forms of art, using imagery produced by unnatural juxtapositions and abstract structure in form of fragmenting his objects. His artwork was often humorous and had no boundaries. Duchamp joined his brothers at an art academy in Paris. This is when Cezanne, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism, and popular illustration first influenced him. The Chess Players, Nude Descending a staircase, and The King and the Queen Surrounded by Swift Nudes are only three of his spectacular paintings which used the Cubism art form. He used Cubist techniques around 1904-1912.\n\nThe Chess Players\n\nNude Descending a Staircase\n\nThe King and the Queen Surrounded by Swift Nudes\n\nIn 1912, he devised a Cubist-inspired technique for depicting motion. He later became an abstract painter. Nude Descending a Staircase was an artwork which was constructed using Cubist inspiration. He constructed this work only with abstract lines and planes to exhibit the womans/mans motion. Soon after its completion Nude Descending a Staircase was rejected by the Salon des Independants because they felt Duchamp was making fun of the Cubist form of art.\n\nAnother painting that soon followed Nude Descending a Staircase was The King and Queen Surrounded by Swift Nudes. This also resembled a type of abstract art, which has motion. Duchamp said the swift nudes were \"flights of imagination\". As Duchamp continued to work on other paintings he slowly departed from Cubism and took another direction towards abstract art. His painting The Passage from Virgin to Bride completely parted him form his Cubist ties and took on a new abstract form.\n\nHe used a very different technique to put together one of his main works, The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, which put together a few of his smaller pieces of artworks, paint, lead wire, mirror plating, foil and dust.\n\nIt really is not a painting at all, yet two large pieces of glass, one on top of the other with different images.\n\nThe Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even\n\nThe Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even was a monumental work done in 1923; Duchamp included within it several mini paintings: one in particular is the \"Chocolate Grinder\".\n\nThe Chocolate Grinder\n\nThe bride in The Large Glass is not only stripped bare but stripped down to her inner self, revealing her aspirations and inspirations. Her halo, also shown on the upper half of The Large Glass, represents her aspirations. Therefore, it is represented in balloon shape, similar to a cartoon whose thoughts are written out in this manner. In the halo resides three nets which is the target to be fulfilled by a successful suitor. To begin the \"story\" of the work the bride releases an invisible \"love gasoline\" onto each suitor. The vapors symbolize the brides love impulse. The bachelor(s) are stimulated by the vapors and gas forms within the bachelor molds. Then, the gas is conducted into capillary tubes (the nine connected lines). After this it is moved into sieves which is one of the parts of The Large Glass which Duchamp was unable to complete. From here a butterfly pump, an element also imagined by Duchamp, collected the gas where it was liquefied. From the butterfly pump the now liquid gas was transported to a spiral and then there is a \"splash\", which is sent to the brides halo. As illustrated, The Large Glass is an ongoing, yet uncompleted work by Duchamp.\n\nMarcel is a very unique artist who brings a new sense and train of thought to art. His artwork requires his viewers to use their mind and imagination rather than just their eyes. He brings a new meaning to art by allowing art to take many forms. His ready-mades, for example, were not traditional pieces of art. His ready-mades actually shocked people by him equating the object to modern art. Today, however, many forms of art occur, of which Duchamp is a great influence. Marcel Duchamp is a true inspiration also because he is not a perfectionist. He allows his work to come out the way it does. For example, The Large Glass broke as it was being exhibited in a museum and he glued the pieces back together. His creation appeared different, yet he turned out to like it even more than before. Duchamps goal was to shift emphasis from the final product to the artists intentions. His legacy includes insight that art can be about ideas instead of traditional objects. He is a true inspiration to generations of artists to come.\n\nReferences"
