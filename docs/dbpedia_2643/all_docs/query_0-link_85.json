        "text": "Is reproduction good or bad?\n\nThe rampant reproduction of distinguished works of art has been an unavoidable consequence of the advancements made by modern technology, especially due to the invention of the camera, which allows the exact replication of an image for various purposes, from documentation to propaganda (be it political or commercial). By achieving a high level of likeliness within the reproduction, it renders viewing the original arguably obsolete, even though it is just a pixelated makeup of the original artwork.\n\nIn John Berger’s seminal work “Ways of Seeing”, he has asserted that “When the camera reproduces a painting, it destroys the uniqueness of the image.” This would mean that due to the fact that the camera has the ability to replicate the exact image of an artwork, this would imply that art would be at a risk of losing its own novelty, to the point where “its meaning multiplies and fragments into many meanings”. This would further imply that due to this fragmentation of meaning, the new context in which the reproduction is represented, and the way in which it is presented, could be altered by the reproducer to imbue new meaning into the image, as evident in many modern advertisements. However, I believe that reproduction is not a necessarily an evil in this new era, where globalization and new methods of communication tend to democratize many aspects of human life, including art and its appreciation.\n\nMany, including Berger himself, have been led to believe that due to the highly accessible methods of reproduction available today, the value of art has declined. This is because due to the high quantity of copies that could be made, viewers from all around the world could view the same image at the same time without having to purchase the work or to actually be within the presence of the work in order to “appreciate” it. Furthermore, due to the ease in which we could access the images of these art works, it demystifies the artwork since the visual content as well as the artist’s intention could be studied from these very images. Hence, the value of the actual artwork is reduced to its market value, since its visual content is readily available from its reproductions. Therefore, by having the value of art being reduced to strictly economic terms, the spiritual and more intangible role that art used to play in the past has been lost, such as how religious paintings used to emanate a certain aura and have been used to coerce many people, nobles and peasants alike, towards religious conviction. Thus, reproduction presents an immediate threat as to the relative value and status that art holds within society.\n\nAlso, reproduction is also bad such that it allows art to be used as a tool for manipulation, both on an intellectual and emotional level, by various parties within society in order to pursue their own interests. This is because as reproduction becomes easier to access and implement, and its methods and processes made cheaper, it makes it easier for institutions with various selfish interests to use these images to convince the masses towards believing a certain message or to use these as authoritative figures which the masses should aspire to be. For example, large-scale industries, such as the fashion industry, could use the images to make their brand more appealing and embellish it with the prestige that is normally assigned to those artworks. Hence, artworks have been reduced to mere advertising tools which are used for commercial gains.\n\nMoreover, these images could further been used to be printed upon souvenirs which are used as tokens to remind the owner of seeing the artwork, thus further commercializing the image of the artwork and effectively, the artwork itself. Ironically though, such examples are most rampant within the institutions which house the artworks themselves- the museums, where one could find inadequately printed objects shamelessly splashed with paintings by the likes of van Gogh, Mvnch and Picasso, all geared towards providing an additional inflow of money for the museum. Thus, such blatant exploitation of art further proves the case that reproduction could only provide avenue for revenue by such institutions within society.\n\nHowever, to say that reproduction is merely an evil would just be viewing the issue from a narrow point of view. Due to the ease of reproduction, art can not only be enjoyed by much more people, but it also allows for the innovation for various platforms in which the reproduced images could be discussed and studied by people around the globe, hence removing the restrictions of time and space. Through reproduction, virtual platforms are made possible in which not only the image of the artwork could be viewed and shared, but also its background and intended meaning, hence allowing for informed understanding of art by the masses, possibly triggering constructive discussions. Such initiatives range from the ambitious Google Art project, which targets to archive and thus reproduce thousands of masterpieces within a single domain, as well as more consumer-directed sites such as artnet.com. These do not only make art accessible to many, but also enriches the artwork itself due to the increasing number of perspectives that commence as a result of the more widespread discourse which surround the artworks in this new age.\n\nOther than providing insurmountable breadth to the discussion and appreciation of art, it also lends depth to its criticism. This is because reproduction would lead to the image of the artwork being highly portable and hence can be assessed at any place. This is in stark contrast to the past, where only chosen scholars would study the actual artwork itself and attach their observations from the visual experience of the artwork to the meaning behind it. However, in modern times due to the portability of such images, it allows art to be studied at any time and any where, and hence would result in an increased amount of time and resources which could be gathered through less troublesome means. This also makes art much more relevant to our fast-paced lifestyle, where people would rarely have time to spare to visit museums, much less compare between the formal qualities apparent within a Kandinsky and a Mondrian. Thus, though it reduces the authority previously held by the institution and even the artwork itself, it results in a more perceptive understanding due to the dissolution of such previously concrete boundaries.\n\nIn the end, I feel that it is important for us to reevaluate the role of art today in order to see whether it is a “good” or a “bad” thing. It is important to note that while reproduction is highly viable and produces outstanding results for more traditional mediums such as painting, it is still very much inadequate or ineffective in reproducing more contemporary mediums established within art, such as readymades which are effectively and visually objects that can be found in everyday life and hence is not affected by visual reproduction, as well as performance and installation art, where the crux of their understanding lies in being physically there with the artwork itself. Perhaps these newer forms of art are a result of this new generation of artists responding to the ease of reproduction, and hence are working towards more ways to render such processes irrelevant or to even exploit them. Thus, should art persist to maintain its relevance, reproduction is indeed a good thing and should act as a pressuring agent so that art would be able to develop into a more significant appendage of contemporary society.\n\nThe technical reproduction of art involves works being perfectly photographed and printed, sold for a minute fraction of the price of the original, made available to masses and changing the societal and cultural perception of art and its value.\n\nIt began in the early 1900s, and shook the world with its tremendous impact on art and the art society. It especially goes against the classical traditions of art as subject reserved for the appreciation of the royal and cultured. The Royal Academies of Art set up in 1648 and 1768 in France and England respectively served as a platform that had set the context on the status of art, cultivating critical notice and promoted the artist’s prominence through the patronage and funding of the rich and the wealthy. This generated a sense of authority in being able to possess and view artworks, a boost to a person’s status at that time. In The Salon, it is a sign of royal favor and showcases the “talent” of an artist to be able to have exhibited their works. Ironically, works were already being printed and catalogued in The Salon, although mainly documenting art history. From this pivotal moment on, the boundaries of art appreciation were bring pushed to welcome the general public, with the idea of a government- sponsored public Salon. This shows that with the coming of the mechanical age and reproduction of works, art is being revealed to society. I feel that this is more a good than a bad issue, despite the reproduction of art weighing having concerns from both sides of the issue. Despite the reproduction of art purportedly demeaning the authority in the original artworks and warping the pure, fundamental meaning of artworks as some may argue, I find that art is able to then reach out to the masses, bringing the joy and satisfaction of art appreciation to more people and consolidating greater knowledge and opinion on an artwork.\n\nInevitably, the technical reproduction of art destroys the original meaning of a work and fragments its meaning to the different contexts of ordinary human life. For example, a reproduction or print of Leonardo’s “The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist”, loses the meaning of the scene taken away from its original prestigious context in a museum, regarded as high art or art with authority. Furthermore, the work or reproduction is subject to the judgment of the masses based on the environment which they are kept, and people gradually lose its true meaning and purpose but apply it to their daily lives, probably looking on the surface (formal qualities) of the work or viewing the subject matter as a mere reference to a mother and child. I feel that in a certain way, people lose the respect for artworks to bother to discover their true meaning and purpose, as opposed to when its being placed in a museum setting and the artist’s statement is being made prominent and of importance, possessing with the authority in which the work holds as most accurately represented in its original context.\n\nOne might move on to view this not only as a devaluation in respect for the artwork, but also the artist. By fragmenting the meaning of works to apply to different people, one disregards the true message of the artist, his intent for the work in the first place. We see the works as we want to, not considering the meaning the artist has bestowed upon the work, qualifying it as art in the first place.\n\nFurthermore, a reproduction of an artwork is insufficient in capturing the true beauty of works in their aesthetic form. The reproduction loses out on its ability to depict the artist’s magnificent original brushwork and detail, the minute nuances in the artist’s style which manages to capture the work so intricately. Unable to view the details of a reproduction close up, we tend to view the work as an image, unaware of the hard work, skill and talent of the artist in depicting and portraying colour and form in its pure, classical likeness. In such a way, this lacking factor in a reproduction does not allow us to marvel over this pure, artistic beauty of the process of the work and we devalue the work through the reproduction, blinded of the aesthetics in the technique and process of the artist. Therefore, reproduction can be said to degrade a masterpiece to a mere image, devoid of its original authority. The same can be said about the experiences and memory of the subject in an artwork, such as a monumental building or significant experience in history. Viewers are not able to grasp the full meaning of a work as viewed from a reproduction compared to the real work.\n\nThe ideal mood of an artwork, such as Vermeer’s “The Milkmaid’s” required silence and stillness, is also degraded. Through the stillness in the environment of a museum, the work is able to manifest the moment, depicting the action of the milkmaid in its pure form.\n\nThe reproduction of art can be said to destroy its boundaries of time and space. Placed in a museum, an artwork is fixed in a specific context. Being only in one place at a time, it is bound my time and space, which gives the artwork its uniqueness which was also once part of the characteristics of the place where it resided. When reproduced and placed in another environment its meaning multiplies and the original is destroyed.\n\nLastly, when we get to see the reproduction of an artwork before, the original, we tend to view the original with the expectation of a work that would exceed the visual standard one saw in relation to the reproduction. We do not consider the significance of the original work for its true aesthetic beauty, but rather as an “improvement” on the reproduction. We lose the visual sight for the true beauty for the artwork and are limited by the defects in the reproduction. I feel that the point of reference in relation to the reproduction that we create is now dependent on the flaws of the reproduction, which would never be able to capture a painting in exactitude.\n\nHowever, despite the aforementioned opinion as to why reproduction may be detrimental to the status to art, it does help create a more cohesive and involved art community with more participating members as well.\n\nWe cannot deny the evident fact that reproduction brings about the ability for many to be viewing the same piece of work in different times and contexts. Undeniably, the knowledge of the existence of a work would be etched I their minds, knowing that such a image or artwork exists. This brings more participation and possibly generates the interest of more people, making works more relatable “friendly” to the masses. Thanks to reproduction, everyone can begin to learn and use it as a starting point to appreciate art as the historical minority once did.\n\nAs more people come to know about a specific work, the value of the original work increases in its impressiveness in being able to portray the perfect painting and context and even in terms of scale, something that the reproduction is unable to achieve. Relative to quality and flat, barren texture of the print, viewers are then able to fully appreciate the effort of the artist in emphasizing certain impasto, thicker features of an artwork as well as the vibrant colours used when viewing the true artwork.\n\nConsidering the magnitude of the population that fast and efficient reproductions are able to reach out to, it may spark the curiosity in more people who wish to discover the true potential of an artwork as viewed from a museum. This would lead to more being able to benefit from art, which should be the true purpose of art being available for the masses. Therefore, reproductions are able to strengthen the unique value of the original artwork that can serve to benefit more people when viewed.\n\nOne might argue that a reproduction, deviating from its original, exquisite purpose and meaning, might allow someone to make meaning out of the work which complements one’s daily life. For example, it can be said that one is able to grasp one’s own interpretation from a reproduction based on one’s own context to suit the environment. I could serve as a symbol for social discussion and conversations. In certain cases, not knowing the true meaning of an artwork, but allowing the audience to derive a meaning of significance to their personal lives may have already fulfilled the true purpose of the existence of the artwork. More often than not, living in the modern, we are unable to grasp the concepts depicted of traditional, older societies and therefore historical art would probably be more beneficial when we tweak its meaning for the application to our lives.\n\nOverall, I would still conclude that the reproduction of art is indeed more a good thing than a bad thing, to the extent that we do not take artworks and the hard work and labour put into it for granted. Through reproduction, art has definitely been made accessible to more. It does not mean that its original authority has been indefinitely lost, but that the authority of a work lies in its ability to apply to our lives, constantly revising its definition for a larger class of people previously devoid of access to art.\n\nI believe that art and its culture is based on how we define it. We can clearly see that we are no longer upholding the notion of a marginalized people devoid of art, but with the idea of art for the masses sparking back as early as in the 1900s, reproduction is indeed beneficial in spreading art and playing a vital role in maintaining its cultural significance even in or modern society.\n\nSince the day mechanical reproduction dawned upon mankind, our way of life and perception of the world has never been quite the same as it was before. Photography and film-making processes has bestowed human beings the capability to capture a particular moment at the respective present, encapsulating it in a timeless frame and reproducing the image of a conceived image. Undeniably, such colossal alteration is one that revolutionizes, but it is also arguable that it may not necessarily impacted art in a positive manner. It is good insofar as it enforces the impact that art can have on the art world, whereas it is bad if it simply undermined the aforementioned. There are instances whereby the use of photography can be proven to be subversive to art and thus by implication the art world as a whole. However, taking all factors into consideration, it must be recognized that reproduction does more good than harm to art, just as is any radical movement in art history to the development of art in its entirety.\n\nAdmittedly, the photographic reproduction in the mechanical age has in a way mystified the original meaning of art, which is derived from the original artwork itself. This is because the multiplication of the image of an artwork has inevitably caused a mulitplication of meaning of the original itself. The reproduced image, being an imagery referring to the original, has also in a way undermines the authority of an artwork by denying its uniqueness in the world. The combined impact of the two resulted in the diversification of meaning in art, one that depends upon our present culture and context. If one is to be present at the original artwork, the experience that one has is confined to the authority of the artwork itself, which offers authenticity and stillness – qualities which reproduced images are bereft of.\n\nAdditionally, mechanical reproduction has allowed the meaning of art to be transmitted in ways which differ from its original purpose and intention. The cropping of images in photography, for an example, can isolate a particular area in a painting from the overall picture. The decontextualization which takes part through this process has been used in various ways to enforce personal agenda, subjective interpretation or personal argument. The unfaithful usage of art, in this case, is one that dismisses the original intention of artwork, thus again, multiplying its meaning. In a way, the aforementioned are ‘bad’ because they have ‘cheapened’ the original value of art.\n\nYet, it is worth noting that mechanical reproduction only ‘cheapens’ the value of art insofar as the reproduced images are put in the same level as the original. If we look at the original and the reproduced in two different planes, the reproduced images in fact grant the original a heightened sense of originality and authenticity. This is so as the reproduced images cannot be considered as the same as the authentic; the actual artworks or paintings are unlike any other reproduced images which have been disseminated across the globe. This then has a positive effect on art as it increases the perceived value of all artworks, as well as a heightened awareness of original artworks, some of which may not be able to be directly accessed due to geographical limitations or spatial differences.\n\nFollowing that argument, mechanical reproduction has also make possible the dissemination of art via mass media or various communication methods, making art more accessible to the audience in general. Art is thus now free, ubiquitous, and available. This enhances the recognition of artworks around the world, and thus enhancing its influence on the audience. Comparing this with the past, where the circle of art is only confined to the cultured minority, this barrier has been completely removed with the availability of reproduced images in our mundane and everyday context. Almost everyone now can see – or rather visualize – the actual appearance of an artwork, and art thus in a way, by virtue of mechanical reprodution, reach out to a wider audience which encompasses various people from different social group or background. Despite of the difference in knowledge about art across the world’s population, everyone can still experience art in ways which are unprecedented.\n\nUndeniably, mechanical reproduction has a considerable impact on the development of art. This impact is arguably ‘bad’. Yet, upon final analysis, the significant increase in the accessibility of art in our present day overshadows the negative aspects of mechanical reproduction. And as far as mechanical reproduction revolutionizes the way we look at art, it can only be a bad thing as long as we regard a radical change in art in a pejorative manner.\n\nYun Teng here! Before I launch into a proper review, this serves as a form of warmup – just something I wrote casually.\n\nA bit of background – I (not very recently) attended the opening of C L O S U R E Art Show on 12th January 2013 at Teban Gardens (about to be demolished and rebuilt), e, organized by Free Of Charge (FOCA), by the request of a friend of mine (who was organizing the show) to write a response to an assigned work (Marcel Gasper’s Last Look Around). This response was subsequently collated and published (they’re still in the process of doing so). Needless to say, I was a bit overwhelmed by this request but gladly took part. Here’s my response (:\n\nC L O S U R E, organized by Free of Charge Art (FOCA), was an ambitious undertaking with a seemingly simple premise: How do we deal with constant change? When I first stepped into the space I didn’t know what to expect – this concept of change is a common one, widely explored and discussed at that by artists, especially young ones, in Singapore’s constantly evolving (I hesitate to use the word progressing) society. It is also one that I am personally concerned with – from the eyes of an art student, interpreting and processing all the information I receive through the lens of art, it is evident that the only thing that does remain constant through the ages is change. It becomes apparent however, that there is a lot more to this issue than it initially seems; beyond the process, what is more important, I feel, is the impact that it has on us, the receivers and participants of change.\n\nIt was quite refreshing to discover that this exhibition was centered around a concrete context that was in the midst of this change – reflective of the larger society, yet having a very tangible, immediate impact. This said flat in Teban Gardens (of which has been probably demolished at the point of this publication) yielded, if I might venture to call, a nostalgic aura, where much of the initial flat was retained. The intervention by invited artists, I felt, worked well with the space – for example, Shah Rizzal’s graffiti-style installation in the kitchen and Hans Tan’s work that drew inspiration from the immediate space around it.\n\nThis direct contemplation of the context of Teban Gardens was perhaps most evident in Marcel Gasper’s ‘Last Look Around’, a video documentation of the immediate environment surrounding the flat over a period of time. The frames overlap repeatedly until small segments of each time frame can be seen, a linear progression across the screen and at the same time changing as time passes. This dissected series of images which evolve as day becomes night is Marcel’s attempt at capturing change – in the short pocket of time which this flat is still standing, to accurately and wholly retain the essence of a day spent here, a day closer to its eventual, inevitable demolishment. It is mundane, simple, yet poignant – enhanced by the fact that it was presented on an old, large-backed television, the graininess and static ever so slightly present. It grapples with the reality of the destruction by trying to further delay it, to delay the eventual loss of the memory of Teban Gardens as it used to be.\n\nAs a young Singaporean myself, I can wholeheartedly understand this sentiment – it is perhaps because we’ve seen so much change that we struggle to find something solid to hold onto. There is constant construction and deconstruction going on in the city – so much so that if one leaves the country for a couple of years and returns, he wouldn’t be able to recognize it. An occupation with the past hence was something that was raised in the discourse conducted on the opening – is this an obsession that young Singaporeans cannot let go of? Is this a valid concern worth pursuing – looking back as opposed to looking forward? While many felt that it was far more worth it to embrace progression and focus on the ‘creation of new things’, I still hold onto the view that the past is still worth exploring. In many ways, the government has a standard way of dealing with old buildings that have lost their initial purpose – to redeem them as outlets for tourism or entertainment. It seems that the only merit they have is to bring in profits, and sometimes, the historical value of the building is secondary. Sometimes, they aren’t even retained at all, and a new condominium or shopping mall pops up in its place. I feel it is hence necessary to examine this change from a different perspective, an ‘alternative narrative’ if you will, and through this, at times, very emotional and personal exploration of memories and history we are able to arrive at a better understanding at the direction of the path ahead. It certainly can, in my opinion, be a worthwhile pursuit for young artists today. And I felt that C L O S U R E was a comprehensive examination of this issue, enhanced by the great discussion that followed the opening. It certainly left me with a set of my own questions to explore and a greater understanding of the concept of change today.\n\nThat’s all for now! I suppose I just want to reiterate how interesting the experience was – for the first time, I was going to an exhibition not purely for my self-interest, but with an explicit purpose – to write a review/response on it, and consciously analyse my understanding and reactions to the works. I enjoyed it immensely, and without a doubt this is an impressive exhibition for emerging artists and art interest groups alike. A fresh take on an old issue, the enthusiastic discussion I sat in on was enjoyable and I loved how the whole flat was intact – nostalgia, memory, sadness, change.\n\nMore information about the exhibition can be found here: http://www.facebook.com/events/388544111239284/\n\nArtstage 2013 was really an eye-opening experience. Despite this being the third time of my visit to the most renowned art fair in Singapore and the display of recurring artworks, I personally feel that Artstage has continuously offered new perspective and fresh insight into the zeitgeist of the art world. It was such a pity that I can only stay for a duration of 2 and a half hour. Nonetheless, I managed to find several artworks which struck my eye and, better still, inspired me to explore different mediums and techniques in art making.\n\nApart from that, it is interesting to see how Artstage has in a way brought people from different countries into one venue; there are Koreans, Thais, and (most notably) Indonesians who visit Artstage on that day. Here, it seems that Artstage plays the role of being a venue for social discussions, the exchange of ideas, and communication between artists, students, buyers, as well as art patrons. I encountered several artists talking at great length about their works, prospective buyers who are interested in buying Zhang Xiaogang’s artwork, and quite a number of students scrutinizing Phillipe Pasquia’s expressive strokes. Though these groups did not seem to interact with other, they appeared to be brought together under the name of art, and to me, the large number of visitors present speaks volume about the vibrancy of art market in Singapore.\n\nThe works displayed in the art stage have a wide range of medium, starting from the traditional painting medium to quaint and quirky installations which involve music as well as rapid-blinking lighting effect. Despite all this, what engage me the most are the unique usage and manipulation of materials in the works of artists such as – to name a few – Antoni Taples, Adam Cullen, Sean Scully and Adam Neate. I admire the way they express these elements in ways that many could not have think of, and some of these works express emotions which are so genuine that it pulled me from being an audience to being the artists and at times, the subject matter.\n\nSpeaking of subject matter, based on my personal observation, most of the works in Artstage 2013 by and large incorporate contemporaneous topic and issues, namely the transformation of China’s cultural and social landscape, the dwindling appreciation of traditional practices in Indonesia, or even the ideological and political gridlock that exists in various societies at different corners of the world. Some other works are more introspective as they explore issues that are more personal to the artist themselves. The employment of materials (such as stated above) in these artworks is, however, new, fresh, and unconventional, and this fact can be fittingly categorized under being contemporary and avant-garde.\n\nThat being said, I also felt that Artstage has a completely different feel and nuance as compared to museums. It seems that Artstage – being an art fair – does not have any overall curatorial procedures. There are only partitions which demarcates the specific area granted for different galleries which are eligible to display their collections or artworks in the event. I can recall my experience in attending Thai Transience exhibition at Singapore Art Museum, somewhere during late 2012. It seems that the works are arranged in such a manner that those attending museums will go through the chronological order of the development of Thailand art: they will be ‘guided’ by the placement of the artworks and the museum surroundings, from traditional artworks to more contemporary artworks. In Artstage, however, it seems that the galleries are not arranged in any particular way. There is no specific area designated for expressive works. There is no area which contains only Indonesian or Chinese art. Artstage is similar to the conventional notion of a market. It is a place where buyers and sellers interact, only that it has an enhanced function as stated earlier on.\n\nWith this blog, I also want to share my biggest takeaway. I have included Adam Neate as one of my top 10 all time favorite artists. I first saw his work in Flash Art magazine, October 2012. I really thought that his works are flat, with a simple usage of perspex on a two dimensional plane. Not only until I saw the real work that I stood in awe, looking at the protrusion of the perspex into the space between the audience and the artwork. His elegant play of acrylic, spray paint, and other materials such as copper and rusted wire is a testimony of his extensive experimentation – which are later on assembled in a careful and thoughtful manner such that there is a slight feeling of emotional outburst contained within order and solidity. All his works in general shows a substantial influence from Francis Bacon, just that his works are more peacefully executed, and in a way, more whimsical. These three dimensional paintings displayed in gallery A2-04, are the works of a genius. I encourage you to ‘Google’ his works, really creative and elegant.\n\nTo end off, I would just like to say that Artstage 2013 is an awesome experience.\n\nAnd this makes me really looking forward to 2014."
