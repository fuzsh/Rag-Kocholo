        "text": "Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s and denotes the styles and philosophy of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation. It's a chronological compilation of 100 years of Art movements by Ar. Kush Jee Kamal (India) for the benefits of all the art lovers."
