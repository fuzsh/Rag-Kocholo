        "text": "As previously mentioned in my other blog posts, the term ‘readymade’ was created by Marcel Duchamp and was used to describe his works of art made from ordinary, everyday objects. I looked at Fountain in more detail in my last blog post as this is the readymade that the Fountain 17 brief is based around, however here I want to look at some of his other work and readymades (before and after Fountain) in a bit more detail to get a better idea of Duchamp’s work and life.\n\nWhen doing a bit of further research I found out that Duchamp was one of the three artists – along with Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse – who was responsible for the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts, and in painting and sculpture, at the beginning of the 20th century. Because of this, his term ‘readymades’ actually went on to describe the work of other artists too. It became a more general description and was associated with the works of people like Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst and Michael Landy. This shows how big of an impact his work made and still continues to make even today.\n\nDuchamp’s Theory of the Readymade\n\nCreating a readymade was more than just picking a random, everyday object that Duchamp liked, he actually described it as a theory and there was much deeper thought behind each of the readymades in his collection. However having said this, he did deliberately choose ordinary, functional and ‘rather dull’ objects:\n\n“(His choice was) …based on a reaction of visual indifference, with at the same time a total absence of good or bad taste“\n\nDuchamp said that the choice and process of choosing the object in itself was a creative act and that by cancelling or eliminating the useful function of the object it also becomes art. This made me understand the idea behind the readymades a lot more and provokes a lot of thought into the idea of what a readymade could be and if anything can be a readymade. It suggests that once you’ve chosen the object it’s purpose changes from whatever function it was meant for to a work of art instead. It also has new meaning once it has been situated or presented somewhere new (perhaps in contradiction to what the object is) and also when it has been given the addition of a title because this makes it ‘a new thought’.\n\nIn the May 1917 issue of The Blind Man (also ran by Duchamp) he said:\n\n“Whether Mr Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance. He CHOSE it. He took an ordinary article of life, and placed it so that it’s useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view – created a new thought for that object“\n\nDuchamp’s collection of readymades championed the principal that what is art is defined by the artist and at this time in particular (the beginning of the conceptual art movement) the artist became a ‘chooser’ as oppose to a ‘maker’ – he changed the definition of an artist. Duchamp also described the readymades as:\n\n“an ordinary object elevated to the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist“\n\nWork Before Fountain (pre 1917)\n\nIn 1912 Duchamp created the abstract art painting ‘Nude Descending a Staircase (2)’. This piece has clear influences of the cubist art movement and is largely regarded as a modernist classic, becoming one of the most famous paintings of this time. With this piece Duchamp wanted the subject to be represented whilst in motion, as opposed to just being viewed from one angle. When it was exhibited in New York in 1913 it sparked quite an uproar in the art world mainly because no one had considered a ‘nude’ doing something as common as just walking down a staircase before.\n\nA year later (1913) Duchamp created ‘3 Standard Stoppages’ made out of wood, glass and paint on canvas. When describing this piece Duchamp said: “This experiment was made in 1913 to imprison and preserve forms obtained through chance, my chance”. He made it by dropping 3 one meter long threads from one meter high onto 3 canvas strips and then stuck the threads to the canvas, preserving the curves they had made when landing on the canvas. It was suggested that he could have been influenced by science books about the relativity of all standards of measurements and that the piece was actually a joke about the meter as it was made at a time when there was generally a lot of skepticism about the validity of scientific knowledge. It was also said that the concept for this piece may have been linked to Duchamp’s admiration for the French humorist and symbolist writer Alfred Jarry (1873 – 1907).\n\nI found this quote taken from a Duchamp interview in 1961 particularly interesting because it hints at a conceptual relationship between 3 Standard Stoppages and his readymades:\n\n“(His most famous work to date) I’d say the 3 Standard Stoppages of 1913. That was when I really tapped the mainspring of my future. In itself it was not an important work of art, but for me it opened the way – the way to escape from those traditional methods of expression long associated with art…For me, the 3 Stoppages was a first gesture liberating me from the past“\n\nIn 1916, ‘With Hidden Noise’ was created by Duchamp as part of the readymades collection. This was a collaborative piece of work created with the help of his friend Walter Arensberg who was an American art collector, critic and poet. The piece consists of a ball of twine between two brass plates which are joined by four screws and also a hidden object placed in the ball of twine by Walter Arensberg. He was instructed by Duchamp to loosen the long screws holding he construction together and place the item inside without telling him or anyone else what the object is – it still remains a mystery to this day. All anyone knows is that whatever object he placed inside makes a noise, hence the title ‘With Hidden Noise’. Duchamp said the piece isn’t designed to just be looked at but for action as well like to be held or shaken.\n\nWork After Fountain (post 1917)\n\nAfter Fountain Duchamp’s readymades were more elaborate and were referred to mostly as ‘assisted readymades’.\n\n‘The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even’ was created by Duchamp in 1923 but was later referred to as the ‘Large Glass’. The piece consists of two panes of glass and materials such as lead foil, fuse wire and dust and is over 9 feet tall. He began to make it in New York in 1915 and continued to work on the piece bit by bit before he went on a trip to Europe in 1923 – it was at this point he declared that it was ‘definitively unfinished’. It was originally bought by his good friend Walter Arensberg in 1918 but Arsenberg then went on to sell it in 1921 due to him moving to Los Angeles. He sold it to Katherine S Dreier so that the piece of art could stay situated in New York and therefore Duchamp could continue to work on the piece as and when he pleased. A few years later in 1926, after the piece was finished, it was on it’s way back from it’s first exhibition when it was shattered. The damage to it was actually not discovered until several years later when it’s case was opened – it was eventually fully repaired by Duchamp himself in 1936. In 1952 Katherine (still the owner of the artwork) died and it was passed on to the Philadelphia Museum of Art where it remains now.\n\n‘L.H.O.O.Q’ was created in 1919 by Duchamp and was one of his ‘assisted readymades’. This readymade is a reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci’s iconic Mona Lisa which Duchamp then added a moustache, a beard and the title ‘L.H.O.O.Q’ to. The title of this readymade is a pun – when said in French it sounds like ‘she’s got a big ass’. This in itself offended a lot of people and it was seen as an attack on this famous piece of work and traditional art in general, on the other hand people argued it was just Duchamp’s sense of humour. As with others of his readymades, he made multiple versions of this piece including an unmodified reproduction in black and white which he entitled ‘L.H.O.O.Q Shared’.\n\n‘Why Not Sneeze, Rose Selavy?’ is a 1921 readymade sculpture, or more specifically an assisted readymade, which reflects the Dada art movement. This piece of artwork consists of a small birdcage with 4 wooden bars fitted inside, a thermometer, a cuttlefish bone and 152 marble blocks cut to resemble sugar lumps. On the underside of the cage the title and the date of the work have been affixed in black letters. Rose Selavy was Duchamp’s female alter ego and first appeared in his work in 1920 – her name in French reads as ‘eros, c’est la vie’ which translates to mean ‘physical love is life’. He explained the title of this piece in a TV interview in 1963:\n\n“You don’t sneeze at will; you usually sneeze in spite of your will. So the answer to the question ‘Why not sneeze?’ is simply that you can’t sneeze at will!“"
