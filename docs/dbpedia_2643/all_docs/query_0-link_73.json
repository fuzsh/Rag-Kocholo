        "text": "Deconstruction of Innocence Worship at Jennie Richee (blengigomeneans) 2018-23 50.5x51.5x2” Crayola crayon, gesso, polyester rug, poplar panel *available\n\nTruncated image from a late American naive artist, Henry Darger’s collaged illustration accompanying his epic narrative, The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion. This partial scene depicts a brief, peaceful respite of darling mythical species called the \"Blengigomeneans;\" gigantic winged beings with curved horns who occasionally take human or part-human form, even disguising themselves as children. Although mostly benevolent, some Blengins are extremely suspicious of all humans, due to Glandelinian atrocities.\n\nSHAM-FU’S 2018 39”x39”x2” crayon/linen/panel *available\n\nAltered screenshot still from opening scenes of Prest-O Change-O, a 1939 Merrie Melodies short film directed by Chuck Jones and released by Warner Bros, where a dogcatcher chases two puppies into an ostensibly haunted house. The cartoon features the second appearance of Bugs Bunny as Sham-Fu, the magician’s manic pet white hare who made his first appearance in Porky's Hare Hunt, which was produced and copyrighted in 1937 and released in April 1938, featuring him in the same early design. This is also the character's first appearance in a Merrie Melodies color film.\n\nFerdinand 2018 12x12x2” Crayola crayon, linen, poplar *SOLD Kentucky\n\nOriginal image screenshot from Ferdinand the Bull , a 1938 American stand-alone animated short produced by Walt Disney Productions and released on November 25, 1938, by RKO Radio Pictures. It was directed by Dick Rickard and based on the 1936 book The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf. The music was by Albert Hay Malotte, most known for his setting of The Lord's Prayer, commonly sung at weddings.\n\nAustin substituted a radiant cow pie and accompanying flies in contrast to Ferdinand’s aromatic flower.\n\nMICKEY’S TRAILER 2017 12x12x2” crayon/linen/panel *available\n\nMickey's Trailer is a 1938 American animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. The cartoon stars Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy on a near disastrous road trip in a travel trailer. Animators include Ed Love, Louie Schmitt, Johnny Cannon, Don Patterson, Clyde Geronimi, Tom Palmer, Frenchy de Trémaudan and Cy Young. Pete makes a cameo in this cartoon where he is seen driving a truck during the \"Runaway Trailer\" sequence featuring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. This cartoon was released about five months after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It was the 100th short in the Mickey Mouse film series to be released, and the second for that year.\n\nHOOK & LADDER 2017 10x10x2” crayon/linen/panel *SOLD Indiana\n\nFire Chief is a 1940 Disney short film starring Donald Duck and his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. During the cartoon, Donald’s impetuous antics cause the fire house and the fire truck to burn down completely and, to add insult to injury, his hat burns down as well, resulting in its burnt frames becoming Donald's 'hair'. Defeated, he looks at the camera and says to the audience \"You can't win. You just can't win.\"\n\nIf You Don’t Please 2017 12x12x2” Crayola Crayon, linen, poplar *available\n\nLady and the Tramp is a 1955 American animated musical romance film produced by Walt Disney and released by Buena Vista Film Distribution.

Pictures. The cartoon’s title is a Brooklyn-accented way of saying \"gets the bird\", which can refer to an obscene gesture, or as simply the \"Bronx cheer.” It marks the first appearance of Beaky Buzzard in a Warner Bros. short… Beaky is tasked by his mother to catch Bugs for dinner, during the pursuit role reversals flip back and forth, including a scene with the pair dancing the ‘jitterbug,’ and concludes with an imperiled Beaky being released unharmed back to the wings of his mother, who declares Bugs a hero, kissing the mimicking bashful bunny.\n\nAriel 2017 12x12x2” Crayola crayon, linen, poplar *SOLD Kentucky\n\nThe Little Mermaid is a 1989 American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures.

The short was based on the European folk tale \"Henny Penny\", known in the United States as \"Chicken Little\". It is an anti-Nazi film showing the evils of mass hysteria.\n\nFoxy Loxy reads aloud a passage describing the best way to manipulate the whole flock is to begin with \"the least intelligent\". He soon identifies Chicken Little as that yo-yo wielding simpleton and convinces him that “the sky is falling.” Panic spreads throughout the flock and they all hightail it into a cave for safety, which turns out to be the fox’s den which Loxy immediately seals once all are inside.\n\nWhile the narrator reassures the audience that everything will be alright, the cartoon closes with a now pot bellied Foxy Loxy picking his teeth and arranging the wishbones of the devoured birds in a row resembling a war cemetery. The narrator is shocked and insists that this is not how the story was supposed to end. Foxy Loxy responds in a fourth wall breaking moment by reminding the narrator not to believe everything he reads.\n\nPostdated Painting 2016 9x9x4” vinyl on styrofoam\n\nAustin’s friend and classmate, Kahlil Robert Irving was producing beautiful cast porcelain food boxes that piqued Austin’s interest.\n\nAustin purchased two of these works from Tucker Pierce at Westminster Press Gallery located at 3156 Cherokee St in St. Louis with the intention of recontextualizing the works as his own after some calculated intervention, but quickly realized that he couldn't risk the displeasure of fucking up the things.\n\nAfter finishing a meal of snoots from Smoki O’s BBQ, Austin scrubbed clean the white box and painted one of Irving’s favorite repeated phrases on the surface using black flashe paint. Although completed on February 28th, 2016, the title is derivative of the decision to assign the birth of the work for the following date (leap day).\n\nArchitecture and Morality (after Falkowski) 2015 30x80x2 acrylic on interior door *available\n\nDistorted image screenshot from American artist Andrew Falkowski’s faculty page at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where Austin received Falkowski’s tutelage during a semester-long painting seminar course. The original digital image documents a photographed a cropped perspective of an installation of paintings and sculptures from a 2013 exhibition at the Suburban gallery in Chicago, that Austin only experienced virtually over a year after the exhibition with Karl Erickson titled Architecture and Morality. Although initially encouraged by Falkowski, Austin was promptly unfriended and ghosted by Falkowski following his move to graduate school in St. Louis, to Austin’s dismay and regret.\n\nInsolated (after Picabia) 2014 18x36x2” acrylic on canvas *available\n\nMy first larger work completed as a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago was this skewed, distorted, transposed, and redacted image of Francis Picabia’s 10x10’ oil painting Edtaonisl (Ecclesiastic) from 1913, prominently displayed in the Art Institute of Chicago’s permanent collection. This work relates to Picabia’s experience aboard a transatlantic ship, en route to the opening of the Armory Show, North America’s first major exhibition of modern art. Picabia was amused by two fellow passengers—a Polish dancer named Stacia Napierskowska and a Dominican priest who could not resist the temptation of watching her rehearse with her troupe. The word Edtaonisl—an acronym made by alternating the letters of the French words étoile (star) and dans[e] (dance), a process analogous to the artist’s shattering and recombining of forms. He subtitled the work Ecclesiastic, hinting at the juxtaposition of the spiritual and the sensual. Austin rearranged the letters again in anagram play to ‘insolated,’ a synonym for ‘enlightened.’\n\nEcce Homo 2011 16x20x1.5” oil on canvas over panel *available\n\nOriginal image cropped from screenshot of Guido Reni’s painting, Ecce Homo from the National Gallery, London’s collection. Interested in the painting techniques of American painter, Chuck Close, Austin reverse-engineered Close’s printmaking methodology in order to develop his own derivative system for creating mosaic-style paintings from simple marks and geometric symbols meticulously layered upon one another in a sequence of democratic value distribution across the picture plane. Painted with the Gamblin Color’s torrit grey paint produced that year, Austin won Gamblin’s painting competition and was awarded $500 of discounted oil paint supplies.\n\nA Horse of a Different Colour in Motion 2010 24x36x2”each oil on canvas *three SOLD/ nine available\n\nOriginal images taken from Eadweard Muybridge’s 1878 automatic electro-photographs of Sallie Gardner at a Gallop. It was my first attempt to create a video for an exhibition which was projected and displayed with the twelve ‘colorized’ paintings at the Tim Faulkner Gallery on April 29, 2010.\n\nMaj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart 2010 30x40x2” oil on canvas *SOLD Virginia\n\nAustin is a direct descendant (*great,great,great,great,great grandson) of Stuart who was ‘the eyes and ears of Gen. Lee’ for the Confederacy during the American Civil War and his father-in-law, Col. Philip St. George Cooke who was ‘the Father of the U.S. Cavalry,’ for the Union. This controversial lineage is a part of Austin’s inherited identity that he continues to digest and reconcile.\n\nThis painting is in the permanent collection of the Laurel Hill Museum.\n\nRick Pitino 2009 48x60x2” acrylic on canvas *available\n\nImage originally cropped from Pitino’s Wikipedia page in 2009 while the had coach of University of Louisville’s Mens Basketball team. Austin began painting the portrait on April 9, 2009 and on On April 18, 2009, Pitino announced that he was the target of an extortion attempt by Karen Cunagin Sypher, the wife of UofL’s equipment manager, with whom Pitino had an affair with in 2003, resulting in Pitino paying her $3000 dollars to cover an abortion procedure, and later Sypher demanded a payment of vehicles, tuition for her children, and $10 million in order to secure her silence. Austin completed the painting on May 1, 2009.\n\nAustin’s painting of Pitino made headlines in October 2017 when it was photographed being removed from the YUM! center following his termination as a result of an alleged “pay for play” scheme involving the Adidas brand and UofL recruits."
