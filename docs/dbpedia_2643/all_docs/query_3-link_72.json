        "text": "When researching Marcel Duchamp and his life/work there were a couple of names that I came across that I thought I’d look into a bit more. I found out that the other leading ‘avant garde’ artists at this time were Man Ray and Francis Picabia and they were friends of Duchamp too. All three of them shared a love for art and their beliefs about challenging traditional art created a strong chemistry between them. They were able to respond freely and without obligation to each others work and ideas leaving them inspired by one another – this becomes clear by the strong influences of Duchamp in both Man Ray and Francis Picabia’s works of art. It has been described that their artistic dialogue was filled with jokes and innuendos just like in pieces of Duchamp’s work as he was known for his ‘boyish’ sense of humour.\n\nMan Ray\n\nMan Ray (1890 – 1976) was a visual artist who was born in Philadelphia, but spent most of his working life in France, and specialised predominantly in painting and photography. His contributions to the art world can be linked mostly to the Dada, Surrealist and Cubist art movements, much like Duchamp. Although he was best known for his fashion and portrait photography, he considered himself primarily a painter above everything else. However, he produced some of the most celebrated fashion and portrait photographs of the modern era. Man Ray first met Duchamp in New York in 1915 and began to collaborate with him on founding the Dada movement. His work also included sculpture, film, print and poetry.\n\n“Nature does not create works of art. It is we, and the faculty of interpretation peculiar to the human mind, that see art“\n\nInspired by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’s La Grande Baigneuse, Ray used Kiki de Montparnasse wearing a turban as a model for this piece. He transformed the female body into a musical instrument by painting sound-holes on her back, playing with the idea of objectification of an animate body. Throughout his career Man Ray was fascinated with juxtaposing an object with a female body.\n\n(Taken from http://www.theartstory.org/artist-ray-man.htm)\n\nThis is an assisted readymade created by Man Ray which consists of a sewing machine wrapped in an army blanket and then tied with string. Duchamp’s influences are clear in this piece and it also has strong links to the Dada movement. The name of this piece comes from Isidore Ducasse (1846-70) who was a French poet and the inspiration comes from a quote in his book which is entitled Les Chants de Maldoror (1869). The quote says “Beautiful as the chance meeting, on a dissecting table, of a sewing machine and an umbrella”.\n\nFrancis Picabia\n\nFrancis Picabia (1879 – 1953) was a French painter, poet and writer, mostly associated with Cubism. He was described as flamboyant and became famous for defying the conventions of ‘good taste’. Along with Duchamp and Man Ray, he was a major figure in the Dada movement and remains one of the most intriguing artists of his century. His work was diverse and varied; he was known for not just clinging to one particular approach.\n\n“Artists, so they say, make fun of the bourgeoisie; me, I make fun of the bourgeoisie and the artists“\n\nAfter World War I broke out, Picabia became fascinated with the idea of industrial objects as a pictorial source. He once wrote that “the machine has become more than a mere adjunct of life. It is really a part of human life…perhaps the very soul…I have enlisted the machinery of the modern world, and introduced it into my studio.” His goal, he said, was to invent a “mechanical symbolism,” and this piece is one of his most important examples, since critics have read it as an image of a sexual act rendered in mechanical terms. Although, at first glance, it might be hard to read in these terms, Picabia may well have been inspired by his friend Marcel Duchamp to bury sexual references in images of machines.\n\n(Taken from http://www.theartstory.org/artist-picabia-francis.htm)\n\nDances at the Spring is a piece of artwork directly linked to one of Duchamp’s; it echoes his ‘Nudes Descending a Staircase’ painting. Picabia had met Duchamp approximately one year before he created this piece which shows how much of an influence he had on him and his work. It is an abstract painting through which Picabia showed one of his own experiences of what he had seen whilst on his honeymoon in Italy. Although it is abstract he also wanted to show movement and excitement in the image which is why he decided to use such vivid colours. He actually originally painted two versions of this image, however one was lost and the other went on to exhibited in New York in 1913.\n\n“The world is divided into two categories: failures and unknowns“\n\nTogether Duchamp, Man Ray and Picabia became the leading figures in the Dada movement in New York and collectively rebelled against the norms of traditional art, changing the way we see art and challenging what it can be."
