        "text": "The aim of this essay is to imagine how transposition could be conceived of as a method of artistic research practice. The topic is speculative. It models processes before they are explicitly tried out. In other words, I consider transposition here to be a methodological hypothesis. Given that the intended use of the model is as both a heuristic and an analytical tool for planning and assessing concrete research projects, it is based not on practical examples but on descriptions of certain generally recognisable features in different kinds of practices, insofar as they coincide with artistic practices. As in speculative realism, the aim is to understand the logic of the real regardless of a human viewpoint. In my previous writings, I have analysed how artistic research can be seen as a continuation of institutional critique (Kirkkopelto 2015). Here I will consider how research in the arts relates to its avant-gardist legacy, and especially to the tendencies that today are considered “anti-art” (McEvilley 2005) or “nonart” (Kaprow 2003).\n\nThis chapter discusses the labor of balancing elements in forging a research question. There’s this artistic balancing of abstract and pragmatic concerns moved by the momentum of a work’s idiosyncratic logic.The abstract side of my work as a performance researcher-maker desires getting lost in experiment after experiment, letting the momentum of material unfold in improvisation, writing, collaboration, and the possibilities that emerge as concepts are translated between technical disciplines—choreography, theatre, poetic writing, film making, visual art, philosophy, sound composition. Our work folds and unfolds through the possibilities and constraints presented by specific practices, tipping the artistic language of a project into articulation. Pragmatic procedures also generate the shapes of performance research—funding proposals, audiences, the availability of collaborators, the value systems and languages imposed by academic journals or producers. The desire to tour work and make it available to audiences beyond an immediate artistic community. The desire to reach out to international collaborators and move ideas out of a comfort zone of practice and into something else, to stretch and challenge. These forces limit and expand the shape of a devising process. Then, we have the unruly materiality of all the procedures—the weather, the textures of objects, the limitations, and the desire paths that cannot be envisaged in advance. We have the knowledge of certain failure. The blooming creative shapes of a new project open a sense of potentiality that will most likely be derailed (most likely many times, in many ways). We know the remains will be a detritus of surviving ideas, the best that could be done under the circumstances through the entanglement of the unruly, the pragmatic, and the abstract. The way one frames unexpected occurrences and failures could be considered central to a creative methodology. If methodology emerges out of a precarious equation of balancing, the way a performance researcher deals with unexpected shifts in materials and conceptual flows is telling of how research will progress. This chapter goes on to discuss interdisciplinary practice underpinning the work Mistranslation Laboratory - a miniature world with its own highly specific logic. The demand that our work be useful was an agential force, as was the demand of undoing the instrumental imperative of use. Different work contexts generate tension and flow, carrying value systems that push in contradictory directions.\n\nWe often forget that art and science are not dissociated, nor indeed antagonistic , but rather allow a creative interplay to emerge from which arises the generation of new forms of knowledge (Miller [1995]: 190). According to Parkinson, \"the analogy between the new painting and the new physics consists in that elements formerly held as cognitive or conceptual a-prioris enter as constitutive factors in the very structure of the edifices of art and science\" (Parkinson [2008]: 161). How exactly does it work? If for us nowadays it's relatively easy to think of the mimetic moment of art as a prelude to geometry, it is not so trivial to claim how higher-order representational symbolic epistemic structures (h.o.r.s.e.s.) arise from the lifeworld, or simply how both interact together. The aim of this paper is to stake out the complexity of processes going from the lifeworld and, before that, from the life of pictorial language, to h.o.r.s.e.s., in order to apply this model to further enquiries. In the first part, we will reactivate the Kantian interdependence between aesthetics and epistemology via the intersubjective dimension , in order to understand how the shaping of forms and the figuring-out patterns remain an essential component of any epistemic structure as such. In the second part, moving from Hacking, Husserl and Foucault, we will look into the way in which the evidence of symbolic structures can be maintained even alongside a genetic conception of science. Art plays an essential role in such a conception, in that it opens new horizons of figurativity in which new shapes can arise and new kinds of objectivities (Gegenständlichkeiten) can be accepted as belonging to our epistemic experience of the world."
