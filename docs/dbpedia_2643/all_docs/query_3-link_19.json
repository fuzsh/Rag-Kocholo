        "text": "The role and experience of the viewer\n\nDespite the often aloof, cerebral quality of his pieces, for Duchamp the viewer was critically important. In a 1957 lecture, he described how “The creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act.” [1]\n\nKhan Academy video wrapper\n\nRotoreliefs featured in Duchamp’s film Anémic Cinéma (1926) © Succession Marcel Duchamp (The Museum of Modern Art)\n\nAs if to emphasize the viewer’s role, many of Duchamp’s pieces explore notions of visual perception. In the 1920s he constructed two large, motorized machines on standing frames. Rotary Glass Plates (1920) and Rotary Demisphere (1925) are made of, respectively, spinning rectangular plates which are read as a completed circle when in motion, and a rotating spiral which creates a dizzying dimensionality. Their whole purpose was simply to create these visual effects in the eye of the viewer.\n\nRelatedly, Duchamp also created Rotoreliefs—boxed sets of six cardboard disks printed with various circular patterns. When a disk is placed on a rotating record turntable it produces a compelling illusion. These days Duchamp’s optical works are considered predecessors of the psychedelic-era “Op Art” of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nThe importance of the viewer for Duchamp is also suggested by the fact that some of his works invite participation, at least implicitly. This is especially true of the readymades. It is hard to resist turning the Bicycle Wheel, made from a wheel and fork mounted on a stool, or shake With Hidden Noise, a ball of twine with metal plates on either end, to hear the rattling object inside. A person might consider clearing sidewalks with the ordinary snow shovel In Advance of the Broken Arm or relieving themselves in the commercially produced urinal “Fountain” (this actually happened, in the first instance, by a janitor outside a museum in the 1940s, and then later by an artist in 1990).\n\nDuchamp sometimes gave the viewer specific (and absurd) instructions for experiencing his pieces. For instance, the title of an optical glass work he made in 1917 reads, To Be Looked At (from the Other Side of the Glass) with One Eye, Close to, for Almost an Hour (1918). And for the cover of a 1947 exhibition catalogue, Duchamp painted almost a thousand rubber “falsies” (prosthetic breasts), and attached a label asking the viewer to “Prière de Toucher” [“Please Touch”]. These strategies disrupt the usual, distant relationship between art objects and the audience, but they also critique and complicate it.\n\nRrose Sélavy\n\nPerhaps Duchamp’s most elaborate and sophisticated challenge to creative norms was his invention of a separate artist altogether: “Rrose Sélavy” (c. 1920-21). Her name has been translated in many ways, but most often phonetically as “Eros [love], that is life.” To photograph Rrose, Duchamp enlisted the help of friends Louise Norton, a writer and editor, and Man Ray, a photographer and artist. Duchamp himself is done up in drag, dressed as a stylish, modern woman wearing a dress, wig, hat, and make-up. Norton crouched behind him, and it is her more feminine arms and hands that we see. Another photograph of Rrose was also featured on the label for a “rectified readymade,” a fake commercial cologne bottle labeled Belle Haleine, Eau de Voilette [Beautiful Breath, Veil Water] (1920–21). Imitating a commercial product poses interesting questions about commodity versus artistic production.\n\nAppearing at a time when Duchamp was famously thought to have given up art altogether, Rrose continued to “make” pieces. Her name appears on many of Duchamp’s pieces including the “assisted readymade,” Why Not Sneeze, Rose Sélavy (1921/1964), a birdcage filled with marble cubes, a thermometer, and a bird’s cuttlebone. Her name is part of a tongue-twisting pun on the aforementioned Rotary Demisphere and as the signature on Fresh Widow (1920), a reduced scale French-style window with black leather panes. Rrose’s importance to Duchamp is evident in the very title of his miniature, portable display of his own art: Box in a Suitcase: from or by Rrose Sélavy or Marcel Duchamp (1935–41). In the last two decades, scholars have been extremely interested in the gender-transforming nature of Rrose, drawing on feminism, gender studies, and queer theory to understand the implications of Duchamp’s radical creation."
