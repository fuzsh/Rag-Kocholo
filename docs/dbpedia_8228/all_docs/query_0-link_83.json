        "text": "Hermann Pressman's Diary\n\nAntwerp, Belgium from May 9, 1933, through April 12, 1934\n\nphoto:Â Hermann and his sister, Sonia, at the City Park in Antwerp, circa 1933-34.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 6:20 p.m., May 9, 1933.\n\nSaturday, I awoke at 6:30 a.m. and helped in the business until the afternoon. My mother gave me 200 marks pocket money for my trip. I bought my train ticket for 34 marks and 20 pfennige. On Thursday I had gathered my savings: 2,380 marks. This was put away in my mother's bank. Then my parents sewed 10,000 marks into my suits and toiletries. Friday evening they finished this work. One thousand marks was in the suitcase. Saturday evening my father gave me a spring suit as a present. In exchange, I left last year's top coat in the store to be sold.\n\nSaturday at 9:45 p.m., I boarded the train and left. I traveled in third class. By 6:30 a.m., I was in Cologne, where we had to change trains. By 7:30 a.m., I was at the German border of Aix-la-Chapelle. I was nervous about the border patrol, but the board patrolman checked my passport and asked how much money I had without incident. In the small town of Habistown shortly thereafter, the Belgian border patrolman looked into only one valise. He never even bothered with the second. I sent a telegram to my parents: \"Regards and Kisses.\" We changed trains again at 11:30 a.m. in Brussels. When I arrived in Antwerp, my cousin, David Mendelson, was waiting for me.\n\nI conversed with people in English. The English was very helpful as many Belgians spoke English, but not German. I do not speak Flemish or French. For fifteen francs in Antwerp, I sent my parents a telegram saying: \"Good. David.\"Â\n\nDavid's wife had cleaned an extra room. After we had eaten on Sunday afternoon, I removed the money still hidden in my belongings. Monday I went to Wexelstuben, where there were small banks and exchange offices, to exchange currencies. Regular banks did not want to take German money. Max Fisher gave me 81,700 francs for the German marks.\n\nI went to the Committee for German Immigrants. There, I learned that there may be a chance for me to remain in Belgium. My parents would have to apply for visas to join me. I rented a safe deposit box in the Diamond Club to place my 81,700 francs. I began to get acquainted with Antwerp. I bought some household items and went home.\n\nToday I bought a picture postcard for my parents with the text: \"Good. Happy.\" I sent another with the text: \"Best Regards, Hermann\" to Sonia Klein. I returned again to visit the Committee for German Immigrants because I am still unable to register with the local police in Antwerp. Today I received a letter from my parents, and I sent them in Hebrew a letter by airmail. I hope that will not be censored. I told them to leave Germany.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 7:05 p.m., May 10, 1933\n\nLast night I took a walk with Cousin David. David said he had many obligations, and I needed to lend him twelve hundred francs. [I do not remember if he paid any of it back.] Today I went with David's wife to buy food. I put my belongings away in the closet they let me use. Today I would like to go out a bit, but I don't know if my English is good enough. My English is coming in handy.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 10:50 p.m., May 11, 1933.\n\nToday I went back to the Committee for German Immigrants. Now I am allowed to register at the local police station. I stated that l was a resident and had 100,000 francs so that I would not need a temporary permit. I also stated that I could prove that I had 100,000 francs. Today I wrote a letter to my parents asking them to send money to German companies and give me the money order stubs so I could collect Belgian francs for the amount they sent from Max Fisher. I have taken a job at a men's clothing store to work in the late afternoons.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 9:15 a.m., May 14, 1933.\n\nFriday I registered my legal residence in Antwerp and started to decorate the display window at the Mendelson Shoe Store. The Mendelsons took me to the Century Hotel; since there was no dancing, we went to a dance club called Saturday. The crowd was small but mixed. We came home by 2 a.m. Yesterday I completed decorating my cousin's display windows. I sent my mother a postcard, saying, \"I am thinking of you on Mother's Day.\" Last night, I telephoned my mother for thirty francs and explained the situation about the money. Yesterday afternoon I was at the business, but the business was closed; this is not good. Last night I received a long letter from my parents. I wrote a letter to David Mendelson's mother in Poland.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 12 p.m., May 15, 1933.\n\nYesterday afternoon I napped. After 5 p.m., I went to the barber shop and then went out to dinner. By 5:30 p.m., David's son had run away, and we did not find him until 9 p.m., After 10 p.m., David and I went to a beer garden to dance; I spent twelve francs. This week, I spent a few extra francs for carfare, drinks, postage, etc. Today I went with David to the post office to pick up 1,600 francs and sixteen centimes. My parents sent that to David Mendelson for me. I sent a postcard to Sonia Klein, asking her to write to me. Now I am angry that I wasn't able to straighten out the financial situation for my parents because I did not get the money order stubs that I needed in order to exchange money for them.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 8:30 p.m., May 15, 1933.\n\nThis afternoon I was at Max Fisher's exchange office. Then I went to the Committee regarding the application for a more permanent residency card. I bought five pairs of silk socks for 50 francs. For twenty-nine francs, I telephoned my parents and sister. My mother thanked me for the Mother's Day card. She then told me she was not interested in getting their German money exchanged so they could leave Germany.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 1:00 p.m., May 16, 1933.\n\nYesterday afternoon I went to the Diamond Club and deposited 1,800 francs. After dinner, I relaxed. Today I received a letter from my parents repeating that they were not interested in getting money out of Germany. They told me not to worry. I hope they are right, and that all works out for the best for them. I had meant well, but meaning well and doing well is not always the same.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 8:55 p.m., May 16, 1933.\n\nAfter lunch I lay down and rested. I returned to the currency exchange office and gave their employee the information about my parents' plans. Tomorrow, I am going to the Yiddish theater.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 1:10 p.m., May 17, 1933.\n\nYesterday I took the two prophylactics and blew them up like balloons. I gave one to each of David's children. I checked how strong they were. Today I bought a bottle of wine for seven-and-a-half francs. Today I returned to Max Fisher's office. I bought three pairs of socks for 21 francs. I wrote to Aunt Mendelson in Poland and to the Bank of France in Paris. The bank wrote that they were holding the money for my father awaiting his direction, and that they were unable to open an account or hold the money longer since my father was a foreigner. I contacted the Antwerp branch of CrÃ©dit Lyonnais for Paris. There I learned that without being an owner or tenant myself, I was unable to open a bank account. I also had to request a blank signed letter with my father's signature so I could get his money moved from Paris to Belgium. Meanwhile, that money remains at CrÃ©dit Lyonnais in Paris. Once again, I returned to the Committee and learned how my parents would be able to travel here with their furniture. I am sending this information in a letter to my parents now. I expect that it won't be long now before Germany will once again be at war with the world.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 10:30 a.m., May 18, 1933.\n\nYesterday afternoon, I rested, and then after dinner, I went into town to the Yiddish theater. IÂ paid six francs to see a Yiddish movie, The Eternal Jew. Afterwards, I came home and went to sleep.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 9:35 a.m., May 19, 1933.\n\nYesterday before noon I went with my cousin's sons to Rivierenhof, a beautiful park. I bought some small toys for the children. That afternoon, I ate lunch and received a letter from parents. I answered their letter that afternoon and told them the situation of the Parisian banks. After dinner, I shopped with my cousin for food. I was asleep by midnight.\n\nI am very glad that my Flemish has improved enough so that I can understand people and get around.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 3:30 p.m., May 19, 1933.\n\nAt about 10 a.m., I had photos taken of me in the street. Afterwards, I was in the Reverian House in the park to which I had taken my cousin's children. I drank underground spring water from a well in the park.\n\nI sent a postcard to the Nachman family [a Jewish family] in Berlin. (The Voltsehleger family [which was not Jewish] in Berlin coveted the ring on Mr. Nachman's finger. They loaded him onto a truck, and because they couldn't take the ring off his finger, they broke his finger. He was detained in the barracks for Jews for several nights. Several nights after he was returned home, he was again picked up for \"interrogation.\" A few nights later, his wife received a call to pick up the body of her deceased husband. She was told that if she wanted to get possession of her husband's body for burial, she had to sign a form testifying to the fact that he had died of natural causes.)\n\nI gathered information on French language instruction. I came home and napped.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 11:15 p.m., May 19, 1933.\n\nI shaved and walked through town. After dinner, I made Kiddush and went out with my friend, Sam Fishel, the barber, for drinks.\n\nAntwerp, Saturday 3:15 p.m., May 20, 1933.\n\nThis morning I took my cousin's two oldest children to Rivieren Park. We took photos and drank from the underground well. I drew a picture of a woman's head and sent it to my parents. I bought some strawberries. I picked up my recently-developed pictures for six francs.Â These photos are in my album under 93 and 93a. I had lunch and will now take a nap.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 12:00. May 21, 1933.\n\nYesterday afternoon, after a two-hour nap, I went for a walk with the barber. Then, after dinner, at 9 p.m., I walked into town to the dance palace called Chantilly in the Century Hotel. The crowd was pleasant, mostly foreigners. Many of the ladies I conversed with were English. It aided me greatly to practice my English. I stayed out until 1 a.m.; the evening cost thirteen-and-a-half francs. This was my first really enjoyable evening in Antwerp, even though I went home alone.\n\nToday, after breakfast, I walked around town. Now I am waiting to have lunch. Yesterday I enjoyed the company of ladies, although everyone seemed to go home alone.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 11:50 p.m., May 21, 1933.\n\nIn the afternoon, I went out to the garden for drinks with David, his wife, and their children, and spent eight francs. After dinner, I took a walk with David and his wife.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 5:00 p.m., May 22, 1933.\n\nToday, after breakfast, I received a letter from my parents. In the letter, my parents asked me to send them my letter from the police in Berlin about my proper conduct, three photos, and a letter from the doctor certifying to my good health. My father also sent the blank signature letter so that I could get 50,000 Parisienne francs sent to Belgium. I went to the local branch of CrÃ©dit Lyonnais to receive assistance in preparing the letter that was to come from my father. Then, I did some chores for David. s I bought the three photos for five francs. I withdrew 300 francs for spending money from the Diamond Club. That day I also registered as a student with Berlitz to study French. The tuition was very expensive. In the beginning of the course,Â there will be private lessons. Later on, the lessons will be group lessons. The private lessons are 480 francs for a week; the group lessons are 245 francs for a month.\n\nAfter my after-lunch nap, I went to a cafÃ© and wrote my parents a letter enclosing the items they requested: the photos, the doctor's health certificate, and police papers attesting to my proper conduct. I spoke with the doctor in English. Incidentally, the doctor said my health was fine. The health certificate, written in French, cost twenty-five francs. For eight francs, the photography store developed the pictures I needed. I mailed everything at the post office, overnight service. At 3 p.m., I had an afternoon snack and nap. I bought myself a new hat for twenty-five francs. I took a nice bath for three francs at the local bathhouse.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 11:30 p.m., May 22, 1933.\n\nI picked up the pictures I had taken at Riveren park on Saturday. I made extra copies for my cousin and placed theÂ originals in my album, #94. I listened to Mr. Kellerman's daily news report on the radio from Berlin.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 1:15 p.m., May 23, 1933.\n\nThis morning I went to the tailor, Edward, and bought gray flannel trousers for 130 francs. I put down a twenty-franc deposit. For ten francs at the pharmacy, I bought sun block and powders. After breakfast, I went to Rivierenhopf. On my way there, for six francs, I bought strawberries and bananas. I rested in bed for an hour and looked at my photo album.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 10:15 p.m., May 23, 1933.\n\nAfter lunch I stayed in bed for an hour. Between four and five p.m. I went for my first French lesson. I put down a deposit of 100 francs and paid 10 francs as a registration fee. My teacher is a Frenchmen who speaks only French. I think I will learn quickly from him. On Platz Du Mer, one of the nicest streets near the largest department store, I had cake and milk served by English-speaking waiters. I withdrew another 300 francs from the Diamond Club. I returned to the Committee for German Immigrants. After 9 p.m., I had dinner and am now going to bed.\n\nAntwerp, WednesdayÂ 4:55 p.m., May 24, 1933.\n\nThis morning I received a postcard from Sonia Klein. I bought myself a bottle of wine for 16 francs. AÂ gogel-mogelÂ (wine, teaspoon of sugar, and a raw egg) was a drink I enjoyed occasionally. For lunch I bought strawberries for five francs and then took a nap. I bought a postcard for Sonia, my sister, and wrote a poem on it for her: \"Be good and brave and don't say anything that is foolish, and you will have a long, good life without any pain.\" On the back, I wrote: \"Sonia, on all your paths of life, I wish you good luck. Best of luck and blessings from your sincere, loving brother Hermann.\" I sent that card to my sister in time for her fifth birthday, Tuesday, May 30th. I have not yet answered Sonia Klein, as I am still at a loss for words.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 10:20 p.m., May 24, 1933.\n\nThis afternoon I quietly sat in the backyard garden behind my cousin's business. Today Mr. Finkelstein from Hansport, Rapadaher, Co., the gentleman whose moving company could transport my family's belongings to Antwerp for 95,500 francs (approximately twelve thousand dollars at that time). I will send along this information to my parents in my next letter.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 6:30 p.m., May 25, 1933.\n\nThis morning the postcard I sent to the Nachman family was returned to me in the mail. I received a loving letter from my parents. Enclosed were photos of my mother and papers concerning our finances from the Paris bank. I went into town and had my watch repaired for three francs. At the Committee for German Immigrants, I learned of a more reliable moving company and made an appointment to meet with a representative. I was informed that I would have to go to the Brussels Consulate to establish permanent residence for my parents and myself. I wrote my parents a six-page letter and took a nap. I wrote Ruth Hamlet in Germany. I drew a flower and a kiss and wrote, \"With a flower and a kiss, you stole my heart, you dear, little, sweet woman.\"\n\nAntwerp, Friday 1:00 p.m., May 26, 1933.\n\nYesterday after dinner I went food shopping for Shabbes [the Sabbath] with my cousin. Yesterday was Himmelsfard [Ascension Day: the celebration of Jesus' ascension into heaven, 40 days after Easter.]\n\nThis morning I met with the moving company representative. He promised to mail me an estimate. Later, at the CrÃ©dit Lyonnais, I was unable to accomplish anything because the Paris bank still had not sent the necessary notification.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 12:15 p.m., May 26, 1933.\n\nThis afternoon I rested and then went to French class. I returned to the CrÃ©dit Lyonnais to have them write a letter saying they wouldÂ transfer 60,000 francs. Afterwards, I went out for hot chocolate and cake. I always needed nourishment after my French lessons because they were exhausting. After every class, I felt as though I had learned nothing, but the next morning I would awake to find that some of the words had stuck with me.\n\nI shopped for some furniture. After lunch, I madeÂ minyan [a quorum of ten Jewish men who pray publicly]Â andÂ davened [prayed].\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 3:15 p.m., May 28, 1933.\n\nDuring the day, I worked in my cousin's shop making window displays. After dinner, I paid ten francs to attend the Yiddish theater and sawÂ Mazel Tov, Mama [Congratulations, Mother]. My seats were very good, and I enjoyed the musical. Afterwards, I went to the Chantilly Ballroom at the Century Hotel. I checked my coat for one franc. I met a nice Jewish lady close to my height. She was 24 years old and multilingual. She invited me to sit with her and her mother. She was a pleasant dancer. At 1 a.m., we left for home. They invited me forÂ Shabbes next Friday, The young lady then gave me a visiting card. Her name is Felicia Rabinowich. She lives in Antwerp, Riedelaybalet #11. Her father is a diamond merchant. I arrived home by 2 a.m.\n\nToday I went to the Committee for German Refugees and Immigrants. I learned that it was difficult for Polish citizens like me to gain entrance to Belgium because I was not a German refugee. The Ministry in Brussels would have the final word. I decided to go there and make a personal appearance. At the Committee, I met a twenty-two-year-old student. I received an estimate from Arthur Pierre today, the moving company. I received a letter from Paris, which I had translated at the CrÃ©dit Lyonnais. It stated that they did not yet have the money from my father, which I had wanted him to wire to Antwerp. I bought my cousin's daughter a ball to play with for four francs.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 1:00 p.m., May 29, 1933.\n\nYesterday, I napped from the afternoon until 7 p.m. Then,Â I walked around before and after dinner. At midnight, I went to bed.\n\nThis morning, I went to the CrÃ©dit Lyonnais, where I was told to return later in the evening. I went to the post office and the Diamond Club to withdraw 200 francs spending money. I paid four francs for items for cousin David. I enjoyed a lemonade, and then I sent a birthday card to my sister. I went to the railroad station to get information about getting to the Ministry in Brussels.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 6:50 a.m., May 30, 1933.\n\nYesterday afternoon, I bought a ball for three francs for David's young son. Then, I spent an hour resting. For three-and-a-half francs, I went to the bathhouse. In the evening, I returned to the home of the man from the CrÃ©dit Lyonnais. He wrote a letter in French to Paris on my behalf. I wrote to my parents because my father's money had not arrived in Paris as I had expected it to. I began to look for rooms to rent.\n\nAfter dinner, I met Sam Fishel, my friend, the barber. He convinced me to go with him to a show at the Yiddish theater, The Street Singer. After the show, Fishel didn't want to go home, so he took me to a brothel. I danced for a while. Then, since neither of us was interested in being with any of the women there, we went home. I was in bed by 1:45 a.m.\n\nI was up early today to go to the Ministry in Brussels. I hope to G-d that the Minister will allow us to stay. Today is my sister's birthday. I hope that she is healthy, fine and has peace, luck, and blessings. I wish the same to my parents. I hope they will enjoy my sister's growing up. Yesterday, I brought my dirty laundry to the cleaners. I spent a total of twenty francs on last night's entertainment. Tonight, I will share David's bed. It was nice of him and his wife to let me stay However, they needed the help and some money.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 8:15 p.m., May 30, 1933.\n\nAfter breakfast today, I went to the train station. The round-trip cost twenty-two francs. I took a taxi to see the minister, who was very nice to me. For five francs, I bought food; and, for six francs, I bought five good cigars. The minister told me I had to see the minister of justice. I waited a long time until they told me to return to Antwerp and that they would let me know the decision later. I caught a one o'clock train and was back in Antwerp by 2 p.m. I went to the Committee and then to my French lesson. Afterwards, I went home to find a letter from CrÃ©dit Lyonnais in Paris, stating that they still had not received the money from my father. There was also a letter from my parents. They informed me that I needed to go to the Antwerp police station about my temporary status. I paid an additional 140 francs for French classes for the rest of the month and five francs for a study book in French. Afterwards, I responded to my parents' letter.\n\nThen, I went to the tailor and paid him 110 francs for the gray flannel pants. Then, I went to dinner.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 8:45 p.m., May 31, 1933.\n\nToday is Shavuos, a Jewish holiday, a harvest festival that occurs in the spring. It also commemorates the giving of the Ten Commandments to Moses and the Israelites at Mount Sinai.\n\nI am displeased that the gray trousers are too tight. At the store earlier today, they had not felt tight, but now they do.\n\nToday, after breakfast, I went to the temple toÂ daven [pray].\n\nAfter lunch, I stayed in bed for 1 1/2 hours. Then, my cousin took me to theÂ polizei [police]Â to get a letter to take to the governor in Antwerp. I would then get a permit from the governor to remain in Belgium an additional three months. But, there was no commitment that I would be able to stay longer.\n\nI finished my homework from Berlitz and then ate dinner. I will wait to notify my parents about the three-month extension until I receive word from Brussels about permanent residency.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 10:45 p.m., June 1, 1933.\n\nToday it is still Shavuos. Today, I went to temple with my cousin toÂ daven. Then, after lunch, I rested. Before noon, I did my French homework. For eight francs, I bought a bottle of red wine and a bottle of white wine for 4 1/2 francs. David's daughter needed somewhere to sleep again, so I have to share David's bed again. This prompted me to look into purchasing a new bed. I spent 25 francs on food and then returned home for dinner. I hope I receive good news in the mail tomorrow.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 1:20 p.m., June 2, 1933.\n\nYesterday after dinner, I walked for a while. At midnight, I went to bed. Early this morning, I brought my new gray trousers back to the tailor; he promised to have new trousers for me by next week. Then, I went to do chores in town before going to the governor. I paid 98 francs for a three-month extended visa that would be ready tomorrow. I went to the Jewish neighborhood to buy meat, fish, cake, fruit, and vegetables for Shabbes. It cost 50 francs. I also bought three nice shirts with stylish collars for 95 francs. I withdrew 700 francs from the Diamond Club. Afterwards, I ate lunch and now I am resting before my three o'clock French class.\n\nAntwerp, Saturday 2:10 p.m., June 3, 1933.\n\nAfter yesterday's French class, I went out for cake and hot chocolate and then strolled through the park. After dinner, I went to the Rabinowich house; on the way, I bought a bouquet of flowers for 10 francs. I was well-received and entertained in their home. I learned that Felicia was 25 years old and was employed by the Minerva Auto Factory. I am no longer interested in her; nevertheless, I promised to write a card and perhaps meet her again at the Chantilly for a dance. I left at 12:30 a.m. I went home by trolley, arriving at 1 a.m. after a short walk.\n\nThis morning, I received a card and a letter from my parents. The letter enclosed a receipt from the Polish bank. My parents inquired whether the financial transfer went through. After picking up my extension visa from the governor's office, I immediately r I went to the CrÃ©dit Lyonnais. Tomorrow and Monday, the CrÃ©dit Lyonnais will be closed for Shavuos. The man who had helped me write the letter was not there, but a receptionist made a note of the address of the Polish bank so he could send them another letter later. There was nothing more I could do at that time.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 9:45 a.m., June 4, 1933.\n\nYesterday afternoon I stayed in bed for an hour. I purchased another French study guide for 35 francs. Then, I wrote my family a letter. Yesterday evening I mentioned to a friend that I was looking for a room. He suggested that I not rent a room until I was employed. The room smells because my cousin sleeps with me since his daughter is sick. David said I could not have visitors over because he did not have a presentable house with furniture. After dinner, I walked with my cousin to deliver shoes to a customer. I went to the bathhouse and treated my cousin for 8 1/2 francs. Soon, I will go have breakfast and look for a room to rent.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 10:35 a.m., June 5, 1933.\n\nYesterday I went into town, but I found no rooms for rent that interested me. I waited for two hours at the Committee, but the line was long and I did not get a meeting. I had lunch and sat in my cousin's garden. Afterwards, I went out with Sam Fishel to the park and we went to eat and to an amusement park. We went to the shooting gallery and also had our photos taken. We rode in bumper cars and took an airplane ride. We had a nice kosher dinner in a nearby restaurant. We visited dance places, looking to meet women. We met three people from Holland driving around. We all went to a nightclub to dance. There, we met two girls, but they ended up leaving with the three Dutch people. We went to another dance club before heading home at 2:30 a.m. The evening and afternoon had cost me 35 francs. I am now writing to my parents before beginning my homework.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 1:00 p.m., June 6, 1933.\n\nYesterday after lunch, I went to a beer garden for a beer. I bought a ticket for a tambola, but I did not win. I went home for dinner and then out for the evening with Sam. The entire day cost me four francs.\n\nToday after breakfast, I went to the Rivierenhof. I bought fruit for six francs and lemonade for two. David wanted to talk with me; he needed to borrow 3,000 francs. I promised that I would write my parents on his behalf. I went back to the park and darned my socks. I did my French homework and will now eat lunch. Living with my family is no bargain because David keeps asking me for money for his failing business. I cannot continue to give him money.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 9:00 p.m., June 6, 1933.\n\nThe governor gave me a three-month extension, which I then brought to the police. I returned to the CrÃ©dit Lyonnais to request that someone write the bank in Poland. Then I went to the English Tearoom for three francs. From 4-5 p.m. I was at my French lesson. Afterwards, I spent six francs for my usual hot chocolate and cake. I began writing my letter home.

Afterwards, Sam Fishman and I listened to the daily radio news.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 2:25 p.m., June 7, 1933.\n\nThis morning I had more problems because my cousin had to go to court. I was stuck in the bank waiting until 11 a.m. to pay seven hundred francs and an additional penalty for a note that my cousin had defaulted on. This left me with only two-and-a-half francs. I went for a walk to relax, and I withdrew two hundred francs from the Diamond Club to pay off my cousin's note. With one franc and fifteen centimes, I drank spring water. At the Committee, I picked a number to wait in line to meet with a counselor. I walked through town while I waited. For five-and-a-half francs I bought a small bottle of brandy. I returned home for lunch. I brought my dirty laundry to the cleaners. When I came home I wrote a postcard to Felicia Rabinowich.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 11:05 a.m., June 8, 1933.\n\nYesterday afternoon I slept an hour-and-a-half before going to the police for verification of my permit to remain in Belgium.

I went out with Mr. Bernard, a friend of Sam Fishman.\n\nToday I received a card from Ruth Hamlet of Biederfeld, Germany. There was a poem in the card. I paid 1.3 francs penalty because of insufficient postage. I will wait to write back until my pictures are developed so that I can send a photo of myself with my next letter. Now I will go to the garden and darn my socks. Antwerp, Thursday 9:30 p.m., June 8, 1933.\n\nThis morning, while darning my socks and studying my French, I forgot to call my mother. At 2:30 p.m., I tried to place a call; it took two hours until I reached my mother. She said she was staying at the pension until Saturday, This morning for three francs I bought bananas. The phone call cost seventy-five francs. My cousin returned two hundred francs from the money I had lent him. Therefter, I went to the Committee, but I arrived too late. I treated myself to the kosher restaurant nearby. The chef told me of a nice room for rent for seven hundred francs each month, including meals. I bought food for Shabbes that afternoon. Now I am eating dinner.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 12:05 p.m., June 9, 1933.\n\nAfter dinner yesterday I walked with David. I paid three francs to treat him to beer.

The evening cost seven-and-a-half francs.\n\nThis morning I received a letter from my parents in Dresden. My mother wrote that she was angered by the Mendelsons' constant request for loans. I have not yet told my cousins about this response. The money I have so far given them is not a lot; I cannot complain. Until yesterday I had been sharing a bed with David. Today I went to Turlitzstrasse, where a Jewish family rented me a room on the first floor. I will be responsible for my breakfast, but they will provide lunch and dinner. I believe this is better than staying with my relatives. They were nice to me, but it wasn't a bargain either. Now I will keep track of my expenditures for meals.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 10:35 a.m., June 12, 1933.\n\nYesterday, I packed my belongings and David accompanied to my new room.

I was fortunate that someone could help me prepare a letter for Brussels. Between 4-5 p.m. I went to my French lesson and then to theÂ patisserie. After dinner I went with Fannie Goldwasser and her two friends to the zoo. Fannie knew the ticket taker and we were admitted at no cost to the zoo. For two francs, I treated everyone to ice cream. I had some milk and went to bed at midnight.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 9:05 a.m., June 15, 1933.\n\nYesterday morning I went swimming for four-and-a-half francs. In the afternoon I rested at the Goldwasser garden. I received a letter from my parents who wanted to move to Palestine. They wanted me to return to Berlin, so that we could all go to Palestine. I returned to the Committee and inquired about travel to Palestine. I explained to my parents that I would not return to Berlin and did not want to move to Palestine. Newspapers in Belgium warned of the danger in Nazi Germany, I would not return, but wanted my parents to come out to Belgium. I sent my parents a return letter by airmail. I telephoned the police in Deurne, the outskirts of Antwerp where my cousin lived and notified them of my address change.

I napped after lunch and returned to the CrÃ©dit Lyonnais. I bought a cake for five francs. After dinner Mr. Goldwasser walked with me, and I came home to dance and listen to music with Maria.\n\nBreakfast today was nice. My parents wrote me a letter requesting that I return home. They said the situation had quieted and requested that I return home so that in four weeks we could come back to Belgium. I once again said I would not go back to Germany. The radio and newspapers were reporting daily of people returning to Germany after foreign visits. The Nazis treated these returning citizens harshly as they were suspicious of travelers speaking badly of Deutschland. I was not going to push my luck. I told my parents that I could be more helpful from Belgium than I would be causing trouble when I returned. I will wait to write this letter until I have financial information from CrÃ©dit Lyonnais.\n\nAntwerp, Saturday 10:10 p.m., June 17, 1933.\n\nYesterday after lunch I sat on a hammock in the garden and did a bit of gardening.

Today Goldwasser's 13-year-old son showed me his bar mitzvah presents. I gave him a small photo camera as a bar mitzvah present. After dinner, a young man was visiting the family, and we all listened to the Victrola. He and I both danced with Maria.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 12:05 a.m., June 18, 1933.\n\nThis morning I received notice from the post office that my parents requested a phone call. Over the phone my mother asked me to return to Berlin; I explained my position about Nazi arrests of visitors returning to Germany. Many of those in \"protective custody\" never returned alive. I asked them to think it over before commanding that I come home. If they commanded it, I would go. I took a walk and then darned my socks. I wrote my parents a long letter further explaining my position. After dinner I walked along Kaiserlein from the train station through Antwerp. It is the nicest avenue in Antwerp. Now I am going to bed. (I refused to go to Germany, not just for selfish reasons. I am afraid of the aggravation my parents would have if I got in trouble there. I feel I am much more helpful in Belgium, communicating with the Committee and the Brussels Ministry. Friends and acquaintances all advise me not to return to Germany.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 3:35 p.m., June 20, 1933.\n\nAfter breakfast yesterday, Mr. Goldwasser introduced me to his niece from New York who was visiting for three days. We went together to a diamond palace owned by the Goldwasser family. We watched as workers shaped the diamonds. I registered his niece with the Town Government, saying I was showing her around Antwerp. When I arrived home, there was another letter from my parents requesting that I return to Germany. That afternoon David visited me in Antwerp. He helped me write a letter to my parents that I sent by airmail. Then for eight-and-a-half francs I purchased stationery.

I went back to CrÃ©dit Lyonnais to get instructions on how to proceed. I went to Berlitz School to use a typewriter to send a letter to Poland. I rented a taxi for 30 francs, telegrammed the letter for 54 francs and airmailed it to Poland. Then, I called my mother for 70 francs to let her know I was attending to the financial matter. I withdrew an additionalÂ 500 from the Diamond Club, part of which was to repay Mrs. Goldwasser; the remainder was for pocket money. I returned home for lunch. I was very anxious when Mrs. Goldwasser told me that my mother called to say that it was not necessary for me to return to Berlin, There is a G-d in heaven! I had already stopped at a travel agency because I thought the decision had been made. I have never been as happy as when I found out that my mother would not require me to come to Berlin,\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 10:50 p.m., June 20, 1933.\n\nI went class and theÂ patisserie. I am still elated that I will not have to return to Germany.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 11:05 p.m., June 21, 1933.\n\nToday after breakfast I received an airmail letter from my parents saying I did not have to return to Germany. They asked if I needed money and wrote that they would send some, if necessary. A letter from the Antwerp police requested that I get two photos to them in person on Friday. I put an ad in the morning newspaper looking for a job. I returned to CrÃ©dit Lyonnais; they had no information. After lunch, I napped for over two hours.

Still, there was no answer. I registered at Berlitz to continue my course in group sessions for the following month. After lunch I rested for two hours and darned my socks. After coffee, I had my pictures developed for eight francs. I went to Deurne to visit the Mendelsons. For 21-and-a-half francs I picked up my laundry at the cleaners. I stopped at the tailor's, but my pants were not ready. I came home and joined Mr. Goldwasser for a walk in the park.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 2:25 p.m., June 23, 1933.\n\nLast night before going to sleep I darned three pair of socks. This morning after breakfast I went to the police station to register my status, as they had requested. I returned to CrÃ©dit Lyonnais to discover that the money was located in Poland. Poland deducted 25 marks for expenses. I wanted to exchange the remaining 163,150 marks, but I only exchanged a some ofÂ that money as the exchange rate was dropping. I gave 100 francs to the manager who had helped me with my correspondence and deposited the rest with the Diamond Club.

After breakfast, my mother phoned me to say that Brussels had denied their applications. I asked my mother to send the paperwork to me. My father sent me a letter that day saying he is satisfied that I did not return to Berlin because it is very bad there. They are glad that I remained in Antwerp instead of suffering with them in Germany. I visited several lawyers, including one named Jacobson who had been recommended to me in Brussels. I called him in Brussels for seven francs. He told me that he was unable to work for me privately as he was affiliated with the Committee. After lunch, I rested in the garden and went out to see two other attorneys, one of whom referred me to a good Brussels attorney. Maria and I went to the Capital Theatre to see, Song of Love. The second film, with Harry Bauer, Criminal, was excellent. It was about a businessman and world traveler. The tickets had cost 20 francs for both of us. During intermission, I spent one-and-a-half francs for chocolate and two for beer. Maria gave me 10 francs for her theatre ticket, as she did not want to be treated. I was in bed by midnight.\n\nThis morning I received the letter that the Belgian Consulate had sent to my parents. My mother said that if I would have to leave Belgium, I should still not return to Germany. I am anxious to get my parents out of Germany.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 10:00 p.m., June 26, 1933.\n\nYesterday afternoon I walked through the park. I was still unable to do anything because it was Sunday.

Yesterday I picked up Fanny Goldwasser at the train station returning from Paris. I did not get to bed until 2 a.m. The trip to Brussels cost 22 francs. I took the trolley in Brussels to visit the attorney Jasper, the nephew of the foreign minister. He was recommended to me by an acquaintance in the restaurant who said he was very capable and had good connections. I left my reference letter at his office in the morning and went to the Brussels Committee on Jewish-German Immigrants. I went to see the attorney Mr. Wolf, but I could not locate him. The committee recommended me to attorney Edward Abraham, and I made a 1 p.m. appointment with him. I went to the Jewish section and had a miserable lunch before seeing Abraham. He said he was unable to do anything because of my Polish passport. He requested 25 francs for this advice, but I did not pay him. I told him I did not think I needed to pay him if he wouldn't take the case. I spent two francs for spring water. I sent my parents a small letter to update them before returning to the lawyer Jasper. I waited a long time until he was able to see me. Jasper listened to my case and said he thought he would be able to help. He requested a certificate from the bank to prove our deposits of over 100,000 francs in Antwerp, which I will attend to tomorrow. I spent six francs on cake before returning to Antwerp. In Antwerp, I went to the Diamond Club to receive documentation of our savings there. I wrote my parents with details of today's minor successes.\n\nToday I bought a Berlin newspaper.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 1:20 p.m., June 27, 1933.\n\nToday, after breakfast, Mr Goldwasser accompanied me to the Diamond Club. I withdrew 200 or 300 francs and another 300,000 francs. Together we went to the SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale de Belgique bank. I introduced myself as I had an account there. The bank had also recommended an attorney to me. I deposited the money into a bank account there. They gave me a certificate of the equity. The French francs had fallen markedly in value, proving that it was wise not to wait too long to exchange the money. I went to the railroad for a schedule of trains to Brussels. I deposited my certificate of equity at the Diamond Club. I paid Mrs. Goldwasser back from yesterday's loan of 200 francs. I also brought Mrs. Goldwasser a bouquet of roses in gratitude for her husband's assistance at the bank. I paid Kuplach 100 francs today for the week's meals.

My mother said she had written. She was thankful that they received 16,000 marks for selling the building on #26 Kapengastrasse. I told my mother I would write her a letter suggesting how to get the money out of Germany. The building was worth nearly 200 marks, but I was thankful that they had been able to get any money out of it.

Enclosed was a letter from Mr. Munavitch from Deurne-au-Rhine, saying I could visit him from the Mendelson house. I wrote him back with my current address. I also went to several banks and to see my friend at the currency exchange office. A new law was being implemented, which prohibited Belgian banks from exchanging German money since so many German marks were flooding the market from recent refugees. After lunch, I enjoyed the garden. After 3 p.m. I tried to reach Mr. Jasper in Brussels, but I was unable to do so. Before going out for the evening, I made Kiddush at the Goldwasser home. I bought myself a fine bottle of wine for 17 francs. Yesterday I had a wonderful meal, including gefilte fish, chicken soup, and a quarter of a goose. then I danced and conversed with the Goldwassers.\n\nToday after breakfast I went to the photo developers and bought three disks for the camera, which cost six francs.

She said she would send a money order for 17,500 marks and that she was very happy to talk with me. She is a wonderful mother, and I hope to be a good son and only give them pleasure, even though sometimes I cause her pain. It was raining heavily, so I stayed home. I awaited a letter from my mother. I picked up the developed photos from Saturday evening and placed them in my album as nos.97 and 98. At Kuplech's, I am now paying daily..

Shortly thereafter, I received a registered letter from the Polish bank enclosing a check for 29,300 in Polish money, the equivalent of 146,000 Belgian francs. I gave that check to my bank in Antwerp. Next, I attended a party for Adolf Goldwasser, Mr. Goldwasser's 13-year-old son. For one franc, I bought a bouquet of roses for the Goldwassers.

Antwerp, Thursday 11:05. July 13, 1933.\n\nThis morning my parents called about the money transfer. My father was having difficulty getting a visa for a short-term visit to Belgium. He said if he didn't get the visa, he would try to cross the border at Aix-de-Chapelle. I went to the Diamond Club to get the documents I needed to take to Brussels. I went to see Goldwasser's nephew William. William took me to the Belgian Congress, but we were unable to accomplish anything because our passports were Polish. We could not claim we were German refugees since we had Polish passports. I tried again to get in touch with Jasper unsuccessfully. For three francs, I went to see the marathon dancers, some of whom had been dancing for 36 hours. For six francs, I went to a patisserie.\n\nFortunately, we had not yet been rejected.

Maria Goldwasser accompanied me to Deurne to return the faulty trousers that had been delivered to me before noon. The tailor promised me new pants, but he did not make them as he'd already been paid. I was aggravated. While in the neighborhood, I went to visit David Mendelson and the Reverenhopf Park. We rested on the lawn. Yesterday, Mrs. Goldwasser invited me to dinner with the family. I made Kiddush for Shabbes and enjoyed dinner with them. We said grace afterwards for the meal. I went to bed at 11 p.m. after walking in the park.\n\nThis morning I waited for the airmail letter anxiously. I walked with Mr. Goldwasser through the town park. I rested in bed in the afternoon for an hour. My lunches and dinners this week cost 100.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 10:10 a.m., July 17, 1933.\n\nI met some friends in the afternoon and played ball at the Nightingale. After dinner, for 15 francs, I walked and had healthy spring water to drink. Yesterday morning, I was called to the telephone. My mother called to say that my father had left on Saturday and was due to arrive in Brussels by 8:30 a.m. She told me to meet him and Sonia at the station. I woke Maria to come with me to the railroad station to get information. There was no train going to Brussels that would get me there in time. Instead, I hired a driver for 200 francs. I arrived 15 minutes after the train's arrival and found my father on the train just as I was about to give up. My father was on a train heading for Antwerp. We got a refund for his train ticket and took the car. Later, I learned that the train going to Antwerp on which my father had been on had had an accident and arrived in Antwerp one hour later.\n\nI called my mother for 75 francs to tell her that my father had arrived. We paid 22 francs for lunch. I called Mr. Munavich, who was visiting my cousin David in Deurne. We put Sonia to sleep, and I took my father to Deurne. The Mendelsons were not there. We walked around town before returning to Antwerp and having a good dinner for 28 francs. I showed my father the house in whic I lived and got him a room at a hotel. Then, we found a children's bed for Sonia to sleep in at my home. I escorted my father to his room and gave him 400 francs. Yesterday, I spent some time with my father explaining our bank statements. He was satisfied with the accounts I had established. Sonia slept well and felt better. My father arrived from his hotel room. We sat together in Goldwasser's garden.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 1:35 p.m., July 17, 1933.\n\nI took my father to register at the Committee for German Refugees. Then, I put my father and Sonia on a trolley to visit the Mendelsons in Deurne.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 4:35 p.m., July 18, 1933.\n\nYesterday, I relinquished our bank accounts to my father and reported my budget to him. Now I do not have to keep track of the financial balances in the journal unless I want to.\n\nYesterday after dinner I went to attorney Mrs. Cohen from Hamburg. I met her and her husband at the Berlitz school. I enjoyed spending the evening with them. When I returned, my father and sister were asleep in the hotel. Mr. Crimilofsky, from Berlin, was also staying over. He said that my mother wanted us to call her. I went with him to the post office to call my mother. I told her all about the past few days. I went home by midnight.\n\nToday I took my father to the Diamond Club and introduced him to my friends and acquaintances. We paid 56 francs to rent the safe for one year. I introduced my father around the bank and deposited money there. There are still important papers in the safe. My mother called to say that the furniture had been sent and would be shipped to Belgium today. I went to the Committee about my mother again.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 8:10 a.m., July 19, 1933.\n\nI went with my father to the Committee and then to my French lesson from 7-8 p.m. Afterwards, my father, Sonia, and I walked with some of my acquaintances.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 3:10 p.m., July 20, 1933.\n\nAfter breakfast yesterday, we picked my mother up at the station. I spent the afternoon with my mother at the Town Council. Later, we looked for rooms together, and my parents rented two rooms. My father made me angry when he said that I spent too much money while he wasn't here. i was very careful and was upset that he said that. After dinner, I visited the Cohens.\n\nThis morning, I went to the railroad station to pick up my mother's valises. But first I had to return to the house to get the keys to open the locks on the valises in case we needed to pay customs. It turned out that there was no duty to pay, not even for my mother's new fox collar. Then, my father and I went to the photographer, and then to the Town Council to register my parents. I lunched with my father. Today, my sister had a temperature and a stomach virus; so, she stayed in bed, and we stayed home with her.\n\nI wrote letters to our attorneys in Berlin.\n\nAntwerp, Friday, July 21, 1933.\n\nToday is my birthday. My father and I awoke at 4 a.m. and went with Maria and Regina Goldwasser to Blankenberg to the North Sea. It was a three-and-a-half hour train trip. The girls were on vacation. My birthday went as follows: in the morning we went to the beach, and my father swam with me. After lunch, I napped one hour, and we returned to the beach cafÃ©.\n\nWe had banana royal and I danced. We sent my mother, the Goldwassers, and Dr. Cohen postcards. We promenaded in the evening and were in bed by 10:30 p.m.\n\nOn Saturday, July 22, I felt nauseous in the morning. Maria took me to my room and gave me cold compresses. I returned to the beach after lunch. I wanted to go back to bed, but my father said it was nice on the beach, so I went to the beach. I started to feel bad again, so Regina took me back to the room and gave me cold water compresses. I took some aspirin. I was running a high fever, around 40 (normal was 36). When Maria and my father returned, my fever was still high. The girls and I wanted to get a doctor, but my father said I didn't need a doctor and that I was ruining everyone's fun. When my father left, I asked one of the girls to get a doctor for me. After the aspirin, my fever went down to 39.5. The doctor gave me a prescription. Maria looked after me, and when I perspired profusely from the prescription, she kept toweling my face. I lay quietly as the sickness made me weak.\n\nOn Sunday, the doctor returned. My father had return-tickets for the railroad that day, so he wanted the doctor to get me ready for travel. I took many extra tablets to ready myself for the journey. I went to a beach cafÃ© with the girls, and we listened to music before catching the evening train back to Antwerp.\n\nGoldwasser and my mother said I looked very sick. Mrs. Goldwasser insisted that I remain in bed for a few days, and she looked after me.\n\nOn Thursday, I went to my French lessons. That same evening, the Cohens came to visit. Dr. Cohen advised my parents against leaving Antwerp at present. In the meantime, the furniture arrived from Berlin. The Cohens suggested that we rent an apartment and establish an address, rather than putting the furniture in storage. I received a letter from the Town Council. Because I still felt so weak from my illness, I went with my mother to the Commissar. The Commissar said that my request for permit residency was rejected in Brussels. My three-month permit would expire in August. The Commissar suggested that I get another three-month visa. The Burgermeister (Mayor) promised to help us if I wrote him a letter and explained our situation.\n\nOn Friday, my parents rented a four-room apartment at Avenue Wundunais #10, where we are now living. Customs officers detailed the items we had brought into the country.\n\nOn Saturday, we were settled in. My parents continued to believe that they had been better off in Germany where they had a business and spoke the language. Here they had neither. During this time, I took a rowboat out with Sonia, Maria, and Dalia.\n\nI hope my parents will stop complaining and get used to living here. They continue to blame me for bringing them to Brussels.\n\nI am now taking private French language lessons from an older man.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 11:05 p.m., August 14, 1933.\n\nI went to the doctor today about a persistent cough. He gave me a prescription.\n\nSomeone recommended a woman who was supposed to be good at teaching French. The following week I began lessons with her. Today and Thursday I have another lesson with the gentleman who's also been giving me French lessons.\n\nMy mother gave me 8,400 francs for the thousand marks I had saved in Germany. That money was deposited in my checking account at a low interest rate. My parents are keeping their money at the National Bank with some other money earning a higher rate ofÂ interest. I had a lot of writing work with the attorney and these bank accounts.\n\nSaturday afternoon, I went to Nightingale Park. My parents have company over.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 7:45 p.m., August 16, 1933.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Munivich joined my family on a visit to David Mendelson. I went to bed around 11:00 p.m. I stayed in bed until noon the next day because of my cough. After lunch, my parents went to Brussels. I took care of Sonia, straightened up the house, prepared dinner, and bought some household items.\n\nThe rash I had had on my belly has returned. My mother is treating it with alcohol, which seems to be working.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 8:45 p.m., August 17, 1933.\n\nMy parents came home from Brussels yesterday at dinnertime. Mr. Lampel, who had taken over my room with the Goldwassers, came to visit us. He was nice. My parents like Brussels more than Antwerp; I am happy that they are pleased.. I stayed in bed until 11 a.m. today. I took my mother to see Max Fisher at the exchange office about my mother's 3,000 marks in Germany. He said he was unable to transfer marks anymore. I did not have my French lesson today, but I did study.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 8:30 p.m., August 21, 1933.\n\nSaturday and Sunday I stayed in bed because I did not feel well. I did take Ms. Linkofsky and her mother out dancing. It cost five francs.\n\nToday I had a French lesson with the woman for ten francs; I thought she was a good teacher. My father went to Brussels today. He said that since we were not earning any money, I could not spend money on French lessons. I argued that I do not treat myself to anything else, and I was willing to pay for the lessons myself so that I could learn the language and converse with the people in Belgium. My father is anxious to start a business, but he complained that he needed to be able to speak French in order to do so.\n\nThis morning I visited cousin Mendelson and helped him with some writing work. I will do some more French homework and go to bed. My parents continue to complain that I was responsible for their leaving Berlin because I refused to return there.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 10:35 p.m., August 23, 1933.\n\nYesterday I did some writing work. Mr. and Mrs. Goldwasser visited us.\n\nI went to bed early last night. Today my mother and I went to the Czechoslovakian Consulate. We learned that life there was worse than here. My parents again fought with me because I had dragged them to Belgium from Berlin.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 9:10 p.m., August 24, 1933.\n\nMy parents gave me 200 francs today to buy a pair of shoes. My mother gave me an additional 100 francs for pocket money. I will use that money to pay for my French lessons. I had a lesson this afternoon.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 5:55 p.m., August 27, 1933.\n\nFriday I walked in the park with Sonia. During the evening, I wrote a letter for my cousin Mendelson's business. I listened to news from around the world, which appeared ominous.\n\nSaturday I mailed the letter for David Mendelson. In the afternoon I went with a friend on a rowboat. I napped in the afternoon and was still upset that my parents were bitter about my dragging them out of Germany. I do not want to have a confrontation with them, but it aggravates me to hear their complaints. I still feel I did the right thing, but I am the only one who feels that way. I can defend my position since everyone I speak to says that my parents should be thankful that they are in Belgium and not Germany. My parents still do not see it that way. They complain constantly. I am getting headaches and an upset stomach from this constant tension.\n\nYesterday afternoon we went to Nightingale Park. I went to bed at 8:30 p.m. David Mendelson visited with a letter from some relatives in Palestine who suggested that we move there. I went to get information on moving to Palestine.\n\nToday my father again complained about the expensive French lessons. I seems that he doesn't want to see me spend any money. These lessons may be more expensive, but the teacher is very good and I am learning faster from her.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 10:55 a.m., August 31, 1933.\n\nMonday evening my father hollered at me once again about the French lessons and our living in Belgium. I went to bed at 8 p.m.\n\nTuesday I had bad headaches and slept until 5 p.m. After a short walk, I went back to bed.\n\nYesterday morning I was not feeling well at all. We received a letter from a bank in Czechoslovakia, which required a response. My father had decided to travel through Germany to pick up his remaining 3,000 marks. My mother left the money there because she was afraid to carry more than 1,000 marks on her person. We all advised my father against returning to Germany, but he would not listen. My father criticized me again for my decision to come to Belgium. I listened quietly without fighting, but in my mind I still feel I did the right thing. I am still glad to have my parents here in Belgium and not in Germany. I love my parents and would not want to lose them in Germany, particularly the way people get lost in Germany these days. I hope my father will return safely from this trip. I ran errands with my father through all the different consulates. At 7 p.m. my father left for Germany. I went to bed at 10:30 p.m.\n\nI davened this morning and prayed for my father's safe journey. Now I am sitting with my sister; while she plays in the park, I will study my French lessons.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 11:30 a.m., September 3, 1933.\n\nThursday I walked around with my mother and sister. Glenda visited us with her husband today on her birthday. I went to bed around 11 p.m.\n\nFriday evening I went with my mother to Mr. Krimilofsky's house. He was from Montevideo and had just arrived from Berlin where he had met my father. He told us that my father was doing well there. He still had not taken care of the financial matter.\n\nNow my father was no longer happy with Berlin because as a Jew he was now restricted from commerce. Jews are now afraid to walk through the streets. I went to sleep at 11 p.m.\n\nYesterday Sonia and I walked to allow my mother to fix up the house. Last night Glenda again paid us a visit. Then we visited Mr. Krimilofsky. While we were there, his son had returned from Berlin. The reports were bad. Now I am sitting in the park watching my sister.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 1:30 p.m., September 4, 1933.\n\nYesterday my mother; sister, and I joined Mr. and Mrs. Grender. In the evening, cousin Mendelson visited. Today Sonia and I walked through the park and spent some time at Goldwasser's waiting for my father to call there. He has not yet called. We are worried.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 4:05 p.m., September 5, 1933.\n\nI had my French lesson yesterday and did my homework. We received an airmail postcard from my father in Carlsbad. I was thankful he was OK. Our nerves were calmed when we went to bed.\n\nWe wrote two postcards to my father and received a letter from him that he wanted to phone at Goldwasser's but was unable to. This morning we walked in the park.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 2:20 p.m., September 8, 1933.\n\nLast night cousin David visited. My mother and I received a letter from my father in Carlsbad and hoped that he would take some vacation there and relax, as he usually did. But today my father came home to Antwerp. He brought many presents. He gave me two silk ties, an umbrella, a chocolate bar, and a shirt. I thanked him and was relieved to have him home. My father told my mother she looked beautiful and well rested. He said Berlin was very bad, and he no longer wished to go back. Now he was considering opening a business in Prague. He again blamed me for his being in Belgium. He decided he wanted to rest in Belgium for the winter before moving to Czechoslovakia. He felt uncomfortable with French. My father rested while I went shopping with my mother for Shabbes.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 1:30 p.m., September 10, 1933.\n\nI went to bed early on Friday and slept late. On Saturday evening I went to the Capital Theatre and saw a wonderful film, Ecstasy, with Lana Turner. Yesterday I bought shoes for 100 francs. Friday my father gave me five francs to go see a movie. I spent a lot of money this week at the barber shop and for various toiletries. I no longer write of those expenses. This morning I went to the post office for my parents and did some writing work.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 9:40 p.m., September 11, 1933.\n\nToday I researched exchange rates for the Czech kroenig with Max Fisher. We were able to exchange the currency. I went to my French lesson in the afternoon and then met up with my family in the park. (The first days after my father's return from Czechoslovakia, he seemed content. Since then, he has been bored and lonesome and is now complaining again about being out of Berlin. Still he remembers that he was afraid to walk in the streets of Berlin when he was back. He claims he does not want to return there.) Now my father wants me to get a job. He suggested that I peddle socks and other woven textiles. I proposed getting a stand at a farmer's market and selling these items there because that way I could stay in town and build up a business. This would still give me some free time.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 3:15 p.m., September 13, 1933.\n\nYesterday I went to the banks to get money transferred. We rested all afternoon. Then I went to the police station to respond to a notice my father received. Afterwards, I saw the movie, Beauty Parlor, with Anita Praga and Marie Dressler. It was a light, funny film. The second film was, The Beautiful Danube, with Joseph Schildkraut, Brigitte Helm, and others. It was a beautiful film with nice music about a love affair.\n\nToday before noon I attended to correspondence. Afterwards my father went to Paris. Maybe he would like to start a business there. When my father reads about Palestine, it seems to upset him. My mother took Sonia to see the movies I saw yesterday.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 2:30 p.m., September 15, 1933.\n\nWednesday, after I finished my French homework, I had dinner and walked through the streets before retiring to bed.\n\nYesterday I ran many errands and then went to the Goldwassers in the afternoon. Maria prepared a French letter for me to respond to the attorney Jasper. He had sent us back our correspondence. Thus far he hasn't been very helpful for our 500 francs.\n\nThis afternoon I helped clean the house and went looking for a job. I found no openings. I went to the bank for my father. I have some correspondence work and French homework to attend to.\n\nAntwerp, Saturday 9:10 p.m., September 16, 1933.\n\nI walked for a while yesterday and went to bed early.\n\nThis morning I took Sonia to the park. Then, I escorted my mother and sister to the train to visit the Mendelsons in Deurne. I went with my father and a friend to the Granada CafÃ©.\n\nAfter dinner I did my French homework. (Yesterday I arranged with a new teacher to have an hourly lesson costing five francs. I have one lesson left with my prior instructor tomorrow.) My father yelled at me again for the expensive tutor. I gave my French teacher one lesson's notice that I was changing instructors, as she had requested. I wanted to go to the movies today, but my father complained that I was spending too much money. My father spends a great deal of money on cigarettes and goes to coffee houses very frequently, but I do not complain about those expenditures.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 9:55 p.m., September 17, 1933.\n\nI went to the dentist this morning and cared for my sister in the afternoon while my parents were out. I visited with the Goldwassers and came home to hear the news report. The radio announcer was discussing the plummeting American dollar. It would soon be at 55% of its actual worth. I am fortunate to have sold my American dollars for Belgian currency. Now I am worried about the financial loss that the palm reader in Berlin had mentioned. I really do not know the gravity of her prediction.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 8:30 p.m., September 19, 1933.\n\nToday is Rosh Hashanah. I did a lot of correspondence work, and Maria Goldwasser proofed the letter that I was sending to the attorney Jasper. After my French lesson and dinner, I went to the movies with two friends. Since I had a discount card, the movie did not cost me anything. The first German movie, which I'd already seen in Berlin, starred Richard Tauber. The second was in French and featured Armand Bernard. I was happy to realize I fully understood it.\n\nToday I wrote some letters before taking my sister to the dentist and the park. I paid the dentist 360 francs for three gold caps that I had ordered. That afternoon I celebrated Rosh Hashanah in the New Temple. It cost me 100 francs; it was discounted because I was a foreigner and unemployed. I shared the ticket with my father.\n\nTomorrow I will mail Rosh Hashanah cards to my parents.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 5:50 p.m., September 20, 1933.\n\nThis morning I did some house-shopping for my mother. I also took Sonia back to the dentist for a filling, which cost thirty francs. I mailed Rosh Hashanah cards that afternoon to friends and relatives. Mr. Sweitzer, a dry-cleaning acquaintance of ours from Berlin, needed me to help him with moving of his belongings from Berlin, and I was involved in negotiations for that for three hours. I am going to the Goldwassers to wish them a healthy New Year.\n\nAntwerp, Saturday 9:10 p.m., September 23, 1933.\n\nWednesday night I went to temple and then to sleep. Thursday I prayed and heard the shofar blown. In the afternoon we were accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Grendar.\n\nYesterday, the second day of Rosh Hashanah, I went to temple with Sonia. After lunch, my family went to visit the Mendelsons while I went to the movie theatre to see two French films: Henri Garat starred in He is Charming and Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert in The Laughing Lieutenant. In the evening my parents came home and went to see the same two movies.\n\nToday before noon I visited the Cohens with my sister. Attorney Cohen helped me interpret some letters from the Czech bank. The bank had notified us that the money was available to be transferred at my father's discretion. The money was in a locked account, as my father had been residing in Germany. Mr. Jasper wrote that he was going back to see the foreign minister on my family's behalf. In the afternoon an acquaintance visited my family. My father again displayed his displeasure at life in Antwerp.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 9:05 p.m., September 25, 1933.\n\nYesterday morning my mother and I shopped. For five francs, I went to the public bath house. Now I am using my 100 remaining francs to buy shoes. The balance will be pocket money. I took my sister back to the dentist. This morning my mother and I cared for financial matters at the Polish Consulate. Afterwards I returned my sister to the dentist. I paid 30 francs for her fillings. At the Diamond Club, I deposited a diamond ring and the Czech bank book. I inquired into travel plans for my mother. I had my French lesson, but I do not think this teacher is as good as my previous one. I plan to return to the previous teacher because I was learning more from that one. My father once again was yelling about my frivolous behavior and complaining that I took him out of Germany. My mother packed her bags for a short trip to Berlin to get the 3,000 marks in the bank. She was fearful for her savings as my father had been unsuccessful in freeing the funds. I pray for my mother's safe return. Now I will study French.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 6:45 p.m., September 27, 1933.\n\nYesterday morning I went to the Polish Consulate; then I wrote a letter to the Czech bank. I returned again to the Consulate. My father bought a lottery ticket, but he did not win. In the afternoon, my father went to the movies, while I watched my sister and did my homework. A letter arrived from our attorney in Berlin. He had received a permit to send the 3,000 marks from Germany, thereby making my mother's excursion futile. I had warned my mother against making the trip, but my father was adamant that she go. After dinner I went to the Capital Theatre to see two French films, The Man that Saved Tom, an average Western, and Back Street, a beautiful love story starring Irene Dunne. After the movie, I read aloud from the Jewish newspaper for my father. (At this time he was still illiterate; he did not learn to read until we were planning to move to America, a move that required literacy.) I went to bed at midnight.\n\nToday I did my French homework; we received a letter from my mother.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 11:45 p.m., September 28, 1933.\n\nThis morning I walked with my sister. Then, we had lunch and napped in the afternoon. I read the Jewish paper to my father. I bought food for dinner. Maria Goldwasser came by to say that Mother had telephoned to let us know she would be leaving Berlin tonight and be arriving in Antwerp tomorrow at noon. After dinner, my father went to buy the Shabbes meal. I put Sonia to bed, listened to the radio with Maria, and danced with her until my father came home.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 4:45 p.m., September 29, 1933.\n\nWe picked my mother up at the train station shortly before we expected her because she had caught an express train. Finally, my mother was able to transport her money from Germany. The Belgian banks were unable to cash the check until they received notification from the German bank.\n\nMy mother was so glad to get her money out of Germany that she gave me 100 francs in pocket money. When their check is cashed, my parents will give me the remainder of my savings from Berlin. Afterwards, I went to the dentist. He gave me two gold crowns for 150 francs. I went to the French teacher and cancelled my remaining lessons. Then, I did some shopping for my mother. Now I am going to get properly dressed for Yom Kippur tonight. My little sister is feeling unwell with a cold.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 3:00 p.m., October 1, 1933.\n\nWhen I came home from the temple after the Kol Nidre service, Mr. and Mrs. Grindach were visiting. I wished everyone a happy and a healthy New Year. During our conversation, my father again began complaining about being dragged by me to Belgium. My father claimed that I had been running around with Goldwasser's three daughters. He complained that I had been sitting around for three months in Belgium doing nothing. I listened to my father's raving and was aggravated, but did not respond because it was a holiday. I told my father he could deduct the amount that he thought I had overspent in Belgium from my savings from Germany. My mother had not taken his side, so my father cursed at her, too, for passively taking my side. He brought up the fact that she bought expensive shoes when she went back to Germany.\n\nYesterday, I spent most of the day at the temple. I fasted from Friday at 6 p.m. until 7:06 p.m. Saturday, My mother also fasted. I wanted to show my father that I was respectfully dating, not \"shlepping around\" with several women. That night I went to the Chantilly night club. I enjoyed the time away from my father. Afterwards, I went out for a glass of beer. The evening cost 14 francs.\n\nToday I paid the dentist the 50 francs that I still owed him and took Sonia to the park since she was feeling better. I visited the Goldwassers both days to wish them a Happy Holiday. Yom Kippur is the Day of Atonement. My father unfortunately is following another direction; he continues to blame me for taking him to Belgium. Last night, I went to sleep at 10 p.m.; the night before at 1 a.m.\n\nMy mother is suffering a lot. She risked her life to return to Berlin and save my father's money. But all my father could do was yell at her for buying expensive shoes. He yelled so much that she threatened to kill herself just to get away from his abuse.\n\nToday my mother received a letter from her sister in Poland, David Mendelson's mother. Her sister's other son, Israel Mendelson, who had been serving in the Polish army, was hit by three hand grenades and killed. I believe this is the death that the palm reader had told me about in Mocha Hafte on April 9, 1933. May he rest in peace. I was sorry to bring bad news; I hope there will be good news in the future. The Polish Army required that I sign up in their Consulate to agree to serve in their army wherever I am in order to maintain my citizenship.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday, October 3, 1933.\n\nSunday afternoon I walked around a bit and did my French homework.\n\nOn Monday before noon I was in the Polish Consulate regarding the money in the Czech bank. Then, I brought the gold from the bank home for my mother to give my father. I returned to the Consulate with 1,380 marks to convert to francs and deposit in my bank account. Now I have 19,900 francs of my own money. In the afternoon, my father took me to Brussels where we explored leads for new businesses. After dinner we came home. At midnight I finished my business correspondence.\n\nToday I went to the dentist in the morning and took my sister for a walk.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 2:05 p.m., October 4, 1933.\n\nYesterday afternoon I did some more work before going out with Leo Silverman, a 17-year-old German refugee. Leo speaks a bit of French and English; his father is a cantor. We registered for public (free) French language courses. Afterwards, David Mendelson visited with a letter he received from his cousin in Palestine. I went to sleep by 11:30 p.m.\n\nMy father is very interested in moving to Palestine. My mother and I are reluctant to do so. In today's world economic situation, it seems there are few other options. The anti-Semitism is so widespread, not just in Germany but throughout the world. (It is almost incomprehensible to understand the pre-war anti-Semitism today.) My parents now want to visit the Mendelsons in Deurne. I am returning to my French studies. Today I bought my sister cod liver oil for five francs. Lately, I have been spending some extra money for newspapers, barbershop visits, and other activities. After my French homework, I am going to the movie theatre.\n\nAntwerp, Friday 12:00 p.m., October 6, 1933.\n\nWednesday afternoon I saw the movie, Don't Be Jealous. It was half of a double feature; the other was The King of Jazz. That one was one of the first pictures in color. The scenes and clothes were lavish, but the film was a little straining on the eyes. In the evening I studied French before retiring at 11:30 p.m.\n\nYesterday afternoon I went to the dentist and took a walk with my sister. The dentist invited me for coffee after my appointment.\n\nI went to bed at 10:45 p.m.; I had a hard time falling asleep because of my toothache.\n\nThis morning I returned to the dentist. Tonight I will go to services at the temple. Wednesday will be Sukkos. I paid my dentist 100 francs by check today.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 12:00 p.m., October 8, 1933.\n\nFriday I went with my parents to visit some family friends. In the evening, I did French homework and went to bed. Yesterday before noon I walked around with my sister. I escorted my father to the railroad station to go to Paris. In the afternoon I did more homework. In the evening I played checkers with my mother; I won ten francs from her, but only took five. Then I got dressed and went to the ball in Century after 10 p.m., I was not very anxious to go.\n\nI offered to go to the theatre with my mother, but she did not want to go out. The admission at the ball was very high, but I waited a little while and got in free. The Goldwasser daughters were there; so were other people I knew. The music was nice, as were some of the other acts. I danced with many people. I met a nice, young Jewish girl. She was 19 and spoke German, English, French, and Flemish fluently. She was at the ball with her mother and brother. She is a member of a sports club that I am considering joining. My father has urged me to get active in sports, not just \"runn around.\" He also thinks improved fitness will be helpful if we go to Palestine. Today we set our clocks back. The whole evening cost eight-and-a-half francs. I walked home with the girl and her mother.\n\nThis morning I was with my friend Leo in the public school. Soon I would like to begin studying Hebrew.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 8:40 p.m., October 8, 1933.\n\nI went to the dentist again today and then visited the Goldwassers. Mrs. Goldwasser delivered a sermon to me that I had not been nice to her daughters because I did not asked them to dance at the Century the other night. I had thought that greeting them nicely and sitting near them had been enough. I was grateful for all they had done for me, but was surprised by her expectations. Afterwards, I walked with my mother and Leo. I have a bit more writing work and will listen to the radio and study French.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 10:10 p.m., October 9, 1933.\n\nToday before noon I went to see various people in different places regarding the damages from our moving. In the afternoon I studied French before walking with my mother. After dinner I went with Leo Silverman and his sister to the public language school. I am taking two French two-hour classes, one basic and one advanced. The lessons are informative and enjoyable. I need to purchase a different lesson book than the one I was previously using. The other students seem more advanced than I am, but I am confident that I'll be able to catch up. The schedule for Hebrew lessons at the school has not yet been determined. The French classes meet twice weekly.\n\nMother is already sleeping. Now I will go to sleep.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 10:25 p.m., October 10, 1933.\n\nI took my sister walking and went to the dentist. In the afternoon, I studied French. After dinner, I played checkers with my mother. I just received a letter from our lawyer, Mr. Jasper. He said I should come see him in Brussels.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 7:30 p.m., October 11, 1933.\n\nMy father returned from Paris at 1 a.m. today. He told us that he had discussed Palestine with some Frenchmen who had just returned from there. These Frenchmen had returned to Paris because they thought the business opportunities there were difficult, and it would be difficult for their families to adjust to the climate there. This changed my father's mind about Palestine. Now he became focused on Paris. He discussed our opening a barber shop in Paris with a friend of ours in the salon business. He suggested I train to become a beautician so I have the necessary skill. The idea of having a profession is good. But the idea of putting money into a business with a partner who is not willing to invest money is unappealing to me. I am further motivated to learn French. My parents are also now interested in learning French. I am afraid that I am about to endure a financial loss that the palm reader had predicted. I don't want to be superstitious, but I am concerned about opening this business with an uninvested partner in something in which I have no experience.\n\nThis morning I walked with my sister. In the afternoon I was with Mrs. Brochowitz. I left a message for her daughter that I was interested in meeting her at the Sports Club.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 10:15 p.m., October 12, 1933.\n\nToday is Simchas Torah, the last day of Sukkos, a very festive day. After walking with my sister, my father gave me 10 francs. After lunch, I spent two francs at the cinema while my parents visited the Mendelsons in Deurne. I saw a comedy followed by, Girls in Uniform. The first film was about vagabonds; the second I had seen previously in Berlin, Afterwards, I took my sister to temple. Simchas Torah is a holiday which caters very much to children with noise makers, flags, and fruit for all.\n\nAntwerp, Saturday 2:30 p.m., October 14, 1933.\n\nYesterday morning I was in temple with my sister. Then we went for a stroll. In the afternoon I did writing work and walked with my sister. My mother was not feeling well. After dinner, mother went to bed. I went out for a little while before putting Sonia to bed. Afterwards I saw a German film, Once There Was a Waltz in Vienna. The second film, The Plumber in Love, starred Buster Keaton. It was more whimsical than the first and enjoyable.\n\nThis morning I cleaned my room and took my sister for a walk.\n\nAntwerp, Saturday 2:30 p.m., October 14, 1933.\n\nAfter lunch, I went to find a doctor to pay a house call on my mother.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 10:45 p.m., October 15, 1933.\n\nYesterday afternoon the doctor checked in to see my mother. He did not think she needed medication. I begged my father to call a specialist who tends to women. That would be more expensive and my father refused. Before noon today, I took Sonia to the dentist and then out for a walk. I tended to housecleaning, meals, and my little sister. I also assisted my father. In between, I found time to study a bit of French in the dictionary my father bought me for seven-and-a-half francs.\n\nAntwerp, Monday 10:35 p.m., October 16, 1933.\n\nLast night David Mendelson visited. I gave him presents of two of my ties and an old winter coat. Today before noon I ran some errands. First, I went to the French Consulate. They do not want to give me a French visa to visit. Afterwards, I went to the gas and electric company. David Mendelson came back to visit again with his wife. They cooked for us because my mother was still sick. After lunch, I napped and took my sister for a walk. I wrote a letter to our lawyer Jasper in Brussels saying that my parents were trying to move elsewhere. I asked him to send back the papers for our case. Yesterday a police officer came to see my father about my permit to remain in Antwerp. I stated that I did not know from which border we would be leaving Belgium and when. Meanwhile, I hope to extend my temporary permit.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 9:30 p.m., October 17, 1933.\n\nThis morning I again had many errands. I visited several banks for information in connection with our different monies. There is still money remaining in Czechoslovakia, blocked in part because the German government left the Geneva Conference on Arms Control. Everyone is preparing for, and anticipating, war among Germany and the countries surrounding it. By freezing the account, the Czechs hope to keep the money from German authorities who might confiscate it from German Jewish citizens. Today we gave our landlord notice that we anticipate moving to Paris. After dinner, I cleaned the kitchen and put my sister to bed. I am going to study French and go to bed. This evening my mother gave me a gift of five francs for my help around the house.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 10:40 p.m., October 18, 1933.\n\nThis morning I went to the French Consulate with my father to get information on moving. Afterwards, I went to find out about the money in escrow for our damaged furniture. I was supposed to receive that money from the movers, but have not yet received it. I was also supposed to receive a refund for duties mistakenly charged us by the customs house. At the customs house, I was finally advised that we would have to remain in Belgium and prove our residence to receive the money.\n\nI received an invitation to a dance Saturday night from the Jewish Sports Club where Ms. Buchovitz is a member. Ms. Buchovitz contacted me and said she hoped that that I would attend.\n\nAntwerp, Thursday 9:50 p.m., October 19, 1933.\n\nMy father is now also sick, leaving me with many household chores. I read to my father from the Jewish newspaper as he lay in bed. After dinner, I studied my French. My friend Leo visited. He is now in the confectionery business, so I bought some chocolate from him.\n\nAntwerp, Saturday 7 p.m., October 21, 1933.\n\nYesterday, I bought groceries in the morning and then went to the Polish Consulate for my father. In the afternoon, I went to the dentist and the barber. The dentist is working on my third gold cap. All that remains is a filling. Since all my teeth are properly cleaned, I won't have to see him for a while. I paid him 150 francs from my own bank account. In the evening, I made a foot bath and went to bed by 10 p.m.\n\nToday before noon my father and I went to the German and Czech Consulates. My father wants to go to Czechoslovakia on Monday to personally try to get our bank account released. In the afternoon, with my mother's help, I cleaned and pressed two suits. Now I am waiting for dinner. I look forward to going to the dance tonight.\n\nAntwerp, Sunday 9:35 p.m., October 22, 1933.\n\nLast night I went to the Sports Club where there were many young Jewish men and women. A Victrola provided music. Young couples were dancing. The entire affair was in a large room rented in a hotel. The party ended at midnight and a group of us escorted each other home. I arrived home by 1:30 a.m. and went to bed. The entire evening cost three francs and forty centimes. This morning I took my sister for a walk.

My father gave me 20 francs for sending him off so nicely. I hope my father will have a safe trip and return.\n\nAntwerp, Tuesday 11:35 p.m., October 24, 1933.\n\nThis morning I wrote some business correspondence and did my grocery shopping. I visited the gas and electric company. We have temporarily withdrawn our notice of moving with our landlord. I watched my sister in the afternoon while my mother went to the beauty parlor. Then, I walked with my mother and sister. After dinner, I ironed my laundry and spent five francs on a double feature starring Jackie Cooper, The Close Friendship, and a French film, Cadaver #5. I understood the French film well and enjoyed it.\n\nAntwerp, Wednesday 10:55 p.m., October 25, 1933.\n\nBefore noon I walked with my sister and went to the bathhouse for a shower costing five francs. In the afternoon, I visited the Goldwassers with"
