        "text": "After finalizing his college degree, Luc started his logistic career in the early ‘80s as a shipping clerk and developed his skills into project shipment and chartering for multiple breakbulk shipping lines. He remained active in the shipping industry until 1993 when he was invited to become director of a well-known forwarding company in Antwerp, founded in 1918 as a part of the VanUden Group in Rotterdam. After realizing a management buyout in 1993, Luc at the same time obtained the ownership of another Antwerp forwarding company with a 50 years logistic tradition in the local Antwerp market.\n\nFive years later, Luc and his partners created the Atlas International Network together with their life time mentor, Issa Baluch, former FIATA president and owner of Swift Freight in Dubai.

All classes followed there, were taught in Spanish. This has allowed her to improve her Spanish skills significantly.\n\nAfter her studies, she first did an internship in a qualified hospital in Belgium, where she worked as a supervisor on the quality and accreditation department.

After 3 years he joined Triangle Shipping (a division of Barwil) as branch manager.\n\nAnother 2 years later, Geert became business development manager for Barwil Vietnam.

He was responsible for supply chain strategy and execution covering all transportation means (Rail, Land, Sea, Air) in various regions (Baltics, Scandinavia, CIS). Serving at both ends for shippers and transportation companies allowed Tomas to better understand the supply chain and logistics management concept. After 13+ years of corporate life, Tomas decided to open his own company, which helps both logistics service providers and supply chain organizations to be more competitive in the market and implement the necessary changes. Tomas is a massive believer in digitization and process efficiency, as this is the key to success.

In 2017, I made the change to the Atlas International Network as Event & Business Coordinator.\n\nWorking together with members from all over the globe has been a wonderful experience. I have been fortunate to have met many of our members in person during our annual conferences.\n\nWhich I believe is one of the highlights of the Atlas International Network. I’m convinced that our team has the capability to strengthen en enlarge the Atlas International Network by constantly looking for better and new benefits for our members.\n\nMaria started her Economics studies at Alexandru I. Cuza University in Iasi, Romania. After 3 years, she developed an interest in sales and started her career in a small business as a Sales Representative.
