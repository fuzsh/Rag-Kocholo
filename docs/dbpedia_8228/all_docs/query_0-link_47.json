        "text": "by Victoria E. Burke\n\nThis post adds another physical book owned by Katherine Blount to her ever-expanding library list and also reveals a manuscript that demonstrates her reading practices in action. Previous posts by Sarah Lindenbaum, Sophie Floate, William Poole, and Mary Ann O’Donnell have brought the total number of books inscribed by Katherine Blount to twelve, but additional discoveries by Martine van Elk and Sarah Lindenbaum have expanded that list further to 40 titles. As research by Lindenbaum and O’Donnell outlines, Katherine Blount was the daughter of James Butler and Grace Caldecott of Amberley Castle in Sussex. Born in 1676, she married Sir Thomas Pope Blount, 2nd Baronet in 1695.[1] When I started researching the miscellany of Katherine Butler (St. Paul’s Cathedral Library MS 52 D.14) around 2010, I proposed a few branches of the Butler family to which she might have belonged, including the Butlers of Amberley Castle, but I wasn’t certain.[2] Now that I have compared Katherine Butler’s signature and handwriting to those of the printed books identified in the other posts, I can confidently say that the Katherine Butler who inscribed a manuscript collection of sermons by John Donne and Joseph Hall in 1693 and who used the blank pages in that same manuscript to compile a miscellany from 1696 onwards is the same person as Katherine Blount. I can also confirm that the marginal notes written in the book described by Floate (Cyrano de Bergerac’s The Comical History) and the identifications of characters in the manuscript key and the text of the book described by Poole (Samuel Garth’s The Dispensary) are indeed in Blount’s hand. But readers of this post can judge for themselves.\n\nThe manuscript collection of sermons by John Donne and Joseph Hall\n\nA manuscript collection of five sermons (four by John Donne and one by Joseph Hall), now St. Paul’s Cathedral Library MS 52 D.14, is inscribed “Katherine Butler Given me by my Father May 1693” (fol. 1r). The donor of this manuscript was James Butler of Amberley Castle, who died on 11 July 1696.\n\nThe sermons were transcribed by Knightley Chetwode in 1625 and 1626 or shortly thereafter. [3]\n\nExactly how this early seventeenth-century sermon collection came into the hands of James Butler and what occasion prompted him to give it as a gift to his daughter, Katherine, in 1693 are unclear.\n\nKatherine Blount’s manuscript miscellany in verse and prose\n\nButler signed her name only once in St. Paul’s Cathedral Library MS 52 D.14, two years before her marriage in 1695, after which she would have signed her married name of Blount. But she was already Katherine Blount in 1696 when she began using the blank pages of the sermon manuscript to create her own miscellany. On fol. 178r, after the sermons, she wrote the heading “1696” and began a collection of verse extracts, and sometimes complete poems, ending at fol. 195v.\n\nFacing that first page of poetry is an inscription on fol. 177v in which she explains her motivations for her selections: “The reason why I wrote severall of these following Verses, was not that I thought them all good, but the subjects was – what, I had occasion to make vse of.”\n\nBlount does indeed make use of her chosen poems and extracts, consistently identifying them by theme or title, and favoring topics like friendship, virtue, and the importance of moderation, among others. Her “subjects” were not narrowly moralistic, however. As we can see from fol. 181r, she transcribes all of Abraham Cowley’s poem “Drinking” (which ends with the rousing couplet, “Should every Creature drink but I / Why, Men of Morals, tell me why?”).\n\nAt the bottom of this page she includes two passages from different plays by John Dryden that disparage the state of marriage; it is a “Curse of Life,” “Loves nauseous cure,” and “but ye Pleasure of a Day.”[4]\n\nBlount also began writing a second section of her manuscript in the year 1696. She took the manuscript and turned it upside down, making a new first page from the end of the volume and beginning a section of prose, which runs from fols. 276v, reversed to 230v, reversed. In the image below, you can see that she has headed this section, “A Common Place Book 1696.” Though I have called her manuscript a miscellany (since it is primarily a collection of miscellaneous extracts in verse and prose), it could equally be called a commonplace book, as she has labeled the prose section, since it is largely organized thematically.\n\nIt is this heading that convinced me that Katherine Butler was Katherine Blount since, though the main hand of the miscellany is messier than any of the inscriptions in her printed books, the upper case “B” looks very similar to all of the “B”s each time she signs “Blount.” The upper case “P” looks similar to that in the word “Pope” in the inscription in O’Donnell’s post. And the date “1696” on both pages in the St. Paul’s manuscript replicates the number forms in all of her dates on her printed books. Blount died in 1753, and so she may have continued writing in this manuscript well into the eighteenth century. The final item in the verse section can be dated to 1719, though a later edition is possible, while one of the final items in the prose section in Blount’s hand appears to have been taken from a book published in 1736.[5]\n\nMore books from Katherine Blount’s library?\n\nNot only does Blount identify many of her chosen passages by topic, but at several points in her manuscript she has written authors’ names, works, and page numbers beside passages, and many of those transcribed passages match specific editions.[6] Here is a list of works in which her transcriptions and page numbers match known editions; these are volumes she is likely to have consulted—and perhaps owned—from the verse section of the manuscript, rearranged into alphabetical order:\n\nBoyle, Roger, Earl of Orrery. Tryphon,in Four New Plays (1670) or Six Plays (1694)[7]\n\nBrome, Alexander. Songs and Other Poems (1668)\n\nCharron, Pierre. Of Wisdome, Three Books, translated by George Stanhope (1697)\n\nCowley, Abraham. Works (any edition between 1668 and 1693)[8]\n\nDenham, John. Poems and Translations (1668, 1671, or 1684)\n\nDryden, John. An Evening’s Love, or, The Mock-Astrologer (1691)[9]\n\nDryden, John. Aureng-zebe, A Tragedy (1685)\n\nDryden, John. The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards (1687)[10]\n\nDryden, John. The Hind and the Panther. A Poem (1687)[11]\n\nDryden, John. The Indian Emperor, or, The Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards (1686 or 1692)\n\nMontaigne, Michel de. Essays, three volumes, translated by Charles Cotton (1685-86)[12]\n\nNorris, John. A Collection of Miscellanies (1687 or 1692)\n\nPhilips, Katherine. Poems (1667, 1669, or 1678)\n\nPlutarch’s Morals Translated from the Greek by Several Hands, vols. 1 and 2 (1691 or 1694)[13]\n\nReynolds, Edward. A Treatise of the Passions and Faculties of the Soul of Man (1656)\n\nSuckling, John. Works (1676)\n\nTuke, Samuel. The Adventures of Five Houres: A Tragi-Comedy (1671)\n\nWaller, Edmund. Poems (1694)\n\nWilmot, John, Earl of Rochester. Poems on Several Occasions (1680 or 1685)\n\nIn the prose section, Blount lists two page references tied to works that match the following printed texts:\n\nMarana, Giovanni Paolo. The First Volume of Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy (1691, 1692, 1693, or 1694) or the eight-volume edition (1694)\n\nSprat, Thomas. The History of the Royal-Society (1667, 1702, 1722, or 1734)\n\nInterestingly, one of the books described in Lindenbaum’s post, Reynolds’ A Treatise of the Passions (1656), is in the above list. It was the first book that Blount used in the verse portion of the miscellany. She inscribed the Reynolds book on July 10, 1696, and I wonder if then or shortly thereafter she wrote the heading “1696” in the St. Paul’s manuscript and began transcribing. Visible in the marginal notes beside the second entry in figure 3, above, you can see the note “Reynolds saith in his Tre: of ye Pa: & Faulties of ye Soul Page ye 228.” This short passage on grief (the only passage in prose in the verse section of the manuscript) is indeed from p. 228 in Reynolds’ book. But Reynolds’ treatise is also the source for the rest of the passages on this first page, those she has attributed to Ovid, Lucretius, and Euripides; of three on the following page (fol. 178v), which she has attributed to The Iliad, Ovid, and Homer; and of one on fol. 186v, which she has attributed to “A Greek Poet,” which Reynolds identifies as Euripides. In these seven passages (which appear in Reynolds, pp. 228, 179, 122, 89, 284, 297-98, and 265), Blount obscures Reynolds as the source and instead highlights his own marginal references to classical authors and their works, no doubt capitalizing on the cultural cachet of these ancient sources.[14]\n\nAs Lindenbaum and Van Elk have discovered, Blount owned books written by Ben Jonson (The Works, 1692, which she purchased in 1699), Edmund Waller (The Works, 1729, which was given to her by the editor in 1730), and Francis Bacon (The Essays or Counsels, 1673, which she inscribed in 1697). Though extracts or complete works by each writer appear in Blount’s miscellany, those precise editions were not her source. A marginal note indicates that the eight-line passage from Jonson’s translation of Horace’s De Arte Poetica appeared “In a Translation of Hor:” (fol. 187v). This suggests that Blount’s source was The Poems of Horace, Consisting of Odes, Satyres, and Epistles Rendered in English Verse by Several Persons, which included Jonson’s translation in the editions of 1666 and 1671. There are four extracts from Waller, from The Maid’s Tragedy Altered (fol. 178v), “Of Divine Love. Six Cantos” (fol. 179r), “A Panegyrick to my Lord Protector” (fol. 179r), and “Upon the Earl of Roscommon’s Translation of Horace” (fol. 180v). Two of the four extracts have page numbers beside them, and these line up with Waller’s Poems of 1694 but do not match the 1729 edition.[15] Since Blount began compiling her manuscript in 1696, and since the Waller extracts appear near the beginning (fols. 178v, 179r, and 180v), the Waller edition she received in 1730 is not her source. Finally, the Bacon item she includes in full, “The Character of Queen Elizabeth” (fols. 257v, rev.-247v, rev.), is the English translation that was first printed in the 1696 edition of The Essays or Counsels; the 1673 edition she owned does not include that work.[16] Blount might have used editions from 1696, 1701, 1706, or 1718, all of which included the version she transcribed.\n\nBlount’s sources are even more plentiful than the above list since many more rhyming couplets, prose and verse extracts, and complete poems and prose works appear in her miscellany, only sometimes identified by author. Though the exact works and editions are not always clear, in addition to those already mentioned she includes passages or complete works from the following authors in her compilation: Edward Baynard, Thomas Browne, Colley Cibber, John Cleveland, Jeremy Collier, Thomas Creech, William Davenant, John Donne, Richard Fanshawe, Charles Gildon, Matthew Morgan, John Oldham, John Philips, Samuel Pufendorf, Charles Sedley, Jeremy Taylor, William Walsh, and John Webster.[17]\n\nKatherine Blount’s miscellany gives us a rich opportunity to see one woman from the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth century engaging with her reading material. It is likely that more books owned by Blount from the above lists will surface, so let’s all keep our antennae out.\n\nSource: St. Paul’s Cathedral Library MS 52 D.14.

The second passage is from Dryden’s Aureng-zebe, a Tragedy, and Blount’s page reference of 46 matches the 1685 edition of that play.\n\n[5] The final item in the verse section, the first 13 lines from the verse prologue of Dr Edward Baynard’s Health: A Poem, must be from the 1719 edition (the first to include the verse prologue) or later editions. An item from the later pages of the prose section in Blount’s hand (fol. 259r, rev.) appears to have been extracted from The Counsels of Wisdom, Or a Collection of Such Maxims of Solomon as are Most Necessary for the Prudent Conduct of Life … by Monseigneur Fouquet …, vol. 1 (1736), p. 28. While two seventeenth-century volumes with similar titles from 1680 and 1683 contain the passage, Blount’s wording matches the 1736 edition.\n\n[6] My thanks to Shane Hawkins, who matched many of the references to digitized copies of books in Early English Books Online (EEBO), which catalogues books printed from 1475-1700, and Eighteenth-Century Collections Online (ECCO).\n\n[7] Though Orrery’s Two New Tragedies (1669) also contains this extract on the page listed by Blount (p. 45), she later quotes (without a page reference) from Orrery’s Mustapha, a play which appears in the 1670 and 1694 volumes but not the 1669. It is thus more likely that she used the 1670 or 1694 edition for the extracts from both plays.\n\n[8] Blount’s page numbers line up with the editions of 1668, 1669, 1672, 1674, 1678, 1680, 1681, 1684, 1688, and 1693. Though the page numbers also match Cowley’s Poems (1656), she later quotes (without a page reference) from a work that does not appear in the 1656 edition, making it more likely that all of her Cowley quotations come from an edition of his Works.\n\n[9] Blount’s page number matches the 1691 edition of An Evening’s Love, or, The Mock-Astrologer, but also the version of the play found in the three-volume 1695 collection of Dryden’s works. Only one other Dryden work in this list fits the pagination in the three-volume 1695 edition (The Hind and Panther); since none of Blount’s page numbers for Aureng-zebe, The Conquest of Granada, or The Indian Emperor match the three-volume edition, it is not likely the source for her Dryden extracts. A final play by Dryden, All for Love, or, The World Well Lost a Tragedy, is quoted by Blount, but her edition is uncertain since the Prologue from which she quotes is unpaginated in all editions (1678, 1692, 1696, and the three-volume 1695 edition of Dryden’s works).\n\n[10] The quotation appears on pp. 87-88 in the 1678 edition, but the only edition in which it appears on p. 88 (Blount’s reference) is the 1687 edition.\n\n[11] Blount must have extracted from one of the three editions Jacob Tonson printed in 1687, since her reference of p. 14 lines up with those editions only (not with the other two editions printed in 1687, by James Watson and by Andrew Crook and Samuel Helsham, whose pagination is different).\n\n[12] Though Blount gives a page reference for only one of her eleven quotations from this source (p. 327 from vol. 1), the quotations come from all three volumes.\n\n[13] Blount quotes nine times from volume 1 or 2 of this work, but only gives a page number once (p. 37), which matches volume 1 of the 1691 and 1694 editions.\n\n[14] For a discussion of Blount’s use of classical sources in her miscellany see Burke, “The disagreeable Figure of a Common-Place,” pp. 193-94. Blount also obscures Samuel Pufendorf’s Of the Law of Nature and Nations (1703) as the source of thirty classical quotations.\n\n[15] The page reference given by Blount for the extract from “Of Divine Love. Six Cantos” (p. 281) matches both the 1694 and 1705 editions, but the page reference for The Maid’s Tragedy Altered (p. 10) matches the edition of the play first printed in 1690, and then in the Poems of 1694, but not the 1705 edition, suggesting that Blount likely used the 1694 edition for her Waller extracts.\n\n[16] Two different English translations were printed earlier in the century: one in 1651 in The Felicity of Queen Elizabeth: and Her Times (pp. 1-42) and one in 1657 in the collection Resuscitatio (pp. 181-93). This latter translation by William Rawley was praised as superior in Baconiana, or, Certain Genuine Remains of Sr. Francis Bacon (1679), pp. 52-53, by “T. T.” The Latin text seems first to have been printed, also by Rawley, in the Latin collection entitled Opuscula varia posthuma (1658), pp. 175-94.\n\n[17] Later material that may be in a different hand includes a sermon by John Scott, letters by John Tillotson and James Radcliffe, and “Mrs Cowlings Thoughts upon Time.” (The last may be the Mrs. Couling referred to by Van Koughnet as a friend of Blount’s sister, Grace: p. 68). For additional work on Blount’s reading material and strategies see the two articles (and forthcoming work) by Burke.\n\nMichael Durrant (IES, University of London)\n\nThe title page of the 1673 self-help manual, The Gentlewomans Companion; or, A Guide to the Female Sex (ESTC, R204109), discreetly tucks “By Hannah Woolley” at the foot of the text’s long title, sandwiching “Woolley” between two rules and just above the imprint, where we find another female agent being marked out as a key player in this text’s making: “LONDON, Printed by A[nne] Maxwell [fl. 1660-1680] for Dorman Newman at the Kings-Arms in the Poultry, 1673.”\n\nAs Martine van Elk has written elsewhere on this blog, Anne Maxwell’s involvement as the Companion’s printer seems fairly well assured, but Hannah Woolley’s involvement as the Companion’s author is rather less clear cut. For sure, Woolley was a likely candidate to be the author of a text that, to quote from the title page again, purports to contain “Directions of [female] Behaviour, in all Places, | Companies, Relations, and Conditions, from | their Childhood down to Old Age.” She had made a name for herself as an expert writer of recipes and matters to do with household management, and so there’s scope to imagine that Woolley really did branch out to pen the Companion, in which tips on cooking, cleaning, human hygiene and health jostle alongside prescriptions on proper female speech, conversation, gait and posture, and guidelines for the writing of letters. But really The Gentlewomans Companion seems to have been spurious, an attempt by its publisher, Newman, working alongside its printer, Maxwell, to cash in on the Woolley brand\n\nWhilst it has been suggested that the Companion may have been based on an authentic Woolley manuscript,[1] Woolley would publicly disown the text soon after its publication in 1673, complaining in a dedicatory poem that accompanied A Supplement to the Queen-like Closet (1674) that her “Name” had been “much abus’d” by the Companion; Woolley had in fact been “far distant” when the Companion was printed; and since her authorial identity (her “Name”) had been appropriated without her consent, Woolley concludes by asserting “that Book to own I think not fit.”\n\nThe whole issue of appropriation—and with this, the idea of where early modern books come from—is addressed in the Companion’s epistle, “To all Young Ladies, Gentlewomen, and all Maidens whatever,” which is allegedly Woolley-authored. There, “Woolley” tells us that, given the commercial success of her other print products (“the first called, The Ladies Directory; the other, The Cooks Guide”), she had been encouraged by both her “Book-seller” and her “worthy Friends” (sig. A3r) to write a more fulsome “Companion and Guide to the Female Sex” (sig. A3v). Over the course of seven years, “Woolley” read and researched her way through several contemporary manuals on female instruction, including “that Excellent Book, The Queens Closet; May’s Cookery; The Ladies Companion,” her own “Directory and Guide,” as well as fashionable books “lately writ in the French and Italian Languages” (sig. A4r-v). “Woolley” then settles on imagery associated with the painting of portraits to account for the way in which she actively folded words and ideas from these books into her own writing:\n\nI hope the Reader will not think it much, that as the famous Lymner when he drew the Picture of an exact Beauty, made use of an Eye from one, of a Mouth from another, and so cull’d what was rare in all others, that he might present them all in one entire piece of Workmanship and Frame: So I, when I was to write of Physick and Chyrurgery, have consulted all Books I could meet with in that kind, to compleat my own Experiences (sig. A4v–A5r).\n\nQuoting the same passage, Leah Orr suggests that “[s]uch “culling” is very generally practiced [in the period] but rarely stated so forthrightly.”[2] Given Woolley’s own complaint that the Companion had actually “abus’d” (or we might say “cull’d) her “Name” and therefore her brand identity, there appears to be something cheekily self-referential at work here. Indeed, the “Lymner” imagery—and with this, the idea of an individual’s portrait being made of bits and pieces drawn from the bodies of other subjects—seems particularly pointed given the fact that the Companion was published alongside a paratextual portrait, which was supposed to be in the likeness of Woolley herself, but that was really a retouched image of someone else.\n\nTurning now to the British Library’s (BL) copy of The Gentlewomans Companion (C.194.a.1455), we can see that the issues of appropriation I’ve been discussing find expression in evidence related to book use and competing claims to book ownership.\n\nThis copy lacks the suspect Woolley portrait, although on its title page we do find a seventeenth-century inscription, written in brownish ink, which designates female ownership: “Elizabeth Polwheile her booke.”\n\nWriting for the BL’s “Untold Lives” blog, Beth Cortese suggests that this “Elizabeth Polwheile” is likely the Restoration playwright, Elizabeth Polwhele (c. 1651–1691), who was the author of at least two unpublished plays, The Faythfull Virgins (c. 1670) and The Frolicks, or The Lawyer Cheated (c. 1671). It’s an exciting possibility, because as Cortese points out, it would offer us a little glimpse into the library of a woman about whom we still know little, and her ownership of “Woolley’s” Gentlewomans Companion might suggest that this text was being used not only for educational purposes but perhaps also as one of Polwhele’s “literary influences”.\n\nThis scenario—that Polwhele read the BL’s copy of the Companion for the bits that could be “cull’d” to form the basis of her own writing—might explain the presence of two hand-drawn crosses (+) that are positioned in the margins of this book. Written in what appears to be the same brownish ink used to write the “Elizabeth Polwheile her booke” inscription, these marginal notations materialise in the concluding section of the book, where “Woolley” offers a suite of imaginary/stock “Letters upon all Occasions” (sig. Q3v–S3v). The first cross appears in the left-hand margin of “The Answer of an ingenious Lady” (sig. Q8v). This letter serves as a reply to the preceding “Letter from one Lady to another, condemning Artificial-beauty” (sig. Q7r–Q8r), and it finds the “ingenious Lady” arguing for a woman’s right to wear cosmetics, and she fights back at prevailing stereotypes that linked the “Art in the imbellishing” with female “sin”, “pride” and “vanity” (sig. Q8v). The second cross appears in the right-hand margin of “A Lady to her Daughter, perswading her from wearing Spots and Black-patches in her face” (sig. R2r), in which another “Lady” adopts an entirely antithetical line, neurotically linking cosmetics and female fashions with libertine excess and therefore with “the vices of this present age.”\n\nI don’t know for sure whether these two crosses were put there by Polwhele, but if she is responsible for these markings, perhaps it’s evidence of her reaching into “Woolley’s” Companion to mark-up moments that might be usefully appropriated within the contexts of her own dramaturgy—serving, say, as a source for ready-made dialogues between female characters who could represent competing forms of femininity.\n\nSo, a book that seems to have appropriated the Woolley brand, and a book that, at the same time, draws attention to rather than obscures its own literary appropriations and borrowings, may have become a site of creative appropriation for at least one female Restoration playwright. But then returning to the title page of the BL’s copy of The Gentlewomans Companion, we find another, later hand reaching into the text to mark out another identity, another form of ownership, and with this, another layer of appropriation.\n\nJust under the “Elizabeth Polwheile her booke” statement, a male hand has inserted the word “formerly”; just below that, the same hand then adds that Polwhele’s book “is now the property of Edmund Hopkinson”—that is, Edmund Hopkinson (1787–1869) of Edgeworth Manor House near Cirencester, who was the High Sheriff in Gloucestershire. An avid collector of antiquities—including, by all accounts, an Egyptian mummy, which he unwrapped during a dinner party before donating to the Gloucester Museum in the 1850s—Hopkinson steps in to appropriate the title page of The Gentlewomans Companion as a space to enact his own masculinist (self-)possession. Nudging Polwhele to the side, the book seems to become Hopkinson’s “property,” but in the case of The Gentlewomans Companion, where issues of possession and attribution and appropriation seem to be constantly shifting and recalibrating, such an assertion is really more complex than it might first appear.\n\nSource: copy held at the British Library, shelf mark C.194.a.1455.

Fascinating research done in recent years has not yet reached the general public. Many other sources have not been studied thus far. Therefore, students of Dutch at the University of Antwerp studied seven early printed books from the seventeenth century that are preserved in the library of the Ruusbroec Institute of the University of Antwerp (https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/ruusbroec-institute/library/). Each of these religious books can be linked to women in at least two ways. They dealt with women’s exemplary lives, were written or printed by or dedicated to them, and, at a later stage, found their way to female owners. In this blogpost we present the students’ findings.\n\nTheresa of Ávila as a Source of Inspiration\n\nThe works of the influential Spanish mystic, saint, and Doctor of the Church Theresa of Ávila (1515–1582) became widespread across Europe soon after her death, partly under the influence of the Counter-Reformation. Her reformed ideas that led to the foundation of the Order of Discalced Carmelites in 1562 also reached the Catholic part of the Netherlands. Several of her texts were translated — sometimes indirectly via French — into Dutch. The Bibliography of the Hand Press Book in Flanders (STCV: Short Title Catalogue Vlaanderen; https://vlaamse-erfgoedbibliotheken.be/en/dossier/short-title-catalogue-flanders-stcv/stcv) lists seventeen different Dutch-language books, some of which were printed multiple times. In addition, several of her texts in Spanish, French, and Latin were also distributed in the Southern Netherlands.\n\nThe Bruydegoms vrede-kus oft Bemerckingen vande liefde Godts (Bridegroom’s Peace-Kiss or Reflections on the Love of God), in which Theresa described various sorts of prayer, was printed in 1647 by the widow of the Antwerp printer Jan Cnobbaert (1590–1637). The work was annotated by the Spanish Carmelite Jerónimo Gracián (1545–1614), Theresa’s spiritual mentor. The Discalced Carmelite Antonius of Jesus produced the Dutch translation at St Joseph’s Convent in Antwerp (as he did for many of her other works). He dedicated the translation to Françoise de Bette (1593–1666), who was the abbess of the Benedictine convent in Vorst near Brussels from 1637 until her death.\n\nIn 1687 Hieronymus Verdussen V (1650–1717) printed Den catechismus van S.te Theresia (The Catechism of St Theresa) in Antwerp. According to the title page, Petrus Thomas a S. Maria (1611–1686), a Discalced Carmelite from Normandy, gathered the spiritual teachings “uyt de Schriften ende eygen Woorden vande selve Heylige” (“from the writings and own words of the same saint”). He published the result in French in Rouen in 1672. His French version was translated by a person who only left his initials M. AE. S. in the Antwerp edition and therefore cannot be identified.\n\nAdditionally, the library of the Ruusbroec Institute keeps a Dutch translation of Theresa’s biography by the Spanish Jesuit Francisco Ribera (1537–1591). The Spanish version (La vida de la madre Teresa de Iesus) was published in Salamanca in 1590. The anonymous Dutch translation, entitled Het leven der H. Moeder Terese van Iesus fundaterse vande barvoetsche carmeliten ende carmeliterssen (The Life of the Holy Mother Theresa of Jesus, Founder of the Discalced Carmelites), was printed in Antwerp thirty years later by Joachim Trognesius (between 1556 and 1559–1624). Whether the translation was made directly from Spanish or, as in the previous example, from French is not clear. It is certain, however, that a French version by the Carmelite Jean de Brétigny (1556–1634) and the Carthusian Guillaume de Chèvre circulated in the Netherlands: the 1607 edition of La vie de la mere Terese de Jesus was published in Antwerp by Gaspar Bellerus (fl. 1606–1617).\n\nThe Lives of Spiritual Virgins\n\nSome inspirational women from the Low Countries also helped shape literary and devotional culture. We know a great deal about them because they documented their lives and religious experiences extensively in diaries and correspondences with their confessors. Based on this auto-biographical documentation, their Lives were written. The Jesuit Daniël Huysmans (1643–1704), for example, wrote biographies of Agnes van Heilsbagh (1597–1640) and Joanna van Randenraedt (1610–1684), who were both spiritual daughters — unmarried women who wanted to lead a religious life, often under the spiritual guidance of Jesuits, without joining a convent. Both Agnes and Johanna lived in Roermond in Limburg (nowadays located in the Netherlands) and were involved in education and the promotion of Christian values. Their biographies in Huysmans’s versions were printed in Antwerp shortly after each other. Kort begryp des levens ende der deughden vande weerdighe Joanna van Randenraedt (Short Account of the Life and Virtues of the Honorable Joanna van Randenraedt) was published and printed in 1690 by Augustinus Great (fl. 1685–1691); Leven ende deughden vande weerdighe Agnes van Heilsbagh (Live and Virtues of the Honorable Agnes Heilsbagh) appeared a year later and was printed by Michiel Knobbaert (fl. 1652–1706). Huysmans integrated the letters of both spiritual daughters into his Lives, which allowed the voices of these women to resonate distinctly in his texts.\n\nFinally, the Carmelite tertiary and mystic Maria Petyt (1623–1677) wrote an autobiography and corresponded with her spiritual counsellor Michael a Sancto Augustino (1621–1684). He published Maria’s texts posthumously in Het leven vande weerdighe moeder Maria a S.ta Teresia, (alias) Petyt, Vanden derden Reghel vande Orden der Broederen van Onse L. Vrouwe des berghs Carmeli (The life of the honorable mother Maria a Sancta Teresa, (alias) Petyt, from the Third Rule of the Order of the Brethren of Our Lady of the Mount Carmel), which came out in Ghent in 1683. Michael claims not to have modified any of Maria’s words in his four-volume publication of no fewer than 1,500 pages. He, however, added a short introduction to each chapter.\n\nBooks in Women’s Hands\n\nThese works by and about women were often destined for a female readership. This is evident from the many ownership inscriptions we discovered. Most of the books ended up in female communities. Theresa of Ávila’s Bruydegoms vrede-kus, for instance, belonged to Catrijn de Roos, who lived “opt groodt begijn hof” (“in the large beguinage”; fly leaf at the front) of an, unfortunately, unspecified town. Some of the books belonged to Alexian sisters (“zwartzusters”). The Life of Agnes van Heilsbagh was owned by her namesake Agnes Vandervloet, who lived in the Alexian community in Antwerp. Het leven der H. Moeder Terese van Iesus was kept in the convent of Alexian sisters in Ypres for no fewer than 175 years. It was donated to the community by Nicolais Reynier in 1624 (Figure 4). There, Sister Catalijn van der Bogaerde owned it. A note at the end of the book further shows that in 1788 it was still in the convent, now being kept by Sister Theresia Verbeke.\n\nBesloten hof, het innigh ghebedt betuynt met de doornen-haghe der verstervinghe (Enclosed Garden, the Inner Prayer Bordered with the Thorny Hedge of Mortification) (Antwerp: Arnout van Brakel, 1665) is associated with two female communities. It is dedicated to Maria van Praet (d. 1668), who at the time of publication was “hooftmeestesse” (“grand mistress”) of the beguinage of Antwerp. Later, the book ended up in a women’s convent (possibly of Discalced Carmelite nuns) in Willebroek, a little town south of Antwerp. The ownership inscriptions at the fly leaf at the front show how the book was passed from person to person within the convent, presumably after the previous owner died. Under Sister Theresia Helman’s name the inscription “Requiescat in Pace” was added, and Sister Joanna van Luijtelaer’s name was followed by the abbreviation “R.I.P.”. Presumably Sister Anna t’Kint, who wrote her name at the top of the page, was the book’s new owner.\n\nSome books were more likely owned by secular women. Den catechismus van S.te Theresia, for instance, is said to have been in the possession of “Joanna Chaterina Roovers woonende in de Copper straet inden wieten engel” (“Joanna Chaterina Roovers living in the Copperstraet in the White Angel”; fly leaf at the front). Unfortunately, it is not clear where the Copperstraet was. The third volume of Het leven vande weerdighe moeder Maria a s.ta Teresia, (alias) Petyt can be located more precisely. It was owned by Joanna Francisca van der Eijnde who lived “op den tribunael tot Mechelen” (“at the tribunal in Mechelen”; fly leaf at the front). She probably belonged to a family of painters whose members lived and worked as porters in that same tribunal (the court of justice). Remarkably, Arnold Frans Van den Eynde (1793–1885), a possible family member of Joanna Francisca, painted the Carmelite convent in Mechelen where Maria Petyt lived as an anchorite in the last phase of her life.\n\nTowards an Inclusive Literary History\n\nOur exploratory research in the library of the Ruusbroec Institute shows the importance of research into handwritten inscriptions in printed books. It shows that there is still a world to discover when it comes to the relationship between women and (religious) book culture in the early modern period. Both religious and secular women participated in the production, reception, and circulation of seventeenth-century printed books in many different ways. In several books, women’s spiritual ideas were passed on by men who wanted to make their voices heard. Books were dedicated to women or put out to print by them. Many copies reached female audiences. In some cases, we find that books were passed down from woman to woman for generations.\n\nOur work also underlines again the importance of enhancing access to heritage collections and making material evidence in individual copies available. A systematic exploration of early printed book collections will bring visibility to large numbers of women. Provenance data in early printed books can teach us which women read and wrote or were otherwise involved in the book culture of their time. Such data can also be used to discover what women read, for what reason, and in what context. It is this type of research into women’s books that will help us eventually to construct an inclusive history of early modern Dutch literature.\n\nNote: This blogpost was developed within the module “Women and early modern literature” of the BA-course “Dutch Studies in Practice” (“Neerlandistiek in de praktijk”) of the Language and Literature program of the University of Antwerp.

After all, each new name has the potential to enrich our understanding of women’s reading and their intellectual, devotional, political, and recreational lives in the early modern period. The beautifully wrought signature of Dulcibella Kent, dated 1734, on the title page of a 1616 edition of Ben Jonson’s Workes is a perfect example. Our attention is drawn by the unusual first name (derived from dulce, Latin for sweet) and the florid handwriting, which is offset by the stately engraved title page.\n\nYet this “sweet” reader conceals a dark reality.\n\nDulcibella Kent was born in 1711 to Susanna Chafe and prosperous London merchant Charles Kent. Three daughters would outlive the Kents, Dulcibella and her older sisters Susanna (b. 1705) and Charlotte (b. 1707). Dulcibella was baptized on 17 April and her father died at forty-nine on 14 April, 1716, so on or around her fifth birthday, followed by her mother on 16 February, 1718. It is not clear who took charge of the not-quite-seven-year-old Dulcibella and her sisters, the eldest of whom was only thirteen at the time. It must have been a sad and frightening period in the girls’ lives.\n\nAlthough it could not have made up for the loss of their parents, the girls were handsomely provided for in Kent’s will and his estate was placed in trust for them. Emily J. Climenson’s The History of Shiplake, Oxon. (1894) describes Kent as a “rich merchant who owned property in several counties, also important estates in Jamaica.” The anodyne phrase “also important estates in Jamaica” disguises the sinister truth: these estates were built upon the backs of enslaved Africans. Says Professor Trevor Burnard for The Guardian:\n\nJamaica in the 18th century was described by Charles Leslie as a “constant mine, whence Britain draws prodigious riches”. It contributed greatly to the wealth of individuals thousands of miles away, such as William Beckford, Lord Mayor of London and the owner of well over 1,000 enslaved people, whose statue still graces Guildhall in London. But more significantly, it enriched Britain by filling the coffers of the Treasury with money from taxes levied on sugar and rum. Britain was the greatest slave trader in the Atlantic world during the 18th century, sending nearly 1 million captive Africans to Jamaica between 1655 and 1807, resulting in a population of enslaved people barely over 300,000, due to horrific mortality rates. Black people suffered greatly for white people’s enjoyment of sweet things.\n\nThe Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery is unequivocal, calling Charles Kent a “slave-trader, shown as deceased co-owner with Col. Richard Thompson (q.v.) of Morant estate from 1740 until 1832.” The Morant estate, located in St Thomas-in-the-East, Surrey, Jamaica, now Saint Thomas Parish, produced rum, molasses, corn—and sugar. Dulce indeed.\n\nWhile she may have been ignorant of how her father’s fortune was made when she was a young orphan, by the time she inscribed her copy of Ben Jonson’s Workes in 1734 as a woman in her early twenties, she could not have been in doubt. She was listed as a joint owner of the estate from her father’s death in 1716 to 1793, the year of her own death. In her will, she bequeathed the Jamaica estates to her son Edward Dodwell.\n\nDulcibella did not marry until 1744 when she was in her early thirties, older than the average marrying age of 25 or 26 for women at the time. Although she was by no means an old maid then, her disquietingly acquired wealth would have enabled her to delay marriage if she wished. She lived with her husband Henry Dodwell in Golden Square, a well-to-do area of Soho boasting several foreign diplomats as residents.\n\nSo what does this background tell us about Dulcibella’s ownership of the Jonson volume? The book was already old when she acquired it, almost 120 years old. A trimmed inscription about one-third of the way down on the engraved title page reads “Wm. An[…?]” or perhaps “Wm. Aw[…?].” We don’t know if it was given as a gift, taken from the family library, or if she acquired it secondhand. Either way, her ability to leisurely browse the book’s over 1000 pages was made possible by her station in life, which was directly supported by enslaved Africans.\n\nThe issue of Britain’s role in the Jamaican slave trade is not a thing of the past. In an essay for The Guardian in late March 2023, Jamaican journalist and activist Barbara Blake-Hannah tackled the question of how Britain—”a country whose role in the enslavement of millions of Africans over three centuries, and the subsequent monopoly of their ruling systems and economies, is the basis of its global strength and leadership”—should make amends to the country and the descendants of the people it so cruelly exploited. Ultimately, she finds the idea of cash reparations unrealistic. Instead, she proposes “the total relief of all Jamaica’s debt to the UK, plus the lifting of UK visa restrictions for Jamaican descendants of enslaved people, with unlimited access to the ’empire’s’ educational and economic opportunities, which were built on the labour of my enslaved ancestors.”\n\nIn the meantime, it would behoove white people to remember Trevor Burnard’s words:\n\nBlack people suffered greatly for white people’s enjoyment of sweet things.\n\nSource: Dulcibella Kent’s copy of Ben Jonson’s Workes was sold at auction by Swann Galleries in 2023.

In March 2020, Sarah Lindenbaum wrote about Blount’s acquisition of Edward Reynolds’s Treatise of the Passions and Faculties of the Soul of Man, a gift from Sir Thomas Pope-Blount on July 30, 1696.[1] Then in April 2022, Sophie Floate reported on Blount’s ownership signature in a book she purchased in 1706, a translation of Cyrano de Bergerac’s The Comical History of the States and Empires of the Worlds of the Moon and Sun (1687). And in mid-June of this year, William Poole was able to place another gift in Blount’s library, a 1699 copy of Samuel Garth’s Dispensary with a partial key in what appears to be Blount’s hand at the front of the book. The Dispensary was a gift from Henry Blount, a first cousin of Katherine’s husband, and Katherine Blount dated it May 27, 1699.\n\nNow Blount’s signed collection can be expanded by one more book, a rather surprising addition to her collection, Aphra Behn’s Miscellany. This, too, was a gift from Sir Thomas Pope Blount. What makes this gift even more interesting is that it was received, or at least dated, on the same day that she also received from Sir Thomas, or dated her copy, of Edward Reynold’s Treatise of the Passions and Faculties of the Soul of Man—July 30, 1696.\n\nThe recipient: Katherine Blount\n\nKatherine Butler Blount was born on April 8, 1676. Her father, James Butler, served in the House of Commons, and in the words of one of his compeers was “pernicious … in his principles, … rebellious in his practices.”[2] Butler died on July 11, 1696, seven months after Katherine’s marriage in late fall 1695 to Sir Thomas Pope Blount, later 2nd Bt.[3] At the time of his death, James Butler seemed to have been in some financial distress.[4] Katherine’s marriage likely brought her into a more compatible and financially stable family, one with a shared interest in books. Katherine and Sir Thomas had four sons and two daughters, two of whom died as infants.[5] The family resided primarily in Twickenham, but exactly where is not clear. Sir Thomas was related distantly to Alexander Pope, who also resided at Twickenham, and although Van Koughnet states that Katherine corresponded with the poet, there is no evidence of such to date.[6]\n\nAs Sarah Lindenbaum has already stressed, Van Koughnet’s description of Katherine Blount was glowing. Although Van Koughnet described Katherine Blount as “imperious,” she also used the terms “much respected,” and “a remarkable character amongst the ladies of this family.” In addition, Katherine was “a brilliant woman, full of cleverness and highly cultivated, fond of poetry, a lover of all that was refined and artistic, interesting herself in the passing world of her day, and gifted with a mind full of energy.”[7]\n\nKatherine was also noted as a collector, but there is no other reference to her books except that she left this collection, among other things, to her son, Sir Harry Pope Blount when she died on March 2, 1753.[8] Sir Harry always seemed to need money,[9] so it is likely that much of his mother’s collection was sold off after her death.\n\nThe donor: Sir Thomas Pope Blount\n\nKatherine signed two of her books, Behn’s Miscellany and Reynolds’s Treatise of the Passions as gifts of Sir Thomas Pope Blount. But which Thomas Pope Blount?\n\nThe Blount family traces its lineage to two brothers who arrived with William the Conqueror, and the name allegedly suggests that the Blount forefathers were fair-haired.[10] The insertion of the extra surname “Pope” derives from Sir Thomas Pope (c. 1507-1559), a courtier in the time of the Tudors who was especially renowned for his founding of Trinity College, Oxford.[11] The Pope family estate at Tyttenhanger devolved to the Blount family through the third wife of Sir Thomas Pope, and in his honor, the surname Pope was added by several Blounts in each generation, but it would appear especially by those in line for the estate.[12]\n\nSir Thomas Pope Blount, 1st Bt., was the elder son of Sir Nicholas Blount.[13] Sir Thomas’s younger brother Charles Blount was perhaps better known than his brother since he was a controversial freethinker with strong Whiggish tendencies,[14] yet the elder Sir Thomas published several studies of poetry. His De Re Poetica provides an extensive review of all forms of poetry from opera to lampoon and farce, followed by brief analyses of over sixty selected poets, ancient and modern, from Aeschylus to Katherine Philips, relying on his wide reading to represent the approaches of prior critics.\n\nAs happens in many families, the 1st Baronet named his first son after himself. This second Thomas Pope Blount, born on April 19, 1670, succeeded his father as the 2nd Baronet in 1697 although he did not follow his father into the House of Commons. He left little evidence of any activities. As Van Koughnet sums up his life, “there is nothing of his left that points to any talent or taste in particular.”[15] Perhaps one piece of evidence of good taste is his choice of a wife.\n\nNow that the two Sir Thomas Pope-Blounts are examined, the question is which one is the likely donor of the two books with their names attached. The stiffness and formality Katherine used when naming the gift-giver suggests that it might not be her husband. My guess then is that the donor is not Katherine’s husband, but rather her father-in-law, who was heavily involved in literary studies. But this is only a guess.\n\nThe date of the gift\n\nKatherine Blount dated the two books she received from Sir Thomas Pope Blount July 30, 1696. Is this any kind of special day? It is not her birthday or wedding anniversary or even name day. It is just over two weeks after her father’s death, so would that indicate some kind of consoling gift? Or is it just a day that Sir Thomas decided to give Katherine two (or more?) books?\n\nThe book itself\n\nIn addition to Katherine Blount’s signature, the volume carries evidence of later ownership, a bookplate of James Rimington. This is likely the James Rimington (1786-1839) of Yorkshire who received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from Trinity College, Cambridge.[16]\n\nBehn’s Miscellany is indeed a strange choice. Granted, the senior Sir Thomas does not mention Behn at all in his De Re Poetica, even as he talks about Edmund Waller, Abraham Cowley, John Dryden, and Katherine Philips in his survey of the moderns. Yet his attention to contemporary literature might have brought Behn to his attention.\n\nThe physical book itself, the artifact that once was in the possession of Katherine Blount, is in exceptionally good condition. It appears to be in its original calf binding, with a small red label on the spine with “Poetical Miscellany” in gold, perhaps added later. It is a standard octavo. There is a light vertical tear on Y8 in the outside margin with no loss to the text of François de la Rochefoucauld’s maxims. Rather than a tear made after the binding, the loss appears to be the result of a damaged sheet of paper, pre-print.\n\nMiscellany is Behn’s second collection of poems. Her first, Poems upon Several Occasions (1684) comprised her own work. In Miscellany, she mixes a dozen of her own poems with sixty-five by others in the first 299 pages, followed by her translations of the maxims of La Rochefoucauld as Seneca Unmasqued, Or, Moral Reflections for the French, filling pages 301-382. Whether the giver intended Katherine to read the collection of poems or the maxims in Behn’s translation—or both— is not certain.\n\nThere is one correction by hand, on p. 159 in the poem on the death of Hobbs where the printer’s eye skip repeating the end of a line word “invade” is revised to a more likely reading “persuade.” The ink and the hand are similar to changes made in other volumes of Behn’s works, but the sample is too small to presume that Katherine Blount made the change. The change could have been made in the print shop since we have seen print-shop revisions to errors in several of Behn’s printed works. However, there was another witness of this poem—a broadside published in 1679, An Elegie Upon Mr. Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury, Lately Deceased with the correct “invade/perswade” reading, and this could have been the source of the change, although it is impossible to know if this broadside was the source and if Katherine made the change.\n\nNo one now needs much discussion of the nature of Behn’s poems—pastoral, amorous, libertine, and witty. Behn seemed to be unabashedly of the court party with no Whiggish leanings, yet this is a gift to a newly married twenty-year-old whose new family were decidedly of the Whig party and named members of the Green-Ribbon Club.[17] The other book given on the same day is Reynolds’s philosophical study of human emotions and passions, what today we would term psychology. The two volumes make an interesting pairing as Behn examines aspects of love, hate, desire, and conscience through poetry and Reynolds examines aspects of human psychology, including love, hate, desire, and conscience within a decidedly religious context.\n\nFinally, the inscription, as can be seen, is positioned just above the middle of the free front end-paper. Katherine gives names and dates, following on Natalie Zemon Davis’s observation that books serve as “carriers of relationships.”[18] Georgianna Ziegler reviews the way women collectors locate and annotate their names, add the names of donors, give dates and often other historical information. These women were demonstrating pride of ownership. Katherine Blount was doing exactly that.\n\nSource: Book in private ownership. All photos by M. A.
