Regarded as the most powerful woman of her time in Europe, and often considered responsible for the St Bartholomews Day Massacre in 1572, when thousands of French Protestants (Huguenots) were killed.\n\nRedon  Odilon Redon (1840-1916) French Symbolist painter.\n\nPuvis de Chavannes  Pierre Puvis de Chavannes (1824-1898), a noted French painter. It is possible that Carter is referencing the painting Hope.\n\nMairie  Town Hall. The reference is to the magnificent Hôtel de Ville in Paris.\n\nPoiret  Paul Poiret (1879-1944), a leading French fashion designer.\n\nthe Directory  a collective leadership of five directors that governed France in the final phase of the French Revolution (1795-1799).\n\nWorth  Charles Frederick Worth (1825-1895), English-born fashion designer based in Paris.\n\nRomeo y Julieta  a style of Cuban cigar, and an oblique reference to another famous Liebestod.\n\nBechstein  a German piano of very high quality.\n\nSt Cecilia  Patroness of musicians, and therefore an appropriate gift for the narrator. According to her Life, she was struck three times by a sword upon the neck, lived for three days and then reposed.\n\nRops  Félicien Rops (1833-1898), Belgian artist, noted for his etchings. His subject matter frequently included images of sexuality, death and Satanism.\n\nHuysmans's Là-bas  Down there or The Damned, a novel by J. K. Huysmans (1848-1907) published in 1891. In it the hero becomes fascinated by the fifteenth century child murderer and serial killer Gilles de Rais and is thereby drawn into a circle of his contemporaries who worship Satan. The lectern, carved like a spread eagle on which the Marquis has placed this book deliberately resembles those used in churches: Là-bas is his gospel.\n\nEliphas Levy  Eliphas Levi, born Alphonse Louis Constant (1810-1875), a noted occultist. Of the books mentioned, only The Key of Mysteries is real.\n\nThe Adventures of Eulalie  invented by Carter. Possibly reminiscent of the The Lustful Turk, or Lascivious Scenes from a Harem, an erotic novel of 1828."
