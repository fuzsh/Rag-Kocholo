        "text": "Domesticity\n\nJoris-Karl Husymans\n\nTranslated by George MacLennan, with an introduction by Brian Banks\n\nHuysmans’ semi-autobiographical third novel, published in French in 1881, tells the tale of the novelist André Jayant and the artist Cyprien Tibaille: two men struggling between the urges of their body and the urges of their soul, and with the failure of matrimony or the artistic endeavor to fulfil the needs of either. Steeped in sardonic pessimism, this ode to sterility was one of the author’s own favorite novels of his career.\n\n***\n\nSmall Castles of Bohemia\n\nGérard de Nerval\n\nTranslated, with an introduction, by Napoleon Jeffries\n\nOne of Nerval’s last works: an assemblage of memoir, poetry, and theater he himself culled together from the vagabond fragments of his writing in an effort at posterity and mental stability toward the end of his life. Nerval’s “castles” trace out a thread from his early “Odellettes” to his forays into the theater to the hermetic sonnets with which he concluded his oeuvre.\n\n***\n\nThe Messengers\n\nGeorges-Olivier Châteaureynaud\n\nTranslated, with an introduction, by Edward Gauvin\n\nIn an unnamed country, in an unspecified time, a messenger and his young assistant pursue a dreamlike chain of clues and horror in order to deliver a message sealed in a tube. A Kafkaesque quest told through the lens of Alain-Fournier. One of Chateaureynaud’s earliest works, and winner of the 1974 prix des Nouvelles Littéraires.\n\nMore information\n\n***\n\nThe Tower of Love\n\nRachilde\n\nTranslated by Jennifer Higgins\n\nRachilde’s 1898 novel concerns a young sailor who is appointed as assistant keeper at a lighthouse off the Brittany coast. His complete isolation, shared with a disturbingly strange lighthouse keeper hiding all manner of dark secrets, opens up a nightmarish world of sexual abberation and hallucinatory morbidity.\n\nMore information\n\n***\n\nStapelia Mixta\n\nDr. Mises\n\nTranslated, with an introduction, by Erik Butler\n\nWhile Gustav Theodor Fechner was a professor of natural philosophy and anthropology and is remembered as the godfather of panpsychism and founder of psychophysics who would count William James and Sigmund Freud among his readers, his pseudonymous Dr. Mises engaged in more fantastical and imaginative thought exercises that would instead draw the interest of Alfred Jarry. Stapelia Mixta, first published in German in 1824 and never before translated, offers a series of increasingly inventive essays that start with a relatively digestible “Encomium of the Belly” and “The World Upside-Down” before developing into a complicated, pre-pataphysical exploration of Spatial Symbolism.\n\nMore information\n\n***\n\nUseless Writers\n\nErmanno Cavazzoni\n\nTranslated, with an introduction, by Jamie Richards\n\n49 fables composing a gallery of writers who contribute absolutely nothing to society, scientifically organized and categorized in accordance to the seven deadly sins and seven contingencies of life. From the scholar of eccentricity and author of Brief Lives of Idiots, Ermanno Cavazzoni.\n\n***\n\nFantastic Orgy\n\nAlexander M. Frey\n\nTranslated, with an introduction, by W. C. Bamberger\n\nFour tales from 1924 Weimar Berlin featuring an assortment of characters depicted with dry humor and macabre compassion. The title story features Phantomata, a female automaton (preceding Fritz Lang's Metropolis by several years), who chooses a paraplegic as a lover.\n\n***\n\nThe Hashish Films of Customs Officer Henri Rousseau and Tatyana Joukof Shuffles the Cards\n\n(A Novel against Psicho-Analise)\n\nEmil Szittya\n\nTranslated, with an introduction, by W. C. Bamberger\n\nAn early and obscure 1916 work by Emil Szittya, friend and colleague of Blaise Cendrars, the Zurich Dadaists, and many other protagonists of the European avant garde: synesthetic, episodic prose poems allegedly generated by hashish hallucinations.\n\n***\n\nWith Their Hearts in Their Boots\n\nJean-Pierre Martinet\n\nTranslated by Alex Andriesse\n\nGeorges Maman: a down-and-out actor sinking into despair and scraping by on work in the porno industry; Dagonard, a loudmouth camera assistant who doesn’t know when to shut up. Jean-Pierre Martinet’s last work relates a night in Paris shared by the two: a sordid, cynical, and disturbingly humorous descent into the hell of failure and the company we keep there.\n\nMore information\n\n***\n\nVacated Landscape\n\nJean Lahougue\n\nTranslated, with an afterword, by K. E. Gormley\n\nAn editor at a Parisian publishing house receives a pseudonymous manuscript that bears an eerie resemblance to his own life and the book he's been thinking of writing. His search for the author in a countryside village spins into an exuberantly byzantine narrative of long parenthetical and odd circumlocutions. This 1977 post-nouveau roman novel blends reality and fiction into an unsettling and ingeniously fractal Möbius strip.\n\nMore information\n\n***\n\nThe Water Spider and Other Tales\n\nMarcel Béalu\n\nTranslated, with an introduction, by Edward Gauvin\n\nOne of Béalu's most celebrated narratives, of a man and a water spider who fall in love, is accompanied by eighteen other tales of dreamy discomfort and charming immorality.\n\n***\n\nThe Drowned Land\n\nPaul Willems\n\nTranslated, with an introduction, by Edward Gauvin\n\nPublished two years before his death, The Drowned Land was one of Paul Willems’s more pessimistic explorations of the marvelous. In his account of the land of Aquélone, liquidity evolves into myth, and a paradise sinks into horror.\n\n***\n\nThe Employee\n\nJacques Sternberg\n\nTranslated, with an introduction, by Matt Seidel\n\nA nameless employee stands outside the door to his office, hesitating to enter because he is five minutes late. A banal opening that immediately launches into a frenetic narrative that gallops across genres, modes, and galaxies. A ferocious, entropic exercise of the imagination that will leave the reader breathless.\n\n***\n\nDiabelli\n\nHermann Burger\n\nTranslated, with an introduction, by Adrian Nathan West\n\nConfessional accounts of linguistic self-destruction: a magician preparing his final and permanent disappearing act, a would-be factotum applying for a post to which he is unsuited, a maniacal reader who is the alleged epicenter of an earthquake—disillusioned illusionists intent on unveiling life’s elegant deception."
