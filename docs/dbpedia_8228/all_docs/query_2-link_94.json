        "text": "After finalizing his college degree, Luc started his logistic career in the early ‘80s as a shipping clerk and developed his skills into project shipment and chartering for multiple breakbulk shipping lines. He remained active in the shipping industry until 1993 when he was invited to become director of a well-known forwarding company in Antwerp, founded in 1918 as a part of the VanUden Group in Rotterdam. After realizing a management buyout in 1993, Luc at the same time obtained the ownership of another Antwerp forwarding company with a 50 years logistic tradition in the local Antwerp market.\n\nFive years later, Luc and his partners created the Atlas International Network together with their life time mentor, Issa Baluch, former FIATA president and owner of Swift Freight in Dubai. Since 2013, Luc has taken full responsibility of the daily management of the Atlas International Network.\n\nLyanne started her Executive Management studies at Karel de Grote Hogeschool in Antwerp. Everything in the training revolved around organization and management. During the training, she developed an eye for profit, business processes and communication management in different languages.\n\nFor her senior year, Lyanne went to Valencia, Spain to finish the last year of her studies. All classes followed there, were taught in Spanish. This has allowed her to improve her Spanish skills significantly.\n\nAfter her studies, she first did an internship in a qualified hospital in Belgium, where she worked as a supervisor on the quality and accreditation department. There, she learned to manage and train teams in executing new procedures and applications.\n\nUpon joining the Atlas International Network, she developed her accounting knowledge further and besides business development, she is now also responsible for the accountancy. She is also engaged in event and project management and knows all the ins and outs.\n\nGeert was born in Belgium, and after starting his career as assistant-line manager and line manager for Intership Europe, he moved to Alexandria/Egypt as representative for the same shipping company. After 4 years of looking at the pyramids, Geert headed towards Dubai, where he set up the Asian agency network for a local NVOCC (North Africa Shipping Co) focused on business to Libya. After 3 years he joined Triangle Shipping (a division of Barwil) as branch manager.\n\nAnother 2 years later, Geert became business development manager for Barwil Vietnam. He fell in love with the country, and after a while started up his own freight forwarding company. Up to this moment, Geert is still residing in Vietnam. In 2015, he joined the Atlas International Network as VP Asia and operates out of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nDuring his studies already, Tomas started working in the logistics industry as a sales manager for a transport brokerage business. Later on, he moved to work for an asset-based transportation company. Eventually, he became Logistics leader for one of the biggest trading and manufacturing groups in Eastern Europe. He was responsible for supply chain strategy and execution covering all transportation means (Rail, Land, Sea, Air) in various regions (Baltics, Scandinavia, CIS). Serving at both ends for shippers and transportation companies allowed Tomas to better understand the supply chain and logistics management concept. After 13+ years of corporate life, Tomas decided to open his own company, which helps both logistics service providers and supply chain organizations to be more competitive in the market and implement the necessary changes. Tomas is a massive believer in digitization and process efficiency, as this is the key to success. Up to this moment, Tomas is still developing his business, and In 2021 complimentary joined the Atlas International Network as VP CIS and operates out of the Klaipeda, Lithuania.\n\nAfter my one-year education in New Zealand, I studied logistics management for 3 years at the Karel De Grote Hogeschool.\n\nAfter that, I started my logistic career at Atlantic Container Line. A specialized transatlantic carrier of containers, project and oversized cargo. In these 5 years, I have had the opportunity to discover all aspects and challenges of the import and export side. In 2017, I made the change to the Atlas International Network as Event & Business Coordinator.\n\nWorking together with members from all over the globe has been a wonderful experience. I have been fortunate to have met many of our members in person during our annual conferences.\n\nWhich I believe is one of the highlights of the Atlas International Network. I’m convinced that our team has the capability to strengthen en enlarge the Atlas International Network by constantly looking for better and new benefits for our members.\n\nMaria started her Economics studies at Alexandru I. Cuza University in Iasi, Romania. After 3 years, she developed an interest in sales and started her career in a small business as a Sales Representative. During her time there, she had the opportunity to discover all aspects of the sales market.\n\nIn 2022, Maria came to Belgium and after few months of language lessons, she became part of the Atlas International Network.\n\n‘’Atlas offered me the opportunity to develop my sales skills and to meet people from all over the world in person during the conferences, which makes me really thankful to be part of such a big family. I believe that together with our members, we can create a wonderful and strong future.’’"
