InterBasket > Player Profiles > Luis Scola, Argentina Ibn Notes: Luis Scola has had a busy 2007. Scola once again was the best forward in the Euroleague and was voted the 2007 ACB MVP. Scola led his Argentine National Team to a second-place finish in the 2007 Tournament of the Americas, thus insuring themselves a berth in the 2008 Olympics. And finally, Scola has joined his Argentinian teammates in the NBA.

Originally drafted by the San Antonio Spurs, Scola did not want to come to a team where he wouldn't be able to contribute immediately (and also take time away from fellow countryman Fabricio Oberto). So the Spurs agreed to send his rights to the Houston Rockets in exchange for the unhappy Vassilis Spanoulis (who went straight back to Greece), little-used Jackie Butler and a future first-round draft pick. Luis Scola will use his soft-hands, phyical body and international experience to fill the perpetual hole at power forward. With Yao Ming, Tracy McGrady and now Luis Scola, the Houston Rockets look to be serious contenders for the 2007-08 season.

Ibn Notes: Luis Scola is widely considered the best pro player not playing in the NBA. In 2004, he and his Argetine teammates Manu Ginobili, Fabricio Oberto, Pepe Sanchez, Andres Nocioni, and Walter Herrmann defeated Italy to win the Nation's first Olympic gold medal, Luis Scola scored 25 points and pulled down 11 rebounds in the final game... this was after Argentina won gold in the 2001 Tournament of the Americas and a silver medal at the World Championships in 2002. Luis was named the 1999-2000 Spanish League Rookie of the Year. He averaged nearly 16 points on 64.2-percent shooting this past season, while also grabbing 4.6 rebounds a game.
