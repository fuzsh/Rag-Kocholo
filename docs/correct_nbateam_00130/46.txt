HOUSTON (AP) - A person with knowledge of the deal says the Houston Rockets have agreed to terms with restricted free agent Luis Scola.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal was not official and the team had not announced it. Scola's agent, George Bass, did not immediately return a phone message.

The Houston Chronicle and KRIV-TV reported that Scola agreed to a five-year deal worth $47 million. Re-signing the 6-foot-9 Scola was Houston's top priority after the team matched Cleveland's offer sheet to retain point guard Kyle Lowry on Wednesday. Scola started all 82 games for the Rockets last season and averaged 16.2 points and 8.6 rebounds per game.
