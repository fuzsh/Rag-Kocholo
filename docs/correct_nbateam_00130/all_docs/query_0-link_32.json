        "text": "The Rockets have placed Luis Scola on the trade block. (Rocky Widner/Getty Images)\n\nAfter coming away with two big forwards in Thursday's NBA Draft, the Houston Rockets have placed forward Luis Scola on the trade block, ESPN's Marc Stein reported Saturday.\n\nScola joins guards Kyle Lowry and Kevin Martin — the Rockets' three leading scorers from last season — on the trade block. Stein reports there are no specific deals on the table. The Rockets are telling teams that Scola is available.\n\nThe Rockets made a pair of trades leading up to Thursday's draft, dealing swingman Chase Budinger and center Samuel Dalembert to add two picks in the team's first round. The Rockets are looking to stockpile assets for an eventual run at Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard. But last Sunday, NBA.com's David Aldridge reported that there was \"no chance\" Howard would stay in Houston past next season.\n\nThe Rockets took small forwards Royce White and Terrence Jones — along with guard Jeremy Lamb — in Thursday's draft."
