        "text": "Luis Scola has been waived by Nets\n\nLuis Scola has been waived by the Nets on Monday. Another player with an expiring contract on a team where a youth movement or rebuilding process has already begun. Scola will look to find a new team to close out the season but it's not guaranteed. Justin Hamilton will see more minutes with Scola gone.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nJustin Hamilton benefits the most with Scola gone and Quincy Acy also injured. Hamilton could be a solid speculative add with the Nets almost certainly shutting down Brook Lopez at some point.\n\nLuis Scola will start on Tuesday in place of Brook Lopez\n\nLuis Scola will start in place of Brook Lopez on Tuesday against the Raptors.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nScola is a risky daily play along with Anthony Bennett who will see additional minutes. It's a bump for the other starters including Jeremy Lin, Sean Kilpatrick, Trevor Booker and Bojan Bogdanovic.\n\nLuis Scola contributes 11 points\n\nScola came off the bench, and in 12 minutes of action, he scored 11 points with two assists. He also contributed three three-pointers.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nScola has averaged 13.0 minutes per game, and the 12 was just shy of his season average. He could be a valuable pickup if Booker goes down with an injury. At the moment, he's only useful as a DFS punt in the right situation.\n\nLuis Scola double doubles in blowout loss\n\nScola had an efficient 16 minutes of playing time. He double doubled with 15 points and 11 rebounds. He also contributed one assist and one three-pointer.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets got blown out in San Antonio so the bench got more run time in this game. Scola benefited the most with his double double. He's not worth a pickup and should remain in the waiver wire. He'll only be relevant if either Trevor Booker and/or Brook Lopez get injured or traded out of Brooklyn.\n\nLuis Scola doesn't play in Game 5 win\n\nLuis Scola didn't get on the court in the win over the Pacers.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nScola is an afterthought in the Raptors playoff plan and he is not worth a spot on your DFS roster."
