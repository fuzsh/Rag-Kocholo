        "text": "Luis Scola is a good man. A family man. Sometimes when you see him out on the court, you can just tell that guy definitely has four kids and cares about them. Luis and family have had to move around a bit over the course of his NBA career, and this time they ended up in Brooklyn. His family is very understanding.\n\nIn a recent article, the New York Times talked about moving to Brooklyn with him and some of his teammates. Some of it was what you would expect. It costs a lot of money, but professional basketball players make a lot of money. Whatever. But one thing stood out.\n\nLuis Scola has a minivan. He parks it in the street. Luis Scola has a minivan that he parks in the street in Brooklyn. Classic Scola.\n\nInconvenience aside, I can’t blame him for going with the minivan. Family road trips aren’t the same in anything else. Station wagons are long gone, and packing your kids into the back of an SUV feels more like being a chauffer.\n\nBut a minivan just feels right. Like, you pack up some V8’s, a TV, and a VHS of Family Guy reruns, and you just hit the road. You’re driving along, the leaves are changing color because they do that sometimes. Everyone is making memories they’ll have to try to forget.\n\n“Hey kids, there’s an Arby’s up ahead. Are you hungry?”\n\n“We’ve already eaten Arby’s twice today, dad. Can’t we go somewhere else?”\n\n“Don’t be difficult, Coheed. They never take the coupons. You can keep using them over and over again. If you go enough, it’s basically free beef.”\n\n“Dad, I don’t like roast beef as much as you do. No one does.”\n\n“We’ve talked about this, Cambria. They have more than just roast beef. You know the slogan, right? We have the meat!”\n\n“It all tastes like a shoe. Mom says we can only have Arby’s twice this weekend.”\n\n“Your mom gives me one weekend a year, and if that’s all I get, then I’m making the rules. Speaking of your mom, what do you think of Todd? Have you met him yet?”\n\nKids are the best. Anyway, here’s hoping he finds that perfect spot tonight. And the next night. And every other night of this year’s contract. $5.5 million can’t buy time back.\n\nMore from The Friendly Bounce\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
