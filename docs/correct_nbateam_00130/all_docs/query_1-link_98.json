        "text": "BUENOS AIRES - The Argentine basketball player Luis Scola on Monday said he is \"very nervous\" due to the ongoing lack of clarity surrounding a conflict in the US National Basketball Association (NBA) conflict which has caused him not to play.\n\nScola, 31, a power forward player of the NBA Houston Rockets, said he would not rule out the possibility of playing for an Argentine team until the lockout set by the NBA is resolved but agreed it would be unlikely as he would \"run into an insurance problem.\"\n\n\"It is a complicated period. At first, it seemed almost fun, but now I am becoming very nervous and I want the conflict to be solved,\" he said about the conflict in the main basketball league in the world.\n\nScola also said he had not put any date as to when he will define what to do about his future and pointed out that he \"likes to play in the NBA\" Ã‚ but that he cannot \"be months without playing basketball.\"\n\n\"I need to be in shape and competing. I don't feel like going to the other side, make my family adapt to another country, adapt myself to other rules, another coach. I am not used to it,\" said the former partner of the Chinese player Yao Ming in the Houston Rockets."
