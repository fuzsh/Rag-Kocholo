The 7'4\" giant paired with Hakeem Olajuwon to form the \"Twin Towers,\" an imposing duo that powered the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1986. Sampson's versatility allowed him to play both power forward and center, using his size, shot-blocking prowess, and rebounding skills to dominate the competition. As a three-time All-Star and a member of the NBA's All-Rookie team, he will forever be remembered as a Rockets great.\n\nBirthplace : Leeds, Alabama, USA\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Phoenix Suns, Houston Rockets, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nHouston Rockets: 1996–2000\n\nA tenacious force on the boards, Charles Barkley joined the Houston Rockets in 1996 after being traded from the Phoenix Suns, to play alongside Hakeem Olajuwon. In his time with the Rockets, Barkley utilized his unique blend of size, strength, and agility to wreak havoc on both ends of the floor, garnering All-Star honors in his first season with the team. Sir Charles was a major catalyst during their playoff runs, however, he couldn't bring another championship to Houston during his tenure, but his contributions on the court undoubtedly make him one of the best power forwards in Rockets' history.\n\nBirthplace : Rayville, Louisiana\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nHouston Rockets: 1968–1972, 1981–1984\n\nDrafted first overall by the San Diego Rockets in 1968, Elvin Hayes became an instant star with his powerful scoring and relentless rebounding abilities. The \"Big E\" led the Rockets to their first-ever playoff appearance and earned All-NBA First Team recognition during his rookie season. Throughout his two stints with the Rockets, Hayes displayed remarkable consistency, durability, and effectiveness, making him a 12-time All-Star and an NBA champion. His exceptional contributions to the franchise warrant his place among Houston's all-time great power forwards.\n\nBirthplace : Boynton Beach, Florida\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nHouston Rockets: 1988–1995\n\nAcquired by the Rockets through a trade with the Sacramento Kings in 1988, Otis Thorpe proved to be a critical piece of their championship puzzle. A bruising power forward with a soft touch around the rim, Thorpe provided a dependable scoring option alongside Hakeem Olajuwon and showed immense prowess as a rebounder. Instrumental in Houston's 1994 NBA Championship win, Thorpe garnered a well-deserved All-Star appearance during his tenure with the Rockets. His vital contributions to the team's success solidify his position among the franchise's best power forwards.\n\nBirthplace : Maryland, USA\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Small forward, Power forward\n\nHouston Rockets: 1992–1996\n\nNicknamed \"Big Shot Bob,\" Robert Horry played an integral role in the Houston Rockets' back-to-back championships in 1994 and 1995. Acquired in the 1992 NBA draft, Horry quickly developed into a clutch performer, earning a reputation for knocking down big shots in high-pressure situations. His defensive versatility, shot-blocking ability and three-point prowess made him a perfect fit for the Rockets' style of play. As a key contributor to two championship squads, Horry undoubtedly ranks among the best power forwards in Houston's history.\n\nBirthplace : Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nNationality : Argentina\n\nTeam : San Antonio Spurs\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nHouston Rockets: 2007–2012\n\nHailing from Argentina, Luis Scola was acquired by the Houston Rockets in 2007 in a trade with the San Antonio Spurs and quickly carved out a niche as a hard-nosed, intelligent player. Scola's craftiness in the post, rebounding tenacity, and reliable mid-range jumper made him a fan favorite in Houston. Though he never won any major awards during his time with the Rockets, Scola's hustle, grit, and passion were undeniable, making him one of the most admirable and respected power forwards to don a Rockets jersey."
