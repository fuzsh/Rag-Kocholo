        "text": "Every night there are some stupendous, silly, stupid, or downright outlandish individual lines from around the \"lig.\" Doing Lines lets you know which one tops the list.\n\nThe Rockets have the (gulp) No. 2 seed in the West right now, thanks to Luis Scola. The monster outplayed Tim Duncan (!) on Sunday, turning out 19 points, 17 rebounds, four assists and three steals. Scola's defense (with help from the overall outstanding Houston barricade) limited Big Fundamental to 8-of-22 shooting and just six rebounds.\n\nSports\n\nIn partnership with NBC Sports Philadelphia\n\nAmazingly, Fabricio Oberto played exactly one second in this game -- at the end of the first half. That appearance is really going to bring down his per-game numbers.\n\nPromote Him to AI1!:Andre Iguodala keeps banging for Philadelphia, racking up 27 points (on 14 FGAs), seven rebounds, three assists, two steals and a block. Seventeen of those points came in the first quarter; 'Dala hit his first 10 FGAs before missing four to end the game. Of course, the game wasn't in doubt from roughly the five-minute mark in the first. Thanks to Iguodala. And the fact this all happened in Sacramento.\n\nSpencer Hawes finished with 17 points, 11 rebounds, and ... nine assists. Hawes had two shots at the triple-double in the closing minutes, but Francisco Garcia bricked a long three (after hitting six of nine from long-range to that point) and Rashad McCants missed a bunny. (Insert sad face.)\n\nDoing Lines: Luis Scola, Rockets Have Big Fun Against Spurs originally appeared on NBA FanHouse on Mon, 23 Mar 2009 11:15:00 EST . Please see our terms for use of feeds."
