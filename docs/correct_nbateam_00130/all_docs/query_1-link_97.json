        "text": "LAS VEGAS — During a press conference at UNLV to announce the junior NBA program coming to Argentina, Luis Scola was handed a black Nets jersey. The face of the 36-year-old forward lit up.\n\n“I haven’t seen one of these yet,” Scola said.\n\nIndeed, Scola missed Wednesday’s press conference in Brooklyn to announce the Nets’ free-agent signings. Scola, who signed a one-year deal with the Nets on July 12, is in town training with Argentina’s Olympic team, which will face Team USA on Friday in an exhibition game at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nPlaying in his fourth Olympics, Scola will receive the honor of carrying Argentina’s flag during the opening ceremonies in Rio — which he called “a wild dream.’’ But Brooklyn is in his thoughts.\n\nThe smooth-shooting nine-year veteran will sneak into New York next week before Argentina heads to Rio. He is trying to land an apartment in Brooklyn, where the Nets have opened their state-of-the-art waterfront training facility.\n\n“I feel like everything changed about the Nets when they moved to Brooklyn versus New Jersey,’’ Scola told The Post. “It feels like another franchise. We need to get success. When the team starts getting success, it will be one of the players’ favorite places to play.”\n\nLeaving the Raptors, last season’s No. 2 seed in the East, for Brooklyn took some soul searching.\n\n“I think New York is one of the best cities in the world — a lot of people question New York. They love to visit but not to live,” Scola said. “I’m excited. I like to live there, too, but I don’t like the renting prices.”\n\nWith the Nets leaving their Jersey practice haunt last winter, Scola has no choice on where to settle.\n\n“It has to be in Brooklyn,” Scola said. “How far can you go with the challenge of traffic? It’s a good opportunity for me and my family to live in the middle of the city, doing city life, walking to places, taking buses, riding a bike. Just forget about the car and suburban life and 40-minute drive. It’s going to be fun.”\n\nScola admitted he had some concerns, at his age, in joining a rebuilding club, but he liked what he heard from new coach Kenny Atkinson in their meeting.\n\n“I thought it was a good option,” Scola said. “They’re really trying to develop a good future with a lot of young players and they felt they needed balance. They thought I could help. I thought I could help. At first, they didn’t win a lot of games last year — I was like maybe not a good feeling. But I started talking and looking from another perspective.”\n\nAtkinson was a developmental coach for the Rockets when the well-traveled Scola was with Houston.\n\n“He’s great, a workout/developmental guy. We worked a lot of hours,’’ Scola said. “I had a lot of fun working with him. He’s a good coach and good person and am happy to play for him.”\n\nAt Wednesday’s press conference, Atkinson said of Scola: “I was with him in Houston, so I know him really well. Again, incredible system fit. He fits the way we want to play. He’ll provide great leadership.”\n\nScola wouldn’t give his small Nets jersey back to the PR official.\n\n“I’m keeping it,’’ he said. “I stole it. I hide it. This is for my son.”\n\nAs for the other team in town, Scola said of the Knicks: “They look better. They got talent. We don’t know how they’ll play. When you got talent, good things happen.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Brian Lewis"
