        "text": "Luis Scola is a Varese basketball player, as officially communicated by the team. The Argentine has signed a 1 + 1 contract with the red and white team that will allow him to choose, after this season, whether to play another year or to retire after the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nLooking for a team with only one weekly commitment, near Milan where he lives with his family and that would allow him to keep the pace in preparation for the great goal of the fifth Olympics are factors that then convinced him to sign with the Varese team.\n\nLuis Scola’s signature for Varese Basketball is yet another demonstration of a completely surprising market session for Coach Caja’s team."
