        "text": "Another day passed by, which meant another day of having to deal with Dwightmare. Orlando’s new general manager Rob Hennigan apparently thought there was a chance to convince the malcontent center to stay home. See how Howard responded, and how far the Houston Rockets are willing to go to acquire him in today’s news:\n\nRob Hennigan tried to talk Dwight Howard into changing his mind about wanting to be traded from the Magic, but Howard would have none of it, from Ric Bucher: “After several months of trying to trade Dwight Howard, Orlando Magic general manager Rob Hennigan called the All-Star center Wednesday night to see if he’d reconsider giving Hennigan and the Magic’s new regime a chance to keep Howard in Orlando, a source close to Howard said… Hennigan, the source said, based his plea on the fact that he was new to the organization and had not been party to the issues that drove Howard to make his trade request. Team president Alex Martins, who also was on the call, the source said, made a similar plea to Howard last winter when Martins took control of basketball decisions over GM Otis Smith and coach Stan Van Gundy. Howard was not willing to change his stance, the source said. “I already heard that from the other guy on the phone,” said Howard, according to the source.”\n\nOur Chris Sheridan chimed in on what may be next for the Magic and Howard: “The Orlando Magic want Dwight Howard to reconsider if he’d like to play for them next season. But Howard’s mind has been made up for a long time — and he wants out of central Florida. So what happens next? Presumably, Howard will come up with a second list of teams that he would be amenable to playing for long-term. It has long been known that the Mavericks, Lakers and Clippers were on Howard’s B-list.”\n\nThe Houston Rockets will go to extreme measures for a chance to acquire Dwight Howard, according to Adrian Wojnarowski: “Houston has decided to use the amnesty provision on Luis Scola and will likely file with NBA on Friday, league sources tell Y! Sports. Scola has three years and $21 million left on his contract. The Rockets are clearing space in pursuit of a Dwight Howard deal. The Rockets will soon have the space to absorb Orlando’s Dwight Howard, Jason Richardson, Hedo Turkoglu, Chris Duhon and Epcot Center.”\n\nBlake Griffin was reportedly injured during scrimmage on Wednesday, from Sheridan: “Blake Griffin experienced “discomfort” and “swelling” in his left knee after going through Team USA practice, and he will miss the national team’s first exhibition game tonight against the Dominican Republic. No. 1 overall draft pick Anthony Davis will be rejoining the team tonight, and he will be in uniform against the Dominicans. Jeff Zilgitt of USA Today reported that Davis may actually start for the Americans. Griffin, meanwhile, flew to Los Angeles for an MRI. The knee is the same one he injured during the NBA playoffs.”\n\nUPDATE: Blake Griffin will have an arthroscopic surgery due to a meniscus tear, according to Broderick Turner: “Blake Griffin has been diagnosed with a meniscus tear in his left knee and will have arthroscopic surgery probably early next week, according to NBA executives who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Griffin will not be playing for the USA Olympic team in London later this month, but he will be available for Clippers training camp that starts in October. Griffin is expected to be out about eight weeks recovering from the injury and should be fine and ready to play when the season starts, the executive said. Dr. Neal ElAttrache of the Kerlan–Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic will perform the surgery.”\n\nAntawn Jamison may end up with a new team soon, and it could be the New Jersey Nets, according to Marc. J. Spears: “Cavs have had talks on possible sign&trade sending Antawn Jamison to Nets,sources tell Y! Lakers can only offer minimum. GS & CHA in mix too.”\n\nElton Brand was officially amnestied by the 76ers today, from John Mitchell: “The Sixers made it official today, finalizing the paperwork required to officially use the amnesty clause on forward Elton Brand. “On behalf of the Philadelphia 76ers, I want to thank Elton for his contributions to our organization and city,” said Sixers President of Basketball Operations Rod Thorn in a statement. “Decisions of this nature are never easy, particularly when it involves a player of Elton’s talent and character. He worked tirelessly for the overall good of the team every time he put on a Sixers uniform and we wish him nothing but the best.”\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks will strongly pursue Brand, according to ESPN Dallas: “The Dallas Mavericks will make a “very aggressive bid” for Elton Brand in the amnesty waiver process, a source close to the situation told ESPNDallas.com’s Jeff Caplan on Wednesday. The Philadelphia 76ers have used their amnesty clause on the 6-foot-8 Brand, making him eligible for teams under the salary cap to put in bids. Whichever team places the winning bid will earn Brand’s services and will pay that amount off the $18.2 million he’s owed next season, the final year of his contract.”\n\nChris Kaman, who had our Tweet of the Night, believes he and Dirk Nowitzki will complement each other nicely, from Jeff Caplan: “The once stringy-haired Kaman who now prefers a close trim said he thinks he and Nowitzki will complement each other well. “He’s more outside first and then inside second and I think the team has always spaced the floor and kind of stretched it a little because there’s probably been a little bit of lack of scoring inside,” Kaman said. “I’m excited to see what coach (Rick) Carlisle has to put up in there. I know in the past he’s had teams with good post players. I know he’s a good coach, I know he knows what he’s doing and I’m just excited to see what happens next with the team. It’s a different team than they’ve had the last few years just with no Jason Kidd, no Jason Terry, so it will be interesting to see how it goes.”\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves will sign Nicolas Batum to an offer sheet as promised, from Jerry Zgoda: “Two days after the NBA free-agency signing period began, the Wolves are signing Nicolas Batum to that big offer sheet today and when done, Portland will have three days to match. Wolves owner Glen Taylor said the team will submit the signed $46.5 million offer sheet to the NBA by the end of business today, a distinction that gives the Blazers one last chance to agree to a sign-and-trade. The Wolves are willing to offer draft picks, but aren’t giving up Derrick Williams or Nikola Pekovic. Taylor said he believes the Blazers have seen the offer sheet. “You call their bluff,” he said. Once submitted, you can bet two things: The Blazers will match and they’ll take probably nearly all 72 hours to do it.”\n\nMinnesota parted ways with “Mana from heaven”, and is expected to buyout a couple of other contracts. More from Zgoda: “To make salary-cap room, the Wolves did waive Darko Milicic, ending the Manna from Heaven era by agreeing to pay him $7 million of the remaining $10 million-plus left for the last two years on the contract he signed in July 2010. Expect buyouts on Martell Webster and Brad Miller for the remaining year on each contract to come as well.”\n\nThe New York Knicks formally introduced veterans Jason Kidd and Marcus Camby on Thursday, from Ian Begley: “Kidd, an 18-year veteran, said he’s “excited” to serve as a mentor to the 23-year-old Lin. Kidd was introduced on Thursday at the Knicks’ practice facility along with veteran center Marcus Camby… Grunwald praised both Kidd and Camby, saying the veteran duo brings “experience” and “wisdom” to the Knicks, who lost in five games to the Heat in the first round of last year’s playoffs. “Marcus is a great leader and is still a great shot blocker, and Jason is still a great point guard,” Grunwald said. “… We’re trying to put together a team that can compete and I think these two guys are going to be a big part of it.”\n\nKidd looked like himself, but Camby appeared to have gained some weight.\n\nKendrick Perkins underwent successful surgery, according to Royce Young: “The Thunder have announced Kendrick Perkins has undergone a successful procedure on his right groin. He can resume activities in 4-6 weeks.”\n\nThe Charlotte Bobcats let D.J Augustin become a free agent today, from Rick Bonnell: “No more sign-and-trade speculation. As I predicted in this morning’s Observer,‪#Bobcats‬ rescind Augustin qualifying offer.”\n\nD.J. Augustin has agreed to a deal with the Indiana Pacers, from Mike Wells: “Pacers have agreed to a 1 year deal with DJ Augustin, according to a source. President Donnie Walsh and GM Kevin Pritchard deserve credit for jumping on Augustin as soon as they could knowing they needed another PG.”\n\nThe Bobcats are on the verge of acquiring Ramon Sessions, from Marc J. Spears: “Bobcats are finalizing a deal to sign Lakers free agent guard Ramon Sessions, sources tell Yahoo! Sports.”\n\nWe may finally see the return of Greg Oden in the NBA, according to Chris Tomasson: “Injury-riddled Greg Oden could be returning to the NBA this season. That’s the word from Oden’s agent, Mike Conley, who got a call earlier this week from Oden. He said his client has changed his tune from wanting to take this season off. “(Oden) called me, and he was kind of excited,’’ Conley said Thursday in a phone interview with FOX Sports Florida. “I think he’s motivated …. He wants to play. He had said he wanted to take this season off, but he’s backed off from that …. He’s open to playing this season. I think he will play this season.’’\n\nMike Woodson reiterated what he stated throughout last season: Jeremy Lin is his starting point guard, from Marc Berman: “I won’t do that,’’ Woodson said of benching Lin. “You can’t lose your starting job based on injuries. Jeremy was our starter before he got hurt. Unfortunately he went down with an injury. He’s not going to be punished for that. He’s got work to do this summer. But when he comes back to veterans camp, he’ll have the first nod. He’ll be our starter and Jason will back him up in terms of helping developing this young man into a great point guard.”\n\nStephen Curry’s ankle is nearly healed, according to Marcus Thompson: “Warriors point guard Stephen Curry said his surgically repaired right ankle is at “about 85 to 90 percent.” He said he is expecting to be 100 percent by training camp. Curry had arthroscopic surgery on his right ankle on April 25, performed by Dr. Richard Ferkel inSouthern California. The surgery revealed Curry’s ankle, which caused him to miss 40 games last season, had no structural damage. Dr. Ferkel cleaned out scar tissue and a few bone spurs.”\n\nChris Forsberg wisely explains why Celtics fans should get over losing Ray Allen to the Heat: “Listen, divorce is never easy. The Celtics are Mom, Allen is Dad, and fans are the confused kids stuck in the middle of it all. We’re angry that Dad could just up and leave like that. Now he’s dating some (admittedly attractive) floozy who’s half his age and there are pictures of them all over Facebook canoodling in South Florida. But relationships are hard and most don’t last forever, particularly not in sports. Allen and the Celtics had run their course. The sparks weren’t there anymore like they were when the two sides first fell in love in the summer of 2007. Five years later, they would have stayed together only because it was convenient. Allen made a bold decision, but both sides will be happier in the long run, even if that’s hard for some to see at the moment.”\n\nKobe Bryant, who got some heat from Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan for his comments about the Dream Team, chimed in on Andrew Bynum and DeMarcus Cousins. Kurt Helin has the story: ““Yea, yea. He’s got kind of this f— it attitude, you know what I mean,” Kobe said (and yes, we do). “Which is great, it’s one of the things that makes him a great player. It won’t bother him at all…. Andrew is a big boy, he can handle it better than most.” What about USA Select Team big man Cousins, who has raised some eyebrows — not always in a good way — with his play? “All he has to do is continue to work, continue to keep his level head. That’s all he has to do. That’s all he has to do,” Kobe repeated for emphasis. “If he can do that and can let his basketball talent speak for itself, he’ll be fine. He gets in trouble when he starts letting his emotions get the best of him, now people start talking about that as opposed to his game.”\n\nShaquille O’Neal apparently wants to have his own =3 show (Ray William Johnson’s show on youtube) and will get it: “TruTV has greenlighted Upload with Shaquille O’Neal, a series centered on the former basketball star scouring the Internet in search of the funniest online videos to comment on as well as creating his own viral videos and parodies. He will be joined on-screen by host Gary Owen (Think Life a Man) and Godfrey (The Mr. Men Show).”\n\nEnjoy this insane clip of Shaquille Johnson’s senior year highlights. All he does is stare at the rim.\n\nCharles Barkley and Michael Jordan laughs at Kobe Bryant’s comment\n\nLeBron James and Jeremy Lin big winners at ESPY Awards\n\nFollow @NBATupark"
