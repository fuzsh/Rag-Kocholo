        "text": "As such, Scola is taking three-pointers this year. Over the first eight years of his career, Scola averaged 0.1 three-point attempts per 36 minutes, peaking with 0.4 last year. This year, that number has inflated to 1.8. It is still just about one long-range heave per game for Scola, but for a player that has never attempted more than 20 in any single season, that is a massive bump. Oh yeah — he has knocked in half of his attempts. “The NBA is moving in that direction,” Scola said. “We all know how effective the three-point shot is in the basketball game today. I’m trying to adapt. That’s the way teams are playing.\n\nWhat was it about Shane that made him a great teammate? Luis Scola: He was always playing attention to details, thinking ‘How can I help the other teammates?’ He was always talking. He was a great professional. He worked hard. He was all about the right things.\n\nDoes knowing you’re closer to the end of the career change how you look at the game at all? LS: It does. I think playing 20 years is something. You kind of go through different mental moods and mental states. Sometimes you think one thing and then you start changing because you grow, you mature. You grow, you think, you see things different. When you have kids you see things different. When you move to a different city you see things different. Every time something happens, you adjust and learn and it changes your perspective of things. Obviously, along the years, it’s changed the way I feel about basketball. NBA, national team and all of those things, and yeah, going towards the end, it makes you think a lot of things and those thoughts sometimes make you change your way of looking at things.\n\nNow in Toronto in the early stages of training camp, he likes the way things are headed. “I have a good feeling about this year,” he said. “ It’s a good opportunity for me. It’s a good situation and I think I can help the team. They made me feel like I would be helping the team. They made me feel wanted.”"
