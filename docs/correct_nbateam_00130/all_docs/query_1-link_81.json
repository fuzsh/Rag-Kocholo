        "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Houston Rockets have an important stretch of the season underway. They will be without former three-time Defensive Player of the Year Dwight Howard for the next four weeks or so due to a knee injury, yet the NBA schedule continues. That's where the power forwards come in.\n\nIn the month of February, the Rockets play against teams who are all currently in the playoffs except for two, and one of them (the Brooklyn Nets) is only a game out. The schedule is unforgiving, and the brutal race out West only makes matters worse. Houston is currently the three seed, but fourth, fifth, sixth and even seventh are not far behind.\n\nThe next four weeks will be crucial to the Rockets' season. Playoff positioning is crucial, especially with teams like the San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder looming near the bottom as dangerous traps. Houston will try to hold on to its coveted top-four spot, but it won't be easy.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nThe good news is, James Harden is still leading the way. The back-to-back Western Conference Player of the Month is having an MVP season and has led the Rockets to a 13-5 record sans Dwight already this year. The Beard is going to have to continue his brilliant play, but he can't do it all by himself.\n\nFor the rest of the season, particularly while Dwight is out, the Rockets' play at power forward is going to be critical.\n\nThe only bright side to Howard's injury is it could not have come at a better time, from a power forward perspective, that is. Donatas Motiejunas is having a breakout year, Josh Smith signed on midseason as a free agent and Terrence Jones has returned from injury after missing 41 games. Right as Dwight went down, Kevin McHale got a plethora of big men at his disposal to use in his rotation.\n\nIronically, power forward has been the biggest question mark in the Rockets' starting lineup for a long time in Houston. Ever since Luis Scola was amnestied, the Rockets have cycled in a handful of guys that never locked up the spot. Now, Houston has three legitimate 4s that could fill in at the starting role, but they have to split the time up accordingly.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nLet's start with D-Mo, the current starter. Motiejunas has skyrocketed on the scene as a key player and is arguably the second-best scorer on the team. He is averaging 12.5 points and 6.3 boards as a starter, shooting 52.6 percent from the floor.\n\nWith Dwight out, D-Mo has been posting career highs on a nightly basis. His post moves are among the best in the league, consistently breaking down some of the premier post defenders. But it's not just offense for D-Mo, like some would think. He's also a quality defender down low, near the top of the NBA in rim protection.\n\nThe best part about his game is he is always hustling, doing the little things it takes to win, and he's a big reason why the Rockets have succeeded after losing someone as talented as Howard for extended time.\n\nWhether he's at power forward or center, McHale absolutely must keep D-Mo as a mainstay in the rotation. His contributions on both ends of the floor are vital to the team, particularly while Dwight is injured. The Rockets like to play with a small-ball lineup from time to time and that's perfectly fine, but D-Mo has got to be the featured scorer once opposing defenses force Harden to give up the ball, which they frequently do.\n\nWhile many did not think Josh Smith would be a good fit with Houston, the former Detroit Piston is starting to figure it out with the Rockets. He's averaging 10.7 points and 6.0 rebounds since joining the team the day after Christmas, but his numbers have consistently gone up.\n\nBill Baptist/Getty Images\n\nSince his move to the bench, the 6'9\" forward is shooting 45.5 percent from the floor, opposed to his 38.4 percent as a starter. Don't hold your breath, but in the brief time we've had in February, Smoove is shooting 55.6 percent from deep! He's finding his spots in the Rockets' system, which explains the more consistent, positive outputs.\n\nWhen Smith comes into the game, along with the rest of the headband brigade (Corey Brewer and Jason Terry), the tempo immediately picks up. Even if he's been labeled as a team cancer in the past, there's no doubt this guy has serious talent.\n\nNot many big men can grab the rebound, dribble the ball down the floor and run the fast break to perfection. That's a big luxury for Houston, and it's a reason why the bench is able to break games open against other second units. Depth was once the Rockets' biggest weaknesses only a couple of months ago, but now it's a tremendous strength.\n\nSmoove can do a little bit of everything. He can score the rock, or he can dish it out. He is a very underrated passer for a big man. Smith is also a good asset defensively. With his athleticism, he can guard bigger guys in the post but can also switch on to guards at the perimeter on picks. He also has a knack for coming up with emphatic blocks.\n\nSmith's future with the team is unclear, but it is clear he is an important part of the lineup. Even though he doesn't start, his impact off the bench is crucial. Oftentimes, Smith will play down the stretch of close games, which means McHale has a lot of faith in him.\n\nThe Rockets were without Jones for the majority of the season. He went from being the starter to practically forgotten, only because D-Mo and Smoove have played so well. With mysterious nerve inflammation in his leg, it was unclear for a long time when Jones would be able to return. Well now he's back, and slowly but surely he's getting back in the mix of things.\n\nBill Baptist/Getty Images\n\nSince returning late in January, Jones is averaging 6.8 points and 3.0 rebounds in his five appearances. He only plays about 19 minutes a night, and you can tell he has to readjust to the pace of NBA gameplay. It's not easy for someone to miss half a season and then jump right back into the fire, but Jones has done a decent job at sliding back into the rotation.\n\nHe still has a long way to go, but getting Jones back on the floor is a huge bonus for Houston. He is an extra big body who can block shots and run the floor. As he continues to acclimate himself back in the rotation, his minutes will increase and his numbers will rise as a result.\n\nHaving too many players to divvy up the minutes is a good problem to have for coach McHale. Once a weakness, the Rockets' depth at the 4 is now among the best in the league. If the coaching staff can capitalize on the team's size, athleticism and flexibility, then Houston can make a serious run in the playoffs."
