        "text": "Larry Bird has been aggressive trying to upgrade the Indiana Pacers’ bench via free agency after he returned as team president earlier this summer. But nothing Bird and his staff did during the past few weeks will likely have the impact of a trade they pulled off with the Phoenix Suns on Saturday.\n\nThe Pacers acquired center/forward Luis Scola in exchange for forwards Gerald Green and Miles Plumlee and a future first-round draft pick. The pick will be in next year’s draft unless the Pacers qualify for the draft lottery — something that would come as a major disappointment for a team that believes it can contend for an NBA title.\n\n“I’m very, very excited to play for the Pacers,” Scola, 33, said in a statement released by the team. “They are one of the top three teams in the NBA with a good shot to win a championship. I think it’s a great team and this is a great opportunity. I can’t wait.”\n\nMORE:Twitter reaction to Indiana Pacers' acquisition of Luis Scola\n\nThe 6-9, 245-pound Scola averaged 12.8 points and 6.6 rebounds for the Suns last year, his only season in Phoenix. His first five NBA seasons were with the Houston Rockets. Scola has averaged 14.2 points and 7.5 rebounds for his career.\n\nHe’s also a longtime member of the Argentina national team, helping it to a gold medal at the 2004 Olympics and a silver medal in the 2002 world championships that were played at Conseco Fieldhouse (now Bankers Life Fieldhouse).\n\n“Larry has long admired Scola’s ability to rebound and score the ball,” Pacers general manager Kevin Pritchard said. “We watched him last year with Phoenix. We always felt he would be a perfect person for us in terms of backing up (David) West and backing up (Roy) Hibbert, being part of our second unit and being a scorer on that unit.”\n\nIt’s another sign that the Pacers are going all-out in pursuit of a NBA championship after losing to eventual champion Miami in seven games in the Eastern Conference finals. Pritchard said the Pacers can envision Scola teaming with Ian Mahinmi, who is stronger defensively, up front when they want to rest West and Hibbert and form a high-low combination.\n\n“Everywhere he’s been, people have raved about him,” Pritchard said. “He’s such a good teammate. And we really respect what he’s done on the international level, too.”\n\nScola started 67 games last year in Phoenix, but he’s expected to come off the bench almost exclusively for the Pacers. Phoenix signed him as a free agent last summer when Houston designated him as its amnesty player, but he was available because the Suns are in full rebuilding mode after going 25-57 and hiring a rookie coach in Jeff Hornacek and a rookie general manager in Ryan McDonough.\n\nThey are looking to get younger and when the Pacers agreed to include Plumlee —their first-round pick in last year’s draft — the two teams were able to make a deal. Still, it appears the Pacers were able to make a significant move without giving up a player that figured to be a major contributor next season.\n\n\"Our number one goal of the summer was to address our bench,” Pritchard said. “With C.J. (Watson), (Chris) Copeland, Scola and our draft picks (Solomon Hill) we feel like really helped our team off the bench.”\n\nPritchard said he doesn’t expect the Pacers will make another move in the near future, but added “we are always open for business.”\n\nHe was asked if not including Danny Granger in the deal was a sign the Pacers were confident Granger would be ready for next season. The former all-star forward missed all but five games last season because of a knee injury. Granger would certainly be an asset if healthy, but also is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent after next season.\n\n“We feel great about where Danny is with his health and his readiness for camp,” Pritchard said. “We’re trying to be one of the top teams in the East. We want to see where this team is when it’s healthy and all in.”\n\nThe Pacers were hoping Green, 27, would solidify their bench when they signed him as a free agent last summer away from the Brooklyn Nets, but he struggled offensively (shooting just 36 percent) and defensively for most of the season. His playing time was cut in the playoffs.\n\nPlumlee, 24, played in just 14 games as a rookie and spent part of the season in the NBA Developmental League, but looked to be in line to be West’s backup before Saturday’s trade.\n\n“(Scola) has NBA experience, international experience and is the type of player that will fit in nicely on our roster,” Bird said in a statement. “I want to thank Gerald and Miles for their contributions. They had tough years last season, but worked hard, never complained and contributed to the great chemistry our team had. I think Gerald and Miles will be solid additions in Phoenix and we wish them well.\"\n\nCall Star reporter Michael Pointer at (317) 444-2709. Follow him @michaelpointer."
