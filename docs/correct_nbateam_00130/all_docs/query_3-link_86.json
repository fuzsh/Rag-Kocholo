        "text": "by Shannon Booher\n\nLine Of The Night:\n\nLuis Scola – 28 points, 11 boards, 2 steals, 2 blocks\n\nEvery single Houston Rocket needs to watch the tape of this game to appreciate what Scola can do. He abused all types of varying USA defender’s, showcasing a vast array of post moves. Give that man the rock, Rick Adelman!\n\nWorst Of The Night:\n\nClocks in Argentina may still read 11:21 A.M. At roughly that moment, Manu Ginobili – the de facto king of his country – dropped to floor clutching his ankle and the hopes of a nation were dashed. Kids with crushed hoop dreams sobbed, and even the most stone-faced shed a tear. It was enough to make a hard rock cry.\n\nIt wasn’t only Argentinians that were upset. USA/Argentina was one of the potential marquee match-ups heading into the 2008 Olympics, so anybody that loved basketball had to be disappointed. Argentina put up a good fight, keeping it within 8-10 for much of the 2nd quarter, but their undermanned squad could not get over that hump, perhaps marking the end of a memorable era in Argentinian hoops. Quite possibly a whole ‘nother type of scenario if Manu had been around for the whole game, though.\n\n13 Shots To The Dome Of The Night:\n\nCarmelo Anthony – 21 points on 13-13 from the FT line, 4 boards, 1 steal, 1 block\n\nWhile Melo was a horrid 3-14 from the field, including 2-8 from three, he got it done from the other line, looking at least a little bit like the guy that lead the team during Olympic qualifying. Once Melo and the rest of his teammates went back to the lab at the half and figured out it is usually idea to shoot more 2’s than 3’s, especially when you are 6 of 20 from the outside, this game was a wrap.\n\nAnd even though Mike Breen broke out his over-the-top self-righteous tone to criticize Melo for getting in Andres Nocioni’s face after a hard foul on Dwight Howard, the little skirmish actually seemed to break Team USA out of it’s malaise and get the guys fired up. Game after game a new guy leads Team USA in scoring, which really serves to under score this group’s acceptance of the international team concept.\n\nConspiracy Theory Of The Night:\n\nJerry Colangelo runs USA Basketball. His son, Bryan, runs the Toronto Raptors, who were locked into a lengthy insurance/legal battle with Spain’s Jorge Garbajosa after he played injured for Spain’s team against the organizations wishes. Jose Calderon now plays for both the Raptors and Spain’s national team, Team USA’s last obstacle to the gold medal. He was held out of the semi-final game by Toronto’s medical staff due to a partial tear in his abductor muscle.\n\nHmm… you make the call. Spain pulled out the tough 91-86 win despite Calderon’s absence, as Lithuania’s offense sputtered towards the end. If Calderon is out for the Finals though, it severely hurts their chances.\n\nEat Your Breakfast Of The Night:\n\nSpain’s Rudy Fernandez had already proven himself to be an athletic, NBA-ready player – just ask Portland, who signed him to a contract this off-season – but who knew he was an on-call chef? When Rudy got word that Simas Jasaitis needed a little nourishment after hitting all those threes, he drove down the right side of the lane and broke out his specialty – breakfast. Have some of these magdalenas and torrijas, Simas! With a cup of cafe con leche!!!\n\nEat Your Breakfast Part II Of The Night:\n\nDid all the Lithuanians skip the pre-game spread? As it turns out, as the end of the third quarter approached, Lithuania’s Ksistof Lavrinovic was a little hungry too. The ever-accomodating Pau Gasol wasted no time putting in an order with his man Rudy, then BOOSH!!! Try these churros, Ksistof! COMER SU DESAYUNO!!!\n\nYoung Moola Of The Night:\n\nRicky Rubio – 6 boards, 4 assists, 4 points, 1 steal\n\nThe line does not look all that impressive, but with Calderon out, Rubio stepped up and led his team to victory. Last round we commented on how wild Double-R was compared to Calderon, but this time around Rubio was the calming force. Back-up Raul Lopez made a lot of raggedy, ill-advised plays, while the young gun got the ball where it needed to be and made several key defensive and hustle plays. That’s not to say he didn’t bring some flare to show – just recall the ridic one-handed, off-the-dribble oop he threw to Gasol with the score close, late. He definitely has some flop in him, too, and an uncanny ability to always get in the way and force the refs to call fouls, ala Sam Cassell. Bottomline, kid has inate instincts for the game, and yes, he’s only 17! Young mooooo-la, baaaa-by!"
