        "text": "Former Houston Rockets fan favorite Luis Scola is going for an alley-oop with his Houston area real estate. The power forward has put not one, but two Pearland homes up for sale. The two properties are located 1.6 miles away from each other. That’s about 90 basketball court lengths, for those of you keeping score at home.\n\nThe total asking price comes in just shy of $1 million — with the listings at $580,000 and $379,000. That’s modest by NBA standards, but Scola was always more of a workman than a showoff.\n\nLet’s see if Scola can sell these houses without breaking a sweat.\n\nThe larger of the two homes, going for $580,000, is located at 11801 Sea Shadow Bend. Originally listed at $625,000, the price dropped due to Scola heading East to play for the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nThe future owners will land a two-story house on a cul-de-sac with some location perks. The waterfront home is part of the Shadow Creek Ranch master-planned community.\n\nThe exterior’s appeal gets an assist from a pool, spa, and flag stone path set against a lakeview backdrop.The slatted gazebo includes a bench swing for relaxing.\n\nInside, a game room and a media room are dedicated to entertainment — no surprise for a professional athlete’s crib. The family room’s two floor to ceiling windows let in lots of natural light.\n\nThe former Coventry Homes model sits on a lot of more than 12,000 square feet. It has four bedrooms, four full baths, and one half bath, and was built in 2003.\n\nSquare footage: 4,916\n\nBedrooms/baths: 4/4.5\n\nAsking price: $580,000\n\nScola’s second home is located at 12207 Mossy Court Trail — and is listed for $379,000.\n\nBuilt in 2006, this home is a slam dunk when it comes to entertaining. The open-flow kitchen is ideal for parties. Upstairs, the game room has plumbing capacity for a wet bar. What goes better with a game than a cold one? To keep things on the warmer side, two gas log fireplaces keep the house cozy.\n\nThe large backyard features a covered patio wired for speakers. Perfect for blasting Kendrick Lamar’s “Michael Jordan.”\n\nThe four bedroom, three full bath, and one half bath, home was listed for $324,000 in the weeks before Scola purchased it in 2013, according to Realtor.com.\n\nThe Ashton Woods home measures in at 3,909 square feet and is located on a 9,291 square-foot lot.\n\nSquare footage: 3,909\n\nBedrooms/baths: 4/3.5\n\nAsking price: $379,000\n\nOriginally from Argentina, Luis Scola played for the Rockets from 2007 to 2011. His NBA career then took him to the Phoenix Suns, the Indiana Pacers, the Toronto Raptors, and the Brooklyn Nets. But he’ll always be recognized as a Argentina hero first.\n\nWinning an Olympic gold medal in 2004 and a bronze in the 2008 Summer Olympics as a member of the Argentina national basketball team earned him the role of Argentina’s flag bearer in the most recent Summer Olympics.\n\nScola’s larger home has been on the market for nearly 60 days, and the smaller has been on the market for almost 40 days on Realtor.com. Of course, he is not the only former Rockets player to put a home up for sale in the last six months.\n\nRockets legend Hakeem Olajuwon is selling his house in north Houston. The Basketball Hall-of-Famer’s 7,217-square-foot home is at 2902 Pine Lake Trail and is listed for $595,000.\n\nThe house is right next to one formerly owned by Jim McIngvale, the owner of Gallery Furniture who is better known as Mattress Mack. It looks like he’s following suit with this sale and putting that home to bed.\n\nThe buzzer hasn’t sounded yet on Scola’s Houston area twosome though."
