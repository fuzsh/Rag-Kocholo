        "text": "The fans cheered Huertas but screamed over Scola’s words. His intentions were sincere and heartfelt. “South America is a great place. It’s fun,” said Scola, who has been representing Argentina for 21 years. “The way people cheer sports are fun. We just cross the line sometimes. If we could just stop right before the line, it’s going to be the best show ever. It’s going to be beautiful. People are smart. People are creative. If we can just make people to understand that it’s just a game, it’s not [war] and all that, it’s going to be much better for everybody.”\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with an Argentine hoops site, Bogdanovic spoke about how much he respects his new teammate. “He is one of the best players from outside North America in the NBA,” Bogdanovic told Basquet Plus. “He has had a great career. I am very happy that I’ll be in the same uniform as him.”"
