        "text": "Welp … As expected, Luis Scola was shown the door today by the Houston Rockets, as they continue to desperately chase after Dwight Howard. Per the Houston Chronicle: “The Rockets waived forward Luis Scola through the NBA amnesty provision to clear cap space for trades they hope to make, a person with knowledge of the move said. They faced a Tuesday deadline to make the move, but an individual with knowledge of their thinking said on Wednesday they planned to make the move by Friday to give Scola greater opportunities with other teams. […]Teams under the cap have until Sunday afternoon to claim Scola off waivers. The Rockets would pay whatever is left after their bid for him of the $30 million remaining on his contract. If he is not claimed on waivers, they would pay all of the $21 million over three years guaranteed on his contract. Scola’s salary will not count toward the Rockets’ salary cap or luxury tax figures. The move opens additional cap room to take on salary in a trade, with talks ongoing with the Orlando Magic in which the Rockets would take back multiple players with long-term contracts. Scola averaged 14.5 points and 7.7 rebounds in his five seasons with the Rockets.”"
