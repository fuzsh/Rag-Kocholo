        "text": "Streeter Lecka/Getty Images\n\nWith Dwight Howard looking like a pipedream for the Los Angeles Lakers, a deal that could be out there is one they tried to make before the season started: acquiring Luis Scola and Kyle Lowry from the Houston Rockets.\n\nChicago Bulls beat reporter and NBA writer extraordinaire Sam Smith wrote that the a deal sending Pau Gasol to Houston for Scola and Lowry has been speculated on quite frequently.\n\nThe deal that’s been most speculated is Gasol for Luis Scola and Kyle Lowry. The Rockets are said to be high on Goran Dragic and Jonny Flynn to replace Lowry, and the Lakers desperately need a point guard under Mike Brown’s system. This is a deal, denied for now, that benefits both teams and seems likely to be made.\n\nIn addition to that, Smith was on the Dan Patrick Show Wednesday. He said that Rockets head coach Kevin McHale wants a star player and that the Lakers are desperately seeking a point guard.\n\nLowry has had an outstanding season for the Rockets that no one is talking about. He is averaging 15.9 points, 7.5 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game. He is shooting a respectable 42.4 percent from the field, and 39.1 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nHe will give the Lakers that explosive playmaker who can run the offense the way that Mike Brown wants to. Lowry would also take a lot of pressure off Kobe Bryant, who is being forced to play 38 minutes per game because the team has been unable to score without him.\n\nJeff Gross/Getty Images\n\nPlus, the deal would also give the Lakers a suitable replacement for Gasol with Scola. He is not as versatile with the ball in his hands, but he has a strong presence and isn't afraid to get physical with a defender.\n\nThe Rockets would get the star that they have coveted since the Lockout ended, and the Lakers would immediately get back into title contention.\n\nFans may want the biggest name player—which in this case is Howard—but the most practical solution for the Lakers is to address their point guard position. If they can do it by just dealing Gasol and getting a more-than-capable power forward in the process, that would make it even better."
