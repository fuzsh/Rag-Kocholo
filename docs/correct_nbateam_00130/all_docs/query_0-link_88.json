        "text": "As the 2012 NBA free agency period rapidly approaches, the Houston Rockets are busy trying to make some moves of a different variety.\n\nAccording to ESPN, the Rockets are trying to trade power forward Luis Scola after drafting Royce White and Terrence Jones who play the same position.\n\nScola has been an extremely productive player over the years for Houston, and would certainly draw some interest from a bevy of different teams. All of this movement is perhaps part of a plan to land the Orlando Magic superstar center, Dwight Howard.\n\nAt the age of 32, Scola might have his best years behind him and with the Rockets looking to reload, the smart move might be to ship him out of town before he declines rapidly. Last year, Scola had another solid season, averaging 15.5 points and 6.4 rebounds per game."
