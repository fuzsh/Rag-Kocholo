The Toronto Raptors have signed forward Luis Scola to a multi-year contract.

Financial terms of the deal announced Wednesday were not disclosed.

Scola averaged 9.4 points and 6.5 rebounds in 81 games last season for Indiana. He spent two seasons with the Pacers and has also played for the Suns and Rockets during an eight-year NBA career.

Scola has averaged 12.7 points and 7.0 rebounds in 631 career NBA games. He spent his first five seasons with Houston and played one year in Phoenix before his two-year stint with Indiana.

The 35-year-old native of Argentina was selected by San Antonio in the second round of the 2002 NBA Draft, but played internationally before making his NBA debut with Houston in 2007-08. He was a member of the NBA's All-Rookie team in his first season with the Rockets.
