        "text": "The Climate of Venezuela is characterized for being tropical and megathermal as a result of its geographical location near the Equator, but because of the topography and the dominant wind direction, several climatic types occur which can be the same as found in temperate latitudes, and even polar regions. Latitude exerts little influence on the Venezuelan climate. While the coastal cities of Maracaibo, Barcelona, Porlamar and Maiquetia can get extremely hot, cities in valleys such as Mérida, Caracas, Los Teques and San Cristobal have cooler climates, and the highest towns of Mucuchies and Apartaderos have cold (tundra) climates.\n\nThe hottest part of Venezuela is the northwest (Paraguana Peninsula and Guajira Peninsula), where temperatures of more than 38 °C (100 °F) are frequently recorded. The coldest part in the country are located in the highest areas of the Cordillera de Mérida, where temperatures lower than −2 °C (28 °F) are recorded. The Venezuelan Coastal Range and Guiana Highlands have average temperatures from 25 °C (77 °F) to 11 °C (52 °F), while the Llanos average temperature is over 23 °C (73 °F).\n\nThe highest temperature recorded was 42 °C (108 °F) in Machiques,[1] and the lowest temperature recorded was −11 °C (12 °F), it has been reported from an uninhabited high altitude at Páramo de Piedras Blancas (Mérida state),[2] even though no official reports exist, lower temperatures in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada de Mérida are known.\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, Venezuela's climate types are:[3]\n\nIt's the most prevalent and characteristic climate of the country. Maintaining temperatures above 18 °C (64 °F) and rainfall in most of the year:\n\nTropical savanna climate (Aw)\n\nIt can be found throughout the country, dominating the Llanos and northern Guayana Region, as well as other parts of the country. It is dry between December and March with annual rainfall between 600 and 1,500 mm.\n\nTropical monsoon climate (Am)\n\nIt is located in the Guayana Region, Orinoco Delta, west of Zulia, Andean and Coastal range foothills, Paria Peninsula and Barlovento region; with rainfall between 1,600 and 2,500 mm per year and a drought of just 45 days.\n\nTropical rainforest climate (Af)\n\nIt's located south of Venezuela, Orinoco Delta, El Tamá area in west of Venezuela, and south of Maracaibo Lake. Rainfall exceeds 2,500 mm, not tending dry season.\n\nTropical climates of Venezuela\n\nTropical savanna climate, influenced by a temperate highland climate in Caracas Valley\n\nTropical savanna climate in the Gran Sabana\n\nTropical savanna climate in the Llanos\n\nTropical monsoon climate in Sur del Lago\n\nTropical rainforest climate in Southern Venezuela\n\nTropical monsoon climate in Canaima\n\nTropical rainforest climate in Orinoco Delta\n\nTropical rainforest climate in Paria Peninsula\n\nTropical hot climate in Margarita Island\n\nThis type of climate the evaporation exceeds precipitation. In Venezuela is typical of desert and arid coastal areas and with annual temperatures above 18 °C. The cold semiarid type can be found at elevated portions of the Andes.\n\nHot desert climate (BWh)\n\nIt can be found in Guajira Peninsula, Paraguana Peninsula, Araya Peninsula and most of the Insular region.\n\nHot semi-arid climate (BSh)\n\nIt is located in the northern part of Zulia state, most of the area of Lara state and Falcón state, the coastal area, Insular region and some semi-arid areas in Venezuelan Andes.\n\nCold semi-arid (BSk)\n\nIt can be found locked at the temperate zones of high Andean valleys of Cordillera de Mérida.\n\nDry climates of Venezuela\n\nHot desert climate in Medanos de Coro National Park\n\nHot desert climate in Cabo San Roman\n\nHot desert climate in Guajira Desert\n\nHot desert climate in Coche Island\n\nHot desert climate in Los Roques\n\nCold semi-arid climate in Los Nevados\n\nHot semi-arid climate in Puerto La Cruz\n\nHot semi-arid climate in Barquisimeto\n\nThe monthly averages temperatures are below 22 °C (72 °F) but above 0 °C (32 °F). At least one month's average temperature is below 18 °C (64 °F):\n\nTemperate highland climates with dry winters (Cwb)\n\nIt tends to experience noticeably drier weather during the lower-sun \"winter\" season. It's located in the medium areas of the southern-east slope of Cordillera de Mérida and Sierra de Perija, the highest areas of south-western Venezuelan coastal range.\n\nTemperate highland climates without dry season (Cfb)\n\nThis climate doesn't tend to has a dry season. It's located in the medium areas of the Cordillera de Mérida and Sierra de Perija, the highest areas of Venezuelan coastal range, and the top of the highest Guiana Highlands Tepuis.\n\nTemperate climates of Venezuela\n\nTemperate highland climate in Colonia Tovar\n\nTemperate highland climate in Auyantepui\n\nTemperate highland climate in Amazonas\n\nTemperate highland climate in Sierra La Culata\n\nTemperate highland climate in El Avila National Park\n\nTemperate highland climate in Táchira\n\nIt's characterized by average temperatures below 10 °C in all 12 months of the year:\n\nAlpine tundra (ETH)\n\nAlso known as páramo climate, this climate often undergo a sudden and drastic change in daily-weather in which they fluctuate between temperatures from below freezing to as high as 20 °C. Mean annual temperatures range from 2 °C (36 °F) to 10 °C (50 °F). It is located above the 3,000 m in the Sierra de Perija and Cordillera de Mérida. The most popular village with this climate in the country is the town of Apartaderos[4]\n\nAlpine glacier (EFH)\n\nThis climate is reserved to the highest peaks of the Venezuelan Andes, such as Pico Bolívar, Pico Humboldt, [\n\nAlpine climates of Venezuela\n\nAlpine glacier in the Pico Humboldt\n\nAlpine glacier in the Pico Bolívar\n\nAlpine glacier climate in Pico La Concha\n\nAlpine tundra climate in Sierra de La Culata\n\nAlpine tundra climate in Pico Piedras Blancas\n\nAlpina tundra at Laguna de Mucubají\n\nAlpine tundra at Laguna Coromoto\n\nSnow in Mérida\n\nAlpina tundra at Mifafí Valley\n\nVenezuelan climates are structured in \"thermal floors\", as mentioned next:[5][6]\n\nThis climate is characterized by very hot temperatures above 26 °C (79 °F), with precipitations that ranges from dry (less than 300 mm) to pluvial (more than 3300 mm) conditions. This climate can be found in areas below 300 m in sedimentary basins and lowlands such as the Llanos, Orinoco Delta, Maracaibo Basin, Orinoco Basin, and coastal plains and islands; it comprises almost all the country. This climate zone is present in cities like Maracaibo, Punto Fijo, Ciudad Guayana, Porlamar, Puerto La Cruz, Barinas, Tucupita, Cumaná, Maturin, Anaco, Ciudad Bolívar, Cabimas, El Vigía and others.\n\nWarm climate can be found between 300 and 650 m.

This climate zone is present in cities like Mérida (higher part), Colonia Tovar, San Antonio de Los Altos, El Jarillo, El Junquito, Galipan, Timotes, La Grita, Tabay, La Mucuy and others; most of the top of the tepuis also present this climate.\n\nThis climate is characterized by temperatures above 8 °C (46 °F) and below 13 °C (55 °F), with precipitations that ranges from scarcely rainy (300 – 700 mm) to pluvial (more than 3300 mm) conditions. This climate can be found in mountainous areas around 2,400 to 3,200 m specifically in Sierra de Perija, Cordillera de Mérida, higher elevations at Venezuelan Coastal Range and higher tepuis (Monte Roraima, Kukenan, Cerro Marahuaca, Chimantá Massif).

The condition of this climate is also known as páramo\n\nFrosty climate is found at the highest areas in Venezuelan Andes, between 4,150 and 4,700 m. where the temperatures are between 0 °C (32 °F) to 3 °C (37 °F). This climate zone is present exclusively at Sierra Nevada de Mérida, Sierra de La Culata and Sierra de Santo Domingo.\n\nThis climate is characterized by average temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) all year, it's located in the highest peaks of Venezuela in the Cordillera de Mérida such as Pico Bolívar, Pico Humboldt, Pico La Concha, Pico Bonpland, Pico Espejo, Pico Mucuñuque and Pico Piedras Blancas.
