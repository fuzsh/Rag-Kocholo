        "text": "A break from the rain is ahead in parts of flood-weary Texas as dam releases on the rain-swollen lower Colorado River alleviate pressure from torrential rain earlier in the week.\n\nThe flooding has already claimed the lives of two people and prompted the governor to issue a state of emergency for several counties.\n\n(NEWS: Llano River Deadly Flooding)\n\nThe big concern remains for the Highland Lakes watershed, which is experiencing \"historic flooding,\" according to the Lower Colorado River Authority, which manages levels on the lakes and Lower Colorado River.\n\nLake Travis, one of the six Highland Lakes formed by dams along the lower Colorado River west of Austin, topped 704 feet Friday for only the fifth time on record and first time since the July 1997 flood.\n\nThe lake was expected to rise another 1 to 2 feet Saturday, but is not currently expected to trigger additional floodgates to be opened at Mansfield Dam, at the base of Lake Travis about 13 miles northwest of downtown Austin, the LCRA stated in their Saturday morning flood operations report. Four floodgates remain open as of early Saturday.\n\nThis was a controlled release from Lake Travis, to manage downstream river levels. However, flooding along the lake at Graveyard Point reached to the roofs of some homes, the Austin American Statesman reported.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, this additional rise would flood hundreds of homes at Graveyard Point.\n\nThe LCRA said flood operations were ongoing at all of the six Highland Lakes. At Buchanan Dam in Llano County, only two floodgates remained open as of Friday midday, with the lake gradually being drawn down.\n\nThe Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) closed lakes Travis, Marble Falls, Lyndon B. Johnson, Inks and Buchanan until further notice due to fast-moving floodwaters.\n\nThe culprit of this was torrential rain earlier this week in the Edwards Plateau upstream from the Texas Hill Country lakes.\n\nAs much as 13.24 inches of rain was reported near Valley Spring in Llano County during the 48 hours ending Tuesday morning.\n\nThe Llano River in Llano, Texas, rose to its second-highest crest on record Tuesday morning.\n\nThis incredible rainfall was due to a northward buckle of the jet stream in the West that left behind an upper-level low-pressure system over the southwestern U.S. this week.\n\nIn absence of a jet stream to kick the low out, it stalled out over the region, pumping in moisture from Mexico and Central America.\n\nRecord-Wet Fall So Far\n\nThis latest siege of rain continues what has been a record wet stretch since last month.\n\nLast month was the wettest September on record in Texas dating to 1895, according to NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\nAccording to preliminary data compiled by Texas state climatologist Dr. John Nielsen-Gammon, September 2018 was among the top-three-wettest months in state history, eclipsed only by May 2015 and August 2017, which featured Hurricane Harvey's record-smashing rain.\n\nDallas, Laredo and San Antonio each had their record-wettest September, and several other Texas cities had one of their five wettest Septembers, including Beaumont, Del Rio and Lufkin.\n\nOctober has continued the wet drumbeat.\n\nThe first 18 days of October were the wettest such period on record in Dallas-Ft. Worth, Waco and San Angelo according to the Southeast Regional Climate Center.\n\nThrough October 19, the following measurable rain streaks were ongoing:\n\nAustin (Camp Mabry): 7 straight days; 11 of the last 14 days\n\nSan Angelo: 7 straight days; 9 of the last 12 days\n\nOn average, October typically exhibits a secondary peak in Texas rainfall after late spring, to some degree due to heavy rainfall from tropical storms and hurricanes.\n\nUnlike last year, though, no Gulf tropical storm or hurricane has tracked into Texas in 2018 so far.\n\nTexas Flood Reports Recap\n\nNumerous roads have been closed in western Kerr County, Texas, after more than 7 inches of rain fell in the 24 hours ending early Tuesday, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nMonday morning, a high-water rescue was reported near Lake Pat Cleburne in Texas, and a few roads in the state were closed due to flash flooding.\n\nLast weekend, flooding rain triggered water rescues in Bryan and College Station, Texas, and flash flooding was reported in the cities of Midland and San Angelo."
