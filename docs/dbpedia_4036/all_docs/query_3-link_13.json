The slow moving tornado first touched down near the Llano River 9 miles northwest of Loyal Valley and then travelled a 7-mile long path, finally dissipating 5 miles north of Loyal Valley. This tornado, whose width would reach three-quarters of a mile wide at times, caused widespread devastation. Two homes were completely destroyed, with debris scattered over great distances. Large pieces of a pick-up truck were located three-quarters of a mile away from the house where it had been left. Tragically, one person was killed and 5 others were injured when that same house was destroyed. The people had sought refuge in a car in a stone garage, but as the tornado tore across the garage, debris smashed through the car, killing one man and injuring the remaining occupants. Sixteen other houses were damaged, along with additional barns and outbuildings. Numerous head of cattle and deer were also killed as the tornado passed. When the tornado crossed Farm-to-Market Road 152, a stretch of asphalt 720 feet wide was ripped off of the road surface. M75PH A series of supercell thunderstorms ripped across the Heartland and Northwest Hill Country on the afternoon of the 11th. Three tornadoes would touch down, including a devastating F4 tornado north of Loyal Valley in eastern Mason County. One person was killed and 6 others injured as the three-quarters of a mile tornado tracked a 7 mile long path.25.11969-05-06330°29'N / 98°21'W30°35'N / 98°19'W7.20 Miles100 Yards0025K0Burnet26.31965-05-16230°30'N / 99°00'W0.20 Mile33 Yards000K0Gillespie27.31999-03-12231°04'N / 99°03'W31°04'N / 98°51'W8.00 Miles100 Yards00300K0San SabaBrief Description: The same thunderstorm that spawned a brief touchdown in McCulloch County produced a second tornado south of Richland Springs. A hunting cabin, two trailer homes, 2 barns, and 3 vehicles were destroyed. Several rounds of thunderstorms developed across West Central Texas on the morning and afternoon of the 12th. The first round of storms brought dime to golf ball size hail to parts of the Northern Edwards Plateau, Concho Valley, and the Heartland. A second round of storms that developed during the early afternoon produced a supercell across the southern Heartland. This storm dropped a tornado south of Brady in Southern McCulloch County, as well as hail up the size of golf balls in the town of Brady itself. As the supercell moved into San Saba County, a second tornado would touch down. This tornado had an 8 mile long path and was 100 yards wide, passing 8 miles south of Richland Springs. Although each tornado would produce damage, no injuries or deaths were reported.27.51994-05-13330°34'N / 98°16'W30°36'N / 98°14'W3.50 Miles800 Yards015.0M50KBurnetBrief Description: The storm approached the city from the west-southwest. There were unconfirmed reports of funnels in the Horseshoe Bay area, four miles southwest of Marble Falls, before the storm arrived. Spotty damage was reported to roofs in the Horseshoe Bay area. The tornado first struck the west side of the city, crossing a heavy commercialized and residential area. Roofs were severely damaged at this time with several structures sustaining F1 and F2 damage. Several boats at a dealership were tossed on top of each other. Two-by-four's were embedded into the side of a church preschool care center, penetrating an inside classroom wall by four to five feet. Fortunately, all children had been moved into hallways just before the tornado arrived. Numerous commerical signs were down with widespread roof damage. This damage became even more extensive as the tornado moved across the northern part of the city. Marble Falls primary school also sustained damage, but students had been evacuated to the main school. Trees were uprooted on the school grounds and damage was reported to outbuildings. Metal I-beams were bent at a nearby metal building, indicating F2 to F3 damage. Three nearby semi-tractor trailer delivery trucks and a bread delivery truck were overturned. Two of these trucks were reported to have been lifted \"two to three feet off of the ground\" as they were overturned. At a nearby Wal-Mart department store 100 to 200 employees had taken shelter, having practiced their severe weather drill the day before. The store was hit and severely damaged, with the employees sustaining only a few minor injuries. Additional roof damage was reported at Marble Falls High School. Students had just executed a tornado drill as the storm struck. There was extensive peeling of metal from the auditorium and gymnasium roofs. In summary, over 440 homes sustained damage, with one house and 17 mobile homes destroyed and major damage to 36 homes. Eighteen businesses reported major damage with 47 others reporting minor damage. In addition, two bridges were damaged, along with severe damage to schools. In all, 512 structures sustained damage.28.41973-03-10330°44'N / 98°14'W30°49'N / 98°09'W7.80 Miles250 Yards0400K0Burnet30.21989-05-17230°21'N / 98°52'W2.00 Miles100 Yards000K0Gillespie31.01969-05-06330°17'N / 98°24'W30°29'N / 98°21'W14.20 Miles100 Yards0025K0Blanco31.81981-05-15231°11'N / 98°57'W31°10'N / 98°49'W8.00 Miles150 Yards000K0San Saba33.51962-05-28230°17'N / 98°51'W30°17'N / 98°46'W5.10 Miles100 Yards000K0Gillespie33.81999-03-12231°00'N / 99°11'W30°59'N / 99°09'W2.00 Miles75 Yards00100K0MccullochBrief Description: A tornado touched down southeast of Brady, heavily damaging a house and a barn. Several rounds of thunderstorms developed across West Central Texas on the morning and afternoon of the 12th. The first round of storms brought dime to golf ball size hail to parts of the Northern Edwards Plateau, Concho Valley, and the Heartland. A second round of storms that developed during the early afternoon produced a supercell across the southern Heartland. This storm dropped a tornado south of Brady in Southern McCulloch County, as well as hail up the size of golf balls in the town of Brady itself. As the supercell moved into San Saba County, a second tornado would touch down. This tornado had an 8 mile long path and was 100 yards wide, passing 8 miles south of Richland Springs. Although each tornado would produce damage, no injuries or deaths were reported.34.22001-10-12330°15'N / 98°40'W30°16'N / 98°39'W2.50 Miles400 Yards051.0M100KGillespieBrief Description: The strongest of the Friday night tornadoes struck the town of Stonewall. This tornado, rated F3 on the Fujita Scale, was preceded by brief gusty winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour, very heavy rainfall and spotty .5-inch hail. The tornado formed around 830 pm CST near the intersection of Hahn Road and SH290. It moved north-northeastward for .75 miles, crossing SH290 and the Pedernales River. Just north of the river, it made a slight turn toward the east, now moving another mile toward the northeast. It crossed North River Road and continued over open country until it crossed Ranch Road 1623. After passing RR1623 for approximately .25 miles, it dissipated. The worst damage, F3 level, was to trees and homes between RR1623 and SH290, across the northwest and north central part of Stonewall. Ninety homes sustained damage with 6 destroyed. In addition, 7 mobile homes were destroyed and 20 damaged. Damage was also reported to 22 buildings. A two-story home had the entire second story destroyed, and a concrete building lost most of its walls and all of its roof. Other damage along the path typically included destroyed and damaged roofs and walls of homes and businesses as well as widespread damage to trees. The tornado path was approximately .25 miles in width and 2.5 miles in length. Although the tornado was not seen due to the late hour and darkness, residents did report that after heavy rain and hail, the wind became calm, and it was followed by a \"roaring sound\" so often reported in tornadoes. Five persons were injured with one man hospitalized as a result of the tornado.35.01970-05-15230°15'N / 98°36'W0.50 Mile27 Yards003K0Gillespie38.91979-03-02330°46'N / 99°23'W30°47'N / 99°16'W7.10 Miles150 Yards012.5M0Mason39.21965-06-06230°35'N / 99°18'W1.00 Mile200 Yards000K0Mason39.81969-05-06330°07'N / 98°34'W30°17'N / 98°24'W15.20 Miles100 Yards0225K0Blanco42.41973-05-24231°19'N / 98°23'W2.50 Miles250 Yards0025K0Lampasas44.91969-05-06330°06'N / 98°35'W30°07'N / 98°34'W2.30 Miles100 Yards0025K0Kendall45.11980-08-10230°06'N / 98°25'W30°08'N / 98°35'W10.40 Miles33 Yards0025.0M0Blanco45.31999-05-11330°18'N / 99°12'W30°15'N / 99°11'W3.50 Miles200 Yards001.0M100KGillespieBrief Description: The tornado was preceded by strong, gusty winds, very heavy rainfall and finally, large hail. Severe winds in advance of the tornado took a roof off the High School in Harper and laid it on the ground on the opposite side of the building. These winds also damaged several other roofs in the area. The tornado began its track around three miles east of Harper, moving toward the southeast. It lifted post oak trees out of the ground with their roots in tact. Approximately 2 miles down the path, it turned toward the south and continued for another 1.5 miles. Along its track, it destroyed. 35 homes, 10 mobile homes, and damaged or destroyed 25 outbuildings and barns. The tornado damage several vehicles and tossed one jeep over 100 yards.47.31989-05-14231°08'N / 99°20'W1.00 Mile100 Yards000K0Mcculloch48.61997-05-27430°22'N / 98°01'W30°20'N / 97°59'W5.60 Miles440 Yards1515.0M0KTravisBrief Description: M25MH The Pedernales Valley tornado began on the shore of Lake Travis destroying trees and a floating marina where nearly all of the watercraft were destroyed. While numerous trees were twisted and uprooted in this area, several structures sustained only what appeared to be minor damage that would be no more than F0. The tornado was initially moving westward as it moved into rough terrain. A number of structures sustained varying damage until the tornado reached Bee Creek Road. At that location, a Southwest Bell building housing telephone switching equipment was destroyed. The building was well constructed and was one of several buildings which indicated at F4 rating for this tornado. Bee Creek Road takes a bend close to the telephone building and across the street a house was destroyed with walls knocked down. Approximately 2.2 miles from the lake, the tornado path takes a distinct dog leg turn toward the southwest. The point at which this dog-leg turn occurred also corresponds with a knoll. Trees and buildings at the top of the knoll were destroyed. After the dog-leg turn, the tornado assumed a heading of 250 degrees and crossed a major power distribution line. One steel tower was destroyed bringing all lines to the ground. The tornado remained on the 250 degree heading moving through the area described as the Hazy Hills subdivision. Numerous houses and several mobile homes were totally destroyed. Several houses survived but sustained major damage making them totally uninhabitable. The only death associated with this tornado occurred here when one man was killed. He lived in a mobile home that was demolished and his vehicle was tossed several hundred feet. Other survey team members were unable to learn whether he was in the mobile home or had left it to drive away. The tornado continued west-southwest moving across State Road (SR) 71. A number of well built homes in the Hazy Hills subdivision were heavily damaged or destroyed. Crossing SR 71, the tornado moved into another subdivision with widely separated houses in the Lick Creek valley, a steep walled creek that feeds into the Pedernales River. One stone-walled house located just north of Pedernales Drive and west of SR 71 was completely deroofed. Other structures in this subdivision sustained roof damage in the F2 range. After following the terrain into the creek it climbed another rise in the land before ending shortly after passing the crest of the small hill. As the tornado ended, damage was minimal to trees.48.71977-04-14230°16'N / 98°00'W30°34'N / 97°54'W21.60 Miles200 Yards00250K0Travis48.81977-04-14230°34'N / 97°54'W30°50'N / 97°48'W19.40 Miles33 Yards00250K0Williamson49.81997-05-27230°28'N / 97°56'W30°26'N / 97°53'W3.60 Miles100 Yards0050K10KTravisBrief Description: The Cedar Park tornado formed around 3:05 pm CST from a different supercell thunderstorm. It first touched down about 3.5 miles north of Cedar Park at a location 0.6 miles south of CR 178 and 1.4 miles east of the intersection of US 183 and CR 178. The initial damage was to trees, however, the ground survey revealed damage nearby to a church and a trucking company. The aerial survey did not reflect this damage as being in line with the damage path. It is quite possible this damage was caused by strong wind near the tornado. The beginning point was in a relatively open area with damage primarily to a few trees and minor shingle damage to one house. The tornado moved south-southwestward skirting a residential area before it crossed CR 180 immediately east of US 183. A historic train located on the north side of CR 180 just to the east of US 183 was in the direct path of the tornado. While the engine remained on the track, a coal tender converted to hold diesel fuel and weighing approximately 65,000 pounds including the 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel was flipped over and thrown a short distance. Continuing across CR180, it entered a shopping center where it weakened and pushed inward slightly the north wall of a grocery store. It also pushed large metal doors inward that were built to open toward the outside. Damage at this point had been generally F2 with brief F3 as the tornado knocked the train tender off the track and damaged the wall and doors of the food store. It tore off much of a weakly supported roof of a grocery store. The manager of the store, who had been a victim of the Wichita Falls Tornado of 1979, saw the approaching tornado, and made an announcement to all in the store to meet him in the middle of the store. He then led everyone he could gather into the meat locker. This very quick and decisive action probably saved several lives. The tornado crossed US 183 causing additional damage to a number of businesses. One business on the west side of US 183 lost nearly the entire roof. Most damage to other businesses was believed to be minor. After crossing US 183 the tornado moved across Marquis Lane and North Park Circle moving through an area with widely scattered housing and a relative abundance of trees. Again, most damage to structures in this area was minor. From North Park Circle the tornado moved into the northwestern portion of Buttercup Creek, a subdivision of well constructed homes. Damage to homes was irregular with one house losing a roof but the house next door losing only shingles. Two homes in the area were nearly destroyed an one damaged when a pickup truck was lifted and tossed against its front wall. Eleven homes were destroyed, with damage reported to over 100 homes. The damage level ranged from F0 to F2. At this point, the tornado track was taking a gentle right turn as the tornado track became more southwesterly. The tornado moved into a wooded area crossing into Travis County before ending 1.1 miles from Lake Travis. Damage in the wooded area was irregular ranging from near total destruction of all trees to sections with about 10 percent of the trees down."
