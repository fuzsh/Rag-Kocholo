        "text": "Introduction\n\nTexas is a giant among U.S. states. Only Alaska is bigger. From north to south Texas stretches 801 miles (1,289 kilometers). From east to west it extends 773 miles (1,244 kilometers). Both of these distances are greater than the airline mileage between New York City and Chicago, Illinois.\n\nTexas lies in the south-central United States. Its southwestern and southern boundary is formed by the Rio Grande. Across the river lies Mexico. On the southeast Texas borders on the Gulf of Mexico. To the east are Louisiana and Arkansas, with the Sabine River forming most of the boundary with Louisiana. North of Texas is Oklahoma. The Red River makes up the eastern two-thirds of the boundary with Oklahoma. The rest of that border is the Texas Panhandle, a piece of land that juts north of the Red River. New Mexico is to the west.\n\nNatural Regions\n\nTexas has a wide variety in its landscapes, minerals, and soils. It includes parts of three of the large natural regions of the United States. Southern and eastern Texas belong to the Coastal Plain, a province of the Atlantic Plain. The Central Lowland and Great Plains provinces of the Interior Plains cover northern and central Texas. Southwest Texas belongs to the Basin and Range Province of the Intermontane Plateaus region.\n\nFind Out:\n\nWhy is a remote part of Texas called the Staked Plain?\n\nWhat’s the “big bend” in Big Bend National Park?\n\nWhat’s the highest mountain in Texas?\n\nCoastal Plain\n\nThe Coastal Plain covers about 40 percent of the state’s area. It extends 150 to 250 miles (240 to 400 kilometers) inland from the Gulf of Mexico. Along the coast are many barrier islands—long, sandy islands that protect the shore from the effects of the ocean. The mainland part of the plain is made up of flat, low prairies that are good for farming and cattle raising. It ends at a line of hills that reaches across Texas from Denison, near the Oklahoma border, to Del Rio, on the Rio Grande.\n\nCentral Lowland\n\nThe Central Lowland covers most of the eastern edge of the Panhandle and the north-central part of the state. This region is also known as the North Central Plains. It extends southward to include the cities of Fort Worth, Abilene, and Colorado City. The eastern part of this region includes the Grand Prairie. This grassland is sandwiched between two long, narrow strips of forest called the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers. The rest of the Texas portion of the Central Lowland consists of rolling plains—mostly flat land with some gentle hills.\n\nGreat Plains Province\n\nThe Great Plains Province extends over most of the Panhandle and west-central and central Texas. The Great Plains is a vast, flat grassland that stretches all the way from Canada south to the border between Texas and Mexico. The section of the Great Plains that covers most of the Panhandle is called the High Plains. The land there rises gradually in elevation from about 2,500 feet (760 meters) in the east to 4,700 feet (1,400 meters) in the west. The economy of the High Plains depends on grain and cotton farming, ranching, and oil production.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe portion of the High Plains along the Texas–New Mexico border is known as the Llano Estacado, or Staked Plain. According to legend, when traveling through the region in the mid-1500s, Spanish explorers led by Francisco Vázquez de Coronado laid down stakes to serve as guides for the return trip because the plain lacked natural landmarks. Even Native peoples hesitated to travel across these dry, desolate lands.\n\nSouth of the High Plains is the Edwards Plateau. It lies between the Colorado River on the north and the Rio Grande on the south. The soil is thin and rocky and not good for farming, but there is grass for grazing cattle, goats, and sheep.\n\nBasin and Range Province\n\nThe most rugged land in Texas is in the Basin and Range Province, in the far western part of the state. This region has mountain ranges separated by dry, sandy basins—bowl-shaped depressions in the surface of the land. The highest peaks are in the Guadalupe Mountains, which extend into Texas from New Mexico. To the south is Big Bend country, named for its location on a big curve in the Rio Grande. The spectacular beauty of this region is on display in Big Bend National Park.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe highest point in Texas is Guadalupe Peak, in the Guadalupe Mountains. It rises to 8,749 feet (2,667 meters) above sea level.\n\nRivers\n\nMost of the rivers of Texas flow southeast toward the Gulf of Mexico. The most important river is the Rio Grande. It flows about 1,900 miles (3,060 kilometers) from its source in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado to the gulf. Its Texas segment forms the border between the United States and Mexico. Other major rivers crossing the state are the Brazos, Sabine, Trinity, and Red rivers. The Red River forms a large part of the border between Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nTexas sometimes experiences droughts. The state’s main conservation challenge has been maintaining an adequate water supply in times when rivers are low or dry. Texas has built many dams and reservoirs to store water for use in homes and businesses as well as for flood control, power generation, and irrigation.\n\nClimate\n\nThe large size and diverse landscapes of Texas create great variety in climate. In January temperatures can soar well into the 90s F (about 35 °C) at the southern tip of the state, while blizzards block highways in the Panhandle. On average winter temperatures are in the 60s and 70s F (about 18 to 24 °C) in the far south but are about 20 degrees cooler in the far north. Eastern Texas is the wettest part of the state, and precipitation decreases gradually toward the west. The mountains of western Texas have dry, clear days with dramatic dips in temperature at nightfall. Most parts of Texas can see snow occasionally, but heavy snow falls mostly in the Panhandle and in the mountains.\n\nThe Gulf Coast of Texas sometimes experiences severe storms, including destructive hurricanes. The deadliest storm to hit the area was in 1900, when more than 8,000 people were killed and much of the island city of Galveston was destroyed. Other devastating storms to strike Texas included Hurricane Audrey (June 1957), Hurricane Carla (September 1961), Tropical Storm Allison (June 2001), Hurricane Ike (September 2008), and Hurricane Harvey (August 2017).\n\nPlants and Animals\n\nFind Out:\n\nWhere are the thickest forests in Texas?\n\nDoes Texas have venomous snakes?\n\nA great variety of plant life is found in Texas because of differences in precipitation and types of soils. Forests cover more than one-third of the land. The thickest forests are found in East Texas, particularly in the region known as the Piney Woods. The most common trees are southern pine, oak, hickory, cypress, elm, sweet gum, black gum, and ash. Marsh and salt grasses are found along the Texas coast, with bluestem and tall grasses growing a little farther inland.\n\nBluestem, grama, Indian grass, switch grass, and buffalo grass grow in the prairies and plains regions of West Texas. Oak, pecan, elm, Osage orange, and mesquite are native trees found on the prairies. Cedar, mesquite, yucca, cactus, and some stands of cypress make up the plant life of the Edwards Plateau. Desert plants—grasses, shrubs, and cacti—provide much of the vegetation of the Basin and Range Province. Piñon pine, ponderosa pine, spruce, cedar, and oak grow in the higher mountains of the region.\n\nHundreds of species of birds—nearly three-fourths of all species found in the United States—are found in Texas. Among them are the once nearly extinct whooping cranes that winter in the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, near Corpus Christi. The endangered Attwater’s prairie chicken is bred in a number of Texas zoos and protected at a national wildlife refuge near Houston.\n\nMany of the domesticated animals that are important in the economy of Texas—cattle, horses, sheep, goats, and hogs—were first brought to the region by the Spanish. However, about 150 mammals are native to the state. Some, such as the bison, black bear, mountain lion, pronghorn, and red wolf, almost disappeared in the late 1800s but have been saved from extinction through the efforts of conservationists. More than 100 species of snakes are native to the state. Among them are the venomous copperhead, cottonmouth, rattlesnake, and Texas coral snake. Alligators are found in the lower reaches of all the major rivers and bayous."
