        "text": "12 am Update -\n\nThe Winter Storm Warning has been canceled! Winter Weather Advisories are in effect until 6am for Milam County, 9am for Mason County, and 10am for the rest of the CBS Austin area except for Fayette County. Light freezing drizzle is possible that could result in patchy light icing, but the worst (this round, at least) is over.\n\n9pm Update -\n\nThe National Weather Service list of weather reports shows as much as 0.75\" ice accumulation has fallen. At least one computer model suggests another 1/4\" to 1/3\" may be possible in the Hill Country through Williamson County as more freezing rain pushes through late Thursday night.\n\n?s=20\n\n8pm Update -\n\nAustin dropped a degree from 32 to 31. That one degree may make a big difference, given that we still have light glaze tracking through from southwest to northeast. The likelihood of untreated elevated roads icing up has gone up a little more. It's also more difficult to discern wet versus icy at night because of lower visibility. Travel discouraged. We may see the lingering light freezing rain through the night - though not as steady.\n\n6pm Update -\n\nThe weight of the ice on trees is taking its toll. Thunderstorms have moved out long ago. If you hear a crashing sound, that's probably the sound of tree branches coming down. Be careful out there. Travel conditions are extremely hazardous too. Although the steady precip has diminished, light occasional freezing drizzle and sleet and drizzle are ongoing. Temps in Austin had \"warmed\" to 33 during the afternoon, but as of 6pm, dropped back down to 32. Elevated surfaces like bridges and overpasses freeze first. Power outages will remain possible as well.\n\n4pm Update -\n\nIn anticipation of Sunday and Monday's possible accumulating snowfall event, Milam County has already been placed under a Winter Storm Watch. Other counties will l likely be added as we get closer.\n\n3pm Update -\n\nTemps remain just above freezing at Camp Mabry and ABIA, but many other areas are still freezing. Additional ice accumulation is expected into the evening hours before this system moves out. This is the first in a parade of storms - a total of four. Each one could bring us winter weather potential, along with dangerously cold air.\n\n?s=20\n\n2 pm Update -\n\nTemps continue at or below freezing for most areas north and west of Downtown Austin where it is 33 degrees. Ice accumulation is taking its toll on trees and plants. Some are weighed down by as much as 1/4\" of ice. There are reports of around 18-thousand power outages.\n\n?s=20\n\nOur stretch of winter weather is just getting started in Central Texas. Icy conditions today will be followed by bitter cold, record-breaking temperatures and snow next week.\n\nWINTER STORM WARNINGS for Travis, Williamson, Burnet, Blanco, Llano, and Gillespie counties until midnight tonight. In effect for Milam and Mason counties until 6PM Thursday.\n\nWINTER WEATHER ADVISORY for Hays, Bastrop, Lee, and Caldwell counties until midnight tonight.\n\nUp to 1/10\"-1/4\" of ice accumulation expected. This will create major impacts on your roadways and could lead to power outages. Already, ice accumulation on bridges and overpasses is making for a messy commute. Road conditions will be deteriorating through the day.\n\nScattered showers and storms will continue throughout the day today. These showers and storms could provide a mix of cold rain, freezing rain, sleet, and even small hail with some storms producing frequent lightning. Roads will deteriorate through the morning as temperatures hover right around freezing. Be very cautious on roadways as ice accumulates. Ice on trees and power lines could also lead to power outages.\n\n\"Highs\" this afternoon in Austin will only reach the low to mid 30s, but when you factor in breezy winds, it will feel like the 20s all day.\n\nWhile rain and wintry mix are not as likely Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, isolated showers will still be possible. Overnight temperatures will be in the 20s and low 30s with highs in the mid to upper 30s through the weekend.\n\nAnother push of colder Arctic air moves in Sunday. Temperatures will fall into the teens by Monday morning. I'm forecast multiple record low and record cold high temperatures both Monday and Tuesday, including the coldest temperature we've seen in Austin in over 30 years!\n\nMonday low - 15. Record - 20 (1909).\n\nMonday high - 22. Record - 38 (1909).\n\nTuesday low - 9. Record - 20 (1903). The last time we hit the single digits in Austin was on December 23, 1989.\n\nTuesday high - 33. Record - 40 (1900).\n\nThe record cold temperatures will coincide with a second surge of moisture on Monday. Isolated wintry mix showers will be possible late Sunday, transitioning to widespread snow early Monday morning. While it's still too early to nail down exact snow accumulation numbers, forecast models are in good agreement for 2\"-4\" for much of the area by the time snow clears out Monday afternoon."
