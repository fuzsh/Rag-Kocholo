        "text": "Wait, what? Texas? Not Colorado?\n\nWe get this all the time. There is a Colorado River that flows through Arizona, Utah, and other western states. Ours is the “other” Colorado River—the Texas Colorado River. But here, we just call it the “Colorado River.”\n\nMore than 800 miles long, the Texas Colorado River is the longest river to start and end in the same state and is the lifeblood of our state’s economy, our environment, our industry, our agriculture, and especially our lives as Texans.\n\nIts headwaters begin in northwest Texas, and the river flows southeast, supporting many different communities and ecosystems and eventually emptying into the Gulf of Mexico at Matagorda Bay. Along the way, its reservoirs form the Highland Lakes, and it flows through downtown Austin, the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the country."
