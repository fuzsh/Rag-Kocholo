        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nGlobal warming has increased the severity and frequency of extreme weather events worldwide; many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; IPCC 2013) reported the global surface temperature is expected to rise about 1.5°C by the end of the year 2100 relative to 1850 to 1900 for all representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. except RCP2.6. The RCPs are four greenhouse gas concentration (not emissions) trajectories adopted by the IPCC for its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The AR5 supersedes the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) projections published in 2000. The RCP2.6 emission and concentration pathway is representative of the literature on mitigation scenarios aiming to limit the increase of global mean temperature to 2°C (van Vuuren et al. 2011).\n\nDuring the previous century, the Northern and Southern Hemispheres experienced an alarming rate of change in average surface temperature, equal to 2.37° and 1.30°C (100 yr)−1, respectively (Gil-Alana 2008). Donat et al. (2013) found a significant warming of both maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) temperatures over global land areas since 1950. The studies have reported a large spatial and temporal variability in the patterns of temperature and precipitation extremes worldwide, including in Pakistan (Abbas 2013; Abbas et al. 2014, 2018; Galarneau et al. 2012; Lau and Kim 2012; Yao and Chen 2015; van Wijngaarden 2015; Balling et al. 2016; Sen Roy et al. 2016). Other than temporal variations, there are substantial regional variations in the trends of temperatures driven by land-use/land-cover changes, including the role of the urban heat island (UHI), deforestation, agriculture-related irrigation effects, and other anthropogenic activities (Stocker et al. 2013; Sen Roy et al. 2016). Balling et al. (2016) reported several identifiable anthropogenic signals in the temperature records from Iran, but unlike most other studies (e.g., Wang et al. 2013; Lu and Liu 2014; Mohan and Kandya 2015), the reported signals were stronger with indices related to maximum rather than to minimum temperatures.\n\nThe assessment and predictability of extreme events is a challenging task because in order to understand regional climatic patterns, it is necessary to monitor how often the extreme events happen at a regional level/scale (Llano and Penalba 2011). Brunetti et al. (2004) investigated patterns for temperature and precipitation extremes in Italy during the last century and reported an overall increase in the intensity and frequency of precipitation extremes from 1951 to 2000 in the southern part of the country. An increase in the percentage of warm nights and a decrease in the percentage of cool nights have been reported for the western and eastern coasts of South America (Vincent et al. 2005). Increases in trends among the cold and warm trials of the daily minimum and maximum temperature frequencies have been reported during the latter half of the twentieth century for Europe (Klein Tank and Können 2003) and for central and South Asia (Klein Tank et al. 2006). About 61% of the time series studied by Roy and Balling (2004) showed an upward trend for precipitation in India. Similar findings (i.e., significant increases in rainfall trends) have been reported for various parts of India by Goswami et al. (2006) and Sen Roy (2009). Historically, Pakistan experienced variable rainfall patterns (Zahid and Rasul 2011).\n\nChanges in the patterns of weather extremes (temperature and precipitation), especially for regions that are less reported in the literature, are important to evaluate in order to predict the variability in these climate change scenarios (Alexander et al. 2006; Webster et al. 2011). This study examined the variability and change in the extreme weather events during a 36-yr analysis period (1980–2015) in the province of Balochistan, Pakistan, which has been only a small focus in climate change literature but a larger focus with regards to Chinese business endeavors through the deep and hot waters of the Balochistan coast of Pakistan.\n\n4. Discussion and conclusions\n\nVariations in regional weather extremes are dictated by an increased scale of anthropogenic activities that are directly related to the population increase in a region. Typical anthropogenic activities increase the effect of UHIs, decrease land cover through deforestation, and variate land-use change through agriculture and related irrigation effects. These activities affect weather processes, resulting in an increase in temperature and precipitation at random, as mentioned in the literature (Wang et al. 2013; Lu and Liu 2014; Mohan and Kandya 2015; Balling et al. 2016; Sen Roy et al. 2016).\n\nFindings presented in Table 3 show a general warming trend in Balochistan. The frequency of extremely cold days and nights decreased and the frequency of extremely hot days and nights increased during the analysis period of 1981–2015. Moreover, hot extremes generally had trends of greater magnitude than their cold counterparts, suggesting that the warm tails of the daily temperature distribution were changing faster than the cold tails. This implies that the shape of the distribution of daily temperature extremes changed along with their historical mean values, as they did in the southwestern province of Sindh, Pakistan (Abbas et al. 2018). Overall, a consistent pattern of warming was observed across the selected cities of Balochistan, Pakistan. These findings are in concurrence with the literature that indicates an overall decrease in cold extremes and an increase in warm extremes since the middle of the twentieth century (Seneviratne et al. 2012). Increased temperature in urban areas causes a change in the energy balance of these areas, often leading to higher temperatures than those of the surrounding rural areas under the phenomenon of UHIs.\n\nFor the UHI phenomenon, historical population change data and the calculated temperature indices for the selected cities were correlated to determine the effect of population increase on the increase in temperature extremes. The increase in population was found to be linearly and statistically correlated with most of the temperature indices, including TN10p, TX10p, TXn, TXx, DTR, WSDI, SU25, and TR20 (Table 4). This showed the effect of UHIs on trends of cool nights, cool days, hottest nights, coldest days, diurnal temperature range, warm days, summer days, and tropical nights during the studied year. These results are in concurrence with the findings of Sen Roy et al. (2016) and Balling et al. (2016), regarding their similar reports on the effect of UHIs on most of the temperature indices mentioned here for various Iranian cities situated in the southwest of Balochistan.\n\nPasni experienced the hottest weather among the selected cities during the study period, followed by Jiwani. Provided these trends continue in the future, the increased warming would negatively affect the livelihood of the people of these two coastal cities who earn their bread and butter from small-scale fishing. Larger-scale statistics reflect the total fish production of Pakistan exceeds 55 000 metric tons, enlisting Pasni and Jiwani as the major fish hubs of Pakistan after Karachi and Gwadar. The Indian Ocean remains a source of fishing in southern, coastal regions of Pakistan (Bonfil 1994).\n\nThis resulted in the annual mean precipitation quantity for these two cities to be many times larger than the two coastal cities, Pasni and Jiwani, during very wet days than during extreme wet days. Being the coastal city, however, Pasni experienced continuous wet periods, as depicted by the changes in the SDII, referred to as annual total precipitation amount divided by the number of wet days during the analysis. Temperature and rainfall trends of the coastal areas may lead to further studies to associate these trends with an increasing trend of sea surface temperatures, since the findings of Rajeevan et al. (2008) supported the hypothesis that the increasing trend of extreme rainfall events in the past decades could be associated with the increasing trend of sea surface temperatures and surface latent heat flux over the tropical Indian Ocean.\n\nElevation had a significant impact on the precipitation received by the cities of Balochistan. Because of its high elevation, Khuzdar had higher values of R10 and R20, followed by Dalbadin, the midland-located city. Because of the lack of water storage facilities in Balochistan, water generated from rain on the highlands runs to the lowlands as a flash flood. This water is hardly useful for agricultural purposes in the midland areas in the neighborhood of Dalbadin, which experienced a warmer climate than Khuzdar. Increase in atmospheric temperature affects crop water requirement because of the increased solar radiation and humidity. Increased crop water requirements will put a burden on the already-water-scarce region of Balochistan, which is on its way to agricultural productivity through construction of a Head Regulator at Taunsa Barrage on the Indus River to put water into the Kachi Canal. This canal is about 500 km (300 km lined portion in Punjab and 200 km unlined portion in Balochistan), with a target distribution system of 1500-km length within Balochistan to provide a sustainable irrigation system to the province.\n\nThe majority of the indices showed warming trends, but there also were notable incidences that reflected cooling trends in Balochistan. For example, the selected region experienced the maximum percentile of cool nights during 1995, 2001, 2008, and 2014. There was a 0.05% regionally averaged cooling trend (extracted from cool night index data) in the region for the analysis period. There was an increase of 0.96 cool nights per decade in the region. Although there was an overall regionally averaged negative linear trend (in percentage of days, −0.037%) for the analysis period, the selected cities in the province experienced the most frequent cool days during the years 1983 and 1992. The lowest averaged annual temperatures of the coldest days for Pasni, Jiwani, Dalbadin, and Khuzdar were 3.5°C in 1991, 3.5°C in 2008, 4.5°C in 2008, and 4.6°C in 1984, respectively.

With a fully functioning Gwadar port, the population of the coastal areas of Balochistan and inland activities of various businesses will increase, posing a threat to the environment because of their anthropogenic activities, ranging from fishing and industrial operations to heavy traffic on road and rail networks through land-use/land-cover change."
