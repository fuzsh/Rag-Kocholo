        "text": "The El Niño Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, is a fluctuation between below-average and above-average sea surface temperatures in the equatorial waters of the Pacific Ocean, occurring every two to seven years. Both the warm & cold extremes of ENSO have significant impacts on global weather patterns, and we are no strangers to that here in Texas.\n\nAfter a rare “triple dip” of La Niña conditions for several years, The “El Niño” phase of this fluctuation began in June of 2023, and it has been intensifying ever since. This is now the 5th strongest El Niño on record, and the first “Super El Niño” since 2016. What could that mean for us here in “Flash Flood Alley” as we enter our spring rainy season? To answer, let’s start with the difference between El Niño and La Niña, where we stand now in early 2024, and what these strong El Niño events have brought in the past.\n\nEL NINO VS LA NINA\n\nLa Niña happens when cooler than average sea surface temperatures develop in the Pacific Ocean. That changes the behavior of the jet stream winds in the northern hemisphere, usually keeping moisture & storm systems farther to the north during the fall, winter, and spring seasons. Consequently, the southern U.S (and Texas) end up warmer and drier than average. La Niña also tends to destabilize the polar jet stream which can send extremely cold air farther to the south than usual.\n\nEl Niño is the opposite. When warmer than average waters are present in the Pacific, the storm track stays farther to the south. For Texas, that usually spells cooler & wetter than average weather from fall through spring.\n\nLA NINA’S DEVASTATION\n\nAs mentioned, we have spent the last few years under the influence of La Niña. It began in September of 2020, ended in March of 2023, and brought significant negative impacts to Texas along the way. It contributed to a weaker & unstable polar jet stream which eventually unleashed the coldest air since the late 1980s on Texas during the third week of February 2021. The extreme cold and multiple winter storms that week crippled the Texas power grid and other critical infrastructure. As La Niña continued, another record-setting cold snap developed ahead of Christmas 2022.\n\nAnother major consequence of the long-lasting La Niña was drought and extreme heat. In Central Texas, the lack of rainfall has been persistent, and it has added up ever since La Niña began back in 2020. Below are a few cities and the rainfall deficit accrued since August of 2020.\n\nRAINFALL DEPARTURE BELOW AVERAGE SINCE 8/01/2020\n\nABIA: -11.18”\n\nLlano:-14.43”\n\nAustin:-17.51”\n\nBurnet:-21.17”\n\nTaylor (Wilco): -29.33”\n\nFredericksburg: -32.43”\n\nKerrville: -42.42”\n\nIt’s no surprise that where the rainfall deficit is greatest, drought continues to be extreme. Here’s the latest drought monitor for Central Texas.\n\nThe lack of rainfall also played a big role in pushing temperatures much higher than they otherwise would have been during the summer months. Moisture helps absorb some of the summer heat, and without it, Austin recorded its 2nd and 3rd hottest summers on record in 2023 and 2022 respectively. Our main water storage reservoirs, Lake Travis and Lake Buchanan, have also seen significant declines in water levels since 2019. Lake Travis is below 40% capacity for only the fourth time since the dams were built in the 1940s & 1950s.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED DURING OTHER SUPER EL NINO EVENTS?\n\nWe’ve been keeping track of ENSO since about 1950, and since then, there have been five other “Super El Niño” events. Here are the affected years that we’ve investigated:\n\n1965-1966\n\n1972-1973\n\n1982-1983\n\n1997-1998\n\n2014-2016\n\nThose five other super El Niño events covered a total of 11 years. After investigating each of those 11 years in Central Texas, there are a few interesting observations.\n\nNot all of these years produced above-average rainfall in Central Texas, but at least one year during each El Niño event DID produce above-average rain locally, and more often than not, flash flooding\n\nSix of these years produced above-average rainfall, two produced near-average rainfall, and three of these years came with significant rainfall deficits.\n\nOf the wetter years, heavy rain & flooding events occurred even after El Niño had ended. I say this to highlight that while El Niño is expected to end by May or June of 2024, its effects may linger into the fall of 2024 as well.\n\nLet’s zero in on the wetter years and the turbulent weather that occurred locally.\n\n1965\n\nAustin averages about 36” of rain in a calendar year, and in 1965, more than 40” of rain was measured. Similar to what we are seeing this year, the winter of 1965 came with quite a bit of rain in January and February. Above-average rain fell in May before a quiet summer arrived. Rain ramped up again in the fall, especially in September when 4”+ fell in Austin in just one day. It’s likely that some flooding occurred then, though I was unable to find any reports locally.\n\n1973\n\nThe first half of 1973 was relatively unremarkable with near-average rain accumulation through the summer, though there was a devastating tornado that spring in Burnet that destroyed dozens of homes and businesses. Rain really ramped up in the fall when more than 16” of rain came down between late September and mid October, including two days where rain totals exceeded 4”. This resulted in some significant flooding. October 1973 was Austin’s 7th wettest October on record.\n\n1983\n\nThis is the least remarkable of the wetter Super El Niño years. Near to slightly above average rain at Austin’s climate reporting sights was spaced out evenly throughout the year with no significant flooding reported. December of that year, however, came with one of the worst arctic air outbreaks in Texas history.\n\n1997\n\nAn easy start with near-average weather in early 1997 quickly transitioned to a very active spring season. Rain and storms ramped up in May especially which ended with the infamous tornado outbreak on May 27th, including the F5 Jarrell tornado which is still the last F5 or EF5 tornado to hit Texas even 27 years later.\n\nAdditional rain in June and again in the fall of 1997 left Austin with a surplus of 10” of rain for the year.\n\n1998\n\nThis was an interesting year among these examples as it started off with near-average rain in Austin before the rain almost entirely shut off by late spring. By the end of the summer, there was a 10”+ deficit in rainfall.\n\nThe wettest fall season on record for Central Texas kicked off in September with Tropical Storm Frances, a bit of an anomaly among our super El Niño years. Frances dropped 2-5”+ of rain, and that extra moisture in the soil likely made flooding in October that much worse.\n\nMore than a foot of rain fell in Austin in October 1998, the third wettest October in Austin’s history. Most of that rainfall come down in one day with 6.24” measured at Camp Mabry on October 17th, but portions of Hays, Comal, and Caldwell counties had as much as 20-30” of rain on/after the 17th. That led to devastating amounts of water flowing downstream along the Guadalupe River and Colorado river with widespread damage and numerous lives lost. You can find a full summary of the October 1998 flooding from there National Weather Service .\n\n2015 & 2016\n\nFor anyone that has lived in Central Texas for more than a decade, you know first hand what the strongest El Nino on record meant for rain locally. The early 2010s were the drought of record locally with exceptional drought across Texas finally giving way to drought relief in the mid-2010s. In 2015, as El Niño was peaking, extreme rainfall arrived in several doses leading to the infamous Memorial Day Weekend flooding in Austin and the Halloween Flood later that year. 2015 was Austin’s 2nd wettest year on record with a surplus of more than 20” of rain. Full summaries of those flood events can be foundand .\n\n2016 was also a wetter than average year for Austin with quite a bit of severe weather during the spring season, but otherwise didn’t come with significant flooding for Central Texas.\n\nWHAT WILL 2024 BRING?\n\nEl Niño has already aided in getting meaningful rainfall to soak much of Central Texas this winter alone. Austin had its 5th wettest January on record this year with more than 6” of accumulation, and as of this writing, February is looking active as well. This rain hasn’t been evenly distributed though with the Hill Country still in extreme drought.\n\nAs we get into the spring season, past Super El Niño years all have something in common; the likelihood for heavy rain (and flooding) ramps up in May. That’s still a few months away, and there is no reliable way of looking that far into the future with our current forecast limitations. However, it’s safe to assume that with El Niño conditions persisting through the end of the spring season, we’ll likely see much more active weather than we’ve seen in our last few spring seasons. The Climate Prediction Center does offer general 3-month outlooks, and the current outlook through April gives Texas near or slightly above average rain chances.\n\nPOTENTIAL BENEFITS TO THE HIGHLAND LAKES\n\nLake Travis and Lake Buchanan both serve as water storage reservoirs for Central Texas. Both have seen steady declines in their water levels for the last 5 years with Lake Travis now at its lowest level since 2015. El Nino has previously, and could again, bring a significant boost to our local lakes. Here is where we need rain to fall for water levels to increase:\n\nMany El Niño seasons in the past have quickly replenished our water storage. The Super El Niño of 1965 brought 40-50 feet of water to Lake Travis in a short period of time. In 1973, already high lake levels were pushed higher by El Niño’s rainfall. 2015’s flooding took Lake Travis from 623 feet of elevation to 671 feet in just five months. Even more recently, the last time we had El Niño conditions was in the fall of 2018. That October, Lake Travis rose from 653 feet to over 700 feet in just a few days courtesy of extreme flooding along the Llano River. Here's what that looked like from the same vantage point on Lake Travis.\n\nEl Niño rainy seasons typically offer the best environment to get heavy rain to fall from the Hill Country through West Texas due to much higher pacific moisture values meeting up with the usual influx of Gulf of Mexico moisture. While nothing is guaranteed, that means spring and/or fall of 2024 will be our best opportunity to replenish the lakes in more than five years.\n\nPOTENTIAL SUMMER BENEFITS\n\nEl Niño itself has very little influence on summer weather in Texas. However, heavy rain from El Niño in the springtime can help significantly reduce temperatures during the summer months.\n\nOur normal average temperature in Austin during our three summer months is 85 degrees. That’s the average of high temperatures and low temperatures between June 1 and August 31. Of the Super El Niño years discussed, all of them except 1998 and 2016 have had cooler than average summers, some by significant margins. To put it in perspective, the average temperature in the summer of 2023 was 89.5, our 2nd hottest in history. We had 71 days of triple-digit heat in Austin in 2023 while all but one of the other Super El Nino years had 10 or fewer triple-digit days.\n\nIf we see significant rain this spring with the help of El Niño, we would see a much more mild summer in comparison.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWhile it’s not a guarantee that we see active weather and beneficial rainfall from the ongoing Super El Niño in the Pacific, history tells us that it’s more likely than not that we’ll finally get the rain we’ve been needing for years now. There are many benefits that could come from a spring or fall soaking, but it doesn’t take much rain in Central Texas to see significant flooding. Some of our most significant floods have occurred during El Niño or Super El Niño events. That will be something that’s closely monitored along the way. As always, you can check into our for updated forecasts. I have a feeling we’ll have plenty to talk about between now and the summer."
