Norm.: Monthly precipitation total divided by the mean monthly precipitation, computed using monthly data from 1951-1980.\n\n*Deg. Days: Computed daily as the departure of the daily average temperature from 65°F and aggregated over the entire month.\n\n*Heating degree day (HDD): Each unit corresponds to a -1°F departure of a daily average temperature from 65°F.\n\n*Cooling degree day (HDD): Each unit corresponds to a +1°F departure of a daily average temperature from 65°F."
