        "text": "Lloyd Arthur learned a lot growing up in a farm family in West Texas.\n\nHis grandfather endured the 1930s Dust Bowl and told him how to come back from catastrophic crop losses, a lesson he’s thankful he hasn’t had to utilize too often. His father’s stories from the 1950s taught him that there will be years that are either too wet or too dry.\n\nThen there are the lessons Arthur has learned firsthand as a cotton farmer in Ralls, which is that the weather on the South Plains and Panhandle has become almost too unpredictable to manage.\n\n“There’s no normalcy to the weather pattern, except that it goes from one extreme to the other,” Arthur said.\n\nTexas farmers are no strangers to extreme weather conditions, whether it’s haboobs blowing dirt around as they plant, and hail or heavy rain that comes too late and damages emerging crops. Conditions got even more damaging in 2020 as the Lone Star State experienced seven of the 16 Billion-Dollar Disasters recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nWest Texas farmers started last year late after heavy rainfall delayed their planting schedule in May, followed by extreme hail storms that forced them to replant.\n\nIn June, 2.88 inches of rain fell in Ralls but was quickly followed by a July heat wave that broke records around the region. There were 11 consecutive days where temperatures were 100 degrees or higher, while nighttime temperatures struggled to get lower than the mid-70s. The Lubbock region broke records for both the highest daily temperatures and warmest low temperatures.\n\nFor some, the proof should be in the numbers. But despite experiencing the struggles firsthand, some Texas farmers are still skeptical about climate change and whether it’s worsened by man-made causes.\n\nKatherine Hayhoe, a lead climate scientist and researcher at Texas Tech, has heard plenty of objections to climate science throughout her career, most of them rooted in political ideologies or religious beliefs. In the past few years, however, Hayhoe has had more people in the agriculture community who want to know more and understand what is causing it.\n\n“They’re a lot more interested now in talking about what’s going on than they were 10 years ago,” said Hayhoe, co-director of the Climate Center at Tech. “The level of interest is remarkably different. When you’re talking to producers or farmers, they’re very in touch with and aware of natural variability.”\n\nHayhoe doesn’t think farmers are to blame, saying that most of the producers she speaks with want to keep their land in prime condition.\n\n“I don’t think I’ve met a single farmer who wouldn’t agree they need to be good stewards of the land,” said Hayhoe. “The big myth we bought into is climate change doesn’t matter, it only matters to future generations and polar bears. We’re starting to recognize in Texas that’s not true, and we can see it’s affecting us.”\n\nThe weather patterns have already been affecting cotton and other crops in the region. In 2020, an unseasonably warm fall wilted pumpkins in Floydada and cotton yields were lower than expected at the start of the year.\n\nArthur recalled that 2010 was one of the wetter years he’s seen, while 2011 was a disaster due to drought. While Arthur knows the weather is changing, he sees it more as a cycle than climate change. This year also started off drier than average, thanks in part to the lingering La Nina weather pattern that typically brings dry conditions to the southern U.S.\n\nBut some timely, heavy rains have helped alleviate some of that for now, with Lubbock actually well above its year-to-date average of 2.23 inches of precipitation thanks to a potent storm that dumped more than an inch on the Hub City early this week, while Amarillo is just 0.13 of an inch shy of its year-to-date average 2.37 inches thanks to rain and snowfall this winter, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“The weather changes every year and every season,” said Arthur. “I know there’s records showing here we’ve had some of the warmer springs and winters, but some of this is naturally occurring over time. It comes and goes.”\n\nThere is a reason cotton has been the top commodity in the Texas High Plains for decades — the area grows high-quality cotton thanks to the crop’s need for a lot of heat that stays below 100 degrees, sunshine and a long period before the first freeze.\n\nThe region produces 66% of the state’s average total cotton and cottonseed and about 30% for the nation, and about 95% of the nation's organic cotton crop is grown on the High Plains, too.\n\nHowever, cotton quality begins to lower as temperatures go above 100 degrees, and even though the crop can still grow in up to 110 degree weather, it needs the precipitation and low nighttime temperatures to help.\n\nArthur’s yields dropped for a second year, as did the quality. He lost about 1,500 acres of irrigated cotton from his 2020 crop in a hail storm on June 4 and planted some sorghum as a back-up crop, but decided not to invest in replanting cotton on some areas of his farm.\n\nThe whole year ended up being one of the driest years in the region's history.\n\nAlways determined to bounce back, Arthur and other farmers have adapted to different farming and conservation practices to make their land and crops more sustainable. A big key to this is stretching water as much as they can, especially when it’s coming from the declining Ogallala Aquifer.\n\nThe aquifer can allow for irrigation where it’s needed, and apps are now available to monitor how much water is being used where and to move where the water is going to, without wasting a drop. The High Plains Water District, which oversees use and conservation of aquifers in the 16-county service area, has added an interactive map to their website that gives up-to-date information on water levels, which also helps producers use the water wisely.\n\n“We’re being more efficient with the water we’re using than they were 40 years ago when I was a small lad on my dad’s farm,” said Arthur. “If we had some of these techniques years ago, our water supply would probably be better.”\n\nThe weather manages to hit another growing agricultural giant — the grapes that have helped make Texas the fifth largest wine producing state.\n\nWine grapes were practically nonexistent in 1960s Texas when Clint “Doc” McPherson planted vines as an experiment and later co-founded Llano Estacado Winery, one of the first in Texas. The High Plains has since blossomed into the biggest wine-making region in the state, producing 80% of Texas grapes annually.\n\n“We pretty much have a handle on what we can grow up here to make this an area that’s known for wine,” said Kim McPherson, owner and winemaker for McPherson Cellars in Lubbock.\n\nMcPherson has been in the business for over 40 years and grew up watching Doc, his father, work. The weather has changed to him, as he remembers how early and mid-70s were cooler in the summer but now it’s warmer and stays warm at night too. McPherson said the hail storms have changed too — now they happen every year and are more dangerous.\n\n“Now some of these guys get hailed on and it just shreds the vineyard,” said McPherson. “Is that a thing of climate change? It’s got to be part of it; the weather has changed drastically.”\n\nThe summer of 2019 proved to be a hurdle that McPherson wasn’t expecting. The vineyard didn’t get much damage from hail in June, but what did hurt the vineyard were several days of extreme heat.\n\n“We had four days that were 115 degrees, and we’ve never seen that,” said McPherson. “What we learned was that the vine shuts down and when it does, there’s no more sugar production to the fruit. The vine flipped itself and started putting sugar down into the roots.”\n\nThe best way to navigate the weather changes, McPherson advised, is to use past lessons to get ahead of possible disasters and to grow varieties that fit the climate. Because of how dry and hot conditions got last year, McPherson had his vineyard workers begin watering in January.\n\n“There’s a lot of ways to correct all this and fight it,” said McPherson. “It’s just about what Mother Nature hands you.”\n\nEven though farmers may not all agree on climate change and why it’s happening, most of them still strive to take care of the land. Arthur said he thinks climate change is happening to an extent, but his main goal is to be sustainable while also managing the economics and finances of his business, a side of the issue he said people need to understand more.\n\n“We make our living from the land, so we’re not going to do anything to adversely change to badly taking care of it,” said Arthur. “We try to do our best to take care of it. We’re sustainable, and we want to leave it as good or better than what we found for the next generation.”\n\nArthur added, “Man is not expert on everything, we don’t know if what we’re doing or not doing will be better for the future. All we can do is take what we have at our disposal and do the best we can with what we have.”"
