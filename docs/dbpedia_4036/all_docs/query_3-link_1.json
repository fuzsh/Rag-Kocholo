        "text": "The U.S. Drought Monitor depicts the location and intensity of drought across the country using 5 classifications: Abnormally Dry (D0), showing areas that may be going into or are coming out of drought, and four levels of drought (D1â€“D4).\n\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor is a joint effort of the National Drought Mitigation Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) produces maps of real-time streamflow conditions compared to historical conditions. The map depicts streamflow conditions as computed at USGS streamgages. The colors represent real-time streamflow compared to percentiles of historical daily streamflow for the day of the year. Click on a streamgage to view more data for that location.\n\nThis map shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Social Vulnerability Index alongside current U.S. Drought Monitor drought designations. CDC's Social Vulnerability Index uses 15 U.S. census variables at tract level (including poverty, lack of vehicle access, and crowded housing) to help local officials identify communities that may need support in preparing for or recovering from hazards, like drought. Learn more.\n\nThe U.S. Air Quality Index (AQI) is designed to communicate whether air quality is healthy or unhealthy. This map displays the AQI at sensors across the U.S. alongside the current U.S. Drought Monitor, as of 10 a.m. Eastern."
