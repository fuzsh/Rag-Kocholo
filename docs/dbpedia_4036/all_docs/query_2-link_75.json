        "text": "Curious about what living in Texas looks like? Sure, Austin and Houston get a lot of love, but there’s plenty of Lone Star State to go around. Our guide to the best places to live in Texas covers all the bases. Moving with kids in tow? No problem; we’ve got you covered. Want a city where you don’t need a car? There are options. Hungry for a superb dining and entertainment scene? We’ll cover that, too. Besides a rundown of cool places to live in Texas, we’ll also go over a few of the need-to-know basics, like overall city vibe, housing costs and options, things to do, and more. But is Texas a good place to live for you specifically? Take a look at these best places to live in Texas to find out.\n\nBest Places To Live in Texas — FAQs\n\nQ: Where Is the Best Place To Live in Texas?\n\nA: There’s no shortage of nice places to live in Texas. Austin nearly always ranks near the top of every list of the best cities to live in Texas, and 2024 is no exception: The city takes No. 1 honors, thanks not just to a hot job market but also to its status as a thriving cultural hub. Besides hosting the iconic SXSW Conference and Festival every year, this Texas town has some of the best restaurants in the state, a legendary music scene, and an innovative tech community that continues to draw the best and the brightest. Big tax breaks for businesses and no state income tax are also attractive features.\n\nQ: What City in Texas Is Safest?\n\nA: What is the safest place in Texas to live? Well, according to Neighborhood Scout, topping the list of the safest places to live in Texas is Mullin, a small community situated in the central part of the state. Ravenna and Pecan Gap rank second and third.\n\nQ: What Is the Most Affordable Place To Live in Texas?\n\nA: Niche rankings report Diboll, Clarksville, and Colorado City as the most affordable cities in Texas (for safety’s sake, we’ve only included cities and towns that have above a C rating). Each has fewer than 5,000 residents and also ranks within the top 100 most affordable places to live in the United States. From this list, however, Wichita Falls, Lubbock, El Paso, and Corpus Christi have the lowest cost of living.\n\nQ: Is Texas Expensive To Live In?\n\nA: Keep in mind that your own cost of living will vary, depending on whether you rent or buy a home, drive your own car or use public transportation, dine out frequently or opt for home-cooked meals — you see where we’re going here. But in general, the Lone Star State’s cost of living stands at 94.2, which is 5.8 percent lower than the nationwide average. Compared with other big states, Texas is affordable — California, for instance, has a whopping 149.9 index, which means it’s nearly 50 percent more expensive to live there than the U.S. average. Florida comes in at a still pricey — but not California-pricey — 103.1. Another factor to keep in mind: Major metro areas are more expensive than smaller towns in the Lone Star State. Texas (like Florida) also does not have a state income tax, which can make a substantial difference in living expenses.\n\nQ: Where Should I Move in Texas?\n\nA: Choosing the best place to live in Texas — or anywhere! — is a personal decision. We suggest making a list of your top priorities, such as affordability, sense of community, good schools, stellar public transportation, a good job market, and any other factors that are important to you. Based on these criteria, dig into our details about Lone Star State locations and evaluate your options for the best place to live in Texas.\n\nQ: Where Should You Not Live in Texas?\n\nA: First things first: Don’t move anywhere that doesn’t meet the majority of your criteria or doesn’t feel safe to you. Beyond these factors, take into account your tolerance for dealing with potential natural disasters like hurricanes along the coast or flash floods, plus how you feel about proximity to necessities and other big deal breakers that might help you determine your no-go cities.\n\nQ: What Part of Texas Is the Best Place To Live?\n\nA: Drawn to a thriving music scene? Check out Austin (also among the best places to live in Texas for singles). Interested in aerospace and aviation? Houston might be your best bet. Want to be immersed in a rich cultural history? El Paso could be calling your name. Bottom line: Texas is a big state, with a lot of big cities and small towns with all kinds of different characteristics. Do your research, and you’re sure to find an area that’s perfect for you.\n\nQ: Where Do Young Adults Move To in Texas?\n\nA: Gen Zers and Millennials have long known about the treasures of Texas, from Spring Break destinations along the Gulf Coast to the cultural nexus of Austin, where the median age is 34.2. In fact, the capital city ranks No. 18 among the top U.S. destinations for young professionals, according to Niche.\n\nQ: What City in Texas Has the Best Healthcare?\n\nA: The “best” healthcare depends on your own personal circumstances and preferences. But Houston is a hub for healthcare — in particular, the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, which is home to world-renowned physicians, researchers, and innovation.\n\nQ: Where Do Families Live in Texas?\n\nA: The short answer: everywhere. From Houston in the east to El Paso’s borderplex at the far west of the state, families enjoy all the amenities the Lone Star State has to offer. Taking the top honors is Cinco Ranch, a Houston suburb, which is rated No. 1 for raising a family.\n\nQ: What Part of Texas Is the Greenest?\n\nA: San Antonio recently took top Texas honors for the most green space in the state — and the No. 15 greenest city in the U.S. But while San Antonio is certainly a standout, Houston, El Paso, and Austin also made the top 22.\n\nQ: Where Is the Warmest Place To Live in Texas?\n\nA: Pretty much every city in the Lone Star State has the potential for hotter-than-hot summer days — particularly in recent years, when temperatures broke records on what felt like a weekly basis. In fact, in May 2024, the small Southwest Texas town of La Puerta hit a record 116 degrees. Yes, Fahrenheit, making it the hottest temperature ever recorded in the state in the month of May. On an average basis, the warmest place overall in 2023 was Rio Grande Village in Big Bend National Park, which hit regular average highs of 110. Here’s hoping Texas’ all-time record will never be broken: a sweltering 120 degrees, set in August 1936 in Seymour and again in June 1994 in Monahans.\n\nExplore the best places to live in Texas — from the big cities of Dallas and Houston to the charming riverfront destination of San Antonio.\n\n12 of the Best Places To Live in Texas\n\nLet’s address the elephant in the room: Texas is huge! If we talked about all the great Texan towns you might enjoy living in, we’d be here for days. So before we go stepping on anyone’s toes, know that we recognize there are heaps of great cities and towns in the Lone Star State. We’ve just narrowed it down to a handful of our favorites (and some of the most popular) to give you a good running start in your search.\n\nAs far as pricing goes, it’s worth keeping in mind how housing costs stack up against the national averages. For rentals, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the U.S. is around $1,700. And the average U.S. home value is around $363,400 — almost 4 percentage points higher than a year earlier.\n\nIn Texas, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is around $1,450, according to RentCafe. But, of course, figures vary, depending on the part of the state you’re looking at. One-bedroom apartments in cities like Austin and Dallas-Fort Worth are on the pricier side, at $1,700 and $1,550, respectively, while average Houston rentals only run around $1,350 per month for a one bedroom. And if you’re in the market to buy, the average home value statewide comes in at around $308,100, a 0.6 percent jump from June 2023 to June 2024.\n\nAll right! Now let's jump into our list of the best places to live in Texas, starting with a longtime favorite: Austin.\n\nEasy access to Lady Bird Lake is just one of the many perks of living in Austin, Texas.\n\n1. Austin, Texas\n\nCost of living: 129.1\n\nAverage rent (one-bedroom): $1,700\n\nAverage home value: $544,600\n\nGreat for: Young adults, families, schools, nightlife, culture, diversity\n\nAustin is an amazing city — if what it offers is what you’re looking for. From being able to experience all four seasons, excellent public transportation, great schools, and a strong job market, to a thriving live music scene, incredible restaurants, and gorgeous green spaces — Austin really is the good kind of weird. People here are young, social, and hip, and there are a lot of them — which means crowds and traffic (perhaps one of the few downsides to living in Austin). Still, it’s one of the best places to live in Texas for young adults and families.\n\nFood has a lot to do with that reputation. Austin is renowned for its creative dining scene from food trucks to BBQ joints and farm-to-table places. Popular local faves include Franklin Barbecue, for the obvious, and Odd Duck, which began in a trailer in 2009.\n\nThe city’s popularity has also made Austin an expensive place to live. Austin’s cost of living is about 37 percent higher than the rest of Texas overall and 29 percent higher than the national average. The main reason for this is housing, which is 89 percent more expensive compared to the national average.\n\nThe average home value in Austin is around $544,600, and the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment across the city is around $1,700. However, average rent in the coveted downtown Austin neighborhood jumps to more than $3,100 a month (eek!).\n\nMany Dallas residents consider the Metroplex (Dallas-Fort Worth area) to be the best part of Texas to live in.\n\n2. Dallas, Texas\n\nCost of living: 100.2\n\nAverage rent (one-bedroom): $1,550\n\nAverage home value: $318,700\n\nGreat for: Young professionals, families, students, diversity, nightlife\n\nAs the ninth-largest city in the country, Dallas makes good on the Texan promise of going big. This metropolis offers a little bit of everything — making it a perfect pick for folks who love to sample the buffet of life.\n\nSpeaking of buffets, the culinary landscape in Dallas offers amazing innovation and diversity, with a focus in recent years on farm-to-table practices and creative cuisine. Check out Mirador, which reopened a year ago after a pandemic hiatus, atop a downtown high-rise — fittingly, Mirador means “lookout.”\n\nWith B-rated public schools and nearly 40 colleges and universities, Dallas couldn’t hide its studious side if it tried. It’s definitely one of the best cities to live in Texas for families with young kids and college students.\n\nThe job market is pretty solid, as well, with top industries including business and financial services, health services, and information technologies — plenty of options when it comes to employment.\n\nAnd as expected, a city as diverse as Dallas serves up a heaping variety of housing options. There is something for everyone here, from historic homes to high-rise apartments — and they are generally fairly affordable.\n\nThe average home value in Dallas is right around $318,700, about $45,000 less than the national average. And monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment is around $1,550 — but certain Dallas neighborhoods edge into the $3,000s and above.\n\nThe city’s decent public transit system can get you around in a pinch, but it’s still best (and most convenient) to have a car. On the plus side, those cars deliver Dallas residents to everything the city has to offer, from theater and live music at the AT&T Performing Arts Center to family outings at the Dallas Zoo.\n\nBusy freeways are a hallmark of Houston — but green space is abundant in the city, as well.\n\n3. Houston, Texas\n\nCost of living: 96.9\n\nAverage rent (one-bedroom): $1,350\n\nAverage home value: $272,100\n\nGreat for: Families, young professionals, retirees, space fans, diversity\n\nIf you take I-45 south from Dallas and drive (and drive and drive), you’ll find yourself in lovely Houston, Texas. This culture-rich metropolis, the fourth-largest city in the U.S., offers world-class dining, pro sports teams, rave-worthy Texas BBQ, and enough entertainment options to make your head spin. If you decide to call Houston home, nobody would be surprised. The city is also full of perks for residents 65+, thanks to myriad volunteer programs, medical centers, and senior discounts. No wonder it’s considered one of the best places to live for retirees.\n\nHousing costs in “Space City” are generally decent, with the average home value sitting below the national average at $272,100. And according to RentCafe, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Houston is about $1,350. Of course, there are pricey parts of town where you’ll see that average rent increase by more than $800 a month.\n\nWhile housing costs in Houston are lower than in Texas overall, the cost of living in this Southern city is 3 percent higher than the rest of the state — especially when it comes to groceries and transportation — and 3 percent lower than the U.S average. Generally, though, Houston offers a solid bang for your buck, so if you can take the heat and humidity (and traffic), you may have found your own best part of Texas to live in.\n\nDining in Houston means experiencing a thriving culinary scene with everything from authentic Japanese and Italian restaurants to modern steakhouses. We love Nancy’s Hustle, a cozy east-side bistro with a phenomenal drink selection. Order the Nancy cakes — savory pancakes with smoked trout roe.\n\nAs one of the top 10 cities to buy a house in the country, it’s no wonder Plano is one of the best places to live in Texas.\n\n4. Plano, Texas\n\nCost of living: 111.7\n\nAverage rent (one-bedroom): $1,725\n\nAverage home value: $533,000\n\nGreat for: Families, young professionals, schools, job market, diversity\n\nPlano is a well-manicured suburb in the Dallas Metro Area, about 20 miles north of the city. It has a dense suburban vibe and population close to 290,000, based on U.S. Census Bureau estimates. And according to Niche, Plano is one of the top 10 cities to buy a house in the country — unsurprising once you learn this suburb scores big on everything from schools and family-friendliness to nightlife and diversity. Plus, in Plano, you’re close to all the big-city amenities in nearby Dallas.\n\nHowever, expect to pay more than what you would in Dallas. According to Zillow, the average home value in this popular suburb is $533,000 — well above both the national and statewide averages.\n\nAnd as for getting around? You’ll definitely need a car in this suburban spot. In fact, folks commuting into downtown Dallas can expect a 30-minute drive at the very least, traffic notwithstanding.\n\nLife in Plano may be quiet, but it’s certainly not boring. Locals enjoy hiking on the many nearby trails, shopping in antique shops, visiting museums, and eating their way through the town’s dining scene. Chains are plentiful, but Plano’s neighborhood gems include CraftWay Kitchen, a New American-style eatery focused on fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Bonus: Plano is a quick half-hour from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nEl Paso, situated on the border with New Mexico and Mexico, is among the most affordable towns on our list of Lone Star favorites.\n\n5. El Paso, Texas\n\nCost of living: 81.9\n\nAverage rent (one-bedroom): $1,050\n\nAverage home value: $224,600\n\nGreat for: Retirees, families, affordability, weather\n\nStraddling the borders of Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico in what’s known as the Southwest borderlands, El Paso is one of the most affordable cities on our Lone Star list. According to Zillow, the average home value is just about $224,600 — considerably lower than the national average. Renters also benefit from lower rates, with the average rent at around $1,050 per month for a one-bedroom apartment. For many residents, the low housing costs make it one of the best places in Texas to live.\n\nIt’s worth noting, however, that the city’s affordability can be offset by its lower earning potential. According to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the median household income in El Paso is only about $55,700, compared to the national median of around $75,000. The top industries center around food, government, trade, and transportation. Young professionals may consider looking elsewhere, but the lower cost of living makes it one of the best places to live in Texas for families and retirees.\n\nAnd speaking of transportation, here’s something to consider: A pro for some and a con for others, this westernmost Texas town is far, and we mean far, from any other cities. San Antonio, the closest big metro area, is an eight-hour drive from El Paso. Still, the city’s above-average schools, good nightlife, sense of community, and blend of Mexican and American culture are big draws for everyone from families to professionals.\n\nMake no mistake, El Paso locals make the most of their city, hitting up the downtown area and popping through the different districts’ many cultural spots, like the El Paso Museum of Art, the McKelligon Canyon Amphitheatre, and the 19th-century adobe-style Magoffin Home State Historic Site.\n\nOutdoorsy types and foodies in El Paso have plenty of options, as well, in this region known to many as the best area to live in Texas. Locals enjoy everything from hiking and rock climbing in the stunning surrounding landscape of mountains and desert to getting their fill of the city’s famous tastes at El Paso’s best eateries. Foodies swear by L&J Cafe, a mainstay since the 1920s (and a hotspot for bootlegging and slot machines during Prohibition!) for authentic Mexican cuisine in a friendly, casual atmosphere. Also must-haves: Kiki’s and, for Tex-Mex, Carlos and Mickey’s Restaurant and Cantina.\n\nThe seaside city of Corpus Christi offers waterfront living without a Texas-sized hike in housing prices.\n\n6. Corpus Christi, Texas\n\nCost of living: 83.5\n\nAverage rent (one-bedroom): $1,150\n\nAverage home value: $225,000\n\nGreat for: Retirees, young professionals, commute times, weather, diversity\n\nAnyone looking for a hint of island life in Texas should put Corpus Christi on their list. Nestled in the southeastern part of the state along the Gulf of Mexico, this coastal city has been a longtime favorite for spring breakers — but there’s so much more to offer in the eighth-largest city that’s become one of the best places to live in Texas.\n\nWeather here is sunny and humid, though the breeze off the water does help to keep temps a bit cooler than you’ll find inland. Summer highs can boil at more than 90 degrees Fahrenheit, but the flipside has winter temps around 65.\n\nCorpus Christi vibes are chill and relaxed, and there’s never a lack of things to do. In fact, Niche rates Corpus Christi with a respectable B+ overall, giving it above-average grades for schools, nightlife, diversity, and as a place for families. It’s also one of the best places in Texas for retirees, as roughly one-in-five residents are above 60 years old.\n\nTop Corpus Christi industries include petrochemicals, military, and tourism — and who doesn’t want to live where other people vacation? Luckily, it’s pretty affordable, too. The average home value is about $225,000, and the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,150 per month — both lower than the national averages. This seaside city is among the best places in Texas to live — particularly for anyone seeking a waterfront lifestyle without the usual huge hike in housing prices.\n\nWhy do we especially love Corpus Christi? Because you can get delicious fresh seafood here — try Doc’s, a 20-year-old gulfside mainstay. Residents also make the most of the outdoors here, thanks to gulf and bay access, the South Texas Botanical Gardens & Nature Center, and the Padre Island National Seashore (home to endangered sea turtles). Corpus Christi is also home to an abundance of parks — in fact, 75 percent of residents here live within a 10-minute walk to a park. It’s truly one of the best places to live in Texas. But as a reminder: Cars are still needed for other necessities, though; the public transportation system is good but not great.\n\nThe San Antonio River Walk is the centerpiece of the city, which is consistently named as one of the best places to live in Texas — and the U.S.\n\n7. San Antonio, Texas\n\nCost of living: 91.3\n\nAverage rent (one-bedroom): $1,275\n\nAverage home value: $262,100\n\nGreat for: Young professionals, retirees, nightlife, diversity, weather, schools\n\nRiverfront attractions are found across the United States, but perhaps none is more iconic than San Antonio’s. The 15-mile stretch along the San Antonio River attracts both locals and tourists to the tune of 9 million visitors per year, drawn to the amazing views, eclectic dining options, live entertainment, and vibrant nightlife.\n\nBeyond a picturesque place to spend your evenings, San Antonio has tons to offer residents. For the working crowd, the city is a scientist’s dream, as major industries include healthcare and bioscience, aerospace, IT and cybersecurity, and the “New Energy” economy. And, as is the case in any city worth its salt, the retail, professional services, and leisure and hospitality industries are thriving, as well.\n\nThe cost of living in San Antonio is slightly lower than the Texas average and significantly lower than the national rate — by nearly 9 percent. The average San Antonio home value is about $262,100, and one-bedroom rentals here go for about $1,275 a month, on average, according to data from RentCafe — giving perfect Texas-sized city life without the premiums of Dallas, Austin, and Houston.\n\nAnd speaking of other major Texas cities, San Antonio is just a hop, skip, and a jump away from Austin, and a leap away from Houston. Dallas is a bit farther, but doable in a day if you start early — maybe to catch the Cowboys. If fall Saturdays are more your speed, both UT and A&M are about an hour-and-a-half away. Of course, you can always stay local for the San Antonio Spurs, if basketball’s your game. Fun fact: The Spurs’ mascot, the Coyote, has been honored as Best Mascot in San Antonio every year since 2018.\n\nThe city’s proximity to the coast has also made San Antonio one of the best cities to live in Texas for young adults on a budget.

Loop your lasso around Fort Worth. This North Central Texas city is often spoken in the same breath as Dallas (which is just 32 miles to the east), but the truth is that these two spots are worlds apart.\n\nDespite being the 13th-largest city in the U.S., Fort Worth maintains a smaller-town vibe, an affordable cost of living, and a seamless stitching of cowboy charm and urban sophistication. We love that this is a place where you can soak in culture at top-notch museums, sip craft cocktails, or nosh upscale eats — and also kick up some dirt at the historic Fort Worth Stockyards, catch a legit rodeo or wild west show, and go to Billy Bob’s Texas — allegedly the world’s largest honkytonk at more than 100,000 acres, complete with a rodeo arena inside. It’s clear why Fort Worth is considered one of the best places to live in Texas for young adults.\n\nAnd as you wander around town, know that Austin ain’t the only place where Texas gets weird.

It also gets good marks for schools, nightlife, and family-friendliness. And if you’re wondering about travel time, Irving is only a 20-minute drive to downtown Dallas. You can take the DART, but you’ll still probably need to own a car for day-to-day convenience.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the average home value in Irving is nearly $357,200. Interestingly, while Irving’s average home value is on par with national numbers, RentCafe lists the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment at around $1,500, a couple hundred dollars below the national average.\n\nAnd although the culture and amenities of Dallas are nearby, life in Irving offers plenty of attractions of its own.
