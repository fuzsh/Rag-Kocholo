Ranch-\n\ners were in town early this week\n\ncomparing notes on the rainfall,\n\nand farmers were finding their\n\ncropland too wet to work.\n\nThe heaviest rain reported was\n\nabout 44 inches which fell north-\n\nwest of Valley Spring Monday af-\n\nternoon. Valley Spring itself had\n\nabout 3.70 inches since Saturday,\n\nmost of which fell in several good\n\nshowers. “I have never seen such\n\ngood rains at this time of year,”\n\nMrs. W. M. Buntyn said.\n\nThree inches were reported\n\nfrom the Shirley Willims ranch\n\nat Granite Shoals Lake since Mon-\n\nday, coming in two rains of about\n\n14 inches each; The Kassel\n\nMoseley ranch south of Castell\n\nreceived 4 inches since Saturday,\n\n“a wonderful rain that really puts\n\nour pastures in good shape for a\n\nwhile.”\n\nMrs. Belle Smathers said she\n\nhad received 2.60 in spotted rains\n\nbut “they were just what we\n\nneeded.”\n\nAmounts ranging up to almost\n\nthree inches fell in a downpour\n\nin the Cherokee area Tuesday af-\n\nternoon.\n\nIn the city of Llano, only 1.01\n\ninches were recorded during the\n\npast week with .99 falling Mon-\n\nday and .03 on Tuesday. The high\n\ntemperature in Llano for the past\n\nweek was only 94 with a mini-\n\nmum of 66 degrees on Monday\n\nmorning.\n\nMark A. Moss reported that\n\nonly .65 inches fell at his house\n\nin the Oxford area; however, at\n\nthe south side of his ranch, .90\n\ninches fell; and at the home of\n\nMrs. A. F. Moss, there was 1.20.\n\nHe said that most of the water\n\ntanks could still hold more water.\n\nThe good amount of pasture veg-\n\netation held the water and kept\n\nit from running into the tanks,\n\nor from running off the land,\n\nMoss said. He had 16.85 inches\n\nduring the first six months in-\n\ncluding 9.60 which fell in June.\n\nThe Colorado River was on a\n\nmoderate rise above Lake Buch-\n\nanan early this week and the\n\nLower Colorado River Authority\n\nofficials said Lake Buchanan was\n\nexpected to continue to rise slow-\n\nly for several days from rains\n\nwhich fell through most of the\n\nColorado River watershed this\n\nweek and the Utter part of last\n\nweek.\n\nJuly\n\nJuly\n\nJuly\n\nJuly\n\nJuly\n\nJuly\n\nJuly\n\nJuly\n\nPreston Johnson\n\nElected Commander\n\nOf F.

The recent payments\n\nwere much higher than last yeaar\n\nbecause of the lower wool price.\n\nCongress has established an in-\n\ncentive level for both wool and\n\nmohair and when the national\n\naverage drops below the establish-\n\ned level, a percentage required\n\nto bring the national average up\n\nto the incentive level is applied\n\nto the net amount received by\n\neach producer.\n\nAn incentive level of 62 cents\n\nfor wool and 70 cents for mohair\n\nhas been set for the 1959 market-\n\ning year which runs from April\n\n1, 1959 to March 31, 1960.\n\n......... aaft\n\nA SMALL PORTION OF THE LLANO CHILDREN thw Ar arican Rad Cross.
