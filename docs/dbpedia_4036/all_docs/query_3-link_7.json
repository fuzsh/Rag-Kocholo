        "text": "1 / 1\n\nStacker\n\nA look across the U.S.\n\nThe diverse climates of the U.S. mean residents can experience a range of holiday weather without breaking out their passports. Within the continental U.S., Monroe County, Florida, at the Southeast tip of the state, reported the highest average December temperature during the past century at 67.6 F. On the other end of the spectrum was Roseau County, Minnesota, bordering Canada, at 7.2 F.\n\nHowever, across both sides of the extremes, temperatures are warming. While that doesn't mean every December will be warmer than the last or the prior century's average, it does mean long-term temperature averages will continue to inch up the thermometer.\n\nWhen did Llano County, Texas experience its warmest December? To find out, Stacker used data from the National Centers for Environmental Information to identify the 15 Decembers with the highest average temperature since 1895. Also included is how that year's temperature compared to the 1901-2000 average.\n\nRead on to see if you lived through the warmest December in Llano County, Texas history.\n\n#14. 2022 (tie)\n\n- Average temperature: 52.0 F\n\n- 3.6 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#14. 1954 (tie)\n\n- Average temperature: 52.0 F\n\n- 3.6 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#13. 2016\n\n- Average temperature: 52.1 F\n\n- 3.7 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#12. 1971\n\n- Average temperature: 52.3 F\n\n- 3.9 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#11. 2014\n\n- Average temperature: 52.6 F\n\n- 4.2 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#10. 2015\n\n- Average temperature: 52.7 F\n\n- 4.3 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#9. 1908\n\n- Average temperature: 52.8 F\n\n- 4.4 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#8. 1921\n\n- Average temperature: 53.3 F\n\n- 4.9 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#7. 2012\n\n- Average temperature: 53.4 F\n\n- 5.0 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#6. 1906\n\n- Average temperature: 54.1 F\n\n- 5.7 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#5. 1922\n\n- Average temperature: 54.5 F\n\n- 6.1 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#4. 1970\n\n- Average temperature: 55.0 F\n\n- 6.6 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#3. 1933\n\n- Average temperature: 55.1 F\n\n- 6.7 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#2. 1984\n\n- Average temperature: 55.7 F\n\n- 7.3 F above 1901-2000 average\n\n#1. 2021\n\n- Average temperature: 60.8 F\n\n- 12.4 F above 1901-2000 average\n\nRead First\n\nStacker believes in making the world’s data more accessible through storytelling.
