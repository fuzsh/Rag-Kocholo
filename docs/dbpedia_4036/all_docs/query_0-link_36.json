        "meta_description": "Abstract. Drought has long posed an existential threat to society. Engineering and technological advancements have enabled the development of complex, interconnected water supply systems that buffer societies from the impacts of drought, enabling growth and prosperity. However, increasing water demand from population growth and economic development, combined with more extreme and prolonged droughts due to climate change, poses significant challenges for governments in the 21st century. Improved understanding of the cascading multisectoral impacts and adaptive responses resulting from extreme drought can aid in adaptive planning and highlight key processes in modeling drought impacts. The record drought spanning 2008 to 2015 in the Colorado Basin in the state of Texas, United States, serves as an outstanding illustration to assess multisectoral impacts and responses to severe, multi-year drought. The basin faces similar water security challenges to those across the western US, such as groundwater depletion and sustainability, resource competition between agriculture and growing urban populations, limited options for additional reservoir expansion, and the heightened risk of more severe and frequent droughts due to climate change. By analyzing rich, high-quality data sourced from nine different local, state, and federal sources, we demonstrate that characterizing regional multisector dynamics is crucial to predicting and understanding future vulnerability and possible approaches to reduce impacts to human and natural systems in the face of extreme drought conditions. This review reveals that, despite the severe hydrometeorological conditions of the drought, the region's advanced economy and existing water infrastructure effectively mitigated economic and societal impacts.",

        "text": "Droughts threaten modern civilizations in a variety of ways (van Dijk et al., 2013; Wilhite et al., 2007). Prolonged dry spells cause depletion of terrestrial water resources, leading to water use restrictions and shortage (Lund et al., 2018), reduced crop yields and loss of pasture (Gupta et al., 2020; Kuwayama et al., 2019), impaired electricity generation from hydroelectric and thermoelectric facilities (van Vliet et al., 2016; Voisin et al., 2020), degradation of water quality (Ahmadi and Moradkhani, 2019), forest loss through tree mortality (Brodribb et al., 2020) and forest fire (Littell et al., 2016), and reduced primary productivity of vegetation (Stocker et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019). These impacts spawn a myriad of second-order effects. For instance, loss of water-dependent electricity generation can reduce the reliability of the power grid (Turner et al., 2021) or shift generation onto resources that cost more to run or emit more carbon (O'Connell et al., 2019). In some cases, the impacts of a local drought can carry national or global implications, such as by increasing crop prices and altering global food trade networks (Lal et al., 2012; Marston and Konar, 2017).\n\nThe need to understand possible impacts from drought is underscored by anticipated intensification of drought in some world regions in the 21st century due to climate change (Cayan et al., 2010; Cook et al., 2018; Trenberth et al., 2014), manifesting large reductions in surface water availability over large portions of the globe (Schewe et al., 2014). In some regions, climate change has already increased the joint probability of hot and dry conditions that produce more severe drought impacts (Sarhadi et al., 2018).\n\nThere is no single quantitative definition of drought (Kuwayama et al., 2019). Drought can be defined by many metrics of water deficit, such as reduced precipitation (meteorological drought) often combined with increased potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture deficit affecting vegetation (soil moisture drought or agricultural drought) and reduced surface water flows, lake levels, and groundwater levels (hydrological drought) leading to streamflow drought and reduced reservoir storage (i.e., reservoir drought) (Van Loon, 2015). Reservoir drought has not been widely studied in the literature (Shah et al., 2024). Shah et al.Â (2024) define reservoir-based hydrological drought (i.e., reservoir drought) as a period when reservoir storage has persistent negative anomalies due to diminished inflow (streamflow drought), increased net evaporation (meteorological drought), and/or water resource management decisions (i.e., storage releases). Because of the importance of reservoirs to water supply resilience (Kuria and Vogel, 2014), irrigation for food production (Biemans et al., 2011), hydropower, and streamflow (Wanders et al., 2015), reservoir droughts can have significant socioeconomic, energy, and environmental implications. The intensity and duration of meteorological drought influences the severity of other types of droughts; for example, a short, intense meteorological drought can result in a severe agricultural drought but not a severe hydrological drought. The impacts of meteorological drought can also be exacerbated by human actions (Van Loon et al., 2016), such as increased diversions from streams resulting in more severe hydrological drought (reduced streamflow) or withdrawals from reservoirs initiating or exacerbating reservoir drought.\n\nBecause extreme drought is rare (by definition), there are a limited number of 21st century case studies available to document and synthesize its impacts. Examining each case is essential to better understand the complex dynamics of drought propagation, the resulting multisector impacts and responses to drought in modern society, and critical lessons learned to better prepare for future droughts. The aim of this paper is to provide such a case study through a detailed examination of the 2008â2015 drought in the Colorado Basin, Texas. This region (Fig.Â 1a) faces significant municipalâagriculturalâenergyâwater nexus challenges and offers a compelling case study for multisectoral drought impact analysis. The paper is organized into the following sections: background on the drought of record, e.g., the basin's hydroclimate, water supply, and sectoral water use (Sect.Â 1.1 and 1.2); data and methods (Sect.Â 2); analysis of multisectoral impacts and adaptive management responses from the drought of record (Sect.Â 3.1â3.3); a discussion of insights into multisector impacts and dynamics, water planning strategies that improve the resiliency and sustainability of regional supply, limitations, and future work (Sect.Â 4); and concluding remarks (Sect.Â 5).\n\n1.1âBasin geography and sectoral water use\n\nThe Colorado Basin spans 800âkm across the central part of Texas and has a drainage area of 102â000âkm2 (Fig.Â 1a). Its headwaters are in the arid northwestern part of the state, and surface water flows southeast towards the Gulf of Mexico. The basin is divided into three water management regions (Fig.Â 1a), marked by diverse hydroclimates and distinct differences in water use, reliance on surface water versus groundwater, and sectoral water demand (TableÂ 1). Here, water use refers to total withdrawals, not consumptive use.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nThe basin's hydrology is characterized by highly variable seasonal streamflow prone to multi-year drought periods (Wurbs, 2021). There is a markedly increasing precipitation gradient from the western upper region (38â45âcmâyrâ1) to the eastern lower region (68â112âcmâyrâ1) (TWDB, 2023a), which greatly influences surface water availability and the ratio of surface water to groundwater use across the basin (TableÂ 1). The sparsely populated, arid upper region has few reliable sources of surface water, has no major reservoirs, and is almost entirely dependent on groundwater sourced from the Southern High Plains Aquifer to supply its large agricultural sector (TableÂ 1). In contrast, the highly populated lower region receives more than two-thirds of its annual supply from surface water. Lower-region reservoirs are the critical supply for the city of Austin's municipal demands and for providing reliable water supply for thermoelectric power and lower-region agriculture. The middle region is heavily reliant on groundwater for agriculture but uses surface water to meet 60â%â70â% of its municipal demand. Overall, the middle region uses less than 20â% of the surface water of the lower region.\n\nWater use and population are also highly unequally distributed amongst the three management regions (TableÂ 1). The sparsely populated, heavily agricultural upper region and densely populated lower region both use more than twice the water of the middle region. Before the drought (2000â2007), the agriculture sector was the largest water user in all three regions, accounting for 99â% of all water use in the upper region and between 50â% and 70â% in the middle and lower regions. Municipal use was the second largest sector, representing 25â%â30â% of annual water use in both the lower and middle regions. Industrial and thermoelectric use was less significant in all three regions, accounting for 3â%â7â% of annual use.\n\n1.2âThe 2008â2015 drought of record\n\nThe 2008â2015 drought is recognized as the drought of record for the middle and lower planning regions in the basin (TWDB, 2022a). Texas uses the âdrought of recordâ framework for water planning where future water supply is determined based on shortages that would occur under a repeat of the drought of record event. The 2008â2015 drought period is characterized by a combination of reservoir and meteorological drought, spanning the time between lower-basin reservoir storage resetting (Fig.Â 1e) and the end of widespread drought conditions (Fig.Â 1c). The drought consisted of two dry periods (2008â2009 and late 2010â2015) separated by a relatively wet year in 2010 (Fig.Â 1c). The drought severity shown in Fig.Â 1c is the US Drought Monitor drought classification index, which is a composite index that incorporates meteorological drought, soil moisture conditions, and surface water impacts (US Drought Monitor, 2023). Before 2008â2015, the region's most severe drought on record took place in the 1950s (TWDB, 2022a). The greater severity and distinctive impacts of the 2008â2015 drought can be attributed to five key factors, including a combination of climate (natural) and human system factors.\n\nRapid onset of extreme drought. A statewide record low Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) (Palmer, 1965) of â8.06 occurred just 14 months into the 2011â2015 period, whereas the drought of the 1950s took 72Â months to reach a PDSI of â7.77 (TWDB, 2017). The PDSI accounts for precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture conditions and is standardized to enable comparison between regions (Alley, 1984).\n\nMeteorological conditions. The 2008â2015 drought featured record meteorological drought combined with prolonged heat waves in 2009 and 2011. Notably, in 2011, the mean temperature during the summer months of June, July, and August reached a record high, about 1.4âÂ°C higher than the previous hottest summer on record (Nielsen-Gammon, 2012).\n\nPersistent reservoir drought. Record low reservoir storage persisted in the basin from 2012â2015.\n\nPopulation growth. The basin's population is 3 times larger, with 80â% of the population increase occurring in the heavily surface-water-reliant lower region, leading to increased population exposure to drought and sectoral competition for surface water.\n\nEconomic transformation. In the 1950s, the basin was a largely agrarian economy, in contrast with the predominantly urban, industrialized economy in the 21st century (TWDB, 2022b). While population growth has increased the population exposed to drought conditions, the diversification of the regional economy has reduced the basin's economic vulnerability to drought because many of the sectors are not highly water-dependent â representing a shift from a climate sensitive to climate insensitive economy (Tubi, 2020). This is discussed further in Sect.Â 3.\n\nThe extensive review and analysis of grey literature related to drought impacts and management responses are novel aspects of this study. We obtained data from a diverse array of publicly available sources to understand and characterize the breadth of multisectoral impacts and management responses in the basin (TableÂ 2). TableÂ 2 provides a description of each data type, citing the temporal and spatial resolutions and the period of record, and links to all dataset sources are in the references.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nMuch of the data were available at annual temporal resolution at the county spatial scale. For these cases, we primarily aggregated the county-level data to determine annual statistics related to drought impact for each of the three regions in the basin. The only exceptions are streamflow and reservoir storage, which are continuous daily data, and water quality, which is only available during reported sampling times. In some cases, the data categories contained an overabundance of records. For example, there were hundreds or thousands of locations with hydrological time series data (streamflow, water quality) and numerous metrics associated with annual, county-level gross domestic product (GDP), employment, and crop data. For these cases, the literature and planning documents helped guide the selection of metrics and locations for analysis. We used the data sources in TableÂ 2 to assess impacts on sectoral water use, reservoir storage, agriculture production, land cover and the environment, the economy, and energy production. The topical focus areas for drought impacts were informed by peer-reviewed literature and regional water planning documents. Costs for sectoral and regional GDP were converted to 2022 dollars using consumer price index data.\n\nTo understand the substantive ways that the drought shaped water planning in the basin, we conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of data in regional water management plans from 2011, 2016, and 2021 for each of the three regions in the basin. Regional water plans in Texas are issued on a 5-year planning cycle and have been mandated by state law since 1997 in response to severe drought conditions in 1995 and 1996 (Wurbs, 2015). An advantage of the relatively short 5-year planning cycle is the ability to respond to recent changes in water availability and sectoral demand. Future shortages are calculated based on the difference between projected future demands (based on estimated sectoral growth) and available supply under drought of record conditions. The 2011 plans were developed before the most severe and prolonged impacts, the 2016 plans were influenced by the record drought in 2011 and persistent drought conditions, and the 2021 plans were created with the full understanding of the drought of record. Our analysis of planning and management responses was additionally supported by publicly available reports from utilities and municipalities in the basin and was also informed by interviews with subject matter experts who have experience in city-, regional-, state-, and utility-scale water planning and management. We quantify water management and planning responses by aggregating county-level data from the regional plants on planned water supply projects. The planned supply data included information about the supply type (e.g., new groundwater wells, reuse, desalination), the unit cost of each supply project for which there were over 1186 individual projects (USD per m3), supply volume, and sector supplied by each proposed project. Water supply costs were converted to 2022 values using the annual consumer price index.\n\nThe last section of results (Sect.Â 3.3) presents a synthesis of our analysis of the multisector impacts during the 2008â2015 drought of record in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG, also known as an influence diagram, is a compact way to present complex causal relationships pictorially; it can also be implemented mathematically to model causal inferences (not performed for this study) (Howard and Matheson, 2005; Shachter, 1986). The influence diagram in Sect.Â 3.3 is a novel product of this study and is based on the review of thousands of pages of regional water planning documents, over a hundred academic papers and reports, and the analysis of 15 datasets (TableÂ 1). As a preview to the detailed influence diagram in Sect.Â 3.3, Fig.Â 2 presents a high-level DAG showing the relationship between drought dynamics, impacts, and planning and management responses. In an influence diagram, each oval represents a state variable, each rectangle represents a decision, and each arrow shows the direction of influence. FigureÂ 2 shows the following relationships. Meteorological drought can lead to soil moisture drought (not shown here but also influenced by evapotranspiration). Together, these two types of droughts lead to streamflow drought (less surface runoff due to decreased precipitation and decreased soil moisture) that in turn can lead to reservoir drought. Reservoir drought can also be exacerbated by soil moisture drought if increased irrigation demand (municipal or agricultural) is accommodated by reservoir storage. Thus, reservoir drought can be produced by both decreased surface water inflows and increased water demand during drought conditions. The combined effects of soil moisture, streamflow, and reservoir droughts cause a wide variety of human and natural system impacts (Sect.Â 3.1) and planning and management responses (Sect.Â 3.2).\n\nDownload\n\nAghaKouchak, A., Mirchi, A., Madani, K., Di Baldassarre, G., Nazemi, A., Alborzi, A., Anjileli, H., Azarderakhsh, M., Chiang, F., Hassanzadeh, E., Huning, L.
