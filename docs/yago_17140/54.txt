A look back at Y&R’s beloved character, Nate Hastings

Nate Hasting was born to Nathan Hastings and Olivia Winters. During Olivia’s pregnancy, she was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer and was advised to terminate her pregnancy to save her life. However, she chose to give birth to Nate Jr prematurely, and she survived the ordeal.

Before Nate’s birth, Nathan had an affair with Keesha Monroe, who was HIV-positive. Olivia was terrified that she and her son might have contracted the virus, but both tested negative. Unfortunately, Keesha’s illness progressed to AIDS and she passed away. This betrayal led Olivia to seek custody of Nate Jr. and cut Nathan out of their lives. However, Nathan kidnapped Nate to spend time with him, but he had a change of heart and returned to Olivia.

Sadly, Nathan died in a car accident before he could reunite with his son. Olivia later married Malcolm Winters but divorced him after his infidelity. She grew close to Malcolm’s brother, Neil Winters, and altered her will to assign Nate Jr.’s custody to Neil in the event of her death. Olivia later developed aplastic anemia but survived after receiving a bone-marrow transplant from her sister, Drucilla Winters. Malcolm and Olivia continued to have disputes over Nate Jr., but Malcolm disappeared during a trip to Kenya. Over the years, Nate Hastings’ persona on Y&R has experienced substantial progress and maturation which has also made him turn villainous.
