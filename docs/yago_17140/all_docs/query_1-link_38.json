        "text": "When you can create fantastically detailed and stunningly realistic visions in the minds of others, your life opens up to a wide variety of new possibilities. The ability for some humans to project images directly into the brains of others has started to crop up randomly across the globe over the past few years, and the world has embraced this emerging reality, both for better and for worse. It can be used to create beauty and joy, but also darkness and terror.\n\nFor 32-year-old science teacher Lukas James, who has no particular goals in life, this ability is just a bunch of hassle that he never asked to have. It’s not that he doesn’t understand the potential involved, but unlike others with this supposed gift, he uses it as little more than a party trick to amuse his friends - that is, until he meets Mandy and her young son,\n\nChuck.\n\nMandy helps him learn about his gift, and together, they give him a reason to strive to be the best version of himself. But just as he’s getting the hang of things, he comes home to find a well-dressed stranger waiting for him in the dark. Stern and uncompromising, Mr. Thorn has a more sinister challenge for Lukas, leaving little room for choice in the matter. Lukas must either learn to explore the darker side of his abilities, or risk putting his new family in danger. Either way, he will have to decide just how far he’s willing to go."
