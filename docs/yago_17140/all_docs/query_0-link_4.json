        "text": "I’d like to see Olivia back for several reasons.\n\nAs for her returning to go after those going after Nate, I don’t see that happening. In fact, I think her reaction would be the opposite - she would question her son’s behavior.\n\nI think she would be unhappy with him for his attempt to betray his cousins and the family business.\n\nI think she would really like Elena who, even Nate has admitted, brought out the best in him. And I’m sure she would not like the way Nate lied to, neglected and disrespected Elena for months. Elena and Olivia share an important life principle - using their medical skills to help others.\n\nI see Olivia looking at her son and regretting that he turned out to be a lying cheater like his father."
