        "text": "Actor Kristoff St. John originated the role of Neil Winters on \"The Young and the Restless\" in 1991. St. John spent close to 30 years on the show and was still portraying Neil when the actor unexpectedly died in 2019. Neil was a beloved character to soap fans and viewers were devastated when he had to be written off the show due to St. John's death. Neil was said to have died of a stroke in his sleep and many characters (co-stars and friends of St. John's) gathered to say goodbye to both the character and the actor (via TV Insider).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough he spent much of his career on \"Y&R,\" St. John had a prolific acting career outside of the soap as well, starring in several TV series and movies throughout his career. The actor won two Daytime Emmys for his work as Neil Winters and received nine additional nominations over the years. He also won 10 Image Awards given out by the NAACP, also for his portrayal of Neil.\n\nThough Neil has been missed on the show for several years now, his legacy lives on through his three on-screen children, who are all major players in the Genoa City scene to this day. Let's take a look at who they are.\n\nBy 1993 Neil Winters had married Drucilla Barber (Victoria Rowell), after she'd stolen him from her sister Olivia and the two fell in love (via Soaps in Depth). A year later, Dru was pregnant with her first child — there was just one little problem. Neil's half-brother Malcom Winters (then Shemar Moore before he left the show) had come to Genoa City earlier that year and Dru had slept with him. She wasn't sure which brother was the father of her baby girl, but she and Malcolm agreed that they would keep their affair a secret and have Neil raise the child regardless of the paternity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot long after Lily's birth, Dru and Neil's marriage hit the rocks. She wanted to work as a model and Neil preferred her to be a stay-at-home mom. The couple ended up divorcing and Drucilla moved away to Paris with their daughter.\n\nIn 2002, Drucilla returned to town with a 14-year-old Lily (Christel Khalil) in hopes that Neil could help her reign in their rebellious teenager. Dru and Neil reconciled romantically and were remarried by 2003. Lily and her mother had a strained relationship and it only grew worse when the truth about Lily's paternity was revealed in 2006. The revelation led to Dru and Neil's second divorce, though thankfully Lily was able to reconcile with her mother before Drucilla's unexpected death in 2007.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeil disapproved when Lily began dating Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard) when she was 19 and he was 31 years old (via Soap Central). Though the couple would go through many ups and downs over the years, including two divorces of their own, the relationship produced two beloved grandchildren for Neil, twins Matilda and Charlie Ashby.\n\nIn 2004, Lily Winters befriended a troubled boy named Devon Hamilton (Bryton James) who'd had a difficult childhood and had run away from foster care. The two teens bonded quickly and as Lily's mother Drucilla Winters got to know Devon, she felt a connection to him too, as she'd had her own rocky upbringing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDru made the decision to foster Devon, and though Neil was skeptical at first, he quickly came around. Soon after, the Winters officially adopted Devon and he became a permanent part of their family (via Soaps in Depth). Neil, Drucilla, and Lily supported Devon through many turbulent times in his life, including the loss of his hearing due to meningitis, and when he made the decision to reconnect with his birth family. Devon ended up having a great father-son relationship with Neil and the two even became business partners in later years — though they did have a brief bump in the road when they fell for the same woman!\n\nIn 2020, Devon donated sperm so that Abby Newman and Chance Chancellor could have a baby, which resulted in the birth of Dominic Chancellor. Though Devon was never supposed to raise the child, he was named as Dominic's godfather and has had difficulty keeping his distance from the little boy. Plus, there are rumors that Devon might not actually be Dominic's biological father, after all (via CheatSheet).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell) gave birth to her son in 2011, she was unsure if the baby's father was her husband Malcom Winters (then Darius McCrary) or his brother Neil — not unlike Drucilla's pregnancy with Lily many years earlier (via Soap Central). Sofia had slept with Neil when she and Malcolm were briefly separated before their wedding. When baby Moses was born, a paternity test confirmed that Neil was the father and Malcolm left Sofia. She and Neil then tied the knot, though the relationship didn't last long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeil was unimpressed with Sofia's scheming ways and she believed that he had feelings for Harmony Hamilton (Debbi Morgan), who happened to be his adoptive son Devon Hamilton's biological mother. Sofia soon divorced Neil and took Moses with her to live in New York City. Both characters were off-screen for several years until Moses returned to Genoa City in 2019 for his father's funeral.\n\nIn 2021, Moses (Jacob Aaron Gaines) came to live in Genoa City permanently and the teenager struck up a romance with Faith Newman (Reylynn Caster), according to Soaps in Depth. Currently, his brother Devon is helping him pursue a career in the music industry after he decided not to go into medicine."
