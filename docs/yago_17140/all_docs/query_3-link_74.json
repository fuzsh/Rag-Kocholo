        "text": "The Young and the Restless has seen many memorable characters come and go over the years. Chief among them is Drucilla Barber Winters, played by Emmy-nominated actress Victoria Rowell, who has earned her own special place in soap opera history by helping to carve out such an incredible character.\n\nShe loved hard, was loyal to those who deserved it, and tried to be the best mother she could be. Here’s a look back at the incomparable Dru, who never gave anything but her very best on The Young and the Restless.\n\nMy Sister, My Rival\n\nDru was living on the streets when a visit to her Aunt Mamie, the Abbott housekeeper, led to a huge break for her — working in the Jabot mailroom. After being busted for shoplifting, Dru went to live with Nathan Hastings. Once illiterate himself, Nathan taught Dru to read. Dru fell for her teacher, but alas, he only loved Olivia, Dru’s sister.\n\nWinters Love\n\nDru fell in love with rising Jabot executive Neil Winters. They split after Dru turned down a ballet opportunity to become a supermodel. A devastated Dru left town after some nude test shot photos made their way into a magazine. Later, she returned to Genoa City and she and Neil reunited and were wed in the Chancellor mansion.\n\nMommie Dearest\n\nViewers learned Dru’s mother, Lillie Belle, had favored Olivia over the years to the point where Dru felt she had to run away. At a family gathering, Dru blasted her mother for her treatment. However, Dru also said that she had found her own path and she had survived her mother.\n\nEnter Malcolm, Exit Dru\n\nDru’s life was changed forever after Neil’s half-brother Malcolm arrived in town. Zonked out on cold medicine one night, Dru welcomed Malcolm into her bed thinking he was Neil. She didn’t know for sure at the time, but the tryst resulted in Dru’s daughter Lily being conceived. Dru’s modeling career took off and she and Lily moved to Paris. Her marriage to Neil was over.\n\nDays Of Wine And Roses\n\nDru came home to help get alcoholic Neil’s life back on track. They re-married in Japan. At Dru’s urging, she and Neil adopted foster child Devon Hamilton. Later, a paternity test revealed Malcolm was indeed Lily’s dad. Dru and Neil endured this twist, but a jealous Dru faced legal consequences after she cut up the clothes of Neil’s business associate Carmen."
