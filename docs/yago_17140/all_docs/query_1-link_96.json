His departure marked the conclusion of a battle with prostate cancer that had lasted more than a year. Even though Preston was anxious for the end to finally come, he never stopped considering others, thinking of ways in which he could bless them. This was the new Preston that so many of us came to know, love, and appreciate. Preston was born in Eastend and took his schooling there. He left the classroom early to begin his working life. His jobs were many and varied, and it provided a good working knowledge in construction, earth moving, surveying up in the Territories, and finally, farming and cattle. His adventure with Agriculture proved to be the best part of his life. “If he had known it was so good, he would have started sooner.” He especially liked the idea of “winters off;” and time off in the California sun. Perhaps his sense of humour is what allowed him to greatly enjoy both agriculture and his friendships. He was quick to reply with a good one-liner when the opportunity arose. It was one of his endearing traits and he used it well. He was also a man of habit and determination. He was constantly looking for ways to improve his health via exercise and diet. He walked more in a day than most could cover in a month. If ice cream was permitted in his latest diet, it was served at 8 PM! Preston never committed to an idea, or gadget, or a machinery purchase until it was thoroughly researched. He was a careful and conscientious man with decisions. He hated ending up with what is best known as “buyers’ remorse.” In retrospect, there were a couple decisions that made Preston much happier than he expected: his first new home bought in Medicine Hat in 2013. He enjoyed the home and location so much that he often said, “If I had known how much I liked living in the desert, I would have moved here 10 years sooner.” It was a move and change to his life he never second guessed. Another decision even more significant in Preston’s life was to follow Jesus. He didn’t jump into it; rather, he weighed the value of such a life changing event methodically, slowly, arbitrarily and open mindedly. He knew what Christianity taught, he had seen it lived by individuals he respected, and it made the possibility of a life forgiven for past mistakes, failures and disappointments a reality for himself. Preston asked Christ to be his Saviour and Redeemer; Now he came to the end of his life with a Promise of God of eternal life, a gift freely given to those who seek Him. Joseph Preston Helle was predeceased by his parents, father George Helle and mother, Jeanne Helle, and a sister, Jacqualine (best known as Tinker). He is survived by his younger brother, Tim and his wife, Jan, and their 2 daughters of Salmon Arm, B.C. and vicinity. Also surviving are three grandnieces residing in Calgary, AB. Burial arrangements will be made in the coming days.
