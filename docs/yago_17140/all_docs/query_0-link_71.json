        "text": "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nOlivia Winters (n√©e Barber; previously Hastings) is a fictional character from the CBS Daytime soap opera The Young and the Restless. The role is portrayed by Tonya Lee Williams, initially from May 1990 to September 7, 2005. She has since returned to the role in 2007, 2008 to 2009 and briefly in 2010, 2011 and 2012.[2] In February 2011, the character of Olivia was seen on The Bold and the Beautiful for two episodes.\n\nMEANWHILE\n\nMeanwhile Nathan and Olivia were still on the outs since Olivia took her mentally ill mother's side against Nathan. So Nathan began an affair with the beautiful Keesha Monroe. Olivia became suspicious, and both Dru and Neil tried to caution Nathan after they caught him with Keesha. Each time Nathan tried to end the affair, Olivia did something to drive Nathan back to Keesha's arms. Nathan finally ended the affair, and he and Liv began trying for another child. Just as Keesha was falling in love with Malcolm, he found out about the affair with Nathan and dumped her. Then Keesha began getting persistent calls from old boyfriend Stan, who later died of AIDS. Keesha went to Dr. Liv, turned out to be HIV positive, and had to tell Nathan. It was about this time that Dru decided to tell Olivia about Nathan's affair with Keesha. Liv was furious, not only that Nathan had betrayed her, but had also endangered her and Nate with HIV. She kicked Nathan out and forbade him to ever see their son again. All 3 of them were HIV negative, but Keesha was doomed now with AIDS. The compassionate Malcolm began seeing her again, helping her through the difficult times as she grew weaker and thinner, and would have otherwise been left all alone to die. Malcolm cared for her so, he brought her flowers and a veil and married her on her death bed so she could at least die happy. Nathan became desperate to see his son, and ended up kidnapping him. Life on the run was rough on Nate, so Nathan finally did the right thing, and was returning Nate to Olivia when he was struck by a car and killed.\n\nMEANWHILE\n\nMeanwhile Nathan and Olivia were still on the outs since Olivia took her mentally ill mother's side against Nathan.
