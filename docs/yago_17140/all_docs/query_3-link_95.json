        "text": "Residence: I live in Durham with my wife, two daughters and awesome dog Rosco.\n\nGuilty associations: UNH director of jazz studies/saxophone professor; producer of the UNH Traditional Jazz Series; Portland Jazz Orchestra; Capital Jazz Orchestra; freelancing\n\nFavorite Seacoast spot: Wallis Sands Beach. Before relocating out here, I had been landlocked for 37 years, so being close to the ocean is something I don’t take for granted.\n\nAverage amount of sleep: 7 hours\n\nFavorite color: Blue.\n\nHere we go:\n\nEDGE: Music. Why do you seek it? Why do you create it?\n\nJorgensen: Music has always been something that enables me to communicate with others without words. You know that feeling when the hair stands up on the back of your neck at a really emotional moment in a piece of music, a film, etc.? That feeling is one of the reasons why I seek and create music, to move my emotions and hopefully share some of that with the audience as well.\n\nEDGE: Teaching. What's the importance of educating the next wave of musicians and/or keeping the spirit alive through the awareness of tradition, etc.?\n\nJorgensen: Teaching for me is both a privilege and a responsibility. I feel privileged that I get to work with such fantastic students at UNH and other students I come in contact with; they continue to amaze me with their talent, hard work, creativity and spirit. I feel a responsibility to my teachers to pass on all of the useful information that they gave to me, as well as share my unique experiences with the students. Teaching is something that I love very much, and I feel fortunate that I get to do what I love as my profession.\n\nEDGE: Speaking of which, you just wrapped up another year at UNH. How'd it go? What brought you to UNH? What do you enjoy about the University and of heading up the Traditional Jazz Series on top of your teaching duties?\n\nJorgensen: It was another amazing year! The beauty of the UNH jazz program is that I am regularly hosting guest performers, composers and historians, so the students and I get the opportunity to meet and work with some of the most prominent names in jazz today. As far as why I took the job, it boiled down to the quality of the students, the program, and the location. The Seacoast is such a nice sweet spot - we are 20 minutes from the ocean, an hour from both Boston and Portland, and close to every outdoor activity you could imagine, so it really seemed like a no-brainer. The Traditional Jazz Series is truly a gem at UNH as it is one of the most affordable ways to hear top-notch performers in New England. It allows me to bring fantastic local, national and international acts for performances right here in Durham.\n\nEDGE: Community. What does that word mean to you? What's the importance of community? What do you appreciated about the community in which you currently exist?\n\nJorgensen: Where we choose to live and who we surround ourselves with defines us to a great extent. Community and family are one in the same to me. The Seacoast as a community is chalked full of talented musicians, artists, writers, chefs, etc. I feel humbled to be a part of this thriving community and want to contribute to it positively in any way that I can!\n\nEDGE: More music to round this out ... What drew you to saxophone? What are some of the coolest places the saxophone has taken you? Where do you hope it takes you down the road (what goals are you in the midst of tackling, etc.)?\n\nJorgensen: I grew up in the 1980s bouncing around the back of my parent’s Chevy Nova with my brother (without our seatbelts on), and at that time nearly every song on the radio had a saxophone solo. I heard that sound throughout my childhood and asked my parents what it was, because I was totally drawn to it. When it came time to pick instruments in fourth grade, there was no choice - the saxophone had already picked me years earlier. I’ve been fortunate to have music take me to Europe, China, and throughout most of the United States. I’m headed to Croatia this July to perform at the World Saxophone Congress in Zagreb and I hope at some point in the near future to start a new small group project with some other local musicians."
