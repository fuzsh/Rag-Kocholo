        "text": "The Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers reveal that Nate Hastings (Sean Dominic) may have to decide what he wants most out of life. Y&R fans know Nate has managed to impress Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), so he’s become a bit of a mentor’s pet and is really loving that.\n\nHowever, Nate has also been trying to climb his way out of the doghouse for deceiving Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle) and being manipulative about Audra Charles’ (Zuleyka Silver) blackmail situation.\n\nAlthough Victoria seems to have forgiven Nate for the most part, their relationship’s about to get tested once again.\n\nThat’s because Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) will take charge at Newman Enterprises and rip away the autonomy Victoria wants.\n\nOnce Victor’s back on the throne, Victoria will pursue vengeance and will try to make Victor wish he’d left things alone!\n\nAs part of Victoria’s plan, she’ll expect Nate to go rogue and join her mission.\n\nOf course, if Nate were to turn Victoria down and stay loyal to Victor, he’d certainly lose his romance with Victoria.\n\nIt looks like Nate will stay loyal to Victoria instead and keep their relationship intact.\n\nThis could give Victoria an opportunity to revisit a plan with a twist.\n\nBack when Victoria was married to Ashland Locke (Robert Newman), she duped him into thinking they were going to start a new company together.\n\nVictoria made a big show about leaving her job at Newman Enterprises and building an us-against-the-world empire with Ashland, but it turned out to be her long con and a way to trick Ashland into giving up $250 million.\n\nNow that Victoria could be genuinely ready to quit soon, perhaps she’ll plan a similar path with Nate – only it could be real this time around.\n\nVictoria may urge Nate to quit with her and help her build a new empire that can go up against the one Victor’s running.\n\nPerhaps Victoria will be willing to serve as competition for her own family’s business since Victor’s about to push her over the edge!\n\nWhatever the case, Nate and Victoria will definitely end up joining forces on some sort of retaliation plot, so stick with us for updates on their reaction to Victor’s CEO news.\n\nThe Young and the Restless spoilers say Victoria and Nate’s romance could deepen as they do their best to make Victor suffer."
