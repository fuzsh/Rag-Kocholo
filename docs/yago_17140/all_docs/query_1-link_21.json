        "text": "OLIVIA Benson has become a powerhouse throughout Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\n\nThough she's often kept her love life private, Olivia has had several love interests in the TV series.\n\nOlivia Benson's dating history\n\nOlivia Benson, portrayed by Mariska Hargitay in the Law & Order franchise, has been involved in numerous relationships throughout 24 seasons of Law & Order: Special Victim's Unit.\n\nLet's take a look at her dating history:\n\nBrian Cassidy\n\nBrian Cassidy, played by Dean Winters, and Olivia Benson dated on and off throughout the seasons.\n\nThe two kicked off their love affair with a one-night stand in season 1 which later turned into a relationship. It ended when Brian left the precinct.\n\nHowever, in season 14, they rekindled their relationship though it wasn't smooth sailing from there.\n\nBrian was framed for sexual assault. After the charges were cleared, the two were able to pick things back up.\n\nIn season 15, Olivia Benson was kidnapped by a serial rapist. Following her rescue, Brian had been her primary support which led to the decision to move in with each other.\n\nThe two later broke up after realizing they had different ideas for their future.\n\nNick Ganzer\n\nUnlike Olivia's relationship with Brian, her relationship with a reporter, Nick Ganzer (Tom McCarthy), was short-lived.\n\nThe two briefly dated after her relationship with Brian in season 1. Olivia realized early on that Nick had sadistic tendencies and ran for the hills.\n\nAndy Eckerson\n\nIn season 5, viewers were introduced to another short-lived relationship. Olivia dated Federal Marshal Andy Eckerson (Craig Bierko).\n\nTheir relationship was mainly off-screen however viewers do get a glimpse of their relationship after it has already ended.\n\nThough the tension lingered as they worked together, Olivia's initial decision to break up with Eckerson was due to his poor police ethics.\n\nKurt Moss\n\nAs viewers know, Olivia Benson hasn't been one to put her relationships on display.\n\nIn season 9, Olivia was in a relationship with journalist Kurt Moss (Bill Pullman).\n\nTheir relationship, mainly off-screen, was introduced in the same episode where their relationship ended.\n\nThings got complicated when their careers interfered with their love life which resulted in them calling it quits.\n\nDavid Haden\n\nOlivia's relationship with David Haden (Harry Connick Jr.) in season 13 showed a promising future for the character's love life.\n\nTheir goals aligned which prompted them to want to take their time with one another.\n\nIn the end, their common career goals were the same thing that ended their relationship.\n\nEd Tucker\n\nLastly, we have Internal Affairs Captain, Ed Tucker (Robert John Burke).\n\nTheir relationship begins in season 17 and rolled onto the following season.\n\nCareer-driven Olivia was hit with an ultimatum when Tucker wanted her to retire simultaneously.\n\nThe two ended their relationship due to their conflict of interest.\n\nIs Olivia Benson dating anyone now?\n\nOlivia Benson is currently single.\n\nHer romantic tension with Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) was evident throughout the series.\n\nViewers often clenched their jaws in hopes the two would finally become a thing. However, Stabler was married throughout his time at SVU.\n\nWhen Meloni left the show to be in Law & Order's spinoff, Organized Crime, it seemed all hope was lost.\n\nHowever, Stabler returned in season 23 as a widowed man. In the following season, SVU fans almost got their wish.\n\nThe two almost shared a kiss which Benson then stopped explaining that it could ruin their relationship.\n\nOnly time can tell whether the two will finally end up together.\n\nWhere can I watch Law & Order: SVU?\n\nThe Law & Order franchise can be watched Thursday nights on NBC. Fans can begin with Law & Order at 8pm EST, SVU at 9pm EST, and conclude with OC at 10 pm EST.\n\nSeason 24 of Law & Order: SVU premiered on September 22, 2022."
