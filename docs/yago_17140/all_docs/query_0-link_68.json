She went to stay with her aunt, Mamie Johnson, who worked as a house keeper for Jabot Cosmetics. In doing so, she sacrificed her dream as a ballerina.\n\nDru was illiterate, but was taught to read by Nathan Hastings, who would later marry Dru’s sister, Olivia. Dru and Olivia never quite got a long due to their mother’s favoritism for Olivia. But years later they reconcilled and became the best of sisters.\n\nDru met and married Neil Winters, but their marriage would see many ups and downs. Over time, Dru would go on to become a glamorous model. She also became close with Neil’s brother, Malcolm. While under the influence of medicine, Dru mistook Malcolm for Neil and sleeps with him. She became pregnant, but decided not to tell Neil about her affair and let him think he was the baby’s father. She gave birth to daughter, Lily, shortly after.\n\nHer marriage to Neil ultimately collapsed after Dru’s desire to have a career and Neil’s desire for her to be a stay at home wife. Drucilla became close good friends with Sharon Newman, Brad Carlton, Victor Newman, and Jack and Ashley Abbott. But she would soon become worst enemies with Phyllis Newman.\n\nDru and Lily moved to Europe so that she could persue her modeling career. They returned years later. Dru saw that Neil had developed a drinking problem and helped him through it. They ultimately fell back in love and remarried. A few years later, Lily and Neil would both learn the truth about Lily’s biological father, Malcolm. They both were devastated, but vowed to make their father/daughter relationship work. Neil, still upset at Dru for lying all of those years, begins a flirtation with Carmen Mesta.\n\nDrucilla showed up at an important Newman Enterprises function, got drunk and slandered Carmen in front of everyone. She later lied her way into Carmen’s hotel room and cut up many of Carmen’s clothes. Drucilla attacked Carmen in the offices at Newman Enterprises. The entire attack was caught on a video tape found by Phyllis, who gave a copy to Carmen. After Carmen gives copies of the tape to the district attorney and her former lover David Chow, Victoria Newman is forced to fire Drucilla. Dru was arrested, and though Neil is very much attracted to Carmen, he ended their relationship to stand by his wife. Dru ended up receiving probation for her crimes, and court ordered therapy.\n\nDru’s attention shifted to focus on Indigo, a night club she and Neil were opening. The night it opens, Carmen was found murdered and her body was discovered behind the club. Dru’s adopted son, Devon Hamilton, is arrested for the crime, and Drucilla believed her sanity is crumbling as she began to see Carmen around town. Drucilla was convinced that Carmen was still alive, and after accidentally injuring Lily, Neil had her voluntarily committed to a mental hospital. After Devon was cleared of all charges, it was revealed that David and her look alike cousin, Ines, were responsible for the hauntings that sent Drucilla over the edge and Crimson Lights worker, Jana Hawkes, is responsible for Carmen’s death.\n\nThings are looking up for the Winters’ family, as Neil received a promotion to the board of directors at Newman Enterprises, Drucilla regains her job, and Lily and Devon receive high marks in their college courses.\n\nAfter Sharon asked Dru to be her maid of honor at her upcoming wedding to Jack, Dru accompanied her and their mutual enemy Phyllis to a cliffside photo shoot for NVP. When Phyllis threatened to use her cell phone to reveal Sharon’s affair with Brad to their friends and family, Drucilla reached for Phyllis’ cell phone, and a brief struggle with Phyllis caused Sharon and Dru to fall off the cliff and into the shallow waters below. A nearly dead Sharon was eventually rescued, but search and resuce personnel only find the remains of Drucilla’s jacket. Her body was never recovered."
