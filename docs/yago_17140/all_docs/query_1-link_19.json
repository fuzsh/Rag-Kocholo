        "text": "Michael Winters, PhD October 4, 2023 Psychotherapy is talk therapy that can help people cope with mental health problems, improve their relationships, and live more fulfilling lives. It is a complex and multifaceted endeavor, drawing on insights from science, art, and philosophy. What are the bases of psychotherapy? How does psychotherapy bring peace? These are […]\n\nOn chilly mornings, Kelly and I will pack a breakfast picnic and take the short drive, or walk, if it’s the weekend and there are no morning appointments, down to Hermann Park. In the park, there is a bridge donated by Tiffany’s Company. We sit at a picnic table near the bridge, drink our coffee, […]\n\nDr. Winters was interviewed about Quarantine Fatigue on Houston Matters Radio show (Houston Public Media 88.7 FM) on April 28, 2020. You can listen here (Dr. Winters interview starts at 4:24), or read the transcript of the interview below. Link to Houston Matters- April 28, 2020 Transcript Craig Cohen: Health officials continue to warn we […]\n\nAre you overwhelmed? I certainly have been for the past few weeks. Though I am seeing my clients (by teleconference), my energy when not counseling clients has lagged, and my focus has been “off.” I have watched a lot of you-tube videos about how to sew a face mask (and I do not sew), and […]\n\n“Rough roads may exist.” I had never seen this sign until recently. The most poetic road sign I have ever seen, it also comes with a concise philosophical warning. I want to hang this sign in my office (and in my consciousness!) Why do we need a reminder that the path in front of us […]\n\nChristmas comfort, to me, is in our family traditions. The old Victorian house which was my mother’s home for 56 years – has 12 foot high ceilings and a large mantle over the fireplace. Each year (for at least the past 55 years) a Nativity Scene was displayed on the mantle and a cedar Christmas […]\n\nWhen you face a difficult decision – one that permanently changes your life and impacts many people, you need clarity and confidence. Perhaps the most difficult decision that many people will ever face is whether to stay in a marriage that is not working for them or to divorce. Since divorce is such an important […]\n\nOlivia, our 5-year-old granddaughter, recently arrived at our house and announced loudly – “It stinks in here!” Olivia was noticing the garlic smell from our just cooked meal. Later Kelly, the woman to whom I am married, was talking with Olivia and said – “It did not bother me what you said about our house […]\n\nJanuary 2018 was not a great month for me. My mom died in early January. She was 90 years old and ready to die — the day before she died I asked if she wanted to talk with a priest, she said, “I have already talked to two different priests!” She had her affairs in […]\n\nDr. Winters comments start about 19 and a half minutes into the program."
