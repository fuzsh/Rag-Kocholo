        "text": "Cedar Rapids\n\nMaurice (Mick) Jerome Lynch, 85, of Cedar Rapids died peacefully in his sleep on Friday, August 2nd, 2024. A visitation will be held at Cedar Memorial Park Funeral Home on Friday, August 9th, from 4-7pm. A second visitation will take place at 10am Saturday, August 10th at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church., with Funeral Mass at 11:00 a.m. Entombment will take place at Cedar Memorial Park Mausoleum.\n\nMick is survived by his stepchildren: Angela (Billy) O’Dwyer with their children Treytan, James, Camille, and Miles; Robert (Dana) Brooks with their son Owen; and Amy (Ryan) Reyhons with their children Mya, Tyler, and Hudsyn. He is also survived by his brother Robert (Julia) Lynch and various distant relatives.\n\nMick's life, marked by his guiding principle of \"plain living and high thinking,\" unfolded in two significant phases: his career as a priest, and his life following laicization and marriage to his beloved wife, Lynda. They shared their home with their dog, Mozart \"Mozy.\"\n\nMaurice Jerome (Mick) Lynch was born on December 31, 1938, in Independence, Iowa, to Roger and Agnes (Glennon) Lynch.\n\nHe graduated from St. John's high school in 1957 and earned a B.A. in history with a minor in music education from Loras College in 1961. Mick was ordained a priest on June 5, 1965, after completing his studies at Mount St. Bernard's Seminary. He furthered his education with a master's degree in music education from the Catholic University of America in 1971 and a master's degree in education (guidance and counseling) in 1973.\n\nMick dedicated his career to education, serving as a teacher, guidance counselor, and principal at various schools, including DeSales High School, Loras College, LaSalle High School, and Wahlert High School. He was particularly passionate about his role in guiding and counseling students. He continued to support parochial schools in Cedar Rapids and Marion with computer operations until his retirement in 2018.\n\nIn 2003, after formally withdrawing from active priesthood, Mick married Lynda. Together, they traveled the world, visiting places like Aruba, Rome, and Ireland. Mick loved capturing these moments with his camera, documenting their travels, his grandchildren's extracurricular activities, and family gatherings. Each year, he would send out a detailed summary of family updates accompanied by images. Mick embraced the role of Santa Claus annually on Christmas Eve, taking the family to see Christmas lights, hosting the evening, purchasing gifts, and setting up decorations around the house. He would also play the piano, sing, and say grace. He had a passion for collecting coins, patches, and memorabilia, and he generously donated to many organizations across the country.\n\nDuring the 2010s, Mick and Lynda spent their winters in The Villages, Florida. They enjoyed playing bocce ball, dining at their favorite restaurants, and watching movies. Mick and Lynda were avid movie watchers, cherishing their time together in their favorite pastime.\n\nKnown for his love of playing the piano and his deep dedication to education and faith, Mick will be fondly remembered by his family and friends."
