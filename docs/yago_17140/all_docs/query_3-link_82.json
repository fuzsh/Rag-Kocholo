        "text": "Scandal-scarred former Trump prosecutor Nathan Wade was slammed by his estranged wife for receiving over $53,000 in paychecks just days before pleading poverty in their Georgia divorce case.\n\nJoycelyn Wade made the accusations against ex-Nathan just a few days before he made a shocking appearance at a primary election victory party Tuesday for his one-time flame Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis — a relationship that cost Wade his job.\n\nWade resigned as special prosecutor in the Georgia election fraud case against Donald Trump on March 15, after a judge ruled Willis could only remain on the case if he stepped down after the duo admitted to being in a romantic relationship while working on the case.\n\nLess than a month later, Wade asked for his alimony and child support payments to Joycelyn to be reduced, claiming that he’d lost his $250 hourly income with the DA’s office.\n\nBut Joycelyn’s lawyers Thursday filed court papers claiming Wade received two paychecks totaling $53,000 from Fulton County for his work on the Trump case — just three days after filing the emergency motion to reduce his support payments.\n\n“There appears to be no plausible explanation other than [Wade’s] deceitfulness to justify his pursuit of emergency relief from this court on April 8, 2024, alleging essentially insolvency when he had received $53,000 only three days prior,” wrote Andrea Hastings, a lawyer for Joyceyln.\n\nJoycelyn said the $53,000 checks from Fulton County were for work he did in October and November 2023 — nearly half a year before he resigned on March 15.\n\n“Thus, it is reasonable to infer that there are further outstanding payments due to [Wade] that likely have not been disbursed as of the current date,” Hastings argued.\n\nHastings called Wade’s motion “baseless” and said he should have to pay for his Joycelyn’s legal fees incurred fighting it.\n\nJoycelyn also previously blasted Wade’s motion to reduce his support payments, arguing he had nearly $500,000 in the bank.\n\nThe Wade’s had agreed upon Nathan’s support payments to Joycelyn in a temporary settlement they reached in January. But in early April, Joycelyn claimed Nathan skipped out on $4,400 in child support and money for Joycelyn’s urgent medical procedures.\n\nWade’s tryst with Willis came into the national spotlight in January after Trump co-defendant Mike Roman sought to have Willis booted from the case and the charges dropped against him based on alleged misconduct that arose from the affair.\n\nThe bombshell allegations derailed the criminal case and prompted hearings where Wade and Willis both testified in the case, claiming they became romantic after Wade began working for Willis.\n\nRoman claimed Willis appointed her boyfriend to the lucrative position and then reaped the benefits of his salary, treating her to exotic vacations.\n\nThe pair separately testified they roughly split the cost of their getaways, with Wade fronting the cost on his credit card and Willis paying him back her portion in cash.\n\nThey couple said they then split in the summer of 2023.\n\nWade was “all smiles” as he attended Willis’ victory soiree after beating out attorney and author Christian Wise Smith to keep hold of her DA post, according to a post on X by Tamar Hallerman, a reporter with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nHowever, Willis isn’t in the clear just yet.\n\nThe 52-year-old prosecutor — first elected to office in 2020 — faces multiple probes by the state and federal legislators over her alleged misuse of taxpayer dollars and her fling with Wade.\n\nLawyers for Nathan and Joycelyn Wade didn’t immediately return requests for comment on Wednesday."
