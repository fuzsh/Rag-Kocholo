        "text": "Originally appeared on E! Online\n\nHarrison Butker is standing by his controversial remarks.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs kicker, who sparked backlash in May for his polarizing commencement speech at Benedictine College, insists that he was “very intentional” with his words.\n\n\"I feel like, seven years in the league, having this platform, I've just decided, You know what, there's things that I believe wholeheartedly that I think will make this world a better place, and I'm going to preach that,” the 29-year-old told reporters at training camp Aug. 7. “And if people don't agree, they don't agree, but I'm going to continue to say what I believe to be true and love everyone along the way.”\n\nThe athlete also said his widely-discussed remarks, which included comments on women’s roles in society and the LGBTQ+ community, came “from a place of love, and not a place of trying to attack or put people down.”\n\nMore from E!

I love my wife. It comes from a place of love.”\n\nButker went on to note that Isabelle is focused on being the “ultimate” wife and mother. “And I love her so much for that,” he said. “She pushes me to be a better husband and a better father and focus on my three children and focus on her over maybe trying to be the best kicker I can be out on that field.”\n\nAs for the criticism he’s received, including the very public diss from Serena Williams at the 2024 ESPYS, Butker said he has “appreciated” the response, saying he “respected all the viewpoints.”\n\nDuring July award show, host Serena took aim at Butker while on the stage alongside her sister Venus Williams and Quinta Brunson.\n\n\"So, go ahead and enjoy women's sports like you would any other sports,\" Venus said, \"because they are sports.\"\n\nSerena quickly added, \"Except you, Harrison Butker.\"\n\nWhile Venus snapped along in approval, Quinta cemented the trio's position, chiming in with, \"At all. Like, ever.\"\n\nShortly after the viral moment, Butker released a statement in response.\n\n\"I thought Mrs. Williams was a great host and applaud her for using her platform to express her beliefs on a variety of topics,\" he said in a statement to NBC News July 12. \"Sports are supposed to be the great unifier and at an event dedicated to celebrating a diverse group of men and women who have accomplished great feats, she used it as an opportunity to disinvite those with whom she disagrees with from supporting fellow athletes.\"\n\nPlenty of stars have spoken out in response to Butker's comments.
