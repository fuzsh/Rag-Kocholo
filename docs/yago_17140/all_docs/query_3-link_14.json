        "text": "Fr. Nathan Hastings was ordained by Archbishop Hebda in the spring of 2020. He looks forward to meeting you, and together, asking Our Lady to obtain an overflowing measure of the incredible grace of God. Fr. Nathan will start at Holy Spirit on July 1.\n\nFr. Nathan grew up in Inver Grove Heights and attended St. Joseph’s Church in West St. Paul. He is the fifth of five children: one brother, three sisters, and himself. He has many nieces and nephews which he loves to spend time with. He attended public school from Kindergarten–12th grade. He loves Twins baseball and playing cards with friends.\n\nAfter finishing high school, Fr. Nathan served a year with NET Ministries where he fell in love with evangelization. After serving with NET, he attended the University of Minnesota to study computer engineering. While there, Fr. Nathan lived in a Catholic men’s household and did college outreach through Saint Paul’s Outreach. During his freshman year, he started discerning his vocation more seriously and decided to transfer to the Saint John Vianney College Seminary where he finished an undergraduate degree in Philosophy and a minor in Catholic Studies. In between his undergraduate studies and the seminary, Fr. Nathan spent seven months doing an internship at Our Lady of Grace where he fell in love with parish ministry. After interning, Fr. Nathan went on to complete his Master’s in Divinity at the Saint Paul Seminary. Fr. Nathan belongs to a fraternity of Archdiocesan priests called the Companions of Christ. These priests aspire to live and serve the local church and live in community.\n\nFr. Nathan has been the parochial vicar at Our Lady of Grace in Edina for the past two years. He is excited to begin his pastorship at Holy Spirit!"
