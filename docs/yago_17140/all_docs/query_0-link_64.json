The two had always had a rough relationship due to a sibling rivalry while growing up. Malcolm had left home after high school and went from town to town.\n\nWhen Malcolm first returned, Neil wanted nothing to do with him. Neil had serious doubts that Malcolm had changed his ways. Malcolm was able to charm sisters, Drucilla Barber and Olivia Hastings. Drucilla and Olivia had the same kind of sibling relationship growing up as Neil and Malcolm had. Neil finally decided to give his brother a second chance and even helped him find a job. Dru helped him land a job as an assistant photographer for Jabot Cosmetics.\n\nMalcolm had his eyes set on Dru, but she would marry Neil. One night, Dru had taken a double dose of her cold medication and became groggy. Malcolm stopped by to check on her, and Dru mistook him for Neil. She invited him into her bed. After that night, Malcolm realized that he had made a mistake and told Olivia. Dru made Malcolm swear that he would never mention what happened between them to anyone else. Nine months later, Dru gave birth to her daughter, Lily. Dru had convinced herself that Neil was the father.\n\nMalcolm went on to date and met Keesha Monroe. After dating a couple of months, Malcolm discovered that Keesha that had an affair with Olivia’s husband, Nathan Hastings. Worst yet, Keesha found out that she had been given AIDS by her ex-boyfriend, Stan. Malcolm forgave Keesha and stood by her side as she continued to get terminally ill. He married her on her deathbed. After they exchanged vows, Keesha died.\n\nLater, Olivia’s husband, Nathan, was killed in a car accident. Malcolm and Olivia found comfort in each other. Their grief turned to love and Malcolm asked Olivia to marry him. She agreed. Malcolm had come to love Olivia and began to think of her son, Nate, as his own. When Malcolm’s ex-girlfriend, Callie Rogers, came to town…Olivia’s lack of trust drove Malcolm into Callie’s arms. Olivia and Malcolm soon divorced.\n\nMalcolm became engaged to Callie. But when it was revealed that Callie was still secretly married to her agent, Trey Shark, Malcolm and Callie separated. Next, Dru and Lily would return to Genoa City. Malcolm and Dru had an affair, despite what Olivia and Neil thought. But Dru went back to Paris and Olivia decided that Malcolm was not a good role model for Nate and refused to let them see each other. Olivia set her sights on Neil. Malcolm took her to court for visitation rights over Nate and won.\n\nMalcolm’s next love interest was Alex Perez. Malcolm and Alex moved in together and became engaged. But Alex and Neil started becoming attracted to each other. Because she was engaged to Malcolm, she spent months trying to keep her feelings for Neil a secret. When Neil’s best friend, Ryan McNeil, was murdered, Neil began drinking heavily. While drunk, Neil admitted to Malcolm that he loved Alex. Alex convinced Malcolm that it was only one-sided and wanted to move along with their wedding.\n\nMalcolm would later overhear Alex and Neil talking about how she had feelings for him. Malcolm punched Neil and took off to a meeting with his location manager, Isaac. As their car was crossing a bridge, a truck created too much weight for it and the bridge collapsed. Malcolm saved Isaac, and then swam off to find the driver. But then more of the bridge collapsed right on top of Malcolm. The driver’s body was found, but not Malcolm’s. Malcolm was declared dead. The guilt was too much for Neil and Alex and Alex returned to Minneapolis. Neil would quit his job and drink more. When Dru returned with Lily again, Neil cleaned up and became sober.\n\nThree years later, Malcolm showed up in Genoa City, alive! Malcolm explained that a family took him in and nursed him back to health. But Malcolm had returned mostly to see Nate again. Olivia wanted Malcolm to wait until Nate returned from boarding school to reveal himself. Until then, he took a job as a waiter and even became manager of Crimson Lights. Malcolm was still curious as to who Lily’s real father was. Dru finally had a DNA test done and the results proved that Malcolm was actually Lily’s father. They decided to hide the truth from Lily and Neil.\n\nBut the truth would almost come out when Lily was driving the SUV and lost control and struck Neil. Neil needed blood and Lily offered to donate. But Malcolm insisted that he be the one. Neil healed after surgery.\n\nLily fell in love with Daniel Romalotti. Dru fought it all of the way because he was the son of her foe, Phyllis Sommers. But Daniel was charged with vehicular manslaughter in the death of Cassie Newman. Lily couldn’t be separated from Daniel, so she talked him into hiding out in the Abbott family playhouse. Malcolm discovered where they were and tried to get Lily to convince Daniel to turn himself in. But instead, Daniel and Lily ran away together and became fugitives from the law. Daniel’s name was finally cleared when it was revealed that he was not driving the car.\n\nAfter Jill Fenmore was named CEO of Jabot, she called on Malcolm to work for her as their photographer. Malcolm agreed as long as Lily would become the new Jabot teen model. Malcolm quit his job at Crimson Lights and started spending more time out of town on photo shoots. Lily’s paternity eventually came out. But both Neil and Dru were unable to locate Malcolm at the time.\n\nFour years later, Malcolm returned to support Lily as she was battling cancer. He explained that he had been on photo shoots in foreign lands, but had received letters from Lily about her marrying Cane Ashby and Dru’s untimely death. Malcolm had been dating Sofia Dupre, who had just moved into Genoa City as the personal assistant to Tucker McCall. They were engaged to be married. The wedding date was set for Valentine’s day of 2011. Neil agreed to be Malcolm’s best man. But after Sofia had kept her involvement with Cane embezzling from Tucker McCall from Malcolm, he told Sofia that she shouldn’t lie to people she cares about. Malcolm and Sofia cancelled the wedding. Sofia apologized to Neil for causing Cane’s death, saying that she thought Cane would still be alive if she had gone to Neil with what she had known. Neil and Sofia grew closer and got caught up in the moment and slept together.\n\nMalcolm eventually forgave Sofia for lying to him and got back together and were married in April. It would also turn out that Cane had faked his death.\n\nWhile on their honeymoon, Sofia discovered that she was pregnant. She got Olivia to change the conception date on paper so that it looked as if the baby had to be Malcolm’s. But the guilt finally got to Sofia and she confessed to Malcolm that she had slept with Neil and was unsure as to who the father was. Malcolm at first thought that it was Neil’s way for getting revenge on him for what he had done with Dru years earlier.\n\nWhen the paternity test revealed that Sofia’s baby was in fact Neil’s, Malcolm filed for divorce and left town once again."
