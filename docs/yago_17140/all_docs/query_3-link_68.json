Jack’s first order of business was to take Nikki’s mind off of her current boyfriend, Jim Grainger, and put it on himself. He accomplished his mission by romancing Nikki with lavish dinners and gifts. When Jack discovered that Victor was planning to propose again to Nikki, Jack launched an all-out campaign for Nikki. Beating Victor to the punch, Jack took Nikki on a getaway vacation, via his private jet. When they returned from their holiday, Jack and Nikki were married.\n\nVictor, who was suspicious of Jack’s motives for marrying Nikki, offered to return control of Jabot to the Abbotts if Jack agreed to divorce Nikki. Although Jack had fallen deeply in love with Nikki, he reluctantly agreed to the deal out of loyalty to his father, John. But a crafty Victor took advantage of a carefully worded loophole in the contract that voided the deal.\n\nWhen Nikki discovered that Jack favored Jabot over her, she made plans to divorce him. Jack fell back into Nikki’s good graces when he rescued her daughter, Victoria, from drowning. Nevertheless, Nikki still wanted to divorce Jack because she had realized that her heart still belonged to Victor. Nikki’s hopes for a reconciliation for Victor were dashed after she discovered that she was pregnant with Jack’s baby. The pressure of living in an unhappy marriage eventually prompted Nikki to turn to alcohol to number her pain.\n\nBrad Carlton’s love life moved into a surprising new direction when he began pursuing his ex-wife Traci’s sister, Ashley Abbott. A romance quickly developed and Brad proposed marriage. But right before Ashley was about to give him an answer, Traci returned to Genoa City, hell-bent on winning Brad back. Torn between her love for Brad, and her sisterly feelings for Traci, a confused Ashley left town for a brief stay at her remote cabin. To Ashley’s surprise, Victor, who was still hurting over Nikki’s marriage to Jack, also visited the cabin. Away from their troubles back home, Victor and Ashley convinced themselves that they were still in love and impulsively they got married. The announcement of their marriage had a ripple effect on their friends and family. Cassandra, Brad’s former girlfriend, decided to seek revenge against Brad for rejecting her, Jack was aghast that Victor was now his brother in-law, and Nikki was heartbroken that she had no longer had any chance of remarrying her ex-husband. Soon after, Nikki miscarried. When Nikki developed a chronic back problem, she turned to painkillers for relief and quickly became drug dependent.\n\nGina’s shifty new husband, Clint Radison, coached Marge, a diner waitress, on how to impersonate the wealthy Katherine Chancellor. Once Marge mastered her impersonation, Clint kidnapped Katherine and her maid, Esther, and held them hostage in a remote cabin. Marge’s first order of business as “Katherine” was to sell several valuable Chancellor properties, an act that surprised Katherine’s friends and family. Meanwhile, Katherine’s husband, Rex, found himself increasingly baffled by his wife’s unusual behavior. No longer able to tolerate her new eccentricities, and boorish behavior, Rex moved out and took up residence with Jill, who persuaded Rex to divorce Katherine and marry her.\n\nMarge and her cohorts were on the verge of becoming wealthy by selling off the Chancellor estate when Katherine’s son, Brock, made a surprise visit. Brock immediately surmised that a stranger was passing herself off as Katherine and demanded to know his mom’s whereabouts. Marge finally broke down and confessed, which led to Katherine’s and Esther’s rescue. And Clint was arrested for his role in the scheme.\n\nKatherine was devastated to learn that during her absence Rex had married Jill. With her lawyer’s help, however, Katherine pointed out that the marriage wasn’t legal because Marge–not Katherine–had signed the divorce papers. Katherine agreed to accept Rex’s marriage to Jill, provided that they wait six months before legally remarrying. During the waiting period, Jill began seeing her ex-husband, John Abbott. Complicating matters more was Rex’s unusual romance with Leanna Love, whom he pursued while posing as a man named Roger. Katherine decided to blow everyone’s cover by arranging a party where she took delight in watching Jill and Rex’s love lives explode.\n\nPaul Williams, who was believed dead, was actually working closely with his father, Carl, to expose Cassandra and her lover Adrian as the murders of her husband, George Rawlins. Paul and Carl followed Cassandra and Adrian to Bermuda, where they tormented Cassandra with visions of Paul as a ghost. Horrified, Cassandra quickly returned home. Soon after, Cassandra confessed that on the night when George was murdered, she was knocked unconscious. When she awoke, there was a gun in her hand and her husband was dead. With Cassandra’s help, Paul and Carl succeeded in exposing Adrian as George’s killer.\n\nAlthough Lauren Fenmore still had feelings for Paul, she agreed to marry Scott Grainger. Soon after the marriage, Lauren miscarried, which troubled Scott because he didn’t even know that she had been pregnant! Meanwhile, Sheila Carter, a nurse who worked with Scott at the hospital and was attracted to him, tried to further undermine his marriage by suggesting that Lauren still loved Paul. As the troubles in Lauren’s and Scott’s marriage continued to escalate, they agreed to a temporary separation. Eventually, they agreed to give their marriage another chance. By that time, Sheila had announced to Scott that she was pregnant with his baby. To Scott’s surprise, Lauren was also pregnant.\n\nSkip and Carol arranged to adopt a baby from a troubled, unwed mom named Nan, who didn’t know if her child had been fathered by her boyfriend, Jeff, or a man who had raped her. Soon after her baby was born and in Skip’s and Carol’s loving home, Nan discovered that Jeff was the father. Nan succeeded in winning back custody of her baby, but she quickly had second thoughts about motherhood when she and Jeff learned how much responsibility was involved. Eventually, they returned the baby to a delighted Skip and Carol.\n\nNathan had his pocket picked by a cunning young woman who turned out to be Drucilla Barber, the niece of Abbott maid, Mamie Johnson. Nathan recognized that Dru was troubled, and his attitude toward her softened when he learned that she was illiterate. With Paul’s help, Dru moved in with Nathan and he tutored her. Dru fell in love with Nathan, but he was already dating Dru’s sister, Olivia, who was a doctor. The two sisters had been separated for five years. When Olivia and Dru finally came face-to-face, Dru–who was bitter that Olivia was the woman in Nathan’s life–rejected her older sister’s attempt at a reconciliation. Dru was now studying ballet and became even more determined to steal Nathan away from Olivia.\n\nJill convinced her secretary, David Kimball, to romance Nina so that Jill would have more time to visit her grandson, Phillip. Eventually, David and Nina shocked everyone by eloping. Nina set up David in business, and he began an affair with Diane, his secretary. It was Diane who came across a newspaper clipping about heiress Rebecca Harper, who had been murdered by her husband, Tom. Oddly enough, the photograph of Tom looked remarkably like David. Shortly after, a woman named Vivian arrived in Genoa City, with the intent of exposing David. However, he electrocuted her in her bath before she was able to contact Nina. David also set a trap to hurt Nina’s friends, Danny and Chris, because they didn’t approve of her marriage to Kimball. David arranged to make it look as if Danny was a cocaine user and had him arrested. Eventually, the charges against Danny were dropped. Soon after, Danny and Chris married.\n\n-Previous year : Y&R 1989"
