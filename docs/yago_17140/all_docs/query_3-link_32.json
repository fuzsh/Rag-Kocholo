        "text": "- Originally announced at Masses the weekend of May 7-8 -\n\nThis past weekend at church, I made the announcement that after 13 years as your pastor and coworker in the Vineyard of the Lord here at Holy Spirit, I will be moved to a new parish on July 1st. I will let you all know next week what parish I will be moved to, but this past weekend I was able to announce who will be the new pastor of Holy Spirit Church and School starting July 1st, 2022:\n\nYour new pastor will be Fr. Nathan Hastings. He is coming to us from the Church of Our Lady of Grace, in Edina, MN.\n\nFr. Nathan Hastings was ordained by Archbishop Hebda in May of 2020. Fr. Nathan looks forward to meeting you, and together with you, asks the Holy Spirit and Our Blessed Mother to obtain for us an overflowing measure of the incredible grace of God.\n\nFr. Nathan grew up in Inver Grove Heights, MN, and attended St. Joseph’s Church in West St. Paul. He is the fifth of five children: one brother, three sisters, and himself. He has many nieces and nephews which he loves to spend time with. He attended public school from kindergarten to 12th grade. He loves Twins baseball and playing cards with friends.\n\nAfter Fr. Nathan finished high school, he discerned to serve a year with NET Ministries, where he fell in love with evangelization and the seeds of his vocation were planted. After serving with NET, Fr. Nathan attended the University of Minnesota studying computer engineering. While at the U of M, Fr. Nathan lived in a Catholic Men’s Household and did college outreach through Saint Paul’s Outreach. During Fr. Nathan’s freshman year at the U of M, he started discerning his vocation more seriously and decided to transfer to Saint John Vianney College Seminary on the campus of the University of St. Thomas the next fall. Fr. Nathan finished an undergraduate degree in Philosophy there, while minoring in Catholic Studies. Fr. Nathan went on to complete his Master’s of Divinity at The Saint Paul Seminary and was ordained a priest in May of 2020.\n\nFr. Hastings will take over as pastor on July 1st. I pray he will be graced by God to continue to move Holy Spirit Church and School forward to a bright and awesome future.\n\nFr. Hastings hopes to be a Good Shepherd for you here at Holy Spirit Catholic Church and School, and through it all, may God’s name be praised."
