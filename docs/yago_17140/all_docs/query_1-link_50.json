        "text": "It’s a different time in her life and she is in a different place, but Tonya Lee Williams (ex-Olivia Barber) addressed being asked back to reprise her signature soap opera role on CBS’ The Young and the Restless.\n\nTonya told Soaps In Depth the last time the soap reached out to her to reprise Olivia was for its 50th anniversary, “It it would have been lovely to do but I could not imagine doing the role. It takes a lot for me as an actor. You don’t just turn up and start reading a script. I don’t know how to explain it … I trained as an actor. I go through a lot of process into who that character is. And that character was someone from 20 years ago.”\n\nWilliams’ Y&R run Williams began back in 1990 and went through 2005. She later returned in 2007 making some appearances in the several years that followed. However, the last time anyone had an Olivia sighting was back in February of 2012 for Cane and Lily’s wedding.\n\nShe qualified that she left the show on “great terms,” adding, “I absolutely love the show. It has nothing to do with the show. But I try to explain it like this: Have you ever dated someone for a long time and you don’t want to date them anymore? And you have broken up with them and like, 10, 15 years have passed and people are saying, ‘Would you go back with that guy?’ I’m like, ‘No.’ Because you’re a different person now.”\n\nCurrently, Williams is the executive and artistic director for the Reelworld Film Festival. An organization she founded in 2001. Held in Toronto, the film festival features talent from ethnically diverse communities.\n\nSo, would you have liked to have seen the character of Olivia show back on Y&R? Perhaps, helping a patient in need since she is a doctor or speaking with/being involved with the Winters family in some capacity? Comment below.\n\nOn Monday, during a press conference held by Los Angeles County prosecutors, two of the four suspects in the death of Johnny Wactor (ex-Brando Corbin) have now been officially charged with the murder of the beloved General Hospital actor.\n\nThe charges were announced by L.A. County District Attorney George Gascón and interim police chief Dominic Choi. The suspects charged with Wactor’s murder are Robert Barceleau and Sergio Estrada, both 18.\n\nThe most serious charge is for Barceleau, who was charged with murder, including a special circumstance allegation of killing in the commission of a robbery, which could lead to a life-without-parole prison term. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both with allegations he was armed with a firearm.\n\nEstrada, was also charged with murder, but without the special circumstance allegation. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both also allegedly while armed with a firearm. Estrada is also facing a life sentence.\n\nThe two other suspects were also formally charged, Leonel Gutierrez, also 18 was charged with attempted robbery and grand theft by embezzlement, both with allegations he was armed. Meanwhile, Frank Olano, 22, was charged with being an accessory after the fact to the killing, along with receiving stolen property and three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Barceleau, Estrada and Gutierrez remain in custody in lieu of $2 million bail each, while Olano must post a $1 million bail.\n\nWactor was killed May 25 in the early morning hours in downtown Los Angeles after his shift as a bartender at the Level 8 bar/restaurant. He, and co-worker, Anita Joy were walking to their cars, when Wactor came upon the thieves trying to steal the catalytic converter from his vehicle and was shot in the chest and died in Joy’s arms.\n\nSo, are you glad Johnny’s murderers have been officially charged? Share your thoughts via the comment section below. But first, you can check out the press conference from Fox 11 Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, the world learned of the passing of veteran actor, John Aprea who died back on August 5th at the age of 83.\n\nAprea appeared on Another World in two roles throughout his career – Lucas (Luke) Castigliano from 1989 to 1993, and Alexander Nikos from May 1997 to January 1998.\n\nIn story, Lucas was one of the loves of Felicia Gallant’s (Linda Dano) life. They shared a daughter that was put up for adoption when they were younger, who was later revealed to be Lorna Devon played by Alicia Coppola.\n\nOn Monday, August 19th, following the news of his death, both Linda and Alicia shared their remembrances of their time working with the talented actor.\n\nLinda Dano took to her Instagram and expressed, “As many of you already know my dear friend John Aprea passed away on August 5th…out of respect to his wife Betsy I waited until the family released there statement.. before I posted anything.This has been a very difficult time…I loved him so…The kindest sweetest funniest man.I believe he is now in Heaven with all of his old friends and of coarse ,my Frank…God has his hands full!!!Bless you John …I miss you ❤️”\n\nAlicia Coppola shared on her Instagram: “Now I have two fathers in heaven. I adored you John Aprea. Mama Linda Dano and I will always miss you. You were there for me to grieve my very own daddy. Art imitated life. I loved you then. I love you now. Hope you, my daddy and Frankie are giving God a run for His money. With beer, blonds with big boobs. Xoxo”\n\nCoppola appeared as Lorna from 1991-1994, while Linda Dan0 played Felicia from 1983-1999 and until AW’s final episode.\n\nDo you remember Alicia, John and Linda’s scenes together from ‘Another World’?
