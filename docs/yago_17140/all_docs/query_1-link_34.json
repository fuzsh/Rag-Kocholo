        "text": "The Young and the Restless is adding a new actor to the cast and has chosen Jacob Aaron Gaines to portray Moses, the son of Neil Winters,Kristoff St. John) and Sophia Dupr, (Julia Pace). The character was introduced in 2013 and first portrayed by Randall L. Smith until 2016 when Dax Randall took over the role. Moses was christened with Tucker McCall (Devon's biological father) and his aunt through marriage Olivia Winters as his godparents. Neil and Sofia were not married until two months after their was born because they desired to raise him in a traditional family.\n\nViewers never warmed up to Neil and Sophia and the marriage did not last. They divorced within in a matter of months and Moses went to live with his mother. There were rave reviews about Julia Pace because she was heavy set and dark complexioned and not the typical soap actress. She returned to The Younh and the Testless during the memorial service for Neil Winters whose portrayer Kristoff St. John died tragically on February 2, 2019. Moses wax mentioned at that time but was never shown.\n\nMoses, as a child primarily resided with Sofia, but had visits with Neil that were off screen. The SORAS Moses, (Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome) will arrive in Genoa City on April 1 but no details have been given regarding the storyline. Thetr also has been no mention of Sophia returning to Genoa Coty. There are some spoilers who suggest he will interact with Faith Newman because both are teenagers. It’s always possible that the young man could have a chip on his shoulder because his father is dead. Devon and Nate may have their hands full attempting to steer this teen in the right direction.\n\nJacob Aaron Gaines is relatively new to the world of acting. He had a role in the films Dimensional Shift in 2019, and in 2020 was in the movie Motorvasion and also the Netflix film Fatal Affair Dirinh an interview with Soap Opera Digest the young actor said the following:“ I’m honored to be playing Neil’s son and to show ‘Y&R’ fans a little piece of him.” He added, “I’m thrilled to be able to do that. Kristoff’s story hit me pretty hard and I’m sure I won’t understand the true gravity of it until I’m further into playing Moses. For now, it’s a huge privilege for me.”\n\nBoth Neil Winters and his mother were alcoholics so it will be interesting to find out if Moses has this family trait. The young man will be returning to Genoa City to become a part of a unique family dynamic. His mother had slept with both Neil and his brother Malcolm which is the same thing Neil’s first wife Drucilla did. The daughter Dru gave birth to was Lily who turned out to belong to Malcolm. This makes Lily a sister to Moses technically but by blood they are actually first cousins as their fathers are siblings. Devon is his brother by way of adoption and Nate’s mother Olivia was once Neil’s sister in law. This makes Dr. Hasting hos cousin via marriage but not by blood.\n\nMoses godmother Olivia is his step aunt because she was the sister of Dru. Tucker McCall was the boss of his mother Sophia and as Devon’s biological father is his uncle. This would have made Katherine Chancellor his great aunt of sorts. It had been mentioned on Y&R that Nate wanted to mentor his younger cousin because when was interested in medicine so viewers will have to see where this storyline leads. Amanda and Elena will possibly also spend time with Moses but their complicated situations with Devon and Nate might make things a bit uncomfortable. Be on the lookout for updates and make sure you tune in on April 1 to see Moses Winters in action."
