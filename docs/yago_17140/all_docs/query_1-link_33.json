The Modern Family star just shut down TikTok rumours about her actor beau, who also starred in Dumplin’ with Jennifer Aniston\n\nSTORYFaye Bradley\n\nApr 18 , 2024\n\nAriel Winter is fighting back against rumours about her boyfriend Luke Benward’s “controlling behaviour”, according to JustJared.\n\nThe rumours proliferated after one netizen left a comment below a video she posted on TikTok recently with Benward. “There’s been so many rumours about him controlling her,” they wrote, kicking off a stream of additional comments.\n\nBut Winter responded, saying: “Guys please help he’s forcing me on onlyfans so he can be my manager and he doesn’t let me out of the house!!!! SOS!!!!” she joked. “Don’t believe everything you see on tt, especially rumours like that :) He’s a great man, and if he wasn’t, the dogs would take his ass outside.”\n\nThe original commenter then apologised, with Winter reverting back with “It’s totally okay! Those clickbait type things are so easy to fall into when really, most of them are just people looking to get views anyway they can.”\n\nSo, who is Luke Benward? Let’s take a look.\n\nWhat does Luke Benward do?\n\nLuke Benward is an actor and singer. According to his interview on The Italian Rêve, he has been acting since childhood, though his earliest memories of acting remain vague. “Honestly, I was so little, but I remember being able to go through the bootcamp course of the military base we were shooting on,” he said, referring to his acting debut on Mel Gibson We Were Soldiers in 2002, in which he played the star’s son.\n\nHe has since starred in TV shows and films such as Good Luck Charlie (2013), Cloud 9 (2014) and Dolly Parton’s Dumplin’ with Jennifer Aniston. The multitalented 28-year-old also released an album in 2009 when he was still a teen, titled Let Your Love Out.\n\nHow did Luke Benward and Ariel Winter meet?\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how Benward met the Modern Family star, who’s two years younger than him, but a source told HollywoodLife that the pair have been in the same friendship circles since 2016. They are believed to have started dating in 2019, after they were seen getting cosy together outside a club in Hollywood, Cosmopolitan reported.\n\nThey directed a film together\n\nBack in 2021, Variety announced that the lovebirds were collaborating on a short film project together, Boys, with Benward directing and Winter producing.\n\nPer the same source, their production qualified to be considered for a 2022 Academy Award in the live action short category, but ultimately wasn’t nominated.\n\nWho else has Luke Benward dated?\n\nThe former Disney Channel star has been linked to various famous faces over the years. Per J-14, he dated his Girl vs Monster co-star Olivia Holt from 2012 to 2014, then reportedly had a thing with the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe actress Georgie Henley, before starting his current relationship with Winter.\n\nWinter is fighting back against online comments that her boyfriend Luke Benward is ‘controlling’ towards her, saying, ‘Don’t believe everything you see on [TikTok]’\n\nBenward is an actor and singer who made his Hollywood debut alongside Mel Gibson in We Were Soldiers as a child, and has since starred in Cloud 9 and Dolly Parton’s Dumplin’ with Jennifer Aniston"
