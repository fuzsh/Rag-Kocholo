On Instagram, he mostly shares dental tips, tutorials, family, travel, adventure, daily life, lifestyle photos, videos, and fashion content. In the coming days, various fashion and sports will choose Ben as a digital promoter of their product.\n\nWinters is also very popular on YouTube as a video content creator, who has accumulated over 3.3 million subscribers on his self-titled YouTube channel. He launched his official YouTube channel on 3 January 2020 and posted his debut video titled “Do You Brush Your Teeth BEFORE Or AFTER You Do THIS?! The Answer ISN’T what you think!! (Tiktok)” on 18 March 2020.\n\nOn the channel, he mostly shares dental health tips, tutorials, brushing, lifestyle, pranks, adventure, challenges, experiments videos, and travel vlogs on the channel. The most-watched video on his channel is titled “When You Don’t Know How To Use Braces.. Orthodontist Reacts!” which has recorded over 2.2 billion views so far, in 2022.\n\nSource - Instagram\n\nOther than this, Ben has two other channels titled “Bentist Reacts” and “The Bentist Gaming” with thousands of subscribers. On the first channel, he mostly shares short reaction videos and on the latter channel, he mainly streams and uploads videos of popular games including Fortnite, Warzone, and many others.\n\nWinters is an orthodontist specializing in providing braces for children, teens, and adults. In addition, he often corrects crooked and misaligned teeth, reviving a beautiful, functional smile. Additionally, he is a member of the American Association of Orthodontists, and he serves the societal communities in North West Arkansas. In 2019, he was voted the best Northwest Arkansas Orthodontist by the Arkansas Democratic-Gazette.\n\nSource - Instagram\n\nIn 2019, the social media sensation uploaded his debut video on TikTok and garnered a massive following within 24 hours of uploading. He stated, His fame skyrocketed within 24 hours, and he has since uploaded short videos on the platform showcasing dental care routines to his fans. Today, he boasts over 11 million followers and 382 million likes on the platform.\n\nAlong with being an Orthodontist, Ben is also an entrepreneur and has created a dental care product company called “The Something Nice Company” which is growing rapidly and has accumulated thousands of followers on different social media platforms including Instagram. The most popular product of the brand is the Toothbrush.\n\nSource - Instagram\n\nWinters's net worth is courted to be an estimated $2 million. Most of Winters's earnings come from his social media presence as a content creator, brand collaborations, medical clientele, and other ventures.\n\nOn TikTok, the creator could potentially earn upwards of an estimated $11k per post, excluding brand-sponsored deals. On Instagram, he could earn upwards of an estimated $4k for a brand-sponsored post.\n\nOn YouTube, his average earnings are around the $10k mark per video, excluding brand-sponsored deals, for which he could charge upwards of $15k per video. As far as brand collaborations go, Winters has been associated with several top brands over the course of his social media career, some medical and some apparel.\n\nIt is currently unknown how much he could have earned from these sponsored interactions. Though we do not have the figures to justify that question, we can safely assume that he has earned a hefty sum from these associations, and with the kind of fan following winters currently has, it’s certainly helped improve that figure to a greater amount.\n\nWinters is a medical professional and practices his specialization like any other medical profession. It is currently unknown how much he could charge for any dental care as the dental costs and prices may vary from situation to situation. Hence we currently do not know how much he earns, but we can speculate on the average earnings of a dentist in the united states is around $160k yearly.\n\nSource - Instagram\n\nAlong with being an Orthodontist, Ben is also an entrepreneur and has created a dental care product company called “The Something Nice Company” which is growing rapidly and has accumulated thousands of followers on different social media platforms including Instagram.\n\nThe most popular product of the brand is the Toothbrush.
