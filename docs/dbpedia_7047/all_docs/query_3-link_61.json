        "text": "Nickandmore! presents the first comprehensive list of every TV series aired on Nickelodeon from 1979 through today. This list is for the main Nickelodeon cable television channel in the United States and includes programs aired during the Nick Jr. and Nick at Nite programming blocks.\n\nDates correspond to the “TV day”, which starts and ends at 6:00am Eastern Time. In general, First Aired is representative of when a TV show first began to air on the channel. However, there are times where this may vary, such as a pilot airing before an official premiere. Last Aired is the most recent date a program aired on the network. The length of time between the first and last airings is not necessarily representative of a program’s total time on the network. Various shows have gone months or years between different airings. See the Notes section for additional airing information.\n\nPublished: June 14, 2019\n\nUpdated: August 14, 2024 (661 titles listed)"
