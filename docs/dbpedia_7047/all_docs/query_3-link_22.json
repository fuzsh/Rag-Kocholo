        "text": "Depends on what you mean by “happening” but…\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants – Still #1. Always places 5+ spots in cable’s top 25 cable ratings. Random repeats score between 4 and 5 million viewers on Saturday & Sunday mornings. New episodes still do very well. It’s doing just fine.\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar – My guess, it’s the #2 Nicktoon, and the #3 show on Nick (behind SpongeBob & iCarly). Already renewed to episode 52. New episodes (and repeats) are doing well in ratings. The first DVD was just announced today (via TV Shows on DVD).\n\nThe Fairly OddParents – It’s still around. 18 episodes from season 7 are still left to air. Production has completed on all the episodes, but no future announcements have been made. Most of the staff has moved on to T.U.F.F. Puppy. As for showings on Nick… right now it’s once again limited to weekends from 8-9am, with Saturday afternoon movies each week. It was airing on weekdays for quite a while this year, with 3 episodes running on weekdays in September. Nick just seems very up and down with this show. I have a feeling it will stick around until the 10th anniversary in 2011 (of the show, not the premiere on OY!C).\n\nFanboy & Chum Chum – Doing very good for a new show. The premiere was high coming out of the “Truth or Square” special; however, since it’s premiere, other episodes have been doing 3+ million viewers. That’s very good! It’s also has random repeats, unlike most of the other “newer” Nicktoons got after their premiere… another good sign repeats are doing well in ratings.\n\nThe Mighty B! – Canceled. I expected this. It’s hardly airing on Nickelodeon anymore, one or two showings every now-and-then. Repeats have been shipped off to Nicktoons (the channel). Still has about 15 or so episodes to air. I hope they all air (and on Nick), and I hope it doesn’t even up like many other Nicktoons that have gone years (and some still haven’t) before premiering their final episodes.\n\nBack at the Barnyard – Still on Nick. It’s got a weekday run, but the timeslot keeps changing (was 6:30 & 7am, then 4pm, then 3:30pm, now 3pm). I have a feeling this show will not go past it’s 46 or 52 episodes (depending on whether season 2 is 20 or 26 episodes). It’s not doing horrible (like Mighty B!), but also not doing good (like Fanboy).\n\nStill to come…\n\nPlanet Sheen – Possible debut in summer 2010, but otherwise just sometime in 2010.\n\nKung Fu Panda: The Series – Suppose to debut in 2010, but I have a feeling it will be like Penguins and air a “preview” in November 2010 with a full premiere in early 2011.\n\nT.U.F.F. Puppy – With production just starting recently, I have a feeling we will not see this until 2011. Only 13 episodes have been ordered so far, but it is Nick’s only 2D show that is coming.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – 2012. It’s too far out to really know anything about it yet.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nWell, these cartoons are most likely going to end within a year or two:\n\nFairly Odd Parents - It gets ALOT of viewers, and the episodes are still good, but the creators will decide to cancel it seeing it's gone on long enough and needs to give Nick room for new shows.\n\nPenguins of Madagascar - At first the episodes were good, but now the episodes are just getting boring. It's not just me. I asked a kid I knew and he agreed.\n\nWell, yeah.\n\nKeep posting!\n\nFairly Oddparents is hardly on anymore. Mostly airs in the early hours on weekends. I think it's because it's lost a lot of popularity. But as bad as it's gotten, Tuff Puppy looks worse.\n\nWell, the episodes are boring.\n\nYeah, Julian is getting old really fast. And that otter...how come she's got a kittycat nose instead of an otter nose? Kind of gross looking. The only thing on the show I have liked was that Robin Hood raccoon. They ought to build a show around him.\n\nThis is a thread to discuss what's happening with Nickelodeon's newest cartoons.\n\nWhat is happening:\n\nMighty B - Co-creator posted hint on Facebook show might be canceled (Source: http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tv/not-so-mighty.html)\n\nFan Boy and Chum Chum - Doing pretty good on Nickelodeon so far.\n\nPost what YOU think is happening.\n\nNickelodeon has been pulling this stunt for the past 5-10 years. At least Invader ZIM and My Life as a Teenage Robot managed to get past their first seasons. When MLAATR got cancelled, they pretty much dumped the yet-unaired Season 3 onto Nicktoons (which I like to call the nostalgic graveyard for Nickelodeon cartoons). Aww, what happened, Nickelodeon? Lost interest in the show?\n\nThe X's got canceled after one season. El Tigre got canceled after one season. I really fell in love with The Mighty B! for reasons I've already shared. And I think it's a great show, and I also knew the harsh reality: If it's a good show, Nickelodeon will cancel it immediately! And yet the show was good enough to last into another season! I swore that if Nickelodeon ever cancels The Mighty B!, I'm finished with the network.\n\nAnd sadly, I was right. Nickelodeon has lost my viewership. (Otherwise, the rest of The Mighty B!'s run will be on my DirecTV recording radar.)\n\nNick continues to put Spongebob Squarepants on a pedestal. They are really confident it will last forever. And everything else... and I mean EVERYTHING else, gets canceled. That's not how things were done on Nickelodeon before, when shows got a healthy run. Look at Ren & Stimpy, Rugrats, Doug, Hey Arnold!, etc. What do we have today? Only Spongebob. Fairly OddParents (which is way past its prime) is ostensibly over, and all other shows get canceled. (Except for Avatar, which just ended. And Avatar, for a time, was the only series to unseat Spongebob!)\n\nEven though it's an okay show, I get the feeling the same thing will happen to Fanboy & Chum-Chum. If it's good, and it's not Spongebob, it'll get canceled. Will the same fate befall The Penguins of Madagascar? Hell yes! Nickelodeon will cancel everything until Spongebob is the one cartoon they have left. (Not counting Nick Jr. stuff.) And that's a pretty grim picture. Perhaps even for Spongebob.\n\nAnd before you get the wrong idea, I don't hate Spongebob. It was okay for the first two seasons (even though the show isn't exactly my cup of tea), but even many fans of the show thought it has gotten past its prime. If anything, I'm really bashing Nickelodeon and their decision to have more Spongebob (and even iCarly) overkill.\n\nI have no interest in TUFF Puppy. Butch Hartman has disappointingly become Nickelodeon's own version of Seth McFarlane.\n\nSomething very wrong is going on at Nickelodeon, just as bad as it is on Cartoon Network. It all comes down to politics and bad exec decisions. Bad economies are not an excuse."
