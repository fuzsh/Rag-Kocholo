        "text": "Nickelodeon delivered a one-two rating punch over the weekend, as its telecast of the 2009 Kids’ Choice Awards drew the show’s biggest audience ever and “The Penguins of Madagascar” ranked as the most-watched series premiere for the network.\n\nSaturday’s telecast of the Kids’ Choice Awards from 8-9:30 p.m. drew a record 7.7 million viewers, the most for the show, and a 4.7 household rating. Marking growth in its audience for the fourth consecutive year, the show set viewership records in its key demographics, including children 2-11 (3.8 million), children 6-11 (3 million) and tweens 9-14 (2.9 million).\n\nA record 91.1 million votes were cast on various Nick Web sites. Increased attention for the show also led to a solid boost in online traffic, with Nick.com scoring its most-trafficked day ever (2.2 million unique visitors and 37 million page views).\n\nAfter the ceremony, Nickelodeon premiered “The Penguins of Madagascar,” a CGI-animated series spun off from the “Madagascar” film franchise.\n\n“Penguins” drew 6.1 million total viewers for its 9:30 p.m. debut Saturday night and ranks as the most-watched series premiere in the network’s history.\n\nRetaining 77% of its Kids’ Choice lead-in, “Penguins” also set viewership records among kids 6-11 (2.3 million) and tweens 9-14 (2.3 million). Among children 2-11, the show came in as the second most-watched premiere ever for the network."
