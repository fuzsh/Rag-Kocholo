        "text": "Fancy watching \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" in the comfort of your own home? Finding a streaming service to buy, rent, download, or binge the comedy TV series via subscription can be tricky, so we here at Moviefone want to do the heavy lifting.\n\nBelow, you’ll find a number of top-tier streaming and cable services – including rental, purchase, and subscription choices – along with the availability of \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" on each platform. Now, before we get into the nitty-gritty of how you can watch \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" right now, here are some finer points about the Nickelodeon show.\n\nOriginally premiering November 28th, 2008, \"The Penguins of Madagascar\" stars Tom McGrath, Jeff Bennett, James Patrick Stuart, John DiMaggio. The series runs 3 season(s), and has a score of 74 (out of 100) on TMDB, which put together reviews from 340 experienced people.\n\nWhat, so now you want to know what the TV show is about? Here’s the plot: \"The Penguins of Madagascar is an American CGI animated television series airing on Nickelodeon. It stars nine characters from the DreamWorks Animation animated film Madagascar: The penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Private, and Rico; the lemurs King Julien, Maurice, and Mort; and Mason and Phil the chimpanzees. Characters new to the series include Marlene the otter and a zookeeper named Alice. It is the first Nicktoon produced with DreamWorks Animation. A pilot episode, \"Gone in a Flash\", aired as part of \"Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend\" on November 29, 2008, and The Penguins of Madagascar became a regular series on March 28, 2009. The series premiere drew 6.1 million viewers, setting a new record as the most-watched premiere. Although the series occasionally alludes to the rest of the franchise, The Penguins of Madagascar does not take place at a precise time within it. McGrath, who is also the co-creator of the film characters, has said that the series takes place \"not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe.\"\"\n\n\"The Penguins of Madagascar\" is currently available to stream via subscription, rental, or purchase on Vudu, Paramount Plus, Paramount Plus Apple TV Channel , Microsoft Store, Apple iTunes, Paramount+ Amazon Channel, Google Play Movies, Amazon Video, and Paramount+ Roku Premium Channel ."
