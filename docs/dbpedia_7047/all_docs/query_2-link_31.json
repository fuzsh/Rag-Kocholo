        "text": "It’s hard to believe, but Madagascar is almost two decades old. We’ve come a long way from that original breakout animated survival comedy film that premiered in May 2005 and first introduced us to a wonderful world of precocious talking animals from the Central Park Zoo. Now, there is a Madagascar empire that even King Julien would be proud of, with four films and three television series making up the magnificent Madagascar cinematic universe (the REAL MCU).\n\nWhether you’re a kid or just young at heart, there’s something for everyone in the Madagascar titles, and any one of them is sure to be a fun time for viewers of all ages.
