        "text": "The Penguins of Madagascar premiered in November 2008 on Nickelodeon. The animated comedy, a spin-off from the Madagascar movies, ran for three seasons and 80 half-hour episodes.\n\nAbout The Show\n\nSkipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private are an elite strike force with top-tier commando skills and a world-class clandestine headquarters. At least, that’s how Skipper would describe them. Others might say they’re four penguins living among their animal brethren at the Central Park Zoo. But no matter, the penguins are too busy saving the world to care what others think. Only one thing is capable of distracting them from their mission: their obnoxious new neighbor, Juilen. This party animal, and former self-proclaimed “King of the Lemurs,” has just arrived at the zoo and he’s looking to shake things up a bit. There goes the neighborhood. [via Nickelodeon]\n\nThe Episode List\n\nThe episode list and air dates below are for Nickelodeon and Nicktoons in the United States. The dates, days, and times listed are for their first appearance on the network. The codes are official episode numbers used by the network."
