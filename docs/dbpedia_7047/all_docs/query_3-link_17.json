        "text": "Current Productions:\n\nSanjay & Craig (Nickelodeon series) – A classic tale of boy meets snake, this 20-episode, 2D-animated series follows two best buds who dedicate their lives to becoming the coolest, most rebellious dudes in the neighborhood. Sanjay & Craig is created byJim Dirschberger, Jay Howell and Andreas Trolf, and executive produced by Nick alumni Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi (The Adventures of Pete & Pete, Alvin and the Chipmunks).\n\nMonsters vs. Aliens (Nickelodeon series) – An extension of the blockbuster movie, the all-new CG-animated television series features the lovable monsters and a whole new group of nefarious aliens living and working together at Area 50-something. Greenlit for 26 episodes, the series will be executive produced by Bob Schooley, Mark McCorkle andBrett Haaland (The Penguins of Madagascar).\n\nMonty and Norville (Nickelodeon preschool series/working title) – Monty and Norville follows the adventures of a 5-year-old troll named Monty and his dragon friend Norville. With the help of viewers at home, Monty can use his magic stick to make incredible things happen as long as he uses the right words. The new animated 26-episode series, created by Adam Peltzman (head writer, Blue’s Clues, The Backyardigans), will introduce a literacy curriculum to Nickelodeon’s preschool audience.\n\nPilots:\n\nBad Seeds (Nickelodeon pilot) – From SpongeBob SquarePants alumnus and Chowder creator Carl Greenblatt, Bad Seeds is about a good bird running with the bad crowd … and having a great time!\n\nBlaze and the Monster Machines (Nickelodeon preschool pilot/working title) – Blaze and the Monster Machines is a CG-animated, interactive program about an 8-year-old boy named AJ and his incredible monster truck Blaze. AJ, Blaze and their friend Maddie fight their arch nemesis Crusher along with a fleet of other trucks. The series features a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) curriculum and is created by Jeff Borkin (head writer, Team Umizoomi, Little Einsteins) and Ellen Martin (producer, Bubble Guppies, The Backyardigans).\n\nAlso, several live-action series - you can see the full list here:\n\nhttp://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/two-spinoffs-animated-pilot-spongebob-357915\n\nI guess one good thing about the ratings trouble is that it seems to have prompted them to expand their repertoire and take a few risks that they may not have taken previously. I'm hoping that \"Bad Seeds\" gets picked up; I'm fond of Greenblatt's style and he was an excellent Spongebob writer.\n\nWell it's great to see Nick finally premiering new shows.It's a shame to see a CGI Dreamworks show come out again but at least they're some original shows as well.A few months Nick confirmed they had picked up a few Nick pilots from Butch Hartman and i'm kind of dissapointed to see none of them listed here although thye simply might be to early in development.Well this year Nicks actually been making pretty good desicions for their standards especially recently.Maybe this will impact the ratigns in a postive light in years to come.\n\nIt's interesting because I think out of all the DreamWorks Nick shows that there are MVA seems like the most logical choice to be a series (since they're not making a second movie) whereas Kung Fu Panda and Penguins never felt like the right fit to me (Penguins more so than Panda).\n\nBut I digress, nothing here really sparks my interest that much. I'll be more interested what it comes closer to the show premieres.\n\nOn a side note, what's with all these Nick shows being named \"Blank and Blank\". LIke Sanjay & Craig, Monty and Norville, Robot and Monster and even their live action pilot Sam & Cat. Granted I know some of these might just be tentative titles but shows with \"and\" tend to be very forgetful in my opinion, especially on Nick. Heck look how Bucket & Skinner and Fanboy & Chum Chum turned out...\n\nIt's interesting because I think out of all the DreamWorks Nick shows that there are MVA seems like the most logical choice to be a series (since they're not making a second movie) whereas Kung Fu Panda and Penguins never felt like the right fit to me (Penguins more so than Panda).\n\nBut I digress, nothing here really sparks my interest that much.

Heck look how Bucket & Skinner and Fanboy & Chum Chum turned out...\n\nRen & Stimpy, Kenan & Kel, The Adventures of Pete & Pete and Drake & Josh seem to be the exceptions.\n\noriginally posted by Dragonpiece\n\nThey are still making Monsters Vs. Aliens? Sure is long development on that, they made Kung Fu Panda much faster.\n\nWhat do you mean \"they're still making?\" It does take awhile to make a season of an animated TV show, especially the first where everything isn't quite hammered out yet. Really they only announced Monsters Vs Aliens as a TV series (and not just as a short or special) earlier this year. It took Penguins and Kung Fu Panda two years when their shows were first announced (Penguins in 2007, Kung Fu Panda sometime in 2009/early 2010) to when their first seasons came out so obviously the case is the same here.\n\noriginally posted by Ishtar\n\nRen & Stimpy, Kenan & Kel, The Adventures of Pete & Pete and Drake & Josh seem to be the exceptions.\n\nThose are some pretty big exceptions and really the point of naming the show \"Blank and Blank\" is to make you aware of who the title two characters are and that they are the main focus of the show. Yeah I know that seems pretty silly and unneeded but I'm pretty sure ad execs believe that's key in order to appease the show to the main focus auidence (2-11 year olds) who will be watching it.\n\nSanjay & Craig- 2D and executive produced by the Pete & Pete guys. I like 2D and I haven't watched a whole episode of P&P but I've heard good things about it, and how unique it was. This new show is a cartoon rather than a live action show, it's made 20 years after Pete & Pete, etc., but... I'm still curious about this one.\n\nBad Seeds creator was one of the writers of many SpongeBob episodes I like. But he also made Chowder, which i also didn't really care for (maybe I should give it more of a chance? *shrugs*). I'll give both a chance. (Not that I'm in the target audience anyway.)\n\nTwo of Nick's biggest cartoon hits were about a talking sponge and talking babies. I have no idea what'll be the next big hit. Not saying anything here will definitely be this...\n\nThose are some pretty big exceptions and really the point of naming the show \"Blank and Blank\" is to make you aware of who the title two characters are and that they are the main focus of the show.

I just feel like it makes the show seem rather bland right off the bat. Take Adventure Time. The full name is \"Adventure Time with Finn & Jake\" but by having a recognizable name (it's shouted in all the new episode promos) it makes the series stick out. And I guarantee you that most kids watching Adventure Time know the names of the protagonists.\n\nBut I digress, hopefully we'll hear more about these series soon.\n\nFrom The Hollywood Reporter, Marathon Media of France, best known for creating Totally Spies, and Nickelodeon are working together to create a new cartoon called Blake and the Aliens.\n\n“The plot involves the 13 year-old boy Blake, who one morning gets jumped by a trio of evil, alien squirrels. The squirrels have been sent from the future to undermine Blake’s self-esteem, ensuring he does not grow up to become the superhero Captain Blake, defender of the universe and their sworn enemy.”\n\nA show about evil alien squirrels from the future sent to undermine a boy's self esteem?\n\nThat's...the best idea for a TV show EVER."
