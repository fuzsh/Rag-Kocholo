The half-hour premiere also delivered more kids 6-11 than any other Nick animated series premiere, averaging an 11.0/2.3 million K6-11. Additionally, it was the best new series premiere performance ever with tweens, averaging a 10.8/2.3 million T9-14.\n\n(Photo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20090330/NY91078 )\n\nHighlights for The Penguins of Madagascar premiere include:\n\n-- The Penguins of Madagascar premiere episode \"Launchtime\" (Saturday, March 28, 9:30 p.m. [ET/PT]) broke Nickelodeon records as the most-watched series premiere in Nickelodeon's history (replacing prior record holder All Grown Up in 2003 with 5.2 million total viewers), drawing 6.1 million total viewers (P2+), up +65% in delivery over last year.\n\n-- The telecast was Nick's most-watched and highest-rated animated premiere with kids 6-11, averaging an 11.0/2.3 million with K6-11, up +51% in rating.\n\n-- \"Launchtime\" drew the largest tween audience and rating for a Nickelodeon series premiere, posting a 10.8/2.3 million T9-14, up +54%.\n\n-- Penguins averaged an 8.5/3.0 million K2-11, up +53% and the second most-watched premiere in Nick's history with this demographic.\n\n-- The Penguins of Madagascar delivered the highest rating ever for a show that followed the Kids' Choice Awards, retaining 77% of the KCA audience.\n\n-- A Penguins of Madagascar dedicated mini site, which launched on Oct. 30, 2008, drew 2.4 million unique visitors since its debut, and featured a series of four new mini-games, which garnered 1.5 million game plays (3/12/09-3/30/09).\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar premiere followed Nickelodeon's 2009 Kids' Choice Awards, which set a new record on Saturday, March 28, (8-9:30 p.m. ET/PT) as the biggest Kids' Choice Awards to date.
