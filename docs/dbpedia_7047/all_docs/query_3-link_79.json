        "text": "Background\n\nNickelodeon Productions is the New York-based production arm of American cable channel Nickelodeon, that provides original sitcoms, animated shows and game-related programs for the channel.\n\n1st Logo (September 6, 1988-January 6, 2009)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, one of various orange shapes is seen with Nickelodeon text inside, and with (or without) copyright info underneath. These are the shapes the Nickelodeon typeface may be present within, with details regarding its animation either present or absent:\n\nBat.\n\nTurkey.\n\nSplat.\n\nHeart: The copyright stamp \"c 1991 MTV NETWORKS, INC.\" is first seen at the bottom of the screen in white. Then, the Nickelodeon logo in the form of a heart slides down into the middle while rotating 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nHaypile.\n\nBanner.\n\nScribble.\n\nElephant: An orange elephant with Nickelodeon text on it raising its trunk.\n\nGiraffe: The legs of an orange giraffe with Nickelodeon text on it running.\n\nLeopard: An orange leopard with Nickelodeon text on it walking and roaring.\n\nUFO.\n\nPencil.\n\nTrivia: The Splat logo was also used at the beginning of the Wild & Crazy Kids! intro. The Splat logo's design was also used for the sign at the front of Nickelodeon Studios, and the Banner's logo design was used for the bench at the Nickelodeon Animation Studios.\n\nCopyrights: Only for the Haypile.\n\nAugust 11, 1991-April 13, 1995: \"(C)(year) MTV Networks\"\n\n1994-1997: \"(C)(year) Nickelodeon\"\n\n1995-2005: \"(C)(year) VIACOM\" or \"(C)VIACOM (year)\"\n\nVariants:\n\nA variant of the Haypile logo with no copyright info exists.\n\nOn the original Rugrats pilot, the Haypile logo is darker, possibly due to the quality of the master.\n\nOn Season 1 episodes of Ren & Stimpy, the Haypile logo is slightly redder.\n\nOn Season 1 episodes of Hey Arnold!, the copyright info is in a chalk-like font.\n\nStarting in late 1997, the copyright stamp for the Haypile logo's \"Nickelodeon\" variant was extended to say: \"Copyright (year) Nickelodeon, a programming service of Viacom International Inc. (NAME OF SHOW) and all related titles, logos, and characters are trademarks of Nickelodeon, a programming service of Viacom International Inc.\"\n\nOn Nick News Special Edition: A Conversation with Magic Johnson, the Scribble logo is upside-down while the Nickelodeon wordmark remains on the shape.\n\nSometimes, this logo also shares the screen with other logos.\n\nTechnique: Usually a still image, but for the Heart, Elephant, Giraffe and Leopard variants, analog computer animation.\n\nAudio: The closing theme of the show/special or none.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nFor the Elephant variant, it's along with the elephant trumpeting.\n\nFor the Giraffe variant, the sounds of a stampede are heard.\n\nFor the Leopard variant, it's along with the leopard roaring.\n\nOn most episodes of Rugrats and its spin-off All Grown Up!, as well as The Wild Thornberrys, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, Rocket Power, and As Told by Ginger, a soundbite from the episode is heard on the Haypile logo (this was not present on earlier seasons of Rugrats).\n\nOn the first two seasons of Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, the tail-end of the Klasky Csupo \"Graffiti\" logo's music plays over the Haypile logo.\n\nOn Doug, the Jumbo Pictures music carries over to the Haypile and Pencil logos.\n\nOn the Rugrats episode \"The Baby Vanishes!\" / \"Farewell, My Friend...\", an audio engineer (Kurt Vanzo) is heard saying \"We're gonna keep you going even longer than that next time, we'll do it one more time.\" (tying into how in the end credits for said episode, Tommy and Chuckie are heard arguing over whether the basement in their home is scary or not). This variant was often taken out of future Nickelodeon airings due to split-screen credits, but was later put back in on The '90s Are All That airings prior to that block's rebranding as The Splat.\n\nOn the original pilot version of The Ren & Stimpy Show episode \"Big House Blues\", Calliope by Jac Holzman is heard during the Haypile logo, since the ending theme didn't trail into the Carbunkle Cartoons and Spümcø logos.\n\nOn a DVD release of The Amanda Show, the Haypile logo has the buzzing sounds of the 1996 Nickelodeon Productions logo.\n\nOn DVD and VHS releases of The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, the Haypile logo had the same audio as the variant of the Nickelodeon Animation Studios logo with the first few notes of the show's theme and Jimmy saying \"Gotta blast!\"\n\nOn a December 2001 CBS airing of the Rugrats episodes \"Rugrats: The Santa Experience\" and \"A Rugrats Chanukah\", the Haypile logo used a generic theme.\n\nAvailability: Depends on where the variants would appear.\n\nBat: It appeared on Nickelodeon airings of Count Duckula. Newer prints of said show are derived from UK masters which don't contain this logo.\n\nTurkey: Seen on Nick's Thanksgiving Fest.\n\nSplat: Seen on Wild & Crazy Kids! and also on various Sony Wonder-distributed Nickelodeon VHS tapes, such as Ren & Stimpy: Classics II and at least one VHS release of The Adventures of Pete & Pete.\n\nHeart: Seen on original airings of The Adventures of Pete and Pete special \"The Valentine's Day Massacre\". That special was later repackaged as a standard Pete and Pete episode, with this logo plastered by the normal \"balloon\" logo on subsequent airings and by the Haypile logo on the 2005 Season 1 DVD.\n\nHaypile: This is cited as the easiest to find of this collection of variants. Even though it's become a victim of plastering with the 2009 and 2017 logos, it's still easy to find on VHS and DVD releases of Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. series released from 1991 until 2009. This variant is the basis for the most-known Nickelodeon logo in the category of home media.\n\nIt made its earliest known appearance on the Rugrats pilot \"Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing\" (produced in 1990), but it didn't make its debut on television until August 11, 1991, the day the first three Nicktoons (Doug, Rugrats, and The Ren & Stimpy Show) premiered.\n\nThe MTV Networks copyright variant can be seen on VHS tapes and DVDs of Rugrats episodes from the era (including the pilot), VHS tapes and DVDs of early episodes of Rocko's Modern Life, and 1991-1994 episodes of The Ren & Stimpy Show on VHS (the Season 1 and 2 DVDs edit it out, but it's still intact on the Seasons 3 and a Half-ish and Season 5 and Some More of 4 DVDs), and VHS tapes and DVDs of pre-1994 episodes of Doug.\n\nThe Nickelodeon byline variant was used for a short time and concurrently with the Viacom copyright variant from 1995-1996. It can be seen on VHS tapes of some Rugrats episodes from the era, VHS tapes and DVDs of The Ren & Stimpy Show episodes from the era, VHS tapes of some Rocko's Modern Life episodes from the era, and season 1-3 episodes of AAAHH!!! Real Monsters on VHS. It was also seen on The Angry Beavers 1994 pilot episode \"Snowbound\".\n\nThe Viacom variant can be seen on all Nicktoons until 1997, when they switched to the Nicktoons/Nickelodeon Animation Studios logo. At that point, only Klasky-Csupo shows such as Rugrats, As Told by Ginger, and The Wild Thornberrys used this logo.\n\nThe 1997 variant only be found on late 1997 episodes of Rugrats and Aaahh!!! Real Monsters.\n\nThe first three seasons of Rocko's Modern Life released through Shout! Factory have this logo intact.\n\nThe \"Big House Blues\" variant, though, is not only edited out in the seasons 1 & 2 DVD releases in addition to the other episodes, but when aired, the episode shares \"In the Army\"'s credits.\n\nThis logo also appeared on the obscure Rugrats Pre-School Daze series, which can be found as a bonus feature the Rugrats Tales From the Crib DVDs. It was also intact on MTV airings of The Ren & Stimpy Show.\n\nThis doesn't appear on certain animated Nick shows such as KaBlam! and Pelswick, which used the 1996 \"lightbulb\" logo instead.\n\nThis logo used to be preserved on airings of shows on The 90s Are All That block on TeenNick (later The Splat, then NickSplat, and finally NickRewind), but due to the block later adopting Nickelodeon's \"credits on the last scene\" format, it is no longer seen and is plastered by the 2009 logo (or sometimes one of the 2017 logos). However, AAAHH!!! Real Monsters and The Ren & Stimpy Show kept it intact during that time (the latter also kept the original credits intact).\n\nBanner: Appears on the first three seasons of Are You Afraid of the Dark?. It is preserved on DVD releases.\n\nScribble: Seen on episodes of Nick News from its premiere in 1992 until 2000. The show last reran on TeenNick (on \"The Splat\") on November 5, 2016, when an episode was shown to commemorate the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nElephant: Seen on The Nickelodeon Wild Side Show, last aired on Noggin (now Nick Jr.) on March 31, 2002.\n\nGiraffe: Seen on a season 1 episode of The Nickelodeon Wild Side Show.\n\nLeopard: Seen on a season 1 episode of The Nickelodeon Wild Side Show.\n\nUFO: Seen on The Tomorrow People.\n\nPencil: Seen only on the Doug VHS tape, Cool in School.\n\nLegacy: The Haypile variant is considered a favorite of many, and in general, this logo is fondly remembered for those who grew up with older Nickelodeon animated shows.\n\n2nd Logo (July 4, 1993-September 27, 2009)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, the Nickelodeon logo in the shape of a hard-to-describe ovular balloon shape rotates, pops up, and stays on screen. Copyright info is shown below, or sometimes not.\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, the logo does not rotate; it just pops up.\n\nAn in-credit variant with the words \"In behalf of...\" appears on German prints of The Ren & Stimpy Show.\n\nAt the end of the teaser trailer for Good Burger, the logo appears tilted.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: None or the closing theme of the show.\n\nAvailability:\n\nAppeared on The Adventures of Pete & Pete, Weinerville (which last aired when NickSplat was still The Splat), the telecast of the 1994 Kids Choice Awards, the 1996 edition of The Big Help and on Nick News episodes from 2001 to 2009.\n\nThis logo was also used as part of a 1996-98 Nickelodeon break bumper.\n\n3rd Logo (July 10, 1993-April 29, 1995)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, an orange wireframe jack spins in from the top left corner of the screen and then moves into place. It then materializes in orange, with the Nickelodeon wordmark on it. Copyright info is shown below.\n\nVariant: On the first season of All That, the logo is a bit smaller, appears on a navy blue gradient background, and animates differently. It zooms in while spinning, and the jack itself is fully rendered throughout.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: The closing theme of the show, along with a wind chime sound.\n\nAudio Variant: Season 1 of All That has Soup's spiel for the Nickelodeon Studios logo for the show play over this logo.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThe variant with the black background first appeared on Roundhouse, which occasionally aired on NickSplat until 2017 (it is unknown if it kept this logo intact or plastered it with the 2009 logo, though one of these two possibilities is more likely). This logo is also intact on Roundhouse episodes featured on the Nick Snicks Friendship and Nick Snicks the Family VHS tapes from the early 1990s.\n\nThe blue background variant was last seen in 2005, when season 1 episodes of All That were rerun on Nickelodeon.\n\n4th Logo (September 18, 1993-2004?)\n\nVisuals: During the opening of a show, several 3D Nickelodeon logos of different shapes and sizes (including a balloon, crayon, leaf, hat, crown, gear, top, bone, jack, key, etc.) cover the screen. Then, the logo animates in reverse, and the opening continues.\n\nVariant: Another version exists where all of the objects are replaced with 2D orange eggs, the \"Nickelodeon\" text also appears in a different typeface (most likely the same font that used in Nick's promo endtags between 1993 and 1996).\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: The opening theme of the show. For the variant, consecutive popping sounds when the eggs appear.\n\nAvailability: This logo was made to signify Nickelodeon's involvement in their series for international markets where the brand was less well-known.\n\nIt appeared on early episodes of Rocko's Modern Life and KaBlam!. Newer airings of these shows often cut this logo out, but it was left intact on NickRewind airings of the Rocko's Modern Life episodes \"Power Trip\" / \"To Heck and Back\" and \"Down the Hatch\" / \"Road Rash\".\n\nOn the Rocko's Modern Life: The Complete Series DVD release, it appeared on the season 4 episode \"Wimp on the Barby\" / \"Yarn Benders\", despite it only appearing on season 1 episodes.\n\nIt also appeared on reruns of Kenan and Kel, Doug, Hey Arnold!, and Rugrats.\n\nIt is still intact on Canadian and Australian airings of Rocko's Modern Life and The Ren and Stimpy Show.\n\nThe variant only appears on certain episodes of Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, which is still intact on Australian airings.\n\n5th Logo (September 4, 1994-2004)\n\nVisuals: Over a black background, there is an orange atom surrounded by three purple, yellow-green, and blue particles, flying from the top right to the bottom left. It flies to the center and turns to reveal the word \"NICKELODEON\" on it. The copyright info is shown below.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn season 2 of All That and season 1 of Kenan & Kel, the logo cuts to the Nickelodeon Studios logo.\n\nSometimes, the copyright info is absent.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe closing theme of the show, or silent, as in the case of All That.\n\nOn at least one episode of All That and pre-September 2000 split-screen credits airings of Kenan & Kel, the buzzing sound from the Nickelodeon Productions \"Lightbulb\" logo (10th logo on this page) was used.\n\nSeason 1 of Kenan & Kel has Kenan Thompson's spiel for the Nickelodeon Studios logo for the show play over this logo.\n\nAvailability: It appeared on some episodes of The Adventures of Pete and Pete, later episodes of Weinerville, season 2 episodes of All That (including the Good Burger Special) and season 1 of Kenan & Kel (which is available on iTunes), the Nickelodeon Sports Theater with Shaquille O'Neal (which last aired on Nicktoons in 2014) and on pre-September 2000 split-screen credits airings of Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Cousin Skeeter, Kenan & Kel, and The Angry Beavers. This logo was also used as part of a 1996-98 \"next on Nickelodeon\" ID and on break bumpers for KaBlam!.\n\n6th Logo (October 1, 1994-September 28, 1996)\n\nVisuals: A 3D Nickelodeon cap spins in. The copyright info is shown below.\n\nVariant: There is an animated version in which 3D hats fall from the top of the screen on a sky background, with the Nickelodeon hat among them, and it stops when the whole hat is in view.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: The closing theme of the show.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt appears on the last two seasons (before the reboot in 1999) of Are You Afraid of the Dark? and the first two seasons of The Secret World of Alex Mack, both of which preserve the logo on DVD releases.\n\nThe animated version was only used as a station ID.\n\n7th Logo (January 2, 1995-September 3?, 2000)\n\nVisuals: On a sky background with moving clouds, an orange housefly comes from the the top of the screen and flies around in circles twice before stopping right in front of us. \"NICKELODEON\" is written in its familiar font on the fly.\n\nVariant: On March-September 2000 airings of KaBlam!, Hey Arnold!, The Amanda Show, and Rocket Power episodes using the split-screen credits, the background is black and a copyright notice is below. The fly buzzing noise is absent.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: The end theme of the show, along with a fly buzzing.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSeen on season 3 episodes of Legends of the Hidden Temple.\n\nThe black background version was seen on the aforementioned shows.\n\nIt was also used as part of two \"next on Nickelodeon\" IDs from 1996.\n\n8th Logo (June 25, 1995-September 3?, 2000)\n\nVisuals: Over a black background, a Saturn-shaped Nickelodeon logo flies up from the bottom of the screen, orbited by two purple and blue moons. It settles in the center of the screen, and \"PRODUCTIONS\" in white spaced-out letters pops up from the bottom, settling under the logo.\n\nTrivia: This logo may be a nod to the T-shirt worn by Rugrats character Chuckie Finster, which has the planet Saturn on it.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Space Cases, the word \"PRODUCTIONS\" is omitted.\n\nOn March-September 2000 airings of Doug, Oh Yeah! Cartoons, and All That episodes, as well as the Blue's Clues: Blue's Discoveries VHS, the word \"PRODUCTIONS\" is replaced by a copyright notice.\n\nTowards the end of Nickelodeon Germany's off-air sampler program, at the end of the Aaahh!!! Real Monsters segment \"Coming July 1st\", the logo is superimposed over the final shot of \"The Switching Hour\". As the camera zooms into the dollhouse, the text flies away and the logo appears without \"PRODUCTIONS\" or copyright info.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: The ending theme of the show.\n\nAudio Variant: On March-September 2000 airings of All That, a soundbite from the Tollin/Robbins Productions logo (along with the buzzing sound from the Nickelodeon Productions \"Lightbulb\" logo) continues into this logo.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSeen on Space Cases and Global Guts (the latter of which can be found on iTunes).\n\nIt was also seen after Nickelodeon airings of Doug, Oh Yeah! Cartoons, and All That between March and September 2000, and was used as part of a 1996-98 \"next on Nickelodeon\" ID.\n\n9th Logo (January 27, 1996)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, an orange 3D cup spins around, with the word \"NICK\" on it. The cup then falls, causing an orange liquid with the \"NICKELODEON\" logo on it to come out. The copyright stamp is seen below.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: The end theme for Oh, Brother! Starring Stick Stickly.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt was seen at the end of the Nickelodeon TV special Oh, Brother! Starring Stick Stickly, which never airs on TV anymore.\n\nThis can also be seen on some TV spots of Good Burger and the Good Burger Good Sweepstakes promotion, despite the actual movie using the 2nd Nickelodeon Movies logo.\n\n10th Logo (May 11, 1996-August 23, 2008)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a Nickelodeon logo shaped like a lightbulb is seen, with a green electric charge surrounding the bulb and forming the word \"productioNs\" (set in a modified version of the Variex Regular font) on the bottom-right side. The lighting of the electric charge can be seen flickering. The copyright information is below in a different font depending on the show (it's absent on some shows such as Romeo!).\n\nTrivia: The logo's design is likely inspired by the 1997 Nickelodeon electronics by Long Hall Technologies.\n\nVariants:\n\nJust for Kicks has a trademark symbol next to the lightbulb.\n\nFor the telecast of the 1999 Kids' Choice Awards, an extended version was used where the lightbulb is in a violet and purple lighted environment with green and purple swirling shapes. The lightbulb is first seen, with the Nickelodeon wordmark mirrored. The camera slightly zooms away from it and then zooms towards the bulb quickly. When they come in contact, the screen flips and the lightbulb flips around. The camera zooms away and back to the bulb again, as if it's bouncing on it. Finally, when the camera zooms towards the bulb a third time, the electric charge and the word \"productioNs\" come in to their respective places. The camera then zooms away and finally stops. The lightbulb flexes for a few seconds and purple and red stars spin around the logo (in a \"dizzy\"-like situation). Finally, the lightbulb glows and the background flickers to black, with the electric charge and the word \"productioNs\" disappearing for a split-second before finally reappearing, completing the already-formed standard logo, complete with the usual buzzing sound.\n\nOn German prints of Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, the lightbulb is replaced with an orange Nick splat logo.\n\nAn in-credit variant was spotted on an episode of All That.\n\nThere's a different variant where the logo is rotating from right to leftover footage from the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \"Jellyfishing\", then it gives a bright light.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation for the normal logo and the Kids' Choice Awards variant. The rotating variant was produced by Studio City.\n\nAudio: A buzzing sound; the volume varies with each show.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSome shows just played the ending theme.\n\nOn Mr. Meaty, later episodes of The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo, and some early season 6 episodes of The Fairly OddParents, the buzzing sound played over the end theme (this audio variant also appeared on split-screen credits of Mr. Meaty, where this logo was plastered by the 17th Nickelodeon logo).\n\nThe 1999 Kids' Choice Awards variant has a deep-sounding synth tune (sounding almost like it was played on a didgeridoo) followed by a cymbal crash and twinkling noises, which segues into the normal buzzing sound.\n\nOn Action League Now!, the Flying Mallet, Inc. theme continues into this logo.\n\nSeason 2 of Kenan & Kel has Kenan Thompson's spiel for the Nickelodeon Studios logo for the show play over the logo with the buzzing sounds intact.\n\nOn Nickelodeon airings of Scaredy Camp, the electricity sparking from the start of the Invader Zim episode \"The Nightmare Begins\" (which used in the Nicktoons splat logo) is heard.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThe animated version with the purple background was only used for the telecast of the 1999 Kids' Choice Awards.\n\nThis logo can be seen at the end of Kenan & Kel (starting with season 2), along with reruns on NickSplat (not falling victim to the split-screen (and the \"over the last scene\") credits), as well as pre-2007 Nick series such as Drake & Josh, Unfabulous, and the first 4 episodes of iCarly.\n\nSome animated Nickelodeon shows used this logo in favor of the 1991 \"haypile\" logo, such as KaBlam!, at least one early Season 6 episode of The Fairly OddParents, and Pelswick. While this logo isn't usually preserved on DVDs and VHS tapes of Nick shows, it's usually replaced by the 1991 \"haypile\" logo.\n\nThis logo is still retained on instant streaming prints of Nick shows from the time, such as on Paramount+. Also preserved on VOD prints of Drake and Josh and Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide.\n\nThough Schneider's Bakery shows eventually stopped using this in favor of the 2007 logo, Just Jordan kept this logo until the show ended in 2008.\n\nThis logo appeared when NickSplat reran Double Dare 2000 in celebration of Double Dare's revival during the week of June 29, 2018.\n\nThe Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide variant is cut off entirely in the end credits on German TV channels.\n\nThe short version of this logo also appeared on the Where Nick Was Made video, uploaded by the Splat/NickRewind YouTube channel on May 26, 2016.\n\nThis logo was plastered by the 1990 haypile logo on some prints of Drake & Josh and Zoey 101.\n\nThis logo was also seen on the unaired television pilot of It Ain't Right, an original pilot for Just Jordan.\n\nThis logo was used in tandem with the 2006 and 2007 \"CGI Splat\" logos and the 2008 \"lightbulb\" logo.\n\nThe rotating variant was seen during the Nickelodeon portion on Studio City's 2001 Demo reel.\n\n11th Logo (February 9, 1997)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, there is an orange, hot dog-shaped balloon inflating. The balloon then transforms into a balloon dog with the Nickelodeon wordmark on it.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: The ending theme of the special.\n\nAvailability:\n\nOnly appears on the 1997 TV special Stick Stickly in \"Stuck\", which had rerun on NickRewind numerous amount of times and has made the logo easier to find.\n\nThe logo animation seen here was also used in a 1996-98 \"next on Nickelodeon\" ID.\n\n12th Logo (Renford Rejects variant) (February 23, 1998-March 28, 2001)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a soccer ball-shaped Nickelodeon logo drops down, and a copyright notice appears below.\n\nTechnique: Digital 2D animation.\n\nAudio: A ball drop sound effect.\n\nAvailability: Seen on the British series Renford Rejects, which last reran on Nickelodeon UK in 2020.\n\n13th Logo (1999-2006?)\n\nVisuals: On a white background, there is an orange ball of slime bouncing on a trampoline (which has a sky blue pad, gray supports, and orange rimming) three times, with each bounce producing three orange pulses as the camera shifts around it, briefly showing a blue \"sky\". After the third bounce, the blob flies towards the screen as the text \"NICKELODEON\" appears on it and it continues to wave, as the words \"A\" and \"PRODUCTION\" appear letter-by-letter in orange. In the lower right corner, 4 translucent orange rings pulse out as the blob stops waving, becomes 2D, and changes its shape before cutting to the show.\n\nVariant: There is a variant seen on international airings of Rocket Power, which only shows the Nickelodeon logo.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation.\n\nAudio: Three bouncing sounds, followed by the first eight notes of the Nickelodeon theme being played on off-key percussion and a synthesizer (via a saxophone preset).\n\nAvailability: This can be seen on Latin American prints of Nickelodeon shows, such as episodes of Pistas de Blue (the Latin American Spanish dub of Blue's Clues) on Nick on Demand En Español. In Latin America, it is seen on some season 3 episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants, the first season of Dora the Explorer, and some episodes of Blue's Clues, As Told by Ginger, The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, and Rocket Power.\n\n14th Logo (Cry Baby Lane variant) (October 28, 2000)\n\nVisuals: Over a black background is the Nickelodeon wordmark inside an orange oval, and the word \"presents\" below.\n\nTechnique: A still image.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt was only seen on Cry Baby Lane, which was last seen on NickSplat on October 31, 2016.\n\nHowever, later airings removed this logo and cut straight to the film instead.\n\n15th Logo (South Korean Blue's Clues variant) (2000-2001)\n\nVisuals: On a white background, an orange oval with the Nickelodeon wordmark is seen. Copyright info is shown below.\n\nTechnique: A still image.\n\nAudio: The closing theme of the show.\n\nAvailability: Only seen on the South Korean adaptation of Blue's Clues.\n\n16th Logo (September 4, 2000-September 2006)\n\nVisuals: On a light blue background, the Nick logo with a weird shape (usually \"Cloud 2\") bounces around the screen before stopping in the center. Copyright info (which varies in font depending on the show it follows) appears below. Sometimes, copyright info can be seen while the logo is animating.\n\nObjects:\n\nBaroque\n\nElectron\n\nEvolution\n\nAmoeba\n\nFlower\n\nRadishes\n\nFrontier\n\nCloud 2\n\nTrivia:\n\nThis logo is based on the main on-air look that Nickelodeon used from September 4, 2000 to October 10, 2002, which was designed by AdamsMorioka. Also, this logo debuted on the same day that said rebrand took effect.\n\nAccording to the designers, each shape has a name. See the captions of the pictures above for details.\n\nOn 2010-13 airings of Klasky-Csupo-produced Nicktoons with split-screen credits, between the transition of KC's \"Splaat\" logo and the 2009 Nickelodeon logo, a split-second of this logo can barely be seen (just the blue background).\n\nThe \"kids laughing\" audio is taken from the Hanna-Barbera \"Lost Treasures\" sound effects library; it was used in the Wunschpunch episode \"Terrible Toddlers\" and a commercial for Wowwee's Untamed.\n\nTechnique: 2D (presumably Flash) animation.\n\nVariants:\n\nA still version with no copyright notice exists.\n\nAn animated version with no copyright notice also exists, and is known to have appeared on an airing of Barbie of Swan Lake. The \"Cloud 2\" shape is seen when the logo animates, but changes to the \"Flower\" shape when it stops.\n\nOn The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, the Frederator-produced Nicktoons (some early season 2 episodes of The Fairly OddParents actually used this while other episodes used the Nicktoons splat), Danny Phantom, The X's, and Invader Zim, this logo was used in tandem with the Nicktoons/Nickelodeon Animation Studios logo until 2006.\n\nOn Taina, the 1996 \"lightbulb\" logo and the Nickelodeon Studios logo are used instead of this one.\n\nOn airings of the Mattel films Barbie: The Princess and the Pauper and Barbie: Mermaidia (and possibly other Mattel movies and specials), an alternate version exists where the background is white and the Mattel logo appears in place of the Nickelodeon logo. Also, the copyright notice is edited to refer to Mattel instead of Nickelodeon. Sometimes, this variant lacks copyright info.\n\nAudio: Depends on the era:\n\nSeptember 4, 2000-July 2001:\n\nThe ending theme of the show.\n\nOn shows such as The Amanda Show, the audio from the 1996 \"lightbulb\" logo is used.\n\nThe sounds of an engine revving and a xylophone ditty that ends when the logo stops moving. Some shows such as Ren & Stimpy and Are You Afraid of the Dark? have their ending theme cut off for this.\n\nThe audio from the preceding promo on Nickelodeon's split-screen credits is sometimes used.\n\nAn odd buzzing sound, which was used on airings of shows such as Doug and Are You Afraid of the Dark? in October 2000.\n\nThree laser sounds, which were used on mid-2000 airings of Ren & Stimpy.\n\nAugust 2001-September 2006:\n\nA synthesized sound effect of kids laughing; it also features a boy hooting, a kid screaming before the third laugh and a girl (who sounds similar to Angelica Pickles from Rugrats) laughing evilly. It's quite loud and sounds briefly clipped at the start. The sound later became the signature laugh of Nickelodeon and would also later be featured in the 17th and 19th logos.\n\nThe ending theme of the show.\n\nOn the Mattel version, a majestic tune.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn Rugrats, The Wild Thornberrys, Rocket Power, and As Told by Ginger, the \"Boing!\" sound effect from the KC \"Splaat\" logo segues into this logo's \"kids laughing\" audio.\n\nOn certain shows like SpongeBob SquarePants, Hey Arnold!, CatDog, The Angry Beavers, and Doug, the preceding logo's audio plays over this logo.\n\nOn at least one airing of Hey Arnold!, the \"kids laughing\" audio and the continued Snee-Oosh theme both play.\n\nFor a brief time in summer 2005, there was an announcer (possibly a female adult or an older child) that said \"Next on Nick, [SHOW NAME].\"\n\nDuring split-screen credits of The Amanda Show and on one episode of Pelswick, the buzzing sound from the 1996 \"lightbulb\" logo was used.\n\nOn Butt-Ugly Martians, the \"kids laughing\" audio cuts from the middle.\n\nAvailability: Was mainly used during split-screen credits between shows from 2000 to 2006 (which was done to simplify the creation of the credits).\n\nThis did not appear on several airings of Avatar: The Last Airbender, whose split-screen credits omitted this logo in favor of the NAS \"Nickelodeon splat\".\n\nSometimes, it appeared on shows that weren't made by Nickelodeon but had split-screen credits, like Speed Racer X, My Dad the Rock Star and Butt-Ugly Martians.\n\nThis logo was also used on the Nick on CBS block, due to the fact that the credits used for each show on the block were the same ones that Nickelodeon used.\n\nThe still version was last seen on TeenNick's 2011 rebroadcast of the 2000 Nick TV movie Cry Baby Lane; however, later airings on NickSplat removed that logo.\n\n17th Logo (May 27, 2006-September 12, 2011)\n\nVisuals: On a white/light blue gradient with green CGI bubbles, a bubble bursts and turns into a CGI Nickelodeon logo. Copyright info is shown below.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThis logo was based on Nickelodeon's \"Nick Extra\" bumpers used from 2006 to 2008, as well as the network's branding from the same year.\n\nA similar concept would later be used for the next logo, which is described below.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Wayside, orange text reading \"This has been a presentation of\" (in the same font as the show's credits) is seen above.\n\nA widescreen version of this variant exists which is slightly zoomed in and stretched.\n\nAnother version of this variant exists where the text on the top is in a more generic font.\n\nOn season 1 (and early episodes of season 2) of Back at the Barnyard, Wayside, one episode of SpongeBob SquarePants, and The Fairly OddParents special \"77 Secrets Revealed!\", the logo lacks copyright info.\n\nOn all of the Three Delivery shorts, the logo is completely still.\n\nOn one episode of the short-lived show Making Fiends, the logo is grayscale.\n\nOn a 2007 airing of Just Jordan (if one looks closely near the end) the 2006 copyright stamp appears due to a plastering error.\n\nOn an airing of SpongeBob SquarePants from September 26, 2009, this logo appeared for one frame after the 2009 logo (which wouldn't begin full-time use for another two days) due to a split-screen credits error.\n\nA high-definition widescreen version exists where the 4:3 logo is sandwiched in between two cyan lines.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation by Nick's in-house team.\n\nAudio: Normally the ending theme of the show, or silence.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSometimes, it's the \"kids laughing\" audio from the previous logo.\n\nThe preceding logo's audio on split-screen credits of SpongeBob SquarePants and Hey Arnold!.\n\nWhen this logo was first used during the summer of 2006, it had its own \"POP!\" sound and gurgling sounds that would later be reused for the next logo. It was also used on the iCarly episode \"iWanna Stay with Spencer\".\n\nOn the The Naked Brothers Band episode \"Naked Idol\", an odd variant is used where another copy of the \"kids laughing\" audio, slightly cut-off at the beginning, plays over the regular, uncut \"kids laughing\" audio. The ending theme (which fades out during this logo) also accompanies it. This also occurs with the 19th logo if it was to follow instead.\n\nOn the behind the scenes featurette of The Last Day of Summer, a different splatting noise is used.\n\nOn Back at the Barnyard, a short country tune from the opening theme is played.\n\nOn El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera, a quote from the episode is heard.\n\nOn split-screen credits of Jimmy Neutron episodes, the logo has the \"Gotta blast!\" audio from the show's variant of the NAS \"Nicktoons\" logo used in tandem with this logo.\n\nOn split-screen credits of Mr. Meaty, this logo plasters the 1996 \"lightbulb\" logo, and has that logo's audio as a result. This was likely due to the \"lightbulb\" logo's audio being mixed in with the ending theme of the show.\n\nOn split-screen credits of El Tigre, the \"kids laughing\" audio is used in a noticeably higher pitch and cuts the show's ending theme off abruptly. This only happened on Nickelodeon airings, as Nicktoons airings kept the end theme playing over this logo.\n\nOn Nickelodeon airings of the Team Umizoomi episodes \"Counting Comet\" and \"Ice Cream Truck\", the Bubble Guppies episode \"Boy Meets Squirrel!\", the Dora the Explorer episode \"Baseball Boots\" from August 8, 2011 and the 2010 airing of Dora's Explorer Girls, this logo was used due to plastering errors, and as a result, the 2009 Nickelodeon logo (for all 3 shows), as well as the logos for Curious Pictures (Team Umizoomi) and Wildbrain Entertainment (Bubble Guppies) were plastered at once while retaining their respective audio.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThe first confirmed sighting of this logo was during an airing of ChalkZone on May 27, 2006. It was sporadically used during the summer of 2006, but it didn't fully come into effect until September of that year. Nick used this logo for split screen credits until March 2008 (shows on Nickelodeon's TEENick block continued to use this logo, even after most shows switched to the 19th logo in January 2008). However, it was also used outside of the split-screen credits as a proper logo.\n\nThe first use of this logo outside of split-screen credits was on The Naked Brothers Band in January 2007. It appeared on Tak and the Power of Juju and season 1 and early season 2 episodes of Back at the Barnyard. It was also retained on split-screen credits of some shows on Nicktoons until that network's 2009 rebranding. Also, during Nickelodeon's \"Ultimate SpongeBob SpongeBash\" marathon in July 2009, this logo was used during the split-screen credits of all SpongeBob episodes.\n\nIt's also been spotted on some pre-2014 airings of The Fairly OddParents episode \"Fairly OddBaby\", which kept the original ending credits and logos intact despite the credits being displayed on the bottom-left of the screen, and had the 2009 Nickelodeon logo play on the bottom right of the screen.\n\nThis is also seen internationally (unlike the 2009 logo without the word \"Productions\"). It was also shown on early season 6 episodes of The Fairly OddParents, as well as late season 5 and early season 6 episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\nIt was also seen on US airings of early El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera episodes, as well as Three Delivery shorts on Nicktoons (the latter of which have not re-aired since). It also appeared on the first three episodes of The Mighty B!.\n\nThe extended version was used on some DVDs of Nick shows from around late 2008 until sometime in 2009, such as on SpongeBob SquarePants: To SquarePants or Not to SquarePants.\n\n18th Logo (October 6, 2007-October 3, 2009)\n\nVisuals: On a teal-white radial gradient background with green bubbles (similar to the previous logo), there is an orange blob reading \"NICKELODEON\". It floats around for a second, then it rams into the screen and turns into a splat. The end result is quite similar to the previous logo, but with less detailed and a more spaced-out name. The copyright info is below.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation by Nick's in-house team.\n\nAudio: Same bubble and splatting sounds from the previous logo.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt was seen on Schneider's Bakery sitcoms such as the first couple seasons of iCarly, starting with the episode \"iNevel\" and last seen on the episode \"iCarly Awards\" (early episodes had the 1996 \"Lightbulb\" logo), and the final season of Zoey 101, along with Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh. Later Netflix airings of iCarly use the 20th logo.\n\nThis logo is still preserved on Amazon Prime Video and Paramount+ prints of said series.\n\nWhenever Nickelodeon re-airs Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh, the over-the-last-scene credits play, causing this logo to be plastered with one of the 2017 logos below.\n\nHowever, it is also intact on the movie's DVD release.\n\nAlso, on TeenNick airings of the iCarly special \"iGo to Japan\", this logo is intact due to the fact that the special's original credits play at the end.\n\n19th Logo (January 30, 2008-July 8, 2013)\n\nVisuals: Over a black background is the Nickelodeon orange splat logo in 2D. Then, the background glows dark orange, and the splat transforms into an orange CGI lightbulb (as described below):\n\nThe splat grows as its shape changes to that of a lightbulb and the \"NICKELODEON\" text stretches towards the screen. The splat then zooms out via a rather blurry iris-out effect, revealing the Nickelodeon logo as a lightbulb. The lightbulb then rotates towards the screen. A reflection can be seen underneath both the splat and the lightbulb. The lightbulb then changes back to the splat at the end.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThis logo was based off of Nickelodeon's \"transforming splat\" screenbugs from July 2006 to September 2009.\n\nThe logo was made as a replacement for Nick Jr. Productions at the end of Nick Jr. shows following the retirement of Nick Jr. Productions.\n\nThe standard variant was produced in 2007 and premiered in January 2008. The extended variant was produced in early 2008 and premiered during that year's Kids' Choice Awards on March 29th. The HD variant was produced in 2008, making its debut in November of that year.\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, the copyright info is seen below.\n\nThere is an extended variant used for the 2008 Kids' Choice Awards, Nick Jr. compilation DVDs starting in 2008 and some other shows, in which the lightbulb changes back to the splat at the end.\n\nThe logo is shown without the copyright stamp on some Nick Jr. shows, Back at the Barnyard and the first 5 episodes of The Troop. However, some international reruns and more domestic reruns in the U.S. still had the copyright stamp.\n\nOn shows and movies produced in HD, a version exists where the logo is slightly different. The background glow and the Nickelodeon logo are in red-orange, and the text on the lightbulb has a 3D effect to it. Some of the sparkles are also invisible and don't rise to the top inside the lightbulb, unlike in the SD variant. This variant appears to be a remake and not an edit or recolorization of the SD variant.\n\nSometimes, the logo is stretched (4:3 version stretched to 16:9).\n\nOn the 2008 Kids' Choice Awards, the HD version is squeezed to 4:3.\n\nSped-up variants exist.\n\nOn split-screen credit airings of Wayside, similar to the 17th logo, the orange text reading \"This has been a presentation of\" is seen above.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation by Nick's in-house team.\n\nAudio: The synthesized sound effect of kids laughing from the \"Abstract\" logo (which, once again, is synthesized). Otherwise the ending theme.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn Fanboy & Chum Chum, The Penguins of Madagascar, The Fairly OddParents and Danny Phantom, only the second laugh is heard.\n\nOn some shows, the ending theme and the \"kids laughing\" audio are mixed together.\n\nOn split-screen credit airings of SpongeBob SquarePants, the seagull audio from the United Plankton Pictures logo plays over.\n\nSometimes, the audio from the 10th logo plays over (see the music/sounds sections of the 2006 \"CGI Splat\" logo and the 2000 \"Abstract\" logo).\n\nSometimes, it’s silent.\n\nOn split-screen airings of the Ni-Hao, Kai-Lan episode \"The Ant Playground\", the 2005 Nick Jr. Productions jingle may play over the logo without the copyright stamp.\n\nOn the Bubble Guppies episode \"Can You Dig It?\", the music from the next logo is used. This is the only Bubble Guppies episode to use this logo with the next logo's music; other episodes used this logo with the standard laughing sound effect.\n\nAirings of Jimmy Neutron with this logo would use the \"Gotta blast!\" audio variant.\n\nOn the original print of the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \"SpongeBob's Last Stand\" (also the final SpongeBob SquarePants episode with that logo), the logo used a different, softer laugh soundbite with less voices (presumably either the Diddy laugh from the Rare, the child giggling from the Chuck E. Cheese's funding bumpers or the Sesame Workshop laugh). Most other prints of the episode plaster this variant with either the second half of the standard laugh (while retaining this logo) or the 2009 Nickelodeon Productions logo.\n\nAvailability:\n\nLike the 17th logo, it was primarily used for split-screen credits until the 2009 rebrand. However, it was more widely used outside of the split-screen credits compared to it.\n\nIt also appears on the SpongeBob SquarePants episodes \"SpongeBob's Last Stand\" and \"The Clash of Triton\", which premiered after the 2009 rebrand, on DVD and Nicktoons. It was also seen on SpongeBob SquarePants episodes from season 6 to early season 7 (when it switched to the 2009 logo), The Fairly OddParents since season 6 until 2009, The Mighty B!, Back at the Barnyard, The Penguins of Madagascar, later episodes of El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera, the first season of Team Umizoomi, Dora the Explorer episodes from season 5 (when it switched to the 2009 logo on \"Swiper the Explorer\", \"Dora's Big Birthday Adventure\" and season 6 episodes), DVD prints of Olivia, Blue's Clues, season 3 episodes of Max & Ruby, later prints of Yo Gabba Gabba! (earlier ones used the first logo), and 2009 episodes of Fanboy and Chum Chum. This logo was last seen on a 2013 rerun of The Backyardigans episode \"Follow the Feather\".\n\nThe bylineless version can also be seen on some Nick Jr. shows, and plasters over the Nick Jr. Productions logo along with the first five episodes of The Troop on NickToons.\n\nThis is also seen outside of the United States. Nickelodeon Latin America still used this logo in newer episodes of shows until one point.\n\nIt was also seen at the end of VOD releases of a few SpongeBob SquarePants episodes in 2010. Also, some 2009 DVDs have the extended version of this logo. It also appears on Square Roots: The Story of SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\nThe 2010 TV movie The Boy Who Cried Werewolf used this logo, despite it premiering a year after the 2009 rebrand (it was copyrighted in 2009, implying it was completed more than a full year before its release). It was also spotted on the Bubble Guppies episodes \"Can You Dig It?\" and \"Happy Clam Day!\", which premiered in September 2011.\n\nThe HD variant only appeared on season 1 episodes of True Jackson VP, early episodes of Fanboy and Chum Chum, early episodes of The Penguins of Madagascar, season 1 episodes The Fresh Beat Band and other shows produced in 16:9.\n\n20th Logo (September 23, 2009-)\n\nVisuals: On a white background, a few CGI orange lines bounce and connect together to form the new Nickelodeon logo (which is simply the word \"nickelodeon\" in a new customized typeface, unofficially nicknamed \"Litebulb\"). After this, \"PRODUCTIONS\" (in Gotham) fades in underneath the logo and a copyright notice appears below.\n\nTrivia: The new logo was introduced in July 2009 (three months after Nickelodeon's 30th anniversary) and officially on September 28, 2009. However, Nickelodeon used this logo by accident five days earlier on most airings of their programs.\n\nVariants:\n\nA version without a copyright stamp was spotted on split-screen credits airings of T.U.F.F. Puppy and Victorious.\n\nThere is a variant without the word \"PRODUCTIONS\" and copyright info, used as a defacto home video logo on DVDs of Nickelodeon shows distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment.\n\nA small in-credit version of this logo is seen on 2010-2014 Big Time Rush and Victorious reruns on Nickelodeon.\n\nThere is a shorter version of this logo seen on 2010-17 episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants and early episodes of The Loud House.\n\nOn shows produced by Nickelodeon's Australian unit, the words \"A Nickelodeon Australia Production\" are seen above the copyright stamp.\n\nOn TeenNick reruns of All That, the first three seasons of Nicky, Ricky, Dicky, and Dawn, the first two seasons of School of Rock, and some other shows, the logo is in warp speed.\n\nAn extended version of this logo exists where it's just the white background for a second before the animation starts.\n\nA still version is seen on Nick-produced Netflix movies, specials and series such as Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling, Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus, Pinky Malinky and Glitch Techs. It doesn't appear on The Loud House Movie and Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie, which uses the 2020 Nickelodeon Movies logo instead of this for some reason (animated at the beginning, still at the end in the first movie and appears in-credit).\n\nOn various airings of Nick shows on September 26, 2009, two copyright notices would appear on the logo: one from 2009 (when the logo first appeared), and another depending on when the show's episode came out.\n\nOn some shows, such as The Mighty B!, some episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants, and Robot and Monster, the copyright notice appears later, right when the Nickelodeon logo is almost done forming.\n\nOn Papaya Bull, the text \"Uma coprodução\" is seen to the top left of the logo.\n\nOn Vikki RPM, the Nickelodeon logo is thrown from the left. \"PRODUCTIONS\" then fades in under the Nickelodeon logo. A copyright notice is shown for the entire logo.\n\nTechnique: CGI animation done by Trollbäck+Company in New York. 2D-ish 3D CGI animation for the Vikki RPM variant.\n\nAudio: An electronic beat, accompanied by chopped sections of what seems to be a tribal drumbeat, followed by a guitar-led rendition of the last five notes of the Nickelodeon jingle. Composed by Sacred Noise.[1]\n\nAudio Trivia: It is possible that the chopped drumbeat might have been intended to be a soundalike of the opening drums to the song \"Woke Up in the Morning\" by Care Bears on Fire, which was used on early promotional material for the 2009 rebrand (where the Nickelodeon stars get slimed in slow-motion), which contains similarly chopped drumbeats throughout.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSeveral shortened versions of the music exist.\n\nSometimes, the end theme is used instead.\n\nSometimes, it can be silent.\n\nT.U.F.F. Puppy uses a quiet guitar riff from the show's opening theme.\n\nOn series produced by Schneider's Bakery, bubbling sounds are heard with the normal theme. However, on split-screen credits airings of iCarly, Victorious, Drake & Josh and Zoey 101, the bubbling sounds aren't heard and the music is instead the final part of the extended theme. The split-screen variant was last seen in November 2012, when TeenNick's split-screen credits would play logos in fullscreen with audio.\n\nOn seasons 7-8 of Dora the Explorer, the music is bass-boosted. A few season 8 episodes have this lower-pitched.\n\nOn The Loud House, the final segment of the end theme trails into the beginning of the logo.\n\nOn at least one print of Team Umizoomi, it used the synthesized laughing sound from the 2001 split-screen credits logo. This also happened on airings of various iCarly episodes on September 26, 2009, and again on an airing of the iCarly episode \"iNevel\" on November 1, 2009.\n\nOn some season 7 episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants, the aforementioned sound and the end theme of the show play at the same time.\n\nOn I Am Frankie and Vikki RPM, a techno-rock remix of the Nickelodeon theme is used, which actually originated from some bumpers used from 2009 to 2012, and also composed by Sacred Noise.\n\nOn airings of various SpongeBob SquarePants episodes on September 26, 2009, the logo had the audio of the following United Plankton Pictures logo because of the fact that the split screen credits accidentally used this logo instead of the 2008 \"Lightbulb\" logo.\n\nOn season 2 episodes of Glitch Techs (all except for \"BITT Prime\"), an 8-bit video game version of the Nickelodeon theme is played.\n\nOn split-screen credits airings of The Backyardigans, the show’s closing theme plays for half of the logo's duration, before cutting to the logo’s regular music.\n\nOn the first episode of Deadtime Stories, the music is slowed down.\n\nOn the Rugrats \"Outdoor Shenanigans\" DVD, the logo's music and a quote from the show played at the same time.\n\nOn a November 2012 CBS airing of the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \"It's a SpongeBob Christmas!\", a generic theme was used.\n\nAvailability:\n\nAppears on all Nick shows starting in September 2009, with it also being used to plaster every previous logo on the split-screen (and later compressed) credits.\n\nThe extended version is seen on split-screen credits airings of T.U.F.F. Puppy. It was retired on Nicktoons (the channel) as of May 2014.\n\nThis logo was first spotted on most programs on Nickelodeon's schedule on September 23, 2009 and again on September 26, 2009, but didn't officially premiere on Nick channels and replace the previous logo until September 28th. However, starting with the 2017 Kids' Choice Awards, shows are slowly starting to phase this logo out with various variants of the logos below. However, some programs still continued to use this logo, notably on Netflix and Henry Danger until 2020 and Nella the Princess Knight until 2021.\n\nDespite this logo starting to be phased out as of 2017, it is still used as a defacto home video logo by Nickelodeon Home Video. Lower-third credits on some shows on Nicktoons and TeenNick also used this logo until 2023.\n\nThe Vikki RPM variant was only seen on said show, which didn't premiere anywhere other than Latin America.\n\nLegacy: Another favorite among the community due to its visuals, especially Nickelodeon fans; although it is not well-received for Nickelodeon fans from previous eras.\n\n21st Logo (September 18, 2010-)\n\nVisuals: There is the Nickelodeon logo with the text \"PRESENTS\" under it quickly fading in on a black background. The logo zooms in for a bit and quickly fades out.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling, the logo fades in and out as usual, but this time, it’s superimposed over the beginning scene of the movie and doesn’t zoom in at all.\n\nOn Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus, the logo first appears around 5 minutes into the movie and fades in as usual, superimposed over the movie scene. It starts zooming into the screen until the camera is between the L and the O of the Nickelodeon logo.\n\nMost of the time, \"presents\" would be in a different font.\n\nIn other cases, \"presents\" is removed entirely.\n\nSometimes, the logo would be superimposed over the opening.\n\nOn The Loud House Movie and Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie, the text reads \"A Nickelodeon Production\" instead, most likely due to being a direct co-production with Netflix.\n\nTechnique: Other than simple fading/zooming effects, just a still image.\n\nAudio: None or the opening theme of the movie.\n\nAvailability:\n\nIt was first seen on Fred: The Movie.\n\nIt also appears on the Nickelodeon TV movie Hey Arnold!: The Jungle Movie and the Netflix-exclusive films Rocko’s Modern Life: Static Cling, Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus, and as a variant on The Loud House Movie and Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie.\n\nIt is still in use in Nickelodeon TV movies, like A Loud House Christmas.\n\n22nd Logo (NickMom-exclusive variant) (October 1, 2012-September 28, 2015)\n\nVisuals: The logo starts with various still shots of a woman's high heels (with Dora The Explorer bandages on her achilles) on a purple background. The Nick logo flips in and \"PRODUCTIONS\" wipes in underneath it, as copyright info appears in black boxes with white texts, with the exception of the copyright symbol and year.\n\nVariant: A short version exists.\n\nTechnique: Computer animation by Employee Number One.\n\nAudio: A chiptune-like theme, albeit without the mnemonic. Composed by Explosion Robinson. Otherwise, it's silent.\n\nAvailability: The logo is still preserved on iTunes prints of NickMom shows.\n\n23rd Logo (March 11, 2017-)\n\n24th Logo (February 27, 2023-)\n\nVisuals: There are four main variants, and all of them end with the 2009 Nickelodeon logo behind an orange splat with white text reading \"P R O D U C T I O N S\" (in Neue Plak Condensed Bold) underneath the logo, usually on a purple (or yellow) background:\n\nOn a black background, a series of multicolored claymation-like splats explode outward from the middle of the screen (in order, orange-yellow-orange-purple). The purple splat expands out to reveal a distorted, squishy balloon-type \"nickelodeon\" wordmark in white (with it inverting to purple as it crosses out of the splat). The splat shrinks, and the colors invert, turning the background, splat and the text into the normal logo ending. The \"PRODUCTIONS\" text spaces out underneath the logo. Copyright information appears below.\n\nAn orange splat fills in the screen at the beginning, starting from the outside. The animation from the first version then continues as normal, but it ends on a yellow background.\n\nThere is the Nickelodeon logo (and the background) drenched in the trademark green slime. As the camera zooms out, the slime wipes away to reveal the normal logo ending.\n\nSome of the orange blobs wipe away to reveal the normal logo and the background after the formation of the \"nickelodeon\" wordmark.\n\nTrivia: This is the first Nickelodeon logo to utilize the splat since the 2009 rebrand. It is also worth noting that the wordmark in the 2009 logo is kept.\n\nVariants:\n\nDuring the final scenes of shows, the black background is transparent, and from 2023-2024, the copyright is absent.\n\nSometimes, the word \"PRODUCTIONS\" is absent. This was seen on three short videos featuring SeanDoesMagic, as well as three-second \"You're Watching\" bumpers. Both can be seen on Nickelodeon's website.\n\nOn episodes of Bossy Bear since episode 12, the fourth variant is using a gradient effect.\n\nOn some shows by Nickelodeon Israel, the “PRODUCTIONS” text is replaced with text in Hebrew, reading either “Proud to present” (at the start, seen at the bottom) or “Produced for” (at the end, seen at the top).\n\nStill and short versions exist.\n\nAt the end of programming on Nickelodeon's United Kingdom feed, the slime variant is used, without the \"PRODUCTIONS\" indicator or a copyright stamp.\n\nAt the end of the live-action adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender, the second variant is used, but \"PRODUCTIONS\" is intact, and is cropped to the 2.39:1 aspect ratio. It is also still.\n\nShort and still versions for other variants, exist.\n\nOn the YouTube upload of the Dora episode \"Wizzle Wozzle Woo\", the second variant (alongside the other logos and credits) play in complete speed, as the logo swipes away to the Subscribe ident of the Dora & Friends YouTube channel.\n\nStarting in 2024, the Paramount corporate wordmark is added on top of the copyright information (with the addition of the text reading \"PARAMOUNT IS A TRADEMARK OF PARAMOUNT PICTURES CORPORATION.\" at the bottom) and the logo is zoomed out.\n\nOn The Tiny Chef Show starting with the 3rd episode of season 2, the 2024 copyright information is used in the original version of this logo.\n\nOn The Fairly OddParents: A New Wish, the copyright information is different.\n\nOn episode 6 of season 2 of Transformers: EarthSpark, a different copyright notice is behind the Paramount corporate wordmark.\n\nAt the end of the 2024 Kids' Choice Awards, the Nickelodeon splat logo forms on a black background without any other text.\n\nTechnique: CGI done by Roger in Los Angeles.[4]\n\nAudio: A trap/techno arrangement of the Nickelodeon theme (somewhat reminiscent of 8-bit chiptune music) featuring a heavily manipulated male voice vocalizing the first half of the jingle (almost sounding like a groan tube), with digital-sounding splat noises accompanying the logo turning normal. This and the other variants were composed by Radium Audio and Mekanical[5], and used as network bumper music.[5]\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSometimes, it would have a different and more energetic trap remix, with a chorus-like rendition of the first eight notes of the jingle. The splat noises remain the same. This track was also used as network bumper music.\n\nThere is an extended version of the alternate music, where the last five notes of the jingle is heard at the end.\n\nOn the UK version, there is the slime running down, followed by an energetic rendition of the Nickelodeon mnemonic after the transition to the normal logo.\n\nLike the previous logo, the music from the 2009 logo is sometimes used.\n\nSometimes, the end theme is used instead.\n\nSometimes, it can be silent.\n\nOn the first three season 2 episodes of The Really Loud House, it uses the music from the last logo's \"Playground\" variant.\n\nOn episode 6 of season 2 of Transformers: EarthSpark and the first three episodes of Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it uses the music from the last logo's \"Orange to Orange\" and \"Zipper\" variants.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThe first variant of this logo (albeit compressed to the corner of the screen during the on-screen credits) debuted on a February 27, 2023 rerun of the SpongeBob SquarePants episode \"Frozen Face-Off\", and has appeared on more airings of episodes of its show.\n\nThe second variant (and also the full-screen version of the main variant) was originally leaked onto the internet on March 3, 2023, but makes a debut on the Dora the Explorer reboot, titled Dora.\n\nThe third variant debuted after the 2023 Kids' Choice Awards.\n\nIt started appearing on shows starting with episode 12 of Bossy Bear and it was later seen on season 4 of Tyler Perry's Young Dylan, season 2 of The Tiny Chef Show, The Fairly OddParents: A New Wish and Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nThe Paramount byline variant debuted on a January 10, 2024 rerun of The Patrick Star Show episode \"Backpay Payback/House Hunting\" on Nick, and has appeared on more split-screen credits at that time. It then makes its full debut on the 1st episode of season 4 of the 2020 revival of Nick News and was later seen on season 2 of both The Really Loud House and Rubble & Crew, episode 24 of season 7 of Blaze and the Monster Machines, and later episodes of season 3 of Baby Shark's Big Show!.\n\nIt also appears on TV movies by Nickelodeon Movies and Paramount+ as of Zoey 102 (excluding Baby Shark's Big Movie!, as that uses a short version of the Nickelodeon Movies logo at the end of the film).\n\nUnused Logo\n\nLogo (March 13, 2017)\n\nVisuals: Over a purple background is the Nickelodeon logo with balls (which represent the heads of characters from various Nickelodeon shows) on it, bending in a downward curve. Then, the logo bends up, sending the balls flying up and offscreen. The word \"PRODUCTIONS\" and a copyright byline in white then fade in below.\n\nTrivia: Characters featured in the logo include:\n\nThe title character of SpongeBob SquarePants\n\nAang (Avatar: The Last Airbender)\n\nKorra (The Legend of Korra)\n\nThe title character of Harvey Beaks\n\nFoo (Harvey Beaks)\n\nLincoln Loud (The Loud House)\n\nLana Loud (The Loud House)\n\nLucy Loud (The Loud House)\n\nLuan Loud (The Loud House)\n\nLeni Loud (The Loud House)\n\nLily Loud (The Loud House)\n\nThe title character of Pinky Malinky\n\nValerie Malinky (Pinky Malinky)\n\nSanjay Patel (Sanjay and Craig)\n\nLadybug (Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir)\n\nKenzie Bell (Game Shakers)\n\nTriple G (Game Shakers)\n\nHudson Gimble (Game Shakers)\n\nNicky Harper (Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn)\n\nRicky Harper (Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn)\n\nDawn Harper (Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn)\n\nRay Manchester (Henry Danger)\n\nCaptain Man (Henry Danger)\n\nCharlotte Page (Henry Danger)\n\nDewey Finn (School of Rock)\n\nFreddy Huerta (School of Rock)\n\nZack Kwan (School of Rock)\n\nLawrence Dooley (School of Rock)\n\nMax Thunderman (The Thundermans)\n\nLeonardo (the 2012 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series)\n\nCosmo (The Fairly OddParents)\n\nWanda (The Fairly OddParents)\n\nSimon Seville (Alvinnn!!! and the Chipmunks)\n\nTechnique: 2D computer animation, done by Superestudio.\n\nAudio: None.\n\nAvailability: It was only seen on the Behance page. It also appears on a branding montage video by Superestudio. It's possible that the logo was unused because it used characters from outdated shows (as well as having one acquired non-Nick show; Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir, which Nickelodeon lost the broadcast rights to at the end of 2017)."
