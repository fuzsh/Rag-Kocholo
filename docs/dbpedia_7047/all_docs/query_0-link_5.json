        "text": "Would you like to see them back? Sign here!\n\nThe show first aired as a \"sneak peek\" on November 28, 2008 and ended on April 10, 2013. However, the show aired reruns on Nicktoons until February 3, 2017. The show was also made available on Paramount+ in certain countries.\n\nTaken from Wikipedia[]\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar is a spin-off of the \"Madagascar\" films, even though it occasionally makes a few references to them. The series follows the adventures of four penguins: Skipper, Kowalski, Private, and Rico, who perform various paramilitary missions to protect their home in the Central Park Zoo. The Penguins often have to deal with problems caused or made worse by the lemurs King Julien XIII, Maurice, and Mort.\n\nThe series was released 21 days after the second movie. DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg has stated that \"there is at least one more chapter. We ultimately want to see the characters make it back to New York.\"\n\nTaken from The Penguins of Madagascar HQ![]\n\n\"The Penguins of Madagascar\" is an animated show currently airing on the Nickelodeon network. The series is based on the military-esque adventures of 4 penguins living in the Central Park Zoo in New York. The Penguins had their first appearance in the movies \"Madagascar\" in 2005 where they were part of a subplot to try to make it back to their homeland of Antarctica by hijacking a ship. They find Antarctica too cold and eventually end up on the warm island of Madagascar. \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\" was the 2008 sequel to \"Madagascar\" and once again featured the penguins antics as they tried to reconstruct an old airplane in order to leave Africa.\n\nThe penguins had their first separate adventure in an animated short called \"The Madagascar Penguins in a Christmas Caper\" which aired in theaters on October 7, 2005 with the stop-motion film, \"Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit\". This short was included on later editions of of the \"Madagascar\" and \"Shrek\" DVDs which were both released on November 15, 2005. This was also the unofficial pilot episode of the TV show.\n\nIt was decided in 2006 that there should be a Nicktoon based on the \"Madagascar\" movie. No details about anything having to do with the show or its characters were confirmed until November 2007, when Nickelodeon advertised a sneak peak of three new shows that were coming to Nickelodeon for the 2008 year.\n\nDue to a delay of the release of the movie \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\" to November 7, 2008, the Nickelodeon show was also delayed. Season one was confirmed for 26 episodes and in January 2009, even before the shows actual television premier, a second season was confirmed for another 26 episodes, bringing the total to 52.On February 6, 2009, the double DVD Pack of \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\" was released and came with a preview DVD of the show, featuring the episodes “Popcorn Panic” and “Gone in a Flash\". The \"Popcorn Panic\" episode was shown in many other countries around the world before airing on Nickelodeon on May 9, 2009.\n\nOn November 28, 2008, the first two episodes, \"Popcorn Panic\" and \"Gone in a Flash\" aired as part of a \"Super Stuffed Nicktoons Weekend\" along with two other contenders for new shows, \"The Mighty B!\" and \"Making Fiends\". They aired right before 7 brand new episodes of the sixth season of \"SpongeBob Squarepants\".\n\nThe actual series premier happened on March 28, 2009 with the episodes \"Launchtime\" and \"Haunted Habitat\". The premier occurred right after the Nickelodeon 2009 Kids' Choice Awards and drew 6.1 million viewers making it Nickelodeon's most watched series premier of all time.\n\nEach half hour show consists of two 11 minute episodes and are not permanently paired, meaning the two episodes shown together in the half-hour time slot might not be the same pair as a future airing of the show. The show is co-produced by DreamWorks Animation and Nickelodeon Animation Studios (both in California), and the animation is done by DK Ent. and Paprikaas studios in India. For voice casting, the series used many original voice actors from the \"Madagascar\" movies. However, a few of the original movie voice talents were not able to do work for the show due to other involvements so other actors had to be found. The final cast ended up being perfect and unless noted, one cannot tell the difference between the film and show voices!\n\nThere are other small differences between the movies and the show such as the zoo grounds/habitats and certain features of some the animals. The 4 Penguins were given different silhouettes than their movie counterparts in order to better tell them apart. Many new animals now live at the zoo as well, most likely in order to form new stories for episodes around.\n\nThe actual show revolves around the adventures of the 4 penguins, Skipper, Kowalski, Private and Rico as they try to get by on a daily basis and protect their habitat at the Central Park Zoo. Everything they do is treated as a strategic military style commando/spy mission and each team member plays a certain role in the group. They are often harassed by a trio of lemurs from Madagascar, King Julien, Maurice and Mort. The events of the series are supposedly set after \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\" but it is unknown as to how the penguins and lemurs arrived at the zoo without the other characters from the Madagascar movies. The show started production before an ending to \"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\" had been established. Rumor has it that Tom McGrath (creator of the show and voice of Skipper) said \"It's not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe.\" Despite the fact that he says the show isn’t specifically right after the first Madagascar movie, but took place sometime after the movie, Many People misread his statement, and believed it was set in a own alternate universe By using his end quote \"I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe\". (even though Tom McGrath stated he thinks of them as like they’re in a different universe, not it’s in a different universe.), this will later be confirmed to be in the same universe as the films, with episodes such as \"The All Nighter Before Christmas\", and \"The Return of the Revenge of Dr Blowhole\". When A third installment of the movie series was confirmed fans of the show thought the third movie would hopefully complete the missing storyline segments! This would later be false, as the Penguins, Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, And Private. The Chimps, Mason and Phil. And the lemurs, King Julien, Maurice, And Mort. Joined a circus At the end of Madagascar 3. Though it is most likely that the show takes place after \"Penguins of Madagascar the movie\" as it makes sense as the penguins have left the circus and most likely the lemurs and chimps came back with them, so this is most likely when the show takes place.\n\nMany elements of the show also got adapted into the lore of \"Madagascar\" with Mort being obsessed with King Julien's feet first being introduced in the show as well as the penguins redesigns being adapted for their spinoff movie. Even though the show might not be considered by fans to be fully canon many elements of it have been made canon so one can assume that the show is considered full canon by DreamWorks.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar doesn't comes before or after the events of Madagascar. Tom McGrath (creator of the show and voice of Skipper) said \"It's not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe.\" Despite the fact that he says the show isn’t specifically right after the first Madagascar movie, but took place sometime after the movie.\n\nAfter the Installment of Madagascar 3: Europe Most wanted, fans of the show thought the third movie would hopefully complete the missing storyline segments! This would later be false, as the Penguins, Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, And Private. The Chimps, Mason and Phil. And the lemurs, King Julien, Maurice, And Mort. Joined a circus At the end of Madagascar 3. Though it is most likely that the show takes place after \"Penguins of Madagascar the movie\" as it makes sense as the penguins have left the circus and most likely the lemurs and chimps came back with them, so this is most likely when the show takes place.\n\nThe Show takes place in the Central Park Zoo where the Penguins, The Lemurs and Chimps returned. The Penguins chose to live in to zoo to have a safe place to start a secret organization to stop their enemies and have different adventures but King Julien, Maurice, and Mort Comes with them under Julien's Command since he also wants to be King of New York. They stopped crimes, and made enemies on the way, including a evil one-eyed dolphin named, Dr. Blowhole, a Danish Puffin named Hans. and more.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nMain Characters[]\n\nSkipper: Commander of the penguins secret elite unit. Most of the Missions in the Episode are led by him. Skipper has the heart of an action hero and the swagger to match. He's a natural leader with a single-minded focus on results. Skipper approaches every situation with intensity, which may explain his overly active imagination. To Skipper, every innocent coincidence appears to be a nefarious conspiracy. It's a good thing that he's 100% confident that only his team is capable of finding the truth.\n\nKowalski: Head of Weapons R&D, and the Team Medic. When Skipper needs analysis or an immediate invention, Kowalski is there with his crayon, notebook and slightly skewed scientific method. His inventions that 'help' them with different missions and problems, fails most of the time due to his forgetting to fix something or him overthinking the science. Kowalski's authoritative attitude covers up the fact that he usually doesn't have a clue or is unaware of what's happening.\n\nRico: Quartermaster and Head of Demolitions. Rico is the ultimate loose cannon and has (literally) internalized his role as a demolitions expert. He has an entire munitions department in his gut and the remarkable ability to \"retrieve\" on-demand the appropriate bomb or any number of useful items. He loves violence and can regurgitate anything on command. He can also manage what he can regurgitate. He is obsessed with explosives and always bring up bombs and other types of explosives.\n\nPrivate: Private is a bit fuzzy on who he is and his role in the penguins organization. Since he's not so sure of himself, Private is completely open to every experience and situations. He either can be a distraction, Skipper's right hand man, the sacrifice, or a replacement. He also has an obsession with the show \"Lunacorns\", along with going to their events, buying their merchandise, and even citing advice and words of wisdom the characters on the show say, much to the annoyance of his fellow penguins and animals. Unlike the other penguins, he doesn't get angry at the lemurs like the other penguins, even offering to help them in several episodes and is even proud of doing something good for them (even though the other penguins aren't).\n\nSecondary Characters[]\n\nCharacters that appear in a lot of episodes but not all.\n\nJulien: A Ring-tailed lemur who appears regularly, often noisily and unintentionally annoying Skipper and pretty much everyone. He is the self-proclaimed \"King of the Zoo\" no doubt due to his former king status on Madagascar. Only Mort and Maurice truly believe and respect him as their king, everyone else just humors him, showing up to his royal decrees. Because he is extremely conceited, selfish and rather dim-witted, Julien is a terrible king. It seems that he will only let people talk good about him. Julien could even be narcissistic in that way. But it has been referenced twice in the series that deep down, he mainly wants his friends to stay by his side.\n\nMaurice: Maurice is Julien's right hand man and Royal Advisor. Maurice is more intelligent than King Julien, Mort and most of the other lemurs combined. He does not share the other two lemurs' bad cases of the \"stupids\" (natural stupidity). He is more grounded than any of the other lemurs or penguins. He is extremely loyal to King Julien and is like an older brother to Mort. He usually thinks King Julien is bizarre, but he also loves dancing and parties, assisting the King with his insane and selfish plans, and is entirely loyal to him.\n\nMort: Mort is One of Julien's Followers and he respects him. Mort is so cute and popular that he was even put on the cover of the zoo brochure. His plush toys are a popular sale in the zoo, and he even has a t-shirt design. Visitors to the zoo comment on how adorable he is just as much as they do on Private. Although Mort is both disliked and pushed around by King Julien, he does not seem to be bothered by it. A big reason why Mort likes King Julien is because of King Julien's feet. Because of this, he always volunteers to help King Julien. Although King Julien dislikes him, he actually enjoys Mort worshiping him, as he has confessed many times.\n\nMarlene: Marlene is a super smart, beautiful, funny, level-headed female otter. She believes that Skipper's far too paranoid. Sometimes, she's proven right and other times, she's proven wrong. On the other hand, sometimes, Marlene is the one who prompts the penguins to take action. Despite Marlene usually being sensible, she dreams of having somebody play Spanish guitar music to her. Marlene always becomes wild and feral as soon as she's outside the zoo walls (but she seems fine inside the sewers). However, on occasion, this has been forgotten.\n\nRecurring and Supporting Characters[]\n\nCharacters that appear regularly.\n\nBurt: Burt is generally peaceful, honest, and cultured Elephant. He enjoys Victorian literature and is an accomplished abstract artist. He is something of a gentle giant and a romanticist, generally remembering his youth with fondness.\n\nBada and Bing: Bada and Bing are strong gorillas, share a habitat together (Might also be brothers). They doesn't like sharing anything, especially air space and bananas.\n\nMason: Mason is a chimpanzee that resides in the Central Park Zoo with his fellow chimpanzee Phil. Mason is a very intelligent chimp and enjoys the finer things in life such as poetry, fine cuisine, and artwork, along with throwing poop at people.\n\nPhil: Phil is a mute chimpanzee who has dark brown fur. Although he is mute, he is an avid (having or showing a keen interest in or enthusiasm for something) reader where he can communicate with American Sign Language and can read properly with Mason being able to translate his sign language. He knows how to read the English language and often interprets things for Mason.\n\nJoey: Joey is an aggressive, irritable and territorial male red kangaroo with an Australian accent who hates other animals in his enclosure, especially Julien and the penguins. If someone comes into his habitat he will attack the animal to make them go away.\n\nLeonard: Leonard is incredibly paranoid Koala, seemingly afraid of everything, especially the penguins (since he knows the penguins has done destructive things before). He tends to be anti-social and nervous as well, which is probably because of the fact that he has a fear of everything (Panophobia or Pantophobia).\n\nMax: Max (called \"Moon-Cat\" by the penguins) is a stray tabby cat that lives on the top of a building in New York. He wanted to eat the penguins when they landed on 'the Moon' and invited them to his house to kill them but fails. He later becomes friends with them.\n\nFred: Fred, a clueless, dumb, and squirrel who lives in central park and meets (sometimes helps) the penguins on their mission outside the zoo. Even with his stupidity, he has a lot of knowledge of his species history and is able to help the penguins and some of the zoosters in a treasure hunt in The Lost Treasure of the Golden Squirrel.\n\nRoger: A kind, and humble alligator who lived in the sewer, Now in the Central park zoo is the penguins friend that they met in the sewer. Although he appears to be a alligator, a dangerous predator, he appears to be kind and friendly, even against violence.\n\nEggy: A baby duck who was taken cared by the penguins and Julien when it was still in his egg until he hatched and returned to his mom. Because Eggy was born under the Penguin's and Julien's watch, he has inherited individual traits of their personalities: Skipper's gusto, Rico's love for destruction, Kowalski's knowledge, Private's adorability and Julien's Dancing Skills & Personality.\n\nLemmy (LEM-R): A robot who was send to the Central Park zoo to learn how to be a lemur before the company of the robot sends it to space. Julien becomes friends with him to teach him how to dance like him but after the penguins find out they going to send him to space, they take him and teach him how to fight but it's no use because when Lemmy was send to space, he started dancing and was showed to be killed by the Space Squid.\n\nLulu: Lulu is a female chimpanzee first that appeared in Monkey Love, who stayed with Mason and Phil while her habitat was being repaired at the Hoboken Zoo.\n\nRoy: Roy is a white rhinoceros. Roy gets easily agitated with others (namely Julien) when they bother him. And as is typical for a rhino he charges when agitated. He also isn't a big fan of loud noises, like the lemurs boom box or Marlene's Spanish Guitar.\n\nPinky: Pinky is a flamingo and first appeared in Go Fish to help the penguins to get fish. She later appears in other episodes but doesn't really play a major role in the episodes.\n\nMother Duck: A female duck who is the mother of Eggy and lives on a pond in Central Park.\n\nJiggles: Jiggle is one of Kowalski's living invention. Although one seriously consumed fruit, he eventually begins to rampage through the zoo, destroying objects in his path to claim his food, even 'eating' Kowalski and Julien. Although the other Penguins believe the Jiggles is dead, Kowalski has actually shrunk him down to a smaller size and hidden the Jiggles in his lab.\n\nChuck Charles: Chuck Charles is a news-reporter for Channel 1. He is the reporter most commonly shown, and seems obsessed with his hair. He also provides the breaking news to the penguins for them to solve it.\n\nBonnie Chang: Chuck Charles's assistant and Co-anchor on Channel One news. She's also the one to go down and see the chaos of the news.\n\nBuck Rockgut: A Secret penguin agent and According to Skipper, he is their \"Greatest American Penguin Hero\". Because he was the bird who brought down Penguin Enemy #1: The Red Squirrel, who then escaped. He has grown extremely obsessed and paranoid from waiting the red squirrel to appear again that he will accuse anyone of being the red squirrel.\n\nRandy: Randy is a sheep who lives in the petting zoo. He appears to have a case of OCD as seen when he cares very much about the cleanliness and appearance of his fleece, which lead him to bite a child after the latter ripped a piece off of it.\n\nGus: A Worker who comes to the zoo to fix things once a while, Gus is extremely determined to finish any job, even if there is fire, snakes, earthquakes, or freezing cold. He isn't lazy and doesn't like taking the easy way out. He is extremely strong, able to break the floor of the penguins' habitat with a single punch.\n\nPervis McSlade: A Commissioner of different zoos, including the Central Park Zoo and The Hoboken zoo. He first appeared in the episode, In The Line of Doody.\n\nBlue Hen: A Hen who first appeared in Mental Hen. She seems to be greedy and is always trying to make herself famous so she could one day claim a high position such as the President of the United States or a Senator of Delaware. She's very smart, has quick thinking and can calculate what will happen but always fails because of the penguins (mostly Kowalski and Skipper).\n\nGladys: An Elderly woman who sneaks food into the Zoo to give to the animals and every animals, loves her, expect the lemur since every time that she shows up to the lemurs habitat, she always assume them as cats and always give them cat food. She first appeared in Gut Instinct.\n\nVillains & Enemies[]\n\nAlice: A zookeeper of the Central Park zoo. She seems to dislike her job and dislikes the penguins due to she believing that the penguins having a secret, and she believes that they are scheming (though she is actually correct in this assumption).\n\nRat King: A Buff rat who is the King of the rats in the sewer under the Central Park zoo. Despite his restricted vocabulary the King Rat is certainly intelligent (or at least, street smart). However he is incredibly overconfident and that is his biggest weakness. He is greedy and not above playing as dirty as it takes to get what he wants.\n\nDr. Blowhole: A Evil One-sided Cyborg eye (Covering a Scar on his right eye that he got Mysteriously) Dolphin that is the penguins arch enemies. Dr. Blowhole is an evil, intelligent, devious, and vengeful villain. Dr. Blowhole is as smart as Kowalski, or at least close to his intelligence. When his memory is erased, since he forgot about his humiliation and all his evil actions, he briefly returned to his old personality which reveals to be kind, playful and friendly.\n\nRhonda: A Female walrus that was shipped to be a zoo's attraction and shared a room with Marlene. She shows to be dumb and very unhygienic due to she being messy in Marlene's habitat and using her stuff. After The Penguins sent Rhonda away (Due to Marlene hating her habits and attuite), It turns out Rhonda was actually a spy sent by Dr. Blowhole to steal Kowalski's invention - and it looks like she's succeeded.\n\nOfficer X (or Just X): X was an animal control officer who worked for the Metropolitan Sub Bureau of Animal Control and Pretzel Cart Regulation. He doesn't like penguins because he considers them to be \"nature's rule breakers,\" because although they're technically birds, they swim instead of fly and he had been defeated by them a few times and causing him to lose his jobs.\n\nArchie: Archie is a raccoon who steals stuff from the zoo. He is a sort of \"Robin Hood\" character. He speaks with a fake French accent and is friends with Fred. He says that he takes stuff so he can give it to the less fortunate, when he really just takes it for himself.
