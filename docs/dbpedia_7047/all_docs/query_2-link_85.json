Skipper is the leader of the bunch and he calls the shots. Rico is Skipper's right-hand man and he makes sure that the others stay in line. Kowalski is really the brains of the outfit as he can figure out how to rig anything to fly, float or drive. The last of the group is a kid that Skipper calls Private. The Private is still trying to earn the respect of the Skipper and there is nothing he won't do to make Skipper happy. Together, this group of penguins manages to get in more trouble than any of the other animals in the zoo and that is just the way that Skipper wants it."
