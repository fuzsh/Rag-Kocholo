        "text": "We’re nearing the end, ladies and gentlemen. With only seven more reviews left proceeding this one, I will officially be done reviewing Nicktoons. I think that it is bittersweet, but I’m anticipating moving onto the Cartoon Cartoons. And for anyone who was wondering, I will have quite a few top 10 lists out the week that I finish.\n\nSo let’s start off the first Nicktoon produced by DreamWorks Animation, The Penguins of Madagascar. I was really never too big on the movie Madagascar and haven’t even seen the sequels, but I didn’t really think the movie was bad at all. In fact, I did enjoy it, though I thought that there were plenty of other better DreamWorks movies. However, the one thing I really did love in the first film were the penguins. So when I heard about that the series was revolving around these characters, I was generally excited. And for what we got, I would say that I do enjoy a lot about Penguins.\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar takes place after the movie trilogy back at the Central Park Zoo. At least I think it’s after the movie series, or is it some alternate non-canon dimension? I dunno. Anyways, the show stars most of the original cast; The Penguins, as in Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private who spend most of their day being paranoid and troubled by the rarely existent crimes around them; King Julien, the egotistical lemur from the films; King Julien’s two servants, Maurice and Mort; and newcomer Marlene. As for characters, I can’t think of any I dislike. I don’t really love any of them, but I think they all have their sense of likability. I’ll admit Marlene was kind of just an excuse to include a female character, but I don’t find anything wrong with her. I know a lot of people who think of Mort as their favorite, and while I do like him (though I was a little freaked out by his foot-fetish), I’d have to say my favorite characters are the Penguins. They were the characters I liked so much in the movie, and I just thoroughly enjoyed them here. Whoever thought combining spies and penguins would have such an excellent pay off? I suppose if I had to pick a favorite one of the penguins, it would be Private. I know I’m sort of predictable with liking the pleasant characters, but Private’s still funny and likable.\n\nAlthough the humor wasn’t necessarily hilarious, there was plenty of wit to it. I’m actually surprised this show’s aimed at younger kids. Not that Penguins is chock full of adult jokes, but it has a certain smart edge to the writing that makes for clever jokes which may even get you thinking. The action sequences are well done too. The fast pacing of the series works in the violence and combat to a degree where it doesn’t take up too much of the episode but still has a satisfying feeling.\n\nAs for CGI Nicktoons, Penguins probably had the best animation. Okay, there’s one more upcoming show that was better, but this is a close second. Again, the fast pacing worked well with the feel it was going for, and the animation helped carry it out.\n\nIn my opinion, The Penguins of Madagascar is one of the last memorable Nicktoons. I wouldn’t call it one of the best, but I do think I’d acknowledge it as a good one in later years. Now join me tomorrow, as I’m punished with Satan’s creation itself, Fanboy and Chum Chum."
