Some see the newly approved plan for the Strathcona County city of Bremner as a chance to build a green, high-tech community that incorporates the best of country living and modern urban design.

Others see it as a bad example of old-school urban sprawl that will eat up some of the best farmland in the Edmonton region.

Strathcona County council, which governs the Sherwood Park area, voted 6-2 in favour of building Bremner last spring. It is now in its early planning stages. The new city is to be built northeast of Sherwood Park on the rich farmland across the Yellowhead Highway. It is to become home to 54,000 people over the next 50 years.

Strathcona Mayor Roxanne Carr promises the county government will take its time with Bremner and get it right, perhaps holding an international design competition to develop an innovative and dense community, one that meets the new Capital Region Board target of 40 residential units per hectare.

“We want to take advantage of the rural aspect about it and make this somewhere special, somewhere that is unique in itself,” Carr says.

For those with concerns about a new sprawling suburb built on rich farmland, Carr says: “I would say the right decision was made and they should watch us as we grow and develop.”

The Bremner debate raged for a decade, mainly because Strathcona council had another choice, to develop intensively south of Sherwood Park on far poorer land in the Colchester area. That was Carr’s preference.

But Coun. Vic Bidzinski, who voted for Bremner, argues damage would be done to the Colchester ecosystem if development happened there, too. He also says he has faith that humans are innovative enough to figure out ways to feed themselves in the future. Urban agricultural techniques can be part of the Bremner development.

In a recent speech, he said: “While I understand the concern that there is a limited supply of No. 1 and 2 soil and the subsequent supply of food for future generations, my research on the possibilities that mankind now possess in his endeavours to ensure we as a population can possess an adequate supply was heartwarming.”

Bidzinski’s approach seems to be to hope for the best. But why not plan for the best?

Why build on great farm land when you could just as easily have built on poor farmland?

Longtime Sherwood Park resident Darrell Clarkson, acting chairperson of Responsible Growth Strathcona, a group that is now pushing the province to intervene against Bremner, is against it partly due to the huge cost of building highway interchanges and other expensive infrastructure and partly due to the issue of farm land. Why not just expand the existing county towns and Sherwood Park itself, he wonders? The county could add 40,000 people that way over the next four decades.

“It is the most bizarre thing that you’ve ever seen,” Clarkson says. “It’s going to going to wipe out 10,000 acres of prime agricultural land.”

Adds land use specialist Jerry Bouma, who wrote detailed reports on land use for both the Capital Region Board and Strathcona County: “Bremner has the No. 1 soils. It’s the best land you’re going to find here in Alberta.”

Bouma adds it’s much easier to develop top agricultural land into suburbs ,as it tends to be flat, already serviced with roads and have good drainage. It’s harder to develop more undulating land with pockets of low lands and water, as Colchester has.

In voting for Bremner over Colchester, it appears to me that councillors went against guidelines set out in their own master plan for Strathcona County land use.

“We established a principle that development should take place only as a last resort,” says Bouma, who consulted on the plan. “In other words, if you considered all the factors and finally all things considered there was no other choice, then you could justify the development.”

But with Colchester suitable for development, Bremner was hardly a last resort. A feasibility study was done on Colchester, Bouma says. “Certainly, it doesn’t conclude that development can’t take place there. Far from it.”

While Strathcona County is going one way, the City of Edmonton recently agreed to back off annexing a huge parcel of Leduc County land to preserve top farmland.

Bouma calls that a courageous decision.

Indeed, it’s one of the first times we’ve backed away from our reflexive turning of top farmland into suburbs. It wasn’t the easy thing, but it was the right thing. It’s certainly better than simply hoping for the best.
