        "text": "It was an honour to attend this event and reconnect with some colleagues that were integral on some very important brownfield remediation projects in Brantford. The Greenwich-Mohawk remediation project was one that was highlighted at this event and one that I was so fortunate to spend almost two years of my career working on with all the amazing stakeholders involved. Brantford is a city rich with industrial heritage and more importantly, a city that prioritizes an ongoing commitment to remediating sites with remaining environmental issues inherent in such a progressive industrial history. Beyond this overarching commitment, Jacobs and the City of Brantford collaborated on a remedial approach on the Greenwich-Mohawk site that diverted solid and liquid waste (to the greatest extent possible) by the on-site treatment and re-use of contaminated soils and groundwater. Fun facts about the Greenwich-Mohawk Remediation include: 1. 40,000 tonnes of concrete (slabs, foundation walls, and footings) excavated, crushed and reused on-site 2. 120,000 m3 of clean overburden soil excavated, stockpiled and backfilled upon completion of soil remediation 3. 86,000 tonnes of soil impacted with PHCs and metals excavated and disposed off-site at a MECP-licensed landfill 4. 105,000 m3 of soil impacted with PHCs screened to segregate coarse and fine materials 5. 39,000 m3 of fine-grained soils impacted with PHCs treated on-site in biopiles and reused on-site (backfilled) 6. 66,000 m3 of coarse-grained material impacted with PHCs treated on-site and reused on-site (backfilled) 7. 140,000 L of free-phase petroleum hydrocarbons (LNAPL) recovered from the groundwater and recycled off-site 8. 30,000,000 L of groundwater impacted with PHCs pumped and treated on-site 9. 30,000 tonnes of clear stone and granular fill imported to the site for backfilling What else can I say? Amazing project, amazing commitment, and amazing results! #cityofbrantford #canadianbrownfieldsnetwork #jacobs #remediation\n\nRecently, I had the honor of participating as a speaker at the Municipal Seminar on Planning and Territorial Ordering in Villa Altagracia, Dominican Republic. This important community event was organized by the Foundation for the Development of Villa Altagracia (FUDEVA), as part of the \"Legacy Cities Community of Practice\" project of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy - Latin America and the Caribbean. Highlights from my presentation: Strategic Planning for Sustainable Development: The discussion underscored the critical importance of comprehensive strategic planning for sustainable development and collective well-being. We emphasized the need for effective coordination and smooth collaboration among various sectors and actors. Innovation and Creativity in Urban Solutions: The session addressed the urgency of fostering innovation and creativity to tackle current urban and territorial challenges. We focused on innovative and practical solutions. Empowerment and Community Equity: We highlighted the importance of community empowerment within the planning process. We aligned with the principles of equity and the strengthening of social networks to achieve more inclusive results. Collaboration and Feedback: We underscored the importance of constant feedback and collaboration among community managers. This is crucial for exchanging experiences, developing synergies, and creating effective spaces for communication and continuous learning. I extend my deepest thanks to all the organizers and participants for their dedication and valuable contributions. I am excited about the prospect of continuing to collaborate on these fundamental efforts. #StrategicPlanning #TerritorialOrdering #SustainableDevelopment #CommunityEmpowerment #Innovation\n\n📢 Attention thought leaders, innovators, and industry experts!

We just released our latest report on 𝘾𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙫𝙚 𝘽𝙪𝙨𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙨𝙨 𝙊𝙥𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙨 in downtown Morgantown, West Virginia. At the request of the City of Morgantown, the Morgantown Area Partnership, and Main Street Morgantown. We compared our downtown with Blacksburg, Charlottesville, Virginia, and Asheville, North Carolina. The findings are useful for attracting and incentivizing the types of businesses lacking downtown or meeting demand that outpaces capacity. Most of all, we hope the report helps spur community conversation and involvement in what downtown should be moving forward. See the report for specifics, limitations, and cautions. The report especially finds the tension between catering to residents and attracting visitors in most rural areas - a common thread in the economic, social, and political transition underway in West Virginia and throughout Appalachia. The report also delineates when common rhetoric around aspirational peers is less useful for local strategizing. Thanks to WVU Rockefeller Institute for Policy Research's Oreoluwa (Ore) Runsewe for leading this project and to West Virginia University Eberly College of Arts & Sciences for its never-ending support of our local communities. #publicpolicy #economicdevelopment #businessincentives #localgovt #Morgantown #WestVirginia #Appalachia #economictransition #tourism https://lnkd.in/d-Tn77kc\n\nYesterday I wrote a post about focusing on developing community assets and enterprises within Grimsby. But what does this mean? It refers to a strategic approach aimed at building and enhancing resources and businesses that are of value to the local community. This can include a range of projects and initiatives: 1. Community Assets: These are properties or spaces that are owned or managed by community organisations for public benefit. Examples include community centres, parks, libraries, and sports facilities. Developing these assets means improving, expanding, or creating new spaces that serve the community's needs and interests. 2. Community Enterprises: These are businesses that are set up, owned, and run by the local community. They often reinvest profits back into the community. Examples can include local co-operatives, social enterprises, and community-run shops or cafes. Developing these enterprises means supporting the growth of businesses that not only serve the local economy but also contribute to the social and communal well-being of Grimsby. The focus on these areas implies that initiatives and investments in Grimsby should prioritise projects that bring tangible benefits to the community, boost the local economy, and enhance the quality of life for its residents. This is happening a lot in Grimsby but not everyone is aware of these brilliant community organisations. I am joining one of these organisations next Tuesday at an event they have organised \"Our Future Open House 2023\" in collaboration with East Marsh United I attended last year and came away inspired and humbled. I believe there are still tickets available.
