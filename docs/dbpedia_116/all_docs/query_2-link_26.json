        "text": "Strathcona County is embarking on a journey to create an Open Space Master Plan.\n\nThe County’s unique composition of urban and rural communities value ecological integrity and preservation of agricultural heritage. The Open Space Master Plan (OSMP) is an important component of Strathcona’s development to ensure we continue to provide a welcoming place to live and the right mix of open spaces, features, amenities to support our communities into the future.\n\nThe Master Plan will provide Open Space criteria for new developments and guide the planning of open spaces, parks and outdoor amenities over the next 15 years.\n\nThroughout the process, Strathcona County will seek input and feedback from our residents to ensure the community's needs and preferences are captured.\n\nShare Your Voice!\n\nWe are looking for your input to shape the direction of the Open Space Master Plan.\n\nComplete the short survey to support the development of a vision, goals, and objectives for the OSMP. We look forward to sharing the draft vision with you and providing additional opportunities to get involved with the project in the Fall 2024.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is an Open Space Master Plan (OSMP)?\n\nAn Open Space Master Plan is a document that guides how the County will provide open space in the future, as well as maintain and enhance existing open spaces. The plan sets out a shared vision for the County and actionable steps to help us get there.\n\nThe OSMP will be developed using public and stakeholder input, growth projections, and the unique local context of parks, trails and open spaces in the County.\n\nWhat will the OSMP achieve?\n\nThe Open Space Master Plan (OSMP) will help to guide the County’s decisions around park planning, development and operations through identifying actions, key projects and planning initiatives. As a strategic document, the OSMP will build upon existing plans and policies, while ensuring public needs and priorities are included. The Plan will provide direction on how the amenities and functions of open space will be prioritized across the County.\n\nHow will residents be able to inform the outcome of this project?\n\nThere are several opportunities for residents and stakeholders to participate in this project. In Summer 2024, a short survey will launch and collect residents’ input on values, interests and needs for open spaces.\n\nIn Fall 2024, a series of engagement events will take place with the public and interested parties to identify priorities for investment in County open spaces.\n\nOpportunities to participate in the Open Space Master Plan (OSMP) will be posted on County Voice when available.\n\nWhat are “open spaces”?\n\nOpen spaces include all types of green spaces that are owned and maintained by Strathcona County. A defining feature of open spaces is the functions they provide to County residents – recreation, culture, social connection, ecological preservation, and so much more.\n\nStrathcona County’s system of open spaces is vast, ranging from large parks like Broadmoor Lake Park and Ardrossan Regional Park to spaces flourishing with ecological value like trails and natural areas to undervalued spaces like boulevards and utility corridors – and everything in-between!\n\nHow are open spaces categorized? The primary categories of open spaces are:\n\nNatural Parks\n\nRegional Parks\n\nCommunity Parks\n\nNeighbourhood Parks\n\nGreen Infrastructure (such as stormwater ponds, riparian areas, and wildlife corridors)\n\nOther Open Spaces (such as boulevards and right-of-ways)\n\nHow does this project connect to the Recreation and Culture Strategy?\n\nIn 2019, County Council approved the Recreation and Culture Strategy, which focuses on enhancing welcoming spaces and places for all residents to enjoy. While the Recreation and Culture Strategy includes amenities and facilities found within open spaces, the OSMP will ensure that they are located in the right place. The Plan will provide overarching direction on the acquisition, design, and functionality of these spaces to ensure that they can support the amenities and infrastructure that people need."
