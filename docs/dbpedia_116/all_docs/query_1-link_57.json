        "text": "Article content\n\nStrathcona County is officially interested in hosting the 2026 Alberta Summer Games.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOn Tuesday, July 18, Strathcona County Council voted in favour of administration submitting a bid to host the Games and to amend the 2023 operating budget to absorb $1.9 million which is expected it will cost the county.\n\nArticle content\n\nDiane Yanch, the county’s acting director of Recreation, Parks, and Culture, promised it will be a “unique sports tourism event to remember”.\n\n“The benefits of the Games are far reaching at the community level. The Games brings people together, building capacity in our volunteers generating pride in our community, partnering with our businesses, and engaging with our youth,” Yanch said. “The Games not only provide an opportunity for athletes aged 11 to 17 reach their athletic potential, but also creates an opportunity to showcase the hospitality that Strathcona County is known for.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nStrathcona County was already on the Games’ radar after the municipality submitted a letter of interest for the bid to host in June.\n\nThe four-day event will bring in 2,500 athletes, coaches, officials, and chaperones, and will require 1,500 volunteers.\n\nAlberta Summer Games administration is proposing to showcase 12 sports, including athletics, baseball, basketball, beach volleyball, lacrosse, mountain biking, rugby, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis and triathlon. The county will also request the addition of team handball, based on the local growth and popularity of that sport.\n\n“This is something that I am one hundred per cent on,” said Ward 8 Coun. Katie Berghofer said, who tabled the motion.\n\n“In June, I attended Sport Tourism Canada’s annual conference. A large take away was that mid-sized municipalities can benefit from sport tourism by hosting smaller regional and provincial competitions — we do not need to compete with Edmonton on larger bids. The 2026 Alberta Summer Games will provide us an opportunity to showcase our unique municipality to visitors from across the province and add an economic boost for local businesses,” Berghofer later told The News. “In 1989, I competed in the Alberta Summer Games in Brooks. These are memories and experiences that stay with me today, both of the games and the community.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe motion passed 8-1, with Mayor Rod Frank as the lone vote against.\n\nWorst case scenario if the county is unable to attain more government grant funding or any corporate sponsorship, the cost of running the Games could soar to $2.5 million.\n\nEven though the recent hosting of the Special Olympics in February was a success, the mayor worried that costs for hosting the Games could climb and that volunteerism might wane. Okotoks and Black Diamond are set to host the 2024 Games this weekend.\n\n“It could be very challenging for communities hosting these events, such as a $400,000 shortfall and a lack of volunteers — post-COVID many organizations are struggling to find volunteers to step up. I know that another municipality was going to place a bid on these Games but are pulling out based on this information. It does make me step back and say, ‘hang on’,” the mayor said. “It pains me to say, but I can’t support this.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHost municipalities will receive a provincial $420,000 grant, and the Games could be eligible for other grants and casino funding. The county also intends to attract sponsorship and other municipal support.\n\nIn full support, Ward 3 Coun. Lorne Harvey said he wasn’t worried about volunteers because people always step up locally to help pull off big events.\n\n“I’m looking forward to us putting a bid on this because it does bring recognition to the community. It’s great for the youth in our community and it brings more people in. It’s a great social event as well as a sporting event, so I’m fully 100 per cent in support of this,” he said.\n\nOver the past few decades, Strathcona County has become somewhat of a powerhouse for hosting big events, which have included the 2023 Alberta Special Olympics Winter Games, the RCMP Musical Ride, the 2014 Canada 55+ Games, 2007 Western Canada Summer Games, 2000 Alberta Winter Games, Edmonton Oilers training camps, the Canadian Birkebeiner Ski Festival, and Olympics qualification events. There is also the upcoming L’Etape Canada by Tour de France in August.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nNotably, Strathcona County hosted a Summer Games back in 1987, just days after the Tornado, and the community rallied together to make the event happen.\n\n“Any reason to get the old Sneakers costume out of the closet is always a good thing, for those of you who have been around since the 80s, you’ll remember Sneakers,” Ward 1 Coun. Robert Parks said. “I suspect there will be a lot of embracing of the event if we were to hold it.”\n\nLooking at the most recent Special Olympics, RPC reported that it was originally pinned at costing the county $660,000 to host, but it came in under budget by $100,000. Another $2.1 million in economic spinoffs, especially for local hotels, was reported by the county’s Economic Development and Tourism Department. If the county hosts the Alberta Summer Games, that number will differ because athletes will be housed in athletes’ villages located across properties owned by Elk Island Catholic and Public Schools, however, athletes’ families and friends will need lodging.\n\nBased on recent Games, the county maintained that the economic impact regionally could be about $2.1 million.\n\nThe county will submit a bid no later than August 31, which will be followed by a site tour by Games administration. The hosting rights will be awarded in November.\n\n[email protected]\n\ntwitter.com/LindsayDMorey\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Alberta Hydrogen Centre of Excellence recently announced $2 million in funding to support a study that could lead to Strathcona County being home to the first 100 per cent hydrogen community in North America.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nTogether, ATCO and Qualico are studying the logistics, technology requirements and other considerations involved in safely and affordably developing hydrogen communities. Findings will demonstrate feasibility and contribute to designing Strathcona County’s Bremner growth area, a future home to 85,000 residents and to commercial and industrial businesses.\n\nArticle content\n\nThis is an important step towards eliminating carbon emissions and another showcase for the region as a strong hydrogen hub. With multiple hydrogen delivery and processing locations, including Alberta’s Industrial Heartland and Strathcona’s Industrial Area, the county provides the perfect testing environment with access to existing experience in hydrogen production.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThis announcement continues the county’s commitment to hydrogen-based initiatives, such as the hydrogen fuel cell electric bus that’s headed for the road this spring. As part of Alberta Zero Emission Hydrogen Transit initiative, Emissions Reduction Alberta provided $4.6 million in funding towards the City of Edmonton and Strathcona County purchasing and testing two hydrogen fuel cell electric buses. Once operational, the buses’ performance evaluated to help inform next steps.\n\nAn environmental framework\n\nThe Environmental Framework enables the county and its stakeholders to work together on environmental stewardship that addresses climate change and demonstrates responsible use of land and natural resources. It ensures environmental action and responsibility is part of the county’s decision-making in programs, plans and policies. The county has reframed its focus on achievable, place-based environmental outcomes: air, water, land, biological diversity, waste and energy.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCurrent practices and future initiatives include greenhouse gas reduction; ensuring water supply meets future needs; smart growth community design; citizen stewardship to support biodiversity conservation; the waste management road map; and energy management within our buildings and fleet operations.\n\nEnergy management\n\nThe county continues to work toward reducing energy use and increasing energy efficiency in its buildings.\n\nThrough extensive facility energy audits to investing in energy efficient improvements such as LED lighting, high efficiency HVAC and solar, the county is reducing GHG emissions and realizing cost savings.\n\nFor example, the energy efficient lighting replacement project at Millennium Place completed last year is estimated to reduce GHG emissions by 379 tonnes per year, with annual energy cost savings of about $45,000.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSetting a greenhouse gas reduction target is important to making energy management a priority. From the 2018 levels, the target is to reduce county buildings GHG emissions by 15 per cent by 2030.\n\nOn the fleet side, several green initiatives are also in the works. This includes the county’s anti-idling policy and ‘smart’ GHG emissions reporting to improve fuel efficiency, and the new hydrogen fuel cell electric bus.\n\nConserving energy and transitioning to alternative energy sources, coupled with conserving and restoring natural ecosystems, are important and necessary activities to focus on between now and 2030. It’s part of our commitment to healthy ecosystems and healthy citizens.\n\nThis column was written and submitted by Strathcona County staff.\n\nArticle content\n\nAmid dry conditions, a fire advisory is currently in effect in Strathcona County.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBased on ultra dry spring conditions, the municipal issued the fire advisory status on Wednesday, April 10, and with that came a temporary suspension for fire and fireworks permits.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnyone looking to have an open fire, burn barrels, brush fires or the like need to have a fire permit and need to call the local Burning Status Line at 780-464-8464 or text BURN to 587-340-3696 before burning. Daily updates on that line is required as conditions may change.\n\n“With the lack of rain and drier conditions, that’s our first step. It’s still cooler at night so fires won’t have extreme fire behaviour because the heat isn’t here yet, so by putting this advisory in, that’s our first level (of defence). It really brings an awareness to residents that conditions are dry and we could restrict permit burning at a moment’s notice,” Strathcona County Emergency Services’ (SCES) Deputy Chief Gordon George told The News on Monday, April 15.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSCES is actively monitoring local Fire Weather Index, which has been running across the board from ‘low’ to ‘high’ daily over the past few days.\n\n“If we consistently see that move into ‘extreme’, that’s typically when we move into a fire ban. That’s when we have the risk of fires getting out of control,” George explained. “If we also see that our crews are being challenged by doing call after call, that’s another criteria for us to move into a ban.”\n\n“If we don’t see moisture within the next week, we’ll probably be moving into a restriction and, potentially, a fire ban.”\n\nSince last Wednesday, SCES has responded to 10 notable fires, including six fires caused by rail cars located north of Highway 16, some in the northern county, and some off Wye Road. Another brush fire was caused by a vehicle scraping along the road on Range Road 213, north of Highway 16 on Sunday. Another fire was caused by a resident who did not have a permit on Wednesday for a burn barrel. For the most part, local firefighters extinguished these fires within 30 minutes, but some, such as a grass fire on RR215 on April 10 and a grass fire on RR212 on April 11, took longer to knock back and required upwards of three hours.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“When there is no snow before the green up, all of trees are sucking up all of the moisture and competing with the grass, so that grass is ready to burn. Anybody that burns when the conditions do not permit, and really we’re talking about the wind, they’re putting themselves and the community at risk,” George said.\n\n“Overall, our residents are being responsible and they’re following the rules and adhering to the permit conditions. We’re not seeing fires caused by residents who were burning appropriately,” he added.\n\nIf the county moves into a fire ban, open fires such as brush and bonfires would not be permitted. Burn barrels, fireworks, fire pits, chimineas, and solid fuel barbecues and smokes (charcoal, pellets, etc.) without an on/off switch would also not be allowed.\n\n“People just need to be cautious and just follow the rules,” George underlined.\n\nTo receive notifications about local fire restrictions or bans, sign up for SC Alerts through strathcona.ca/SCAlert or download the SC Alert app on the App Store for iPhones on the Google Play Store for Android phones.\n\n[email protected]\n\nX: LindsayDMorey\n\nSHERWOOD PARK, AB – A new brewery and taproom that aims “to provide an inclusive space that welcomes all beer drinkers, from novice to nerd to veteran” is opening this weekend in Sherwood Park, a community in Alberta’s Strathcona County.\n\nManual Labour Beer Co. is described by owners Richard and Nicole as follows:\n\nManual Labour Beer Co. is a microbrewery on the edge of suburban and rural life, in the heart of Strathcona County, Alberta.

However, encouraging local sports tourism is still a priority for the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (RMWB) and Fort McMurray’s athletic community.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Strathcona County’s exceptional infrastructure, passion for sports and renowned hospitality make it a perfect fit to host the 2026 Alberta Summer Games,” said Nate Glubish, UCP MLA for Strathcona-Sherwood Park, in a statement.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Alberta government asked the RMWB to bid on the games after the region hosted the Arctic Winter Games in February. In June, council unanimously approved creating a committee to pitch hosting the event to Alberta Games. The RMWB would have spent $2.6 million from the emerging issues reserve following a successful bid for the games.\n\nThe games are expected to bring about 2,000 to 2,500 coaches, chaperones, officials and athletes to the host community. Athletes are between 11 and 16 years old, and compete in between 10 to 14 sporting events.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFort McMurray Wood Buffalo Economic Development and Tourism (FMWBEDT) predicted games of this size would net $3.6 million for the local economy and support 1,482 jobs. Keith Smith, the RMWB’s public works director, said at a June meeting that games of this size can cost between $2 million to $4 million, but costs would be offset by grants and sponsorships.\n\nThe bid won the support of community and athletic organizations in Fort McMurray. This included the leadership of Fort McMurray’s public and Catholic schools, Keyano College, the Regional Recreation Corporation, FMWBEDT and Wood Buffalo Sport Connection.\n\nThe RMWB’s Sport Strategic Plan says Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo is well prepared for sports tourism and athletic events. Most sports facilities were built or upgraded within the past 15 years. There is a sprawling trail system maintained year-round.
