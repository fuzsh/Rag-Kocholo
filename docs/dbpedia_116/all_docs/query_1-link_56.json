        "text": "500 Days I’m grateful to have completed the milestone of finishing 500 consecutive days of exercise in China on July 17, especially at the place where my father used to be. Over the past few weeks during my vacation, I’ve continued to exercise daily in various forms: ~ Walking stairs and doing bodyweight exercises when at home; ~ high intensity strength training when I was in world-class gyms on the cruise ship and in hotels in Shanghai (Mom’s hometown) and Shenyang (wife’s hometown); ~ the most enjoyable part was experiencing street workouts in a park in Shenyang and meeting many older fitness enthusiasts (A true statement of Older, Bolder Better), which gave me a glimpse of myself in a few decades! ~ I confess: I also drank alcohol and ate ice cream in various occasions, I even tried the ice cream with added Chinese liquor (52% alcohol). Dad, my watch indicates the next milestone is 1000 days. I’ll report back to you then! I hope by that time, your beloved grandson Kilin will not just pose for photos but will truly join me in the gym for workouts.\n\n365 days: From FEAR to FEARLESSNESS. On June 17th a year ago, after a 162-day battle in the ICU, my brave and strong father held on until the last moment. His passing has left an unhealable scar in my life, but it also granted me an incredibly precious ability (which I thought I always had as a gerontologist but actually never possessed): the ability to move from the fear of death to fearlessness towards it! This “fearless mindset” has spread through every aspect of my life and work: * Dad, I no longer suffer from insomnia, I can handle stress better, and I’ve found a better balance between work and life. * Starting from March 4th last year, I’ve been committed to daily exercise, now at 471 days straight, improving my health significantly. * I can face and deal with others’ opinions and suggestions—whether well-intentioned or malicious, beneficial or not—with more calmness. * I’ve also inherited your fearlessness in public speaking. In the past year, I’ve spoken at various events about healthy aging and staying positive about life and death. Both friends and strangers have said that I’ve become more confident and comfortable when speaking. I always mention your influence on me, and I believe you can hear it from heaven. All of this is because of the ability you gifted me: when I view problems from the perspective of life and death, I am FEARLESS! Father, today marks the first anniversary of your passing, and it also happens to be the second day of Father’s Day this year. I’m standing in your office, next to your photo, reporting to you as what I already did in the past. I’ve taken back my doctoral ring and exchanged it for the one I had made for you when I graduated in 2013. This way, I’m always by your side in China, and you’re always with me as I continue to tackle life’s hurdles.\n\nOLDER, BOLDER, BETTER ™! Seniors Exhibition and Symposium – 27TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION In 1996, our Organization (formerly named Edmonton Self-Starter Organization) started its first trademarked Older, Bolder, Better. After more than 2.5 decades, we hosted our 27th event on yesterday, June 6, 2024. The day was filled with energy and vibrancy: Lion Dance from JingYing Martial Arts, Keynote speaker Shane Blakely, government officials (Lori Sigurdson and Tim Cartmell, P.Eng., M.Eng., PMP) bringing greetings, major sponsor speakers sharing aging in place resources, Facebook Live, Edmonton Accordion Society performance, NOW Radio! Popsicles, and 50 plus exhibitors including multisectoral partners. A great day for seniors and their social networks. A huge thank you to our staff team, volunteers team, seniors-friendly exhibitors who made this event one of the most successful events for seniors during the Seniors Week. Lastly, I want to take the chance to thank our sponsor NorQuest College, which not only provided a significant financial support for our event, but also sent their students to volunteer. We will have more exciting collaborations to share in upcoming months, stay tuned! WESeniors’ OBB will continue to serve our communities and help our seniors become younger, Bolder, and always better! Our WESeniors platform is here to connnect seniors! Come and experience it! www.weseniors.ca.\n\n“Alberta Seniors Week” is definitely the best week for “WESeniors”. We have a whole week’s events put together for seniors in Greater Edmonton area. We kicked off the week on Saturday through 630 CHED’s Talk to the Expert. Today, WESeniors hosted our 2nd Alberta Seniors Week Celebration at Strathcona County, attracting over 370 seniors. Thank you MLA Kyle K. (Kasawski) for bringing greetings from the province and thank you Mayor Rod Frank, JD for bringing greetings to our seniors. Huge thank you to our senior friendly businesses, nonprofit organizations and County Departments that support and participate in the event. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank my WESeniors Strathcona team, in particular Lorena Smalley who is the brain and doer behind this successful event. Thank you to the County team members Shaina and William as well as Westend Seniors Activity Centre team members (e.g., Thomas, Charis, Mikayla) for your ongoing dedication. Thank you to our lovely volunteers including the performers who made our work so much easier. Finally, seniors love ❤️ firefighters (they were cooking hotdogs for the event!) More events to be celebrated this week! Tomorrow night will be the business mixer, preparation for the Thursday Older, Bolder, Better Seniors Symposium and Exhibition!\n\nKicking off Alberta Seniors Week with “Talk to the Experts” at 630 CHED. Another fun conversation with my colleagues Izabella Roth, CEO of Infinity Healthcare Ltd and Alison Shea Reaves, the Academic Program Manager for the Work-Integrated Learning & Career Education Centre at NorQuest College. Thank you to our host Daryl Hooke, without you, the show won’t be so unique and engaging! Izabella and her team have raised the bar for Health care to a whole new level. People-centred, wrapped around support, cultural sensitivity, Izabella has redefined these terms and made her platform a forward thinking leader. Give them a call: always a REAL person 24/7! WESeniors has been working with NorQuest College for many years. As a researcher, I always struggle to bridge the academic research with real world practice. NorQuest’s Work-Integrated Program has created that bridge for our communities. As one of the employers, we not only host their students for practicums, but also hire their graduates. We are extremely grateful for the partnership with and support from NorQuest. I will take the opportunity to invite people to come and check out our 27th trademarked Older, Bolder, Better! Seniors Exhibition and Symposium. Come and learn about our WESeniors platform! WESeniors: We connect seniors! On another note, come and check out our partnering organization Edmonton Accordion Society’s amazing event happening today at our Centre (9629 176 street). This is how we “implement” partnership!\n\nBeing recognized by Government Officials from three levels of government is already an honor.
