        "text": "Article content\n\nPromising a different way of enjoying the golden years, Aster Gardens officially opened its doors this week.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAfter two years of development and construction, the 157-suite fully-independent living seniors residence, located 7 Brower Drive in Sherwood Park, offers a contemporary take towards retirement, which takes into account the different needs and interest of all seniors.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAster Gardens seniors residence finally blossoms Back to video\n\n“We believe passionately that our success is measured by the degree all residents who live in our seniors’ communities feel like it’s home,” he said. “Surrounded by friends and family, everyone has the opportunity to live with purpose,” Ali Shivji, principal of Optima Living said on opening day.\n\nOptima Living and partners Pangman Development Corporation, and the founders of Synergy Wellness Centre made the $50 million private investment possible.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Such a major investment represents a commitment to Sherwood Park and Alberta from the private sector to grow jobs, provide excellence in seniors living and optimism in a post COVID recovery,” stated Optima in a press release.\n\nThe name itself — Aster — comes from the flower which is local to Sherwood Park, which is known to bloom later in the season.\n\n“Imagine starting your day with a dip in the saltwater exercise pool followed by breakfast in one of the seven dining areas with food prepared by Red Seal-certified chefs. Then you have many different activities to select from: a short game on the rooftop putting green, a morning stroll through the garden, time in the art studio, or maybe a group yoga class. Perhaps, quiet time reading in the library or relaxing at the spa and enjoying an in-house massage is more your style. The bistro has snacks available or settle in at the pub or relax on the rooftop patio,” Optima Living outlined.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe facility also offers a memory care program for people with cognitive concerns such as Alzheimer’s disease, other kinds of dementia and memory concerns. That was developed in collaboration with the University of Alberta and the University of Manitoba to ensure person-centred care.\n\nMayor Rod Frank and both local MLAs, Nate Glubish and Jordan Walker were given a private tour of the facility this week.\n\nGlublish was impressed with the facility.\n\n“I love how Aster Gardens has made an effort to integrate with the local community, including local physicians, pharmacists, and academics with expertise in memory care. This state-of-the-art community will offer a great choice for local seniors to stay close to their families in Sherwood Park,” he said.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe mayor thanked all of those involved and said this facility is another avenue people can utilize to age in place and remain in their hometown.\n\n“What Aster Gardens means to me is that older Albertans ready to explore different housing with extensive services and supports have a perfect option right here. They don’t need to move away from Sherwood Park and Strathcona County to find it,” Frank said.\n\nWalker added Aster Gardens will also draw attention from seniors across the province.\n\n“This is such an extraordinary project. Not only will it attract people from the local area, but I fully expect we’ll get seniors from across northern Alberta and elsewhere seriously considering Aster Gardens when the time comes for a different type of housing,” he said.\n\nA grand opening will take place once COVID-19 restrictions and protocols allow.\n\nlmorey@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/LindsayDMorey\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories\n\nNews Near Sherwood Park"
