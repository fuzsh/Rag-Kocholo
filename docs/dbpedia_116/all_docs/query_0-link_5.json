geographic area of the city in which businesses pool resources and work together, through a formal association, to enhance the economic development of their area,\"[65] such as through various improvements, initiatives, programs, promotions and festivals to attract customers.[66]\n\nThe authority for Edmonton to establish a BIA is enabled by section 50 of the Municipal Government Act.[67] Some of Edmonton's BIAs share their name with neighbourhoods, but their boundaries do not coincide with those of the neighbourhoods.[4][68][69] Edmonton has 13 BIAs as of 2022 :[65]\n\nSee
