        "text": "Calgary, AB\n\nCalgary is the jewel of Alberta. It doesn't really get its due in some list from some sources1 because some smaller towns in the province have lower unemployment or a higher median household income — factors you probably care less about when you're retired. And it's been ranked by The Economist2 as the 5th most livable in the city. If you want to be near family, near the best health care, in the best overall city in the province, Calgary's your choice.\n\nWithin the city of Calgary there are several exceptional areas and neighbourhoods. Two of the cleaner, friendlier, more retirement-friendly neighbourhoods in the city are Rocky Ridge and the Christie Park- Signal Hill area. These are both suitably close to the outskirts, with fresh mountain air in from the west, combined with the suburban quietude and peace you crave. Money, as they say, isn't everything, and at Comfort Life we look at the overall comfort you will find in retirement, instead of the hard statistics MoneySense might look at. And we know from talking to people in neighbourhoods like Rocky Ridge that life here is wonderfully comfortable.\n\nLeo and Maxine Nugent moved into a retirement community here and they love the fact they are \"all of a sudden free of the things tying [them] down.\" They love the environment in the Rocky Ridge area of Calgary. Says Leo, \"We walk a mile or so every day. We can see the mountains, and we breathe that clean mountain air.\"\n\nWhen you choose a place to retire, you want to think ahead to how you will feel once you settle there. And in the Rocky Ridge neighbourhood of Calgary, Leo and Maxine say that after they made the move, they wondered, \"Why didn't we do it five or ten years ago.\" If you move to a Calgary neighbourhood that makes you regret not moving there earlier, you know you've made the right choice. \"Only yesterday,\" says Leo, \"we were saying how right we were to come here.\"\n\nCheck out a full list of Calgary retirement communities.\n\nLloydminster, AB\n\nLloydminster is a solid, conservative town, where people take hard work and self-discipline seriously. Given that the town was created as an attempt at a temperate utopia defined by fidelity and sobriety, you can still feel those roots here. It's a \"nice place to live.\" You may not always feel safe in some other cities, but Gaye is one older person who found a lovely home near the center of town. She has all she needs, \"easy access to shopping, medical facilities and pathways to recreational activities.\"\n\nFind a great place to retire in Lloydminster.\n\nCanmore, AB\n\nCanmore, just 20 kilometers outside of Banff, and a little over an hour outside of Calgary was listed as the 7th best place to live in Canada by MoneySense1, in 2018. A high average net household worth in a small town setting, with a number of other great qualities (for example, low unemployment, low property taxes, and a decreasing crime rate that is already low) make this an attractive place to live. For those who are retirement age, though, there are different considerations. Canmore is in the mountains, a little removed from major centres and there is a greater availability of high quality health care, in places like Calgary.\n\nCanmore is also home to one of the most spectacular retirement communities outside of Calgary. Amelia moved here from out of the area, to be closer to family. For her, it's all about the friends she's made. \"You socialize here, every day, it's so easy. I used to eat alone, and within ten minutes your breakfast is over. Now it’s an hour and a half, and I’m still having breakfast! Second cup of coffee … third cup of coffee because you’re surrounded by people your own age. It’s so healthy!\"\n\nFind top places to retire in Canmore.\n\nEdmonton\n\nEdmonton is the 68th highest rated place to live in Canada, according to MoneySense1. As a major centre, it offers everything you need in terms of conveniences and entertainment. Of course, some of those things are less important in retirement but the high quality of health care services available in the city of Edmonton also make it attractive for those who are older. Progressive-minded Edmonton is home to several stellar new retirement communities that incorporate all that's great about contemporary retirement living.\n\nFind the best places to retire in Edmonton.\n\nStrathcona County, AB\n\nStrathcona County, just east of Edmonton, is ranked #59 on the overall list of best places to live in Canada, by MoneySense, in 20181. As with a number of Alberta communities, it's highly rated for its low unemployment and high median household income. Those factors, though, may be less important to people living in retirement. That said, Strathcona County offers much for people later in life who may be more comfortable with a slower pace and quieter lifestyle. There is Sherwood Park surrounded by large rural areas and smaller hamlets in the county, all perfect places for those looking for peaceful digs. There are great things to do in Strathcona itself (like taking in some great shows at Festival Place) but there is also the proximity to Edmonton.\n\nFind top places to retire in Strathcona County.\n\nSt. Albert, AB\n\nSt. Albert is selected by MoneySense as the fifth best place to live in Alberta, and 19th overall in Canada1. Why is St. Albert so highly rated? It's a small town where people have a high income and high average net worth. Other factors that make this ideal are great access to health care and a low crime rate. \"The Botanical Arts City,\" just northwest of Edmonton, is also highly rated for its low rate of unemployment. St. Albert is just a beautiful spot to settle into retirement, and has a moderate population just above 60,000. If you are looking for a peaceful town3 close to the attractions and options available in a major center (while removed from the noise and busyness at the same time), St. Albert is indeed a great place to retire.\n\nThere are a number of active adult lifestyle communities near here.\n\nClaresholme, Alberta\n\nYou might not find it on any other list of best places, because Claresholme is one of the best kept secrets in Alberta. This small town (population 3,780 and counting!) features one of the most progressive-minded retirement villages in the country. It consists entirely of bungalows, ideally designed for people who think life is better without stairs to climb. It’s \"top notch,\" brags one resident.\n\nSmall towns like this are an ideal retirement destination for people from Calgary and Edmonton, who can easily use the equity from homes to purchase a home here that’s ideally suited to who they are now. Here, life is simpler, land is cheaper, and the living is easier. Claresholme also stands out for an ideally humid continental climate, while winter’s chinook winds can suddenly raise the temperature to well above freezing. Visit soon, and you could find yourself agreeing wholeheartedly with the town’s motto, \"now you’re living … now you’re home.\"\n\nFind a great place to retire in Claresholm."
