        "text": "This project was one of three Needs Assessments that the RCS team was retained to conduct for facility renewal projects in Burnaby (the Northeast Quadrant Community Space Needs Assessment specifically informed renewal of the Cameron Recreation Complex). The project included engagement with residents through a public survey and stakeholders through a series of workshop style meetings. A review of existing facility utilization, trends, and previous planning also informed the study. The Needs Assessment provided the City and design team with a high level identification of future space component and amenity needs and provided a basis for the development of a functional facility program.\n\nThe Strathcona County Recreation and Culture was developed with the influence of 34,000 community perspectives and thorough research and analysis. The Strategy is meant to provide direction for all members of the recreation and culture delivery system and sets a strategic course of action for volunteers, the non-profit and private sectors, other stakeholders and local government. The County also developed an Implementation Plan outlining how it plans to react to the broader community-wide Strategy over a 12+ year time frame.\n\nThis project involved developed a new Recreation Services Master Plan for a service area that includes Electoral Areas E, F, G, and H, the City of Parksville, and the Town of Qualicum Beach. The Master Plan process included engagement with residents, facility groups and other stakeholders, leading to the identification of opportunities to enhance service delivery and a handful of future infrastructure priorities. The Master Plan is intended to provide staff and elected officials with a point of reference to inform future decision making and resource allocations.\n\nWorking together through the regional Family and Community Support Services (FCSS), the Town of Rocky Mountain House, Village of Caroline, and Clearwater County wanted to better understand the social needs of area seniors. The assessment includes a demographic analysis (along with population projections) of the three municipalities in the region. High level municipal planning documents and strategies were examined as well for the three municipalities and an inventory of regional services was completed which identified programs available to seniors in the region. A key component of the Needs Assessment was the engagement program. This included a survey of seniors in the region to learn first-hand the circumstances in which they live and needs they have. Agencies serving the seniors in the region were also surveyed and community stakeholder meetings were convened. Based on all research completed a series of conclusions were drawn which was used by FCSS to make decisions on service delivery and to work with its community partners on collaborative approaches.\n\nThe Master Plan provides a point of reference for Town Council, Administration, and the FCSS Board as decisions are made and priorities set to address preventative social services. The recommendations are categorized into communication and awareness; partnerships and collaborations; internal priorities and focus areas; and delivery and resourcing approaches. These recommendations were developed based on a thorough program of research that included a review of a previous plan, and a broad array of engagement. Engagement tactics included the following: community conversation open house; stakeholder discussion sessions; youth survey; and a community wide survey. Associated costs and timing for all recommendations was presented as well.\n\nThis report provides detailed findings from a program of public consultation that included stakeholder discussion sessions, (11 sessions including 66 individuals), a public survey (n=3,043) and an online mapping tool that enabled residents to share their thoughts spatially (160 unique comments). The stakeholder discussion sessions included disparate perspectives including active recreation users, historical enthusiasts, environmental perspectives, educational institutions, and others. Through discussions and a final session with representatives from all groups, a common vision, values, principles for use, and management strategies were identified. The public survey invited all households in the city with the opportunity to provide their thoughts on the river valley including areas of concern, barriers to use, its importance, and priorities for management actions. While the survey was primarily fielded online, provisions were made for participation by hard copy questionnaire. This report will help guide the future planning process for the river valley.\n\nThe Battlefords Joint Park & Recreation Master Plan serves as a guide to planning for parks and recreation in the Battlefords. This plan provides detailed findings resulting from a comprehensive public engagement process that included a public survey, and consultation with specific stakeholder groups, including youth in the community. All households in the market area were sent a postcard that included information about the project as well as a unique access code (the access codes were unique to each household and served as a control mechanism limiting multiple responses). Approximately 300 households provided input (n=297). An invitation to provide input was extended to a broad list of community groups; twenty-eight (n=28) provided a response. These groups included indoor and outdoor sport organizations, recreation groups for youth through to adults, and arts and culture groups. Meetings were convened as well with approximately forty stakeholder groups that included school jurisdictions, social agencies, service clubs, tourism groups and so on. Multi-perspective discussion sessions were convened as well as individual interviews. Finally youth in the community were specifically consulted; team members visited three schools in the community and spoke with youth in informal conversations during school break times. All engagement findings served as integral input to the Master Plan.\n\nResearch for this report involved an extensive program of community engagement with a survey of households in the Strathmore area – including the Town and nearby Wheatland County (n=283 responses), a community group survey (n=35 responses) and stakeholder meetings and interviews (n=30 organizations). Stakeholders included a broad array from businesses, service clubs, sport and recreation groups, youth organizations, through to the Agricultural Society. The engagement provided insight into how recreational and cultural facilities are being used, and what community priorities are as it relates to facility investment. This report provides an overview of service delivery for recreation and cultural services, as well as an inventory of facilities and their usage. A summary of key findings provides recommendations for future planning and to guide the development of the Recreation, Culture & Facilities Master plan.\n\nThe City of North Vancouver Council’s Strategic Plan (2018-2022) has set a vision to be the “Healthiest Small City in the World” and lays the foundation for community recreation planning. “A Healthy City for All: The Role of Community Recreation” outlines a four-step decision-making tool to support the City as it contemplates future investment in new facilities for community recreation:\n\nStep 1: How well does an amenity meet our goals?\n\nStep 2: Do we have the right amount and range of amenities?\n\nSept 3: How do we prioritize delivery of enhanced or new amenities?\n\nStep 4: Taking action & moving forward.\n\nThis tool is designed to be used as part of the City’s planning process for community recreation which includes ongoing data collection and feasibility studies. This plan does not include any specific recommendations for the enhancement or development of amenities.\n\nTo inform the development of the Mountain Bike Guidelines, the Capital Regional District Board established the Mountain Bike Advisory Committee (MBAC). MBAC brought together representatives from mountain biking organizations, outdoor recreation interests, the conservation and naturalist community, First Nations and the CRD Regional Parks Committee. Chaired by RC Strategies, the Committee prepared advice and guidance on a range of issues related to mountain biking in regional parks, such as what type of mountain bike experiences are most needed and most appropriate for these parks. Amongst the many issues examined by MBAC, the committee provided recommendations as to how mountain biking and mountain bike trails can be managed to avoid and minimize impacts to ecological, indigenous and cultural heritage values in regional parks.\n\nThe City of Kelowna developed the Special Event Volunteer Program to help organizers of special events with volunteer recruitment and training. The program includes an online marketplace where special event organizers can post their volunteer positions and connect with volunteers looking for opportunities. It will also offer training for volunteer coordinators or special event organizers in volunteer management and other skills needed to produce special events. As part of the implementation of the program staff support was recommended.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic impacted people’s use of trails as well as their perception of safety. The guidelines provided consistent operational and management practices that all trail operators should consider to minimize the risk of Covid-19 transmission and to help visitors feel safer while enjoying their trail experiences. The guidelines were developed by employing a multi-pronged approach:\n\nReview of federal, provincial, and territorial literature including public health orders;\n\nLiterature review to identify national and international guidelines and best practices; and\n\nInterviews with a sample of trail operators;\n\nThe document presents guidelines to manage visitation. Included is a risk assessment tool which helps operators determine which management actions to implement. Management actions include both direct and indirect tools and further identify how each tool aligns with relative risks of Covid-19 transmission. Further, the document outlines procedures for cleaning and disinfecting amenities. Finally guidelines related to safe work practices are covered.\n\nThe plan presents an approach to developing the network of Indigenous signature trails. Through the development of the plan, the future of trails tourism was defined. This included designing trail experiences and supporting amenities that share the Village’s and Nation’s story; determining local services that could support the trails tourism; identifying management strategies; all within the context of community engagement, sustainability, and truth & reconciliation.\n\nThe plan included a trail network classification system, design guidelines, and necessary support amenities (including trail heads, parking, wayfinding signage, view points, and interpretative elements. Because of the significance of this initiative to the Village and the importance of providing a fulsome experience, recommendations were presented related to enhancements in the Village itself. Actions are prioritized and cost estimates are included.\n\nThe Kakwa Falls Trail in Kakwa Wildland Provincial Park, experiences considerable mixed use in the summer. Its primary purposes are to provide access to the Kakwa Falls in Kakwa Wildland Provincial Park and to provide access to other nearby trails within the Park. In the winter, the Trail is one busiest and most popular snowmobiling routes in northwest Alberta. The trail serves as the primary access to British Columbia’s Kakwa Provincial Park and its backcountry snowmobiling opportunities.\n\nThough enjoyed as a year-round recreational trail for decades, the Kakwa Falls Trail is an old industrial road which was never intended, nor has it been redesigned, to support quality and sustainable motorized or non-motorized recreational trail experiences. Alberta Environment and Parks wanted to improve the sustainability and safety of the trail thereby improving the quality of the visitor experience.\n\nThe purpose of the Study was to identify trail upgrades and / or rerouting options to resolve sustainability problems; identify potential ecological, historic resource and land use concerns associated with each option; and prepare cost estimates for identified trail upgrades. This was completed after an inventory and assessment of the sustainability problems was undertaken along with engagement with stakeholders.\n\nThe Tenquille Lake area is a popular tourist and recreation destination. With its increase in popularity as a site for recreation, there is concern for how this growth in visitation is impacting the area’s natural environment.\n\nThis study examined current visitation patterns and recreation use of the Tenquille Lake area, and provides an inventory of recreation amenities and infrastructure such as trails and campsites in the area. It also examines the impact of recreation upon the Tenquille Lake – Owl Lakes Recreation Area (TOLRA) and provides recommendations for management issues that will need to be addressed by the visitor management plan. This study was the result of extensive consultation with visitors and stakeholders of the TOLRA.\n\nThis study will influence the Ministry of Forest, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNFORD)’s visitor management planning process for the TOLRA. The focus of this study was limited geographically by trails leading to and the area immediately adjacent to Tenquille Lake.\n\nNote: This document is not currently available publicly.\n\nThe Horseshoe Canyon plays a critical role in introducing and greeting visitors to the badlands. The Horseshoe Canyon Master Plan defines how the canyon will be developed, managed and marketed over the next 10 years. The plan was developed through consultation with residents, stakeholders and partners.\n\nThe plan outlines the visitor experiences that will be delivered in the canyon and the infrastructure and amenities that will need to be developed to facilitate those experiences. It also provides management strategies to ensure that visitation to the canyon minimizes any negative ecological impacts.\n\nThe plan makes recommendations that will help increase the direct and indirect economic contributions that tourism to the Canyon is making to the County and region. It will guide all capital, operational, management and marketing decisions regarding the canyon.\n\nThe increasing popularity of the Squamish River Valley as a recreation and tourist destination calls for a comprehensive plan to manage how the valley is used as a site for public recreation. The Squamish River Valley Visitor Management Plan was the result of extensive consultation with the Squamish First Nation, the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation, as well as residents, stakeholders and recreational users. The plan:\n\nEstablishes a shared understanding of recreation activities and use patterns within the Valley;\n\nIdentifies the desired visitor experience and resource conditions;\n\nDetails the most concerning recreation management issues that are occurring in the Valley;\n\nIdentifies the structures and actions that will be taken to enhance the quality of recreation experiences while managing undesirable impacts and balancing recreation use with other values in the Valley; and\n\nSets the indicators and monitoring strategy that will be used to trigger further management actions and track the success of the plan.\n\nThe plan outlines how to improve public recreation, through new investments in recreation management and infrastructure in the Valley, over the next 10 years.\n\nNote: This document is not currently available publicly.\n\nIn an effort to better understand the social needs of residents in the Lac Ste. Anne County area, the County undertook the development of this Social Needs Assessment. In order to effectively support the community, it is imperative that the needs of the community are understood. This report presents the information gathered and research completed to gain an understanding of the community’s needs. Based on an analysis of this information conclusions are drawn that will be utilized by Lac Ste. Anne County as it makes decisions related to resource allocation in order to best address the identified needs.\n\nThe Master Plan provides a long term sustainable strategy over the next ten to fifteen years. It has a solid foundation that includes the vision, mission, and guiding principles, outcomes and nineteen recommendations organized into three categories: programming & events, parks and recreation infrastructure, and service delivery. Community engagement was a significant input to the Master Plan. It included a mailout survey (n=1,255), a survey of community organizations delivery services (n=28), and a series of interviews and discussion sessions throughout the study area (n= 60 organizations).\n\nThe delivery of community programming through the Community Associations is a cost effective method of service delivery for the City. The City supports these important volunteer organizations in their delivery of recreational programs and community events and wants to ensure their sustainability. Recognizing the independence of the Community Associations, this strategy identifies approaches and a philosophical stance the City should adopt to support and strengthen this important delivery model.\n\nThe master plan details the priorities and actions that should be implemented to:\n\nAchieve a world-class export-ready trail experience and exceptional local recreation resource;\n\nResolve the recreation use conflicts along the trail;\n\nImprove the management and integration of non-recreational use of the trail;\n\nImprove the trail tread, maintenance and manage­ment of the trail; and\n\nMitigate the trail’s potential impacts on the envi­ronment, adjacent private landowners and tenure holders.\n\nThis master plan establishes a renewed direction for the future of a segment of KVR Trail. As the owner and manager of the trail, the master plan has been recommended to the Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD) for adoption and implementation.\n\nThis feasibility study recommends the development of an artificial turf sports field retrofit on the existing natural surface field at Ed Eggerer Athletic Park. Led by the Airdrie Field Turf Project Society in association with the City of Airdrie, this study involved extensive public and stakeholder consultation. This feasibility study outlines a market and site analysis, and identifies estimated capital and operating costs. It provides a series of recommended next steps which need to be undertaken prior to the actual development of the project.\n\nThe Keephills Community hub has operated out of a former school since 2018 and is jointly owned by the Keephills Community Association and Parkland County. Drawing upon extensive research and community consultation, this Business Case recommends that the County take over ownership of the property and operate it under the guidance of an advisory board. The Community Association would remain as a long-term tenant, ensuring the community’s ongoing involvement in operating the space. It also recommends that the use of the facility include (but not limited to) arts and culture, learning and library services and community events. The Business Case outlines an estimated operating budget and a long-term plan for capital investment for the hub.\n\nThis Business Case recommends the development of a new Langdon recreation centre which will be developed and co-located on the site of the new high school. It identifies opportunities for the recreation centre and high school to share facilities such as the fitness centre, gymnasium and youth centre, as well as other amenities. This Business Case outlines a conceptual floor plan and renderings for the new facility. It also provides estimates for the capital and operating costs, for developing and running the new facility as a non-profit corporation. This Business Case demonstrates the facility is needed to accommodate Langdon’s current population (with its high proportion of youth and children compared to the provincial average), and also accounts for the expected growth of Langdon’s seniors population as demographics shift in the future.\n\nThis Plan resulted in a recommended course of action for the development of a new aquatic centre. Led by the Aquatic Centre Advisory Committee (ACAC), the recommendation was based on a program of research including comprehensive community engagement. The report has been structured to walk through the steps taken in the Pre-Design process including a preliminary facility program and preliminary concepts. These concepts were vetted with the public and ultimately the ACAC’s recommended facility is presented along with estimated capital and operating costs.\n\nThe “Approach to Community Recreation Facility Planning in Edmonton” is the result of an evidence-based planning process that included extensive public consultation as well as a thorough review and analysis on past planning documents. This plan provides recommendations for strategic investment (both capital and operational) in new and existing community recreation facilities. It outlines what capital investment is needed to develop new facilities, while enhancing existing facilities. This plan also provides a framework for “amenity prioritization” for all indoor and outdoor facilities. It recognizes the need for recreation facilities to be fully accessible: eliminating all physical, social, geographic and financial barriers, so that all people in the Edmonton can fully participate in the City’s recreation programs.\n\nThe Recreation Master Plan was developed through extensive community engagement in addition to a broad program of other research efforts. This Plan provides strategies for service delivery, with an emphasis upon removing barriers to participation due to affordability issues. It identifies three infrastructure principles for guiding the development of future planning and the provision of recreation facilities and spaces:\n\nEnsure that existing recreation infrastructure is sustained before considering new major capital development\n\nPrioritize developing spaces that are multi-functional and able to service a diverse cross-section of ages and interests.\n\nEnsure that inclusivity and access are highly valued considerations in future recreation infrastructure projects.\n\nThis plan also sets priorities for capital investment into existing and new infrastructure.\n\nThe City of Prince Albert Community Services Master Plan was developed with input from representatives from the community including volunteer groups and community services stakeholders. This plan provides recommendations for strategic directions in key areas including service delivery, promotions, the role of community groups and community clubs, planning, infrastructure, and financial services. It recommends maintaining the City’s prominent role in the delivery of community services, while recognizing the crucial role that community organizations play, This Plan also provides recommendations for improving indoor and outdoor infrastructure, and identifies arena sports facilities and multi-use trails as top priorities for investment as part of a comprehensive framework for facility prioritization.\n\nThe Battlefords Joint Parks and Recreation Master Plan has been developed based on a variety of influences and information gathered such as community demographics, resident and community group input and demand, and broad parks and recreation research and experience. This Plan provides strategic recommendations about enhancing and guiding the future state of parks and recreation facilities, spaces, and services. It outlines key directions for the municipalities to take with regard to recreation spending. More importantly, it suggests ways that the City and the Town can work together to optimize resources and enhance the value of recreation in the entire region.\n\nThe Government of Alberta set a goal to double tourism revenue to $20 billion by 2030. This tourism strategy identifies initiatives to encourage more private sector investment in tourism, create jobs and contribute to the economic growth in the province. This strategy brings together all levels of government, community, indigenous partners and the travel industry towards the common goal of building Alberta’s tourism industry over the next ten years.\n\nNote: This document is not currently available publicly.\n\nDevon graduated with his bachelor’s in technology specializing in GIS (Geographic Information Systems) and now has 10 years of consulting experience.
