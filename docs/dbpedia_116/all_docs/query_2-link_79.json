        "text": "Everything You Need in Sherwood Park\n\nAspen Trails\n\nFor 40 years, Genstar has been shaping the landscape of Strathcona County's Sherwood Park. The completion of Aspen Trails marks the final community in Genstar's contribution to transforming land into community on Edmonton's east side.\n\nAspen Trails features a 50-acre urban village with retail conveniences for the whole family. Parks, playgrounds and trails link to heritage trail systems. Aspen Trails was planned to allow residents views of lush urban forests from their backyards. And preserved creeks and trees provide peaceful walking trails that connect to community amenities.\n\nSignificant Transformation\n\nCitadel Heights\n\nCitadel Heights is a master planned community located in Vancouver, British Columbia that represents a fourth generation use of this land. The area was logged, farmed and mined as a gravel quarry by previous owners.\n\nAfter 10 years of overcoming planning and engineering hurdles, Genstar transformed this 300 acre “moonscape” into a magnificent residential community, highly sought after to this day.\n\nAward Winning\n\nGlen Abbey\n\nGlen Abbey is one of Genstar’s most recognizable projects. The award winning community includes the world renowned golf course Glen Abbey, which is home to the Canadian Open. Located 24 miles west of Toronto, 1,059 acres was purchased in 1976 and developed by Genstar through the 80's and 90's.\n\nPlanning of the community was approached with unique sensitivity to the land with nearly 200 acres of open space, premium ravine, forest and cul-de-sac lots. Today, more than 23,000 people live in Glen Abbey and it is one of the most sought after neighbourhoods in the greater Toronto Area.\n\nSince Glenn Abbey, Genstar has developed over 1,700 acres and 9,000 homes in southern Ontario.\n\nFirst Of Its Kind\n\nLake Bonavista\n\nLocated in Southeast Calgary, Lake Bonavista was one of a kind, being the first lake community in Canada. The Community was developed by Genstar and Keith Construction in 1968 and included 3,000 housing units, 1,400 acres of land and a 50 acre lake.\n\nA Diamond In The Rough\n\nLinden Woods\n\nLinden Woods in Winnipeg, Manitoba is situated in the midst of an industrial area, bounded by truck routes, warehouses and two cement plants; a most unusual location for a residential community of 8,000 residents in one of Winnipeg's most sought after communities."
