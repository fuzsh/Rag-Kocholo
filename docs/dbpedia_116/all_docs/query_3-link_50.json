        "text": "Fossil mammals comprising the early (and perhaps earliest) Wasatchian Red Hot local fauna from the Gulf Coastal Plain of Mississippi are described. As currently understood, the fauna consists of 33 species of mammals, including the following new taxa: Mimoperadectes sowasheensis, new species; Apatemys pygmaeus, new species; Palaeosinopa aestuarium, new species; Naranius americanus, new species; Colpocherus mississippiensis, new genus and species; Diacocherus dockeryi, new species; Wyonycteris primitivus, new species; Choctawius foxi, new genus and species; Haplomylus meridionalis, new species; Ectocion nanabeensis, new species; Miacis igniculus, new species; Eogale parydros, new genus and species; Viverriscus omnivorus, new genus and species; Paramys dispar, new species; Corbarimys? nomadus, new species; and Franimys? actites, new species. New combinations proposed here include Plagioctenodon dormaalensis (Quinet, 1964), Plagioctenodon rosei (Gingerich, 1987), Choctawius mckennai (Szalay, 1969), and Paramys wutui (Tong and Dawson, 1995). The Red Hot local fauna derives from an estuarine sand unit that also yields fossil spores, pollen, dinoflagellate cysts, fishes, and snakes. The fauna is taphonomically biased against the preservation of mammals having medium to large body mass. The Red Hot local fauna provides a rare opportunity to gauge the significance of biotic provincialism within North America near the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, a time of dynamic climate change. Faunal endemism with respect to the Rocky Mountain Interior of North America is high at the species level, consistent with evidence for substantive differences in the physical environment and flora. Several lines of evidence, including mammalian biostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy, and dinoflagellate zonation, suggest that the Red Hot local fauna correlates with earliest Wasatchian (Wa-M) faunas from the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming. Latitudinal shifts in taxon ranges coincident with global warming provide an alternative explanation for seemingly transient episodes of phyletic dwarfing among mammals during the PETM in the Bighorn Basin.\n\nCylindrodontids are Eocene and Oligocene protrogomorphous rodents known from North America and Asia. Their oldest reported occurrence had been with North American Bridgerian Mysops. Earliest Wasatchian estuarine deposits at the Red Hot Truck Stop locality in the T4 sand, Tuscahoma Formation, near Meridian, Mississippi, have produced the oldest and most primitive cylindrodontids, having derived familial characters along with a generally primitive morphology. These are referred to three new species of the new genus Tuscahomys: T. medius, T. minor and T. major. These rodents inhabited an estuarine environment having paratropical climatic conditions. An additional species from the early Eocene of Wyoming, Reithroparamys ctenodactylops Korth, 1984, is referred to the new genus as Tuscahomys ctenodactylops (Korth, 1984), new combination.\n\nA new species of the cylindrodontid rodent Tuscahomys Dawson and Beard, 2007, is very well represented by maxillary, mandibular, and dental remains from the late early Wasatchian Smiley Draw local fauna in the Great Divide Basin of Sweetwater County, Wyoming. Tuscahomys walshi , new species, is more derived than earlier Wasatchian members of the genus in showing greater lingual hypsodonty on its upper cheek teeth and a more discrete hypocone on P4, but less derived than its Bridgerian relative Mysops Leidy, 1871, in having less lingually hypsodont upper cheek teeth and a less trenchant protoloph on P4. Tuscahomys walshi thus partly fills a previously existing gap in the early fossil record of cylindrodontids. Tuscahomys shows an unusual pattern of faunal association and relative abundance. It typically occurs as a surprisingly common element of some, but by no means all, early Wasatchian faunas, and it frequently co-occurs with the “condylarths” Meniscotherium Cope, 1874, and Haplomylus Matthew, 1915. This highly selective pattern of relative abundance and faunal association suggests some form of niche specificity for early cylindrodontids, the details of which remain unknown. Phylogenetic analysis supports a relatively basal position for Tuscahomys (and Cylindrodontidae) within the Rodentia, rendering any direct derivation of earliest Wasatchian Tuscahomys from older North American paramyids suspect. An Asian origin for Cylindrodontidae, with subsequent dispersal of Tuscahomys into North America at or near the Clarkforkian-Wasatchian boundary, cannot be dismissed.\n\nUndoubted primates first appear almost synchronously in the fossil records of Asia, Europe, and North America. This temporal pattern has complicated efforts to reconstruct the early dispersal history of primates in relation to global climate change and eustatic fluctuations in sea level. Here, I describe fossils from the Tuscahoma Formation on the Gulf Coastal Plain of Mississippi documenting an anatomically primitive species of Teilhardina that is older than other North American and European primates. Consistent with its antiquity, a phylogenetic analysis of dental characters recognizes Teilhardina magnoliana, sp. nov., as the most basal member of this genus currently known from either North America or Europe. Its stratigraphic provenance demonstrates that primates originally colonized North America near the base of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), but before an important fall in eustatic sea level. Correlation based on carbon isotope stratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy indicates that the earliest North American primates inhabited coastal regions of the continent for thousands of years before they were able to colonize the Rocky Mountain Interior. The transient provincialism displayed by early North American primates corresponds to similar biogeographic patterns noted among fossil plants. Decreased precipitation in the Rocky Mountain Interior during the early part of the PETM may have been an important factor in maintaining biotic provincialism within North America at this time. These results underscore the need to obtain multiple, geographically dispersed records bearing on significant macroevolutionary events such as the PETM. • Teilhardina • Wasatchian • dispersal • phylogeny • Omomyidae\n\nOxyaenid creodonts are extinct carnivorous mammals known from the Paleogene of North America, Europe, and Asia. The genus Palaeonictis is represented by three species that together span the late Paleocene to early Eocene of North America, and at least one species from the early Eocene of Europe. Previously, only a single trigonid of Palaeonictis was known from the interval encompassing the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) in North America. We describe Palaeonictis wingi sp. nov. from the PETM in the Cabin Fork drainage, southeastern Bighorn Basin, Wyoming, based on associated right and left dentaries with P2-M2. Palaeonictis wingi sp. nov. is substantially smaller than the other North American congeners, making it similar in size to P. gigantea from the earliest Eocene of Europe and the previously described PETM specimen. We suggest that a form similar to the large-bodied late Paleocene P. peloria from North America gave rise to two smaller species in the earliest Eocene of North America (P. wingi) and Europe (P. gigantea). Palaeonictis wingi may have given rise to P. occidentalis following the PETM in North America. Dispersal of Palaeonictis to Europe coincided with rapid global warming of 5–10°C and related geographic range shifts in plants and other animals during the PETM. It has been suggested that certain mammalian lineages decreased in body size during the PETM, possibly in response to elevated temperature and/or higher CO2 levels. Results from a dietary analysis of Palaeonictis indicate that it was an omnivore that primarily consumed meat. This suggests that the decreased nutritious quality of vegetation caused by increased CO2 levels was not the direct contributing factor that caused body size reduction of this lineage during the PETM. Other selective pressures such as temperature, aridity, and prey size may have also contributed to the smaller body size of carnivorous mammals during this interval, although the presence of smaller species could also be explained by latitudinal range shifts of mammals during the PETM.
