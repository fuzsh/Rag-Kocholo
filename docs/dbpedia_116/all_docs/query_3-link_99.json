        "text": "A shopping centre development project brings about a positive change to the community as well as generates a lot of business opportunities which in turn creates more employment and job opportunities for the locals. However, there is no numerical proof regarding employment opportunities generated therefrom. In particular, there was neither assessment nor measurement of employment opportunities generated by a shopping centre development being developed. Therefore, this paper attempts to measure the employment opportunities generated by a proposed shopping centre development project by developing physical parameters for the measurement on the basis of net-lettable area (NLA). A grounded theory method (GTM) is adapted since there is lack of the existing literature on the method or approach of assessment. The GTM with an inductive approach as well as deductive orientation was employed in measuring employment opportunities utilizing data generated from the constant comparative method (CCM). Thus, a CCM-GTM is adopted and six operational shopping centres in Johor Bahru are selected as a comparable group, called CG6. The data of CG6 were constantly compared for their commonalities and variations, thus the trace out to the emerging pattern are found. This study conceptualized the theory of employment generation and derived the employment density equation from a set of employment quotients (EQ). Besides, this paper presented an ideal figure of retail mix classes existing within a shopping centre together with its percentages distribution placement.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to identify the main image attributes determining shopping centre selection in Lithuania. By applying Pajuodis (2005) statement that shoppers select a shopping centre by its image and the models of Sit, Merrilees & Birch (2003), Wong, Lu, Yuan (2001), Gonzalez-Hernandes & Orozco-Gomez (2012) and Singh & Sahay (2012) this paper develops suggestions of what shopping centre image attributes should be emphasized in shopping centre promotional campaigns and how to improve the perceptions of shopping centre patrons of the overall centre image. The theory part of the paper uses systemic and comparative scientific literature analysis. Based on Lithuanian and foreign authors' scientific works, the paper analyses image attributes that influence the selection of the shopping centre as a place for shopping and leisure. An empirical study was conducted applying a quantitative method for data collection – a survey. After generalising theoretical shopping centre image aspects, attributes that represented the shopping centre image was identified. A review of the retailing literature reveals several attributes in shopping centre image studies: merchandising, accessibility, service, facilities, atmosphere, amenities, ambulance, entertainment, security and other. An empirical study indicates main shopping centre image attributes in the Lithuanian market in particular. The type of the article: Research paper.\n\nFocuses upon shopping centre developments through joint venture enterprises. By adapting the process proposed by Churchill to develop measures of marketing constructs, an instrument to assess perceived attractiveness of joint venture shopping centres in China is formulated. The proposed instrument (SCATTR) contains 21 attributes in five dimensions and exhibits high internal consistency and validity. The purpose of this instrument is to provide China’s joint venture shopping centres with an indication of their performance as well as an avenue to gain more knowledge about consumers in China. Concludes that the SCATTR instrument is a reliable and valid tool to assess the attractiveness and performance of shopping centres as perceived by consumers."
