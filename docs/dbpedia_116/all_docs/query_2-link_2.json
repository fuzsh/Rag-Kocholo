        "text": "Bus arrival/departure locations at terminals\n\nYour bus will always depart from its designated location at the terminal - this way you always know where to catch it. However, upon arrival at the terminal, buses may occasionally drop you off at a different stop on the platform other than the one you are currently riding. This may position you closer to, or farther from, your desired connection. Have no fear, your connection will not leave without you, our operators do not leave the terminal until the platform is clear of customers.\n\nWhy does this happen? in order to increase operational efficiencies, buses are often assigned to more than one route in one day - it's called interlining, and a common practice in the transit industry. Interlining allows for the effective use of buses, as well as providing our operators with a bit of variety in their day.\n\nStops east of 50 street\n\nWhile to access these stops you need to ride commuter Route 411, all stops east of 50 street in Edmonton are still considered local Strathcona County stops. Fares to travel to these destinations will be charged accordingly depending on what direction you are travelling. Don't forget to tap-on and tap-off.\n\nBethel Transit Terminal routes\n\nAll local routes connect to commuter routes travelling to Edmonton at Bethel Transit Terminal."
