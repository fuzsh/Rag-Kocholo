Does that still work in the new normal?,” Thomas Pacy, a Dillion Consultant representative and transit planning lead for this project told council at the Council Priorities Committee meeting on Tuesday, Sept. 12. “Also, a lot things that were recommended in 2019 have already happened or have started to happen, so we can review those initiatives.”\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdopted in early 2019, the Transit Master Plan document was approved with the direction of planning and transit service delivery within the county for 10 years.\n\nSome highlights of the 2019 TMP included exploring a more cost-effective on-demand services (which has since been implemented), and improved evening service to the University of Alberta and a connection to NAIT. Other action points included cost effective opportunities to improve busing for residents living in the rural areas and the new to provide service in new approved growth areas within the county.\n\nOther major changes since 2019 include:\n\n• The dissolving of the Edmonton Regional Transit Service Commission, which would have seen a streamlined transit service through eight municipalities (not including Strathcona County) within the Capital Region.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n• New growth areas added into the county’s operational responsibility such as Hillshire, Cambrian and Bremner will also have to be analyzed, and,\n\n• The utilization of new zero-emission technology, such as the county’s new hydrogen bus, which is still in its pilot testing phase.\n\nThree more consulting groups will also take one certain focus areas, such as Leading Mobility Consulting will be responsible for post-pandemic recovery and regional services, Trestle Consulting will dive into mobility busing, and Chris MacIsaac Consulting will take the lead on how on-demand is going as well as integrated mobility.\n\nWith the slogan ‘Take part, take transit’, public feedback will be retained during three project engagements until next summer.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nStarting this month and into October, residents, stakeholders, riders will be asked what changes or improved they want, what people want to see from transit in the future, and what is working well. This portion will also identify what changes are needed to accommodate work-life shifts created by the pandemic.\n\nFor the second round of consultations, in February and March 2024, the results of the feedback will be shared along with technical analysis, and draft TMP recommendations will be shared.\n\nFrom September 2024 to March 2024, external stakeholder workshops will be presented both in-person and virtually. County staff will also be involved in those time periods with in-person drop-in with operations at the drivers lounge and virtual check-in meetings with inspectors, drivers, and other Transit staff.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn May to June 2024, a draft TMP will be presented to the public and stakeholders.\n\nFeedback will also funnel through online engagement tools such as the County Voice and public survey during all three rounds.\n\n“It is a very important service for us, so getting feedback is really key,” Mayor Rod Frank noted on Tuesday.\n\nThe reassessment project is expected to last about 18 months and the Transit Master Plan will be finalized by fall 2024 for council’s review and approval. Once approved, it’s projected that the updated TMP will last between a 10 and 20 year window.\n\nlmorey@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/LindsayDMorey\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories\n\nNews Near Sherwood Park"
