Construction is currently underway for the new footbridge which will connect Strathcona County on the east side of the North Saskatchewan River at Township Road 540 to Edmonton at 167 Avenue.\n\nStrathcona County’s open spaces are essential to a healthy and livable community. The County has nearly 2,000 hectares of parks and open spaces, which provide a wide range of experiences, services and resources that many residents rely on for their way of life. To help guide the acquisition, preservation and management of these important spaces, the County is embarking on an exciting journey to create a visionary Open Space Master Plan (OSMP)."
