JOSHI, P. BURLAKOTI & B. BABU\n\nPlant Health Laboratory, Plant and Animal Health Branch, B.C. Ministry of Agriculture and Food Abbotsford Agriculture Centre, 1767 Angus Campbell Road, Abbotsford, BC V3G 2M3 Telephone: (778) 666-0581; Facsimile: (604) 556-3010; E-mail: Vippen.Joshi@gov.bc.ca Web page: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/animals-and-crops/plant-health/plant-health-laboratory\n\nABSTRACT: The British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture and Food (BCMAF) Plant Health Laboratory (PHL) provides diagnoses of diseases and disorders caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and insect pests of agricultural crops grown in British Columbia. The PHL also makes assessments of plant parasitic nematode damage and possible abiotic factors affecting plant health. Between April 12 and Nov. 27, 2022, the PHL received 622 samples including cannabis, Christmas trees, field crops, greenhouse vegetable and floriculture crops, forest nursery seedlings, herbaceous and woody ornamentals, small fruits, tree fruits, nuts, turfgrass and specialty crops for diagnosis. The PHL was closed in the early part of the year (January to April 11th) due to damage to the building caused by floods in the area during November 2021. Sooty bark disease associated with Cryptostroma corticale was detected in Acer pseudoplatanus for the first time in the PHL and is believed to be the first report in B.C.\n\nMETHODS: The BCMAFF Plant Health Laboratory provides diagnoses of diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and insect pests of agricultural crops grown in British Columbia. Samples are submitted to the laboratory by ministry staff, growers, agri-business representatives, crop insurance personnel, municipalities, and master gardeners. Diagnoses were accomplished by visual and microscopic examination, culturing onto microbial media, biochemical identification of bacteria using Microlog® and serological testing of viruses, fungi, and bacteria with micro-well and membrane-based tests such as Agdia’s ImmunoStrip® test or enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). Molecular techniques (polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- conventional and/or real time) were used for some genus level and species-specific diagnoses. General primer PCRs (for fungi, virus, and bacteria) were followed by sequencing to identify the organism involved. Some specimens were referred to other laboratories for identification or confirmation of the diagnosis.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Overall in 2022, British Columbia had mild winter weather conditions in January followed by mild temperatures and lots of rain. The long, mild, wet spring was normal for B.C., and was followed by a long dry summer starting in late June. Fire blight incidence was higher than usually seen in tree fruit, as well as woody ornamental crops. Sooty bark disease associated with Cryptostroma corticale was detected in Acer pseudoplatanus for the first time in the PHL. It was reported on the same host in Pullman, WA in 1968 (https://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20l?id=BPI421908) but this is believed to be the first report in B.C.\n\nSummaries of diseases and their causal/ associated agents diagnosed on crop samples submitted to the laboratory are presented in to , organized by crop category. Between April 12 and Nov. 27, 2022, the PHL received 622 samples for diagnosis. Crop categories comprising most of the samples in 2022 included berry crops (27.81%), followed by cannabis (22.34%), field vegetables (15.59%), woody ornamentals (12.54%), and tree fruit and grape (4.46%). All other crop categories comprised a combined 17.26% of the total submissions. Diagnoses not listed include abiotic disorders caused by suspected nutritional stress, pH imbalance, water stress, drought stress, adverse growing/cultural conditions, genetic abnormalities, environmental and chemical stresses including damage from herbicides, fruit abortion due to lack of pollination, insect-related injury, or damage where no conclusive causal factor was identified. More than one disease-causing agent was identified on many samples and are listed under individual disease/symptom. The frequency of diseases diagnosed in the lab does not necessarily reflect their prevalence in the field in B.C.\n\nDISEASES DIAGNOSED ON BERRY, VEGETABLE AND ORNAMENTAL NURSERY AND LANDSCAPE PLANTS SUBMITTED TO ELMHIRST DIAGNOSTICS & RESEARCH, BRITISH COLUMBIA, IN 2022\n\nCROP: Diagnostic Laboratory Report LOCATION: British Columbia NAME AND AGENCY: J. F. ELMHIRST\n\nElmhirst Diagnostics & Research, 5727 Riverside St., Abbotsford, BC V4X 1T6 Telephone: 604-832-9495; E-mail: janice.elmhirst@shaw.ca\n\nABSTRACT: Diseases of berry, vegetable, ornamental nursery and landscape plants in south coastal British Columbia submitted to Elmhirst Diagnostics & Research in 2022 and causal agents are listed. In April -May, cold, wet soils led to nutrient deficiency symptoms on foliage and cool, rainy weather through June led to high levels of botrytis in berries and many other crops. This was followed by hot, dry weather from July-September causing heat and drought stress on many crops and landscape plants. Powdery mildew was severe on many nursery and landscape plants, such as big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum). No significant new diseases were observed.\n\nMETHODS: Elmhirst Diagnostics & Research (EDR) provides diagnosis of diseases of commercial horticultural crops in British Columbia caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, plant parasitic nematodes, arthropod and mite pests as well as abiotic factors. Laboratory diagnostic services are provided in conjunction with on-site diagnostic consultations. Diagnosis is performed primarily by association of known symptoms with the presence of a pathogen known to cause these symptoms and identified by microscopic examination. If further identification or confirmation is needed, fungal and bacterial pathogens are isolated in pure culture for further examination of morphological characteristics or plant tissue or cultured specimens are sent to other laboratories for identification by ELISA, PCR or DNA sequencing. Problems caused by abiotic factors are not listed. The frequency of diseases diagnosed does not necessarily reflect their prevalence in the field.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: A summary of disease diagnoses and causal or associated agents on ornamental nursery and landscape crops is presented in and berry and vegetable crops in . The spring and early summer of 2022 was cold and wet. In April-May, nutrient deficiency symptoms such as yellowing and reddening of foliage were observed on many nursery and landscape ornamentals, due to the cold temperatures. Cool, wet weather continued through to the end of June, resulting in a high level of botrytis blight on berries and many other crops. This was followed by hot, dry weather from July to September, causing leaf burn and dieback from heat and drought stress on many crops and landscape plants. Severe powdery mildew was observed in the fall on many nursery and landscape plants, including big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum Pursh). No significant new diseases were observed.\n\nDISEASES/SYMPTOMS DIAGNOSED ON PLANT SAMPLES SUBMITTED TO THE ALBERTA PLANT HEALTH LAB (APHL) IN 2022\n\nCROP: All Crops – Plant Health Laboratory Report\n\nLOCATION: Alberta\n\nNAMES AND AGENCY:\n\nY. YANG, K. ZAHR, H. FU, A. SARKES, S. XUE & J. FENG\n\nAlberta Plant Health Lab, Alberta Agriculture and Irrigation, Edmonton, AB T5Y 6H3 Telephone: (780)-644-3436; E-mail: Jie.Feng@gov.ab.ca\n\nABSTRACT: The Alberta Plant Health Lab (APHL) provides plant pest diagnosis and expertise to Alberta’s agricultural industry. The lab accepts samples exclusively from agricultural fieldmen, academic institutions, applied research associations and municipal pest management departments, at no cost. A total of 644 samples were processed for diagnosis in year 2022 (up to Oct 31). No Dutch elm disease was identified in elm tree samples this year. Needle cast pathogens still accounted for largest portion of the conifer samples received. No fusarium head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum was detected in cereals. Clubroot was found in canola samples. The fire blight pathogen, Erwinia amylovora, was detected on a mayday tree (Prunus padus).\n\nMETHODS: Samples were submitted to APHL by agricultural fieldmen, academic institutions, applied research associations and municipal pest management departments. Diagnoses were based on a combination of visual examination of symptoms and signs, microscopic observation, culturing on artificial media, PCR/qPCR, DNA barcoding and use of commercial diagnostic kits. Fungal barcoding was performed by sequencing DNA fragments of internal transcribed spacers (ITS) (White et al. Citation1990) and/or elongation factor -1α (EF1) (Stielow et al. Citation2015) and/or β-tubulin (Stukenbrock et al. Citation2012). Bacteria were usually identified based on DNA sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (Klindworth et al. Citation2013) and/or the cpn60 gene (Links et al. Citation2012). The diagnosis of clubroot was done by qPCR according to Zahr et al. (Citation2021). PCR identification of Fusarium graminearum from submitted cultures was performed following methodology from Zuzak et al. (Citation2018). For identification of Fusarium species from plant tissues, protocols described by Demeke et al. (Citation2005) were used. Phytoplasmas were detected by PCR using the primer pairs P1/Tint and R16MF2n/R16MR2n (Smart et al. Citation1996). Confirmation of late blight on potato and tomato was done using the Agdia ImmunoStrip® kit for Phytophthora species (http://www.agdia.com). For diagnosis of all other diseases, when PCR techniques were used, quantitative PCR (qPCR) preceded conventional PCR and probe-based qPCR preceded SYBR™ Green-based qPCR. The primers and protocols were chosen from the most recent literature and verified by APHL using positive and negative controls.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: A total of 644 samples were processed for disease diagnosis between January 1 and October 31, 2022. Pathogens including fungi, oomycetes, protists, bacteria and viruses were identified from 355 samples. More than one potential causal agent was identified in the majority of samples. Summaries of symptoms and associated pathogens diagnosed are presented in to by crop category.\n\nFusarium species were commonly isolated from wheat samples (). However, no F. graminearum was isolated from any of the cereal samples. Thirty-one cereal samples (one oat leaf, 21 wheat grain, six wheat leaf and three barley leaf samples) were diagnosed with bacterial infection associated with Xanthomonas translucens. A phytoplasma, the causal agent of aster yellows disease, was detected in 13 wheat samples. Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus (WSMV) was not detected in any wheat samples. Diaporthe columnaris was found to be associated with one wheat wilting sample. Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV) was detected in an oat sample.\n\nOne hundred and forty-four canola samples (include 116 soil samples) were infected with the clubroot pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae (). Fourteen samples tested positive for the blackleg pathogen, Leptosphaeria maculans. No Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola was detected in 22 samples surveyed and tested for bacterial pod spot (data not shown).\n\nA total of 14 potato tuber samples and one potato plant sample were received this year (). Six potato tuber samples were infected with both powdery scab (Spongospora subterranea) and common scab (Streptomyces scabies). Soft rot (Pectobacterium carotovorum) and pink rot (Phytophthora erythroseptica) were also identified in submitted tuber samples. Curling and stunting caused by a phytoplasma was observed in one potato plant sample.\n\nEight legume samples were received for disease diagnosis this year (). Seven lentil samples had root rot symptoms associated with Rhizoctonia sp., Globisporangium sp., Fusarium sp. and Aphanomyces euteiches. The pathogens Globisporangium sp., F. avenaceum, F. redolens and Diaporthe columnaris were isolated from one lentil wilting sample.\n\nThirty-one elm samples were submitted for Dutch elm disease (DED) testing; however, none of them were positive (). Plenodomus tracheiphilus was identified from most of the diseased elm samples. Other isolated pathogens were Cytospora spp., Granulobasidium vellereum, Didymella glomerata, Phaeobotryon rhois, Botryodiplodia ulmicola and Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens. The fungus Sydowia polyspora, causal agent of needle cast and dieback, was identified in three spruce samples. Other pathogens associated with needle cast and dieback included Cytospora spp., Rosellinia sp., Fusarium avenaceum and Aposphaeria corallinolutea. Fire blight was detected in one mayday tree sample.\n\nForty-two vegetable samples were received for disease diagnosis (). Fusarium spp. were recovered frequently from vegetables with root rot and wilting symptoms. Other pathogens included Rhizoctonia spp., Globisporangium spp., Sclerotinia sp., Botrytis sp., Plectosphaerella cucumerina, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas brassicacearum. Eighteen garlic/onion samples and one parsley sample tested positive for a phytoplasma. Streptomyces scabies, S. turgidiscabies, Fusarium sp. and Globisporangium ultimum were found associated with cankers and lesions on a radish sample.\n\nNeoascochyta spp. were recovered from most brome and timothy samples with leaf spots and lesions (). Other pathogens included Microdochium spp., Botrytis/Sclerotinia sp., Phaeosphaeria sp. and Pyrenophora bromi. Fusarium avenaceum was isolated from one brome sample with a pale seed head. Parastagonospora sp. was isolated from one timothy sample with a dark head. Phoma macrostoma was detected in 20 Canada thistle samples with white colour disease (data not shown).\n\nREFERENCES\n\nDemeke T, Clear RM, Patrick SK, Gaba D. 2005.

Samples received by the laboratory included field crops as well as ornamentals, grasses and trees grown in Manitoba.\n\nMETHODS: The Manitoba Agriculture Crop Diagnostic Centre provides diagnoses and control recommendations for disease problems of agricultural crops, both field and horticultural crop plants. Manitoba Agriculture Crop Industry Branch Specialists, extension and other departmental personnel, farmers, agri-business representatives and the public, submit samples to the laboratory. Diagnostic methods used included visual examination for symptoms, microscopy, moist chamber incubation, culturing onto artificial media (general and pathogen specific), Agdia ImmunoStrips®, ELISA and specific molecular (PCR) testing (out-sourced).\n\nRESULTS: Summaries of diseases diagnosed on plants in different crop categories are presented in to and cover the period from January 1 to December 23, 2022.\n\nDIAGNOSES ON PLANT SAMPLES SUBMITTED TO THE ONTARIO CROPS RESEARCH CENTRE - BRADFORD DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY IN 2022\n\nCROP: Diagnostic Laboratory Report\n\nLOCATION: Bradford/Holland Marsh, Ontario\n\nNAMES AND AGENCY:\n\nT. BLAUEL and M.R. MCDONALD\n\nOntario Crops Research Centre - Bradford, Dept. of Plant Agriculture, University of Guelph, 1125 Woodchoppers Lane, King, ON L7B 0E9Telephone: (905) 775-3783; E-mail: tblauel@uoguelph.ca; Website: https://bradford-crops.uoguelph.ca/\n\nABSTRACT: The Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program provided by the Ontario Crops Research Centre - Bradford (OCRC-B) offers diagnostic services to support the vegetable growers of the Holland Marsh and surrounding area. In 2022, 70 plant samples were submitted to the diagnostic laboratory for identification and management recommendations. The plant samples submitted had symptoms of infectious disease (73%), abiotic disorders (21%) and insect damage (6%).\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: In addition to the scouting and forecasting services provided by the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, the diagnostic laboratory at the Ontario Crops Research Centre - Bradford (OCRC-B), formerly the Muck Crops Research Station, provides diagnostic services and management recommendations for plant diseases, insect feeding damage, abiotic disorders and weeds to vegetable growers in and around the Holland Marsh. In 2022, plant samples were submitted to the OCRC-B diagnostic laboratory by growers, IPM scouts and industry representatives. Diagnosis of plant symptoms and issues involved visual and microscopic assessment and culturing of pathogens on growth media. These samples were analysed in addition to the regular identification and quantification of diseases and insect pests provided by the pest management scouts as part of the IPM program.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The diagnostic laboratory received 70 samples between May 9 and October 13, 2022. Of these, 73% were diagnosed with infectious diseases (51 samples), 21% were diagnosed with an abiotic disorder (15 samples) and 6% with insect issues (4 samples). The percentage of samples submitted comprising each crop is as follows: carrot (44%), onion (39%), celery (11%) and other crops (6%). The 2022 growing season began with good weather conditions for transplanting and seeding. Very minor cases of heat canker occurred in seeded crops in mid-May after a period of hot and dry weather. This was followed by a period of increased precipitation in early June which prolonged seeding of some late seeded carrot fields. Throughout the rest of the season, conditions remained favourable for crop development and conditions for disease development were moderate. Stemphylium leaf blight development on onion was common; however, disease severity remained low to moderate for most fields in the Holland Marsh. Onion downy mildew and botrytis leaf blight were not identified in any onion fields, although spores of each pathogen were found in traps and there were periods of favourable conditions for the diseases during the season. The diseases and/or disorders due to plant pathogens diagnosed on crop samples submitted to the OCRC-B diagnostic laboratory in 2022 are presented in .\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Funding for this work was provided in part by the Bradford Cooperative Storage Ltd., agrochemical companies and growers participating in the Ontario Crops Research Centre - Bradford IPM program.\n\nDISEASES DIAGNOSED ON PLANT SAMPLES SUBMITTED TO THE PLANT DISEASE CLINIC, UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH IN 2022\n\nCROPS: Commercial Crops - Diagnostic Laboratory Report LOCATION: Ontario NAMES AND AGENCY: M.

Les échantillons reçus comprennent des plantes maraîchères (serres et champs), des arbres et arbustes fruitiers, des petits fruits, des grandes cultures et céréales, des plantes à usage industriel, des plantes ornementales herbacées, des plantes fourragères, des arbres et arbustes ornementaux (serres et pépinières) ainsi que des plantes aromatiques et médicinales.\n\nMÉTHODES: Le laboratoire de phytopathologie du LEDP offre des services de diagnostic et de détection des maladies parasitaires aux conseillers agricoles, aux producteurs, aux particuliers et aux instances gouvernementales. Les données présentées ci-dessous concernent les maladies identifiées sur les échantillons de plantes reçus en 2022. Les échantillons reçus font d’abord l’objet d’un examen visuel, généralement suivi d’examens au stéréomicroscope et au microscope photonique. Selon les symptômes observés, un ou plusieurs tests diagnostiques sont réalisés dans le but de détecter ou d’identifier l’agent ou les agents phytopathogènes.\n\nVoici les principaux tests de laboratoire réalisés afin d’appuyer le diagnostic: les nématodes vermiformes sont extraits du sol et des tissus végétaux par la méthode de l’entonnoir de Baermann, tandis que les nématodes à kystes sont extraits du sol à l’aide d’un appareil de Fenwick. Leur identification (au genre et, lorsque possible, à l’espèce) est réalisée par un examen microscopique des caractères morphologiques et par des techniques de biologie moléculaire. Ditylenchus sp. est détecté dans la plante par qPCR. Les champignons et oomycètes sont isolés sur des milieux de culture gélosés et identifiés selon leurs caractéristiques morphologiques et/ou par le séquençage d’un ou de plusieurs gènes. De nombreuses espèces sont détectées dans la plante par des outils de biologie moléculaire (PCR, qPCR). Les bactéries sont isolées sur des milieux de culture gélosés, puis identifiées à l’aide de tests biochimiques BiologR et/ou par le séquençage d’un ou de plusieurs gènes. Comme pour les nématodes et les champignons, certaines espèces de bactéries sont détectées dans la plante par des outils de biologie moléculaire (PCR, qPCR). Les phytoplasmes sont détectés par des techniques de biologie moléculaire (PCR nichée et séquençage d’ADN). Les virus, quant à eux, sont détectés par des tests sérologiques ELISA ou par RT-PCR, PCR ou RT-qPCR. Une liste exhaustive des techniques utilisées est disponible au: https://www.agrireseau.net/documents/Document_87998.pdf\n\nRÉSULTATS ET DISCUSSIONS: Les présentent le sommaire des maladies identifiées sur les échantillons de plantes reçus, quelle que soit leur origine (champ, serre ou entrepôt). Notez que le nombre de maladies rapportées ne correspond pas au nombre d’échantillons réellement reçus et traités durant l’année, puisque plus d’un problème peut être identifié sur un même échantillon (plante reçue) et que le diagnostic de certains cas n’a pas été inclus dans ce rapport. Cela concerne notamment les causes indéterminées, les causes incertaines ou hypothétiques, les détections négatives et les données potentiellement nominatives. Étant donné que les problèmes abiotiques (non parasitaires) diagnostiqués sur les échantillons sont, en majorité, de nature hypothétique, ils ont rarement été cités dans ce rapport; ces diagnostics sont établis en fonction de l’observation des symptômes, du résultat de certains tests de laboratoire et d’informations obtenues à la suite de discussions avec les clients.\n\nREMERCIEMENTS: Les auteurs remercient Marion Berrouard, Jaëlle Falardeau, Bassirou Idrissou-Abdoulaye, Ludovic Jacques, Carlos-Mario Jimenez, Dominic Lafleur, Chantal Malenfant, Carolle Fortin et Annie-Pier Hachey pour leur assistance technique ainsi que les étudiants Paul-Émile Gareau, Mélanie Bluteau, Clovis Tremblay et Jean Lafontaine.\n\nDISEASES DIAGNOSED ON PLANT SAMPLES SUBMITTED TO THE NEW BRUNSWICK DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, AQUACULTURE AND FISHERIES PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY IN 2022.\n\nCROP: Diagnostic Laboratory Report\n\nLOCATION: New Brunswick\n\nNAMES AND AGENCY: M.T.

CLARK\n\nPEI Department of Agriculture and Land, PEI Analytical Laboratories, Plant Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, 23 Innovation Way, Charlottetown, PE C1E 0B7 Telephone: (902) 368-5261; Facsimile: (902) 368-6299; Email: mmclark@gov.pe.ca Web page: https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/information/agriculture-and-land/pei-analytical-laboratories-peial\n\nABSTRACT: The Plant Disease Diagnostic (PDD) Laboratory section of PEI Analytical Laboratories, Prince Edward Island Department of Agriculture and Land, provides diagnosis and surveillance of disease problems caused by fungi, bacteria and viruses of commercial crops produced on PEI. In 2022, a total of 184 diagnoses were completed on 97 samples processed. The 2022 potato growing season started with adequate rainfall followed by optimum growing conditions. There were a few potato seed emergence issues caused by Pythium (Globisporangium) ultimum. No potato late blight or pink rot foliar/tuber infections were identified. The fusarium head blight fungus, Fusarium graminearum, was detected in oats. In corn seedlings, both Fusarium sp. and Pythium sp. caused damping-off. Other crops such as apples, fruit crops and cole crops had minimal disease issues, but hurricane Fiona reduced the apple harvest by 80-100% and destroyed approximately 20% of apple trees on the island.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: Samples for disease diagnosis are submitted to the PDD laboratory by agriculture extension staff, researchers, producers, greenhouse growers, agri-business representatives, crop insurance agents, and the general public. Diagnoses are based on a combination of investigative work, visual examination of symptoms, microscopic observations, and culturing onto selective media. When additional confirmation is necessary, culture samples may be sent to other laboratories with producer’s consent for identification of associated pathogens by other means such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: A total of 184 pathogens and/or associated agents were identified on 97 samples submitted from May 26th to October 31st, 2022. A summary of the diagnoses per crop is provided in . The diagnoses reported may not necessarily reflect the major disease problems encountered in the field during the season, but rather those most prevalent within the samples submitted. Categories of samples received were potatoes (42.22%), apples (17.78%), vegetable crops (10.56%), fruit crops (9.44%), cereal crops (8.89%), other crops (7.78%) and cole crops (3.33%).\n\nNo potato late blight infections were reported or identified this season. The level of inoculum was low, and growers continued to carry out improved management practices along with increased spore trapping surveillance. Spore trapping is an important component in disease monitoring and prevention. Weekly updates through the growing season on spore levels for several potato foliar organisms were timely and helped farmers adjust their spray regimes. The last confirmed incidence of late blight was in 2016 with four confirmed cases of US23 genotype.\n\nThere were no pink rot potato tuber samples received this season. The Phytophthora erythroseptica (pink rot) metalaxyl-m (Ridomil Gold) fungicide resistance survey conducted by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is now completed. With the farmer’s permission, the Plant Disease Diagnostic Laboratory submitted 95 isolates for fungicide resistance testing from 2013 to 2021. This resulted in one metalaxyl moderately-resistant (MMR) strain found in the ‘Prospect’ variety in 2013, 14 isolates were found to be metalaxyl highly-resistant (MHR) in varieties of ‘NorValley’, ‘Prospect’, ‘Goldrush’ and ‘Superior’ in 2014 and no metalaxyl-resistant strains identified in 2015 and 2016.\n\nIn recent years, the level of pink rot infections decreased. Varieties that have shown susceptibility to pink rot include ‘Goldrush’, ‘Russet Burbank’, ‘Dakota Pearl’, ‘Prospect’, ‘Superior’ and ‘NorValley’. The use of improved pest management systems and applications of foliar and post-harvest phosphite products help reduce the incidence of infection in storage (Crane Citation2017).\n\nA physiological disorder, “white knot” (WK) or starch deposit, was identified in the ‘Lamoka’ potato variety (). This disorder expresses as an internal hard, white lump in the tuber flesh a few millimetres below the periderm on the stolen or basal end of a tuber. When WK occurs, there is a blow or injury to the tuber but not enough for a complete enzymatic melanin reaction. The cells are broken, and larger starch granules are contained in the injured areas to make a white discolouration (Jackson Citation2022). This disorder appears to be more prevalent in seasons when specific gravity is high (Keenan et al. Citation1989).\n\nWhite knot in ‘Lamoka’ potato variety.\n\nThere were 32 apple samples submitted this season and diseases identified included black rot, phomopsis canker, diaporthe canker and frog-eye leaf spot. Seven samples of apples and two pear samples were tested for fire blight and all were negative. Botryosphaeria dothidea was isolated from the ‘Honeycrisp’ apple variety. Symptoms included a blackish discolouration on the bark of the rootstock and a purplish lesion just above the graft. Trees exhibited shoot dieback with attached wilted leaves. Other organisms isolated from the tree tissue included Alternaria tenuissima, Nigrospora oryzae and Fusarium oxysporum. Nucleotide sequences were analysed by Dr. Shawkat Ali, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), Kentville, Nova Scotia. This was the first recorded case of Botryosphaeria dothidea isolated from PEI apple trees. Due to hurricane Fiona, apple orchard harvests were reduced by 80 to 100 percent, depending on the area. As well, approximately 20% of PEI’s half-million apple trees were destroyed.\n\nThe fusarium head blight fungus, Fusarium graminearum, was detected in oat seeds.\n\nTen samples of carrot seedlings exhibited a damping-off symptom due to a Pythium species. Alternaria arborescens was isolated in conjunction with other pathogens from one sample of carrot seedlings with damping-off. Molecular analysis by Dr. Jeremy Dettman, AAFC, Ottawa, Ontario confirmed the isolate as A. arborescens, however, it is not known at this point if it is pathogenic (Dettman and Eggertson Citation2022).\n\nPythium spp. were more prevalent this season in several crops due to warm, moist conditions, infected seed and susceptible cultivars. Crops affected included cauliflower, corn, parsnip, lavender, carrots and potato. There were a few potato seed emergence issues caused by Pythium (Globisporangium) ultimum. Pythium spp. coupled with Fusarium spp. infected the seed eyes causing a rot (). Potato varieties with infected seed included ‘Shepody’, ‘Alverstone’, ‘Campagna’, ‘Dakota Russet’ and ‘Goldrush’.\n\nFusarium coeruleum and Pythium sp. infection in eye of ‘Campagna’ seed potato.\n\nDiagnoses were also completed this season on new crops such as lavender and turf grass.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nCrane B. 2017.

Disease assessments were done using two approaches, the first, used for most fields, was based on a 0-9 rating scale where 0 was no disease development in the lower, middle and upper canopy, and 9 was >50% of leaf area diseased in the lower, middle and upper canopy. The second approach for leaf spots assessed by AAFC Beaverlodge and Lacombe, OC Lacombe and AAI Brooks involved rating penultimate leaf samples for percentage leaf area diseased. Ratings for other diseases were based on incidence and/or presence or absence, especially where only trace levels were found. Overall, leaf disease levels were higher than those in 2021. Stripe rust was observed in three fields in 2022, while loose smut was only noted in 11 fields, and suspected bacterial leaf streak was observed in 18 fields.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: A survey to document diseases of barley was conducted in 91 fields across Alberta from July 19 - August 18, 2022, with evaluations being done at the flowering to hard dough stage. The fields were typically traversed in a diamond pattern starting at least 25 m in from the field edge, with visual assessments made at each of five locations that were at least 25 m apart. Disease symptoms at each sampling point were rated for leaf spot severity using a 0-9 scale modified from Saari & Prescott (Citation1975). A rating of 0 was no disease development in the lower, middle and upper canopy, and 9 was >50% leaf area diseased in the lower, middle and upper canopy. In addition, the penultimate leaves were collected from 90 fields and leaf diseases were rated for percentage leaf area diseased (PLAD) for scald (Rhynchosporium commune), net-form net blotch (Pyrenophora teres f. teres) and other leaf spots (a combination of symptoms due to spot-form net blotch (Pyrenophora teres f. maculata), spot blotch (Cochliobolus sativus), and physiological leaf spotting). Other diseases (loose smut, stripe rust, bacterial leaf streak, and root rots where stunting and/or premature ripening of plants occurred and were associated with root or stem base symptoms) were rated based on incidence and/or presence or absence, especially where only trace levels were found. Following the survey, a representative tissue sub-sample of diseased plant parts collected at each location was cultured in the laboratory for pathogen isolation and identification.\n\nAn additional 32 fields were surveyed by AAFC Lethbridge. Data were collected at 10 sites in each field in a “W” pattern separated by 25 m. The severity of leaf spot and bacterial blight diseases was rated using a scale of 0 to 9 adopted from Saari & Prescott (Citation1975). Based on the disease severity level, fields were classified as clean (0), light (0.1-3.9), intermediate (4.0-5.9) or severe (6.0-9.0). Based on the disease incidence, fields infections were classified as clean (0%), light (1-33%), intermediate (34-66%), or severe (67-100%).\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Survey results are presented in and for the 0-9 rating scale and PLAD on 91 and 90 fields, respectively. Based on the 0-9 assessments, scald (R. commune) was present in 49 of 91 fields. Thirty-six of those fields had low levels, with ratings from 0-3, another 11 fields had levels of 4-6, while two fields had higher levels of 7-9 on the 0-9 rating scale (). Net-form net blotch (P. teres f. teres) was found in 42 of 91 fields with 32 fields having low levels with ratings of 0-3 and another 10 fields with levels of 4-6 (0-9 scale). Other leaf spots were found in 53 of 91 fields with 36 of those fields having ratings of 0-3 and another 17 fields having ratings of 4-6 (0-9 scale).\n\nBased on PLAD assessments of the penultimate leaf samples, scald was absent in 62 fields, but was present in 28 of 90 fields. Nineteen of those fields had low levels, with ratings of 1-3, another three fields had ratings of 4-10, four fields had ratings of 11-19 and two fields had 21- 25 PLAD (). Net-form net blotch was found in 17 of 90 fields with 11 of those fields having low PLAD from 1-3, four fields having levels of 4-10, one field having 12 and another having 33 PLAD. Other leaf spots were found in 78 of 90 fields with 50 of those fields having low PLAD from 1-3, 17 fields having 3-10, four fields having 11-19 and one field having 23 PLAD. These other leaf spots were identified in the laboratory from 70 fields and Cochliobolus sativus, the causal agent of spot blotch, was isolated from 21 fields, while P. teres f. maculata (spot-form net blotch) was isolated from 13 fields. The saprophytic fungi Alternaria spp. and Epicoccum spp. were isolated from 70 and 43 of the 70 fields, respectively. The presence of these saprophytes is often associated with dead plant tissues due to physiological issues, abiotic factors such as hail, and disease related damage. In one field the penultimate leaves were too senesced to rate.\n\nLoose smut (Ustilago nuda) in barley was found at trace levels in 12 of the 91 surveyed fields, while one field had moderate levels.\n\nThree fields with trace levels of stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis) were found among the 91 commercial barley fields surveyed. Trace levels of bacterial leaf streak were found in 26 fields, while 13 fields had trace to moderate levels of root rot. No ergot was observed in any of the 91 fields.\n\nIn total, nine (28.1%) barley fields were rated as clean (). Leaf spots were the most prevalent foliar diseases among all barley fields in 2022, with 23 (71.9%) of fields infected. Barley leaf spot infection was light in 17 fields (53.1%); intermediate in two (6.3%) and severe in four (12.5%) of the fields (). Bacterial leaf blight was found in five fields, mainly on two-row barley cultivars in the area of Taber and Lethbridge, and infection was severe ().\n\nOverall, barley leaf disease levels in 2022 were higher than those in 2021, especially in central and northern Alberta (Rauhala et al. Citation2022).\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: The authors would like to acknowledge the support of summer students and collaborating technical staff.

Pyrenophora avenae was found in 26% of the oat crops surveyed and Stagonospora avenae was found in 25% of the oat crops surveyed. In barley, Cochliobolus sativus was the most prevalent pathogen, found in 28% of the crops surveyed.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: In 2022, 35 oat crops and 25 barley crops in Saskatchewan were surveyed for leaf spot diseases. The surveys were conducted by the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC) between late July and early August, when the crop was at early milk to soft dough stage. Ten flag leaves were collected from each crop surveyed. Leaf and grain samples from 35 oat spikes and leaf samples, and 25 barley leaf samples were plated for pathogens. Leaves were cut into 1 cm-long pieces for plating. The pieces were sterilized in 70% ethanol and triple-rinsed with sterile distilled water then dried before being plated onto acidified potato dextrose agar. The plates were incubated under light at room temperature and pathogens were identified after four days based on morphology (Zillinsky Citation1983). Kernels were harvested from 30 panicles of oats. The panicles were threshed and kernels sterilized in 5% bleach solution before triple-rinsing with sterile water. The kernels were plated on acidified potato dextrose agar and left for five days under light at room temperature before pathogens were identified according to morphology (Zillinsky Citation1983; Leslie and Summerell Citation2006). Disease prevalence was defined as the percentage of fields affected by each disease out of all fields surveyed.\n\nAdditionally, between July and early August 2022, our group received and collected oat, barley, bread wheat and durum wheat samples from growers, agronomists and researchers in Alberta and Saskatchewan showing typical bacterial symptoms, such as streaky lesions and/or necrotic spots. The plants had been grown with and without irrigation. Bacterial streaming tests were conducted. Leaves and leaf sheaths with lesions were surface sterilized and plated onto two semi-selective media. The plates were incubated at 28-30°C for 48 hrs.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Oat leaf pathogens were identified in 35% of the oat crops surveyed, which was higher than in the previous two years (20% in 2021 and 29% in 2020). This was likely due to the increased precipitation over much of the province in 2022 compared to previous years. The pathogens detected in the oat leaf samples were Pyrenophora avenae (cause of leaf blotch; 26% of the crops surveyed), Stagonospora avenae (cause of septoria leaf blotch; 25% of the crops surveyed), and Cochliobolus sativus (cause of spot blotch; 10% of the crops surveyed) (). In addition to leaf pathogens, Alternaria spp. were detected in 86% of the crops surveyed. In the oat grain samples, three different Fusarium spp. (F. poae, F. avenaceum, and F. graminearum) were identified, all of which are causal agents of fusarium head blight (FHB) (). Prevalence (% of fields surveyed with each pathogen) was 54.3%, 6%, and 20%, respectively, which was higher than last year. In 2021, the prevalence of F. poae, F. avenaceum and F. graminearum was 43%, 13%, and 10%, respectively. Two saprophytes, Alternaria spp. and Epicoccum spp. were also detected, with a prevalence of 100% and 85%, respectively. In the bacteria-infected oat samples, white colonies compatible with Pseudomonas spp. were frequently observed in culture.In barley, leaf pathogens were identified in 11 (44%) of the 25 crops surveyed. Cochliobolus sativus (the cause of spot blotch) was identified in 28% of the crops surveyed; Fusarium spp. were identified in 24% of the crops surveyed; and Pyrenophora teres f. teres (the cause of net blotch) was observed only in 8% of the crops surveyed (). Two saprophytes, Alternaria spp. and Epicoccum spp. were also detected, with a prevalence of 100% and 36%, respectively. Furthermore, a number of locations scouted across Saskatchewan presented a high incidence of barley stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei).In the bacteria-infected barley, bread wheat and durum wheat samples, the colonies obtained were compatible with Xanthomonas translucens, the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak and bacterial black chaff (Duveiller et al. Citation1997). A molecular test using LAMP confirmed this bacterium to be the causal agent in 80% of the cases.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: This survey was supported by the leaf samples submitted by the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation.

WANG\n\nMorden Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 101 Route 100, Morden, MB R6M 1Y5 Telephone: (204) 822-7530; Facsimile: (204) 822-7507; E-mail: mitali.banik@agr.gc.ca\n\nABSTRACT: In Manitoba, 40 barley and 44 oat fields were assessed for leaf spot diseases in 2022. The severity of leaf spot diseases in these fields was higher than that reported in 2021, partially due to wet weather conditions during the growing season, which favoured infection by leaf spot pathogens. Cochliobolus sativus (spot blotch) and Pyrenophora teres (net blotch) were the principal pathogens found in both barley and oat fields.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: A field survey was conducted in Manitoba from July 18-August 5, 2022, to assess barley and oat leaf spot diseases. A total of 40 barley fields and 44 oat fields were surveyed. The fields were chosen based on crop availability and were located within the area bounded by Highways #s 67, 16 to the north, 12 to the east, 3 to the south, 8 to the north and 83 to the west. The fields were sampled at regular intervals, approximately 20-25 km apart, along the survey routes. The survey was conducted when most crops were at the early- to soft-dough stages of growth (ZGS 79-82, Zadoks et al. Citation1974). The fields were traversed in a diamond pattern, starting at least 25 m from the field edge. The severity of the diseases was visually assessed on ten penultimate leaves at each of five locations, spaced at least 25 m apart. The average disease severity was classified into six categories: none (no visible symptoms), trace (<1%), very slight (1-5%), slight (6-15%), moderate (16-40%) and severe (41-100%).\n\nSubsequently, ten pieces of putatively infected leaf tissues from each field were surface sterilized in a 5% bleach (NaOCl) solution for 1 min, then rinsed three times in sterile distilled water, dried and placed on water agar. Surface-sterilized pieces of infected leaves also were incubated on filter paper in moist chambers for 3-5 days to promote sporulation to identify the causal agent(s) of leaf spot disease(s).\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS:\n\nBarley - Out of 40 barley fields surveyed, visual leaf spot disease symptoms (from trace to severe) were observed in 29 fields (72.5%). The severity of leaf spot diseases was trace in eight fields (20.0%), very slight in eight fields (20.0%), slight in 11 fields (27.5%), and moderate in two fields (5.0%) ().\n\nCochliobolus sativus (the causal agent of spot blotch) was isolated from 33 fields (an incidence of 82.5%). Pyrenophora teres (the causal agent of net blotch) was isolated from 11 fields (an incidence of 27.5 %). Septoria passerinii (the causal agent of speckled leaf blotch) was isolated from two fields (an incidence of 5%). C. sativus was the predominant barley leaf spot pathogen with an isolation frequency of 89.8%, followed by P. teres (9.5%) and S. passerinii (0.7%). The incidence and frequency of C. sativus in 2022 were higher than those reported in 2019, 2020, and 2021. The incidence of P. teres in 2022 was similar to that in 2019, 2020 and 2021 (Beyene et al. 2020, 2021, 2022), but its frequency of isolation was much lower than in the previous three years ().\n\nOat - Out of 44 oat fields surveyed, visual leaf spot disease symptoms (from trace to severe) were observed in 40 fields (90.9%). The severity of leaf spot diseases was trace in 31 fields (70.5%), very slight in eight fields (18.2%), and moderate in one field (2.3%) ().\n\nC. sativus (the causal agent of spot blotch) and P. avenae (the causal agent of net blotch) were the two pathogens most frequently isolated from oat leaves. The incidence and isolation frequency of C. sativus was 13.6% and 44.4%, respectively, similar to those reported in 2021 (Beyene et al. 2022). P. avenae was found in 13.6% of fields with an isolation frequency of 44.5%, lower than that reported in 2021 (). Leaf spots caused by Stagnospora avenae were observed also, but at a much lower level than C. sativus and P. avenae.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nBanik M, Beyene M, Wang X. 2020.

WANG\n\nMorden Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 101 Route 100, Morden, MB R6M 1Y5 Telephone: (204) 822-7530; Facsimile: (204) 822-7507; E-mail: xiben.wang@agr.gc.ca\n\nABSTRACT: In 2022, 40 barley and 44 oat fields in Manitoba were surveyed for fusarium head blight (FHB) to assess disease severity and identify the Fusarium species causing FHB. In barley, the mean FHB Index was 1.79, which was higher than the ten-year average of 0.92 (2011 to 2021). In oat, Fusarium infections were detected in 97% of fields. F. poae was the predominant Fusarium species in commercial barley and oat fields, followed by F. sporotrichioides and F. graminearum. Infections caused by F. equiseti and F. avenaceum were detected in both crops but at low levels only.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: In 2022, the incidence and severity of fusarium head blight (FHB) in Manitoba was assessed by surveying a total of 84 fields, 40 of which were barley fields and 44 were oat fields. The survey was carried out from July 18-August 5, when most crops were at the early- to soft-dough stages of crop growth (ZGS 79-82, Zadoks et al. Citation1974). Fields were sampled at regular intervals, approximately 20-25 km along survey routes, depending on crop availability. The areas sampled were bounded by Highways #s 67, 16 to the north, 12 to the east, 3 to the south, 8 to the north and 83 to the west. The fields were traversed in a diamond pattern starting at least 25 m from the field edge. FHB incidence (the percentage of spikes showing typical FHB symptoms) and severity (the percentage of infected kernels in each spike) were assessed in each of the fields by sampling 95-110 spikes at five locations, 25 m apart, and then averaging the scores. The mean FHB Index [(FHB severity x FHB incidence)/100] was estimated for each barley field.\n\nFifty kernels from each field were randomly selected, surface-sterilized for 90 s in 0.3% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed twice with distilled water, and then dried for 5 min at the room temperature. The sterilized kernels were then placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA, 25% strength) + streptomycin media plates. The Fusarium species isolated were identified by microscopic examination and morphological characterization following Leslie and Summerell (Citation2006). The isolation frequency was calculated as (the number of isolations of each Fusarium spp./ total number of isolations of all Fusarium spp.) x 100.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS:\n\nBarley - Visual FHB symptoms were observed in 100% of the surveyed barley fields. The incidence of FHB in barley ranged from 2% to 63.6%, with a provincial mean of 18.2%. The severity of FHB in barley (mean percentage of infected kernels per spike) ranged from 3% to 20%, with a provincial mean of 7.5%. The mean FHB Index in 2022 was estimated at 1.79, which was higher than the ten-year average of 0.92 (2011 to 2021).\n\nF. poae was the most frequently isolated Fusarium species from grain samples, found in 100% of fields surveyed and 18.1% of kernels. F. sporotrichioides and F. graminearum were also common. F. sporotrichioides was isolated from 60.5% of fields and 2.7% of kernels. F. graminearum was isolated from 29.0% of fields and 1.3% of kernels. F. avenaceum and F. equiseti were isolated from grain samples also, but at a very low level. F. poae had the highest isolation frequency (79.6%), followed by F. sporotrichioides (12.1%), F. graminearum (5.8%), F. equiseti (1.4%), and F. avenaceum (1.2%) ().\n\nOat - Typical symptoms of FHB were observed in 68% of the oat fields surveyed. F. poae was the most frequently isolated Fusarium species from grain samples, found in 97.7% of fields surveyed and 21.1% of kernels. F. sporotrichioides was isolated from 50.0% of fields and 1.5 % of kernels. F. graminearum was isolated from 25.0% of fields and 0.7% of kernels. F. avenaceum and F. equiseti were isolated at a very low level. F. poae had the highest isolation frequency (86.7%), followed by F. sporotrichioides (6.2%), F. graminearum (3.0%), F. equiseti (3.0%), and F. avenaceum (1.1%) ().\n\nREFERENCES\n\nLeslie JF, Summerell BA. 2006.

ABOUKHADDOUR\n\nLethbridge Research and Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 5403 1st Ave. S, Lethbridge, AB T1J 4B1 Telephone: (403) 317-2222; Facsimile: (403) 382-3156; E-mail: reem.aboukhaddour@agr.gc.ca\n\nABSTRACT: During the 2022 growing season, the lack of stripe rust infection in southern Alberta was remarkable. A total of 120 commercial fields were surveyed, consisting of 32 barley and 88 wheat fields of which 65 were spring wheat and 23 were winter wheat. No stripe rust was reported. However, other diseases such as fungal leaf spots and bacterial leaf blight were reported. Bacterial leaf blight was reported in five barley and one wheat field near the Vulcan area; infection was severe in barley but very low on wheat. Leaf spots were found in 23 barley fields and 28 wheat fields. The most severe leaf spot infection on barley was found in Lethbridge, with a severity rating of over 70%. On wheat, leaf spots were reported in the majority of surveyed fields but were rated mostly as intermediate or light in severity. High temperatures and dry summer conditions may have hindered development of stripe rust this summer.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: Commercial cereal fields, including winter and spring wheat and barley, were surveyed in southern Alberta from early July to early August, 2022. In total, 120 cereal fields were surveyed for stripe rust and leaf spot incidence and severity. Data were collected from 32 barley fields and 88 wheat fields, consisting of 65 spring wheat and 23 winter wheat fields. The survey covered fields from Kimball south to Vulcan north, and Pincher Creek west to Foremost east. Fields were evaluated for disease severity and incidence. Data were collected at 10 sites in each field in a “W” pattern, with each site separated by 25 m. The severity of leaf spot and bacterial blight diseases was rated using a scale of 0 to 9, adopted from Saari & Prescott (Citation1975). Based on the disease severity level, fields were classified as clean (0), light (0.1-3.9), intermediate (4.0-5.9) or severe (6.0-9.0). Based on the disease incidence, infected fields were classified as clean (0%), light (1-33%), intermediate (34-66%), or severe (67-100%).\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: In total, 120 commercial fields were surveyed, consisting of 88 wheat fields and 32 barley fields (, ). Among all fields, no stripe rust infection was reported (). In total, 41 (63.1%) spring wheat fields, 17 (73.9%) winter wheat fields, and nine (28.1%) barley fields were rated as clean (0%) (). Leaf spot was the most prevalent foliar disease among cereal fields this summer; 22 (33.8%) spring wheat fields, six (26.1%) winter wheat fields, and 23 (71.9%) barley fields were infected. Wheat fields were rated as light to intermediate for leaf spots and there was no report of severe disease (). However, in barley, leaf spot disease was light in 17 (53.1%); intermediate in two (6.3%) and severe in four (12.5%) of the fields (). Bacterial leaf blight was found mainly on two-row barley cultivars in the area of Taber and Lethbridge. The disease was severe on the barley but, only one wheat field was reported with a very light infection (). The absence of stripe rust in 2022 in comparison to other years (), probably reflects the absence of favourable environmental conditions for infection, as there should be no shortage of inoculum coming from the Pacific Northwest regions of the USA, given the level of infection in the US.\n\nMap showing surveyed fields in Alberta in 2022.

FETCH & M. PENNER\n\nMorden Research & Development Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 101 Route 100, Morden, MB R6M 1Y5 Telephone: (204) 822-7585, Facsimile: (204) 822-7556, E-mail: taye.zegeye-gebrehiwot@agr.gc.ca\n\nABSTRACT: Field surveys for stem rust on wheat, barley and oat were conducted in Manitoba in 2021. Some stem rust samples from cultivated oats and wheat were brought in from Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec. Two pustules from each sample were pathotyped on standard differentials. As in previous years, of the 19 viable wheat stem rust samples, the dominant race was race QFCSC at 90%. One race from Ontario (RTHSF) and another from Saskatchewan (MCCFC) were also identified. For oat, several races were identified, with the dominant race being TGN at 48%, followed by SGB, TGD and TJS with 14%, 11% and 10%, respectively. Other races with low frequencies (0.6% to 3.7%) were identified, also. The two viable samples from Saskatchewan (four pustules) were both race SGB, while of the three viable samples from Ontario, five pustules (including four from trap plots) typed out to race TDJ and the sixth was race TJJ. None of the samples from Quebec were viable.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: In 2021, a stem rust survey was conducted in Manitoba from late August to the third week of September on wheat, barley and oat. At the time the survey was conducted, most commercial fields were mature, with no stem rust infection. Hence, infected samples were collected mainly from wild oats (Avena fatua L.) and wild barley [Hordeum spontaneum (K. Koch) Thell.] in ditches and beside cultivated fields. Samples from trap nurseries where no fungicide was applied were also collected both from eastern and western Canada. A total of 57 wheat and 112 oat samples were collected from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec. Two single pustules from each sample were recovered to assess severity of stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici Erikss. & E. Henn. and P. graminis Pers. f. sp. avenae Erikss. & E. Henn.) and determine the virulence dynamics in each pathogen population. Rust spores (urediniospores) were recovered from the rust-infected samples by increasing them on susceptible hosts (McNair for wheat and barley and Pc94 for oats). Races were pathotyped using the standard wheat and oat differential sets (Fetch and Jin 2007; Fetch et al. Citation2018). Urediniospores from wild barley was put on wheat differential sets to pathotype.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Urediniospores blown from south of the border arrive in the eastern prairies of Canada late in the summer. Commercial fields can escape infection if seeded early, where the field situation permits. In addition, most fields are sprayed with fungicides. The eastern prairie region was very dry in 2021, which was not conducive to rust development. Therefore, as in 2019 and 2020, stem rust infection was very light (Fetch et al. Citation2021).\n\nOat - Of the 224 pustules tested from the 112 oat samples collected in Manitoba, only 161 were viable (). About two-thirds of the races were obtained from wild oats, while the remaining third were from cultivated oats. In 2021, the dominant race of P. g. avenae stem rust was TGN at 48%, followed by SGB (14%), TGD (11%), and TJS (10%) (). Another nine races (SGD, TGS, TGB, TJB, TJN, TGL, TGG, TJD and TJJ) were detected at a low frequency (0.06% to 3.7%). The two samples that were collected from cultivated oats in Saskatchewan were both race SGB (four pustules), while the three samples from Ontario typed out as races TDJ (five pustules) and TJJ (one pustule) (data not shown). None of the samples from Quebec were viable.\n\nWheat and Barley - Of the 57 wheat stem rust samples only 19 pustules were viable (17 from MB, 1 from SK, 1 from ON and 0 from Quebec). Of the 19 viable P. g. tritici samples, 17 isolates were classified as race QFCSC, with one isolate of race MCCFC from Saskatchewan and one of race RTHSF from Ontario. The QFCSC race occurred at equal frequency in both wheat trap plots and wild barley. The Saskatchewan and Ontario races were both recovered from wheat trap plots. Of the 19 wheat races (mostly QFCSC) eight of them came from wild barley, one was from cultivated barley and the remaining 10 were from cultivated wheat from ON, SK and MB.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFetch TG Jr, Jin Y. 2007.

A total of 2460 wheat, 869 durum, 885 barley, and 373 oat samples were reported. Compared to 2020, combined frequency for F. graminearum-free samples increased from 66.5% to 95.6% and mean percent infection rates were down from 1.5% to 0.9%. Total Fusarium spp. frequency and severity decreased significantly compared to that reported in 2020.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: Test results from four seed testing laboratories were acquired and combined. The tests were conducted from September of 2021 through May 2022 and are assumed to be from the 2021 crop. These tests were conducted by either agar-plating or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. In the case of PCR tests, the presence or absence of DNA of all Fusarium spp. or of F. graminearum allowed calculation of percent infection. No attempt was made to select fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK) so the samples can be considered random. The percent frequency of all Fusarium spp. including F. graminearum (total Fusarium), and the percent frequency of F. graminearum alone, were calculated. The mean percent infection was calculated for both total Fusarium spp. and F. graminearum. Individual Fusarium spp. other than F. graminearum were not reported, as not all labs provided that information. The results of 4587 tests were combined, reported by Saskatchewan crop district and provincial means determined.\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS: Despite favourable spring seeding conditions, extremely hot and dry weather impacted crop development during the growing season. Warm and dry conditions throughout the fall provided farm operators the opportunity to complete harvest well ahead of the normal timeframe. Because of challenging growing conditions, several of the major field crops experienced their largest year-over-year decrease on record, falling to levels not seen in more than a decade (Statistics Canada Citation2021.)\n\nCereal yields were below 10-year averages (Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture 2020). The average wheat yield was 30 bu/acre compared to the 10-year average of 41 bu/acre. Durum yield was 19 bu/acre compared to the 10-year average of 38 bu/acre. Average barley yield was 34 bu/acre, down significantly from the 10-year average of 61 bu/acre. Oat yield was 49 bu/acre, also down from the 10-year average of 83 bu/acre.\n\nA total of 2460 wheat, 869 durum, 885 barley and 373 oat samples were processed during the period covered by this report. This represented a decrease in durum samples (5.7%) and an increase in oat (25.6%), wheat (26.2%) and barley (8.7%) samples compared to 2020 (Olson et al. Citation2021).\n\nFusarium graminearum frequency and severity (mean % infection) was calculated for wheat, durum, barley, and oat individually and combined. Frequency and severity of total Fusarium spp. was calculated individually and combined as well ( and ). The frequency of F. graminearum in 2021 was 4.4%. This was significantly lower than the 33.5% reported in 2020 (Olson et al. Citation2022) and below the 2019 level of 40.6% (Olson et al. Citation2021), the 2018 level of 22.0% and the 2017 level of 23.1% (Olson et al. Citation2020b, Citation2020a). The severity of F. graminearum at 0.9% was the lowest level since 2017 (). Total Fusarium frequency was 64.6%, which was below the previous year (). Total Fusarium severity was 2.9%, the lowest level reported since 2017 ().\n\nWheat – The percentage of F. graminearum-free samples in 2021 was 97.2% (), up from the 65.0% reported in 2020 (Olson et al. Citation2022). The mean infection rate was 0.8%, down from the 1.6% reported in 2020. Total Fusarium spp.-free samples were 38.0% compared to 16.4% in 2020. The mean percent infection decreased from 2020 to 2.5%.\n\nDurum – Of the 869 samples, 88.1% were found to be F. graminearum-free. Mean percent infection was 1.0% (). In 2020, the frequency of F. graminearum-free samples was 64.4% and the mean percent infection was 1.8% (Olson et al. Citation2022). The total Fusarium spp.-free frequency was 48.1%, up from the 18.8% reported in 2020 and the mean percent infection was 1.5%, down from 3.4% in 2020.\n\nBarley – The percentage of F. graminearum-free samples was 96.3% in 2021, up from 68.8% in 2020 (Olson et al. Citation2022). Mean infection was 0.7% compared to 1.0% in 2020. Total Fusarium spp.-free samples were 24.4%, up from 14.1% in 2020. The total Fusarium spp. mean infection was 3.1%, down from 4.1% in 2020 ().\n\nOat – Of the 373 samples, 99.7% were found to be F. graminearum-free. This was higher than the 91.2% reported in 2020 (Olson et al. Citation2022). Mean infection was 0.5%, down slightly from 0.6% in 2020. Total Fusarium spp.-free samples were 9.7% up from 5.3% in 2020. The total Fusarium spp. mean infection was 6.5%, down from 7.5% in 2020 ().\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: We would like to acknowledge the cooperation of 20/20 Seed Labs Inc., Lendon Seed Lab, Prairie Diagnostic Seed Lab, and Discovery Seed Labs Ltd. in providing the seed testing results that made this report possible.

The frequencies of detected leaf diseases were anthracnose leaf blight (ALB) 141 (83%), northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) 129 (76%), common rust (CR) 78 (46%), tar spot (TS) 70 (41%), grey leaf spot (GLS) 68 (40%), Physoderma brown spot (PBS) 68 (40%), eyespot 63 (37%), and northern corn leaf spot (NCLS) 37 (22%). Mean severities of 1.8±1.1, 1.5±0.4, 1.4±0.7, 1.4±0.6, 1.2±0.4, 1.2±0.4, 1.2±0.4, and 1.2±0.2 were recorded for NCLB, ALB, TS, CR, eyespot, GLS, NCLS, and PBS, respectively. NCLB caused the most damage with severities ≥ 5 across Ontario and extremely severe disease in Elgin County, along Lake Erie. All 41 hybrids (fields) with NCLB resistant genes showed a resistant lesion-type and had a severity ≤2. Some genotypes had severities ≥4 for TS, CR, GLS and NLS in Ontario Corn Committee trials or seed company demonstration plots. There were 44 (26%) fields with common smut, but only three fields with incidences of 2%, 5%, and 12%; others were <1%. One field was found with low levels of head smut <1%. Ear rot was found in eight fields with incidence <1% which supports the annual OMAFRA Corn Ear Survey. Anthracnose top dieback (ATDB) was found in 141 (83%) of surveyed fields, ranging from 5 - 100%. Stalk rots, including pythium stalk rot and fusarium stalk rot, were found in 44 (26%) fields, 10 of them ranging from 5 – 65%, others <1%. Stewart’s bacterial wilt and Goss’s bacterial wilt were not detected; however, the corn flea beetle, the vector of Stewart’s bacterial wilt was found at one location in Chatham-Kent County.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND METHODS: The annual corn disease survey provides vital information on populations of endemic pathogens and quarantine diseases, such as Goss’s bacterial wilt and blight (Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis) and Stewart’s bacterial wilt (Pantoea stewartii), and allows for scouting of new invasive pathogens like tar spot of corn [Phyllachora maydis Maubl.]. To document the occurrence of various corn diseases across the province, a survey was conducted from September 12th to 16th in Eastern Ontario and September 19th to 24th in Southern and Central Ontario, 2022. The 170 corn fields surveyed, based on GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude), are presented in . Because of severe drought and early harvest in Central and Southern Ontario, fewer seed corn fields in Chatham-Kent and grain/silage corn fields in Waterloo and Wellington counties were surveyed. The diseases surveyed included anthracnose leaf blight (ALB) (Colletotrichum graminicola (Ces.) G.W. Wilson); eyespot [Aureobasidium zeae (Narita & Hiratsuka) Dingley]; grey leaf spot (GLS) (Cercospora zeae-maydis Tehon & E.Y. Daniels); northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) [Exserohilum turcicum (Pass.) K.J. Leonard and E.G. Suggs]; northern corn leaf spot (NCLS) [Bipolaris zeicola (G.L. Stout) Shoemaker]; common rust (CR) (Puccinia sorghi Schwein.); southern rust (P. polyspora Underw.); tar spot, Physoderma brown spot [Physoderma maydis Miyabe (Miyabe)]; common smut [Ustilago maydis (DC.) Corda]; head smut [Sphacelotheca reiliana (Kuhn) G.P. Clinton]; ear rot (Fusarium spp.), stalk rot and anthracnose top dieback (ATDB) (Fusarium spp., Pythium spp., and C. graminicola); Goss’s bacterial wilt and blight, and Stewart’s bacterial wilt.\n\nA rating scale of 1 to 7 based on percent area diseased, where 1 = no disease and 7 = severely diseased, was used for recording disease severity (Reid and Zhu Citation2005). Disease incidence was estimated based on the number of plants with a particular disease symptom for smut, ear rot, and stalk rot. Leaf samples showing typical NCLB symptoms (long, elliptical, 2-15 cm, tan or greyish-green, necrotic lesions) were collected from each field visited for E. turcicum race identification and distribution patterns. Additional symptomatic plant parts were also collected for subsequent laboratory analysis, especially for unknown or suspected Goss’s bacterial wilt, Stewart’s bacterial wilt, and bacterial leaf streak (Xanthomonas vasicola Cobb).\n\nRESULTS AND COMMENTS:\n\nNorthern corn leaf blight (NCLB) was the most common foliar disease in 2022. NCLB was detected in all counties () and in 129 of the 170 surveyed fields, with 7, 60 and 103 fields infected in Central, Eastern and Western Ontario, respectively. shows that fields with severity ≥5 (labeled with a blue circle with a big white center), were scattered throughout Central, Western and Eastern Ontario. There was a wider diseased area in Elgin County, along Lake Erie. In southwestern St. Thomas, >10 km of corn fields along the Lake Erie shoreline had NCLB severity >5, with up to 50-75% diseased leaf areas. NCLB was found in 15 of the 16 OCC 2022 performance trials (), of which two locations (Ridgetown and Wingham) had hybrids with higher severity ratings (≥4). Based on NCLB lesion size, colour and position on the plants, NCLB likely started late in the 2022 growing season, in early September in Eastern Ontario and late August in Southern and Central Ontario. All 41 of 129 (32%) NCLB fields with resistant lesions (genes) had severity <2, even in the area with the most severe disease epidemic. Commercial hybrids with NCLB resistant gene(s) should be used in the historic NCLB epidemic areas, such as corn fields near Lake Huron, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.\n\nTar spot is a recent corn disease, detected for the first time in the United States in Illinois and Indiana in 2015. In 2018, tar spot was detected in Michigan, southern Wisconsin, Ohio, eastern Iowa and Florida (Dalla et al. Citation2019), and in Canada, it was reported late in the 2020 growing season (Tenuta Citation2020). There was a tar spot outbreak in Southern Ontario in 2021 (Hein Citation2022). Although new, tar spot was the second most damaging foliar disease in the survey with an average severity of 1.4±0.7, mainly distributed in eight Southern Ontario counties: Chatham-Kent, Elgin, Essex, Huron, Lambton, Middlesex, Norfolk, and Oxford (). There were 10 fields with severities ranging from 4 to 5, located in Chatham-Kent, Elgin, Huron, and Middlesex (). Of the 10 fields, three were in Elgin and had both severe NCLB and tar spot. Tar spot was found in six out of the 16 OCC 2022 performance trials (), of which two locations (Dresden and Tilbury) had hybrids with higher severity ratings (≥3).\n\nTar spot symptoms appeared on the whole plant (severity ≥4), bottom leaves (severity ≥3), or a single leaf at the bottom or middle of the plant. Hundreds of stroma could be found on one leaf, while other leaves on the same plant were clean. In a very short time, tar spot has become established and overwinters in southwestern Ontario. This local overwintering source, as well as potential air-borne inoculum from the U. S. Midwest (especially Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin), and historical end of season maps showing the spread of tar spot in the U. S. from 2015 to 2022 (https://corn.ipmpipe.org/tarspot/historical-end-of-season-maps/), suggest that tar spot will have an annual impact in the province of Ontario.\n\nAnthracnose leaf blight (ALB) was the most common foliar disease, found in 141 (83%) of surveyed corn fields with an average severity of 1.5±0.4 in all Ontario counties in 2022 (). Heavier ALB (≥4) was found on a few hybrids in two Winchester OCC trials () and one field corn in Elgin County.\n\nCommon rust (CR) was detected in 78 (46%) of surveyed fields with an average severity of 1.4±0.6 across Ontario; 86% of surveyed fields had an average severity of 2.4±0.6, 60% of fields had an average severity of 1.5±0.8, and 35% fields an average severity of 1.2±0.4, in Central, Eastern, and Southern Ontario, respectively (). Heavier CR (≥4) was found on some hybrids in Bainsville and Waterloo OCC trials (). One sweet corn variety in Carleton-Ottawa County and one ornamental (flint) corn variety in Wellington County were very susceptible to CR (≥5).\n\nSouthern rust was not detected in 2022.\n\nGrey leaf spot (GLS) was found in 68 (40%) of the fields sampled with an average severity of 1.2±0.4 (). Of the 68 GLS fields, 64 fields were in Southern Ontario, with only two in Central and two in Eastern Ontario. Compared to previous years in Southern Ontario (Jindal et al. Citation2017, Citation2018, Citation2019), GLS was less common and a minor disease in 2022. Only a few hybrids in the Ilderton and Ridgetown OCC trials showed a severity of 4, and one field corn in Elgin County had a severity of 3.5. Compared to 2021 (Zhu et al. Citation2022), the frequency of GLS was also lower in Eastern Ontario during the 2022 growing season.\n\nNorthern corn leaf spot (NCLS) was found in 37 (22%) of 170 surveyed fields across Ontario with an average severity of 1.2±0.4 (). All symptoms in 2022 resembled race 3 of NCLS, which is easily confused with bacterial leaf streak. Both diseases form long, narrow, linear strips (spots) along small leaf veins. However, race 3 of NCLS has more yellowish strips that sometimes cross two or more small veins (White Citation2001). Conidiophores and/or spores of NCLS can be seen under the microscope. Of 37 NCLS fields, 31 were in Central and Southern Ontario, with the exception of Essex and Lambton counties where none were found in 2022. Some hybrids in Blyth and Wingham OCC trials had a severity of up to 4 (). Severe NCLS appeared with ALB or NCLB and tar spot in two field corn fields in Elgin, with 100% incidence and a severity of 3 to 4. NCLS has become more common across the province in recent years, as observed during our 1999 to 2022 annual corn disease surveys.\n\nEyespot was less prevalent in 2022, which is similar to previous years (Jindal et al. Citation2017, Citation2018, Citation2019; Zhu et al. Citation2022). This disease was found in 63 (37%) of the surveyed fields with an average severity of 1.2±0.4 (). Eyespot was found more frequently in Central (5/7) and Eastern (29/60) than in Southern (29/103) Ontario. Four grain corn fields with eyespot severity ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 were found in Huron, Wellington, and Carleton-Ottawa counties. Other fields, including all OCC trials, had low severity (<2) ().\n\nOther leaf diseases: Physoderma brown spot was found in 68 (40%) of fields with an average severity of 1.2±0.2. All symptoms appeared on leaf sheaths with low severity <2. Phaeosphaeria leaf spot, caused by Phaeosphaeria maydis, was found once in Winchester OCC trials.\n\nHolcus leaf spot, Stewart’s bacterial wilt, and Goss’s bacterial wilt and blight were not found in Ontario in 2022.\n\nFungal ear and stalk rot diseases:\n\nCommon smut was found in 44 (26%) of sampled fields with an average incidence of 0.4±1.2 (). The symptoms were mostly observed on ears or lower nodes of the plant. In the Carleton-Ottawa area, inbred lines in two isolation blocks had incidences 5% and 12%. All grain fields, and six of 16 OCC trials had incidence <1% (). Head smut was found in one field in Essex County in 2022 with incidence <1%. Ear rot, with an average incidence of 0.0±0.2, was found in eight (5%) of the sampled fields. All had low incidence (<1%).\n\nAnthracnose top dieback (ATDB), caused by C. graminicola, was very common, found in 141 (83%) of sampled fields with an average incidence of 16.7±15.6 (). Higher incidences were found in early planted fields, early maturity hybrids, and fields which were impacted by drought. Of the 141 ATDB fields, 11 fields had an incidence <10%, 120 fields had incidence of 10-25%, seven fields had an incidence of 50%, and three fields had an incidence of 75-100%.\n\nStalk rots: The most common symptoms were attributed to pythium stalk rot with a few fusarium stalk rot. Stalk rots were found in 44 (26%) fields with an average incidence of 1.7±7.3 (). Six isolation blocks in Carleton-Ottawa and two seed corn fields in Chatham-Kent counties, had an incidence ranging from 11-25%. Hybrids in Waterloo OCC trials had an incidence of stalk rot ranging from 20-80% and Wingham OCC ranged from 30-90% (). Heavier pythium stalk rot was the result of heavy rains in the middle of September after an extended dry period which occurred during corn maturing stages of development. Fusarium stalk rot was at low levels during the 2022 survey period.\n\nOthers: Corn rootworms, either northern corn rootworm [Diabrotica longicornis (Say)] or western corn rootworm (D. virgifera); Grasshoppers (Melanoplus spp.), European corn borer [Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner)], leaf miner (Agramyza parvicornis Loew), corn aphids [Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch)] were found in 96 (57%), 122 (72%), 30 (18%), 14 (8%), and 6 (4%) of fields, respectively. Spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch = T. bimaculatus Harvey) was found in 64 (38%) of fields. Twenty-three fields had bird damage and one field had large animal damage. Eight fields had hail damage. Sixteen fields showed significant drought problems with stunted plants and dry ears. Corn flea beetle (Chaetocnema pulicaria M.), the vector of Stewart’s wilt, was found in one field in Chatham-Kent in 2022.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: This survey was supported in part by the AAFC Growing Forward Partnership with the Canadian Field Crop Research Alliance (CFCRA) and the Grain Farmers of Ontario (GFO) through funding from the ‘Canadian Agricultural Partnership (CAP)’ a federal-provincial-territorial initiative which is administered by the Agricultural Adaptation Council.
