        "text": "Quercetin is known to possess antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The activity of this flavonoid against phytoplasmas, non-cultivable plant pathogenic bacteria that cause numerous plant diseases, has never been examined before. The aim of this research was to examine the effect of different concentrations of quercetin (10 mM, 100 mM and 1 mM) on 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris' and on phytoplasma- nfected periwinkle shoots grown in vitro. The addition of quercetin neither supported the growth of the shoots nor induced the remission of symptoms in the infected plants. On the contrary,addition of quercetin induced browning of leaves and the appearance of black spots on the leaves of treated infected and non-infected shoots. It also had no curative effect against the pathogen. Phytoplasma presence was confirmed by nested PCR in infected shoots treatedwith quercetin through three subcultures.\n\nSpring wheat (Triticum aestivum) crop losses in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota caused by Fusarium head blight (FHB) epidemics incited by Fusarium graminearum are common. Fungicide application is often recommended when environments promote disease development but benefits have not been fully evaluated when environment. cultivar resistance, and economic Outcome are considered. Agronomic and economic characters were determined for cultivars With Various resistance levels when treated with no fungicides propiconazole at 63 active ingredient (a.i.)/ha applied at Feekes growth stage (FGS) 2, tebuconazole at 126 g a.i./ha applied at FGS 10.51, or propiconazole at 63 g a.i./ha applied at FGS 2 followed by tebuconazole at 126 g a.i./ha applied at FGS 10.51. Revenue returned from FHB moderately susceptible (MS) cultivars was 8% greater than moderately resistant (MR) cultivars in low-disease environs but differences were not significant when disease was moderate, Deoxynivalenol accumulation in grain of MS and MR cultivars was unchanged by fungicide treatment. MS cultivars were economically more adventitious to grow than MR cultivars in both disease environments.\n\nSmall grains crop yield and quality losses resulting from Fusarium head blight (FHB) continue to threaten the economic sustainability of many small grains producers in Minnesota. Spring wheat breeders have made some progress in developing cultivars with moderate levels of disease resistance, but increased resistance in barley has not been achieved. Crop rotation and a timely application of fungicide remain the most important disease management strategies for managing the disease on both cropping species. Fungicide efficacy trials were conducted during 2003 and 2004 to compare the current industry standard (tebuconazole) efficacy with those of two experimental fungicides. Experimental products with active ingredients of metconazole or tebuconazole + prothioconazole significantly reduced percent FHB severity of spring wheat. Disease severity means with these experimentals averaged 28.5% less than tebuconazole, and percent visually scabby kernel means were 47% less with the experimentals compared with tebuconazole. Results were not as definitive for spring barley. Numerical trends from fungicide treatments were similar to those in spring wheat, but data were not statistically significant. These data indicate increased FHB management in Minnesota can be expected when experimental fungicides with active ingredients of metconazole or prothioconazole are registered for use on spring wheat by the EPA. The results for spring barley emphasize the urgency of achieving an effective disease management strategy for FHB and underscore the need for additional research on the disease in Upper Midwest states.
