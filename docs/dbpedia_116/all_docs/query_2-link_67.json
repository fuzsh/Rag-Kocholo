        "text": "My Decision to Run for County Council\n\nMy decision to run for a council position within the County of Strathcona has definitely not been an easy one. I believe that elected officials are placing their names and reputations into the public over decisions that will not be agreed upon by everyone, but are required to do so in order to have (what should be) the best interest for our County at hand.\n\nThis is my home and where my family will be residing for years to come, and I am concerned that some of the decisions made by the current council will negatively impact our future. These concerns are not only my own, but many others have voiced them to me on numerous occasions to the point of being brought up almost daily. A few of these examples include our high-grade farmland being allocated to industrial sized projects. Its estimated 10 thousand acres of prime farm land has been allocated for the Bremner and Cambrian Crossing projects alone. Another such project example is the AG facility named Pointé-aux-Pins Acres that has been approved, yet no one can show any comparable project of this size within a similar region to be financially capable of sustaining itself. The estimation is upwards of $90M for this AG facility at a time when materials and labor cost are higher than they have ever been. This means our tax dollars will be funding this facility with no “realistic” end in sight. There is ANOTHER $70M-$90M project being considered and listed as the “Indoor Field House”. I am having serious problems understanding how this facility will be financed let alone how it will be supported without increasing our taxes. I simply don’t believe it can.\n\nAs one of 3 RURAL councillors with an acreage and farming background, I have ongoing concerns about the back seat that agriculture has now taken in this county. There was an Agriculture Master Plan that was approved by council in 2016, yet there has been no support shown towards it. It states that prime farmland should only be developed as a LAST RESORT. Yet current and previous councils have completely ignored this principal.\n\nWhile we all understand that change, regardless of what is being considered never comes easily or quickly, I believe that a policy of open-door communication with the residents of Ward 5 is an essential first step. I also believe it is imperative that residents’ voices are actually heard. Current council far too often seem to dismisses resident concerns, insisting that the “silent majority” agrees with them. Representative democracy doesn’t mean that council “knows best.” Council should not be allowed total freedom to make decisions that residents must then simply accept.\n\nThe county’s slogan is “Your County. Your Voice.” Does council respect/acknowledge that concept?\n\nIf you, as a resident in the County of Strathcona, have any concerns or would like to have a conversation about what is happening within our region, please reach out to me any time.\n\nCouncil decisions impact us all.\n\nThese are some of the requests I have been listening to, along with additional interests and concerns. I believe we all understand how this list will continue to grow and change as to what our regional Ward 5 residents find important enough to request looking into.\n\nTAXES\n\nSupport Lowering of Property Taxes\n\nWe all know this is not a simple solution, but if our spending commitments are overburdening our budgets, maybe we should be reviewing some of our present policies to address this problem.\n\nRural property taxes without proper representation seems to be a patterned concern as well. I have been asked many times to explain what we actually receive for our taxes living in rural Strathcona County.\n\nSPENDING CONTROL\n\nReduce and Lead by Example\n\nFrom Pay cuts to salary reductions. There are many places to open this conversation to and we should all be willing to listen to options.\n\nReview Prioritize Spending\n\nPolice – Fire – Health / Safety – Road – Infrastructure etc.\n\nApproving to the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars on multiple projects that may not become sustainable is another problem I believe that needs to be addressed. A few of these examples include; – Cambrian Heights, The Bremner Project, The Multi Purpose Agricultural Facility, The Field House Sports Complex etc.\n\n(The financial numbers on these are staggering, yet limited regional residents fully understand what is being approved without true constituent involvement)\n\nTo make it clear. I am not either for or against projects like these being tabled. However, I believe the decision to move forward on these types of larger projects need to be looked at, listened to and agreed upon by the constituents of our Strathcona County far more than they presently are.\n\nSupporting Senior’s Programs\n\nI have been asked by a number of our Ward 5 seniors to look into some of the programs presently available for them, along with if there is any additional support that may be available to help keep our senior community healthy and active. Our region has quite a large number of seniors now and I can see how this demographic will continue to grow, this is why I believe there will always be a need to show some focus to these needs on an ongoing basis.\n\nInternet Speed & Reliability\n\nThe number of residents working from home, along with the required access of high-speed internet within our daily lives has grown year over year. I have seen and heard just how imperative it is that we ensure our residents are able to access this “Utility” without many of the problems and outages we have seen over the last number of years. We need to continue making sure we are on track to offering solutions to all rural residents sooner than later.\n\nTrail System / Biking, Hiking & Walking\n\nAnother topic of conversation I have come across is the request for looking at the possibility of laying out a stronger network of trail systems for Biking, Hiking and Walking within the Ardrossan and Rural area. I really can not say weather this would be possible or not at the moment, but this does have my interest as I do believe we have the foundation in place and this may be worth looking into.\n\nYouth Services & Programs\n\nThis is a topic that has come up to me fairly recently. To be straight forward, I would like to have a closer look as to what is presently in place along with what our regional Ward 5 constituents would like to see. This is another open conversation that I would be more than willing to support going forward.\n\nUtilize Managed Competitions\n\nAre services being tendered where the county should be supporting them?\n\nPotential to begin supporting city employees with development towards their own bids\n\nGain Sharing\n\nReward system / Employee Ideas / Incentives\n\nFind savings for the City – % of it goes towards the employee that presented it.\n\nUtilize New Tech\n\nSimply continue to move forward with new tech that can benefit the county by keeping an open door to ongoing change.\n\nOf course, these are simply a foundation for “base guidelines” on what many of the constituents of our Ward 5 have brought up to me time and again. While I am sure there will be more foundational “platform” directions that will come to light, it needs to be noted that while some of these may be feasible, some may not, but at the least, I will commit to research the matter in more detail once I am in a position to do so."
