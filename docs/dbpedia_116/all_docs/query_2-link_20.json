In comparison, Edmonton’s Hawrelak Park measures one quarter section.\n\nConstruction of the park will happen in three distinct phases:\n\nPhase 1 – North River Park: $19.3 million\n\n• As this site was previously used as a gravel quarry, this area will be the key wildlife biodiversity zone, where forest and riparian restoration will take place. Construction includes topographic diversity, with hills created from earthmoving operations around wetlands. Directly along the riverbank’s trails will be a viewpoint with benches, shade, and interpretative signage. Within this portion, a north flood park will be developed, which will be designed to handle a one-in-one-hundred-year flood.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n• Due to the steep slope at the river’s edge, direct river access for boat launches will not be possible within this new park.\n\nPhase 2 – South Wetland Park: $24.9 million\n\n• Existing ponds will be modified for wetland restoration, which could include future fishing opportunities, and boardwalks will be added along the north side.\n\n“The wetlands are one of the most unique aspects of this property, so developing boardwalks and pathways on the edges of them and through them will create really wonderful experiences and educational opportunities for school groups and visitors to the region,” Williams said.\n\n• A large open space could accommodate events or festivals and a skating loop for winter recreation will be located next to the boathouse.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“This skating loop wouldn’t be in the waterbodies, but on the land. You could really make this as big as you wanted it to be, the land is there for it. Creating a lengthy, long beautiful skating loop on this landscape would be an amazing experience,” the architect explained.\n\n• A tiered stone or gravel beach seating area will be created around the southwest pond, where non-motorized boating will take place. Boat rentals could also be offered by the county, and a parking lot, washrooms, and potential food services will be available.\n\nPhase 3 – Central Gathering Place: $11.9 million\n\n• A visitor pavilion (located outside of the flood plain), with outdoor seating and an adjacent plaza to accommodate community and school gatherings will be this area’s focal point and a natural playground that uses the terrain for different play experiences. If required, this step will include a parking lot expansion.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nConnecting all three spaces will be the trail networks, which will focus on usage in all four seasons, so cross-country ski trails will be added.\n\n“As the ecosystems start to regenerate, we’ll have these wonderful loops of natural trails within forests, shrub-land, and grasslands, which all have the opportunities to have interpretative signage and diversity of experience to really enjoy and connect people with nature.”\n\nThe remainder of the $76.7 million budget includes $16.8M for a 30 per cent contingency fund as well as $3.8 million for design and engineering fees. All costs estimates are in 2023 dollars. Much of the overall budget will be absorbed by groundwork mediation and forest regeneration, according to O2 Planning and Design.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nTrail networking and forest regeneration could be examined for a quicker timeline in the short-term, if grant funding is available.\n\nConstruction timeline set at 2038\n\nA tentative construction start date is pinned for 2038. A capital design would also be finished then.\n\nThat timeline didn’t set well with the majority of council, many of whom hinted to moving up the date.\n\n“I’m just thinking about the timeline and looking at our ages here across the bench here and it might be a little too late for some of us. But, of course, all things have to happen in good time,” joked Ward 4 Coun. Bill Tonita, adding reforestation needs to be made a priority sooner than later in order to enjoy it in the longterm.\n\n“I was really, really excited until I saw the timeline,” noted Ward 6 Coun. Corey-Ann Hartwick, who added cost estimates could shift substantially with inflation by 2038. “It’s such an important project and I think it’s going to be spectacular.”\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWard 3 Coun. Lorne Harvey suggested actively looking for grant funding in order to speed up the project start date.\n\n“I’m quite looking forward to this project,” Harvey said. “I might end up seeing it. I am concerned about your timeline though. I’m one of the financial people on this council, I know everything costs money, but I can’t help but to think there has to be provincial or federal money out there for something like green initiative such as a park like this… Hopefully we can move this date up. They’ll be building the (RVA bridge) and completing that in (December) 2025. It just seems waiting another 13 years to starting the park is an awful long time.”\n\nProvincial and federal grant funding will be part of the overall plan in addition to partnerships with regional development or environmental organizations. Administration also suggested that the municipality should consider the creation of a stewardship organization to assist administration and the management of projects, such as a non-profit called the Friends of Strathcona County Regional Park, which could also tap into further grant funding.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe mayor picked up on that idea, pointing out a non-profit group could also draw lots of industrial sponsorship and other grants. He also noted that waiting 15 years is ‘probably not the way to go’.\n\n“Thank you very much for giving us a vision, a landmark park. It’s a great idea,” Mayor Rod Frank stated.\n\nPlanning has already taken many years as the River Valley Alliance endorsed the plan of action in 2008, the county acquired the former Lafarge lands for $1.7 million in 2017, an Indigenous Engagement Strategy was completed in 2019, and two rounds of public consultations took place in 2020 and 2021.\n\nSince the Master Plan is viewed as a guide for development, the county confirmed that can be amended if community needs change over time.\n\n“This Master Plan has the ability to ebb and flow as uses change,” said Leslee Laing, the county’s senior advisor for open space planning. “If at any point, we need to relook at this site and hone in with the community again to seek their feedback on what their needs are, there is no reason why this land couldn’t support a lot of those needs, but not all of those needs.”\n\nlmorey@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/LindsayDMorey\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories\n\nNews Near Sherwood Park"
