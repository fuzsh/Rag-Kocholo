        "text": "Article content\n\nA few weeks ago, I convinced Clare that we should travel to the Huron Country Playhouse to catch Drayton Entertainment’s presentation of Jersey Boys.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nWALLACEBURG ARTS: Admiring the vocal harmonies of Jersey Boys Back to video\n\nI had my eyes on this musical for many weeks, but it was sold-out night after night and tickets were extremely scarce.\n\nHowever, by the skin of our teeth, we managed to snag two tickets on closing night!\n\nI had seen the musical several years ago and absolutely loved it, but was secretly wondering if this more regional production would live-up to the standards of the touring production I had seen previously.\n\nReaders should be aware that vocal harmony is my absolute, hands-down favourite form of music and while perhaps the harmonies of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons aren’t anywhere close to the complexities of groups like Voctave or The Four Freshmen, their music is pure delight.\n\nI’m not easily convinced to take in dramatic productions but toss in some great songs to turn a play into a musical and I’m in, silly as most of them are.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSome will likely send hate mail but the only musical I’ve ever seen that I did not enjoy was everyone else’s favourite, Wicked.\n\nIf one tries to give me free tickets to see that again, I’ll have to decline.\n\nIn short, Jersey Boys was incredibly good, and I will suggest even better than the touring production I had seen previously.\n\nThe vocals were spot-on, perfectly balanced, and Niko Combitsis who portrayed Franki Valli could not have been any more of a dead-ringer.\n\nHis falsetto voice was amazing!\n\nThe other three actors/vocalists, Garrett Woods as Nick Massi, Josh Alcantara portraying the musical genius Bob Gaudio and Kale Penny as Tommy DeVito, were stunning in filling in all of the gorgeous harmonies as The Four Seasons.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nRoll your eyes and laugh if you wish, but the beauty of their harmonies caused my eyes to well-up several times. No, I actually felt a few tears run down my cheek.\n\nThe language was raw at times, but writers Marshall Brickman and Rick Elise wanted to realistically portray what life was like on the rough and tough streets of Jersey back in the ‘50s and ‘60s.\n\nAnd I cannot give enough kudos to the band.\n\nMusic director Konrad Pluta looked after the keys, and the rest of the pit band included a guitarist, bassist, reed player, trumpet player and a drummer.\n\nThe band knew exactly how to support the harmonies without interfering and that is not easily done, especially when vocal harmonies define a group such as this.\n\nSo why do I rave about a production that is no longer running? Because it is still running, but not in Grand Bend.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nDrayton Entertainment operates a series of five theatres and rotates their productions from theatre to theatre during their season.\n\nJersey Boys has closed in Grand Bend but has moved on to the King’s Wharf Theatre in Penetanguishene and runs from Aug. 8 to Sept. 1.\n\nI highly recommend an overnight trip, if you can find a ticket. It’s that good!\n\nOn another topic, a few weeks ago marked the end of an era.\n\nI’ve spoken about the late Wallaceburg District Secondary School music director Andy Botai here several times, and at our Wallaceburg Concert Band spring 2023 concert, we played several scores dedicated to his memory.\n\nAndy was my music teacher and an inspiration to me.\n\nHe was a French horn player in the Hungarian National Opera Orchestra, and he and his wife Alice defected from Hungary many years ago when it was still under communist rule.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAndy of course passed away in 1984 and I was given the daunting opportunity to take over for him after his passing.\n\nBe it known though that while I took his place, I never filled his shoes.\n\nI had heard pieces of their story and how they arrived in Wallaceburg, but I never had the courage to ask for the details before Andy passed away, and I lost contact with Alice after she left Wallaceburg.\n\nA few months ago, through the hard work of Audrey Hind, I managed to make a connection with Alice through her caretaker, Karen Russell.\n\nIn asking Alice to share their story, Karen pulled out her phone and recorded Alice explaining how they arrived in Canada, and subsequently, Wallaceburg.\n\nKaren sent me the audio of that conversation.\n\nAlice’s voice was weak as she was 90 years of age, but to hear her voice again was magical.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSadly, Dr. Alice Botai passed away on May 8, barely two weeks after Karen recorded their conversation. But I now have the complete story and if anyone wishes to hear it in Alice’s own words, it is available on the Cavanagh Funeral Home site.\n\nTo hear Alice and Andy’s story, go to Alice’s Obituary, select “Photos and Videos” and you will see “Botai’s Journey from Hungary.”\n\nAnother element to their story that I was unaware of is that Alice was apparently a nationally known media star and was described to me as the “Barbara Walters” of Hungary.\n\nI wish I had an opportunity to get more of that part of the story.\n\nWhile Alice wasn’t my music teacher, she was very much entwined and in-tune with many of the students at the school, always present for our concerts, and became a supporter of me and my musical journey.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nChris and Brenda Mann, along with myself and several close friends of Alice gathered at Riverview Cemetery a few weeks ago for a short interment ceremony marking the end of a musical legacy here in Wallaceburg.\n\nI don’t know what everyone else was doing a few weeks ago when it was so hot that I thought I was walking on the surface of the sun, but I turned my air conditioner to “Antarctic Breeze” and sequestered myself in the basement working on … Christmas music.\n\nWhile it’s far too early to talk about our WCB Christmas concerts but I do want to pique readers’ curiosity about a very special concert that we will be presenting at St. Paul’s Congregational Church in Chatham this fall.\n\nThis concert has been in the works since 2022, but we’ve been unable to present it due to the lack of a local venue, so we’ve decided to move it to Chatham.\n\nIf one has never been in St. Paul’s Congregational Church, you are in for a treat. It is a magnificent facility that we have been afforded the privilege to perform in.\n\nIt’s nothing short of a big gamble presenting this concert out of town but we’re hoping our dedicated supporters will make the trip to this very unique concert on Oct. 19 at 7 p.m.\n\nI’ll provide more information in a few weeks.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories\n\nNews Near Wallaceburg"
