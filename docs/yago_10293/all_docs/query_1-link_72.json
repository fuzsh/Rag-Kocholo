When previewed, the audience laughed so loud that director Allen decided to leave it in, and had to add footage to compensate for people missing the next few jokes from laughing too much.\n\nAllen originally envisioned this movie as a murder mystery, and that's how it was shot, with a subplot about a romance. During editing, Allen realized that all the best footage was of the romance, so he reedited the film as a romantic comedy.\n\nDuring the lobster-cooking scene Annie runs and retrieves a camera to take pictures of Alvy dealing with the crustaceans. Later, when Alvy runs over to Annie's house to smash a spider, the series of photos Annie took is on the wall in the background.\n\nKeaton, Diane's real name is Diane Hall and her nickname is Annie.\n\nWeaver, Sigourney's screen debut, in a non-speaking part as Alvy's date near the end of the movie.\n\nThe jokes that Allen, Woody tells in front of the audience at the University of Wisconsin and on \"The Dick Cavett Show\" are from his stand-up comic days.\n\nAnnie's outfits, which caused a brief fashion rage, were Keaton, Diane's own clothes.\n\nWhen waiting in front of the movie theater Woody Allen's character Alvy Singer says, \"I'm standing out here with the cast of the Godfather\", to Diane Keaton, who was in the cast of \"The Godfather\". Additionally, one of the men who bothers him for the autograph is played by actor Richard Petrocelli, who had a small role in The Godfather as a thug who protects Michael en route to the hospital.\n\nIn the scene where Alvy questions people on the street about what makes a relationship, a large crowd can be seen in the background watching the filming.\n\nDuring the classroom flashbacks, one of the teachers writes, \"Tuesday, December 1\" on the chalkboard. December 1 is Woody Allen's birthday.\n\nBen Stiller comments how he likes the scene when Alvy has to meet Annie's family in AFI's 100 Years, 100 Movies (1998) and how it relates to him personally because he always was very apprehensive meeting his girlfriends parents. Ben Stiller starred in Meet the Parents (2000) which revolved around that very idea.\n\nAlvy calls the two fans that pester him at the movie theatre 'Cheech,' in Bullets over Broadway, also directed by Allen, Chazz Palminteri's gangster character is called 'Cheech.'\n\nThe film's working title was Anhedonia - the inability to feel pleasure. United Artists fought against it (among other things, they were unable to come up with an ad campaign that explained the meaning of the word) and Allen compromised on naming the film after the central character three week's before the film's premiere.\n\nThe film Alvy is waiting to see with Annie is Face to Face (1975) by Ingmar Bergman, one of Woody Allen's biggest influences.\n\n\"That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing\" is a reference to the quote by H.L. Mencken in 1942 (and later Humphrey Bogart).\n\nDonald Symington, who played Annie Hall's dad later played another father in 1995's Mighty Aphrodite. Joan Newman, who played Allen's mom played his character;s mother in 1980's Stardust Memories.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nAcademy Awards, USA - 1978\n\nWon Oscar\n\nBest Actress in a Leading Role\n\nDiane Keaton\n\nBest Director\n\nWoody Allen Woody Allen was not present at the awards ceremony.
