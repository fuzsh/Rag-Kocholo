        "text": "Original U.S. One-Sheet Poster (27x41) Folded Fine Plus Condition\n\nOrion Pictures Original U.S. one-sheet poster (27X41) for the Marshall Brickman directed comedy SIMON (1980) starring Alan Arkin, Madeline Kahn and Austin Pendleton. The film is about a psychology professor who is brainwashed by a group of \"mad\" scientists in order to convince the world - and the professor - that he is an extraterrestrial being. But when the professor escapes and becomes a celebrity, the ruse gets (comically) out of hand. Alan Arkin was nominated by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror films for Best Actor. The film had a big supporting cast, including Wallace Shawn, Fred Gwynne, Louise Lasser and a host of others. Look for Dick Cavett, playing himself. MovieArt guarantees that this poster is an authentic, vintage insert poster for this film. MovieArt Austin does not sell reproductions.\n\nMARSHALL BRICKMAN - Director\n\nMadeline Kahn - Actor\n\nALAN ARKIN - Actor\n\nAustin Pendleton - Actor"
