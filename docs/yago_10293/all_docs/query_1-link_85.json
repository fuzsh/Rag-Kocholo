        "text": "One day in the city of downtown Chicago, I saw Richard Linklater’s most talked about movie “Boyhood.” I was in amazement with how elegant it was. Linklater brings a heartfelt film with actors that have been in the works of this production for the last twelve years. We see a few big name celebrities, but the audience is introduced to new celebrities as well. It stars Ellar Coltrane (as Mason), Lorelei Linklater (as Samantha), Patricia Arquette (as Mom), and Ethan Hawke (as Dad). Even though, we are still months away from nominees of movies, “Boyhood” is already receiving a ton of Oscar buzz.\n\n“Boyhood” was filmed in twelve years with the same cast. The film is an innovative adventure through the eyes of a child named Mason. Mason grows up before we know it. His mom and dad have relationship problems and are divorced. Mason’s sister is Samantha. “Boyhood” establishes the life of childhood unlike any other childhood film.\n\n“Boyhood” is technologically great with being chronological. The editor Sandra Adair (did editing for a variety of Linklater’s films including “School of Rock,” “Before Sunrise,” “Before Sunset,” “Before Midnight,” “Suburbia,” and more) does a tremendous job with snapshots of adolescence with road trips, family dinners, birthdays, and graduation of high school. The best part of this is that all of the moments in between become transcendent and set to a soundtrack spanning the years from Coldplay’s Yellow to Arcade Fire’s Deep Blue. “Boyhood” is an artsy masterpiece that is both a sentimental time capsule of the recent past and an ode to growing up and parenting.\n\nThe film is two hours and fifteen minutes, quite long for a childhood drama. When “Boyhood” is experienced though, it does not feel that long at all. However, the challenges that Mason faces were not always understood at first. At like three instances, it was unexplained with why Mason would be angry.\n\nDespite the moments of unexplained scenes, “Boyhood” is spectacle, involving, and charming—and one that is a must-see.\n\nFour stars.\n\nOne of the traits that Marvel used in “Guardians of the Galaxy” was references to classic music and movies at awkward moments. There is a bunch of unexplained issues, indeed, that these superheroes are not that professional. “Guardians of the Galaxy” is action-packed though, although it is action-packed with twists of humor.\n\nThe plot: In the different locations of space, an American pilot under the name of Peter Quill, realizes he is in the object of a manhunt after his immature judgment of stealing an orb.\n\n“Guardians of the Galaxy,” assembles all of the members of this Marvel team: Peter Quill (known as Starlord), Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket. This team is like aggravated detectives, or a punishment on each others’ behavior. What really caught my attention is how they all fight differently. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is a laid-back man that loves his music and is skilled with weaponry. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is a green lady that is skilled with martial arts. Drax (Dave Bautista) is a grumpy and muscular purple man that does not put up with people’s garbage. Groot (Vin Diesel) is a human tree that can grow in a variety of ways and only knows how to say, “I am Groot.” Then there is Rocket (Bradley Cooper), a ruthless, gun-slinging Raccoon with a bad attitude.\n\nThis is one film that is similar to many Marvel films, but it leaves us laughing, rather than being curious about the next serious marvel film. There is a finale with much action. However its resolution is quirky moments of something joyful.\n\nMarvel fans will really have fun with this movie. If many have read the comic books (which I am sure they have), this is a Marvel film where they will be laughing more than they expect to be. “Guardians of the Galaxy” is done well by James Gunn, with comedy and action. It provides its fans with the style of Marvel adaptations that they love.\n\nThree and a half stars.\n\nManny Rodriguez’s “The Fluffy Movie” is a comedy concert film that captures the on-stage performance of Gabriel “Fluffy” Iglesias. The opening is a mini-version of him around age nine or ten renting Eddie Murphy’s stand up special, which is called “Raw” and laughing hysterically.\n\nI have watched many films on the topic of stand-up comedy, and that opening with the kid watching a vulgar comedian defines a devoted comedian. Iglesias has the delivery, the material, and the expressions to make satirical and be memorable.\n\nIglesias does not go right to being raunchy as most comedians do, and he never has. I see that his creative sense of humor and stories from his life is what he wants his fans to be dazzled by. An example is Iglesias talking about his son Frankie. He talks about his son bored with his Nintendo Wii and Iglesias tells the audience how he explained video gaming in his life back in the day. “Back in the day, I had a Nintendo Entertainment System, and that thing was like performing CPR.” He tells a variety of stories of how his son tries to get his way. Perhaps this storytelling strategy of Iglesias makes his fans have connections to what he is talking about.\n\nThe one joyful aspect of “The Fluffy Movie” is that it is hysterical without containing cuss words. There are some comedians that cuss a lot, cuss a little, and some that do not cuss at all. Iglesias makes funny points with clean material (but has some edgy topics for a short duration of his shows) and quirky noises.\n\nThis film was entertaining on the big screen. What is a bigger deal though, is it is totally “Fluffy.”\n\nThree stars."
