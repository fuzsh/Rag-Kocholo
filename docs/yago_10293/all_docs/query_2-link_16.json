With a television background, including work on Candid Camera, The Tonight Show, and The Dick Cavett Show, Brickman helped write The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence in 1974; the pilot included a comedic \"Seven Deadly Sins\" pageant. Decades later, in 2001, Brickman was hired to rewrite Anthony Minghella's screenplay for a more serious examination of The Seven Deadly Sins, a project which never reached fruition.\n\nBrickman's other credits include For the Boys, with Bette Midler, and writing and directing the thriller The Manhattan Project.\n\n[]\n\nIMDb"
