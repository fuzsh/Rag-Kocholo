        "text": "Annie Hall (1977) Study Guide\n\nAnnie Hall (1977)\n\nDirector: Woody Allen\n\nScreenwriter: Woody Allen\n\nMarshall Brickman\n\nReleased by: United Artists\n\nHistorical context\n\nAnnie Hall was released in 1977 to wide critical acclaim and commercial success. The film, Allen's 6th as director (7th if you count What's Up, Tiger Lily?), differs sharply from his previous films, which were parodies of specific film genres and literary canons. These slapstick comedies included films such as Take the Money and Run (1969) and Love and Death (1975). With Annie Hall, Allen decided to turn his focus from parody to a film with a more powerful storyline, presented in a more stylistically adventurous manner. Originally the film was conceived as a murder mystery, but that idea was discarded as the storyline of a quirky romance began to emerge from the script.\n\nSociohistorical Context\n\nThe themes that Woody Allen deals with in Annie Hall transcend the film's settings, but the film is also very much a product of its time and place. Much of Allen's work draws from his personal idiosyncrasies, but Annie Hall finds inspiration in many places. It incorporates the backdrops of New York City, Los Angeles and \"the Midwest\" as juxtaposing forces to inform the film. The film is also rife with references to popular culture and academia, including the Marx Brothers, filmmakers like Federico Fellini, who gets a tongue-in-cheek nod in a theater lobby scene, media theorist Marshall McLuhan, who appears in a bit part, and Ingmar Bergman, whose aesthetic style inspired much of Annie Hall's visual invention. (Allen's non-comedic film Interiors is essentially a straight Bergman pastiche.) It is Sigmund Freud however, who has perhaps the greatest impact on Allen's work. Woody Allen's stream of consciousness narrative style is just one indication of this Freudian influence.\n\nNarrative context\n\nWoody Allen uses an uncommon narrative style in this film. He often interrupts the flow of the narrative to address the audience directly, breaking the \"fourth wall.\" Why do you think Allen made this choice in Annie Hall?\n\nBeyond providing visually juxtaposed settings for Allen's film, the cities of New York City, Los Angeles, and Chippewa Falls are all represented for their narrative functions. Why would Allen choose these places? What do they represent? How are they used as narration devices?\n\nWhat is the significance of Alvy’s preoccupation with sex?\n\nWhat is significant about Annie’s use of the phrases and words, “La-de-da” and “neat”?\n\nAlvy is a comedian and playwright, Annie is a photographer and singer, Rob is an actor. What is the significance of all of the main characters having careers as performers?\n\nWhat is the significance of Alvy interpreting his life in the context of jokes? (e.g. \"I would never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member,\" and \"we need the eggs.\")\n\nThe entire film is filtered through the perceptions of Alvy Singer, who narrates and interprets the story for us. Do you think Alvy is a reliable narrator? Which of the film's events (if any) do you think might have transpired differently than the way that Alvy reports them?\n\nThe story is told non-chronologically, with flashbacks interpolated freely throughout. How would the film have been different if it had been told chronologically?\n\nAesthetic context\n\nAllen uses a large array of visual elements in Annie Hall, presenting the audience with a formalistic aesthetic, which he juxtaposes with a love story that is more realistic than comparable narratives in many film dramas. If he wanted to tell a realistic story, why wouldn't he choose to present it in a realistic manner?\n\nWhat are some of the less traditional aesthetic elements Allen utilizes?\n\nWhy does Allen use subtitles during the conversation between Annie Hall and Alvy Singer on the rooftop of her apartment?\n\nWhat is the significance of the animated sequence in Annie Hall? Why is Annie Hall cast in the role of the wicked queen in that scene?\n\nIn addition to blurring the line between past and present through constant use of flashbacks, Allen also blurs the line between fantasy and reality. Think, for example, of the scene in which Alvy is having dinner with Annie's family, in which a split screen effect allows a dialogue between Annie's parents and Alvy's parents that never could have actually occurred. What are some other examples of this, and what function do they serve?\n\nAllen uses a double exposure during the bedroom scene with Annie, where Alvy convinces her to have sex without smoking any marijuana. What is the purpose of using this effect in the scene?\n\nGeneric context\n\nSome may consider Annie Hall to be a romantic comedy. It obviously has comic elements and there is the underlying story of a relationship. Consider other romantic comedies you may have seen. Traditionally these films present the story of characters that have seemingly irreconcilable differences in the beginning, but through a series of events are brought together to forge a relationship, supposedly find lasting happiness. How does Annie Hall subvert these conventions?\n\nHaving thought about that, would you consider the film to be a classical genre film, a revisionist genre film, or a genre parody? Or is it sui generis?\n\nRhetorical context\n\nIt is arguable that Allen presents three dominant themes throughout this film:\n\nour need for love, despite our understanding that love is absurd\n\nthe ability of art to serve a transformative function\n\nthe power of location to inform or reflect identity\n\nHow are these three themes embedded in the film?\n\nWhat is the general attitude toward drugs in Annie Hall?\n\nWhat is the rhetorical significance of Alvy's fascination with death? Does Allen, as the filmmaker, seem to endorse his character's views on the subject? How does the film inform us of Alvy's obsession with the subject?"
