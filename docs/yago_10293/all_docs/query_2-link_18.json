Due to the age and properties of the original item, you may experience poor audio and/or video quality and breaks in the content.\n\nThe Larry Katz collection, 1980-2005 consists of interviews recorded on audiocassettes conducted by Larry Katz, a reporter, critic, columnist and editor at Real Paper (1980-1981), The Boston Herald (1981-2011) and the resulting publications. For decades he interviewed some of the most established names in music as well as overlooked pioneers, talented newcomers and Boston-area legends. Most of the interviews are with musicians and singers, but there are also many with persons involved in the recording, film, theater, television and literary industries."
