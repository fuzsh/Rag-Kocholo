        "text": "Three very different discs get a spin in the player this week:\n\n‘On the Bowery’\n\n“On the Bowery” (1956) isn’t a documentary — not exactly — but it’s one of the most fascinating peeks inside a hidden world I’ve ever seen. Filmed by Lionel Rogosin on New York’s notorious Skid Row, the film follows Ray (Ray Salyer), a relatively young man arriving on the Bowery with a suitcase in his hand and a little money in his pocket. Over the course of a couple of days, he loses both the suitcase and the money but — maybe — gains a bit of perspective from the Bowery’s other residents. And he drinks. A lot.\n\nNegligible plot aside, what makes “On the Bowery” so compelling is that what you’re seeing is the real deal. Even Hollywood movies purporting to be gritty and grim in their depiction of alcoholism don’t come anywhere near what “On the Bowery” achieves in a few simple scenes where Rogosin simply sets up shop in a Skid Row bar and lets his camera roll. It’s such astonishingly intimate footage that I felt like I should look away from these people who’d obviously hit rock bottom, but I couldn’t. It was just too mesmerizing. As a story, it’s a simple but effective one. But as a time capsule of a forgotten world, it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before.\n\nThe new “On the Bowery” Blu-ray from Milestone Films is an impressive package — and a fitting salute to director Lionel Rogosin. Besides the movie itself, the two-disc set includes making of features, more documentaries about New York’s Bowery, an introduction from Martin Scorsese (a huge Rogosin fan) and the trailer. Plus, on the second disc, you get two more Rogosin films: “Good Times, Wonderful Times,” which contrasts war atrocities with a London cocktail party; and “Out,” which follows Hungarian refugees fleeing Austria. Neither is as downright fascinating as “On the Bowery,” but both are well worth watching.\n\n‘Simon’\n\nAs a kid, I remember seeing tons of commercials for this 1980 Alan Arkin comedy. It must’ve had one heck of a promotional budget. Unfortunately, that money went right down the drain because, as far as I can tell, the movie came and went in theaters without anyone even noticing. I do almost nothing but read about obscure movies, and I’ve never even seen it mentioned until Warner Archives announced they’d be releasing it in 2012. So naturally, that weird commercial still echoing in my head, I requested a copy. After all these years, I wanted to see what the heck it was.\n\nUnfortunately, it’s not much. Written and directed by Marshall Brickman, best known for his collaborations with Woody Allen, it aims for the sort of smart satire he and Woody created in “Sleeper” but misses the mark. The plot involves think tank scientists (played by such classic screen nerds as Austin Pendleton, Wallace Shawn and Max Wright) who convince a psychologist (Arkin) that he’s really an alien as a sort of elaborate prank on the world. So far so good. But when Arkin assumes his alien persona, he’s both too serious and too silly, and the movie wastes whatever potential it had. I’m a big Arkin fan, but personally, I wish the movie had just focused on Pendleton and company playing jokes on the moronic population of Planet Earth. Now that would’ve been funny!\n\n‘The Sunset Limited’\n\nIf you’re looking for three dramatic powerhouses, it would be tough to top actor Samuel L. Jackson, actor Tommy Lee Jones and writer Cormac McCarthy. Those three men teamed up on the play “The Sunset Limited” (as a bonus, Jones directed), HBO filmed it, and now, thanks to the magic of DVD, you can watch it.\n\nFocusing on an ex-con (Jackson) who claims to hear the voice of Jesus and a college professor (Jones) who tried to step in front of a train, “The Sunset Limited” offers the sort of tense, two-person drama you rarely see. With no elaborate sets, supporting cast or complicated plot machinations, everything comes down to two desperate men in a room debating the only issue that really matters: Is life worth living? As you might guess, it’s pretty potent stuff."
