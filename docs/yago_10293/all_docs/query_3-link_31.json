        "text": "A 12 Jan 1979 HR news item announced that principal photography would begin 26 Feb 1979 in New York City. According to a brief in the 4 Apr 1979 Var, the production spent five weeks filming there. A 6 Jun 1979 Var news brief reported that eight days of filming were also completed in Warren, NJ.\n\nAccording to production notes in AMPAS library files, the picture had a ten-week shooting schedule. The film’s climax, involving a rocket launch, took a week to shoot at the NASA Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, FL. The relatively new Space Shuttle was featured in exterior sequences. Back in New York City, production designer Stuart Wurtzel built sets to use as the spaceship interior.\n\nDue to director Marshall Brickman’s admiration of architect Richard Meier’s work, the exterior of the Bronx Development Center, a Meier-designed building, became the film’s Institute for Advanced Concepts. Brickman also used exteriors and interiors from three private residences, two of which were Meier designs, to show different views of The Institute.\n\nThe palette of the movie changed depending on the action. Sequences with Simon in New York City focused on the use of primary colors. Once the action moved to The Institute, the color scheme switched to white-on-white. At the film’s end, warm colors were used to compliment the countryside.\n\nThe 12 Jan 1979 HR stated that the picture marked the theatrical directorial debut of Marshall Brickman, best known for his writing collaboration with Woody Allen. A 22 Aug 1979 Warner Bros. Pictures press release announced that actress Judy Graubart would make her theatrical film debut.\n\nThe following acknowledgment appears in end credits: ”We would like to express our appreciation to the New York City Mayor’s Office of Motion Pictures & Television.”\n\nLess\n\nAt the Institute for Advanced Concepts, five brilliant, twisted geniuses have been hired to save the world, but become more interested in other pursuits.

His ideas earn much media attention. When Simon tells Becker he is ready to release another statement, Becker wants to review the material, but Simon refuses. Instead, Simon wants Becker to arrange a meeting with the president, the Chinese premier, the pope, and television news anchorman Walter Cronkite. Simon’s demands make Becker tell the other scientists that it is time to terminate Simon, but they ask for more time to enjoy Simon’s effect on the public. Becker relents on the condition they take control of Simon’s growing ego. Meanwhile, Lisa, the assistant from Simon’s former university laboratory, visits the Institute to convince Simon that he is not an extraterrestrial. When Simon becomes overwrought, she changes her tack and asks him to make love because she has never had sex with an extraterrestrial. The scientists soon realize that their experiment has spun out of control. Becker likes the idea of an undetectable gas that will cut Simon’s intellect in half. However, the equipment malfunctions, and the gas drifts throughout the Institute. Becker escapes in time to speak with Doris, the Institute supercomputer. While the machine reassures him that the effects of the gas will wear off within weeks, she has also alerted the Pentagon to the problem. By morning, National Guard troops arrive. Lisa overhears General Korey’s assumption that Simon is responsible for releasing “the stupid-making gas.” When Korey orders his men to find and kill Simon, Lisa warns Simon that he is being blamed for the accident. Lisa and Simon steal a van, and escape Institute grounds. They meet members of a commune, whose leader recognizes Simon from watching television news. The commune members discover a portable television station that can broadcast simultaneously on all the major networks from inside Simon’s stolen van. Soon Simon broadcasts about his general wellbeing and his philosophies, leading to a more rewarding way of American life. As the gas cloud drifts toward the nation’s capitol, Simon continues his broadcasts, denouncing corrupt politicians, traffic gridlock, and pretentious, silly names given to children, among other things. Becker broadcasts a message of his own, asking Simon to contact him. While Lisa argues that Simon’s influence has caused chaos, Simon responds that it takes time to change bad habits. Then it dawns on Simon that his message is not getting through to a majority of the public. People still listen to bad elevator music, and eat thin, gray hamburgers with imitation sauce. Lisa argues that some people might just like their life the way it is. She then interrupts his criticism to tell him that she is pregnant. Simon denies that he is the father because interplanetary species cannot mate. Lisa responds that he does not want to admit he is the father because he would no longer be special. Later, Simon contacts Becker, and admits he is depressed and wants to return to his planet of origin. Becker and Korey arrange for a NASA rocket ship that will transport Simon home. However, Simon takes Becker hostage, and the rocket launches into space with Becker in Simon’s place. Together, Simon and Lisa have a son, and are believed to be living in seclusion in Canada. While Simon plays with his child, Lisa hears over the radio that Simon has been awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for calling attention to the many annoyances that have eroded American life.\n\nLess"
