Original U.S. Insert Card Poster (14x36) Rolled Fine Plus Condition

Orion Pictures Original U.S. insert poster (14x36) for the Marshall Brickman directed comedy SIMON (1980) starring Alan Arkin, Madeline Kahn and Austin Pendleton. The film is about a psychology professor who is brainwashed by a group of "mad" scientists in order to convince the world - and the professor - that he is an extraterrestrial being. But when the professor escapes and becomes a celebrity, the ruse gets (comically) out of hand. Alan Arkin was nominated by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror films for Best Actor. The film had a big supporting cast, including Wallace Shawn, Fred Gwynne, Louise Lasser and a host of others. Look for Dick Cavett, playing himself. MovieArt guarantees that this poster is an authentic, vintage insert poster for this film. MovieArt Austin does not sell reproductions.
