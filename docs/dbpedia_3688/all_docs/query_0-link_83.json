        "text": "The Washington Nationals added another veteran to their spring competition, agreeing to a minor-league contract with outfielder Eddie Rosario, Andrew Golden of the Washington Post reports.\n\nRosario's deal will pay him a base salary of $2 million if he's in the majors, according to Jon Heyman of the New York Post. He can max out the contract at $4 million through various incentives, sources told Daniel √Ålvarez-Montes of El Extrabase. Completion of the agreement is pending a physical.\n\nThe 32-year-old is a familiar face to the Nationals after he spent most of the last three seasons with the NL East-rival Atlanta Braves. Rosario was instrumental to Atlanta's 2021 World Series championship, posting a 1.073 OPS during that playoff run and winning the NLCS MVP.\n\nAfter struggling in 2022 while battling vision issues, Rosario rebounded last year to hit .255/.305/.450 with 21 homers, 74 RBIs, and three defensive runs saved in 142 games as Atlanta's primary left fielder. It marked his best overall season since his 32-homer 2019 campaign with the Minnesota Twins.\n\nRosario adds another name to a crowded group of Nationals outfielders vying for regular-season roster spots. His primary competition is likely fellow non-roster invitee Jesse Winker, who's emerging as the front-runner in left field. Both Winker and Rosario could serve as the left-handed half of a left-field platoon or hold the position down full time if Stone Garrett begins the season on the injured list.\n\nOther outfield candidates for Washington include Alex Call and Jacob Young, who are both on the Nats' 40-man roster and have minor-league options remaining. Top prospect James Wood has also turned heads with a stellar start to his Grapefruit League season.\n\nRosario is a lifetime .268/.305/.460 hitter with 159 home runs and 548 RBIs across parts of nine big-league seasons with Atlanta, Minnesota, and Cleveland. The Puerto Rico native has primarily played left field during his career but does have some experience manning the other two outfield spots."
