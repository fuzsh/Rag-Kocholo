        "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. – Managers aren’t always eager for the start of exhibition play. Some would prefer their guys get more time to work on things, more fundamental drills, more opportunities to face pitchers and hitters in controlled environments, before taking the field against another ballclub.\n\nDavey Martinez has felt that way some years. He doesn’t feel that way this year.\n\n“I am ready,” the Nationals manager said. “I’ve been here for a while, so I’m ready to get these games going. I’m looking forward to watching some of the guys, especially the guys I haven’t really seen play live.”\n\nMartinez and Co. won’t have to wait any longer. The Nats open Grapefruit League play this afternoon against the Cardinals in Jupiter. The first of 30 exhibition games before their March 30 opener against the Braves will offer everyone a first glimpse at the 2023 roster, though not everyone who is projected to be in the lineup five weeks from now.\n\nMartinez named four regulars who aren’t scheduled to play today: catcher Keibert Ruiz, first baseman Dominic Smith, third baseman Jeimer Candelario and left fielder Corey Dickerson. All are expected to play in one of Sunday’s split-squad games, either at home against the Astros or on the road against the Mets.\n\nWe should see the starting middle infield combo of CJ Abrams and Luis García, reigning 30-year-old rookie sensation Joey Meneses and outfielders Victor Robles and Lane Thomas. All will be going up against Cardinals veteran Adam Wainwright, back at age 41 for his 18th season in St. Louis.\n\nThe Nationals will send MacKenzie Gore, who celebrated his 24th birthday Friday, to the mound for his long-awaited club debut. The left-hander is likely to pitch only one inning, but everyone is curious to see how he looks after missing the second half of the 2022 season with elbow inflammation.\n\nErasmo Ramirez and Andres Machado are among the relievers scheduled to appear after Gore is done, with Martinez trying to make sure any of his players who are leaving camp for the World Baseball Classic in a couple weeks get as much work in as possible now.\n\nIn general, what is the manager looking for from his players in these first few games of the spring?\n\n“Working on their timing,” he said. “Try to stay on the fastball for now. For the pitchers, we work so much on trying to throw strike one. When they’re in 1-1 counts, I want to try to see them work ahead of hitters and be efficient. We know it’s day one. Just be ready.”\n\nEveryone better be ready, because everyone is going to be subject to the pitch clock this afternoon for the first time. Pitchers have 15 seconds from the time they receive the ball back from the catcher until they must deliver their pitch. If a runner is on base, they have 20 seconds. All batters must be in the box and ready to go with eight seconds left on the clock.\n\nHow significant is this rule change? Very. Each of the two Cactus League games contested Friday were completed in fewer than 2 hours, 34 minutes, with only one violation cited by umpires: The Padres’ Manny Machado was penalized an automatic strike for not being ready in the batter’s box on time."
