        "text": "Spring training begins when pitchers and catchers report to camp. They get right to work with daily workouts, which are open to the public. Some teams train in their spring ballparks, but most train on nearby training fields. These days walkways between diamonds and football fields are roped off for easy access, and there are bleachers and shade in many complexes as well. (Football fields? Many teams have installed football fields at their spring complexes for light workouts.) You won’t get run of the place, but you’ll usually have a good view of the action and potentially some access to players for autographs. Just remember: there’s no strict schedule for workouts (that’s why many start times are approximate), and meetings or other events may intrude into workout time. Here are each team’s tentative 2024 spring training workout schedules.\n\nThese schedules apply only to the period between reporting dates and the first games. Once games start, practices are seriously curtailed.\n\nARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS\n\nThe team practices at the diamonds adjoining Salt River Fields at Talking Stick, starting at 9:30 a.m., with the gates opening at 9 a.m., through 12:30 p.m. Fans park in the Desert Lot on the north side of the complex, best accessed via 90th Street off Via de Ventura. It’s a lovely experience to wander the fields and the ballpark; take the time to check out the Colorado Rockies practices as well.\n\nATLANTA BRAVES\n\nPractice starts at 9:30 a.m. at CoolToday Park and the adjacent practice fields.\n\nBALTIMORE ORIOLES\n\nThe Orioles train at the practice fields adjoining Ed Smith Stadium. Fans are invited to watch the team’s workouts on the back fields at the complex each day until March 4, when home games begin. Free parking is available in the East Lot off of 12th Street and Tuttle Avenue. The Orioles work out from approximately 9:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m. each day.\n\nBOSTON RED SOX\n\nThe Red Sox train at the practice fields adjoining JetBlue Park (11500 Fenway S. Dr., Fort Myers), with the gates opening at 9:30 a.m. and practices beginning at 10 a.m. Additionally, tours of JetBlue Park are also available throughout workouts and on all non-game days in February and March from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tickets for tours may be purchased from the JetBlue Park box office beginning at 9:45 a.m. and cost $10 per person with children 12 and under able to enter for free. Game-day VIP tour packages are also available and cost $40 per person and $15 for children 12 and under. These tours are offered on a first-come, first-served basis and must be prearranged in advance by calling 239/226-4772. Concessions and merchandise will be on sale during these workouts.\n\nCHICAGO CUBS\n\nThe Cubs practice at practice fields to the east of Sloan Park. The workout facility is separate from the ballpark. There’s plenty of parking next to the ballpark, and bleachers are installed next to the main workout field. Practices begin at 9:30 a.m.\n\nCHICAGO WHITE SOX\n\nThe team practices at the diamonds adjoining Camelback Ranch-Glendale, with gates to the complex opening at 9 a.m., beginning on February 14. This is one of the most sumptuous workout facilities, with manicured lawns and a rolling landscape: take the time to wander through and check out Los Angeles Dodgers practices as well.\n\nCINCINNATI REDS\n\nThe team practices at its Goodyear training complex, starting at 9 a.m. You can also walk over to the nearby Cleveland Guardians workout facility as well.\n\nCLEVELAND GUARDIANS\n\nThe team practices at its Goodyear training complex, starting at 9 a.m. Fans can view workouts at Field 1, at a fenced-in section down the third-base line. You can also walk over to the nearby Cincinnati Reds workout facility as well.\n\nCOLORADO ROCKIES\n\nThe team practices at the diamonds adjoining Salt River Fields at Talking Stick, starting at 9:30 a.m., with the gates opening at 9 a.m., through 12:30 p.m. It’s a lovely experience to wander the fields and the ballpark; take the time to check out the Arizona Diamondbacks practices as well.\n\nDETROIT TIGERS\n\nThe Tiger Town complex encompasses four practice fields in a cloverleaf layout, Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium, and Kaline Field, a small diamond located past the Joker Marchant Stadium left-field corner. Before the start of spring training all practices take place on the four cloverleaf fields and Kaline Field. A roped-off path runs between the practice fields and the clubhouse, and that’s the place to snare players once they leave practice, which traditionally has begun at 9:30 a.m. (Tip: You can always watch practices at Kaline Field from Granada Street, even if the facility is closed to the public.)\n\nOnce games start, the minor leaguers take over the cloverleaf fields, with the major-league squad decamping to Kaline Field or Joker Marchant Stadium.\n\nHOUSTON ASTROS\n\nThe team trains on the practice fields at Ballpark of the Palm Beaches training complex. Gates open at 9:30 a.m., beginning Feb. 16, until games start. The Astros/Nationals Team Store at the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches will be open to the public beginning on Feb. 15.

(Roberto Clemente Memorial Drive), with morning workouts beginning at 9:45 a.m. daily. If you go to Pirate City: Park at the River Run golf course located south of the gated Pirate City entrance and enter through the south side of the property to access the fields. When spring-training games begin, the Pirates shift morning workouts to LECOM Park, while the minor-leaguers continue to work out at Pirate City.\n\nSAN DIEGO PADRES\n\nThe San Diego Padres begin practices at 9:30 a.m. in the outlying practice fields at the Peoria Sports Complex.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO GIANTS\n\nThe Giants practice at Scottsdale Stadium.
