        "text": "LAKELAND | It's been a whirlwind year for the Detroit Tigers.\n\nComing off a fourth-straight playoff appearance, the team has opened the 2015 season atop the American League Central. The organization also agreed to a new, 20-year contract with the city of Lakeland earlier this year that commits the Tigers to a 100th year training here.\n\nBut how well did the Tigers do in attendance compared with other teams training in Florida?\n\n\"They're winning,\" said Ron Myers, director of Florida operations for the Tigers. \"They have a very successful team. We may want to take credit as geniuses for marketing, but the whole bulk of the success is it's a winning team and it's a popular team.\"\n\nThe Tigers finished third in Grapefruit League attendance this spring, drawing 134,377 fans to Joker Marchant Stadium. That ranks behind two of baseball's most popular teams — the Boston Red Sox (148,862 fans) and the New York Yankees (171,915).\n\nBoston and New York boast stadiums that can hold more than 11,000 fans. Joker Marchant Stadium, in its current form, has a maximum capacity of 9,200 and that number will remain even after the stadium's renovations are complete in 2017.\n\nThose renovations will include grandstand-style seating in place of the left field bleachers, which Bill Tinsley, Lakeland's liaison to the Detroit Tigers, described as \"bettering the ticket experience.\"\n\nDetroit's high attendance is a reflection of its long-standing relationship with Lakeland. Tinsley noted that the franchise has grown synonymous with the city and that many snowbirds who make Lakeland their winter home hail from Michigan.\n\nIt doesn't hurt having stars like Miguel Cabrera and Justin Verlander to go with the winning.\n\n\"They have star power,\" Tinsley said. \"The Yankees have star power; the Red Sox have star power. Other clubs have to stretch to have that level of Justin Verlander or Miguel Cabrera or (Victor) Martinez-type star power in their lineups.\"\n\nIn terms of average attendance, the Tigers ranked No. 5 with 7,905 fans per game; a 5 percent decrease from the 2014 average of 8,302 fans. Myers attributed that decline, in part, to a late-starting spring in which the Tigers played three games in April, when many snowbirds head home.\n\nThe Grapefruit League plays host to 15 of Major League Baseball's 30 teams. Arizona's Cactus League features the other half.\n\nAlthough teams like the Tigers, Yankees or Red Sox have no trouble drawing fans, the same cannot be said about in-state teams. The Tampa Bay Rays and Miami Marlins struggle to consistently draw during the regular season. That same issue plagued them during spring training this year; despite training within an hour and a half of their home stadiums.\n\nThe Rays ranked No. 12 in Grapefruit League attendance, drawing 80,406 fans to Port Charlotte. Miami, which trains in Jupiter, sat one slot lower with 70,982 fans.\n\nMaureen Broderick, recreation division manager for Charlotte County, said the Rays' contract with Charlotte County was signed in September 2006 and runs through 2026.\n\nThe Rays declined to comment on their low attendance. Rick Vaughn, the team's vice president of communications, said the organization is \"pleased with the level of support Charlotte County has shown the Rays both in the park and in the community.\"\n\n\"During our seven years at Charlotte Sports Park, we have enjoyed 22 sellouts and experienced seven of the top eight best attended spring seasons in our 18-year history,\" Vaughn said in an email.\n\nTampa Bay's top-drawing game was their spring finale against the Tigers at Tropicana Field. That game drew 8,934 fans. It was the second time this spring that an opponent drew its largest crowd while hosting Detroit.\n\nThey also drew a spring high of 9,018 fans in Bradenton against the Pittsburgh Pirates on March 18.\n\n\"That's manifested — if you really break the numbers down — throughout the Grapefruit League, the Tigers draw extremely well on the road,\" Tinsley said. \"They take starters on the road, even if it doesn't matter where the travel is. That consistency of bringing their strong players has been an important market.\"\n\n[ Brady Fredericksen can be reached at brady.fredericksen@theledger.com or 863-802-7553.
