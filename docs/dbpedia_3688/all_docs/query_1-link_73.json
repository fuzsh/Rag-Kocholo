        "text": "Orioles vs. Red Sox, 2:10 ET\n\nSports betting requires a lot of things for you to be successful. You need to be smart with your money, that’s the number one requirement and I can tell you right now if you’re not, you will fail. You need to have confidence. You need to know when to pull back, and when to push forward. There are times you’re going to feel like the worst bettor in the world, and times when you’re the best. January of this year, I had one of my worst NBA months ever. February I got it all back and then some (this goes back to the money management part). The daily grind of betting can be difficult and with the long baseball season, you have to be able to navigate it all. That’s what I’m here to help you with! Today, I’m looking to get a win on the board in a game between the Orioles and the Red Sox.\n\nBaltimore is one of those teams that I have a soft spot for. Don’t get me wrong, I won’t blindly bet on them because I like them. But most people have an AL team and an NL team. My AL team is the Orioles. I like the colors, logo, ball park, and despite them having poor results for years, the franchise. These past two seasons though have started to turn things around for them as they are one of the best teams in baseball. Unfortunately for them, it hasn’t really turned into postseason success and they didn’t have an Ace before this year. They went out and got Corbin Burnes who starts today and now do have a true Ace on the staff to hopefully navigate some of the playoffs for them. Burnes has been very good in his two starts this season, going 11.2 innings and allowing just three earned runs. Most of the Red Sox hitters are not familiar with him – only one hitter has more than two at-bats against him. He’s only allowed three hits in 21 at-bats and has set down 11 on strikeouts.\n\nThe Red Sox were expected to really struggle this season and likely end in last place within the division. I suppose when you’re in the toughest division in baseball, it makes sense for you to be picked last if you finished the last season near the bottom and didn’t do much to improve your club. That doesn't mean the Red Sox team is actively trying to lose or has no talent. I think them being picked to be last is more of a reflection on the quality of their division than anything. Today, Brayan Bello takes the hill for Boston and he is off to a mixed bag to begin the year. He allowed just two earned runs over five innings against the Mariners in the opener, but he allowed four earned runs over five innings to the lowly Athletics. Orioles hitters have been decent against him, hitting .258 collectively.\n\nThis is a good value spot for Corbin Burnes as he heads on the road against a solid Red Sox squad. There aren't too many times that I expect Burnes to be -135 this season and I will take the Orioles to win this game. I know it will cost a bit more to play just the first five innings, so I won't go that route here, but I do think that is the safer bet. Take the Orioles in this one and let's have Burnes look like the Ace he is."
