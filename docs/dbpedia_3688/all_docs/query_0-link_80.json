        "text": "WEST PALM BEACH — Washington Nationals ace Max Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young award winner, hates to give an inch during the regular season. But even he can appreciate adversity when it doesn’t count.\n\nScherzer, who started Thursday night’s spring training game against the Houston Astros at Fitteam Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, endured a shaky first inning before settling down. The Nationals and Astros finished in a 5-5 tie after nine innings.\n\n“You don’t want to go three-up, three-down all the time,” Scherzer said after allowing two runs, one earned, in three innings. “You want broken-bat hits to fall, you want to face some adversity. Having to work out of a jam, that’s exactly what you’re looking for.”\n\nMaking his second start this spring, Scherzer allowed two hits, a fielder’s choice RBI and a walk in the troubled opening frame. Houston’s Garrett Stubbs had an RBI single to give the Astros a quick 2-0 lead.\n\n“In the (regular) season you’re gonna face that, I don’t care who you are,” Scherzer said. “You’re going to be facing lineups where you’re in big situations and have to make big pitches. If you don’t get that in spring training, you’re not battle-tested.\n\n“I welcome it — you want it. You want to get battle-tested in the spring to know how to make big pitches out of the stretch.”\n\nAfter the first inning, Scherzer made quick work of Houston’s lineup in the second and third. He struck out three of the next four hitters, and then induced a double-play after allowing a single to Yuli Gurriel.\n\nBefore Thursday’s game, Nationals manager Dave Martinez said the coaching staff doesn’t focus on specific results for their right-hander at this point, as long as he progresses toward the regular-season opener.\n\n“It’s building up his pitch count,” Martinez said. “We watch Max’s mechanics a lot, especially early. That’s one of the biggest things, making sure he’s not getting ahead of himself. His first outing was really good, so we’ll build from there.”\n\nScherzer allowed three hits, one walk and two wild pitches Thursday, while striking out five. He threw 49 total pitches, including 33 for strikes.\n\n“I responded well,” he said of the second and third innings. “I was able to make an adjustment off my last start, and I wanted to get better glove-side location with my fastball. I felt like I was able to do that.\n\n“I talked to (Nationals catcher Kurt Suzuki) between innings — what we wanted to do, different sequences we wanted to work on. We were able to execute some pitches in the second.”\n\nAs Scherzer and the Nationals prepare to defend their 2019 World Series championship, he said the exhibition season gives him a chance to sharpen his pitches and build stamina for the summer’s long grind.\n\n“Making adjustments between starts, that’s what you look for,” Scherzer said. “I’m not looking at any opponents right now. For me, I’m going out there and trying to throw my game. It’s trying to get a feel for my pitches, trying to find the zone.”"
