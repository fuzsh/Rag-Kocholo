Fort Myers has the good fortune to welcome two teams from the Florida Grapefruit League: the Minnesota Twins and the Boston Red Sox. Learn more about the long legacy of spring training in Fort Myers and click here for tickets.\n\nDiehard fans make the trip every season to see their favorite teams take the field. This year is no exception, as there are minimal repercussions from Hurricane Ian, and the stadiums are ready for action. If you’ve never attended spring training before, you’re in for a treat. Enjoy intimate games under the Florida sun, hang around other baseball fans — and maybe even your favorite players — and get to know the up and comers. The vibe is friendly, relaxed and welcoming to all ages.\n\nSince 2012, the Boston Red Sox have called JetBlue Park their springtime home. Complete with its own Green Monster, the 11,000-seat facility known as “Fenway South” gives you the best of Boston without the seasonal cold weather.\n\nWatch the Minnesota Twins play at Hammond Stadium, located within the larger Lee Health Sports Complex. Next to Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve, the complex is also home to the Fort Myers Mighty Mussels and the Florida Complex League Twins."
