        "text": "Baseball is back in Florida. Spring training was cut short last season by the COVID-19 pandemic, but Major League Baseball is bringing teams back to warm up for the 2021 season.\n\nAll five Grapefruit League teams on Florida's East Coast will have COVID protocols in place for spring training. The New York Mets will allow 20% capacity at Clover Park in Port St. Lucie. In Jupiter, the St. Louis Cardinals and Miami Marlins will have 21% capacity (about 1,500 fans) at Roger Dean Stadium.\n\nThe Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, home to the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals, have not announced its stadium capacity for spring training but said it would sell single-game tickets in one- to six-seat pods, similar to what the Mets, Cardinals and Marlins are doing.\n\nMore: Will there be baseball in Florida? What we know about 2021 MLB Spring Training\n\nOpinion: Spring training looks different in a pandemic. But it's still baseball.\n\nHere's a look at the spring training schedules for all five Grapefruit League teams on the East:\n\nNew York Mets\n\nWhere: Clover Park, Port St. Lucie\n\nTickets: Mets team site\n\nSpring training like no other: Fewer games, fewer seats and no place to get autographs at Mets games\n\nCOVID restrictions: Capacity at Clover Park will be limited to 20%, or about 1,400 fans. Tickets will be sold in pods of one to six seats, and reselling or forwarding portions of a seat pod is prohibited. Masks will be required at the stadium, and fans must remain 6 feet apart from anyone not in their seating pod. No bags will be allowed except for medical reasons or diaper bags.\n\nOne big thing: The Mets have a new owner in Steve Cohen, and with him has come an influx of big names to keep up in a stacked NL East. Chief among the new additions are star shortstop Francisco Lindor and starting pitcher Carlos Carrasco, who both came over in a six-player deal with Cleveland.\n\nMets schedule: The Mets get spring training started Monday, March 1, in Jupiter against the Marlins. Their home opener is Tuesday, March 2, against the Astros. The Mets will welcome the Astros, Nationals, Cardinals and Marlins to Clover Park three times each.\n\nScenes of spring: Mets begin spring training without fans amid COVID-19 precautions\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals/Miami Marlins\n\nWhere: Roger Dean Stadium, Jupiter\n\nTickets: Cardinals team site, Marlins team site\n\nCOVID restrictions: Roger Dean Stadium will be reduced to 21% capacity, or about 1,500 fans. A designated entry gate will be noted on each ticket. Masks will be required at all times, and the stadium will be mostly cashless, with mobile ticketing in place and concession and ticketing stands accepting credit and debit only.\n\nPlay ball! Q-and-A on Palm Beach County spring training games\n\nOne big thing about the Cardinals: Nolan Arenado, one of the top offensive and defensive third basemen in the baseball, was traded from the Colorado Rockies over the offseason. Will Arenado and first baseman Paul Goldschmidt provide enough power to get the Cards back atop the NL Central?\n\nCardinals schedule: The Cardinals start spring training Sunday, Feb. 28, in Jupiter against the Nationals. They face their ballpark neighbors, the Marlins, six times and host the Mets, Astros and Nats three times apiece.\n\nOne big thing about the Marlins: The Marlins were one of the surprise teams in the shortened 2020 season, grabbing one of the eight NL playoff spots and beating the Cubs in the wild-card round. Whether they can repeat that success will depend on the development of their young starting pitchers, especially Sandy Alcantara and Sixto Sanchez.\n\nMarlins schedule: The Marlins open spring training Sunday, Feb. 28, at the Astros and play their first home game Monday, March 1, against the Mets. They play the Cardinals six times and host the Mets, Astros and Nationals three times apiece.\n\nHouston Astros/Washington Nationals\n\nWhere: Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach\n\nTickets: Astros team site, Nationals team site\n\nCOVID restrictions: Tickets will be available in pods of one to six seats, and the pods cannot be split among parties. Reselling or forwarding portions of a seat pod is prohibited. Cash will not be accepted at the ballpark or parking lots.\n\nMore: Astros manager Dusty Baker hoping to convince those ‘on the fence’ to get COVID vaccine\n\nAstros schedule: The Astros open spring training in West Palm Beach on Sunday, Feb. 28, vs. the Marlins. The Astros face their home partners, the Nationals, six times, and they also host the Marlins, Cardinals and Mets three times each.\n\nOne big thing about the Astros: George Springer, who had played center field and led off the dangerous Astros lineup since the team's resurgence in 2015, left in free agency for the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nNationals schedule: The Nationals' open spring training in Jupiter against the Cardinals on Sunday, Feb. 28, and their first home game is Monday, March 1 vs. the Astros. The Nationals play the Astros six times, and they host the Mets, Cardinals and Marlins three times each."
