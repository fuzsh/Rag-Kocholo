        "text": "better fixed in memory.\n\nAngell's observation suggests another dynamic fueling the Cactus League: competition for spring training with Florida.\n\nThe Arizona circuit is decidedly junior. The Cactus League first fielded more than one major league club in 1947 while the Grapefruit League dates back 75 years to 1914. And the Cactus League has always been the smaller of the two, currently fielding eight teams to the Florida circuit's eighteen. Still, the discrepancies between the two leagues, in terms of longevity and size, have done little to lessen arguments about which league is \"best.\"\n\nThese friendly but vigorous disputes commenced the first spring major league clubs called Arizona their winter home. Arizona supporters solicited more teams to locate in their state, citing Florida's inhospitable March rains and late-winter chills. The Florida towns, reacting to the threat of a major-league exodus, reminded their ballclubs of Arizona's sandstorms, the greater travel distances involved (remember, it was not until 1958 that the majors had a home town west of St. Louis), and the shortage of other major league opponents for exhibition games.\n\nThe ballplayers themselves often got caught up in comparing the relative benefits of the two training and exhibition leagues. Bob Feller, ace right-hander of the Cleveland Indians, was asked about the suitability of Arizona's climate for conditioning a pitcher's arm. It was the spring of 1948, the second spring the Tribe trained in Tucson. Rapid Robert, who had enjoyed the agreeable weather of Fort Myers and Clearwater, Florida in previous years, reportedly said, \"I don't think it's good for a pitcher out here (Arizona).\" The dry heat, he explained, made it tough for players to work up a sweat and loosen up. Mel Ott, the manager of the New York Giants who had trained in Phoenix the previous year, laughed when told of Feller's remark: \"What's he complaining about after the season he had last year?\" The manager had a point. After preseason training in Tucson in 1947, Feller proceeded to lead the American League in wins, games started, strikeouts, shutouts, and innings pitched with a whopping 299.\n\nThe controversy persists and probably always will. Yet for most spring training fans, there's no real argument. The Cactus and Grapefruit Leagues are each immensely enjoyable, Arizona and Florida are each fascinating and unique. The real dilemma for patrons of exhibition baseball is wishing they could be both places at once.\n\n1929: The First Camp\n\nAlthough no major league team was west of St. Louis until 1958, teams had been training out west as early as 1903, the Chicago Cubs' first year in Los Angeles. In 1905 the Cubs moved to Santa Monica. Spring training stops followed in Champaign, Ill., New Orleans, La., Vicksburg, Miss., Hot Springs, Ark., and Tampa, Fla., before the ballclub settled in Pasadena, Calif. from 1917 to 1921. Then came Catalina Island, off the coast of Los Angeles, the Cubs' winter home from 1922 through 1951.\n\nOther teams that headed to California for spring training in early years were the New York Giants in Los Angeles in 1907, the Chicago White Sox in L.A. in 1908, and the Boston Red Sox at Redondo Beach in 1908. The White Sox moved north to San Francisco for spring training in 1909 and 1910.\n\nIt was not until 1929, however, that the first spring training game was played in Arizona, when the Detroit Tigers hosted the Pittsburgh Pirates at Phoenix on the afternoon of March 26. As reported by Sam Greene in the January 17, 1929 issue of The Sporting News: \"After preliminary skirmishes among themselves at Phoenix, the Tigers will play their first exhibition game versus the Cubs at Los Angeles on March 20th. Four more games follow on succeeding days and the Tigers return to Phoenix to face the Pirates March 26th, and the Cubs the following day. That night the team will leave Phoenix for good and make its way home by way of El Paso, Houston, Beaumont, Fort Worth and Shreveport.\" In all, twenty-three exhibition games were booked that spring for the Tigers.\n\nWhat brought the Tigers to Phoenix in 1929? Several reasons are hinted at in the accounts of the day. The Tigers of the 1920s were a decent team that, while successful, had never finished higher than second place in the American League. As the decade wore on, the team slipped into the league's second division. Ty Cobb was player-manager from 1921 through 1926, posting winning seasons in all but his first. With players like Cobb, Heinie Manush, Harry Heilmann and a young second baseman named Charlie Gehringer, the Tigers were a high-scoring club. But their pitching was shaky at best and certainly not capable of keeping the rival New York Yankees' bats in check. In fact, the '20s belonged to the Bronx Bombers, who averaged better than 93 wins a year during that period, and won six American League pennants.\n\nCobb's last year as manager was 1926. After the season, he summed up his tenure with his usual tact: \"Maybe I was not a managerial success, but just as surely I was not a managerial failure. What we could have done with a couple of pitchers! If I'd had them, the Yankees would have had to wait a few years to become the terrors of baseball. In every other way but pitching, we spit in their eye.\"\n\nIn 1927, former Detroit third baseman George Moriarty gave up his job as an American League umpire to manage the Tigers. The ballclub finished the season with an 82-71 record, but in 1928 bad trades and aging stars caused the bottom to fall out: future Hall-of-Famer Carl Hubbell was sold to the Giants for $40,000, home attendance dropped 300,000 to 475,000, and late in the season the Tigers played before their smallest home crowd in history, a cozy 404. Mercifully, Moriarty was allowed to take up umpiring again in 1929.\n\nThe spring of 1929 found the organization eager to make changes. Owner Frank Navin brought in 32-year-old former Washington Senators manager Stanley Raymond (\"Bucky\") Harris to run the team. Navin and Harris developed spring training plans during a two-day meeting in early January, deciding that Phoenix would be their training site. The idea of training in Phoenix may originally have come from Jack Zeiler, one of Navin's western scouts, who made most of the arrangements for the encampment of the Tigers in Phoenix. Zeiler was the first to promote Phoenix and Arizona as locations for spring training baseball. He wrote back to Detroit at length about the suitability of the Phoenix area for baseball training.\n\nTicket sales were up that year in Detroit, but the team was down. The Tigers finished the regular season 70-84, 36 games out of first place. After that finish, owner Navin decided Arizona had not much to offer in terms of preparing a ballclub for the upcoming season. The Tigers did not return to Phoenix, and have not been back to Arizona since.\n\nChanging Face of Baseball\n\nDuring the 1930s nearly all teams conducted spring training in either Florida or California. There were exceptions, with teams playing in San Antonio, Biloxi, Savannah, New Orleans, Lake Charles, and even as far south as Mexico City, Puerto Rico, and Havana. But these stays usually lasted only a year or two. Interestingly, the two '30s teams that chose training camp sites outside of Florida or California -- the Cleveland Indians and the New York Giants -- were the first to set up permanent camps in Arizona after the war.\n\nThe war changed everything. Baseball commissioner Kennesaw Mountain Landis established the Potomac Line, barring teams from training west of the Mississippi River or south of the Potomac River from 1943 to 1945. The line was drawn up in conjunction with the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation in an effort to relieve the overcrowded railways which were being used to carry troops and supplies. The two St. Louis and two Chicago teams were allowed to train in Missouri, Indiana, or Illinois.\n\nSpring training articles from the war years often reminisced about better days in warmer climes with more hospitable surroundings, with one writer referring to the annual preseason preparations as \"The Battle of the Chilbains.\" Not surprisingly, then, the game went through some major changes in 1946, and attendance climbed to more than 18 million, a 70 percent increase above the 1945 gate.\n\nAt the same time, players formed a committee demanding minimum salaries, a pension fund, and shorter spring training schedules. The threat of unionization and the raiding of major league rosters by the Mexican League (numerous signings and suspensions resulted) signaled the beginning of change in the conduct of the game. Baseball was poised to be included in America's post-war boom.\n\nThe Cactus League is Born\n\nArizona newspapers of the period mention that the \"Cactus League\" first took root in 1945 when the Cleveland Indians persuaded the New York Giants to join them in Arizona for spring training. Those discussions may have gone on, yet 1946 saw the Indians training in Clearwater while the Giants were in Miami.\n\nBoth teams, however, were owned by men eager to take advantage of what the times offered. Horace Stoneham of the Giants and Bill Veeck of the Indians were instrumental in bringing the game to Arizona in the spring of 1947. Stoneham recalls getting a phone call from a friend:"
