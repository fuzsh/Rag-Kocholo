        "text": "There's an old saying that \"it's not spring until pitchers and catchers report.\"\n\nThankfully, that's coming soon, with Atlanta asking the pitchers and catchers to report to CoolToday Park in North Port, FL next week! They're due on Wednesday, February 14th, with the first official workout will be held the following day, on Thursday the 15th.\n\nThe first full squad workout for the 2024 Atlanta Braves isn't scheduled until the following Tuesday, February 20th, but any early arriving position players (which there will be plenty) will participate in batting practice and other side work prior to Tuesday.\n\nAtlanta's first game of Spring Training is versus the Tampa Bay Rays on February 24th, at 1:05 PM ET. The Rays play in Port Charlotte, FL at Charlotte Sports Park, a 12.4 mile drive between the two fields.\n\nHere's what you need to know about 2024 spring training:\n\nHow many games will Atlanta play?\n\nThere's thirty games on Atlanta's Grapefruit League schedule, including two days of simultaneous \"split squad\" games. The team wraps spring training with back to back matchups against the Minnesota Twins on March 25th and 26th, prior to heading north for Opening Day against Philadelphia on March 28th.\n\nA full schedule is available on MLB.com/Braves.\n\nHow do we watch spring training games?\n\nFor many of them, you don't. Full broadcast information hasn't yet been released, but typically, only a handful of games are broadcast. We do have word that Brandon Gaudin and new analyst C.J. Nitkowski are calling the final four home games, matchups against the Toronto Blue Jays (March 20th), New York Yankees (March 21st), Tampa Bay Rays (March 23rd), and Minnesota Twins (March 25th).\n\nThe full slate of games will be available on the Braves Radio Network with friend of the pod Ben Ingram, so rekindle your love of baseball on the radio.\n\nAll games, both road and away, are open to the public and tickets are available on braves.com.\n\nWhat's this \"Spring Breakout\" prospect thing?\n\nA great idea by MLB, that's what.\n\nEach team will pit their top prospects against another team's top prospects during the third weekend of March. Atlanta's top minor leaguers will head to Ft. Myers to take on the Boston Red Sox on March 16th.\n\nNo word on if that game's televised, but that's probably the most anticipated matchup of the Grapefruit League slate for the Braves Today staff, so look forward to plenty of coverage of that one.\n\nCan fans attend practices at the facility?\n\nYes, actually! Beginning on February 18th, the Green Gate (all days) and Gate Three (away games only) will open daily at 9 AM ET for access to the backfields. It's common to be able to walk up to the fence and watch minor league action on the backfields, with a chance to see the stars of tomorrow playing with other minor leaguers in front of thirty to fifty spectators.\n\nTake plenty of pictures and tag us in them when you share them to social media!\n\nWho will be in camp for the Braves?\n\nThe entire 40-man roster and all non-roster invitees will begin in major league camp. Throughout the month of March, guys eventually get reassigned to minor league camp until the roster's set at 26 prior to the team leaving for Philadelphia.\n\nWe've got lists of both the current 40-man roster and the non-roster invitees for you.\n\nStay tuned to Braves Today for full coverage of spring training and the 2024 regular season!\n\nImportant Braves Today Offseason Stories\n\n2023 MLB Free Agent Rankings\n\nCurrent Atlanta Braves prospect rankings\n\nCurrent Atlanta Braves 40-man roster\n\n2024 International Free Agency tracker"
