        "text": "As baseball fans, attending MLB Spring Training has been on our bucket list for a very long time! So we're excited to head to Florida to experience Spring Training games for the Grapefruit League!\n\nMajor League Baseball teams are divided into two distinct groups: teams in the Cactus League train in Arizona, while the Grapefruit League teams train in Florida.\n\nSince this was our first time participating in the Spring Training tradition enjoyed by so many baseball fans watching their favorite teams over the years, we decided to start with Grapefruit League Games to see get an up close, preseason look at our favorite players and Florida teams including our own Houston Astros!\n\nFlorida Spring Training baseball spans throughout the entire State of Florida. Teams train on the Gulf Coast, Atlantic Coast and a bit inland from Tampa south to Fort Myers and West Palm.\n\nFlorida Grapefruit League teams include:\n\nFrom our basecamp in South Florida, we were just a short drive away from three spring training facilities which are home to five MLB teams. In this video, we visit\n\nClover Park in Port St Lucie, Florida - spring training home of the New York Mets and minor league team facility for the Single-A St Lucie Mets,\n\nRoger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Florida - spring training home of the major league teams Miami Marlins and St Louis Cardinals and minor league facility for the Single-A Jupiter Hammerheads and Palm Beach Cardinals,\n\nand the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach, Florida - spring training home of the Houston Astros and Washington Nationals\n\nWe were lucky in 2023 and got a bonus: this was a World Baseball Classic year and we saw several warmup games between international teams and MLB teams as part of Spring Training!\n\nWe had an absolute blast visiting not just the Astros Spring Training Facility to see a single baseball game, but all of the ballparks. And though we are excited for the regular season, there is something about Spring Training that is special. It's about the teams... yes. It's about the upcoming season... yes. It's about getting that first look at some of the new, up and coming, future faces of the team and returning veterans on baseball fields that you don't normally see them play on. But most of all, it's about baseball. It's about enjoying a spring day at the ballpark and welcoming back the game amongst a community of fellow baseball fans, no matter what team they root for.\n\nWe can't wait until the next game schedules are public and Spring Training starts again next year!\n\nTips for Visiting Spring Training in Florida\n\nPlan Ahead! Keep an eye out for the schedule releases for the teams you want to see. Airline tickets, RV resorts and hotels can sell out during Spring Training. This is a very popular time of the year to visit South Florida. Prices may be higher during Spring Training as well. Planning ahead can help you get some better deals and avoid surprises.\n\nEach ballpark handles parking and concessions differently. Study the websites for the stadiums you want to visit so that you'll know what to expect.\n\nTicket prices may be dynamic based on ticket sales. You might get a better deal if you purchase your tickets in advance. Some stadiums also sell parking passes online.\n\nOn game day, plan to arrive early. You can beat the traffic and crowd arrivals and you might be able to go to the back fields to watch the home team warm up.\n\nMany of the stadiums are cashless now. Be prepared to pay for everything with a credit card.\n\nMost stadiums have strict security rules on what is allowed inside the ballpark. Save yourself some time and leave purses, bags, food and drinks at the hotel or RV.\n\nTake the time to visit multiple stadiums while you are here. Each one is unique with its own personality and stories to tell.\n\nOur Basecamp for This Visit\n\nð Motorcoach Resort St Lucie West in Port St Lucie, Florida\n\nFor More Information on Attending Spring Training in Florida\n\nVisit the Florida Spring Training Information Website for the Grapefruit League\n\nSpring Training Fun Facts\n\nA Few Photos from Our Spring Training Experience"
