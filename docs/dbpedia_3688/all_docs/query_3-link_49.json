        "text": "DAYTONA\n\nDaytona Tortugas (Cincinnati Reds A affiliate)\n\nBallpark: Jackie Robinson Ballpark, which opened in 1914, qualifies as a bona fide pilgrimage site for baseball fans. It was known as City Island Ball Park when Daytona became the first city to allow the African-American Robinson to play in a game during spring training in 1946. His AAA Montreal Royals took on their Brooklyn Dodgers parent club in an exhibition game after Jacksonville and Sanford refused to allow it because of segregation laws. Robinson broke the Major League Baseball color barrier the following year. The ballpark was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. “The Jack” has been updated from time to time, but retains a nostalgic feel (the grandstand still dates to the ‘60s) that hardball fanatics are sure to love.\n\nThings to do: Daytona bills itself as the “World’s Most Famous Beach” for a reason. Beyond the Main Street Boardwalk and Pier at the center of the beach and the adjacent Joyland Amusement Center, there’s also the Daytona Lagoon water park for those hotter days. Racing fans can catch an event at Daytona International Speedway, including the Daytona 500 each February. This is a big motorcycling Mecca, as well, with Daytona Beach Bike Week in the spring and Biketoberfest in the fall both bookending baseball season.\n\nDOUBLE DUTY\n\nThe following teams all play in ballparks that share the trait of serving as spring training homes for their Major League parent clubs. Here’s an overview of each team, but if you want more information, check out our Spring Training guide to learn more about the ballparks and things to do.\n\nBRADENTON\n\nBradenton Marauders (Pittsburgh Pirates A affiliate)\n\nBallpark: LECOM Park is the second-oldest stadium among Florida’s minor league ballparks. The Spanish mission-style design helps it retain its personality after a renovation about a decade ago.\n\nThings to do: The ballpark is smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood, with the Village of the Arts and Red Barn Flea Market nearby and the beaches of Anna Maria Island a short drive away.\n\nCLEARWATER\n\nClearwater Threshers (Philadelphia Phillies A affiliate)\n\nBallpark: Spectrum Field is a modern ballpark easily accessible from U.S. Highway 19, with a tiki bar, berm seating and a playground for the kids. The concessions stands feature authentic cheese steaks and water ice to cater to the Philadelphia faithful.\n\nThings to do: Clearwater Beach is a world-famous, sugar-sand waterfront, with the Clearwater Marine Aquarium along the way.\n\nDUNEDIN\n\nDunedin Blue Jays (Toronto Blue Jays A affiliate)\n\nBallpark: TD Ballpark is all-new and improved for 2020, thanks to a just-completed expansion to increase the number (and quality) of seats, build a walkway around the outfield and spruce up the eating and drinking options.\n\nThings to do: Dunedin is a popular and walkable small city, with a Main Street filled with local options — no chains allowed. The undeveloped beaches of Caladesi Island and Honeymoon Island state parks are just a couple of miles away.\n\nFORT MYERS\n\nFort Myers Mighty Mussels (Minnesota Twins A affiliate)\n\nBallpark: The exterior of Hammond Stadium was inspired by Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, and is highlighted by a waterfall. The ballpark was drastically enhanced in 2015 with a $42.5 million renovation.\n\nThings to do: Nearby Sanibel Island is a big draw, with unparalleled shelling thanks to fortuitous ocean currents. See how Thomas Edison and Henry Ford lived at their winter estates, or be on the lookout for endangered big cats at the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nJUPITER\n\nJupiter Hammerheads (Miami Marlins A affiliate) and Palm Beach Cardinals (St. Louis Cardinals A affiliate)\n\nBallpark: Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium is home to two teams both in the Grapefruit League and the Florida State League. Seats are up close and personal, just like the stadium, which is surrounded by a planned community filled with homes plus shopping and dining options.\n\nThings to do: Jupiter is just north of the Palm Beach area’s tony shopping, but is also close to the massive Jonathan Dickinson State Park and Blowing Rocks Preserve on Jupiter Island.\n\nLAKELAND\n\nLakeland Flying Tigers (Detroit Tigers A affiliate)\n\nBallpark: Joker Marchant Stadium, which last was renovated in 2017, is home to Tigertown. Detroit has had a spring training relationship with Lakeland since 1934, the longest in the majors, and the devotion shows. The stadium is huge and pays tribute to the Motor City at every turn.\n\nThings to do: Downtown Lakeland’s Lake Mirror is a hip spot for a drink or a bite to eat. Florida Southern College is a showcase of architecture by the famed Frank Lloyd Wright, with regular tours for visitors.\n\nPORT ST. LUCIE\n\nSt. Lucie Mets (New York Mets A affiliate)\n\nBallpark: First Data Stadium recalls the days of Shea, complete with Nathan’s Famous hot dogs. Berm seating is popular, are as the largely shaded seats behind home plate. It also has what may be the easiest-to-navigate parking lot in the minors.\n\nThings to do: PGA Golf Club at PGA Village is a chip shot away from the stadium. Nearby Hutchinson Island is loaded with options for outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nTAMPA"
