        "text": "Hush, sweet Charlotte. The Tampa Bay Rays are back in town.\n\nFlorida’s spring training season begins for 15 Major League Baseball teams next month. That includes the Tampa Bay Rays, who return to their Port Charlotte facility after a year away because of damage caused from Hurricane Ian.\n\nThe Rays, who have called Port Charlotte their spring home since 2009, trained last year at the ESPN Wide World of Sports in Osceola County and played home games at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg.\n\nHowever, nearly $20 million in repairs were recently completed at 82-acre Charlotte Sports Park stadium and practice facility, meaning Manager Kevin Cash’s squad will be back in their comfort zone.\n\nThe Grapefruit League, as spring training is known in Florida, begins when pitchers and catchers arrive at camps Feb. 14 and 15. Full-squad workouts commence Feb. 18-20. The Rays’ battery is due Feb. 14, with the remaining players arriving by Feb. 19.\n\nThe Rays will hold its annual Fan Fest at Tropicana Field from 1 to 5 p.m. Feb. 17.\n\nArizona's Cactus League begins the exhibition slate Feb. 22 with the Los Angeles Dodgers playing the San Diego Padres All 30 MLB clubs play Feb. 24, including Tampa Bay, which will host the Atlanta Braves at 1:05 p.m.\n\nThe Rays will have one significant road trip March 9-10, when they head to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, for two games against the Boston Red Sox.\n\nOtherwise, they won’t be far from Port Charlotte. In addition to home games at Charlotte Sports Park, the Rays have a handful of road games in the greater Tampa Bay area:\n\nFeb. 26 and March 12 in Sarasota (vs. Baltimore Orioles)\n\nFeb. 28 in Dunedin (vs. Toronto Blue Jays)\n\nMarch 1 and 17 in Bradenton (vs. Pittsburgh Pirates)\n\nMarch 6 in Tampa (vs. New York Yankees)\n\nMarch 21 and 25 in Clearwater (vs. Philadelphia Phillies)\n\nMarch 24 in Lakeland (vs. Detroit Tigers)\n\nThe Rays’ final prep comes at Tropicana Field on March 26 against Detroit.\n\nThe “official” regular season Opening Day is scheduled for March 28, with the Rays at the Trop against Toronto at 4:10 p.m. to begin a four-game series.\n\nTechnically, the season begins a week earlier in South Korea, where the Padres and Dodgers meet in the “Seoul Series” on March 20-21.\n\nA new event, the Spring Breakout on March 14 to 17, features exhibition games between teams comprised of each organization’s top minor-league prospects. It includes games March 14 in Bradenton (Pirates-Orioles), and March 16 in Tampa (Blue Jays-Yankees), Lakeland (Tigers-Phillies), and Fort Myers (Rays-Minnesota Twins).\n\nIn 2023, the Rays began the season with record-tying 13 consecutive wins before qualifying for the postseason for the fifth straight season. However, they were swept by the eventual World Series champions Texas Rangers in the American League wild-card round.\n\nTo help you plan you spring training experiences, here is a team-by-team rundown with locations, ticket information and schedules.\n\nAtlanta Braves\n\nLocation: CoolToday Park, North Port\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 15 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 20 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nBaltimore Orioles\n\nLocation: Ed Smith Stadium, Sarasota\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 15 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 20 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nBoston Red Sox\n\nLocation: JetBlue Park, Fort Myers\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 14 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 19 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nDetroit Tigers\n\nLocation: Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium, Lakeland\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 14 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 19 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nHouston Astros\n\nLocation: Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 14 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 19 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nMiami Marlins\n\nLocation: Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium, Jupiter\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 15 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 20 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nMinnesota Twins\n\nLocation: Hammond Stadium at Lee County Sports Complex, Fort Myers\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 14 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 18 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nNew York Mets\n\nLocation: Clover Park, Port St. Lucie\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 14 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 19 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nLocation: Steinbrenner Field, Tampa\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 15 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 20 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\n\nLocation: BayCare Ballpark, Clearwater\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 14 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 19 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nPittsburgh Pirates\n\nLocation: LECOM Park, Bradenton\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 14 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 19 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n\nLocation: Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium, Jupiter\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 14 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 19 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nTampa Bay Rays\n\nLocation: Charlotte Sports Park, Port Charlotte\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 14 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 19 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n\nLocation: TD Ballpark, Dunedin\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 15 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 20 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nWashington Nationals\n\nLocation: Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach\n\nReporting dates: Feb. 14 (pitchers/catchers); Feb. 20 (full squad)\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nCactus League (Arizona)"
