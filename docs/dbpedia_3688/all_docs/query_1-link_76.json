        "text": "At this time last year, pitchers and catchers reported to their Florida sites, and spring training began as it always did for the Grapefruit League, as Major League Baseball teams began getting ready out in the sunshine.\n\nAnd then, on March 12, it all went away.\n\nThe emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic shut down spring training completely. There was doubt Major League Baseball would even have a 2020 season, though in the end, a 60-game regular season was played, beginning on July 23.\n\nThis season, spring training returns -- though with a modified schedule, limited pod seating and COVID restrictions, it's definitely not what fans of preseason baseball are used to.\n\nHere's what we know about the 2021 Grapefruit League season:\n\nGrapefruit League teams will play very familiar opponents\n\nFlorida's teams will play a limited schedule of games in 2021 Spring Training, which keeps travel to a smaller area for most teams.\n\nThe five Atlantic Coast-based teams -- the Houston Astros, Washington Nationals, Miami Marlins, St. Louis Cardinals and New York Mets -- will play each other over a 24-game schedule, 3 home games, 3 away against each opponent.\n\nSpring training guide: What to expect at Mets, Cardinals, Marlins, Astros and Nats games\n\nYour guide to Spring Training 2021: Breaking down the Gulf Coast's teams and how you can get tickets\n\nThe teams based on the Gulf Coast will play a 28-game schedule. These teams are split into two groups -- one featuring the Toronto Blue Jays, Philadelphia Phillies, Detroit Tigers and New York Yankees; the other with the Atlanta Braves, Tampa Bay Rays, Boston Red Sox and Minnesota Twins. Those teams will play within their groups; the Pittsburgh Pirates and Baltimore Orioles will play teams from both groups.\n\nThe action begins Feb. 28.\n\nFans are allowed -- but not very many\n\nThere will be fans at Grapefruit League games, but not many. Depending on where you go, fan capacity will be limited anywhere from 20 percent capacity at Clover Park in Port St. Lucie for Mets games to 28 percent at Hammond Stadium in Fort Myers for the Twins.\n\nMore: Mets cut Clover Park seating availability 80%, reduce spring training schedule to 24 games\n\nMore: What to know: Red Sox, Twins get ready to open spring training\n\nWherever you go, it may be difficult to get seats. Spring training season ticket holders and regular season ticket holders will have first shot at tickets, and then the general public will be able to buy what's left.\n\nIntroducing a new term: Pod seating\n\nMajor League Baseball is directing its teams to sell its tickets in \"pods\", or small groups. These groups tend to be limited to two, three or four per pod, and each pod is separated by six feet of space.\n\nTeams will also have rules about masks, hand-washing stations and social distancing in place -- fans should check with each individual team's website before going to make sure you understand what the protocols are.\n\nMore: Play Ball! Q and A on Palm Beach County Spring Training games\n\nWill there be games on TV?\n\nThere will be games available on MLB.TV, according to Major League Baseball's official site, though they have not been announced. No games have been announced as yet for the MLB Network, either.\n\nESPN lists a March 3 game between the Seattle Mariners and Chicago Cubs on the main network, according to MLB.\n\nWho'll be on new teams this year?\n\nThe usual intrigue around teams acquiring big-name talent didn't take a break this year. There are two big names making their way to new teams training in Florida -- one in the East, one in the West.\n\nOn the Atlantic side, eyes will be on Jupiter and Nolan Arenado's new team, the Cardinals. The third baseman smashed 235 home runs and knocked in 760 runs in eight seasons with the Colorado Rockies, leading the National League in home runs three times and the major leagues in RBI twice. He arrived in a trade. Also making their way to the eastern side -- pitcher Carlos Carrasco and shortstop Francisco Lindor, both of whom moved to the Mets.\n\nOver on the Gulf Coast, meanwhile, Toronto snagged the big name as George Springer signed a big free-agent contract. Springer was one of the major offensive catalysts for the Astros during their successful (though questionable) run."
