        "text": "Enjoy Four Days of Spring Breakout Games\n\nArticle Courtesy of www.mlb.com\n\nOne of the great joys of the annual All-Star Futures Game is the chance to put some of the game’s top prospects on one field in the middle of the summer and let them show off the tools that make them the future of baseball.\n\nBut what if instead of one team for the American League and another for the National League, we allowed all 30 farm systems to form rosters full of their own prospects? And what if instead of one exhibition, we had 16? And what if instead of waiting for July, we pushed the series up four months?\n\nWhat is Spring Breakout?\n\nSpring Breakout is a new Major League Baseball initiative aimed at showcasing the game’s young talent during the Spring Training period. Sixteen contests will be held across Arizona and Florida — the Reds and Cardinals will play a pair each because of the uneven number of clubs in each state — as part of the series. Twelve of the 16 games will be played as part of a traditional doubleheader with the Major League Spring Training game that day.\n\nWhen are the games, and how can I watch?\n\nAll Breakout games will be held over the next four days, Thursday through Sunday, across the Grapefruit and Cactus Leagues, and all 16 will be broadcast through MLB.com, MLB Network or regional sports networks. The full schedule is below, with broadcast channels included in parentheses. Broadcast details and game times are subject to change.\n\nFriday, March 15\n\n• Marlins @ Cardinals, 2:05 p.m. ET/11:05 a.m. PT* (MLBN, MLBD, MLBN, ESPN+)\n\n• Nationals @ Mets, 3:10 p.m. ET/12:10 p.m. PT* (MLBD, SNY, Nats.com audio, ESPN+)\n\nSaturday, March 16\n\n• Braves @ Red Sox, 1:05 p.m. ET/10:05 a.m. PT (MLBN, MLBD, NESN, Red Sox Radio, SXM App, ESPN+)\n\n• Phillies @ Tigers, 1:05 p.m. ET/10:05 a.m. PT (MLBD, Tigers.TV, Phillies radio, ESPN+)\n\n• Blue Jays @ Yankees, 4:05 p.m. ET/1:05 p.m. PT* (MLBN, MLBD, YES Network, Jays Radio, ESPN+)\n\n• Rays @ Twins, 4:05 p.m. ET/1:05 p.m. PT* (MLBD, Bally Sports Sun, Rays audio webcast, ESPN+)\n\nSunday, March 17\n\n• Astros @ Cardinals, 10:05 a.m. ET/7:05 a.m. PT^ (MLBD/Astros radio)\n\n* — paired with Major League game as traditional doubleheader\n\n^ – broadcast is audio-only\n\nWho is playing?\n\nEach roster was constructed using MLB Pipeline’s Top 30 Prospects list as its foundation. That means that players with rookie eligibility entering the 2024 season — most of whom came directly from those Top 30s — were eligible for their club’s Spring Breakout roster. Major League rookie eligibility is defined as any player who has not yet exceeded 130 at-bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 total regular-season days on an active roster at the game’s top level. So even players with Major League experience can participate in Spring Breakout. Rosters may include 23-27 players per club.\n\nThe rosters consist of 70 of MLB Pipeline’s Top 100 Prospects and nearly two-thirds of the 900 players on Pipeline’s organization Top 30 Prospects lists. Twenty-one of the 30 teams plan on sending their top prospect, as rated by MLB Pipeline. The Cardinals will have each of their 10 best prospects participate. The Astros, Nationals, Pirates, Red Sox and Twins will feature nine of their top 10 prospects.\n\nABS challenges: The Automated Ball-Strike Challenge system will be in effect for games played in five Florida State League venues (Bradenton, Fort Myers [Twins], Jupiter, Port St. Lucie, Tampa). Each team will be able to challenge at least three ball-strike calls. A successful overturn gets the challenge returned to the club, and that continues until the club has three unsuccessful challenges.\n\nPlayer re-entry: Think of this as the Ohtani rule. If a pitcher is taken out of a Spring Breakout game, he may come back in later. (This only counts for pitchers, not position players unless an injury requires a substitution.) So a two-way player could pitch one inning on the mound, then return as a position player a few frames afterward.\n\nWhat are the best matchups?\n\nThat Pirates-Orioles opener in the Sunshine State is what this event’s all about. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are two of only five farm systems that boast five or more prospects ranked among MLB Pipeline’s Top 100 — with seven of them expected to be featured in their matchup. As if that wasn’t enough, this game will have 2022 No. 1 overall pick Jackson Holliday against 2023 No. 1 overall pick Paul Skenes in one of the spring’s must-see at-bats."
