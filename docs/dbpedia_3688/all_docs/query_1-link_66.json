        "text": "So far in spring training, the Red Sox simply can’t lose. No, really... they haven’t lost. At 8-0-3, Boston is the last remaining undefeated team in spring training play. It turns out the club has made some franchise history in the process.\n\nAccording to the team, this is the Red Sox’ longest Spring Training unbeaten streak against major league opponents. Back in 1951, they won 11 straight exhibition games (April 5-12), with the first eight wins coming against minor league opponents and the final three coming against the Boston Braves (source: Bill Nowlin, SABR).\n\nRelated: Pre-registration for mobile betting in Massachusetts is live on BetMGM.

The Sox lead the Grapefruit League in runs scored (77). Outfielder Raimel Tapia, who has been Boston’s MVP so far as he makes a big for the Opening Day roster, leads the Majors in doubles (5) and is tied for the lead in extra-base hits (6). First baseman Triston Casas leads the Grapefruit League lead in runs scored (8).\n\nOffensively, a lot of players have started camp hot. Alex Verdugo (5-for-9), Jorge Alfaro (7-for-10, 2 2B), Tapia (7-for-17, 5 2B, HR), Bobby Dalbec (6-for-17, HR, 3 2B), Casas (8-for-18, 2 HR, 6 RBI) and Christian Arroyo (6-for-19, 2 HR, 7 RBI) are among them. Others have been cold, like Kiké Hernández (1-for-13), Adam Duvall (0-for-11) and Rob Refsnyder (0-for-10). On the pitching side, depth starters Kutter Crawford and Josh Winckowski have looked good (5 scoreless innings each) while others like Bryan Mata and Wyatt Mills have looked good. Nick Pivetta struggled in his first start and relievers John Schreiber and Zack Kelly have both had bumpy starts.\n\nOnline sports betting is coming to the state of Massachusetts.

The Red Sox roster that has contributed to most of their wins so far looks much different than the 26-man group that will take the field on March 30 against the Orioles. There is usually little correlation between spring training results and regular season records. In 2022, the spring Sox started out very hot (six straight wins) before finishing a shortened spring with a respectable 11-8 record. That club, of course, finished in last place at the American League East with a 78-84 record.\n\nSpeaking with Boston Sports Journal’s Sean McAdam this week, Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom acknowledged that spring success isn’t usually a predictor of a good regular season but did note a couple of mental advantages of playing well in March.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a secret that spring training wins and losses are very different from regular season wins and losses,’’ Bloom told McAdam. “But any time you take the field, you want to be high-fiving at the end. It doesn’t matter the context. And the energy, the sense of purpose, the focus in this camp has been awesome. It was awesome before the games started; it’s been awesome since.\n\n“So the fact that that has been rewarded with winning is really nice to see,” Bloom continued. “The early stages in the games on any given day are being played by a lot of guys that we’re going to be counting on at the major league level. The later stages of the game usually aren’t. So the fact that we’ve managed to come away with a bunch of W’s speaks to the energy that has carried through the whole group, whether it’s been guys who have been in the big leagues for a long time or guys who haven’t even gotten there.”\n\nBloom might be right about certain intangibles but any baseball executive would admit that the main goal of spring training is for a team to stay healthy. For the Red Sox, that has not happened. Starters Brayan Bello (forearm), James Paxton (hamstring) and Garrett Whitlock (hip rehab) are all expected to miss Opening Day and catcher Connor Wong (hamstring) and designated hitter Justin Turner (hit in face with pitch) have also been shut down. With infielders Trevor Story (elbow surgery) and Adalberto Mondesí (ACL rehab) already out, it’s possible the club has seven or eight projected contributors on the IL to start the season. While none of those players other than Story are expected to miss a major chunk of the season, the fact the Sox are already banged up is a much more notable takeaway than the club’s record to this point.\n\nYes, wins are always fun, and the Red Sox are racking up a lot of them. But the more important thing for them to show before Opening Day is improved health."
