So far in spring training, he is not disappointing.\n\nThe Nationals play in the Florida Grapefruit League, and on Tuesday they played the Houston Astros. After hitting a two-run double in the top of the third, Crews flashed the leather in center field in the bottom of the fourth inning.\n\nAstros left fielder Corey Julks was batting for Houston and sent the ball to center field. Crews sprinted to get close and fully laid out to make the catch and end the inning."
