        "text": "When the Atlanta Braves departed Kissimmee in 2019 and relocated their spring training headquarters to south Venice, it gave Sarasota baseball fans two teams in the county to watch.\n\nAnd the Baltimore Orioles and Braves proved to be worth watching in 2023.\n\nBaltimore won the American League East for the first time since 2014 and has a host of young and exciting players returning for another run at a division title.\n\nRays Fan's Guide: Tampa Bay Rays spring training returns to Charlotte Sports Park. What you need to know\n\nPirates Fan's Guide: The Pittsburgh Pirates start spring training at LECOM Park in Bradenton. What you need to know\n\nThe Braves, your 2021 World Series champions, have won six straight National League East titles and should be right in the hunt to make that seven in a row in 2024.\n\nBoth teams have real World Series aspirations and start their quest to be Major League Baseball's best in Sarasota on Thursday. Here's what fans need to know if they are going to venture out to watch the Orioles and Braves this spring.\n\nBALTIMORE ORIOLES\n\nLast Season: 101-61, 1st place in AL East. Lost AL Division series to Texas in three games.\n\nWhen is the first workout for Orioles pitchers and catchers?\n\nPitchers and catchers will work out on the back fields behind Ed Smith Stadium starting Thursday.\n\nCan fans attend these workouts?\n\nYes, starting Feb. 15 through Feb, 23, fans can watch practice on the fields behind Ed Smith Stadium. It's free, as is parking in the east lot. Practice will take place each day from approximately 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. The Orioles' team store, located inside Ed Smith Stadium, will be open daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nWhere do the Orioles play their home spring training games?\n\nSince 2010, the Orioles have played at Ed Smith Stadium, 2700 12th Street in Sarasota. The facility opened in 1989 and was named after the former president of the Sarasota Sports Committee and the man whose friendship with Chicago White Sox owner Arthur Allyn was key in luring the White Sox from Tampa to Sarasota in 1960. After the White Sox moved their spring training to Arizona after the 1997 season, they were replaced by the Cincinnati Reds, who left Sarasota after the 2008 spring to share a new facility with the Cleveland Indians in Goodyear, Ariz.\n\nBefore the construction of Ed Smith Stadium, spring training was played at Payne Park, built in 1924, and the previous spring home of the New York Giants, Boston Red Sox, and White Sox. Meanwhile, Ed Smith Stadium is now a cashless ballpark. Methods of payment will be limited to Mastercard, Visa, American Express, and Discover. Cash will not be accepted at parking lots, concession stands, nor ticket windows.\n\nHow do I get Orioles spring training tickets?\n\nOnline, go to www.mlb.com/orioles/tickets/spring-training, or visit the Ed Smith Stadium ticket office. It's open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The phone number is (941) 893-6300. Ticket prices range from $23 to $43.\n\nOK, I have my tickets, how soon can I get in before the game?\n\nThe gates to Ed Smith Stadium will open two hours before the first pitch.\n\nWhere can I park at Orioles spring training games?\n\nParking is available for $12 in several lots on and surrounding the Ed Smith Stadium complex. More than 1,800 spaces are available on site.\n\nIs pre-game traffic heavy around Ed Smith Stadium?\n\nCompared to other stadiums in the Grapefruit League, The Ed is fairly accessible. It's located on the corner of 12th Street and Tuttle Avenue, the latter extending north beyond University Parkway.\n\nWhat and when is the Spring Breakout game?\n\nIt’s a new initiative from MLB that highlights each organization’s top prospects. These prospects, and only these prospects, will meet in exhibition games from March 14-17. The Orioles' Spring Breakout game will be on March 14 at 7:05 p.m. versus the Pirates at LECOM Park.\n\nWho are some of the Orioles players to keep an eye on?\n\nAt the top of the list could be Gunnar Henderson, last year's AL Rookie of the Year. The 22-year-old, the team's 2019 second-round pick, played 150 games at shortstop and third base, hitting .255 with 28 home runs and 82 RBI. Catcher Adley Rutschman, the top overall pick in the 2019 draft, improved upon his rookie season, batting .277, with 20 homers and 80 RBI. Outfielder Anthony Santander had his second consecutive productive season, hitting 28 homers, knocking in 89 and hitting .257.\n\nBaltimore also engineered a trade with Milwaukee for starting pitcher Corbin Burnes, who immediately goes to the top of the Oriole rotation. The NL Cy Young winner in 2021, the 29-year-old Burnes went 10-8 for the Brewers last season, with a 3.39 ERA, only 141 hits allowed in 193.2 innings, with 200 strikeouts. For the bullpen, Baltimore signed 35-year-old reliever Craig Kimbrel, who will assume the team's closer role while Felix Bautista recovers from offseason Tommy John surgery.\n\nWhat is the Orioles home spring training schedule?\n\nSaturday, Feb. 24 vs. Boston, 1:05 p.m.\n\nMonday, Feb. 26 vs. Tampa Bay (ss), 1:05 p.m.\n\nTuesday, Feb. 27 vs. Detroit, 1:05 p.m.\n\nThursday, Feb. 29 vs. Pittsburgh, 1:05 p.m.\n\nSaturday, March 2 vs. Yankees, 1:05 p.m.\n\nMonday, March 4 vs. Minnesota (ss), 1:05 p.m.\n\nWednesday, March 6 vs. Pittsburgh, 6:05 p.m.\n\nFriday, March 8 vs. Detroit, 6:05 p.m.\n\nSunday, March 10 vs. Toronto (ss), 1:05 p.m.\n\nTuesday, March 12 vs. Tampa Bay, 1:05 p.m.\n\nWednesday, March 13 vs. Atlanta, 6:05 p.m.\n\nSaturday, March 16 vs. Boston, 1:05 p.m.\n\nSunday, March 17 vs. Atlanta, 1:05 p.m.\n\nWednesday, March 20 vs. Philadelphia, 6:05 p.m.\n\nFriday, March 22 vs. Pittsburgh, 6:05 p.m.\n\nSaturday, March 23 vs. Toronto (ss), 6:05 p.m.\n\nWhat are some of the better home games?\n\nOn March 2, the Yankees make their only spring visit to Ed Smith Stadium. It will also be the day the Orioles partner with the All Faiths Food Bank to host a food drive. Fans are encouraged to bring non-perishable food items with them to the ballpark. On March 6, the Orioles host the Pirates at 6:05 p.m., and the team will partner with Mothers Helping Mothers to host a baby item collection. Fans are asked to bring with them general infant care items to be donated to families in need throughout Sarasota and Manatee counties. On March 6 and March 13, the latter with Atlanta at The Ed for a 6:05 p.m. game, the Orioles will partner with SunCoast Blood Centers to host two blood drives.\n\nATLANTA BRAVES\n\nLast Season: 104-58, 1st place in NL East. Lost NL Division series to Philadelphia in four games.\n\nWhen is the first workout for Braves pitchers and catchers?\n\nThey will work out on Thursday, one day after players are due in camp.\n\nWhen in the first full-squad workout?\n\nTuesday, Feb. 20, but players who arrive early will take part in batting practice and other side work.\n\nCan fans attend these workouts?\n\nYes, starting on Sunday, the Green Gate (all days) and Gate 3 (away games only) will open daily at 9 p.m. to provide fans free access to the back fields behind CoolToday Park.\n\nWhere do the Braves play their home spring training games?\n\nAtlanta plays at CoolToday Park, 18800 S. West Villages Parkway in Venice. The Braves moved from Kissimmee to CoolToday for the 2020 spring season. The $140 million complex has seven diamonds, 11 batting cages, and 63 pitching mounds.\n\nHow do I get Braves spring training tickets?\n\nThe CoolToday Park ticket office is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. It can be reached at (941) 413-5000. Tickets also can be bought online at www.cooltodaypark.com.

The lots are named red, green, gold, and blue.\n\nIs pre-game traffic heavy around CoolToday Park?\n\nWhile the park itself is beautiful, the same can't be said of the traffic. Whether you arrive via US-41 or I-75, then onto River Road, expect stop-and-go traffic and gridlock.\n\nWhat and when is the Spring Breakout game?\n\nIt’s a new initiative from MLB that highlights each organization’s top prospects. These prospects, and only these prospects, will meet in exhibition games from March 14-17. The Braves' Spring Breakout game will be on March 16 at 1:05 p.m. versus the Red Sox in Fort Myers.\n\nWho are some of the Braves players to keep an eye on?\n\nStart with first baseman Matt Olson, who last season broke the franchise mark for home runs in a season (54) and set the live-ball era franchise single-season record for RBI (139). Outfielder Ronald Acune Jr. hit 41 homers with 106 RBI; Marcell Ozuna added 40 homers and 100 RBI; third baseman Austin Riley had 37 home runs and 97 RBI; second baseman Ozzie Albies 33 and 109; and catcher Sean Murphy 21 and 68.\n\nStarting pitcher Spencer Strider went 20-5 with a 3.86 ERA, and at age 39, Charlie Morton won 14 games.
