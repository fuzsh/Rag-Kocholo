If you’ve been on your socials and spotting your favorite players arrive for spring training, we have no doubt you’re getting more and more pumped for the regular season. While streaming exhibition games isn’t so simple, we’ve got all of the details on how to watch MLB spring training games so you don’t miss a single second of baseball.\n\nBefore diving into the 2024-2025 Major League Baseball (MLB) regular season, all 30 teams head off to spring training, where they play each other in a series of games. The franchises are split into two different leagues: the Cactus League and the Grapefruit League. The former is based in Arizona, while the latter is based in Florida. Spring training, the MLB’s preseason, is a bunch of practices and games that take place right before the regular season kicks off.\n\nPreseason provides new players with opportunities to try out for roster and position spots. For existing players, this is the prime time to get some practice in and also get a feel for competitors. Additionally, spring training allows fans to attend games in real life, or for those who don’t live in Arizona or Florida, get a glimpse of their favorite team on television.\n\nPlayers typically arrive at spring training in early February, with pitchers and catchers showing up first and position players rolling in a few days later. Actual spring training games start in late February and go all the way up to the day before Opening Day of the regular season (the last week of March or the first week of April). The 2024 preseason opens with the Los Angeles Dodgers facing the San Diego Padres on Thursday, February 22, which is sure to be an entertaining matchup.\n\nKeep an eye on some of the biggest trades from the offseason, including Shohei Ohtani, Tyler Glasnow, and Yoshinobu Yamamoto on the Los Angeles Dodgers, Juan Soto, Alex Verdugo, and Marcus Stroman on the New York Yankees, Josh Hader on the Houston Astros, and Chris Sale on the Atlanta Braves, among several others.\n\nStreaming MLB games, let alone spring training games, can get complicated. Thankfully, we’ve gathered all of the info you’ll need to check in on your team before the regular season starts.
