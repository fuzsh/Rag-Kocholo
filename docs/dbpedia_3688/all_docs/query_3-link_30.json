        "text": "12:15 PM ET\n\nLineups were posted in the clubhouse as we arrived. The opener is often stacked with regulars, and today is no exception. The opener is often your best chance in the first several weeks to see a lineup somewhat akin to what you may see at Target Field. Otherwise, a lot of the time is being given to non-regulars as the regulars slowly ramp up.\n\nToday's lineup includes six guys expected to be regulars (Carlos Santana, Royce Lewis, Max Kepler, Ryan Jeffers, Edouard Julien, Alex Kirilloff), two bench players (Kyle Farmer, Willie Castro), and two guys who are likely(?) slated for St. Paul, but will be the first guys called up in the event something changes (Austin Martin, Louie Varland).\n\nThat's honestly a better lineup than the Twins will have in some games this year. (Or had for the entirety of September of 2022. ðŸ˜­)\n\n12:35 PM ET\n\nAlternately, the Pirates are apparently saving their starters for their home opener tomorrow vs the Orioles. Woof. I see one projected starting position player in their lineup, catcher Henry Davis. By default, he's batting third. Their starting pitcher is Bailey Falter, who is projected to be their 5th starter, which may explain why they have a starting catcher making the bus trip here.\n\nThe \"bus trip\" reference to a visiting team is more than just fancy baseball writing. It's a factor for why we see lineups like this. Pittsburgh's spring training is relatively close in terms of Grapefruit League road teams - it's a one-hour, forty-minute drive - but most Grapefruit League games are annoyingly far away compared to the cross-town drives that exist in Arizona's Cactus League. For any established major leaguer, it's almost viewed as a punishment (or an absolute necessity) to be scheduled as a road game. If you want to see Twins regulars, you'll want to come to Hammond or to the Red Sox SkyBlue park, which is also in Fort Myers.\n\nI'd heard behind the scenes that MLB was going to try to crack down on lineups like this because there are supposed to be at least four regulars that make a road trip. It's a battle that MLB has been losing more and more each season, but I'm increasingly wondering if it's a battle worth fighting. A visiting superstar might draw more fans on the road, but superstars don't take any road trips. Is Kepler making a trip to Bradenton change anyone's calculus to attend a game? Fans go to see their own players, anyway.\n\n12:55 PM ET\n\nI've got great news for you baseball nerds out there: there's an even better way to follow this game than right here. MLB.com is doing pitch-by-pitch tracking of spring training games, and for the first time, it includes Statcast data. (At least it does today at Hammond Stadium. We'll find out if the Red Sox are too, tomorrow.)\n\nHere's the link to it.\n\nSo, if you're wondering if Louie Varland is going to use his 2-seam fastball (i.e. sinker) versus right-handers, you may get a chance to track that live. Or, for that matter, go back and see how it worked. The Pirates have right-handed batters in their second and third spots today. Of course, he might be saving that for later in the spring and just trying to get his pitch count in today. We'll see.\n\n1:12 PM ET\n\nThe game time and temperature was announced, which leads to one of my favorite bits in spring training: announcing the temperature both here and in Minneapolis. 74 degrees here and 35 degrees in Minneapolis. Eat it, losers.ðŸ˜œ\n\nVarland's first inning was scoreless but there were a couple of noteworthy developments for a guy who was hurt on homers by right-handed hitters last year. Both the second and third batter got hits against him, one of which was a grounder up the middle that Julien was able to get to but unable to field cleanly. He threw the 2-seamer to the second guy twice, went 2-0, and then went back to his traditional pitches. He threw 17 pitches and is coming out again in the second inning.\n\n(Lots of corrections made in this entry. I had Varland's sides lined up wrong and listed him as \"Larnach\" in one spot so ... live-blogging might not be my thing.)"
