        "text": "Not long before the Grapefruit League schedule began this spring, Josh Harrison stood in the batting cages at the Nationals’ spring training complex in West Palm Beach, Fla., with hitting coach Kevin Long. He placed his hands a few inches apart on the bat handle, turned to Long and said, “That’s the final piece of the puzzle.”\n\nHarrison had toyed around with a split grip in 2020 after realizing his top hand had become too dominant. It is uncommon for hitters to hold the bat that way. Some sluggers, such as Nelson Cruz, have experimented with it and found success. But holding the bat with space between the hands isn’t typically conducive to making hard contact. When Harrison tried it out, though, the grip helped him keep his swing on a plane.\n\nTo hear Harrison tell it, Long, a well-known and respected hitting coach who has been with the Nationals since 2018, was skeptical. “You think so?” Harrison recalled Long saying to him.\n\n“Just wait,” Harrison replied.\n\nNot to put too much stock in batting .417 against pitchers who generally were trying to work out kinks before a long season, but Harrison’s spring training statistics served as confirmation that the split-grip experiment might just work.\n\nHarrison is committed to using it exclusively now, and in the early weeks of the season, the technique has paid off. Harrison batted .387 (12-for-31) with a 1.021 OPS and one strikeout in his first nine games after coming off the COVID-19 injured list. He was one of just 13 players who knocked at least 12 hits from April 12-21, along with teammate Trea Turner.\n\nIt is fair to question whether Harrison can sustain this pace. Pitchers and opponents adjust. But Harrison has a track record of being a steady performer on offense when he is playing frequently. And he has a few other factors working in his favor — a refined approach and a clean bill of health.\n\nThe version of Josh Harrison who hadn’t yet had his hand broken twice in the span of seven months by 95-plus-mph fastballs was an accomplished contact hitter who earned a place on two All-Star teams and signed a $27.3 million contract extension with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2015.\n\nThe version of Josh Harrison who recovered from the hand fractures only to tweak and eventually blow out a hamstring was a ho-hum batter who assembled an uninspiring .606 OPS in 133 games from 2018 to 2019 and didn’t get to prove to the Tigers and Phillies that he could be better than he’d ever been.\n\nThe version of Josh Harrison who had overcome his injuries was an unknown variable until he assembled a sneaky good performance in 2020 for the Nationals, parlayed that into a guaranteed MLB contract, earned the Nationals’ starting job at second base with a torrid spring campaign and became the team’s third-most-productive player in terms of fWAR despite playing in only nine of the first 16 games.\n\nIt is easy to slap labels on the various seasons of Harrison’s 11-year MLB career. The stretch from 2011 to 2017 would carry a “pre-injury” designation; the one from 2018 to 2019 an “injured” designation; and the most recent stretch “healed.”\n\nThe importance of that last label can’t be overstated. Harrison is doing well for the Nationals because he is healthy. And because he is healthy, he is reminding whoever is watching of the 20-something utilityman who convinced the Pirates through his performance that he deserved to be a daily fixture on the field.\n\nHarrison will be 34 years old in June. He doesn’t need to prove himself to anyone. But seeing the product of the effort he put into rewiring his body after two seasons lost to injury is no less reassuring.\n\n“Injuries, yes, they’re unfortunate,” he said during a phone call with The Athletic on Thursday. “But they allow you to take inventory of your body and how your body works.”\n\nHarrison began doing that about midway through 2019. He had undergone surgery on his torn left hamstring that June and failed to properly rehabilitate the muscle during the eight-week period recommended by medical staff. The Detroit Tigers, who had signed him during spring training to a $2 million deal hoping they could flip him for prospects at the non-waiver trade deadline, released him when they realized he wouldn’t have the desired impact on their roster.\n\nThat left Harrison to return to his family in Cincinnati, where he spent his suddenly abundant free time with his personal trainer. When they broke down all his movements, they learned his muscles weren’t working as they were supposed to. The injuries forced him into bad habits — like rotating his hips out of alignment to extract power from his legs during a swing, or standing on the outside of his foot instead of flat on his sole to complete routine motions. The patterns exacerbated his ailments and, ultimately, sapped his on-field strengths.\n\nIt took months to undo what had gone wrong over two seasons.\n\n“Things that I did in 2014, I can’t say I do here because 2014 was pre-injury, pre-surgery,” Harrison said. “I think that’s the other thing. Sometimes we can go back and look at previous film and think, ‘Oh, man, I need to do that.’ But, realistically, sometimes your body just can’t do it because you’ve had injuries. Sometimes you’re chasing a feeling that your body needs to make an adjustment from. I found myself trying to go back and do what I was doing in ’14 and my body, after compensating and doing certain things it’s like, OK, my body doesn’t work that way anymore.”\n\nHarrison emerged on the other end able to “use my body the way I wanted” in mid-December, some six months after surgery. By then, he had signed a minor-league deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, thinking he’d be a perfect fit for manager Joe Girardi’s bench.\n\nHe was wrong. When teams reconvened for a 60-game season after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, Harrison found himself left out of the Phillies’ Opening Day plans. He was granted his release in late July.\n\nThe Nationals, however, needed him on their bench.\n\nThe season lasted just long enough for Harrison to rediscover his footing on the field. He wound up bouncing around the diamond as the Nationals envisioned, capable of holding down every position except first base and catcher. While at it, he batted a respectable .278 with a 109 OPS+. Within weeks of the season’s end, he re-signed with the Nationals for $1 million, eager to spend an offseason liberated from the stress of free agency and rehabilitation.\n\nHe didn’t know that over the course of the months that followed he’d revisit the split grip and play his way into a full-time role. With Starlin Castro slotted in as the team’s primary second baseman and young Carter Kieboom figuring to start at third base on Opening Day, Harrison had prepared himself to spend 2021 on the bench again.\n\nBut Kieboom struggled while Harrison underwent an evolution at the plate. Manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo determined their team’s best play was to move Castro to third base, demote Kieboom and name Harrison their starting second baseman.\n\nIt is hard to find flaws in their logic. Not even missing two weeks of game action after either being infected with or exposed to COVID-19 shook Harrison’s composure. Unlike teammates Kyle Schwarber and Josh Bell, Harrison didn’t require days to rediscover his timing at the plate. He reached base in 60 percent of his plate appearances in his first five games.\n\nHarrison is making contact on 86.9 percent of his swings, a rate good enough to rank 20th among batters with at least 30 plate appearances this season. Yet he is not swinging as often as he did in previous seasons; his 49.6 percent swing rate is the lowest of his career.\n\n“His swing is not as complicated (as Schwarber or Bell),” Martinez said last week. “He goes to the ball. He has a plan every time he goes up there. He doesn’t try to do too much. He puts the ball in play.”\n\nThe early figures might move a little closer to his career norms as the season wears on. But the improving trends were visible last season, too. Since debuting with the Nationals in July, Harrison has batted .309 with an .840 OPS, a 10 percent strikeout rate and an 8 percent walk rate in 42 games. He has made contact on 81 percent of his swings while whiffing on swings only 10 percent of the time.\n\nIn plain terms, Harrison is a more selective hitter than he was when he played hurt. And now that he is using a grip that helps him to get the head of his bat to the ball quicker, Harrison could be on the verge of his best season.\n\n“It just comes (down) to maturity,” he said. “The first few years in the big leagues, I played well, but I was still young, not really understanding what I was doing. … Now I’m in a good spot, knowing that everything I want to do, my body can physically do. It’s just slowed the game back down for me.”\n\n(Photo: Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post via Getty Images)"
