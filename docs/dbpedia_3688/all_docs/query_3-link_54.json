        "text": "Did you know that 15 major league baseball teams have spring training in Florida? They call it the Grapefruit League, which has been going strong for over 100 years. Every year, more than 1.5 million people make their way to the Sunshine State to enjoy a game or two and the communities around the stadiums. We are lucky to have some stadiums close to our home base in Southwest Florida.\n\nBecause of MLB lockouts and the “health event” from the last few years, spring training for many was either canceled or had weird schedules, so attendance was lower than expected. 2023 looks like it will be back to normal, and baseball fans and non-baseball fans who love hot dogs, beer, and sunshine, have plenty to look forward to in Florida’s Grapefruit League.\n\nSpring training games run from February 25th to March 28th. Five teams have spring training on the east coast of Florida; 10 teams play on the west coast.\n\n*For the 2023 season, as noted below, the Tampa Rays will have their games in Orlando and St. Petersburg.\n\nPro Tip: Check the stadium’s website for ticket prices and discounts. You may be able to save if you attend more than one game, attend as a group, or are active or retired military.\n\nSpring Training in Fort Myers\n\nDowntown Fort Myers, Florida, home to spring training *2023 update, many businesses are rebuilding after Hurricane Ian\n\nFort Myers was hit hard by Hurricane Ian in 2022. Recovery for businesses varies; however, the stadiums in Fort Myers are ready to welcome fans!\n\nMany hotels have reopened, but not all. Some Fort Myers businesses are fully open, and some are still rebuilding. If you are traveling to this part of the state in 2023, there are two ways to find out how your intended destination is doing:\n\nCall them. Check their website and social media, or call/email them directly to get the most up-to-date information. This is especially important for lodging since some remain closed or are in various stages of repair.\n\nCheck the Fort Myers social pages and website\n\nFort Myers Facebook\n\nFort Myers Instagram\n\nVisit Fort Myers\n\nWho Plays in Fort Myers?\n\nThe Boston Red Sox play at JetBlue Park, aka Fenway South\n\nThe Minnesota Twins play at Hammond Stadium, located inside the Lee County Sports Complex.\n\nSpring Training in Tampa\n\nTampa is the heart of Florida’s Gulf Coast with dining, events, activities, shopping and more to keep everyone satisfied\n\nTampa is the heart of Florida’s Gulf Coast, home to many sports and active outdoor events, and maybe not coincidentally, the heart of the state’s craft beer movement!\n\nOne Tampa restaurant to try near George M.Steinbrenner Field:\n\nArmature Works\n\n1910 N. Ola Ave., Tampa, FL 33602\n\nTake a 3,000-square-foot historic brick warehouse and splash in a little imagination and creativity, and you’ll get Armature Works, an indoor open-air market with something for everyone to love. It’s not a “single” restaurant and has more than 14 local eating experiences, 2 Michelin recommended full-service restaurants, a rooftop bar overlooking the Hillsborough River and downtown Tampa, and an expansive lawn anchors one end of the Tampa Riverwalk so you can enjoy the Florida Sunshine. We enjoyed pre-dinner drinks at Steelbach (with plans to return for dinner!) and dinner at Oak and Ola. I recommend both!\n\nWho Plays in Tampa?\n\nThe New York Yankees play at George M. Steinbrenner Field.\n\nSt. Petersburg / Opening Game in Orlando – New for 2023\n\nSt. Petersburg will host Tampa Bay Rays spring training games for the 2023 season as their home stadium is repaired\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays spring training home was at Charlotte Sports Park; however, Hurricane Ian damaged the structure, and it is not ready for the 2023 season. Instead, they will play their opening game against the New York Yankees on February 28th, 2023, at Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex in Orlando. Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg will host the remaining spring training games for the 2023 season.\n\nOne St. Petersburg Restaurant to try near Tropicana Field\n\nThe Lure\n\n661 Central Avenue, St. Petersburg, FL 33701\n\nThe Lure is “a cool place to hang out with great food.” You’ll find an enticing collection of sushi, tapas, flatbreads, tiki drinks, cocktails, and microbrews. You can go for billiards or drop in for brunch, but you’re bound to stay for the atmosphere and food!\n\nSpring Training in Clearwater\n\nIf you haven’t been to Clearwater, Florida, you’re in for a treat! White sandy beaches and a pumping downtown…\n\nYou’re bound to mix up something good when you “just add water” to a walkable Florida city. Clearwater doesn’t disappoint. When you’re not at a game, a favorite place to play is Sand Key Park. This is 95 acres, part park, part beach, and all fun. Repairs have begun to the two docks, so they may be out of commission during your trip this year; however, there is still plenty to do. Your four-legged family members will enjoy the dog park at Sandy Key Park, but they are not allowed on the beach. Downtown, you’ll enjoy flavors from a diverse culinary scene, and be sure to visit the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, where Dolphin Tale lovers will see some familiar faces…or tails!\n\nOne Clearwater Restaurant Near BayCare Ballpark\n\nSea-Guini\n\nLocated in the Opal Sands Resort\n\n430 S Gulfview Blvd, Clearwater Beach, FL 33767\n\nIf you’re looking for an upscale culinary experience where you get a view of the Gulf from every table, try Sea-Guini. They are located inside the Opal Sands Resort. The Grouper is a favorite, and the pan-seared hogfish has been on their menu since its opening in 2016; however, you’ll find plenty of Italian and Mediterranean dishes to enjoy. Reservations are recommended.\n\nWho Plays in Clearwater?\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies play at BayCare Ballpark\n\nSpring Training in Dunedin\n\nFunky, comfy, and quaint are often used to describe Dunedin, this Gulf Coast town west of Tampa\n\nFunky, comfy, and quaint are often used to describe this Gulf Coast town west of Tampa. Blessed with two unspoiled beaches on Honeymoon Island and Caladesi Island, visitors can’t seem to get enough of the Old Florida beaches. Back in town, Main Street is a favorite stroll, with several microbreweries located within walking distance of each other. You’ll often find people dressed in their workout clothes since the 38-mile Pinellas Trails crosses Main Street, and they may lock up their bikes and grab something to eat or drink in town.\n\nOne Dunedin Restaurant to Try near TD Ballpark\n\nHog Island Fish Camp\n\n900 Broadway Avenue, Dunedin, FL 34698\n\nLocated in downtown Dunedin, this chef-owned restaurant focuses on locally sourced seafood which, in turn, supports many local fishermen. That’s a win-win-win! Everything has a southern flare to it, from the shrimp and bacon mac and cheese, to the fresh catch of the day, and everything in between.\n\nWho Plays in Dunedin?\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays play at TD Ballpark\n\nSpring Training in Bradenton\n\nSeeing the downtown sights and Gulf beaches around Bradenton will make you love seeing spring training games here\n\nLECOM park, originally known as McKechnie Field in honor of former Pittsburgh native Bill McKechnie, is one the oldest ballparks in the U.S. While it was born in 1923, it has “had some work done” to keep it fresh for visitors while maintaining the feel of a classic ballpark. It has been recognized as the “Best of the Ballparks” in the Grapefruit League. Located just south of Tampa and close to Sarasota, you can enjoy a day at the park near Florida’s Gulf Coast. After the game, explore downtown Bradenton, the Riverwalk, and the Gulf beaches.\n\nOne Bradenton restaurant to experience near LECOM park:\n\nOrtygia (Italian/Sicilian)\n\n1418 13th Street West, Bradenton, FL 34205\n\nOpen Wednesday – Saturday, from 5 pm – 9 pm\n\nLocated in the Village of the Arts, this cozy Sicilian restaurant will make you feel like you’re eating at Grandma’s house, provided your grandma was a great Sicilian cook! At any moment, Chef may emerge from the kitchen with a harmonica and play alongside the piano player in the front room. It’s a fun atmosphere, like a family gathering. When we were here, we sat at a two-seat table right by the kitchen to see the bustling kitchen at work. If you would like to take your affection for Sicilian cooking on the road, Chef Gaetano leads culinary tours to Sicily. Learn more about their guided trips.\n\nWho Plays in Bradenton?\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates play at LECOM Park\n\nSpring Training in Sarasota\n\nSiesta Key’s white crushed quartz beaches are the cherry on top to your spring training trip to Sarasota, FL\n\nIf you love boating, water sports, upscale shopping, epic sunsets, and beach days in a setting where Old Florida can still be found, then you will love your days in Sarasota. Sarasota is known as the Cultural Coast for its theater, art, gardens, music, and Ringling Circus legacy, not to mention a vibrant downtown on the water with some of the most gorgeous beaches in the world.\n\nOne Sarasota restaurant to experience near Ed Smith Stadium is:\n\nOwens Fish Camp\n\n516 Burn’s Lane, Sarasota, FL 34236\n\n941-951-6936\n\nOpens each night at 4 pm\n\nLocated in Downtown Sarasota, this restaurant honors Sarasota’s history as a sleepy Gulf Coast fishing village. While the thriving and growing city is sleeping no more, you can still enjoy a fun, relaxed atmosphere with great seafood pulled in fresh from the Bay, live music, a tree swing, and a backyard barbecue. We stumbled into this place while strolling through Burns Court and gravitated toward the music spilling out from the wooden-fenced backyard. Inside, you’ll feel like you are in a rustic fishing house. There are no reservations, so you may need to wait on busy nights.\n\nWho plays in Sarasota?\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles play at Ed Smith Stadium\n\nSpring Training in North Port\n\nCool Today Park, spring training home to the Braves, is an easy drive to Venice Beach, Florida\n\nNorth Port is a surprising find in Sarasota County just south of Venice. We’ve listened to concerts on the lawn under a star-filled sky at Cool Today Park, toured the new 10,000-acre master-planned community of Wellen Park, and enjoyed frozen yogurt at Peachwave West Villages. You can explore beaches from Venice, the Shark Tooth Capital of the World, to Englewood and Blind Pass Beach on Manasota Key.\n\nOne North Port restaurant to try near Cool Today Park:\n\nTarpon Point Grill & Marina\n\n121 Playmore Drive, Venice, FL 34293\n\nGetting there may be part of the fun. This former bait and tackle shop, campground, and marina offers a unique riverside dining experience. You can drive up, paddle up, or boat/jet ski up to the restaurant’s ramp, then enjoy casual food locally sourced in an outdoor setting under the shade of large tiki huts. Live entertainment will invite you to linger and enjoy river views, watch for manatees and alligators, and slow down at this little spot tucked away among the trees.\n\nWho Plays in North Port?\n\nThe Atlanta Braves play at Cool Today Park\n\nSpring Training in Lakeland\n\nLakeland Florida has 38 lakes and is known as Swan City\n\nLakeland is the largest city in Polk County and, true to its name, has 38 lakes to enjoy. It is famous as the home to Florida Southern College, the most extensive collection of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, and where Adam Sandler’s The Waterboy was filmed; it is known as Swan City. It’s also where you’ll find spring training for the Tigers.\n\nOne Lakeland Restaurant to try near Joker Merchant Park\n\nChef T’s Garden Grill\n\n1525 E. Gary Road, Lakeland, FL 33801\n\nChef T’s Garden Grill should be your choice in Lakeland when you want a cozy, classy, home-like atmosphere with top-tier chefs in the kitchen.\n\nWho Plays in Lakeland?\n\nThe Detroit Tigers play at Publix Field at Joker Merchant Stadium\n\nSpring Training in West Palm Beach\n\nThere are endless possibilities for things to do in West Palm Beach, Florida\n\nThe gorgeous waterfront year-round paradise is filled to the brim with things to do. Golfing, shopping, beaches, water sports, culture, and your choice of culinary masterpieces are just a scratch on the surface of what to enjoy in West Palm Beach. You could come for spring training year after year and never be at a loss for things to do.\n\nOne West Palm Beach Restaurant to try near the Ballpark\n\nFood Truck Roll-In at Northwood Village\n\nThe Food Truck Roll Event occurs periodically in this Bohemian-styled village just north of downtown WPB. If your trip falls on a date the food trucks are not there, try the:\n\nThe Grilled Cheese Gallery\n\n422 Northwood Rd West Palm Beach, FL 33407\n\nThis is your place if you’re a grilled cheese/mac n’ cheese connoisseur!\n\nWho Plays in West Palm Beach?\n\nThe Houston Astros play at the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches\n\nThe Washington National play at Ballpark of the Palm Beaches\n\nSpring Training in Jupiter\n\nThe iconic Jupiter Lighthouse is just one thing to see during spring training in the Florida town\n\nBaseball history in Jupiter goes back to the early 20th century when the Brooklyn Dodgers trained at the old Dubois Park. Florida’s perfect spring weather also brought the Chicago Cubs, Detroit Tigers, Washington Senators (now the Texas Rangers), and Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals) to the area. Today two teams share the stadium in Jupiter and enjoy everything Jupiter offers up, including world-renowned golf courses, Jupiter Inlet Lighthouse, Jonathan Dickinson State Park, beaches, and water sports.\n\nOne Restaurant in Jupiter to try near Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium\n\nDune Dog Cafe\n\n775 N. Alt. A1A, Jupiter, FL\n\nFor foot-long hot dogs and a Key West Vibe, head to Dune Dog Cafe. If hot dogs aren’t your thing, other family-fun and budget-friendly items are on the menu.\n\nWho Plays in Jupiter\n\nThe Miami Marlins play at Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals play at Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium\n\nSpring Training in Port St. Lucie\n\nFlorida’s Treasure Coast has something to discover every day of the week! Fishing on the Indian River, beaching on the Atlantic coast, world-class PGA golf courses, touring the Navy UDT-SEAL Museum, and more. I enjoyed the SEAL Museum and talking with veterans, learning about the evolution of this elite force, and seeing the actual hardware and vehicles used during operations. The Mets have been playing in Port Lucie since 1988 when they relocated from St. Petersburg to what was then known as Tradition Field.\n\nOne Restaurant to try near Clover Park\n\nThe Fort Steakhouse\n\n100 South 2nd Street, Fort Pierce, FL 34950\n\nNearby Fort Pierce along the Indian River is about 15 miles from the park and where you’ll find the “Best Restaurant on the Treasure Coast 2021 and 2022.” I love that they choose natural beef raised with no hormones or antibiotics because you are what you eat, eats, so having clean meat sources is a healthy win! Afterward, stroll the waterfront near downtown Fort Pierce.\n\nWho Plays in St. Lucie?\n\nThe New York Mets play at Clover Park"
