        "text": "Florida Grapefruit League Travel and Promotion Tips\n\nBy Nick Gandy, Florida Sports Foundation\n\nAs we prepare for Day One of the 2024 Florida Grapefruit League season, here’s a word to the wiser of the Baseball Fans heading out to one of 13 Florida locations between February 24 and March 26.\n\nThere’s a fun promotion at a lot of the ballparks and there’s some ways to look at the more than 200 game schedule and find some interesting ways to see MLB’s finest Under The March Sun.\n\nHere’s something you’ll find with a deep dive into the 2024 Schedule. We’ll begin with what I’ll call a “Trifecta Days Trip.”\n\nWhile there’s not too many of them this year, it’s a team hosting games on three successive days.\n\nFrom March 9 – 11, the Houston Astros host the Washington Nationals, Miami Marlins and Detroit Tigers on those three days at the Cacti Park of the Palm Beaches.\n\nMarch 23 – 25 finds the Pittsburgh Pirates hosting the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays at LECOM Park in Bradenton. That’s a must-see for fans of the American League East.\n\nIt’s not three consecutive days, but for those in the Clearwater area between March 21 – 25, the Philadelphia Phillies host the Tampa Bay Rays March 21 and 25, the Detroit Tigers, March 22 and the Toronto Blue Jays, March 24. Four games at Baycare Ballpark in five days.\n\nHere’s some interesting weekend tour dates in some of the more populated Florida Spring Training areas, the weekend of March 1-3.\n\nTry this trio of games in the Tampa Bay area. Friday, March 1, Miami Marlins at Philadelphia Phillies at Baycare Ballpark in Clearwater. Saturday, March 2, Atlanta Braves at Toronto Blue Jays at TD Ballpark in Dunedin. Sunday, March 3, Detroit Tigers at New York Yankees at George M. Steinbrenner Field.\n\nMore of the same in the Fort Myers area. Friday March 1, Boston Red Sox at Minnesota Twins at the Lee Health Sports Complex. Saturday March 2, Boston Red Sox at Tampa Bay Rays at the Charlotte Sports Complex, in Port Charlotte. Sunday March 3, Toronto Blue Jays at Boston Red Sox at Jet Blue Park.\n\nOnto the East Coast. Friday March 1, New York Mets at St. Louis Cardinals at Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium. Saturday, March 2, St. Louis Cardinals at Houston Astros at the Cacti Park of the Palm Beaches. Sunday, March 3, Miami Marlins at Washington Nationals at the Cacti Park of the Palm Beaches.\n\nJust a few ways to maximize the number of teams to see in a few days. Isn’t that what it’s all about?\n\nThat and fun promotions. Speaking of which, here’s a few to look for. Check your favorite team’s schedule to see what else is available throughout the season.\n\n2024 Florida Spring Training Promotion Days\n\nBaltimore Orioles\n\nSaturday, February 24 – 2024 Schedule Magnet\n\nFriday, March 8 – Orioles Spring Training t-shirt\n\nSunday, March 17 – Rally Towel\n\nFriday, March 22 – Orioles cap\n\nSaturday, March 23 – Fireworks\n\nVarious times throughout the month – Seniors (60 and over) stroll the bases\n\nBoston Red Sox\n\nSunday, February 25 – Jimmy Buffett Margaritaville Day, with live music\n\nMonday, February 26 – Red Sox Hawaiian Shirt\n\nThursday, February 29 – Reversible Bucket Hat\n\nSaturday, March 2 – Have a Catch on the Field\n\nMinnesota Twins\n\nFebruary 24, 28; March 3, 20, 26 – Senior Days (Ticket Specials for 55+ fans)\n\nFebruary 27; March 3, 4, 16, 22 – Salute to Service Days (Ticket specials for active military, first responders, veterans, police officers, EMTs, firefighters and teachers)\n\nPittsburgh Pirates\n\nFebruary 25; March 3, 10, 16, 17, 23, 24 – Kids Run The Bases\n\nFebruary 25; March 3, 10 – Pirates Alumni Autographs on the concourse in right field.\n\nMarch 5 – Senior Expo and Tote Bag\n\nMarch 10 – LECOM toothbrush\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n\nSaturday, February 24 – Blue Jays Hawaiian Shirt\n\nEnjoy the season and be on the lookout for more Florida Spring Training tips throughout the season."
