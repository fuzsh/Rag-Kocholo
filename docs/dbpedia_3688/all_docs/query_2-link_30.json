        "text": "The Senators officially changed their name to Nationals in 1905, though the Senators name stuck throughout the remainder of their tenure in DC. If you look at that shirt as a throwback than the shirt itself is actually correct. I do not believe that it is an insult to the Twins or Rangers but a recognition of the game's history in Washington. After all their are pennants with the teams AL Championships flying by the scoreboard at Nationals Park. True the current club has no historical claim to them, but the city does.\n\nMost Twins stuff I see uses Est. 1961. I don't think any of us here take into account any of the Senators history besides Killerbrew and the other players we got from that franchise. The history, as far as I'm concerned, should stay in the city. Not always though. The Lakers should have the MPLS stuff. I think it comes down to if you change the identity with the move, ya kinda start fresh.\n\nJust my opinion on the matter.\n\nOh crap, did I just dig up that pile of worms again?\n\nI hate when teams do this. See: Senators, Ottawa. I can't rationally explain it but this bothers me way more than it should.\n\nBecause manufacturing history to \"fit in\" is silly. I categorize this with the Rays \"fauxbacks\" of a couple years ago -- though they never specifically claimed to be a different team.\n\nActually maybe a better example would be MLB teams honoring Negro League teams (good gesture, but it's still false representation). Same with the Raptors wearing \"Toronto Huskies\" uniforms (going back to '97) or the Heat wearing the Miami Floridians uniforms.\n\nAll about marketing, marketing, and more marketing.\n\nMost Twins stuff I see uses Est. 1961.

What the Nats are doing is totally different. They are trying to claim the lineage of the original Nats/Sens, the AL team that moved to MIN and still exists. The Nats came into existence in Montreal in 1969, and moved to DC in 2005. I don't remember MLB saying anything about leaving Montreal's history behind or allowing them to reclaim the Nats/Sens (although the move to DC did seem to center around the revival of the curly W logo).\n\nMost Twins stuff I see uses Est. 1961.

If they haven't been flying those pennants at the Met/Metrodome/Target Field, then they probably aren't going to come calling now."
