        "text": "The Major League Baseball season is officially underway as teams have descended to Florida to prepare for Opening Day at the end of March.\n\nSo what do grapefruits have to do with anything?\n\nIt's just what they call the games played in Florida during spring training. The Grapefruit League is not a spinoff baseball league like the XFL and USFL is to the NFL in football. Nor is it a collection of Minor League Baseball affiliates with ties to the big leagues, like the International League or the Florida State League. It's closer to basketball's Summer League, but if LeBron James and the biggest NBA stars took the court alongside players fighting for G-League positions and toured multiple arenas in Nevada or Utah for a month.\n\nEvery year, veterans, rookies and everyone in between play exhibition games across Florida for about five weeks, giving baseball fans a taste of the long season to come and bringing extra attention to cities like Fort Myers, Jupiter and Port St. Lucie.\n\nChanges to baseball rules:Pitch clocks, enlarged bases, ban on shifts? Get ready for wacky spring training | Opinion\n\nRed Sox and Twins:Lee County needs a tourism spending boost after Hurricane Ian. Can spring training deliver?\n\nSpring training in Jupiter: Stadium makeover payments must have 'public benefit,' town says\n\nSpring training stadium:St. Lucie completes $2.6 million project to replace Mets field for first time in 34 years\n\nHere's what you need to know about Florida spring training and the Grapefruit League:\n\nWhat does Grapefruit League mean?\n\nThe Grapefruit League refers to the Major League Baseball teams who go to Florida for spring training. The teams gather in the middle of February to get ready for the upcoming baseball season about a month and a half later. At the end of March, most of the players and staff will spread out across the nation to begin the regular season either at the MLB parks or their designated minor-league teams.\n\nThe games that are played serve more as a formality; the real intrigue comes not from the teams facing each other, but from the intrasquad competitions. Some players will use spring training to compete for a place in the starting lineup. Others will try to prove they're ready to be promoted higher up the minor-league system, or even make the big leagues. Players on new teams will use the time to get comfortable with their new teammates, and veterans recovering from injuries the previous season test their arms to make sure they can hit and pitch as usual.\n\nThe biggest winners of Grapefruit League games are the fans, who go on vacation from as far as Boston, New York and Minnesota to enjoy the Florida weather and get a closer and more relaxed look at their favorite players.\n\nWhich teams are in the Grapefruit League?\n\nThere are 15 teams who play in the Grapefruit League:\n\nAtlanta Braves\n\nBaltimore Orioles\n\nBoston Red Sox\n\nDetroit Tigers\n\nHouston Astros\n\nMiami Marlins\n\nMinnesota Twins\n\nNew York Mets\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\n\nPittsburgh Pirates\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n\nTampa Bay Rays\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n\nWashington Nationals\n\nWhere did Grapefruit League come from?\n\nThe term \"Grapefruit League\" is an homage to Florida's citrus industry.\n\nMajor-league teams began spring training in Florida in 1888, when the Washington Senators came south to Jacksonville. By 1914, enough teams had migrated their preseason camps to Florida that an informal circuit started forming.\n\nWho came up with the term \"Grapefruit League\" isn't known for sure, but one theory comes from a stunt involving an aviation stunt in Daytona Beach in 1915. According to Rodney Kite-Powell, curator of history at the Tampa Bay History Center, a pilot named Ruth Law took a Brooklyn Dodgers player in a plane to throw a baseball to his manager on the field below.\n\n\"I guess at some point he realized that might kill the guy,\" Kite-Powell told WTSP in Tampa. \"So instead of throwing a baseball, he threw a grapefruit. And the grapefruit hit the manager in the chest and exploded.\n\n\"The manager, for a few seconds, actually thought it was his chest that had exploded from the force of the baseball hitting him. And felt the juice, thought it was blood, screamed out, 'I'm dying! I'm dying!'\"\n\nWhat is the difference between the Grapefruit League and Cactus League?\n\nMLB teams hold their spring training camps in two states. The teams getting ready in Florida play in the Grapefruit League. The rest play their games in Arizona, and that's the Cactus League.\n\nHere are the 15 Cactus League teams and where they make their base camp:\n\nArizona Diamondbacks: Salt River Fields at Talking Stick, Scottsdale\n\nChicago Cubs: Sloan Park, Mesa\n\nChicago White Sox: Camelback Ranch, Glendale\n\nCincinnati Reds: Goodyear Ballpark, Goodyear\n\nCleveland Guardians: Goodyear Ballpark, Goodyear\n\nColorado Rockies: Salt River Fields at Talking Stick, Scottsdale\n\nKansas City Royals: Surprise Stadium, Surprise\n\nLos Angeles Angels: Tempe Diablo Stadium, Tempe\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers: Camelback Ranch, Glendale\n\nMilwaukee Brewers: American Family Fields of Phoenix\n\nOakland Athletics: Hohokam Stadium, Mesa\n\nSan Diego Padres: Peoria Sports Complex, Peoria\n\nSan Francisco Giants: Scottsdale Stadium\n\nSeattle Mariners: Peoria Sports Complex\n\nTexas Rangers: Surprise Stadium\n\nWhere does the Grapefruit League play?\n\nLooking to catch a Grapefruit League game this season? Here's where to go:\n\nAtlanta Braves: CoolToday Park, North Port\n\nBaltimore Orioles: Ed Smith Stadium, Sarasota\n\nBoston Red Sox: JetBlue Park, Fort Myers\n\nDetroit Tigers: Publix Field at Joker Merchant Stadium, Lakeland\n\nHouston Astros: Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach\n\nMiami Marlins: Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium, Jupiter\n\nMinnesota Twins: Hammond Stadium at Lee County Sports Complex, Fort Myers\n\nNew York Mets: Clover Park, Port St. Lucie\n\nNew York Yankees: George M. Steinbrenner Field, Tampa\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies: BayCare Ballpark, Clearwater\n\nPittsburgh Pirates: LECOM Park, Bradenton\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals: Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium, Jupiter\n\nTampa Bay Rays: Tropicana Field, St. Petersburg (the Rays' regular spring training stadium in Port Charlotte was damaged by Hurricane Ian)\n\nToronto Blue Jays: TD Ballpark, Dunedin\n\nWashington Nationals: Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach\n\nWhen is Grapefruit League 2023?"
