        "text": "The Washington Nationals and Major League Baseball are making it faster and easier for fans to come through the gates at Nationals Park with the implementation of MLB Go-Ahead Entry, a hands-free, frictionless ballpark entry experience. Fans can register now in the MLB Ballpark app and to use Go-Ahead Entry throughout the 2024 season.\n\nGo-Ahead Entry uses facial authentication technology, which allows ticket holders who have opted-in to the service to enter the ballpark at dedicated gates at full walking speed without stopping. Nationals Park will use four total Go-Ahead Entry lanes during the regular season– two on the west end of the Center Field Gates; one at the First-Base Gate; and one at the Right Field Gate. One lane will be open in Center Field for ON DECK: NATIONALS FUTURES GAME on Tuesday, March 26, for fans who would like an early look at this new technology.\n\nFans can enroll in Go-Ahead Entry by logging into the MLB Ballpark app and following the prompts to capture an image of the user’s face. The image is converted into a unique alphanumeric code and then deleted, while the code, also known as a token, is associated with the individual fan’s account. When an enrolled fan walks through a Go-Ahead Entry lane, a facial authentication camera scans their face to match it with the enrolled token in the system and then allows access. Enrolled fans can use MLB Go-Ahead Entry at any park where the service is in place.\n\nMLB Go-Ahead Entry includes a combination of free-flow security screening technology and facial authentication-based gate management, resulting in quicker, hands-free entry into the ballpark. MLB’s Go-Ahead Entry system technology uses a camera that identifies any opted-in fan as a registered member as they walk in, automatically validating tickets once identified. Fans who used Go-Ahead Entry lanes during last season’s pilot program at Citizens Bank Park went through 68% faster than a traditional entry lane, with 2.5 times more traffic than the next fastest traditional lane.\n\nNationals Park guests who opt-in to MLB Go-Ahead Entry can enjoy a truly hands-free experience while entering Nationals Park. CEIA OPENGATE technology implemented in 2022 enabled fans to walk through security without removing items from their pockets or clear bags, while MLB Go-Ahead Entry allows them to move through ticketing without needing to scan a barcode. Users who have multiple tickets attached to a token can also seamlessly bring their entire party through the same gate, as the technology will tell game-day staffers how many tickets are associated with an account."
