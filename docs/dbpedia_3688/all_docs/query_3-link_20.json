        "text": "The 30 MLB teams are migrating to their sunny southern spring training facilities in Arizona and Florida and have begun their first spring training games in the Cactus League and Grapefruit League.\n\nIn about a month, all the teams will break training and return to their home stadiums in late March, when they will have three days of exhibition games before the official season begins on March 28.\n\nWhere do MLB teams play for Spring training?\n\nSpring training sites are split between two states with 15 teams each. Arizona teams are in the Cactus League, and Florida teams are in the Grapefruit League. The teams will prepare for their season and compete against other teams in their league for a month. For MLB fans, it offers up-close player action in intimate ballparks.\n\nWhen do MLB players report?\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers pitchers and catchers reported early on Feb. 9. Position players arrived on Feb. 11. San Diego Padres's pitchers and catchers also reported early on Feb. 11 while position players arrived five days later.\n\nThe other team's pitchers, catchers and position players were scheduled to arrive at their destination between Feb. 15 and Feb. 20.\n\nHow far do MLB teams travel to their spring training stadium?\n\nThe annual arrival of \"Truck Day\" signals the unofficial beginning of each MLB team's season. It's the day crews from each team pack equipment onto a big rig and head to their spring training facility. Some travel a few hundred miles. Others travel more than a thousand.\n\nWhere are the Spring training stadiums?\n\nSpring training sites in Florida's Grapefruit League are scattered across central Florida, while Arizona's Cactus League sites are concentrated in the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n\nIn the Cactus League, Cleveland Guardians travel the farthest to get to spring training, about 1,763 miles, as the crow flies. The Arizona Diamondbacks' home field is just about 13 miles from their spring training site.\n\nIn the Grapefruit League in Florida, the Minnesota Twins travel the farthest to get to their spring training site in Fort Myers, about 1,423 miles. The Tampa Bay Rays are located just up the road in Tampa from their training site in Port Charlotte, about 61 miles away."
