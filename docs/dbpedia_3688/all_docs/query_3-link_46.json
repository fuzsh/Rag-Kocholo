In right center field, an outdoor tiki bar beckons, and drink rails line the walkway so fans can stop and catch the action. There is a new LED scoreboard and Jays Shop, in addition to renovated bathrooms, concessions and suites.\n\nHistorical Name: TD Ballpark was originally called Dunedin Stadium at Grant Field. Grant Field opened in 1930 and was named after the mayor of Dunedin Albert J. Grant (served 1927-1928), who had donated the land.\n\nThe first Toronto Blue Jays game ever was played there on March 11, 1977 when the Blue Jays beat the New York Mets 3-1. From 1977-1989, the Blue Jays played at Grant Field, which had a seating capacity of 3,417.\n\nThe stadium has also been known as Knology Park (2004-2008) and Florida Auto Exchange Stadium (2010-2017). In November 2019, the Jays announced that TD Bank had acquired naming rights for the renovated stadium, which would be named TD Ballpark, as it is today.\n\nA state-of-the-art facility unlike any other! Sitting on a 65-acre site, the Player Development Complex (PDC) is the training facility of the Toronto Blue Jays Major and Minor League operations. The 115,000 square-foot building is located at 3031 Garrison Road, Dunedin, approximately 10 minutes away from TD Ballpark where the Blue Jays play their games.\n\nPlayer Development Complex Features\n\n6 Fields (5 brand new)\n\n2 Half Fields\n\nCovered Practice Field\n\n20 Gang Mounds\n\n12 Covered Batting Cages\n\nSpeed Hill\n\nObservation Tower\n\nWeight Room\n\nMovement Studio\n\nSports Science Labs\n\nHydrotherapy Room (hot/cold tubs, pool)\n\nTraining Room\n\nClubhouse (lockers, equipment & laundry rooms)\n\nKitchen & Dining Areas\n\nWorkrooms, Conference & Meeting Rooms\n\nMedia Room\n\nBarber Shop & Nutrition Stations\n\nPlayer Lounge & Family Room\n\nPlayer Development Complex Earns Two Green Globes Rating\n\nThe Player Development Complex is certified by The Green Building Initiative and received a Two Green Globes rating for new construction. This level of sustainability is an outstanding accomplishment. The certification and Two Green Globes rating demonstrates leadership in applying the best practices regarding energy, water, and environmental efficiency.
