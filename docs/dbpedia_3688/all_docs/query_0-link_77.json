        "text": "In Florida, one of the many joys of spring is practice baseball. And, as usual, Major League Baseball will deliver as much in just a few days as preparations begin for the upcoming season.\n\nThere was nothing “usual” about the past three spring trainings. COVID-19 did a double play on the schedule in 2020 and 2021, and a labor lockout led to an amended slate in 2022.\n\nOf course, this year is not without disruptions. Hurricane Ian did so much damage to Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte that the Tampa Bay Rays will report to Disney’s Wide World of Sports in Lake Buena Vista for a few weeks before shifting to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn addition, the World Baseball Classic returns after COVID canceled the 2021 event. The international tournament pulls several players from their major league camps to represent their home countries. A handful of games will be played at the Miami Marlins’ loanDepot Park.\n\nAs for spring training proper in Florida and Arizona, pitchers and catchers participating in the WBC will arrive at camps Feb. 13. Those not taking part have reporting dates between Feb. 15-17.\n\nPosition players for the WBC will report Feb. 16, while the rest arrive Feb. 20 or 21\n\nTo get you prepared for the Grapefruit League — as spring training is known in the Sunshine State — here are a few needed nuggets to digest before bats crack, mitts pop and umpires cry out, “Play ball!”\n\nAtlanta Braves\n\nLocation: CoolToday Park, North Port.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 16, others, Feb 21.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nBaltimore Orioles\n\nLocation: Ed Smith Stadium, Sarasota.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 16, others, Feb. 21.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nBoston Red Sox\n\nLocation: JetBlue Park at Fenway South, Fort Myers.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 15, others, Feb. 20.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nDetroit Tigers\n\nLocation: Publix Field at Joker Marchant Stadium, Lakeland.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 15, others, Feb. 20.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nHouston Astros\n\nLocation: Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 16, others, Feb. 21.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nMiami Marlins\n\nLocation: Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium, Jupiter.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 16, others, Feb. 21.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nMinnesota Twins\n\nLocation: CenturyLink Sports Complex, Fort Myers.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 16, others, Feb. 20.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nNew York Mets\n\nLocation: Clover Park, Port St. Lucie.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 15, others, Feb. 20.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nLocation: Steinbrenner Field, Tampa.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 16, others, Feb. 20.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\n\nLocation: BayCare Ballpark, Clearwater.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 16, others, Feb. 21.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nPittsburgh Pirates\n\nLocation: LECOM Park, Bradenton.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 15, others, Feb. 20.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n\nLocation: Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium, Jupiter.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 15, others, Feb. 20.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nTampa Bay Rays\n\nLocation: Through Feb 28 at Wide World of Sports Complex, Lake Buena Vista; Tropicana Field, St. Petersburg.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 15, others Feb. 20.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n\nLocation: TD Ballpark, Dunedin.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 16, others, Feb. 21.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nWashington Nationals\n\nLocation: Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, West Palm Beach.\n\nReporting dates: Pitchers and catchers, Feb. 15, others, Feb. 21.\n\nTickets, schedule and more info\n\nCactus League (Arizona)"
