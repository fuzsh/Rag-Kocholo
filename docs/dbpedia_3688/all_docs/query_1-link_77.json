        "text": "Cabrera To Paternity List, Nance Activated\n\nIt isn’t much news, but it is news. Genesis Cabrera is leaving the team to go on the Paternity list. He can miss up to three games. Tommy Nance, an RHP, was picked up from the Padres just yesterday for ‘cash considerations.’ He’s pitched 62 games in the MLB, split between the Cubs and the Marlins (in 2021 and 2022, respectively).\n\nGenesis Cabrera’s suspension reduced to two games following appeal\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays will be without left-handed reliever Genesis Cabrera for the next two games. The team announced ahead of Tuesday’s game against the Houston Astros that Cabrera will be suspended for two games for his role in a benches-clearing altercation between the Blue Jays and Tampa Bay Rays over the weekend.\n\nMLB suspends Blue Jays’ Genesis Cabrera, Mets’ Yohan Ramirez\n\nMLB reportedly suspended Toronto Blue Jays and New York Mets pitchers Genesis Cabrera and Yohan Ramirez for three games, per ESPN.
