        "text": "WEST PALM BEACH — Let’s pick it up from March 13, 2020. Forget the last 353 days. Nothing of consequence happened in baseball anyway &mldr; outside of L.A., that is.\n\nSpring training is back. OK, not like we were accustomed, with kids and collectors clustered around the dugouts seeking autographs, berms packed with sun-seeking pasty-white tourists, fans congregating in the beer line to reminisce about the days pitchers were allowed to go more than seven innings.\n\nNot this spring, as we approach the one-year mark of the coronavirus pandemic gripping the country.\n\nBut for the first time in nearly a year, fans in Florida are allowed to watch live baseball.\n\nAnd it feels liberating.\n\n“I teared up,” said Jamie Kirsch, 35, of Coral Springs when hearing she could purchase tickets for Grapefruit League games. “This is the happiest I’ve been in about a year.”\n\n“It’s been torture,” Rachel Panarites, 27, a Marlins fan from Fort Lauderdale said about the last year without any live baseball.\n\nMore: Spring Training 2021: Mets, Cardinals games sold out; Astros, Nationals, Marlins tickets limited\n\nMore: Roger Dean Stadium, Ballpark of Palm Beaches ready to host spring training with revised schedules\n\nSafely distanced in pods of two, four or six, about 1,500 fans eagerly entered the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches around noon Sunday for the Astros and Marlins spring opener. While nothing much has changed between the white lines other than managers Don Mattingly of the Marlins and Dusty Baker of the Astros agreeing to a seven-inning game, won by the Marlins, 6-1, so much has changed in our mask-wearing, hand-washing world.\n\nOne fan, sitting in the berm where large squares are painted in the grass to keep spectators in their personal bubbles, wondered before the first pitch: “If they hit a home run can you run for the ball?”\n\nThe answer, apparently, is \"yes.\" It did not take long for fans to step outside their square to track down a souvenir, with the Marlins jumping on the Astros with two homers in the top of the first inning; Jazz Chisolm to lead off the game and Lewis Brinson, a blast that cleared the berm, three batters later, giving Miami a 4-0 lead.\n\n“I’m not worried about the wins and losses out there, but there is only one way to play the game,\" Mattingly said. \"I’m more concerned about the way we get after it and how we play.\n\n“Good to see our guys put some runs on the board and being aggressive.\"\n\nMore: D’Angelo: Derek Jeter sticking with long-term plan after Marlins' playoff run in COVID-19 shortened season\n\nThe Astros and Nationals had just played a routine spring game at the Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, and the Marlins and Cardinals had finished up their day at Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter one year ago when baseball went into its prolonged seventh inning stretch.\n\nWhile the regular season resumed in late July with a 60-game schedule followed by expanded playoffs, of which the Marlins qualified for the first time in 17 years, the start of spring in 2021 remained in doubt until the 11th hour.\n\nAnd unless you were one of the teams in the NLCS or World Series playing in Arlington, Texas, where fans were allowed in limited numbers, Sunday was the first time these players were in front of live fans, not cardboard cutouts and covered seats.\n\n“It felt way better with the fans,” Chisholm said. “Just to be able to interact and make eye contact with them. They were as happy as we were to be out here.”\n\nMattingly didn’t think about it until the gates opened.\n\n“It was really nice,” he said. “See fans kind of hanging on the rails a little bit again and yelling at you, it was good. There were a lot of Marlins fans there, really nice to see. It was nice to have that interaction and not be a cardboard cutout, actually people there watching you and cheering one way or the other.”\n\nThose Marlins fans started a \"Let’s go, Marlins\" chant as the visitors jumped on the home team early. Probably among them were Panarites and Sean Pelletier. Both are passionate Miami sports fans who needed to get their fix before baseball started, attending Dolphins games in the fall and now cheering on the surging Panthers.\n\n“This is a huge day,” said Pelletier, 27. “We were here last year, and we didn’t think it would be our last day for a calendar year. We’re so pumped to be here today.”\n\nAnd they were not the only ones.\n\n“Everybody’s really excited to be back,” Marlins pitcher Nick Neidert said. “It’s like little kids going into a candy store.”"
