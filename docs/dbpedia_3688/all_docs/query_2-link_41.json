        "text": "Attending a Washington Nationals Game at CACRTI Park of the Palm Beaches\n\nWhen CACTI Park of the Palm Beaches opened in 2017, Washington Nationals fans were exposed to the latest in high-end fan experiences — with definite nods to the state’s spring-training and architectural traditions.\n\nThe goal of the $148 million construction, according to the project’s design team, has CACTI Park of the Palm Beaches offering an immersive spring-training experience, one that takes fans through training fields and workout facilities before they even set foot in the 6,400 seat ballpark. This is a definite design trend in recent years at spring-training facilities. This exposes fans to players and training fields on your way to their seat, building expectations for game action.\n\nThat heightened spring-training experience is the goal. To that end, a ballpark is being designed to present the essential Florida experience – or experiences, whether it be memories of old golf resorts or lazy spring-break days spent at the beach. And they’re also focusing on the essential spring-training experience — not just the games.\n\nDirections to CACTI Park of the Palm Beaches\n\nFind in Google Maps\n\nFROM I-95 NORTH: Exit I-95 onto 45th Street.
