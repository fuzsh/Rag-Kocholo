        "text": "Take me out to the ballgame! Spring training games are back in Florida as Major League Baseball teams prepare for the 2024 season.\n\nFor the next five weeks or so, 15 MLB teams will make preseason tours of cities up and down Florida's Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Star players will be getting ready for the long season ahead, and managers will decide on which rookies and veterans will fill out roster spots for Opening Day at the end of March.\n\nIn the meantime, baseball fans from Minneapolis and Detroit to Boston and New York will be coming to cities like Fort Myers, Lakeland, West Palm Beach and Port St. Lucie to get an early look at their favorite teams. Will they see a big difference in MLB's new jerseys and pants that's raising such consternation among players?\n\nSpring training schedules: Here's a look at when MLB teams play their last preseason games in Florida\n\nHere's what you need to know about Florida spring training for 2024, including schedules for all 15 teams and how to get tickets.\n\nWhat is MLB spring training? Why do they call it the Grapefruit League and Cactus League?\n\nSpring training is the preseason for Major League Baseball. The 30 teams gather at various complexes in Florida and Arizona to get ready for the season.\n\nThe exhibition games they play are referred to as the Grapefruit League for the 15 teams in Florida and the Cactus League for the 15 in Arizona. Regular MLB players won't play too much during these games, but the intimate stadiums and warm weather make spring training a vacation destination for fans across the country, especially for those looking to escape the cold.\n\nWhat's going on with the new MLB uniforms? Are the pants really see-through?\n\nThe biggest story heading into this baseball season isn't related to the defending champion Texas Rangers, or even with the Los Angeles Dodgers' incredible signing of reigning AL MVP Shohei Ohtani (among other high-priced free agents). Nope, everyone's complaining about the new uniforms.\n\nLong story short, baseball's new Nike Vapor Premier uniforms, which were designed by Nike and made by Fanatics, are not very popular. Players and fans alike have been critical of the quality of the material and stylistic changes, saying the jerseys look like a \"replica\" jersey, a \"T-shirt or a gym shirt\" and that \"they look cheap.\" (The official game-worn jerseys cost $430, by the way, while the least expensive official jerseys are $135.) There have been complaints that some of the colors were off from traditional team designs, and the names on the backs of jerseys are significantly smaller.\n\nAnd that's before we get to the see-through pants.\n\nTony Clark, executive director of the players union, said the MLBPA is working to resolve the issue in time for Opening Day. Commissioner Rob Manfred has defended the new uniforms, saying \"there's going to be some negative feedback\" anytime something changes.\n\nWhat is the spring training schedule for 2024 in Florida?\n\nSpring training starts Saturday, February 24 across Florida. Games will be played every day until Tuesday, March 26.
