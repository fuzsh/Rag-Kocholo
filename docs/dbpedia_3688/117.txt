Tonight, the Nationals will board a plane to Washington, D.C. and officially end their Grapefruit League season (with a losing record). And maybe then, we'll know who the closer is... But more likely than not, we won't.

This is fine, this is just fine.

For the last time this year, here's what's new in West Palm Beach.

If Blake Treinen closes, the Nats may have their deepest bullpen ever

"There's no proven closer on the roster, but if Treinen gets the ninth, Kelley gets the eighth, Blanton gets the seventh, and Glover can come in whenever. Perez will be Perez, but if Romero locates, this could be a pretty dominating group."

Stephen Strasburg throws final tuneup before Opening Day

Strasburg allowed two earned runs over four innings in his final outing before he pitches on April 3rd, and is feeling generally good all around.

Here's how you can get those MGM seats next to the dugout

Hint: Spend a lot of money at the casino.

Nats trim roster to 27 with latest (and likely second-to-last) round of cuts

Jhonatan Solano, A.J. Cole, Trevor Gott, Vance Worley, Jacob Turner, and Neal Cotts are all headed back down to minor-league camp.

Nats season preview: Going player by player

Each key player gets a blurb, and the good folks at the Post give you info about the Nats you've always wanted to know but never asked.

What have the Nats' bench players done with all their spare time? Become best friends, of course.

"Chris Heisey and Stephen Drew, the resident 'good kids' on the Nats' bench, have brought a lighthearted outlook (and good coffee) to the Nats' bench, and to the entire team."

At this point, the Nats are just 'trying to get out of here healthy'

"Bryce Harper, among others, has shown that he's more than ready to start the regular season. Matt Wieters and Adam Eaton, on the other hand, may not be quite ready. Don't fret, they will be soon. What's important now is that they're healthy."

Is the Nats' window to win a World Series closing? Depends on who you ask.

The Nats' current core--Bryce Harper and Mike Rizzo included--essentially have two more years to get it done. (If they want to win one for Jayson Werth, they only have this season to do it.)

Anthony Rendon and Trea Turner are continuing their bromance from last year

"You're my favorite player!" will now hopefully be heard throughout the dugout for a full 162 games this upcoming season.

The Sky's The Limit For Victor Robles

"That’s Robles in a nutshell—a young, electrifying player who can impact the game on both sides of the ball."

Nats reach final day in Florida with few remaining concerns

"Having already built up his arm, Strasburg was held back a bit this afternoon, throwing only 61 pitches over four innings."

The Nats' roster isn't exactly perfect, but there's time to improve

The Nats have always been players at the midseason trade deadline, whether if it's acquiring big names such as Mark Melancon or (then) prospects like Wilson Ramos. Most of the time, it kind of works.

Ryan Zmmerman hopes that lighter weights help him have heavyweight success

Ryan Zimmerman has already slumped and then come back in roaring fashion once, so hopefully he won't have to do it again this year. Either way, he's healthy for now.

There may be a few disadvantages to the new MGM National Harbor Dugout Club

Let's just say that black leather, heat, and humidity aren't going to combine well.

Nationals inch toward final 25

"There is still no resolution on the closer. At least not a public one. Baker was asked again Wednesday and again said he will let the media know, eventually."

2017 MLB season preview: SI's World Series picks

"Before the coming season, we asked our group of MLB experts to choose their playoff teams and World Series winner for this year."

Circle Change: Daniel Murphy Raises the Ghost of an Idea

"The opaque, corporeal Murphy smiled, flattered by the optimism, but felt his head shaking itself. It wasn’t the first time he’d heard this."

From heartbreak to managerial track for former Expo Randy Knorr

"To overcome the emptiness and grief, Knorr quickly retreated to his workplace in the company of his fellow coaches, players and other club officials."

Washington Nationals 2017 season preview

"One shouldn’t read too much into spring stats, but Harper has been absolutely smashing following his injury-marred 2016 campaign."

2017 Preview: Washington Nationals

"Every hero has his Achilles heel, and the Nationals’ weakness appears to be the health (or lack thereof) of its starting rotation."

NL preview: Nationals, Dodgers among those aiming to topple Cubs

"Stephen Strasburg, Nationals: A strained flexor mass knocked him out of the playoffs, perhaps the difference in Washington’s five-game loss to the Dodgers."

MLB preview 2017: Get ready for another Mets-Nationals race

"With Bryce Harper’s free agency clock ticking and (relative) health for game-changing starters Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, it feels like the window will only be open for so long."

Where to find the best drinks at Nats Park

"Plenty of new beverage options will join the lineup at Nats Park in addition to some popular standbys this season, said Jonathan Stahl, vice president of ballpark operations."
