        "text": "With the constant evolution of anti-financial crime (AFC) regulation, compliance programs need constant revision in order to ensure that they are in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nBerlin Risk has extensive experience in advising institutions on how to implement the regulatory updates andimprove their processes and procedures and is also involved in remediation and other operational projects including Know Your Customer (KYC), Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC), Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) and investigations.

According to the Federal Office for Security and Information Technology (BSI), the threat is constantly growing also in Germany also. Although, information security has always been essential its importance is constantly growing, regardless of the size of a company, organization or institution.\n\nAn efficient information security aims to protect all information assets with regard to their confidentiality, integrity and availability. An information security management system (ISMS) should lie within the remit of senior management and be operationally controlled by one or more information security officers (ISO). In addition to identifying all information assets and ISMS focuses on determining information security requirements as well as risk management including risk analysis and risk treatment.\n\nWe support you in achieving your efforts to protect your assets by implementing adequate information security measures so your company, organization or institution is protected against economic risks, impairment of operational processes or any reputational damage caused by information security incidents.\n\nInformation security is complex. We guide you in managing all challenges and provide you with targeted support in identifying, prioritizing and focusing on key information security requirements. Together with you and tailored to your individual operational, technical, capacity and budgetary requirements, we advise you in the development and implementation, planning, maintenance and continuous improvement of single measures, in implementing an ISMS and/or in assisting you as an external ISO.\n\nOur special service for SMEs: As a registered consultant, Berlin Risk Advisors is authorized to carry out the CyberRisikoCheck, developed for small- and medium-sized enterprises using the software provided by the German Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI).\n\nYour benefits\n\nHolistic approach\n\nFocus on the essentials – we identify your key risks and information security requirements as the basis for implementing all important measures\n\nRegistered consultant for the implementation of the CyberRiskCheck developed by the BSI\n\nServices tailored to you and your information security needs: ranging from training courses and the design of individual measures to advice on the development and implementation of an ISMS with or without certification requirements\n\nInformation security officer (ISO) as a service – to coordinate all information security measures within your company\n\nExperienced and certified experts\n\nAn interdisciplinary team with many years of strategic and operational experience in process and risk management as well as IT security\n\nNews and updates – as podcast or article\n\nIn 2022, Berlin Risk implemented an information security management system (ISMS) and documented its effectiveness through the certification process and in accordance with the ISO 27001 standard.\n\nWithin one year, a team including members of the management, operations and IT set up an ISMS, using the PDCA cycle, a repetitive process consisting of the 4 phases plan, do, check, act.\n\nThe process up to certification included all elements mentioned above, with a focus on the ISO standard and its requirements.\n\nThe implementation of all measures was followed by an internal audit, the management review, improvements, the external audit and finally the certification in July 2023. Currently and going forward the ISMS is continuously evaluated and improved as required.\n\nBerlin Risk understands the politics of doing business in challenging jurisdictions. This is why we are able to assist companies working internationally in managing risks linked to political interferences.\n\nWe support our clients in reducing their exposure to political risks. Our expertise in conflict management enables us to offer specific advice ranging from dispute prevention to negotiation settlement.\n\nKey political risks for a company operating in a foreign country:\n\nNew regulations in relevant business sector\n\nDiscriminatory governmental action restricting continuity and control of business operations\n\nBreach of public contract\n\nImpact of corruption and questionable connections among political officials, security forces and national business\n\nSecurity threats posed by political violence\n\nPopular unrest and labour disputes due to social discontent\n\nPolitical uncertainty following elections or regime collapse with far-reaching impact on business operations.\n\nWe view the political environment around an industry as an arena in which diverse stakeholders pursue their vested interests. By knowing how political risks are interconnected and dynamically change, we help our clients navigate competitive political environments on both the national and local levels. We provide critical information concerning political stability, legal issues, regulatory requirements, or any other factors that may affect business operations or investment within any given country.\n\nAn international investor was looking to co-finance the expansion of a Gulf-based corporation and was concerned about the political risk exposure involved.\n\nResearch and enquiries into the company and its management revealed that both the beneficial owners and the management were closely connected to the country’s political leadership. It also uncovered concerns around the individuals’ and their families’ links to both the Syrian regime and parts of the opposition. In particular, legal proceedings arising from allegations that the individuals in question had been involved in funding armed Syrian resistance groups, increased both the reputational and legal risks attached to the planned engagement.\n\nThe client decided to await the pending court decision, and in the meantime sought to develop risk mitigation measures, including a possible modification of the ownership structure, to reduce the risk exposure. In addition, recommendations for an overhaul of the organisation’s overall governance structure were developed.\n\nCompliance teams are striving to innovate by using RegTech solutions, in order to effectively manage the increased day-to-day complexity of mitigating their exposure to financial crime, sanctions, ESG and reputational risk.\n\nBased on Berlin Risk’s research, the chart sets out an indicative overview of RegTech tools, which although not claiming to be exhaustive are relevant for financial and anti-cybercrime professionals and can be considered as elements of a possible anti-financial crime tech-stack.\n\nBerlin Risk Advisors has partnered with a select number of companies who provide an added value to due diligence and risk assessment efforts, as well as improving the basis for audit purposes.\n\nOur experts, who are trained on the various solutions, and have extensive user experience, provide advice on which tools and solutions can be implemented to achieve a fit-for-purpose tech-stack tailored to individual business models and their specific risk exposure.\n\nReputational risk assessment is a best practice approach for companies that apply the principles of responsible business conduct. We have developed a dedicated Reputational Risk Assessment Methodology (RRAM) that goes beyond the legal approach to compliance, addressing issues of concern that might negatively impact your organisation, including through stakeholder action.\n\nOur RRAM and the associated tool follow a holistic approach in supporting companies’ risk management, fostering synergies with the compliance and communications functions.\n\nThe RRAM covers the interconnected risk areas of:\n\nBusiness relationships and behavior\n\nPolitical risk and exposure\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) issues\n\nThe purpose of reputational risk assessment lies in improving resilience against known and unknown risks that might jeopardise a company’s continuity and control of its business. Our RRAM was built on our experience in governance risk compliance advisory, integrity due diligence investigations and our already existent risk assessment tools, such as the Reputational Risk Meter and Political Risk Analysis System.\n\nA large infrastructure project in an African country involved international financing and the engagement of an experienced engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor. Berlin Risk Advisors was asked by one of the financiers to undertake a reputational risk assessment of the EPC contractor, in order to identify any hidden issues of concern.\n\nSystematic scrutiny of reputational risk factors, including thorough interviews with human sources, revealed the EPC company had been accused of several anti-trust violations in other countries. In addition, it was part of a joint venture with a state-owned company in another African country that was associated with higher corruption risk. A further reputational issue stemmed from the fact that a controversial Chinese state-owned company was discovered to hold a minority shareholding interest in the EPC contractor, raising possible future governance concerns. Finally, reputational risks were identified with respect to controversies surrounding the environmental and social impact of the project, as well as the political interests involved.\n\nThe reputational risk assessment resulted in the introduction of a number of contractual risk mitigation measures, including procurement and subcontracting agreements, for the implementation of the project. In addition, we recommended that the client request additional assurance from the EPC contractor with regard to global compliance with anti-trust regulations and corporate governance standards. The client was also advised to closely monitor the contractor’s business conduct through regular screening of media reports, to enable it to identify and react to any emerging reputational concerns, including potential ESG issues."
