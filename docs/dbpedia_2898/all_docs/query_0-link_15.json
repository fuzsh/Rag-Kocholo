        "text": "Berlin\n\nBerlin office\n\nThe former Kaiserin-Auguste-Viktoria hospital is part of the current BAuA building complex in Berlin-Lichtenberg. The building has a long history in occupational health. The first German clinic for work-related diseases was established here as early as 1924. In 1948, the Central Institute of Industrial Hygiene was also founded in this location. The Federal Institute for Occupational Medicine emerged as a result from the reunification of 1989, originating from the GDR’s Central Institute for Occupational Health. In 1996, it was merged with the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to form what is now known as the BAuA. Occupational health continues to be the key focus area at the Berlin site.\n\nPostal address\n\nOffice address\n\nContact\n\nHow to get there\n\nOverview\n\nDetailed view\n\nArrival from Berlin Brandenburg Airport\n\n(Travel time to BAuA approx. 30 minutes)\n\nTransporttill stationRE 8, RB 23, FEX, to HauptbahnhofOstkreuzOstkreuz change to S-Bahn, lines:S-Bahn S5, to Mahlsdorf / Hoppegarten / Strausberg / Strausberg NordNöldnerplatzS-Bahn S7, S75 to Ahrensfelde, WartenbergNöldnerplatzS-Bahn S3, to ErknerRummelsburg\n\nArrival from Berlin Hauptbahnhof (Main Station)\n\n(Travel time to BAuA approx. 25 to 30 minutes)\n\nTransporttill stationS-Bahn S5, to Mahlsdorf / Hoppegarten / Strausberg / Strausberg NordNöldnerplatzS-Bahn S7, to AhrensfeldeNöldnerplatzS-Bahn S3, to ErknerRummelsburg\n\nArrival by car\n\nPlease use an online route planner."
