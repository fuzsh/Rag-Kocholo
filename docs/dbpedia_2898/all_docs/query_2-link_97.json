In recent years, many FDIC-supervised institutions have increased their reliance on models. The FDIC is adopting this Guidance to facilitate consistent model risk management expectations across the banking agencies and industry.\n\nThe FDIC recognizes that for institutions with under $1 billion in total assets, model use is typically not complex or significant, and generally does not pose elevated risk to these institutions. In addition, models used by such institutions are typically models that have been subject to longstanding supervisory guidance, such as asset liability management models that are subject to the interagency guidance on interest rate risk.\n\nAccordingly, it is not expected that this Guidance will pertain to FDIC-supervised institutions with under $1 billion in total assets unless the institution's model use is significant, complex, or poses elevated risk to the institution. In addition, Appendix A to Part 364 has long-established standards for safety and soundness for all FDIC-supervised institutions in the areas of internal controls and information systems; internal audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate exposure; asset quality; earnings; and compensation, fees, and benefits. To the extent that models are used in these major operating areas of the institution, model use should be consistent with the safety and soundness standards.\n\nThe Guidance defines models as \"a quantitative method, system, or approach that applies statistical, economic, financial, or mathematical theories, techniques, and assumptions to process input data into quantitative estimates.\" Tools used for simple mathematical calculations are not models covered by this Guidance, but should nonetheless be subject to a reasonable control process. It is important to note that certain qualitative approaches are considered models under the Guidance. FDIC-supervised financial institutions should establish practices to identify models used across the organization and ensure that model risk management practices are commensurate with the institution's risk exposure and the complexity and extent of model use.\n\nThe Guidance addresses the concept of \"effective challenge\" as a guiding principle for managing model risk and essential to effective model risk management. Effective challenge is \"critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and produce appropriate changes.\" Effective challenge refers to a combination of incentives, competence, and influence, as outlined in the Guidance. It is expected to be senior management's responsibility to ensure effective challenge takes place, and internal audit should ensure that appropriate effective challenge is being carried out.\n\nThe FDIC recognizes that many supervised institutions rely on models provided by vendors. The Guidance addresses the incorporation of vendor products into the institution's model risk management framework following the same principles as in-house models. Although much of the vendor product discussion in the Guidance is addressed under the Model Validation section, model risk management practices should not be limited to validation. Expectations for model risk management of vendor products are also addressed in the discussion of the model risk management process under the Model Development, Implementation, and Use section, as well as the Governance, Policies, and Controls section.\n\nFinally, institutions should be mindful of consumer compliance and fair lending requirements when using models. For example, banks should evaluate the variables used in a model to determine whether they present or increase consumer compliance or fair lending risk.\n\nAdditional Related Topics:"
