Burk Outstanding Service Awardee\n\nSeth Guikema, Professor, University of Michigan\n\nRisk Science is of tremendous importance in tackling the pressing problems of the future, and SRA is leading the charge to advance risk science. I am proud to serve SRA in whatever ways are needed, and I deeply appreciate receiving the SRA Richard J. Burk Outstanding Service Award.\n\nThroughout my nearly two-decade career in risk analysis, SRA has been my home professional society as well as a community in which I have matured professionally and found wonderful mentors. SRA has played a pivotal role in shaping my career. I have had the opportunity to give back to the SRA community by serving in a number of different roles, and I am grateful to be able to do this."
