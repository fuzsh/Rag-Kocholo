        "text": "About PSRAC\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) has partnered with the Urban Institute (Urban) to create the content for the Public Safety Risk Assessment Clearinghouse (PSRAC), a comprehensive online source for current and objective information on criminal justice risk and needs assessments. PSRAC brings together a wide range of resources from research and practice, and presents this information in a way that is easy to understand and use. PSRAC also provides training and technical assistance on issues related to the development, validation, adoption, implementation, and use of risk and needs assessments.\n\nBJA is a component of the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs working to support local, state, and tribal justice policy development and capacity building through grant administration, training, and technical assistance. Urban conducts research and evaluation to create evidence-based criminal justice policy and practice at the federal, state, and local levels. The development of PSRAC content was supported by Grant No. 2015-ZB-BX-K004 from BJA."
