This can be done either in the laboratory or in-situ in the field, both of which have their advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of a field study is that it portrays real world conditions along with interferences from a complex mixture of pollutants. Field deployment of sensors along with a co-located reference monitor allows for direct assessment of the data quality performance of the sensor devices.\n\nLearning Objectives: This course will demonstrate the basic steps of a co-location analysis from data already collected. Such an analysis not only illuminates the performance of the given sensors, but could be used to re-calibrate the instruments to provide improved performance. The analysis will consider various performance parameters such as precision, accuracy, error and discuss effects of temperature and relative humidity.\n\nAttendees of this course will utilize collocated reference and sensor data and evaluate performance based on several metrics. Data will already be uploaded online and an R Shiny package will be used for analysis. Data from several sites are likely to be used to illustrate issues. The instructors will also discuss other issues such as:\n\n1. Logistics: Permissions, space concerns and distance from other instruments’ sample inlets, insurance, safety, power, networking, access, etc.\n\n2. Choice of colocation site: how representative is the colocation site’s environment with the environment that the monitor will eventually be located? Discussion of the different types of sites (regional, near-roadway, etc.) that are operated by gov’t, as this often conditions the instruments and pollutant species that are collected there.\n\n3. How long should the colocation be? Re-colocation/re-calibration?\n\n4. Do all monitors need to be collocated/calibrated within a study/region?\n\n5. Measuring other covariates to understand sensor performance/calibration? E.g., temperature, humidity\n\n6. Identifying sensor limits of detection (high or low) and/or non-linear sensor response from colocation data.\n\n7. Identifying sensor drift or failure from colocation data.\n\nInstructors: Tai Lung\n\nFriday, July 30th, 2021 | 9:30 AM – 11:30 AM EST\n\nDescription: The public looks to health care providers for expertise in environmental health. Unfortunately, physicians receive very little formal training regarding environmental exposures and even less on the relationship to health outcomes. Medical school curricula are increasingly including instruction on social determinants of health as these factors are accepted influences for poor health outcomes. Building from this, attendees of this 2-hour workshop will learn how to use the US EPA’s EJSCREEN Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool, in conjunction with publicly available health outcome data to teach medical professionals the relationship between environmental exposures (lead-based paint and air pollution), social factors (race, economic status) and poor health outcomes, such as lead poisoning, asthma, and shortened life expectancy. As health educators and students may not have access to GIS applications or methods, the tools needed for this activity are an internet browser and a spreadsheet application with mapping capabilities such as Microsoft Excel.\n\nInstructors: Chisato Calvert, Jeremy Taub\n\nMonday, August 30th, 2021 | 9:00 AM – 11:00 AM EST\n\nDescription: This workshop will introduce the OpenAQ Platform, Tools, and Community to participants in order to inspire and empower them to apply – and contribute – open air quality data in new ways to their research. By participating in this workshop, participants will be able to:\n\n• Access more than half a billion near real-time air quality (PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, CO, SO2, and BC) data points from 11000+ stations in 93 countries via an online user interface, API and other methods\n\n• Create user-customized datasets for download\n\n• Analyze large batches of data quickly using AWS’ Athena and other open-source tools from the OpenAQ Community\n\n• Learn how open air quality data has been applied to various fields including research, journalism, policy, and education\n\n• Learn how to share air quality data obtained for research purposes on the OpenAQ Platform\n\n• Learn how to connect with the OpenAQ Community to gain new colleagues working on air quality issues from a variety of fields across the world.\n\nInstructors: Lindsey Martin\n\nMonday, August 30th, 2021 | 9:00 AM – 11:00 AM EST\n\nDescription: Implementation science is the study of methods to promote the adoption and integration of evidence-based interventions (e.g., programs, practices, and policies) into routine health care, community, and public health settings. This objective of this two-hour interactive workshop is to provide participants with a high-level overview of implementation science and its application to the field of environmental health. Topics that will be discussed include distinguishing effectiveness (e.g., intervention) studies from implementation studies, differentiating implementation outcomes from effectiveness outcomes, common implementation strategies, hybrid effectiveness-implementation designs, an overview of theories, models, and frameworks in implementation science, and the importance of community engagement in the implementation process. Participants will come away from the workshop with an introductory understanding of how to apply implementation science to their work in environmental health, and a list of resources to promote further study.\n\nLink to: 10 Key Ingredients Exercise\n\nLink to: ISES ImpSci EHS Workshop Annotated\n\nInstructors: Peter Fantke, Olivier Jolliet, Lei Huang\n\nMonday, August 30th, 2021 | 9:00 AM – 11:00 AM EST\n\nDescription: There is an increasing need for methods to assess exposure and related impacts of toxic chemical emissions on human health and ecosystems including consumer exposure. This course provides a practical overview of multimedia chemical fate modelling, near-field and far-field multi-pathway human exposure modelling, ecosystem and human health effects dose-response modelling, and comparative indicators for human-toxicological and ecotoxicological impacts. We explain basic concepts of environmental mass balance modelling including partitioning, first order cross-media transport, and persistence. We further introduce the concept of assessing multiple transfers between near-field and far-field environments and resulting exposures for consumers and the general population, discussing data and models available for detergents, building materials, food contact materials and personal care products. Along a series of practical examples, we will illustrate how fate, exposure, effect and damage factors can be combined to construct factors to characterize chemical emissions and chemicals in consumer products, building on the USEtox scientific consensus model and USEtox-compatible near-field models. We will conclude with a demonstration of how the models can be used in various applications, including the prioritization and ranking of chemicals for institutions like the European Commission or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nThe aim of this course is to introduce participants to the exposure science methods used in life-cycle and comparative risk assessments. Participants will learn to use and evaluate basic tools for mass-balance, fate modelling, near-field and far-field exposure and intake fraction, and effect factor estimation. Participants will review underlying model assumptions and evaluate data needs along with data and knowledge gaps in these assessments.\n\nThe course is intended for environmental science practitioners interested in the scientific fundamentals of chemical impact assessment for a broad range of environmental emissions. Only basic background knowledge of environmental modelling, risk assessment or life cycle assessment is considered necessary.\n\nParticipants will come away with knowledge of basic concepts of consumer and population exposure science for chemical impact assessment and be able to perform their own assessment using the latest release version of the scientific consensus model USEtox and related near-field models, and interpret results for their own application context.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nThe course is for PhD students, professionals and practitioners interested in state-of-the-art mass balance-based tools for use in life cycle impact assessment, human and ecological toxicity assessment, consumer exposure assessment, risk screening, chemical substitution and prioritization. No specific previous knowledge is required.\n\nProducts/Course materials\n\nShort course copies of all lecture presentation slides as well as working materials for the exercises will be distributed electronically. A copy of all presented modelling tools will be distributed. Course participants will be provided copies of all main scientific articles in electronic form.\n\nInstructors: Alison Krajewski, Lauren Wyatt, Alexandra Larsen\n\nFriday, August 6th, 2021 | 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM EST\n\nDescription: Data visualization is critical to conveying new findings in environmental health and is a vital part of advancing the field of environmental epidemiology around the globe. There are a variety of options for creating figures with licensed software, but data visualization packages like ggplot2/R are easily accessible and economical alternatives that can produce high quality and journal-ready figures. The syntax of ggplot2 is challenging to learn, so this workshop aims to allow participants to become comfortable with the syntax of ggplot2, create elegant, complex figures, and be comfortable applying the skills learned to their own research projects.\n\nThis workshop, led by a diverse, all-female panel of new researchers, will offer live-coding and interactive examples using R statistical software. This session will begin with a brief introduction to the ggplot2 package and supporting packages. Next, we will cover general practices for manipulating data structures and data formatting for creating ggplots. We will spend the majority of the workshop introducing examples of various plots that are frequently used in environmental epidemiology, focusing on the following aspects:\n\n• Adding confidence intervals to point estimates;\n\n• Manipulating background, axis, titles, legends, colors, themes;\n\n• Creating maps;\n\n• Saving and exporting high quality figures for presentations and publications.\n\nWe assume that participants will have some experience in statistical programming. No prior experience with ggplot is necessary, but this workshop is not meant to be an introduction to R.\n\nInstructors: Jessica Daniel, Anne Neale, Jose Zambrana\n\nSaturday, July 31st, 2021 | 1:30 PM – 4:00 PM EST\n\nDescription: EnviroAtlas (https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas) is a data-rich, web-based decision support tool that combines maps, analysis tools, downloadable data, and informational resources. It is used by states, tribes, communities, and individuals to help inform policy and planning decisions that impact the places where we live, learn, work and play. EnviroAtlas contains two primary tools: An Interactive Map, which provides access to 550+ environment-related and demographic maps and the Eco-Health Relationship Browser, which displays evidence from hundreds of scientific publications on the linkages between ecosystems, the services they provide, and human health. EnviroAtlas data are available for multiple extents for the U.S., from fine-scale data for individual municipalities to national datasets. This workshop will demonstrate how to use the two main interactive tools, including analysis tools built in to the Interactive Map. We will also do a deep dive into available EnviroAtlas data, focusing on topics of import to the ISES community, including: Impacts of public health policy, Climate change, Sustainability, Multiple stressor interactions, Use of “big data” in exposure science.\n\nAttendees will be trained on how to access the data online and download for use. The workshop will also cover resources available for specific user groups, including Downloadable Geospatial Toolboxes, Educational modules for classroom use, a guide for using EnviroAtlas in Health Impact Assessment, and more. Attendees will also get a sneak peek at upcoming EnviroAtlas features and data. The virtual workshop will invite interaction and engagement from attendees to explore their topics of interest.\n\nLink to: Webquest Conference\n\nLink to: EnviroAtlas Handout\n\nLink to: EnviroAtlasWorkshop ISES Attendee Agenda\n\nInstructors: Andrew Slocombe, Kelsey Ranjbar\n\nFriday, August 6th, 2021 | 1:00 PM – 3:00 PM EST\n\nDescription: Many California communities, including low-income and minority communities, face disproportionate and cumulative impacts from pollution. To better understand and identify these communities, CalEPA’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) developed CalEnviroScreen, a science-based mapping tool that identifies vulnerable California communities by census tract that are disproportionately burdened by multiple sources of pollution. This workshop will provide an overview and brief background of CalEnviroScreen, focusing on the scoring of pollution indicators and the concept of cumulative exposure and how that differs from traditional exposure assessment. There will then be an interactive portion to explore different areas of the state using CalEnviroScreen’s online mapping applications. The workshop will finish with opportunity for discussion on the benefits and limitations of the tool, it’s future potential, and methods to incorporate and/or improve additional exposure information into CalEnviroScreen.\n\nInstructors: Ana Rule, Juan Pablo Ramos Bonilla\n\nFriday, August 6th, 2021 | 10:00 AM – 12:00 PM EST\n\nDescription: Este taller está diseñado para proporcionar el conocimiento básico y la habilidad para realizar muestreos de aire para aerosoles biológicos y cómo analizar y presentar resultados.

From 2010 until now, her main concern has been the mitigation of elderly exposure to air pollutants and the potentiation of their quality of life. She has developed consistent R&D activities on the topics of susceptible population exposure to air pollutants, human health impacts to air pollutants, indoor and atmospheric air quality assessment. More recently, the researcher has focused her attention on sustainable mobility issues and eco-tourism. She has authored or co-authored more than 30 scientific publications, including original articles in peer-reviewed journals, books and book chapters, special articles and full proceeding papers, as well as +100 conference abstracts. Additionally, Marina had participated in 10 R&D national and international projects in diverse topics, such as neutron activation analysis, nuclear techniques, aerosol characterization, air quality assessment, human exposure to air pollutants, low carbon economy and sustainable mobility. Moreover, all of these collaborations potentiated the possibility to participate in European networks and platforms, such as FAIRMODE, Cost Actions SHELD-ON and COLOSSAL. All these activities and collaborations have enabled the improvement of the relations between a wide range of disciplines and stakeholders, from researchers to business stakeholders and between teachers and society actors. This reinforces the importance of performing cutting-edge R&D activities with relevance and application in real world. This link with the society has been intensified since Marina was the Communication Manager of two European projects: REMEDIO and ClimACT."
