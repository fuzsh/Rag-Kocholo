Keep your momentum going and earn 2 of The Institutes’ most popular designations in as little as 2 years. Learn more about the ARM Path to CPCU.\n\nYou can select a testing window when you purchase your exam and take it any time during that window. ARM virtual exams are timed and you will have 65 minutes to complete 50 questions.\n\nIn addition to using other exam prep materials included in your course, we recommend taking the simulated exam before you take your credentialing exam. It mimics the exam structure and level of questions you’ll find on the actual exam, and students who take it pass their exams at higher rates than students who don’t."
