        "meta_description": "Abstract. Snow avalanches are recurring natural hazards that affect the population and infrastructure in mountainous regions, such as in the recent avalanche winters of 2018 and 2019, when considerable damage was caused by avalanches throughout the Alps. Hazard decision makers need detailed information on the spatial distribution of avalanche hazards and risks to prioritize and apply appropriate adaptation strategies and mitigation measures and thus minimize impacts. Here, we present a novel risk assessment approach for assessing the spatial distribution of avalanche risk by combining large-scale hazard mapping with a state-of-the-art risk assessment tool, where risk is understood as the product of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Hazard disposition is modeled using the large-scale hazard indication mapping method RAMMS::LSHIM (Rapid Mass Movement Simulation::Large-Scale Hazard Indication Mapping), and risks are assessed using the probabilistic Python-based risk assessment platform CLIMADA, developed at ETH ZÃ¼rich. Avalanche hazard mapping for scenarios with a 30-, 100- and 300-year return period is based on a high-resolution terrain model, 3âd snow depth increase, automatically determined potential release areas and protection forest data. Avalanche hazard for 40â000 individual snow avalanches is expressed as avalanche intensity, measured as pressure. Exposure is represented by a detailed building layer indicating the spatial distribution of monetary assets. The vulnerability of buildings is defined by damage functions based on the software EconoMe, which is in operational use in Switzerland. The outputs of the hazard, exposure and vulnerability analyses are combined to quantify the risk in spatially explicit risk maps. The risk considers the probability and intensity of snow avalanche occurrence, as well as the concentration of vulnerable, exposed buildings. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed to capture inherent variability in the input parameters. This new risk assessment approach allows us to quantify avalanche risk over large areas and results in maps displaying the spatial distribution of risk at specific locations. Large-scale risk maps can assist decision makers in identifying areas where avalanche hazard mitigation and/or adaption is needed.",

        "text": "In densely populated mountainous landscapes with continuous socio-economic growth and changing climate conditions, society is increasingly exposed to natural hazards (Zgheib et al.,Â 2020). In mountainous regions such as the Alps, avalanches are a significant natural hazard in winter, causing damage to buildings and infrastructure. In the past 20Â years, Alpine countries such as Switzerland have experienced multiple catastrophic avalanche situations. The winter of 2017/18 was the first since the catastrophic avalanche winter in 1999 (Wiesinger and Adams,Â 2007), during which the highest avalanche danger, level 5, was forecasted for wide areas across the Swiss Alps. In January 2018, 2.5 to 5âm of snow fell at higher altitudes within 25âd. Numerous avalanches in the categories âlargeâ and âvery largeâ were counted (Zweifel et al.,Â 2019). In total, over 380 avalanches damaged buildings, traffic routes, or important infrastructure in Switzerland (BrÃ¼ndl et al.,Â 2019), making it the most severe avalanche winter in recent years. This was also the case in Austria and Germany (MeteoSchweiz,Â 2019; Pancevski,Â 2019; ZAMG,Â 2020; Trachsel et al.,Â 2020). In the following winter of 2018/19, exceptional snowfalls again occurred, causing substantial damages throughout Switzerland (Trachsel et al.,Â 2020). Such events show that even in highly developed, well-adapted countries, society is still vulnerable to avalanches. Strategies, methods and risk assessments to counteract this threat are well developed in most areas in the Alps, but they need to be continuously developed to strengthen and improve the resilience of the population and its assets (Zgheib et al.,Â 2020).\n\nTo cope with natural hazards threatening exposed assets, various organizations have introduced the concept of risk to the field of natural hazards. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) for instance defines risk as the likelihood of the disturbance of the normal functionality of a society due to a hazardous physical event under vulnerable social conditions (vulnerability) with economic, material, or environmental consequences (IPCC,Â 2014), see also Fig.Â 1. According to this definition, the risk concept can also be applied to events with harmful consequences to the environment and environmental systems. Considering the impacts of natural hazards on the environment is also important to us. However, since damage to human life and man-made objects is of greater direct importance to society and decision makers, this concept is generally applied to infrastructure and buildings, as it is in this study.\n\nDownload\n\nThe concept of risk was introduced in Switzerland in the late 1990s to support decision makers with dealing with natural hazards (Heinimann et al.,Â 1998; Borter,Â 1999; BrÃ¼ndl et al.,Â 2009). The risk concept also became the central element of the strategy for natural hazards of the National Platform Natural Hazards (PLANAT) in Switzerland (PLANAT,Â 2009, 2018). Overviews of natural hazard risks and vulnerabilities at different spatial scales were generated by various organizations in the last decade (MATRIX Consortium,Â 2013; van Westen and Greiving,Â 2017; Fuchs et al.,Â 2019; FOEN,Â 2020). These studies vary from vulnerability surveys (Fuchs et al.,Â 2015) to multi-risk and resilience approaches (Kappes et al.,Â 2012; Komendantova et al.,Â 2016). Projects such as RoadRisk, carried out by the Swiss Federal Roads Office, or the National Risk Overview, initiated by the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN,Â 2020), were created laboriously. Such projects underline the need for large-scale risk surveys.\n\nA method to assess avalanche risk at a regional or national scale is currently lacking, with a state-of-the-art hazard mapping tool to allow decision makers to identify hotspots of avalanche risk. The risk maps produced by this approach would show detailed short-term assessments to facilitate risk management decisions.\n\nThe goal of this study is to present a framework for assessing avalanche risk over widespread areas, as shown in Fig.Â 1. The method was applied in a regional case study in central Switzerland but can be deployed anywhere worldwide. Such a framework can also be useful to identify and visualize changes of the components of risk, such as hazard, exposure and vulnerability, over time and space. In this paper, we focus on the presentation of the framework for the current risk situation, which will serve as a baseline for modeling expected climate and socio-economic-induced changes of risk in future.\n\nNew strategies and tools to systematically identify risk and respond to threats in exposed areas are of increasing importance, especially in the context of climate change and population growth (IPCC,Â 2012). Changes in the climate system and their influence on local weather phenomena do not only affect us now (CH2018,Â 2018) but also will likely lead to an increase of the frequency and magnitude of natural hazards in the years to come (IPCC,Â 2014). In particular, various studies indicate that changes in the climate system, such as rising temperatures and an increase of extreme precipitation events, will likely influence gravity-driven hazards (Mani and Caduff,Â 2012; Ballesteros-CÃ¡novas et al.,Â 2018), including snow avalanches.\n\n3.1âRisk maps\n\nWith CLIMADA and all the risk components described above, we are able to express risk measures such as the expected annual impact and the average annual impact for all objects in the case study region, taking into account different synthetic hazard scenarios. FigureÂ 8aâd show how different hazard scenarios affect single objects located in the hazardous area. FigureÂ 8a depicts the risk pattern of the entire study area. Further risk overviews for the 30-, 100- and 300-year return period scenarios can be found in the Appendix,Â Sect.Â A, Fig.Â A2. FigureÂ 8b shows a detail of the risk map of the GÃ¶schenen area with a 30-year return period scenario and the Rientalbach avalanche path in order to compare it with the 100-year return period in panel c and the 300-year return period scenario in panel d. The colored dots represent the expected annual impact corresponding to a 30-year return period. As shown in TableÂ 4, the aggregated average annual impact ranges from CHFâ3.2 million to 5.02 million per year, depending on the scenario. In the aggregated scenario, it reaches up to CHFâ9.73 million. In the detail panels of Fig.Â 8bâd, it can be seen that with increasing return period the area affected by avalanches gets larger, and the number of objects at risk increases. Nevertheless, the objects in the hazard zone show lower risks in the higher return periods. This clearly shows the influence of return period on risk. The less likely an event is to occur, the lower the associated risks for the individual object. The aspect of more exposed objects at risk is expressed by the aggregated average annual impact over the entire project area.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nAs depicted in the risk maps in Figs.Â 8a andÂ A2 of the Appendix, it is evident that in all scenarios the most densely populated areas (see Fig.Â 6) in the main valleys do not represent the greatest risk accumulations. Hotspots are located on the slopes of the main Reuss Valley near Wassen, further north in Gurtnellen and in the side valleys of Wassen near Meien. In these areas, mountainous terrain with a high number of avalanche flow paths and a denser number of buildings overlaps. There, the exposed objects are mostly agricultural buildings. According to our method, the value of these buildings depend on their volume. Agricultural buildings can be large in volume but also very vulnerable to destruction by avalanches (see Fig.Â 7) due to their construction type. This leads to high impacts at these locations, as shown in Fig.Â 8. However, there are also a few multi-residential buildings in the endangered areas. If these buildings are at high risk, they appear on the map as dark dots. The largest accumulations of buildings at risk are found on the southeast to southwest facing slopes east of Altdorf. The identification of such hotspots can play a crucial role in a decision making process, as discussed in Sect.Â 5.\n\nDownload\n\n3.2âImpacts, uncertainty ranges and sensitivity analyses\n\nFor the first event set with a 30-year return period (Fig.Â 9 in blue), the maximum count of sample histogram bars plotted between CHFâ3.4 million and 5.6 million. This illustrates that the annual impact severity for a hazard with a frequency of 1/30 is likely to lie in this range. The non-aggregated average annual impact values generally range from CHFâ2.0 million to 9.0 million. This implies a wide dispersion of risk, yet reflects the broad distribution of the exposed monetary values in the hazard area. Building values range from less than CHFâ1000 to maximum building values of CHFâ78 million. The sample size was 8000 generated samples for each parameter, and the impact was calculated for each of these samples. The histogram is not normally distributed, it shows a right-skewed distribution with an average impact value of CHFâ4.87 million and with an SD of CHFâ1.34 million. Taking into account all uncertainty ranges discussed above, it is very likely that the annual risk for a 30-year return period scenario across the entire region will be in the range CHFâ3.4 million to 5.6Â million per year.\n\nDownload\n\nThe situation is slightly different for the scenario with a 100-year return period (Fig.Â 9 in orange): despite higher avalanche impact pressures, the risk is lower, with a lower variance. Taking into account the uncertainties, the possible annual impact in the project area is between CHFâ2.9 million and 5.4 million. The distribution extends almost over the same range as the 30-year return period scenario (Fig.Â 9 âComparisonâ), but the 30-year scenario shows a sightly higher sample count in a higher impact range. The average annual impact across all values inside the chosen uncertainty range for the 100-year return period scenario is CHFâ4.34 million, with an SD of CHFâ1.11 million. The histogram for the 100-year return period also shows a right-skewed distribution, and compared to the 30-year return period distribution it is almost equally distributed.\n\nLooking at the distribution of the 300-year return period scenario, and in the comparison (Fig.Â 9 in green), we see that the average value of the annual impact is CHFâ2.99 million, with an SD of CHFâ0.73 million; the risk is significantly lower than in the 30-year return period scenario and also lower than in the 100-year return period scenario. The highest sample count is in a variability range of CHFâ2.5 million and 3.6 million. The total damage caused by avalanches in the 30-year return period scenario would be approx. CHFâ150.8 million; for the 100-year return period scenario, CHFâ458.6 million; and approximately CHFâ947.1 million for the 300-year return period scenario.\n\nIn the combined scenario in Fig.Â 10, we see a significantly higher impact range of CHFâ7.0 million to 11.5 million, with an average value of CHFâ9.29 million and an SD of CHFâ2.41 million. This shows the high influence of the return period in the calculation of the risk. The risk of a 30-year return period scenario is therefore significantly greater than that of a 300-year scenario.\n\nDownload\n\n3.3âDamage-frequency curve\n\nThe damage-frequency curves show the calculated impacts and their uncertainty distributions for all considered scenarios in relation to the return period. The average damage for the three considered scenarios shown in the risk overviews is depicted in Fig.Â 11a. To incorporate a comparison of the designated return period scenarios with the results of the uncertainty analysis, we calculated the 95th and 5th percentile of all damages of the three scenarios of the uncertainty analysis. Thus, for the confidence interval calculation, 8000 values were available from the uncertainty analyses for each of the three return periods (30, 100, 300Â year). As shown in TableÂ 4 and Fig.Â 11 the damage for a frequent (30-year return period) scenario is about CHFâ150.8 million, with a variation from CHFâ151â216 million (5thâ95th percentile). In the 100-year return period scenario the average damage is CHFâ458.6 million, with a variation (5thâ95th percentile) of about CHFâ262â625 million. The higher the scenario, the more objects are affected and the larger are the uncertainties expressed in monetary terms. The 300-year scenario shows an average damage of CHFâ947.1 million, with a large uncertainty range from CHFâ548 millionâ1.27 billion (5thâ95th percentile). The variability of the calculated damages stemming from uncertainty can be seen in Fig.Â 11a andÂ b. The median value (black line in the boxplots), calculated from all values of the uncertainty margin of the scenarios, is compared with the average damage of the three designated scenarios (see TableÂ 4; displayed as a black square in Fig.Â 11b). FigureÂ 11b shows that the average damage values of the three single scenarios are close to the median values of the box plots calculated from all values including the uncertainty margin. It demonstrates that the original calculations for the single damage values (from the three scenarios) are of good quality. Whether the interpolated damages from the scenarios that were not calculated (e.g., 0â30, 30â100 or 100â300Â year) in this study are in a linear relation to the calculated damage is a rough assumption. Nevertheless, this curve can be used to infer approximate dimensions of the damage to be expected in other return periods, taking into account various uncertainties.\n\nDownload\n\nInput parameter sensitivity analysis\n\nThe first-order sensitivity index S1 identifies which parameter impacts the aggregated average annual impact most. FigureÂ 12aâc show that the mean damage degree plays the most important role in this model for all scenarios. For the scenario with a return period of 30Â years and the scenario with a return period of 100Â years, the exposure and the hazard intensity seem to be almost equal. In the extreme scenario with a 300-year return period, substantially more objects are affected (see Fig.Â 8), and the exposure plays a slightly more important role here. The sensitivity index of the hazard intensity in the 30- and 100-year return period scenarios (Fig.Â 12a andÂ b) is slightly higher than the S1 of the hazard intensity in the 300-year return period scenario in Fig.Â 12c. It is thus scenario-dependent whether the hazard intensity or the exposure have more influence. However, in all scenarios the mean damage degree defined by the impact functions is the most relevant parameter. For the combined hazard scenario (Fig.Â 12d) it is similar to the 300-year return period scenario. Both the exposure and the hazard intensity have almost the same high sensitivity index, but again the mean damage degree is more decisive.\n\nDownload\n\nAccastello, C., Poratelli, F., Renner, K., Cocuccioni, S., DâAmboise, C.
