        "text": "Risk management is a process that allows your organization to identify, assess, and prioritize risk to their objectives. In this case, the risk is specifically your organization’s accessible Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) portfolio. Risk management processes help decision makers understand and evaluate risk factors and assess the impact of those risks, if realized, in order to inform decision making and develop ways to minimize risk.\n\nA risk model turns your risk management strategy into an implementable model to measure the degree in which inaccessible ICT will negatively impact your agency. When agencies fail to maintain an accessible ICT portfolio, they are exposed to civil rights and other legal challenges, financial liability, increased remediation or rework, and waste, as well as challenges with recruiting and maintaining a skilled workforce.\n\nRisk models are used across multiple business functions and include: acquisition and procurement, development, testing, remediation, deployment, and maintenance and operation.\n\nKey benefits of implementing a risk model include:\n\nEnsuring your agency is meeting their legal obligations to accessibility rules and regulations.\n\nUniformly assessing ICT products for risk within specific business streams, catching high risk ICT and issues early.\n\nAiding in the inclusivity of your agency’s ICT portfolio.\n\nWhile helpful, a risk model also poses several challenges, including:\n\nThe variance of testing methodologies for accessibility conformance and the overall quality of testing may depend on the qualifications of the accessibility tester, therefore establishing consistent and repeatable methodologies and metrics is important.\n\nImplementing an effective risk model requires detailed collaboration and participation by numerous stakeholders. Without this stakeholder support, implementation in various business streams may be challenging.\n\nRegular monitoring and the adoption of new risk factors and mitigation strategies may be necessary to address changes in technology, accessibility standards, and testing methodologies.\n\nMonitoring, feedback loops, and continuous improvement are necessary for the successful implementation of a risk model.\n\nRisk models provide a standard methodology for gauging the risk of inaccessible ICT and inform your agency’s decision-making.\n\nThe FCC has developed a working draft for determining 508 risk levels and developing a risk model, along with a complimentary workbook to calculate risk. The adoption and release of the risk model and workbook, while not yet implemented, is in FCC’s overall program timeline for Acquisitions. Based on FCC’s and other federal agency work, we recommend your agency’s risk model include the items below.\n\nIdentification of Risks\n\nConduct an accessibility audit of your ICT to identify potential accessibility issues that may impact risk of ICT use (e.g., number of defects, impact of defects on users, user base, etc.) Solicit feedback from users, accessibility subject matter experts (SME), and other stakeholders to help identify additional risk areas.\n\nCategorization of Risks\n\nCategorize identified accessibility risks based on severity and potential impact to your users. Numerous factors can influence risk therefore multiple variables should be considered when developing your model. One suggested method is to categorize variables into 5 overarching risk factors:\n\nScope of ICT use: Assess your user base for the ICT and type of ICT being assessed.\n\nImpact of ICT defects: Assess if defects are global in nature or apply to a critical function or feature of the ICT.\n\nICT product history: Assess the scope of the ICT update, sufficiency of 508 language in the contract for ICT, and scope of known pre-existing accessibility issues.\n\nICT product vendor/developer accessibility expertise: Assess accessibility subject matter expertise of your vendor or developer team and history of remediation.\n\nRisk Mitigations: Assess mitigating risk factors such as a robust accommodation or alternate means plan and quick remediation timeframe.\n\nDivide your risks into high, medium, and low categories. Within the factors above, additional measures should be added that will help evaluate specific risk levels and either increase or decrease your risk.\n\nHigh: Inaccessible content that significantly hampers usability or denies access to critical features.\n\nMedium: Inaccessible content that limits access to non-critical features.\n\nLow: Inaccessible content that has minimal impact on usability or affects non-essential features.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nAssess each identified risk based on the likelihood of occurrence and potential consequences within your agency. As part of the consequence factor, consider the size of your impacted user base and legal implications of non-compliance to your agency.\n\nRisk Scoring\n\nAssign numerical scores to each risk based on your risk assessment. Use a scoring system that takes into account both the likelihood and impact, or consequence, of the risk.\n\nSelect each risk factor that applies to your ICT to calculate an overall score. Categories may have numerous risk factors that apply.\n\nBelow is an example of risk scoring with the score in parenthesis next to each factor. The scores are based on information from risk models used within federal agencies, including the FCC. Your agency should customize your risk model to meet your agency’s needs, taking into consideration agency-specific factors such as specific standards, ICT portfolio, and user base. You should regularly review and update your risk model to address emerging risks and ensure ongoing effectiveness in managing accessibility risks.\n\nScope of ICT use\n\nPublic Users (High +5)\n\nMandatory Use (High +5)\n\nKnown users with disabilities (High +5)\n\nPlatform (High +5)\n\n50% or more of employees use (High +4)\n\nBetween 15%-49% of employees use (Medium +3)\n\nAuthoring tool (Medium +3)\n\nLess than 14% of employees use (Low +1)\n\nNo mandatory use (Low +1)\n\nImpacts of ICT defects\n\nDefect impact 3 or more disability groups (High +5)\n\nDefects relate to critical features (High +5)\n\nGlobal issue (High +4)\n\nDefects do not relate to critical features (Medium +3)\n\nDefects impact two or less disability groups (Medium +3)\n\nIssues but not global issues (Low +1)\n\nICT product history\n\nICT product has large number of pre-existing accessibility defects (High +5)\n\nNo Section 508 language included in contract (High +5)\n\nNew ICT product (High +4)\n\nMajor update to previously approved ICT product (High +4)\n\nReleases are large in scope (High +4)\n\nICT product has medium number of pre-existing accessibility defects (Medium +3)\n\nModerate update to previously approved ICT product (Medium +2)\n\nReleases are medium in scope and frequent (Medium +2)\n\nGeneral Section 508 language included in contract (Medium +2)\n\nMinor update to previously approved ICT product (Low +1)\n\nReleases are small in scope and frequent (Low +1)\n\nICT product has few to no pre-existing accessibility defects (Low 0)\n\nApplicable Section 508 language included in contract (Low -1)\n\nICT product vendor/developer accessibility expertise\n\nICT product owner has no history of remediation or reputation for deficient history of remediation (High +5)\n\nProduct team (managers, developers, testers) has no training in accessibility or accessibility expertise unknown (High +4)\n\nICT product owner has reputation for average history of remediation (Medium +2)\n\nICT product owner has reputation for excellent history of remediation (Low 0)\n\nProduct team (managers, developers, testers) has in-depth training in accessibility (Low -1)\n\nRisk mitigations\n\nRemediation of defects completed in more than 12 months (High +5)\n\nNo Accommodation plan and/or alternate means plans (High +5)\n\nNo sufficient market research to support ICT selection (High +5)\n\nRemediation of defects completed in more than 6 months (High +4)\n\nRemediation of defects completed in 2-6 months (Medium +2)\n\nPartial Accommodation plan and/or alternate means plan addresses all major defects (only minor issues unaddressed) (Medium +1)\n\nRemediation of defects completed in less than 2 months (Low 0)\n\nMarket research supports ICT selection (Acquisitions) (Low -1)\n\nAccommodation plan and/or alternate means plan addresses all defects (Low -1)\n\nYour agency may choose to take the risk scoring a step further to decide a total score for the level of risk. Your agency should determine the risk score that best fits the risk level. For example:\n\nTable 1. Risk Scoring Risk Level Total Score High Risk 25+ Medium Risk 15-24 Low Risk 0-14\n\nAdditionally, your agency may generate a risk workbook to perform simple calculations based on risk factor selections to easily determine risk.\n\nPrioritization of Risk\n\nPrioritize ICT based on their risk scores, addressing high-scoring ICT (and thus most risky) first.\n\nFor example, for high risk acquisitions, prioritize having an accessibility SME as part of the acquisitions process. For high risk ICT development projects, prioritize accessibility SME(s) resourcing as part of or working closely with the development team. Furthermore, tackle higher risk factors first. For example, prioritize remediating defects that relate to critical features and functions, thus ensuring efforts are focused on addressing the most critical accessibility issues.\n\nMitigation Strategies\n\nDevelop and document mitigation strategies for each of your identified risks and specify the actions required to address and reduce the impact of the risk, including any escalation processes. This will likely result in a multifaceted approach and involve multiple business streams and stakeholders at the same time.\n\nFor example:\n\nDevelopment and implementation of [strong accessibility policies and guidelines][1] ensure accessibility throughout the business lifecycle, from acquisitions to deployment.\n\nIncorporating accessibility into program management processes will ensure it stays top of mind.\n\nMandatory and public use of ICT products will always be high risk; consider strategic guidance for acquisitions professionals and development teams to ensure accessibility is a priority for these ICT products.\n\nImplementation of accessibility best practices during ICT design and development will help ensure an accessible product with little to no defects prior to deployment.\n\nAssignment of Roles and Responsibilities\n\nAssign clear roles and responsibilities to individuals or teams to implement your mitigation strategies. Ensure there is accountability for addressing accessibility and accessibility risks.\n\nTraining and Awareness\n\nEducate stakeholders on the importance of accessibility and your agency’s risk management approach. Raise awareness on roles and responsibilities and incorporate applicable accessibility training into specific roles within your agency. Offer accessibility training to acquisitions professionals, designers, developers, content creators, and testers. Education may not be a one-time training and will be more effective if it is ongoing. Solicit buy-in from all stakeholders to ensure your risk model is effectively implemented and keep stakeholders informed about progress and improvements in accessibility.\n\nMonitoring and Tracking\n\nImplement a system to monitor the progress of your risk mitigation efforts and track the completion and overall success of your mitigation actions. Periodically revisit your risk factors and risk scoring to determine if new factors should be identified or if modifications to risk scoring is appropriate. Metrics will help inform improvements to your risk model.\n\nRegularly review your risk model and update it as needed. Consider changes in operational and business need, accessibility guidelines and best practices, regulations, and technology when updating the model.\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\nFoster a culture of continuous improvement in accessibility efforts and risk mitigation by encouraging ongoing assessment and enhancement of ICT accessibility.\n\nDocumentation\n\nMaintain comprehensive documentation of your risk model, risk assessments, mitigation strategies, and progress tracking and track any changes or updates made to your risk model.\n\nIntegration with overarching agency risk management\n\nConsider aligning your accessibility risk management with your agency’s broader risk management processes by incorporating accessibility risk considerations in overarching agency policies and collaborating with your agency’s risk management team.\n\nAdditional risk resources:\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology’s Risk Management Framework (RMF)\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security’s Risk Management Fundamentals\n\nDepartment of the Interior’s Playbook: Enterprise Risk Management for the U.S. Federal Government"
