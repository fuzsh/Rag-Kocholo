        "text": "CRI’s Cloud Profile is an extension of the CRI Profile developed through collaboration with the Cloud Service Providers themselves. It provides actionable cloud security guidance for firms looking to implement or strengthen existing cloud technologies and operations.\n\nThe new-and-improved Cloud Profile v2.0 has been updated to reflect NIST CSF v2.0 and Profile v2.0, include a shared responsibility checklist and implementation tool, and a guidebook with examples of effective evidence. These documents were developed with the assistance of the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC), the Cloud Security Alliance, key partners from the UK and EU, and CSPs."
