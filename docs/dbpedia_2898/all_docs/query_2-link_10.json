        "text": "In conjunction with a thorough pretrial services investigation, the PTRA helps officers make well-informed decisions when making release or detention recommendations to the court. Officers’ investigations and recommendations represent critical components in the criminal justice process to reasonably ensure the future appearance of defendants in court, while ensuring the safety of the community.\n\nThe United States probation and pretrial services system embraces evidence-based practices (EBP), which employ the best available scientific data to influence release and detention decisions. A key element of the evidence-­based approach is the use of risk assessment instruments to achieve maximum, measurable reductions in pretrial failure rates.\n\nUsing the PTRA in combination with their professional judgement, officers can make informed decisions about which people are suitable for release recommendations and help inform possible supervision strategies.\n\nThe PTRA gives officers an accurate, evidence-based assessment of:\n\nA person’s failing to appear.\n\nHis or her revocation or new criminal activity.\n\nWhether the person should be recommended for release or detention.\n\nOn this page, you will find links to important documents that provide more information about the PTRA.\n\nResearch Articles from Federal Probation Journal\n\nFederal Probation Journal is published each June, September, and December by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts and presents current thought, research, and practices in corrections, community supervision, and criminal justice.\n\nRevalidating the Federal Pretrial Risk Assessment Instrument (PTRA): A Research Summary (September, 2018)\n\nAre Pretrial Services Officers Reliable in Rating Pretrial Risk Assessment Tools (September, 2018)\n\nFederal Pretrial Release and Detention Reduction Outreach Program (DROP) (September, 2018)\n\nImplementing Risk Assessment in the Federal Pretrial Services System (September, 2011)\n\nThe Re-validation of the Federal Pretrial Services Risk Assessment (PTRA) (September, 2012)\n\nThe Development of an Actuarial Risk Assessment Instrument for U.S. Pretrial Services (September, 2009)\n\nPretrial Risk Assessment in the Federal Court (September, 2009)\n\nEvidence-Based Practices in Federal Pretrial Services (September, 2008)\n\nRelated Research\n\nThis article is from publications not a part of the federal Judiciary and may require an account to access:"
