        "text": "Montréal is an ancient cosmopolitan city, with a history that stretches back over the course of five centuries. The nucleus of the community started out as a fortress called Ville-Marie founded by Paul de Chomedey in 1642. Chomedey had hoped that his nascent outpost would function as a missionary site that would proselytize the area’s native Iroquois tribes. Shortly thereafter, King Louis XIV of France granted the settlement a town charter and established Chomedey as its governor. But aspiring frontiersmen migrated to the rustic citadel over the next 70 years, transforming it into a commercial center for the region’s booming colonial fur trade. Its proximity to the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes enabled French fur trappers to present their products over a wide area, even allowing for some to reach with the Mississippi River and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico. Now known as Montréal, the city would soon become one of the most important commercial centers in all of colonial French Canada.\n\nMontréal became a part of the British Empire in 1763, when France ceded control over most of its North American colonial possessions to the United Kingdom after the Seven Years War. An influx of English-speaking settlers then proceeded to flood the region from the Thirteen Colonies and Great Britain itself, introducing a unique—yet very intense—dualistic culture between the British and the native French Canadians. This fascinating dynamic only became more prominent when exiled loyalists from the fledgling United States fled to Canada in the wake of the American Revolution. Many of those Anglo-American settlers specifically migrated toward the shores of Lake Erie to the south, which pushed the region’s culturally French population to congregate more tightly around Montréal and Québec City. By 1791, Montréal and its surrounding environs became the epicenter for a new colony, as such—Lower Canada—while the newer British settlements around modern-day Ontario and Toronto became “Upper Canada.” A fierce rivalry over the regional fur trade ensued, with the Montréal-based North West Company pitted against the British Hudson Bay Company. Montréal, unfortunately, found itself on the losing side of the trade war, which culminated with the two companies merging in 1821.\n\nThe loss of the valuable fur trade did not prevent Montréal from growing, though, as its had also become a preeminent center for commercial transportation by the dawn of the 19th century. Like the fur traders before them, local merchants used the city’s access to the St. Lawrence River to ferry all sorts of goods into the region, from timber to produce. This economic activity only continued to expand, driven by the creation of Lachine Canal and other manmade superstructures. The city also became the central hub for the Canadian Pacific Railway several decades later, which had extended all the way to Vancouver in British Columbia by 1886. Montréal also saw the creation of Canada’s first bank—the Bank of Montreal—which provided for a sound source of capital needed to finance those projects. Much of the early economic expansion occurred due in large part to the entrepreneurial John Molson, who first introduced steamships into Montréal’s market in 1809. The railroad was later joined by a second, the Canadian National Railway, which had originally been founded in nearby Toronto. The presence of the shipping and railroad industries spurred the creation of a self-sufficient manufacturing block in downtown Montréal that became Canada’s most robust by the end of the century.\n\nAfter experiencing a brief decline in economic activity during the Great Depression, Montréal emerged as one of North America’s leading commercial centers by the mid-20th century. The city’s ascent into one of the continent’s most important and culturally affluent communities led to its selection to host the 1967 International and Universal Exposition (known more commonly as “Expo 67”). Montréal was also central to Québec’s Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, in which its population contributed to the modern rise of Québécois patriotism and economic rights. That movement ultimately brought the Parti Québécois to power in the 1970s, which would continuously help to shape Montréal’s political landscape for the next three decades. Perhaps its most enduring legacy were two failed referendums in 1980 and 1995 that sought to render the Provence of Québec into its own nation-state. Nevertheless, Montréal has remained an important part of Canada’s collective cultural identity in the 21st century. Its continued contributions to commerce and art have made it one of the world’s most celebrated communities today.\n\nRecording of “Give Peace a Chance” (1969): While the hotel had hosted all sorts of international luminaries over the years, its most famous tenants were ex-Beatle John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono. The two stayed at the Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth between May 26 and June 2, 1969, in order to hold their now-famous “Bed-Ins for Peace.” Inspired by the sit-ins of the Civil Rights Movement, the “Bed-Ins for Peace” were an experimental form of non-violent protest that denounced the Vietnam War. They had already held a prior “bed-in” at the Hilton Amsterdam in March before coming over to North America. Upon being denied entry into the United States shortly thereafter, they redirected their travel plans to Montréal. Lennon and Ono subsequently moved into Room 1742 at Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth to start the second phase of their novel demonstration. When asked by a reporter as to what the couple hoped to accomplish by staying in bed, Lennon replied: “Just give peace a chance.”\n\nThe sentence, “just give peace a chance,” quickly became a catchphrase for Lennon over the next several days, which inspired him to immortalize it in song. He asked his press officer, Derek Taylor, to find a recording engineer willing to work in Lennon and Ono’s suite. Taylor managed to employ a local studio owner named André Perry, who only brought four microphones and a four-track tape recorder for the project. The recording was subsequently attended by several prominent celebrities, including Petula Clark, Allen Ginsberg, and Dick Gregory. While Lennon provided most of the music, he was joined by Tommy Smothers of the Smothers Brothers on guitar. The song, entitled “Give Peace a Chance,” became an overnight sensation. Quickly becoming the anthem to the anti-Vietnam War movement, it peaked at #14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nOctober Crisis (1970): In October of 1970, members of the radical Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped two prominent politicians: Québec Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte and British diplomat James Cross. The organization had hoped such an act would coax the Canadian government into releasing several of its members from jail. Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau quickly went into action, invoking the first—and only—peacetime use of the War Measures Act. The move sought to limit civil liberties so to rapidly arrest and detain the potential accomplices involved in the plot. While the law’s invocation had some detractors, its use was widely popular throughout Canada and particularly in Québec. The Québecoise government also moved into Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth around the same time to help Prime Minister Trudeau coordinate his response. Among its recommendations to Trudeau’s team was the use of the military as a supplement to the local law enforcement. The Trudeau administration managed to track down all of the ringleaders over the next several months, with the final three militants captured at the nearby town of Saint-Luc that December. Even though the uprising had ultimately ended peacefully, Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte still lost his life while in captivity. Nevertheless, the October Crisis galvanized opposition against the Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ) and the use of violence in general to address Québec’s possible independence.\n\n1958: The Canadian Pacific Railway completed constructed on the International-style Queen Elizabeth Hotel, reaching an agreement with Hilton Hotels to include it within its brand family. The president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, Donald Gordon, decided to name the building after Queen Elizabeth II, who had risen to thrown of the British Commonwealth in 1952. Queen Elizabeth II would go on to visit the hotel on four separate occasions.\n\n1963: The first annual NHL Entry Draft was held at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel. Originally known as the NHL Amateur Draft, the event allowed teams in the National Hockey League to systematically select unsigned youth athletes for their rosters. The NHL Entry Draft was then held nine more times inside the hotel between 1964 and 1979.\n\n1967: Countless international celebrities stayed inside the hotel in order to attend the 1967 International and Universal Exposition. The guest list featured many illustrious names, including French President Charles de Gaulle and Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco.\n\n1969: Ex-Beatle John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, staged a second “Bed-In for Peace” in Room 1742. A response to the ongoing Vietnam War, Lennon had repeatedly stated that he hoped the event would inspire others to “just give peace a chance.” As such, Lennon and Ono commemorated the “bed-in” by recording a song called, “Give Peace a Chance.” It went on to become immensely popular, peaking at #14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.\n\n1970: The Quebecoise government moved into the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in order to help Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to help resolve a militant uprising known as the October Crisis. It had been started by the Front de Libération du Québec, who kidnapped two politicians in a desperate bid to force the Prime Minister to release some of their member from jail.\n\n1988: Canadian Pacific Hotels acquired many of destinations operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Queen Elizabeth Hotel was among those locations that were sold to Canadian Pacific Hotels.\n\n2001: Canadian Pacific Limited, the parent company to Canadian Pacific Hotels, merged the brand with Fairmont Hotels and Resorts following a massive corporate reorganization. Canadian Pacific Limited had come to acquire Fairmont two years prior. The merger resulted in the Queen Elizabeth Hotel getting renamed as the “Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth.”\n\n2017: After 12-months and some $140 million, Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth reopened to great acclaim. The renovations focused on a comprehensive restoration of the building’s wonderful accommodations, all while preserving its beautiful architecture. The hotel then joined Historic Hotels Worldwide around the same time."
