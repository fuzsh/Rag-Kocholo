        "text": "A member of Historic Hotels Worldwide since 2013, the Omni King Edward has been a renowned local landmark in downtown Toronto for more than a century. Local entrepreneur George Gooderham funded its construction at the turn of the 20th century, desiring a way to profit from the growing number of people who had begun to travel to The Queen City on a regular basis. To that end, Gooderham financed the construction of a gorgeous eight-story hotel with the help of his fellow colleagues at the Gooderham and Worts distilling company. For the project, the group selected the site of the former Golden Lion Clothing Store in St. Lawrence, which had gone bankrupt in 1899. The men initially held a contest to see who would win the rights to design the new building. While American architect Henry Ives Cobb initially won the competition, Gooderham and his cohorts would eventually employ local designer E.J. Lennox. Nevertheless, their unique architectural aesthetics introduced in both plans were melded together to form one homogeneous design. What Lennox—and by extension Cobb—had managed to achieve was nothing short of spectacular. When the building finally debuted in 1903, it stood as one of the finest examples of Edwardian-era architecture in all of Toronto.\n\nGooderham and his associates had originally intended to name the business after Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Yet, when the monarch unexpectedly died in 1901, they decided to commemorate the hotel after her heir, King Edward VII. The opening ceremony for the new “King Edward Hotel” was an absolute extravaganza. Hundreds of people attended a magnificent ball that lasted throughout the night. Among the distinguished guests to arrive at the hotel that day was the Governor-General of Canada, Lord Gilbert John Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, and his wife. In essence, the couple represented the will of the British Crown in Canada. As the hotel’s patrons entered the building for the first time that evening, they were completely awestruck by what they saw. Priceless antique furniture filled each space, while some C$75 million dollars of beautiful artwork lined its walls. The most cutting-edge amenities were featured inside every one of the hotel’s original 400 guestrooms, including indoor plumbing and private bathrooms. The King Edward Hotel was also entirely fireproof—a rare achievement for buildings of the age.\n\nThe King Edward Hotel became a sensation seemingly overnight. Luminaries from around the world flocked to the hotel, which made the building one of the most celebrated holiday destinations in all of Canada. Among the most prestigious guests to visit the hotel within this period of time were two future British monarchs—Edward, Prince of Wales, and his brother, Prince George. To meet such demand, Gooderham had to construct a massive, 18-story wing onto the building in 1921. The construction nearly doubled the number of available guestrooms, while also installing several new outstanding facilities. Perhaps the greatest of those spaces was the brilliant Crystal Ballroom. Named after the beautiful chandeliers that hung from its ceiling, the Crystal Ballroom would go on to become the most iconic space within the entire hotel. This amazing space entertained countless galas and soirees over the next several decades, as the hotel’s celebrated band—Luigi Romanelli and the Radio Syncopators—played before packed crowds night after night.\n\nThe King Edward Hotel continued to host all sorts of prominent intellectuals, Hollywood celebrities, and international dignitaries. Some of the world’s most prestigious entertainers graced the halls of the King Edward Hotel, such as Paul Newman, Louis Armstrong, Elvis Presley, Shirley Temple, and Mickey Rooney. Celebrity power couple Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton often frequented the hotel, too, in their attempts to hide from the prying eyes of the paparazzi. John Lennon and Yoko Ono even staged part of their famous “Bed-Ins for Peace” at the hotel in 1969. A few heads of state—such as French President Charles De Gaulle, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt—have stayed at the hotel, as well. Dozens of European nobles have also followed in the footsteps of King Edward VIII and King George VI, too, as the hotel has hosted the likes of King Juan Carlos I of Spain, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Now operated as the “Omni King Edward” by Omni Hotels and Resorts, this fantastic historic destination is still among the most wonderful places to vacation in all of Canada."
