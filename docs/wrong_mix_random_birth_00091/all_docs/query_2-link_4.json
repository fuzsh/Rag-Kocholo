Some Fluxus artists have rejected the system; and some have also debated the idea that Fluxus was ever a “collective,” the term used as the title of a section of Fluxus Codex, which chronicles works produced by artists that Maciunas then assembled, published, and marketed. Abundant black-and-white illustrations, a color portfolio, annotations, references, and bibliography.
