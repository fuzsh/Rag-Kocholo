        "text": "[11:07 AM] I want to talk about goal setting today.January is a convenient excuse to take stock of our singing journey. The New Year invites us to come us with lots of resolutions, but I also find it helpful to hone in a specific avenue I'm on and look closely at what's going on there. So, yes, I have resolutions for exercising, diet, time with family, journaling, etc. but singing is super important to me so I'll spend more time looking at just that part of my goal setting.\n\n[11:10 AM] With artistic endeavors we have a unique relationship with what the journey looks like and how we interact with it. Artistic journeys require continual reflection and continual drive.\n\n[11:10 AM] Artistic journeys are paths that we are on for our entire lives.\n\n[11:11 AM] In a broad sense, we all house a creative self. Our creative self is part of our inner lives. So, it is something we are born with - this ability to be creative - and it is something we take with us up until the moment of death - the ability to create.\n\n[11:12 AM] I mean, that's one reason why being a human is so special and so cool!\n\n[11:13 AM] Your relationship with your own singing is continually evolving and you are continually engaged with that.\n\n[11:25 AM] Starting with some personal intake questions can jump start your goal setting. Try these two questions:\n\n[11:25 AM] 1) What are 3 vocal habits or skills that I acquired in 2020?\n\n[11:27 AM] Some example answers include: I started voice lessons, I practiced vocal exercises most days, I learned how to isolate my head and chest voice, My voice became stronger, I learned to enjoy listening to myself and accept compliments, I found out about straw phonation and I love it!\n\n[11:27 AM] Think specific, think small, think accomplishment.\n\n[11:28 AM] 2) What are 3 musical achievements I created/manifested in 2020?\n\n[11:30 AM] Again, it's good to start by acknowledging your accomplishments. If we only look at goal setting for the future we are working out of a deficit mentality - i.e. what we haven't done yet. I find that we come to our best goal setting when we start with a hefty pat on our backs. Congratulate yourself with these 2 questions!\n\n[11:30 AM] Your answers to #2 may overlap with #1. That's ok!\n\n[11:32 AM] Some example answers include: I recorded an album, I performed live for the first time, I played at 10 open mic events, I started learning piano, I wrote a song, I jammed with friends, I learned the harmony part to a favorite song, I invested in a new microphone.\n\n[11:32 AM] Think actions taken, think big and small, think markable.\n\n[11:37 AM] Hopefully you've had a moment to brainstorm some answers to these 2 introductory questions.\n\n[11:38 AM] Continue to reflect and jot down answers. I suggested listing 3 items for each, but if you've got a lot, jot them ALL down. Don't limit your self-acknowledgment! Anything and everything you did for your singing journey in 2020 is worth noting!\n\n/@H/ Sadly, I think I lost a lot of momentum from March on. I find that I am unsure about where my comfortable range, my 'natural' voice if you will. I have restarted doing vocal exercises and that feels good. I just feel like I'm lost touch with what my voice is, what my voice sounds like…\n\n[11:40 AM] @H that's real! Maybe for you it's just acknowledging that you sang at all in the face of surreal circumstances. The fact that you have made some notes about where your voice is at tells me that you're still in touch with it and that's huge!\n\n[11:41 AM] Let's go ahead and introduce some questions that pertain to 2021. Cautiously optimistic though we may be as we head into continued societal precarity!\n\n[11:42 AM] Here are 2 questions I suggest for goal setting in the coming year:\n\n[11:42 AM] 1) What vocal habits and skills would I like to tackle in 2021?\n\n[11:42 AM] Start with 3 and expand from there.\n\n[11:46 AM] Some example answers include: Practicing 5 times/week, Learning 2 new songs in February, Recording myself in GarageBand or Soundtrap, Strengthening my head voice, Learning how to do growl in a rock song, Improving my Italian diction, etc.\n\n[11:45 AM] Think actionable, think concrete, think desired outcome.\n\n[11:46 AM] You want these goals to be things you can immediately begin to find resources for. For example, if your goal is to learn a song in Spanish - that is something you can Google or ask friend who is knowledgable.\n\n/@H/ I would like to work on producing clear tones and hitting the notes. That and working on breath maintenance so I do not run out. I need to practice on singing in a planned manner as well, panning enunciation and diction as well as when to breathe, etc. Mostly what I've been doing is too ad hoc, without purpose or planning.\n\n[11:48 AM] @H, These are fantastic goals! Very actionable and concrete!\n\n[11:49 AM] 2) What musical projects or products would I like to achieve in 2021?\n\n[11:52 AM] For question #2 some example answers include: I want to form a band, I want to write original music, I want to prepare a set list for open mic nights, I want to find out how to get gigs, I want to learn guitar, I want to learn how to scat, I want to audition for a musical, I want to do one of Molly's Student Showcases ;), I want to feel confident about my voice, I want to learn the vocal parts for some Emmylou Harris songs, etc.\n\n[11:54 AM] There may be overlap in goal setting questions 1 and 2. That's ok!\n\n[11:55 AM] For #2 think broadly, think boldly, think a year out.\n\n[11:58 AM] The final question to answer is:\n\n[11:58 AM] How can I build a support network to help me achieve my goals?\n\n[11:59 AM] Art, creativity, cannot be done in a vacuum. Even if much art is made in solitude, it's not made in isolation. Even the most reclusive of writers and painters still read, listened, and sought out advice when necessary.\n\n[11:59 AM] Examples of answers for this question include: find a voice teacher, post my practicing to social media for accountability to myself, reach out to friends who have similar goals and start a study group, tell my spouse/partner that I'm going to be practicing, create a space to practice that has all my favorite tools and comforts (cup of tea, nice lighting, tuner, picks, phonation straw, stereo, etc.)\n\n/@H/ I want to write original music, I want to learn to sing while playing guitar, I want to want to do one of Molly's Student Showcases , I want to feel more confident about my voice.\n\n[12:01PM] @H, Great start to your goal setting! Those are all fantastic things to set your path towards! I can’t wait to watch you progress in this new year full of potential! Thanks for tuning in!\n\nEvery year I make a playlist of tunes to finish up the year and tingle the ear drums for the year to come. [Here is last year’s and here is the year before.] I have some very loose parameters for choosing tunes to include in the playlist, which I lovingly call a mixtape in homage to my 90’s adolescence.\n\nSongs released in the previous year to emphasize fresh sounds\n\nLocal musicians and friends\n\nMusicians I saw perform live (sadly, not applicable this year.)\n\nSongs that are off the beaten path\n\nSongs that I was obsessed with\n\nSongs that had some lyrical or sonic significance to the events of the previous year\n\nAnd, for the first time, this year I included songs or artists that were mentioned on my Patreon account. Because I was working on a research paper on computer musical instruments for grad school this past fall, I wrote a LOT about electronic and experimental music. You’ll notice that influence in this year’s mix.\n\nThis year’s playlist was by far the largest I’ve ever made because I had a really difficult time saying no to artists I fell in love with. Or, maybe 2020 was just so intense that I consumed more music than ever before. Either way, I ended up with 37 songs! You can start listening to the playlist, “Happy 2021 Mixtape”, right here.\n\nI recommend you start with the first track and go from there. Although the songs represent a diverse spectrum of styles I made sure to create a flow. Listening to them in order will help you go with the flow :)\n\nIn fact, I conceived of the playlist in three acts.\n\nAct I: Mostly Mellow\n\nAct II: Approximately Aggressive\n\nAct III: Outsiders and Outliers\n\nFollow along with the liner notes I’ve prepared or keep the liner notes open in a tab. I’ve included links to every artist so that you can purchase their work to directly support them. I highly encourage you to get a Bandcamp account if you don’t already have one. Bandcamp pays artists 85% of what you pay. As you probably know, you’d have to stream the artist a million times for them to see the same amount of money. Spotify is only a place to become a fan. Bandcamp is a way to follow through. Please, purchase songs and albums of artists you enjoy.\n\nHappy 2020 Mixtape Liner Notes\n\nACT I: Mostly Mellow Here are some tunes that groove, but never too fast! The emotional content may or may not be mellow perse but the musical flow is chill as fuck.\n\n1. “Patchwork” Laurie Spiegel\n\nfrom the album “The Expanding Universe” (1980), https://unseenworlds.bandcamp.com/album/the-expanding-universe\n\n2. “Take Me to the Sun” ELSZ\n\nas a single (2020), https://elsz.bandcamp.com/track/take-me-to-the-sun Follow them on IG too: @iamelsz\n\n3. “Andromeda Soup Dumpling” Ramakhandra\n\nDenver band! from the album s/t (2020), https://ramakhandra.bandcamp.com/album/ramakhandra\n\n4. “Anutha1” Koko La\n\nfrom the album “$UCH_IZ_LIFE” (2020), https://rarebyrd.bandcamp.com/album/uch-iz-life-lp Koko La is one half of Denver group Rare Byrd$\n\n5. “Mist :: Missed” Mourning [A] BLKstar\n\nfrom the album “The Cycle” (2020), https://mourningablkstar.bandcamp.com/album/the-cycle This band calls themselves a collective and I love that!\n\n6. “Transition East” Angel Bat Dawid\n\nfrom the EP “Transition East” (2020), https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/album/transition-east\n\n7. “Te Queria” Lido Pimienta\n\nfrom the album “Miss Colombia” (2020), https://lidopimienta.bandcamp.com/album/miss-colombia Lido identifies as a Colombian-American.

Just the opening bars of this piece lift me.\n\n13. “Ever New” Beverly Glenn-Copeland\n\nfrom the album “Transmissions: the music of Beverly Glenn-Copeland” (2020), https://beverlyglenn-copeland.bandcamp.com/album/transmissions-the-music-of-beverly-glenn-copeland-2 This album is a retrospective of his long career as a composer. He prefers to go by Glenn and 2020 was set to be the first year, after four decades of making music!, that he would earn a living off his music. Sadly his world tour was canceled. Please buy his album if you like it!\n\nACT II: Approximately Aggressive Hey! It’s the punk set! These tunes are punk adjacent and also straight up punk Sometimes you need to wildly jump up and down, shout, flail, and holler whether it’s about being in love or being fucking pissed off.\n\n14. “Secondary Actor” No Home\n\nfrom the album “Fucking Hell” (2020), https://nohome.bandcamp.com/album/fucking-hell-2\n\n15. “Estalacticas” Juana Molina\n\nfrom the album “ANRMAL (live in México)” (2020), https://juanamolina.bandcamp.com/album/anrmal Recorded live in early March of 2020. It’s eerie hearing crowds cheer at a show for what was probably the last time that year.\n\n16. “Futures” Wendy Eisenberg\n\nfrom the album “Auto” (2020), not on Bandcamp yet. But she released album on BC that isn’t on Spotify - Dehiscense (2020) https://wendyeisenberg.bandcamp.com/album/dehiscence-2020\n\n17. “Farrowing Crate” P22\n\nfrom the album “Human Snake” (2020), https://p22p22.bandcamp.com/album/human-snake\n\n18. “Happy” UV-TV\n\nfrom the album “Happy” (2019), https://uvtv.bandcamp.com/album/happy-lp\n\n19. “Grounds” IDLES\n\nfrom the album “Ultra Mono” (2020), https://idlesband.bandcamp.com/album/ultra-mono\n\n20. “Mode Branleur” Cuir\n\nfrom their Single Demo (2020), https://cuir1.bandcamp.com/album/single-demo-remastered-lp-version-one-extra-track [not on Spotify]\n\n21. “Red Towel” The Beakers\n\nfrom the album “Four Steps Towards a Cultural Revolution” (1980; 2004 KRS repress), https://thebeakers.bandcamp.com/album/four-steps-towards-a-cultural-revolution-klp163 Old Seattle band, they were short lived but very influential. One guess as to why the towel is red :)\n\n22. “Forgive Me, Philip” Brontez Purnell\n\nfrom the EP “White Boy Music” (2020), https://postpresentmedium.bandcamp.com/album/white-boy-music-e-p Purnell was in Gravy Train and The Younger Lovers. Although he’s been making great music for a long time this is his first solo album. It’s well worth reading the liner notes on the Bandcamp page for an excellent explanation for the album’s title. Purnell is a Black man making punk music and using the medium to bend racial frameworks. Just read it yourself!\n\n23. “Hunger For a Way Out” Sweeping Promises\n\nfrom the album “Hunger For a Way Out” (2020), https://sweepingpromises.bandcamp.com/album/hunger-for-a-way-out\n\n24. “I’m In Heaven” Cyclones\n\nfrom the compilation “Strum & Thrum: the American Jangle Underground 1983-1987” (2020), https://strumandthrum.bandcamp.com/album/strum-thrum-the-american-jangle-underground-1983-1987 This compilation is great! I recommend listening to the whole thing.\n\nACT III: Outcasts and Outliers Hey! These songs didn’t fit into the flow for Acts I and II. They’re all outliers. Some of these tunes are totally freakish, made by outcasts, who are often my favorite people in real life.\n\n25. “Isolation” John Lennon\n\nfrom the album “Plastic Ono Band” (1970, remastered 2010), [not on Bandcamp] This song is an obvious nod to 2020. His prescience for the human condition is most aptly demonstrated with the verse, “I don’t expect you to understand/ after you’ve caused so much pain/ but then again you’re not to blame/ you’re just human, a victim of the insane.” There is a fantastic PBS documentary on this great, somewhat forgotten album: https://www.pbs.org/video/john-lennon-plastic-ono-band-oyqxml/\n\n26. “Touch Me” Yoko Ono\n\nfrom the album “Plastic Ono Band” (1970, remastered 2016), https://yokoono.bandcamp.com/album/plastic-ono-band This album was made at the same time and John’s with the same personnel. Imagining John in the backing tracks makes Yoko’s experimentations all the more powerful. I like to believe that they were feeding off each other in this moment - pushing each other’s artistry further and further. Beautiful.\n\n27. “Frontier” Holly Herndon\n\nfrom the album “Proto” (2019), https://hollyherndon.bandcamp.com/album/proto\n\n28. “Pi” Kate Bush\n\nfrom the album “Aerial” (2005), [not on Bandcamp]. Everybody knows that Bush’s ‘86 “Hounds of Love” is amazing. “Aerial” doesn’t get talked about as much but it is solid start to finish.\n\n29. “Taurus” Saint Saviour\n\nfrom the album “Tomorrow Again” (2020), https://saint--saviour.bandcamp.com/album/tomorrow-again\n\n30. “L.I.N.E.” Kelly Lee Owens\n\nfrom the album “Inner Song” (2020), https://kellyleeowens.bandcamp.com/album/inner-song\n\n31. “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” Fiona Apple\n\nfrom the album “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” (2020), [not on Bandcamp]. Apple is a perfect outsider and she speaks to that in this song.\n\n32. “Too Blue” Leyla McCalla (with lyrics from Langston Hughes)\n\nfrom the album “Vari-Colored Songs” (2010; 2020 Smithsonian Folkways reissue), https://leylamccalla.bandcamp.com/album/vari-colored-songs-a-tribute-to-langston-hughes\n\n33. “Red Is” Erica Freas\n\nfrom the album “Young” (2020), https://ericafreas.bandcamp.com/album/young\n\n34. “But There’s Still the Moon” Tasha\n\nfrom the single “But There’s Still the Moon” (2020), https://tashamusic.bandcamp.com/album/but-theres-still-the-moon\n\n35. “Queen of Swords” Mallory Chipman & the Mystics\n\nfrom the album “Aquarian” (2020), https://mallorychipmanandthemystics.bandcamp.com/album/aquarian\n\n36. “Three Single Sounds Taken In (Cannon i, ii, iii, iv)” Daphne Oram\n\nfrom the album “Electronic Sound Patterns” (1962, remastered 2013) [not on Bandcamp]. Oram was extremely important in the early days of computer musical instruments and computer composition. In the original liner notes for this album she wrote, “\"Teachers seeking original material have found this new approach exciting and stimulating in their creative work for music, movement and drama. The Sound patterns are intended for children to enjoy and may lead them into movement of dance-like character, or involve them in imaginative situations. People who are interested in sound production may like to know that these sound patterns were created by Daphne Oram at her Electronic Studio in Kent. By using audio generators, many tape recorders, filters, ring modulators and other electronic devices she built up the tone colours, pitched each of the notes separately, gave them duration and dynamics and finally spliced the notes together to obtain the required rhythms and sequences.\"\n\n37. “Goodbye Year, Goodbye” X\n\nfrom the album “Alphabetland” (2020).\n\n[11:00 AM] Welcome, singers!\n\n[11:02 AM] We'll jump into things and if a question arises type it out\n\n[11:02 AM] Today I'm thinking about the roles that vocal exercises have in my life as a singer\n\n[11:03 AM] Often we think of exercises as a means to an end and that end is usually some version of \"making my voice stronger/louder/more something\"\n\n[11:04 AM] As though the exercises are only a thing that serves our dreams and desires for a future moment\n\n[11:04 AM] And, don't get me wrong, they are that too.\n\n[11:05 AM] But, given that this past week was, well, totally brain exploding and anxiety inducing, I found that my vocal exercises were grounding and ritualistic\n\n[11:06 AM] I was better, overall, about doing vocal exercises than I have been in a month and I think it made the week much easier to manage.\n\n[11:06 AM] So, today, let's do some singing without any expectations or agendas attached. Let's see what happens when we sing along just to be in the present moment of doing it.\n\nI'm going to do some tracks from my website:\n\nExercises — Molly Zackary Music\n\n[11:07 AM] We'll work with the \"Basic Warm-Ups\" folder. \"Bari-tenor\" refers to low voices, or all the baritones and tenors, while \"Sopr-alto\" refers to all the sopranos and altos of the world.\n\n[11:08 AM] Let's start with track #2. I'm going to start out with a lip trill and alternate with an /ooooo/ vowel. Have fun!\n\n[@J] I'm grateful that you told me how to breathe slowly through the nose to fill up my lungs in between.\n\n[11:10 AM] I love how exercises give me an opportunity to pay attention to how my body is moving in that moment. I close my eyes and \"watch\" my breathing while thinking about the cycle of muscles releasing and then activating. It feels good to notice this about my own body.\n\n[11:12 AM] Yeah - paying attention to the pacing is also part of the grounding practice @J\n\n[11:13 AM] Let's look at track #4 together. It's the major triad. Try some different vowels. Think about how your tongue and jaw are moving in coordination and serving you through a wide range of motions.\n\n[11:17 AM] Let's try some intention setting through vocal exercises. Cuz, why not?\n\n[11:17 AM] Track #4 has 5 different pitches so it works really well with any phrase that has 5 syllables. I thought of \"I have happy feet\".\n\n[11:18 AM] If you think of any intention setting phrases that have 5 syllables drop them into the conversation\n\n[11:18 AM] Because sopr-alto voices need to do some serious vowel modification as we go higher I'm only going to sing the words about halfway through the track. I'll stop at about 1 minute.\n\n[@J] I like peach ice cream\n\n[11:18 AM] Lol, I love that @jeanette! b/c who doesn't love all things peach - especially CO peaches!\n\n[@A] I'm not even going to tell you what my five syllables are.\n\n[11:21 AM] lol! you may fill in your intentions as you desire @Audrey :)\n\n[11:21 AM] I started singing \"I am full of love.\"\n\n[11:22 AM] In the vast majority of my singing education vocal exercises have been benign and somewhat removed. For example, in k-12 choir the exercises are something to get over and done with so you can move onto the more important work.\n\n[11:23 AM] But singing is the most personal of all instruments. Our voice is a deep reflection of ourselves and when we sing we are exposing our most intimate selves with the world. It is vulnerable and critical to the human experience.\n\n[11:24 AM] So, when we merge our exercising with our intentions of both sharing our human-ness with the world and also with who we see ourselves, the exercising itself becomes the important work.\n\n[11:24 AM] anyways, i think I'll have my students sing \"I am full of love\" all next week\n\n[11:25 AM] Let's try track 8 - the 5 note walk down. This track starts high and descends as the track progresses. Start with any mouth position that triggers a release muscularly\n\n[11:26 AM] This could be a lip trill, an /ah/ or even a /ya/ as though you are about to yawn.\n\n[@J] I just remembered that I should sing the exercises softly.\n\n[11:27 AM] @J - did I tell you to do that? I don't remember, lol\n\n[@J] I recall you saying that during the Swallow Hill workshop on voice maintenance.\n\n[11:27 AM] @J Generally I like to use the word \"gently\" to coach singers for certain exercises or specific functions. Gently can result in softness or quietness, and sometimes not so much.\n\n[@J] Ah, that was it.\n\n[11:29 AM] For example, I'm a pretty loud singer regardless so if I artificially try to make my voice quiet during an exercise I can actually make more problems for myself. But, thinking about approaching and exercise like track #8 gently I'm thinking more intentionally about not having tension.\n\n[11:30 AM] I'm going to do track #9 next. Usually I like to do this one on an /ah/ but you do you.\n\n[11:34 AM] Sometimes with singing adjectives can make a big difference. It can go back to our theme du jour - that of setting intentionality, being present in the moment, and allowing our bodies to merge with our instruments in a grounding practice.\n\n[11:35 AM] I hadn't thought of it this way until just now but perhaps the act of being intentional is what is most effective in eliminating tension.\n\n[11:35 AM] And tension is the worst thing we can bring to singing.\n\n[11:35 AM] I'm going to share a new link to some exercises. [EDITED: I’ve removed the link for this blog post b/c I recommend you buy the book!]\n\n[11:36 AM]They're from a book by Judy Niemack that's for jazz singers, but seriously, these vocal exercises are my FAVES! I still do them frequently, even after 7 years since I purchased the book. {EDITED: Here’s the link to the book: https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-Blues-Judy-Niemack-Hear/dp/1458412032/ref=asc_df_1458412032/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312057344057&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=17469369624315232206&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028749&hvtargid=pla-459929905621&psc=1]\n\n[@J} I like these! Very jazzy.\n\n[11:39 AM] I like track #2. It's sort of like track #8 on my website but with a little jazzy swing.\n\n[11:39 AM] These exercises invite swaying, tapping, snapping, and any other organic movement your body wants to incorporate.\n\n[11:39 AM] track #6 is really hard but super fun!\n\n[@J] Love it!\n\n[11:40 AM] it doesn't matttter if you fuck it up. go with the flow!\n\n[11:42 AM] My absolute fave is track #7. Give it a try and keep your body moving freely while you do it. Find a rhythm in your limbs. Swing, sway and pulse.\n\n[@J] So pretty!\n\n[11:44 AM] this exercise works well with the lip trill too\n\n[11:46 AM] Going back to memories I have of standard vocal education - I remember that in choir experiences, even those from when I was an adult, the expectation was to stand and deliver, so to speak.\n\n[11:48 AM] Good posture sometimes resulted in a rigid frame. And my attempts to avoid locking my knees sometimes caused me stress and anxiety. I would start thinking \"Am I doing this right?\" while also trying not to draw attention to myself while in the large ensemble.\n\n[11:48 AM] Oftentimes at home I like to put on vocal tracks and sit on my zafu cushion. Here is an example of one: https://www.yogadirect.com/Round-Cotton-Zafu-Meditation-Cushion_p_1120.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAqJn9BRB0EiwAJ1SztT9pUe6o5iu4jg2g0mGAxU1aUT8o_svtUQStPwDA2P8N9IXQ94dB4hoC_vwQAvD_BwE#\n\n[11:49 AM] These pillows open up your hips and provide firm support. That way I can sit and still have an open frame that is conducive to healthy, free singing.\n\n[11:49 AM] They work well on the ground and in a chair.\n\n[11:52 AM] Let's do a couple more exercises. I'm going to go back to the exercises on my website and do track #11 - the sliding perfect 5th. Do a lip trill, sing through a straw or stick to a vowel. While we do this one let's stretch.\n\n[11:52 AM] Any stretch at all! Arms, calves, back, hang upside down, try it all!\n\n[11:54 AM] Again, we are filled with images of vocal exercises being done in rigid positions but that doesn't need to be true in all circumstances. Incorporating movement into our exercises can help free our body and ready it for the day's activities - both singing related and non-singing related.\n\n[11:57 AM] Our goal today is to let go of expectations for the warm-ups. So, when we stretch while singing our sound changes and may or may not be \"pretty\". But, our goal isn't to achieve aesthetic standards of beauty today. Our goal is to be open, free and in the moment with our voice.\n\n[11:58 AM] So, for the last exercise I'm going to return to track #4 on my website. This time I'll sing \"I am alive here.\"\n\n[11:58 AM] This is to affirm myself and the work I've done today\n\n[12:00 PM] I hope you feel affirmed, encouraged, grounded and ready to move through the rest of your day. Feel free to revisit any of these tactics/strategies in your future warm-up sessions!\n\n[12:00 PM] with love, cheers!\n\n[11:16 AM]You can play the example in the exercise as many times as you want before choosing the answer. After listening to it once, try challenging yourself and singing along before selecting your answer.\n\nDepending on the range you may need to sing an octave lower or higher for it to feel comfy.\n\n[11:17 AM]Try singing each pitch on a \"da\" or a \"la\", or you could lip trill the whole thing\n\n[11:20 AM]While you're singing, here are some tips on identification:\n\n[11:21 AM] 1) The main indicator for whether a scale is categorized as major or minor is the 3rd note in the scale. Either the 3rd has that recognizable \"lift\" that makes it major, or the 3rd feels \"depressed\", or lowered, which makes it a type of minor scale.\n\n2) There is another type of minor scale taught in music school and that's the melodic minor. This scale is different going up than it is going down. This scale is not quite as important for singers to memorize. When you're practicing an instrument besides singing, or you're working on composition, then you'll likely need to remember your harmonic scale, but since we're only singing today, we'll skip it.\n\n[11:25 AM]Let's move onto chords. Chord types are SUPER important to singers. All of our sung notes relate in some way to the overall harmony occurring in that moment. Being able to quickly identify common chord types will help you sing more in tune, learn songs more quickly, and will help you to melodically vary a song.\n\n[11:26 AM]Let's start with identifying either the major triad or the minor with this exercise: https://www.musictheory.net/exercises/ear-chord/dyyybyyngneyyyy\n\n[11:26 AM]Triad means there are three notes in the chord: the root, the 3rd and the 5th.\n\n[11:27 AM]In minor chords, just like in the minor scale, the 3rd is flatted, a.k.a. lowered by a half step.\n\n[11:27 AM]See how you do. I'll make it more challenging in a minute.\n\n[11:28 AM]For an extra challenge, see if you can sing all three pitches being played in the chord. Even if you just get one pitch matched you're doing great!\n\nI tend to hear the 5th, the highest pitch, most strongly so sometimes it's easier for me to start high and sing the chord descending.\n\n[11:30 AM]Try it both ways!\n\n[11:31 AM]I just added the diminished chord to the exercise. Hit refresh and you should see it.\n\n[11:32 AM]The diminished chord sounds extra crunchy. It also sounds more like it belongs in a horror movie. Not only is thee 3rd flatted, as in the minor triad, but the 5th is as well. This means we have two stacked minor thirds, or you could think about it as the notes all being much closer together. They're kind of smashed together harmonically and it sounds like that.\n\nDefinitely challenge yourself to find the notes in the diminished chord even if you need to hit the play button 20x!\n\n[A] I really really need to work on this. I can't figure out the notes and I'm having a hard time just telling major from minor.\n\n[11:38 AM] It's hard work! Initially the brain kind of blurs all the sounds together - it's trying to figure out which neural pathway this information belongs in.\n\n[11:38 AM]Go back to singing any note at all that you hear. The brain wants any identifiable information. It'll start to parse it out after some repetition (like maybe over several months).\n\n[11:38 AM]I just added one more chord - the dominant 7th!\n\n[J] I get it if I sing the first note and the last one. okay now to the 7th.\n\n[11:39 AM] Imagine that all chords types have their own unique color and personality. However, both the diminished chord and the dominant 7th both inherently contain tension.\n\n[11:39 AM]We need a little tension in every song in order to keep things interesting and the dominant 7th is the most common type of tension chord you'll encounter.\n\n[11:40 AM]The entire 12-bar blues form is comprised of dominant 7th chords. You may hear it as sounding \"bluesey\" and that would be accurate.\n\n[11:41 AM]It's also commonly used in country, pop and folk music. It's often thrown in right at the end of a verse or a chorus. The dominant 7th chord really, really, really wants to bring us back to our home base major triad.\n\n[11:43 AM]In this exercise the dominant 7th is out of context so it may not sound like a tension chord leading to a resolution, but when you're working on your own songs look and listen for indications that a dominant 7th is happening. There's a 99.9% chance any song you're singing has a dominant 7th chord - that's why it's \"dominant\".\n\n[11:44 AM]A final note on the dominant 7th is that it has 4 chord tones rather than 3. The 7th chord is NOT a triad. The chord tones, in order of scale degrees, are: root, 3rd, 5th and 7th.\n\n[11:44 AM]There are a bunch of different types of 7th chords (and that's why jazz sounds like jazz), but the dominant is dominant for a reason\n\nThese links are permanent. You can access them at any time and work on your ear training.\n\n[11:46 AM] Now I'm going to try out some vocal exercises that are in minor scales. Let's see how they go. It will show the Spotify track I'm playing next to my name in the top right hand corner.\n\n[A] When I was identifying major vs minor chords, I was trying to key off of whether a chord sounded \"sad.\" Sometimes if there were two major chords in a row, I would mis-identify the second as minor. Is it possible for a major chord to sound sad or ominous depending on the major chord it follows? Or is that just in my head?\n\n[11:53 AM] Yes @A ! the major chord has a major third and then minor 3rd stacked above that (the distance between the 3rd and the 5th in the major scale is minor 3rd interval). So lots of people hear that upper minor 3rd in the major triad and it has that \"sad\" sound to them.\n\n[11:54 AM]That's why the \"sad\" vs \"happy\" method is good as an entry point for hearing the difference between major and minor but isn't really reliable.\n\n[11:54 AM]I like to think of the chords as having their own complex personalities that I'm trying to learn and recognize. That helps me some.\n\n[11:56 AM]Here's the link to the first minor scale exercise I did on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/track/1rvhgkeZF0KfThRRYvxzAs?si=jQUN0lvoR22nEV3oKP2ABQ\n\n[11:56 AM]It's a good run of doing the scale up and down while modulating on the keyboard. I recommend.\n\n[11:57 AM]I'm working on a chromatic scale exercise. The chromatic scale is particularly Halloween-ey sounding!\n\nI recommend singing each note on a \"da\" or 'la\" or \"va\"\n\n[12:00 PM]Here's the scale exercise album that has the chromatic exercise as the first one: https://open.spotify.com/track/1rvhgkeZF0KfThRRYvxzAs?si=jQUN0lvoR22nEV3oKP2ABQ\n\n[12:00 PM] That’s it for today. Thanks for hanging with me today! I hope you all have a spooooooooky Halloween\n\n[11:05] This week I want to address practicing and mental health.\n\n[11:06 AM] So, how does your mental health impact your musical practice? And, what kinds of tools help you work through it and get to the practicing?\n\n[11:07 AM] It's on my mind because this past week I've only practiced 3 times (including today). It's actually the non-practicing that clued me in that I wasn't feeling all that well emotionally. When I can't find the motivation to do warm-ups even when the opportunities are there, that's a sign that I'm feeling a little blue.\n\n[11:08 AM] Sometimes, of course, it's the other way around - I know that I'm struggling with life events and/or emotional events and I don't sing as much (or sometimes at all).\n\n[11:10 AM ]It can also sometimes trigger a spiral effect - I'm not practicing as much because of feeling down and then I start beating myself up because I'm not achieving my goals and that makes me feel worse about myself - and on and on.........\n\n[11:11 AM] And when we are already feeling low it's harder to talk ourselves out of false thinking like \"I'm bad because I'm not practicing like I'm supposed to.\" and \"I'm letting myself/my bandmates/my voice teacher/etc. down.\"\n\n[11:12 AM] So, this can be a ferris wheel of emotional space and musical journeying that we can't get off of. We'll get dizzy hanging out here.\n\n[11:13 AM] I think there are a few replacement thoughts that can be a lifeline when we find ourselves spinning repeatedly:\n\n[11:14 AM] 1) It happens to everyone. It happens to me and it happens to every professional musician I know. It's good to remember that you aren't alone in dipping out on your practicing while experiencing emotional ups and downs. This can help us accept what's happening and that's often a critical key to getting off the ferris wheel.\n\n[11:18 AM] 2) Know and trust yourself first and foremost. Whatever practicing you were doing before you can get back into it when your ready. You will never lose what you've established. You've worked hard to build a musical pathway for yourself and the road, with all it's tar and gravel will weather any of life's turbulence.. You can use the onramp anytime, anywhere cuz you've already done the work to make it so.\n\n[11:21 AM] 3) It ain't a competition. Nobody is hiring musicians because they practice x hours y days/week. Yes, preparation is super important, but nobody's keeping track of how often you hit the woodshed. What you need to do in your practice space is determined by what your body and mind need as much as it is determined by what a gig or a band demands. Actually, what you need is more important that what others expect. So, be generous with yourself and what your instrument is asking of you, which is sometimes simply patience.\n\n[11:24 AM] 4) Practice with buddies . I imagine that my singing community is out there right now while I do office hours so it helps motivate me to practice, like, right now! Mark this time in your calendar and practice adjacent to me if it helps keep you motivated. Or, find another singing buddy who can check in with you to see how your practicing is going. Sometimes a text is the nudge we need to move out of that ferris wheel.\n\n[11:25 AM] So, with that, I'm gonna explore some vocal workouts on Spotify. Let's see what's out there!\n\n[11:27 AM] I found an album by Pete Faint. While I'm singing with it you can also play it simultaneously by clicking on my avatar. You'll see the track on Spotify and an option to play it on your end. (you may need to have spotify installed on your device)\n\nHere is the link: https://open.spotify.com/album/63giiARfCErWYolDvvpLKB?si=hGMejz1ZTe2C3wg_-FbCcQ\n\nThe track \"E A Ah Ah\" is challenging and fun\n\n[11:41 AM] Where in the world is spelled \"tyres\"? UK? Australia?\n\n[11:42 AM] Anyways the \"tyres\" exercise is also fun\n\n[11:43 AM] \"chester cheetah chews a chunk of cheap cheddar cheese\"!!!!!! I'm going to have to practice that one\n\n[11:44 AM] these tongue twisters are kicking my butt\n\n[11:47 AM] I don't really know what's going on with \"1,2,3,4,5\" so I skipped it\n\n[11:49 AM] \"1, 121, 12321...\" is an exercise I used to do a lot back in high school choir. They've got it going at a break neck speed so it would be hard to follow if you don't know it well. I don't know why the recorded vocalist drops out so soon - maybe these exercises are intended to be used in a choir setting so you'd have your director singing it? Anyways, I'd recommend skipping it if you don't already know it.\n\n[11:50 AM] \"Bella Signora\" is a great agility exercise. I talked about agility last week. Read the notes I made and then sing this one.\n\n[11:51 AM] Overall I'd recommend this warm-up album.\n\nIt's paced really nicely and I love the articulation exercises (the tongue twisters). I think the vowel choices as compared to range would match an AFAB (assigned female at birth) voice best. AMAB larynxes might need to do some vowel modification.\n\n[11:56 AM] You can comment on the transcript from my office hours after the fact! Chime in about how you relate to the conversation on mental health and practicing. What do you do to work through it? How does it impact your practicing, or not? What tips that I provided resonate with you?\n\n[11:58 AM] Before I sign off on this Saturday Office Hours session I wish everybody a wonderful fall weekend. I wish for Colorado rain/snow/mist/dew/spit/any kind of moisture. I'm heartbroken for our beautiful mountain forests and the people who live there. I hope everyone has a good week and that vocal warm-ups play a positive role. If you don't get around to it - that's a-ok\n\n[12:01 PM] Next Office Hours will be next Saturday at 11am. It will be Halloween so maybe we'll do some Halloween exercises!!!!!\n\nTry singing for smaller durations - 15-20 minutes at a time - and several times through the day. This will keep your muscles from atrophying while also allowing them to vocalize in safe and productive way.\n\n#3: Control what you can in your singing and make peace with new adjustments\n\nFor singers it’s important to keep in mind that environmental factors are outside of your control. If you need to take more frequent breaths during a song don’t beat yourself up over it, just breathe more often. If your head voice has a thin or reedy tone because the vocal folds are inflamed, transpose your song down or sing repertoire that sits lower in your voice. Stressing out over what your voice can’t do during respiratory limitations will only make your symptoms worse, or just lead to you feeling bummed out about singing.\n\nMaking some adjustments to your vocal demands can help you to sing in spite of external challenges. And being able to keep doing the thing you love might just make the regular news stories about air pollution more emotionally bearable.\n\n#4: Prioritize general health and well being\n\nIf you are feeling as though poor air quality is impacting you, trust your gut and begin to address the symptoms immediately. If you have chronic issues don’t hesitate to reach out to your physician before the situation becomes acute.\n\nI am a singer who also has chronic asthma so I know that I’m prone to being affected. I’ve been staying mostly indoors and if I have needed to drive I’ve been using the “max AC” setting because it circulates the air inside through the air filter. I’ve been drinking LOTS of water to keep my system hydrated and to flush the particulates I’ve inhaled out. Sleep, diet and exercise are also important factors in overall health. Do your best to prioritize love and care for your body during this time.\n\n#5: Everything in our bodies is connected, so look out for symptoms that seem unrelated\n\nWhen the visibility around my house started to get really hazy and I woke up to ash covering my car windshield I also started to get itchy all over my body. Red patches appeared on my face and back and the urge to scratch was uncontrollable. About a week after the smoke levels were noticeably high my occipital lymph nodes became so swollen it hurt to turn my head.\n\nI can’t say for sure that these symptoms were a result of the prolonged air pollution but there is significant scientific evidence that air pollution combined with high UV levels (which was the case in Denver last week) can lead to eczema and other skin irritation.\n\nHere is a super detailed scientific study from the NCBI and here is another super geeky report connecting air pollution with skin inflammation. The TL;DR is that when there is a high amount of particulates in the air skin harmful UV rays are converted more rapidly into harmful O3. This is especially true on hot, sunny days which we have had in August. The surface of your skin is irritated by this and the barrier is damaged microscopically. This means that dirt, debris and those particulates can get in. That’s a big problem and leads to inflammation. Additionally your respiratory system, which is taking in those particulates is trying to get them back out and your skin is one of the ways it can eject these. This means you’ll have inflammation both internally and externally. Furthering the compounding stress on one’s body, both studies report that folks who are suffering from air pollution and skin inflammation had significantly lower levels of vitamin E and vitamin C. That would obviously cause even bigger problems if the issue is left unaddressed.\n\nAgain, I don’t know if the air pollution is the cause of my skin problem, but it’s entirely possible. Regardless, we know that respiratory problems are connected to problems in other bodily systems. And, when we don’t feel good, in general, it’s really hard to sing.\n\nI’m feeling much better now, but the lesson here is that our bodies are designed to run as a well-oiled machine. It’s a beautiful thing, this body that we have and even more spectacular that it breathes and sings for us. However, any health event can make it difficult to function in the way we’re used to and environmental factors, like worsening fire seasons and climate change, doubly impact our ability to thrive. As singers our body IS our instrument. Caring for, managing, and monitoring our body is the same thing as taking care of our voice.\n\nAre these tips and resources helpful? Let me know in the comments below.\n\nHappy singing!"
