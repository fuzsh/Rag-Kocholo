First, it rings a firehouse alarm to decades of poor leadership: the fundamental misunderstanding of it, the notion that it belongs only to the few at the top, the confusion between it and management, the weakening of its moral backbone and its foothold in reality, the wobbly wheels that send it careening off course, the retreat from its full fiduciary responsibilities, and especially the brazen abuse of its power and privileges. Second, by distilling a lifetime of experience, observations, and thinking on leadership, it sheds light on one of the most demanding challenges that dedicated, driven people ever undertake. Finally, like a good leader, it blazes a trail of its own — in this case, to argue for a fuller and better leadership ethic for the twenty-first century, grounded in emotional maturity and stewardship. I call it whole leadership, and I believe it can save us from our own worst instincts.\n\nThe book itself had an unlikely beginning on a sunny but brisk March afternoon in San Francisco. Indulging a lifelong passion for reading, I pulled on a hoodie and trekked over to the legendary City Lights Bookstore in North Beach. More than just a purveyor of fine books, City Lights is a cultural landmark, recognized by the U.S. National Register of Historic Places as a storied patron and literary fortress for such avant-garde writers as Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and the bookstore’s co-founder Lawrence Ferlinghetti — all icons of what Kerouac would christen as the Beat Generation — in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThose were years of anxiety and uncertainty. Over the preceding generation the world had coped with a global depression, an axis of fascism, and a second world war. Now the fear of polio, communism, and atomic bombs was palpable. People turned to television, rock ‘n’ roll, and their own growing families to take the edge off, and a new normalcy set in. Into this catnapping plebeian society stepped the countercultural, proto-hippie “beatniks,” who called everything into question. Soon, cultures clashed. Decades of tradition and repression heaved up and gave way. Youthful, headstrong rebellion reared back, gathered itself, and charged ahead, as paradoxical notions of individuality and community, so well-established today, found their footing together, as one. Before long the Beat Generation was transmuting into hippiedom, its flower children abloom in Haight-Ashbury and Greenwich Village and on college campuses across the country.\n\nIn the rear of City Lights a narrow wooden staircase beckoned to me, and upstairs I went. I sank into an old easy chair, its dry crinkled Naugahyde torn and fairly exploding with yellow foam cushioning. A warm beam of buttery sunlight poured through a window and lit up a little dust storm. As the dust resettled, I looked over the jam-packed bookcases. A slender volume on the bottom shelf caught my eye: The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry by Ernest Fenollosa.\n\nPaging through the odd little book, I soon came across an absorbing discussion of the Chinese ideographs for man and word. The written characters appeared first individually and then alongside each other as in “a man standing by his word.” Together the two words forged an altogether new ideograph, the Mandarin word for trust or integrity or loyalty — just as two distinct English terms might combine to form a new and different third word, like crosscurrent or afterthought. The phrase “standing by your word” thus proved to be a cognate: verbal first cousins between languages. This particular cognate reached clear across the Pacific Ocean and across the cultural schism between East and West — so important and so vital is trust to our understanding of ourselves, our society, and the great institutions we establish. Trust is the fulcrum of leadership. People need to believe one another, and they need to trust their leaders. When leaders abuse that trust, as they have been all too often, society loses its cohesion, its identity, its claim on the future.\n\nUntil that afternoon it had never occurred to me to regard beatniks as leaders. Even now it feels counterintuitive. But if leaders are as leaders do, then leaders they most assuredly were. Those writers of the Beat Generation led people to think differently. That is what leaders do. They teach people to see and think differently and to live their lives accordingly. Then, thinking for themselves, people take their new sensibilities to places of their own choosing and design. By preferring loose reins over tight, real leadership thus spawns a wellspring of creativity and growth.\n\nDaring to question the unquestioned, daring even to question the unquestionable, the beatniks of the 1950s proved inspirational to millions of young people. Their ethic evolved into a culture that celebrated a bold unorthodoxy, an insistent freedom, and a beatific spirituality. It truly isn’t much of a stretch to connect beatniks with the likes of Woody Guthrie, Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, a futurist like Buckminster Fuller, Rolling Stone magazine and the Whole Earth Catalogue, the Grateful Dead, Bono, Willie Nelson, Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream, and even Steve Jobs. Nor is it really a stretch to draw a dotted line from beatniks to the popularity of yoga and meditation, to the free forms of jazz and improv, to the legalization of gay marriage and cannabis, to the Vietnam War protests, and eventually to organic social activism for environmentalism, racial equity, and feminism. Even more loosely, you can feel its distant aftershocks in best-selling breakout books like Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and The Inner Game of Tennis, in Phil Jackson’s meditative Lakota-inspired basketball coaching, in creative fields like advertising, in sardonic cartoons like Doonesbury and Calvin and Hobbes, in corporate cultures like Trader Joe’s, and in socially iconoclastic, edgy, or rebellious activities of any sort. Leadership is like that; more than controlling or defining the future, it creates a culture that inspires people and influences their choices for years ahead. Sometimes you don’t notice or appreciate it for years to come, and all the while its second- and third-generation progeny are ricocheting through society in untold and unforeseen ways. Like the branches of a tree carrying water to twigs, its own countless social synapses carry leadership far into the future.\n\nNow as it happened I was in San Francisco for a speaking engagement the next morning. My talk was to focus on purpose, culture, integrity and leadership in large organizations. The hours I whiled away in the City Lights attic became a fateful muse from an earlier generation, looking after me and inspiring my thoughts and emboldening me to say things that so needed to be said.\n\nThe next day I said those very things, and I say them again in this book, with the hope of reaching vastly more people at a time when it is needed all the more. My purpose is to bring attention, insight, excitement, and energy to a subject of considerable misunderstanding and unrealized potential. I want to inform, influence, and inspire public officials, business executives, and agents of change to embrace a larger and nobler philosophy of leadership — an ethic of whole leadership built on a foundation of trust, empathy, dignity, inclusion, decency, service, and community. It is as applicable in business as it is in public affairs, and it fits a good many other spheres of life as well.\n\n* * *\n\nBuilding Better Leaders is intended for anyone with an interest — professional, casual, or academic — in leadership and the big changes it can bring about. In particular I want to reach anyone who aspires to be a better, bolder, and more effective leader — in business, government, advocacy groups and non-profit organizations, schools and churches, and neighborhoods and families. I especially want to reach readers who are concerned about something they believe must be changed and who will step up to lead the change. With any luck, you will learn how to lead more effectively and then go forth to offer your own whole leadership. I can only draw the floorplan and lay the foundation, though. It’s up to you to build your own house. To that end, we include a section titled Praxis at the conclusion of each chapter. It will help you move from theory to practice.\n\nAt the risk of sounding a little cosmic, I also hope to spark concern over the state of our leadership, public and private, and to prompt a serious conversation about the role of healthy leaders and the role of healthy followers in a society that depends on both, now more than ever. Ideally, this conversation will include discussion of leadership as the purposeful agency of change (or real leadership); of clear, credible, coherent, cogent communication as its energy — its solar power, if you will — and of both emotional maturity and stewardship as essential components of wise, connective, and productive leadership in the twenty-first century. I’m hoping it will prove to be a refreshing counterpoint to the recent proliferation of wannabe autocrats around the world, from Russia and Turkey to Brazil and India.\n\nOn the road to that conversation, beware the common mistakes of ignoring the wisdom of the ages either because it flows from savants who lived long ago (aka dead white men), or because it is too philosophical or theoretical, or because it conflicts with your own preconceived notions. Wisdom, unlike knowledge, is timeless and evergreen. Assuming you have even half the brains you were born with, you can apply it to your situation regardless of when or where you are living and working, regardless of how old you are, and regardless of what challenges you are facing. Wisdom is wisdom. Nor should you retreat because it is philosophical or theoretical. All wisdom is philosophical, and theory is the foundation of expertise of any sort. Given a choice between a surgeon who understands germ theory and one who does not, which would you ask to operate on you? Choosing between two otherwise identical candidates for a senior executive’s job, would you prefer the one who understands management theory or the one who does not?\n\nBy the same token, do not make the common but costly mistake of rejecting the wisdom and expertise of others out of hand. All too often, facing a challenge to their prior beliefs, people deny the validity of new information because it would require them to think critically about their own beliefs. So instead they fall back on their own preconceptions and unchallenged assumptions, and their growth slows to a stop. “A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices,” the American philosopher William James wrote. Indeed, you’re far better off thinking critically and rigorously, and the first step of that is to learn from the wisdom and expertise of others you have reason to respect. Nor should you foolishly limit yourself to examples and insights from your own sector, field, or cohort; business executives can learn plenty from politicians, scientists from artists, Republicans from Democrats, the public sector from the private, the old from the young — and all vice versa.\n\nAccordingly, this book covers a lot of territory. The work of leadership stretches across whole sectors: business, government, associations, academia, media, political campaigns, sports, the fine arts, law enforcement and military, religion, families, diplomacy, and more. The principles of good leadership apply pretty much across the board. In this book I usually address them all without specific reference to a particular venue or context. Where appropriate, as in our discussion of the differences between management and leadership, I will focus on one or two of those contexts. Still, the insights will be of value to any leader anywhere.\n\nI have been teaching leadership and its cousins — communication, trust, and service — for twenty-five years, mainly but not exclusively in the corporate universe. When I was getting started, I labored to find effective ways to explain the abstractions of leadership and strategic communication, and I soon realized the value of imposing structure and graphic design on abstraction. Mainly this takes the form of models that depict a reality of some sort. They have the advantage of showing rather than just telling, so that people can see things as they are and visualize things that are not yet. That matters because many people find it difficult to take ownership of anything they cannot fully grasp, and they cannot grasp what they cannot see. In other words, to own something, people must see it first. In addition, seeing it helps to bridge the gaps between differing cognitive styles (as in engineering versus the liberal arts) and to overcome cultural, linguistic, and national differences and barriers around the world.\n\nThe work of building better leaders has taken me to more than a dozen countries on five continents and to the lecterns of a top university. It has always been a joy; at the end of the day I am physically exhausted but mentally, emotionally, and even spiritually rejuvenated. Thousands of business managers and executives have come through my master classes, and I have learned as much from them as they from me. Together we have plowed the furrows of this great field so that you don’t have to. What we have learned from one another will help you become a better and wiser leader, I am confident.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, you should know a few other things about me. I have always been fascinated by leadership, and over the course of my life I have studied it and thought about it a great deal. My first experience in the world of grown-up leadership came at the age of seventeen; I will share the insights from that experience in this book. I am now happily pursuing my third or fourth career, all of which have had something to do with leadership, so it has been a lifelong vocation as well as avocation for me.\n\nMy first career was in journalism. Because my beat was politics, I had many opportunities to interview major political leaders (including four U.S. presidents and countless presidential candidates) at some length. After picking up an advanced degree that included the academic study of leadership, I worked for a multinational corporation as a speechwriter for the CEO and chairman of the board. In that capacity I observed and learned a great deal about corporate governance and leadership, and I was able to begin a practice of benchmarking successful companies; to date I have visited almost thirty large corporations to learn what they have done well and not so well. In the 1990s I embarked on a path of consulting and training leaders and aspiring leaders. You are about to read many of the insights, principles, explanations, and stories from all this work.\n\nFurther in the interest of full disclosure, you should know that I am a white male who has lived his entire life in the Upper Midwest of the United States. I grew up in a town-and-gown community named Appleton, which is so all-American even its name sounds all-American. My breadbasket roots and American perspective are undeniable frames for me. But I have been fortunate to travel widely, and I am sensitive to marginalization. In this book I have tried my best to keep any biases in check and to offer broadly inclusive examples. Ultimately, my ethnicity, race, gender, age, and perspective will remain indelible markers. You can take the boy out of Wisconsin, but you can’t take Wisconsin out of the boy.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is important at the outset, if only briefly, to flag a few important concepts and themes that run throughout this book.\n\nOne theme is the subtitle’s reference to the twenty-first century. You certainly do not need to be told how much has changed in the last thirty or forty years. Technology alone has revolutionized the world. Donald Trump and his ideological kin upended politics. Some of the largest companies in the world didn’t exist a generation ago. Many of those that did are no longer in business. Terrorists struck at the epicenters of global commerce and democracy. Social media have nearly displaced the news media. A worldwide pandemic brought almost every aspect of life to a standstill. We are finally having a long-overdue conversation about race in America, albeit prompted by recurring violence. Political fanatics, religious zealots, and white supremacists are unapologetically brazen. In parts of the world both gay marriage and marijuana are legal, a reality inconceivable until recently. Communism is a faint shadow of its Iron Curtain contours, though a few old apparatchiks are stubbornly and feverishly despotic still, and in some quarters democracy itself is under siege. Globalization, for better or worse, is both a fact of life and a favorite whipping boy for populists, even after the pandemic took a bite out of it.\n\nAspiring leaders must weave all these profound societal changes into their large leadership, simply because they must connect with followers in a way that their followers embrace. The work of leadership must be contextual. Of course we can learn from history, and we should; however, leaders who act as if the twenty-first century is a rerun of the twentieth century are and will continue to be unable to connect with most people in the 2020s and beyond. It’s an uncertain and challenging time to offer leadership but, to invoke imagery from Corinthians, no leader can afford to blow an uncertain trumpet.\n\nAnother theme is the distinction between leadership and management. As you will see especially in the fourth chapter, leadership and management are fundamentally different — though perhaps not for the reasons you think. It is not true, for one thing, that managing is bad and leading is its better. Nor is it true that leaders and bosses are cat-and-rat caricatures, that you should start being a leader and stop being a boss (though if you are commonly bossy you should definitely stop that). Nor is it true that leadership is the head and management is the belly of corporate morphology. Nor, finally, is it true that good leadership and good management are mutually exclusive. We actually need them both, and we need them both together in the same persons everywhere — up, down, and across any company, cause, or campaign with an eye on change and growth. They are complementary, and both are essential.\n\nStill another recurring theme is the importance of a culture of dignity, emotional maturity, and stewardship — dimensions of whole leadership that, even early in the twenty-first century, get too little attention. Discussions of culture run throughout this book. Emotional maturity (the concept is similar to Daniel Goleman’s emotional intelligence, but it is also substantively different) gets its due in chapter 7. We devote chapter 8 to stewardship, also known as servant leadership or, in my own nomenclature, Fifth Degree Leadership.\n\nFinally, it is important to establish communication as the energy of leadership. Nitin Nohria, former dean of Harvard Business School, put it well: “Communication is the real work of leadership.” For too many executives and government administrators, communication is an afterthought. To the extent they do communicate, they see their effectiveness as a matter of articulation and influence, and of direction and dispatch, so as to secure the alignment of people by telling them what to do and insisting they do it. That’s good and quite sufficient for the tasks of positional management. But the work of real leadership requires more, because it is all about change. It cannot settle for mere alignment. It must insist on engagement, for true engagement is at the heart of a culture that can embrace and sustain the fruits of change and organic growth. That requires communication for the sake of leading people — and lots of it.\n\n* * *\n\nSomeone once called Walt Disney a Hokey Pokey leader, and I can see why. The label comes from the old children’s song, “Do The Hokey Pokey,” which we can use as a cute little anthem for leadership. I’m probably getting some of the lyrics wrong, but it goes a little like this:\n\nYou put your whole self in,\n\nYou take your whole self out,\n\nYou put your whole self in,\n\nAnd you shake it all about,\n\nYou do the Hokey Pokey,\n\nAnd you turn yourself around,\n\nThat's what it's all about!\n\nHokey Pokey leaders put their whole self in, and they turn themselves around. They don’t just go halfway, and they don’t ask others to do what they themselves are unwilling to do. Leading people is not a matter of doing things halfway. You go all in. You bring your whole self to the task. You become your own First Follower.\n\nLet us all strive to be, like Walt Disney, whole leaders — Hokey Pokey leaders. That’s what it’s all about.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOur Crisis of Leadership\n\nTo say we have a crisis of leadership is so banal it feels empty of meaning. We have all heard it said a thousand times. That alone tells you something. Like that old chestnut on the weather, everyone talks about the sorry state of leadership but no one does anything. Building Better Leaders is a reveille call for change. Our crisis of leadership itself requires leadership: yours, mine, and ours. We need to lead the way to a new and better ethic of leadership.\n\nIt isn’t just the simmering crisis of American culture and politics or the ascendancy of authoritarian strongmen around the world. Yes, leadership is plainly suffering in politics and government. It is also hurting in some big corporations and big churches, in families and in schools. Not all of them, certainly, but enough to be a serious problem — and, as any true leader can tell you, therefore also enough to offer a big opportunity, in this case rescuing honorable and bold leadership itself for the future.\n\nWe can see the crisis whenever trusted leaders abuse their moral authority, whenever the control freak in the room threatens and intimidates, whenever a boss blames someone else and takes the credit for himself. We see it whenever conspiracy theorists conjure up a new falsehood and post it to social media, whenever screaming voices and crimson faces overwhelm the calm and quiet voice of fact and reason, whenever anyone in a position of influence and confidence chooses self-indulgence over decency and common morality — and, yes, when a powerful, petty politician asks people to believe nonsense, to profane their values, and to take dramatic, devastating action on his behalf. All this has happened so visibly — and much of it routinely — that we have grown numb to it. Much as we wish to think otherwise, it has become our culture. At this point, anyone who isn’t despairing over the sorry state of leadership doesn’t really understand what’s going on.\n\nTo people like me who grew up in gentler if not kinder times, these lapses and offenses don’t just smell. They reek of indifference, distrust, and zealous overcontrol. For as bad as they are, their sheer number and grievous nature combine like street drugs to aggravate the cynicism pervasive across society today. That is no small problem. Cynicism is so prevalent it seems almost benign, as if it were the mature sobriety of seen-it-all experience. Yet it casts a foul odor over the possibility of constructive change. Downwind from the smokestack of cynicism, few people expect a better tomorrow anymore. Few believe in its promise. People lose hope. Because they expect to see the worst, they actually do see the worst, or they imagine it as the worst and explain it away as inevitable. Thus do we sow the seeds of our own despair.\n\nSo they withdraw. They cleave to people like themselves and to views like their own: the cable news that tells them what they already believe, friends with whom they already agree, and even their own far corners of social media to brief them on what they already “know.” Everyone is in their bubble. In some places they buy into absurd QAnon and 8kun conspiracy theories, and they join calls to shun vaccines and to overturn a free and fair election.\n\nLeaders respond rationally but desperately. In politics, too many leaders rely on the artifice of gerrymandering, on media echo chambers, on quiet quid pro quos, on bundling campaign donations, on absurd accusations, on crude partisan intimidation, on knee-jerk filibusters, and on favors for friends, and they choose division over addition. In business, they fall back on repeated restructurings, dense take-it-or-leave-it terms and conditions, the hammerlock of unnecessary noncompete agreements, ambush pricing, and the amorality of rootless consultants, and when they run out of options for growth they throw up their hands and sell the company — if necessary, to a competitor. On cable television, they scream and yell. Across society people let old tropes, identity, stereotypes, denial, and bias substitute for facts and reasoning, and they commonly put their own short-term gratification over the legitimate long-term interests of society. Even in religion you see it; some have gone so far as to weaponize scripture for their own cultural revolution and to find Satan lurking behind the curtain of commonsense policy initiatives. Everywhere, the badge of cynicism is virulent. It leaves us all fighting among ourselves rather than working together. It’s enough to paralyze democracy, even to defeat democracy. If we ignore it, we may have an existential crisis on our hands.\n\nLionhearted spirits will say this harsh critique is hyperbole. They will argue that for every fallen leader, hundreds of other good leaders are laboring away unnoticed. No question, some are; and many of them ask for neither fame nor appreciation. We all should doff our hats in their honor. But the need for honorable and effective leadership is so great, and its execution often so faint and feeble, that constructive change all but grinds to a halt while despair and cynicism grow deeper. Patterns of disappointment are so profound and so pervasive, and they occur at such a high level of presumptive moral authority — priests, police, presidents, parents — that it’s no stretch to call their leadership broken and failing. It is up to all of us — you, me, our neighbors and colleagues and buddies and, most of all, our kids — to change it. We must not let despair and cynicism win, for if they do, all of us lose.\n\nA big part of the problem is confusion over the very meaning of leadership and its implications for day-to-day activities that give life to its promise. Akin to that is an airy disregard for the huge moral wake of any single leader, almost always someone in a position of legal and official authority. For too many in such positions, cultural change is an Achilles’ heel. They shrink from the difficult and demanding work of actually leading people and changing things for the better, mainly because they don’t want to change themselves. Another part of the problem is a naïve approach to communication, as if it were merely a matter of composure behind a lectern or a tidy PowerPoint slide deck or a rah-rah motivational talk to the troops — rather than the energy of leadership, the solar power that captivates attention and compels people to think, ignites their concern, and clears a path forward. Yet another part is machismo and arrogance, to the neglect of emotional maturity and temperament. Then there is the inattention to the vital matters of trust, service, decency, and community. It’s a long, long list.\n\nReal leadership isn’t easy or simple in the best of circumstances, and it is a tall order in times of despair or chaos. We have been accepting pale imitations of leadership for so long we don’t recognize the real thing when it comes along and kisses us good morning. Today, in an atmosphere of cynicism and scornful derision toward public enterprise of almost every kind, after so many prominent figures have so brazenly squandered their moral authority, and without even a broadly accepted factual reality, it is extraordinarily difficult. But our tomorrows depend on it, and therefore we depend on it. Somehow, we must rise to the challenge.\n\nMeeting such a big challenge will require vigorous, sustained leadership of its own. But the severity of the problem need not paralyze us. Turning it around certainly is a challenge, but real leaders are up to it, as long as we have some guideposts and guardrails to keep us moving in the right direction.\n\nProviding those guideposts and guardrails is one cornerstone of this book. Challenging wrongheaded but conventional notions of leadership is another. Offering practical suggestions that translate theory to practice is yet another. My hope is that anyone reading these pages and thinking about their message can immediately become a better leader.\n\n* * *\n\nWhat do the pages of this book hold for you? I have organized this book in three parts, each of which has three chapters. Each of the nine chapters concludes with a section titled Praxis, a short but uncommon word for moving from theory to actuality, in which we list specific things you can do — questions you can ask, actions you can take, choices you can make — to understand leadership more clearly, to think about it more rigorously, and ultimately to lead more productively in the twenty-first century. Here’s a little roadmap.\n\nPart I is titled “Rethinking Leadership.” These first three chapters tackle conventional assumptions and thinking on leadership and establish a foundation for taking a different and better approach.\n\nIn chapter 1, “Leadership Good and Bad,” we will survey the landscape of leadership, define our terms, and explain what good leadership is and why it is so important. I’m afraid this chapter, despite its title, must paint a bleak picture of contemporary leadership. That is unfortunate but inescapable, simply because so many of our leaders have been disappointing us for so long. I write these words in the wake of the alarming January Sixth Insurrection at the United States Capitol, which represented an abject failure of leadership to a degree that I have never before witnessed, and which appears to be a harbinger of things to come. But so many other failures preceded it that people are all but inured to poor leadership. Thousands of authority figures have revealed themselves to be morally obtuse or even soulless.\n\nThere’s a reason for the pall of cynicism over society, and it’s long past time that we demand and impose a higher standard for leaders everywhere. I am not asking for perfection — leaders, like the rest of us, are imperfectible — but we have every right to expect leaders to care about all of us, not just themselves and their partisans, to offer the best of themselves consistently, not just on their good days but every day, and proudly to turn away from the temptations of unmitigated greed and gross moral turpitude. We should constantly ask: Is that the best you can do? Is this the most you can care? Do you really give a damn?\n\nChapter 2, “Moving from Position to Purpose,” explores five empirical perspectives, or lenses, on leadership, which coincide with five pedestals for offering leadership or asserting influence over people — as a position at the top of an organizational chart, as the exercise of any number of kinds of power, as the presence of appealing personal traits and attributes, as the leverage of an informal role or incidental prominence, and especially and most importantly as the purposeful pursuit and advocacy of change. All five lenses are valid and common. Think of them as ways of understanding the subject. I ask that you lean more heavily on the last of them, real leadership as the purposeful pursuit and advocacy of change, whether it’s a cultural transformation in a corporation or a social renaissance throughout society, or anything in between. That’s the work of leading people through change.\n\nIn chapter 3, “Troglodytes and Philosophers in the Corner Office,” we trace the history and evolution of leadership, in both philosophical and practical terms. Here we will look at how leadership and governance continue to evolve, conceptually and practically. You will meet four archetypes of leadership that have all held different orientations for leaders and different expectations for followers. We will also travel back in time to find the ancient origins of important concepts at the beating heart of leadership. My intent here is to show that the principles of good leadership are nothing new — some of them date back three thousand years — and that whole leadership is a sustainable ethic, not another passing fancy or fad.\n\nPart II is labeled “The Soul of Leadership.” These three chapters explore the challenges of balancing the interests of multiple stakeholders, building trust, and building engagement for organizational and cultural change. All of it hinges on finding the fundamental purpose and ethos of your leadership, and all of it works through a rich, meaningful culture.\n\nChapter 4, “The Geography of Leadership,” unpacks the similarities and differences between managing and leading, both in terms of the work they require and the communication that drives them. Properly understanding these complementary concepts is a prerequisite to bringing about cultural change. There’s a great deal of misunderstanding about management and leadership, and it proves self-limiting. This chapter serves as well as an inquiry into the stakeholders of organizations, especially corporations. We will also examine and dispel a number of oft-quoted myths and misunderstandings about leadership, especially a few hoary aphorisms that have acquired the grand status of cliché. Further in this chapter we dissect the differences in communication for managing and for leading in terms of their values, intent, substance, style, and tone. That’s important, because if you use the wrong one you’ll get the wrong result or not much of any result. It alone goes a long way toward explaining why the vast majority of corporate change initiatives are all but dead-on-arrival.\n\nIn chapter 5, “Tiptoe Through the Tulips,” we analyze the challenge of being trustworthy in an era of cynicism. It relies on a proprietary model we call the Trust Tulip, a sort of Venn diagram with four variables that together account for interpersonal trust: character, competence, affinity, and presence. I call it the Trust Tulip because the diagram relies on ovals, which, when arrayed as a Venn diagram, look like the petals of a tulip.\n\nChapter 6, “The Connection Is Everything,” looks at the principles of clear, credible, coherent, cogent communication for leadership. We’ll examine some of the common problems in communication for both macro- and micro-leadership. We’ll tell you about the metamessage, which alone accounts for a great deal of miscommunication, and show you how to manage it. We will offer an eight-step approach to listening more fully and deeply as well.\n\nPart III has the label “Whole Leadership.” These final three chapters show you how to become a better leader, capable of inspiring a new generation of leaders who can follow in your footsteps. The keys are emotional maturity and soulful service. We close it, and the book, with a discussion of the gestalt of leadership.\n\nChapter 7, “The Whole Leader,” is perhaps the most challenging part of this book for many readers, as it explores commonplace notions of charisma and dissects little-discussed aspects of emotional maturity (similar in some respects to Daniel Goleman’s concept of emotional intelligence but differing in both structure and composition). Emotional maturity includes big issues relating to community, dignity, vulnerability, empathy, and much more. My hope is that you will reflect deeply on each component and ask some tough-love questions of yourself on the intent and the reality of your presence as a leader. I suggest doing so with a private journal, in any of a zillion smartphone apps designed for this purpose (my preference is Day One) or a nice leather-bound journal, which you can pick up for twenty-five bucks at most booksellers. I personally use both.\n\nDeveloping the material for this chapter posed a challenge of its own for me. I danced around the subject for years before finally creating a supplementary day-long workshop to explore its components in depth. (This day follows two other full days of the master class devoted to leadership and communication, so I was increasing the time commitment and the price tag by fifty percent each.) I was reluctant to “go there” because of the emotional and introspective nature of the subject. Some colleagues advised against it, on the grounds that business is all about nitty-gritty numbers. As I subsequently came to appreciate, however, those numbers follow the work of people. Business is actually all about people. Thus we need to keep the spotlight on people.\n\nWhat finally nudged me in the right direction was the strongly favorable reaction of engineers and other STEM-trained managers (mostly male, and at that time mostly in manufacturing) in our two-day master class to a single PowerPoint slide with just four or five words as prompts. As I recall the words were dignity, empathy, vulnerability, authenticity, and perhaps self-awareness. What surprised me so was that people always wanted to talk and talk about that one simple slide. They would talk deeply and candidly, too. They would talk for forty-five, even sixty minutes about just those four or five words — and these were introverted engineers!\n\nI finally decided that, as much as we all have to make our monthly nut, keeping our sanity and finding our heart have something to be said for them as well. Unless and until we explore the real nature of working in community — and especially the emotional dimensions of leadership, which is after all an emotional connection — we will be a frustrated lot. We can pay a severe price in terms of pathologies like hypertension, anxiety, isolation, pent-up hostility, and worse, and it can manifest itself in various unhealthful forms of exit. In the workplace they include abrupt resignations, unnecessary turnover and retraining, ridicule, marginalization, and tragically even violence. Away from work it can show up as a sickening brew of high blood pressure, addictions, depression, road rage, alienation, ostracism, domestic abuse, anger, divorce, and even suicide. We owe it to ourselves, our families, and our communities to do better. Indeed we must.\n\nIn chapter 8, we turn our attention to the ill-named subject of servant leadership. If anything can fairly be termed the magic sauce of great leadership, this is it. The name is problematic though. I prefer to call it stewardship, or serving leadership, or service leadership, or Fifth Degree Leadership — anything to get away from the image of a dour British butler like Anthony Hopkins as Stevens in Remains of the Day.\n\nStewardship has a glorious pedigree at the roots of all seven of the great religions of the world. But, not unlike Stoicism, it fell into the dustbin of history over the millennia. The late Robert K. Greenleaf, an AT&T engineer in the 1950s, rescued servant leadership in his retirement years, and a handful of forward-thinking organizations that value leadership (perhaps counterintuitively, even including the United States Marine Corps) took notice. Companies that have adopted a culture of stewardship commonly have workforces at the highest level of engagement, and you regularly see their trademarks on the cover of magazines that publish lists of best employers or best places to work. We will explain what it’s all about, and we will do some advocating for change ourselves. (Happily, we note that Stoicism is also enjoying a revival. It even has its own Facebook group with 50,000 followers.)\n\nFinally, in chapter 9, “The Gestalt of Leadership,” we bring everything together to paint a portrait of good leadership. My aim here is to show you that, contrary to the habits of an analytical mind, we should synthesize what we know about leadership, what we know about communication, what we know about emotional maturity, and what we know about stewardship to create whole leaders who are more than the sum of their parts.\n\n* * *\n\nOne last preliminary note. As you read the pages of this book, you will notice I use certain modifiers to describe idealized visions of leadership. For ease of reference:\n\nReal leadership refers to leadership as the purposeful pursuit of change. It is the fifth and last of the five empirical perspectives, or lenses, on leadership that we introduce in chapter 2. We call it “real leadership” not because the other four lenses are unreal but because people commonly use that phrase as shorthand for the active, responsible work that successful leaders do — particularly in its absence.\n\nA true leader is anyone, regardless of position or rank, who knows, appreciates, embraces, and carries out the hard work of leading people. True leaders are also ground leaders, who may or may not be official or titular leaders.\n\nLarge leadership refers to leadership that undertakes especially tall challenges involving vast numbers of people. Its distinguishing feature is its outsize ambition and scope.\n\nWhole leadership refers to real leadership that embodies purposeful change, mutual trust, noble communication, emotional maturity, and stewardship in significant measure. It brings together leader and led and finds a soulful connection between them, and it moves people to principled and inspired choices and behavior.\n\nI rarely use the term thought leadership, in part because it strikes me as stale and in part because all active leadership involves leading people to think differently. If it matters to you, a good thought leader would find resonance with all four of the terms we just defined.\n\nReady? Let’s turn the page and get started. Enjoy!\n\nChapter 1\n\nLeadership Good and Bad\n\nWhat It Is and Why It Matters\n\nFor all our differences, people everywhere still have a few things in common. Regardless of our age, our religion, or our native land, almost everyone enjoys an evening around a fireplace or campfire, a good story well told, and a hearty laugh with friends. We feel moved by music that recalls our youth, our heartland, or the home fires of family and romance. And no matter who we are, or where we are, or what we believe, we generally want to come together to work and play with other people. We always have, and we always will.\n\nWhen we do find ourselves in community — it can be a business or a church, a political campaign or a football team, an orchestra or an infantry, an agency of government, a neighborhood or a condominium association, a service or advocacy organization, or a fledgling public cause of some sort — we prefer to be with like-minded people who share our values and concerns, perhaps even our background and education. If things are fine as they are, most of us just want to stay on course. But when change is in the air, or when something threatens our security and well-being, or when our common interests and values begin to fade, or when a stifling pallor of uncertainty and fear settles over us, we look to leaders who can give us direction and meaning, who can remind us of who we uniquely are and what we believe, who can energize us and hold us together, and who can bring out the best in us. We want leaders whom we can trust and believe in.\n\nThat’s a lot to ask, we are learning. In both politics and business and in every other walk of life, good leaders come along all too infrequently, and their cheap substitutes disappoint all too frequently. Ordinary folks commonly use the phrases “a leadership crisis” or “a leadership vacuum” to describe it, and they often express a plaintive appeal for “some real leaders” to come along and rescue them. Even as we pine for good leadership, and even as we pride ourselves on a heritage of noble leadership in years past, the sobering reality is that we see so little of it today that we have largely lost sight of its value and potential.\n\nAll around us, it seems, so many of the individuals to whom we look for wisdom, morality, courage, and guidance turn out to be profoundly in need of it themselves, or so capricious and self-indulgent that they are useless as role models, or so self-satisfied with their own success they are oblivious to everyone else, or just stuck in the muck of stale, insipid notions of leadership that serve no one well. The ancients called it caecus caeco dux — the blind leading the blind.\n\nYou know you have a serious problem when elections fall into question for no reason, when cops and coaches and clergy commit heinous crimes with seeming impunity, when madmen shoot up schools and theaters and workplaces, when people believe anything they want without evidence, when the peaceful transfer of power in the world’s oldest democracy is suddenly rocked with violence and its outcome uncertain, when civic responsibility looks to some like an assault on freedom, when people call themselves patriotic while waving flags of old mortal enemies, when so many people routinely expect the worst of everyone else, and when moral and intellectual authority loses its standing altogether. None of this is normal. None of it is customary. All of it together is a mess. It is chaos. It is the flotsam that weak leadership leaves in its wake.\n\nThese smoldering embers of leadership absolutely deserve our time, attention, and response. We must stoke up their flickering flames, lest we find ourselves unable to shape our own destiny. Among the important conversations we need to have is a conversation about leadership itself: What have we come to expect of it? What should we expect of it? What can we reasonably ask of it? What norms should we demand that it respect? How can we challenge it to be more, do more, offer more? And their other side: What does real leadership demand of us, as leaders? These questions are relevant for all of us and especially for the positional leaders of our great institutions — presidents, chief executives, board chairs, and directors. We all need to question and rethink some of our basic assumptions about leadership.\n\n* * *\n\nBy leadership, I have in mind something far greater than getting other people to do what you want. That is a small, crude, and obnoxious take on leadership. I recoil whenever I hear it. It is small because it dwells more on expedience for someone’s arbitrary agenda than on a large, transcendent cause eclipsing individual concern. It is crude because it has more to do with control and manipulation than with high inspiration. It is obnoxious because it implicitly regards followers as vassals to some sort of quasi-feudal lord. If just getting people to do what you want is your definition of leadership, you have already failed as a leader, and in the twenty-first century you will never succeed until it no longer is.\n\nRather, we should think of leadership in a larger way, as the uncommon and noble work of engaging the complete will of people — physically, mentally, emotionally, arguably even spiritually — and sending it into battle against an unsatisfactory and unsatisfying status quo, so that people can achieve big things together they cannot achieve alone. It is the hard work of identifying and giving voice to a future that people want so much they will passionately and courageously invest themselves in its achievable reality. They may grouse along the way, of course, but they will often surprise even themselves. Years later, like grizzled old war veterans nursing a beer, they will recall the experience with reverential respect.\n\nLeaders who embrace such a large, enlightened view of their work will find their leadership to be much more effective and satisfying, and its happy results to be much more sustainable. In short, as leaders we must ask more, much more, of ourselves, and we must ask much more of the people whom we lead. If we fail to do that, we are not leaders but unleaders.\n\nWe should challenge and rethink another basic aspect of leadership as well. Leaders, especially those operating from a high-level position in an organization, often feel as though leadership is mainly a projection or application of their own vision, their own values, their own priorities. It is that, of course, but that isn’t the entire picture. Something else is of critical importance: the relational context in which leader and led find each other and begin working together in common cause.\n\nLeadership actually comes into being “in the between” — in other words, between the leader and the led — as a kind of mutual-aid agreement, which is always mitigated by their social and cultural environment. Like an exothermic chemical reaction, its extraordinary power is a product of three elements. They are, first, the leader’s direction (a vision, or agenda, or priority, or concern); second, the follower’s receptivity (values, needs, will, and meaning); and, third, both of them together in a conducive time, place, and culture.\n\nThe context alone can be determinative; what works in peacetime doesn’t necessarily work in war, what works in America doesn’t necessarily work in Asia, and what works in a Silicon Valley startup may or may not work in a prideful, unionized, century-old widget maker. But in no context do leaders lead all by themselves, any more than followers follow all by themselves. Rather, they both rely on each other, in the here and now. More than anything, leadership is a connection, a coupling, within the context of particular circumstances. The ice-cold reality is that the leader needs followers more than any follower needs a leader. If anything deserves to be labeled by that ungainly word synergy, it’s the relationship between leaders and the led. Only self-congratulatory and seriously delusional leaders give themselves all the credit.\n\n* * *\n\nBut wait. Reasonable people can reasonably ask whether anything has really changed. Haven’t we always had malicious or foolish leaders? Is dysfunctional leadership truly anything new? Paradoxically, the answer to both questions is yes. We have indeed always had poor leaders. But lately we have lowered the bar quite a bit further. The consequences are not pretty.\n\nTo acknowledge the obvious: Evil has always been with us, and awful leadership has always been around the next bend. It shows up as deceit, recklessness, greed, ignorance, hatred, paranoia, manipulation, zealous overcontrol, and worse. It has led to many of the worst experiences in human history: war, famine, dislocation, enslavement, slaughter, and misery.\n\nNonetheless, over the course of centuries, the world was slowly moving from worse to better. In his myth-busting 2011 book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, Steven Pinker crunched the numbers to demonstrate that people were materially much better off than ever before, over the eons of human life. {Endnote: Steven Pinker, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined (Viking, 2011), pp. ____.} It is easy to forget that for most people throughout most of human history, life was, as Thomas Hobbes put it, “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”\n\nOnly a generation ago, civilization stood fairly united in a remarkably halcyon time. Technology was beginning to bestow its gifts on the world. Apartheid had ended. China was rapidly becoming modern. The Troubles in Northern Ireland were drawing to a close. The Cold War was over, and the Berlin Wall lay in broken, scattered bricks. Democracy was triumphant; the noted political economist Francis Fukuyama, now at Stanford University, went so far as to declare “the end of history” as liberal democracy stood in blessed victory. We were even making some progress on such gnawing, stubborn problems as pollution, inflation, nuclear arms, and civil rights; and, in the United States, we actually balanced the budget for three years straight. To be sure, our overall progress was inconsistent and incomplete, and the world was still far from perfect, but things were a whole lot better than they had been since time immemorial. Even our wrenching ordeals had something of a salubrious aftertaste: from the horror of holocausts to the latest partisan power grab, at least we witnessed broad outrage and revulsion. Now even that seems a forlorn hope.\n\nWhat happened? Over the last few decades we have seriously weakened the norms and grievously debased the standards of our leadership. Almost everywhere you look, you see both a reluctance to lead for the greater good and an extraordinary incompetence in leadership. The evidence is in the mess all around us. Today, largely because of poor or absentee leadership, we have chaos where we once had temperance, regression where we once had progress, and toxic intolerance where we once had civil amicability.\n\n* * *\n\nAs we have seen, the twenty-first century poses particularly serious challenges for leadership writ large, but thankfully it also offers a fountain of hope. The challenges arise from the erosion of institutional memory and cultural norms, as matters that were long taken for granted are suddenly again up for grabs. They stem from the profusion of irresponsible voices in the arena of public opinion, eager to dispute obvious facts and straightforward reasoning. They flow from technology that poses unseen threats by hackers half a world away who can tamper with the vast networks of computers and data that hold us together but whose vulnerability most of us have scarcely thought about. Most especially, the challenges arise from the slow decline of democracy around the world and even some early signs of its decline in liberal, rule-based Western societies. If it dies, there will be no need for leaders. We may be closer to that fate than many of us realize.\n\nEver the optimist, I nevertheless find hope in this dreary landscape. More people are educated than ever before. For broad swaths of people, diversity and inclusion have become important watchwords. The very technology that renders us vulnerable also enables almost anyone to communicate almost instantly with almost everyone. At the press of a button, we can share noble ideas and inspiring memes. Finally, we can find hope in the fact that venerable bases and blocs of institutional power are yielding to small upstarts and individual initiative. In The End of Power, a fascinating examination of the erosion of centralized authority in a broad array of fields, Moisés Naím cites examples in government, finance, the military, education, business, religion, philanthropy, labor unions, and even competitive chess to document his thesis that power and prestige just aren’t what they used to be. Those granite-block obstacles to change are beginning to crack. {Endnote: Moisés Naím, The End of Power, pp. ____.}\n\nCivilization has always needed leadership, even if the word itself didn’t come into common usage until the nineteenth century. (The verb to lead is older, dating back to the 900s. The noun leader came along in the 1400s, and the noun leadership finally arrived in the early 1800s.) For thousands of years, what we think of as leadership consisted of a parley of tribal elders, the courage of a swordsman at the head of a cavalry, a divinely ordained nobleman, or the sway of mystics, oracles, shamans, prophets, and sages. Leadership was mainly the exercise of power — tangible or spiritual, real or perceived, as promises or threats — as well as the imprint of social meaning and tribal identity, an organizing force for conquering new territory or defending a homeland, and an arbiter of justice. Someone had to be in charge, lest the tribe disintegrate into internecine factions. As long as twenty or thirty centuries ago, scholars were noting, prizing, and thinking critically about rulers and governance. All these many years later, we still are. We still recognize the importance of good leadership. We still prize it. We still celebrate it.\n\nLeadership is important for fundamental reasons. It knits us together. We feel closer to one another. We are blessed with new meaning and new purpose for our lives. A good leader offers us an identity and a big reason for being in this time and place. More to the point, good leadership seizes opportunities and challenges that we can use together to better our lot. As a happy result, honorable and effective leadership bequeaths to us more security, more freedom, more wealth, more community, more meaning. Finally, together with dedicated followers, it can bend the arc of history. It ushers in a new and better tomorrow.\n\nTo appreciate that, just think of some of the glorious examples of successful leadership. History, literature, and cinema offer examples aplenty. The story of England’s Henry V at Agincourt, drawn from all three, is classic if shopworn, but it’s as good as any to illustrate. We don’t know Henry’s actual words on the eve of the Battle of Agincourt, but we do know the history of the historic battle, and we have Shakespeare’s eponymous drama to capture the scene and put rather Shakespearean words on Henry’s lips. You can still view Kenneth Branagh’s magnificent 1989 movie of the same name. If you haven’t already seen it, you should make a point of doing so.\n\nAs a matter of historical fact, the Hundred Years’ War made for a long, bloody century. King Henry (portrayed by Branagh on stage and in the film) and his troops were cornered in the north of France in October 1415 en route back to the English Channel and home. They were outnumbered and outmatched by the Franks. They had no realistic hope for survival. It fell on Henry to summon their will, lest they all perish the next day, on the Feast of St. Crispin’s, which had been celebrated throughout Christendom for a millennium. Shakespeare gave Henry a rare gift of eloquence:\n\nWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers;\n\nFor he to-day that sheds his blood with me\n\nShall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,\n\nThis day shall gentle his condition;\n\nAnd gentlemen in England now a-bed\n\nShall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,\n\nAnd hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks\n\nThat fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.\n\nRead the first words again: “We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; for he to-day that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.” In those brief words, Henry weaves together and draws tight the bond of brotherhood. That bond, that shared identity, was worth more than all the men and all their weaponry on the other side.\n\nHad the English lost the St. Crispin’s Day battle at Agincourt, we would scarcely remember it, and we would have no reason even to wonder about Henry’s leadership the night before. We might even have forgotten Henry V himself. But the English miraculously won, thanks to Henry and his band of brothers, and six hundred years later we still remember.\n\n* * *\n\nPeople go round and round on the question of who is and who isn’t a leader. The question has both objective and subjective answers, which may or may not mesh for any one person. That alone can explain why people go round and round over it.\n\nObjectively speaking, the answer depends on which “lens” you are using to view leadership — we’ll explain this concept and explore all five lenses in the next chapter — and on the criteria, or threshold, for that particular lens. (Criteria are essential. Without criteria, a judgment is nothing more than just another dime-a-dozen opinion, worth even less than you paid for it.) Although there’s no consensus on those criteria, and therefore some subjectivity can creep in, standard dictionaries have something to say about it, too. This much is clear: It’s less a matter of someone’s manner or style than it is of the influence and inspiration she casts over others. Kind and gentle have little to do with it, though of course we all like a mensch. The truth is that there are plenty of bossy, autocratic leaders out there, and there are plenty of collaborative, consensual “bosses” as well. (We’ll dive deeper into this in chapter 4.) Indeed, in some circumstances — the Titanic is sinking, and people need to get into lifeboats — bossy and autocratic can be exactly what’s needed in the moment.\n\nSubjectively speaking, it depends entirely on you, the beholder. You get to choose. Elon Musk? Greta Thunberg? Liz Cheney? Amal Clooney? It’s your choice.\n\nFor beholders, the focus on a leader becomes abstract and academic. Reaching for a frame of reference, they think instead of their leader. Their leader is the one who represents their interests, needs, and concerns; who shares their identity and culture; who talks and acts like them, and who wants what they want. Folks who proudly wear MAGA hats have long viewed Donald Trump as their leader, for example, while others have cringed at the thought. Historically evil men like Hitler, Stalin, and Mao had plenty of dedicated followers who viewed them as their leaders. In subjective terms, the answer revolves around whether and to what degree a putative leader speaks not merely to but for certain cohorts of people — that is, the extent to which he represents their concerns, beliefs, priorities, and values. Perhaps owing to millennia of tribal heritage, people naturally ask: Is he “one of us”? The turnstile to that question is especially real in cases of socioeconomic grievance, as it was in Weimar Germany and a number of pre-revolutionary societies (think czarist Russia and dynastic China) and is now evident in visible and audible racial tension and nationalist politics as North America and Europe grow evermore diverse.\n\nAlong the same lines, people go round and round over the question of good leadership. After accepting the fact that Caesar and Napoleon were leaders period, they ask whether they were good leaders. Here again, it’s important to define your words and specify your criteria before rendering a judgment, lest you simply turn up the volume without clarifying your own reasoning or convincing anyone else of your point of view.\n\nNow, before going any further, it’s important to talk about that eight-hundred-pound gorilla over there. I realize you may think I am leading you down the proverbial primrose path to my own politics, so a few words of candor are in order. As a private citizen like everyone else, I naturally have my own preferences for certain policies and principles in public governance and in the marketplace, but I am not here to proselytize, especially on domestic partisan politics. I’ll leave that to politicians with perfect coiffures. As an observer and critic of leadership, however, I do speak out and advocate for minimally acceptable standards that apply across the board, in public governance and in business enterprise, on the left and the right, in America and abroad, and in every field of endeavor.\n\nThese standards consist of the guardrails and guideposts I mentioned in the Introduction: simple respect for people; an ethical compass and a sense of common decency; straightforward honesty and the recognition of empirical reality; thoughtful preparation and policy; a large embrace of community and a commitment to bringing people together in a transcendent common cause; the affirmation of people regardless of irrelevant criteria; emotional stability and maturity; the wisdom and humility of one’s years; continuous learning and growth; the recognition of duty and obligation; reasoned and rational advocacy; service to others before oneself; appealing to “the better angels of our nature,” as Lincoln put it; and clear, credible, coherent, and cogent communication. None of this should be too much to ask. As basic as this threshold is, and as familiar to us all as it once was, it seems to be out of reach for too many leaders today, and far too few people seem to care or even to notice.\n\nTo my thinking, good leadership is minimally a two-horse carriage: what a leader proposes to do and how the leader proposes to do it. Thus it strives to be both honorable and effective, both noble and competent. It is a matter of purpose and process, of priorities and energy, of philosophy and technique. It’s a classic twofer, and either alone is never enough. Leadership that is honorable but ineffective, or noble but incompetent, is a nice try. Leadership that is effective and competent but dishonorable or ignoble is a joyride to nowhere. People want and need both honorable and effective leaders, both noble and competent leadership. Because appraising the what of good leadership depends so much on someone’s personal views and values, and the how of good leadership on a sophisticated understanding of the art of leadership, two reasonable persons can reasonably disagree as to whether any particular leader is good.\n\nIf you ask me, leadership is honorable and noble (the what) when it rests on both empirical and moral truth, when it holds itself accountable rather than blaming others or whining like a victim, when it functions within the norms and expectations of a particular culture, when its results are widely seen as decent and propitious to the well-being of large numbers of people — not just to the leader’s own reputation, comfort, or wealth — and when its results contribute to a society in which most people want to live. Leadership is effective and competent (the how) when it reaches out to people, finds their values and concerns, touches their heart, unites them in a common cause, and then enrolls and guides them through a large challenge to a productive and satisfactory result. Some aspects of good leadership, such as the affirmation of people and their cohesion in a constructive common mission, live in both houses. In other words, leadership is honorable and effective, or noble and competent, which is to say good, when its touchstones are real, its soul is intact, and people are better off because of it.\n\nGood leadership has an ugly swan of a cousin: strong leadership. I say “ugly swan” because it’s something that could be beautiful and admirable but commonly isn’t. People frequently say they want strong leadership when — I hope, anyway — what they really want is good and steadfast leadership. The trouble is that, here again, its meaning is unclear. At one extreme, you could think of strong leadership as far-sighted initiative, undaunted perseverance, and stoic self-control in the face of adversity. At the other extreme, you could conjure up a banana-republic tyrant — a “strongman” — in a military uniform and medallion-bedecked saffron sash, clenching his fists as he berates someone before dispatching him to the firing squad. The phrase one person speaks isn’t necessarily the phrase that someone else hears.\n\nMy own take is that strong leadership should never be confused with the arrogance of command or with brutish aggressiveness. Rather, we should think of strong leadership — and of the real strength required of true leadership — as the courage of conviction, as the will to persevere, as the ability to control one’s instincts, as the capacity for deep self-reflection, and as the recognition of the importance of emotional intelligence. Here are a couple of simple litmus tests: If you are raising your voice to overwhelm other voices, you are not a strong leader but probably just another loudmouth. The same is true if you are ambushing someone else’s posts on Facebook and other social media; in that event, you are probably just another cynical troll. And if you are ridiculing someone who isn’t as smart or talented as yourself, you are probably just small. Remember, to belittle is to be little.\n\nIn his unlikely best-selling book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, a modern classic, Robert M. Pirsig wrestled with the definition and description of something he called Quality — his caps, not mine — and reached the conclusion that we can know it by its absence. When something is no better than its complete absence, it isn’t a thing of quality, value, beauty, or utility. Apply that test to leadership, and its optimal value is instantly clear. We know leadership optimally to be of value because, when it is absent or even just poor, we’re left with a mess on our hands. We’re in a state of chaos. That’s where we find ourselves today. {Endnote: Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values (William Morrow, 1974), pp. 215-219.}\n\nFor something of such value, you might expect a robust consensus on what leadership is and how it works, but that is not the case. There are literally hundreds of definitions of leadership — most of them silly, reductive, or useless — along with widespread misunderstanding of it, which we will straighten out in chapters 2 and 4. For now, just appreciate a few core truths: First, real leadership is never inert or infirm, but what may appear to be strong leadership is often only weak leadership in disguise, flailing its arms and gasping for breath — something “full of sound and fury, signifying nothing,” as Macbeth put it. Second, trustworthy leadership minimally requires integrity, competence, affinity, and presence. Third, communication is both the energy of leadership and the face and expression of leadership, and thus, for all intents and purposes, the quality of a leader’s communication is the quality of her leadership, at least as it is perceived by people receptive to its message.\n\nThat raises two other questions: What exactly does communication for leadership look like? And what exactly does good communication for leadership do?\n\nThe communication certainly may involve oratory, but speechifying is only a small part of it. Nor is it just a knack for clever phrasing, or cool sangfroid in the glare of television cameras, or a dazzling PowerPoint slide deck, or a fulgent smile, or a politician’s gladhanding along a rope line. All that is icing on the cake. The meat and potatoes of communication for leadership involves much, much more. At a minimum it must listen to people and feel what they feel; it must convey clear, credible, coherent, and cogent messages, and it must take responsibility for the interpretation and application of those messages. And, as we shall see, because it begins and ends in community, its success requires a colloquy of some sort, a discursive conversation with multiple voices at the table. It speaks not just to but with and for the people it leads.\n\nIndeed, like leadership itself, it reaches out to people, touches them, and brings them into the fold. Optimally, it works like the philosopher’s stone of medieval alchemy, inasmuch as it creates belief out of doubt, confidence out of despair, energy out of inertia, unity out of disunity, direction out of confusion, enthusiasm out of indifference, coherence out of chaos, perseverance out of vacillation — in short, more out of less. In contrast, so-called leaders who rely on shouting, lies, intimidation, insults, grievance, threats and the like have the opposite effect. They are not leaders but unleaders, and their minions and trolls on social media are not conscientious followers but mere marionettes.\n\n* * *\n\nThe ultimate test of leadership is in the hands of history: Do people sense that things changed, and did they change for the better? That’s simple enough, but time is a fickle juror. It tends to minimize, in the mind’s eye, just how much has actually changed. Time bends the spectrum of right and wrong, too. The years dilute passion, just as they broaden perspective. Concerns of the moment come and go. Selective memories recall this but not that. A leader who appears dark and dismal in his own time may appear bold and enlightened in the eyes of a decade or a century hence, and vice versa.\n\nAs a teenager, for example, I scorned U.S. President Lyndon Johnson’s ever-deepening commitment to the Vietnam War, and I cheered when he withdrew from the 1968 presidential campaign. Decades later, I have a more beneficent and amicable view of Johnson, whom I see today on balance as basically a decent and effective leader whose legacy was eventually handicapped by a stallion’s blinkers of pride, groupthink, convention, and obstinacy. The converse has occurred with regard to slave-owning founders of the United States, whose names, reputations, and likenesses were fixtures of the American narrative and landscape but now are fading before our eyes.\n\nWe have no time machine — we cannot look back on ourselves from the vantage point of generations to come — but we can acknowledge the obvious: Without honorable and effective leadership up, down, and across society, especially in government and in business at all levels, we are stuck. It can feel as though we are bound at the wrists and shackled at the ankles, unable to grow, unable to move. Constructive change is beyond our fingertips.\n\nHow long has it been since Americans, to take the nearest example, last enthusiastically embraced a large, broadscale cause? It seems like forever. Today even an easy rallying cry like overcoming a common enemy, a deadly pathogen, by simply masking, distancing, and vaccinating instead became a cleaver drawn down the middle of the body politic, slicing us apart rather than pulling us together. Or take an earnest and heartfelt plea for dignity and decency — that Black Lives Matter, too — which is deemed so offensive to aggrieved but privileged people that they brandish semi-automatic weapons in hopes of intimidating protesters. And such a routine matter as counting ballots in an election somehow falls into a noisy dispute because, and only because, one of the candidates irrationally refuses to accept reality and then all but demands an insurrection. Within an hour, the mob would build a gallows and chant calls for the arrest and summary execution of the vice president of the United States — this, in 2021! These are the depths to which a great democracy can quickly sink in the absence of honorable and effective leadership.\n\nWe must not forget that shameful day or, for that matter, a whole litany of failures of leadership over the course of decades, lest we run the risk of sacrificing everything we have and value to Nero’s fiddle. The first steps on the road to wisdom are the steps we take toward seeing reality, not as our cultural pride and political mythology would have it — cue the pastoral sunrise with a Dodge pickup, bales of straw, and Sam Elliott’s earthy baritone — but rather as it is, with its blemishes and abuse and dysfunction, all of a piece. The alternative is to condone and perpetuate the mistakes we have been making, in which case we will be unable to muster the will to meet our challenges ahead, simply because we cannot recognize the need for good leadership when we see it.\n\nThe rare jewel of leadership both noble and competent stands in marvelous, inspiring contrast. Over the last few centuries some towering figures — Addams, von Bismarck, Bolívar, Catherine the Great, Churchill, Deng, Gandhi, Havel, Humboldt, Helen Keller, King, Lawrence of Arabia, Lincoln, Mandela, Nehru, Nightingale, Peron, Reagan, the Roosevelts, Salk, Shackleton, muckrakers like Sinclair and Tarbell, Mother Teresa, Thatcher, Queen Victoria, Walesa, Washington — stood apart from other, lesser leaders because they were seen as both basically decent and atypically talented. Of course, none was perfect or even close to it, and they all had vocal critics eager to call them out. But the ledger of their ultimate impact, in the judgment of large populations of people and of history, was generally or at least arguably in the affirmative. Additionally, as their number shows all too well, they were uncommon individuals in uncommon times. That’s why the world remembers their names.\n\nWe are not here just to sing their praises, however. They have had enough hosannas. Rather, I am hoping to ignite a prairie fire of leadership for legitimate public campaigns and causes and in organizations of all kinds — corporations, associations, agencies, banks, hospitals, startups, nonprofits, advocacy groups, clubs, teams, orchestras, museums, armies, even families — that together represent life in the twenty-first century. For in order to gather sufficient will to confront the serious challenges we face, we need more and better leaders who can draw us together and send us forth. That is true in politics and in business, in our civic life and our private life. It is true for celebrities and for the common person. It is true in America and abroad.\n\nThe work of leading certainly has its headaches. It minimally requires stepping out of our comfort zone, asserting our point of view, and risking rejection or failure, which not everyone is equipped or ready to do. It requires accepting more accountability — and, when things go wrong, more blame — for events that can be largely beyond our control. It requires more self-confidence and more self-discipline than many of us can muster, and it requires offering ourselves as a model for others. It doesn’t ask for perfection, but it does ask for our best. Indeed, when a supposed leader makes it look too easy, he’s likely operating only on a superficial level. Whole leadership involves exploration and change, outside and in, so it is inherently discomfiting for leader and the led alike.\n\nIt’s difficult, too. It requires strategically thinking things through two or three moves ahead, like a grandmaster in chess or a guru in game theory. It requires uncommon skills, uncommon intuition, uncommon judgment, uncommon initiative, and an uncommon work ethic. Frankly, it’s a lot easier to do something else or nothing at all. It’s easier still to assume competence in leadership that you actually lack and then not even bother to fill in the gaps, because you don’t know what you don’t know, and, more problematically, you don’t even know that you don’t know it. When I think of the worst leaders I have known or observed, they seem to have that in common: They don’t even realize that they know so little about real leadership, and they are exasperatingly incurious about it.\n\nSuccessful leaders, those who bring about great change through and for people, and who change themselves in the process, somehow figured it out for themselves along the way. They have proven themselves up to the challenge. They have what the French call je ne sais quoi, the ineffable something that others lack. But make no mistake: They were not born with whatever it is. They may have stumbled onto a golden opportunity at a tender age, as I myself did. Perhaps they derived a few key insights from their own experience or observation. Perhaps they had an uncanny sixth sense, or perhaps they had the good fortune of a valued mentor or tutor — a parent or sibling, or a coach or teacher — someone who taught them something important about human relationships and social dynamics, about taking responsibility and seizing opportunity, and about the work that people can do when they come together with a compelling motivation and a clarity of purpose, the necessary resources and tools, and a path forward.\n\nThat’s a lot of uncertainty for such an important force in self-governing societies and growth-oriented businesses, along with any number of other spheres of life. All that uncertainty renders leadership — and the big changes that it can bring about — a roll of the dice. It becomes an accident of time and place, not the intentional result of learning for ourselves and investing in the growth and development of the next generation of potential leaders. So when times do call for change, we may or may not have a backbench of wise, capable leadership that we will need to meet a looming challenge. We certainly cannot be sure of it.\n\nA few minutes at your computer can produce reams of survey data to show that, now more than ever in our shared experience, people have misgivings about the state of leadership and, more broadly, about withering social trust throughout society. They frequently use the word crisis to describe both. You’ll quickly learn that, in their judgment, too many leaders in business, government, and other aspects of life are not measuring up and are not trustworthy. The fundamental reason is plain: The leaders are seen as either (a) intent on doing harm or (b) oblivious to doing good, as perceived by ordinary people, or (c) they intend to do good but are unable to. Thus, people intuitively appreciate what we have already observed: that leadership is a matter of both intent and ability, that successful leadership must be both honorable and effective, both noble and competent. Altogether too much leadership is one but not the other — or it is neither, just plain awful.\n\nOf course, anyone’s judgment on these matters is their own. What is honorable and effective to one person isn’t necessarily honorable and effective to another. That has rarely been truer than it is today, two decades and change into the twenty-first century. American society is riven by political extremes, by cultural schisms, and by generational, socioeconomic, and geopolitical divides. In politics alone, we seem not to have mere differences of opinion anymore, but a profound divergence in core values, fundamental beliefs, and rigor of thinking. Even our collective grip on truth seems weak, as conspiracy theories abound, conjecture masquerades as fact, and the denial of observable and verifiable reality invades the public square of our times: social media.\n\n* * *\n\nMy indictment of so much casual understanding of leadership and of what passes for leadership today is not to suggest that anyone in charge of anything is an incompetent fool or a malevolent tyrant — even if, on a bad hair day, it can seem like it. The truth is that many leaders are quite capable and fair. A few are bold and imaginative. Others are good and decent women and men who are trying their best against long odds.\n\nBut their best, well-intended efforts face huge, unseen, and under-appreciated hurdles in the twenty-first century: stunted and self-limiting assumptions about leaders and followers; confusion over the real meaning and work of leadership (and management); a heedless neglect of noble purpose, cultural context, emotional maturity, selfless service, and soulful reflection; and, all too often, the absence of big thinking, big aspiration, and big ambition to start. Together, they render the work of leadership all but Sisyphean. It’s almost a surprise when it actually works.\n\nIt hasn’t always been that way. Americans who grew up with their own origin story need no reminder of the fact that, in the 1770s, many of our forebearers were extraordinary and exceptional leaders. They were all crowded together in a narrow strip of land, perhaps twelve hundred miles long and one hundred miles inland from the Atlantic coast, and far across an ocean from what they regarded as civilization: London and Paris and Amsterdam. Even today, two hundred fifty years later, we can easily rattle off their names, one of whom has a long-running Broadway musical in his honor, and many of whom have new biographies published in the last twenty or thirty years. They knew something about leadership that so many of our contemporary leaders — and I use the word advisedly — seem to have forgotten if they ever knew it. Our founders were all concerned with, and dedicated to, creating something bigger than themselves, something that would embody noble principles and stand the test of time, something that represented both structural and cultural change. Their debates were substantive and philosophical, not petty and partisan. Though woefully imperfect, theirs was leadership writ large, and we have enjoyed its fruits for more than two centuries. Think about that.\n\nToday, in lieu of large or robust leadership, what we see all too often are attempts to leverage a position or power of some sort to get people to do something. (There’s that small, crude, and obnoxious definition again.) Their agenda is usually personal or proprietary, often even petty. The means are typically threatening, implicitly or explicitly, and they are often demeaning. People go along with it because they see no practical alternative. But they certainly don’t feel good about it. Far from vocally engaged, they are quietly disengaged. That is because true leadership is both affirming and affirmative, and if their experience is neither affirming nor affirmative, people will be inclined to check out — first emotionally, then cognitively, and finally physically.\n\nWe also see that few leaders are willing and able to create the cohesive culture of engagement necessary to take on great challenges. Many don’t even try, or they reach out only to people like themselves. (It’s so much easier for them to dismiss their opponents, those dunderheads, as unrealistic converts anyway.) Others just muddle through. In business, they too often fall back on the tasks of administration, on restructuring and retrenchment, on a single-minded focus on profit (aka shareholder value), on excessive controls over intellectual property, on lawyered policies and fine-print terms that take customers and other stakeholders for granted, and on me-first trick-or-treats of any sort. In politics and government, they resort to hyper-partisan tweets, to the addiction to gerrymandering, to goose-and-gander posturing, to the bundling of financial contributions, to parliamentary gambits, to intimidation of their own partisans, to grievance and grandstanding, and of course to the proverbial back room.\n\nThe frustration spills over. As a society, we are frayed at the edges. People have little to rally around, little to strive for together. For many of them, day-to-day life makes them feel as though they are slipping behind, no longer making the progress their parents and grandparents made, no longer optimistic their kids will have it easier than they did, and no longer confident that such building blocks of society as civility, integrity, justice, education, respect, decency, responsibility, and opportunity even matter anymore. On social media we see one aggressive troll after another, and on cable TV one loud, self-important know-it-all after another. The only thing that seems to matter anymore is the shouting and — figuratively speaking only until it isn’t — the shooting.\n\nUnless we do something to change this situation, it will far outlast the politicians, the cable-television pundits, and the modern-day robber barons who have sown the seeds of it, and generations to come will profoundly regret it. As long as leadership is something less than what it can be, people will be hard-pressed to join together to meet their overriding needs of today, and the next big opportunity of tomorrow will always loom impossibly daunting and therefore out of reach for a thousand little reasons. Its final legacy is cynicism, an acid rain of disappointment and despair that eats away at the fabric of democracy, enterprise, community, even our humanity, and which may be our last undoing.\n\nWe can do better. We must do better. I have some ideas as to just how we can, and I share them in the pages to come.\n\nPraxis\n\nHere are some specific questions you can think about to understand leadership more clearly, reflect on it more deeply, and ultimately lead more productively in the twenty-first century:\n\n• Recall some situations you have experienced in which real leadership has made a difference. What did the leadership look like? How did people feel about it? What did it accomplish?\n\n• We appeal for a deep conversation about leadership, and we pose these questions as prompts: What have we come to expect of it? What should we expect of it? What can we reasonably ask of it? What norms should we demand that it respect? How can we challenge it to be more, do more, offer more? And their other side: What does real leadership demand of us, as leaders? How would you answer these questions? How do you think your colleagues and friends would?\n\n• Whom do you currently regard as real leaders? Why? Whom do your colleagues and friends? Why? What differences do you see?\n\n• What do you see as the particular obstacles and the particular leverage for leadership today?\n\n• We list the following as a statement of minimally acceptable standards for leadership: simple respect for people; a sense of common decency; straightforward honesty and the recognition of empirical reality; thoughtful preparation and policy; a large embrace of community and a commitment to bringing people together in a transcendent common cause; the affirmation of people regardless of irrelevant criteria; emotional stability and maturity; the wisdom and humility of one’s years; continuous learning and growth; the recognition of duty and obligation; reasoned and rational advocacy; service to others before oneself; appealing to “the better angels of our nature,” as Lincoln put it; and clear, credible, coherent, and cogent communication. What would you add or subtract from this list?\n\n• How does your own leadership communication compare with that of people you regard as leaders in your community, workplace, school, house of worship, political party, or any other venue where you see leadership?\n\n[end of chapter 1]\n\nChapter 2\n\nMoving from Position to Purpose\n\nRediscovering the Potential of Large Leadership\n\nThere’s a good case to be made for banning the sports metaphor once and for all, but if that ever happens Vince Lombardi and John Wooden, two of the winningest coaches ever, should get their own grandfather clause. These two men had something in common besides gilded trophy cases. They both liked to begin with the basics, and they both liked to think big. Let’s do the same. We’ll begin at the beginning, with the basics, and we will go deep.\n\nWooden, who coached the UCLA men’s basketball team to ten championships (including seven in a row) during his storied career, began each basketball season by teaching his players how to — wait for it — lace up and knot their basketball shoes. As it turns out, there are dozens of ways to tie your shoes, and most of them are unhelpful to competing in a fast-paced game. Wooden explained all that and then insisted that players tie their laces his way, so that their shoes were neither too tight nor too loose and the players could run faster and jump higher than their opponents, especially in the final minutes of a hard-fought game.\n\nLombardi, too. He took a losing, woebegone professional football team and, with the same roster of players and within a couple of years, began winning championships. It was no fluke; his small-town Green Bay Packers went on to win five National Football League championships in seven years, including the legendary Ice Bowl and the first two Super Bowls. At the beginning of each season, Lombardi took a basketball — yes, a basketball — and bounced it up and down before his assembled players. After each bounce, as he helpfully pointed out, the ball came right back to his hands. Then he set the basketball aside and picked up a couple of footballs and dropped them to the floor on their point, only to watch them squirrel away this way or that, before explaining the obvious for dramatic effect and finally intoning: “Gentlemen, do not drop the football.”\n\nLike tying your shoes and bouncing a ball, the basics are a good place for us to start. I prefer to think of it not so much as going back to the basics but as moving forward with the basics, so that each of us is working with the same set of definitions and expectations. Only then can we cut through the muck of so much stolid misunderstanding on leadership. To do that, we introduce the five empirical perspectives on leadership. We call them the Five Lenses.\n\nFive Lenses on Leadership\n\nBy empirical perspectives, or lenses, we have in mind the distinct ways of looking at something abstract — an angle or a sightline with implicit assumptions, mainly as to what is most important or what provides the driving force. When it comes to leadership, there’s a quintet of them, each taking its label from its dominant perspective, and coincidentally all beginning with P: the Position lens, the Power lens, the Persona lens, the Platform lens, and the Purpose lens. They overlap a little conceptually and practically, which is to say you can view a particular example through two or more lenses, but they are sufficiently distinct to warrant individual analysis.\n\n[Insert artwork of eyeglasses with five lenses. Each lens has one word on it: Position, Power, Persona, Platform, or Purpose. No caption.]\n\nAll five lenses are valid and useful, depending on the circumstance, though you will find that the fifth and last one, the Purpose lens, is the most conducive to large leadership in a broad array of contexts. It’s also the most accessible to anyone, regardless of circumstances and roles. More importantly, you’ll see just how much impact these mental models have on our thinking. Few people realize it, but our understanding of leadership changes quite a bit depending on which lens we’re using, simply because we’re looking at it differently. You just don’t want to find yourself imprisoned by only one, such that you cannot use the others — especially the fifth and last one. Let’s look at each of them.\n\nThe Position Lens (or, Leadership on a Pedestal)\n\nThis lens deserves top billing. It is by far the most common. Everyone relies on the Position lens frequently, so much that many of us are hamstrung into thinking of leadership strictly as a matter of position. Viewing leadership as a high position — as, for example, the C-suite and board of directors of Apple, or the mayor and councilors of Paris, or the pope and the College of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church — you are working on the assumption that leadership is the responsibility and opportunity of those in senior administrative authority only, that it is essentially a matter of status and of executive roles.\n\n[Insert half-size artwork of eyeglasses with five lenses. Art is flush right; the text wraps around to the left. Four of the lenses are shaded and without labels. One lens (the far left) is clear and labeled Position. No caption.]\n\nThis perspective is common, even dominant, in Western society. Major publications like the Harvard Business Review and the Wall Street Journal routinely use the word leadership as a synonym for the senior management of a business and for high-level public or prominent officials. You can argue that this thinking is built into our common DNA, for its origins date back to millennia of nomadic, embattled tribes and their chieftains. Tribes that established some sort of hierarchy of authority likely survived a little longer, because they had the cohesion of command and an organization that could assign roles and responsibilities and hold people accountable. By surviving a little longer, they had more offspring. We are their descendants, and we are carrying their social DNA.\n\nGiven its long history and predominant use, the Position perspective clearly has something to be said for it. It is a nod to the familiar, lofty expectations that people usually attach to senior positions. We naturally expect whoever is in charge to speak for an organization. So without a second thought we talk about “the leaders of XYZ Company” or “the leadership of ABC Association” almost as if the positional leadership is the organization and vice versa.\n\nThe trouble is that it begs a big question as to whether the persons so labeled are in fact capable of leading anything or anyone anywhere. All too often, the supposed leadership at the top actually consists of one or more authority figures who regard themselves as leaders because of their high position and lofty title but who actually know scarcely anything about the real work of leading change and are not much inclined either to learn or actually do the work that real leadership requires. They may be assigning people to tasks, or approving a policy or a reorganization, or transferring people, or even selling the whole enterprise to a competitor — but are they truly leading people through a challenging situation, through a thicket of change? Not typically. Usually, they’re just running things. While people commonly look to high-level positions for their leadership, they often find leaders in position only. I joke that some senior LIPOs couldn’t lead a fifth-grade soccer team to the ice-cream parlor after a hot summer game, and that is not far from the truth.\n\nBy the hierarchical test, no one is a leader until someone in official authority declares it to be. The opposite is closer to reality, for the leaders who have truly changed the world were commonly not designated as a leader by anyone else. They are the likes of Mandela and Gandhi, Jesus and Mohammed, Tubman and Friedan, King and Walesa — and many others like them. I wince when I hear young managers or grad students say they look forward to becoming a leader one day. They need not wait! Real leadership is what leaders do, not what their title or job description is. Anyone with a passion can do it, if some better than others.\n\nThat alone explains why so much leadership fails. You cannot expect a turtle to jump over a rock, but we routinely expect big things from anyone appointed to or elected to a high-level office, regardless of their individual capacity for carrying on the actual work of leadership. If the newly anointed leader relies only on instinct, or, worse, assumes he knows something about leadership that he actually doesn’t, nothing much will happen, and the people who were expecting great things will naturally be either disappointed or deluded. Two factors account for it.\n\nFirst, viewing leadership as a position highlights the scepter and sable mantle of leadership but glosses over the hard work that it requires. We’ll explore the roll-up-your-sleeves work in some detail, but for now just remember that leadership is not a static thing, and that no one can idly or passively exercise leadership. That beautiful black leather swivel chair is not a throne, and anyone who thinks it is will soon find out otherwise. The truly important black leather is the soles of your shoes.\n\nSecond, as the busy executive peers out from behind a grand desk, he likely feels a natural tendency to use the levers of institutional control as extensions of his will: to merge those departments, to fire that manager, to build the new office in Centerville. Although that can yield satisfactory short-term results, the leader’s long-term impact is achievable only through a vibrant, healthy relationship with legions of followers and a culture that enables and encourages people to act nobly in concert with strategic imperatives. That takes work, and it isn’t necessarily the kind of work that the new leader is accustomed to doing or even wants to do. It’s easier to lean back, put your feet up, admire the new digs, and tell people what"
