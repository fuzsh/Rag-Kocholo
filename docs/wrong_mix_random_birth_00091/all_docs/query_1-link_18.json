This edition celebrates artists whose works provide an escape from the mundane, offering glimpses into serene and imaginative realms. Featured artists Laurie Tousignant, Blake, Ethemos, Kiuyan Ran, Milica Mastelica, Philip Sue, and Sandeep Soni transform the canvas into portals of tranquility and wonder.\r\n\r\nWe present an exclusive interview with Alymamah Rashed, an artist who gracefully navigates the interplay between identity, nature, and cultural heritage. Rashed discusses her exploration of intrinsic and extrinsic escapes, not as departures but as entryways to new perspectives. Her works, steeped in personal history and regional folklore, invite viewers on journeys of discovery, fostering a universal sense of connection through global exhibitions and cross-cultural dialogues. This interview delves into her creative process, the impact of her work on diverse audiences, and her vision for nurturing artistic growth.\r\n\r\nOur editorials explore art as a sanctuary, highlighting the liberating power of creative escape in &quot;Art as Sanctuary: The Liberating Power of Creative Escape.&quot; Additionally, &quot;Seeking Refuge: How Artists Are Fleeing to Cara to Protect Their Work from AI Exploitation&quot; addresses the growing concern of AI scraping and the shift to alternative platforms like Cara for safeguarding artistic integrity.\r\n\r\nImmerse yourself in &quot;The Escape Edition&quot; and let the boundless creativity within these pages inspire and rejuvenate your spirit. Happy reading!",
