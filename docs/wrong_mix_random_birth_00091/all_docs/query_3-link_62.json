In presenting the following material on ALBArIA, three principal objectives were kept in mind; (1) to give the reader a simple and concise account of the historical background; (2) to present a cross- sectional analysis of the Communist Party governmental pattern; and (3) to submit added and timely information to those groups primarily interested in this field. In various instances, extracts were made from filed reports since this information appeared beet suited to illustrate particular points throughout the survey. Although far from presenting a comprehensive summation of the subject, the practical utility of this report it.. in the coverage of the most important aspects of modern, ALUM, An effort has been made to demonstrate the developMent of =ANIL by the USSR for political and military reasons. Inasmuch as the Soviet foreign policy has incorporated ALBANIA for the ultimate purpose of providing the USSR with an outlet to the Mediterranean, it is reason- able to assume that eventually Yugoslav Macedonia will have to be sacri- ficed to realize this undertaking. In view of the intornational sit- uation today, and of the aggressive attitude assumed by the UN., it may be some time before this Russian ambition in the Balkans can achieve fruition. The possibility that YUGOSLAV/A will do an about face and return to the Comirform fold cannot be discounted. ALBAN/Ms importance stems from the geographical factor rather than any national accomplishments or contributions. Ru strategic imp- ortance weighs heavily in the balance of power in the Ueditarransan and the Near Best.

Surly Histori STRLZO, the Roman historian, mentioned that the Albanians as a people settled in the trans-Caucasus flatland in the era before Christ. The Romano had established contact with these people during the century preceLng the birth of Christ. The Albanians, meanwhile, had obtained. possession of the fertile valley of the Cyrus niver (at present known as the Kura, in Amertaijan). By means of a militant agreement concluded with the Albaniene, the Boman. used. Albanian con- tingents during their were against MiTHR/DOUS, King of POMO. According to STRABO, at that time the Albanians were al- ready an important ethnic group, since they were able to form an army of approximately 80,000 men. An excellent cavalry formed the strongest component of this army. The people lived dispersed throughout the Cyrus River Valley, and also occupied territory in sections of the mountains north of the river. Various tribes had. a similar language. but there were considerable differences in dialects. These tribes were ruled by chieftane whom 8TRABO called ',kings\", however, it is difficult to empire this term with its contemporary meaning. The Albanians were heathens, like the nomadic peoples who invaded their territory, and they differed from these nomads by race rather than language. Mb historic documents remain from that time, therefore, it cannot be determine& at exactly what period Albanian de- fense of taipir.on country became possible. /t is certain, however, that pressure from the souiranreast became so strong that further defense of their territory could not be carried on by the Albanians. In conjunction with other racial groups from the last, the Albanians began to migrate toward the Mediterranean area. By one route they travelled across Asia Minor (0apadocia. Galatea, etc.) and the San of Marmara, reaching Tracia (Thrace), south of the Rhodope Mountains: and by another route the Albanians crossed the Aegean Islands and reecho. ed luboea, Attica, and. Bootie. Vntil this day, strong Albanian racial characteristics are perfectly preserved in the irlande which are now part of MEM However, the northern wing of this migration, not hay- ing found conditions suitable in Tracia, first turned to the north to- ward. Macedonia where part of this original group has remained to the present time. The remainder of the group gradually spread until later it had reached the coasts of the Ionic and Adriatic Seas. The unsuit- able conditions pointed out above concerned tbe inadertibility of these people in cultural and. social fields rather than in any dislike of the climate or environment.

Actually, it cannot be stated with certainty that these are ethnic Greeks, but the cultural contacts these people have had during the last ten centuries with purely Greek elements have left their mark, since there is a great resemblance to the Hellenic civilization. The Orthodox religion has also exercised a profound influence, while the people in SOM8 of the valleys have aisumed the Greek language as their own.

The Greeks claimed that there were many people living in these areas Who were of Greek nationality or of the Orthodox religion. The Balkan War presented a great &Inger, since the Albanians resented the treatment given them by the Turks, and were still per- turbed by the memories of 'the acts committed by the Turkish expedition-. ary forces under Sheiket PASBA and Dervish PASHA. Simultaneoasly, the collapse of the Ottoman Zmeire would. cause ALBArIA torn to pieces.

Sociological Survaz As mentioned in the preceding section, the Albanians have preserved almost intact certain social institutions which have be- come quite uncommon and virtually non-existent in other Btropean countries. 'While fighting for their independence. the Albanians naintained themselves in their inaccessible mountains. There they preserved certain traditions and characterisitics which may be Prim.? itive and antahronistic: institutions which might bo unacceptable in other countries: but which prove that the Albanians have remained genuine and that their race has remained pure. It is well known that the family is the basis of society. and When the family ceases to exist, the nation itself is subject to collapse. In the sopcific instance of AZMANIL, which was so hard pressed /tun all sides, the state had to retreat leaving the defense of individuals to small, collective groups. Althowill in feudal form, which corresponded to the ttme, these groups mannged to solve the problem by retreating into the mountains, organizine Small groups, and subjecting them to a severe moral and military discipline. The aim of this policy was to protect the primitive cell, the family. /f the family had been allowed ,o disintegrate and disappear, the Albanians as a nation would be nonmexistent to- day. For example, the Btruseans disappeared leaving no doscondants, only a few remnants and monuments of their civilisation. Tho Berlin Treaty appeared to have boon largely affected br the general belief that the disnito4ration of ALBULA was already a completed fact, and that a division of her torritaTios eould_be made without causing any difficulties% However, as events proved, just the opposite transpired. Mainly, this was due to the extra:aft:miry vitality of the Albanians, who, while giving ground to the secular rale progressing in the valleys, preserved intact their ethnics struetureittto 04- un- Apprsaymj IterM en ere 0 VTIL Approved For Release 2004/02/19 : CIA-RDP83-00415R006100200002-9 SECRET A Survey of (contid) pago 12 rosistanco, which corresponded to 65 tribos. At present, the most imp. portant of those are; the Mati (25,000), and tho Lardita (18,000). Tribos are ruled by an \"assombly of fathers\" (family chiefs) in which a particularly fow chiefs who merit tho honor, hold places of predominance. /n tho areas under Moslom influence, tho chiefs are called \"Bey\" or \"Beg\", while the foremost carry the titlo of \"Bajraktar\". These titles area carryover from tho days of SONlaRBEG, when the titled wore called \"Ddkos\",\"Counts\", and. \"Captains\". \"Bajraktar\" be- ',came a hereditary title, and is still in uso today in central and north,. ern ALBANIA. The authority of the chioftan, or Bajraktar, has remained un- touched in tho northern areas, particularly among the Catholics, in spite of tho fact that the Communists have tried to diminish or comp. pletely abolish their personal and historic prestigo. However, there is reason to believe that rosistanco to tho authorities today has not yet cease& in the northern mountain areas, sinco the government has not as yet been able to ponotrato tho territory. /t cannot be deter.- mined as to how popular a successful resistance will be, since tho Com. mumist regime uses deception to a great extent, which is a weapon never employed against these people, oven by tho most violent of oppressors. Tho \"Canon of the Mountain\" (Kanuni i Leko DMAGIIIVIT) which was coded during the 12th Century by an obscure membor of tho great family of the DUKAWITI, and widely spread during tho timo of salaam by an- other member of this family, Lek (Alexander) =AMY!, constitutes tho codification of the mores. Daring that period, all ALBArIA was undor the influence of the law. It has been altered slightly by Turkish and. Slav influancos, but basically remains the same. The basis of tho Kanunl i /Joke DUKAGJINIT is tho law of \"Blood Revengo\", which imposes upon tho next of kin of an assassinated person, a ndutyw or \"task of honor\" to redeem to dead relative by killing the assassin, or ono of his family who is \"ablo to carry arms\". Fuluded from this law of revenge are women, children, and priests, sinew they are considered unable to carry arms. Tho redemption of a human life by payment of a sum of money is considered unmanly and is allowed only in unusual circumstances, and then only by tribes considered as unimport- ant. Tho Luria and Mati Tribes oxcludo this practice altogether. al- though they maintain the institution of \"spontaneous pardon\". This allows blood revenge to raapended by mutual accord, but not abandoned. It may be suapendod in every instance whereby the assassin is under tho protection of \"hospitality\", which is a sacred institution in ALEArIA. Hospitality begins the moment the \"Family Chief\" allows a guest to pass the threthhold of his home. The guest, no matter who he is, is given all possible caro and attention, moro so if ho is a strong.. cr. A ny escorts of the guest are also immuno from twang? or inhospit- able treatment.

It is an unwritten law which provides authprization for a woman to seek hos- pitality in any village through Which she may be passing, and it is the duty of all concerned to accept her and give her the utmost at- tention and care. Based upon the Salm& i /eke DUKAWIN/T is another important institution, that of the oath given in the form of a word of honor. It is known as the news (noses moans word). By taking it, one assumes the duty to protect and to keep in safe custody a person, to defend a locality, or to fight in the national interest. To break onols whose' would expose the offender to the unlimited contempt of his fellowmen. The judges or enforcers of such laws as those were the chieftains, to whom the collectives owed blind obedience, particularly in the case of a call to arms. Such tradition of command existed until the arrival of the Columnists, although the authority of the individual Boys had previously deagenerated somewhat since many of them had adopted the Western wo.7 of life, especially after 1913. In wanting to give their eons a more cultured background plum a formal education, they were sent to various European capitols. There tho sons came into contact with mentalities quite different from those they were familiar with, and re- turned home with many new ideas. King TOGU was a prime example of a dual education. Ho had spent some time as a youth at the Court of the Sultan in _Ltir_mktConstar , and later was attached to the Court of 20110er CARL in Vienna, thus providing him with the necessary ezpifirionca to be- come a ruler. He had learned both Oriontal and Occidental principles of government and montalitios. It may be safely assumed that none of the Communist social in- stitutions could penetrate the areas occupied by the Clamonti, &strati, Kraisniqi. HUba, Bityci, DUkagjini, Ktumal Luma. and. Mirditi tribes. Those tribes of northern ALBANIA, pressed between TIT on the north and the Tirano government on the south, find themselves in an identical situation as prevailed &Snag medieval times. Their resist- ance, in addition to purely physical efforts, is maintained by a shrewd political sensibility, Which is a result from the times when those tribes wore forced to employ to the best of their knowledge, a sense of polit- ical and nilitary intelligence in order to centinue their defenses. In approaching thu center of ALBANIA, the predominance of ruse over physical violence and overt defense becomes more noticeable. This in particular reference to the tribes of Malakastro and Musacis. This is trao of the Malakastro tribe more so because of their poverty 'din& fortes them to bow to therCommunist authority in order to physically survive.

Geography (Soo Exhibits V/I, VIII, IX, 14 XI, XII, & XIII) ALBA= is nn oxtremoly mountainous country, averaging more than 3,000 foot above Ben level. Tho Dinaric Alps in the north and northeast, and the Pinch's Mountains in tho south and southeast form the walls of a huge amphitheater which encloso a marshy plain along tho Adriatic Sea. Sevoral rivers cross the narrow coastal plaint flowing rapidly because of their relatively short courses, sinco they avorago 130 kilometers in length in their stoop doscont from tho mount.. ans. Tho most Important rivers aro; tho Bojana (tho only navigable river in the country), the %bite Drin; the Black Twin; the Mati; tho Xrsoni; the Vojusa; and tho Shkumbin. The last named river separates ALBANIA into two separate regions, with the Ghegs living in the north, and the Tbsks in the south. There are small, fortilo wallop and bas- ins, and toward, the hinterland, there are wide valley' and plateaus 'which contain the centers of population. The Albanian climate is Mediterranean; summers are hot and dry, and winters are moderate. Coast- al tomperatures are higher than those inland. There are boeoh, pine, and fir in the highlands, and large areas of oak, valnut, chestnut, and elm in tho coastal plains. Mineral resources, although relatively unexploited, are boliev- ed to be considerable, and include aluminum, petroleum, lignite, iron, bitumen, asphalt, gypsum. and copper. Only a small part of the inter. ior is arabic, although nearly the entire population is engaged in a combination of farming and stock raising. Chief crops are; corn, rye, wheat, barloy, tobacco, oats, spelt, olives, and citeas_fruit. PART II Political 4. Throe events have occurred Which, although external to exi. ternal to A/BLE/A, are likely to have an important influence on her internal situation. Diplomatic relations have boon rom,opened with ITALY; the Greek Weals have announced that for the present they have called off military operations; and MYGOSLATIA has formally denounced her treaty of friendship with aum. In more fortunate countries, the welfare of the people depends mainly upon tho effectiveness of tho government's internal policy and administration. In ALBArIA, to a quite unusual extent, the life of the poople, oven dotal to tho adequacy or inadequacy of their rations, is affoctod by the actions of neighboring countries, by their relations with her, with each other, and with the Groat Powers. Wer since tho final departure lf the Turks in 1913, ALBANIA has required the expend. ituro or investment of foreign money to keep her tamodiately supplied with consumer goods, and to carry through tho lonsAorm dovolopment of her resources which may one day make her economically independent.

Financial support was necessary for the reconstruction of the country. YUGOSLAV/A and OBEE0.1-=re :In ao liosition to grant tho funds needed by ALBANIA. Therefore, King ZOO again turned to ITALY. In 1925 SVIEL (Societe Sviluppo /Conon/co ALBANIA, Association for the Zconomie Development of ALBANIA) granted a credit of 243 million lire to be re- imbursed over a 40 year period. In 1931, although Malin, had not paid the interest on the first loan, ITALY granted another loan of 100 mill. ion lire under the co tion that ITALY be permitted to supervise the finances of ALBANIA.. It was then established that this new loan should be gradually settled bach time the balance of the Albanian government exceeded 50 million lire. The Italian request sounded like an insult to King ZOG, who then endeavored to find now markets, The Italian government then wasted no time about the matter and pronptly dispatch.. ?\"be r9 navy sh1bsIMEMPINF0.931). Eirt6 II,I'T WA4 :44en advised to sfl.. tie the matter in a 71337ful manner. It is quite possible the Italian MOW was initiated by the fear that King Zog night negotiate a secret agreement with YUGOSLAVIA. Loyal pelitical and economic relations bo- A/BArIA and ITALY wore virtually ended, and there began an atmosphere of ',nerves\" until April 1939. (-1.,_t was then that tho moment of groat events began, and ITALY thought ft-necessary to invade ALBANIA. Piton 7 to 17 April 1939, Italian troops landed in Aussu while ZOGU fled to OBIEGE, taking with him the national treasury. YUGOSLAVIA remained silent about the proceedings mainly because of the agreement signed earlier in the year between MUSSOLINI and the Yugoslav Primo kinisfer Milan STOJAIENOVIC. Tho only resistance to tho Italian invasion was conducted by Alas run, who led the Albanians in a brier novanont by utilising the troops stationed at Durres and Vim). ITALY soon consolidated her position in the country. It should bo mentioned that the Italian act- ion has boon preceded by a (systematic preparation, Francisco JACONGUI, Italian Ambassador to ALBANIA, very efficiently handled the diplomatic angles. He secretly contacted antis-ZOGU elements who agreed to coll.. aborato with him, blinded by his promises (which, incidentally, were never kept), of sharing in the government.
