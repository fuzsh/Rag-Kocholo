        "text": "Introduction to a special issue of Grey Room on \"Art Beyond Copyright.\" We conceived of this issue, “Art beyond Copyright,” nearly two years ago. Our position was and remains, first, that copyright law stands in direct opposition to art historians and is irrelevant to the vast multitude of practicing artists; and, second, that the myopic focus on copyright has blinded attention to conceptually and his- torically distinct facets of the law that inflect art practice, art history, and art law. The inadequacy of copyright and the imperative to seek out alternatives for art and law are the focus of this special issue of Grey Room.\n\nWhat is the impact of copyright (and neighbouring rights) on art — on the conditions for artistic production as well as on other art-related practices in modern societies like trading, conserving, exhibiting, performing, reproducing and distributing works of art or reproductions thereof in various media? And what is the particular relevance of art (and of aesthetic concepts, or theories of art) for copyright? Why should the dogmatics of copyright be concerned with aesthetics at all, and what function do aesthetic concepts fulfil in the conceptual structure of copyright and in the context of its legitimization?\n\n[Peer-reviewed article by two scientific committee members of the magazine] The historical approach to democratic ideals is based on the relationship between art, technique, and industry in its creative conception and the cultural influences of its practice in the process of economic, social, and political development. However, in order to better understand this relationship, this article seeks to understand the place of art and communication in the origins of Western knowledge through a brief retrospective of the evolution of verbal and visual languages. Through this panorama, essential to the meaning of art and communication, the article presents an analysis that considers the historical significance of art publications in the process of democratization, freedom of expression, the press, and art from the Renaissance to modern times, while focusing mainly upon the period from the 20th century to the present day. The purpose of technique in its global dimension is fundamental to human existence. Such technical transformations are the consequences of social achievements in the search for conquests and freedoms. However, the quest for freedom is paradoxical. Consequently, through a theoretical foundation in art, culture, and technological evolution, the article seeks to understand the development of art publications better, using examples of significant publications in the history of Western culture. On the one hand, the creative practices considering the resources and socio-cultural stimuli from Johannes Gutenberg’s work with the printing press to the 20th century and the transition to the 21st century are observed. On the other hand, within this article, this publication practice is also related to the leading art magazines, and aesthetic and social reflections upon the cultural context in Europe and today’s globalized world.

The Code describes common situations in which materials under copyright can be used in these professional areas. Bring your lunch and learn more about the basic tenets of the code and its application. This will be of particular interest to art and architectural historians, artists, designers, curators, museum directors, educators, rights and reproduction officers, and editors at scholarly publishers and journals."
