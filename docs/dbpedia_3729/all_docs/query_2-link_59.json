        "text": "BEST COVID-19 BOUNCEBACK – AWARDS\n\nAutovia Limited – Historic Motoring Awards\n\nThe Historic Motoring Awards, presented by Octane Magazine had a record breaking year in 2019. More sponsors, more attendees and more awards than ever before. In 2020, the brand embraced the virtual format which was encouragingly supported by sponsors and viewers alike. However, a return to a live event in 2021, hosted at the iconic Rosewood Hotel, saw the highs of 2019 success replicated, providing the perfect springboard for 2022 and beyond.\n\nBeyond Media Services and Revolution Events – Security & Fire Excellence Awards 2021\n\nFor 2021, we needed to encourage the return of the larger companies that had supported the Awards over the years. So, we introduced a ‘Champion of Champions’ category open to all previous winning companies from the previous 20+ years, and a ‘Lockdown Hero’ category aiming to acknowledge and reward companies that had supported the industry and performed well during the pandemic.\n\nWe built on the success of the 2019 event, and the positive feedback from the 2020 Virtual Awards, delivering high quality, interactive entertainment.\n\nTo give added weight and profile to the new ‘Champion of Champions’ and ‘Lockdown Hero’ presentations, we introduced a high profile, surprise presenter. We decided that Sir Geoff Hurst was the perfect fit!\n\nAs Sir Geoff’s ‘they think it’s all over …’ intro montage played and his name was announced, the 1,000 or so guests were silenced, standing up as one to deliver an incredible ovation, fully re-engaged and with their full attention back on the final presentations.\n\nPost the presentations, we did not expect Sir Geoff to be the first one up on stage, ‘singing’ ‘Sweet Caroline’ with our live karaoke band to a shocked but very appreciative crowd!\n\nCrain Communications – Plastics Industry Awards\n\nThe highlight of the plastics industry calendar, the Plastics Industry Awards combine business networking, entertainment and pure fun. However, with ongoing uncertainty over the future course of the pandemic, organisers adopted a new strategy for the 2021 Awards: a hybrid in person and virtual event, which received huge support from the industry.\n\nFor the first time a programme of sponsor seminars was live streamed on the Awards website the day before the ceremony.\n\nA record number of 115 entries was received and a new category – COVID-19 Business Hero – attracted a substantial number of entries from businesses who had never previously entered the awards.\n\nTable bookings for the 2021 event proved so popular that the event had to be expanded using additional space in the atrium which also sold out. It was the largest seated banqueting event The Waldorf has ever held. Meanwhile YouTube figures show there were over 100 viewers of the Livestream events.\n\nThe event generated a profit of £12,000 while a charity casino raised over £1,500 for Macmillan Cancer.\n\nShorty Awards – 13th Annual Shorty Awards\n\nThe Shorty Awards have been in operation for the last 14 years and are known as the first competition with a focus on honoring social media. Around the 13th Annual Shorty Awards, the impact of social media on culture was never more significant. We were already a year into the pandemic, and people expected an awards show to be virtual. Sentiment around Zoom burn-out was real, and so we decided to head in a different direction. We took to social media, ourselves, and made all of our “Winner Drops” announcements via Instagram using Instagram stories, feed, and live. Other aspects of our social-media-based celebration included Clubhouse chats, AR filters, LinkedIn tags, and providing our winners with social assets to encourage them to share their win.\n\nIn giving the people what they wanted, we increased our interactions on social media and reached 1.9K new followers during activation (April to early May.) People mentioned the Shortys everywhere – LinkedIn, Instagram, Stories, Twitter and Facebook. We saw more than 9K engagements with our posts prior to the ceremony, and more than 2.2M impressions during our social-first show.\n\nTaylist Media – kbbreview Retail and Design Awards 2021\n\nThe kbbreview Retail & Design Awards are our industry’s most sought-after accolades in the kitchen and bathroom sector, and celebrate the very best retailers, designers, and manufacturers.\n\nOur awards evening was held just two weeks after the government gave the green light for indoor events to take place. Therefore, this event was the first of its kind within this industry since our awards in March 2020 – all eyes were on us.\n\nFor 2021 we held our carbon-neutral awards in Liverpool at the UK’s biggest cathedral. 550 guests were wowed with a breathtaking entrance with an incredible performance from gospel touch, who sang from a suspended walkway overlooking the drinks reception. During this, a zip camera flew over the heads of guests, relaying live images of proceedings to the sponsor branded projection screen. It provided grandeur of the highest level.\n\nJoel Dommett hosted 2021’s event and Martin Kemp DJ’d our amazing afterparty.\n\nWe overcame numerous challenges due to the unprecedented circumstances with our dedication, expert planning and enthusiasm to ensure our guests could relax and enjoy themselves under the same roof for the first time in 18 months. It was our pleasure.\n\nTTG Media – The Travel Industry Awards\n\nMarch 2021, in the midst of lockdown, with large events banned and the travel industry in a state of paralysis, was an audacious time to launch a new awards programme, culminating in an event for 800 people at a stunning new venue in September. But the first Travel Industry Awards by TTG achieved this for TTG Media, uniting its industry for the first time following the pandemic, giving travel companies a new tool to help them rebuild trade and consumer trust, and exceeding all commercial targets during a devastating period.\n\nOvercoming a series of challenges – and while operating in an industry truly in the eye of the storm of the Covid crisis – this fiercely independent media business built a new platform for future growth with the event, which was hosted by Strictly stars Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly at the new Magazine London venue at North Greenwich, and opened with a video address from Sir Richard Branson arranged by headline partner Virgin Atlantic.\n\nBEST VIRTUAL OR HYBRID AWARDS EVENT\n\nEIT Community – EIT Jumpstarter\n\nEIT Jumpstarter is the EU programme that trains early innovators to turn their revolutionary ideas into business.\n\nThe programme, supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, already trained 500+ passionate innovators yearly from Central, Eastern, and Southern European countries and helped them establish influential start-ups. This is one of the most important awards for the earliest-stage innovations in the CEE region.\n\nEvery year we organise the EIT Jumpstarter Grand Final, where the best 42 teams in a total of 7 categories compete for their share of the €159.000 prize pool and access to the most extensive pan-European network of innovators. In 2021, we held a digital-only event: https://fb.watch/aGrAvN9ejO/\n\nWinners were chosen in seven categories: health, food, raw materials, energy, urban mobility, manufacturing and New European Bauhaus (focused on sustainable and inclusive living spaces). This is not only an awards-giving ceremony but the European celebration of innovations and the vibrant community of people who want to make a difference.\n\nEmap Publishing – World Architecture Festival Awards\n\nWAF 21 – Digital Edition was held on 1-3 December 21 using the Swapcard platform with 552 recorded judging presentations available, live-streamed Keynotes, networking, plus the announcement of the overall World Building of the Year Winner. Pivoting WAF 21 to digital meant that recorded finalist presentations provided valuable content which was made available for 3 months post-event. We sold access to this content to all finalists and ran a marketing campaign to drive sales. As a result, we delivered online delegate revenue, plus retained all entry revenue, and 50% of sponsorship revenue. Whilst lower revenue than the live event would have delivered, with lower costs for a virtual event we achieved the same gross profit and delegate volume as budgeted for the live event!\n\nInstitution for Engineering & Technology – E&T Innovation Awards\n\nThe IET’s E&T Innovation Awards has run for over 17yrs but was rebranded in 2021\n\nalongside our award-winning magazine, E&T, to unleash a new beginning for an old event.\n\nLimited by Covid restrictions, we chose a hybrid strategy to reach our usual 350+ person\n\nevent and reach a new global audience.\n\nThe in-person event was a VIP intimate affair for our Awards speakers, winners and Advisory Board made up of the most famous Engineering ambassadors. However the main goal was to bring it alive online.\n\nThe virtual event was akin to a TV show produced by our own IET.tv production team and our in-house event managers all streamed using the EventsAir platform. Online, 305 virtual guests tuned in from 21 countries including, Vietnam, China, Andorra and Mexico.\n\nUsing social media to allow people at home to vote for the Young Pioneer Award, we saw 5,000 votes in the build up to the live event. This idea gave everyone (virtually or in-person)\n\nan opportunity to have a say on the night. The event overall was a huge success achieving a fantastic Net Promoter Score (NPS) score of +40!\n\nProfessional Beauty Group – British Hairdressing Awards\n\nThe team involved in the British Hairdressing Awards are passionate and dedicated to it and the industry it serves – it’s an event that means so much to so many, culminating in a celebration of this incredible craft. If we had to go virtual, we had to ensure we brought the industry together to truly celebrate the craft and those working within it. We needed to ensure it was a party, a chance to network, and with the future looking bleak, a time to have some fun. Teams from across the globe joined, hosting their own online parties and watching together via Facebook Live.\n\nThe awards were simultaneously streamed to the Hopin platform where the team set up the session rooms as “tables”, allowing finalists to network prior to, and post the ceremony itself.\n\nOur studio set-up perfectly mimicked the live event and gave excellent audience engagement, with live finalist interviews, and winner reactions.\n\n27,000+ people watched live, with 2.5k positive comments being posted during the live event – a phenomenal achievement.\n\nAs the call from the studio floor came… “it’s a wrap”, there were tears of joy, relief and a huge sense of achievement\n\nSmiley Movement CIC – 5th Charity Film Awards\n\nIn 2020, Smiley Movement acquired the Charity Film Awards, hoping to take the Awards to the next level through increasing the number of views to charity films tenfold, raising the profile of charity films, and celebrating the power of filmmaking as a tool for positive change. The aim was to give the charity sector the recognition it truly deserves. The 2022 campaign was a huge success, generating an additional 3.5 million views on films, 60,000 votes, and having more than 550 guests at the ceremony – the highest ever at the Charity Film Awards. We put the Awards on a world-class stage, hosting it at the ODEON Luxe, Leicester Square – giving it the “Oscars of the charity sector” feel. We committed advertising spend to help promote every single film entry, and provided unrestricted, free promotion to charities during the nine-month campaign. Charities sent in overwhelmingly positive feedback after the ceremony, over the moon with the exposure their films had received. It really was a unique event bringing together hundreds of people from the charity sector to work together to make our world a better place.\n\nThe Academy of International Extended Reality – The 5th International VR Awards\n\nThe VR Awards is at the center of recognition and celebration of outstanding achievement in Virtual Reality (VR). The ceremony gathers the world’s most influential names in immersive technology, to celebrate the biggest projects that redefined the way we live.\n\nThe VR Awards celebrated its 5th anniversary in 2021. And like its ground-breaking predecessor the 5th International VR Awards ceremony was experienced through the Metaverse, created in AltspaceVR, and allowed millions of people to join the 5th International VR Awards ceremony from a browser, phone, and VR headsets.\n\nAttendees gather in a gold-plated luxurious virtual lobby after entering their special access code in AltspaceVR’s dashboard, and as a group experience, each attendee is then transported into 5 different worlds representing each year of the VR Awards leading up to the fifth and final red carpet that leads to the ceremony where the VR Awards winners are announced much like a real-life award ceremony.\n\nWilmington Events, EMEA – HSJ Awards 2020\n\nThe HSJ Awards celebrate healthcare service excellence, sharing best practice, driving innovation, and helping improve patient outcomes in UK healthcare sector. The event has been delivered for 39 years in November as an in-person awards.\n\nAs our NHS audience were instrumental to the pandemic response, each successive wave of covid-19 impacted our awards strategy in delivering a programme befitting their achievements. By November 2020, after a postponement of the live event to March 2021, the team realised that the 40th anniversary would need to be pivoted to virtual. They delivered a TV quality production with celebrity guests and senior leaders taking the time to thank the NHS. A celebration of the teams and individuals’ projects, at a time when the health sector was experiencing their toughest year in recent history.\n\nOver 2,500 people watched the virtual event live, which trended on Twitter and feedback was overwhelmingly positive. The HSJ Awards team were proud to have been able to deliver such a rewarding, meaningful and impactful virtual event and were able to pay tribute to their audience in an appropriate and tasteful way.\n\nBEST LONGSTANDING AWARDS EVENT\n\nCrain Communications – Plastics Industry Awards\n\nEstablished in 2001, the Plastics Industry Awards are firmly established as the forum for recognising and rewarding excellence in the plastics industry. Held annually, the event rewards innovation and exceptional performance from the best companies and the best people in plastics design and manufacturing in the UK and Ireland.\n\nWith 17 awards covering companies and individuals and all aspects of plastic product design, manufacture and recycling, the Plastic Industry Awards cover all sectors of the industry and give companies, large and small, the opportunity to enter and succeed in the competition.\n\nUnparalleled in the plastics industry, the awards are highly acclaimed by guests, winners, industry event supporters and commercial sponsors alike. Combining business networking, entertainment and pure fun, the event has become the highlight of the plastics industry calendar.\n\nThe event has evolved with the industry, introducing new award categories, upping the entertainment factor and adapting to many challenges including finding a way to stage an event in a pandemic. Organisers have always listened and responded to all their stakeholders, which is why the Plastics Industry Awards have retained their loyal industry following over the past two decades.\n\nInstitute of Workplace and Facilities Management – IWFM Impact Awards 2021\n\nThe Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management (IWFM)’s Impact Awards recognise best-in-class workplace and facilities management, celebrating the sector’s impact on the economy, environment and society at large.\n\nThe sector represents those frontline personnel who work as cleaners, caterers, security guards, hospital assistants and others. Its practitioners also boost organisations’ productivity, reduce their carbon emissions and oversee major operational changes. Finalists and winners serve as a source of gold-standard practice in a constantly evolving sector.\n\nIn 2019 the IWFM made the bold decision to appoint the events management division of its existing membership publishing agency – Redactive – to run the awards process.\n\nThe IWFM Impact Awards went ahead by necessity online. So the in-person 2021 event – after the sector had been keeping offices and buildings operational during COVID-19 – would be a precious opportunity to celebrate together.\n\nThe event, at London’s Grosvenor House on 11 October 2021, didn’t disappoint.\n\nFinancial results far exceeded expectations; feedback from commercial partners and attendees was phenomenal; and the mood on the dance floor (especially for a Monday night) was exuberant.\n\nNational House-Building Council – Pride in the Job Awards\n\nNHBC’s Pride in the Job (PiJ) competition has run for over 40 years and is the most highly regarded in the house-building industry.\n\nTo win, site managers must demonstrate consistent good working practices, from their leadership and technical expertise, to how they motivate their teams to produce the highest quality new homes.\n\nOrganising the competition’s annual 12 award ceremonies is an enormous undertaking with hundreds of NHBC staff and over 200 event crew involved in the project. 11 award ceremonies take place every Friday between September and November with the majority of events attracting 400-550 guests.\n\nJudging for the awards is rigorous too and takes 18 months. Thousands of sites are judged using strict marking criteria ensuring a transparent and consistent process\n\nWe’re very proud to say that for four decades, PiJ has gained momentum and remains highly respected. Rewards go beyond receiving a trophy. Winning helps build careers and professional reputation.\n\nThe competition was also Covid-19 resilient and in 2020 we delivered the competition to its usual high standards, changing our approach from in person and broadcasting 12 virtual award ceremonies.\n\nRedactive – Recruiter Awards 2021\n\nThe Recruiter Awards marked a milestone 20th anniversary in 2021, and never had a night been so hotly anticipated by the audience it serves. Due to COVID-19 restrictions the live event had been postponed from May that year. And although a virtual alternative had been proposed and surveyed, it is testament to the popularity of the Recruiter Awards that the results were overwhelmingly not in favour.\n\nOver the past two decades the event has earned a reputation as the place to be seen in the world of recruitment. Bringing together a spirited audience into the closest they can get to being a real community without having to swear allegiance to a professional institute. An audience that was prepared to wait for happier times when large gatherings could meet face to face.\n\nAnd 23 September 2021 didn’t disappoint.\n\nIn what was still a pandemic year, the 2021 Recruiter Awards were the most successful yet. A sell-out with a record number of table bookings. Existing sponsors were retained despite the delay and – most crucially – new sponsors came on board.\n\nTaylist Media – kbbreview Retail and Design Awards 2021\n\nThe kbbreview Retail & Design Awards are our industry’s most sought-after accolades in the kitchen and bathroom sector, and celebrate the very best retailers, designers, and manufacturers.\n\n27 Years Strong! We are proud to have run the kbbreview awards for such a vast number of years. We love the challenge of creating unique and quirky themes year on year and delivering the best night in our industry bar NONE.\n\nFor 2021 we held our carbon-neutral awards in Liverpool at the UK’s biggest cathedral wowing our 550 guests. Every “uneven” year we take kbbreview Awards on tours to new cities to keep our event fresh and exciting and this one was certainly a spectacular setting.\n\nJoel Dommett hosted 2021’s event and Martin Kemp DJ’d our amazing afterparty. Previous hosts have included other big names such as: Al Murray, Tom Allen, Jason Manford, Steph McGovern.\n\nIn recent years we’ve captured our audience with Bollywood and Steampunk themes, for 2021 we incorporated uber trendy laser violinists (sponsor branded too)! We love to raise the bar and make our awards one to remember – no challenge is too big for us, we love what we do!\n\nThe Payments Association – The PAY360 Awards\n\nThe Payments Association represents over 160 of the leading payments organisations – from industry giants such as Lloyds Banking Group, Visa and Mastercard right through to several niche start-ups Our industry is built on collaboration as well as competition, both of which are recognised in our Awards. The Awards allow members and non-members alike to enter awards.\n\nThe Payments Association’s purpose is to empower the most influential community in payment through our comprehensive programme of activities, facilitating connections and build the bridges that join the ecosystem together and make it stronger.\n\nThe PAY360 Awards (previously the Emerging Payments Awards) celebrates innovation and collaboration by recognising companies that have made significant advances in how we pay today.\n\nNow in its 15th year, The PAY360 Awards is the most prestigious event of the year for the UK payments industry Attended by over 850 of the most senior executives from across the payments value chain, it is an amazing networking opportunity.\n\nThe after-party is legendary! The black-tie reception, dinner, ceremony, and party will be held on the 5th of October 2022 at the JW Marriott Grosvenor House, Park.\n\nWilmington Events, EMEA – HSJ Awards 2021\n\nFor 41 years the HSJ Awards have been recognised as most esteemed accolade of UK healthcare service excellence. Whilst evolving and adapting to ensure continued relevance within the NHS and wider healthcare sector, the awards have adhered to their original values since inception.\n\nBuilding on the success from the HSJ Awards 2020 (delivered virtually), the messaging remained focused on shining a light on the NHS efforts to deal with the pandemic and celebrating teams and individuals, sharing best practice and innovations, which seemed to resonate with the entrants as they received over 1,000 entries which was 20% above target.\n\nThe event was delivered in a covid-safe environment whilst still proving an incredible experience for all attendees. 11-months of work by the team culminated in over 1,600 guests on the night celebrating how amazing the NHS are, which was reflected in all the feedback.\n\nThe 2021 event is testament of how successful the HSJ Awards are. Our legacy of celebrating the NHS continues to guide this event into an influential and inspirational one.\n\nBEST EVENTS TEAM\n\nAfrica Oil Week – Hyve Group\n\nAOW has run in Cape Town for 26 years but with South Africa facing a horrid time due to Covid-19, the teams hope and determination to deliver a face-to-face event in 2021 was looking more and more unlikely.\n\nAOW is an international event, attracting attendees from over 70 countries and we asked ourselves how can we re-connect our industry face-to-face again? We made the bold move to relocate the event to another continent. The facts, stats and data led us to Dubai but this was not without a combined team effort.\n\nTo be able to deliver a conference in 2021 was in itself a huge team achievement but to have delivered one of our best editions to date was unthinkable. Commercial goals exceeded by over a £1million, a 104% increase in NPS score and a 93% rebook. To move an established event of 26 years to a brand new continent, not knowing if any delegates or sponsors would follow with you, host it at a venue with suppliers you’d never before worked with and to achieve all this in under eight months is an incredible achievement and shows the dynamism, passion and dedication of an outstanding team.\n\nALM Awards Team\n\nThis cross-Atlantic awards team has been in existence for only a few short years but has already achieved a great deal. Covering over 30 awards in 4 continents we are truly global. Whilst we aim for a standardised approach, we take into account local nuances to ensure that our markets are well catered for. The pandemic allowed us the opportunity to showcase our events in different ways and created new opportunities for our clients to promote their achievements. We remained active in almost all of our markets whilst our competitors shut up shop. This allowed us to gain market share and enhanced our brands value proposition with our clients.\n\nDRPG\n\nThe DRPG Live team is a team of 164 full-time employees, made up of Project Directors, Producers, Project Managers, Logistic Managers, Production Managers, Project Co-ordinators, Technicians, Venue Finders, Set and Scenic Teams, and warehouse operations. This team continues to grow and develop. We have a broad range of disciplines and experience and are very much one family working together to support each other in delivering industry leading events. The team have united by sharing knowledge, experience and bringing positive challenge so that we all continue to grow regardless of their position within the team or business, from team members on apprenticeship programmes through to industry leading experts.\n\nSince March 2020 to present day the team have delivered over 1,000 virtual and hybrid events, and whilst there have been many challenges along the way, what they have achieved is remarkable. We have established a new virtual solutions service line that is here to stay and will very much be part of the future of event solutions. As the world moves back to live experiences, the DRPG team are in a prime position to offer expert advice and draw on a vast knowledge and offering to create world class experiences.\n\nFoundry\n\nThe Foundry (formally IDG Communications) Western European and META events team consists of only three people: Ellis Richardson, Romy Tuin, and Tomas Benjamin. This is also a new team. Tom joined Ellis remotely in January 2021 and Romy joined shortly after in April. Together, they executed 30 events in 2021, succeeding event revenue targets by 108% and helping to grow the event portfolio in terms of revenue by 145%. As a result of their incredible work ethic, they achieved an 85% increase in 2021 registrations vs 2020, including a 64% increase in realised attendees. The sponsor renewal rate for 2021-2022 is currently at 66% with an increased sponsor deal value. The diversity of speakers across all events also improved. 48% of the speakers throughout the year were female and 33% represented ethnic minority groups. Their continuous ‘review and renew’ approach kept the portfolio fresh and reflective of the changing landscapes, bringing success after success. Because of this, the event teams at Foundry in the UK were the biggest growing team in terms of revenue across the globe in 2021.\n\nIncisive Media Marketing Team\n\nIncisive Media’s marketing team had a phenomenally successful 2021 in which they delivered over 240+ events including 33 award ceremonies across three core portfolios. We innovated to support entry growth and deliver new experiences to our clients which they benefited from before, during and after each awards ceremony. We market webinars, online & live conferences, roundtables, festivals and awards ceremonies.\n\nInforma Pharma Intelligence Awards Team\n\n2021 saw a challenging year for the Pharma Intelligence Awards team, navigating a range of internal structural changes, redundancies and uncertainty with key stakeholders, whilst battling and accommodating the ever-changing COVID-19 travel restrictions and venue rules. This team of two successfully delivered five Awards in four weeks, in the UK and abroad, exceeding revenue targets by 30%. They ran two lots of back-to-back events despite significant budget cuts and limited event assistance. Their complementing skills make them a team that is highly regarded within the division and are often referred to as ‘the dream team’!\n\nInside Government\n\nSince the pandemic, the Inside Government team – including management, programme, operations and marketing – pulled together to deliver the events our consumers needed, in a way that still delivered everything they expected from us. Following the first lockdown, we knew we had to adapt, and we couldn’t simply transfer our traditional face-to-face format over to Zoom. We had to ensure that while participating virtually, our consumers could still interact with other delegates, ask questions, network, etc. By working more closely than ever before, the team redefined how they formatted events and created programmes, and implemented a sophisticated virtual events platform that facilitated the most interactive and engaging event features – Q&As, breakouts, streams, workshops, networking, roundtables, polls, etc. The team became more creative and innovative with their marketing to drive engagement and sign-ups, carefully analysing data to make informed business decisions. Finally, all these elements would come together to allow the team to deliver an exceptional experience for those delegates missing live events (from capped training forums to large interactive conferences). Using this model, the Inside Government team ran over 80 events during the past 12 months.\n\nThe Assembly\n\nhe Assembly launched as a live events business two months prior to the pandemic, so The Assembly’s first year went anything but to plan!\n\nHowever, during 2021, they held four events each in a different format.\n\nTwo of their own new event brands in the physical live event space, a consumer exhibition and a consumer conference. A hybrid event and a virtual event working in partnership with companies forming an extension of their team. Plus working alongside a software developer The Assembly created their own virtual events platform.\n\nTo activate these events, without premises due to the challenges of the pandemic, they hand-picked a team for each event, pulling together like-minded experts in their specific fields, to deliver exceptional events, and drawing on skill sets that traditionally did not sit in the exhibition space. A key appointment was Jane Galpin, whose breadth of experience in live events and TV production gave The Assembly an edge. This unique team’s combined skills offered broad strategic thinking, creativity and design, along with experience in TV production, technology, bespoke software and live events.\n\nWilmington Events, EMEA\n\nThe Health Service Journal (HSJ) Events Team delivers events to the NHS and wider healthcare sector. Their events unite high-level decision makers from clinical and non-clinical backgrounds on a platform that enables discussions, influences change and positively impacts healthcare delivery through carefully designed programmes and invaluable networking opportunities.\n\nIn July 2020, their audience was at the heart of the pandemic response which posed additional challenges for the team when they began to pivot events to virtual.\n\nThe journey the team embarked on was one of highs and lows, rescheduling, reinventing, and reimagining the events, but the one constant they had was their ability to work together at times of extreme pressure and deliver on results.\n\nConsistently meeting and exceeding revenue, attendee and feedback targets they rose to every challenge to ensure that the customers always had a great experience whether joining an event virtually or in-person\n\nBEST SECTOR SPECIFIC AWARDS EVENT\n\nDezeen Awards 2019\n\nDezeen Awards was launched in 2018 by Dezeen, the world’s most influential architecture, interiors and design magazine. This platform gives the awards programme unparalleled exposure by putting it in front of 3 million global visitors to the site each month.\n\nFinancial Services Forum – Annual Members’ Dinner and Marketing Effectiveness Awards 2019\n\nThe Financial Services Forum’s Awards for Marketing Effectiveness is the go-to event for financial services marketers and agencies. They were launched in 2001 and remain one of the financial service industry’s most prestigious award events.\n\nThe longevity of the Awards proves that they really deliver the goods in a changing marketplace that demands the very highest standards. The event has always delivered a strong financial performance, but 2019 was an exceptional year.\n\nIn a change to the standard format used at many award ceremonies, Matt Dawson presented the trophies by moving from table to table with a cameraman, microphone and live feed to the main screen. Winners swap their 30 seconds on stage with a chance to chat with a Rugby World Cup Winner with some entertaining interaction from Matt in his own inimitable style. A winning combination.\n\nThe Awards continue to go from strength-to-strength, thanks to a combination of consistency and innovation. They remain engaging and relevant, and are a key part of both the marketing and financial service industries.\n\nITP Media Group – Commercial Interior Design Awards\n\nThe Commercial Interior Design (CID) Awards are a celebration of excellence in the vibrant interior design and fit out sectors in the Middle East.

We punch way above our weight, but we are happy to go toe-to-toe with any other UK awards event.\n\nWe are of course supported by our carefully selected production partners: Maxlive Events and Createvents. We make an unbeatable team and put on an unbeatable event.

We aimed to combine face-to-face business opportunities for our audience and clients, with a rigorously tested awards programme, presented in a spectacular and exciting format, and to be considered the highlight of the industry year. We feel we have fully succeeded in delivering on those goals.\n\nRecruitment Marketing Awards 2019\n\nJob-hopping Millennials.\n\nStart-up mindsets.\n\nThe UK’s lowest unemployment rate since 1974 (ONS).\n\nFor organisations seeking to attract and retain talent, these are challenging times.\n\nFor the agencies and in-house teams supporting them, there has never been a more vital time for recognition.\n\nRecruitment marketing/talent management is one of the most creative industries in the world. Its heroes tend to be unsung rather than rock stars. Yet its output includes some of the most ingenious campaigns ever – often delivered by small teams working to tight budgets.\n\nSince 1980 the Recruitment Marketing Awards (RMAs) have been rewarding excellence in the profession at an event that aspires to match its audience’s creativity on every level. But that’s not what sets the RMAs apart.\n\nPositioned as the awards ‘By the industry for the industry’, the RMAs are uniquely collaborative and engage with their target audience at every stage: the categories, the marketing, the judging, and at the ceremony itself.\n\nCreatives can be a notoriously challenging community to win over. That 2019 was a record-breaking year for the RMAs, with the highest number of entries from the greatest number of organisations to enter, demonstrates the esteem in which the accolades are held.\n\nSeafish – National Fish and Chip Awards\n\nThe National Fish & Chip Awards celebrate the nation’s favourite dish and recognise and reward those who are providing us with the best fish and chips across the UK, both in terms of product and customer service.

The aim of the awards is to raise overall standards in the sector and encourage consumers to celebrate and visit their local fish and chip shop, to enjoy more seafood, more often.\n\nShorty Awards\n\nThe Shorty Awards were initially created to help discover the most entertaining and creative people on the internet back in 2008 when Twitter was in its earliest stage. Our co-founders wanted to discover the most creative accounts and content on the internet. They spent two weekends coding the first-ever voting system that let’s people vote with a tweet or social share thereby launching the Shorty Awards. Within 24 hours of launch, “Shorty Awards” became the top trending term on Twitter.\n\nNow 12 years old and growing, the Shorty Awards are a unique awards program as the first to celebrate individual influencers on social media and the brands and agencies in the space. This is the true beauty of the Shorty Awards experience, harnessing the excitement and energy of the internet and capturing it in one room, at a single event.

Now in its third year, the event continues to be the only consumer-voted awards programme in the duty-free and travel retail sector and has quickly established itself as the industry’s only legitimate awards programme.\n\nThe judging process is managed independently by an external research agency, m1nd-set, who harness the opinion of 5,000 consumers, all of whom have travelled internationally within the past six months and have experienced the retail and dining offer in airports. Phase two involves gathering the opinions of independent international influencers, who have established themselves as key opinion leaders among consumers interested in travel, aviation and shopping.\n\nSupport for the awards over the past three years is testimony to the success of the programme, with an 81% increase in sponsorship sales and a 51% increase in the number of entries from Y1 to Y3. The positive impact on business for the finalists and winners also demonstrates the need for, and legitimacy of, the Travel Retail Awards.\n\nBEST NEW AWARDS EVENT\n\nDisruptive Media Group – British Ex-Forces In Business Awards\n\nThe second annual British Ex-Forces in Business Awards took place on 8 May 2019 at the London Hilton on Park Lane and exceeded all expectations, doubling in size year-on-year to gather an amazing audience of 900 business and military leaders, making it the world’s largest business celebration of military veterans.

Most importantly, the event raised nearly £40,000 for SSAFA, the official charity partner of the awards.\n\nIncisive Media – Women in Insurance Awards 2019\n\nThe insurance industry is still male-dominated and parts have received adverse publicity for excessively chauvinistic behaviour. Against this background we launched these awards in May 2019.\n\nCreating the right categories and criteria was vital. We wanted to acknowledge all core skillsets in a complex industry and address specific challenges women face in developing their careers. This was achieved through extensive research and consultation. It worked: every category was extremely well supported with excellent entries.\n\nOur primary objective was to highlight the need to improve diversity and create a sense of community and empower women working in insurance. The volume of nominations (760) from over 400 individuals, followed by 432 individual entries demonstrates exceeding our targets.\n\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions Group – EG Tech Awards – EG Tech Awards\n\nThe EG Tech Awards was born out of a commitment to not only celebrating those in real estate and technology embracing digital transformation, but to bring the two sides of the sector together. By putting on an event that focuses on the achievements of both sides of the Proptech portmanteau, we gave the industry a celebration and a high-level networking event in one.\n\nWe have successfully launched an awards ceremony that has become one of the most respected and coveted in the sector in just two years. The mixture of venue, style, shortlists, winners, speakers and post event coverage makes it like nothing else in the space.\n\nThe EG Tech Awards is all about championing the tech and real estate, innovators and adopters who are embracing digital transformation as the sector is propelled head first into a far more reactive, agile future.\n\nRedactive – IEMA Sustainability Impact Awards 2019\n\nSustainability.\n\nIt’s the topic that’s top of mind for businesses on a global scale. And its importance – and urgency – is only set to escalate.\n\nBut at the same time the world’s business community acknowledges the opportunity for competitive advantage through leading on environmental issues, organisations of all sizes are recognising that they could be making a far greater contribution.\n\nThat’s why the significance of the IEMA Sustainability Impact Awards, launched in 2019 to reward members leading the change towards a more sustainable future, cannot be underestimated.\n\nAward entry numbers and the calibre of entrants, event attendees, and nominee feedback far exceeded expectations. It was an event that looks set to long continue – and could truly change the world.\n\nhe TRBusiness Travel Retail Awards\n\nRecognising the lack of consumer recognition and opinion in the duty-free industry TRBusiness decided to put real customers in the driving seat.\n\nLaunched in 2018 the Travel Retail Awards is held in May at the five-star Conrad Hotel in Singapore.

Bad practices and ‘creative’ target hitting will always attract more attention than the industry’s shining stars. It’s easy for the good guys to get lost.\n\nSo at a time when it’s more important than ever for recruitment business owners to consider how they are perceived in their market, the Recruiter Awards have never been more vital.

There are five ways this judging process stands out:\n\n1. every entrant gains personal feedback\n\n2. each year a changing group of judges is exposed to an exhilarating snapshot of best practice across the UK\n\n3. judges and entrants alike praise the organisation of the judging day\n\n4. the recognition for HR projects with media partnerships with The Guardian and Health Service Journal\n\n5. every HPMA member is able to read, meet and hear from all our finalists in our Winners’ Guide, regional roadshow events and national conference.\n\nDezeen Awards 2019\n\nDezeen Awards has the most diverse jury of any awards programme in our industry.

The categories have been developed to celebrate projects which are of strategic importance to the improvement of cancer services across the UK.\n\nThe judging process has been refined since the Awards were first launched in 2012, ensuring that a wide range of stakeholders are involved, including people living with cancer as well as service providers.

We aim to strike a balance between keeping the experienced and esteemed judges that return to the programme year on year; whilst recruiting new and emerging talent in the industry.\n\nIn 2019 we amended the application and judging process to include multi-media supporting documents.

This ensures they include relevant information and makes judges’ review straightforward.\n\nWe have an innovative three-stage process; the first two stages are completed on an online Awards platform that was built by our supplier with bespoke features just for us. After the first score-based round, judges are requested to review scores submitted by their predecessors and agree/disagree with the averages scored and the comments left. All results are discussed during the final stage. This sees two judging days, one in Miami for the Americas panel and one in London for the EMEA panel, and a conference call for the APAC panel (due to geographical constraints). These meetings are attended by 15-20 judges each and facilitated by their regional Chair. Now, judges discuss each entry and decide the one only winner per category.
