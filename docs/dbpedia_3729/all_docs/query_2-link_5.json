        "text": "What our customers say\n\nWe have worked with a wide range of clients who have wanted to reach NHS leaders and healthcare professionals. Every project was different and we tackled it in a bespoke way where we would maxmise the return for our customers. We have built campaigns by combining branding, lead generation, thought leadership and networking opportunities.\n\nWe helped Serco build strong relationships with senior decision makers in the NHS…\n\nSerco work in partnership with the NHS in the UK and with world-class health care companies across the globe, to deliver joined-up healthcare solutions. From patient contact centres to facilities management.\n\nObjective\n\nDemonstrate Serco’s patient care solutions, raise brand awareness and connect and nurture relationships with senior decision makers from the NHS\n\nSolution\n\nSerco collaborated with HSJ’s award winning editorial team to produce a valuable and revealing report and case study: the HSJ Commission into the hospital care of frail older people. HSJ distributed this report through our digital channels\n\nROI to date\n\nMrs Andrews’ story: 10,495 views, and video: 3,189 views\n\nMain report online: 3,637 page views\n\nReport PDF downloaded 1,517 times\n\nThe main report shared 112 times, with considerable outside comment\n\nWe helped Capsticks grow in double-digits by generating exclusive networking opportunities with NHS leaders…\n\nCapsticks law firm is widely known for its specialist understanding of health & social care, local government, social housing & the third sector.\n\nObjective\n\nCapsticks wanted to further strengthen their relationships with CCG leads and Trust CEOs, to support Capsticks expansion of regional offices and resources\n\nSolution\n\nHSJ created a series of exclusive networking opportunities at HSJ Awards, HSJ Commissioning Summit and HSJ Top Chief Executives, creating over 100 face to face opportunities\n\nROI\n\nCapsticks grew in double-digits in ’14, including advising UnitingCare Partnership on its successful £800m Cambridgeshire and Peterborough CCG’s contract for the integrated care of older people’s healthcare and adult community services, one of the largest CCG contracts to date\n\n“The Crohns and Colitis UK supplement on IBD specialist nursing was commissioned to raise the profile of the role with senior NHS leaders and stimulate action and service review at a senior level. The HSJ was recommended to us by an expert who had used a supplement in a similar way with great effect. We are delighted with the content, designed and planned using authoritative voices, and examples of clinical and service improvement from all areas of the specialty, including supporters, nurses, medics, commissioners and charity leaders. Broken into sections, the style of the supplement provides a complete overview, but also bite sized pieces we can use as a resource that we can use to promote IBD nurse specialism well into the future.”\n\nIsobel Mason, Service Development IBD Nurses, Crohn's and Colitis UK"
