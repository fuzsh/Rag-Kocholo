        "text": "IPC Media leads the way in nominations for the Periodical Publishers’ Association Magazines 2008 awards with a total of 16 nominations, including three for both lads’ weekly Nuts and music weekly NME. CMPi leads the b2b categories with a total of 15 nominations.\n\nBoth IPC titles are in the running for consumer media brand of the year and interactive consumer magazine of the year, with NME writer Mark Beaumont nominated for consumer writer of the year.\n\nNuts has also been nominated for consumer magazine of the year. Competition in the category includes two Bauer Consumer Media titles, Yours and Grazia, and two Conde Nast titles, Glamour and House and Garden.\n\nMaking its debut is free men’s weekly Shortlist with two nominations – Matthew Phare for designer of the year and Danny Wallace for columnist of the year.\n\nDavid McKendrick of the recently revamped men’s monthly Esquire has been nominated for consumer designer of the year, the only nomination for the NatMag title.\n\nMcKendrick is up against fellow upmarket men’s monthly designer, GQ’s Paul Solomons, one of four nominations for the Conde Nast title – which also sees Jamie Bill up for publisher of the year, Piers Morgan for writer of the year and (Spectator editor) Matthew D’Ancona for columnist of the year.\n\nCMPi has 15 nominations in the b2b categories. Its weekly magazine Property Week leads the b2b categories for individual titles with five nominations followed by Times Education Supplement and The Grocer, which both have four.\n\nBig business to business titles Health Service Journal, Estates Gazette and Property Week are to battle it out for the b2b weekly magazine of the year.\n\nNominations in the category come from across the b2b industry with a nod to Emap’s Drapers, William Reed’s The Grocer, The Times Educational Supplement and Incisive’s Legal Week.\n\nIn the monthly b2b category, both CMPi and Incisive have two shortlisted titles with Building Services Journal, The Practitioner, Financial Director and Global Pensions all up for a gong.\n\nThe two companies also dominate the business media brand category. CMPi’s Building and Property Week will be up against Incisive’s Computing (UK) and Risk. CMPi leads the shortlist with a total of 15 nominations overall.\n\nThe winners will be announced at an awards ceremony on 7 May at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London.\n\n2008 Shortlist\n\nConsumer magazine of the year\n\nGlamour – The CondÃ© Nast Publications\n\nGrazia – Bauer London Lifestyle\n\nHarper’s Bazaar – The National Magazine Company\n\nHouse & Garden – The CondÃ© Nast Publications\n\nNuts – IPC Media\n\nOlive – BBC Magazines\n\nPsychologies – Hachette Filipacchi UK\n\nYours – Bauer London Lifestyle\n\nMonthly business magazine of the year\n\nAccountancy – Wolters Kluwer (UK)\n\nBoat International – Boat International Group\n\nBuilding Services Journal – CMP Information\n\nFinancial Director – Incisive Media\n\nGlobal Pensions – Incisive Media\n\nThe Practitioner – CMP Information\n\nProfessional Beauty – Emap Communications\n\nReal Business – Caspian Publishing\n\nConsumer media brand of the year\n\nBBC Good Food – BBC Magazines\n\nCountry Living – The National Magazine Company\n\nNME – IPC Media\n\nNuts – IPC Media\n\nT3 – Future Publishing\n\nBusiness media brand of the year\n\nBuilding – CMP Information\n\nComputing (UK) – Incisive Media\n\nEstates Gazette – Reed Business Information\n\nProperty Week – CMP Information\n\nRetail Week – Emap Retail\n\nRisk – Incisive Media\n\nTimes Educational Supplement (TESS) – TSL Education\n\nCustomer magazine of the year\n\n33 Thoughts – BDO Stoy Hayward – John Brown\n\nAbout the House – Royal Opera House – BBC Customer Publishing\n\nASOS.com – As seen on screen – Seven Squared\n\nCamouflage – British Army – Haymarket Network\n\nClose Up – Ladbrokes – Aspect Media\n\nOneLife – Land Rover – Redwood\n\nSky Sports – Sky – Haymarket Network\n\nWaitrose Food Illustrated – Waitrose – John Brown\n\nYour M&S – Marks & Spencer – Redwood\n\nWeekly business magazine of the year\n\nDrapers – Emap Retail\n\nEstates Gazette – Reed Business Information\n\nHealth Service Journal – Emap Public Sector\n\nLegal Week – Incisive Media\n\nProperty Week – CMP Information\n\nThe Grocer – William Reed Business Media\n\nTimes Educational Supplement (TESS) – TSL Education\n\nConsumer specialist magazine of the year\n\nAutocar – Haymarket Consumer Media\n\nCharlie and Lola – BBC Magazines\n\nCoast – The National Magazine Company\n\nCondÃ© Nast Traveller – The CondÃ© Nast Publications\n\nDelicious – Seven Publishing\n\nEmpire – Bauer London Lifestyle\n\nHomes & Gardens – IPC Media\n\nRunner’s World – Natmag Rodale\n\nInteractive consumer magazine of the year\n\nbbcgoodfood.com – BBC Good Food – BBC Magazines\n\nempireonline.co.uk – Empire – Bauer London Lifestyle\n\ninstyle.co.uk – InStyle – IPC Media\n\nnewscientist.com – New Scientist – Reed Business Information\n\nnme.com – NME – IPC Media\n\nnuts.co.uk – Nuts – IPC Media\n\ntimeout.com/London – Time Out – Time Out Group\n\nwhatcar.com – What Car? – Haymarket Motoring Publications\n\nBusiness website of the year (Paid for)\n\nefinancialnews.com – Financial News Online – Financial News\n\nspendmatters.com – European Leaders Network – Sigaria\n\nworkplacelaw.net – Workplace Law Magazine – Workplace Law Group\n\nBusiness website of the year (Free access)\n\nAccountancyage.com – Accountancy Age – Incisive Media\n\nBrandRepublic.co.uk – Brand Republic – Haymarket Business Media\n\nCatererSearch.com – Caterer & Hotelkeeper – Reed Business Information\n\nComputing.co.uk – Computing (UK) – Incisive Media\n\nTes.co.uk – Times Education Supplement – TSL Education\n\nInternational consumer magazine of the year\n\nEve – Haymarket Consumer Media\n\nFHM – Bauer London Lifestyle\n\nHello!
