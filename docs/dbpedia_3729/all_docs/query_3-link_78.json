        "text": "(Note: An additional FAQ relating to more in-depth submission processes can be found here.)\n\nWhat is an unrefereed preprint?\n\nBefore formal publication in a scholarly journal, scientific and medical articles are traditionally certified by “peer review.” In this process, the journal’s editors take advice from various experts—called “referees”—who have assessed the paper and may identify weaknesses in its assumptions, methods, and conclusions. Typically, a journal will only publish an article once the editors are satisfied that the authors have addressed referees’ concerns and that the data presented support the conclusions drawn in the paper.\n\nBecause this process can be lengthy, authors use the medRxiv service to make their manuscripts available as “preprints” before certification by peer review, allowing other scientists to see, discuss, and comment on the findings immediately. Readers should therefore be aware that articles on medRxiv have not been finalized by authors, might contain errors, and report information that has not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community.\n\nWe also urge journalists and other individuals who report on medical research to the general public to consider this when discussing work that appears on medRxiv preprints and emphasize it has yet to be evaluated by the medical community and the information presented may be erroneous.\n\nSome journals and independent peer review services make peer reviews publicly available before a paper appears in a journal. In these instances, the peer reviews can be accessed via the medRxiv dashboard.\n\nAre medRxiv preprints peer-reviewed?\n\nManuscripts submitted to medRxiv are not certified by scientific peer review, edited, or typeset before being posted online. This means they may contain errors and/or omissions. Some manuscripts might be undergoing peer review, and the journals or other organizations who are responsible for this process, have the opportunity to post peer reviews alongside preprints in the article dashboard (see above).\n\nWho is responsible for the content posted on medRxiv?\n\nAuthors are solely responsible for the content posted on medRxiv. All submissions are screened for appropriateness (see below).\n\nAre submissions to medRxiv scrutinized before posting?\n\nAll articles are screened on submission for plagiarism, non-scientific content, inappropriate article types, and material that could potentially endanger the health of individual patients or the public. The latter may include, but is not limited to, studies describing dual-use research of concern and works that challenge or could compromise accepted public health measures and advice regarding infectious disease transmission, immunization, and therapy. Submissions are also checked for ethical oversight, clinical trial registration, and information that might identify a patient/participant (see corresponding questions below for details).\n\nIs there a charge for submitting manuscripts to medRxiv?\n\nThere is no fee to submit manuscripts to medRxiv.\n\nHow long does it take for a preprint to appear on medRxiv?\n\nArticle screening typically completes within 2-4 days; however, screening may take longer over a weekend or holiday, or if there are issues with the content that need addressing or extra scrutiny.\n\nWhat is the Impact Factor of medRxiv?\n\nmedRxiv is not a journal and so it has no Impact Factor.\n\nCan I submit a manuscript to medRxiv that I have submitted to a journal?\n\nA manuscript can be submitted to medRxiv at any time up to the point it is accepted by a journal. If a manuscript has been published by a journal, it cannot be submitted to medRxiv.\n\nCan I submit my article to a journal directly from medRxiv?\n\nYes, you can directly submit from medRxiv to an increasing number of journals. Once you have completed a preprint submission/revision, the option \"Submit medRxiv Preprint to a Journal or Peer Review Service\" will be available in your Author Area, with a list of available destinations. A current list can be found on medRxiv's About page and Submit page.\n\nWhich journals allow posting of preprints prior to submission?\n\nMany journals will consider manuscripts that were previously posted as preprints on medRxiv and other preprint servers. Lists of journal policies can be found on Wikipedia and SHERPA/RoMEO. Authors should consult these lists, individual journal websites, and other sources of information before submitting to medRxiv and if in doubt, contact the journal to which they ultimately intend to submit.\n\nA growing number of journals (144 and counting) are integrated with medRxiv either by accepting direct submission of preprints (medRxiv-to-journal, M2J) or by facilitating cosubmission of manuscripts to medRxiv (journal-to-medRxiv, J2M).\n\nWhat types of content can be posted on medRxiv?\n\nmedRxiv is for the distribution of preprints - complete but unpublished manuscripts - that describe human health research that was or will be conducted, analyzed, and interpreted according to scientific principles.\n\nThe following types of health-related articles are in scope and may be posted:\n\nResearch articles with new data\n\nResearch design protocols\n\nData articles (i.e., not hypothesis-driven research)\n\nSystematic and scoping reviews and meta-analyses, and bibliometric studies\n\nmedRxiv is NOT intended for:\n\nCase reports or case series\n\nWork not premised on modern biology/physiology or allopathic medicine\n\nPreclinical work\n\nVeterinary medicine studies\n\nNarrative reviews (see below)\n\nEditorials, letters, opinion pieces\n\nAnnouncements of tools or services\n\nRebuttals\n\nAddenda\n\nHypotheses without new data\n\nLaboratory protocols/recipes\n\nMeeting reports\n\nGuidelines\n\nPolicy statements\n\nTheses/undergraduate dissertations, term papers, textbook excerpts\n\nIndividual components of research articles, such as figures, tables, and datasets\n\nArticles of the above types are considered out of scope and will not be posted.\n\nMy preprint has been recommended for transfer to bioRxiv, what does this mean?\n\nIf your submission to medRxiv is considered better suited for our server bioRxiv during screening, you will be notified via email and your submission to medRxiv will be closed. The email will contain further information on how to proceed with the transfer of your manuscript. This transfer process is required to ensure that manuscripts are screened by the appropriate screening team.\n\nPlease note that bioRxiv and medRxiv, although co-managed, have separate policies on scope and screening procedures (for details, see bioRxiv and medRxiv). However, both servers are indexed by CrossRef, Google Scholar and others, and both servers automatically post new preprints from the respective Twitter/X, Mastodon and Bluesky accounts. Also, all preprints are searchable from the Advanced Search of either website. If you have any questions about the submission process, please don’t hesitate to contact medrxiv@cshl.edu.\n\nWhat are subject categories?\n\nmedRxiv posts preprints of articles covering all aspects of research in the health sciences. When posting an article, the author assigns it to one of ~50 subject categories. Subject categories are used primarily for categorization of article feeds, Twitter posts, etc. This is not a formal ontology and papers may appear in one subject category but would be equally appropriate to another.\n\nCan I choose more than one subject category for my preprint?\n\nOnly one subject area can be selected for a preprint on medRxiv. This maximizes convenience for readers by ensuring article feeds are not redundant.\n\nCan I post a clinical trial or any other health-related interventional study on medRxiv?\n\nProtocols or results of clinical trials and other prospective interventional studies can be posted on medRxiv providing:\n\nThey are in the form of a traditional scientific paper.\n\nThey include a trial ID from an ICMJE-recognized trial registry (such as clinicaltrials.gov, see extended list here).\n\nFor novel drugs and devices: they have received specific exemption from trial registration as they are registered for emergency use by a national or international body that precludes the release of information about trial registration, for example, the Investigational New Drug (IND) or Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) by US FDA.\n\nThey have approval from an appropriate ethics oversight body (e.g., Ethics Committee, Institutional Review Board, or equivalent).\n\nWe define a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns a person or a group of people to an intervention, with or without concurrent comparison or control groups, to study the relationship between a health-related intervention and a health-related outcome. Interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, educational programs, dietary interventions, quality improvement interventions, and process-of-care changes. Health outcomes include educational, behavioral, cognitive, or biological (e.g., biomarker) outcomes, pharmacokinetic measures, and measures of adverse events.\n\nWe strongly recommend that authors avoid using causal language, particularly for retrospective studies, in which non-causal language describing observed associations is preferred. Papers with inappropriate causal language may be declined.\n\nI do not have a trial ID; can I register my prospective interventional study as a trial retrospectively?\n\nmedRxiv requires that all prospective interventional studies, such as clinical trials, even those not yet initiated, be registered, regardless of the cohort size. If registration has not been performed at the time of submission, we will ask all authors to retrospectively register their study.\n\nCan I post a review article on medRxiv?\n\nNo, medRxiv is intended for the rapid sharing of new research, defined as experimental, mathematical, or computational work. Systematic reviews that include reproducible methodology (we recommend using PRISMA guidelines) and meta-analyses that include new analyses of existing data may be appropriate. Narrative reviews, viewpoints and essays that primarily summarize existing knowledge are not appropriate. Neither are hypothesis articles, guidelines, policy statements, theses/undergraduate dissertations, term papers and textbook excerpts.\n\nCan I post methods or protocols on medRxiv?\n\nComplete health-related research articles summarizing new experimental or computational methods and tools are appropriate and may include step-by-step protocols. Tool announcements and step-by-step protocols alone are not sufficient and must be placed in the context of a complete research article that includes elements such as Introduction, Results, and Discussion. Clinical research design protocols presented in the form of a complete article may be posted.\n\nCan I post a disease modeling paper?\n\nmedRxiv welcomes computational/mathematical papers that model disease prevalence and transmission, for example. These should be full research papers that address a research question and include methodological details of the models created and results. Studies limited to the representation of publicly available data and straightforward correlations or extrapolations are generally not considered sufficient, nor are software or algorithm announcements that do not include detailed methods and research data produced by their output/application.\n\nCan I include images of individuals in my preprint?\n\nNo. medRxiv does not post articles that include images or information that could identify an individual. As a preprint server, we cannot verify whether appropriate consent has been obtained. To protect patient/participant confidentiality, we will decline manuscripts containing images that may identify an individual. Therefore, we request that authors remove all figure elements containing photographs in which an individual's face or other identifying features are present prior to submission. Please note obscuring, blurring, covering, or pixelation of the faces is not sufficient for posting on medRxiv.\n\nWhat information is considered identifying?\n\nThe identities of patients and other research participants should not be discernible to themselves, their family and friends, or anyone reading the preprint.\n\nWe will ask authors to remove all identifying information before the manuscript is posted on medRxiv. This includes direct Identifiers that point explicitly to a particular patient and combinations of indirect Identifiers that together could be used to identify a specific person.\n\nDirect identifiers include real names or initials, official document numbers, patient/sample IDs, photographs of people (barring of eyes or pixelation is not sufficient), biometric data, identifying marks or text on images of body parts, precise ages (as opposed to age ranges), specific family relationships, exact dates/times and geographic locations linked to individuals.\n\nThere should also be fewer than three indirect identifiers. Indirect identifiers include: age ranges, ethnicity, religion, family details and medical history, occupation, and handwriting samples. If all presented data has the potential to make patients identifiable, authors should remove it in the preprint and advise readers to contact them to request access. Any content that cannot be removed and is potentially sensitive and could cause harm if the patient were to be identified cannot be posted on medRxiv and should instead go through peer review at a journal that can deal with these issues in full.\n\nCan I post a response on medRxiv to another preprint or an article published in a journal?\n\nmedRxiv is intended for the rapid sharing of new research and not for commentary that simply contests or rebuts research published in journals. However, manuscripts that augment or challenge earlier work with bona fide new data and/or complete re-analyses of published datasets may be deemed appropriate.\n\nCan I post a manuscript that is not in English?\n\nArticles must be submitted in English as we are only able to screen for inappropriate or dangerous content in English. If you wish to make material in another language available, you should advise readers to contact the corresponding author to request it or provide a link to data elsewhere.\n\nWho holds copyright for medRxiv preprints and what licensing options are supported?\n\nAuthors retain copyright of their manuscripts and can choose from a number of distribution/reuse options, including:\n\nNo reuse/adaptation without permission (Anyone who wishes to share, reuse, remix, or adapt this material must obtain permission from the corresponding author.)\n\nCC-BY-NC-ND (Anyone can share this material, provided it remains unaltered in any way, this is not done for commercial purposes, and the original authors and source are credited and cited. Anyone who wishes to remix/adapt the work or reuse it for commercial purposes must first obtain permission from the corresponding author.)\n\nCC-BY-ND (Anyone can share this material, providing it remains unaltered in any way and the original authors and source are credited and cited. Anyone who wishes to remix/adapt the work must first obtain permission from the corresponding author.)\n\nCC-BY-NC (Anyone can share, reuse, remix, or adapt this material, providing this is not done for commercial purposes and the original authors and source are credited and cited. Anyone who wishes to reuse the work for commercial purposes must first obtain permission from the corresponding author.)\n\nCC-BY (Anyone can share, reuse, remix, or adapt this material for any purpose, providing the original authors and source are credited and cited.)\n\nCC0 (The paper is placed in the public domain and no longer restricted by copyright. Anyone can legally share, reuse, mix, or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors or source.)\n\nThe licensing terms selected by the author determine the parameters for reuse. The copyright holder and licensing information for each manuscript are displayed beneath the Abstract and on the Info/History tab on the preprint page.\n\nWhat do I do if I think copyright has been infringed in a preprint?\n\nCold Spring Harbor Laboratory will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law. If you believe any preprints on medRxiv infringe your copyright, you may request removal of those materials from medRxiv by submitting written notification to our copyright agent designated below. In accordance with the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512) (\"DMCA\"), the written notice (the \"DMCA Notice\") must include substantially the following:\n\nYour physical or electronic signature;\n\nIdentification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works on medRxiv, a representative list of such works;\n\nIdentification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material;\n\nAdequate information by which we can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, email address);\n\nA statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;\n\nA statement that the information in the written notice is accurate; and\n\nA statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.\n\nOur designated copyright agent to receive DMCA Notices is: Dr John Inglis, co-founder medRxiv, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1 Bungtown Road, Cold Spring Harbor, NY11742 If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective. Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on medRxiv is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA. It is our policy in appropriate circumstances to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.\n\nHow should I acknowledge the use of generative AI for writing my preprint?\n\nAuthors are responsible for the content they submit, including material produced by generative AI and related technologies. As with other computational methodologies, use of these tools should be detailed in manuscripts, and the output must not plagiarize other work or breach copyright. In any case, authors are accountable for the accuracy, integrity, and originality of their work. AI tools and large language models (LLMs) do not meet this requirement and should not be listed as authors on articles.\n\nCan I submit a manuscript to medRxiv and another preprint server?\n\nWe strongly recommend that a preprint be posted on only one server. medRxiv provides metrics for article views, PDF downloads, and attention scores. Authors will find these metrics are underestimated in article-to-article comparisons if a manuscript appears on more than one server. In addition, readers may be frustrated by encountering versions of the same preprint in more than one location, and this could cause confusion in citations. Posting to both medRxiv and bioRxiv is not permitted and will result in article withdrawal. Manuscripts already present on other preprint servers will not be posted.\n\nWhat file formats are acceptable when submitting my manuscript?\n\nAuthors may submit either a single PDF file to medRxiv or individual text and figure files, which then undergo automated PDF conversion. Text files should be submitted as Word, WordPerfect, or PDF files. Authors must convert TeX files (including LaTeX) to PDF prior to submission. If images and tables are submitted as separate files, acceptable file formats are GIF, TIFF, EPS, and JPEG, as well as most common word-processing formats for tables. Authors should avoid using images with partially or completely transparent backgrounds as such images will not display correctly. Supplemental files are posted “as is” and can be submitted in a wide range of popular file formats with the requirement that medRxiv screeners should be able to easily access their content.\n\nIn what formats are medRxiv preprints available?\n\nmedRxiv preprints are first posted as PDF files derived from the author's original manuscript. The main text is also converted to full text HTML and XML (this can take up to 48 hours, so the full text HTML typically posts 1-2 days after the PDF). The full text HTML is also used to generate a print-friendly version with in-line figures. XML is available for text mining purposes. Each version of a manuscript’s main text is hence available in PDF, HTML, and XML formats. Supplemental files are available in the format submitted by the authors.\n\nWhy have some details changed in the Abstract or other metadata?\n\nMetadata details (manuscript title, author list, abstract, etc.) are supplied by the author during the submission process and initially post with the PDF. These are replaced with final metadata extracted from each PDF file once the full text HTML is generated. There may be small differences between the metadata the authors supply and the corresponding text derived from their PDF files.\n\nI see full text HTML for some papers but not others. Why?\n\nManuscripts are posted in PDF form as soon as they are accepted and simultaneously sent for XML conversion. The full text HTML for recently posted manuscripts typically appears within 2 days after the PDF posts.\n\nWhat are the different options for printing and downloading medRxiv preprints?\n\nPDF files on medRxiv are created by the authors. Since these vary considerably in layout, medRxiv also generates a full text version with in-line figures that readers can print directly or save as PDF if they prefer this to the author’s original file. We also provide an XML version, which may work with dedicated viewers but is typically used for text mining. Note that the tagged full text versions are typically generated 24-48 hours after the PDF first posts (the links are grayed out before these become available).\n\nCan I revise my preprint?\n\nThe revision process is intended for substantially updating the content of the manuscript, e.g., new datasets used, reanalyses, expanded discussion or supplemental information. If errors are entered in the Title, Author names, Author affiliations or Abstract fields in the submission system but are correct in the PDF, they will only appear on the site for approximately 48 hours before they are replaced with final metadata extracted from the PDF file. Therefore, authors should refrain from submitting revisions to fix those issues exclusively.\n\nOtherwise, a manuscript posted on medRxiv can be revised at any time until it is accepted for publication in a journal. Note, however, that some journals request that authors do not post versions that include changes made in response to the journal's peer review process.\n\nHow do I submit a revised version of my preprint?\n\nTo submit a revised version of your preprint, select “Submit a revision” within the Author area, find your submission ID# and click on the link “Submit a revised manuscript”. The revision will be posted under the same DOI and the original version of the manuscript will remain accessible in the Info/History tab on the posted preprint page. If the content of the manuscript has changed sufficiently for you to consider it a different article, you should submit it as a new manuscript, not a revision, and it will be assigned a new DOI.\n\nIf you wish to revise a paper that was submitted to medRxiv indirectly via a journal’s submission process (journal-to-medrxiv, J2M), you must do so by using the medRxiv submission system. First, the corresponding author must ensure they are registered at medRxiv by clicking ‘create a new account’ at https://submit.medrxiv.org and providing the same email address entered during journal submission. The corresponding author will then be able to complete their account registration and log into their Author Area on medRxiv to submit revisions.\n\nCan I make a silent name change to an article?\n\nmedRxiv allows author name changes, defined as an update to an individual author’s first/last name, without an accompanying revision or correction notice (so-called “silent” changes) if an author requests this. This provision does not cover author name removals or author list re-ordering. Requests for silent name changes should be made by email. No explanation is required. Note that you can still make non-silent name changes by simply submitting a revised version of the article. Most authors will prefer this latter option as it maximizes the likelihood that the change is perpetuated to third-party indexing services.\n\nI have changes to my Supplemental files but not to my previously posted medRxiv preprint. Do I need to submit a new version of my manuscript when I submit revised Supplemental files?\n\nThe main article must be resubmitted with the revised Supplemental files, even if no changes are made to the manuscript file itself.\n\nCan I remove a manuscript that has been posted on medRxiv?\n\nNo. Manuscripts posted on medRxiv receive DOI's and are citable and part of the scientific record. They are indexed by services such as Google Scholar and Crossref (see below), creating a permanent digital presence independent of medRxiv records. Consequently, medRxiv’s policy is that preprints cannot be removed. Authors may withdraw their manuscript if they no longer stand by their findings/conclusions or discover fundamental errors in the manuscript. In these cases, a statement explaining the reason for the withdrawal is posted on the medRxiv manuscript page to which the DOI defaults; the original manuscript is still accessible via the Info/History tab on medRxiv and a “Withdrawn” watermark is added to the PDF of all posted versions of the main text of the manuscript. To initiate the withdrawal process, navigate to the \"Submit a Revision\" section of your Author Area, find your submission ID# and click on the “Submit a Withdrawal Statement” link to proceed. In extremely rare cases, papers have been removed for legal or safety reasons.\n\nDo I need a statement on ethical oversight?\n\nmedRxiv requires a statement of ethical oversight by an independent dedicated oversight body (such as an Ethics Committee, Institutional Review Board, or equivalent) for all cases in which human subjects, samples or data were used for research purposes, unless the data are already openly available. This includes research that uses anonymized or aggregated data, service evaluations/improvements studies, surveys, studies that use controlled access datasets, studies that involve de-identified, discarded, leftover, post-mortem or purchased samples, or samples from researchers themselves, clinical research design protocols. We do NOT accept decisions made by Online Tools (such as HRA Decision Tool), or decisions from audit bodies, Caldicott Guardians, biosafety, data handling or information protection committees, Human Resources or Research & Development Departments. Ethical oversight must cover the entire study and all human samples, data, and patient cohorts.\n\nWhere are medRxiv preprints indexed?\n\nmedRxiv preprints are indexed by Google, all other search engines, Google Scholar, Crossref, Semantic Scholar, Europe PubMed Central, and Preprint Citation Index (connected to the Web of Science). Preprints of NIH-funded studies are also indexed by PubMed.\n\nWill medRxiv content remain permanently accessible and usable in the future?\n\nYes, all medRxiv papers are archived at Portico.\n\nHow do I cite medRxiv preprints?\n\nPreprints deposited in medRxiv should be cited using their digital object identifier (DOI).\n\nExample: Author AN, Author BT. 2019. My article title. medRxiv doi: 10.1101/2019.12.11.12345678\n\nIf there are multiple versions of the preprint and you wish to cite a specific version, you can do so by adding the version-specific URL.\n\nExample: doi: 10.1101/2019.12.11.12345678 version 2, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.11.12345678v2\n\nCan I cite medRxiv preprints in my NIH application?\n\nYes. From Reporting Preprints and Other Interim Research Products: “The NIH encourages investigators to use interim research products, such as preprints, to speed the dissemination and enhance the rigor of their work.”\n\nMy preprint has now been published in a journal. What happens next?\n\nNothing further is usually required from authors. All preprint versions will remain on the site and medRxiv will usually automatically add a link to the published version within approximately 2 weeks of journal publication. The corresponding author should receive an email from medRxiv requesting confirmation of the link.\n\nOn rare occasions a match is not made for technical reasons. If the link does not appear, please wait 2-3 weeks before contacting medRxiv staff (medrxiv@cshl.edu) or leave a comment in the comment section for your preprint. We will verify all such requests before linking preprints to the published article.\n\nWhat are Channels and how can I request a Channel?\n\nChannels are curated collections of preprints that share the subject area focus of a particular organization (e.g., Albert Einstein College of Medicine). If your organization is interested in maintaining a Channel, please contact medrxiv@cshl.edu. medRxiv does not curate the collections algorithmically: a curator will be needed from your organization to manually tag appropriate papers after they have posted on medRxiv.\n\nHow do I subscribe to one or more Subject Area Alerts from medRxiv?\n\nYou can add or remove Subject Area Alerts at any time by checking or unchecking subject categories from the Sign Up for Subject Area Alerts page.\n\nDoes medRxiv provide metrics for preprints?\n\nMetrics are provided for all preprints and can be found in each preprint's Metrics tab. Usage based on Abstract and PDF views is updated daily. In addition, Altmetrics are provided that track attention to the preprint in blogs, tweets, news reports, and other media.\n\nDoes medRxiv provide bulk access to full text and metadata or an API?\n\nmedRxiv provides free and unrestricted access to all articles posted on the server. We believe this should apply not only to human readers but also to machine analysis of the content. A growing variety of resources, including APIs and feeds, have been created to facilitate this.\n\nHow does medRxiv mitigate the risk from posting manuscripts that are not certified by peer review?\n\nSubmissions to medRxiv undergo a multi-step screening process to identify content that is non-scientific, lacks appropriate ethical oversight or clinical trial registration, contains excessive identifying information or could endanger the public. All preprints posted to medRxiv are accompanied by a prominent statement that the content has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to directly inform clinical decision-making. PDFs also receive a stamp indicating this. See this post for more information about the screening process at medRxiv.\n\nWho runs medRxiv?\n\nmedRxiv is a collaborative project jointly run by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), Yale University, and BMJ, a global healthcare knowledge provider. It is a non-profit service financially supported by CSHL, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The server is owned and operated by CSHL."
