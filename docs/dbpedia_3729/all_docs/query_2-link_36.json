        "text": "Students of Public Health: Voices & Profiles focuses on research projects and other contributions students are making to advance public health.\n\nNew Format\n\nThis year, we’re changing our format for the Students Who Rocked Public Health series. In years past, we have featured a variety of students individually throughout the year, culminating in December with a round-up of students whose work we felt captured some of the public health moments of the previous 12 months.\n\nFor 2019, we’ve decided to list the Students Who Rocked Public Health this year (as well as an impressive list of honorable mentions) and then follow up with more in-depth profiles of each winner throughout 2020.\n\nAbout SWRPH 2019\n\nNominees were evaluated on timeliness and urgency of the public health issue addressed, level of success achieved, overall impact of the project, and level of inclusiveness and diversity. We received a record number of nominations, thanks to assistance from ASPPH and the de Beaumont Foundation for helping us spread the word, which made it ever more difficult to make selections. Competition was high with projects aimed to research or mitigate a wide range of important public health issues. However, the editors felt that the most timely and urgent projects of 2019 were those that addressed climate change, barriers to vaccine uptake, vaping and opioids, interventions aimed at social determinants of health, barriers and facilitators to mental health services among disadvantaged communities, disparities in preventable deaths due to pregnancy complications for women of color in tribal communities, negative effects of pesticides on pregnant women, uptake of HIV self-testing and contraception, the impact of wildfire-associated air pollution on skin and respiratory health, pediatric patients with persistent opioid medication and the impact of medical cannabis policies on the prevalence of opioid use disorder, and recruiting and retaining public health nurses.\n\nHonorable mentions include projects providing social support and medication adherence in urban slums in India; developing a framework for the promotion of mental well-being in early childhood; addressing food insecurity and housing issues among Georgia Southern University students and throughout Savannah/Chatham County, GA; decreasing emergency department overcrowding and improving patient flow at UNC hospitals in Chapel Hill, NC; addressing root causes of hunger in Rochester, NY; researching the impact of school-based health centers on ethnic minority students who are particularly vulnerable to academic struggles and poor health outcomes; expanding the reach of an oral health screening/education program for schoolchildren in Cambridge, MA; developing a health risk tool to improve hospital readmission rates and reduce the cost of care by reducing inpatient hospitalizations and emergency department visits; planning Wayne State University’s Community Engaged Research Symposium, a one-and-a-half-day conference on cancer and cardiovascular disease with a focus on engaging people of color and sexual and gender minorities in research and health advocacy; researching the social context of summer care programs and how they may impact physical activity behaviors in adolescents across a summer; researching glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) to reduce exposure levels in vulnerable populations; developing a community-based diabetes management program among the Nepali-speaking Bhutanese population; and assisting the Missouri DOH with its healthcare billing discharge dataset, shepherding data through the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM coding transition, and reporting nonfatal opioid overdose information to the CDC.\n\n“This is an amazing collection of emerging professionals,” said Justin B. Moore, PhD, Associate Editor of the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice. “The passion, commitment, and creativity of our honorees is remarkable. I cannot wait to see how they will contribute to the profession in the future.”\n\nStudents Who Rocked Public Health 2019\n\nWe’re thrilled to announce this list of Students Who Rocked Public Health in 2019 (appearing alphabetically):\n\nCecilia Sara Alcala (PhD ’20) – Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.

UNCOVERING THE LINK BETWEEN GLYPHOSATE-BASED HERBICIDES AND NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA. Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are the most widely used herbicides in the world, though their potential to cause cancer is arguably controversial. Along with mentor Luoping Zhang, Rana evaluated the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma following high exposures to GBHs and identified a 41% increase in the meta-relative risk. Since publication in July 2019, their GBH paper is the most accessed article in the history of the journal Mutation Research Reviews. It attracted immense international media attention, and has been the subject of over 150 news articles and nearly 8,000 tweets and shares to date.\n\nAditi Sharma (DrPH ’21) – Pennsylvania State University. COMMUNITY-BASED DIABETES MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AMONG THE NEPALI-SPEAKING BHUTANESE POPULATION. A community-based diabetes education program was piloted among the rapidly growing Nepali-speaking Bhutanese population in Harrisburg, PA. The project comprised of four diabetes education and cooking demonstration workshops. Each session began with an education workshop facilitated in Nepali language, including carb counting, meal planning, exercise, medical complications, and preventive health. The cooking demonstrations were conducted by a Nepali-speaking cook, who used locally sourced produce to demonstrate healthy and culturally tailored meal preparation for diabetes patients.\n\nTanner Turley (MA ’21) – University of Missouri Columbia.
