        "text": "Media group Emap's £14m acquisition of a specialist building information company has been judged anti-competitive by the watchdog investigating the deal.\n\nThe Competition Commission said today it expected Emap's purchase of ABI Building Data - which provides construction industry data online or by subscription-only A4 bulletins - to result in a \"substantial lessening of competition\".\n\nEmap bought ABI six months ago and has run it alongside its existing construction information operation Glenigan without taking steps to integrate the businesses.\n\nA merger would give Emap 70% control of the market, putting it in a position where it could raise prices, the commission said.\n\n\"Both Glenigan and ABI have been able to raise prices profitably in the past few years even whilst in active competition,\" said Diana Guy of the commission. \"It is likely that the merged company would have even more scope to do so.\"\n\nThe commission is considering whether Emap should dispose of ABI, license data to a competitor or follow some other remedy.\n\nIt is inviting responses from interested parties in the next few weeks and may extend the inquiry's December 15 deadline.\n\nEmap bought ABI from Springer Science & Business Media, which was owned by the German media giant Bertelsmann until last year, when it was sold to private equity groups Cinven and Candover.\n\nAs well as more eyecatching titles such as Heat, FHM, Closer and Q, Emap has a large number of trade and specialist publications, including Nursing Times and Health Service Journal.\n\n· Daily Mail owner DMGT said today its exhibitions division had spent an estimated £7.4m on a number of small acquisitions.\n\nDMG World Media's new properties include a consumer home show in San Diego, California, a small antiques newspaper in the US and the European Autumn Gas Conference.\n\n· To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"
