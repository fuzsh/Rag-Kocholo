By shining a spotlight on cutting-edge innovations and best practice, the awards give impetus to improving the quality of health care in the UK.\n\nAfter review by esteemed judging panels, made up of senior and influential figures from the health sector, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust with Nervecentre won in recognition of their real time system that is well defined\n\nPaul Volkaerts, Managing Director of Nervecentre Software comments, “To win such a coveted award amongst such strong competition really shows the strength of our offering. This has been an exemplar project with strong clinical leadership and teamwork, and we are very proud of this amazing achievement.”\n\nAlastair McLellan, Editor, HSJ, said:\n\n“Year after year, award winners tell us how their success has boosted their projects, raised morale and helped with securing backing and finance. Much of the best practice now common in the NHS began with schemes which were more widely adopted following their success at the HSJ Awards. Projects such as University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust with Nervecentre’s can inspire NHS organisations elsewhere, helping to safeguard patient care through the encouragement of innovation and healthcare excellence at a time when the NHS is under the spotlight. Congratulations once again to all of this year’s finalists and winners. I will look forward to hearing about new and further developments of projects in 2014.”\n\nThe introduction of the new category; ‘Compassionate Patient Care’ for the 2013 HSJ Awards has been backed by the Department of Health. The new award celebrated ways in which healthcare organisations have responded to recommendations of the Francis report, and highlighted excellence and real dedication to compassionate people-centred care. Jeremy Hunt, health secretary, encouraged all organisations to consider entering the new HSJ Award category.\n\nNow in its 32nd year, the 2013 event saw a record number of entries, with 139 organisations and 185 projects recognised on the shortlist as providers of healthcare excellence.\n\nThe full list of winners can be found below.\n\nFor more information on the HSJ Awards go to http://www.hsjawards.co.uk"
