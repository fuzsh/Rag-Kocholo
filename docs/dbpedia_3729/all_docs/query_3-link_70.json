Our guide offers tips from nursing professionals on incorporating it into nursing culture and practice.\n\nHealth disparity refers to health differences linked to economic, environmental, and social disadvantages that result in groups of people experiencing greater obstacles to health. A patient’s culture — including ethnicity and race, gender, age, class, education, religion, sexual orientation and identification, and physical abilities — have also been linked to disparities. Health equity seeks to reduce and eventually eliminate health disparities by allocating resources based on need.\n\nCultural awareness, diversity, and inclusivity in nursing strive to combat differences in healthcare that lead to worse health outcomes for disadvantaged racial and ethnic groups.\n\nIn some American regions, for example, the average life expectancy can vary by decades from one neighborhood to another. Jamil Norman, a registered nurse and nursing instructor, has found in her research that Black mothers in the U.S. are 3-4 times more likely to die in childbirth compared to white mothers. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released similar findings, estimating that Black women die of maternal causes at 2.6 times the rate of non-Hispanic white women.\n\n“These health disparities for childbearing Black women have persisted despite overall improvements in pregnancy-related outcomes,” Norman says.\n\nThis guide discusses cultural competence and how it relates to health equity in the U.S., and includes insights from nursing professionals on how both nurses and their patients can benefit from culturally competent care.\n\nGet your Bachelor of Science in Nursing Online from Excelsior\n\nOnline Bachelor of Science in NursingExcelsior University\n\nCareer opportunities and personal growth await you with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.

Cultural competence describes the ability to effectively interact with people belonging to different cultures.\n\nThe importance of cultural competence in nursing focuses on health equity through patient-centered care, which requires seeing each patient as a unique person.\n\nAs Gregory Knapik, DNP and assistant professor of nursing, explains, “Nurses must be able to understand and appreciate different cultural backgrounds in order to do their job effectively and with the highest degree of care.”\n\nNorman specifies that “cultural competence is the willingness to understand and interact with people of different cultures, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality.”\n\nThis approach allows nurse professionals to successfully treat patients even when patients’ beliefs, practices, and values directly conflict with conventional medical and nursing guidelines. Nurses can develop the ability to tailor and explain treatment plans according to patients’ needs, which may be influenced by cultural practices that don’t fall within the parameters of conventional medicine.\n\n“Utilizing cultural competence appropriately will allow for deeper connections with patients,” says Knapik. “You will gain the trust of the patient by being empathetic to their differences and unique needs.”\n\nComponents of Culturally Competent Care\n\nCulturally competent care consists of four components: awareness of one’s cultural worldview, attitudes toward cultural differences, knowledge of different cultural practices and worldviews, and cross-cultural skills. Together, these components contribute to a high degree of cultural competency, and nurses can integrate them into the care of their patients.\n\nAwareness\n\nNurses can pay close attention to their own implicit biases and how they react to people whose backgrounds and cultural experiences differ from their own. For example, a person who becomes conscious that they think of immigrants as illegal aliens achieves cultural awareness of that particular bias.\n\nAttitude\n\nOnce nurses tap into awareness, they can actively analyze their increased awareness and internal belief systems. Using the above example, the person can examine their own background, beliefs, and values to better understand how they interact with others, and how those interactions might be improved to build better connections and deliver better care.\n\nKnowledge\n\nProviders should continually improve their knowledge to better understand the values, beliefs, and practices associated with the health and well-being of various cultural groups. This could include a clear understanding of local and traditional healthcare networks and systems, as well as the unique needs of the communities they serve.\n\nSkills\n\nNurses put their awareness, attitude, and knowledge into practice by repeating culturally competent behaviors until they become integrated into their daily interactions. These behaviors include effective and respectful communication and body language. Among various cultures, nonverbal communication methods, such as gestures, can mean very different things.\n\nBenefits of Culturally Competent Care\n\nUsing terms patients understand\n\nMake sure a medical interpreter is present if the patient speaks another language, asking a family member to translate may not be enough\n\nRespecting patients’ cultural and religious beliefs that conflict with treatment plans\n\nRecruiting health professionals from underserved, diverse, and LGBTQ+ communities\n\nAnalyzing the ethnic composition demographics of patients currently served\n\nIdentifying patients in underserved populations and communities\n\nForming a committee of diverse nursing staff members to promote and coordinate cultural awareness measures, such as signage and forms in different languages and community outreach\n\nTaking Steps to Improve Cultural Competence\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, health officials began developing resources and guidelines to improve culturally competent nursing care:\n\nThe Heckler Report, also called the Report on Black and Minority Health, was released in 1985 to mobilize elimination of health disparities.\n\nThe federal Office of Minority Health was established in 1986 to implement the Heckler Report.\n\nThe Healthy People 2010 agenda, which includes the goal of eliminating health disparities, released in 2000 with an update in 2010.\n\nNational CLAS Standards, a 2000 federal report outlining culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS) in health care, was updated in 2013.\n\nLEP Guidance, issued in 2000 and in 2003, addresses working with people with limited English proficiency (LEP).\n\nCLAS in Nursing launched in 2024 to help nurses improve quality of care by understanding, respecting, and responding to a patient’s experiences, values, and beliefs.\n\nNational Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities: Part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH, this institute leads and supports scientific research to improve minority health and eliminate health disparities.\n\nWhile nursing education curriculums do focus on health disparities prevalent in specific cultures and the importance of culturally competent care, Norman believes that further steps can be taken.\n\n“Although I believe that the profession of nursing is doing a lot, there is still more that needs to be done,” says Norman. “Until all health care disparities are eradicated, there is always more that can be done.”\n\nTips for Nurses to Improve Cultural Competence\n\nCultural competence in nursing helps build a more therapeutic nurse-patient relationship, which leads to better patient outcomes because patients are more likely to follow care plans that take their culture and beliefs into consideration. This guide describes how to build cultural competence in your own work and your team’s.\n\n1\n\nChange Your Perspective\n\nCultural competence in nursing means understanding differences in perspective. For example, calling everyone by their first name immediately after meeting them is a friendly gesture in many parts of the United States. However, it may seem disrespectful to somebody from a culture where young people refer to elders as “Mr.” or “Ms.” Further, ask patients by which pronoun they would prefer to be addressed. Don’t assume. Ask the patient about background, practices, religion, and culture to avoid stereotyping.\n\nIn some Asian and Hispanic cultures, family members may not want the older adults in their family to find out how sick they are when they are diagnosed. Family members fear this knowledge will make their older family members give up.\n\nShowing respect is a fundamental part of how to build cultural competence. “Work from a place of humble partnership instead of from an imbalanced hierarchical notion of caregiver/care-recipient,” says nursing faculty member Caroline Ortiz.\n\n2\n\nShare Something About Your Own Culture That May be Similar to Your Patient’s Culture\n\nEstablishing common ground is another vital part of cultural competence in nursing. Sharing from your own experiences is often part of cultural competency training. Norman points out that “this is just a great way to build rapport with your patient, and helps to break down preconceived barriers.”\n\nFor example, if you are advising a patient about healthy eating, they might mention a favorite dish from their background, a dish that is not very healthy. Rather than saying not to eat it or eat less of it, share about a dish from your background that you might not want to give up, but that you now serve as a side dish rather than an entree, or you substituted ingredients to make it healthier.\n\n3\n\nLearn From Your Coworkers and Colleagues\n\n“Working in a place that has people with different cultures, beliefs, genders, race, and ethnicity helps to foster an environment of belonging,” Norman says. The more that an organization recognizes and treats diversity as an asset, the easier it is to learn cultural competence.\n\nIf people feel encouraged to bring their whole selves to work, staff can develop cultural competence during all their interactions. Informal learning and employee-led initiatives can augment formal cultural competency training. “Inquire about a cultural competency department or task force,” Dr. Gregory Knapik, DNP and assistant professor of nursing, recommends.\n\nBe sure that, as a supervisor, you respect the time and effort to learn or to teach. Avoid making people feel as though they have to be spokespeople for an entire group. For example, ask for “a Hindu perspective” from a Hindu staff member rather than “the Hindu perspective.”\n\nSometimes, you need to respect that your staff member is not up for being a spokesperson at all, that they currently cannot undertake the emotional effort of educating. And that’s okay.\n\n4\n\nLearn a New Language\n\nLearning a new language can help to address many of the language gaps in healthcare. Language barriers have a negative impact on healthcare outcomes and on the satisfaction of both patients and providers.\n\nWhile only qualified medical interpreters should provide interpretation for patients with limited English proficiency, learning medical vocabulary or common expressions creates a welcoming atmosphere and increases trust.\n\nKnowing medical and healthcare vocabulary in another language also helps you understand patients or family members who might speak conversational English fluently, but be less familiar with healthcare terms.\n\nBeing multilingual is an asset for any healthcare job, especially if you speak a language widely spoken in the community, but less common among healthcare workers.\n\n5\n\nComplete Continuing Nursing Education Courses\n\nMany organizations offer cultural competency training for healthcare workers. These include”\n\nThe Office of Minority Health’s free online cultural competency training, including the Cultural Competent Nursing Care course, is designed for online learning. Once you have completed the course, you can lead in-person facilitated sessions.\n\nGeorgetown University’s National Center for Cultural Competence provides online courses in how to build cultural competence with specific audiences.\n\nThe National LGTB Cancer Network offers cultural competency training for oncology professionals.\n\n6\n\nReach Out to Clergy to Understand Different Faiths in Your Community\n\nClergy can provide valuable insights into faith communities and how different faiths perceive issues related to health. These perceptions may affect treatment plans or delivery.\n\nFor example, imams (Muslim clergy) can provide guidance on how to work with patients who wish to fast for Ramadan, but should not because of health considerations.\n\nSimilarly, understanding the Amish belief that the heart is the “soul of the body” can help healthcare workers communicate about heart health to Amish communities. Being able to speak about a faith with knowledge and respect will strengthen communication with patients.\n\n7\n\nSeek Out Opportunities to Work With Local Community Leaders or Organizations\n\nPartnerships with local community leaders and organizations can help build your cultural competence in nursing and establish relationships that lead to stronger relationships. For example, your organization might invite leaders of community organizations to give a talk at your workplace about a particular group and its perceptions and needs.\n\nThis lecture series can lead to building partnerships for health education and health promotion, encouraging speakers of a language to become medical interpreters, or other ways to enhance trust and empathy.\n\nCultural competence in nursing builds a virtuous cycle of improved reputation and trust, leading to better health outcomes.\n\nMeet Our Contributors\n\nJamil Norman, Ph.D., RN, CNE\n\nJamil Norman, Ph.D., RN, CNE, and academic coordinator for Walden University’s RN-to-BSN program, has more than 16 years of experience as a registered nurse and 12 years in higher education.
