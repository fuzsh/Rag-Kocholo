        "text": "Family Medicine and Community Health adheres to the highest standards concerning its editorial policies on publication ethics and scientific misconduct. The journal follows guidance produced by bodies that include the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), the World Association of Medical Editors (WAME), the Council of Science Editors and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). To view all BMJ Journal policies please refer to the BMJ Author Hub policies page, including information about our Editors’ roles and responsibilities. Authors are required to submit a statement that their study obtained ethics approval (or a statement that it was not required and why) and that participants gave informed consent. Our Editors will consider whether the work is morally acceptable as determined by the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. In addition to this, in line with General Medical Council guidelines, an article that contains personal medical information about an identifiable living individual requires patients explicit consent (in the format of a signed BMJ patient consent form) before we will publish it. Please find further details on BMJ research ethics policies (human participants and animals) and consent for publication; including a link to the downloadable consent form.\n\nTo make the best decision on how to deal with a manuscript, Family Medicine and Community Health needs to know about any competing interests authors may have; this includes any commercial, financial or non financial associations that may be relevant to the submitted article. Authors must download and complete a copy of the ICMJE Conflict of Interest disclosure form. In addition to this Family Medicine and Community Health ensures that all advertising and sponsorship associated with the journal does not influence editorial decisions, is immediately distinguishable from editorial content and meets all other BMJ guidelines. Please find more information about competing interests and a link to the form. We take seriously all possible misconduct. If an Editor, author or reader has concerns that a submitted article describes something that might be considered to constitute misconduct in research, publication or professional behaviour they should forward their concerns to the journal. The publisher will deal with allegations appropriately following ICMJE and COPE guidelines. Corrections and retractions are considered where an article has already been published; corrections, expressions of concern or a retraction notices will be published as soon as possible in line with the BMJ correction and retraction policy.\n\nAs an open access journal, Family Medicine and Community Health adheres to the Budapest Open Access Initiative definition of open access. Articles are published under a Creative Commons licence to facilitate reuse of the content and authors retain copyright; please refer to the Family Medicine and Community Health Author Licence. More information on copyright and authors’ rights.\n\nWhen publishing in Family Medicine and Community Health, authors choose between two licence types – CC-BY-NC and CC-BY. As an author you may wish to post your article in an institutional or subject repository, or on a scientific social sharing network. You may also link your published article to your preprint (if applicable). What you can do with your article, without seeking permission, depends on the licence you have chosen and the version of your article. Please refer to the BMJ author self archiving and permissions policies page for more information.\n\nFamily Medicine and Community Health submissions are predominantly unsolicited, all articles are subject to peer review. Family Medicine and Community Health operates double-anonymised peer review which requires authors to submit an anonymous version of their manuscript file (to be uploaded as the Manuscript File including abstract): This file should be anonymous and should NOT include:\n\nAny author names (including file path in document footer)\n\nAuthor institution details\n\nAuthor contact details\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nCompeting interests (if declared)\n\nEthics approval statements that refer to your institution\n\nPlease ensure tracked changes are switched off if previously used; this file will be automatically converted to PDF once uploaded through the online submission system and will be made available to the reviewers\n\nWhen a paper has been submitted from the Editor, Deputy or Associate Editors’ departments, they have no role in the reviewing or decision making process, usually two external reviewer reports are obtained before an Original research or Review article is accepted for publication. This also applies to any Associate Editors who are authors, in which instance the reviewing process is handled by the Editor-in-Chief. For more information on what to expect during the peer review process please refer to BMJ Author Hub – the peer review process. BMJ requests that all reviewers adhere to a set of basic principles and standards during the peer-review process in research publication; these are based on the COPE Ethical Guidelines for Peer Reviewers. Please refer to our peer review terms and conditions policy page. BMJ is committed to transparency. Every article we publish includes a description of its provenance (commissioned or not commissioned) and whether it was internally or externally peer reviewed. Plagiarism is the appropriation of the language, ideas or thoughts of another without crediting their true source and representation of them as one’s own original work. BMJ is a member of CrossCheck by CrossRef and iThenticate. iThenticate is a plagiarism screening service that verifies the originality of content submitted before publication. BMJ runs manuscripts through iThenticate during the peer review process. Authors, researchers and freelancers can also use iThenticate to screen their work before submission by visiting www.ithenticate.com. Reader responses, questions and comments to published content are welcomed by Family Medicine and Community Health; these should be submitted electronically via the journals website. Please find further details on how to publish a response and the terms and requirements.\n\nFamily Medicine and Community Health adheres to BMJ’s Tier 2 data policy. We strongly encourage that data generated by your research that supports your article be made available as soon as possible, wherever legally and ethically possible. We also require data from clinical trials to be made available upon reasonable request. To adhere to ICMJE guidelines, we require that a data sharing plan must be included with trial registration for clinical trials that begin enrolling participants on or after 1st January 2019. Changes to the plan must be noted in the Data Availability Statement and updated in the registry record. All research articles must contain a Data Availability Statement. For more information and FAQs, please see BMJ’s full Data Sharing Policy page. At present there is no major repository for clinical data, but Dryad has declared its willingness to accept medical datasets. Authors can start the deposition process while submitting to any BMJ Journal. Dryad provides authors with a DOI for the dataset to aid citation and provide a permanent link to the data. Note that Dryad hosts data using a CC0 licence so authors should check that this is suitable for the data that they are depositing. The DataCite organisation has a growing list of other repositories for research data.\n\nWe consider that patient and public involvement in healthcare is a core component of FMCH and the BMJ encourages active patient and public involvement in clinical research as part of its patient and public partnership strategy. To support the co-production of research, we request that authors provide a Patient and Public Involvement statement in the methods section of their papers, under the subheading ‘Patient and public involvement’. We appreciate that patient and public involvement is relatively new and may not be feasible or appropriate for all papers. We, therefore, continue to consider papers where patients were not involved. The Patient and Public Involvement statement should provide a brief response to the following questions, tailored as appropriate for the study design reported:\n\nAt what stage in the research process were patients/the public first involved in the research and how?\n\nHow were the research question(s) and outcome measures developed and informed by their priorities, experience, and preferences?\n\nHow were patients/the public involved in the design of this study?\n\nHow were they involved in the recruitment to and conduct of the study?\n\nWere they asked to assess the burden of the intervention and the time required to participate in the research?\n\nHow were (or will) they be involved in your plans to disseminate the study results to participants and relevant wider patient communities (e.g. by choosing what information/results to share, when, and in what format)?\n\nIf patients or members of the public were not involved, please add the reason(s) written in your own words (e.g.) funding or training restrictions, access to software, COVID etc.; also, it may be that speaking to patients inspired this review if this was the case it is fine to add that although there was no direct PPI in this paper we did speak to patients about the study and we asked a member of the public to read our manuscript after submission. For original research or education papers, please place the PPI declaration at the end of the methods. For other articles, we suggest adding a PPI statement before the results and the conclusion. If the Patient and Public Involvement statement is missing in the submitted manuscript, we will request that the authors provide it. In addition to considering the points above, we advise authors to look at the guidance for best reporting of patient and public involvement as set out in the GRIPP2 reporting checklist. The journal is also committed to patient and public involvement in the editorial process, including peer review and the generation of patient-authored contents.\n\nPlease review the below article type specifications including the required article lengths, illustrations, table limits and reference counts. The word count excludes the title page, abstract, tables, acknowledgements, contributions and references. Manuscripts should be as succinct as possible. For further support when making your submission please refer to the resources available on the BMJ Author Hub. Here you will find information on writing and formatting your research through to the peer review process and promoting your paper. We encourage authors to ensure that research articles are written in accordance with the relevant research reporting guidelines. Please see the SPIRIT-AI Extension and CONSORT-AI Extension for AI trials where applicable. Please refer to the following reporting guidance: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27198112 You may also wish to use the language editing and translation services provided by BMJ Author Services. These services are paid for by the author and do not guarantee that your paper will be considered or accepted by the journal.\n\nOriginal research articles address specific open-ended and closed-ended questions through both predetermined and emerging methods. The research question should be clearly defined and answered through the results of statistical and/or text analysis informed by health science and social science theory. The collected data could be both quantitative and qualitative data, but the legality and ethical considerations of data collection procedure are crucial. Research reviews that systematically synthesise evidence (e.g. Systematic reviews, Meta-analysis, Scoping reviews, Mixed methods reviews, etc) should be submitted as Systematic reviews. Original research papers should follow the basic structure of title, key point, abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusion, references, and tables and figures as appropriate. Please find the FMCH manuscript strucuture checklist for original research here. All original research articles should have a Patient and Public Involvement statement. Supplementary and raw data can be placed online separately from the text, and we may request that you separate out some material into supplementary data files to make the main manuscript clearer for readers. We recommend authors use the appropriate equator network reporting guidelines prior to submission such as: Randomized trials: CONSORT Checklists Observational studies: STROBE Checklists Qualitative studies: COREQ Checklist Mixed methods research: MMAT VERSION 2018 Quality improvement studies: SQUIRE 2.0 Checklist Implementation studies: StaRI checklist FMCH also encourages authors using SAMPL Guidelines to check basic statistical reporting.\n\nPlease include the key messages of your article after your abstract using the following headings.
