        "text": "Every day, millions of Australians come into contact with the health system. It may be through health promotion and disease prevention programs such as school-based vaccinations; an appointment with a general practitioner (GP); a visit to the pharmacist to pick up a prescription; or a more complex interaction, such as being admitted to hospital for surgery. A key role of the health system is to respond to these individual needs by providing safe, effective, accessible and appropriate treatment and other services.\n\nAustralia’s health system is a complex mix of service providers and other health professionals across a range of organisations. These include Australian and state and territory government and private sector service providers. Collectively, the health system works to meet the physical and mental health care needs of Australians.\n\nThe complex structure of Australia’s health system is reflected in its funding arrangements. The health system is funded by Australian and state and territory governments as well as non-government funders such as private health insurers and individuals.\n\nFor information on how much is spent on health goods and services, the sources of health funding and trends in the distribution of health spending, see Health expenditure.\n\nThe health system is not the only system playing a part in health outcomes. Health can be influenced by many other factors, including social and economic factors like education, housing and employment. For more information, see Social determinants of health and What are determinants of health?\n\nWho is responsible for the health system?\n\nThe Australian and state and territory governments broadly share responsibility for funding, operating, managing and regulating the health system. The private for-profit and not-for-profit sectors also play a role in operating public and private hospitals, GP surgeries, pharmacies and medical practices, specialist clinics, dental clinics as well as providing private health insurance products (Department of Health 2019).\n\nHealth services are delivered by a range of health professionals working in a variety of settings, from large hospitals (in capital cities and regional centres) to small health clinics (such as those in remote areas). Australia’s health workforce includes GPs, surgeons and other medical specialists, nurses and midwives, dentists, allied health practitioners including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers, paramedics and administrative and other support staff. For more information, see Health workforce.\n\nA variety of organisations support health services. Government health departments and other agencies are responsible for policy and service planning. Government departments, and research and statistical organisations collect and publish information on Australians’ health status and health conditions, use of health services and the performance of the health system. Universities and health services train health professionals. Consumer and advocacy groups have a role in public debates on policies and regulation. Voluntary and community organisations also provide support directly to individuals, as well as fundraising for research and awareness raising through health advocacy programs.\n\nAustralia also has Primary Health Networks, which are independent organisations funded by the Australian government to support local communities connecting with the health services they need, where and when they need them. Primary Health Networks work directly with GPs, other primary care providers, secondary care providers and hospitals (Department of Health 2021b).\n\nRole of government\n\nThrough the Health Ministers’ Meeting (HMM), state and territory government health ministers, together with the Australian Government Minister for Health and Aged Care, work together to shape Australia’s health system with the aim of improving health outcomes and ensuring the sustainability (Department of Health and Aged Care 2023a).\n\nThe main roles of each level of government in Australia’s health system are:\n\nThe Australian Government:\n\ndevelops national health policy\n\nfunds medical services through Medicare and medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)\n\nprovides funds to states and territories for public hospital services\n\nfunds population-specific services, including community-controlled Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander primary health care, health services for veterans, and residential aged care\n\nfunds health and medical research\n\nregulates medicines and medical devices\n\nsupports access to, and regulates, private health insurance.\n\nState and territory governments:\n\nfund and manage public hospitals\n\nregulate and license private hospitals and other health premises\n\nregulate products with health impacts such as alcohol and tobacco\n\ndeliver community-based and preventive services (for example, cancer screening and immunisation), ambulance services, and address complaints.\n\nLocal governments in some jurisdictions can be involved in:\n\ndelivery of community and home-based health and support services\n\nenvironmental health services (for example, waste disposal, water fluoridation)\n\npublic health activities.\n\nAdditionally, all levels of government have shared responsibilities, including education and training of health professionals, regulation of the health workforce, food standards and safety, improving the safety and quality of health care and funding of programs and services (Biggs and Cook 2018; Department of Health 2019; Duckett and Willcox 2015).\n\nWhat services are available?\n\nMany services are required to meet the health needs of Australians and deliver a high-quality health system. These include:\n\nHealth promotion and health protection and disease prevention programs, which focus on improving health and preventing the root causes of ill health. This includes immunisation and vaccination, healthy lifestyle initiatives and cancer screening.\n\nPrimary care, which is often a person’s first contact with the health system. It comprises frequently accessed services including general practice, allied health and other primary care services, dispensing medicines, and community health.\n\nSpecialist care, which provides services for those with specific or complex conditions or issues. This includes mental health services, cancer treatment, alcohol and other drug treatment services, palliative care and clinical assessment for surgery. Specialist care also includes pathology, imaging and other diagnostic services and referred medical specialist services, where the patient’s presentation to the specialist is recommended by another medical practitioner.\n\nHospitals, where health services are provided to admitted and non-admitted patients (outpatient clinics and Emergency Department care).\n\nMost Australians have exposure to preventive health measures across their life, from educational campaigns to free vaccines. Australians can utilise health services as needed, dependent on their health needs and personal circumstances.\n\nMedicare\n\nAustralia’s health system is underpinned by Medicare – a universal health insurance scheme. Medicare pays rebates for medical services and procedures provided by private practitioners in the community such as GPs and other medical practitioners, and ensures Australians have access to free hospital services for public patients in public hospitals and a range of prescription pharmaceuticals subsidised under the PBS (Biggs 2016).\n\nMedicare is currently available to Australian and New Zealand citizens, permanent residents in Australia, and people from countries with reciprocal agreements (Department of Health 2019). People outside these categories have to pay full fees for health services or take out private health insurance (Private Health Insurance Ombudsman n.d.).\n\nFor more information, see Medicines in the health system, Referred medical specialist attendances, Pathology, imaging and other diagnostic services and General practice, allied health and other primary care services.\n\nPrivate health insurance\n\nSome medical and allied health services are not subsidised through Medicare. For example, Medicare does not usually cover costs for ambulance services, most dental services and optical aids (such as glasses and contact lenses).\n\nFor these services, private health insurance is one option for managing health care costs (Department of Health 2021a). Private health insurance can also give people with cover the option to avoid waiting lists in the public system and the ability to choose their own doctor (Biggs and Cook 2018).\n\nThe Australian Government offers a means-tested rebate to people who hold private health insurance and imposes the Medicare Levy Surcharge on higher-income earners who do not have an appropriate level of private patient hospital cover (ATO 2023).\n\nHospitals\n\nHospitals are an important part of the health system, providing a range of services to many people in need. Australians admitted to public hospitals should have access to fee-free treatment as public patients (Department of Health and Aged Care 2023b). Public hospitals are largely owned and managed by state and territory governments. The Australian Government contributes to state and territory public hospital funding through the National Health Reform Agreement (Department of Health and Aged Care 2023c).\n\nPrivate hospitals are owned and run by the private sector, including both for-profit companies and not-for-profit organisations. Private hospitals charge for their services and receive income from:\n\nprivate health insurers\n\npatients (who pay out-of-pocket expenses not covered by their health insurance policy, and any excess payments based on their policy)\n\nthe Australian Government (through private health insurance rebates, the Department of Veteran’s Affairs and Medicare Benefits Schedule claims)\n\nstate and territory governments when they contract private hospitals to deliver public hospital services (Department of Health and Aged Care 2023d).\n\nFor more information, see Hospitals.\n\nHealth system challenges\n\nAustralia’s health system faces complex challenges. Some have the potential to influence patient experiences, the delivery of services and quality of care. The COVID-19 pandemic is a recent example of this. The pandemic transformed the way Australians used health services and how they were delivered. Throughout the pandemic, some services were suspended and/or forced to transition to telehealth. Hospitals experienced increased demand as COVID-19 cases and admissions rose and some people were hesitant to seek health care for fear of contracting COVID-19 (AIHW 2022).\n\nExamples of other health system challenges in Australia include:\n\nDigital health technologies: Australia’s health sector has a long history of using innovative technologies to improve health care delivery, empower health care users and providers to better manage health outcomes, and strengthen data systems. However, not all health providers and consumers have the same access to and experience with digital technologies. For more information, see Digital health.\n\nGood health data: While there are good quality health data available in Australia, some health data gaps remain. These gaps in comprehensive and quality information in crucial areas of the health system can limit the capacity for population health monitoring, research, planning and policy development. It can also create an imbalance in understanding the health system as a whole. For example, the relative lack of data for primary health care makes it difficult to assess the positive impact of the primary health care sector on the health of Australians or to identify where improvements are needed. Data linkage can support more meaningful insights by enabling data from one database to supplement data in another. For more information, see Australia’s health 2024: data insights article Australia’s health data landscape.\n\nAgeing population: As life expectancy and the number of older people in Australia continues to grow, understanding the diversity within older population groups and catering to changes in health care needs and the demand for health care is becoming even more important. For more information, see Health of older people.\n\nChronic conditions: Chronic conditions are a leading cause of poor health, disability and premature death in Australia and continue to place a large demand on both the primary care and hospital system. As the proportion of people living with 2 or more chronic conditions continues to rise, so does the need for services from multiple providers, across multiple systems such as aged care, disability, education and social services. For more information see, Australia’s health 2024: data insights article The ongoing challenge of chronic conditions in Australia.\n\nFor more information, see COVID-19, Social determinants of health, What are determinants of health? and Australia’s health 2024: data insights article Enhancing communicable disease monitoring in Australia through data linkage.\n\nNational Health Reform Agreement\n\nThe National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA) serves as a foundation for cooperation and financial agreements between the Australian Government and the state and territory governments, facilitating the delivery of health services. Its overarching goal is to establish a unified, effective, fair and sustainable healthcare system nationwide (Department of Health and Aged Care 2023c).\n\nA comprehensive mid-term review of the NHRA Addendum 2020–2025 in 2023 put forward 45 recommendations. These recommendations aim to capitalise on the existing strengths of the NHRA while introducing innovative reforms to fortify the health system against current and future challenges. The review highlights key recommendations separated into 10 themes. These are considered pivotal for ensuring the security and sustainability of Australia's healthcare system and include:\n\nA shared whole of health system agreement with the right architecture and governance.\n\nA focus and platform for intersectoral collaboration\n\nOptimal models of care\n\nEnabling transparency, adequacy and risk sharing through financing reform\n\nProgressing long-term health reforms\n\nRural and remote service delivery that is for purpose\n\nClear commitment to closing the gap for First Nations people\n\nEmbedding workforce and digital health as key enablers of the health system\n\nMeasuring the success of the Agreement\n\nLearning from COVID-19 and preparing for future events\n\nFor more detailed information on the key recommendations of the NHRA, see Mid-Term Review of the National Health Reform Agreement Addendum 2020–2025.\n\nWhere do I go for more information?\n\nFor more information on the health system, see:\n\nAustralia’s Health Performance Framework\n\nDepartment of Health and Aged Care The Australian health system\n\nDepartment of Health and Aged Care Mid-Term Review of the National Health Reform Agreement Addendum 2020-2025: Key recommendations from the Review\n\nAIHW (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare) (2022) Australia’s Health 2022: Data insights, AIHW website, accessed 4 December 2023.\n\nATO (Australian Taxation Office) (2023) Medicare levy, ATO website, accessed 18 October 2023.\n\nBiggs A (2016) Medicare: a quick guide, Department of Parliamentary Services, Australian Government, accessed 18 October 2023.\n\nBiggs A and Cook L (2018) Health in Australia: a quick guide, Department of Parliamentary Services, Australian Government, accessed 18 October 2023.\n\nDepartment of Health (2019) The Australian health system, Department of Health and Aged Care, Australian Government, accessed 18 October 2023.\n\nDepartment of Health (2021a) About private health insurance, Department of Health and Aged Care, Australian Government, accessed 31 October 2023.\n\nDepartment of Health (2021b) What Primary Health Networks are, Department of Health and Aged Care, Australian Government, accessed 15 March 2024.\n\nDepartment of Health and Aged Care (2023a) Health Ministers’ Meeting (HMM), Department of Health and Aged Care, Australian Government, accessed 23 October 2023.\n\nDepartment of Health and Aged Care (2023b) Medicare billing in public hospitals – overview, Department of Health and Aged Care, accessed 17 October 2023.\n\nDepartment of Health and Aged Care (2023c) 2020–25 National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA), Department of Health and Aged Care, accessed 31 October 2023.\n\nDepartment of Health and Aged Care (2023d) Private hospitals, Department of Health and Aged Care, accessed 2 November 2023.\n\nDuckett S and Willcox S (2015) The Australian health care system, 5th edn, Oxford University Press, Melbourne.\n\nPrivate Health Insurance Ombudsman (n.d.)
