        "text": "Wal-Mart has a limited benefit plan, called Starbridge.\n\nFast-Growing Health Plan Has\n\nA Catch: $1,000-a-Year Cap\n\nEmployees Pay $10 or So Weekly, for Basics\n\nThat Provide Little Help for Serious Illness\n\nBy CHAD TERHUNE\n\nStaff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nFor legions of Americans with no health insurance, a policy known as\n\n\"limited benefit\" sounds like an appealing choice. Premiums are often\n\nonly about $10 a week. But there's a big catch: For basic medical care,\n\nit often pays only $1,000 a year -- so little that some question whether\n\nit amounts to health insurance at all.\n\nThe policies are among the fastest-growing health-insurance offerings\n\nin the workplace. Sold by half a dozen insurance companies, they cover\n\nan estimated 750,000 employees and family members. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,\n\nMcDonald's Corp. and Lowe's Cos. are among major companies making them\n\navailable to their employees.\n\nYoshiko Craig, a receptionist in Duluth, Ga., bought such coverage in\n\nApril 1998. She used most of a 50-cent raise she had just gotten, to\n\n$7.75 an hour, to buy the plan through her employer, the big Regis Corp.\n\nhair-salon chain. It cost $16 a week and capped her basic benefits at\n\n$1,000 a year, although, as with most such plans, it let her collect a\n\nfew thousand dollars more if injured in an accident or hospitalized. Age\n\n61 at the time, Mrs. Craig remembers thinking that she didn't expect to\n\nbecome seriously ill.\n\nFive months later, she learned she had breast cancer. Following surgery\n\nand chemotherapy, Mrs. Craig found herself facing medical bills of\n\n$85,000. Ever since, she and her husband have been paying about $10,000\n\na year toward their medical debt.\n\n\"The insurance wasn't any help,\" Mrs. Craig says.\n\nSome health-care advocates and industry executives are highly skeptical\n\nof plans such as hers. At one insurance-company meeting last year, a\n\nroomful of agents burst into laughter when an executive described a\n\nlimited-benefit plan. \"I see no value in a $1,000 policy,\" says John\n\nHartnedy, Arkansas' deputy insurance commissioner, who says what people\n\nreally need is coverage for major illnesses.\n\nThe plans spotlight the growing disparity at many companies between the\n\ntreatment of higher-ranking employees -- who generally get comprehensive\n\nhealth-insurance policies -- and hourly workers, who tend to be the\n\nlowest-paid and least able to cope with medical costs.\n\nSupporters of the limited-benefit plans say their critics don't take\n\ninto account economic realities facing the working poor. \"It's easy for\n\nsomeone to say it's a nothing program when they have money in the bank,\n\ncredit cards in their wallet and nice health insurance,\" says Charles\n\nShoumaker, a former human-resources manager who helped launch the\n\nlimited plans more than a decade ago. \"They don't realize that $1,000 is\n\na lot of money to the working poor.\"\n\nAdolfo Gutierrez, an hourly employee at an Austin, Texas, restaurant in\n\nthe Schlotzsky's Deli chain, found value in his $1,000-limit plan. It\n\nsaved him a couple of hundred dollars when he sprained his hand playing\n\nbasketball last year and had to go to an emergency room for a splint.\n\nThis week, he got treatment for a rash on his hands and didn't pay\n\nanything at the doctor's office. \"Having health insurance is wonderful,\"\n\nsays Mr. Gutierrez, 22, whose employer, unlike most, paid the premium.\n\nDefenders say the simple act of giving low-income workers an insurance\n\ncard can encourage them to seek routine preventive care. They contend\n\nthat some measure of health coverage, however small, is better than\n\nnone.\n\nCost Conscious\n\nSome employers also say this is all they can afford, with the economy\n\nin low gear and health-care expenses soaring. The cost to employers of\n\nproviding comprehensive health benefits has risen 57% in five years, to\n\n$5,646 per employee, according to Mercer Human Resource Consulting.\n\nBy offering limited-benefit plans, meanwhile, employers are able to\n\ntell new low-level workers that health insurance is available through\n\nthe job, even though most employers pay nothing toward it.\n\nThink of it as getting insurance for the price of a movie or a few\n\nbeers, some employers and insurance agents tell workers.\n\nEnrollment in the limited-benefit health plans has grown about 20% in\n\neach of the past two years. Insurers sell them solely through employers.\n\nThe employers make them available chiefly to hourly workers, either\n\nfull- or part-time, and collect the premiums by payroll deduction. The\n\ncompanies, many in the service sector, typically find that 10% to 30% of\n\neligible workers purchase the coverage.\n\nAn employee-benefits administrator dreamed up the plans in 1986. The\n\ninitial idea was that the plans might help businesses retain certain\n\ncategories of workers, such as veterans and minorities, that entitled\n\nthe employers to a tax credit. The benefits firm, Strategic Resource Co.\n\nin Columbia, S.C., lined up an underwriter and later began marketing the\n\nplans widely.\n\nA couple of years later, Mr. Shoumaker developed his own version, while\n\nhe was human-resources manager for Circle K convenience stores. He\n\nstarted a firm to market it, Star Human Resources Group Inc. He found\n\ncorporate executives dubious of a $1,000 health policy. \"Many felt\n\nembarrassed to take anything that low,\" he says.\n\nThey grew more comfortable after Star signed up McDonald's in 1994, and\n\nthen retailer Target Corp. a year later. McDonald's says about 12,500 of\n\n250,000 hourly employees at its corporate-owned and franchised\n\nrestaurants are enrolled in limited-benefit insurance. The chain offers\n\nthose hourly employees more-comprehensive health insurance but at a\n\nhigher price.\n\nSLIM OPTIONS\n\nSome features of one of the limited-benefit health plans offered at\n\nRegis Corp., through UICI.\n\n* Basic annual benefit: $1,000*\n\n* Weekly premium for an individual: $6.92\n\n* Weekly premium for a family: $21.55\n\n* Basic deductible: $50\n\n* Doctor visits: $15 copay\n\n* Accident benefit: $5,000, up to two a year, insurer pays 80% of\n\ncovered expenses\n\n* Accidental-death benefit: $10,000\n\n*Per insured person\n\nSource: Regis\n\nEmployers readily concede the plans offer scant help with a serious\n\nillness. The average cost of a hospital stay in 2001 was $13,685,\n\naccording to Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co. study. Employers and\n\ninsurance agents say they make sure workers understand what the\n\ninsurance can and can't do.\n\n\"The concern is they understand it is a limited benefit, so we don't\n\nhave someone enrolled in the plan who has open-heart surgery and thinks\n\nthey have coverage for $100,000,\" says Bob Ihrie, a vice president at\n\nLowe's. The home-improvement retailer offers part-time employees a\n\nchoice of two Allstate Corp. plans with maximum annual benefits of\n\n$2,500 or $5,000. To avoid confusion with broader, largely company-paid\n\ninsurance for full-time employees, the company schedules enrollment on\n\nits limited-benefit plans at a different time of the year. Some\n\nemployers require insurance agents to come to their premises and explain\n\nthe plans to potential buyers.\n\nSome insurance companies have tried offering low-cost policies that\n\ncover \"catastrophic\" health costs. But industry officials say low-income\n\nemployees haven't shown much interest because such plans require high\n\ndeductibles -- perhaps a couple of thousand dollars -- before coverage\n\nkicks in. Low-wage workers are more interested in something that covers\n\nbasic expenses, insurers say.\n\n'Adverse Selection'\n\nAnother problem insurers cite in trying to offer a low-cost plan with\n\npotentially large payouts is \"adverse selection\": Disproportionate\n\npurchasing by people whose health is poor, and who are likely to use a\n\nlot of the benefits. With employer-sponsored plans, health insurers\n\ncannot reject applicants on the basis of their health.\n\nMrs. Craig, the hair-salon receptionist in Georgia, recovered from the\n\ncancer that struck soon after she bought a limited-benefit plan. But the\n\nbills were daunting. Indeed, a serious medical problem such as hers is a\n\nfactor behind about half of the nation's 1.5 million bankruptcy filings,\n\naccording to Harvard researchers who study the issue. Mrs. Craig\n\nrejected the bankruptcy route. The doctors \"saved my life\" and deserve\n\nto be paid, says Mrs. Craig, now 66.\n\nShe and her husband, William, a 69-year-old retired farm-equipment\n\nsalesman, paid a deposit to each medical provider and began sending\n\nmonthly checks. They've whittled their balance to $28,000.\n\nAlthough a limited plan was of scant value to Mrs. Craig, it can be a\n\nbig help for an employer, with few costs. Even the expense of enrollment\n\nis largely borne by insurance companies or their agents.\n\n\"We wanted to do something that would attract and retain people and\n\ngive them the ability to have some insurance,\" says Jan Cohen, managing\n\ndirector of benefits at Budget Rent A Car System, a unit of Cendant\n\nCorp. About a hundred of Budget's 1,800 part-time employees purchased a\n\nlimited policy.\n\nThe early architects of the plans figured that price would be key for\n\nlower-income workers, so they set weekly premiums at equal to just one\n\nto two hours' wages. Those premiums, in turn, dictated low levels of\n\nbenefits: from $1,000 to a few thousand dollars per year for basics such\n\nas emergency-room care and doctor visits.\n\nSome in the insurance industry have a hard time taking this coverage\n\nseriously. A gathering of 300 insurance agents in Las Vegas erupted into\n\nlaughter last summer when an insurance-company executive explained a\n\nlimited-benefit plan offered by Star Human Resources. \"The annual cap is\n\n$1,000. That's not the deductible,\" said Gregory Mutz, CEO of Dallas\n\ninsurer UICI, which had just acquired Star from Mr. Shoumaker.\n\nMr. Mutz told the agents not to laugh. Economically, the potential\n\ncustomers \"are at the bottom of the food chain,\" he said. \"I don't want\n\nto make fun\" of this coverage.\n\nAllstate, Safeco Corp. and CNA Financial Corp. have also thrown their\n\nformidable brand names behind limited-benefit plans. At CNA, which\n\nunderwrites Strategic Resources' plans and has just begun offering one\n\nof its own, \"This is an area we would like to grow aggressively,\" says a\n\nvice president, Douglas Hayes.\n\nRestrictions Apply\n\nOne of the selling points to employees is that the plans will cover\n\ntheir everyday medical expenses. Still, the policies have restrictions\n\nsuch as waiting periods for \"wellness checks\" and for treatment of\n\npre-existing conditions. They also involve deductibles that\n\npolicyholders must pay each year before benefits kick in.\n\nMrs. Craig's plan imposed a $150 annual deductible, and it required $10\n\ncopayments for doctor visits. Besides the $1,000 basic annual benefit,\n\nshe could collect a $500-a-day reimbursement for up to five days of\n\nhospitalization a year. The policy also offered up to $2,000 a year for\n\nsurgery and $5,000 for an accident, up to two of them a year. She paid\n\nan extra $3 a week to get some dental and vision coverage.\n\n\"The plan is a rip-off,\" says Beth Todd, a 28-year-old who enrolled in\n\na limited-benefit plan at another Regis hair salon, in Asheville, N.C.,\n\nin 1999. She says she canceled the policy after less than a year because\n\nit paid so little toward her treatment for a sinus infection and\n\nmigraines.\n\nRegis's chief financial officer, Randy Pearce, says limited-benefit\n\nplans don't fit every worker's needs. \"But I think people vote with\n\ntheir wallet,\" he says, \"and we have more than 7,000 employees\n\nenrolled,\" or about 20% of its U.S. work force.\n\nSome smaller companies are beginning to drop comprehensive health\n\ninsurance in favor of these scaled-down, employee-paid plans. Duane\n\nZuber, part-owner of a Comfort Inn in Grand Rapids, Mich., says he did\n\nso when the state's Blue Cross Blue Shield carrier raised his\n\nhealth-insurance premiums on five employees and their families by 24% --\n\nin a year when his revenue was down 7%. To contain his health-insurance\n\ncost, Mr. Zuber ended comprehensive coverage for two employees and\n\noffered them a limited-benefit plan.\n\nMariah Tompkins, a clerk earning $8.25 an hour, was one of the two. Now\n\nthe 20-year-old spends $9.95 a week on a limited-benefit plan, which\n\nwill pay $50 per visit for up to five emergency-room or doctor visits a\n\nyear, plus extra amounts for hospitalization or car accidents. \"It's\n\nkind of annoying I have less now,\" Ms. Tompkins says. \"I would like to\n\nhave good insurance.\""
