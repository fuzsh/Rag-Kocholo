and\n\n(3) such other diagnostic or therapeutic items or services, furnished by the hospital or by others under arrangements with them made by the hospital, as are ordinarily furnished to inpatients either by such hospital or by others under such arrangements;\n\nexcluding, however—\n\n(4) medical or surgical services provided by a physician, resident, or intern, services described by subsection (s)(2)(K), certified nurse-midwife services, qualified psychologist services, and services of a certified registered nurse anesthetist; and\n\n(5) the services of a private-duty nurse or other private-duty attendant.\n\nParagraph (4) shall not apply to services provided in a hospital by—\n\n(6) an intern or a resident-in-training under a teaching program approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association or, in the case of an osteopathic hospital, approved by the Committee on Hospitals of the Bureau of Professional Education of the American Osteopathic Association, or, in the case of services in a hospital or osteopathic hospital by an intern or resident-in-training in the field of dentistry, approved by the Council on Dental Education of the American Dental Association, or in the case of services in a hospital or osteopathic hospital by an intern or resident-in-training in the field of podiatry, approved by the Council on Podiatric Medical Education of the American Podiatric Medical Association;

except that until January 1, 1979, the Secretary is authorized to waive the requirement of this paragraph for any one-year period with respect to any institution, insofar as such requirement relates to the provision of twenty-four-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse (except that in any event a registered professional nurse must be present on the premises to render or supervise the nursing service provided, during at least the regular daytime shift), where immediately preceding such one-year period he finds that—\n\n(A) such institution is located in a rural area and the supply of hospital services in such area is not sufficient to meet the needs of individuals residing therein,\n\n(B) the failure of such institution to qualify as a hospital would seriously reduce the availability of such services to such individuals, and\n\n(C) such institution has made and continues to make a good faith effort to comply with this paragraph, but such compliance is impeded by the lack of qualified nursing personnel in such area;\n\n(6)(A) has in effect a hospital utilization review plan which meets the requirements of subsection (k) and\n\n(B) has in place a discharge planning process that meets the requirements of subsection (ee);\n\n(7) in the case of an institution in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals, (A) is licensed pursuant to such law or (B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established for such licensing;\n\n(8) has in effect an overall plan and budget that meets the requirements of subsection (z); and\n\n(9) meets such other requirements as the Secretary finds necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution.\n\nFor purposes of subsection (a)(2), such term includes any institution which meets the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection. For purposes of sections 1814(d) and 1835(b) (including determination of whether an individual received inpatient hospital services or diagnostic services for purposes of such sections), section 1814(f)(2), and subsection (i) of this section, such term includes any institution which (i) meets the requirements of paragraphs (5) and (7) of this subsection, (ii) is not primarily engaged in providing the services described in section 1861(j)(1)(A) and (iii) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of individuals referred to in paragraph (1) of section 1861(r), to inpatients diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons. For purposes of section 1814(f)(1), such term includes an institution which (i) is a hospital for purposes of sections 1814(d), 1814(f)(2), and 1835(b) and (ii) is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, or is accredited by or approved by a program of the country in which such institution is located if the Secretary finds the accreditation or comparable approval standards of such program to be essentially equivalent to those of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, such term shall not, except for purposes of subsection (a)(2), include any institution which is primarily for the care and treatment of mental diseases unless it is a psychiatric hospital (as defined in subsection (f)). The term “hospital” also includes a religious nonmedical health care institution (as defined in subsection (ss)(1)), with respect to items and services ordinarily furnished by such institution to inpatients, and payment may be made with respect to services provided by or in such an institution only to such extent and under such conditions, limitations, and requirements (in addition to or in lieu of the conditions, limitations, and requirements otherwise applicable) as may be provided in regulations consistent with section 1821. For provisions deeming certain requirements of this subsection to be met in the case of accredited institutions, see section 1865. The term “hospital” also includes a facility of fifty beds or less which is located in an area determined by the Secretary to meet the definition relating to a rural area described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (5) of this subsection and which meets the other requirements of this subsection, except that—\n\n(A) with respect to the requirements for nursing services applicable after December 31, 1978, such requirements shall provide for temporary waiver of the requirements, for such period as the Secretary deems appropriate, where (i) the facility’s failure to fully comply with the requirements is attributable to a temporary shortage of qualified nursing personnel in the area in which the facility is located, (ii) a registered professional nurse is present on the premises to render or supervise the nursing service provided during at least the regular daytime shift, and (iii) the Secretary determines that the employment of such nursing personnel as are available to the facility during such temporary period will not adversely affect the health and safety of patients;\n\n(B) with respect to the health and safety requirements promulgated under paragraph (9), such requirements shall be applied by the Secretary to a facility herein defined in such manner as to assure that personnel requirements take into account the availability of technical personnel and the educational opportunities for technical personnel in the area in which such facility is located, and the scope of services rendered by such facility; and the Secretary, by regulations, shall provide for the continued participation of such a facility where such personnel requirements are not fully met, for such period as the Secretary determines that (i) the facility is making good faith efforts to fully comply with the personnel requirements, (ii) the employment by the facility of such personnel as are available to the facility will not adversely affect the health and safety of patients, and (iii) if the Secretary has determined that because of the facility’s waiver under this subparagraph the facility should limit its scope of services in order not to adversely affect the health and safety of the facility’s patients, the facility is so limiting the scope of services it provides; and\n\n(C) with respect to the fire and safety requirements promulgated under paragraph (9), the Secretary (i) may waive, for such period as he deems appropriate, specific provisions of such requirements which if rigidly applied would result in unreasonable hardship for such a facility and which, if not applied, would not jeopardize the health and safety of patients, and (ii) may accept a facility’s compliance with all applicable State codes relating to fire and safety in lieu of compliance with the fire and safety requirements promulgated under paragraph (9), if he determines that such State has in effect fire and safety codes, imposed by State law, which adequately protect patients.\n\nThe term “hospital” does not include, unless the context otherwise requires, a critical access hospital (as defined in section 1861(mm)(1)).\n\nPsychiatric Hospital\n\n(f) The term “psychiatric hospital” means an institution which—\n\n(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of a physician, psychiatric services for the diagnosis and treatment of mentally ill persons;\n\n(2) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (3) through (9) of subsection (e);\n\n(3) maintains clinical records on all patients and maintains such records as the Secretary finds to be necessary to determine the degree and intensity of the treatment provided to individuals entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A; and\n\n(4) meets such staffing requirements as the Secretary finds necessary for the institution to carry out an active program of treatment for individuals who are furnished services in the institution.\n\nIn the case of an institution which satisfies paragraphs (1) and (2) of the preceding sentence and which contains a distinct part which also satisfies paragraphs (3) and (4) of such sentence, such distinct part shall be considered to be a “psychiatric hospital”.\n\nOutpatient Occupational Therapy Services\n\n(g) The term “outpatient occupational therapy services” has the meaning given the term “outpatient physical therapy services” in subsection (p), except that “occupational” shall be substituted for “physical” each place it appears therein.\n\nExtended Care Services\n\n(h) The term “extended care services” means the following items and services furnished to an inpatient of a skilled nursing facility and (except as provided in paragraphs (3), (6), and (7)) by such skilled nursing facility—\n\n(1) nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse;\n\n(2) bed and board in connection with the furnishing of such nursing care;\n\n(3) physical or occupational therapy or speech-language pathology services furnished by the skilled nursing facility or by others under arrangements with them made by the facility;\n\n(4) medical social services;\n\n(5) such drugs, biologicals, supplies, appliances, and equipment, furnished for use in the skilled nursing facility, as are ordinarily furnished by such facility for the care and treatment of inpatients;\n\n(6) medical services provided by an intern or resident-in-training of a hospital with which the facility has in effect a transfer agreement (meeting the requirements of subsection (l)), under a teaching program of such hospital approved as provided in the last sentence of subsection (b), and other diagnostic or therapeutic services provided by a hospital with which the facility has such an agreement in effect; and\n\n(7) such other services necessary to the health of the patients as are generally provided by skilled nursing facilities, or by others under arrangements with them made by the facility; able).\n\nexcluding, however, any item or service if it would not be included under subsection (b) if furnished to an inpatient of a hospital.\n\nPost-Hospital Extended Care Services\n\n(i) The term “post-hospital extended care services” means extended care services furnished an individual after transfer from a hospital in which he was an inpatient for not less than 3 consecutive days before his discharge from the hospital in connection with such transfer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, items and services shall be deemed to have been furnished to an individual after transfer from a hospital, and he shall be deemed to have been an inpatient in the hospital immediately before transfer therefrom, if he is admitted to the skilled nursing facility (A) within 30 days after discharge from such hospital, or (B) within such time as it would be medically appropriate to begin an active course of treatment, in the case of an individual whose condition is such that skilled nursing facility care would not be medically appropriate within 30 days after discharge from a hospital; and an individual shall be deemed not to have been discharged from a skilled nursing facility if, within 30 days after discharge therefrom, he is admitted to such facility or any other skilled nursing facility.\n\nSkilled Nursing Facility\n\n(j) The term “skilled nursing facility” has the meaning given such term in section 1819(a).\n\nUtilization Review\n\n(k) A utilization review plan of a hospital or skilled nursing facility shall be considered sufficient if it is applicable to services furnished by the institution to individuals entitled to insurance benefits under this title and if it provides—\n\n(1) for the review, on a sample or other basis, of admissions to the institution, the duration of stays therein, and the professional services (including drugs and biologicals) furnished, (A) with respect to the medical necessity of the services, and (B) for the purpose of promoting the most efficient use of available health facilities and services;\n\n(2) for such review to be made by either (A) a staff committee of the institution composed of two or more physicians (of which at least two must be physicians described in subsection (r)(1) of this section), with or without pa rticipation of other professional personnel, or (B) a group outside the institution which is similarly composed and (i) which is established by the local medical society and some or all of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in the locality, or (ii) if (and for as long as) there has not been established such a group which serves such institution, which is established in such other manner as may be approved by the Secretary;\n\n(3) for such review, in each case of inpatient hospital services or extended care services furnished to such an individual during a continuous period of extended duration, as of such days of such period (which may differ for different classes of cases) as may be specified in regulations, with such review to be made as promptly as possible, after each day so specified, and in no event later than one week following such day; and\n\n(4) for prompt notification to the institution, the individual, and his attending physician of any finding (made after opportunity for consultation to such attending physician) by the physician members of such committee or group that any further stay in the institution is not medically necessary.\n\nThe review committee must be composed as provided in clause (B) of paragraph (2) rather than as provided in clause (A) of such paragraph in the case of any hospital or skilled nursing facility where, because of the small size of the institution, or (in the case of a skilled nursing facility) because of lack of an organized medical staff, or for such other reason or reasons as may be included in regulations, it is impracticable for the institution to have a properly functioning staff committee for the purposes of this subsection. If the Secretary determines that the utilization review procedures established pursuant to title XIX are superior in their effectiveness to the procedures required under this section, he may, to the extent that he deems it appropriate, require for purposes of this title that the procedures established pursuant to title XIX be utilized instead of the procedures required by this section.\n\nAgreements for Transfer Between Skilled Nursing Facilities and Hospitals\n\n(l) A hospital and a skilled nursing facility shall be considered to have a transfer agreement in effect if, by reason of a written agreement between them or (in case the two institutions are under common control) by reason of a written undertaking by the person or body which controls them, there is reasonable assurance that—\n\n(1) transfer of patients will be effected between the hospital and the skilled nursing facility whenever such transfer is medically appropriate as determined by the attending physician; and\n\n(2) there will be interchange of medical and other information necessary or useful in the care and treatment of individuals transferred between the institutions, or in determining whether such individuals can be adequately cared for otherwise than in either of such institutions.\n\nAny skilled nursing facility which does not have such an agreement in effect, but which is found by a State agency (of the State in which such facility is situated) with which an agreement under section 1864 is in effect (or, in the case of a State in which no such agency has an agreement under section 1864, by the Secretary) to have attempted in good faith to enter into such an agreement with a hospital sufficiently close to the facility to make feasible the transfer between them of patients and the information referred to in paragraph (2), shall be considered to have such an agreement in effect if and for so long as such agency (or the Secretary, as the case may be) finds that to do so is in the public interest and essential to assuring extended care services for persons in the community who are eligible for payments with respect to such services under this title.\n\nHome Health Services\n\n(m) The term “home health services” means the following items and services furnished to an individual, who is under the care of a physician, by a home health agency or by others under arrangements with them made by such agency, under a plan (for furnishing such items and services to such individual) established and periodically reviewed by a physician, which items and services are, except as provided in paragraph (7), provided on a visiting basis in a place of residence used as such individual’s home—\n\n(1) part-time or intermittent nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse;\n\n(2) physical or occupational therapy or speech-language pathology services;\n\n(3) medical social services under the direction of a physician;\n\n(4) to the extent permitted in regulations, part-time or intermittent services of a home health aide who has successfully completed a training program approved by the Secretary;\n\n(5) medical supplies (including catheters, catheter supplies, ostomy bags, and supplies related to ostomy care, and a covered osteoporosis drug (as defined in subsection (kk)), but excluding other drugs and biologicals) and durable medical equipment and applicable disposable devices (as defined in section 1834(s)(2)) while under such a plan;[496]\n\n(6) in the case of a home health agency which is affiliated or under common control with a hospital, medical services provided by an intern or resident-in-training of such hospital, under a teaching program of such hospital approved as provided in the last sentence of subsection (b); and\n\n(7) any of the foregoing items and services which are provided on an outpatient basis, under arrangements made by the home health agency, at a hospital or skilled nursing facility, or at a rehabilitation center which meets such standards as may be prescribed in regulations, and—\n\n(A) the furnishing of which involves the use of equipment of such a nature that the items and services cannot readily be made available to the individual in such place of residence, or\n\n(B) which are furnished at such facility while he is there to receive any such item or service described in clause (A),\n\nbut not including transportation of the individual in connection with any such item or service;\n\nexcluding, however, any item or service if it would not be included under subsection (b) if furnished to an inpatient of a hospital and home infusion therapy (as defined in subsection (iii)(i)). For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (4), the term “part–time or intermittent services” means skilled nursing and home health aide services furnished any number of days per week as long as they are furnished (combined) less than 8 hours each day and 28 or fewer hours each week (or, subject to review on a case-by-case basis as to the need for care, less than 8 hours each day and 35 or fewer hours per week). For purposes of sections 1814(a)(2)(C) and 1835(a)(2)(A), “intermittent” means skilled nursing care that is either provided or needed on fewer than 7 days each week, or less than 8 hours of each day for periods of 21 days or less (with extensions in exceptional circumstances when the need for additional care is finite and predictable).[497]\n\nDurable Medical Equipment\n\n(n) The term “durable medical equipment” includes iron lungs, oxygen tents, hospital beds, and wheelchairs (which may include a power-operated vehicle that may be appropriately used as a wheelchair, but only where the use of such a vehicle is determined to be necessary on the basis of the individual’s medical and physical condition and the vehicle meets such safety requirements as the Secretary may prescribe) used in the patient’s home (including an institution used as his home other than an institution that meets the requirements of subsection (e)(1) of this section or section 1819(a)(1)), whether furnished on a rental basis or purchased, and includes blood-testing strips and blood glucose monitors for individuals with diabetes without regard to whether the individual has Type I or Type II diabetes or to the individual’s use of insulin (as determined under standards established by the Secretary in consultation with the appropriate organizations) and eye tracking and gaze interaction accessories for speech generating devices furnished to individuals with a demonstrated medical need for such accessories; except that such term does not include such equipment furnished by a supplier who has used, for the demonstration and use of specific equipment, an individual who has not met such minimum training standards as the Secretary may establish with respect to the demonstration and use of such specific equipment. With respect to a seat-lift chair, such term includes only the seat-lift mechanism and does not include the chair[498].\n\nHome Health Agency\n\n(o) The term “home health agency” means a public agency or private organization, or a subdivision of such an agency or organization, which—\n\n(1) is primarily engaged in providing skilled nursing services and other therapeutic services;\n\n(2) has policies, established by a group of professional personnel (associated with the agency or organization), including one or more physicians and one or more registered professional nurses, to govern the services (referred to in paragraph (1)) which it provides, and provides for supervision of such services by a physician or registered professional nurse;\n\n(3) maintains clinical records on all patients;\n\n(4) in the case of an agency or organization in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of agencies or organizations of this nature, (A) is licensed pursuant to such law, or (B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing agencies or organizations of this nature, as meeting the standards established for such licensing;\n\n(5) has in effect an overall plan and budget that meets the requirements of subsection (z);\n\n(6) meets the conditions of participation specified in section 1891(a) and such other conditions of participation as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services by such agency or organization;\n\n(7) provides the Secretary with a surety bond—\n\n(A) in a form specified by the Secretary and in an amount that is not less than the minimum of $50,000; and\n\n(B) that the Secretary determines is commensurate with the volume of payments to the home health agency; and[499]\n\n(8) meets such additional requirements (including conditions relating to bonding or establishing of escrow accounts as the Secretary finds necessary for the financial security of the program) as the Secretary finds necessary for the effective and efficient operation of the program;\n\nexcept that for purposes of part A such term shall not include any agency or organization which is primarily for the care and treatment of mental diseases. The Secretary may waive the requirement of a surety bond under paragraph (7) in the case of an agency or organization that provides a comparable surety bond under State law.\n\nOutpatient Physical Therapy Services\n\n(p) The term “outpatient physical therapy services” means physical therapy services furnished by a provider of services, a clinic, rehabilitation agency, or a public health agency, or by others under an arrangement with, and under the supervision of, such provider, clinic, rehabilitation agency, or public health agency to an individual as an outpatient—\n\n(1) who is under the care of a physician (as defined in paragraph (1), (3), or (4) of section 1861(r)), and\n\n(2) with respect to whom a plan prescribing the type, amount, and duration of physical therapy services that are to be furnished such individual has been established by a physician (as so defined) or by a qualified physical therapist and is periodically reviewed by a physician (as so defined);\n\nexcluding, however—\n\n(3) any item or service if it would not be included under subsection (b) if furnished to an inpatient of a hospital; and\n\n(4) any such service—\n\n(A) if furnished by a clinic or rehabilitation agency, or by others under arrangements with such clinic or agency, unless such clinic or rehabilitation agency—\n\n(i) provides an adequate program of physical therapy services for outpatients and has the facilities and personnel required for such program or required for the supervision of such a program, in accordance with such requirements as the Secretary may specify,\n\n(ii) has policies, established by a group of professional personnel, including one or more physicians (associated with the clinic or rehabilitation agency) and one or more qualified physical therapists, to govern the services (referred to in clause (i)) it provides,\n\n(iii) maintains clinical records on all patients,\n\n(iv) if such clinic or agency is situated in a State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of institutions of this nature, (I) is licensed pursuant to such law, or (II) is approved by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing institutions of this nature, as meeting the standards established for such licensing; and\n\n(v) meets such other conditions relating to the health and safety of individuals who are furnished services by such clinic or agency on an outpatient basis, as the Secretary may find necessary, and provides the Secretary on a continuing basis with a surety bond in a form specified by the Secretary and in an amount that is not less than $50,000, or\n\n(B) if furnished by a public health agency, unless such agency meets such other conditions relating to health and safety of individuals who are furnished services by such agency on an outpatient basis, as the Secretary may find necessary.\n\nThe term “outpatient physical therapy services” also includes physical therapy services furnished an individual by a physical therapist (in his office or in such individual’s home) who meets licensing and other standards prescribed by the Secretary in regulations, otherwise than under an arrangement with and under the supervision of a provider of services, clinic, rehabilitation agency, or public health agency, if the furnishing of such services meets such conditions relating to health and safety as the Secretary may find necessary.

None of the items and services referred to in the preceding paragraphs (other than paragraphs (1) and (2)(A)) of this subsection which are furnished to a patient of an institution which meets the definition of a hospital for purposes of section 1814(d) shall be included unless such other conditions are met as the Secretary may find necessary relating to health and safety of individuals with respect to whom such items and services are furnished.\n\nDrugs and Biologicals\n\n(t)(1) The term “drugs” and the term “biologicals”, except for purposes of subsection (m)(5) and paragraph (2), include only such drugs (including contrast agents) and biologicals, respectively, as are included (or approved for inclusion) in the United States Pharmacopoeia, the National Formulary, or the United States Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, or in New Drugs or Accepted Dental Remedies (except for any drugs and biologicals unfavorably evaluated therein), or as are approved by the pharmacy and drug therapeutics committee (or equivalent committee) of the medical staff of the hospital furnishing such drugs and biologicals for use in such hospital.\n\n(2)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “drugs” also includes any drugs or biologicals used in an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen for a medically accepted indication (as described in subparagraph (B)).\n\n(B) In subparagraph (A), the term “medically accepted indication”, with respect to the use of a drug, includes any use which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the drug, and includes another use of the drug if—\n\n(i) the drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration; and\n\n(ii)(I) such use is supported by one or more citations which are included (or approved for inclusion) in one or more of the following compendia: the American Hospital Formulary Service-Drug Information, the American Medical Association Drug Evaluations, the United States Pharmacopoeia-Drug Information, and other authoritative compendia as identified by the Secretary, unless the Secretary has determined that the use is not medically appropriate or the use is identified as not indicated in one or more such compendia, or\n\n(II) the carrier involved determines, based upon guidance provided by the Secretary to carriers for determining accepted uses of drugs, that such use is medically accepted based on supportive clinical evidence in peer reviewed m edical literature appearing in publications which have been identified for purposes of this subclause by the Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary may revise the list of compendia in clause (ii)(I) as is appropriate for identifying medically accepted indications for drugs. On and after January 1, 2010, no compendia may be included on the list of compendia under this subparagraph unless the compendia has a publicly transparent process for evaluating therapies and for identifying potential conflicts of interests.\n\nProvider of Services\n\n(u) The term “provider of services” means a hospital, critical access hospital, skilled nursing facility, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, home health agency, hospice program, or, for purposes of section 1814(g) and section 1835(e), a fund.\n\nReasonable Cost\n\n(v)(1)(A) The reasonable cost of any services shall be the cost actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services, and shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used, and the items to be included, in determining such costs for various types or classes of institutions, agencies, and services; except that in any case to which paragraph (2) or (3) applies, the amount of the payment determined under such paragraph with respect to the services involved shall be considered the reasonable cost of such services. In prescribing the regulations referred to in the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall consider, among other things, the principles generally applied by national organizations or established prepayment organizations (which have developed such principles) in computing the amount of payment, to be made by persons other than the recipients of services, to providers of services on account of services furnished to such recipients by such providers. Such regulations may provide for determination of the costs of services on a per diem, per unit, per capita, or other basis, may provide for using different methods in different circumstances, may provide for the use of estimates of costs of particular items or services, may provide for the establishment of limits on the direct or indirect overall incurred costs or incurred costs of specific items or services or groups of items or services to be recognized as reasonable based on estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established under this title, and may provide for the use of charges or a percentage of charges where this method reasonably reflects the costs. Such regulations shall (i) take into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services (excluding therefrom any such costs, including standby costs, which are determined in accordance with regulations to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of services covered by the insurance programs established under this title) in order that, under the methods of determining costs, the necessary costs of efficiently delivering covered services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established by this title will not be borne by individuals not so covered, and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by such insurance programs, and (ii) provide for the making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustments where, for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive.\n\n(B) In the case of extended care services, the regulations under subparagraph (A) shall not include provision for specific recognition of a return on equity capital.\n\n(C) Where a hospital has an arrangement with a medical school under which the faculty of such school provides services at such hospital, an amount not in excess of the reasonable cost of such services to the medical school shall be included in determining the reasonable cost to the hospital of furnishing services—\n\n(i) for which payment may be made under part A, but only if—\n\n(I) payment for such services as furnished under such arrangement would be made under part A to the hospital had such services been furnished by the hospital, and\n\n(II) such hospital pays to the medical school at least the reasonable cost of such services to the medical school, or\n\n(ii) for which payment may be made under part B, but only if such hospital pays to the medical school at least the reasonable cost of such services to the medical school.\n\n(D) Where (i) physicians furnish services which are either inpatient hospital services (including services in conjunction with the teaching programs of such hospital) by reason of paragraph (7) of subsection (b) or for which entitlement exists by reason of clause (II) of section 1832(a)(2)(B)(i), and (ii) such hospital (or medical school under arrangement with such hospital) incurs no actual cost in the furnishing of such services, the reasonable cost of such services shall (under regulations of the Secretary) be deemed to be the cost such hospital or medical school would have incurred had it paid a salary to such physicians rendering such services approximately equivalent to the average salary paid to all physicians employed by such hospital (or if such employment does not exist, or is minimal in such hospital, by similar hospitals in a geographic area of sufficient size to assure reasonable inclusion of sufficient physicians in development of such average salary).\n\n(E) Such regulations may, in the case of skilled nursing facilities in any State, provide for the use of rates, developed by the State in which such facilities are located, for the payment of the cost of skilled nursing facility services furnished under the State’s plan approved under title XIX (and such rates may be increased by the Secretary on a class or size of institution or on a geographical basis by a percentage factor not in excess of 10 percent to take into account determinable items or services or other requirements under this title not otherwise included in the computation of such State rates), if the Secretary finds that such rates are reasonably related to (but not necessarily limited to) analyses undertaken by such State of costs of care in comparable facilities in such State. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, such regulations with respect to skilled nursing facilities shall take into account (in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A) and based on patient-days of services furnished) the costs (including the costs of services required to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident eligible for benefits under this title) of such facilities complying with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 1819 (including the costs of conducting nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs and competency evaluation programs).\n\n(F) Such regulations shall require each provider of services (other than a fund) to make reports to the Secretary of information described in section 1121(a)in accordance with the uniform reporting system (established under such section) for that type of provider.\n\n(G)(i) In any case in which a hospital provides inpatient services to an individual that would constitute post-hospital extended care services if provided by a skilled nursing facility and a quality improvement[508] organization (or, in the absence of such a qualified organization, the Secretary or such agent as the Secretary may designate) determines that inpatient hospital services for the individual are not medically necessary but post-hospital extended care services for the individual are medically necessary and such extended care services are not otherwise available to the individual (as determined in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary) at the time of such determination, payment for such services provided to the individual shall continue to be made under this title at the payment rate described in clause (ii) during the period in which—\n\n(I) such post-hospital extended care services for the individual are medically necessary and not otherwise available to the individual (as so determined),\n\n(II) inpatient hospital services for the individual are not medically necessary, and\n\n(III) the individual is entitled to have payment made for post-hospital extended care services under this title,\n\nexcept that if the Secretary determines that there is not an excess of hospital beds in such hospital and (subject to clause (iv)) there is not an excess of hospital beds in the area of such hospital, such payment shall be made (during such period) on the basis of the amount otherwise payable under part A with respect to inpatient hospital services.\n\n(ii)(I) Except as provided in subclause (II), the payment rate referred to in clause (i) is a rate equal to the estimated adjusted State-wide average rate per patient-day paid for services provided in skilled nursing facilities under the State plan approved under title XIX for the State in which such hospital is located, or, if the State in which the hospital is located does not have a State plan approved under title XIX, the estimated adjusted State-wide average allowable costs per patient-day for extended care services under this title in that State.\n\n(II) If a hospital has a unit which is a skilled nursing facility, the payment rate referred to in clause (i) for the hospital is a rate equal to the lesser of the rate described in subclause (I) or the allowable costs in effect under this title for extended care services provided to patients of such unit.\n\n(iii) Any day on which an individual receives inpatient services for which payment is made under this subparagraph shall, for purposes of this Act (other than this subparagraph), be deemed to be a day on which the individual received inpatient hospital services.\n\n(iv) In determining under clause (i), in the case of a public hospital, whether or not there is an excess of hospital beds in the area of such hospital, such determination shall be made on the basis of only the public hospitals (including the hospital) which are in the area of the hospital and which are under common ownership with that hospital.\n\n(H) In determining such reasonable cost with respect to home health agencies, the Secretary may not include—\n\n(i) any costs incurred in connection with bonding or establishing an escrow account by any such agency as a result of the surety bond requirement described in subsection (o)(7) and the financial security requirement described in subsection (o)(8);\n\n(ii) in the case of home health agencies to which the surety bond requirement described in subsection (o)(7) and the financial security requirement described in subsection (o)(8) apply, any costs attributed to interest charged such an agency in connection with amounts borrowed by the agency to repay overpayments made under this title to the agency, except that such costs may be included in reasonable cost if the Secretary determines that the agency was acting in good faith in borrowing the amounts;\n\n(iii) in the case of contracts entered into by a home health agency after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph[509] for the purpose of having services furnished for or on behalf of such agency, any cost incurred by such agency pursuant to any such contract which is entered into for a period exceeding five years; and\n\n(iv) in the case of contracts entered into by a home health agency before the date of the enactment of this subparagraph[510] for the purpose of having services furnished for or on behalf of such agency, any cost incurred by such agency pursuant to any such contract, which determines the amount payable by the home health agency on the basis of a percentage of the agency’s reimbursement or claim for reimbursement for services furnished by the agency, to the extent that such cost exceeds the reasonable value of the services furnished on behalf of such agency.\n\n(I) In determining such reasonable cost, the Secretary may not include any costs incurred by a provider with respect to any services furnished in connection with matters for which payment may be made under this title and furnished pursuant to a contract between the provider and any of its subcontractors which is entered into after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph[511] and the value or cost of which is $10,000 or more over a twelve-month period unless the contract contains a clause to the effect that—\n\n(i) until the expiration of four years after the furnishing of such services pursuant to such contract, the subcontractor shall make available, upon written request by the Secretary, or upon request by the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, the contract, and books, documents and records of such subcontractor that are necessary to certify the nature and extent of such costs, and\n\n(ii) if the subcontractor carries out any of the duties of the contract through a subcontract, with a value or cost of $10,000 or more over a twelve-month period, with a related organization, such subcontract shall contain a clause to the effect that until the expiration of four years after the furnishing of such services pursuant to such subcontract, the related organization shall make available, upon written request by the Secretary, or upon request by the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, the subcontract, and books, documents and records of such organization that are necessary to verify the nature and extent of such costs.\n\nThe Secretary shall prescribe in regulation criteria and procedures which the Secretary shall use in obtaining access to books, documents, and records under clauses required in contracts and subcontracts under this subparagraph.\n\n(J) Such regulations may not provide for any inpatient routine salary cost differential as a reimbursable cost for hospitals and skilled nursing facilities.\n\n(K)(i) The Secretary shall issue regulations that provide, to the extent feasible, for the establishment of limitations on the amount of any costs or charges that shall be considered reasonable with respect to services provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals (other than bona fide emergency services as defined in clause (ii)) or clinics (other than rural health clinics), which are reimbursed on a cost basis or on the basis of cost related charges, and by physicians utilizing such outpatient facilities. Such limitations shall be reasonably related to the charges in the same area for similar services provided in physicians’ offices. Such regulations shall provide for exceptions to such limitations in cases where similar services are not generally available in physicians’ offices in the area to individuals entitled to benefits under this title.\n\n(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the term “bona fide emergency services” means services provided in a hospital emergency room after the sudden onset of a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in—\n\n(I) placing the patient’s health in serious jeopardy;\n\n(II) serious impairment to bodily functions; or\n\n(III) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.\n\n(L)(i) The Secretary, in determining the amount of the payments that may be made under this title with respect to services furnished by home health agencies, may not recognize as reasonable (in the efficient delivery of such services) costs for the provision of such services by an agency to the extent these costs exceed (on the aggregate for the agency) for cost reporting periods beginning on or after—\n\n(I) July 1, 1985, and before July 1, 1986, 120 percent of the mean of the labor-related and nonlabor per visit costs for freestanding home health agencies,\n\n(II) July 1, 1986, and before July 1, 1987, 115 percent of such mean,\n\n(III) July 1, 1987, and before October 1, 1997, 112 percent of such mean,\n\n(IV) October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 1998, 105 percent of the median of the labor-related and nonlabor per visit costs for freestanding home health agencies; or\n\n(V) October 1, 1998, 106 percent of such median.\n\n(ii) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1986, such limitations shall be applied on an aggregate basis for the agency, rather than on a discipline specific basis. The Secretary may provide for such exemptions and exceptions to such limitation as he deems appropriate.[512]\n\n(iii) Not later than July 1, 1991, and annually thereafter (but not for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1994, and before July 1, 1996, or on or after July 1, 1997, and before October 1, 1997), the Secretary shall establish limits under this subparagraph for cost reporting periods beginning on or after such date by utilizing the area wage index applicable under section 1886(d)(3)(E) and determined using the survey of the most recent available wages and wage-related costs of hospitals located in the geographic area in which the home health service is furnished (determined without regard to whether such hospitals have been reclassified to a new geographic area pursuant to section 1886(d)(8)(B), a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board under section 1886(d)(10), or a decision of the Secretary).\n\n(iv) In establishing limits under this subparagraph for cost reporting periods beginning after September 30, 1997, the Secretary shall not take into account any changes in the home health market basket, as determined by the Secretary, with respect to cost reporting periods which began on or after July 1, 1994, and before July 1, 1996.\n\n(v) For services furnished by home health agencies for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, subject to clause (viii)(I), the Secretary shall provide for an interim system of limits. Payment shall not exceed the costs determined under the preceding provisions of this subparagraph or, if lower, the product of—\n\n(I) an agency-specific per beneficiary annual limitation calculated based 75 percent on 98 percent of the reasonable costs (including nonroutine medical supplies) for the agency’s 12-month cost reporting period ending during fiscal year 1994, and based 25 percent on 98 percent of the standardized regional average of such costs for the agency’s census division, as applied to such agency, for cost reporting periods ending during fiscal year 1994, such costs updated by the home health market basket index; and\n\n(II) the agency’s unduplicated census count of patients (entitled to benefits under this title) for the cost reporting period subject to the limitation.\n\n(vi) For services furnished by home health agencies for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, the following rules apply:\n\n(I) For new providers and those providers without a 12-month cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1994 subject to clauses (viii)(II) and (viii)(III), the per beneficiary limitation shall be equal to the median of these limits (or the Secretary’s best estimates thereof) applied to other home health agencies as determined by the Secretary. A home health agency that has altered its corporate structure or name shall not be considered a new provider for this purpose.\n\n(II) For beneficiaries who use services furnished by more than one home health agency, the per beneficiary limitations shall be prorated among the agencies.\n\n(vii)(I) Not later than January 1, 1998, the Secretary shall establish per visit limits applicable for fiscal year 1998, and not later than April 1, 1998, the Secretary shall establish per beneficiary limits under clause (v)(I) for fiscal year 1998.\n\n(II) Not later than August 1 of each year (beginning in 1998) the Secretary shall establish the limits applicable under this subparagraph for services furnished during the fiscal year beginning October 1 of the year.\n\n(viii)(I) In the case of a provider with a 12-month cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1994, if the limit imposed under clause (v) (determined without regard to this subclause) for a cost reporting period beginning during or after fiscal year 1999 is less than the median described in clause (vi)(I) (but determined as if any reference in clause (v) to “98 percent” were a reference to “100 percent”), the limit otherwise imposed under clause (v) for such provider and period shall be increased by 1/3 of such difference.\n\n(II) Subject to subclause (IV), for new providers and those providers without a 12-month cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1994, but for which the first cost reporting period begins before fiscal year 1999, for cost reporting periods beginning during or after fiscal year 1999, the per beneficiary limitation described in clause (vi)(I) shall be equal to the median described in such clause (determined as if any reference in clause (v) to “98 percent” were a reference to “100 percent”).\n\n(III) Subject to subclause (IV), in the case of a new provider for which the first cost reporting period begins during or after fiscal year 1999, the limitation applied under clause (vi)(I) (but only with respect to such provider) shall be equal to 75 percent of the median described in clause (vi)(I).\n\n(IV) In the case of a new provider or a provider without a 12-month cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1994, subclause (II) shall apply, instead of subclause (III), to a home health agency which filed an application for home health agency provider status under this title before September 15, 1998, or which was approved as a branch of its parent agency before such date and becomes a subunit of the parent agency or a separate agency on or after such date.\n\n(V) Each of the amounts specified in subclauses (I) through (III) are such amounts as adjusted under clause (iii) to reflect variations in wages among different areas.\n\n(ix) Notwithstanding the per beneficiary limit under clause (viii), if the limit imposed under clause (v) (determined without regard to this clause) for a cost reporting period beginning during or after fiscal year 2000 is less than the median described in clause (vi)(I) (but determined as if any reference in clause (v) to “98 percent” were a reference to “100 percent”), the limit otherwise imposed under clause (v) for such provider and period shall be increased by 2 percent.\n\n(x) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subparagraph, in updating any limit under this subparagraph by a home health market basket index for cost reporting periods beginning during each of fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003, the update otherwise provided shall be reduced by 1.1 percentage points. With respect to cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2001, the update to any limit under this subparagraph shall be the home health market basket index.\n\n(M) Such regulations shall provide that costs respecting care provided by a provider of services, pursuant to an assurance under title VI or XVI of the Public Health Service Act[513] that the provider will make available a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor, shall not be allowable as reasonable costs.\n\n(N) In determining such reasonable costs, costs incurred for activities directly related to influencing employees respecting unionization may not be included.\n\n(O)(i) In establishing an appropriate allowance for depreciation and for interest on capital indebtedness with respect to an asset of a provider of services which has undergone a change of ownership, such regulations shall provide, except as provided in clause (iii), that the valuation of the asset after such change of ownership shall be the historical cost of the asset, as recognized under this title, less depreciation allowed, to the owner of record as of the date of enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997[514] (or, in the case of an asset not in existence as of that date, the first owner of record of the asset after that date).\n\n(ii) Such regulations shall not recognize, as reasonable in the provision of health care services, costs (including legal fees, accounting and administrative costs, travel costs, and the costs of feasibility studies) attributable to the negotiation or settlement of the sale or purchase of any capital asset (by acquisition or merger) for which any payment has previously been made under this title.\n\n(iii) In the case of the transfer of a hospital from ownership by a State to ownership by a nonprofit corporation without monetary consideration, the basis for capital allowances to the new owner shall be the book value of the hospital to the State at the time of the transfer.\n\n(P) If such regulations provide for the payment for a return on equity capital (other than with respect to costs of inpatient hospital services), the rate of return to be recognized, for determining the reasonable cost of services furnished in a cost reporting period, shall be equal to the average of the rates of interest, for each of the months any part of which is included in the period, on obligations issued for purchase by the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.\n\n(Q) Except as otherwise explicitly authorized, the Secretary is not authorized to limit the rate of increase on allowable costs of approved medical educational activities.\n\n(R) In determining such reasonable cost, costs incurred by a provider of services representing a beneficiary in an unsuccessful appeal of a determination described in section 1869(b) shall not be allowable as reasonable costs.\n\n(S)(i) Such regulations shall not include provision for specific recognition of any return on equity capital with respect to hospital outpatient departments.\n\n(ii)(I) Such regulations shall provide that, in determining the amount of the payments that may be made under this title with respect to all the capital-related costs of outpatient hospital services, the Secretary shall reduce the amounts of such payments otherwise established under this title by 15 percent for payments attributable to portions of cost reporting periods occurring during fiscal year 1990, by 15 percent for payments attributable to portions of cost reporting periods occurring during fiscal year 1991, and by 10 percent for payments attributable to portions of cost reporting periods occurring during fiscal years 1992 through 1999 and until the first date that the prospective payment system under section 1833(t)is implemented.\n\n(II) The Secretary shall reduce the reasonable cost of outpatient hospital services (other than the capital-related costs of such services) otherwise determined pursuant to section 1833(a)(2)(B)(i)(I) by 5.8 percent for payments attributable to portions of cost reporting periods occurring during fiscal years 1991 through 1999 and until the first date that the prospective payment system under section 1833(t) is implemented during fiscal year 2000 before January 1, 2000.\n\n(III) Subclauses (I) and (II) shall not apply to payments with respect to the costs of hospital outpatient services provided by any hospital that is a sole community hospital (as defined in section 1886(d)(5)(D)(iii)) or a critical access hospital (as defined in section 1861(mm)(1)).\n\n(IV) In applying subclauses (I) and (II) to services for which payment is made on the basis of a blend amount under section 1833(i)(3)(A)(ii) or 1833(n)(1)(A)(ii), the costs reflected in the amounts described in sections 1833(i)(3)(B)(i)(I) and 1833(n)(1)(B)(i)(I), respectively, shall be reduced in accordance with such subclause.\n\n(T) In determining such reasonable costs for hospitals, no reduction in copayments under section 1833(t)(8)(B) shall be treated as a bad debt and the amount of bad debts otherwise treated as allowable costs which are attributable to the deductibles and coinsurance amounts under this title shall be reduced—\n\n(i) for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 1998, by 25 percent of such amount otherwise allowable,\n\n(ii) for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 1999, by 40 percent of such amount otherwise allowable,\n\n(iii) for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2000, by 45 percent of such amount otherwise allowable[515]\n\n(iv) for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal years 2001 through 2012[516], by 30 percent of such amount otherwise allowable, and[517]\n\n(v)[518] for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2013 or a subsequent fiscal year, by 35 percent of such amount otherwise allowable.\n\n(U) In determining the reasonable cost of ambulance services (as described in subsection (s)(7)) provided during fiscal year 1998, during fiscal year 1999, and during so much of fiscal year 2000 as precedes January 1, 2000, the Secretary shall not recognize the costs per trip in excess of costs recognized as reasonable for ambulance services provided on a per trip basis during the previous fiscal year (after application of this subparagraph), increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (U.S. city average) as estimated by the Secretary for the 12-month period ending with the midpoint of the fiscal year involved reduced by 1.0 percentage point. For ambulance services provided after June 30, 1998, the Secretary may provide that claims for such services must include a code (or codes) under a uniform coding system specified by the Secretary that identifies the services furnished.\n\n(V) In determining such reasonable costs for skilled nursing facilities and (beginning with respect to cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2013) for covered skilled nursing services described in section 1888(e)(2)(A) furnished by hospital providers of extended care services (as described in section 1883)[519], the amount of bad debts otherwise treated as allowed costs which are attributable to the coinsurance amounts under this title for individuals who are entitled to benefits under part A and—\n\n(i)[520] are not described in section 1935(c)(6)(A)(ii) shall be reduced by—\n\n(I) for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2005, but before fiscal year 2013, 30 percent of such amount otherwise allowable; and\n\n(II) for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2013 or a subsequent fiscal year, by 35 percent of such amount otherwise allowable.\n\n(ii) are described in such section—\n\n(I) for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2005, but before fiscal year 2013, shall not be reduced;\n\n(II) for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2013, shall be reduced by 12 percent of such amount otherwise allowable;\n\n(III) for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2014, shall be reduced by 24 percent of such amount otherwise allowable; and\n\n(IV) for cost reporting periods beginning during a subsequent fiscal year, shall be reduced by 35 percent of such amount otherwise allowable.[521]\n\n(W)[522](i) In determining such reasonable costs for providers described in clause (ii), the amount of bad debts otherwise treated as allowable costs which are attributable to deductibles and coinsurance amounts under this title shall be reduced—\n\n(I) for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2013, by 12 percent of such amount otherwise allowable;\n\n(II) for cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2014, by 24 percent of such amount otherwise allowable; and\n\n(III) for cost reporting periods beginning during a subsequent fiscal year, by 35 percent of such amount otherwise allowable.\n\n(ii) A provider described in this clause is a provider of services not described in subparagraph (T) or (V), a supplier, or any other type of entity that receives payment for bad debts under the authority under subparagraph (A).\n\n(2)(A) If the bed and board furnished as part of inpatient hospital services (including inpatient tuberculosis hospital services and inpatient psychiatric hospital services) or post-hospital extended care services is in accommodations more expensive than semi-private accommodations, the amount taken into account for purposes of payment under this title with respect to such services may not exceed the amount that would be taken into account with respect to such services if furnished in such semi-private accommodations unless the more expensive accommodations were required for medical reasons.\n\n(B) Where a provider of services which has an agreement in effect under this title furnishes to an individual items or services which are in excess of or more expensive than the items or services with respect to which payment may be made under part A or part B, as the case may be, the Secretary shall take into account for purposes of payment to such provider of services only the items or services with respect to which such payment may be made.[523]\n\n(3) If the bed and board furnished as part of inpatient hospital services (including inpatient tuberculosis hospital services and inpatient psychiatric hospital services) or post-hospital extended care services is in accommodations other than, but not more expensive than, semi-private accommodations and the use of such other accommodations rather than semi-private accommodations was neither at the request of the patient nor for a reason which the Secretary determines is consistent with the purposes of this title, the amount of the payment with respect to such bed and board under part A shall be the amount otherwise payable under this title for such bed and board furnished in semi-private accommodations minus the difference between the charge customarily made by the hospital or skilled nursing facility for bed and board in semi-private accommodations and the charge customarily made by it for bed and board in the accommodations furnished.\n\n(4) If a provider of services furnishes items or services to an individual which are in excess of or more expensive than the items or services determined to be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services and charges are imposed for such more expensive items or services under the authority granted in section 1866(a)(2)(B)(ii), the amount of payment with respect to such items or services otherwise due such provider in any fiscal period shall be reduced to the extent that such payment plus such charges exceed the cost actually incurred for such items or services in the fiscal period in which such charges are imposed.\n\n(5)(A) Where physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, speech therapy services, or other therapy services or services of other health-related personnel (other than physicians) are furnished under an arrangement with a provider of services or other organization, specified in the first sentence of subsection (p) (including through the operation of subsection (g)) the amount included in any payment to such provider or other organization under this title as the reasonable cost of such services (as furnished under such arrangements) shall not exceed an amount equal to the salary which would reasonably have been paid for such services (together with any additional costs that would have been incurred by the provider or other organization) to the person performing them if they had been performed in an employment relationship with such provider or other organization (rather than under such arrangement) plus the cost of such other expenses (including a reasonable allowance for traveltime and other reasonable types of expense related to any differences in acceptable methods of organization for the provision of such therapy) incurred by such person, as the Secretary may in regulations determine to be appropriate.\n\n(B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), if a provider of services or other organization specified in the first sentence of section 1861(p) requires the services of a therapist on a limited part-time basis, or only to perform intermittent services, the Secretary may make payment on the basis of a reasonable rate per unit of service, even though such rate is greater per unit of time than salary related amounts, where he finds that such greater payment is, in the aggregate, less than the amount that would have been paid if such organization had employed a therapist on a full-or part-time salary basis.\n\n(6) For purposes of this subsection, the term “semi-private accommodations” means two-bed, three-bed, or four-bed accommodations.\n\n(7)(A) For limitation on Federal participation for capital expenditures which are out of conformity with a comprehensive plan of a State or areawide planning agency, see section 1122.\n\n(B) For further limitations on reasonable cost and determination of payment amounts for operating costs of inpatient hospital services and waivers for certain States, see section 1886.\n\n(C) For provisions restricting payment for provider-based physicians’ services and for payments under certain percentage arrangements, see section 1887.\n\n(D) For further limitations on reasonable cost and determination of payment amounts for routine service costs of skilled nursing facilities, see subsections (a) through (c) of section 1888.\n\n(8) Items unrelated to patient care—Reasonable costs do not include costs for the following—\n\n(i) entertainment, including tickets to sporting and other entertainment events;\n\n(ii) gifts or donations;\n\n(iii) personal use of motor vehicles;\n\n(iv) costs for fines and penalties resulting from violations of Federal, State, or local laws; and\n\n(v) education expenses for spouses or other dependents of providers of services, their employees or contractors.\n\nArrangements for Certain Services\n\n(w)(1) The term “arrangements” is limited to arrangements under which receipt of payment by the hospital, critical access hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health agency, or hospice program (whether in its own right or as agent), with respect to services for which an individual is entitled to have payment made under this title, discharges the liability of such individual or any other person to pay for the services.\n\n(2) Utilization review activities conducted, in accordance with the requirements of the program established under part B of title XI of the Social Security Act with respect to services furnished by a hospital or critical access hospital to patients insured under part A of this title or entitled to have payment made for such services under part B of this title or under a State plan approved under title XIX, by a quality improvement[524] organization designated for the area in which such hospital or critical access hospital is located shall be deemed to have been conducted pursuant to arrangements between such hospital or critical access hospital and such organization under which such hospital or critical access hospital is obligated to pay to such organization, as a condition of receiving payment for hospital or critical access hospital services so furnished under this part or under such a State plan, such amount as is reasonably incurred and requested (as determined under regulations of the Secretary) by such organization in conducting such review activities with respect to services furnished by such hospital or critical access hospital to such patients.\n\nState and United States\n\n(x) The terms “State” and “United States” have the meaning given to them by subsections (h) and (i), respectively, of section 210.\n\nExtended Care in Religious Nonmedical Health Care Institutions\n\n(y)(1) The term “skilled nursing facility” also includes a religious nonmedical health care institution (as defined in subsection (ss)(1)), (except for purposes of subsection (a)(2)) with respect to items and services ordinarily furnished by such an institution to inpatients, and payment may be made with respect to services provided by or in such an institution only to such extent and under such conditions, limitations, and requirements (in addition to or in lieu of the conditions, limitations, and requirements otherwise applicable) as may be provided in regulations.\n\n(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, payment under part A may not be made for services furnished an individual in a skilled nursing facility to which paragraph (1) applies unless such individual elects, in accordance with regulations, for a spell of illness to have such services treated as post-hospital extended care services for purposes of such part; and payment under part A may not be made for post-hospital extended care services—\n\n(A) furnished an individual during such spell of illness in a skilled nursing facility to which paragraph (1) applies after—\n\n(i) such services have been furnished to him in such a facility for 30 days during such spell, or\n\n(ii) such services have been furnished to him during such spell in a skilled nursing facility to which such paragraph does not apply; or\n\n(B) furnished an individual during such spell of illness in a skilled nursing facility to which paragraph (1) does not apply after such services have been furnished to him during such spell in a skilled nursing facility to which such paragraph applies.\n\n(3) The amount payable under part A for post-hospital extended care services furnished an individual during any spell of illness in a skilled nursing facility to which paragraph (1) applies shall be reduced by a coinsurance amount equal to one-eighth of the inpatient hospital deductible for each day before the 31st day on which he is furnished such services in such a facility during such spell (and the reduction under this paragraph shall be in lieu of any reduction under section 1813(a)(3)).\n\n(4) For purposes of subsection (i), the determination of whether services furnished by or in an institution described in paragraph (1) constitute post-hospital extended care services shall be made in accordance with and subject to such conditions, limitations, and requirements as may be provided in regulations.\n\nInstitutional Planning\n\n(z) An overall plan and budget of a hospital, skilled nursing facility, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, or home health agency shall be considered sufficient if it—\n\n(1) provides for an annual operating budget which includes all anticipated income and expenses related to items which would, under generally accepted accounting principles, be considered income and expense items (except that nothing in this paragraph shall require that there be prepared, in connection with any budget, an item-by-item identification of the components of each type of anticipated expenditure or income);\n\n(2)(A) provides for a capital expenditures plan for at least a 3-year period (including the year to which the operating budget described in paragraph (1) is applicable) which includes and identifies in detail the anticipated sources of financing for, and the objectives of, each anticipated expenditure in excess of $600,000 (or such lesser amount as may be established by the State under section 1122(g)(1) in which the hospital is located) related to the acquisition of land, the improvement of land, buildings, and equipment, and the replacement, modernization, and expansion of the buildings and equipment which would, under generally accepted accounting principles, be considered capital items;\n\n(B) provides that such plan is submitted to the agency designated under section 1122(b), or if no such agency is designated, to the appropriate health planning agency in the State (but this subparagraph shall not apply in the case of a facility exempt from review under section 1122 by reason of section 1122(j));\n\n(3) provides for review and updating at least annually; and\n\n(4) is prepared, under the direction of the governing body of the institution or agency, by a committee consisting of representatives of the governing body, the administrative staff, and the medical staff (if any) of the institution or agency.\n\nRural Health Clinic Services and Federally Qualified Health Center Services\n\n(aa)(1) The term “rural health clinic services” means—\n\n(A) physicians’ services and such services and supplies as are covered under section 1861(s)(2)(A) if furnished as an incident to a physician’s professional service and items and services described in section 1861(s)(10),\n\n(B) such services furnished by a physician assistant or a nurse practitioner (as defined in paragraph (5)), by a clinical psychologist (as defined by the Secretary) or by a clinical social worker (as defined in subsection (hh)(1)), and such services and supplies furnished as an incident to his service as would otherwise be covered if furnished by a physician or as an incident to a physician’s service, and\n\n(C) in the case of a rural health clinic located in an area in which there exists a shortage of home health agencies, part-time or intermittent nursing care and related medical supplies (other than drugs and biologicals) furnished by a registered professional nurse or licensed practical nurse to a homebound individual under a written plan of treatment (i) established and periodically reviewed by a physician described in paragraph (2)(B), or (ii) established by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant and periodically reviewed and approved by a physician described in paragraph (2)(B),\n\nwhen furnished to an individual as an outpatient of a rural health clinic.\n\n(2) The term “rural health clinic” means a facility which—\n\n(A) is primarily engaged in furnishing to outpatients services described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1);\n\n(B) in the case of a facility which is not a physician-directed clinic, has an arrangement (consistent with the provisions of State and local law relative to the practice, performance, and delivery of health services) with one or more physicians (as defined in subsection (r)(1)) under which provision is made for the periodic review by such physicians of covered services furnished by physician assistants and nurse practitioners, the supervision and guidance by such physicians of physician assistants and nurse practitioners, the preparation by such physicians of such medical orders for care and treatment of clinic patients as may be necessary, and the availability of such physicians for such referral of and consultation for patients as is necessary and for advice and assistance in the management of medical emergencies; and, in the case of a physician-directed clinic, has one or more of its staff physicians perform the activities accomplished through such an arrangement;\n\n(C) maintains clinical records on all patients;\n\n(D) has arrangements with one or more hospitals, having agreements in effect under section 1866, for the referral and admission of patients requiring

review of such policies from time to time by) a group of professional personnel, including one or more physicians and one or more physician assistants or nurse practitioners, to govern those services described in paragraph (1) which it furnishes;\n\n(F) has a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner responsible for the execution of policies described in subparagraph (E) and relating to the provision of the clinic’s services;\n\n(G) directly provides routine diagnostic services, including clinical laboratory services, as prescribed in regulations by the Secretary, and has prompt access to additional diagnostic services from facilities meeting requirements under this title;\n\n(H) in compliance with State and Federal law, has available for administering to patients of the clinic at least such drugs and biologicals as are determined by the Secretary to be necessary for the treatment of emergency cases (as defined in regulations) and has appropriate procedures or

the individuals who are furnished services by the clinic.\n\nFor the purposes of this title, such term includes only a facility which (i) is located in an area that is not an urbanized area (as defined by the Bureau of the Census) and in which there are insufficient numbers of needed health care practitioners (as determined by the Secretary), and that, within the previous 4-year period, has been designated by the chief executive officer of the State and certified by the Secretary as an area with a sho"
