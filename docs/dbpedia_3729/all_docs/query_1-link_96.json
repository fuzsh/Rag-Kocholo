        "text": "The open competition, which has a £10,000 prize fund, sought bold ideas to reshape the future of London as a ‘resilient and 24-hour city’. Submissions could take the form of a one-page summary, poster or a 60-second video pitch. The overall winners will be invited to present their concept to London’s top leaders and decision-makers.\n\nShortlisted ideas – selected from more than 100 entries – range from a radical rethinking of how London’s Underground network could be leveraged as urban farms, entertainment spaces and logistical routes, to a community striving to transform a concrete area of Waltham Forest into a vibrant and biodiverse community park.\n\nHighlights include the Attenborough Line cable car and pedestrian superhighway concept by Able Partners, a Youth-led Empowerment Network supported by We Rise Brixton and PRD, a HubPubs community reuse concept by Buro Happold and LDA Design, and a proposal to help disabled communities use and navigate public spaces at night by students from the London School of Architecture.\n\nNLA director Catherine Staniland said: ‘The wide range of fantastic submissions to Reimagine London demonstrate a wealth of ideas and solutions from across the city, with a focus on enhancing our green spaces, improving accessibility to all, and creating new community assets that bring people together.\n\n‘The ideas submitted demonstrate the opportunity we have now to rise to the challenge of environmental adaptation in a way that brings tangible benefit to the quality of Londoners’ lives.\n\n‘As the mayor of London works to make a fairer, greener, more prosperous and affordable city the focus of his third mayoral term, we look forward to continuing our work with policymakers, professionals and communities to turn these ideas into solutions.’\n\nLondon is the UK’s largest city with 8.8 million inhabitants and is also ranked as Europe’s most economically powerful and most visited city.\n\nNLA was founded in 2005 as a membership body working with built environment professionals, politicians and the public to deliver positive change in the UK capital.\n\nIts contest, which sought ‘ambitious, blue-sky and no-holds-barred’ concepts, was inspired by the 2015 Reinventing Paris competition, which sought ideas to transform a series of underused and neglected sites across the French capital.\n\nSubmissions will be judged 70 per cent on innovation and concept, and 30 per cent on potential to create meaningful change.\n\nJudges will include the artist and designer Adam Nathaniel Furman; Nikki Linsell, chief operating officer at Public Practice; Johanna Agerman Ross, chief curator of the Design Museum in London; Rob Heasman, chief executive of The Earls Court Development Company; and Emily Prideaux, executive director at Derwent London.\n\nThe shortlisted concepts will feature in an exhibition inside the London Centre in September, be presented in front of the jury and then open to a public vote. Winners will be announced on 17 September and invited to present their concepts at the London Real Estate Forum on 25 September.\n\nThe shortlist\n\nA Possibilist Patchwork: London’s Micro Green Grid\n\nsubmitted by EcoResponsiveEnvironments, studio 8FOLD, Where Pathways Meet\n\nA proposal to leverage AR and VR technologies to empower local citizens to co-create a network of micro-green spaces at residual and leftover urban spaces around houses and housing estates, along streets and other city infrastructures.\n\nADAPT Rethinking Skyscrapers\n\nsubmitted by NAME architecture\n\nADAPT proposes a visionary solution to retrofit vacant buildings, such as the HSBC headquarters in Canary Wharf, with residential units across four distinct communities: elderly retirement homes, student accommodations, family-friendly homes, and luxury housing, plus urban parks, sky gardens, wellbeing spaces and mixed-use facilities to deliver a more sustainable future for our city’s empty real estate.\n\nChimney Pot Turbines\n\nsubmitted by Richard Birch and Elena Kosseva\n\nA simple, cost-effective yet innovative and high-impact proposal to generate clean renewable energy for a healthier and more resilient future economy and citizens by adding turbines in existing chimney pots. By repurposing a much-loved original London feature, renewable solutions can be provided even in sensitive areas with heritage character, where roof structure does not allow photovoltaic panels to be installed or where costs or planning policy prohibit installation of heat pumps.\n\nEast London Waterworks Park\n\nsubmitted by East London Waterworks Park\n\nA community-led proposal to acquire a 14-acre (6ha) concrete slab in Waltham Forest and transform it into a vibrant and biodiverse community park. There will be wild swimming, a forest school space, studios for artists to experiment and collaborate, and a mosaic of dry and wetland habitats for wildlife to thrive and for people to enjoy.\n\nHer, Their, Everywhere: Reclaiming the city as a feminist laboratory\n\nsubmitted by Publica CIC\n\nThis ambitious proposal takes over the city by asking women, girls and gender-diverse people to set a vision for an inclusive city, analysing the issues, and transforming London’s public spaces. Using streets, buildings and open spaces as laboratories, our travelling programme combines research, idea generation, and practical actions to place women’s safety at the core of urban design for the whole capital.\n\nHouse of Hackney\n\nsubmitted by City Post Policing – a group of LSA Students: Sakariye Ahmed, Bonnie Ha, Polly Chiddicks, Abel Asmah, Wiame Azzouzi and Benjamin Daughtry.\n\nA proposal to replace Hackney’s Met policing structure with a collaborative multi-agency approach where safety is integrated into community care and empowerment. It integrates new innovative practices to create adaptive and responsive safety solutions that cater to the community’s evolving needs including transforming Stoke Newington Police Station into a community hub, providing toolkits for design in community and creating community touch points.\n\nInto the Dark\n\nsubmitted by London School of Architecture - Nick Blacker, Dominic O'Dea, James Langham, Molly Robinson, Alfonso Pedrosa and Corben Lai\n\nNighttime spaces are practically non-existent for disabled people and this contributes to a sense of vulnerability that the public realm should seek to counter. Into the Dark explores how disabled communities use and navigate public spaces at night, emphasising the impact of inaccessible nighttime spaces on community areas, public facilities, and social venues.\n\nMade for Me\n\nsubmitted by Turley, Edge Urban Design, Matter Space Soul, You See Media and Mend\n\nMade for Me is a proposal for interconnected hubs for accessibility, retrofitted into pre-existing spaces at transport interchanges throughout London. Hubs allow you to hire mobility and sensory aids, they provide accessible toilets, seating, quiet rooms, lockers and information to support people in their daily lives and their journeys across the city.\n\nMusic Gym\n\nsubmitted by Ruth Harper, Londoner with support from Adam Johnston, Dipa Joshi and Mega Dixon\n\nMusic Gym unlocks the opportunity of music-making when you can’t afford, store or play instruments at home. Turning large urban premises that are not suitable for housing into a soundproofed, welcoming space for tutoring, charities, team building, band rehearsals and instrument hire and unlocking the health and wellbeing benefits of music for all.\n\nNomadic City Hall for London\n\nsubmitted by Erlend Christopher Larsen Birkeland\n\nA proposal for a Nomadic City Hall relocating every three-to-six years to a newly restored structure in a different part of London. Each new location will additionally hold other amenities that are needed locally – like a library, adult learning centre or an after-school hub – which remain after City Hall relocates.\n\nReimagining TfL bus stops as social infrastructure\n\nsubmitted by Dani Abrams, student at the London Interdisciplinary School\n\nWaiting spaces such as bus stops are overlooked as technical facilities, despite their accessibility for repeated encounters among diverse ‘familiar strangers’ each day. By adapting seating arrangements, adding interactive screens, and implementing zoned areas to provide opportunities for open communication, shared focal points and shared experiences, bus stops can be utilised to foster communities.\n\nSedimentary London\n\nsubmitted by Boji Hu and Ya Liu\n\nThis idea opposes excavation, demolition, and expansion and provokes reuse, repurposing and the re-assembling by sourcing material from the city and densifying existing urban fragments as sedimentary layers. This geological approach to our city pictures a future where wholesale demolition is completely restrained by local planning policy. Any building that becomes unusable will have to be repurposed and densified for longevity.\n\nSpace Match\n\nsubmitted by Fletcher Priest Architects\n\nSpaceMatch is like Tinder for buildings, connecting community groups, young people, startups, and creatives who struggle to find accessible, affordable spaces to thrive with London’s underused urban spaces, such as office buildings that are empty almost 80 per cent of the time when you factor in weekends, bank holidays and occupancy rates.\n\nSustainable Sustenance: Future Food City\n\nsubmitted by Phoebe Lawrie\n\nIndustrial-scale urban farms built above railway stations, looped together with the underground tube network, and the underground sewage system, to reuse waste heat to keep the greenhouse warm in the winter. This reduces operational costs and energy consumption, and reduces the amount of waste heat contributed to the atmosphere. The combined effect would feed the city while reducing its emissions.\n\nTasty London in Tonbridge Street\n\nsubmitted by Xueying Ren\n\nAn idea focused on creating shared community spaces that provide opportunities for urban farming and foraging. These activities foster community interaction, trust and education in nature management. By leveraging innovation and working in partnership with local organizations and residents, this project ensures inclusive participation and promotes sustainable practices.\n\nThe Attenborough Line\n\nsubmitted by Able Partners\n\nAn ambitious vision to reimagine London’s transport priorities with the proposal of the Attenborough Line, which lifts mass transit off the ground with cable cars above a pedestrian superhighway running straight through the capital with green spaces to play, interact, rest, eat, compete, watch, dance and thrive.\n\nThe Garden Permit\n\nsubmitted by ABHR_A with George King\n\nA proposal is to redesignate the land in front of people’s homes by creating a new Garden Permit. The residents of every road vote on the amount of parking bays to open for garden applications. These are operated like allotments, with residents applying for a garden bay, and priority given to those without gardens.\n\nThe HubPub on Smorgasboard Street\n\nsubmitted by Buro Happold x LDA Design\n\nThe HubPub model seeks to broaden the appeal of pubs to all corners of the community. A flexible ‘kit-of-parts’ approach will make each one unique: café, creche, workshop, donation hub – each one suited to the specific needs of the community they serve.\n\nThe regenerative power of artist communities in creating new third spaces\n\nsubmitted by Kindred Studios\n\nA methodology that works by delivering affordable workspaces for artists, then carefully nurturing its artists into a culture of community. The cohesion within the community is made possible using the unique qualities of art and frequent exchanges, which allows artists to show vulnerability and humanity and thus bond.\n\nThe Rhythm of the Water\n\nsubmitted by AtkinsRealis\n\nAs social connections drift apart, this proposal reclaims them with floating infrastructures for community gatherings. With London’s famous underground tubes at risk, underwater energy generators would be implemented, turning tidal movements into sustainable power sources.\n\nThe Well-Line\n\nsubmitted by Laurie Chetwood, Chetwoods Architects\n\nThe Well-line will transform the disused underground Post Office Railway into an adaptable high-speed logistics route, reducing traffic congestion and pollution. The proposal reimagines London as a city with a network of multipurpose places and spaces, supplied and connected via a repurposed underground brownfield site, delivering long-term health and environmental improvements to Londoners.\n\nThe Westway Reimagined\n\nby Diana Hare on behalf of the Westbourne Forum\n\nWe propose a phased programme of interventions and improvements leveraging funding from advertising totems, sponsorship and community-focused developments in and around the structure to elevate the quality of life for the wide range of people impacted by the Westway.\n\nUnearthing the London Underground\n\nsubmitted by Heidi Loh Au-Yeung\n\nThe proposal explores the potential of excavating the earth between ground and tube level to create a new public space, restoring Piccadilly Circus as a place for people rather than a traffic junction. At street level, the proposal revives the plans of Walkable London, the pedestrianised streets will connect Regent Street to Leicester Square, while underground, cultural and music destinations will come alive.\n\nUrban Family Housing\n\nsubmitted by Assael\n\nA manifesto for a new typology to fill a gap in the market – where places for children to play are prioritised, childcare settings are integrated, and communities are fostered. It is focused around adapting urban housing models to include community space with childcare, outdoor spaces and flexible homes to grow with a family.\n\nYouth-Led Empowerment Network\n\nsupported by We Rise Brixton and PRD\n\nA proposal from three young people from Brixton with a vision for a Youth-led Empowerment Network that ‘reimagines’ London’s unloved and forgotten spaces, bringing peace, safety and connection to neighbourhoods. Spaces like community and housing estate halls, parks, streets – public spaces at the heart of communities."
