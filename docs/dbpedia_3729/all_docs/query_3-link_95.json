        "text": "What is intensity?\n\nPhysical activity is anything that moves your body and burns calories. This includes things like walking, climbing stairs and stretching.\n\nAerobic (or “cardio”) activity gets your heart rate up and benefits your heart by improving cardiorespiratory fitness. When done at moderate intensity, your heart will beat faster and you’ll breathe harder than normal, but you’ll still be able to talk. Think of it as a medium or moderate amount of effort.\n\nExamples of moderate-intensity aerobic activities:\n\nbrisk walking (at least 2.5 miles per hour)\n\nwater aerobics\n\ndancing (ballroom or social)\n\ngardening\n\ntennis (doubles)\n\nbiking slower than 10 miles per hour\n\nVigorous intensity activities will push your body a little further. They will require a higher amount of effort. You’ll probably get warm and begin to sweat. You won’t be able to talk much without getting out of breath.\n\nExamples of vigorous-intensity aerobic activities:\n\nhiking uphill or with a heavy backpack\n\nrunning\n\nswimming laps\n\nvigorous aerobic dancing\n\nheavy yardwork such as continuous digging or hoeing\n\ntennis (singles)\n\ncycling 10 miles per hour or faster\n\njumping rope\n\nKnowing your target heart rate can also help you track the intensity of your activities.\n\nFor maximum benefits, include both moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity in your routine along with strengthening and stretching exercises.\n\nWhat if I’m just starting to get active?\n\nDon’t worry if you can’t reach 150 minutes per week just yet. Everyone has to start somewhere. Even if you've been sedentary for years, today is the day you can begin to make healthy changes in your life. Set a reachable goal for today. You can work toward the recommended amount by increasing your time as you get stronger. Don't let all-or-nothing thinking keep you from doing what you can every day.\n\nThe simplest way to get moving and improve your health is to start walking. It's free, easy and can be done just about anywhere, even in place.\n\nAny amount of movement is better than none. And you can break it up into short bouts of activity throughout the day. Taking a brisk walk for five or ten minutes a few times a day will add up.\n\nIf you have a chronic condition or disability, talk with your healthcare provider about what types and amounts of physical activity are right for you before making too many changes. But don’t wait! Get started today by simply sitting less and moving more, whatever that looks like for you.\n\nThe takeaway: Move more, with more intensity, and sit less.\n\nScience has linked being inactive and sitting too much with higher risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, colon and lung cancers, and early death.\n\nIt’s clear that being more active benefits everyone and helps us live longer, healthier lives.\n\nHere are some of the big wins:\n\nLower risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, dementia and Alzheimer’s, several types of cancer, and some complications of pregnancy\n\nBetter sleep, including improvements in insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea\n\nImproved cognition, including memory, attention and processing speed\n\nLess weight gain, obesity and related chronic health conditions\n\nBetter bone health and balance, with less risk of injury from falls\n\nFewer symptoms of depression and anxiety\n\nBetter quality of life and sense of overall well-being"
