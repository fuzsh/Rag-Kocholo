        "text": "The company, acquired by Guardian Media Group and private equity company Apax for Â£1.25bn earlier this year, is abolishing the paywalls around certain websites in an effort to lure new advertisers.\n\nEmap chief executive David Gilbertson said the move will only apply to the websites of titles in its Emap Inform division, which includes titles such as Health Service Journal, Retail Week and its Drapers brands. Established digital services from other Emap divisions, such as fashion portal WGSN, are not affected.\n\nGilbertson said: \"We are in the process of going free-to-view across our sites and we have to deliver to our digital advertisers.\"\n\nThe majority of the websites within Emap Inform currently carry around two-thirds paid-for content, with the remaining third accessed for free.\n\nMeanwhile, the group has appoint-ed Claudia Arney, who joins from rival B2B outfit Informa, to the new role of managing director, digital, for Emap Inform.\n\nSally O'Rourke, who previously held an executive position with customer publisher John Brown, joins Emap in the new role of managing director of its retail and fashion site WGSN."
