        "text": "Substance use negatively affects U.S. industry through lost productivity, workplace accidents and injuries, employee absenteeism, low morale, and increased illness. U.S. companies lose billions of dollars a year because of employees' alcohol and drug use and related problems.1 Research shows that the rate of substance use varies by occupation and industry.2\n\nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) gathers information about substance use and dependence or abuse. NSDUH defines illicit drugs as marijuana/hashish, cocaine (including crack), inhalants, hallucinogens, heroin, or prescription-type drugs used nonmedically.3 Heavy alcohol use is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on 5 or more days in the past 30 days. NSDUH also includes a series of questions to assess symptoms of dependence on or abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs during the past year. These questions are used to classify persons as dependent on or abusing substances based on criteria in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).4 In this report, dependence on or abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs is referred to as a \"substance use disorder.\"\n\nThis report is one of several designed to update SAMHSAâs Analytic Series Aâ29, Worker Substance Use and Workplace Policies and Programs, published in 2007. To enhance the statistical power and analytic capability and ensure consistency in time frames across all of the updated reports, 5-year time periods were chosen. This issue of The CBHSQ Report uses combined data from the 2008 to 2012 surveys to present estimates of substance use behaviors (past month illicit drug use and past month heavy alcohol use) and past year substance use disorder among persons aged 18 to 64 who are employed full time by industry category. Full-time employment is defined as working 35 or more hours per week and working in the past week or having a job despite not working in the past week. NSDUH includes questions to assess the type of business or industry in which these respondents worked. Using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, 19 major industry groupings were identified.Â\n\nThe analyses presented in this report includes comparisons of the 2008 to 2012 rates of illicit drug use and heavy alcohol use across industries and comparisons of the 2008 to 2012 rates with the 2003 to 2007 rates within each industry. For this report, testing for differences across industry groupings included two phases. First, differences across industries were assessed by making pair-wise comparisons between industries (e.g., the rates for each industry were compared with those of every other industry) to identify whether any industry had significantly higher rates than all other industries. A second test was conducted to assess whether significant differences between industries were the result of differences in the age and gender composition of the industry.5 Previous research has shown that males have higher substance use rates than females and adults aged 18 to 25 have higher substance use rates than older adults.6 As a result, male-dominated or youth-dominated industries could have higher substance use rates at the overall level, but when the industryâs age and gender distribution was taken into account, the industry might not differ from other industries. The final section of this report presents comparisons of combined 2008 to 2012 data with combined 2003 to 2007 data.Â\n\nWorkers in the mining (17.5 percent) and construction (16.5 percent) industries had the highest rates of past month heavy alcohol use. For the workers in the construction industry, this finding remained true even when controlling for gender and age differences across industries.7Â This indicates that there is something unique about past month heavy alcohol use for the construction industry that would remain even if the construction industry had the same gender and age distribution of any other industry (see Tables A1âA2). However, for the mining industry, this higher rate did not remain when controlling for age or gender differences. This indicates that the high heavy alcohol use rate in the mining industry can be attributed to the demographic composition of the mining industry.\n\nThe overall rate of past month illicit drug use among full-time workers aged 18 to 64 was 8.6 percent. Rates of past month illicit drug use ranged from 19.1 percent among workers in the accommodations and food services industry to 4.3 percent among workers in the public administration industry (Figure 2). These findings remained true even when controlling for gender and age differences across industries (see Tables A3âA4).\n\nComparisons between combined 2003 to 2007 data and combined 2008 to 2012 data show some changes in rates of substance use behaviors or disorders by industry category (Figures 4â6). Between the two time periods, rates of past month illicit drug use increased among workers in the accommodations and food services industry (from 16.9 to 19.1 percent) and in the educational services industry (from 3.7 to 4.8 percent), and decreased among workers in the construction services industry (from 13.9 to 11.6 percent). Additionally, decreases were seen in the rates of past year substance use disorder in four industry categories: construction (from 17.3 to 14.3 percent), management (from 13.8 to 11.4 percent), wholesale trade (from 13.4 to 10.4 percent), and manufacturing (from 10.4 to 9.3 percent). The changes within each industry between the two time periods do not account for any changes in the demographic composition (e.g., age distribution) that may have occurred within the industries.\n\nEmployee heavy alcohol use, use of illicit drugs, and substance use disorder are associated with negative work behaviors such as absenteeism and frequent job changes.2 This report indicates that the prevalence of substance use and substance use disorders is not consistent across industries. For example, the lowest rates of heavy alcohol use, illicit drug use, and substance use disorder were generally seen in education, health care and social assistance, and public administration. In contrast, higher rates were generally seen in mining, construction, and accommodations and food services industries. There are demographic differences in the age and gender composition across industries, and some of the differences in substance use rates across industries were statistically significant even when controlling for age or gender. Differences across industries that did not remain significant when controlling for age and gender are still important to identify. Employers in industries that have higher or lower rates of heavy alcohol use, use of illicit drugs, and substance use disorder that can be attributed to the demographic composition of their industry can use this information when developing prevention/education programs.\n\nWhen heavy alcohol use, use of illicit drugs, and substance use disorder rates are examined over time, it appears that some industries have had a reduction in rates; however, there were increases as well. An extension of this research could examine whether the changes in use rates correspond to either changes in climate in the industries (e.g., attitudes towards substance use, distribution of prevention messages) or shifts in the demographic compositions of the industries across these time periods.\n\nStudies also have indicated that employers vary in their treatment of substance use issues and that workplace-based Employee Assistance Programs can be a valuable resource for obtaining help for substance-using workers.8,9 Given the lifetime health and economic burdens from alcohol use, illicit drug, and substance use disorders, this report illustrates the need to monitor industries individually.\n\nBackground: Substance use negatively affects U.S. industry through lost productivity, workplace accidents and injuries, employee absenteeism, low morale, and increased illness. Research shows that the rate of substance use varies by occupation and industry. Method: Combined 2003-2007 and 2008-2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) estimates for past month heavy alcohol use, past month illicit drug use and past year substance use disorder (SUD) for full-time employees aged 18-64 in 19 industry categories were analyzed. Results: Combined data from 2008-2012 indicate an annual average of 8.7% of full-time workers aged 18 to 64 used alcohol heavily, 8.6% used illicit drugs, and 9.5% had SUD. The highest rates of heavy alcohol use were found in the mining (17.5%) and construction industries (16.5%). The highest rates of illicit drug use were found in the accommodations and food services industry (19.1%). Workers in the accommodations and food services industry (16.9%) had the highest SUD rates. Between the two time periods, rates of illicit drug use increased in the accommodations and food services industry (from 16.9 to 19.1%) and in the educational services industry (from 3.7 to 4.8%), and decreased among workers in the construction services industry (from 13.9 to11.6%). Â Decreases were seen in the past year SUD rates in construction (from 17.3 to 14.3%), management (from 13.8 to 11.4%), wholesale trade (from 13.4 to 10.4%), and manufacturing (from 10.4 to 9.3%). Conclusion: The prevalence of substance use and SUD is not consistent across industries. The lowest rates of heavy alcohol use, illicit drug use, and SUD were generally seen in education, health care and social assistance, and public administration. Higher rates were generally seen in mining, construction, and accommodations and food services industries. When heavy alcohol use, use of illicit drugs, and SUD are examined over time, it appears that some industries have had a reduction in rates; however, there were increases as well.\n\nKeywords: full time workers aged 18-64, worker drug use, industry, illicit drug use, heavy alcohol use, substance use disorder, National Survey on Drug Use and Health, NSDUH"
