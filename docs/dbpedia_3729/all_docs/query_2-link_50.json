        "text": "AOP announces shortlist for 2022 Digital Publishing Awards\n\nPublished: 27 Apr 2022\n\nLondon, UK, 27th April 2022: The Association of Online Publishers (AOP) has today announced the shortlist for the 2022 Digital Publishing Awards – a celebration of the individuals and teams working to create, deliver, and monetise quality online content.\n\nThe awards programme champions talent and excellence across 24 categories and will be judged by a panel of digital industry experts, under the guidance of co-chairs, Amanda Barnes, Chief Executive of Faversham House, and Dominic Carter, Group Chief Commercial Officer of News UK. The winners will be announced at the AOP Awards ceremony on 15th June at Old Billingsgate, London.\n\nNow in its 20th year, the Digital Publishing Awards – in association with headline partner PubMatic – is celebrating those who have invested in technology and talent to deliver first-class journalism, innovation, and all-round digital excellence. This year has seen an exceptional list of submissions from new and returning entrants, across b2b, b2c, national and regional publishers, as well as from supporting teams including ad ops, sales and editorial.\n\nRichard Reeves, Managing Director at AOP comments: “Over the past year, we have seen various publishers implementing new revenue streams and innovating their strategies to respond to changing consumer behaviours, which is reflected in the inspiring award entries we have received. I’m excited to celebrate the hardworking, talented individuals and teams which make up this resilient industry, and I look forward to rewarding their outstanding achievements at our in-person awards ceremony in June.”\n\n“Despite the positive overall performance of the digital publishing industry, we should not ignore the fact that it has been a particularly challenging year for the sector and digital publishers have had to work harder, and smarter, than ever before to stay competitive and relevant,” comments Amanda Barnes. “This was demonstrated in this year’s award entries, and I’m honoured to be a judge co-chair, so I can help to put a spotlight on the publishers who have gone above and beyond to deliver the best experience for their audience.”\n\n“The media landscape continues to change at an unparalleled rate, so it’s extremely important that we take the time to recognise the incredible achievements of digital publishers, who have responded to this rapid change with sheer determination and adaptability. Congratulations to everyone who has made the 2022 shortlist, we look forward to celebrating your successes, and announcing the winners, in June,” says Dominic Carter.\n\nThe full list of finalists is as follows and can also be viewed online here.\n\nINDIVIDUAL EXCELLENCE\n\nEditor of the Year\n\nLaurence Mozafari, Digital Spy, entered by Hearst UK\n\nSimon Swift, Good Housekeeping, entered by Hearst UK\n\nLily Barclay, bbcgoodfood.com, entered by Immediate Media\n\nJames Murray, BusinessGreen, entered by Incisive Media\n\nJonathan Stapleton, Professional Pensions, entered by Incisive Media\n\nBryan Glick, Computer Weekly, entered by TechTarget\n\nRosie Blau, 1843 Magazine, entered by The Economist\n\nJournalist of the Year\n\nHarriet Clugston, NationalWorld, entered by JPI Media\n\nKarl Flinders, Computer Weekly, entered by TechTarget\n\nRising Star\n\nNatasa Christofidou, entered by Autovia\n\nMarianna Gould, Delish, entered by Hearst UK\n\nMegan Bull, entered by Hello\n\nChloe Ash, entered by Hello\n\nMayowa Quadri, entered by VERSUS\n\nSales Person of the Year\n\nEmily Bird, entered by Immediate Media\n\nLorenzo Del Seppia, entered by Magnite\n\nFelicity King, entered by News UK\n\nMatt Slade, entered by Outfit7 Group\n\nGraham Douglas, entered by PA Media\n\nJeanette Walker, entered by Independent Digital News and Media\n\nThe Local Hero Award, sponsored by Google News Initiative\n\nCharles Thomson, Archant\n\nKevin Scott, Belfast Telegraph\n\nRhiannon J Davies, Greater Govanhill CIC\n\nZak Garner-Purkis, MyLondon\n\nErin Black, Plymouth Live\n\nCaroline Wilson, The Herald\n\nTEAM EXCELLENCE\n\nAdvertising Operations Team of the Year, sponsored by Ogury\n\nArchant Advertising Operations Team, entered by Archant\n\nDigital Operations & Commercial Technology, entered by News UK\n\nOctave Ad Ops - Changing The Tyres On Moving Car, entered by Octave Audio\n\nTelegraph Media Group\n\nOzone's Publisher Operations Team, entered by The Ozone Project\n\nAudience Development Team of the Year, sponsored by UKOM\n\nThe Independent Audience Team, entered by Independent Digital News and Media\n\nMail Metro Media's Insight Team, entered by Mail Metro Media\n\nThe Sun, entered by News UK\n\nThe Times and Sunday Times Audience Team, entered by News UK\n\nEditorial Team of the Year: B2B\n\nIT Pro, entered by Future\n\nCampaign, entered by Haymarket\n\nThe BMJ Journalism Team, entered by The BMJ\n\nEditorial Team of the Year: Consumer\n\nGRAZIA, entered by Bauer Media\n\nDigital Spy, entered by Hearst UK\n\nWomen's Health, entered by Hearst UK\n\nHELLO!
