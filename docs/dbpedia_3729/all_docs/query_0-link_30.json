        "text": "Nursing in the United Kingdom is the largest health care profession in the country. It has evolved from assisting doctors to encompass a variety of professional roles. Over 700,000 nurses practice,[1] working in settings such as hospitals, health centres, nursing homes, hospices, communities, military, prisons, and academia. Most are employed by the National Health Service (NHS).\n\nNurses work across all demographics and care areas: adults, children, mental health, and learning disability. Nurses work in specialties across medicine, surgery, theatres, and investigative sciences such as imaging. Nurses also work in sub-specialities such as respiratory, diabetes, cancer, neurology, infectious diseases, liver, research, cardiac, women's health, sexual health, emergency and acute care, gastrointestinal, infection prevention and control, neuroscience, ophthalmic, pain and palliative, and rheumatology.[2] Nurses often work in multi-disciplinary teams, but increasingly work independently.\n\nTo practise, all nurses and nursing associates must be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC).[3][4]\n\nDental Nurses, Nursery nurses and Veterinary nurses are not regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council and follow different training, qualifications and career pathways.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFlorence Nightingale\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Florence Nightingale\n\nFlorence Nightingale is regarded as the founder of the modern nursing profession.[5] There was no real hospital training school for nurses until one was established in Kaiserwerth, Germany, in 1846. There, Nightingale received the training that later enabled her to establish, at St Thomas' Hospital in London, the first school designed primarily to train nurses rather than to provide nursing service for the hospital.\n\nIn the Crimean War against Russia, Nightingale was appointed to oversee the introduction of female nurses into military hospitals in Turkey. In November 1854, Nightingale arrived at the barrack hospital near Constantinople, with a party of 38 nurses. Initially the doctors did not want the nurses there and did not ask for their help, but within ten days fresh casualties arrived from the Battle of Inkermann and the nurses were fully stretched. When Nightingale returned from the Crimean War in August 1856, she hid herself away from the public's attention. For her contribution to Army statistics and comparative hospital statistics in 1860, Nightingale became the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the Statistical Society.\n\nBetsi Cadwaladr\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Betsi Cadwaladr\n\nAnother nurse active in the care of soldiers in the Crimean War was a Welsh nurse, Betsi Cadwaladr, who drastically reformed the hospital at Balaclava.[6]\n\nProject 2000\n\nProject 2000 began in 1990 and was designed to move nursing education from hospitals into universities. Prior to Project 2000, nurse education was the responsibility of hospitals and was not based in universities; many nurses who qualified prior to these reforms do not hold an academic award.\n\nAs of September 2013, degree-level nurse training programmes were required, with no option to study for a diploma.\n\nLicensure\n\n[edit]\n\nTo practise lawfully as a registered nurse, the practitioner must hold a current and valid registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The title \"registered nurse\" can only be granted to those holding such registration; this protected title is laid down in the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1979.[7]\n\nNursing and Midwifery Council\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Nursing and Midwifery Council\n\nThe core function of the NMC is to establish and improve standards of nursing and midwifery care to protect the public. It achieves this by placing registered nurses on a register, which anyone can search. As of March 2022, there were 758,303 registered nurses, midwives and nursing associates on the NMC register.[8]\n\nIts key tasks are to:\n\nregister all nurses, midwives and nursing associates\n\nensure that they are properly qualified and competent to work in the UK.\n\nset the standards of training and conduct that nurses, midwives and nursing associates need to deliver high quality healthcare consistently throughout their careers.\n\nset the standards for pre-registration nursing education\n\nensure that nurses, midwives and nursing associates keep their skills and knowledge up to date and uphold the standards of their professional code.\n\nensure that nurses, midwives and nursing associates are safe to practise by setting rules for their practice and supervision.\n\nuse fair processes to investigate allegations made against nurses, midwives and nursing associates who may not have followed the code.\n\nThe powers of the NMC are set out in the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001.[9]\n\nMembership of the council comprises 6 lay and 6 registrant members appointed by the Privy Council (United Kingdom), including at least one member from each of the four UK countries. The registrant members consist of nurses, midwives and nursing associates. The lay members currently include people with diplomatic, legal and business backgrounds.\n\nRegister\n\n[edit]\n\nThe NMC register is split into three main parts: Nurses, Midwives and Specialist Community Public Health Nurses (SCPHN). Within the registration it contains several \"sub-parts\" and qualifications e.g. sub part 1, sub part 2.[10]\n\nSee 'Nursing Workforce, Nursing Demographics' section below\n\nBasic requirement\n\n[edit]\n\nUKVI Academics ILETS 7.0 for reading, listening, and speaking and 6.5 for writing or UKVI general ILETS 4.0 & OET Grade B.[11]\n\nRevalidation\n\n[edit]\n\nRevalidation[12] is a requirement for all NMC registered members to revalidate every three years in order to ensure their registration can be renewed. Revalidation was introduced in April 2016. Revalidation replaces Prep.[13][14][15]\n\n450 practice hours, or 900 if renewing as both a nurse and midwife\n\n35 hours of CPD including 20 hours of participatory learning\n\nFive pieces of practice-related feedback\n\nFive written reflective accounts\n\nReflective discussion\n\nHealth and character declaration\n\nProfessional indemnity arrangement\n\nConfirmation\n\nCode of conduct\n\n[edit]\n\nA new NMC Code was introduced in March 2015,[17] this replaced the 2008 NMC code. The NMC code presents the professional standards that nurses and midwives must uphold in order to be registered to practise in the UK.\n\nNursing organisations and trade unions\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2024 over 200 organisations are related to nursing as regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, not including nursing departments in universities or in the NHS. These include professional bodies, nursing specialties, charities, and migrant support networks.\n\nFour unions represent nurses, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) [18] Unite the Union,[19] UNISON[20] and GMB.[21] The RCN has a dual role as both a Royal College and a trade union with over 500,000 members: nurses, midwives, students and healthcare assistants.[18]\n\nNursing values\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 6Cs\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 6Cs are Care, Compassion, Courage, Communication, Commitment and Competence.[22] They denote accepted values that are to center compassion within nursing practice.[23][24]\n\n#Hellomynameis\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 'hello my name is...' campaign encourages staff to introduce themselves by name as a way of building personal connections with patients.[25][26] The campaign operates on X using the hashtag #Hellomynameis.[25]\n\nGovernment publications\n\n[edit]\n\nMany government reports address nursing, including:\n\nMinistry of Health and Board of Education (The Athlone Report) Interim Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Nursing Services – nursing recruitment, retention and skills 1939[27]\n\nMinistry of Health, Department of Health for Scotland, and Ministry of Labour and National Service (Wood Committee) 1947 Report of the Working Party on the Recruitment and Training of Nurses - a government report on the recruitment and training of nurse\n\nSalmon Report on Senior Nursing Staff Structure 1966\n\nMayston Report on Management Structure in the Local Authority Nursing Services 1969\n\nBriggs Report of the Committee on Nursing in the United Kingdom, 1972 which reviewed the role of nurses and midwives in hospitals and in community care. It made recommendations on education, training, and professional regulation. The report was accepted in 1974.[28]\n\nHMSO Report of the Committee of Enquiry into Mental Handicap Nursing and Care (Jay report) 1979\n\nGriffiths Report DHSS 1983. NHS Management Inquiry\n\nCumberlege Report 1986 or Neighbourhood nursing: a focus for care was the report of a Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) committee advocating that community nurses be permitted to prescribe from a restricted list of treatments.\n\nFront Line Care Report and the government's response were published in 2010.[29] The chair of the commission was Ann Keen MP who trained as a nurse.\n\nShape of Caring Review (Raising the Bar) was published in March 2015.[30]\n\nIn addition there have been a number of non-governmental reports from the Royal College of Nursing, including:\n\nPlatt Report 1964 on the Reform of Nursing Education [31]\n\nJudge Report of a Commission on Nursing Education 1985 [32]\n\nWills Commission on the Future of Nursing Education 2012 Quality with Compassion: the future of nursing education led by Phil Willis[33]\n\nAdditional reports relating to nursing in the UK include:\n\nLancet Commission on Nursing (1932) – looked at the reasons for the shortages of applicants to nursing\n\nUKCC for Nursing Midwifery and Health Visiting. The Report of the Post-Registration Education and Practice Project. 1990\n\nPublications and databases\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are a number of nursing publications, journals, magazines and blogs published online and in print. An international list can be found here -\n\nSee also: List of nursing journals\n\nAs at 2023 British nursing titles included:\n\nBritish Journal of Cardiac Nursing\n\nBritish Journal of Community Nursing\n\nBritish Nursing Index\n\nCancer Nursing Practice\n\nNursing Times\n\nNursing Standard\n\nEmergency Nurse\n\nEvidence-Based Nursing (journal)\n\nGastrointestinal Nursing\n\nLearning Disability Practice\n\nMental Health Practice\n\nNurse Researcher\n\nNursing Children and Young People\n\nNursing in Practice\n\nNursing Management (journal)\n\nNursing Older People\n\nNursing Standard\n\nNursing Times\n\nPrimary Health Care (magazine)\n\nDatabases\n\n[edit]\n\nCINAHL – CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) began in the 1940s and is now a prominent database used by nurses in nursing research\n\nThe British Nursing Index (BNI) began in the 1990s and as of 2016, the database covered more than 700 journal titles\n\nWorkforce\n\n[edit]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Women in nursing and Men in nursing\n\nThe Nursing and Midwifery Council report on registration data twice a year (April and September).[34]\n\nThe majority of the nursing profession are women at around 90% of the total workforce.[35][36][37] In September 2023, 43.5 percent of the ~800,000 registered nurses and midwives were aged 21–40; the average age of registrants was 43 years, 10 months.[37] The increase in the number of 21-40 year olds was partly due to the international joiners to the register, with an increase to 29.1 percent of all registered professionals from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds.[37] 49.9% of new joiners were educated outside the UK[37]\n\nAs at September 2023 601,805 of registrants were Adult Nurses; 58,338 were Children's Nurses; 97,530 were Mental Health Nurses and 16,806 were Learning Disability Nurses[37]\n\nWorkforce planning\n\n[edit]\n\nIn England, Health Education England commission undergraduate and postgraduate education.[38] This is an autonomous national body which works to \"ensure that healthcare staff are recruited in the right numbers with the right values and behaviours to support the delivery of excellent healthcare and drive improvement\".[38] The number of commissioned places for nurses has varied year on year, as follows:\n\nAdult nursing education places commissioned each year[39]\n\n2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 14,451 13,628 11,930 11,416 12,134\n\nNursing shortages\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Nursing shortage § United Kingdom\n\nMore than a third of nurses in training fail to complete the training course, as has been the case for more than a century.[40]\n\nIn January 2016 the RCN stated that more than 10,000 nursing posts went unfilled in 2015. This represented a 3% increase year on year from 11% [41] in 2013, 14% in 2014 and 17% in 2015 of all London nursing positions and 10% as an average nationwide.[41] The Department of Health said it did not recognise the figures. The National Audit Office estimated a shortfall of 7% in the supply of nurses.[42] From 2016/17 registered nursing numbers fell 3% along with a 23% rise in de-registrations. 17,000 nurse permanently unfilled vacancies were observed.[43] In 2019 clinical pharmacology, spinal injuries, paediatric surgery, neurosurgery and neurology were the worst-affected specialities. They had an average of less than 90% of their planned nurse staffing levels.[44]\n\nSchool nurses were also in short supply.[45]\n\nHospitals in England are required to report the number of nurses employed on each ward each month. After this was established, ward nurses increased by 13,500, although the numbers of community nurses declined.[46]\n\nMigration\n\n[edit]\n\nA 2015 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development survey reported that 21.7% of NHS nurses were born abroad, compared with 26.9% in Ireland, 9.8% in Italy, 14% in Germany and 5.9% in France. The UK was also the highest exporter of nurses, with more than 50,000 working in other OECD nations.[47] The Migration Advisory Committee criticised the Department of Health, Health Education England, and NHS trusts for not recognising obvious warning signs and \"reluctantly\" agreed to keep nursing on the list of shortage occupations.[48]\n\nAn English language test is compulsory for all foreign nurses, even if they are from English-speaking countries. The process of registering as a nurse can take migrants up to a year and cost more than £3,000.\n\nNurse health\n\n[edit]\n\nCampaigns\n\n[edit]\n\nNursing is subject to regular health campaigns. Scale ranges from nationwide to ward-based.\n\nSign up to Safety[49] – National campaign to ensure staff coordinate their efforts and ideas around ensuring and enhancing safety.\n\nNHS Change Day[50] – Annual 1-day campaign to get staff contributing ideas to improve the NHS.\n\nAntibiotic Guardian[51] – Gathers pledges to slow antibiotic resistance. European Antibiotic Awareness Day (EAAD) is held on 18 November.[52]\n\nNurse health\n\n[edit]\n\nObesity and smoking have long been an issue in nurse health. The effect of nursing on nurses' physical and mental health has been a subject of research papers where the effect of shift work and working with chemicals such as in chemotherapy has been explored.[53][54][55][56][57] In 2016 the government announced £600 million was to be spent on \"tackling obesity and improving the well-being of its 1.3 million staff\".\n\nRoles\n\n[edit]\n\nNon-registered staff\n\n[edit]\n\nNon-registered staff typically working in direct patient care (often on wards), performing tasks such as personal care (washing and dressing), social care (feeding, communicating to patients and generally spending time with them) and more specialised tasks such as recording observations or vital signs (such as temperature, pulse and respiratory rate, or TPR) or measuring and assessing blood pressure, urinalysis, blood glucose monitoring, pressure sores (see Waterlow score) and carrying out procedures such as catheterisation and cannulation).\n\nSome unregistered staff work as phlebotomists, ECG technicians, and smoking cessation therapists beyond the hospital. Others expand their ward-based role to include such tasks. Few areas of nursing cannot be legally performed by suitably trained non-registered staff. They legally must be supervised (either directly or indirectly) by a registered nurse.\n\nIn 2019 it was reported that mental health support workers were increasingly covering shifts because of the shortage of mental health nurses.[58]\n\nNon-registered staff have various job titles such as \"clinical support worker\", \"care assistant\", \"nursing assistant\" and \"healthcare assistant\" (HCA). Typically they are on pay band 2 or 3, although senior healthcare assistants can be on band 4.\n\nRegistered nurse\n\n[edit]\n\nFor more information, see Registered Nurse.\n\nTraditionally, on completion of training, nurses would be employed on a hospital ward, and work as staff nurses. The ward hierarchy consists of:\n\nNursing Associate – first grade of qualified nursing staff. Ben Gummer MP introduced the role of Nursing Associates, who would work alongside healthcare support workers and qualified nurses focusing on patient care.[59] The Nursing and Midwifery Council announced in 2016 that it would professionally regulate the role (qualification code NAR).[60] Nursing associates train in the four branches of nursing, following a FdSc apprenticeship programme. They deliver care in a wide range of settings; primary, secondary, community and social care. Their training will provide them with both clinical knowledge and skills. Nursing associates are able to administer some medicines without supervision.[61] Under Agenda for Change they attract a Band 4 salary.\n\nStaff Nurses/General Nurse/Staffer of Nursing – the second grade of qualified nursing staff. These nurses are responsible for a set group of patients (e.g. administering medications, assessing, venepuncture, wound care and other clinical duties). Under Agenda for Change they attract a Band 5 salary but sometimes a Band 6 salary.\n\nSenior staff nurses/Staffer Manager – these nurses carry out many of the same tasks, but are more senior and more experienced than the staff nurses. Many NHS Trusts do not have Senior Staff Nurses as the role is seen to be superfluous.\n\nJunior/Deputy Ward Sister; Charge Nurse; Deputy Ward Manager – responsible for the day-to-day running of the ward, and may also carry specific responsibilities for the overall running of the ward (e.g. rostering) in accordance with the wishes of the ward manager. These nurses are assigned band 6. In some NHS Trusts, these will be known as Sisters/Charge Nurses.\n\nWard Manager/Ward Sister/Charge Nurse/Nurse Manager/Clinical Ward Nurse Lead – responsible for running a ward or unit, and usually has budgetary control. They will employ staff, and be responsible for all the local management (e.g. rostering, approving pay claims, purchasing equipment, delegation duties or tasks). These nurses are band 7. They are generally Senior Staff Nurses or Charge Nurses as well.\n\nSenior Ward Sister; Senior Charge Nurse; Senior Ward Manager – if there is a need to employ several nurses at a ward manager level (e.g. in A&E), then one of them often acts as the senior ward manager. These nurses attract a banding anywhere between 7 and 8c.\n\nThe status in the hierarchy of specialist nurses is variable, as each specialist nurse has a somewhat different role. They are generally experienced nurses and are employed at least on band 6.\n\nSpecialist nurses\n\n[edit]\n\nNurse practitioners – Most of these nurses obtain a minimum of a master's degree and a desired post grad certificate. They typically perform roles similar to those of physicians and physician assistants. They can prescribe medications as independent or supplementary prescribers, although they are still regulated, unlike physician's assistants. Most Nurse Practitioners (NPs) have referral and admission rights to hospital specialties. They commonly work in primary care (e.g. General Practitioner (GP) surgeries), Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments, or pediatrics although they increasingly practicein other areas. In the UK, the title \"nurse practitioner\" is legally protected.\n\nSpecialist community public health nurses – traditionally district nurses and health visitors, this group oversees research and publication activities.\n\nLecturer-practitioners (also practice education facilitators) – work in the National Health Service (NHS), and in universities. They typically work 2–3 days per week in each setting. In university, they train pre-registration student nurses and often teach specialist courses for post-registration nurses.\n\nLecturers – these nurses work full-time in universities, teaching and performing research.\n\nSpecialist nurses who generally have many years of experience in their field, along with advanceed education can be split into several major groups:\n\nSpecialist Community Public Health Nurses – Traditionally known as District Nurses and Health Visitors, this group of practitioners now includes many school nurses and Occupational Health Nurses.\n\nClinical Nurse Specialists – Those undertaking these roles commonly provide clinical leadership and education for the Staff Nurses working in their department, and will also have special skills and knowledge which ward nurses can draw upon.\n\nNurse Consultants – These nurses are similar in many ways to the clinical nurse specialist, but at a higher level. These practitioners are responsible for clinical education and training of those in their department, and many also have active research and publication activities.\n\nLecturer-Practitioners – These nurses work both in the NHS and in universities. They typically work for 2–3 days per week in each setting. In university, they may train pre-registration student nurses (see below), and often teach on specialist courses for post-registration nurses (e.g. a Lecturer-practitioner in critical care may teach a master's degree course in critical care nursing). Lecturer-Practitioners are now more often referred to by the more common job title of Practice Education Facilitators (shortened by student nurses to PEFs).\n\nLecturers – These nurses are not employed by the NHS. Instead they work full-time in universities, both teaching and performing research. Typically lecturers in nursing are qualified to a minimum of a master's degree and some are also qualified to PhD level. Some senior lecturers also attain the title of Professor. This title is more often the School/Department Dean e.g. Dean/Vice Dean School of Health & Social Care.\n\nManagers\n\n[edit]\n\nMany nurses who have substantial experience in clinical settings join the ranks of NHS management. This used to be seen as a natural career progression for ward managers positions, however with the advent of specialist nursing roles, this has become a less attractive option.\n\nModern Matrons/Nursing Director/Nurse Matron – developed in response to some patients' perception of the detachment of nursing from its vocational history, the modern matron is responsible for overseeing all nursing within a department or directorate. Modern matrons are employed on bands 8a-c. Modern matrons were poorly received by nursing staff and their imposition was not called for by any professional group within the health service.[citation needed]\n\nClinical Nurse Manager/Nurse Lead – A nurse who is responsible for an entire directorate/department (i.e. Surgical, Medical Diagnostic & Imaging etc.) or at least more than one ward, is often referred to as a clinical nurse manager. Depending on both the inclination of the NHS Trust and themselves, they may be more or less involved in actual clinical nursing or management on a clinical level. These nurses attract band 8a (or occasionally 8b/8c) under Agenda for Change.\n\nInitial assessment and observation\n\n[edit]\n\nABCDE – Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability and Exposure\n\nNEWS – National Early Warning Score\n\nHolistic assessment\n\n[edit]\n\nActivities of daily living –\n\nRichmond Agitation Sedation Score (RASS)\n\nCAM-ICU - Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU\n\nPain assessment\n\n[edit]\n\nWong Baker Faces –\n\nPAINAD –\n\nCritical Pain Observation Tool (CPOT)\n\nWaterlow score –\n\nMUST – Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nNon-registered staff education\n\n[edit]\n\nTraining is not mandatory for most people undertaking non-registered staff roles such as Healthcare Assistant. But the majority of NHS employers use \"in-house\" training for such staff, including induction programmes and ongoing education to achieve a recognised qualification. Some collaborate with local education colleges for theoretical input, and may award a recognised qualification. Some NHS employers ask for some type of health or social care qualification for recruits: for example, an SVQ/NVQ or HNC/HND under qualification names including health care, social care, and health & social care.\n\nMany trusts and health boards create opportunities for these staff members to become qualified nurses. This is termed secondment (whereby the trust/health board continues to pay them for the duration of their training, and often guarantees employment following successful completion).\n\nRegistered nurse\n\n[edit]\n\nRegistered nurses must complete a nursing degree programme recognised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council from an approved provider (universities offer these courses).\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nNursing courses adopt a 50/50 split of learning in university (lectures and examinations) and in practice (supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting). Nursing courses usually take three years and 4,600 hours.\n\nThe first year is the common foundation program (CFP), which teaches basic knowledge and skills required of all nurses. Skills include communication, taking observations, administering medication, and providing personal care. The remainder of the program consists of training specific to the student's chosen branch of nursing. The four branches of nursing training offered at university level (not including midwifery) are:\n\nAdult nursing\n\nChild nursing\n\nMental health nursing\n\nLearning disabilities nursing\n\nNursing diploma (obsolete)\n\n[edit]\n\nEarlier, State Enrolled Nurses (SENs) were trained in hospitals. Nursing education was closely linked to the hospital where nurses were placed and often lived. This has been replaced by degree requirements, although nurses who hold a nursing diploma or a certificate are able to continue to practice.\n\nNursing degree\n\n[edit]\n\nAll new qualifying nurses must hold a degree.[63]\n\nMidwifery education\n\n[edit]\n\nMidwifery training is similar in length and structure, but is sufficiently different that it is not considered a branch of nursing. 18-month programmes allow nurses already qualified in the adult branch to register as both a nurse and a midwife. Two year courses allow graduates of other disciplines to train as nurses. This is achieved by more intense study and a shortening of the common foundation programme.[64]\n\nStudent Bursary\n\n[edit]\n\nStudent nurses in England and Wales receive no bursary from the government to support them during their nurse training. Diploma students in England receive a universal bursary of £6,000 – £8,000 per year (with additional allowances for students with dependent children), while degree students may qualify for a means-tested bursary (often a considerably smaller amount). Degree students are, however, eligible for a student loan, unlike diploma students. In Scotland and Wales, all student nurses (regardless of which course they are undertaking) receive a bursary in line with the English diploma course. All student nurses in Wales study, initially, for a degree, but may choose to remain at Level 2, thereby achieving a diploma rather than a degree.[65]\n\nIt was announced in the Chancellor's Spending Review of November 2015 that from 2017 the NHS bursary would be removed for future nursing, midwifery and allied health professionals in England. Welsh and Scottish students remain unaffected.[66]\n\nAdvanced education\n\n[edit]\n\nGraduate courses require two years. They often require prior learning and relevant experience, often termed Accreditation of Prior and Experiential Learning (APEL).[67]\n\nRegistered nurses must update their skills and knowledge at the rate of at least 35 hours every three years, as part of its post-registration education and practice (PREP) requirements.[68]\n\nNurses can add certifications in areas such as cannulation, venepuncture, intravenous drug therapy, and male catheterisation are common among many others, such as Advanced Life Support.\n\nMany nurses who qualified with a diploma choose to upgrade their qualification to a degree via additional study. Many nurses prefer this to completing a degree initially, as nurses can study in a specialist field as a part of the degree. Financially, in England, it was more lucrative, as diploma students get the full bursary during their initial training, and employers often pay for the degree course as well as the nurse's salary.[69]\n\nTo become specialist nurses (such as nurse consultants, nurse practitioners, etc.) or nurse educators, some nurses undertake further training above bachelor's degree level. Master's degrees exist in various healthcare related topics, and some nurses choose to study for PhDs or other higher academic awards. District nurses and health visitors are also considered specialist nurses, and to become such they must undertake specialist training (often in the form of a top-up degree (see above) or post graduate diploma).\n\nAll newly qualifying district nurses and health visitors prescribe from the Nurse Prescribers' Formulary, a list of medications and dressings. Many of these (and other) nurses undertake training in independent and supplementary prescribing, which allows them to prescribe almost any drug in the British National Formulary. This has been the subject of debate in medical and nursing circles.[70]\n\nAs of 2012 over 25,000 Nurse Prescribers had been qualified. They may now prescribe exactly the same medicines as Doctors.\n\nOverseas nurses\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Nursing and Midwifery Council has a specific process for inducting Registered Nurses trained outside UK / EU. Prior to October 2016 an outside UK RN would have to undergo an Overseas Nursing Program known in short as the ONP. The ONP had to be undertaken by the candidate after NMC makes necessary checks and issue the candidate with a decision letter stating that the person may join a university to undertake the ONP. However, due to shortage of nurses and NMC striving for gold standards in nursing they have now updated their new process to a two part test of competence. The first part is called CBT and Part 2 (objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).[71] The process includes an English language test which has been criticised as discriminatory because it demands an academic standard of reading and writing that many native English speakers could not meet. This means at least 3,000 qualified nurses from India who are already in the UK are not on the register, and so are paid less for similar work.[72]\n\nFor International Students Who want to be a nurse at free, there are some universities and online learning platform which helps to learn nursing absolutely free.\n\nOpenLearn by The Open University: The Open University offers free online courses related to nursing and healthcare. While these won't lead to a nursing degree or diploma, they can provide valuable knowledge and skills.[73]\n\nNHS Learning Hub: The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK offers various free online courses and resources for healthcare professionals. These can help you enhance your skills and knowledge in the field.[74]\n\nApprenticeships: The UK government offers nursing apprenticeships, which allow you to earn while you learn. You'll work as a healthcare assistant while studying for a nursing degree. Apprenticeships are typically paid, and the cost of your education is covered by your employer.[75]\n\nBursaries and Scholarships: While not entirely free, you can explore nursing bursaries and scholarships to help cover the costs of your nursing education. These are often offered by universities and healthcare institutions.[76]\n\nVolunteer Work: Consider volunteering in healthcare settings to gain practical experience. While this doesn't provide a formal qualification, it can be a valuable stepping stone towards a nursing career.[77]\n\nOnline Learning Platforms: Websites like Coursera, edX, and FutureLearn offer a wide range of healthcare-related courses. While most of these courses are not entirely free, they often provide financial aid or scholarships to eligible learners.\n\nProtests\n\n[edit]\n\nNHS Student protests #BursaryorBust\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the November 2015 spending review,[78] George Osborne stated that he would remove the NHS Student Bursary from 2017. This prompted several Nursing students to organise a political demonstration with other healthcare students at King's College London outside the Department of Health in December 2015 which was attended by several hundred supporters. Kat Webb also decided to start a petition on the government's e-petition site, which received over 150,000 signatures[79][80]\n\nThe student bursary debate has been raised in parliament at Prime Minister's Questions, and is the subject of the 'Early Day Motion (EDM) 1081 – THE NHS BURSARY', which was sponsored by Wes Streeting MP.[81]\n\nDecember 2015 – Department of Health\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2015, several hundred people protested the recent removal of the NHS student bursary as announced in the November 2015 spending review.[79][80]\n\nJanuary 2016 – Downing Street March\n\n[edit]\n\nOver 7000 NHS students and supporters marched on Downing Street in January 2016.[82][83][84] The protest was attended by Shadow Health Minister Heidi Alexander MP, Wes Streeting MP, Natalie Bennett, Sian Berry, representatives of UNISON, Unite the Union and Royal College of Midwives.[85] The hashtag #bursaryorbust was the top trending Twitter.[86]\n\nFebruary 2016 – Placement walkout\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February, NHS students walked out of placement in solidarity with the Junior Doctors strike.[87]\n\nNursing research\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the full article see also (Nursing research)\n\nNursing research provides evidence used to support nursing practices. Nursing, as an evidence-based area of practice, has been developing since the time of Florence Nightingale to the present day, when many nurses now work as researchers based in universities as well as in the health care setting.\n\nIndustrial action\n\n[edit]\n\nWhilst nurses are not known for striking or taking industrial action, there have been many occasions when nurses have gone on strike, often over pay and conditions. The Royal College of Nursing had a no-strike policy for 79 years until 1995, when the policy was dropped due to pay disputes at the time.[88]\n\nIn 1939 rallied together[clarification needed] as it was reported in the Daily Mirror that many nurses were leaving the role and were enduring financial hardship.\n\nIn 1948, following the establishment of the NHS, nurses realised that their pay had decreased, which led to strike action.\n\nIn 1962 many nurses marched to Trafalgar Square as part of pay disputes under the banner of \"Empty Purses Mean Less Nurses\".\n\nIn 1970 many nurses protested at pay and conditions.\n\nIn 1973 it was reported that over 7,000 nurses marched in Sheffield.\n\nIn 1974 several protests took place by nurses over pay and conditions.\n\nIn 1976 many nurses took part in a low pay strike.\n\nIn 1982 there was a National Health Service day of action with 120,000 workers marching at various locations around the country including many nurses.\n\nIn 1988 Nurses went on strike in 1988 over pay and proposed changes to the NHS.\n\nIn 2011 Unison nurses protested and marched over pay.\n\nIn 2014 Midwives and some nurses went on strike over pay.\n\nIn 2015 nursing students protested outside the Department of Health over the removal of the NHS student bursary.[89][90]\n\nIn 2016 nursing students marched to Downing Street to protest over the removal of the NHS student bursary. The protest was attended by Shadow Health Minister Heidi Alexander MP, Wes Streeting MP, Representatives of UNISON, Unite the Union and Royal College of Midwives.[85]\n\nCompensation\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil October 2004, all nurses in the NHS were employed on a scale known as clinical grading (see below). Agenda for Change was developed by the NHS in response to criticisms that the old scale reflected length of service more than knowledge, responsibility and skills.\n\nClinical grading\n\n[edit]\n\nThis was known as the Whitley Council system. This placed nurses (and some other hospital staff) on \"grades\" between A and I (with A being the most junior, and I the most senior). Unregistered staff were employed on grades A and B (occasionally grade C). Second level nurses were employed on various grades (usually between C and E), with first level nurses taking up grades D-I.\n\nAgenda for Change\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Agenda for Change\n\nThis system puts registered staff on bands 5–8, unregistered staff such as Healthcare Assistants take up bands 2–4. Band 9 posts are for the most senior members of NHS management. Each band contains a number of pay points.\n\nThe idea of this system is \"equal pay for work of equal value\". There was a perceived discrepancy, under clinical grading, between ones grade (and therefore pay) and the work which one actually did, which Agenda for Change aimed to fix. Most NHS staff are now on the AfC system which took quite a long time to implement across the UK. A small percentage of staff went through an appeal procedure as they disagreed with the band that they have been placed on.\n\nIn 2015–16 the minimum starting salary for a registered nurse will be £21,692 in England, Wales while in Scotland it will be £21,818.[91] As of 4 June 2015 Northern Ireland have yet to announce their pay rates for 2015–16.[91]\n\nNHS Pay Review Body (NHSPRB)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe NHS Pay Review Body is an independent body that makes recommendations to the government on the pay of nurses and NHS staff. The government then makes the final decision.[92]\n\nIn 2014 the government rejected the NHSPRB recommendation for a 1% pay rise.[93]\n\nIn 2016 the government announced that nurses would receive a 1% pay rise which would take effect from 1 April 2016.[94] The RCN Chief Executive Janet Davies stated that \"The fact remains that pay awards for NHS staff have been severely constrained since 2010\".[95]\n\nPay disputes\n\n[edit]\n\nThere have recently been complaints of Agenda for Change being a sexist system, as nurses, who are mostly female, claim that, as a profession, they are under-valued using this system.[96] In 2015 the RCN stated that Nurses had suffered a drop in pay equivalent to 9.8% in real terms since 2008.[97]\n\nAgency Nurse Pay Cap\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2015 the government announced that there would be a gradual introduction of pay caps for agency nurses working under NHS England. Starting in November 2015, further caps came in February 2016 with the final cuts introduced in April 2016. The aim of the cap was to save £1bn over three years. The implications of the pay cap means that trusts will not be able to pay staff who work for an agency including doctors and nurses, more than 55% more for a shift than a permanent member of staff.[98] Jeremy Hunt in his capacity as the Health Secretary said it would stop agencies \"ripping off the NHS\".[98] In response a petition started on the government website which received over 10,000 responses.\n\nNurses finance situation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2016, several publications appeared in the media, claiming nurses depend on food banks and payday loans to survive.[99] In October 2016, Western Circle published research, claiming that the sector of NHS Nurses are heavily dependent on payday loan. According to the research, the number of nurses using payday loans has doubled in 3 years, since 2013.[100] This research brought the matter of the low wages nurses received in the UK to the attention of media outlets. The claims were that nurses' salaries were frozen for more than 6 years and in some cases, resulted in financial distress, clearly as wages have not kept pace with the cost of living increases in this time. The lack of pay increases for, particularly nurses within the NHS continues to be an important topic of public discussion in the UK.[101]\n\nNHS pension\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: NHS Pension Scheme\n\nThe NHS pension is the main pension offered to NHS staff. There have been three distinct changes made to the NHS pension. The type of pension someone is enrolled onto is referred to by the year that it was introduced or changed 1995, 2008 & 2015.[102]\n\nNursing in culture\n\n[edit]\n\nNursing in the UK has been represented across popular books, television and films, including:\n\nMrs Gamp – Sarah or Sairey Gamp is a nurse in the novel Martin Chuzzlewit by Charles Dickens, first published as a serial in 1843–1844. Mrs. Gamp, as she is usually referred to, is dissolute, sloppy and generally drunk. She became a notorious stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of campaigners like Florence Nightingale. The caricature was popular with the British public.\n\nSue Barton – a British series of seven career novels aimed at teenage girls, beginning with Sue as a Student Nurse and working through different roles up to the final book as Staff Nurse. The books were written from 1936 to 1952, and republished several times up to 1991, with more recent vintage editions being available.[103]\n\nCarry On Films – In total there were 31 British comedy films (1958–1992), their humour was in the British comic tradition of music halls and bawdy seaside postcards. Four of these focused on hospital settings; Carry On Nurse (1959),[104] Carry On Doctor (1967),[105] Carry On Again Doctor (1969),[106] and Carry On Matron (1972).[107]\n\nCasualty–a BBC drama series airing from 1986 to 2023 focusing on a hospital accident and emergency department.[108] Casualty had a spin off Holby City airing from 1999 to 2021.[109]\n\n24hrs in A&E – a Channel 4 British documentary airing from 2011 to 2023 focusing on Accident and Emergency department of a hospital. Initially set in King's College Hospital, Camberwell; from the 7th series it was set in St George's Hospital, Tooting and then from Season 30 Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham[110]\n\nGetting On – a satirical BBC sitcom based on a geriatric ward in an NHS hospital. It is written by its core cast, Jo Brand, Vicki Pepperdine, and Joanna Scanlan. Three series were aired between 2009 and 2012.[111]\n\nCall the Midwife – a BBC period drama series about a group of nurse midwives working in the East End of London in the late 1950s and 1960s.[112]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nQueen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps"
